        <p>WALL STREET'S political views are usually summed up with the simple logic that is a staple of junior high math. If all wealthy people are Republicans, and all bankers and traders are wealthy, then all bankers and traders are. . . .</p>
        <p>To be sure, there are plenty of exceptions, most notably Robert E. Rubin, who jumped from running Goldman Sachs to become President Clinton's Treasury secretary and is now chairman of Citigroup's executive committee. But for both personal reasons (cut my taxes) and ideological ones (competition is good, except on investment banking fees), most financial professionals prefer the Republican mantra of smaller government programs, less regulation and, of course, lower taxes.</p>
        <p>This year would seem to be no exception. The Republican candidate, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, is offering enough treats to warm even Gordon Gekko's heart. Mr. Bush wants to end the estate tax, cut income taxes and give people a chance to invest some of their Social Security taxes in the stock market. Vice President Al Gore, on the other side of the aisle, prefers tough environmental regulations and adding a prescription drug benefit to Medicare, a step that the drug industry opposes.</p>
        <p>Yet Wall Street remains strangely tepid about Mr. Bush. What gives?</p>
        <p>Just this: The last five years have been the best in the history of the United States capital markets. Since the end of 1994, the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index has more than tripled, and the value of United States stocks has risen by more than $10 trillion, to $16 trillion. The Street may be too conservative to thank Bill Clinton explicitly for its good fortune, but it is well aware that the federal budget surplus has played an integral role in powering the market higher.</p>
        <p>To finance deficits, the government must sell bonds to investors, competing for capital that could otherwise be used to invest in stocks or corporate bonds. Government borrowings raise long-term interest rates, stifling economic growth.</p>
        <p>But in the last five years, thanks to tax increases in 1990 and 1993 and relatively restrained government spending, the federal budget has gone from deficit to surplus. As a result, long-term interest rates have fallen from 8 percent to less than 6 percent, after dipping as low as 5 percent in late 1998. With lower interest rates and lots of capital available, companies of all sizes have been able to raise the money they need to grow. In turn, strong economic growth has stimulated consumer spending, raised tax revenue and increased the government's surplus, making even more capital available for private companies.</p>
        <p>Sure, the surplus is not the only reason that the economy has performed so well lately. Information technology and the explosion of the Internet have probably been even more important. But investors are not interested in a return to deficit spending.</p>
        <p>''Wall Street likes it just as it is and doesn't want to see any big policy changes,'' said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer of the First Albany Corporation.</p>
        <p>But both Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush are eager to get their hands on the surplus for new spending programs and tax cuts. Either move would be a mistake, said Byron Wien, chief United States investment strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. In fact, if the new president is able to spend the surplus, the Federal Reserve will probably raise short-term interest rates, Mr. Wien said. That's because the Fed is already worried that the United States economy is growing too fast and increasing the risk of inflation, and that deficits (or lower surpluses) will further stimulate the economy in the short run.</p>
        <p>''I don't want either party's program to pass,'' Mr. Wien said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Johnson agreed. While the Street has a slight preference for Mr. Bush, it would be happiest if neither party controls both the White House and Congress next year, he said. ''I'd like to see a Republican president neutralized by a Democratic Congress,'' he said. ''Give us policy gridlock.''</p>
