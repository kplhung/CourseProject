        <p>In the movie ''The Perfect Storm,'' when the actress Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio is seen piloting the fishing boat the Hannah Boden, the person really steering is Capt. Larry J. Walsh Jr. who was a swordfish fisherman operating out of Barnegat Light for 22 years. Captain Walsh, who stopped fishing two years ago after an injury, got the movie job on the recommendation of his friend Kirk Larson, the captain of the Lindsay L., a scallop boat that sails out of Barnegat Light and appeared in the movie as the  Hannah Boden. Captain Walsh worked on the film in Gloucester, Mass., from August to October 1999.</p>

        <p>In the movie ''The Perfect Storm,'' when the actress Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio is seen piloting the fishing boat the Hannah Boden, the person really steering is Capt. Larry J. Walsh Jr. who was a swordfish fisherman operating out of Barnegat Light for 22 years. Captain Walsh, who stopped fishing two years ago after an injury, got the movie job on the recommendation of his friend Kirk Larson, the captain of the Lindsay L., a scallop boat that sails out of Barnegat Light and appeared in the movie as the  Hannah Boden. Captain Walsh worked on the film in Gloucester, Mass., from August to October 1999.</p>
        <p>Q. What did you do in the movie?</p>
        <p>A. Whenever the boat went out, I was running it. There are two steering wheels in the wheel house. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio had her hands on one wheel, but I was steering with the other. I tried to let steer a couple of times in the rough-weather scenes and docking the boat and all. But you don't just jump on an 85-foot boat and expect to be able to put it wherever you want it. You have to think a minute ahead, like which way is the wind coming from, and where is the current going to be.</p>
        <p>Q. Did you ever actually encounter rough weather during the filming?</p>
        <p>A. We went out in Tropical Storm Floyd, and there were some pretty unhappy campers that day. You've got a film crew of 54 people and at least half of them were seasick, and those poor guys up on the bow, all the grips and the lighting and cameramen. Mary Elizabeth was looking a little queasy, but she did real good.  I'm used to tropical storms and hurricanes. It doesn't bother me at all.  You want to go out? Fine. But I guarantee you'll never ask me to do that again.</p>
        <p>Q. Have you ever been in weather so bad you thought you would die?</p>
        <p>A. No. There's no sense in worrying about it, really. You either are or you  aren't. But you just cut down the odds of something going wrong, something stupid. You check all your rigging out and your fuel filters. You clear off the decks, get everybody inside and batten down the hatches. You got to be ready for it, you know?</p>
        <p>Q. You must be pretty brave.</p>
        <p>A. It's not brave. You deal with the things as they come along, and then you sit down later and say ''Geez, I don't believe I did that.''</p>
        <p>Q. Since your injury what have you been doing?</p>
        <p>A. Working on the boats in the dock. You pick up plumbing, welding, hydraulics, refrigeration when you have worked on boats. So I work on the boats when they come in. The crew members want to get off. They would just as soon give it to me and say adios.</p>
        <p>Q. Where do the long-line fisherman from Barnegat Light fish?</p>
        <p>A. Generally from Hatteras to Grand Banks, New Foundland. The long-liners fish for swordfish and tunafish, and then a lot of boats switch over to monk fishing in the fall, winter and early spring and fish 20 to 30 miles off shore.</p>
        <p>Q. How many long-line boats are based in Barnegat?</p>
        <p>A. About a dozen long-liners now, there used to be about 20 of them in the mid-80's and early 90's. But it's a tough business.</p>
        <p>Q. What do your friends and family think of the movie?</p>
        <p>A. My mother and I went to see it. I guess she never really knew what I did for a living, and she looked at me, and it was like -- is this realistic? And I said, yeah, very. She said something to the effect of I'm glad you don't do it anymore.</p>
