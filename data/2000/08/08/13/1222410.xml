        <p>In his state-of-the-nation speech to the Indonesian People's Consultative Assembly, President Abdurrahman Wahid issued a tough-minded rebuttal to critics who say he has not done enough to address Indonesia's many troubles. However, Mr. Wahid, who is blind, fell asleep as the speech was being read by an aide. Other aides fed him candy to wake him whenever he drifted off. Several days later, Mr. Wahid announced he would cede day-to-day administration of the government to Vice President Megawati Sukarnoputi.</p>
