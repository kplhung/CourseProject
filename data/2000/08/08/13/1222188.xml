        <p>The bars in the Fulton Fish Market bring to mind the drinking establishments of the Alaskan Panhandle. The men are coarse and rough. The language is salty and blasphemous. And when the fish are in, pockets are filled with money.</p>
        <p>The best time in the fish market is Friday, because Friday is payday; and 8 A.M. is happy hour. It is then that the sun breaks through riverbank fog and the men drift to the saloons as predictably as the tide.</p>
        <p>Some men sit bare-chested, others with gaffs on their shoulders, all with fish entrails on their boots. The company stinks.</p>
        <p>They are the journeymen: the filleters, box men, freezer workers and carters. They work like oxen and drink like camels, and they come from exotic-sounding places like Babylon and Ivory Coast and Sierra Madre.</p>
        <p>David Reid comes from Uptown. ''Every man on these slips works himself into a hump,'' says Mr. Reid, 46, a thick man made thicker each day by the 45,000 pounds of tuna and swordfish he moves. ''And you got to water the hump.''</p>
        <p>His eyes are reddened like coals from the cigarettes he smokes and the early-morning hours he works. His arms are big and blistered because rubbing against swordfish will burn the skin like poison oak.</p>
        <p>There are two bars in the fish market where the journeymen like to drink: the Market Bar at Peck Slip and Front Street and Jeremy's Ale House at Front and Dover Streets. Like most of the older buildings in the district, the Market Bar is made of hand-molded brick, stuck together with mortar as thick as cake icing.</p>
        <p>Mr. Reid will not drink here because he has a beef with the owner. The cause of the beef is forgotten, but the grudge is not. But he likes to walk by the Market Bar on paydays anyway and watch the rough-looking women who dress in lace and sit on the bench in front of the plate glass window.</p>
        <p>Among them is a dissipated woman who is reviled by some, loved by others and known by all as the Kook of South Street.</p>
        <p>''Annie been here least 40 years, probably more,'' Mr. Reid says. When asked her age Ms. Annie lifts her shirt. She wears no bra and says with no humility: ''Two!''</p>
        <p>''Oooooeeeeeeh!'' hoot the journeymen. Mr. Reid wanders on and says nothing until he reaches Jeremy's, where he takes a stool and orders a quart of beer.</p>
        <p>Jeremy's is a converted garage and the kegs are stacked in the corner like bowling pins. The walls are lined with knickknacks and bras. The skylight provides good sunshine to drink by.</p>
        <p>''Annie hasn't changed, but plenty of other things around here have changed,'' Mr. Reid says. ''It ain't so tough around here for one. Used to be loan-sharking, dope, you name it. Once I saw 'em put a forklift through a car and move it cause it was parked in the wrong spot.</p>
        <p>''Then there's less fish. Like sturgeon. It's the most incredible fish. It has lips like human beings. I can't get over that. Like human beings. It's illegal to sell it now.'' He orders a second quart.</p>
        <p>''Yep. 'Bout the only thing that hasn't changed is Annie. Annie and this fish stink. I ain't never been able to wash it off.''</p>
