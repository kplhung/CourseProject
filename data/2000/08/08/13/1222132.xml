        <p>SEVENTY-FIVE Westchester residents who commute to Manhattan from the Dobbs Ferry railroad station will be without parking spaces starting this Tuesday.</p>
        <p>In a letter to holders of its nonresident parking permits, the Dobbs Ferry announced last month that because of planned construction, only Dobbs Ferry residents will be able to use the station's lot for the next few months. When the project is finished, there will be fewer spots for nonresident commuters, most of whom live in Ardsley.</p>
        <p>The permit holders had hoped for a grace period through Labor Day, depending on when construction is to begin, but Brian Monahan, the mayor of Dobbs Ferry, said a delay was unlikely.</p>
        <p>At a meeting at the Village Hall in Ardsley, about 25 residents gathered to share their frustration with town officials.</p>
        <p>''Where are you going to go?'' asked John Rapawy, a systems specialist, who has been parking at the Dobbs Ferry lot for 12 years. ''Usually I get to the station at 10 after 7, to catch the 7:20,'' he told two other displaced commuters. Now, he said, he will have to catch an earlier train in hopes of snaring one of the few metered parking spots near the station.</p>
        <p>''Retiring sounds nice right about now,'' said Mike Goetz, who has held a permit for 13 years and takes the train from Dobbs Ferry every day. ''I'm going to start experimenting and see what works.''</p>
        <p>The lot, which has about 425 legal spaces, will be resurfaced in phases over three or four months, said Mayor Monahan. Dobbs Ferry residents will be allowed to use the lot while construction goes on.</p>
        <p>In the end, the lot will have about 457 spaces, but the number of permits for nonresidents will drop to 35, from 75. ''We've had more demand from residents,'' Mr. Monahan said.  ''The crunch has gotten very severe in the last few years.''</p>
        <p>A six-month nonresident permit costs $165; Dobbs Ferry residents pay $85 a year.</p>
        <p>This leaves the Ardsley commuters with few choices.</p>
        <p>At the meeting, the mayor of Ardsley, Sam Abate Jr., and George Calvi, the village manager, proposed some options. The county runs two buses to the Dobbs Ferry station that pass through Ardsley, but both stop running early in the evening.</p>
        <p>''When I first moved to Ardsley,'' said Mark Mildner, a village trustee who does not commute from Dobbs Ferry, ''if you wanted to park at Dobbs Ferry there was no problem.'' He said that some residents had started parking at metered spots at the Scarsdale and Hartsdale stations. ''The problem with meters is basically the uncertainty'' of getting a spot, he said.</p>
        <p>''I plan on parking at the Scarsdale lot,'' said Nancy Kaboolian, who has had a Dobbs Ferry permit for five and a half years. ''Hopefully I will get a permit there in the lottery system.'' She said that the ride to Scarsdale was not much longer but that the Harlem Line, which serves Scarsdale and Hartsdale, is more congested than the Hudson Line, which serves Dobbs Ferry.</p>
        <p>The Hartsdale Parking Authority has been looking into adding 250 spaces, many of which would go to non-residents, according to Mr. Abate, who met with Hartsdale officials. But that project would take months and is out of his hands, he admitted. Hartsdale parking permits are $100 for three months but the waiting list is years long.</p>
        <p>Another possibility is for Ardsley commuters to park at a little-used 120-space parking lot at Mercy College near a small station in Irvington. Mr. Abate said that Mercy officials were receptive to the idea and Ardsley residents would pay about as much as they do now, but it would require approval from the Irvington Planning Board. Mr. Abate went before the board last month and it has have scheduled a public hearing for early September. mercy owns it, need permission, same as current</p>
        <p>''In many ways it really is a nice solution,'' Mr. Abate said, ''that pretty much replaces what people have now.''</p>
        <p>After all options had been exhausted, the residents still seemed unsure of what they would do. One resident summed up what everyone was thinking. Raising his hand he asked, ''Are there any jobs available in Ardsley?''</p>
