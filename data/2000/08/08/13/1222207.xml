        <p>They are not called the Motley Crue for nothing. The poster boys for substance abuse play their music hard, and like their women easy. And they take no prisoners.</p>
        <p>While Tommy Lee (who left the band in 1999) might have been the most interesting of the lot, his current replacement is a stunner. It's a woman.</p>
        <p>Yes, a woman has joined the band known as much for their testosterone-driven songs as their pummeling sing-along riffs. The band whose anthem is ''Girls, Girls, Girls'' has put its drumsticks where its big loud mouth is.</p>
        <p>Samantha Maloney from Hole has joined Motley Crue on tour. She's temporarily covering for Randy Castillo, who is recovering from surgery. That should be reason enough to check them out at the Blockbuster Sony Entertainment Center in Camden at 7:30 tonight.</p>
