        <p>DeSILVER-George Burnham. Of Naples, Florida, formerly of New York City and Northwest, CT died August 6th, 2000 after a short, but valiant, struggle with cancer. He was a quiet, good and loving man, whose dedication to civil liberties, equality, and human rights followed the commitment of his distinguished parents, Margaret and Albert, and led to his years of service at the United Nations with the international League for the Rights of Man. His kind spirit will be missed by his family and many friends. He leaves his devoted wife of 49 years, Claire; his daughter, Susan and her beloved companion, Ronald Anthony; granddaughter, Margaret; brother, Carll Harrison, and his wife, Colette. He was predeceased by his dear son, George Steven, who died in 1988. A Cremation will be held in Naples; his remains will be interred in the DeSilver family plot at Greenwood Cemetery, Brooklyn, NY. A memorial service will be held at a later date. Donations in his memory may be made to Hospice of Naples, Inc., 1095 Whippoorwill Lane, Naples, Fla. 34105.</p>
