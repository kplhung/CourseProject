        <p>COLLEGE. An intellectual challenge. An experiment in self-reliance. An opportunity to meet people from all over the world and share a four-year adventure with them. Above all, a time to go shopping.</p>
        <p>Like any new, long-term experience, college requires a few investments, beyond tuition and books. Moving into a dorm means saying farewell to a well-stocked kitchen, fully outfitted cleaning closets and home entertainment centers. Welcome to the world of minifridges and Dustbusters.</p>
        <p>With a standard dorm room equipped with only beds, desks and bureaus, the challenge is to turn this space into home.</p>
        <p>Most students, it seems, start with the essentials: music and entertainment.</p>
        <p>''People take it for granted, but I really wouldn't want to be without my stereo,'' said Kevin Gillette, 26, a Freedonia, N.Y., native and a recent graduate of Colgate University in Hamilton, N.Y.</p>
        <p>TV-VCR combinations are among the hottest selling items for dorm rooms at Gracious Home in Manhattan, said Jordan Smilowitz, vice president of purchasing. ''Years ago we didn't see people buying a television,'' he said. ''It wasn't part of a college dorm room setup. Now they're willing to spend more on the luxuries.''</p>
        <p>At Purchase College, ''Everyone has Play Station, and everyone has a television,'' said Bill McAdams, a 22-year-old senior from Carmel. He added that cactus plants and fish tanks, which are reputed to relieve stress, are also popular.</p>
        <p>Another essential is the telephone. One of the most popular models on campus is the VTech Fun Fone, a cordless unit in translucent plastic, which comes in red, blue, green and purple and retails for $49.95.</p>
        <p>While a colorful phone and a good stereo will lend a homey touch and help drown out a roommate's snoring, there are many practical necessities for dorm living, most discovered by trial and error.</p>
        <p>Most important, perhaps, is food. All residential campuses have meal plans, but not all students enjoy them. This is where a small refrigerator and microwave comes in handy, and there are companies that are happy to rent units that combine both. But, for the frugal college student, there is always the hot pot. (One example is the Rival Crockette, $9.99.)</p>
        <p>''I find it to be the essential tool of a college student,'' said Carolyn Polk, 21, of Lenox, Mass., a senior art student at Endicott College in Beverly, Mass. ''It cooks hordes of different things -- pasta, soup, eggs, rice, vegetables, oatmeal, mac and cheese, and of course boils water for coffee or tea.'' Not to mention the college favorite, Ramen noodles.</p>
        <p>After food comes study. Because dorm lighting is often inadequate, a high-powered non-halogen lamp can make it easier on the eyes. (Halogens are almost always against the fire codes.) Invest in more than one -- a desk lamp, a standing lamp and a bedside lamp may provide adequate illumination.</p>
        <p>What else could a student need?</p>
        <p>''Students are always looking for things to make it more like home,'' said John Stein, associate director of student affairs at Sarah Lawrence College in Yonkers. ''The bottom line is that those rooms look very institutional. It's amazing to see how they make the rooms more reflections of themselves than of the school.''</p>
        <p>One way to do that is with furniture. Inflatable chairs, armchairs, futons and air mattresses are popular on many campuses, as are wall-hangings made from sarongs or other fabrics collected on foreign travels.</p>
        <p>''Some ask to store their beds and sleep on their mattresses on the floor,'' Mr. Stein said. ''What I also see is a throwback to the 1960's and 70's: here, students are bringing lava lamps.''</p>
        <p>Milk crates, which sell in college bookstores for as little as $2 apiece, provide an inexpensive solution to storage problems.</p>
        <p>In addition to furnishings, students need the tools to maintain their rooms. Believe it or not, college students can be disgusted by the dirt they accumulate, and some of them actually clean their rooms.</p>
        <p>The Swiffer Sweeper (about $14 at Kmart), a broom of sorts that comes with small cloths that can be used to collect dirt, is the best friend of those with hardwood or tile floors.</p>
        <p>For those with carpets, Dustbusters or electric brooms are highly effective.</p>
        <p>Kristina Gross, an Albany native and a sophomore at Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley, Mass., has found Febreze, an odor-removing spray, to be an important tool in fighting filth, particularly when it comes to sporting equipment.</p>
        <p>Clorox wipes are also useful for the lazy housekeeper. Pretreated with a cleaning solution, they clean and disinfect with only one product.</p>
        <p>I'd also recommend a wooden drying rack for laundry. When the dryers are full (or you don't have enough quarters) a drying rack works wonders.</p>
        <p>Just like a home, a dorm room needs to be decorated. And to get those posters and pictures on the wall, a tool kit will also prove useful.</p>
        <p>''I wish I had had a tool kit,'' said Laura Carlton, 21, of Holyoke, Mass., a recent Mount Holyoke College graduate. ''I always had to borrow stuff from other people for hanging pictures, putting together a coat rack, things you wouldn't expect.''</p>
        <p>A small tool kit with a hammer, scissors, Phillips and regular screwdrivers, tape measure and vice grips should be right on target. Tool Source has a 45-piece household tool set available at Kmart for $13.99</p>
        <p>And don't forget the duct tape, which can fix everything from book bindings to shoes and is often invaluable for emergency car repairs as well.</p>
