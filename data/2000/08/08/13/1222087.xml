        <p>THE pianist Stuart Hemingway always figured he'd get around to recording his own work. He didn't realize, however, that he would take until after his 58th birthday for it to happen.</p>
        <p>''I never really focused on it,'' said Mr. Hemingway, a 16-year resident of the Riverside section of Greenwich. ''I was playing for other people and just never got around to it.''</p>
        <p>Until last September. Mr. Hemingway, who is blind, decided to record live, hoping to catch the fused energy of players and audience on a particularly good night. He called on the bassist Michael Bocchicchio, who worked with Mel Torme, and the drummer Tony Lupo of Zoot Sims fame to play at the Paradise Performing Arts Center in Paradise, Calif. The CD is titled, appropriately enough, ''Cool Jazz in Paradise'' (MJT Records).</p>
        <p>It is a collection of nine popular songs, including Howard Dietz and Arthur Schwartz's ''You and the Night and the Music,'' Cole Porter's ''All of You'' and the George Gershwin-Du Bose Heyward classic, ''Summertime.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hemingway also recruited his old friend Dick Haymes Jr. to sing and play flute on three songs. Two, ''They Say It's Spring'' and ''Fine Spring Morning,'' were written by the senior Dick Haymes, a pretty gifted singer himself.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hemingway's renditions of the songs are not cool in the industry's meaning of the word, meaning a hybrid of pop and jazz style. Rather they are pop songs performed in the genuine jazz trio style. The trio's intention is to serve the composers' melodies and moods while allowing its own style to swing and shine.</p>
        <p>''I'd say these songs are indicative of the composers I like best,'' said Mr. Hemingway from Camp Dudley in Westport, N.Y., where he has taught piano the last 12 summers. ''Dietz and Schwartz, Porter, Gershwin -- their songs hold up the best,'' he added.</p>
        <p>Much of the time Mr. Hemingway has spent playing for other artists has been in pop music. During the 60's and 70's he performed with such bands as the Shangri-las. ''I did some work in the studio, some in gigs. Since I can't read charts, I didn't do as much studio work as I'd have liked.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hemingway started toying with his parents' piano as a child growing up in New York. He started playing formally while summering at Camp Dudley through the 50's. He studied in the early 60's with John Mehegan, a jazz critic at Juilliard.</p>
        <p>''John taught me to arrange chord structures and developed my jazz technique,'' said Mr. Hemingway, who met Dick Haymes Jr. at the time. ''Dick was also a student of John's. At first I didn't realize who his father was until my mother told me. Then I tried to convince him he needed a piano player to accompany his singing.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hemingway eventually became a teacher himself, quite by accident, he said. ''I was doing an arrangement for a friend and I heard her son playing the piano. He was good and I just sat down with him. I said he really should develop this talent. They asked me if I would teach him.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hemingway took on many other students and continues today with a handful of aspiring pianists. ''They really play jazz,'' he said. ''They ask to play Thelonious Monk and Miles Davis. It's very rewarding.''</p>
        <p>Almost as rewarding as recording his own CD. Mr. Hemingway was well received at a CD release party in May at Arcadia Coffee Company in Old Greenwich. The positive response fueled his desire to record his second CD.</p>
        <p>''There's lots of songs I didn't include on the first, like 'Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?' '' said Mr. Hemingway, who recorded a Christmas album in 1964 that never was released. ''I'd also like to intersperse a few of my own songs. I've had so much fun with the first recording I'd like to keep it going.''</p>
        <p>''Cool Jazz in Paradise'' is available from MJT Records (21 Summit Road, Riverside 06878; $15.95 plus sales tax and $2 postage) or from the Music Source (1078 East Putnam Avenue, Riverside 06878; 203-698-0444). Further information is available by calling (203) 637-1830.</p>
