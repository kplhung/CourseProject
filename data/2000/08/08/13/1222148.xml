        <p>IN a city where the names of some neighborhoods bestow cachet and some addresses are dropped like royal titles, 14th Street has probably never achieved even a minor peerage.</p>
        <p>Never mind, says Gary Gaines, an importer who is about to trade in an apartment off Sutton Place for a loft in the Greenwich, a cavernous former department store at 14th Street and the Avenue of the Americas. He has bought 2,150 square feet of finished but unpartitioned space on the third floor.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gaines's neighbors at the Greenwich will include other migrants from uptown, among them Brian Brooks, who sold his apartment at the venerable Beresford on Central Park West, and Joel Solomon, who lives on the Upper East Side at 80th Street and Third Avenue. Mr. Solomon bought a loft for his 25-year-old son, Stephen, and a penthouse for himself.</p>
        <p>''I will miss the seclusion and seeing Bobby Short in my elevator,'' Mr. Gaines said, ''but I like living in the new, being part of something happening. Fourteenth Street is on the threshold of a major transformation, and this building is at its center.''</p>
        <p>People already living on or near 14th Street would probably say that it has already crossed that threshold, starting with the city's $3.6 million reconstruction of Union Square Park in 1983 and the 1987 opening of the Zeckendorf Towers, a 652-apartment condominium and office complex.</p>
        <p>But subsequent and future projects give weight to Mr. Gaines's notion that another threshold has been reached.</p>
        <p>The signs of change are noticeable from the western end of the street at least as far east as First Avenue, where Stuyvesant Town dominates the landscape. (Even there, new fencing and ornamental gate posts are planned, and new trees are to be planted.)</p>
        <p>These changes are giving 14th Street a new persona as a residential boulevard, a booming retail thoroughfare and a mecca for high-tech enterprises.</p>
        <p>At the western side, near 10th Avenue, art galleries, trendy restaurants, late-night clubs and one of the city's highest-fashion emporiums are bringing elegance and verve to the gritty meatpacking district.</p>
        <p>From Eighth to Fifth Avenues, new technology and dot.com companies are clamoring for space, joining the publishers, photographers, graphic designers and advertising agencies already encamped there. An eyesore was removed recently when the long-empty 14th Street Armory was torn down earlier this year to make way for two new apartment towers and a Y.M.C.A.</p>
        <p>On the east side of the street, further improvements are planned for Union Square Park. The city has earmarked $2.5 million to expand the park by 20,000 square feet at its southwest corner between 14th and 15th Streets.</p>
        <p>East of the park, New York University is expanding its domain, constructing a 16-story dormitory on the site of the old Palladium nightclub. The new building is two doors away from a 19-story N.Y.U. dorm completed two years ago. The university has also signed a lease for a 14-story building being put up by Alex Forkosh, a developer, on the site of former Sahara Hotel, once a notorious single-room-occupancy hotel and drug haven at 14th Street and Third Avenue.</p>
        <p>David Gmach, the executive director of both the 14th Street-Union Square Business Improvement District and the 14th Street-Union Square Local Development Corporation, considers the conversion of the Sahara and the demolition of the 14th Street Armory, both of which were symptomatic of decay, to be hallmarks of the changes that have swept across the entire street.</p>
        <p>Where the armory stood between the Avenue of the Americas and Seventh Avenue, two residential towers will be developed by the Orda Management Corporation and the Related Companies. One will contain 60 luxury condominiums for N.Y.U. faculty members; the other will be a rental with 225 units, 20 percent of which will be reserved for low-income tenants. The McBurney Y.M.C.A. will occupy two floors at the base of the building.</p>
        <p>''I would be surprised if you could find another single street with that much going on in a two-to-three-year period,'' Mr. Gmach said during a recent walk from 10th Avenue to Avenue B. ''There is at least one million square feet of development that has either been recently completed or is under way.''</p>
        <p>As much as any artery in the city, 14th Street, which is the dividing line between Chelsea and Greenwich Village and also borders the Flatiron district and the Ladies Mile Historic District, has flourished and withered and then flourished again.</p>
        <p>A century ago, it was the cultural and political epicenter of the city: the Academy of Music, vaudeville theaters  and Tammany Hall were all thriving. Before the rise of Fifth Avenue as a commercial hub, 14th Street was a retail center, housing the early quarters of Macy's, Tiffany's and Best &amp; Company. When those stores moved uptown, bargain emporiums like S. Klein and J. W. Mays set the tone for the area.</p>
        <p>Then about 35 years ago, the area began to slide into deterioration, its middle-class shops shuttered or replaced by cut-rate stores with flashy merchandise displayed on the sidewalk. Union Square became a magnet for drug dealers and derelicts.</p>
        <p>''Mays went out, the recession came in, and so did the junkies,'' said Alex Barbagianis, an owner of Ariston Florist, which moved to 14th Street and Fifth Avenue nine years ago after 16 years in a location a block to the west. ''You could buy any kind of dope here, and we had a tough time.''</p>
        <p>Then, several significant changes took place, and a turnaround seemed possible. The Union Square Greenmarket was established in 1976, the city refurbished the park, and Zeckendorf Towers opened on the site of the former S. Klein store at Union Square East.</p>
        <p>As Chelsea became gentrified, lower Fifth Avenue acquired national retailers and chic shops, and stores like Bed Bath &amp; Beyond and Barnes &amp; Noble moved to the southern end of the Avenue of the Americas, it became all but inevitable that 14th Street would be upgraded.</p>
        <p>''If Times Square is the crossroads of the world, then 14th Street is the crossroads of New York, because it's where uptown and downtown come together as a 24-hour community where people both live and work,'' said Mr. Gmach, the BID executive. ''Everything New Yorkers could want is at their fingertips. There is a blend of activities and diversity here.''</p>
        <p>Although that assessment is widely shared, many would also agree that 14th Street is a work in progress, and more remains to be done to elevate it to first-class status. Some developers of residential property, for example, still insist on giving their buildings addresses on 13th or 15th Streets. Mosbacher Properties, the developer of the Greenwich, for example, plans to put the entrance on 13th Street.</p>
        <p>''Fourteenth Street is one of the last major crosstown streets in the city to undergo improvement,'' said David Schore, the president of Mark Holdings, which recently bought the building at 25 West 14th Street. ''Fifty-Seventh Street was always great, and 42nd and 34th now have a lot of new retailers.''</p>
        <p>If he were to measure, he said, ''Forty-Second Street is 90 percent done, 34th is 50 percent done, and 14th is 50 percent done. There are still a lot of 99-cent and electronics stores, and those will be squeezed out by higher rents and hopefully higher-rent retailers. It will never be an upper Madison Avenue, but it could be a healthy extension of lower Fifth Avenue with a lot of national chains.''</p>
        <p>MR. SCHORE is in the process of turning his building into a combination retail and office space with a total of 70,000 square feet. ''Even before I closed, and it was public that I was the buyer, I was getting constant calls from brokers,'' he said. ''I have seen both new and traditional office users come in.''</p>
        <p>Lucille Strider, a broker who moved to 14th Street 11 years ago, contends that the street has already arrived. ''I do retail and apartment rentals and apartment sales, and this area is hot as a pistol,'' she said. ''Prices just keep going up. There is no cap. There seems to be constant need, and some days are like a feeding frenzy.''</p>
        <p>''Two years ago we were lucky to get $30 a square foot for retail space,'' she said. ''Now it is between $75 and $100.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Strider has had a front-row seat for the evolution of her neighborhood. ''I moved into a building between Fifth and University Place in 1989 that had a large OTB parlor downstairs,'' she said. ''At 6 p.m. everything closed and shuttered, and it was like living in the Third World.''</p>
        <p>About seven years ago, OTB moved out and its premises were divided in half, with Radio Shack taking part of it and the rest remaining vacant. Now a day spa will move into the other half. The Garden of Eden, a specialty food shop that offers everything from charcuterie to caviar, has also recently moved into the building.</p>
        <p>Andrew Rasiej, the chief executive and president of the Digital Club Network, an Internet company that cybercasts live concerts, in many ways typifies the kind of businessman who would not consider the more traditional Wall Street or Midtown areas for his office.</p>
        <p>The founder of Irving Plaza, the music club on nearby Irving Place, he is negotiating a lease for a two-story former furniture store between Fifth Avenue and the Avenue of the Americas.</p>
        <p>''I am in a Silicon Alley business, and it is important for my company and my employees to feel that they are in the middle of a network of Silicon Alley,'' he said. ''There is no better place to feel like you're in the middle of the New York technology community than 14th Street because of its proximity to the Flatiron district and easy access to transportation.''</p>
        <p>Like many of his peers, Mr. Rasiej said lifestyle considerations were as important a part of his decision as the quality of the working space.</p>
        <p>He noted that his 60 employees, soon to be expanded to 75, range in age from 22 to 35.  ''Most people in dot.coms work 10- to 12-hour days,'' he said. ''For them to have any personal time, they need to be near home and near their social life. Nobody wants to commute an hour to get home or to a party. Being in the center, you have restaurants, bars, clubs, theaters, and good transportation is a recruiting asset.'' Fourteen subway lines and 14 bus routes converge on 14th Street, and so does the PATH line.</p>
        <p>While there remain plenty of small and medium-sized buildings in the area, it is large complexes that have more dramatically changed its flavor.</p>
        <p>Probably the most visible example is the Related Companies' building at 1 Union Square South. Situated between Broadway and Fourth Avenue across from Union Square Park and made distinctive by its giant steam-puffing sculpture, the building houses 240 apartments, a Virgin Megastore,  a Circuit City Superstore and a 14-screen movie theater.</p>
        <p>''That development with its mix of retail and residential has been a cornerstone of the revitalization of the area,'' said Mr. Gmach, the BID executive.</p>
        <p>Another landmark on Union Square but one whose future seems unsure is the former Mays store, now occupied by a Bradlees. The Bradlees discount chain, which has declared bankruptcy, sold its lease back to the landlord, Vornado Realty, but obtained an agreement allowing it to remain in the building until March 2002. Wendi Kopsick, a spokeswoman for Vornado, would not comment on plans beyond that date.</p>
        <p>But 14th Street is not only a commercial thoroughfare. With 100,000 students enrolled at N.Y.U., the New School University, Pratt Institute, Baruch College, Cooper Union and Cardozo Law School, all near 14th Street, it is an academic hub. ''That's bigger than Ohio State and Notre Dame combined,'' said Jeffrey Roseman, the executive vice president of Newmark New Spectrum Retail, which is leasing and marketing several projects in the area.</p>
        <p>Two years ago, N.Y.U. put up a $55 million dormitory on the old Luchow's site between Third and Fourth Avenues, to accommodate 600 students, and now it is building another dormitory for 1,000 students two doors away. This dorm, on the site of the former Palladium, will cost $120 million. The dorms flank P. C. Richards, one of the first chain stores to venture as far east as Third Avenue. At the back of the buildings, the Genesis Robert F. Kennedy Apartments, a complex of 94 apartments on 13th Street for formerly homeless and low-income people, offers on-site social services. ''This shows the neighborhood will continue to have a diverse population,'' Mr. Gmach said.</p>
        <p>LYNNE P. BROWN, the associate vice president for government and community relations at N.Y.U., said: ''Twenty years ago with the problems in Union Square Park that drove everything else out, we wouldn't have considered putting students there. Now we are happy to be part of the mix not only out of self-interest, which means finding a congenial area for students, but we also like to think we're helping to move it one more step to its renaissance.''</p>
        <p>Pratt Institute has bought seven stories in a converted factory at 142-144 West 14th Street because it has outgrown its space in the Puck Building in SoHo. Administrators and trustees of Pratt, whose main campus is in Brooklyn, spent two years scouring Lower Manhattan for a new site before choosing the one on 14th Street.</p>
        <p>''It had about 80,000 square feet, it was in a superb location in regard to transportation, and it is in an area with a number of educational institutions with whom we interact,'' said Thomas F. Schutte, the president of Pratt. ''We felt there was a buzz here, and we are just plain excited about it.''</p>
        <p>The street is also home to several major medical institutions, including the Beth Israel Medical Center's Phillips Ambulatory Care Center; the Elizabeth Seton Childbearing Center, which is affiliated with St. Vincent's Hospital and Medical Center; and New York Eye and Ear Infirmary.</p>
        <p>One stretch that has been spruced up without losing its Old World charm is the tree-lined block between Second and Third  Avenues, which has a variety of small shops and restaurants ranging from Jamaican to Filipino to Mexican.</p>
        <p>''This block was one of the worst blocks and one of the last to change,'' said Daphne Mahoney, the owner of Daphne's Caribbean Express, known for its Jamaican meat patties. ''There are more people working in the block, more security guards and more sanitation. And it is great to see N.Y.U. moving in here. I cater their students' end-of-exam parties.''</p>
        <p>John F. Mazzola opened a restaurant that bears his nickname, Johnny Mozzarella, four months ago. ''I saw this was an up-and-coming area, but they needed a little Italian flair,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Sprinkled from one end of the street to the other is a growing residential population, ranging from artists, who populated lofts in meatpacking buildings for years, to families and elderly people in Stuyvesant Town, whose southern border is 14th Street. In between are the renters and buyers in larger, sometimes more luxurious buildings.</p>
        <p>Though it is residential conversions like the one in the stately landmark Bank Building at Eighth Avenue and 14th Street that are getting most of the attention, ''not every development is a luxury condo,'' Mr. Gmach said, ''and we now have buildings available that have never before been utilized as residential buildings.''</p>
        <p>In some of those, rents remain reasonable, but more often than not, they are escalating. For example, Charles Blaichman, a developer and builder, bought three rather nondescript mixed-use buildings at 18 and 20 East 14th Street and at 60 West 14th in a package deal for $7 million three years ago. He has turned the two buildings on East 14th into 62 apartments, ranging in size from 500-square-foot studios to 900-square-foot two-bedroom units for which he is charging $1,750 to $5,000 a month. He is now converting the West 14th building, which will have 65 apartments at comparable rents.</p>
        <p>''I saw a real shortage of rental apartments downtown, so I never thought of selling condos or lofts,'' he said. ''We rented very quickly, and we think there is still a big demand. They are well located, and things will only get better.''</p>
        <p>Whatever prosperity is to be found in the rental market is more than matched in the sales arena.</p>
        <p>At the Greenwich, the former store at 14th Street and the Avenue of the Americas,  where finished but unpartitioned lofts ranging in size from 766 square feet to 3,100 square feet are under construction, contracts have been signed for 69 of the 79 units. Prices range from $465,000 for the one studio in the building to $3.425 million for a penthouse with a giant terrace.</p>
        <p>The average price per square foot is $692, and buyers have the option to configure rooms with their own architects or, for additional fees, to leave that to the building's designers, Franke Gottsegen Cox Architects in Manhattan. Many buyers have purchased more than one loft, including one who bought the entire seventh floor, said Michele Conte of Brown Harris Stevens, the building's director of sales.</p>
        <p>Ms. Conte described her job as ''having to guess what will sell two to three years ahead.'' ''We have known for several years that a lot of uptown people would be moving downtown,'' she added.</p>
        <p>Asked why buyers were willing to give up park or river vistas for views of the traffic on 14th Street, she said, ''It is the lifestyle, the vibrancy of the street, the youthfulness, the creative electricity in the air,'' she added.</p>
        <p>''The people who are buying are, by and large, new money, but they are people with a very down-to-earth attitude,'' she said.  ''They don't wear three-piece suits but jeans to work, and 80 percent of them are between 30 and 35 years old. This is smart money. It is not out to flash.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, Mr. Brooks, 44, the chief human resources officer for WPP, the marketing and communications conglomerate, who has lived in the Beresford for three years, said: ''I am not leaving because of the building but because I concluded that I really want to live downtown. This is mostly about my perception that the old East Side-West Side divide in New York in terms of defining neighborhood characteristics is disappearing and is being replaced by an uptown-downtown dichotomy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Solomon, who owns a moving and storage company, bought an apartment in the Greenwich for his son in October. Happily ensconced at Third Avenue and 80th Street after moving to the city from Great Neck, N.Y., he had no thought of uprooting himself again.</p>
        <p>T HEN I began to think it's time to move,'' he said. ''The East Side is very homogenous. If you've eaten in one Italian restaurant, you've eaten in them all.''</p>
        <p>Now he and his wife, Suzette, will move into a 2,661-square-foot penthouse loft at the Greenwich with a 2,057-square-foot terrace. ''In our previous apartment I felt that though we lived in the city, we hadn't really moved in,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Still, not everyone with ties to 14th Street views its evolution with unmitigated glee. Marcia Garcia-Starkey, a co-chairwoman of the 14th Street Special Committee that represents two community boards, worries that diversity will be engulfed by a tidal wave of chic.</p>
        <p>''We don't want to turn 14th Street into an urban mall,'' she said, citing the loss of Dizzy Izzy's, a bagel store across the street from Markt, the Belgian bistro of the moment. ''He was there for at least 20 years, but he couldn't afford the rent when the lease ran out,'' she said. ''Dizzy Izzy's was a place where transgendered people gathered. When neighborhoods become upscale like Chelsea has, diversity goes out the window.''</p>
        <p>''At the corner of Seventh Avenue, there is a Cuban restaurant where you can get rice and beans, chicken or pork for $5,'' she continued. ''Those are the kind of things that could disappear, and we don't want to see a 'white bread' 14th Street.''</p>
