        <p>(Editors' choices of other recent books of particular interest)</p>
        <p>THE QUESTION OF BRUNO, by Aleksandar Hemon. (Nan A. Talese/ Doubleday, $22.95.) Mostly fictional (but who can say for sure?) stories and a novella, invoking both the terrible facts of Bosnia and Yugoslavia and the years of the author's childhood, when there was yet hope for both.</p>
        <p>SUNNYVALE: The Rise and Fall of a Silicon Valley Family, by Jeff Goodell. (Villard, $24.95.) A memoir of disintegration under the stresses of noncommunication, divorce and dumb decisions even while living in Sunnyvale, the ground zero of West Coast optimism.</p>
        <p>FREUD'S ''MEGALOMANIA,'' by Israel Rosenfield. (Norton, $21.95.) The author provides a fictional past and a fictional last book for Freud in this wonderfully ingenious novel that evokes Freud's ambition as well as his self-deception.</p>
        <p>THE CHIEF: The Life of William Randolph Hearst, by David Nasaw. (Houghton Mifflin, $35.) An absorbing, scholarly biography showing Hearst as a larger, more talented, more generous and less dangerous figure than looms (with the help of Orson Welles and ''Citizen Kane'') in legend.</p>
        <p>DRIVING MR. ALBERT: A Trip Across America With Einstein's Brain, by Michael Paterniti. (Dial, $18.95.) A journalist and the pathologist who acquired Einstein's brain in 1955 take off with it, but with no clear idea what to do with it; then they keep going for quite a while.</p>
        <p>MILLIONAIRE: The Philanderer, Gambler, and Duelist Who Invented Modern Finance, by Janet Gleeson. (Simon &amp; Schuster, $24.) A life of John Law, the 18th-century playboy who showed Frenchmen that a piece of paper entitling its bearer to money was itself money, and who organized a speculative corporation that collapsed instead of settling the Mississippi Valley.</p>
        <p>ROADS: Driving America's Great Highways, by Larry McMurtry. (Simon &amp; Schuster, $25.) This door sparingly opened on the private life of the author of 22 novels is an occasion for reminiscence and commentary on whatever pops up in the windows or in his mind as he crisscrosses the country: enigmatic glances at the Western past, salutes to hundreds of literary and historical figures.</p>
        <p>MOUNTAIN CITY, by Gregory Martin. (North Point/Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $21.) Half elegy,</p>
