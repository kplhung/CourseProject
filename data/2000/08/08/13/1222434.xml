        <p>''America in the World'' (editorial, Aug. 7), in urging debate on how the country assesses its national interests in today's changed international arena, accurately cites some of those interests: ensuring our defense, reducing nuclear weapons, keeping channels of commerce open, encouraging democracy and the rule of law, and protecting health and the environment.</p>
        <p>The furtherance of those interests abroad rests on effective intelligence, a well-equipped and trained military force and patient but energetic diplomacy. Yet diplomacy is not mentioned in your editorial.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''America in the World'' (editorial, Aug. 7), in urging debate on how the country assesses its national interests in today's changed international arena, accurately cites some of those interests: ensuring our defense, reducing nuclear weapons, keeping channels of commerce open, encouraging democracy and the rule of law, and protecting health and the environment.</p>
        <p>The furtherance of those interests abroad rests on effective intelligence, a well-equipped and trained military force and patient but energetic diplomacy. Yet diplomacy is not mentioned in your editorial.</p>
        <p>The national debate you rightly urge must include the role of diplomacy -- including the regrettable state of affairs where financing for foreign affairs has been cut by 30 percent in real terms since the mid-1980's, to the point where today only one penny of every dollar in the federal budget goes to the crucial, preventive role diplomacy can play before the use of force becomes relevant.</p>
        <p>BRUCE LAINGEN  Washington, Aug. 9, 2000</p>
        <p>The writer is president of the American Academy of Diplomacy.</p>
