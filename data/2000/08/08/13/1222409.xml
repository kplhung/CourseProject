        <p>They can't find the flaw in the design or the materials or the manufacturing process, but the makers of Firestone tires say some of their products are falling apart on the highway. As a result, they are recalling 6.5 million tires used on Ford S.U.V.'s and a variety of other pickups with 15-inch wheels.</p>
        <p>The Bridgestone/Firestone company promises to replace them all -- but only by next summer, a delay that has angered consumers and politicians. Experts say, however, that the company just doesn't have enough tires to go around. So while the federal government investigates 46 deaths and 80 injuries that may have come from the tires, vehicle owners may wait for nearly a year for replacements.</p>
