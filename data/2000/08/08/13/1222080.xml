      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>THE name Hot Tomato's is almost the antithesis of the place in which this year-old New Haven restaurant is situated. The very name suggests casual and contemporary, yet the main dining room, reached by a dramatic winding staircase, is the epitome of elegance. It is the original (1912) formal dining room of the attached Taft Hotel (now residential only), and has been dazzlingly refurbished, with its ornate columns, bas-relief plasterwork and high coffered ceilings restored to their original beauty.</p>
        <p>Yet Hot Tomato's has made this splendid many-windowed room its own, mostly through a stimulating menu that is thoroughly grounded in contemporary trends, with decisive Italian and Asian emphases.</p>

        <p>THE name Hot Tomato's is almost the antithesis of the place in which this year-old New Haven restaurant is situated. The very name suggests casual and contemporary, yet the main dining room, reached by a dramatic winding staircase, is the epitome of elegance. It is the original (1912) formal dining room of the attached Taft Hotel (now residential only), and has been dazzlingly refurbished, with its ornate columns, bas-relief plasterwork and high coffered ceilings restored to their original beauty.</p>
        <p>Yet Hot Tomato's has made this splendid many-windowed room its own, mostly through a stimulating menu that is thoroughly grounded in contemporary trends, with decisive Italian and Asian emphases.</p>
        <p>There was no Japanese chef visible in the open kitchen below, but the tuna-maki tempura was sushi perfect. The tempura touch came in a light, crunchy tempura-like crust that covered the edge of the rolls. A crispy carroty slaw, slivers of pink ginger, a wasabi emulsion and soy dip completed this appealing appetizer, setting the tone for our eclectic dinner.</p>
        <p>Another success story was pasta pillows, large house-made ravioli stuffed with sweet potatoes in a sage cream sauce with a peppy edge.</p>
        <p>Also gratifying was a starter called crab hot and cold. Hot was a crisp pan-fried cake of Maine crab meat, while cold was a loose salad of Maryland jumbo lump crab with capers. Remoulade, sprinkled with black sesame seeds, provided a zesty accent to both hot and cold.</p>
        <p>Less rewarding was artichoke terrine. We must confess to a bias here, as few vegetable terrines live up to our expectations. This one was no exception, lacking cohesion and flavor. Smoked mozzarella and roasted portobello mushrooms were layered on a slice of grilled bruschetta with a cascade of chopped tomatoes and pieces of artichoke heart scattered about the plate.</p>
        <p>Pleasing to eyes and palate was an inventive entree dubbed salmon osso buco -- pan-seared salmon steak in whose center was a single sea scallop, suggesting the marrow of osso buco. The dish was cooked and served in a lobster broth, along with garlic-mashed potatoes.</p>
        <p>Another continent was heard from in pork tenderloin Brazileiro: chunks of grilled pork in a piquant churrasco salsa. The mildly spiced salsa enlivened the slightly dry pork. Dominating the plate was a huge, lightly browned cake of starchy herbed yucca, a natural choice in a South American dish.</p>
        <p>Pasta verdure was a vegetarian delight, a grilled vegetable medley with curlicue cavatappi pasta in a charred plum tomato sauce. Bare seared ahi tuna sounded inviting: a pan-seared center cut of ahi tuna, served with a crisp-crunchy carrot-laden spring roll came with swirls of wasabi emulsion. The fish was well done, as requested by our guest, which made it overcooked for us, but not the kitchen's fault.</p>
        <p>Dessert time brought us a cool, satiny, palate-refreshing panna cotta (an Italian custard-like pudding), decorated with fresh berries; chocolate marquise (two small shingles of rich chocolate in a creme anglaise adorned with fresh raspberries); and a plate of biscotti, cookies and truffles, all appealing finales. Even the double dip brulee (an unlikely twosome of chocolate and peanut butter layers over creme brulee) was winsome. But the spotlight was captured by a super-size plate with a round banana cake in the center, coconut ice cream on top, and a border of rich chocolate sauce. Decorative touches were two deep-fried banana slices, cut lengthwise. Spectacular to see, too much to eat.</p>
        <p>A three-course dinner for two came to a fairly priced $67, before tax, tip and drinks. A wine list, mostly from Italy, with a sprinkling from California, Australia and Connecticut, begins at $21. Reservas from Tuscany ($50 to $300 a bottle) and Piedmont ($80 to $695) are also featured.</p>
        <p>Beers include 13 on draft, domestic microbrews and imported.</p>
        <p>Hot Tomato's  261 College Street, New Haven (203) 624-6331</p>
