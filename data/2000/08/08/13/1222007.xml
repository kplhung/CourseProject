        <p>IT'S not as if we had a secret hankering for cholesterol. But, often as not, like Mount Everest -- and in more ways than one -- it was simply there. I'm talking, of course, about the Full English Breakfast.</p>
        <p>My brother, David, and I had chosen to vacation with our youngest children in the Lake District, retracing youthful footsteps in places where the very mention of our boyhood escapades (''See that rock face? Well, we climbed that,'' etc.) produced either knowing exchanges of rolled eyes between our offspring or -- yet more of a put-down -- a studious page-turning in their undeclared competition to be first to finish the latest Harry Potter.</p>
        <p>And, much to the relief of my youngest daughter, Rebecca, 12, and nephew Ted, 11, we had chosen accommodations from a guide to Britain's best bed-and-breakfast establishments rather than the faux-nostalgia of flapping canvas and off-putting sanitary arrangements associated with a camping holiday.</p>
        <p>Very quickly we discovered that things had moved on in the B &amp; B world, at least in the places listed in our guidebook, and at least when judged by distant memories of impromptu overnight halts with our own parents. En suite bathrooms had become de rigueur -- a marked departure from the days of chilly expeditions across unfamiliar corridors in quest of the facilities. Residents' lounges and television sets, too, were no longer unusual. Some places even offered evening meals and wine lists, with reservations and maps available on the Internet.</p>
        <p>But one thing had not changed: the idea that the day cannot be started adequately without the ingestion of mountains of food. And not just any food. This being the northwest of England, the usual attributes of a Full English -- fried bacon, fried eggs, fried mushrooms, fried tomatoes -- were complemented by chunks of Cumberland sausage (a spicier, meatier variant on the less muscular southern sausage) or black pudding, a close relative of the German Blutwurst, or blood sausage. Fried bread and baked beans were offered as optional extras for those craving just that extra little something to titillate the palate. Cereals were mere hors d'oeuvres. Buttered toast and jam provided a kind of dessert.</p>
        <p>Far more than breakfast in a New York diner with its pick-and-mix perils of hash browns and muffins and eggs over easy, the Full English comes as a complete package. Like a cigarette pack, it should be served with the equivalent of a surgeon general's  warning: this breakfast will damage your relationship with the bathroom scales, at the very least. As Nancy Reagan counseled, we could have said no. But the remarkable thing was that we didn't, and neither did any of the other guests we greeted as they came to grips -- sometimes with a furtive delight, like children at a midnight feast -- with this most British of offerings. Somehow, the dietary prescriptions, the regime of juice and muesli and herbal tea, all fell away. Somehow, the slightly forced oohs and aahs and I'll-never-eat-all-of-its that greeted the arrival of each serving gave way to determined assaults and plates wiped clean.</p>
        <p>And the most remarkable thing of all is that this meal, this sceptered dish, this Full English bears no relation at all to what most people in England eat for breakfast. Its title is a marketing device, an extension of the branding of England that seeks to persuade visitors that the English are all ruddy-cheeked, tweed-clad, hearty types who live in Tudor cottages and sometimes dress in  bizarre but colorful medieval uniforms. Its basic assumption is that England is still a rural country where chicken and pigs are reared to provide sustenance for bucolic yeomen.</p>
        <p>IN the frenzy of modern England, particularly in the driven southeast around London, very few people have the time or the inclination to gird themselves with skillet and cooking oil to prepare breakfast even as they shower, scan their stock prices, recharge their  cell phones and brace for the subway. Increasingly, breakfast-time eateries (with some notable exceptions) are far more likely to offer lattes and cappuccinos and croissants than mugs of sweet, milky tea and latherings of dubious pork products.</p>
        <p>And yet, in B &amp; Bs and hotels across the land, the Full English endures. Why? Not simply because it's there, as the mountaineer George Leigh Mallory said of Mount Everest. But because it wasn't always there for everybody.</p>
        <p>Consider, for instance, that Britain's baby boomers grew up in the shadow of food-rationing after the Second World War, when eggs and bacon were prized rarities. Their forebears lived through two world wars and the intervening depression. In Victorian times, particularly in the industrial north, the Full English might have been served from the chafing dishes in the toffs' dining room, along with grilled kidneys, kippers and kedgeree, but for the toiling masses, bread and lard was a more likely breakfast.</p>
        <p>There is, of course, something faintly decadent about sitting down to a meal that may well be completely unnecessary. But the Full English is so quintessentially English because of its association of prosperity with plenty: eat at any roadside pub or restaurant in middle England and you soon discover that the size of the serving really does matter, and not just at breakfast.</p>
        <p>It is inconceivable that, say, an Italian breakfaster (with the same distant memories of wartime hardship) would gorge on extra cornetti when one cornetto (croissant) suffices, grazie. Yet, on the way back from the Lake District, when we rewarded our children for tolerating our recherche du temps perdu with a visit to the huge amusement park called Alton Towers, the meals on offer along the byways of the English Midlands included chicken tikka masala with fries, lasagne verde with fries and pizza Margherita with -- yes -- fries.</p>
        <p>Of course, there is only so much anthropology to be squeezed from a breakfast, however Full or English it may be.</p>
        <p>In the Lake District, surrounded by soaring crags and distant, rugged peaks, it was easy enough to justify the excess: after all, we had hills to climb, streams to ford, memories to recount, B &amp; Bs to reach before nightfall. We would need solid fare to sustain us.</p>
        <p>But as we checked into our last B &amp; B  before the amusement park in the Midlands, the owner ventured that, considering the vertiginous rides ahead of us, we might prefer a lighter breakfast -- a half-English, or quarter-English even: toast and tea, fruit juice and cereal. We assented with something like relief -- and perhaps a premonition that end-of-vacation reality was about to reclaim us to a more frugal world.</p>
