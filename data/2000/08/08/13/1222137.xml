        <p>AFTER a run in with police officers last month, Anthony Barnes, a Yonkers teenager, was tried by a jury of his peers and then offered a plea bargain.</p>
        <p>Yes, Anthony could go to the Yankees game, but only if he did 500 push-ups that day and then served dinner to the 14 other teenagers attending a special summer camp at Manhattanville College in Purchase.</p>
        <p>Anthony's offenses were not serious. He had lost his temper and got into some arguments with fellow campers and with some police officers serving as counselors for a summer police cadet program, a four-week camp created by the Westchester Police Chiefs Association and the Westchester Coalition Against Bigotry to improve relations between disadvantaged teens and the police.</p>
        <p>The goal of the camp, which had its graduation on Aug. 4, was to create for campers greater awareness of a police officer's job and to help build a more positive relationship between officers and minority youth.</p>
        <p>The campers -- mostly blacks and Hispanics between 12 and 14 -- were selected through local government and community groups in the county's less affluent neighborhoods. They stayed overnight during the week in college dorms and went home on weekends. The camp was run with boot-camp discipline. Failure to cooperate brought swift punishments, like 50 push-ups, or dining hall assignments. Anthony's punishment, for example, was discussed by campers and officers.</p>
        <p>The camp, in its first year, was run by officers from the Westchester County Police Department as well as departments in Harrison, Dobbs Ferry and Tuckahoe. Each department sent volunteer officers, who picked up campers in squad cars each Monday morning and dropped them off Friday evening.</p>
        <p>Officers were at the camp from the 7 a.m. roll call until lights out at 10. Instead of gun belts and uniforms, they wore, like the campers, a different color T-shirt each day (always neatly tucked in, or more push-ups). The teens played sports with the officers and called them by their first names.</p>
        <p>''We wanted them to see that cops are good people who do all sorts of things, not just make arrests,'' said Ed Gerrity, director of security for Manhattanville College.</p>
        <p>At first, some campers had icy attitudes toward the officers and toward other campers, but they were soon treating everyone at the camp as teammates.</p>
        <p>''Most of these kids are likely to have some kind of confrontations with police in their lives,'' said Sgt. Peter DeVittario of the Harrison Police Department, ''so we wanted to break down barriers and walls so they'd realize we are people, and that not all cops are bad.''</p>
        <p>The officers, he added, also encountered a problem at the camp similar to one they face on the street.</p>
        <p>''We had to keep discipline and still let them see us as people,'' said Sergeant DeVittario. ''The hope is that when they go home, they'll explain to their friends some of the things they learned about police.''</p>
        <p>The goal, he said, was to teach discipline and teamwork. Each camper kept a journal, had his own room keys and I.D. card and washed his own clothes.</p>
        <p>Most mornings the campers took courses in different aspects of law enforcement, including classes that certified them to do CPR. Most afternoons, the officers took campers off campus to observe different law enforcement programs, including the Harrison courts, New York City's Police Academy and a ''scared straight'' lecture at the Sullivan County prison.</p>
        <p>The group's favorite presentation was by Customs officials, who demonstrated their canine unit and took campers on a boat trip up the Hudson  River to Sing Sing Prison.</p>
        <p>Richard Berman, president of Manhattanville College, said he offered the college campus as a site and roughly $20,000 after sensing unrest among his students over recent racial issues, including controversial shootings of black men by New York City police officers.</p>
        <p>Lt. Kevin Reeves of the Westchester Police Department, who helped organize the camp curriculum, said that the campers developed self-esteem, independence and responsibility for their own lives.</p>
        <p>''We always gave them the option of dropping out and going back home,'' he said. ''Not one did. In fact, most admitted that on the weekends, they were dying to come back.''</p>
        <p>One such camper was J'naire Rogers from Harlem. J'naire, 14, had long heard the talk in her neighborhood that the police arbitrarily hassled people and often forced their way into homes for no reason. She never saw this, she said, but the camp had made her attitude toward it more skeptical.</p>
        <p>''I didn't know any police officers,'' she said, ''so I believed anything I heard.''</p>
        <p>And Shalain Garcia, who recently moved from Tukahoe to Queens, said she had also changed her opinion of police officers.</p>
        <p>''I underestimated them,'' she said. ''I thought they sit around and drink coffee and eat donuts and had boring jobs. But now I know different.''</p>
        <p>The police said they hoped some campers would consider becoming police officers. Few campers said they would, but most admitted their feelings had changed drastically toward the police.</p>
        <p>Al Brown, 14, of Mount Vernon said he learned to have greater respect for the police. But he'd still rather play professional basketball.</p>
        <p>''I'm gonna play for the Sacramento Kings,'' he said.</p>
