        <p>Patricia Brooks has touched upon a much bigger issue than our personal comfort in her article on noisy restaurants (''To Din or Not to Din: Restaurateur's Call,'' July 16). After all, most of us can exercise our free choice and simply stay away from an establishment that assails our ears with loud music or provides reverberant conditions that make conversation unintelligible.</p>
        <p>Those who willingly accept these symptoms as a condition for eating out may not be fully aware of the distress suffered by persons with a hearing disability in poor acoustical environments. In shopping malls, for example, architectural features such as high ceilings and glass walls can create reverberant conditions that make public address announcements so distorted as to be useless in the event of a fire or a bomb threat.  Railroad stations are often so bad that we accept an unintelligible announcement as part of the scene.</p>

        <p>Patricia Brooks has touched upon a much bigger issue than our personal comfort in her article on noisy restaurants (''To Din or Not to Din: Restaurateur's Call,'' July 16). After all, most of us can exercise our free choice and simply stay away from an establishment that assails our ears with loud music or provides reverberant conditions that make conversation unintelligible.</p>
        <p>Those who willingly accept these symptoms as a condition for eating out may not be fully aware of the distress suffered by persons with a hearing disability in poor acoustical environments. In shopping malls, for example, architectural features such as high ceilings and glass walls can create reverberant conditions that make public address announcements so distorted as to be useless in the event of a fire or a bomb threat.  Railroad stations are often so bad that we accept an unintelligible announcement as part of the scene.</p>
        <p>The greatest concern, and the one now receiving some attention from the federal Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board, is the condition of the classrooms in our public schools. The Board is moving slowly toward the implementation of acoustical standards for all learning spaces. Ignorance and budget limitations, however, are still likely to leave many children, including those with auditory, learning or behavioral problems, to struggle in hostile acoustical environments that may still exist in some older schools. All of us should be able to fully enjoy a dining experience. Without question, however, improving the learning environment in our nation's schools must continue to be regarded as an even higher priority.</p>
        <p>DAVID COLLINGS  Trumbull</p>
        <p>The writer is an independent noise control engineer and a member of a national group developing a standard for classroom acoustics.</p>
