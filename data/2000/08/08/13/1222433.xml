        <p>A black police officers' group that often criticizes the Police Department is calling the agency's second multimillion-dollar recruiting campaign in two years ''a fiasco,'' suggesting that like the earlier effort, it would do little to draw more minority officers to the force.</p>
        <p>Lt. Eric Adams, the president of the group, 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement Who Care, said yesterday that the $10 million program unveiled last week failed to address the concerns of minority groups.</p>
        <p>In minority neighborhoods, he said, the police are often associated with incidents like the fatal shooting in March of Patrick M. Dorismond or the assault on Abner Louima in 1997.</p>
        <p>The campaign is made up of print advertisements that feature personal stories about police officers told from the perspective of people who know them. The ads are meant to portray the more compassionate side of policing.</p>
        <p>''It looks better in communities who don't have ill feelings towards the Police Department,'' Lieutenant Adams said. ''We have a problem recruiting individuals who are thinking about Patrick Dorismond, who are thinking about Abner Louima.''</p>
        <p>Lieutenant Adams said the department needed to use the same strategies for recruiting that it used for fighting crime, like holding commanders responsible for the number of qualified people they have recruited.</p>
        <p>He said he thought the best way to persuade qualified minorities to join the force was for officers with credibility in those communities to talk to people in their own neighborhoods.</p>
        <p>''You have to go in there, as in any strategic operation, and speak one on one,'' he said. ''You have to stop on the basketball court and talk to the young men that are on the court and be willing to take the criticism from them, be willing to hear them say, 'Well, you're a sellout,' '' Lieutenant Adams said.</p>
        <p>Deputy Chief Thomas P. Fahey said Lieutenant Adams's statement that the department did not recruit in minority neighborhoods is ''patently untrue.'' The department has been trying diligently to attract minority officers, he said.</p>
        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani also rejected criticism of the campaign. ''These are good ads,'' he said. ''They try to encourage people to be police officers.''</p>
        <p>Lieutenant Adams also criticized the department over one of the officers profiled in the new ads.</p>
        <p>The officer, Sgt. Richard Romano, supervised the buy-and-bust narcotics team involved in the Dorismond shooting. Although Sergeant Romano rode in a backup van, he was not directly involved and has not been accused of any wrongdoing.</p>
        <p>The officer who shot Mr. Dorismond was cleared after an investigation by the Manhattan district attorney.</p>
        <p>But Lieutenant Adams said the selection of an officer linked in any way to the Dorismond shooting showed that the department was insensitive to the concerns of blacks.</p>
        <p>Sergeant Romano, who was chosen for the ad partly because his brother is the actor Ray Romano, the star of the CBS-TV comedy ''Everybody Loves Raymond,'' who also appears in the ad, was already the focus of some controversy.</p>
        <p>Minutes after a news conference on Thursday to announce the campaign, Sergeant Romano said he was retiring from the force because ''monetarily, it doesn't really pay right now'' and he had reached ''his breaking point.''</p>
        <p>The criticism of Sergeant Romano's selection was ''the worst kind of slander,'' said Mayor Giuliani. ''I might remind everyone that even the police officers involved in the actual incident have been cleared by a grand jury.''</p>
