      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The cave is washed in candlelight and the grown-ups are padding around in slippers, but Baby Bear is wide awake. Grandma Bear confidently plops into a rocker with the baby, sings a little song -- and nods off. So Grandpa takes the baby to a window and croons a lullaby. No luck. Mama steps in, but not even her song can get Baby Bear dozing.</p>
        <p>So far, so familiar. At this point, jaded parents may find themselves pinching the remaining pages, silently calculating how long it will take Papa Bear to work his soporific magic so they can go downstairs and finish loading the dishwasher. But this is where Kate McMullan and Jim McMullan's PAPA'S SONG (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $15; ages 3 to 7), a sweet and touching picture book, gets interesting. The bear's cave looks out on a river. The family has a little wooden boat with a covered bow, into which Papa Bear tucks his blanket-wrapped child before pushing out onto the slow, dark water. Leaning into his pole in his flannel shirt and overalls, he seems ready to break into ''Moon River,'' or maybe a show tune.</p>

        <p>So far, so familiar. At this point, jaded parents may find themselves pinching the remaining pages, silently calculating how long it will take Papa Bear to work his soporific magic so they can go downstairs and finish loading the dishwasher. But this is where Kate McMullan and Jim McMullan's PAPA'S SONG (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $15; ages 3 to 7), a sweet and touching picture book, gets interesting. The bear's cave looks out on a river. The family has a little wooden boat with a covered bow, into which Papa Bear tucks his blanket-wrapped child before pushing out onto the slow, dark water. Leaning into his pole in his flannel shirt and overalls, he seems ready to break into ''Moon River,'' or maybe a show tune.</p>
        <p>But Papa Bear doesn't say a word.</p>
        <p>''Riffles slap the side of the bear boat, slup, slup, slup. Three little fish wriggle by and disappear beneath the water, bloop, bloop, blip. A frog croaks, CHUG-A-RUM! CHUG-A-RUM! A faraway frog answers, chug-a-rum! chug-a-rum!'' Father and baby make their silent way past splashing otters, a duck (''talking softly to itself, wack wack, wack wack''), a hooting owl and endlessly chirping crickets. Soon Papa brings his dozing babe home to a delighted but dumbfounded family. ''I knew the right song,'' he says.</p>
        <p>Kate McMullan's story of a loving father's inventive lullaby is perfectly served by the dreamy realism of the watercolors by her husband, Jim, whose Lincoln Center posters are so recognizable. The surpassing gentleness of Mr. McMullan's bear family is striking; these are no cartoon animals but hulking creatures, and his pictures richly detail their water-loving lives. The crib could have cradled Moses in the bulrushes. Baby Bear's sex is never mentioned, so parents who are weary of challenging the general assumption that protagonists in picture books are boys by default will be grateful to the McMullans for quietly helping them out. And parents weary of boring bedtime books will be grateful for this simple but refreshing tale.</p>
