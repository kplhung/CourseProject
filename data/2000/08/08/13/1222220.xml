        <p>It appears that my letter has been misinterpreted as suggesting that I am against preserving the environment. This is hardly the case. What I am against is government's habit of making itself larger at the expense of the taxpayer.</p>

        <p>It appears that my letter has been misinterpreted as suggesting that I am against preserving the environment. This is hardly the case. What I am against is government's habit of making itself larger at the expense of the taxpayer.</p>
        <p>I disagree that a moratorium is the proper way to preserve the environment.</p>
        <p>The Town of Oyster Bay has procedures in place to review each proposed project, and then the final say is the Town Board's. By enacting a moratorium the board would be saying that it cannot make a decision that its members are elected to make. We would then put everything on hold for a year so we can spend more of the taxpayers' money to hire consulting firms and more attorneys.</p>
        <p>I think we must keep it simple, have an application follow its due course and then let the Town Board have the final say. After all, that is what we are getting paid to do.</p>
