        <p>The tennis courts on Piers 13 and 14 below the South Street Seaport were to close in May, because the city, which owns the property, was hoping to redevelop it for other uses.</p>
        <p>But after inquiries from the Manhattan borough president's office and Community Board 1, the Economic Development Corporation, the landlord for the property, extended the lease on the courts to Michael Del Prete, who took over from the previous tenant, the New York Health and  Racquet Club.</p>
        <p>Tennis players were ecstatic.</p>
        <p>''Elation is not an overstatement,'' said Samuel P. Sporn, 69, a lawyer.  Mr. Sporn, an avid player, collected more than 300 petition signatures to save the courts.</p>
        <p>Mr. Del Prete, who owns several other courts in the Bronx, Queens and Brooklyn, has renovated the courts and renamed them the Wall Street Racquet Club. He is expected to sign a one-year lease, renewable for three years. He said he planned to improve programs for children.</p>
        <p>''We are going to give scholarships through E.D.C. on an as-needed-basis to children who can't afford to play,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Hourly rates for others will be $30 to $60 for members and about twice that for nonmembers. The city will get $20,000 a month in rent.</p>
        <p>Janel Patterson, a spokeswoman for the corporation, said the lease would include a 30-day cancellation notice.</p>
        <p>The 30-year-old courts were seen in Woody Allen's film ''Annie Hall.'' The city is still considering plans to replace the courts with a hotel or a Guggenheim museum designed by Frank Gehry.</p>
