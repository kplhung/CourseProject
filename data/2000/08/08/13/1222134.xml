        <p>SOME things down here refuse to change. In the 1980's, anticipating the completion of Route 55, speculators from the north bought 38 acres next to Roger Ruske's farm here, paying $2,800 an acre. The highway arrived, but not much else. Last year, Mr. Ruske bought the property -- for $1,100 an acre.</p>
        <p>If sprawl is New Jersey's most persistent blight, then the south of South Jersey is its last unscarred territory. Largely beyond the reach -- or consciousness -- of Philadelphia, and in no way commutable from New York or North Jersey, Cumberland and Salem Counties have a life apart from the rest of the state.</p>
        <p>These two counties contain 2.5 percent of New Jersey's population of eight million and about a quarter of its agricultural production, which was $800 million in 1998.  Between them they have three movie theaters, a dozen farm equipment dealers and not one Starbucks.</p>
        <p>The biggest private school is the Cumberland Christian School. Roadside churches have lawns full of cars on Sunday morning. Some families sell garden produce by setting it on a card table in the front yard and leaving a coffee can for payments.</p>
        <p>Most people want these things to stay this way. But everybody wants some other things to change:</p>
        <p>Both counties have fewer jobs than they did 10 years ago. Per-capita income is barely two-thirds of the statewide figure of $31,265 -- or about the level of Georgia's.</p>
        <p>While 25 percent of all adults in New Jersey are college graduates, the proportion in Salem and Cumberland is 10 to 12 percent.</p>
        <p>In the big city, the old manufacturing and farm-market center of Vineland, the main street is strung with nail salons and dollar stores. In the smaller cities -- Bridgeton, Salem, Penns Grove -- many buildings wear plywood and for-rent signs.</p>
        <p>The south seems to illustrate a principle of economic development: to be unspoiled is to be left behind. James W. Hughes, the dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy, said: ''It's a classic rural dilemma. What type of growth do you want?''</p>
        <p>Once, the growth was industrial. And to be sure, some industry is contemporary and prospering, especially in a band along the Delaware River from the DuPont laboratories in northern Salem County to the three nuclear power plants clustered in the south. But the glass industry has withered, and the canneries and textile factories are largely abandoned.</p>
        <p>In the last decade, not much has changed, including the population. From 1990 to 1998, according to census estimates, Salem County lost a few hundred residents, slipping to 64,912 from 65,294, and Cumberland County had gained a few thousand, to 140,341 from 138,053.</p>
        <p>People down here -- and they call it ''down here'' -- are always weighing the tradeoffs they make. As the glass and canning industries departed, the south welcomed prisons (Cumberland County has four) and nuclear plants and sent residents to casino jobs an hour or more away. The towns along the Delaware Bay are peaceful, untrammeled by urbanites in search of vacation homes -- and they are disturbingly poor. Agriculture is healthy, but as a tax base farms cannot compare with office buildings.</p>
        <p>In his office at Cumberland Nurseries, Mr. Ruske, for one, readily allowed that ''Cumberland County is the poorest county in the state; we're on the top of all the bad lists and at the bottom of all the good lists.''</p>
        <p>But he added: ''We are the richer part of the state, if you consider the quality of life. Do you want open spaces or million-dollar houses that you have in Monmouth County? We're left out, but I still think that's good.''</p>
        <p>In Shiloh, about three miles west of Bridgeton, where a few weathered stores cluster around a single blinking traffic light, Frank Noyes considered the problem from the counter of his auto repair shop, a business his father started in 1942. ''This area is probably as depressed as any area around, but it's a great place to live,'' Mr. Noyes said. ''I don't think in New Jersey you could find a better place.''</p>
        <p>In Fortescue, Shirley Fonash said the visitors to the tiny village on Delaware Bay and to her waterfront restaurant, the Charlesworth, came because ''they've heard we're a step back in time.''</p>
        <p>But her daughter, Cindy Fay, a computer programmer who lives in Vineland and waits tables on weekends, said she could stand to see Cumberland County's quaintness compromised by some four-lane highways. ''Why should we have to drive an hour, be it to Cherry Hill or Wilmington, to get a decent-paying technical position?'' Mrs. Fay asked. ''We are not just tomato pickers.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, if it seems that a local economy cannot thrive without an outbreak of office parks and mini-mansions, planners and economists say that is probably the case. The gap between north and south has been a fact for decades, if not centuries. But in the last 30 years, at least in terms of income, it has grown: In 1969, per-capita income was 28 percent higher in the five northeastern counties than in Salem and Cumberland; in 1997 it was 47 percent higher.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hughes of Rutgers said the disparity would most likely grow as the inner cities and truly rural areas were left farther behind. In the south, below what he calls ''the commutershed'' of Philadelphia, Mr. Hughes said, ''You're not going to get office development, and for manufacturing you don't have the highly skilled labor force you need.''</p>
        <p>Thomas Hamer, a professor of economics at Rowan University in Glassboro, said that ''at the risk of being one in favor of sprawl, to get development we've got to extend the sprawl into those two counties.</p>
        <p>''The only way to do that is pave a freeway,'' Professor Hamer said. ''Until that happens, they'll continue to be remote because of the transportation time and cost.''</p>
        <p>There are many people, especially in Salem County, who say they would rather be remote.</p>
        <p>John A. Kugler, a Salem County freeholder, said that when local officials convened four years ago to redraw the county's master plan, they intended to deflect development to I-295 and the turnpike and the nearby industrial band on the Delaware River -- and for the rest of the county to be left alone.</p>
        <p>On a drive through Aldine, just above the Cumberland County line, Mr. Kugler paused where the cows take their 250-yard daily walk down the main thoroughfare to the milking barns.</p>
        <p>Proceeding north into Gloucester County, he nodded toward a giant clot of town houses and scattered subdivisions looking raw on the treeless terrain.</p>
        <p>''This is what we're trying to avoid,'' he said. ''It's choking the school system.''</p>
        <p>And while Salem County has helped finance an industrial park and an office complex on I-295 that will employ thousands of workers, ''we don't want them to live here,'' Mr. Kugler said. ''We want them to come in from someplace in Pennsylvania.''</p>
        <p>So far, Salem County has had its wish: last year, a total of 144 new housing units were authorized by building permits. (Cumberland had 370; by contrast, Gloucester had 1,539, Burlington 2,933 and Ocean 4,155.)</p>
        <p>''The county is a real throwback,'' said Patricia DiMatteo Knobloch, the director of economic development. ''It hasn't stopped in time, but it's been able to preserve the best of what was in New Jersey. It's one of the few places where you can write a check without having to show the history of your life.''</p>
        <p>This is hardly a preserve of gentleman farmers. The county ranks 18th of the state's 21 in per-capita income, down from 13th 30 years ago. Prices for the main crops, soybeans and corn, have plunged. The city of Salem is poorer than Trenton or Asbury Park.</p>
        <p>Still, Salem County's unemployment rate is a respectable 3.8 percent, and it ranks near the top in average wage for nonfarm workers, thanks to high-paying jobs in the nuclear power plants on the river and in chemical manufacturing and research.</p>
        <p>''We don't have to be pro-development,'' Ms. Knobloch said. She added that the area's farmers, many from families who settled here 200 or 300 years ago, were unusually reluctant to sell; it took her 11 years to persuade one to part with a parcel for an industrial park at an interchange.</p>
        <p>If Ms. Knobloch is gingerly trying to find places for development, her counterpart in Cumberland County, Stephen Kehs, is simply trying to find development. ''We've got plenty of land around Millville and Vineland and Bridgeton,'' Mr. Kehs said. ''We have to be looking for new jobs. We've still got an unemployment rate of 7.2 percent.''</p>
        <p>That rate is a big improvement from the bleak 1980's, when unemployment approached 20 percent, but it is still by far the highest in New Jersey.</p>
        <p>The economic recovery in the 1990's saw more and more Cumberland County residents go to work in the four prisons, which now employ about 5,000 people, or one in 12 workers, and casinos in Atlantic City, employing about 2,000.</p>
        <p>Cumberland is celebrating its recent designation as a federal empowerment zone, giving the county millions of dollars in aid and enabling it to offer tax credits and other incentives to businesses. ''For better or worse,'' Mr. Kehs said, the county was eligible because the poverty rate exceeded 20 percent in parts of Vineland and Bridgeton.</p>
        <p>''Everybody leaves,'' said Shirley Spencer of Vineland, on a stroll with her husband, Cleo, at the Cumberland County Fair. Mrs. Spencer said of their six children, all of whom went to college, ''They couldn't stay in Vineland because there's nothing for them.''</p>
        <p>''One of my daughters graduated from law school, and for all the places she looked for work here, she couldn't find anything.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Spencer said she suspected something more than economic stagnation -- ''in my opinion it was because she was black and she was a woman'' -- but she also doubted that Vineland would ever recover.</p>
        <p>''When the plants were open, everybody was working,'' said Mrs. Spencer, who retired as a cook in the public schools. ''Now, there are so many people without jobs and no transportation to get people to where they are.''</p>
        <p>Many of those who manage to stay have been buffeted.</p>
        <p>''If you want a good job, you've got to travel an hour, an hour and a half,'' said Ira Morris, a boat builder at Silverton Marine Corporation in Millville. For a while, Mr. Morris had to commute to Atlantic County for a job, almost two hours each way.</p>
        <p>Sean Tomlin is trying to stay here, too, starting his own Web-design business, Loaded Media, in a commercial building on High Street in downtown Millville. At 24, Mr. Tomlin has already ridden the employment seesaw in his hometown, which is always seeing jobs come and go.</p>
        <p>His employer, until it laid off most of its staff last winter, was Camanco Communications, an ambitious start-up that provided Internet access to computers in hotel rooms. Mr. Tomlin said about 250 people lost their jobs, including many people who had relocated from as far away as Nebraska and California.</p>
        <p>''It was great,'' Mr. Tomlin said as he took a break on a July afternoon when High Street was looking tidy but ghostly. ''Stock options, competitive pay. There were some very talented people working there. That's what I miss the most.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kehs hopes the county can draw some more information-technology employers, but he also wants ware housing, food processing and other industries that can absorb what he calls the ''hard-to-reach remnant'' of the work force stranded when the glass and textile factories closed.</p>
        <p>And in that market, the competition is not New York or Bergen County but the south. ''We're beginning to market our part of the state as an alternative to the Carolinas,'' Mr. Kehs said. ''We have the same kinds of affordable land, labor and economic opportunities.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kehs can also advertise one advantage unknown in the rest of New Jersey: affordable housing. Last year, the National Association of Home Builders named the Vineland-Millville-Bridgeton area the nation's 11th most affordable market, a measure comparing home prices and median income.</p>
        <p>And while local governments chase ratables, the lag in development is good for agriculture, still crucial to the economy here. Wesley Kline, an agricultural agent for Cumberland County, said that ''if agriculture is going to survive in New Jersey, it's going to survive here in Cumberland County.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ruske, the nursery owner, agrees, even while he says the state's farmland preservation program is of little use to local growers because their development rights command so little. ''I've heard for the 35 years I've lived here that things are going to get better, and it hasn't,'' he said. ''Yet agriculture has gotten better.''</p>
        <p>''We don't have the impediment of housing,'' he said, ''and agriculture is important to the right people -- the freeholders, the planning boards.'' At the same time, he said, the growers here have become some of the most proficient and productive in the country.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ruske, who just stepped down as president of the state board of agriculture, is a third-generation nurseryman, having moved from Connecticut in 1967 in search of land that someone just out of college could afford. His is a family farm, in that his 31-year-old son, Chris, plans to take it over, but Mr. Ruske is impatient with the sentimental image of farm life.</p>
        <p>''Most people's picture of the family farm is 'American Gothic,' '' he said. ''It's subsistence farming. That's absolute nonsense.''</p>
        <p>His own sector of the agricultural economy is burgeoning along with the suburbs from Maine to Virginia; on his 275 acres are yews, holly and viburnum for the fresh landscapes of office parks and subdivisions. ''It's the right industry with the right product at the right time,'' he said, ''which is why we make money.''</p>
        <p>The farm lobby points out at every opportunity that New Jersey's farmland is the most expensive and highly taxed in the nation, and that dairy and grain farmers are under siege here, as everywhere. But the old-fashioned South Jersey family truck farm is getting along.</p>
        <p>''I bought my farm as a farm, and this is how I want to make a living,'' said Andrew Buzby, who grows fruit and vegetables in Salem County. He has 13 laborers this summer, but also relies on his wife, his three sons and his 73-year-old father.</p>
        <p>''It's a real good way to make a living if you can do it,'' Mr. Buzby said.</p>
        <p>There's another promising industry here -- or at least one without a downside -- and that is marketing the  beauty here in the southern part of the state. Mr. Kehs said, for example, that in the fishing and birding season there were more than 100,000 vehicle trips just to the tiny bay village of Fortescue.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Fonash, at the Charlesworth Restaurant and Hotel, has seen many of the visitors, fishers on the boats and birders in the reeds, who make the 10-minute drive from the nearest through road.</p>
        <p>A jumble of cottages and mobile homes with about 300 year-round residents, Fortescue is decidedly unpolished. But that's why people like it, Ms. Fonash said: ''People are looking for the hidden away, less exploited places. And we are hidden away.''</p>
        <p>Fortescue was not always so undiscovered. The Charlesworth, built in 1924, once looked out on a beach and a boardwalk, which led to a pavilion for dancing for summer crowds. But storms obliterated beach, boardwalk and tourism, and the Charlesworth, which had been the height of elegance, closed nine years ago.</p>
        <p>When she and her husband, Jim, bought the business two years later and reopened it, ''some kind of higher power was directing us, or else it was a total stroke of idiocy,'' Mrs. Fonash said. But now their dining room, an everybody-knows-everybody kind of place with a table of Europeans or New Yorkers here and there, is usually full, and their five guest rooms usually booked.</p>
        <p>''We haven't made a nickel on it, to tell the truth,'' Mrs. Fonash said while the accordion player set up and the kitchen clanged on a recent Friday night. ''But we've come so far in seven years.''</p>
        <p>Her daughter, Mrs. Fay, paused on her way to the kitchen to continue a conversation. ''And I want a four-year college that's less than a 45-minute commute,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Then Mrs. Fonash continued, too, remarking on the boats that dot the bay on summer weekends. ''It looks like somebody threw out confetti,'' she said. ''We'd love to expand because the potential is here. It's here. Last year I wouldn't have said that, but this year I know.''</p>
