        <p>Given enough time, fantasies about the Fresh Kills landfill could overtake one's life. The space has housed a garbage dump for 52 years, but in January the landfill is supposed to close, and public officials, college professors and Staten Islanders have been embroiled in debates over what to do with the 3,000 acres left behind.</p>
        <p>Guy V. Molinari, the borough president, has asked traffic consultants to submit plans for a new highway, which would connect to existing roads used by trash trucks, to ease congestion.</p>
        <p>Begging pardon, but isn't a new roadway a little uninspired? And all the chatter about public parks and ball fields is earnest and fine, but the city already has a lot of those.</p>
        <p>Instead, how about a giant center devoted to a specific, underappreciated art form -- say, ''Riverdance''? Or what about one big storage space, where all New Yorkers could, for a small fee, house all the stuff kept in what most Americans commonly refer to as the hall closet?</p>
        <p>And who will be the first to boldly propose a giant television studio, perhaps for exclusive use by all those really bad shows that revolve around the antics of freakishly thin women who live in huge apartments with kitchen islands?</p>
        <p>There is the small problem of potential toxins -- the Sanitation Department is required to monitor the site for 30 years after it closes before houses can be built and people can actually live there. But what if that problem suddenly went away? What would New Yorkers dream of for Fresh Kills (outside of a more inviting name), if all impediments, including horrific emissions, were somehow removed?</p>
        <p>Brendan Sexton, president of the Times Square Business Improvement District, said: ''Something many people don't know about Fresh Kills is that hundreds of acres of it have never been touched. At roughly four times the size of Central Park, it is a huge, huge opportunity.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sexton is on the board of the Municipal Arts Society, which is sponsoring an international design competition to ponder these very issues.</p>
        <p>Some would-be urban planners, when posed the question, demurred -- Conan O'Brien, for example, does not do landfills, his publicist said. Joey Buttafuoco was dying to comment, his spokeswoman said, but he had never heard of Fresh Kills. But here are what others who have given the issue some thought would love to see on the Fresh Kills site of the future:</p>
        <p>CLARK WOLF, restaurant consultant</p>
        <p>''A road is a boring idea. It would be so wonderful to have organic teaching gardens, where culinary students could see what comes from the earth. There would be all kinds of flowers and trees and plants, but all of them edible. And there is nothing better than compost for produce.''</p>
        <p>RUSS HARDIN, senior vice president for creative brand management at Saks Fifth Avenue</p>
        <p>''I think it is a tremendous opportunity for a day prison for cell phone abusers. It is so well deserved for those who use them on trains and restaurants. All we need is for the mayor to empower us all to make citizens' arrests, and then we would send them there. I bet you people will learn to stop this heinous abuse,'' like the man on Metro North he heard hammering out divorce terms with his wife on his mobile.</p>
        <p>RICHARD GLUCKMAN, architect</p>
        <p>''Fresh Kills has been the subject over the years of various architecture schools. The easy answer is to devote it to a giant piece of land art.'' His current client, the art gallery owner Mary Boone, chimed in with the suggestion of a large piece by Richard Serra.</p>
        <p>JEFFREY KALINSKY, owner of the boutique Jeffrey</p>
        <p>''Oh, a landfill, that freaks me out so much. But if it really were safe, I'd love to see a fabulous zoo or something for children.''</p>
        <p>BETTE MIDLER, actor, singer, environmentalist</p>
        <p>''My first thought is that they should build a huge municipal building to house all the politicians who are not friendly to the environment. But I do think people should read the elegiac ode to Staten Island in Joseph Mitchell's 'Up in the Old Hotel,' to help them make this decision.''</p>
        <p>JOSH PATNER, a designer at the fashion house Tuleh</p>
        <p>''I always wished New York had a really old-style park with a Ferris wheel, puppet theater, little pony rides. Fresh Kills could be this. I would bring everyone over there for the fashion shows on a beautiful old boat and light the whole thing with ferry lights. We would serve lemonade and have an old-fashioned ice cream stand.''</p>
        <p>MICHAEL ROSENBERG, managing director of the Drama Department, a downtown theater company, currently producing ''Les MIZrahi,''  starring Isaac Mizrahi</p>
        <p>''I am seeing a giant amusement park. Instead of a tunnel of love, there would be a tunnel of trash. The roller coaster would go over all the stuff that people once threw away. There would be carnival games, where people pull the bottle up from a trash heap, or throw baseballs to break dishes. A community garden would be sweet. But no.''</p>
        <p>JIMMY ROLDAN, artist</p>
        <p>''A giant new museum for new artists -- of course including myself -- changing every season to reflect the weather. It would show the people in the world that New York art can be about more than Manhattan.''</p>
        <p>PAMELA LIEBMAN, chief executive of the Corcoran Group, a real estate brokerage firm</p>
        <p>''Staten Island's newest golf course -- with diaper ditch and trash traps. Or maybe there could be a Chelsea Piers of Staten Island. You know, something fabulously athletic!''</p>
        <p>LEO BENNETT, bartender at Gallagher's Steak House on West 52nd Street</p>
        <p>''No more tract homes. Staten Island has enough.''</p>
