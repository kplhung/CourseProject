        <p>INVESTING is much more fun than public accounting, says Thomas J. DiBella, who made the career switch almost 10 years ago and now runs the $239.5 million Aetna Small Company fund. ''It's a lot more exciting to predict the future than to record the past,'' he added.</p>

        <p>INVESTING is much more fun than public accounting, says Thomas J. DiBella, who made the career switch almost 10 years ago and now runs the $239.5 million Aetna Small Company fund. ''It's a lot more exciting to predict the future than to record the past,'' he added.</p>
        <p>But all those years spent poring over balance sheets as a certified public accountant were not wasted. ''I audited and prepared a lot of financial statements, which helps me dissect the financial statements of companies I buy for the fund,'' Mr. DiBella said from his office in Hartford.</p>
        <p>His investors have been rewarded.  The fund returned 16.93 percent a year, on average, for the three years through Aug. 8, compared with 8.11 percent for its peers in the small-blend fund category, according to Morningstar Inc., and 7.73 percent for the Russell 2000, on average, for the three years through July.</p>
        <p>As a ''blend'' manager, combining value and growth styles, Mr. DiBella, 48, says he looks at stocks two ways. ''My personal bias is to look for value,'' he said, ''but I understand the power of momentum investing.''</p>
        <p>The growth-value split in his portfolio is seldom wider than 60-40 either way. Right now, he is adding more value issues to bring them up to 50 percent of the fund. Health care and technology stocks, particularly semiconductor companies, have had problems in recent weeks, he said, ''so we're looking for a few more basic industry businesses.''</p>
        <p>In choosing stocks for the portfolio, Mr. DiBella starts with a universe that includes Russell 2000 companies plus a few hundred more, mostly with market capitalizations of less than $1.5 billion. Every two weeks, the fund screens for stocks using six fundamental factors that he says can drive stock prices.</p>
        <p>The four most important screens examine earnings estimate revisions, price-to-earnings ratios, earnings momentum and stock price momentum. The other screens look at earnings consistency and the ratio of the share price to reinvested earnings. The computer model ranks companies from 1 to 10 on each factor, calculates composite scores and produces a list of the the top 20 percent, or roughly 400 companies.</p>
        <p>To whittle down the list, he does research to see if the business momentum of individual companies can be sustained. He analyzes a company's balance sheet, looking primarily for minimal debt and excess cash flow. Balance-sheet assets can also indicate other factors, like acquisitions, that do not show up in the computer model.</p>
        <p>Mr. DiBella gets a second list of possibilities by using a value screen, again every other week, that looks for companies with at least one-third of their market capitalizations in net cash -- a cushion that can reduce risk.</p>
        <p>He also spends time interviewing management, particularly about its sensitivity to the company's stock price.</p>
        <p>''I'm amazed by management that forget that their stock is the biggest asset they have,'' he said. ''In many cases, they should be thinking about buying back shares or about acquisitions.''</p>
        <p>He considers selling a stock when it falls into the bottom 50 percent of the computer ranking. On the value side, he reviews a stock when its price falls about 20 to 25 percent from the purchase price. He may also take profits if a stock's climb has been particularly sudden.</p>
        <p>The fund's turnover rate is about 250 percent, on the high side, Mr. DiBella conceded. But not too high, he argued. ''The market's been very volatile,'' he said, ''and these types of stocks can be very illiquid.''</p>
        <p>IN June, Mr. DiBella bought shares of Houghton Mifflin, the textbook publisher, at $46.46. ''We're seeing a lot of consolidation in the U.S. educational publishing market,'' he said, ''and this company could be an attractive acquisition target.'' Moreover, Houghton Mifflin is a leader in the school market from kindergarten through 12th grade; that market is growing, he added, because of increasing enrollment and more spending per student.</p>
        <p>Wall Street predicts that earnings will grow 20 percent a year, on average, over the next three years. Shares closed on Friday at $49.5625, or 14.79 times the consensus earnings estimate of $3.35 for 2001. His 12-month price target for the stock is $70.</p>
        <p>Another favorite is Oak Technology, a Sunnyvale, Calif., company that makes integrated circuits for the optical storage and digital imaging markets. The company recently introduced a product that can transfer information onto CD's significantly faster than can be done with current technology, Mr. DiBella said. It just added significant CD business from Samsung, the Korean electronics manufacturer, he added.</p>
        <p>Wall Street expects the company's earnings to grow 80 percent a year, on average over three years. He bought shares in May at $15.70; they now trade at $25.4375, or 72.68 times Wall Street's earnings estimate of 35 cents a share for the fiscal year ending in June 2001. His 12-month price target for the stock is $35.</p>
        <p>Mr. DiBella also likes Emisphere Technologies, a biotechnology and drug delivery company in Tarrytown, N.Y., that converts injectable drugs to oral medications. It is currently testing an oral version of insulin, he said.</p>
        <p>He bought shares in April at $28.13, after the technology-stock plunge, but sold the position by June 28, at an average price of about $50. The price then fell again, and he bought more shares on Aug. 2 at $28.50, when the company showed up on his value screen because it held $12 a share in cash; it now trades at $26.5625. His 12-month price target is $45.</p>
        <p>Wall Street predicts that the company will have a loss of $2.73 a share in 2001; he expects it to become profitable by 2003.</p>
