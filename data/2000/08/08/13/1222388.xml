        <p>Despite the beauty of the towering redwoods and bay trees in these mountains some 60 miles south of San Francisco, it is the more modest tanoak trees that are everywhere dead and dying that draw the eye.</p>
        <p>Their sheaves of brown leaves a startling contrast to the verdant forest around them, these tanoaks, like thousands of trees up and down the California coast, are falling victim to a new disease. Scientists call it sudden oak death syndrome, and they are alarmed by its rapid spread and its ability to kill an ever increasing number and variety of trees.</p>
        <p>So many trees began dying this year that scientists began a mad scramble to understand this syndrome, first seen five years ago in a single patch of tanoak trees just north of San Francisco. In July researchers found evidence that the die-off -- which has spread to three tree species -- had also spread over 350 miles along the coast from far northern into central California, fueling concerns that the disease might continue its rapid spread to other species and outside of the state.</p>
        <p>Researchers became even more concerned last month when another team of scientists discovered that the culprit appeared to be a previously unknown species of Phytophthora, a notorious group of funguslike organisms that includes the species that caused the Irish potato blight and the species now killing oak trees in Europe and eucalyptus trees in Australia.</p>
        <p>''We've never seen anything like this,'' said Dr. Rick Standiford, associate dean for forestry at the University of California at Berkeley. ''Oak trees die, of course, but nothing to this extent. Knowing what Dutch elm disease and chestnut blight have done to our forests -- chestnuts are basically extinct -- hopefully that doesn't happen with oaks.''</p>
        <p>A state of emergency has been declared in Marin County, one of the hardest-hit areas, and a statewide task force has been created. Possible federal actions will be considered on  Tuesday by the Department of Agriculture, which has the authority to call quarantines to restrict the movement of a plant disease.</p>
        <p>While describing the disease as having reached epidemic proportions, scientists note that there are still vast stretches of healthy oak trees even in affected areas, though how long and how many of those will remain healthy is impossible to predict.</p>
        <p>Scientists are predicting, however, that the growing die-off will have a huge impact on the thousands of animal species that rely on leaves and acorns from these trees. Concern also is growing over the fire risk posed by the rapid accumulation of dead trees in already fire-prone areas. In addition, many homeowners are panicking over the loss of beloved and valuable trees. In hard-hit and well-to-do Marin County, for example, a coast live oak tree can add as much as $30,000 to the value of a property.</p>
        <p>The disease was discovered by Dr. Pavel Svihra, a horticulturist at the University of California at Davis, in 1995 when he was called by homeowners in the town of Mill Valley to inspect dying tanoak trees that bordered their backyards. But for years he was unable to arouse the interest of other scientists, who dismissed the problem as trivial.</p>
        <p>Since then the disease appears to have spread rapidly, showing up in a variety of forests, from tourist destinations like Muir Woods National Monument to remote wild lands to suburban backyards. And it has jumped from attacking only tanoaks, a poorly regarded species, to attacking prized coast live oaks and black oaks.</p>
        <p>''The evidence was so overwhelming that something was going on,'' said Dr. Brice McPherson, entomologist at the University of California at Berkeley. ''People just couldn't ignore it anymore.''</p>
        <p>The first symptom of the syndrome is the so-called bleeding, as wine-red sap oozes from the bark. Later the tree is attacked by beetles that leave a coating of sawdust on the bark and by fungi, including one known as Hypoxylon that sprouts black warty growths on the trunk. When the tree eventually dies its leaves go quickly from green to brown, hence the name sudden oak death syndrome.</p>
        <p>Researchers still do not know how the disease moves from tree to tree or forest to forest. But in the laboratory this summer, Dr. David Rizzo, a plant pathologist at the University of California at Davis, and colleagues discovered that the new Phytophthora makes a spore that can swim. The finding suggests the disease could move in water as the spores of other Phytophthora species are known to do. But the disease could also have spores that are moving via soil, wind, beetle feet, hiking shoes or tires. With the disease prevalent in state parks, neighborhoods and other areas frequented by humans, some suspect humans are the real culprit.</p>
        <p>''How does it spread so fast? People visit Muir Woods, get it in the tires of their car and drive home to Santa Cruz and bingo!'' said Dr. Rizzo, whose laboratory discovered that the disease was caused by a Phytophthora. ''It's scary.''</p>
        <p>Scientists noted that while disease-causing spores are likely to spread far beyond California, they will only cause trouble -- on the East Coast, for example -- if tree species in the new areas are susceptible and if the Phytophthora can withstand a variety of climates. Researchers are testing both conditions.</p>
        <p>Scientists are still trying to determine just how far the disease has spread and how many trees have been afflicted, with estimates ranging from the thousands to the millions.</p>
        <p>Dr. Maggi Kelly, remote sensing specialist at the University of California at Berkeley, and Dr. McPherson are using aerial digital photography to search for early signs of the disease. Stressed trees often reflect light differently and if these researchers can find such a visual signature from the air, it would allow them to quickly do large-scale surveys of the spread of the syndrome.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, a team of six students working with Dr. Steve Zack, a wildlife ecologist with the Wildlife Conservation Society based at the Bronx Zoo, has done the broadest survey yet, individually examining 8,000 tanoak trees over a 350-mile span up and down the coast. They are finding an average of 15 percent of the trees are infected across the range and as many as 80 percent are infected in some areas.</p>
        <p>The impact of all the missing acorns and leaves will probably be huge, researchers said.</p>
        <p>''The cascading effect of losing these trees is going to be awesome,'' Dr. Zack said. ''We're just waiting for the other shoe to drop.''</p>
        <p>It remains unclear why the disease is spreading now, whether it is because this Phytophthora species is an exotic pest that has just arrived or whether it is because the species is a formerly benign organism that only recently evolved a virulent form. A few scientists are arguing that the disease may be a longstanding but normally milder one that is temporarily flaring up as it takes advantage of trees stressed by weather or water conditions.</p>
        <p>Whatever the reason for the disease's spread, many people, in particular homeowners, are desperate for a cure.</p>
        <p>''A lot of homes, whole neighborhoods are built around these oak trees,'' said Nicole Palkovsky, oak project coordinator for the Marin County Cooperative Extension, which provides horticultural and related advice to residents. ''People are emotionally devastated when they lose their trees.''</p>
        <p>Far from having a cure, scientists say they are afraid that current efforts to eradicate the disease may be doing more harm than good. For example, some land managers and homeowners are cutting and uprooting diseased trees. If the disease spores move in water or air or soil or via the tree's wood, such movement could accelerate the spread of the disease.</p>
        <p>Scientists also are concerned about the effect on the environment if homeowners begin applying fungicide, which may or may not even affect the disease, and insecticide, which is being used to keep the beetles at bay.</p>
        <p>Just a few weeks ago researchers were reluctant to make recommendations because so little was known. The severity of the disease, however, is dissolving the hesitation of even the most cautious researchers, as scientists have begun calling for action, including quarantines on the movement of oak wood and living oak trees.</p>
        <p>''There's so much we still don't know,'' said Dr. Susan Frankel, forest pathologist with the Forest Service and chairwoman of the newly formed California Oak Mortality Task Force. ''But we all agreed that we can't wait any longer.''</p>
