        <p>VINCENT GALLUCCIO of Westhampton, a newcomer to the East End's wine industry, and Richard Olsen-Harbich, a 20-year veteran of it, share a goal: premium wine.</p>
        <p>The record-setting $5.2 million paid for Gristina Vineyards by Mr. Galluccio, a telecommunications executive with Metromedia Fiber Network, reinforces the conventional wisdom that East End vineyards, and their future, are fertilized with gold.</p>
        <p>Mr. Galluccio said he was satisfying a lifelong ambition to enter the wine business and make a first-class product, and laid out an expansion and land acquisition plan that might exceed $10 million.</p>
        <p>He said he hoped to raise production to 15,000 cases, from 5,000 this fall.</p>
        <p>But his interest in advancing Long Island wine probably cannot match that of Mr. Olsen-Harbich, who has taken a step that could have larger communal consequences. To further anchor the region's winegrowing identity, Mr. Olsen-Harbich, the winemaker at Raphael, the $6 million winery rising in Peconic, and Karen Meredith, owner of Broadfields, a new Southold vineyard, have petitioned the federal government to create a new appellation.</p>
        <p>In their filing with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, they propose creation of a new American Viticultural Area called, simply, Long Island, a designation that would appear on bottles.</p>
        <p>This new appellation would, in Mr. Olsen-Harbich's words, ''provide local wine producers another option for labeling their products, as well as added protection against possible consumer fraud.''</p>
        <p>He says the new appellation, encompassing all of Suffolk and Nassau Counties, would overlap the two existing appellations in the region, North Fork of Long Island and The Hamptons, Long Island, but would not affect either.</p>
        <p>He should know. He wrote the petitions that in the 1980's led to the creation of both appellations. For either to appear on a label, 85 percent of the grapes in the wine must come from the area named.</p>
        <p>Mr. Olsen-Harbich and other winegrowers worry about a legal loophole that could lead to creation of what he calls storefront wineries. Unless the name Long Island is protected by appellation status, it is, Mr. Olsen-Harbich fears, ''a marketing term subject to misuse.''</p>
        <p>For example, outside investors indifferent to local producers' concerns about the region's rising reputation could create a small winery on a few acres in, say, Mattituck, bring in grapes, juice or wine from Europe or California and make or bottle plonk labeled Long Island Red or Long Island Sound Bianco. Without protection of the Long Island name, it would not be illegal to create the impression that the wine is local even if it isn't.</p>
        <p>Mr. Olsen-Harbich points out that identifying a winegrowing area on a label is no guarantee of quality in the bottle. Rather, the buyer is assured that the wine truly comes from the area cited. When a consumer buys a Long Island wine, he should not find Chile when he uncorks it.</p>
