        <p>WE'VE been trying to figure out what to call this thing for 50 years,'' Frank Salomon said of the venerable Marlboro Music School and Festival, which ends its 50th season here today with a public concert.

        <p>WE'VE been trying to figure out what to call this thing for 50 years,'' Frank Salomon said of the venerable Marlboro Music School and Festival, which ends its 50th season here today with a public concert. ''It is not what people customarily think of either as a school or as a festival.''</p>
        <p>True, it is an odd school that has no teachers or students; only participants, as they are called, some with much experience, some with little, purposefully mixed and working together in rehearsals and performances of chamber music. The learning is in the doing. And it is an odd festival that determines its concert programs only a week or so in advance, trusting listeners to travel from far and wide all unknowing, and welcome whatever pieces and performers are put before them.</p>
        <p>Not that anything is left to chance; far from it. The event is closely administered, as it has been for some 40 years, by Mr. Salomon, a concert manager and artists' representative from New York, and Anthony Checchia, a concert manager from Philadelphia. And there are artistic directors: new ones this season, in fact, the pianists Richard Goode and Mitsuko Uchida. But apart from special areas of concentration -- music this year (and this afternoon) by Thomas Ades, the composer in residence; discussions of Bach performance next year by the cellist and Baroque specialist Anner Bylsma -- they have little say in the repertory, which is determined on the basis of request lists from the participants.</p>
        <p>Mr. Goode and Ms. Uchida are the only directors since the distinguished pianist Rudolf Serkin, who died in 1991, having run the festival for most of its first four decades. Mr. Goode was present for the first three weeks of the seven-week season, and Ms. Uchida for the last six.</p>
        <p>''We have no platforms, no slogans,'' Ms. Uchida said. ''At Marlboro, we simply look deeply into the music and have time to do so, and we share it with everybody and in some cases with the public.''</p>
        <p>That looking deeply happens in rehearsals, which are the lifeblood of the festival. The daily round of activity is simplicity itself. Like-minded performers are put together in rooms on the tiny campus of Marlboro College to rehearse specific works drawn from those request lists. Distractions are few, for the college, housed in a converted dairy farm, is some two miles from the center of this southern Vermont town, also tiny. If and when the rehearsals come to fruition, the piece may be put on a concert program either in the dining hall for an invited audience or in Henry Z. Persons Auditorium for the general public.</p>
        <p>But managing the system, with 75 performers distributed among various groups, ranging from a few to a dozen or more, with at least one experienced participant in each, is, to say the least, complex. Performers rehearse from three to five pieces in different groups for as much as 28 hours a week.</p>
        <p>Anthony McGill, a superbly talented young clarinetist recently hired by the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra, was heard repeatedly in a day with eight solid hours of rehearsal. ''Is it harder on the brain or on the lips?'' Ms. Uchida asked during one rehearsal, of Schoenberg's ''Pierrot Lu naire.'' The lips, Mr. McGill reported.</p>
        <p>Alisa Belzer, the scheduling director, tracks it all with color-coded cards on a big grid of a board. Why not a computer? ''Scheduling software is either too big or too small,'' Ms. Belzer said, making clear that she had answered that question far too often. ''There are so many idiosyncrasies that it would need to be a powerful program, like something used at an airport. It would be really expensive, and I'm not sure it's worth it.''</p>
        <p>Besides, the board is part of the quaint, treasured Marlboro tradition. So is the road sign ''Caution: Musicians at Play,'' which is supposed to stand near the entrance to the campus but was stolen again this year. And so are the wadded napkin balls that have filled the air during meals ever since Judith Serkin, then a child, now a senior cellist at the festival, and her father, Rudolf Serkin, pelted each other decades ago. (Ms. Uchida congratulated herself at one meal on being unaccountably but blessedly exempt from attack. She was beaned moments later.)</p>
        <p>MARLBORO wears its history heavily. The festival was founded in 1951 by an illustrious group of musicians, all immigrants from a war-torn Europe: Adolf and Herman Busch, Serkin and Marcel and Blanche Moyse. Adolf Busch directed it for one season before his death in 1952, when Serkin took over. Of the group, only Blanche Moyse is alive, still conducting Bach at 90. Famous participants over the years have included Pablo Casals, Alexander and Mischa Schneider, and Felix Galimir as mature artists, and Yo-Yo Ma, Emanuel Ax, Van Cliburn, James Levine and any number of others in their youth. Many a musical partnership was forged here, and some 45 marriages had their start. (Not all lasted.)</p>
        <p>The histories of the festival read disconcertingly like ''The Lives of the Saints'' and seem at times to suggest that nowhere else is musical performance approached with anything like the same probity and seriousness of purpose. An oppressive air of reverence can stir resistance in a first-time visitor. But it doesn't last long. For Marlboro does in fact seem to be a haven for idealism unusual if not unique in the music world. Here, after all, are musicians at the top of their field, freely passing on the lessons of experience for no pay, expecting in return only the joys of collaboration and some renewal in their own psyches.</p>
        <p>Orchestral players have perhaps the most to gain from so radical a change of scene. ''In my world you hit a certain point where you stop learning,'' said Richard Hawley, the principal clarinetist of the Cincinnati Symphony though still young himself. ''You don't stop improving, but thought and concentration are difficult when you're part of an orchestral jukebox. This is a place to grow and develop.'' At the same time, orchestral players have much to lose financially. By taking leave from most of their summer employment, they may give up as much as $10,000 of their annual salaries while receiving pittances for expenses along with transportation costs and housing.</p>
        <p>''Anybody coming here is not coming to make money,'' Ms. Uchida said with righteous pride. It is especially hard to attract top-level soloists, who stand to make a great deal on the summer-festival circuit. (Ms. Uchida and Mr. Goode are, of course, such soloists, and they are not paid even for their additional duties as directors.) Ms. Uchida grudgingly envisions a day when it may be necessary to pay to get the right people. Nor would such practice be without precedent; Casals was paid, paid a lot, Ms. Uchida said, and that in a day with fewer competing opportunities.</p>
        <p>The resistance to payment is evidently philosophical rather than financial. With an endowment of more than $25 million, Marlboro seems to be well heeled. Much of its annual budget of $1.5 million goes for fellowship aid to help cover the costs of room and board for the younger participants on the basis of individual need. The participants are expected to pay a nominal amount toward these costs as well as provide their own transportation.</p>
        <p>''We don't talk about it, but maybe you feel it,'' Ms. Uchida said approvingly of the lack of payment to the senior participants. ''That may make the crucial difference in the spirit of the place.''</p>
        <p>There are other factors in that spirit as well, including a deep-seated sense of community, which centers on the dining room, a former barn. Participants mingle freely at meals. At dinner, all the participants, even the most senior, take turns waiting on the others. Between meals, the dining room (along with virtually every other room on the campus) is used for rehearsals, and on Wednesday evenings, it is used for concerts, as it was regularly in the years before the auditorium was built on the campus, in 1962.</p>
        <p>Whatever the reasons, to judge from a recent array of rehearsals and concerts, Marlboro is a model of musical democracy in action. Not only does the repertory reflect the desires of individual performers, necessarily in varying degrees, but the rehearsals also encourage a free and open interchange. Older players tend to couch suggestions in deferential terms (''if everyone agrees''), and younger ones seem unafraid to pipe up. (It may not always have been thus; stories of outbursts by the excitable Galimir, who died last fall, are legion.)</p>
        <p>Yet however much Marlboro's programming may depend on the personal preferences of participants, the basic repertory has always leaned heavily on the Germanic classics favored by the European founders, particularly Serkin. That emphasis seems unlikely to change. ''We're both Germanophiles,'' Ms. Uchida said, speaking as well for Mr. Goode in his absence. ''We overlap so much. We both have a huge love of Debussy and Chopin, and we'd both be perfectly happy without a note of Tchaikovsky.'' But Ms. Uchida also stressed the new directors' commitment to contemporary music, especially in the form of the composer-in-residence program, which had been dropped for a time.</p>
        <p>Another reason for the stability, not to say predictability, of Marlboro's basic repertory over the years is that new performers are always eager to trot out some of the standards on their own. Given the theoretically unlimited rehearsal time and the availability of so many fine and varied collaborators, participants like to venture into music they don't often perform with their own groups at home or can't master with a few of their friends.</p>
        <p>There is thus a premium on the big pieces of the chamber repertory like, this season, the octets by Schubert and Mendelssohn, and Dvorak's Opus 44 Serenade. Works that mix strings with winds, like the Schubert and the Dvorak, or add singers are also choice items.</p>
        <p>''The Brahms songs with viola are performed at least every year,'' Stephanie Houtzeel, a mezzo-soprano who has performed them here, said with some exaggeration. But sure enough, here they were again, being performed this year by another young mezzo-soprano, Carola Gunther, with Ryo Sasaki, a young violist, and Luis Batlle (pronounced BAH-jay), a pianist and longtime Marlborough participant. And for one listener, Ms. Gunther's smooth, warm interpretation of the two songs, though heard only in rehearsal, was a highlight of these visits.</p>
        <p>The other was a luminously transparent performance of Schoenberg's ''Verklarte Nacht,'' brilliantly led by Hilary Hahn, the young violinist, and anchored by Siegfried Palm, a veteran cellist. Mr. Palm, in another Marlboro tradition, often honored in the breach this summer, played second cellist to a young first, Sumire Kudo.</p>
        <p>Ms. Houtzeel, meanwhile, gave a fine, strong account of Ravel's ''Sheherazade,'' and Ms. Gunther began grappling less securely with the Sprechgesang of ''Pierrot Lunaire'' for a performance this weekend. For that is another kind of work that makes particular sense at Marlboro: one that requires endless rehearsal. Ms. Uchida scheduled 17 rehearsals, 1 fewer than when she performed the work here a few years back with Galimir as the guiding force from the violin. At the 13th rehearsal, fairly basic issues were still being discussed, like how to differentiate the sound and mood of one song from the next. What was most fascinating was the extent to which all the instrumentalists took an interest in the meanings of the German text and the ways they should be expressed in every part.</p>
        <p>Another rehearsal showed how quickly such lavish rehearsal time can be taken for granted and how difficult it must be to readjust to the real world after the season. In the third movement of Prokofiev's First String Quartet, Samuel Rhodes, the longtime violist of the Juilliard String Quartet, asked for a restart at rehearsal No. 29 in the players' parts. At the next stopping point, Emi Ohi Reznick, the second violinist, wanted to go back to No. 33. Colin Jacobsen, the first violinist, commented on ''something four bars before 31.'' But then Mr. Rhodes recalled something else, even farther back. ''In that case, let's do three before 30,'' Mr. Jacobsen said, putting things almost back where they had started the time before.</p>
        <p>Despite such intensive labors, some works never find their way to the concert stage. Nor, in some years, do all the participants, although each performed at least one work this year. The official emphasis, therefore, is on the value of the learning process in rehearsal rather than on performance. But as Mr. Checchia, the administrator, pointed out, ''The peformance is also part of the learning process.''</p>
        <p>FOR all the weight of its traditions and all of its proven success in training performers, Marlboro has undergone change throughout its history. During the Casals era, the 1960's and 70's, orchestral music was performed in quantity; it is rare today. Even opera has occasionally been represented. But undoubtedly the biggest shock was the death of Serkin, whom the board found literally irreplaceable.</p>
        <p>''Everything here has sort of evolved,'' said Mr. Salomon, the administrator. In this case, the board formed a senior artistic committee of three performers, Ms. Uchida, Mr. Goode and Andras Schiff, another pianist. But Mr. Schiff eventually yielded to other demands, including his own summer festival in Hohenems, Austria. Ms. Uchida and Mr. Goode were appointed directors last November.</p>
        <p>The future looks bright indeed. New participants are selected on the basis of auditions, first on tape, then live, and the caliber of the players applying and being accepted has perhaps never been higher, said Carol Faris, the admissions director. In view of the remarkable track record of Marlboro alumni, that is a claim to be taken seriously.</p>
        <p>But the future can wait. First come a few more glances back. The festival's touring arm, Musicians From Marlboro, will present three anniversary programs in November, all passing through New York. In the first, at Carnegie Hall, Mr. Goode and Ms. Uchida are to perform Bach's Concerto in C for Two Keyboards (BWV 1061).</p>
        <p>Bridge Records plans to release an anniversary set next year, and Sony Classical has already released another on two CD's. It is especially notable for the inclusion of a Serkin favorite, Beethoven's Choral Fantasy. Tradition again: Serkin used to perform this work to end the season, with the whole community joining in the chorus. In this performance, from 1981, his son the pianist Peter Serkin conducts, and the choral singing is lusty and committed, giving a sense of the force this festival tends to exert on those in contact with it.</p>
        <p>Almost every performer encountered this summer recounted that his or her first experience at the festival had been a life-altering experience. One who did not, oddly, was Ms. Uchida. ''I didn't really understand what it was about,'' she said of an isolated visit in 1974. She returned in 1992 as part of that post-Serkin stopgap committee.</p>
        <p>''Now I take away a lot,'' she said. ''Selfishly, that's what I come for. I always go away enriched.''</p>
