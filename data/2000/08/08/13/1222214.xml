        <p>In the belief that it is paying Southampton Town $8 million in taxes for unnecessary services, Southampton Village is investigating the possibility of seceding and becoming a city itself.</p>
        <p>''We're charting out the negatives and positives, and if the opportunity is there, we'll take advantage of it,'' Mayor Joseph R. Romanosky Jr. said. ''It will take another six months, and then we'll hold forums for village residents before holding a referendum.''</p>

        <p>In the belief that it is paying Southampton Town $8 million in taxes for unnecessary services, Southampton Village is investigating the possibility of seceding and becoming a city itself.</p>
        <p>''We're charting out the negatives and positives, and if the opportunity is there, we'll take advantage of it,'' Mayor Joseph R. Romanosky Jr. said. ''It will take another six months, and then we'll hold forums for village residents before holding a referendum.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Romanosky said the village, which has 4,000 residents, is studying the charter of the City of Glen Cove, which he said is only slightly larger than his village's six square miles but has 25,000 residents.</p>
        <p>The New York State Commissioners of Mayors has provided the village with an outline of it would need to obtain city status.</p>
        <p>The primary reason for seceding, the mayor said, is money.</p>
        <p>''We find a duplication of services with the town and we are paying for services we are not receiving,'' he said, noting for example that the village has paid fees to the Hampton Bays Water District for 64 years but gets its water from the Suffolk County Water Authority.</p>
        <p>The supervisor of the Town of Southampton, Vincent J. Cannuscio, said he had also asked the town attorney to research the benefits should the town become a city. Although the information he has is not complete, he said it does not appear to be a sound idea.</p>
        <p>''At the end of the day, we will probably find that the status quo suits us pretty well and that we should probably remain a town,'' he said. He pointed out that there has not been a new city chartered in the state since 1948.</p>
        <p>''If it were so useful, other towns and villages would have done it,'' Mr. Cannuscio said.</p>
        <p>Any change would need approval from the State Legislature.</p>
