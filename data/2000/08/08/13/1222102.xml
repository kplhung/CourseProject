        <p>IN Connecticut, a beach -- like a wave -- is catch as catch can. Indeed, to anyone whose ideal beach is on Nantucket or Maui, the Nutmeg State offers what must seem like a dip in a bathtub. Adding to their unassuming quality, the state's beaches front the nearly waveless, partly freshwater Long Island Sound, not the wide-open salt-laden curls of the Atlantic or Pacific oceans.</p>
        <p>At their most humble -- like the 50-foot welcome mat at South Pine Creek Beach in Fairfield, the state's smallest -- they are nearly invisible. And, at their most expansive, they aren't exactly Waikiki.</p>

        <p>IN Connecticut, a beach -- like a wave -- is catch as catch can. Indeed, to anyone whose ideal beach is on Nantucket or Maui, the Nutmeg State offers what must seem like a dip in a bathtub. Adding to their unassuming quality, the state's beaches front the nearly waveless, partly freshwater Long Island Sound, not the wide-open salt-laden curls of the Atlantic or Pacific oceans.</p>
        <p>At their most humble -- like the 50-foot welcome mat at South Pine Creek Beach in Fairfield, the state's smallest -- they are nearly invisible. And, at their most expansive, they aren't exactly Waikiki.</p>
        <p>But consider this before tossing in the beach towel: the longest beach in the state, a 15,840-foot dune- and marsh-backed spit at Hammonasset State Park in Madison, is the centerpiece of one of the most appealing and popular public parks in New England, with 1.5 million annual visitors and a 558-site campground that is booked solidly all summer.</p>
        <p>All in all, the nation's second smallest state has a whopping 458 miles of coastal frontage, distributed among 36 municipalities and four counties.</p>
        <p>Before getting too excited, Nutmeggers should be aware that only 84.5 miles (18 percent) of that 458 miles is actually sandy beach; the rest is bedrock, marsh, glacial drift or artificial fill.</p>
        <p>Still, 85 miles of sandy beach is nothing to sneeze at, or to simply ignore in deference to sand much farther afield.</p>
        <p>As Peter Charles Patton and James M. Kent write in ''A Moveable Shore: The Fate of the Connecticut Coast'' (Duke University Press), ''What Connecticut lacks in broad, sweeping beaches, like those of Cape Cod and the Middle Atlantic states, it makes up for in many small, narrow beaches. These beaches front sea cliffs of glacial sediment, lie seaward of salt marshes, and thrust into bays as spits.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps partly because of their homeliness, the beaches in Connecticut inspire equal parts love and protectiveness in state residents. Sometimes that love engenders a true sense of summertime communality, the likes of which were thought to exist only in Norman Rockwell paintings.</p>
        <p>''It's basically a never-lock-your door beach association with about 150 members,'' said one lifelong summer resident of Indian Cove in Guilford. ''All of the members live in houses or summer cottages on the water, rocks, beaches, or on 10-foot-wide one-way roads with 15 mile-per-hour speed limits.</p>
        <p>''There's a dock with a common boat so you can row out to your mooring, a diving board on rocks, a raft, a water sports day where all the cove kids compete for a war bonnet in things like a 15-foot swimming race where you carry a spoon in your mouth with a peanut and to win, you must have the peanut on the spoon when you cross the finish line.''</p>
        <p>The resident added, ''We have ornery neighbors who act as their own police force and cool people who sit back and host the annual chicken barbecue on their front lawn: 150 people, bring your own beer.''</p>
        <p>Sometimes that protectiveness can also lead to the courtroom, as happened -- to much national news media attention -- with the battle over beach access at the 147-acre park on Greenwich Point.</p>
        <p>But, given the fact that enclaves like Greenwich Point exist all over the Connecticut shore -- tacitly, if not quite legally, privatized -- Greenwich's exclusionary tendencies seem an all too easy target.</p>
        <p>Indeed, one of the great mysteries in Connecticut is determining who really owns the sand. In fact, of the 84.5 miles of sandy beach, 54 miles is privately owned; that is, the access to it is in private hands. The various municipalities own another 23.5 miles, which leaves seven miles of access owned by the state.</p>
        <p>Happily, that access is distributed among five excellent state parks: Sherwood Island State Park in Westport, Silver Sands State Park in Milford, Hammonasset State Park in Madison, Rocky Neck State Park in East Lyme and Harkness Memorial State Park in Waterford.</p>
        <p>Connecticut law mandates that the state owns all land seaward of the mean high-tide line; thus, there is no such thing as a private beach.</p>
        <p>The main way outsiders are dissuaded and beach access is limited in many of the 36 coastal municipalities is through user fees (read: parking) charged to non-residents. Even the much-maligned Greenwich has allowed non-residents use of their town beach; they, however, must be accompanied by a Greenwich resident and pay a $6 user fee.</p>
        <p>And yet, even with these constraints, Connecticut has a bounty of shoreline that would certainly be the envy of any landlocked state in the nation. One way to get around the legalities of the various overseers is to simply park (legally) off the coastline and walk or bike in, then stay on the beach below the high-tide line.</p>
        <p>Another way is to anchor a boat offshore and swim or dinghy landward. The least hassle, of course, is to simply befriend someone who lives in one of the 36 municipalities.</p>
        <p>We could all use another friend, right?</p>
        <p>Where local regulations have curtailed the influx of the general public, the state has picked up the gauntlet.</p>
        <p>In fact, the best beaches -- longest, widest, easiest to find, most accommodating to summer out-of-towners -- are at two of the state parks, Hammonasset and Silver Sands.</p>
        <p>A third state park, the underrated Harkness Memorial, is configured to offer an expansive tree-shaded picnic area, some stellar gardens, a bit of history (the property was once the estate of an oil magnate) and access to one of the state's most intriguing coastal ecosystems.</p>
        <p>Not surprisingly, the most popular beach in Connecticut, in terms of numbers of visitors, is the one with the most sand: Hammonasset State Park. The 1,100-acre park has other amenities besides the three-mile-long beach that explains its perennial appeal, including three sets of bathhouses (at West Beach, East Beach and Meigs Point), a nature center, an amphitheater for nature presentations, interpretive hiking trails and a campground.</p>
        <p>According to the park manager, Roger Kinderman, the annual revenue generated at Hammonasset is five times the amount generated by any of the other coastal state parks.</p>
        <p>The recent Fourth of July weekend, with its perfect weather, was a case in point. Between Saturday and Tuesday, Hammonasset's beaches played host to 50,000 ecstatically sun-baked visitors.</p>
        <p>During peak season, 17 lifeguards are kept on the staff, and up to 12 are on duty on busy weekends (their shifts run from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.).</p>
        <p>For added safety, the park uses a flag system to notify swimmers where the lifeguards are stationed (always between the green flags), or whether they are off duty, in which case yellow flags are displayed (''swim at your own risk''). Red flags mean no swimming is allowed.</p>
        <p>''Red flags are extremely rare,'' Mr. Kinderman said. ''We'd have to have an oil tanker go aground off shore. The reason the beach is so popular here is that it's not split up, and people have a clear, wide-open view in all directions. On clear days, you can see all the way over to Long Island. There are also no rocks in the water. We get busloads of people coming up from New York and down from the rest of New England.''</p>
        <p>Icing Hammonasset's cake are the healthy, fully intact dunes, as well as the prodigious campground that overlooks a waterfowl-rich marsh.</p>
        <p>''We have nearly half the camp sites in the state here,'' Mr. Kinderman said. ''State parks have about 1,400 camp sites total and we have 558 of them at Hammonassett.''</p>
        <p>Silver Sands State Park in Milford has been open only since last summer, and the parking lot is full every weekend. Because Milford has more miles of sandy beach than any other town in the state -- 6.4 miles, or 8 percent of all the beach in Connecticut -- Silver Sands State Park, to many visitors, was long overdue. It's a wonderfully democratic haven, free of charge to all comers and accessed by a road that courses through a teeming wetland.</p>
        <p>Parking is limited (especially on weekends) and Porto-lets are the only toilet facilities available. Two lifeguards are on duty every day, and the park is open from 8 a.m. to sunset.</p>
        <p>One of the favorite pastimes at Silver Sands occurs at low tide, when visitors can walk along a hard shelly sandbar to Charles Island, which sits invitingly a few hundred yards offshore.</p>
        <p>Many legends have built up around the island, including a perhaps wishful one about Captain Kidd burying some of his stolen booty thereabouts. The seaward exodus is so large on weekends that two extra lifeguards are stationed on the island.</p>
        <p>''When high tide starts coming in, the water creates strong rip currents between the beach and the island,'' cautioned one park lifeguard. ''People can drown in two inches of water.''</p>
        <p>In years past, Milford has done its best to balance the needs of state residents against the desires of town residents. Even before it became a state park, Silver Sands Beach was popular with local people and out-of-towners as the site of a small cult of sand castle builders.</p>
        <p>Nowadays, the Milford Arts Council tries to reach out to all comers with its annual Sand Castle and Sculpture contest in early August, a popular event that takes place on Walnut Beach, the stretch of sand just west of the state park. Even if you do not want to spring for a municipal parking pass to Walnut Beach, it is still worth wandering up there to see the sand castle entries, some of which are as inventive as Tibetan prayer wheels or M. C. Escher prints.</p>
        <p>Silver Sands also allows a reasonable amount of access to other beaches in Milford (be nice to the local people).</p>
        <p>Nearby, at 10-acre Milford Point, near where the Housatonic River meets the sound, the Connecticut Audubon Coastal Center has constructed a 70-foot birdwatching tower, and a boardwalk that travels over the vegetation and fragile barrier sand to a beach. For closer contact with birds like great blue herons and snowy egrets, canoe trips are available through 840 acres of salt marsh.</p>
        <p>Another exceptional state park, Harkness Memorial, is off Route 161 in Waterford, just around the bend from New London's most popular summering spot, Ocean Beach. Harkness Memorial is an idyllic, tree-shaded haven, more of a picnic/kite-flying/Frisbee-tossing place than a beachcomber's delight, but a wooden walkway leads over the dunes to a beautiful crescent-shaped beach that has a tidal stream spilling out onto the sand.</p>
        <p>The most popular beach activity, besides snoozing with a John Grisham paperback on one's chest, is surf-casting for fish. Swimming, on the other hand, is forbidden, but wading is rampant, and if you ford the stream and walk westward, you have about a mile of open sand upon which to roam. Entrance fees are $4 for state residents, $5 for out-of-staters. In August, Harkness is home to a popular live music (classical, jazz) series (800-969-3400).</p>
        <p>Ocean Beach, the car entrance for which is at 1225 Ocean Avenue in New London, has a storied history.</p>
        <p>''It was different down here when I was a kid,'' said Otello Leone Pietro Pierre Federici, who goes by the more user-friendly Pete Piers and staffs the pedestrian entrance to Ocean Beach ($2, $1 a child). ''Pequot Avenue was lined with big homes where all the wealthy people lived,'' he said. ''Then the 1938 hurricane hit and took out nearly everything, cottages, homes, even the elm trees. But a couple years later, this place was hopping. All the bands came in here, including Benny Goodman's. It was really something.''</p>
        <p>Today, Ocean Beach has a much less stellar -- some might say much more tacky -- but still popular presence on the shoreline. The beach is excellent, rockless and regularly dragged clean by tractors, and the easterly site, almost where the Sound ends and the Atlantic Ocean begins, offers a bit more wave action than beaches to the west. Beginning last year, the Boston Concessions Group took over management of the park, which has been in varying states of decrepitude over the years. They spruced up the boardwalk -- a wide, wooden expanse redolent of Atlantic City -- and repainted the miniature golf course (most impressive is the hole dominated by a giant ceramic sperm whale).</p>
        <p>For better or worse, Ocean Beach offers the ultimate in commercial democratization: everybody (city resident, state resident, out-of-towner) pays the same rate of $6 acar during the week, $10 on weekends. Extra fees are extracted for use of the triple-chute water slide and the Olympic-sized pool.</p>
        <p>Given that most of the other beaches in the New London area have been almost obsessively reserved for residents, Ocean Beach qualifies as a minor miracle. Indeed, the surrounding neighborhood, dominated by fences and ominous warning signs, seems to wish that this little slice of the Jersey Shore would just go away. Thousands of visitors are glad it has stayed put.</p>
        <p>Just a few blocks away, at 335 Pequot Avenue, is the Monte Cristo Cottage, the childhood home of Eugene O'Neill.</p>
        <p>Here's another Connecticut beach statistic that might shock and amaze: 62 percent of Bridgeport's coastline is artificial fill. This is in keeping with the industrial tone of the waterfront, where seemingly every recycling plant on the planet has chosen to relocate. There's even a Children's Garbage Museum in the midst of the urban swarm.</p>
        <p>Bridgeport is, however, a perpetual work in progress, so don't be put off by the jackhammers and smoke along the coast. At the heart of the city's waterfront, on the western side of its giant harbor, is what may just be the most surprising expanse of sand in the state. Here you will find Seaside Park, a 370.7-acre expanse designed in 1867 by Frederick Law Olmsted (with Calvert Vaux).</p>
        <p>Olmsted, who is best known for creating  Central Park, left his imprint on many parks in the state, including the Hartford Retreat for the Insane (now the Institute of Living), Trinity College, Yale University and Walnut Hill Park in New Britain. Seaside Park, with its ponds, fountains, ballfields, monumental Romanesque arch, statues (including a humdinger of Phineas Taylor Barnum), and gnarled oak shade trees, is one of many Olmsted's firm designed in Bridgeport.</p>
        <p>At the park's western end is Fayerwether Island, an equally fascinating work in progress. The island is connected to the mainland by a 1,200-foot jetty that was built between 1914 and 1918, and upon which visitors are allowed to walk and climb. A small (no longer active) lighthouse provides a distinctive touch to the city's harbor, though the island itself is slip-sliding away. Between 1951 and 1981, 5 of its 13 acres eroded.</p>
        <p>Most of that lost sand has been deposited on the enormous beach that runs the length of Seaside Park to the east. The beach has two separate, but equally wide, sections, the westernmost running for 1.1 miles and the other for 0.7 miles. Another quiet, tree-rimmed stretch of beach can be found along the harbor mouth, popular with tram-pushing moms and dads.</p>
        <p>Seaside Park serves the same function for Bridgeport that Jones Beach serves for New York and Santa Monica Beach serves for Los Angeles: an unofficial steam-release valve for a vast and diverse population. Since there is plenty of room for everybody -- with 6,500 spaces, Seaside owns the distinction of biggest beach parking lot in the state -- nearly everybody comes on weekends, when the park throbs with rap music, salsa, heavy metal and laughter. The sweaty human swarm gets along just fine, spilling out among the ballfields, picnic areas, and a semipermanent group of carnival rides while midway concessionaires  peddle cotton candy and other nutritious staples of beach cuisine.</p>
        <p>The grandeur of Olmsted's landscaping and the century-old structures, juxtaposed against this funky hodgepodge, makes Seaside Park something of a wonder to behold on a hot summer weekend. Though the park could use a facelift -- and even the gatekeeper who dispensed the car permits allowed how, ''they don't want to fix nothing around here'' -- it has an enduring appeal, and it's a sight for sore eyes to anyone fenced out of other beaches in the state. Parking permits are $5 for all Connecticut residents, $10 for out-of-staters.</p>
        <p>Curiously, Seaside Park is not even the best beach in Bridgeport. That distinction belongs to Pleasure Beach on the opposite (eastern) side of Brideport's large harbor. Pleasure Beach is an extension of the Town of Stratford's Long Beach.</p>
        <p>Just as Fayerwether Island has helped create Seaside Beach, the 1,800-foot jetty at the harbor's eastern mouth has redistributed sand on Pleasure Beach in such quantities -- extending it 250 feet since 1934 -- that Mr. Patton and Mr. Kent call it an ''embarrassment of riches.''</p>
        <p>One caveat: Bridgeport residents used to flock across the harbor mouth via a drawbridge that traversed Lewis Gulf. But that bridge burned down two years ago and has not been repaired. The only way to get to Pleasure Beach now is to park in Stratford's Long Beach lot (free) and walk west below the high-tide line on the beach. Not many people from Bridgeport avail themselves of this opportunity, which means that those who do have the beautiful quiet beach all to themselves.</p>
        <p>Few places in the world offer such a delicious treat: a wide, healthy sand beach at the mouth of an industrial harbor and in the heart of a thickly populated urban center. As you walk west, the beach widens to over a quarter-mile at the point, offering what Mr. Patton and Mr. Kent call ''some of the best beach walking in south-central Connecticut.''</p>
        <p>As one gazes at all this sand and sea, the myth of a beachless Connecticut is righteously invalidated.</p>
