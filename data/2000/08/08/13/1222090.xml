        <p>SHE might not like the description, but some people consider Bride Whelan something of a seer whose medium is color. Tell her whether red, blue or green speaks most forcefully to you, and she'll describe your personality, your style, your values. She will insist, however, that there's nothing psychic about her abilities, that ample evidence from science, history and psychology explains the link between personality and color.</p>
        <p>Given her color-coded perspective on the world -- she has consulted on color, taught, and written two books on the subject -- the question inevitability arises: What kind of colors does she use at home?</p>

        <p>SHE might not like the description, but some people consider Bride Whelan something of a seer whose medium is color. Tell her whether red, blue or green speaks most forcefully to you, and she'll describe your personality, your style, your values. She will insist, however, that there's nothing psychic about her abilities, that ample evidence from science, history and psychology explains the link between personality and color.</p>
        <p>Given her color-coded perspective on the world -- she has consulted on color, taught, and written two books on the subject -- the question inevitability arises: What kind of colors does she use at home?</p>
        <p>Last year, Ms. Whelan (who pronounces her first name BRI-dee) moved from a 10-room house in Southport, Conn., where she had lived for 23 years, into a one-bedroom apartment in Midtown. The move was precipitated, she said, by the classic causes: ''The children left home, the dog died, and the cat ran away.''</p>
        <p>After 20 years of commuting, she wanted a place near her job as the executive director of the Society of Publication Designers, which has its office on East 42nd Street. A cheerful and engaging woman who cannot walk down a block without running into someone she knows, Ms. Whelan decided to forgo a broker in her search, figuring she could do better on her own. She set out on foot, visiting buildings and talking to doormen in the buildings that looked appealing.</p>
        <p>That tactic quickly turned up an apartment to rent on Park Avenue near 39th Street, in a gracious building that is the epitome of the old New York. The building has helpful doormen, an elevator run by a human, and apartments with high ceilings, attractive moldings and well-proportioned rooms. Ms. Whelan's apartment, a condo that rents for $2,500 a month -- with a right of first refusal if the owner decides to sell -- has a substantial foyer, a dining room next to the galley kitchen, a large living room with an arched entryway and a fireplace, and an equally spacious bedroom.</p>
        <p>The walls, surprisingly, are white. So are the couches in the living room, and the spread and drapes in the bedroom.</p>
        <p>Some of the choices are temporary, others quite deliberate. She always has white couches, Ms. Whelan says, because they provide a good backdrop for the yellows and oranges she likes to use in rugs, pillows and artwork.</p>
        <p>A multicolored quilt will eventually go on the bed, after she makes some repairs to it. She is planning to paint one wall of the living room a yellow orange, to give it the warmth and motion she wants. ''Orange is a friendly color,'' she says. ''It says, I want to be your friend. Orange means you like things to be pleasant and happy. Yellow is always about motion.''</p>
        <p>But she'll do only one wall. ''I don't like a lot of color on the walls,'' she says. ''I'd rather have a lot of color around me.'' The bedroom, too, may eventually get a coat of a soft yellow.</p>
        <p>THE colors she wears, she says, are quite different from the colors she uses at home. To her office, she is likely to wear blue, a color she says confers authority. When she shows up at a meeting in a blue suit, she says, she is sending a  message that she is in charge. Black is something else. ''Black is always hostile, but's it's very defining,'' she says, which may explain why it is the color of New York.</p>
        <p>At home, she surrounds herself with warm colors like red, yellow and orange. ''When you walk into my house, you feel very relaxed,'' she says. ''I think it's the color. I like to send a message with color.''</p>
        <p>In her living room, there are patches of yellow and orange and red  everywhere -- in a chair covered with a paisley fabric, in a carpet she found at the Tepper auction house, in the prints of apples and oranges on the wall, in a batik cover over a corner table. And especially, in a Majolica urn from Italy, from the Victorian era, that is orange, yellow and green. ''I just like the way it feels,'' she says. ''It looks happy.''</p>
        <p>People who are trying to figure out what colors they genuinely like, and not what some style or fashion may dictate that they like, should look for the one object in their home that makes them happy, and then look at the colors, she says. If she were to pick one thing in this apartment, it would be that urn.</p>
        <p>She has done little to the galley kitchen, except place her toaster oven on one burner of the massive commercial-style Viking stove. ''That's my level,'' she says.</p>
        <p>Not that she doesn't entertain. There is a roof deck atop the 15-story building that is rarely used by the other tenants, and on New Year's Eve and the Fourth of July she had parties there. ''It was just spectacular,'' she says, because of the views of the Chrysler Building and the Empire State Building.</p>
        <p>In the summer, she has missed the garden she had in Connecticut, but otherwise, leaving the suburbs was easy. ''It's a wonderful life if you have children,'' she says. But later, it's not so wonderful.</p>
        <p>''The suburban life for a single woman was just deadly,'' she says. ''In the city, you can do things by yourself. There doesn't have to be that attachment factor.'' She has been divorced for 20 years, and with her three children all well into their 20's, it seemed time to leave and move onto the next stage.</p>
        <p>Indeed, there is a sign over her front door that says it all, something that was left by the owner that suits her perfectly. It says: ''Though no one can go back and make a brand new start, anyone can start from now and make a brand new ending.''</p>
