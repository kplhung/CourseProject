        <p>PAID $37 to park my car in Manhattan the other night. Was there only three hours, but should have left the car to rationalize the overnight fee.</p>
        <p>''You dope,'' some people are saying. ''It's your own fault for driving in Manhattan. You get what you deserve in life.''</p>
        <p>True, but normally I jockey into spaces on the street and only in desperation do I go for a garage. When did parking soar from $20 to $37 on Amsterdam and 75th?</p>
        <p>A price like that can make you feel you don't belong in your own city anymore. Yet the garage was full, and the restaurants were busy on a Wednesday night, and up at Yankee Stadium, there was a crowd of 33,466 paying customers. Who can afford these pleasures?</p>
        <p>''Merchants are hiking prices because they recognize that these days many New Yorkers have more disposable income,'' notes Peter F. Vallone, the speaker of the New York City Council.</p>
        <p>''But the truth is, too many New Yorkers can't afford to have a good time,'' Vallone said.</p>
        <p>Not if a good time is defined as a casual night at the arena. In the age of the $37 parking fee, the dreadfully selfish athletes are up to nine-digit salaries, spread over a few years. This forces the wonderfully benevolent owners to raise ticket prices -- as gently as possible, of course.</p>
        <p>Vallone claims that sports tickets have risen faster than any other form of entertainment in the past five years, and backs it up with numbers.</p>
        <p>The Knicks' highest ticket -- not including season ticket plans -- has risen from $45 to $220 since 1995, which, adjusted for inflation, amounts to a leap of 335.21 percent.</p>
        <p>''Who in the world can afford that?'' Vallone said. ''The fans are the ones who made the Knicks, but now they can't see the Knicks in person.''</p>
        <p>Depends on your definition of fan. Somebody must be able to afford to watch the Knicks, since they have sold out Madison Square Garden for 347 straight games, since John Starks was a lad.</p>
        <p>''A lot of these are corporate seats,'' Vallone said. ''You have a wealthy class of people who buy these tickets for business purposes. There's nothing left for the middle class. The taxi driver can't buy four seats to the Knicks.''</p>
        <p>These populist sentiments from Vallone, a Democrat from Queens, just might have something to do with his mayoral aspirations. He made his original comments directly in front of the Garden, which, as you might imagine, has its corporate response.</p>
        <p>''Winning teams and top-rated productions are very expensive to produce,'' said the Garden's president, Dave Checketts, in a statement.</p>
        <p>The Garden is not the only sports outfit to raise prices. Yankees bleacher seats have jumped only 18.69 percent since 1995 while their highest tickets have jumped 110.19 percent. The Mets' lowest tickets have jumped 64.38 percent and their highest have gone up 119.58 percent.</p>
        <p>At the United States Open, prices have risen only 1.29 percent for the cheaper tickets in the first week. The modest rise can be explained by these seats being in the lunar reaches of Ashe Stadium, so remote that ticket-holders abandon them to actually see a tennis match.</p>
        <p>At the Open, the more expensive seats have jumped 127.31 percent, below the ghost town of the luxury boxes. (All these percentages were adjusted for inflation.)</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the Staten Island Ferry has gone from 50 cents to free -- ''the best deal in town,'' Vallone called it -- seagulls and salt spray instead of the cacophonous drivel of the Garden.</p>
        <p>Vallone has an apocalyptic vision in which the average fan will lose visceral contact with the players, and the passion for sport will die. He wishes the office of council speaker, or the mayor, had more muscle, but he said that when he complains of gouging in other areas, ''the heads of banks come to my office.'' The line forms on the right for team owners willing to be scolded by the speaker.</p>
        <p>For all the gouging, the evidence is that people still feel connected with their teams. A fascinating article by James C. McKinley Jr. in Friday's New York Times suggests that fans may actually be healthier and happier than people with no sporting affiliation.</p>
        <p>In other words, fretting over Patrick Ewing's court vision has the same function as caring for a fuzzy pet -- therapy at $220 a pop.</p>
        <p>The temptation is to tell fans to get over it, that it's just a game, but psychologists say that male and female fans undergo hormonal surges based on the wayward roll of a ball.</p>
        <p>For example: when poor old Franco Baresi and Roberto Baggio both missed penalty kicks to decide the scoreless tie in the 1994 World Cup final between Italy and Brazil, the measurable testosterone level in a small sample of Brazilian men went up by 28 percent while the level in a sample of Italian men went down by 27 percent. (There's plenty to spare, but still -- 27 percent?)</p>
        <p>So remember: when you see Florida fans lurching away in their Winnebagos after a bad autumn afternoon at Florida State, or Red Sox fans dying yet another death in Fenway Park, think of the downward spiral of testosterone level, matched only by the upward spiral of ticket prices -- going together like a masochist's dream.</p>
