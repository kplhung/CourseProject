        <p>Alexis Johnson (second from left, seated): ''We're the Bertha-Hewitt color guard, a group of girls of that twirl flags and rifles while the marching band is playing. We are getting our hair french-braided for the parade, just sitting there and getting mentally prepared. We are from a small town. The community expects a lot of us. They want a good performance to put Bertha on the map and show that we are not a bunch of snobs or troublemakers. Some mornings I don't want to get up for practice at 6:30, but you know that you are special. The color guard is apart from everybody else. Eyes are always on you. I like that.''</p>

        <p>Alexis Johnson (second from left, seated): ''We're the Bertha-Hewitt color guard, a group of girls of that twirl flags and rifles while the marching band is playing. We are getting our hair french-braided for the parade, just sitting there and getting mentally prepared. We are from a small town. The community expects a lot of us.

Some mornings I don't want to get up for practice at 6:30, but you know that you are special. The color guard is apart from everybody else. Eyes are always on you. I like that.''</p>
        <p>Chelsea Wicht (second from right, seated): ''When I was little, I wished I was in the color guard. I just thought they were so pretty and looked so cool. Now I'm 13. As we were getting our hair braided I was thinking about what the other bands will be like: will they be hard to beat or easy? I think about holding my shoulders back, standing straight, and about people watching me. You can't look at them. You have to look ahead, chin up, kind of like you are staring off into the distance. But you wonder if they're watching.''  Tracy Bowman (far right, seated): ''There are not very many little schools like us. We were competing against way bigger schools. It's a prideful thing when you get out there when all these people are cheering for you. You feel real good. Sometimes in big parades there are so many people watching us it gives me chills. People all say, 'Smile.' But we can't smile. We look straight forward in the military style. That's probably the hardest part.''  Rita Anderson (far right, standing): ''My husband and I have been helping the kids for 16 years. We've been like another set of parents. We see these kids out of the street dressed in regular clothes. Then it's like a metamorphosis happens when they put those uniforms on. It's like, 'I am part of the Bertha-Hewitt marching band, now watch what we can do.' Sometimes we'll go to another city, and they'll ask, 'What town are you from?' We'll say, 'Oh, just a small town in Minnesota.' And they'll say, 'Oh, the Bertha-Hewitt marching band.' ''</p>
