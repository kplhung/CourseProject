        <p>Amy Ellen Steinman and Kenneth Michael Cohen are to be married today by Rabbi Melvin Sirner at Tavern on the Green in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>The bride, 33, is a senior research analyst with Nielsen Media Research in Manhattan. She graduated from the University of Rochester, and is the daughter of Helen Steinman of Scarsdale, N.Y., and the late Dr. David Steinman. Her mother is a social worker with the New York City Board of Education. The bride's father was a psychiatrist at Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>Her paternal grandfather, David B. Steinman, was the engineer who designed the Henry Hudson Bridge and the Mackinac Bridge in Michigan.</p>
        <p>The bridegroom, 35, is a lawyer in Manhattan, specializing in legal issues for the elderly. He graduated cum laude from Brandeis University and received a law degree from Yeshiva University. He is a son of Barbara and Gerald Cohen of New Rochelle, N.Y. His mother is the registrar of the New Rochelle Board of Education. His father is a certified public accountant in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>The couple's relationship has been a run, rather than a walk, in the park. They met at a running class in Central Park in the fall of 1998 and went on their first date about a month later. Last year, they crossed the finish line of the New York City Marathon -- his second, her seventh -- together. It was at that spot, near Tavern on the Green, that Mr. Cohen proposed to Ms. Steinman in February.</p>
