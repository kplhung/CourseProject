        <p>The Suffolk County Legislature is considering a bill to require retailers of all-terrain vehicles to inform customers that state law bars use of the vehicles on public land, or on private land without a landowner's permission.</p>
        <p>The vehicles have become increasingly popular in Suffolk in recent years. But the police and park rangers say their use is aggravating erosion problems on trails and in wooded areas and park lands.</p>
        <p>Legislator Ginny Fields, a Democrat from Oakdale, said the measure would require retailers to post signs and give customers notices about legal prohibitions on use of the vehicles.</p>
        <p>''It's a no-brainer because these A.T.V.'s have been running rampant, ripping up parks, wetlands and other outdoor places,'' Ms. Fields said. ''This law would let people know right off that they are not going to have the freedom of riding these things wherever they want.''</p>
        <p>The measure was to have been voted on last week but the vote was delayed when the marathon evening session went past 2 a.m. Ms. Fields said she was confident it would pass when the legislature meets in Riverhead on Aug. 31.</p>
        <p>Nancy Manfredonia, president of the Long Island Greenbelt Trail Conference, said, ''These businesses are making a lot of money on these machines, and they should at the very least tell people the real deal about using them.''</p>
        <p>She said that an informal survey by the group had found that most dealers ''do not go out of their way'' to tell prospective buyers about use restrictions, and that when some dealers were asked to inform customers voluntarily, ''they were not too thrilled about that idea.''</p>
