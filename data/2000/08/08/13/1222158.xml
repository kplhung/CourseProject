        <p>IN its heyday, Studio A-4 was called the Snake Pit. Admission 50 cents.</p>
        <p>Dancers named the rehearsal room after a 1948 movie about a mental institution with an open room where the most severely disturbed patients roamed and chattered incoherently. They said it was a performers' madhouse where sword swallowers, flame throwers, adagio teams, tap dancers and acrobats simultaneously practiced their acts.</p>
        <p>Today the room is no longer a vaudeville rehearsal free-for-all, but little else has changed inside Fazil's Times Square Studio, a legendary dance rehearsal hall at 743 Eighth Avenue, between Restaurant Row and 47th Street.</p>
        <p>A long practice mirror, cracked in three directions, is held together with clear tape along the triangular cracks' seams. The poles of the ballet bars are worn smooth by the hands of decades of dancers. Two dust-laden pianos sit against a back wall, their chipped keys forsaken by dancers who prefer boom boxes and recorded music. The rusted metal hooks once used by acrobats and students to suspend themselves hang inconspicuously from the ceiling. And when the wind blows into the un-air-conditioned room, some people believe the spirits of great dancers have entered on the breeze.</p>
        <p>The studio, which opened in the late 1920's, has three floors of rehearsal rooms, 14 in all, with floors that talk and walls that exude dance history from vaudeville to hip-hop. In Midtown, which is rapidly trading in its old buildings and longtime tenants for brighter lights, bigger billboards and gleaming skyscrapers, the old studio stands tall as one of the last and oldest of the city's great dance rehearsal halls.</p>
        <p>For tap dancers, the oak floors at Fazil's are hallowed ground.</p>
        <p>''They're the finest floors in New York City to tap dance on, maybe on the Eastern Seaboard,'' Gregory Hines said. ''It means something to be in there. To me it always meant that I was really a tap dancer.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hines, who is filming a movie about the life of the legendary tap dancer Bill (Bojangles) Robinson for Showtime, discovered Fazil's in 1980 when he met the tapper Honi Coles for a practice session.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hines loved the energy, emotion and floors at the hall so much that he modeled Sonny's, the dance studio in ''Tap,'' the 1989 movie in which he starred, after Studio A-1.</p>
        <p>Photographs of smiling ballroom dancers, acrobatic duos, belly dancers, actors and hoofers line the lobby's walls. When the people in the most worn and yellowed photos roamed the halls, the studio was called Michael's, for its founder, a former wrestler and acrobatic instructor. Among the young talent who drilled there were the tappers Chuck Green and the Nicholas Brothers; the flamenco dancers Jose Molina and Jose Greco; Fred and Adele Astaire; and Judy Garland and Gene Kelly. Alvin Ailey started his first dance company at Michael's. Later, Woody Allen shot scenes for several of his films, including ''Broadway Danny Rose,'' there.</p>
        <p>Jerry LeRoy, most remembered for a stage act in which he tap-danced in ice skates on a set of wooden stairs, took over the studio in the early 1970's when Michael, whose last name no one remembers, died.</p>
        <p>Fazil Cengiz, a former taxi driver, started taking tap and ballroom dance classes at Jerry LeRoy's. When Mr. LeRoy died, Fazil's was born. Mr. Cengiz has run the studio since 1978, and has ensured that the rehearsal hall remains a haven for ethnic dancers and dance outcasts like flamenco dancers, whose clicking castanets and constantly stomping nail-heeled shoes often splinter wooden floors and break the concentration of more staid performers.</p>
        <p>''These are the real artists, and they want a real place,'' Mr. Cengiz said. A tall, gray-bearded man with a long pony tail, he sits sentry behind a rickety wooden desk, booking rooms and collecting rental fees. ''If they get rich, they still come here,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Dancers remember that when the floors were splintered and trounced upon, the loosened floorboards sent swirls of dust through the air. Mr. Cengiz replaced some of the floorboards, but said he took care to change things only when repairs were necessary. He plans to replaster the holes in the walls, punctured by errant kicks and punches from hip-hop and break-dancers. Until then the holes are a part of the ambience.</p>
        <p>Brian Green, a hip-hop dancer who has choreographed for the rhythm and blues artist Maya and the rapper Foxy Brown,  brought both of them to Fazil's.</p>
        <p>''You don't really get a real bourgeoisie attitude here,'' Mr. Green said. ''Everyone is here for the art, not for the money. No one here is really plastic.''</p>
        <p>It doesn't hurt that it only cost $10 an hour to rent a studio. Most cost twice that.</p>
        <p>Dancers say camaraderie and a sense of family among those who rehearse at Fazil's also keep them coming back. And, of course, there are the ghosts.</p>
        <p>Jose Molina, who teaches Spanish and flamenco dance, says the studio has aire, a Spanish word for wind.</p>
        <p>''It's a genie going around the rooms, and we have to believe in that,'' Mr. Molina said. ''The aire is not every day, but we catch it sometimes.''</p>
        <p>Coupled with such eerily comforting feelings is a fear of the unknown. Although speculation about the building's fate has existed for 15 years, the dancers' concerns are fed by the neighborhood's changing face. The word that mingles in the halls with the sounds of salsa and hip-hop is that the building's owner, Lila Scheiner, who owns almost the entire block and several buildings on 46th Street, plans to raze the building for a skyscraper. Phone calls to Ms. Scheiner's home went unanswered.</p>
        <p>For now, the performers lose their worries in the dance and in the myriad sounds that reverberate from the hollow walls. And Mr. Cengiz vows to think positive and not to worry about the studio's future. He says Ms. Scheiner promised him that she would not consider selling the building for several years. Still, he does have one desire.</p>
        <p>''I wish I hit the Lotto,'' Mr. Cengiz said. ''I won't buy a Park Avenue or Fifth Avenue high-society building. I'll take this one.''</p>
