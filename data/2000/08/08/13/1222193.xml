        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Perhaps Elvis Mitchell makes the point and then misses it in his paean to the German-born filmmaker Wim Wenders [''Waiting for Wim Wenders's Future to Come Clear,'' July 30]. Mr. Wenders, quite simply, has never met expectations because all along he has been vastly overrated. Unlike those of his contemporaries Volker Schlondorff and Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Mr. Wenders's films, outside of the art house favorites ''Paris Texas,''  ''Wings of Desire'' and now ''Buena Vista Social Club,'' have never found international audiences.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Perhaps Elvis Mitchell makes the point and then misses it in his paean to the German-born filmmaker Wim Wenders [''Waiting for Wim Wenders's Future to Come Clear,'' July 30]. Mr. Wenders, quite simply, has never met expectations because all along he has been vastly overrated. Unlike those of his contemporaries Volker Schlondorff and Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Mr. Wenders's films, outside of the art house favorites ''Paris Texas,''  ''Wings of Desire'' and now ''Buena Vista Social Club,'' have never found international audiences.</p>
        <p>His latest disaster, ''Million Dollar Hotel,'' will not only quite possibly be the first film featuring Mel Gibson not to play to American audiences but perhaps the only film of Mr. Gibson's growing filmography not to make a dime at the box office. Mr. Wenders has had a charmed career and been a very fortunate man, thanks to the small but loyal following he has garnered through the years (the French adore him), but the bottom line is that he has been in the right place at the right time and benefited tremendously from a film community anxious to crown a postwar German directorial star.</p>
        <p>In the end, Mr. Wenders will be a footnote to contemporary German cinema: the golden boy who never quite made the grade.</p>
