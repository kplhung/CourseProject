        <p>NOBODY lives quite like they do -- his art, her art, their folk-arty house and quirky garden in Washington are part of a whole. The folk artist Tommy Simpson and the weaver-embroiderer Missy Stevens live, work, play and generally hold court in a house distinctly their own. You might call it a folk-art production.</p>
        <p>First view is of the gabled garage with heart-shaped window, followed by a trellised arch dripping with vines. A flower-engulfed brick path weaves to a front door with the words Howdy and Butterplum incised in the door, its knob a chiseled heart. Although the house breathes a personal folk art existence at all times, come summer when the exuberant garden is in bloom, it soars.</p>

        <p>NOBODY lives quite like they do -- his art, her art, their folk-arty house and quirky garden in Washington are part of a whole. The folk artist Tommy Simpson and the weaver-embroiderer Missy Stevens live, work, play and generally hold court in a house distinctly their own. You might call it a folk-art production.</p>
        <p>First view is of the gabled garage with heart-shaped window, followed by a trellised arch dripping with vines. A flower-engulfed brick path weaves to a front door with the words Howdy and Butterplum incised in the door, its knob a chiseled heart. Although the house breathes a personal folk art existence at all times, come summer when the exuberant garden is in bloom, it soars.</p>
        <p>But the first compelling stop is inside, where the artists most reveal themselves, where there is space enough to paint, build, create furniture and rugs and then lay it all out. The interior presents ''an idea of what you do versus seeing a single object on a pedestal in a gallery,'' Mr. Simpson said. ''It's the opposite of masking or not letting people know who you are. We nest and work in a space that's an explanation of what we think and feel.''</p>
        <p>His newest book, ''Two Looks to Home: The Art of Tommy Simpson'' (Little, Brown/Bulfinch Press), ''tries to build a bridge between artists and collectors,'' he said. Pictured in the last chapter is a full-sized garden of fantasy sculptures created for ''Garden of the Heart,'' a traveling exhibition at the American Craft Museum in Manhattan through Sept. 3. The interactive installation, a 30-foot by 40-foot sculptural garden of 50 whimsical pieces, includes a gazebo, trees, fountains, carved plant forms and 140 feet of fanciful fencing with gates.</p>
        <p>Guests find themselves agog in the former studio, now a sitting-work-display room where pillow fabrics and rugs woven by Ms. Stevens, mingle with Mr. Simpson's rugs and tables. A table grain-painted with comb and eraser is shaped with snakelike tentacles or perhaps running roots and a permanent vase of flowers. A painted tall clock is based on a kachina doll from the Hopi, a bronze Giacometti-like stretched-out figures bears a gift, and walls are filled with Klee-like paintings, all with Mr. Simpson's idiosyncratic signature. A spin through the house becomes a trip of discovery: a dining table of irregular-shaped wood in trestle form, chairs in delicate organic forms, a master bed with a Shaker hymn carved into the headboard, the front board, a gospel song ''Seek, Seek and You Shall Find.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Stevens's wall-hung miniature hooked rugs are intricately made with sewing thread and tiny beads that ignite them. ''The loop pile embroidery, an Eastern European craft, is not common today; it is so labor intensive,'' Mr. Simpson said.</p>
        <p>Upstairs is Ms. Stevens's private porch and two-story weaving studio, one wall a rage of colored skeins. And above a built-in desk and work cabinets galore are her framed embroideries.</p>
        <p>Stone steps lead outside to a quaintly shaped garden gate with uneven branchlike spindles attached to a funny little scalloped picket fence above old stone walls. The garden's raised center section offers focus to what appears to be a well-organized hodgepodge jungle of plants like a Gaugin portrait.</p>
        <p>There are ornamental grasses in the liberated paradise, a dwarf peach tree and everyone's dream of a profundity of seasonal flowers crowding in, Mr. Simpson's fertility god scarecrow towering above. Against one garden wall, a gabled tool shed and small summer house with sofa add a never-never land aura, along with a slate-top table for warm-weather dining nestled among the raspberry bushes, birds chirping above.</p>
        <p>Theirs is a special eye and world. ''We created the house as a framework,'' Mr. Simpson said when asked to capture its essence. ''It's a sort of giving in to who you are thing.''</p>
