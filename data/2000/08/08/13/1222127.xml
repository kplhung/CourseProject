        <p>IN line at the supermarket, they're talking about Joe. In boardrooms and classrooms, the buzz is about Joe. At churches and synogogues, the topic of conversation: Joe.</p>
        <p>That's Joe as in Joseph I. Lieberman, Stamford native, New Haven resident, United States Senator and, now, a member of Al Gore's presidential ticket, and Connecticut sure is proud of him. Even die-hard Republicans admit to a little surge in state pride.</p>
        <p>But as the buzz about Mr. Lieberman's ascendance begins to fade, a question emerges: What took so long, not for the Senator, but for Connecticut, to get on a presidential campaign ticket? One of the 13 original United States, Connecticut until last Monday has gone more than 200 years without fronting a candidate for president or vice president. (Delaware and Rhode Island are still waiting.)</p>
        <p>''This is a breakthrough for Connecticut,'' said Professor Garrison Nelson, a senior fellow at the University of Massachusetts in Boston, where he teaches a course on New England politics.</p>
        <p>''Connecticut has always been overshadowed by Massachusetts and New York,'' he said. ''New Haven and Hartford and Bridgeport and Stamford are second-tier cities. They just don't generate the media interest that Boston and New York do. They get lost.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman's nomination has allowed Connecticut to escape the nation's political B-list of states -- 13 of the 50, including Alaska, Idaho and Nevada -- that have never produced a candidate for a presidential ticket.</p>
        <p>''Connecticut is the Rodney Dangerfield of American Politics,'' said Darrell West, a political science professor and director of the Taubman Center for Public Policy at Brown University.</p>
        <p>''It doesn't get a lot of respect. It's relatively small. It doesn't have the rich political history of places like Massachusetts, Virginia and Texas. It doesn't make a lot of national politicians.''</p>
        <p>In early 20th century, most presidential candidates were from New York or an adjacent state, and running mates were from Illinois or another swing state in the Midwest, not from relatively insignificant states like Delaware or Connecticut, said Howard Reiter, a professor of political science at the University of Connecticut.  ''We were so small that we just got ignored,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Though Connecticut has only 8 electoral votes (compared to New York's 33 and New Jersey's 15), that is more than several other New England states that have put native sons or current residents on a major party's  presidential ticket.</p>
        <p>Maine and New Hampshire, with 4 electoral votes, has produced four major-party presidential-ticket candidates, most recently Senator Edmund S. Muskie, who unsucessfully ran for vice president, along with Hubert  Humphrey of Minnesota, in 1968. New Hampshire, also with four votes to give, has supplied another four candidates, one Democrat and three  Republicans, including Henry Wilson, who won became vice president when Gen. Ulysses S. Grant won the presidency in 1872.Calvin Coolidge, a native of Vermont, a state with just 3 electoral votes, won the presidency in 1924. Chester A. Arthur, a Vermont native who moved to New York, ran for vice president in 1880 with James A. Garfield, and became president when Garfield was assassinated in 1881.</p>
        <p>The nature of Connecticut's olitical sensibility has also played a role in keeping its most prominent politicians off the national stage.</p>
        <p>A swirling mix of Democrats and Republicans with a large batch of Independents in between, Connecticut has long been a peculiar political petri dish that cultivated a reputation for fractiousness, said Donald Green, a professor of political science at Yale University. ''It's tended to be a home to both liberal Republicans and conservative Democrats, making it less attractive to their national parties,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Without taking too much credit away from Senator Lieberman and Vice President Gore, what helped Connecticut overcome these hindrances, political experts said, was time and technology.</p>
        <p>In the age of satellite television and campaign Web casts, voters care much less than they used to about which state a presidential candidate comes from, Professor Reiter said. ''People aren't geographically oriented when they vote any more,'' he said. ''It's more the personal characteristics of the candidates.''</p>
        <p>Gauging recent Democratic and Republican history in Connecticut, most political experts said it was no surprise that a Democrat broke the presidential-ticket barrier first.</p>
        <p>''Connecticut Democrats are a lot closer to the party mainstream than the Republicans,'' Professor West said. ''Connecticut Republicans tend to be much more moderate than the rest of the party, so their candidates tend to be out of the mainstream.''</p>
        <p>Still, despite technology and political chemistry, for a Connecticut candidate to be chosen for president or vice president, Mr. West added, he or she must have some special appeal to voters nationwide.</p>
        <p>''Lieberman had the integrity issue,'' he said. ''If he didn't have some personal qualities, I don't think he'd be on the ticket.''</p>
        <p>Though Mr. Lieberman is the first native son to wind up on a presidential ticket, he is not the first native son to be offered that mantle.</p>
        <p>In 1972 George McGovern offered Senator Abraham Ribicoff a spot on the Democratic ticket. ''He turned me down, said he'd rather be a senator,'' Mr. McGovern said last week during an interview on CNN's ''Larry King Live.''</p>
        <p>And Roy Occhiogrosso, an aide to Kevin B. Sullivan, the State Senate president pro-tem, recalled that  Lowell P. Weicker Jr., when he was a Republican United States Senator, tried to run for president in 1980, though he dropped out after just a few weeks.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Lieberman is clearly now is a Connecticut league of his own.</p>
        <p>Even some prominent Republicans say they have felt a twinge of exuberance since Monday afternoon, when Mr. Gore asked Mr. Lieberman to be his running mate, even though it is certain to make their jobs much harder between now and Nov. 7.</p>
        <p>''As a citizen of this state, I'm honored as everyone else is -- the significance of it is not lost on me,'' said Jay Malcynsky, a close ally of Gov. John G. Rowland and the organizer of George W. Bush's campaign in Connecticut. ''But I don't think it rises to the level of impetus for Republicans to vote for a Connecticut ticket. It's energized Republicans who are still intent on getting George Bush made president.''</p>
        <p>Senator Lieberman's ascent has been followed, moment by moment, image by television image, by several other high-ranking state Democrats with national aspirations, Mr. Occhiogrosso said. ''I think it makes a lot of people think they can do a lot of things,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But in the months ahead, there are still many political potholes that could blow the tires out from under the Lieberman Express.</p>
        <p>If the Democrats win, Connecticut could see another running mate, perhaps even a presidential contender, emerge soon, analysts said. If they lose, or Mr. Lieberman falters on the campaign trail, the state may be again relegated to the political shadows.</p>
        <p>''If he proves to be a strong campaigner, he will have broken the Connecticut jinx,'' Professor West said. ''If he self-destructs or proves to be a drag on the national ticket, he may be the last Connecticut politician to be nominated.''</p>
        <p>But there is another obstacle to Mr. Lieberman's ability to open the floodgates to other state residents seeking a spot on a presidential ticket. Because of its declining population, the state will lose a Congressional district, and a seat in Congress, beginning in 2003. Whose seat is lost will be decided by the state's General Assembly and Governor Rowland.</p>
        <p>But for the moment, voters here are savoring the chance to witness Mr. Lieberman define himself, and his home state, to 80 million Americans in the next four months.</p>
        <p>Who knows? Maybe Connecticut's ascendance will help others who are waiting in the wings, like Montana, Nevada and Idaho, to deliver a vice presidential candidate of their own.  Then again, said Professor Green at Yale, Idaho might be stretching it a bit. ''Idaho might be void of hope,'' he said. ''But apart from Idaho, yes.''</p>
        <p>Joining a Not-So-Exclusive Club</p>
        <p>NOW that Al Gore has picked Senator Joseph Lieberman as his running mate, 11 of the 13 original states have supplied a candidate to the presidential ticket of a major political party.</p>
        <p>Out of all 50 states, 13 have never been represented on a major party ticket, either by someone who is native born or by a current resident, according to  Professor Garrison Nelson, a senior fellow at the University of Massachusetts in Boston, where he teaches a course on New England politics.</p>
        <p>These states, Professor Nelson said, are Alaska; Colorado; Delaware; Idaho; Mississippi, where in 1948, Gov. Fielding Wright ran for vice president with Strom Thurmond on the States Rights Party ticket; Montana, where in 1924, Burton Wheeler ran for vice president with Robert M. LaFollette on the Progressive Party ticket; Nevada; North Dakota, where in 1936, William Lemke ran for president on Union Party ticket; New Mexico; Oklahoma;  Rhode Island; Utah and Wisconsin where in 1948, Mr. La Follette ran again, on the Progressive Party ticket; in 1980 Patrick Lucey, a former governor, was John Anderson's running mate on the National Unity Party ticket.</p>
