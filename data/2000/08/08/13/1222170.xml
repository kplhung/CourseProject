        <p>As Asian fever, cowboy cool, 60's modernism and vintage kitsch are all touching down on the fashion tarmac, a new fleet of books is taking off, on the quirkiest notions of chic. Style monitors have ventured to far-flung corners and brought back Ferlin Husky's dog-sled-embroidered jacket add Suzie Wong's signature cheongsam deress. The coffee table is groaning.</p>
        <p>Mighty Cool, Them Spurs</p>
        <p>Rhinestone cowboys and fringed cowgirls kick up their boot heels in ''Hillbilly Hollywood: The Origins of Country &amp; Western Style'' (Rizzoli, $39.95), a close look at what the author, Debby Bull, calls ''famous people you've never heard of.'' She refers not only to the wranglers who ventured to Los Angeles from the range in the 1930's through the 50's but also to Nathan Turk, Nudie Cohen and Manuel Cuevas. The three were expert tailors who specialized in the expertly cut, extravagantly beaded and embroidered stage clothes worn by the likes of Roy Rogers, Gene Autry, Patsy Cline and Elvis Presley.</p>

        <p>The clothes in ''Hillbilly Hollywood'' run the gamut from a marijuana-motif jacket worn by Gram Parsons to the understated black-on-black embroidery that is Johnny Cash's idea of flash. With a rhinestone-studded and die-cut cover, the book is as flamboyant as its subject.</p>
