        <p>Jazzlyn Farrell's mother does not let her ride her bike beyond the block she lives on, a narrow two-way street in Queens. So she makes a loop, back and forth between 105th Street and 106th.</p>
        <p>But as short as the rides are, Jazzlyn, 12, enjoys them because they give her a chance to enjoy the outdoors. She and her twin sister, Jenelle, spend most of their summers cooped up in the two-bedroom apartment they share with their mother and, now, their 4-month old sister, Starr.</p>
        <p>''Most of the time they just sit in the house and look at TV,'' said Rosalind Farrell, the girls' mother, who said the twins probably end up watching about six hours of television a day during the summer.</p>
        <p>Ms. Farrell, an administrative employee at 1 Police Plaza, reports to work at 8 a.m. She leaves the twins in the care of her sister Rhonda Fleming, who lives in the upstairs apartment of their two-family house. Ms. Farrell must squeeze in time with her daughters -- she enjoys taking them on picnics in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park -- after she gets home from work and on weekends.</p>
        <p>''Whenever they want to do something, they have to wait until 6 o'clock,'' she said.</p>
        <p>But for a few weeks every year, the girls get a chance to ride bikes longer and farther than they can in the city. They are participants in a program sponsored by the Fresh Air Fund, a nonprofit agency that has provided children from lower-income families in New York City free summer vacations since 1877.</p>
        <p>The agency runs five camps in upstate New York and places city children with rural and suburban host families from Maine to Virginia. For six summers, Jazzlyn has stayed  with Tony and Julie Falco in Marlboro, N.Y., in Ulster County. Jenelle began joining her there two years ago.</p>
        <p>Instead of waiting to see how many products a contestant on ''Supermarket Sweep'' can grab in a minute, Jenelle and Jazzlyn concentrate on  their underwater handstands.</p>
        <p>The program is supposed to last two weeks, but Jazzlyn stays for three, and Jenelle, who spends the first two weeks with a host family in Maine, joins her for the third week. There are so many children -- the twins plus the Falco children: Adrianne, 9, Julian, 4, and Svetlana, 6, a Russian girl they recently adopted -- and so many activities at the Falco home that the Farrell girls refer to their vacations as ''going to camp.''</p>
        <p>The Falcos volunteered to open their home because, they said, it could create a whole new world to a child from the city. ''It was a natural for us,'' said Mr. Falco, who grew up on Staten Island and owns a water-testing company down the road from his house. ''We had Adrianne at the time, so we were set up for children.''</p>
        <p>When Jazzlyn first came to the house, she was nervous, she said, and she recalled being a little scared during the hour-and-a-half bus ride with other children.</p>
        <p>''They already knew each other and they were all talking about how much fun they were going to have and how many kids that are our age were going to be there,'' she said. ''I was just crying by myself.''</p>
        <p>But once she got there, her jitters disappeared.</p>
        <p>''I really like the influence of her on my children,'' Mr. Falco said. ''She's very respectful, intelligent -- just a wonderful child.''</p>
        <p>While Jazzlyn is away from the city, she often lies down in the hammock on the back porch and listens to the sounds of the country while she rocks herself to sleep.</p>
        <p>''It's nice in the country, there aren't so many sounds,'' she said, standing on the back porch and looking out over the woods that surround the Falco home.</p>
        <p>Jazzlyn, who said she wants to be a pediatrician when she grows up, said her summers have changed her opinion of the country. ''Sometimes I think about if I should live in the country or in New York City -- I think about it a lot,'' she said. ''Because in New York City you can't really have a pool.''</p>
        <p>While the Farrell girls get a vacation, their mother gets a break from the rigors of raising a set of twins and can concentrate on her newborn daughter. ''I feel like I'm 20 again,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Adrianne has known Jazzlyn for nearly all her life. The two are close friends. ''We talk about our dreams,'' she said. ''We talk about what we're going to be when we're older.''</p>
        <p>Families who are interested in having a child stay with them or who wish to inquire about registering their children for a Fresh Air summer vacation may call (800) 367-0003 or visit the agency's Web site, www.freshair.org. Anyone interested in making a tax-deductible contribution to the agency may send a check to the Fresh Air Fund, 1040 Avenue of the Americas, New York, N.Y. 10018.</p>
