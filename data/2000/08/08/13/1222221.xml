        <p>IN peak season, farmstand-fresh vegetables often stand on their own. In each of these salads, they're used fresh, with minimal cooking, and given a touch of tangy flavor with a light vinaigrette and a bit of cheese. The cheese also fortifies the various mixtures enough to make them suitable first courses. But beyond that, the preparation is simple, permitting the vegetables to shine.</p>
        <p>What cooking there is involves quickly searing eggplant and zucchini on the grill for one, and softening fresh corn and chanterelles in a saute pan for another. The third calls for no cooking at all. It's only important that the vegetables be truly fresh: the tomatoes tender and juicy, the corn just picked, the cucumbers unwaxed and the zucchini shiny and firm.</p>
