        <p>Philharmonic Changes Directors</p>
        <p>Peggy Levin, executive director of the Westchester Philharmonic since 1996, is exchanging her Hartsdale office chair for a seat in the audience. ''After a 20-year career in the not-for-profit field, I need a break,'' she said. Philip L. Willis, formerly a partner in New Century Media, a company that helps emerging media groups, takes over as executive director tomorrow.</p>
        <p>Mr. Willis, a 45-year-old native of Manhattan, has had a varied career, including 11 years as the general manager of a public television station serving West Virginia and Pittsburgh and working for the New York City parks department. Music figured in both those jobs: the television station produced its own nationally distributed classical music series, while the parks department staged a Simon and Garfunkel reunion concert, among other events, while he was there. The new director has also held the stage himself as a guitar-playing, harmony-singing member of the folk music duo Willis and Rowlands. ''We were akin to the Eagles,'' Mr. Willis said, ''but we weren't good enough to make any records.''</p>
        <p>Barbara Dannenberg, chairwoman of the orchestra's board of directors, said Mr. Willis was selected from a field of 20 candidates after a national search. She said his strengths included ''his personality, which is low key but dynamic,'' and his ''very broad background in fund-raising and grant writing.''</p>
        <p>Tap Dancing in Tarrytown</p>
        <p>Tarrytown will soon resound to the tapping feet of 40 aspiring tap dancers from around the country. Lisa Hopkins, a choreographer and teacher, and Philip Stern, a composer, are partners in the Tarrytown-based company New York Stage Originals, which chose the ''tap kids,'' ages 9 through 20, through auditions. The youngsters will spend a week in workshops and master classes with experts like Gil Stroming, a former member of Tap Dogs, and will then present a show on Aug. 27 at 2 p.m. at the Tarrytown Music Hall.</p>
        <p>''There's a lot of jazz and ballet dancing around, but not a lot for talented tap dancers,'' said Ms. Hopkins, who is working with Mr. Stern on a musical called ''Tap Kids.'' Tickets are $15; the number to call for tickets is 332-5757.</p>
        <p>Other doings: the last performance of ''Meet Me in St. Louis'' will be presented today at 1 p.m. at the Yorktown Stage in Yorktown. The play, which features 50 children, is noteworthy because Anya Wallach, its producer, director and choreographer, is herself a 21-year-old college student. Tickets are $15 and $12; available at 944-8057.</p>
        <p>Dedication at Copland House</p>
        <p>A congratulatory mood prevailed in Cortlandt last Sunday, when the Copland House was dedicated as a retreat for composers and a wellspring for American music.</p>
        <p>Board members and benefactors mingled with musicians and local officials in the modest house that Aaron Copland called home for 30 years, while the composer's spirit seemed to drift among the trees. Grant Beglarian, chairman of the group's fund-raising arm, said that no other composer's house in the country has received such attention.</p>
        <p>Indeed, it was the outraged reaction of some music-loving neighbors when the property went on the market in the early 1990's that sparked preservation.</p>
        <p>A grass-roots movement led to the formation of the Copland Heritage Association, which brought Copland's trust together with the town of Cortlandt. Eventually a bargain was struck: the trust would lease the house to the town for $1 a year, and the association would restore and administer the house. ''It seemed like a harebrained idea at the time, but I'm glad we saw the light,'' said George Oros, a county legislator representing Cortlandt and Peekskill and a former town trustee. ''This house embodies American history, arts and culture and education.''</p>
        <p>Florence H. Stevens, president of the association, complimented Linda D. Puglisi, town supervisor, for allowing the house to be taken off the tax rolls.</p>
        <p>The high-minded event, which included wine and performances of American music, provoked mundane memories of the project's early days. ''All we talked about at the first board meetings was plumbing, the roof, painting, electricity and toilets,'' Mr. Beglarian said. Beaming, he added, ''That chapter is over.''</p>
        <p>While the roof no longer leaks, the house received a modest fix-up. It looks much as it did before 1990, when Copland died.</p>
