        <p>Lebanon's very limited deployment of soldiers and police into the south, far from stabilizing the situation along its border with Israel, is raising new uncertainties 10 weeks after Israel ended its 22-year occupation of the region.</p>
        <p>Despite weeks of international diplomatic pressure to do so, the Lebanese pointedly did not put their forces on the border when they finally sent them in on Wednesday. This has now drawn a rebuke from United Nations peacekeepers on the ground, who are hinting that their mission -- begun in 1978 -- could end when its latest mandate expires in six months.</p>
        <p>''Border security is essentially the responsibility of the state of Lebanon,'' said Timor Goksel, the spokesman for the United Nations soldiers, who fanned out in force along the border a week ago. ''This is a national, not international duty.''</p>
        <p>The border has been quiet except for daily rock throwing into Israel at the old Fatma Gate, a major tourist attraction that is increasingly annoying to the Israelis. Three Lebanese, including two journalists, were wounded by Israeli gunfire in an incident last week when a man on the Lebanese side lit and threw a Molotov cocktail over the fence.</p>
        <p>The various forces now in the area include 1,000 Lebanese soldiers and policemen, the hundreds of United Nations peacekeepers, Hezbollah guerrillas maintaining their own observation posts and -- on the other side of the frontier -- Israeli troops putting up new border fences.</p>
        <p>Lebanon's refusal to have its forces go all the way to the border is widely seen here as a move by Syria, which has virtually controlled Lebanon for a decade, to maintain pressure on Israel to return the Golan Heights.</p>
        <p>By leaving control of the border uncertain, this line of reasoning goes, Syria reserved the threat of possible future action by Hezbollah, or other proxies, such as Syrian-based Palestinian groups.</p>
        <p>The Lebanese government says it will deploy its troops on the border only in the context of a complete regional peace agreement, including the turnover of the Golan Heights, conquered by Israel in 1967, and the return of Palestinian refugees.</p>
        <p>International donors have insisted on the dispatch of government troops to the south. Lebanon has said it sent its forces into the border region only to keep peace among local Shiite Muslims and Christians.</p>
        <p>The task force ''is responsible for law and order,'' Lebanon's interior minister, Michel Murr, told reporters, ''and not on the border with Israel. The border is not our concern at this stage.''</p>
        <p>The Lebanese government has also told the United Nations peacekeepers not to set up positions at what had been border crossing points. Nepalese soldiers in the United Nations force were withdrawn from one such crossing. United Nations officials say privately that they suspect that the orders not to watch these points originated with Hezbollah.</p>
        <p>Israel has repeatedly complained to the United Nations about the Fatma Gate, where Hezbollah has deposited piles of rocks at designated stoning points.</p>
        <p>The Israeli chief of staff, Gen. Shaul Mofaz, warned that ''Israeli soldiers know how to behave'' if attacked, and Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh accused the peacekeepers of failing to prevent violence.</p>
        <p>A leading Hezbollah official, Deputy Secretary General Naim Qassem, described the stone throwing as ''a way for the Lebanese to express their rejection of the occupation.''</p>
        <p>In a statement, he dismissed the complaints to the United Nations. Israel, ''which has not succeeded in getting guarantees from the Lebanese state -- despite pressures, particularly from the Americans -- is trying to snatch up guarantees when and where it can,'' the statement said.</p>
        <p>Behind the scenes, United Nations officials are said to be sharply pointing out to the Lebanese that the Security Council resolution that authorized and extended the peacekeeping force in southern Lebanon, known as Unifil, also calls on the Lebanese government to extend its authority throughout the region and ''proceed with a significant deployment of the Lebanese armed forces as soon as possible.'' The latest resolution, passed on July 27, also looks forward to phasing out Unifil and replacing it with a presumably smaller group of observers.</p>
        <p>''What the Lebanese seem to be unaware of is that Unifil's end is near,'' a United Nations official said. ''Lebanon can't go on indefinitely ignoring its responsibility for the border and the border region alike.''</p>
