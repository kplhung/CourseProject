        <p>IT was just a small paint chip lifted from the woodwork of a rear porch of Lyndhurst in Tarrytown. The sample was examined, imbedded in resin and, along with other samples from around the residence, shipped off to the conservation laboratory at the Savannah College of Art and Design in Georgia. The chips would be sliced across and the cross section would be analyzed and photographed microscopically.</p>

        <p>IT was just a small paint chip lifted from the woodwork of a rear porch of Lyndhurst in Tarrytown. The sample was examined, imbedded in resin and, along with other samples from around the residence, shipped off to the conservation laboratory at the Savannah College of Art and Design in Georgia. The chips would be sliced across and the cross section would be analyzed and photographed microscopically.</p>
        <p>The samples were being collected by historic preservation students in a class in historic paint analysis led by Prof. Hector Abreu-Cintron.</p>
        <p>He had brought the class from Savannah at the invitation of David C. Overholt, an alumnus of the school and the restoration project manager at the mansion.</p>
        <p>The students spent almost a week going through the mansion with scalpels, paint charts and magnifiers in the study to determine the paint history over many generations of three families that have lived in the Gothic Revival building since it was built in 1838, including the family of Jay Gould, the railroad magnate.</p>
        <p>The report should be completed later this month, and the results will be incorporated into a new furnishing plan intended to refine the color scheme and provide a more accurate rendition of period colors.</p>
        <p>The mansion and 67-acre estate are run by the National Trust for Historic Preservation.</p>
