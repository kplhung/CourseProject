        <p>AS the coxswain, Russell Smith sat at the stern of the John Gardner. Four rowers placed their oars. ''Starboard oars hold water; ports row!'' Mr. Smith called. ''Ready all, row together! Together!'' The 25-foot boat began riding little waves off the beach at Avery Point in Groton. ''Together! Nice!'' he said as the rowers headed out into Long Island Sound.</p>
        <p>They returned about a half-hour later to greet Geoffrey Conklin of Old Lyme, who had arrived with a 17-foot rowing boat atop his car and two larger ones on a trailer. Mr. Smith, who is from Ledyard, eyed the Atlantic 17, which he would soon row some 20 miles around Cape Ann, Mass., in the annual Blackburn Challenge, named for a 19th-century fisherman who, separated from his mother ship by a sudden blizzard, rowed for five days, his hands frozen to the oars, before reaching shore. Mr. Conklin pointed out recent improvements (''Adjustable foot braces,'' he noted) by the Atlantic's designer and builder, Jon Persson of Old Saybrook.</p>
        <p>Mr. Smith, Mr. Conklin and the oarsmen do open-water rowing. Their activities include strenuous races and leisurely messabouts, which get their name from Ratty's remark in ''The Wind in the Willows'' that ''there is nothing -- absolutely nothing -- half so much worth doing as simply messing about in boats.''</p>
        <p>Open-water rowing is not the rowing most people are familiar with.</p>
        <p>''Open-water rowing is just about all rowing except racing down short, buoyed courses,'' said David M. Stookey, editor of the newsletter Open-Water Rowing. ''The latter is called flat-water rowing and is the provence of schools, universities and the Olympics.'' Open-water rowing encompasses recreational rowing, fitness rowing, row touring and ocean rowing, Mr. Stookey said, and many people row for years before learning there is a term for what they do. He compares them to a Moliere character who discovers that he has ''been talking prose without knowing it.''</p>
        <p>Open-water rowing boats ''are designed to take you through wind and waves,'' Mr. Stookey said, adding, ''Distinct from flat-water racers, open-water pulling boats can take you to someplace and get you home safely.'' The boats range widely, he said, from sleek open-water shells with sliding seats only inches wider than their flat-water counterparts to fixed-seat craft modeled after boats like the Grand Banks dories, which could keep fishermen safe on the open ocean.</p>
        <p>Even with new sliding-seat models like the Alden and Maas shells, there is a strong traditional aspect to open-water rowing, said John P. Stratton III of Old Lyme, who edits The Ash Breeze, the quarterly publication of the Traditional Small Craft Association. ''The vessels themselves are parts of long lines of exquisitely evolved craft,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In Connecticut, flat-water rowing is the more organized, better known sport, but open-water boats are being built, rowed and enjoyed, with at least two clubs devoted to the sport.  Mr. Smith is president of John Gardner Community Boating, on the Avery Point campus of the University of Connecticut, and Mr. Conklin is active in that club and the Connecticut River Oar and Paddle Club in Old Saybrook. Both clubs belong to the Traditional Small Craft Association, build and row fairly traditional models, and also use sliding-seat shells.</p>
        <p>The Avery Point group, organized last year, is named for the late John Gardner, who worked to preserve wooden boats, write about them, build traditional models and teach boatbuilding at Mystic Seaport. The club, which has about 65 members, has one boat in use, and members gather once a week to build a 13-foot Martin Skiff a circa-1900 model) with help from Robert Pittaway, a naval architect in Stonington. At regular messabouts, members use their own boats or the club's.</p>
        <p>The Connecticut River Oar and Paddle Club -- which has about 40 adult members and 30 to 40 junior members and is better known as CROPC, pronounced CROP-see -- was organized in 1983. It owns several boats, both tradtional and sliding-seat models. Members have built four boats -- one that is 22 feet 6 inches long and accomodates four rowers and a coxswaim, and three 21-footers that can each accommodate one, two or three rowers. Mr. Persson designed them.</p>
        <p>CROPC get-togethers include a New Year's Day row and a summer row across Long Island Sound. Every April 7 members make a four-mile nighttime row up the Connecticut River to Essex, re-enacting an 1814 raid during the War of 1812 in which British rowers sneaked up in the dark to burn 27 Essex vessels.</p>
        <p>President of CROPC is Jon Persson, who with his brother Rick operates Seth Persson Boat Builders, a business in Old Saybrook since the 1930's. Jon Persson designs and builds several kinds of boats, including open-water rowing boats that range from a 13-footer to the Atlantic 17. He said open-water rowing was a growing part of his business.</p>
        <p>For Mr. Stratton, of The Ash Breeze, Mr. Persson is building what he calls ''a somewhat experimental'' boat -- a 30-foot by 3-foot sliding-seat model designed for cruising the lower Connecticut River. ''It will have the capability to deal with motorboat wakes and the like, which a racing shell would be unable to do,'' he said.</p>
        <p>A few programs introduce young people to open-water rowing. At the Sound School, a regional technical high school in New Haven, students have built about 35 boats in the past 20 years. These include the captain's boat for the Amistad, numerous 18-foot dories and what Kenneth Donovan, who heads the program, calls ''the queen of our fleet,'' the 35-foot Sound, which takes six rowers.</p>
        <p>Besides having studies related to real boats, like physics lessons in which they compared the efficiency of four different rigs on identical boats, the students row, often in loosely organized events for traditional open-water boats.</p>
        <p>At Riverfront Recapture, a nonprofit organization in Hartford, high school students have been building and using boats since 1988, with recent products including three 16-foot dories. Fifth, sixth and seventh graders also learn to use the boats.</p>
        <p>In addition to its exhibits of traditional craft, Mystic Seaport has The Boathouse, with a livery of traditional boats that visitors can rent for half-hour or hour stints on the Mystic River. ''The livery is a good place to find out what it's like to row a really good traditional rowing boat,'' Mr. Stookey of Open Water Rowing said.</p>
        <p>Also at the Seaport are daylong programs on handling small boats and an annual small-boat weekend where people can see and try out not only Seaport craft but also the products of various small-boat dealers.</p>
        <p>Some towns offer open-water rowing programs, although most concentrate on flat-water boats. The Town of Groton's Parks and Recreation Department offers instruction in Alden sliding-seat ocean shells. ''They're not the little skinny racing shells that that tip over when you look at them,'' said Nancy Steenburg, an instructor. She starts her students in protected Beebe Cove, but quite soon, she said, ''They're out into the Sound.''</p>
        <p>Dana Avery, who sells Aldens and Maas shells at the Mystic River Boathouse on Beebe Cove, noted that while there are few organized open-water rowing groups in the state, there are many individual rowers and casual, informal groups.</p>
        <p>Said Gaeton Andretta, who sells Alden shells at the Small Boat Shop at Rex Marine Services in Norwalk: ''In Connecticut, if you've got a little rowboat, you can go exploring. You can put it on top of the car and take it to a different place every Saturday.''</p>
        <p>Biddle Morris of Mystic, one of many who venture beyond Connecticut, reeled off his rows to Block Island, around the Elizabeth Islands, and off the coast of Maine, in various shells and seasons.</p>
        <p>''It's amazing,'' he said, ''how far and how fast you can go.''</p>
