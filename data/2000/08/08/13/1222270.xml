        <p>ON a recent Friday lunch hour in Kmart's underwear department in Flushing Meadows, Queens, it was obvious where the action was. The aisles of billowy white panties were deserted. The racks of hip-hugger briefs stood virtually untouched. But a half-dozen women -- from chubby teenagers in capri pants to middle-aged moms pushing full carts of housewares -- were bravely shopping where few women had, until recently, shopped before: the thong section.</p>
        <p>''I'm liking this one,'' said Maria Mantalusa, 46, a nurse from Kew Gardens, who was shopping with her niece Kim, 25. She held up a baby blue thong with white stripes -- probably no more than three square inches of fabric all told -- against her generous curvy hips. The younger woman, whose array of thongs on little white plastic hangers already weighed down her index finger, nodded enthusiastically and said, ''You can't ever have enough of those.''</p>

        <p>ON a recent Friday lunch hour in Kmart's underwear department in Flushing Meadows, Queens, it was obvious where the action was. The aisles of billowy white panties were deserted. The racks of hip-hugger briefs stood virtually untouched. But a half-dozen women -- from chubby teenagers in capri pants to middle-aged moms pushing full carts of housewares -- were bravely shopping where few women had, until recently, shopped before: the thong section.</p>
        <p>''I'm liking this one,'' said Maria Mantalusa, 46, a nurse from Kew Gardens, who was shopping with her niece Kim, 25. She held up a baby blue thong with white stripes -- probably no more than three square inches of fabric all told -- against her generous curvy hips. The younger woman, whose array of thongs on little white plastic hangers already weighed down her index finger, nodded enthusiastically and said, ''You can't ever have enough of those.''</p>
        <p>Was it only three years ago that Monica Lewinsky shocked the nation by flashing her thong at the president? Or just a few seasons ago that the randy roommates on ''Friends'' traded reproving quips about thongs, comparing them to dental floss? Could that be the thumping bass of Sisqo's ''Thong Song'' -- a chart-topper since March -- piped through the sound system at the local mall?</p>
        <p>Once the sole province of pubescent underwear models and Rio de Janeiro beach bunnies, thongs, it seems, have quietly made it into the mainstream. Sisqo's racy video aside, the thong is going from a flag of sexual provocation to a common item in the lingerie drawer of even modest women.</p>
        <p>Victoria's Secret sold nearly 20 million thongs in 1999. Thongs and their even briefer counterpart, the G-string, now account for 40 percent of the underpants sold by the chain. Five years ago, it was only 10 percent. Even at Macy's, where the average shopper is older -- in her 30's and 40's -- thongs make up 20 percent of the total sales for women's underpants, said Carolyn Moss, director of ready-to-wear. That is a 100-percent rise in a year.</p>
        <p>''I know it sounds unbelievable, but thongs have become the core of our business,'' said Monica Mitro, a spokeswoman for Victoria's Secret. ''And it cuts across ages and body types.''</p>
        <p>The most popular style is a ''dressy'' black satiny polyester, Ms. Mitro said, but the second favorite is white cotton. Victoria's Secret is increasingly offering thongs in casual everyday styles, like polka dots and lily pad green. Lately, ''seasonal colors'' have been selling, even in large sizes.</p>
        <p>''Once it was the bolder girls who wore thongs,'' Ms. Mitro said. ''Now, that's not true.''</p>
        <p>It may seem surprising that a style so revealing -- and according to some, so uncomfortable -- would catch on in a population that on average has never been older or fatter. Bathing suit manufacturers attempted to import thong bikinis from Brazil a few years ago, but the trend fell flat. Women felt a thong was too revealing to wear in public. Yet, they began taking to them in private, wearing them under clothes, lured by their practicality.</p>
        <p>''In some ways you can trace the culture through its taste in women's undergarments,'' the fashion historian Valerie Steele said. ''What is sexy or practical changes in pretty dramatic ways as the mores change.''  Just as confining panty girdles expressed the repression of the 1950's and navel-baring bikini briefs seemed to epitomize the newfound sexual freedom of the 1960's and 70's, the dawn of the 21st century, when sex is numbingly omnipresent, is a time when underwear is threatening to disappear into the body's crevices entirely.</p>
        <p>The irony, as Ms. Steele notes, is that society's attitude toward underwear has come full circle. Until the 1860's, well-bred women didn't wear underpants at all, opting instead for slips and corsets. ''To wear underwear was scandalous -- only courtesans wore bloomers,'' she said. ''It was considered a sign of looseness.''</p>
        <p>Only with the introduction of the hoop skirt were underpants invented, as a necessity due to the skirt's precarious construction (after, say, a slip on the ice, the stiff hoop could send a Victorian lady's skirt sailing over her head). ''Now, after nearly 150 years of fetishizing underwear,''  Ms. Steele said, ''fashion seems to be dictating that it be invisible again.''</p>
        <p>Some of the thong's popularity can be attributed to changes in the clothing designed to cover it. Hemlines may have been long in recent seasons, but garments have, paradoxically, become more revealing. Innovations in fabrics -- Lycra and new stretch synthetics -- have tempted designers to make almost every article of clothing clingy. This has turned women's struggle against what Hanes in the 1970's dubbed ''V.P.L.'' (Visible Panty Line), into a small-scale war.</p>
        <p>''Don't even bother to try any of those on without the right underwear,'' a saleswoman advised a reporter touring Bloomingdale's to check out the racks of clothes shot through with stretch fibers. ''It'll just ruin your day.''</p>
        <p>To compensate for dowdier hemlines, designers have also slashed and cut skirts and pants to reveal skin in unlikely places. Designers from Stephen Tyler to Kmart's own Kathy Ireland have made skirts with daring slits, and slacks that lace up to show patches of flesh to the thigh.  ''You can trace the huge rise in thong sales directly to the rise in body-conscious clothing,'' Ms. Moss said.</p>
        <p>The fashionista pronouncement against pantyhose in recent seasons has also been a boon to the thong business. When tight skirts were voguish, in the early 1990's, they were worn with newly engineered microfiber stockings that had built-in panties. Not so now. Last winter, fashion magazines counseled bare legs, form-fitting skirts and stiletto sling-backs.</p>
        <p>''That's when I started to wear thongs,'' said Kathy Irise, a model, who was shopping last week at La Petite Coquette, the jewel-box lingerie store on University Place.</p>
        <p>Retailers attribute the uptick in thong sales to new ''intimate fabrics'' that make them more comfortable. Ms. Mitro said sales of whisper-thin microfiber thongs had been especially vigorous recently. ''They're so comfortable that you actually don't want to run and take them off as soon as you get home,'' she said.</p>
        <p>That wasn't the case just a few years ago. Back in 1998, when Shoshanna Lonstein went from being Jerry Seinfeld's ex-girlfriend to a fashion designer, her first line of frocks came with a pouch containing a matching hip-hugger thong.</p>
        <p>The idea was well received, but the thongs themselves ''were incredibly uncomfortable,'' she admitted.</p>
        <p>''I think people are making better ones now,'' she said. While Ms. Lonstein no longer makes lingerie, she conceded, with some consternation, that ''some people remember me better for that one thong than for all my dresses.''</p>
        <p>But the popularity of thongs is not merely a matter of practicality, it's a mark of the cultural climate. Even though thong underwear covered by clothes may be not be as racy as a thong bikini worn at the beach, it does show ''a certain confidence,'' said Bobbi Queen, the innerwear editor at Women's Wear Daily.</p>
        <p>She suggests that an increased interest in sports and fitness among women may mean some are prouder of their derrieres.</p>
        <p>Another factor is increasing Latin American and African-American influences on fashion and beauty that emphasize the posterior. Whereas low-slung bikini briefs came into fashion during an era obsessed with the Beach Boys and the slim figures of young white California girls, the thong rose during the rap era, in the early 90's, when Luther Campbell and his 2 Live Crew first filled videos with thong-clad women shaking it up at the beach. Now, Foxy Brown celebrates her own buttocks in a recent remix of Sisqo's ''Thong Song.''</p>
        <p>The thong also got a verifiable lift from Ms. Lewinsky. The tale of how she flashed her waistband at Bill Clinton was interpreted by the public as a symbol of sophomoric sexuality and bad judgment, but for some plus-size women it was heard as a rallying cry against the anorexic aesthetic of fashion magazines. ''If Monica can do it, I figure I can,'' said Ms. Mantalusa, the nurse from Queens. ''I may not be a model, but I'll bet I have a better behind than she does.''</p>
        <p>Whether it's a result of ethnic pride or more buff physiques, the rise of the thong reflects a new exuberance that many American women now feel toward their bodies, industry experts say.</p>
        <p>''I don't think it has anything to do with clothing,'' said Ms. Queen of Women's Wear, ''There are three big forces at work here. First, there is enough body consciousness in this country in terms of women working out. Then there is enough indifference by overweight women about how they look. Then there's a certain degree of exhibitionism. You put all that together and you get the thong.''</p>
