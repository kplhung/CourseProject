        <p>Serendipity Green</p>
        <p>By Rob Levandoski.</p>
        <p>272 pp. Sag Harbor, N.Y.:</p>
        <p>The Permanent Press. $25.</p>
        <p>ROB LEVANDOSKI'S hilarious swipe at small-town narrow-mindedness is the type of comic novel in which the characters might as well wear T-shirts saying ''Two-Dimensional,'' the type that stockpiles events as if they were blasts of helium blown into a balloon that's denied an explosive final pop. But so what? So what if ''Serendipity Green'' has more easy laughs than a clown parade? The laughs may be easy, but they're also very, very funny -- because Levandoski knows human nature never changes, no matter how modernized the externals, and because he knows the updated externals provide abundant joke fodder at a time when many an American hamlet is frantically trying to revitalize a town square made obsolete by that mall out near the Interstate.</p>
        <p>Although there are enough characters in ''Serendipity Green'' to populate a ''Where's Waldo?'' drawing, the four who hog the foreground are D. William Aitchbone, Howie Dornick, Katherine Hardihood and Hugh Harbinger. All but Harbinger are citizens of Tuttwyler, Ohio, a town intent on using its annual Squaw Days festival as a way of making tourism the region's No. 1 industry. The Squaw Days Committee is headed by Aitchbone, who is also a homeowner with property values to protect. So he's livid about Dornick, the only resident on posh South Mill Street who won't paint his house white.</p>
        <p>Indeed, Dornick refuses to paint his two-story frame house at all. In heated response Aitchbone, a practiced conniver, dispatches Hardihood, the local librarian (as isolated in her way as Dornick is in his), to persuade the unneighborly neighbor to clean up this residential blight. With the help of a rhubarb pie, Hardihood succeeds in sending Dornick on a trip to Bittinger's Hardware for a batch of mismatched paints. Whereupon Dornick, aiming to get the chore finished in quick time, mixes his purchases with ''six cans of 10W-30 motor oil, an almost full jug of windshield wiper fluid, a quart of Kingsford charcoal lighter and three two-gallon containers of something everyone in Ohio has plenty of, antifreeze.''</p>
        <p>He slaps the resulting sludge on his ramshackle home, turning it into a different kind of ugly. That's when Hugh Harbinger, once ''the design world's most coveted color consultant,'' visits Tuttwyler, scopes out the Dornick house and declares it an ''absolutely fabulous'' new color. Returning to Manhattan, Harbinger replicates Dornick's creative hue, trademarks it as Serendipity Green and makes it the shade everyone in the world wants to wear, to eat off of, to see automobiles finished with. Grateful for the inspiration, Harbinger sees that Dornick gets 50 percent of the proceeds.</p>
        <p>In this blunt, mocking, silly book, Levandoski (the author of a previous novel, ''Going to Chicago'') takes aim at standard targets -- hypocrisy, insensitivity, underhandedness. But while he makes sure that the foolish get their comeuppance, he stops short of condemning them. (He also arranges for the brave to reap at least modest rewards for holding out on stupidity.) To explain how he achieves his ends requires an unusually big nutshell -- especially to fill in the methods the new lovers Dornick and Hardihood employ for foiling Aitchbone's various long-range schemes. Another large nutshell is needed for the minor characters' shenanigans -- particularly those of Ernest Not Irish, a Native American anti-Cleveland Indians protester intent on exposing Squaw Days as politically and historically incorrect. Suffice it to say, this is a satire in which the quality of mercy is not strained, and neither is the humor.</p>
        <p>Along with its bucolic-America gags, ''Serendipity Green'' also includes a few sly takes on cosmopolites. Reminiscing about the trends with which he's wowed the beautiful and the would-be-beautiful people, Harbinger says: ''I've done over 300 shades of black. A lot of the epic shades. Bullet Hole. Virtual Death. Decompose. Black Maggot Woman. They're all mine.'' Just as Harbinger makes Serendipity Green the new black, so Levandoski makes ''Serendipity Green'' a stylish new black comedy.</p>
