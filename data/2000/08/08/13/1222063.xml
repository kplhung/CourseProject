        <p>IN the show ''Wanted: X-Cheerleaders,'' a squad of 10 real-life ex-cheerleaders rant and cheer about women's issues. Their routines, which feature flying pompoms, kicks and jumps, are at once authentic cheerleading drills and carefully choreographed movement.</p>

        <p>IN the show ''Wanted: X-Cheerleaders,'' a squad of 10 real-life ex-cheerleaders rant and cheer about women's issues. Their routines, which feature flying pompoms, kicks and jumps, are at once authentic cheerleading drills and carefully choreographed movement.</p>
        <p>''The piece is somewhat theatrical in that we have a script and an order, but it's not a narrative,'' said the choreographer Jody Oberfelder, who, with the director Kim Irwin, created ''X-Cheerleaders.''  ''What we're doing defies category.''</p>
        <p>Although ''X-Cheerleaders'' may not fall under the rubric of contemporary dance, it is exactly the kind of movement-dominated performance that is carving out a niche in the New York International Fringe Festival, which will envelop the Lower East Side for 12 days beginning on Wednesday. Now in its fourth year, the festival (on the Web at fringenyc.com), will present at least 40 theater shows a day at 20 different venues. Of the 180 shows, about 20 can legitimately be called contemporary dance or performance art.</p>
        <p>The best-known fringe festival is the one at Edinburgh, founded in 1947, which was created to give unconventional theater companies a chance to present their work. Today there are fringe festivals all over the world and in American cities like Seattle, Philadelphia and Houston. John Clancy, the artistic director of the Present Company, founded the New York festival in 1997.</p>
        <p>''The festival succeeds in the creation of a common meeting ground for artists, where artists can see each other's work and collaboration can take place,'' said Mr. Clancy, who heads a 30-member panel that selects applicants' work for the festival, contrary to the usual fringe standard of first-come, first-served. ''What we provide for the audience is challenging new work and convenience.''</p>
        <p>Although the New York festival is predominantly a theater event, dance companies like Ben Munisteri, Open 24 Hours/Pam Tanowitz, Neo Labos and Claire Byrne have performed there in the past. This year, FringeNYC will hold a symposium to discuss issues concerning choreographers and dance companies. The panel will include David R. White, director of Dance Theater Workshop; Laurie Uprichard, executive director of Danspace Project; Steve Greco, a committee member of New York Performance and Dance Awards (the Bessies); and Gus Solomons Jr., a dancer and choreographer.</p>
        <p>''In that first year, we made a commitment to dance, to multimedia work, to the old term 'performance art,' '' said Mr. Clancy. ''What's great about the Fringe is that it's a flexible beast.''</p>
        <p>For Mr. Clancy, ''X-Cheerleaders,'' which had its premiere at P. S. 122 in 1994, is emblematic of what Fringe NYC is all about. ''It's a perfect example of the emerging style of performances that do not fit comfortably into any category,'' he says. ''What do you call that style? It's theater, but it's dance.''</p>
        <p>In addition to ''X-Cheerleaders,'' there will be a collection of other dance-oriented performances. Tony Silva Dance and Music will present ''Air Born''; Falling Plaster will show ''Full Frontal Facts''; Caroline Jauch and Company are offering ''The Handless Maiden''; Artichoke Dance Company will perform ''Ho-Down Showdown''; Stratton Gonzalez Dance Theater will offer ''A Place in Line''; and Vickie Mendoza/vicdog 3d will show ''Three Worse Flowers.''</p>
        <p>For Ms. Oberfelder, Fringe performances are yet another chance to cheer on the blending of dance and theater. ''It's a funny thing with Fringe,'' she says. ''It's sort of outsider art in a way. Hopefully, what we do makes accessible the edgier kind of work that packs a punch.''</p>
