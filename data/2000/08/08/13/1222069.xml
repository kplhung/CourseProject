        <p>JUST past the busy shopping traffic of tony Southampton, on an obscure road beside the first fields where the Montauk Highway seems briefly friendly again, stands a pugnacious little windmill straight out of a cartoon ''Don Quixote.'' Beside it is a gravel driveway leading up a hill, where a squad of giant water jars from Java preside like fat sentinels, flanked by a 20-foot-tall chair, bright white and skinny as a reed, and a fishing-line sculpture resembling the prow of a ship.</p>
        <p>At the top of that hill, on almost any day in July or August, you can find Robert Wilson, the theater's sultan of slow (his stage crossings can take 20 to 30 minutes), presiding over an astonishingly animated beehive. Here, dancers and musicians practice sequences and phrases beside weatherbeaten sheds. Artists sketch and assemble stage models under a tent housing a giddy variety of chairs, all different from one another, while art photographers obsessively document them. Groups of young people rake, mow, prune and set tables for enormous meals -- until they are called to rehearsal by Mr. Wilson, that is, and instantly drop everything.</p>
        <p>''An institution is the lengthened shadow of one man,'' said Ralph Waldo Emerson. But what of a man who never stands still, and is as famous for the variety and international distinction of his many collaborators as for his own monumental creations? Perhaps such a bobbing, quaking, many-headed shadow is an apt paradigm for the ''institution of the future'' in a shrinking and sped-up world.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wilson is probably the most prolific theater artist in the world. An astonishingly tireless man who presents premieres of 8 to 12 new projects each year in an array of far-flung countries, he directs, designs the sets, co-designs the lighting and usually choreographs them all. He also organizes an army of loyal acolytes in the presentation of twice as many touring productions of older shows throughout the world. He estimates that he spends 10 days a year at his apartment in New York.</p>
        <p>For many years, critics have compared Mr. Wilson's majestically conceived, punctiliously crafted theater of slow-moving, dreamlike images with Richard Wagner's. Friends and detractors generally agree that this tall, soft-spoken man from Waco, Tex., did more than anyone else in the late 20th century to broaden public notions about the vocabulary of theater, and to keep alive Wagner's avant-gardist dream of a Gesamtkunstwerk that would demolish the borders between the discrete arts. Now the 58-year-old Mr. Wilson is building his own Bayreuth -- minus the nationalism and the exclusive dedication to the founder's work.</p>
        <p>The Watermill Center in Water Mill, N.Y., is a six-acre property that Mr. Wilson bought for $410,000 in the late 1980's and donated to his nonprofit organization, the Byrd Hoffman Foundation. Not yet open to the public, it currently operates only in the summer, and for several years it has been the birthplace of all his theater projects, including ''Time Rocker,''  ''Orlando,''  ''Hamlet: A Monologue'' and ''The Lady From the Sea.'' It is intended purely for early development, not for final performance of his shows, and it will not contain a fully equipped theater even when the $7 million reconstruction of its main building is complete. The finished center will operate year-round, housing Mr. Wilson's archives and extraordinary collection of art and furniture, and will serve as the site of international conferences, exhibitions and creative projects by Mr. Wilson and other artists. He hopes it will also preserve his legacy after his death.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, the life of Watermill is a bustle of intense creative activity, driven in no small measure by the obvious delight of his collaborators at having rare sustained time with him. He spends at least six weeks a year here, consecutive if not restful ones. His longstanding habit -- extremely unusual in the theater -- is to work on many different projects at once, jumping from one to another to another, sometimes in the course of a single day, and taking two to three years to bring each to fruition.</p>
        <p>Among those on the schedule for this  summer (in various stages of development) are: a work on ''sustainable life in the 21st century,'' commissioned by the Aventis Foundation (the charitable arm of Aventis, a German and French pharmaceutical company); an adaptation of ''The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari'' for the Deutsches Theater in Berlin; an adaptation of Gogol's ''Diary of a Madman,'' starring the prominent Russian actress Alla Demidova; the Janacek opera ''Osud/Fate'' for the National Theater in Prague; a production of Chekhov's ''Three Sisters'' for the Stockholm Stadsteater; and a musical called ''WillmS'' about the life, loves and death of Shakespeare, written by the veteran Broadway producer Edward Padula (''Bye Bye Birdie,''  ''A Joyful Noise'') and Robert Mansell.</p>
        <p>There is a certain droll solemnity in the atmosphere at the Watermill Center, beginning with the profusion of iconic objects scattered about the grounds. The most conspicuous of these are his chairs, hundreds of them, of every imaginable size, vintage and style, some obviously rare or unique, from Africa, Asia, Indonesia, early America. And some designed by him. They are arranged in precisely parallel rows beneath large white tents set up like a cloister, with two areas of empty flooring separating them, a square patch of bright grass in the middle, and neatly groomed flower beds and walkways on the sides. This is Mr. Wilson's temporary rehearsal arena during construction -- a sort of immaculate Chinese scholar's garden reconceived by a minimalist connoisseur.</p>
        <p>The center's three-story main building is a former telecommunications laboratory for Western Union, built in 1926 and once the workplace of some 250 people. This massive structure, too -- Bauhaus-boxy on the wings and, in the center, still brick-fronted with a dilapidated, concentration-camp-like watchtower on top -- is already something of an artifact. Currently a half-reconstructed shell (about $2.5 million must still be raised to finish it), its spacious, high-ceilinged halls are filled with methodical arrangements of wildly varied rare furniture and artworks.</p>
        <p>An exquisitely peeling and rough-hewn chicken coop door Mr. Wilson found on the street in Barcelona (think Ed Kienholz) hangs near a Zulu hat made of bright red human hair. A Noguchi rocker from Martha Graham's ''Appalachian Spring'' of 1944 sits beside ancient African fertility poles and a table Mr. Wilson designed for ''Einstein on the Beach.'' His own works blend in seamlessly with the priceless antiques. The place is like a fanciful ''please touch'' museum for grown-ups, where one may freely handle Bauhaus pottery by Hedwig Bollhagen from the 1920's, or a 4,000-year-old neolithic wooden figure from China, but the  shoes of Nureyev, Balanchine and Jerome Robbins are enshrined under glass.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wilson redesigned the building with the eminent architect Richard Gluckman (best known for his expansion of the Whitney Museum in New York and his renovations of the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh and the Georgia O'Keeffe Museum in Santa Fe). They have preserved the shape and square classical plan of the original but, to judge from the prominently displayed model, the new tone will be more severe and monolithic, with a tall doorless opening planned for the central axis, looking across the entire grounds to a circular outdoor arrangement of Stonehenge-like standing stones from the Indonesian island of Sumba. This marriage of the ancient and the austerely modern is obviously key to Mr. Wilson's preferred working atmosphere, as is the presence of all the cherished pieces by his modernist design heroes, like Frank Lloyd Wright, Buckminster Fuller and Gerrit Thomas Rietveld.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wilson's theater work has frequently been admired, particularly outside the United States, for its intrinsic internationalism. Primarily an idiom of powerful pictures set to music, to which spoken texts (of greater or lesser power) are added at the last minute, it incorporates material from widely disparate cultures and reaches across borders much more easily than most text-centered theater. The Watermill Center thus boasts a certain polyglot aplomb.</p>
        <p>AT the communal meals consumed under another large tent -- deliciously prepared on two hot plates and a propane grill (for 60 people!) by the Mexican cook Jose Luis Barreras and his Argentinian assistant, Laura Bejarano -- one hears a babel of languages: English, German, French, Spanish, Japanese, Portuguese and more. The scene in many ways recalls the retreats for training and communal creation founded over the last few decades by other international theater figures: Peter Brook (in France), Tadashi Suzuki (in Japan) and Eugenio Barba (in Denmark). What is unusual is to come across such a cosmopolitan enterprise on the East End of Long Island.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wilson explains his vision for Watermill by telling a story from his days as an architecture student at the Pratt Institute. Challenged by one of his teachers (Sibyl Moholy-Nagy, the widow and biographer of the Constructivist leader Laszlo Moholy-Nagy) to design a city in three minutes, the young Mr. Wilson drew an apple with a crystal cube inside it. The apple, he said, symbolized the organically formed ''medieval village'' and the crystal cube ''its cathedral,'' a central place of public congregation and learning. Watermill, he said, ought to be a ''village center'' and ''place of enlightenment'' in this sense, except that the ''village'' around it must be seen as global.</p>
        <p>He continued: ''Andre Malraux said after the war in France that he hoped, as a cultural policy, that they could maintain the following: a balance of interest in protecting the art of the past with an interest in protecting the art of our time; and on the other side of the coin, a balance of interest in protecting the art of the nation, the homeland, the community, with an interest in protecting the art of all nations.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Wilson raised his arms, as if to indicate these are first principles. ''It's so simple.'' To his frustration, however, such simplicity can be hard to explain to American arts foundations.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wilson is still bitter 16 years after the failure to raise all the money to bring together the many parts of his huge international project ''The Civil Wars'' for performance at the Los Angeles Olympics. (''They were afraid I was taking money away from the local arts organizations.'') ''Einstein on the Beach,'' he recalled, was commissioned by the French government in the mid-1970's and created by him and Philip Glass in Mr. Wilson's loft in New York (although it had its premiere in France). ''It would be not impossible but unlikely that the United States would commission two Frenchmen to make an opera in Paris. . . . But we have to support art wherever it's happening. We never know where it's going to happen.''</p>
        <p>So far, most of the Watermill Center's financing has come from outside the United States. Each summer culminates in a fund-raising benefit on the grounds, featuring an art auction and outdoor theater events staged by Mr. Wilson. This year, the party, on Saturday, will include an appearance by Paul Simon.</p>
        <p>The summer population of the Watermill Center fluctuates between 50 and 60 -- a mixture of administrators, established theater professionals invited to collaborate on specific projects, and interns. Most of the interns are accomplished students and emerging artists themselves who hope to work with Mr. Wilson professionally or simply learn more about his unusual working methods. Fifteen to 20 are hand picked by him out of about 100 annual applicants, and some 200 have participated since the program began in 1992.</p>
        <p>These young people are essential to the organization's smooth operation, living communally in rented houses, arriving before Mr. Wilson each year to prepare the grounds and buildings, and continuing to do housekeeping and maintenance chores throughout the summer. According to the center's Web site -- robertwilson.com -- this reflects ''the idea that an artist works differently in an environment that he/she has helped to create and maintain.''</p>
        <p>One does hear a bit of whining and grumbling about this arrangement, but much less than might be expected. All the interns seem to feel individually respected by Mr. Wilson and grateful for the bonds they are forming with him and one another. The working atmosphere in rehearsals is also curiously unhierarchical, with intern photographers, painters and art historians put to precisely the same uses as experienced actors and dancers. Ines Somellera, an actress from Mexico who has been invited to the center three times, still volunteers to do chores and insists that the place ''would never continue if it exploited people.''</p>
        <p>The center charges a tuition of $5,000, but Linda Jackson, the executive director of the Byrd Hoffman Foundation, estimates that the foundation finds scholarships for 90 percent of those who attend. Marianna Kavallieratos, a dancer from Greece, has been to Watermill nine times. She arrived this year with her 19-month-old son, Nikitas, confident that he would have dozens of loving companions. ''For me, this is like a second home,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wilson clearly enjoys working with these ambitious young people in ways that challenge their declared talents and expertise. His early pieces incorporated non-actors, and he is still intent on teaching others about the theatrical value of unexpectedly simple modes of being and doing. He chose a French photographer, Carole Fekete, for instance, to act in a scene from the Aventis Project workshop and then corrected her as if her metier were performing: ''Be careful when you sit. You're moving in your mind before you move in the body. You can't do that. The mind is a muscle.''</p>
        <p>The professional performers, of course, hope to impress him and be cast in the roles they rehearse in the workshops, and with them his corrections can be more severe: ''Please be careful not to express! If you try to express yourself, it's unbearable'' (pause) ''to me. First, just the movement. Then you'll feel it. The movement is already there. You can't start any movement, ever. The movement can only continue.''</p>
        <p>At one point, Mr. Wilson improvised a dance more than four minutes long (rehearsals almost never involve text at this stage, even when a script is available). Then, after a single demonstration, he asked the American actor Kameron Steele to reproduce it. Mr. Steele did so, quite accurately but necessarily with variations, and Mr. Wilson liked some of them and made a note to compare them with the videotape of his own version. The professionals are crucial to his work, not only because of such shared creation but also because he regularly leaves sequences in their hands to teach to the rest of the company, rehearse, and show him again days later.</p>
        <p>A typical day finds Mr. Wilson arriving in the morning to make a rehearsal tape for the Aventis Project with Michael Galasso, a musical collaborator for nearly three decades, after which he spends about 30 minutes with A. J. Weissbard, a longtime lighting collaborator, discussing final details of his design for the forthcoming Giorgio Armani exhibition at the Guggenheim Museum in New York. (He is carpeting the entire museum.)</p>
        <p>Next, he returns to the rehearsal tent to stage the prologue to ''WillmS'' -- a tableau in which the dying Shakespeare lies on a ramp, covered with an enormous rug, while his wife, daughters and lawyer hover nearby. Mr. Padula, the co-author, is visiting for the day and remarks that the scene is already so clear he could probably cut some of the dialogue. No one tells him what they all must be thinking: that all the dialogue may ultimately be unnecessary.</p>
        <p>MEANWHILE, Mr. Wilson interrupts his work to chide the company for leaving shoes, bags, food and water bottles around the audience area -- ''Please, I just work better in a room that has an order'' -- after which his stage manager reminds him that he has to call Russia. The call lasts for more than an hour (Alla Demidova will be delayed, it seems, and hence so will the entire Gogol project), after which he is pulled into a meeting on the photo spread he agreed to do for the Christmas issue of French Vogue. It will consist of scenes from his Paris Opera production of Mozart's ''Zauberflote,'' done with babies.</p>
        <p>No time to return to rehearsal, which continues without him in any case. He has agreed to conduct a performance workshop for children at a local television studio -- part of a serious community outreach effort he and others at the center have made in surrounding towns.</p>
        <p>Why does Mr. Wilson take on so many projects at once? ''I don't know,'' he says. ''I think it's just my nature. I can't work on one thing. I have to work on many things. Everyone asks me the same question.''</p>
        <p>Is there a cost to it? ''Maybe. But it's just the way I am.''</p>
        <p>His critics have certainly thought so over the years, frequently accusing him of falling into mannerism, facile repetition and factory production, and also questioning his basic assumptions about language (that it can be treated as merely one item among many in a composite stage vocabulary).</p>
        <p>For his part, Mr. Wilson finds the discussion of quality versus quantity tedious. ''I work on things over a long period of time. I start one thing, then I leave it, start another one, leave it, start another one, leave it, then I come back to one and I see it from a different perspective because I've been thinking about other things. But I've lived with it. It's been in the back of my head.''</p>
        <p>He pauses a moment to reflect on the Aventis Triangle Forum, a recent conference at the Watermill Center for business people and scientists. The forum dealt with the same subject as Mr. Wilson's new piece: sustainable life in the 21st century. ''Last week, I had 55 professionals here from all over the world, from Hong Kong, Japan, Latin America, North America, Europe. There were scientists, people in fields outside the arts, and these people usually meet in a rented room at a Hilton hotel. Here they are with all these kids running around, and they're eating with them, talking with them,  in a room with blue geese flying over their heads. It's mixing the arts with scientists.''</p>
        <p>That's the creative environment of the future, he insists, quoting the anthropologist Edmund Carpenter, who had visited the previous summer: ''It's like the academy of the 21st century.''</p>
