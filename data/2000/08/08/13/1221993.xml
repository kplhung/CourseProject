        <p>MIRIAM'S SONG</p>
        <p>A Memoir.</p>
        <p>By Miriam Mathabane</p>
        <p>as told to Mark Mathabane.</p>
        <p>Simon &amp; Schuster, $25.</p>
        <p>Miriam Mathabane's memoir covers similar ground to her brother Mark Mathabane's ''Kaffir Boy'': the struggle to escape the brutal poverty and the daily humiliations of South African apartheid through education. Spanning from 1969 to 1992, ''Miriam's Song'' focuses, in particular, on the hardships women faced, from the backbreaking chores to the constant (and culturally sanctioned) abuse by men, in a society where rape is common and early unwanted pregnancies almost a certainty. Mathabane was determined to achieve her modest goal of finishing high school and becoming a nurse. She recounts the nearly impossible odds against her -- sleeping on the floor of rat-infested shacks, meals of scavenged worms and weeds, daily school beatings, nightly police raids and a father who drank her tuition money -- as well as her efforts to surmount them during her coming of age amid the political violence of the 1980's, when the revolutionaries decided to make the townships ungovernable. Miriam Mathabane, deeply religious and nonviolent, had no choice but to join the struggle, not only to support her people but also to protest the inferior Bantu education that, ironically, was her ticket to a better future. Her searingly honest account of this period when the townships were under siege by both their residents and the government brings a critical chapter of South African history to life. Now studying in the United States, Mathabane told her stories to her brother, who perfectly captures her guileless wisdom.</p>
