        <p>WHILE millions anxiously await the outcome of the CBS program ''Survivor'' later this month, an entirely different competition is going on -- the race to see which of the cast members of this summer's hugely popular ''reality-based'' television production will succeed in securing a career in entertainment or the media.

        <p>Surprising the public -- and the bookmakers, who had given him seven to four odds on winning the $1 million prize as the final survivor -- the 30-year-old basketball coach from Willingboro was the 10th castaway to be knocked off the island in the South China Sea this month. Despite being portrayed by the network as ''lazy'' and ''a slacker,'' the dominant theory on why Mr. Peterson was voted off by his island mates was that he was considered the greatest threat and, therefore, had to go. That combination of a laid-back attitude and a fierce competitive streak might be just what is needed to navigate the path to success in Hollywood, laden with minefields as it is.</p>

        <p>WHILE millions anxiously await the outcome of the CBS program ''Survivor'' later this month, an entirely different competition is going on -- the race to see which of the cast members of this summer's hugely popular ''reality-based'' television production will succeed in securing a career in entertainment or the media. And like the speculation on who the last standing ''survivor'' will be, the edge right now is going to Gervase Peterson.</p>
        <p>Surprising the public -- and the bookmakers, who had given him seven to four odds on winning the $1 million prize as the final survivor -- the 30-year-old basketball coach from Willingboro was the 10th castaway to be knocked off the island in the South China Sea this month. Despite being portrayed by the network as ''lazy'' and ''a slacker,'' the dominant theory on why Mr. Peterson was voted off by his island mates was that he was considered the greatest threat and, therefore, had to go. That combination of a laid-back attitude and a fierce competitive streak might be just what is needed to navigate the path to success in Hollywood, laden with minefields as it is.</p>
        <p>Before his exile had even been broadcast -- to an audience of 27.4 million viewers -- CBS had swept off the tall, affable Mr. Peterson to Manhattan for what would be a string of interviews the day after the world learned he was a castaway. There was a reason for the the stutter-step: CBS prohibits the survivors from speaking publicly until the episode in which they are voted off the island is broadcast.</p>
        <p>Trading in his sweats, sneakers and bandanna for a Donna Karan suit, Mr. Peterson began his day on this particular Thursday morning explaining his island strategy to Bryant Gumbel on CBS's ''Early Show'': ''to do as little work as possible, be friends with everybody, coast through it, be nonthreatening and win.''</p>
        <p>Moving on to ABC, the former survivor confirmed for Regis Philbin that ''rat doesn't taste like chicken.'' Several interviews and three shirt changes later, Mr. Peterson was feeling his oats when David Letterman asked him if he would be returning to his job at the YMCA here. ''I'm outta there, Dave,'' he said. ''I'm about to blow up.''</p>
        <p>By Friday night, Mr. Peterson had returned to his tan aluminum-sided and stone-faced home in the Hawthorne Park section, where he lives with his mother, and, for much of the time, his 2-year-old daughter, Kayla. A few hours later he would turn around and catch the Saturday morning red-eye to the West Coast.</p>
        <p>In Los Angeles last week, Mr. Peterson played guest and host on several news and talk shows, taped a guest appearance on the ABC comedy ''The Hughleys'' and had meetings with the producers of the ''Early Show,'' ''Entertainment Tonight'' and at NBC to discuss job possibilities.</p>
        <p>''It's been absolutely phenomenal,'' said Mr. Peterson, who seemeed to be mainlining adrenaline during a break on his whirlwind tour. ''I've got my fingers crossed, and hopefully something good is going to come out of all this, but whatever it is, if it's doing commentating, or anchoring like Bryant Gumbel, or if it's going to be more toward the movies, any of it is O.K. with me.''</p>
        <p>Trying out for ''Survivor'' was no whim for Mr. Peterson, who has had ambitions to act, or at least be in the public eye, for some time. For the last year he has been studying acting, and wherever he goes, friends say, he has always managed to be the center of attention, even pre-''Survivor.''</p>
        <p>''People love Gervase,'' said Suzan Robbins, who works at the YMCA with Mr. Peterson when he isn't coaching youth basketball or helping in the fitness room. ''He's a likable guy and people gravitate to him.''</p>
        <p>A regular presence at the Y, the lanky athlete failed to take advantage of one place at the health club -- the Olympic-sized pool -- until he found out he would be spending up to 39 days on a strip of land surrounded by water. Then Jennifer Yoest, the assistant aquatic director, gave him a five-week swimming course. Though Ms. Yoest said ''he was doing pretty well'' by the time he left for the island, Mr. Peterson acknowledged that as far as swimming endurance, ''I didn't represent the YMCA too well.''</p>
        <p>Born in Philadelphia, Mr. Peterson grew up in Willingboro with three brothers and a sister. He spent two years at Lincoln Technical Institute in Pennsauken, and has worked as an auditor, a test technician for I.B.M., and, ironically, a field representative for the Neilsen ratings. He has had four children with two different women, the most recent being his 3-month-old son, Gunner, who was born while Mr. Peterson was still on Pulau Tiga Island this spring.</p>
        <p>The episode on which he was voted off was also one in which the remaining castaways smoked cigars to toast his new baby, then debated the ethics of having four children out of wedlock. Along with his physical prowess, the conflicted feelings some island mates had about his parental status could have contributed to Mr. Peterson's ouster, although he says he doubts it.</p>
        <p>''What does my personal life have to do with me getting voted off the island?'' he asked. ''At that point it was just whoever was the strongest was going to get voted off, and I was winning all the competitions.''</p>
        <p>In the round of interviews after his departure, Mr. Peterson was the first outcast to express any real distaste for the surviving contestants, particularly the members of the alliance that voted him off. Of Susan Hawk, a truck driver, he said: ''I just didn't like her. If you're not working as hard as Sue, you're not working.'' He called Sean Kenniff, a neurologist, ''totally clueless'' for voicing his plan to vote people off alphabetically, and described Richard Hatch, a corporate trainer who had a tendency to walk around the island naked as ''brutal.'' His quick wit and willingness to poke jabs at others could be another indication of Mr. Peterson's marketability.</p>
        <p>''I think he's got great comedic talent, he's extremely personable and he'd be very good at hosting a show,'' said Sherri Spillane, executive director of the Ruth Webb Talent Agency in Los Angeles. who is representing Mr. Peterson.</p>
        <p>With the girl next door/average guy image being ''the flavor of the day,'' Ms. Spillane's agency has carved out a niche in what she calls ''extending those 15 minutes of fame.'' The agency has even created the ''instant celebrity division,'' having signed 8 of the 16 ''Survivor'' contestants and looking at members of CBS's Orwellian ''Big Brother'' household as well. But Ms. Spillane said her first target was Mr. Peterson.</p>
        <p>''As soon as I saw him eating those worms, and those faces he made, a light bulb went off in my head,'' said Ms. Spillane, who has had no trouble lining up meetings with top television and film executives. ''I thought, this kid is going to be great.''</p>
        <p>Earlier, Mr. Peterson auditioned for a part the movie ''Swordfish'' that will star John Travolta, but he has never heard back and assumes he did not get the part. His dream role would be in an action movie opposite Salma Hayek. But in the meantime, he does not seem to be having trouble attracting the attention of the opposite sex.</p>
        <p>''I get recognized everywhere I go,'' he said. ''A lot of females approach me because I'm Gervase from 'Survivor,' but it's nothing major. It's not like I'm not beating them off with a stick or anything. It's just a lot of attention and I like that, as long as it's positive attention.''</p>
