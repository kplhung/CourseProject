        <p>CARACOL BEACH</p>
        <p>By Eliseo Alberto.</p>
        <p>Translated by Edith Grossman.</p>
        <p>286 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Alfred A. Knopf. $25.</p>
        <p>''DEATH,'' decides a tormented Cuban Army veteran, the lone survivor of an ambush during the war in Angola, ''is a quick way to cure madness.'' Now living in Florida and haunted by guilt and memory in the form of a winged Bengal tiger that stalks his imagination, he has already failed abjectly at suicide -- the latest attempt foiled by a stray dog that jumps on him just as he is poised to open his veins. The dog he names Strike Two, probably because it has prevented strike three, the exit he so desperately craves. Together they wait in an auto salvage yard for someone, anyone, to kill him.</p>
        <p>This desolate scene is the setting for the Cuban writer Eliseo Alberto's first novel to appear in English. But the bleakness quickly veers off toward the bizarre when, shortly after its opening, ''Caracol Beach'' turns comic, and the soldier's efforts to have himself eradicated become farcical. This is not, however, merely dark comedy about post-traumatic stress disorder; rather, it is farce with a point, much like the early stories of Gabriel Garcia Mrquez. Here too magic realism is in flower, but beneath its extravagant exaggerations lie serious observations about human nature.</p>
        <p>Reaching ''the plenitude of his madness,'' the soldier in the junkyard draws a wild assortment of wandering souls into his determined pursuit of extinction, to their eventual misfortune. While he plots his demise amid the wreckage that surrounds him, they ignorantly shamble toward their destinies.</p>
        <p>Several miles away, at the Emerson Institute, seniors are getting ready for their high school graduation -- or, more exactly, getting ready for the party that follows. After discovering the pleasures of marijuana and lusting after Laura Fontanet, a widely admired cheerleader, a nearsighted boy named Martin Lowell, who is the institute's top student, resolves to explore some of life's less studious pursuits, and commits his first ''act of true audacity'' by volunteering his parents' vacant home in Caracol Beach for a boisterous bacchanal. This move earns him the approval of the school's top athlete, Tom Chvez, and a kiss from Laura, and will put him in position for a fatal rendezvous with the preoccupied soldier.</p>
        <p>At the Bastille, a dive left over from the time before Caracol Beach became an exclusive resort, Zack Duhamel, a white Haitian tattoo artist who has engraved on the Cuban's arm the names of those the ex-soldier claims to have killed, begins work as the night bartender. Gigi Col, a prostitute, plans for her evening's labors. Langston Fischer walks his dog. At the police station, weary Sam Ramos, about to become the novel's moral center, takes a call from Mrs. Dickinson, the neighborhood busybody, complaining about peculiar sights and sounds at the Lowell house.</p>
        <p>One of Sam's worries is his son Nelson, now calling himself Mandy, who is both a martial arts expert and a transvestite. Mandy begins his evening at the Bastille by running afoul of a loutish Texan who, deceived by his fetching miniskirt, tries to pick him up. Back in the junkyard, the soldier feeds Strike Two, climbs into the only car in the auto graveyard that still runs and drives off to get himself killed.</p>
        <p>It takes an accidental kidnapping, an armed robbery undertaken ''for the sheer pleasure of the crime itself,'' a number of destroyed cars and several destroyed lives to resolve all this, something that Alberto, aided by Edith Grossman's smooth translation, does with panache. But what goes on underneath the plot is what makes ''Caracol Beach'' stand out, and here is where the similarity with Garcia Mrquez (to whom the book is dedicated and with whom the author has worked) is most apparent. This chronicle of several deaths foretold is finally about how Sam Ramos discovers his own humanity and deals with the complications of his own life. Near the end, he realizes that he has been engaged in ''the only war worth fighting: the one a man fights with himself to achieve the victory of being able to say 'I love you.' ''Surprisingly, as the last battles are fought, it's a war he may win.</p>
