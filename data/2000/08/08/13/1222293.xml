        <p>A SMILING concierge in the lobby directed Debra Paget toward the eighth-floor lounge, a sumptuous room, where she plunged into a cushy banquette.

        <p>A SMILING concierge in the lobby directed Debra Paget toward the eighth-floor lounge, a sumptuous room, where she plunged into a cushy banquette. Sitting with a friend amid fountains, pink orchids and filigreed screens, she might have been at the Four Seasons Hotel, waiting for a waiter to bring her a cocktail. In fact, Ms. Paget was waiting to see her gynecologist, whose office was tucked at the rear of the lounge behind a high ash-panel wall.</p>
        <p>This was the reception room at the Laurance S. Rockefeller Pavilion, a satellite clinic built last year by Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. The pavilion offers diagnosis and treatment for cancer in a setting that is part luxury hotel, part Zenlike retreat. And for Ms. Paget it represents a marked improvement over Sloan-Kettering's main hospital cluster half a mile uptown, where she was treated last year for ovarian cancer.</p>
        <p>Sloan-Kettering, with its narrow corridors and shabby furniture, was ''like a bad scene from a 1950's movie,'' she recalled with a shudder. Each time she visited, her blood pressure spiked. Now, when she arrives at the pavilion waiting room for her quarterly post-treatment checkup, the roar in her head has subsided to a hum.</p>
        <p>Of course, a fancy waiting room, even one with haiku engraved on the walls, does not quite alleviate the stress of being treated for cancer.</p>
        <p>''You know what you're here for, and no amount of design will ever get your mind past that,'' said Ms. Paget, 45, a program manager for I.B.M.</p>
        <p>Even so, more and more medical centers are keeping step with the Rockefeller Pavilion, revamping their decor and introducing luxury services to bolster the spirits of patients and give them a sense of well-being. In recent years, doctors and hospitals have integrated alternative and Eastern-influenced treatments with conventional Western medicine. Now, they are extending that holistic approach to the look and feel of the clinical environment.</p>
        <p>Think of it as the aesthetic equivalent of acupuncture. In the New York City area, health care institutions and a spate of wellness centers are wooing patients with amenities like on-the-site hair salons, Zen tearooms and lavish kimonos, which make chilly clinics and consulting rooms seem as dated as high-button shoes. Efforts to warm the atmosphere vary from place to place. But at wellness resorts and even in traditional hospitals, patients find the mellow lighting, waterfalls, vanilla-scented candles and sea grass common at a New Age spa.</p>
        <p>Even uniforms have been made over with cheery patterns and bright colors, reinforcing the impression that the hospital staff is as friendly and accessible as, say, one's favorite hairdresser.</p>
        <p>To hear it from some physicians, medicine's new emphasis on style is long overdue. Among the leading proponents of soul-soothing decor is Mehmet Oz, a cardiothoracic surgeon and an outspoken champion of healing through design.</p>
        <p>''There is no question that in the past we have undervalued the aesthetics of care,'' said Dr. Oz, whose office at New York Presbyterian Hospital is furnished with Oriental carpets and wood paneling. ''I wanted my patients to feel they were in my house,'' Dr. Oz said. ''If I could put a fire in the corner, I would.'' New Age chimes tinkle on the sound system, and the scent of coconut wafts from the corridors into the consulting room, where patients can gaze out at the Hudson River.</p>
        <p>The Integrative Health Center at the Rockefeller Pavilion is similarly airy, offering acupuncture and massage as well as chemotherapy in a room painted with blue skies and scudding clouds. Other clinics have an earthier feel. Natural materials like slate and silvered wood cover almost every surface at the SoHo Integrative Health Center on Crosby Street in Manhattan, which opened this month. Run by Dr. Laurie Polis, a dermatolgist, the center is filled with the reassuring sights, sound and scents of nature.</p>
        <p>''I wanted to dispel anxieties that rise from memories of walking down a sterile hallway, a nurse in white shoes coming at you with a syringe,'' Dr. Polis said.</p>
        <p>Determined to create an anticlinical environment, she commissioned Clodagh, an architectural designer known for her woodsy spa interiors and stores, to create a setting that evokes a Zen garden and a rain forest. Its focal point is a 27-foot wall of water that plunges from the upper floors to the lobby.</p>
        <p>Patients awaiting the removal of skin lesions or a consultation with the house internist or ophthalmologist can steady their nerves with a facial, a seaweed wrap or a visit to Steven Dillon, the center's own hair guru. Cocooned in sand-color terry-lined robes, the patients, who are called ''clients,'' sit in the waiting area sipping iced green tea and inhaling the house fragrance, a blend of ginger and passion flowers.</p>
        <p>A similar hush pervades the Continuum Center for Health and Healing, an outpatient clinic of the Beth Israel Medical Center in New York. Opened last June at Fifth Avenue and 28th Street, the center offers traditional Western medical treatments alongside Eastern therapies in an environment that looks like a Hong Kong hotel.</p>
        <p>Tibetan carpets, rough-hewn wooden benches and a weeping fig tree, among other features, were installed at the suggestion of Alex Stark, a New York feng shui specialist. Chinese cabinets, fountains and a limestone corridor make the reception area feel like a sanctuary, compelling visitors to lower their voices.</p>
        <p>Across the Hudson, at Hackensack University Medical Center, Suzen Heeley, the hospital's designer, was so infatutated with the spa concept that she installed a health resort on the premises. Hackensack's Beyond Day Spa, which she says is the first spa inside a hospital, opened in June. It borrows liberally from the Asian design themes and the treatment menus of upscale health resorts like the Peninsula and Bliss in Manhattan. As its news release perhaps too chipperly announces, ''Here is a place where women can schedule a morning massage and manicure, and an afternoon mammography.''</p>
        <p>She can also retreat to the Shangri-La-style meditation room to sip rosebud tea through a perforated silver straw and sample a sugar bath with litchi, one of the bath products offered by brands like Fresh, Lazar tigue and Creed.</p>
        <p>Some of the services are extended to patients in the adjacent hospital building. Those who cannot get to the Beyond Day Spa can enjoy a bedside facial while watching seascapes and sailboats on television sets tuned to the Relaxation Channel.</p>
        <p>Medical chic has found its way around the country, too. At Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago, picture windows with lakefront views are among the luxurious features that were built into each room when the hospital was redesigned last year. Other comforts include corner shelves to hold cards and flowers, carpeted corridors, $30,000 patient beds that convert to easy chairs and plush window seats that fold out for family members who stay the night. The hospital says the cost for such features, which are partly paid for by benefactors, will not be passed on to patients.</p>
        <p>When Northwestern's Women's Hospital, part of a $580 million hospital development project, opens in 2004, painted landscapes will decorate the ceilings in patient rooms. ''Research has shown that patients who look at boats and beaches in pre-op do much better in surgery,'' said Alice Domar, director of the Center for Women's Health at the Mind Body Medical Institute of Harvard University. Dr. Domar consulted with architects on the hospital's design. ''Women especially are conscious of aesthetics,'' she said. ''If the room looks good, it makes them feel more confident in the hospital.''</p>
        <p>It also makes them feel at home. Hoping to create an aura of cozy domesticity, designers at Roosevelt St. Luke's Hospital on New York's West Side decorated the labor rooms in the childbirth center in festive chintz. The flower-pattern curtains and bedspreads, winged chairs and rockers look better suited to a bed-and-breakfast in the Cotswolds than to a delivery room.</p>
        <p>In lieu of hospital gowns, St. Luke's maternity patients are encouraged to wear their own nightclothes. At most hospitals and clinics patients must still wear shapeless gowns in dispiriting shades of teal and gray.</p>
        <p>Hackensack Hospital has commissioned Nicole Miller, a designer known for animated prints, to give the classic gown a makeover. Ms. Miller's breezy trousers, shorts and kimonos are patterned with needles and stethoscopes. Not exactly calming but more uplifting than standard-issue hospital blue.</p>
        <p>By far the most animated looks in hospital halls are uniforms, which are turning up in a giddy explosion of colors. ''Five years ago, my sales reps around the country were only selling teal blue and misty green,'' said Alan Kay, the president of Howard Uniforms, a distributor of hospital scrubs. ''Now, there are 20 or 25 colors, and there must be 100 prints.''</p>
        <p>Hot orchid and flamingo pink have lately turned up as alternatives to washed-out pastels, which were originally designed to help patients distinguish nurses from X-ray technicians. Companies with names like Feel Good Scrubs Wear and Crazy Scrubs, show products on the Web, selling colorful uniforms and manic prints, including tie-dye designs and Hawaiian florals.</p>
        <p>''These things are done mostly for the patient,'' Mr. Kay said. ''Bright uniforms cheer them up and make them feel more comfortable.''</p>
        <p>The health care industry's new emphasis on more stylish settings also has a profit motive. To lure and keep clients who might otherwise have defected to one of Manhattan's tonier wellness centers, Jack Ferguson, the president of Hackensack University Hospital, keeps one eye fixed on image, the other on the bottom line.</p>
        <p>''We want to do everything with style and class, from installing mahogany paneling in the hospital's main lobby to providing high-quality products at the spa,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He expects his efforts to pay off and thinks the spa will clear $50,000 in its first year. The funds are funneled back to the hospital to pay for new facilities, Mr. Ferguson said.</p>
        <p>Clients at Hackensack and elsewhere around the country readily pay for small luxuries like a reiki massage ($45) at the Rockefeller Pavilion or a warm cream pedicure at the Beyond Day Spa in Hackensack ($35), where the price of a single room is $1,600 a day.</p>
        <p>Marie Tortoriello, who spent a week with her husband, William, at Northwestern Memorial Hospital, where he had surgery, seemed enchanted with their $950-a-night room. ''We felt like we were in a hotel,'' she said. Among the features that impressed her were deep picture windows and a wing chair with an ottoman. ''It was as though they were part of a Victorian parlor,'' she said. ''It wasn't the hospital look at all, and that makes such a difference.''</p>
