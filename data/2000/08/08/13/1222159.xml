        <p>OVER his career, Will Barnet has shown himself to be very comfortable with pendulum swings. A retrospective at the Montclair Art Museum shows Mr. Barnet, 89, to be a dedicated realist painter but also a disciple of abstraction -- sometimes both at once.</p>
        <p>The retrospective, ''Will Barnet: A Timeless World'' begins in 1929, with a meticulous charcoal study of a nude male done while the artist was a student at the Boston Museum School. The drawing emphasizes volume, in contrast to the flatness characterizing most of his subsequent work. It also features strong light, and light in different forms has always figured prominently in his art. Prints from the 1930's show that Mr. Barnet was in league with the widespread practice of social realism. These, which include ''Fulton Street Fish Market'' and ''Little Tailor,'' depict various trades. Mr. Barnet also depicted his parents, and his expanding, at times contentious, family continued to star in his art.</p>

        <p>OVER his career, Will Barnet has shown himself to be very comfortable with pendulum swings. A retrospective at the Montclair Art Museum shows Mr. Barnet, 89, to be a dedicated realist painter but also a disciple of abstraction -- sometimes both at once.</p>
        <p>The retrospective, ''Will Barnet: A Timeless World'' begins in 1929, with a meticulous charcoal study of a nude male done while the artist was a student at the Boston Museum School. The drawing emphasizes volume, in contrast to the flatness characterizing most of his subsequent work. It also features strong light, and light in different forms has always figured prominently in his art. Prints from the 1930's show that Mr. Barnet was in league with the widespread practice of social realism. These, which include ''Fulton Street Fish Market'' and ''Little Tailor,'' depict various trades. Mr. Barnet also depicted his parents, and his expanding, at times contentious, family continued to star in his art.</p>
        <p>Gail Stavitsky, the Montclair curator who organized the retrospective, notes that the 1935 lithograph of a boy called ''Little Joe'' is indebted to Modigliani, and inspiration from a wide variety of artists is a thread that goes through Mr. Barnet's oeuvre. Paradoxically, because it alludes to such a variety of sources, his vision turns out not to be derivative as it might with another artist; rather it is singular, and oddly of a piece despite all the stylistic changes. Much credit must be given his devotion to line, angular and sinuous.</p>
        <p>The expressive use of color is a complementary force. Paintings from the 1940's, among them ''Family and Pink Table (Mary and Sons)'' and ''Summer Family,'' are indebted to the Synthetic Cubism of Picasso. ''Family and Pink Table'' has a gaudiness, albeit a pastel one, reminiscent of Picasso's's famous ''Three Musicians.'' But it's part of an adept colorist's bag of tricks to deny color and still be chromatic. Close values of gray, brown or steel blue distinguish some of the more recent paintings, and by suppressing color Mr. Barnet can get more poetic expressiveness out of his line.</p>
        <p>In the 1950's Mr. Barnet fully explored a long-held enthusiasm for the abstract designs of American Indian pottery. With him, as well as with several other artists as colleagues, the enthusiasm became full-blown; it was given a rather metaphysical name, Indian Space Painting. Shapes were spare and flatly painted but also invested with dynamism in the manner of American Indian designs. The interest in native cultures was a widespread one in the 50's. Abstract Expressionists, like Adolph Gottlieb, used Indian spatial concepts as the basis of their art and Mr. Barnet's achievements in the 1950's to a great extent mirrored Abstract Expressionism's geometric side.</p>
        <p>The figure re-emerged in Mr. Barnet's art in the early 1960's, but this time, instead of being purposefully distorted, it is characterized by sinuous contours and areas filled in with blocks of color. There is an idealism to these characters, most of whom are women, but Mr. Barnet also individualized the figures through precise facial expressions that sometimes speak volumes about a character's feelings. A strong influence from Asian art is evident, not least because the compositions have a quietness about them. This soft attitude is fostered by the inclusion of a svelte cat or cats in many of the paintings.</p>
        <p>These compositions can be both seductive and soothing, which might account for their great popularity when they were made into affordable posters. An exception to the sedateness is the portrait of Roy Neuberger, a Wall Street tycoon and major patron of the arts. Mr. Barnet makes Mr. Neuberger look imperial, his office chair becomes a throne.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barnet strove for poignancy and the chilling feeling of German Romanticism in the 1970's in pictures of women in Maine looking toward the sea, waiting for their husbands to return. Rendered with clarity, as always, these paintings don't quite convince. There is a big narrative implicit in them, but Mr. Barnet relates it in a clipped, precise way that veers toward illustration.</p>
        <p>More successful and appealing are figural paintings from the 1990's, which recognize that flat color and a stress on line are characteristics of naive art, and a painting like ''Croquet'' evokes Henri Rousseau. ''The Purple Bottle'' (1999) is a mild, but pleasing venture into Surrealism. The artist has his arm around the woman who holds the eponymous bottle in the canvas he's painting. In bringing her to life, Mr. Barnet is a sort of Pygmalion, which is a fine reward for his long, vital career.</p>
        <p>He is lucky to have his retrospective at the Montclair Art Museum, because it has a fine collection of work by artists with whom he has explored ideas. There is enough of this related work to comprise a second, ancillary show, ''Will Barnet in Context.'' The diversity is bracing: from the near-academic figuration of Raphael Soyer to the careering compositions of Steve Wheeler, which celebrate American Indian art. A show stopper is an Indian pictograph-based painting by Adolph Gottlieb, ''Spectre of the Sea'' and its pervasive otherworldly green.</p>
