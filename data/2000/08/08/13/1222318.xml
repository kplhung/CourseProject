      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>I am very concerned about the efforts that are underway to save the two buildings at Cigna's Bloomfield campus due to their architectural style and significance (''A Fight Over, of All Things, an Insurance Office,'' July 16). In fact, it has been suggested that both Bloomfield and the world would be a lesser place if these buildings were removed. While the significance of these buildings can be debated, the real issue is the future of Bloomfield.</p>
        <p>Cigna's Bloomfield campus is a large predominantly undeveloped tract of land and Cigna has put forth a plan so well conceived and so well designed that if it is executed it will signal a rebirth of the town.</p>

        <p>I am very concerned about the efforts that are underway to save the two buildings at Cigna's Bloomfield campus due to their architectural style and significance (''A Fight Over, of All Things, an Insurance Office,'' July 16). In fact, it has been suggested that both Bloomfield and the world would be a lesser place if these buildings were removed. While the significance of these buildings can be debated, the real issue is the future of Bloomfield.</p>
        <p>Cigna's Bloomfield campus is a large predominantly undeveloped tract of land and Cigna has put forth a plan so well conceived and so well designed that if it is executed it will signal a rebirth of the town.</p>
        <p>It will present opportunities for controlled growth and development that other towns can only dream about. It is a commitment of significant resources that in today's world few companies are willing to make to the towns in which they reside. But Cigna has put forth a plan that will benefit the town for more than just the next few decades; it will bring a new light to the future.</p>
        <p>Like most towns, Bloomfield worries about whether its corporate taxpayers will be lured away by other towns offering more. But in Bloomfield we have found out that our largest taxpayer is more than just another large corporation; it is a concerned citizen. Cigna has been a resident of Bloomfield for more than 40 years and it is apparent that the company cares about this town as much as any long-term resident.</p>
        <p>I believe that the people putting forth the idea that two of the buildings be saved are not so much interested in the architectural history of these buildings as they are in simply stopping Cigna and the town from moving into the future.</p>
