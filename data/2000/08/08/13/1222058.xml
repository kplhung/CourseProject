        <p>WHEN Stanley Tong left his hometown for Hollywood in 1996, Hong Kong's film industry was headed for a crack-up as spectacular as anything in a Jackie Chan movie.</p>
        <p>Box office revenue was plummeting, scripts were threadbare and rampant piracy was driving a whole generation of movie-watchers away from theaters. Demoralized by the grinding pace and stultifying atmosphere of Hong Kong, local filmmakers fled this former British colony faster than the British themselves.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tong, a 40-year-old former stuntman who directed Mr. Chan in hyper-kinetic Hong Kong action films like ''Rumble in the Bronx'' (1996) and ''Police Story III: Supercop'' (1992), did not easily find success in the United States. His first American film, ''Mr. Magoo,' (1997) a $30 million Disney remake of the 1960's cartoon about a crotchety, near-sighted old goof, left audiences as befuddled as its hapless hero.</p>
        <p>Now, Mr. Tong has returned to Hong Kong and is back on familiar ground -- shooting an action film about the Chinese police busting a smuggling ring.</p>
        <p>''I went to America because I wanted to learn how to make Hollywood movies,'' Mr. Tong said. ''But I always wanted to come back to where I grew up. I want to make Chinese films for an international audience.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Tong is one of several Hong Kong filmmakers who have come home this year. Some were disillusioned with the vagaries of Hollywood. Others have been lured by the new money that is sloshing around since the end of the Asian economic crisis. Still others missed the frenetic energy and anything-goes culture of making movies here. Whatever their reasons, these prodigal sons of Hong Kong cinema -- most are men -- hope to revive an industry that had been left for dead two years ago.</p>
        <p>''There is an optimism here which hasn't existed for a long time,'' said Wouter Barendricht, a sales agent for Asian movies who runs the Hong Kong-Asia Film Financing Forum. ''People were in such shock about the state of the industry that nothing happened for several years.''</p>
        <p>After tumbling to $100 million last year from $167 million in 1993, Hong Kong's box office receipts are likely to bounce back to $130 million this year, according to the Hong Kong Motion Picture Industry Association. The industry will release 130 films in 2000, one-third more than last year. At its peak, in the early 1990's, this movie-mad city cranked out 230 films a year.</p>
        <p>Hong Kong's resurgence has been driven by several factors. After two years of recession, money is pouring back into film production. Some comes from old-line Hong Kong production companies, which are restyling themselves as Internet companies and desperately need ''content.'' Some comes from Hollywood studios, like Columbia Pictures, which have set up local operations to finance Asian films.</p>
        <p>The industry has also been helped by Hong Kong's belated crackdown on piracy. Under heavy pressure from the United States and the local film industry, the new Chinese government has raided the producers of illegally copied video compact discs. Movie executives say the campaign has worked: with bootleg VCD's drying up, people are paying to see popular films at the multiplex.</p>
        <p>Harder to quantify, but also important, was Hong Kong's relatively smooth transition from British to Chinese rule. Local studios that had cut back their spending in 1997 out of fear that China might curtail freedoms relaxed after it became clear that Beijing did not plan to meddle in the territory.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the most basic reason is better movies. After a long stretch of derivative action movies, Hong Kong is starting to turn out memorable, original films. It started with ''Stormriders,'' a special-effects-laden fantasy directed by Andrew Lau that was a rare hit in the doldrums of 1998. And it has extended through ''In the Mood for Love,'' a finely wrought domestic drama by Wong Kar-wai. The film won a best actor award at this year's Cannes Film Festival for Tony Leung Chiu-wai, the first for a Hong Kong actor.</p>
        <p>Then there is ''Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,'' the highly acclaimed martial-arts epic directed by Ang Lee (''The Ice Storm,''  ''Sense and Sensibility''), which just has been named the closing night film for the New York Film Festival on Oct. 8 and will open in New York in December.</p>
        <p>Although strictly speaking not a Hong Kong film -- it was co-financed by Columbia and Mr. Lee is from Taiwan -- ''Crouching Tiger'' used a Hong Kong production crew and features two of its hottest stars, Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yeoh.</p>
        <p>'' 'Crouching Tiger' is a milestone for the local film industry,'' Mr. Barendricht said. ''It's an Asian film with a strong Hong Kong base. That's what this industry is increasingly going to look like.''</p>
        <p>Hong Kong films used to be filmed only within the territory and only in Cantonese, which made them difficult to market overseas. Mr. Tong recalled how difficult it was to sell early Jackie Chan movies to American studios. Not until ''Rumble in the Bronx,'' which had dialogue in Chinese and English -- and was putatively set in New York -- did Mr. Chan break through.</p>
        <p>The returning filmmakers are determined not to be parochial. Mr. Tong is shooting his new film, ''China Strike Force,'' in Chinese and English (less challenging than it sounds, given its lengthy action sequences). He also chose Shanghai as the location, partly because it is cheaper than Hong Kong, but also because he wanted to get to know mainland China better.</p>
        <p>''Of the world's major film industries, Hong Kong has the smallest home market,'' Mr. Tong said. ''If you have a movie that only works in Hong Kong, you are dead before you start. If we can get good distribution in China, it will be our biggest market in 20 years.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Tong knows the theme of his movie will play well with the Chinese authorities. The fight against smuggling and other forms of corruption is a hot button with the Communist leaders, including President Jiang Zemin and Prime Minister Zhu Rongji, both of whom are former mayors of Shanghai.</p>
        <p>Peter Chan is another local director who came back to Hong Kong with a view to expanding the industry's horizons. Mr. Chan, 37, spent three years in Hollywood, where he directed Kate Capshaw in ''The Love Letter'' (1999). He recently started a Hong Kong-based company, Applause Pictures, that will develop pan-Asian pictures. Among his first projects are films by mainland Chinese and Thai directors.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chan said the best Asian films increasingly travel across borders. A recent, if somewhat mournful, example was a low-rent Japanese horror film, ''The Ring,'' which managed to clobber its local competition to become one of Hong Kong's highest-grossing films in 1999.</p>
        <p>Applause Pictures is backed by Star East, a Hong Kong company that is transforming itself into a one-stop shop for Asian entertainment on the Internet. It plans to produce movies and television shows, sell merchandise and create Web sites for performers throughout the region. What Star East needs -- and what Mr. Chan will happily supply -- are movies to fill all these distribution channels.</p>
        <p>I  could have come back, hired the 10 best directors in Hong Kong and set about rebuilding the golden age of the Hong Kong cinema,'' Mr. Chan said over a cup of coffee in the gilded lobby of the Peninsula Hotel here. ''But I don't believe there can be another golden age.''</p>
        <p>Like Mr. Tong, Mr. Chan said Hong Kong -- with a population of 6.8 million -- was simply too small to recapture its once dominant role in the Asian film industry. On the other hand, its marquee directors, crackerjack production crews and deep pools of capital make it a natural hub for a regional industry.</p>
        <p>Not all Hong Kong filmmakers have given up on the idea of a new golden age. Another of the returnees, Tsui Hark, the acclaimed director of ''Once Upon a Time in China'' (1991), recently finished shooting a fantasy film (as yet untitled) that is a sequel to his 1983 classic, ''Zu, Warriors From the Magic Mountain.'' Using the latest in computer-generated special effects but drawing on a 500-year-old Chinese legend, Mr. Tsui hopes to bring a world of mythical warriors soaring above mist-shrouded mountains to a new generation of moviegoers.</p>
        <p>Although it was filmed in Beijing, ''Zu'' is a typical Hong Kong production. It was shot on a tight budget and an even tighter 45-day schedule that required the cast and crew to work round the clock. On one particularly grueling day, Mr. Tsui slept fitfully in a chair next to the set, while an exhausted crew set up a shot involving the film's hero and heroine soaring through the heavens.</p>
        <p>Such brutal schedules used to be common here because of the large volume of productions and the relatively small number of actors and directors. This contributed to the poor quality of Hong Kong films, because directors often began shooting with only the semblance of a script. Scenes were often added or cut willy-nilly to suit the schedules of double-booked stars.</p>
        <p>Here again, Hollywood's influence is making itself felt. Mr. Tsui, who spent two years in the United States making Jean-Claude Van Damme films (''Double Team,'' 1997, and ''Knock Off,'' 1998), said he now worked with finished screenplays. Mr. Tsui also immersed himself in American production techniques and brought some back to Asia. The special effects designers on ''Zu'' are from the United States. And despite the film's frantic schedule, Mr. Tsui said, he has throttled back his pace to one or two movies a year, instead of several.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tsui's other new project, ''Time and Tide,'' exemplifies the new discipline in Hong Kong movie-making. The $3.8 million action film is backed by Columbia Pictures, which monitored every aspect of its budget and production schedule. Although the film is a shoot-'em-up about Chinese gangsters, Mr. Tsui agreed to cut some of the violence from the script to satisfy the studio.</p>
        <p>''In Hong Kong, producers hire directors and leave them alone,'' said Mr. Tsui, a 50-year-old whose wild hair and unlit cigar make him look like an enfant terrible. ''But in Hollywood, they want to know what the story is about. They're very focused on details.''</p>
        <p>If Mr. Lee's ''Crouching Tiger'' is an indication, the discipline of Hollywood may result in better films. But Barbara Robinson, the managing director of Columbia Pictures Film Production Asia, notes that old habits are hard to break.</p>
        <p>''While these directors know what it takes to make a Hollywood movie, it doesn't follow that they will stick to those principles back here, if they can get away with it,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tsui, for one, seems like a grudging convert. Although he concedes that Hong Kong's film industry was almost killed by bad movies, he still sees merit in its frenetic, on-the-fly culture. And while he welcomes Hollywood's money, he does not want to create a Hollywood of the East.</p>
        <p>''All the studio ideas come from video stores,'' he said. ''I think it's very silly.''</p>
