        <p>LAST September, on a family trip to Longfellow's ''shining Big-Sea-Water'' -- Lake Superior in Minnesota -- we hiked, bicycled, canoed, sailed, visited historic sites and gobbled lake trout and heavenly homemade doughnuts. We even swam in the icy water.</p>
        <p>What made a fine adventure extraordinary was our stay at Naniboujou Lodge. Founded as a private club for the likes of Babe Ruth, Jack Dempsey and Ring Lardner, the rustic 71-year-old building of shingles and glass is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It is on scenic Highway 61, memorialized in the Dylan song.</p>
        <p>We were intrigued, but were sure Naniboujou was out of our price range. The first of many pleasant surprises was that rooms are $70 to $90 a night. We ended up doing even better with a special deal for families. For $110, we got two cozy, interconnected rooms, each with a small, shower-equipped bathroom (more expensive rooms have larger baths with tubs) and knotty pine furnishings. We would have been happier with a view of the lake, but for a family  accustomed to rough-and-tumble housekeeping cottages, we reveled in the fact that our beds were made and rooms thoroughly cleaned each morning.</p>
        <p>We arrived on a Sunday evening and after  we had finished our first fine meal of lake trout in the vast dining room, our waitress told us the almost full moon would rise around 10.</p>
        <p>By the time our sons, Roy, 11, and Guy, 9, were asleep, the moon had changed from a dangling pumpkin to an impossibly large sheer white orb. My wife, Suzanne, and I stood on the shore for a moment, entranced by the broad band of light that paved the rippling ''Kitchi-Gami'' -- the original Indian term for the greatest lake (Longfellow called it ''Gitche Gumee.''). I remembered  that Guy had pronounced at dinner: ''The fun's just starting.''</p>
        <p>In fact the fun here started a long time ago, though not in the manner intended.</p>
        <p>Naniboujou was born in the twilight of the Jazz Age, when nobody imagined that the stock market would soon crash, killing the immense and crazy dreams of a crazy decade. Indeed, for the rich group who banded together in the late 1920's to form an exclusive club of 1,000 men of affluence and achievement on the rocky shores of Lake Superior, the party was just beginning.</p>
        <p>A scrapbook of articles and newspaper clippings in the lobby told us of the big plans to turn a virgin forest into a golf course, a dozen tennis courts, a marina for yachts and a clubhouse built from native stone. Celebrities lent their names in return for free membership. Lardner even promised to recommend the club to friends ''as soon as I find out how to pronounce it.''</p>
        <p>The name itself reflected grandiose, if quixotic aspiration. The lakeside retreat was called Naniboujou after the Cree Indian god of the outdoors who ruled the Lake Superior area. Naniboujou fueled great myths: it was he who invented the raspberry and made the blueberry grow in marshy places, not to mention chasing the devil from the North Shore.</p>
        <p>So when Naniboujou opened on July 7, 1929, with fireworks, flappers and its very own fable, promoters were already moving on to the next thing -- adding 5,000 acres and a hunting lodge near the Canadian border to the resort's original 3,330. But just four months later came Black Friday, members stopped paying dues, and by the next summer nobody was coming. Only the clubhouse -- today's hotel -- was built. By all rights, Naniboujou should have died then and there.</p>
        <p>The club idea did. By 1932, the lodge was open to any paying guest. Then came a succession of uses and owners; it was closed during World War II. Then a family named Wallace owned it for nearly two decades, transforming it into a hotel for families. In 1985, a young couple bought it, determined to carry on the new tradition.</p>
        <p>Tim and Nancy Ramey, like the Wallaces, were part of an evangelical Christian organization. They strained mightily to come up with the purchase price, relying on prayer and friends' money. In one sense, they bought far less than the original resort: the more than 3,000 acres across the street had long ago become a magnificent state park with a spectacular waterfall.</p>
        <p>Today, just nine acres belong to the resort. But it seems much bigger. There is a quarter mile of beach frontage and a wide lawn with chairs for relaxing. Birch, pine and maple trees rustle in the lake breeze.</p>
        <p>Inside, the heart of the resort -- the Great Hall, which is used as the dining room -- is  covered in colorful zigzagging designs in a psychedelic marriage of Art Deco and traditional Cree Indian patterns, the original paint from 1929. At one end stands a 20-foot-high fireplace made with 200 tons of rounded Lake Superior rocks. The ceiling is arched to represent the bottom of a canoe.</p>
        <p>The Rameys updated the building little by little, adding wood-burning fireplaces in 5 of the 24 rooms, a solarium and a new heating system. They also set policies intended to take guests back to a gentler time: there are no televisions. There is only one VCR, in the solarium, and it is for guests to watch family-type movies or a home video of a really bad storm in 1996. Alcohol, which must be supplied by the guests themselves,  is permitted only in guests' rooms. (Ice will be delivered upon request.) Nancy says the couple makes no attempt to evangelize, focusing instead on creating an environment where people ''can slow down and enjoy each other.''</p>
        <p>Usually, all seven Ramey children, ranging in age from 5 to 25, help out in the lodge where four of them were born. Nancy, who bakes all the bread herself, said, ''Coming here should be like coming home.''</p>
        <p>Even in the minds of the original promoters, that was pretty much the idea. ''What to do at Naniboujou?'' they asked in their ornate brochure. ''Live, that's the principal matter.''</p>
        <p>And so, for a week, we did. We loved the breakfasts of homemade granola, blueberry flapjacks and elaborate egg dishes, as well as the almond-crusted walleye and steak basted with balsamic vinegar at dinner. Afternoon teatime included treats like cucumber sandwiches and white chocolate scones. The Sunday buffet brunch at $10.95 is so sumptuous that when we were there it attracted a crowd of more than 400 or more in a county of just 4,000. Many stood in line outside waiting to get in.</p>
        <p>But it is the just-hanging-out stuff that is nicest for a family. Roy loved playing basketball and pitching horseshoes. Guy liked swimming in the chilly water with me. (''Another memory completed,'' he announced after his first dip.) Suzanne liked to watch the myriad changes in the northern sky from the old-fashioned chair glider swing on the front lawn. We all enjoyed sitting in the solarium where there was an upright piano and sheet music of Cole Porter and Gershwin, Monopoly and other board games and binoculars to observe shore birds.</p>
        <p>Unlike the audacious dream of the founders to build a sporting paradise, the equipment available is almost charmingly modest: horseshoes and croquet; strolling along the lake is by far the most popular activity. Kayaks can be rented in nearby Grand Marais and canoes at the many little resorts on the lakes just inland.</p>
        <p>In the pleasant solarium library, I kept returning to the Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mushrooms. Mushrooms are common in the vicinity, along with wild blueberries, strawberries and raspberries.</p>
        <p>THE centerpiece, always, was Lake Superior, the world's largest freshwater lake in surface area. As you look toward the horizon, the water shimmers in bands of four or more colors, ranging from pale gold to the deepest blue. On one shore walk just a little south of Naniboujou, the beach changed from fine gravel to round stones to intricate basalt outcroppings.</p>
        <p>Hiking was our favorite activity. There are many nearby trails, some steep, often winding through the birches and, almost always, within earshot of a stream.</p>
        <p>Most of our hikes, including the shore walk, were on the Superior Hiking Trail. Extending from Two Harbors, Minn., to Canada, the 200-mile trail was begun in the mid-1980's along the model of the Appalachian Trail. On one three-mile hike on the Kadunce River trail, several miles from Naniboujou, we took time to read some comments from hikers in a notebook kept in an unlocked box near a waterfall. My favorite: ''I'm 73 and this country is very beautiful -- but not as beautiful as my wife Dana.'' -- Bob</p>
        <p>Another trip was to Grand Portage National Monument about 30 miles north, near the Canadian border. There we learned of the voyageurs, those intrepid canoeists who fanned out across the northern reaches of North America to create a new economy, and ultimately a new consciousness. Our well-informed guides wore 18th-century costumes and demonstrated boat-building, pie-making and other skills.</p>
        <p>Later we hiked up Mount Rose and were rewarded with a lovely view of the fort and the lake -- home, at that moment, to a single sailboat. Next trip, Roy and I plan to hike the Grand Portage -- meaning Great Carrying Place -- along which the voyageurs brought trade goods from one direction and furs from the other. It is more than likely that we will skip the 90-pound load each voyageur carried on the 17-mile round trip.</p>
        <p>We made many trips to Grand Marais, a picturesque harbor village 15 miles to the south. The town's slightly quirky sensibility is suggested by the folk art that pops up everywhere: for instance, a fishing tackle store has an enormous lake trout popping through the side of the building.</p>
        <p>We loved hanging around the World's Best Donuts, where we feasted on jelly-stuffed doughnuts called bismarks. We saw boats and baskets being built at the North House Folk School and took a sail on the school's schooner Hjordis, a wonderful two-hour trip for $35 a person. I rented a mountain bike at the local bike store, and was given directions for a more than challenging scenic ride on logging roads and snowmobile trails to the west of town.</p>
        <p>The people in Grand Marais are remarkably friendly. When our rental car refused to start after dinner one evening, drivers kept offering us a jump. Sue from the local service station drove more than 30 miles out of her way to give us a ride back to Naniboujou.</p>
        <p>We figured people in the north country naturally help each other out. Tim Ramey, for instance, had served as a volunteer fireman. In the fall of 1998, a fireplace in a burning house collapsed on him, leaving him paralyzed. He nevertheless mans the phone on Sunday afternoons and is full of plans to  upgrade Naniboujou further, beginning with modernizing the kitchen.</p>
        <p>It all recalls Naniboujou's mission, as defined in the original brochure of a long-ago club. The idea was to get ''back to the beginning of things.''</p>
        <p>And getting back is our intention. Roy put our names on the list for next year's drawing at the World's Best Donuts, and we will return to see if 2668 turns into our lucky number.</p>
