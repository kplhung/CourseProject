        <p>NO animal ever leaves the Plum Island Animal Disease Center, the Department of Agriculture laboratory sequestered off the tip of the North Fork. But until recently, pigs, cattle and other large creatures that the scientists use to study diseases arrived alive.</p>
        <p>That will change very soon if the Department of Agriculture moves forward with an emergency plan to slaughter 355 sheep from Vermont and ship their frozen carcasses to the high-security laboratory for incineration.</p>
        <p>Agriculture officials believe the imported sheep may be carrying a new and deadly variant of mad-cow disease, which devastated cattle in Britain during the 1990's and has been linked to the deaths of more than 70 Europeans, most of them Britons, who ate infected meat.</p>
        <p>The sheep, two flocks of East Friesians, are not dead yet. Farm officials in Vermont have monitored the animals since the original sheep were imported from Belgium and the Netherlands four years ago, and believe they are infected. But the owners say the sheep are healthy, and have blocked the slaughter in Federal court.</p>
        <p>The stakes are high. Some researchers warn -- though such estimates include many variables -- that anywhere from a few thousand to half a million Britons could die over the next 30 years from Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, the human form of mad-cow disease, which in effect eats holes in the brain.</p>
        <p>Plum Island, the Agriculture Department officials say, is the safest and best-equipped place to dispose of the suspect sheep and obliterate any chance that the disease, which may incubate for years, will spread in the United States.</p>
        <p>The incineration would mark a new direction for Plum Island and its first direct connection to research into transmissible spongiform encephalopathy, or T.S.E., a disease category that includes mad-cow disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy, and scrapie, a fatal sheep disease.</p>
        <p>Earlier plans to ferry live sheep to the island for long-term observation were apparently scrapped. But even carcasses potentially carrying a disease that has caused death, tumult and huge economic loss in Europe are not entirely welcome on the Island.</p>
        <p>The shipment is vigorously opposed by Representative Michael P. Forbes, who accused the Agriculture Department of trying to minimize the event, withholding information and ignoring opposition on eastern Long Island to expanded lab operations.</p>
        <p>''They tried to sneak this through in the dead of night,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Officials in the Town of Southold are also unhappy and a bit unsure what may be afoot. ''We're getting six different stories from six different agencies,'' said the town supervisor, Jean Cochrane. ''I am not happy.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Forbes said it would be the first time dead animals had been delivered to Plum Island for disposal and could set a precedent that is inappropriate for a government research center in a densely populated region.</p>
        <p>Taking tissue samples before incineration for later study would also involve the lab in animal diseases that could be fatal to humans, only months after the Clinton administration, at Mr. Forbes's urging, withdrew funds to make the center the country's first Biosafety Level 4 laboratory.</p>
        <p>Level 4 facilities, the highest level, provide protection for scientists researching virulent animal viruses capable of causing human deaths. Plum Island is currently a Level 3 laboratory, which handles less dangerous material.</p>
        <p>Dr. Linda A. Detwieler, a senior staff veterinarian for emergency programs for the Department of Agriculture, said the sheep-tissue studies did not require a Level 4 lab because they did not involve airborne viruses. She said a person would have to eat the tissues to be infected.</p>
        <p>She also said the shipment would be an isolated event -- not likely to be repeated -- to take advantage of two incinerators at Plum Island that are routinely used to dispose of animals intentionally infected with viruses as part of the center's research. Filtering systems remove particulates from air emissions and ashes are treated prior to disposal.</p>
        <p>Incineration at the center would be an extra precaution against allowing a sheep version of spongiform encephalopathy into the United States, where mad-cow disease has never been observed, Dr. Detwieler said.</p>
        <p>In Europe, primarily in Britain, more than 176,000 cattle have died from mad-cow disease and four million cattle were destroyed as a precaution. Experts believe the disease is linked to contaminated feed made from meat and bone meal that contains an abnormal form of a protein called a prion.</p>
        <p>In many cases, cattle carcasses were incinerated in portable units. (In one macabre instance, a company proposed generating electricity with heat from masses of burning carcasses.) But American officials said they wanted a highly controlled disposal technique to minimize risks.</p>
        <p>An Agriculture Department spokesman, Patrick Collins, said the Plum Island center was ''uniquely positioned'' for the task of incinerating the Vermont sheep. ''Plum Island was designed for this kind of stuff and they have been doing it for four or five decades,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The laboratory normally incinerates about 250 animals a year, mostly pigs.</p>
        <p>At the moment the sheep in Vermont are in a legal limbo. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman ordered their seizure last month after tests on four of the sheep showed variations of the fatal sheep disease scrapie, which government veterinarians fear could be a form of spongiform encephalopathy.</p>
        <p>Government officials are especially concerned because, unlike the path of the disease in cattle, the sheep variety may be transmitted from infected ewes to their offspring.</p>
        <p>Last week the Vermont sheep remained in quarantine while the flocks' owners, Larry and Linda Faillace and Houghton Freeman, appealed a federal judge's ruling that upheld the government's seizure.</p>
        <p>Mr. Freeman said the owners doubted the accuracy of the tests on the four sheep and believed the government was looking for an excuse to slaughter the sheep.</p>
        <p>''They came in here waving these test results and said, 'Either you turn the sheep over to us voluntarily or we will come and get them,' '' he said. ''Yet all these sheep were imported with U.S.D.A. approval, and that wasn't easy to get.''</p>
        <p>The Agriculture Department officials said the flocks fell under suspicion in 1998, when the European Union said it could not guarantee that the parent sheep had not eaten infected feed prior to export.</p>
        <p>Mr. Freeman said he had never seen signs of scrapie or any behavior that could indicate sheep in his flock were infected with any spongiform encephalopathy.</p>
        <p>Milk from the ewes, which produce 10 times more than domestic breeds, is used to make cheese. Mr. Freeman said he usually slaughtered all but a few rams for meat. Vermont health officials have issued a health caution about the cheese, and no meat has left the farms.</p>
        <p>The owners have also asked permission to return the flocks to Belgium, and Belgian officials have also asked for the return of some animals for testing.</p>
        <p>Agriculture officials said that under their current plan, the sheep would be killed at a laboratory in Newburgh, N.Y., where, they said, 21 sheep from a third Vermont flock from imported stock had already been killed and incinerated. The carcasses would then be double-wrapped in plastic, boxed, frozen and shipped inside a refrigerated truck that would be transported from New London, Conn., to Plum Island on a special ferry. The truck would stay permanently on the island, officials said.</p>
        <p>Not all eastern Long Island officials oppose the shipment.</p>
        <p>''I have every confidence the officials on Plum island can handle the animals and the disease,'' said David Kapell, the mayor of Greenport. ''And I am sure I speak for the majority of the people in Greenport.''</p>
        <p>Many Plum Island employees live in the village.</p>
