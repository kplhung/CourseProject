        <p>Arrow Electronics Inc. of Melville (NYSE: ARW) plans to purchase the VEBA Electronics Group of Germany as part of a consortium put together by Schroder Ventures, a British investment group. Arrow and VEBA are ranked first and third, respectively, among distributors of electronic components. Second-ranked Avnet, based in Phoenix, is also in the consortium.</p>
        <p>Arrow said the acquisition will cause some overlap but he would not specify the possible effect on employment. ''It is our practice to carefully select the best people from both organizations,'' said Robert E. Klatell, executive vice president.

        <p>Arrow Electronics Inc. of Melville (NYSE: ARW) plans to purchase the VEBA Electronics Group of Germany as part of a consortium put together by Schroder Ventures, a British investment group. Arrow and VEBA are ranked first and third, respectively, among distributors of electronic components. Second-ranked Avnet, based in Phoenix, is also in the consortium.</p>
        <p>Arrow said the acquisition will cause some overlap but he would not specify the possible effect on employment. ''It is our practice to carefully select the best people from both organizations,'' said Robert E. Klatell, executive vice president. ''We take pride in the fact that 30 to 35 percent of our current managers have come to us from similar transactions.''</p>
        <p>VEBA Electronics, with 1999 sales of $5.5 billion, has three groups: Wyle Components, Wyle Systems and Atlas Services, in the United States; EBV Elektronik, WBC, Raab Karcher Electronic Systems (RKE) and Atlas Services in Europe, and the global Memec group.</p>
        <p>Under the agreement, Arrow will acquire Wyle Components and Wyle Systems, which reported combined 1999 sales in North America of about $2 billion, for approximately $840 million. Arrow plans to finance the purchase through a combination of debt, common stock and equity-linked securities.</p>
        <p>Arrow, the largest company on the Island, had sales last year of $9.3 billion.</p>
