        <p>Re ''Four Corners'' (July 30): I'd like to comment specifically about the section titled ''In Flushing, Koreatown Becomes Chinese.''</p>
        <p>For 15 years I've lived either in Flushing or nearby Bayside and I find it interesting and unnerving that Sung Soo Kim, president of the Korean American Small Business Service Center, finds: ''It is a bad thing that's happened here. Koreans have been pushed out by other ethnic groups. Landlords kick them out to get higher rents. We used to have 80 stores in that area. Now we have three or four.''</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Four Corners'' (July 30): I'd like to comment specifically about the section titled ''In Flushing, Koreatown Becomes Chinese.''</p>
        <p>For 15 years I've lived either in Flushing or nearby Bayside and I find it interesting and unnerving that Sung Soo Kim, president of the Korean American Small Business Service Center, finds: ''It is a bad thing that's happened here. Koreans have been pushed out by other ethnic groups. Landlords kick them out to get higher rents. We used to have 80 stores in that area. Now we have three or four.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps this is true in that particular high-rent district, but just a few  blocks east on Northern Boulevard,  numerous blocks have only recently become completely Korean.</p>
        <p>In my opinion, the reason the Koreans in particular are unable to compete is because they are, generally, surviving solely on Korean customers -- very little, or no, attempt is made to reach those outside their own community. They compete with each other for the same customer base, and in most of Queens, ethnic groups live and work separately, hardly ever touching and not caring if they do or not.</p>
        <p>Being native born (and my parents having been of different ethnicities and religions), and appreciating the city's diversity, I am continually and  deeply saddened by the separateness of the various ethnic groups. In last  year's elections in Flushing the candidates were basically just representatives of their individual ethnic group's self-interests.</p>
