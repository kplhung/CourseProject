        <p>THE Malonys, a handsome family of six from Orange County, Calif., have arrived in Times Square. They are on vacation in Manhattan for five days.</p>
        <p>''How did you know we were tourists?'' Elizabeth Malony asked.</p>
        <p>''Instinct,'' I said. (There seems no point in citing the obvious: Her husband, Victor, is wearing a wrinkled T-shirt and shorts and quarterbacking a street-corner huddle with his wife and children, Casey, 15; Kathleen, 14; Rory, 12; and Molly, 10, each of whom is blond, or nearly so. They are holding maps and looking up. The sign says, ''Don't Walk.'' They don't.)</p>
        <p>People like the Malonys who come from vastly different cultures -- California, Minnesota, South Carolina -- are a blessing. They bless us with their dollars,  smiles and openness. They eat at our restaurants, go to our shows (''We have tickets to 'Fosse,' '' Mr. Malony said.) and buy overpriced T-shirts and electronics. Most of all, they are forgiving, where we are not. But more of that later.</p>
        <p>Visitors display more colorful plumage -- visiting choral groups tend to wear monogrammed red golf shirts -- but still seem much like us. Except when they walk, or rather amble, four abreast, holding hands. Sometimes they stop, midsidewalk, without signaling. The rest of us, hackles raised, are compelled to flow around them, like an ant column confronting a stone.</p>
        <p>There have always been cutting comments about tourists in Manhattan, relying on exaggerated tales of  gullibility or hayseed indifference to the pace of life here. Would the Malonys think of pulling onto a California freeway in low gear? Surely not. So why would they assume that pulling out onto a crowded Midtown sidewalk at rush hour is any different? Or less dangerous?</p>
        <p>Along with the gibes, of course, you hear some typically screwy New York antidotes, like painting lanes on sidewalks: one for tourists, one for New Yorkers.</p>
        <p>Ellen Goldstein, director of community development for the Times Square Business Improvement District, has heard this one before. She plays along, suggesting international lane symbols.</p>
        <p>''You could have a cockroach for New Yorkers,'' she said, ''and a smiley face for tourists.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Goldstein, a Californian who has lived here long enough to pass for a native, is keeper of the pedestrian statistics that the BID compiles periodically. Except for an understandable dip in foot traffic at construction sites, the Times Square area, from 40th to 53rd Streets and from Sixth Avenue (tourists call it the Avenue of the Americas) to Eighth, is filling up, especially at Christmas and in summer.</p>
        <p>Between 1997 and 1999, for example, on the southwest corner of Seventh Avenue and 42nd Street, the BID  says pedestrian traffic rose by 43.6 percent.</p>
        <p>What's to be done? The smiley face lanes? Or something more outrageous?</p>
        <p>A surly colleague of mine has occasionally raised the notion of issuing to New Yorkers plastic foam bats about two-thirds the size of a Louisville Slugger. The bats, to be carried during peak tourist seasons, would be used to poke laggards lightly on shoulders or buttocks, urging them to yield the right of way. My colleague has named this device Whack-a-Rube and thinks that, marketed assiduously, it could be a gold mine, if no one brings assault charges.</p>
        <p>Whoa! There seems to be an unchallenged assumption here that generates all the kvetching. It is this: $22 billion in annual tourism revenue notwithstanding, the threat to our culture arrives daily on Delta, United or Continental. Threat? To what? Or, put another way, what's our rush?</p>
        <p>We rush to the subway on our way to work, where we rush to the telephone, rush to check e-mail, rush to the fax machine. Later, we rush to the theater or the movies, because we were late rushing from the office.</p>
        <p>We rush to cross the street because to stop at curbside is to violate a local law of nature that says moving bodies tend to lose value if they cease forward motion.</p>
        <p>We rush to wait in the perpetual line at the ticket window for the playoffs, the series, the championship or the closed-circuit version of same.</p>
        <p>Commuters rush to the Port Authority, the PATH station, or Grand Central, because five minutes' delay means a half-hour wait to stand up on a bus or train held up indefinitely by other buses or trains.</p>
        <p>At lunchtime, we rush to the bank and fume behind velvet ropes. Then, rushing back to the office, we encounter . . . the Malonys. Who by this time might be forgiven if they were preparing to sharpen their elbows.</p>
        <p>Instead, they are willing to take us as we are.</p>
        <p>''I told the kids, New York is just like Disneyland,'' Elizabeth Malony said, ''but on a crowded day.''</p>
