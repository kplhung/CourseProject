        <p>Annie Rosenberg is a good employee. She never laughs when her boss at Albees, the baby store on the Upper West Side, wears her poodle to work.</p>
        <p>And when the boss is out of town and calls the store worried that her poodle, Austin, is lonely, Ms. Rosenberg plops the five-pound dog into the infant carrier called a Baby Bjorn and continues working.</p>
        <p>''I'm an extremely good employee,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Austin is not the only dog traveling in a baby carrier. This summer, lots of New Yorkers are transporting dogs in the Baby Bjorn ($78.99) and the Snugli ($40.99), and in pet equivalents like the Daba Doo ($44.99) and the Poocheroo, recently discontinued.</p>
        <p>Petco stores in Manhattan, on East 86th Street and Union Square, sold all of those carriers this spring; Deborah Ortiz of Animal Attractions, on East 66th Street, said she could not keep them in stock. Jan Koster, owner of Pet Stop, on Third Avenue between 89th and 88th Streets, said she had sold 50 Daba Doos this year in red, black, green, tiger and teal plaid. Leopard is the favorite.</p>
        <p>Bash Dibra, who casts dogs in films and has trained dogs for celebrities, called the pooch pack the craze of the summer.</p>
        <p>''Is it hot?'' Mr. Dibra said. ''It's hot.  People will do anything to make having a dog workable for them. If it works for people, why can't it work for puppy love?''</p>
        <p>Sue Nastasi, a dog trainer, thinks it can. She is married to a dog photographer. They have four dogs, including two 7-pound Chihuahuas and a 70-pound Rhodesian ridgeback. When Ms. Nastasi takes the bus or subway, she usually tucks a Chihuahua -- either Miss Ellie or Minnie -- in her denim and red gingham-checked Poocheroo. Paws tucked in and beady eyes peering out, the dogs like the ride, she said.</p>
        <p>''It's like a little den,'' she said. ''They feel safe.''</p>
        <p>Kate Larkworthy, an agent for illustrators, said her carrier was ''the perfect way for the family to get around town.''</p>
        <p>The family includes her husband, a rat terrier (who rides in the carrier) and an Italian greyhound.</p>
        <p>Though nothing beats a walk for exercising and socializing a dog, Karen Heidgerd, a nurse at Animal General, said she had stopped asking New Yorkers to treat pets like animals, not babies.</p>
        <p>''I've spent 15 years in the business,'' she said, ''and people just love spending money on their pets.''</p>
