        <p>Norman looked out over the gambling floor at Resorts Atlantic City, a cacophony of clanging and a blur of ostentatious colors.</p>
        <p>Once, Norman was a regular on that vast floor. But the compulsive gambler, who asked that his name be withheld, had not seen it for five years.</p>
        <p>Soon Norman will not be allowed even to see the gambling floor at Resorts, or any other casino here. He said he would be among the first to ban himself from New Jersey's casinos when a plan -- designed to help compulsive gamblers save themselves from their addiction -- takes effect, perhaps in 60 days.</p>
        <p>The regulation, proposed by the Division of Gaming Enforcement last week, must still be approved by the state Casino Control Commission. It is similar to efforts in Connecticut, Missouri, Michigan and Louisiana.</p>
        <p>In Connecticut and Missouri, however, the regulations are accompanied by potential criminal prosecutions. But John Peter Suarez, director of the state's Division of Gaming Enforcement, said it would be unlikely that New Jersey would do that.</p>
        <p>Under the plan, gamblers like Norman could register with the state and provide a photograph of themselves to casinos, which would no longer send them mailings and would be required to deny them such pricey perks as free show tickets, credit, check-cashing privileges and free or discounted food and hotel rooms -- which casino regulars are tempted with.</p>
        <p>Casinos already ban scam artists and people thought to have ties to members of organized crime.</p>
        <p>''I know it sounds bizarre to anyone who is not an addict,'' said Norman, who belongs to several support groups for compulsive gambling. ''But anything that helps you deal with your addiction is a plus.''</p>
        <p>An estimated 16 million Americans have experienced gambling problems at some point in their lives, according to the National Research Council.</p>
        <p>Edward Looney, executive director of the Council on Compulsive Gambling of New Jersey, is also a recovering compulsive gambler. While Mr. Looney insisted he was not against gambling per se, he said it was important that the gambling industry know it should not target the compulsive gambler.</p>
        <p>''Casinos are great marketers,'' said Mr. Looney. ''Once they have your name, they will send you everything to attract you to come to their casino. As a recovering gambler myself, the temptation is hard to resist. But if this ruling has the casinos' cooperation, it will be a good thing.''</p>
        <p>Wally Barr, an executive for Hilton who is also head of the Atlantic City Casino Association, declined to comment on the proposal.</p>
        <p>To be sure, Mr. Suarez said the ruling would not be a panacea for compulsive gamblers.</p>
        <p>''It's not like we are going to require the casinos to have mug shots of everyone who signs up at every table,'' he said. ''If you are on the list and come in with $100 in cash and go to the blackjack table, you will probably be able to bet it away unnoticed.''</p>
        <p>''But that isn't the point,'' he said. ''We should have had this long ago.''</p>
        <p>In noting that the proposal in this state did not include possible criminal prosecution, Mr. Suarez said: ''We're not trying to make anyone criminals here. More than likely, we would just try to get the patron off the floor and have the casino give back any money it might have won. We don't envision any problems with that.''</p>
        <p>Under the proposal, applying for reinstatement would require a 30- to 60-day wait.</p>
        <p>''It would be like a cooling-off period,'' Mr. Suarez said. ''It wouldn't be like you had a yen to gamble tonight, drive down to Atlantic City, sign yourself off the list and go to the casino for some credit.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Looney said the Council on Compulsive Gambling of New Jersey  worked closely with the Division of Gaming Enforcement on the formulation of the regulation.</p>
        <p>''There should be fines that go along with it,'' he said, ''but we will work with whatever finally comes out.''</p>
        <p>Norman said he did not have a problem with going back to casinos, where he said he lost more than $200,000 before acknowledging his gambling addiction. But he said he was glad that he would now have another control.</p>
        <p>''Yes, you do have to take control over your life,'' he said. ''You can't blame casinos for your own failings, but it's nice to have one more thing to help me live a normal life.''</p>
        <p>''Despite what it has done to me, I do miss it,'' he added. ''That's the addict's predicament. So I know I really need this self-ban.''</p>
