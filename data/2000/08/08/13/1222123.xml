        <p>AS it runs under Brooklyn, the F train buzzes with sounds of the city: the rhythmic ker-chunk of music from headphones and the voices of riders speaking to one another in any number of languages. But by the time the conductor says ''15th Street, Prospect Park,'' the train has arrived at one of northern Brooklyn's leafier neighborhoods, Windsor Terrace.</p>
        <p>On a sunny summer afternoon the only sounds that can be heard on the neighborhood's quiet residential streets are the chirping of sparrows, the wind rustling through the old mulberry and poplar trees that line many of the blocks and the whirr of countless window air-conditioners.</p>
        <p>In the seven- to nine-block strip of city that lies between two of Brooklyn's largest green open spaces, Prospect Park and Green-Wood Cemetery, and between Prospect Park West to the north and Caton Avenue to the south, the streets of Windsor Terrace are filled mostly with two- and three-story row houses, brick, clapboard, brownstone and limestone (or at least limestone-colored concrete).</p>
        <p>In recent years, as prices have steadily risen in such long-fashionable nearby neighborhoods as Park Slope and Brooklyn Heights, Windsor Terrace has attracted buyers who might have overlooked it a decade ago.</p>
        <p>''People are moving in from all over,'' said Linda Haber, a former Manhattanite who has lived with her husband, Martin, on Prospect Park Southwest for 12 years. ''It's not hard-core Brooklyn any more.'' Ms. Haber added that one of the families she had in mind had recently moved into the neighborhood from France.</p>
        <p>In many ways Windsor Terrace is similar to parts of Park Slope, its more widely known neighbor to the north, though it is smaller and, so far, less expensive.</p>
        <p>''In the last three years it's exploded,'' said Al Fiore, a New York City police officer who has lived in a rent-stabilized apartment in a six-story building on Seeley Street for 19 years. ''Park Slope got filled up, and everyone started pushing this way.''</p>
        <p>At the same time, the Irish Catholics who have predominated here since the turn of the century have declined in number, area residents and real estate agents said.</p>
        <p>''The old Irish are dying off, and their children can't live here because the rents are sky-high,'' said the Rev. Dennis Farrell, the pastor of the Holy Name of Jesus Roman Catholic Church, a neighborhood institution on Prospect Park West since 1878. Many former Windsor Terrace residents have moved on to Staten Island and New Jersey, he said. ''Over the last two years or two and a half years, there's been an influx of yuppies,'' he added.</p>
        <p>Ilze Earner arrived two years ago after 23 years in Park Slope. She said she moved after being priced out of Park Slope, and at first she was a little homesick. ''I think I cried for about a month after I moved here,'' she said. ''I had to walk 20 blocks for a latte.''</p>
        <p>But Windsor Terrace grew on her. ''This neighborhood is an acquired taste -- I wouldn't leave it for anything,'' she said. ''It's quieter, it's less pretentious, there's a neighborliness here, and parking is easier.''</p>
        <p>After a year and a half in a rental apartment facing Prospect Park, Ms. Earner and her husband, Laurence, bought a two-family detached brick house on Greenwood Avenue in the southern part of the neighborhood for $487,000. They live on the lower floor and rent out the four-bedroom apartment on the top floor for $1,550 a month.</p>
        <p>After looking in Westchester County and on Long Island, the Earners realized they could find enough space -- they have two boys, 13 and 2 -- in Windsor Terrace. ''It's really light, and it's airy, and I've even got a yard,'' Ms. Earner said. ''We've got room to grow into.''</p>
        <p>Prices for rental apartments, while less expensive than they are in Park Slope, are on the rise. Studios range from $750 to $1,100, said Marcia J. Miller, a broker who owns Open Options Real Estate on Prospect Park West, while one-bedrooms range from  $1,000 to $1,500, two-bedrooms from $1,200 to $1,800 and three-bedrooms from $1,500 to $2,000.</p>
        <p>MOST of the houses in Windsor Terrace are owner-occupied, said Ellen Blau, a vice president of Warren Lewis Realty in Park Slope who has sold houses in Windsor Terrace for 15 years. A three-story row house can cost $550,000 to $650,000, Ms. Blau said, and two-story row house $450,000 to $550,000. Many of these smaller houses were built 80 or 90 years ago as two-family houses but are now occupied by one, she said.</p>
        <p>Through the center of the neighborhood is the Prospect Expressway, which connects Ocean Parkway in southern Brooklyn to the Belt Parkway and the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel to Manhattan, it is partly below ground level for much of its length in the neighborhood. Because they are a bit farther away from the subway and from Park Slope, houses west of the expressway often cost less than those on the east side, sometimes as much as 30 to 40 percent less, Ms. Blau said.</p>
        <p>Toward the north of the neighborhood the blocks are mostly attached limestone or brick houses, but in the southern part, the blocks are a mixture of attached and detached houses with some taller apartment buildings thrown in.</p>
        <p>''That's the interesting thing about Windsor Terrace,'' Ms. Blau said. ''You don't have too many streets where it's block after block of the same type of house.''</p>
        <p>While many residents go to Park Slope to shop, activity has increased along the Windsor Terrace's main commercial street, Prospect Park West between 18th Street and Bartel-Pritchard Square, at the western corner of Prospect Park. In 1996, the Saunders Theater, a long-closed movie house on the Park Slope side of the circle,  was reopened as an eight-screen multiplex called the Pavilion, which helped spur commercial development along the street.</p>
        <p>Many new restaurants and cafes have opened along Prospect Park West. An area that once only had only one restaurant now has two Mexican restaurants, two pizzerias  and two Chinese takeout shops.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the most telling detail about the change the area is experiencing is the recent opening of an upscale bagel, muffin and coffee shop called Connecticut Muffin on Bartel-Pritchard Square.</p>
        <p>Most of the neighborhood's commerce occurs on Prospect Park West, which many  residents call Ninth Avenue where it does not border the park. But a mixture of businesses can also be found in the residential blocks to the south, among them Jeff Bloch's Amp and Guitar Wellness Center on 10th Avenue and the John Rogers fire extinguisher store and repair shop on Prospect Avenue.</p>
        <p>ONE of the main attractions of Windsor Terrace is the proximity of Prospect Park. ''It's fantastic -- it's a great park,'' said Rob McIntosh, an actor and acting teacher. He and his wife, Dana Leslie Goldstein, bought a three-story cream-colored brick row house on Windsor Place near Prospect Park Southwest three years ago.</p>
        <p>Mr. McIntosh said that he, his wife and their 2-year-old daughter, Emma -- they also have a newborn son, David, -- frequently make use of the park, going to the playground, attending concerts at the band shell near their home, walking along the lake and to the playground, and going to the park's zoo, about 10 minutes away. ''There's a huge variety of wild birds in the lake: geese, herons, ducks, sea gulls, swans,'' he said. ''We go to the park almost every day in the summertime.''</p>
        <p>Most Windsor Terrace residents have cars, which they generally park on the street (few houses have driveways or garages). The trip to Midtown Manhattan takes about 30 minutes by car or about 40 minutes on the F train.</p>
        <p>Most elementary-school children who attend public school go to P.S. 154 on 11th Avenue in the center of the neighborhood. Its enrollment is about 350 students. P.S. 130 on Ocean Parkway near Caton Avenue also serves part of the neighborhood; its enrollment of 580 includes many children from the Kensington neighborhood to the south.</p>
        <p>At P.S. 154, 87 percent of the children read at grade level, well above the citywide average, while 51 percent of children at P.S. 130 read at grade level, slightly above the citywide average, said Patricia Lawrence, special assistant to the superintendent.</p>
        <p>Most middle-school children in the neighborhood attend two nearby schools, Middle School 51, at Fifth Avenue and Fifth Street, and the School for Research, a three-year-old magnet school that emphasizes the use of computers as a research tool. Its 330 students are housed at P.S. 230, a few blocks south of Windsor Terrace.</p>
        <p>The closest private school is the Holy Name of Jesus School on Prospect Park West, a Roman Catholic school founded in 1885. It has an enrollment of about 200 in prekindergarden through the eighth grade. Many of its students go on to Bishop Ford High School in Park Slope.</p>
        <p>Windsor Terrace was named for Windsor, England, said John Manbeck, the Brooklyn borough historian, and ''terrace'' was added because the sloping land had to be laid out in terraces in order to grow crops. ''We're very much Anglophiles here in Brooklyn,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The Village of Windsor Terrace was incorporated in 1851, shortly after John Vanderbilt sold his farmland to a developer, William Bell, who carved it into 47 building lots, Mr. Manbeck said.</p>
        <p>While there have been many changes in  the neighborhood over the years, much has remained the same. And despite the influx of new residents and rising prices, real estate agents say that many houses are still sold by word of mouth to people who have lived in Windsor Terrace for a long time.</p>
        <p>''It's like a hidden little town,'' said Joseph Longobardi, the vice chairman of Community Board 7 and a 35-year resident. ''Even though there have been some changes, I think it still remains that private Windsor Terrace that it was once.''</p>
