        <p>He first jumped into a Go Kart when he was 4, and Jerry Nadeau was hooked. He loved driving cars so much that he often slept in one to scare up enough money to keep chasing his dream.</p>
        <p>''It's not bad when you turn the heat on,'' Nadeau said this morning, smiling.</p>
        <p>Now Nadeau, 29, a native of Danbury, Conn., has his own mobile home to sleep in and his own fast Winston Cup car to drive. He has finished fourth in two of his last three Nascar races, including the Brickyard 400 last Saturday, and he is peeking out from the huge shadows cast by Jeff Gordon, his Hendrick racing teammate.</p>
        <p>''All of a sudden, things are starting to turn around and we're starting to finish races,'' Nadeau said.</p>
        <p>With six straight victories on road courses and a three-race winning streak at Watkins Glen International, Gordon will be a focal point entering Sunday's Global Crossing at the Glen. Although some road-course specialists are hired for this race, stock-car drivers are better on road courses than they used to be.</p>
        <p>''It used to be you didn't focus on a road course,'' Gordon said. ''You said, 'That's just one we throw out the window.' Now, for the championship, you've got to run good everywhere.''</p>
        <p>Showers this morning canceled qualifying, throwing an interesting wrinkle into the race for the Winston Cup. The cars will start in order of their Winston Cup points standing, which means the top three of Bobby Labonte, Dale Jarrett and Dale Earnhardt will be at the front of a pack that will be hard to catch.</p>
        <p>Nadeau will start 25th, but he thinks he has a car capable of surging to the front. He posted the third-fastest time in practice under sodden skies this morning, faster even than Gordon. He posted his best finishes here in each of his two full Winston Cup seasons.</p>
        <p>Nadeau has driven virtually every kind of souped-up car there is. When he was 17 he won track championships on dirt and asphalt at Oakland Valley Raceway in Cuddebackville, N.Y., and he once finished second in a Go Kart race on ice in St. Petersburg, Russia.</p>
        <p>''He was quick from the start,'' said Skip Barber, who runs a racing school.</p>
        <p>By 1995, Nadeau moved to North Carolina to try to be a Winston Cup driver. He remembers sneaking into Hendrick's shop to pick up some tips. Two years later, he was in a Winston Cup car. He signed with Hendrick at the end of last season and got sponsorship from a dot-com company that sells building materials.</p>
        <p>All he has to do now is win.</p>
        <p>''It just takes time, and then experience takes over a little bit,'' said Tony Furr, Nadeau's crew chief. ''What's been hard for us is that this has been a new car and a new driver. Usually, when you make a change, you only have to worry about one of those things.''</p>
        <p>It has helped Nadeau that he has had Gordon's expertise at his disposal. But Hendrick, who also owns a car driven by Terry Labonte, has never seen Nadeau as his third-best driver.</p>
        <p>''Jerry's stayed pretty level,'' Furr said. ''You can tell he's confident -- I reckon that's the word for it. But he has a lot more confidence than he had early, that's for sure.''</p>
