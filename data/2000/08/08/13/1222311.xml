        <p>SOME in Times Square aren't thrilled by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's plan to erect a statue of Frank Sinatra on the traffic island at 44th Street and Broadway. Critics say the Crossroads of the World is too congested for the bronze likeness of a singer with little connection to Broadway.</p>
        <p>The most historically significant aspect of this proposal, however, has been overlooked: The monument in front of the armed forces' busiest recruiting station would honor a man who avoided the World War II draft and spent much of his life trying to live it down.</p>
        <p>As the historian William Manchester once noted, Sinatra was ''the most hated man of World War II'' because he was getting rich thrilling American women while their boyfriends and husbands were fighting overseas. In fact, the site proposed for the 10-foot-tall statue is almost exactly where in 1944, sailors (captured in a famous photo) threw tomatoes at the crooner's visage on the now-defunct Paramount Theater across the street from the recruiting station, which opened in 1942.</p>
        <p>The singer and his family always claimed that he wanted to serve, but was stopped by a punctured eardrum. It's true that his exemption was legitimate. But his claim is put to the test by records of a Federal Bureau of Investigation inquiry into his exemption released after his death in 1998.</p>
        <p>Sinatra repeatedly said on draft forms that he had ''no physical or mental defects or diseases,'' as he wrote on one. But when he arrived at the Jersey City induction office in December 1943, he gave Army doctors plenty of reasons to reject him. He told them that an ear injury at birth and subsequent operations were still causing ''running ear'' and ''head noises.'' Furthermore, he claimed to be ''neurotic, afraid to be in crowds, afraid to go in elevator, [wants] to run when surrounded by people'' and had ''been very nervous for four or five years.'' He also complained that he ''wakens tired in the a.m., is run down and undernourished.''</p>
        <p>The doctors didn't question the implausibility of such a celebrity being crowd-averse. Instead, they verified that he had a punctured left eardrum and declared him 4F. (The conservative columnist Westbrook Pegler dubbed him ''bugle-deaf Frankie boy.'')</p>
        <p>As for his other claims, Army doctors concluded he was ''not acceptable material from a psychiatric viewpoint.'' But they downplayed this in their official report. A subsequent inquiry noted that ''inasmuch as the selectee was to be rejected on an organic basis'' -- the  eardrum -- ''the diagnosis of psychoneurosis, severe was not added to the list. Notation of emotional instability was made instead [to] avoid undue unpleasantness for both the selectee and the induction service.''</p>
        <p>The F.B.I. investigated as a result of an anonymous tip (passed on by the columnist Walter Winchell) that Sinatra bribed his way out of the draft. Agents turned up no evidence of that. But what the F.B.I. did find puts the statue debate in a different light.</p>
        <p>Sinatra spent much of the rest of his life trying to compensate for not serving. He entertained American troops in Italy at the end of the war. He recorded special disks just for the G.I.'s on the front lines. And he tried to entertain the boys in Korea, too, but the Army refused to give him a security clearance, suspicious that he might be a Communist (which, it turned out, he wasn't).</p>
        <p>In a way, a statue on that spot would be more than an honor for Sinatra. It would be a vindication.</p>
