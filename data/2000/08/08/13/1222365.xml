        <p>Don Ettlinger, a writer for film, television and theater, died on Monday at a hospital in Nyack, N.Y. He was 86 and lived in Pomona, N.Y.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ettlinger was born in Detroit and attended Stanford University and the University of Chicago. While still an undergraduate, he was hired by 20th Century Fox in Hollywood and, at 21, became one of the youngest contract writers on the Fox lot.</p>
        <p>One of Mr. Ettlinger's early projects, written with Karl Tunberg, was the 1938 film ''Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm,'' starring Shirley Temple. With Mr. Tunberg, Mr. Ettlinger also wrote ''Shipyard Sally'' (1940), which was based on a story by Gracie Fields, Tom Geraghty and Val Valentine, and was a writer of ''The Great American Broadcast''  (1941).</p>
        <p>During World War II, Mr. Ettlinger was in the Army Signal Corps,  stationed in Astoria, Queens, where he made secret Army training films. After the war, he wrote for radio, including the long-running crime show, ''The F.B.I. in Peace and War.''</p>
        <p>In the early days of television, Mr. Ettlinger worked for Studio One and Kraft Television Theater. He was also a writer on the series ''Mama,'' which starred Peggy Wood. Some of the episodes were written with his wife, Katrina Ettlinger, who survives him. He also wrote scripts for soap operas, including ''Love of Life'' and ''The Secret Storm.''</p>
        <p>With Anna Marie Bartow, Mr. Ettlinger was the author of the libretto for ''Ambassador,'' a Broadway musical adaptation of Henry James's novel ''The Ambassadors,'' which starred Howard Keel and Danielle Darrieux.</p>
        <p>In addition to his wife, he is survived by his daughters, Keren Saks of New York City and Victoria Ettlinger of Shokan, N.Y.; a son, Mark, of Los Angeles; and four grandchildren.</p>
