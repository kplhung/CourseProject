        <p>The adaptability, elasticity even, of Gilbert and Sullivan is in evidence in Manhattan these days as two groups present nontraditional versions of ''H.M.S. Pinafore'' and ''The Pirates of Penzance.''</p>
        <p>AT the end of ''The Pirates of Penzance'' by Gilbert and Sullivan, the pirates abandon their criminal ways out of their love for Queen Victoria. In the Gorilla Repertory Theater Company's adaptation, the show ends with the pirates seizing Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, chanting, ''Do your duty, down with Rudy,'' and throwing him overboard.</p>
        <p>That may be one of the more subtle changes. The Gorilla Rep is staging the 121-year-old operetta neither in an opera house nor a theater but aboard a real ship -- the Peking, a four-masted commercial sailing vessel that dates back to 1911 and is permanently docked at the South Street Seaport Museum.</p>
        <p>''I've never directed anything on a ship before; I've never even been on a ship before,'' said Michael Scheman, who wrote the updated adaptation and who directs not just a cast of 20 but frequently the audience. On a recent night, he was busy shooing and occasionally nudging audience members aside to avoid their getting stepped on by the actors. Singers and spectators share the ship's main deck, with the audience following the performers as they move from scene to scene.</p>
        <p>''Every seat in the house is the best seat in the house, because you're changing your seat all the time,'' said Christopher Carter Sanderson, the company's artistic director. ''Actually,'' he corrected himself, ''there is no seat in the house. You have to stand. I guess you could bring a chair if you want.'' The show, which has been cut to 90 minutes, is performed without intermission and runs through Aug. 28.</p>
        <p>Gorilla Rep is best known for annually producing ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' in Washington Square Park, and there is something of the same freewheeling exuberance in this production of a pirate's apprentice who is (satirically) torn between duty (as a plunderer) and love (for the daughter of a major general): the lighting hangs from 15-foot poles that are weighted down on deck, ''backstage'' is a cabin beneath the top deck, and there is a pirate flag with skull and crossbones that ripples from the railing.</p>
        <p>It would take a hopelessly landlocked traditionalist to point out that the original ''Pirates of Penzance'' was not set on a ship at all. The first act is supposed to take place on a ''rocky seashore,'' the second in a ''ruined chapel.''</p>
        <p>Clearly, this is a ''Pirates of Penzance'' not firmly anchored to the original. The Major General dresses like a World War I aviator; the Pirate King like the leather-clad leader of a motorcycle gang; various pirates in punk, in hip-hop, and in drag. There are references to President Clinton, Gov. George W. Bush, Representative Rick A. Lazio, Charlton Heston, Ivana Trump, Kosovo, Watergate, the legalizing of marijuana, cosmetic surgery, the Internet and even ''Kevin Kline in 1980 at the Delacorte,'' a sly allusion to the outdoor production of ''The Pirates of Penzance'' at the theater in Central Park, one that New Yorkers might be most familiar with.</p>
        <p>''It's still more than half Gilbert,'' said Mr. Scheman. ''I just took anything where the audience would go, 'What does that mean?' and changed it.'' In explaining how Ruth, the nursemaid, apprenticed the hero, Frederic, to a pirate rather than a ship's pilot, for example, the original Ruth attributes it to a hearing impairment, singing: ''I was a stupid nurs'rymaid, on breakers always steering,/ And I did not catch the word aright, through being hard of hearing.''</p>
        <p>MR. SCHEMAN'S Ruth (who is played by a man, Patrick McCarthy, in drag) sings: ''I liked my whiskey strong back then, straight up, or so I boasted/ And I did not catch the word quite right from being slightly toasted.''</p>
        <p>It is not just Gilbert's contributions that get worked over. A relatively small amount of the music is in the style in which Sullivan wrote it -- 19th-century light opera. ''Maybe 30 percent,'' said Steven Gross, the musical director and arranger. The rest is rap, rumba, 40's Andrews Sisters, 50's rock 'n' roll, doo-wop, barbershop quartet, New Orleans jazz, mini-spoofs of musicals like ''Rent,''  ''Cats,''  and ''A Chorus Line,'' and one cheerleader rap number inspired by Britney Spears. Still, for all the apparent sacrilege, Mr. Gross said he had remained loyal in his way to the original. ''We changed the harmonies and rhythms,'' he said, ''but the melodies are all G and S.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sanderson said he had wanted to stage ''The Pirates of Penzance'' on the Peking for years, after boarding the ship as a tourist during his first week in New York. ''When people do Gilbert and Sullivan by trying to recreate Victorian England,'' Mr. Sanderson said, ''they're being completely boring. They're really abdicating responsibility. Gilbert and Sullivan created fictitious worlds. You've got to be creative in bringing them to life now.''</p>
