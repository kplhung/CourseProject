        <p>Car rental rates jumped last month, with Hertz taking the first step and the other national companies following immediately. Hertz, usually the industry pacesetter, announced a $3 daily increase for noncorporate renters, effective July 14. The weekly rate for cars reserved 21 days in advance rose $10, and the weekly rate for reservations made at shorter range generally went up $20. Lauren E. Garvey, a spokeswoman, said that rises in vehicle prices, wages and interest rates required the increases, although the company had record earnings for the most recent quarter.</p>
        <p>A week's rental of a midsize Ford in Orlando, Fla., Ms. Garvey said, will cost $271.99 before taxes, up from $261.99, with a reservation made 21 days ahead. The same rental at La Guardia Airport in New York will be $489.99 before taxes instead of $469.99, regardless of reservation time.</p>

        <p>Avis said it was matching the rates, as did Budget and Dollar. Thrifty said a survey of 15 cities where it had franchises showed rates had stayed the same in six, had risen in four and had dropped in five.</p>
