        <p>STACEY LAVENDER isn't a cleaning fanatic, but she plays one at work. Ms. Lavender is the assistant buyer in charge of housewares at Restoration Hardware, the nostalgia-driven national chain, so she is responsible for the 38 cleaning products and tools the company now carries, like Italian-made squeegees in two sizes, Johnson flannel dust cloths, Seeds' Wood Dressing. Ms. Lavender said that the buzz in cleaning right now is microfiber and that Restoration Hardware will be doing a microfiber ''story,'' as the store calls its displays, in white, in January.</p>
        <p>''Microfiber creates static electricity,'' Ms. Lavender explained, ''which means that it literally attracts dust.</p>
        <p>''It's very cool. We'll have a mop, a mitt and a set of three towels. I'm pretty excited.''</p>
        <p>Also coming in January: an eight-foot telescoping cleaning tool with a flood-bulb changer, a cobweb brush and a wool duster.</p>
        <p>Restoration Hardware sells its cleaning products with the same chatty fervor and folksy nostalgia it uses to sell the rest of its wares. For example: ''When I was a kid,'' the squeegee caption on the company's Web site begins, ''there was a guy named Pete who yearly took down and washed our storm windows. . . .'' The Pete story won't win the Booker Prize, but you get the point, that squeegees are iconic objects vibrating with Proustian memories, that squeegees are something worth thinking about.</p>
        <p>On her Web site, Martha Stewart hawks Homekeeping Brushes, ''from a family-run business in Germany that uses only the finest natural materials, including real goat hair, ostrich feathers and solid woods.'' They come in odd and wonderful shapes, like enormous surgical instruments.</p>
        <p>Williams-Sonoma's current catalogs boast an even more impressive and seductive array of cleaning tools, including a gleaming, stainless-steel, hotel-quality, standing dustpan and broom for $95; a beechwood and horsehair extendable broom set for $16 -- ''For sheer luxury as well as utility, natural horsehair is a winner'' the caption reads -- and three Miele vacuum cleaners (the Platinum, at $999, is the best seller).</p>
        <p>''People are spending an enormous amount of money on their homes, and they want to take care of them,'' Richard Harvey, the vice president of merchandising for the Williams-Sonoma catalog, said. ''What we bring to the table is a selection of the absolute best products. A lot of what we carry you can find in restaurants and hotels like that upright dustpan. It's $95, but it will last forever. And you know what? It sells great. And it looks cool. You can't underestimate how something looks. So part of what we're doing is making housewares attractive and not so mundane.''</p>
        <p>Perish the thought! David Brooks, in his book, ''Bobos in Paradise, the New Upper Class and How They Got There'' (Simon &amp; Schuster, $25), writes, ''Educated elites are expected to spend huge amounts of money on things that used to be cheap.'' And so the best Bobos, Mr. Brooks's term for a group he defines as Bohemian bourgeois, find the best microfiber mops, Australian lamb's wool ceiling dusters and professional vacuum cleaners to care for their restaurant-quality kitchens, recycled teak floors and slate-slab bathrooms.</p>
        <p>Cleaning has come out of the broom closet. A home magazine, Dwell, makes its debut this month with a cover line that reads, ''The Most Beautiful Vacuum Cleaners on Earth.'' And aren't they just? From the pink Hello Kitty Sanyo, $89.95, to the Filter Queen Majestic, a ringer for the robot on ''Lost in Space,'' about $1,800. Cleaning has gone all high-tech and looks gender-neutral. You might call it indoor gardening.</p>
        <p>Now, you can brandish your Miele Red Star, $699 (with a telescoping wand for hard-to-reach places), as proudly as you once did your forged-steel Smith &amp; Hawken trowel; debate the attributes of Orange Glo versus Murphy's Oil Soap, as you once debated compost mixes; and deploy with aplomb your Williams-Sonoma Parsley Countertop Scrub ($9.50) on your soapstone counter.</p>
        <p>In her new book, ''Sex and Real Estate: Why We Love Houses'' (Pantheon, $23), Marjorie Garber proposes that many people view houses as objects of sexual and romantic desire. ''By providing not only love objects but love stories, love scenarios,'' writes Ms. Garber, a Harvard University professor, who clearly delights in cultural metaphor, ''the house and its furnishings are doing our living for us.'' In Ms. Garber's world view, spring cleaning is a Roman orgy. What fun!</p>
        <p>A good manual helps. Cheryl Mendelson is a lawyer, a philosophy professor and the author of ''Home Comforts: The Art and Science of Keeping House,'' (Scribner, $35), a hugely comprehensive manual for matters domestic, from mildew removal to accident liability at home.</p>
        <p>Where Martha Stewart, still the benchmark for domestic activity, is Vreelandesque and hortatory -- ''Why don't you clean your silverware drawer?'' -- Ms. Mendelson is  academic, encyclopedic and sometimes very funny, a Mrs. Beeton with a Ph.D. There are now 200,000 copies of ''Home Comforts'' in print. ''It's popped on and off the best-seller lists,'' Beth Wareham, the director of publicity at Simon &amp; Schuster, said. ''The response has sort of blown us away.''</p>
        <p>Even though cleaning house represents only part of the book's scope, ''it is always referred to as 'that cleaning book,' '' Ms. Mendelson said. ''Clearly, that's the part that has touched a nerve,'' she continued. ''I have a friend who is a psychiatrist, and she said, 'Hmm, clean and dirty, that's 2-year-old stuff.' ''</p>
        <p>Ms. Mendelson, who speaks as vigorously and precisely as she writes, continued: ''I do think the job situation has strained the connection to the home. People are working very long hours, and they're living as transients in their own houses. People are literally homesick. Maybe one of the ways they respond is to go and buy all this stuff, to feel rooted and cared for, by caring for their home.''</p>
        <p>Elitism, sex, homesickness --  these are big concepts to swirl around the mop bucket.</p>
        <p>Three years ago, Margaret Horsfield, a BBC journalist who lives in British Columbia, published a book called ''Biting the Dust: The Joys of Housework'' (St. Martins Press). It's a discursive social history of cleaning in this country, a tale of germ warfare and societal pressures, strewn with weird and wonderful personal anecdotes, of looking for Mr. Clean and never finding him.</p>
        <p>''The funny thing was how much ink the book got,'' Ms. Horsfield said. ''Not many people bought it, but everyone wanted to write about it, because, it turned out, every reviewer wanted to confess his or her cleaning practices. There's a lot of emotion around the subject.''</p>
        <p>Before too long, I found myself confessing to Ms. Horsfield. I told her about how the skirting boards in my house dominate my thoughts, and how I find myself stopping work every hour or so to run an old T-shirt over the notched surfaces. I told her about the Miele vacuum cleaner I bought last month, the entry-level model purchased for $319 at the Reliance Vacuum Cleaner Company in Middletown, R.I. It doesn't have a telescoping wand, but it does have a swiveling head. In any case, it is awfully pretty.</p>
        <p>My friend, Ramona, who washes her floors every night and likes to call me after the deed (''It's done!'' she'll breathe into the phone), had sent me to Reliance for Crush, the store's own citrusy wood-floor cleaner, which trumps Murphy's. Five hundred dollars later, I had my new Miele, the Crush, a mop ''system,'' stainless steel polish, hospital-grade tile cleaner and three empty spray bottles. I told Ms. Horsfield I had never been happier.</p>
