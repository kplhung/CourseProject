        <p>Most of the Democrats gathering this week in Los Angeles for their national convention don't know yet who John Witchel is.

        <p>Most of the Democrats gathering this week in Los Angeles for their national convention don't know yet who John Witchel is. But he and his friends are planning to crash the Democrats' party with a straightforward message: they want in. ''We already drive every significant sector of the economy,'' Witchel says. ''The keys to the kingdom are squarely in our hands. I'm here to say there's a next generation of Internet executives, and we're ready to become national political players.''</p>
        <p>John Witchel is a big, driven man, a former Stanford jock with a booming voice. At 32, he is running his third successful company, the San Francisco-based Red Gorilla, while serving on the boards of seven other Internet start-ups. But Witchel's current obsession is not business but politics -- an arena he feels is ripe for the attention of entrepre-neurs. ''Priced today,'' he says, sounding slightly surprised by his dis-covery, ''politics is the bargain of the century. For $10 million you could do anything.''</p>
        <p>Not that Witchel is interested in buying politicians. What he wants, simply, is to be a political somebody, ''one of a small handful of trusted people,'' as he puts it, ''who can be helpful when needed.'' So Witchel has just helped start a new enterprise, PAC.com, a political action committee aimed at centrist Democrats. Along with Witchel, the main organizers include his Red Gorilla colleague Wade Randlett, Tim Newell of E*Offering, Joe Kraus of Excite@home, Chris Larsen of E-Loan and E. David Ellington of NetNoir. While these power brokers lack the star power of Hollywood, they have an even more glamorous currency that they plan to start handing out: equity.</p>
        <p>For starters, PAC.com's 20 members will each contribute $1,000 a month in plain old cash to politicians who meet with them for dinner and conversation. (This year, they're focusing on Congress, where a small group has more ''leverage,'' and not on the presidential race.) That's the traditional part; what's new is that members will also give stock in their pre-I.P.O. or newly public companies to PAC.com to put into a kitty and disburse over time. ''We can cash it out and give it to a politician,'' explains Randlett, ''and say here's five grand. Or we can say here's $5,000 worth of shares; you hang on to it and see where it goes.''</p>
        <p>This kind of equity could have vast implications for the world of politics. If Joe Kraus of Excite, for example, had contributed just $1,000 worth of stock to a senator right when the company went public in April 1996, three years later, even after some scary losses and plunges, that senator would have had $15,992 to spend on campaigning.</p>
        <p>It's a pretty tempting proposition, though even tech-friendly politicians express reservations. Representative Adam Smith, a Democrat from Washington and the campaign chairman for the New Democrat Network, which has worked hard to forge links to high tech, believes that few candidates will be willing to play the market with their campaign budgets. After all, the stock could just as easily be eToys as Excite.</p>
        <p>Smith does believe, however, that the identification with PAC.com and its pool of stock might ''help brand candidates a little bit further'' by linking them to the New Economy. Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont doesn't accept money from PAC's himself, but he, too, sees the appeal of the idea. ''I think it's an intriguing way for young dot-com people to participate,'' says Leahy, who has long championed Internet issues. ''It makes sense to them. As far as ethics, the bottom line is, whenever you take any donation, it's reported, it's public knowledge. Whether you take cash from or stock in Polluters-R''-Us.com, if you're voting against an environmental issue, the public will know.''</p>
        <p>If politicians are cautious, campaign-finance reformers have already made up their minds. ''A sweetheart deal in pre-I.P.O. stock has a back-room stench to it, even if it's legal,'' charges E. Joshua Rosenkranz, president of the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law, which has been studying campaign finance. ''If you believe contribution limits mean anything, then making a contribution that explodes in value within a few days is a blatant subversion of them.''</p>
        <p>Ronald Turovsky, a partner at Manatt, Phelps &amp; Phillips in Los Angeles and the election-law specialist who is advising PAC.com, sounds unconcerned, however, and asserts that he has ''no doubt'' that it's appropriate for politicians to receive stocks. ''There's nothing in the F.E.C. regulations or statutes that would prohibit it,'' he says. In fact, in correspondence with PAC.com, officials at the Federal Elections Commission affirmed the plan to give out stock.</p>
        <p>While PAC.com is a small, start-up operation, it is undoubtedly what its founders like to call, in Internet jargon, ''scalable'': other PAC's and individuals from around the country can borrow the idea and take it where they want to. For better or worse, the world of campaign finance is likely to change. Like so much else in American culture, politics will be pulled even further into the orbit of the stock market and the Internet economy. And along with it, the influence of men like John Witchel stands to grow.</p>
        <p>When Microsoft first got into trouble with the justice department, the established tech companies, who used to keep their distance from national politics, swiftly beefed up their lobbying operations and began playing the Washington game. PAC.com, however, represents a different trend; its members have little patience for doing government affairs by the book and tend to see the big computer companies as hopelessly old-fashioned. ''The C.E.O.'s who ruled Silicon Valley five years ago are middle-aged and corporate,'' Witchel says disdainfully. ''Our guys are in their 20's and 30's. They have 25 employees. They don't have lobbyists. They don't go to Business Roundtable meetings.''</p>
        <p>Witchel and his allies don't even look like traditional Silicon Valley types; they're more frat boy than geek. At 40, Tim Newell calls himself ''the old man'' of the group; a husky Vermonter, he towers over most Internet executives like a football player among chess-club nerds. Newell, a former White House aide turned investment banker, runs E*Offering, which enables individuals to invest in I.P.O.'s online. Joe Kraus, a founder of Excite, is a goateed 29-year-old; his company, begun in a burrito shop during his senior year at Stanford, had a market value early this month of $5 billion. David Ellington, the cigar-smoking, 40-year-old C.E.O. of NetNoir, runs the Web's leading black-oriented site. Chris Larsen, 39, a windsurfing enthusiast, is the founder and C.E.O. of E-Loan, an online lending service whose original interface he programmed himself. Wade Randlett, 35, who favors tailor-made suits, was a Democratic political consultant who helped found Silicon Valley's first PAC, the Technology Network, in 1997 -- hands-down the single person who defined high-tech fund-raising,'' says Newell.</p>
        <p>''We're like NASA was in the 60's,'' claims David Ellington. ''Then, everyone wanted to hang out with the astronauts. Now everyone wants to be down with the future.''</p>
        <p>These self-styled ''Astronauts'' are largely Democrats. They made their fortunes on Bill Clinton's watch and became natural allies of his centrist, pro-trade, ''New Democrat'' agenda. Of course, plenty of Internet entrepreneurs remain Republicans; George Bush has raised millions in Silicon Valley, and Republican congressmen like J.C. Watts of Oklahoma have made pilgrimages there to court high-tech supporters. But Witchel and his fellow PAC.com members share a Northern California ethos that makes them culturally out of tune with traditional Republican values. PAC.commers say they care about choice and the environment. They don't want the Ten Commandments posted in schools. They love making money and are perfectly comfortable doing it alongside homosexuals and foreigners. What they see in Gore and the New Democrats are politicians who will not only respect their style but who will also make sure that their industry stays as unregulated, un-unionized and untaxed as possible.</p>
        <p>Already, PAC.com has established what Randlett calls ''a strategic co-marketing agreement'' with the New Democrat Network, a group of pro-business Capitol Hill Democrats who borrow freely from the metaphors and values of the New Economy in their quest to modernize their party and wean it away from the labor unions and old-line liberals. In just four years, billing itself as ''a venture capital fund for the Democratic Party,'' the group has become the largest caucus in the House, with 65 members. It now has 14 New Democrat Senators as well, and it runs its own PAC and recruits, promotes and finances promising centrist candidates. Simon Rosenberg, 35, the president and founder of the New Democrat Network, has made alliances with Silicon Valley a central part of his political strategy from the beginning. Rosenberg recognizes that Internet entrepreneurs need politicians, as Newell says, in order ''to be in the conversation.'' They want access, relationships and connections in Washington.</p>
        <p>There are plenty of issues on the table in Washington right now - Internet taxation, privacy regulations, export controls, visas for high-tech immigrant workers -- that Witchel and his group might want to weigh in on. But the PAC.commers insist that they're less interested in short-term lobbying for a specific agenda than in building networks of influence. ''Look at where the great power bases of the world are,'' argues Witchel. ''One is in venture capital. Another is in Washington, D.C. Just as I spend an enormous amount of time getting to know investment bankers before I actually need their money, I do the same with politicians.''</p>
        <p>Behind Witchel's approach is a firm belief that Internet businesses are models for how all social and political institutions can work more effectively. The young entrepreneurs of PAC.com tend to use the buzz words of the Internet economy to describe every facet of life. They want to ''disintermediate'' political go-betweens and substitute their own networks for established political machines. They want to ''identify an expanded target market'' and then ''aggregate high-net-worth individuals'' to change the base of support for the Democratic Party. As Newell boasts, PAC.com's modest goal is to ''transform the business of politics and the politics of business.''</p>
        <p>In the end, Newell says, politics is the same as investment banking: ''You have a product, you have to go out and raise money.'' He chuckles. ''PAC.com is just old-fashioned grass-roots politics -- grass-roots organizing of millionaires.''</p>
        <p>PAC.com, for the moment, eschews soft-money donations -- the uncapped gifts to political parties rather than individual candidates -- but other high-tech figures have begun experimenting with the system. Marc Andreessen, the 29-year-old founder of Netscape, chairman of Loudcloud and ber-geek, is part of PAC.com's broader network. He has been hanging out with Vice President Al Gore for years and recently dropped a quarter of a million dollars on the Democratic National Committee. It is, Andreessen admits, ''a lot'' by the standards of politics. ''But in my world,'' he adds, ''if I invested just $250,000 in a new company, they might think I wasn't all that serious.''</p>
        <p>The difference between the value of money in Silicon Valley and in Washington -- what Andreessen calls ''arbitrage'' -- gets the attention of young entrepreneurs.If you think there's a lot of money in politics now,'' Andreessen says, ''you haven't seen anything yet.''</p>
        <p>In the world view of PAC.com, that's nothing to be afraid of; politicians are merely the last ones to get dealt into the game. After all, in the New Economy, argues Witchel, everyone from receptionists to C.E.O.'s is getting paid in stock already. ''It's just the way we do business,'' he declares. ''Doesn't it make sense for everyone to participate in the same system?''</p>
        <p>Campaign-finance watchdogs certainly don't think so. At a time when the market's reach into every corner of civic life seems almost unchecked, critics ask, why make politics, too, dependent on stock prices? ''Candidates are already treated as commodities to be invested in; we might as well slap logos on them,'' says Rosenkranz. ''Contributing stock is the perfect completion of the circle.''</p>
        <p>Witchel himself is torn. He'll exalt the power of skyrocketing stock options one minute, then turn around and critique the culture that has grown up around them. ''The thing about Silicon Valley that's a problem for me,'' he says, ''is when it's just about money. It's spiritually bankrupt. People get rich, they start to smell like money, dress like money. It makes the whole culture ugly and hollow.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps that's what politics offers to the callow entrepreneurs of Silicon Valley: a spiritual dimension, a meaningful, civic-minded pursuit beyond the world of business and money. But first they have to buy their way in.</p>
