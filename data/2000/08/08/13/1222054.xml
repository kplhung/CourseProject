        <p>ALEC GUINNESS, who died last weekend at the age of 86, was the last of the great knights who found their early fame in the legendary pre-World War II English theater.

        <p>His self-presentation was more modest, though his talents belied that modesty; his manner was deceptively ordinary. Even when he was called on to lend stature to a commercial Hollywood project -- appearing, to pick the obvious example, as Obi-Wan Kenobi in ''Star Wars'' (1977) -- he offered wit and immaculate training rather than an outsize personality. His typical approach was to burrow into a character or line-draw it rather than paint it in broad strokes.</p>

        <p>ALEC GUINNESS, who died last weekend at the age of 86, was the last of the great knights who found their early fame in the legendary pre-World War II English theater. But the others -- Michael Redgrave, Ralph Richardson, Laurence Olivier, John Gielgud -- shared a grandeur of technique, a high-romantic flamboyance, that was never Sir Alec's province.</p>
        <p>His self-presentation was more modest, though his talents belied that modesty; his manner was deceptively ordinary. Even when he was called on to lend stature to a commercial Hollywood project -- appearing, to pick the obvious example, as Obi-Wan Kenobi in ''Star Wars'' (1977) -- he offered wit and immaculate training rather than an outsize personality. His typical approach was to burrow into a character or line-draw it rather than paint it in broad strokes.</p>
        <p>There were glorious exceptions: his Fagin in David Lean's 1948 film of ''Oliver Twist''; the master criminal Marcus, with his ghastly, gigantic teeth, in ''The Ladykillers''; the renegade artist Gulley Jimson in ''The Horse's Mouth.'' But even his most extravagant performances could not be considered, as those of his peers often were, as the last traces of the 19th-century theatrical impulse, immense and lit by lightning. He came across as more distinctly middle class than they did, and his brand of daring was subtler and more interior.</p>
        <p>American audiences rarely had the opportunity to see Sir Alec onstage, though photographs of him as Hamlet and Macbeth and Richard III, in Gogol and Ionesco, Shaw and Eliot, might rouse the longing of any theatergoer. Fortunately for us, beginning in the late 1940's he concentrated most of his energy on his film work.</p>
        <p>He made approximately five dozen movies, including a series of comedies that defined the wiry eccentricity of British humor in the 50's (''The Lavender Hill Mob,'' ''The Man in the White Suit,''  ''The Promoter,''  ''The Captain's Paradise,''  ''The  Ladykillers,''  ''The Horse's Mouth,''  ''Our Man in Havana'') and the dramatic blockbuster ''The Bridge on the River Kwai'' (1957), which won him an Academy Award.</p>
        <p>It was his gift for shape-shifting that excited the most admiration for Sir Alec's performances. A viewer who saw him as the ginger-haired Scots lieutenant colonel, all macho bluster and poisonous envy, in ''Tunes of Glory'' in 1960 and then as the wry, cautious, silken-voiced Arab, Prince Feisal, in ''Lawrence of Arabia'' two years later might well be dazzled. And his invention went beyond actorly tricks: switching characters, he moved from heart to heart, not merely from surface to surface.</p>
        <p>Film history offers few performances that are as cerebral yet as touched with feeling as his portrait of an incarcerated priest in ''The Prisoner'' (1955). And in his last major piece of acting, in the 1988 movie ''Little Dorrit,'' he travels so far inside the narcissism of Dickens's William Dorrit, who continues to play the role of a Victorian gentleman while languishing in debtor's prison, that he renders the man's folly tragic.</p>
        <p>Put another way, Sir Alec could orchestrate the surface of a performance so that the depths of the character resonated beneath it. Colonel Nicholson's walk through the jungles of ''The Bridge on the River Kwai,'' for instance, dogged beneath his exhaustion, with little flecks of manic resoluteness in his weary eyes, suggests an intricate machine, vulnerable to nicks and scratches but mysteriously unstoppable. Nicholson would claim that the mechanism that keeps him going is his ability to reason like a civilized Englishman; we might call it madness -- and Sir Alec's performance is a pendulum that swings between the two.</p>
        <p>Even in a light comedy like ''The Captain's Paradise'' (1953), the permutations in style signal the emotional range of the character. The hero, a steamer captain, enjoys two different lifestyles, each with a wife to match his mood. Sir Alec gives him a florid physicality in the Malta scenes, more gestural, more vaudevillian, while in Gibraltar he dons a Noel Coward-like dry wit to match his fussiness and formality.</p>
        <p>Henry St. James in ''The Captain's Paradise'' is one of a group of Guinness creations that gets at a certain type of unmistakably British man, an ordinary fellow buoyed by dreams of transcendence and blessed with the ingenuity to make them come true. And amazing as the actor is in ''River Kwai'' and in his star turn portraying all eight members of a titled family in the 1949 black comedy ''Kind Hearts and Coronets,'' his greatest achievement may have been the development of this secretly pining Everyman character, in movies like ''Last Holiday,''  ''The Lavender Hill Mob,''  ''The Man in the White Suit,''  ''The Promoter'' and ''Our Man in Havana.'' (His justly acclaimed George Smiley in the television adaptation of John Le Carre's ''Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy'' is a curdled older version of the same figure.)</p>
        <p>These aren't interchangeable roles. For instance, Holland in ''The Lavender Hill Mob'' is a bank employee who schemes to rob one of the transports of gold bullion that he is paid to oversee, while Stratton in ''The Man in the White Suit'' invents a cloth that doesn't wear out or get dirty. But these two performances are a matched set -- studies in the quiet megalomania of small men.</p>
        <p>STRATTON is more blatantly obsessed: he has a crazy flicker in his eye, and he seems unfazed by the destruction his experiments end up causing. Holland keeps his obsession in check, but we see it in his precise way of picking a sliver of gold off his shoe with his cane, or in the way he leans back, puffed up with newfound pride, when one of his illicit partners offhandedly calls him ''boss.''</p>
        <p>Though their tones are different, these comedies, both classics, are linked: the frivolous adventure of a man who fools the world into thinking he's a dullard while cooking up a plot to make himself a millionaire, and the satirical tale of a mundane factory employee who dreams up a product so revolutionary that management and labor conspire to suppress it.</p>
        <p>In the opening scenes of ''Last Holiday,'' my own favorite of these pictures, Sir Alec wears a mustache that doesn't quite sit right on his mug; he gives the impression of a little guy desperate to look dapper. He plays George Bird, a salesman who, mistakenly told he has only a few months to live, takes the first holiday of his life, at a rural hotel that caters to clients of a more moneyed class. J. B. Priestley's story is an ironic fable; Sir Alec's performance puts flesh on its bones and makes it deeply affecting. This is some of the best acting he ever did, encompassing emotions like bitterness and fury that few other movies gave him a chance to play.</p>
        <p>When George learns that his days are numbered, he seems pinioned against the air by the shocking news. But then it liberates him -- he walks through his life with his eyes pressed open for the first time. He speaks his mind and acts as if he belonged among the swells, and suddenly he finds that all the doors that have been closed to him his whole life are suddenly thrown wide.</p>
        <p>This startlingly alert performance has been largely forgotten, but it's available on video. I can't think of a sweeter way to mark the passing of Alec Guinness than to take a look at it.</p>
