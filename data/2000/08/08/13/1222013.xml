        <p>BY now, it's almost a consensus among Internet pundits that the future of the Web rests in the hands -- or, perhaps more appropriately, the palms -- of those who make wireless Internet devices and software. Why would consumers want to be shackled to a desktop computer, the thinking goes, when they could roam freely with a hand-held device that gives them everything they need?</p>
        <p>Since mobile Internet devices like Web-connected cellular phones and so-called personal digital assistants (P.D.A.'s) like the Palm VII were born and bred for on-the-road use, futurists have dreamed up especially rosy scenarios for travel applications.</p>
        <p>But that's the problem. Nearly all the talk surrounding mobile Internet devices and applications is in the future tense.</p>
        <p>You will be able to program your phone to call you when you're on the road and alert you to shoes that are on sale, in your size, at the store you happen to be walking past at that moment. You will be able to tap the screen a couple of times on your cell phone  and have a guide tell you about a tourist site without actually having to have a human near you. (Heaven forbid that should happen.)</p>
        <p>And on it goes. The reality is that today's wireless Internet offerings look a lot like the wired Internet offerings of 1995.  They're useful if you have patience and are willing to spend the money on the hardware and the connection time. But they can also present frustrating limitations.</p>
        <p>The good news is that, because businesses see such huge demand for wireless Internet gizmos, it won't take five years for the technology to improve dramatically. Some particularly useful travel applications, in fact, are arriving en masse this summer.</p>
        <p>Nearly every company that caters to the traveler has some semblance of a wireless Internet strategy and is working hard to refine it. For instance, Travelocity offers wireless users the option of checking their flight status, and by summer's end will allow users to change their flight itineraries from their wireless phones. So if you get off your plane and discover -- along with the other 200 people on the plane -- that your connecting flight has been canceled, you can conceivably skip the mad dash to the customer service desk and simply call up the Travelocity site to make the change.</p>
        <p>Trip.com already has such a feature. By pushing a button on a cell phone, you get options for rebooking your flight. So if you are late for a flight or have already missed it, you can select from the next available flights, press a button and see a confirmation number on the screen.</p>
        <p>Like many such services, this feature requires a little work beforehand on a desktop computer. Typically, users must register personal information and a credit card number with the site -- or, in Trip .com's case, book a flight with the site -- so they can avoid the maddening task of inputting numbers and text on a wireless device.</p>
        <p>I recently tested a Palm VII, the latest technological wizardry. It retails for about $500, with unlimited Internet access through Palm.net for about $45 a month. I pretended I was lost going home from an appointment, and tapped on the MapQuest.com icon.</p>
        <p>As with most other Internet sites on wireless devices, MapQuest has, in the interest of speed, modified its site to include only bare essentials -- no photos, no graphics.  MapQuest started me immediately with a form to fill in addresses for directions.</p>
        <p>It took a lot of tapping to get the addresses typed in, but about five minutes later, I had step-by-step directions home. Buoyed by my success, I checked the status of an imaginary flight I was taking to San Francisco. I went to the Travelocity site on my Palm and tapped the icon for departure and arrival information, and it told me the scheduled times for departure and arrival. Then it informed me that the actual times of departure and arrival were '':61???'' and '':92???*'' respectively. Lower down on the screen, the site told me the asterisk denotes the estimated arrival time, which helped clear things up tremendously.</p>
        <p>My trusty cell phone was next. I tried to get directions, but that involved entering  text using the phone's keypad. For this, you hold down the ''2'' button, for instance, until the screen shows the letter ''C,'' then press the ''7'' button until you get an ''S,'' and so on. Talk about a recipe for road rage.</p>
        <p>After about 10 minutes of this, my phone told me that my home address did not exist, which made me consider driving my car over my phone so that it, too, did not exist.</p>
        <p>The number of Americans who use wireless devices to gain access to the Internet  will be about 1.3 million by year's end --  most through cell phones, with P.D.A.'s like the Palm VII accounting for roughly 300,000, according to the Yankee Group, a technology consulting firm. Analysts and executives say that will grow to 38 million by 2002, with 30 million cell phones connected to the Internet.</p>
        <p>One reason for the sudden growth is that the next generation of wireless Internet devices will likely combine the phone and the Personal Digital Assistant, eliminating  the cost of multiple units. Next year's cell phone/P.D.A.s will also likely have touch screens, with prices comparable to or lower than today's units, and faster connections.</p>
        <p>Today's wireless devices typically connect at speeds of about 14 kilobits to 19 kilobits per second, a far cry from a 56-kbps modem, but because the sites have done their best to create text-only presentations, the sluggish connection is not too much of a burden. And as connection speeds increase, Internet connection fees should drop, analysts said, because telecommunications companies will find other ways to pay the freight of the service, such as getting a percentage of transactions made by users.</p>
        <p>At the same time, offerings from Internet sites will improve quickly, giving users more reason to get unplugged, as it were. Zagat, for instance, now lets wireless users get the names of restaurants in different cities, review their ratings, and press a button to call the establishment. Starting in the fall, the reservation will be made by pushing a button; in November, hotel and spa ratings and reservations will be added.</p>
        <p>Through a service called Tellme (www.tellme.com), users can look up Zagat's content -- and that of other Web sites -- by speaking their requests into the phone. There is something odd about speaking into a phone to get Internet content, but for someone who doesn't want to risk life and limb to look at the screen on their cell phone or P.D.A., the service is comforting.</p>
        <p>For travelers who want to take in a show or a sporting event while on the road, Ticketmaster-CitySearch offers wireless options -- and, notably, options that don't require you to type in ''Hootie and the Blowfish'' on your cell phone. Through the Ticketmaster wireless site, users choose a city and their area of interest, such as music or sports, and choices appear on the screen. If users have already registered their credit card information with Ticketmaster on its  nonwireless Web page (www.ticketmaster .com), they can buy tickets with a press of a button or a tap on their P.D.A. screen.</p>
        <p>Such oases will be increasingly common. And while such features will be enough to lure some of the more technology-addicted travelers to hand-held devices, for those who want more potency and less potential from their wireless, it's a wait-till-next-year story.</p>
