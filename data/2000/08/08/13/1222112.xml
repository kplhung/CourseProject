        <p>IT was a new experience for Tim Connors, the Iona Prep golfer who won every individual and team championship available to him as a junior this past season.</p>
        <p>He has always found that he, a golf club and a golf ball go a long way together.</p>
        <p>Fiddling with his father's clubs on the driving range at 2, he could hit the ball straight even then. By 13, he was outdistancing his father, Tim Connors Sr. Now, at 17, a sturdy 6-footer, he booms tee shots 290 yards, then invariably looks back at the opposition's lie.</p>
        <p>But this summer, while honing his game on the prestigious American Junior Golf Association summer tour, he got off a typical long tee shot in Dallas and waited patiently for his playing partners. ''One kid hit it 15 yards past me,'' he said. ''And then did it again.''</p>
        <p>And again.</p>
        <p>''This was something new,'' Connors said from his home in Rye, where he is recuperating from a wrist injury suffered in the Dallas competition. ''As long as I can remember I've always hit a long way. I've always been there.''</p>
        <p>Or beyond. They still talk about a 330-yard hole in a Florida competition last year.</p>
        <p>''I decided to go for it,'' Connors said. ''I remember the ball rolling off the back of the green and everyone just looking at me.''</p>
        <p>The Iona Prep coach, Kevin O'Meara, credits Connors's ''near-perfect swing.''</p>
        <p>''It's not that he tries to overpower the ball,'' O'Meara said, ''he just has a nice, fluid swing. Good hip action, good transfer of weight. That's where the power comes from.</p>
        <p>''Rarely does he not hit it straight. And his game has improved every year because he works as hard as anyone I've ever coached at it. And practicing gives you confidence.''</p>
        <p>The coach then pointed out a match during Connors's sophomore year.</p>
        <p>''He was down by two holes with four holes to go,'' O'Meara said. ''I looked at him questioningly, and he said confidently: 'It's just a matter of time. I've got to get my swing in sync.' He then won the last four holes.''</p>
        <p>Connors said: ''From what people have told me, I have a little more potential than a lot of players. But I think I just want it more. I want to go to the top level.''</p>
        <p>Connors and his best friend, Brian Fitzpatrick of Harrison, the No. 2 at Iona Prep, dominated rivals all season. The Gaels not only went undefeated but also won the city and Catholic team championships as well. Connors was 17-1 in dual meets, and Fitzpatrick, splitting time with baseball, was 13-0. Connors then won the showdown of the Catholic high school and city public school all stars with a sterling 68 at the Pelham-Split Rock course with Fitzpatrick third. Then they went on the junior tour together for the summer.</p>
        <p>''The tour can be aggravating,'' Connors said, referring to ''meeting people who can outdrive and outscore you.'' He added: ''It's really good competition -- everybody can shoot really good numbers. But you're on great golf courses at nice resorts. It's a great experience.''</p>
        <p>In Detroit, Connors finished 11th of 90, then improved to 5th of 95 in Charlotte with Fitzpatrick not far behind.</p>
        <p>''We've been friends since we were 4 so there's really not a rivalry,'' Connors said. ''It's great to be out on a course during a match and have your best friend right there with you.</p>
        <p>''Pretty much every time Brian and I go away, we have some funny experience, too. In Michigan, our hotel room smelled so bad, we couldn't stand to be in it. But at night, after a full day of golf, it didn't matter, we just fell asleep.''</p>
        <p>He promises not to be caught napping when he and his mended wrist return to the junior tour tomorrow in St. Lawrence, N.Y.</p>
        <p>''There are still events in St. Lawrence, Hartford and Cape Cod,'' Connors said. ''Hopefully, if everything goes well, I can win one or two of them.''</p>
        <p>What about beyond high school and the junior tour?</p>
        <p>''College and college golf are definitely in my plans,'' said Connors, who added that he is planning to major in business. But no one is ruling out a shot at the professional tour.</p>
        <p>''That's up to Timmy,'' O'Meara said. ''But I've watched how hard he works for a long time. If Timmy wants it, he can do it.''</p>
        <p>FOR THE RECORD  Correction:  August 20, 2000, Sunday  An article last Sunday about Tim Connors, a golfer, misstated the record of the Iona Prep golf team. It was not undefeated; it lost one match, to Fordham Prep.</p>
