        <p>Dreaming of a convention gleaming with purity, Gore aides and Democratic officials bullied and blackmailed Representative Loretta Sanchez of California until she tearfully canceled her fund-raiser at the Playboy Mansion.</p>
        <p>So much for the shapely former Playmates Ms. Sanchez hired as ''docents,'' Hef in satin pj's and those bodacious blond twins on Hef's arms.</p>
        <p>Pressuring the spunky lawmaker to switch to a less libidinous site, the Gore team held hostage her prime-time speaking slot at the convention and threatened to yank her credentials, fire her as the Democratic Party's general co-chairwoman and withhold support for her campaign.</p>
        <p>Finally, after a three-month contest of wills, Ms. Sanchez caved on Friday and agreed to move the fund-raiser if the Democrats could come up with a place with ''that kind of cachet,'' as she put it, so all her donors would still show.</p>
        <p>That got me thinking.</p>
        <p>Where could the Democrats go to raise a pile of dough, a place with that same louche cachet -- a place associated with a superannuated roue, young buxom playthings, historic sexual significance?</p>
        <p>A place where Hollywood celebrities like Jack Nicholson and Leonardo DiCaprio hang? A place where the randy, retro goings-on have made conservatives screech and feminists blanch?</p>
        <p>Oh, yeah. What about the Oval Office?</p>
        <p>It's perfect, really. Why do the Democrats need the Playboy Mansion when they already have the Executive Mansion? The party has used its Pennsylvania Avenue pleasure dome to shake down millions in the last eight years. Instead of carting her off to Universal Studios, why not let Ms. Sanchez borrow the White House for one boogie night to raise money to enlist Hispanic voters?</p>
        <p>When Al Gore was a senator, he used to give metaphor dinners, at which participants would ponder the meaning of the metaphor. Clearly, the vice president has elevated the Playboy Mansion to a metaphor.</p>
        <p>Al Gore and Joe Lieberman are no longer satisfied with being hall monitors. The men who want to lead the party of free expression and civil liberties are scuttling away from the Playboy in Chief so fast they are charging into Cotton Mather territory. They are so determined to erase the memory of an X-rated president that they proselytize for everything to be G-rated.</p>
        <p>Perhaps Mr. Gore would be better off if he had held dinners to discuss the meaning of irony. Then he would understand how risible this seems.</p>
        <p>You can't accept $1,500 in donations from the Hefners and then get on a high horse when a fellow Democrat wants to use the Hefners' house to solicit donations. You can't defend Bill Clinton over a romp with an intern, calling him ''one of our greatest presidents,'' and then treat Loretta Sanchez like a reprobate. You can't back Mr. Clinton on selling the Lincoln Bedroom to fat cats, and then mug Ms. Sanchez because she tries to lure fat cats with a famous venue.</p>
        <p>You can't fix your problem with women voters by bashing Bunnies. The president did something lecherous in a staid place; the congresswoman merely tried to do something staid in a lecherous place.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore may have dragged one congresswoman into line, but he'll never match W.'s disciplined convention. The Clintons are out of control, gluttonously and gracelessly gobbling millions for the Arkansas library and New York campaign that should go to the lagging Democratic ticket.</p>
        <p>Democrats had been pressuring Mr. Clinton to say in his convention speech that Mr. Gore should not be blamed for his wayward ways.</p>
        <p>But the president has told friends he wants to make the best speech of his life, going out like Babe Ruth, who hit three homers in his last game. So he decided to ''purge'' a few days early and get that out of the way. But his self-involved, conveniently timed apologia only served to remind everyone about how the White House lost its dignity, underscoring W.'s plaints.</p>
        <p>On top of that, Hillary and Bill have begun talking up the idea that she really was the co-president all along, but they had to keep it quiet.</p>
        <p>So where does all this leave Al?</p>
        <p>If Hillary was second banana, was he third? And will he be relegated to a spot in the lineup behind the Sultan of Political Swat swinging to knock it out of the park?</p>
        <p>Well, at least Mr. Gore crushed Ms. Sanchez. So he has one good Godzilla vs. Bambi moment under his belt.</p>
