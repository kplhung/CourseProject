        <p>For 11 years, the National Debt Clock glowered from its perch on the Avenue of the Americas and grimly flashed to passers-by the government's growing financial woes, racking up an average of $10,000 a second in national debt.</p>
        <p>The clock was the brainchild of Seymour Durst, the former president of the Durst Organization, a commercial real estate firm that owns and maintains the clock. He  wanted a vivid way to show Americans how big the national debt was, and also to nudge elected officials to do something about it. He died in 1995.</p>
        <p>According to Douglas Durst, Seymour's son and the president of the Durst Organization, his father had always been politically active, but he was particularly vocal about his concerns about the national debt. He sent letters to legislators and paid for advertisements, Mr. Durst said.</p>
        <p>During the holiday season in 1980, the elder Durst sent a card that said ''Happy New Year. Your share of the national debt is $35,000'' to senators and congressmen,  Mr. Durst said.</p>
        <p>But a lot has changed since 1989 when the clock first started ticking.</p>
        <p>During the clock's tenure, the national debt grew from just under $3 trillion to more than $5 trillion.</p>
        <p>But the country's economic picture has gotten much rosier -- so much so that since June, the clock has been running backward to reflect the decreasing debt.</p>
        <p>''I'm very pleased it has served its purpose, but the debt's going down now,'' Mr. Durst said. ''The whole point of it was to show the debt going up. It did what it was supposed to do.''</p>
        <p>Douglas Durst said he was unsure as to what he will do with the clock, but it is to be covered with a shroud at a ceremony on Sept. 7. A red, white, and blue sign that says ''The National Debt Clock'' will hang in front of it.</p>
        <p>''In case we need it again,'' Mr. Durst said. ''I hope we won't, but you never know what could happen to the debt again.''</p>
