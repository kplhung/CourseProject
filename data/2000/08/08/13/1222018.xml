        <p>Divided by allegiance and an aisle, David Gottesman and Si Wachsberger awaited the vote of the Beachwood, Ohio, Planning and Zoning Commission on agenda item 96-63. Normally, half a dozen spectators might sit through the commission's business of density, setbacks and demolition permits. Tonight 400 packed the recreation room of City Hall, scrambling to grab the last empty seats, milling three-deep along the rear windows. Television crews assembled along one wall.</p>
        <p>Fifteen years of history led to the evening when a Cleveland suburb that was 83 percent Jewish would decide whether to allow its Orthodox residents to construct several religious buildings. In the language of municipal land use, it required a shift in zoning from U-1, A-2 to U-5, from residential to institutional, from four unkempt houses and a stretch of brambly woods to a landscaped campus of two synagogues, two ritual baths, a girls' day school, two playgrounds and three paved parking lots. Nearly two hours into the meeting, the chairman polled his members. Carlin: Nay. . . . Davis: Nay. . . . Gorden: Nay. . . . Seconds later, when the roll call was over, all six members, every one a Jew, had voted against the project. Then an Orthodox resident rushed toward the dais screaming: ''Haman! Haman!'' -- referring to the villain of the Purim holiday, a royal official who plotted to exterminate ancient Persia's Jews.</p>
        <p>Behind his oval glasses, beneath his groomed, dark blond hair, David Gottesman, a Modern Orthodox Jew, looked at the protester with sympathetic rage. Now 46, he had devoted the last seven years to the campus project, seen the land bought, the architects hired, the papers filed and refiled to address every civic concern. After all that, he heard some campus opponent angrily say the previous week that the Orthodox were going to turn Beachwood into a ''little Jerusalem.''</p>
        <p>Here was David, a doctor who didn't wear a kippa, or skullcap, on the job, whose wife didn't cover her hair, whose boys played in the local softball league, and his own neighbors were treating him like some black hat throwing rocks at Sabbath drivers. Two of his own patients, members of the zoning commission, voted tonight against his proposal, against his dream.</p>
        <p>''You sit there and wonder what you're going to hear next,'' David said later, recalling his emotions. ''You hear lies and you hear bigotry.''</p>
        <p>Si Wachsberger strained his 5-foot-6 frame to take in the tumult as the police and a rabbi tried to dislodge the heckler. A vigorous 79-year-old retired from running a clothing store, he spent nearly half of his life serving on either Beachwood's school board, recreation board or City Council, and he had more recently put his energy and contacts into assembling opposition to the Orthodox campus. He cast the issue as one of preserving Beachwood's residential character, but the religious aspects were undeniable, and they galled Si. He had won a Jewish community service award, served as executive director of his Reform temple for a decade, taught in its religious school for eight years. Who was anybody to tell him he wasn't Jewish enough? Or that he was some kind of Nazi? Yet the Orthodox rabbi had said exactly that tonight, telling a reporter from The Plain Dealer, ''We were treated today like the Nazis of Germany treated us.'' Personally, Si had enlisted to fight the Axis.</p>
        <p>''If you want to move in, move in,'' Si said in the meeting's aftermath. ''But when you bring all the baggage with you -- two synagogues, the mikvah, the school, the whole shtick -- you're taking over.''</p>
        <p>Toward 10 o'clock, Si Wachsberger and David Gottesman reached their homes. They shared at least one thing this clamorous evening in March 1997: the realization that the unanimous vote had not ended the controversy but simply raised its temperature. Indeed, the last few years have brought lawsuits, lawn signs, more petitions, more raucous meetings, even a municipal plebiscite. And today, the controversy, still unresolved, may be headed to the Ohio Supreme Court. The land-use dispute has resisted settlement by all means because the issue has never been about land use at all. Agenda item 96-63, the Orthodox campus, was about the collision of two irreconcilable versions of American Jewish identity, as personified by Si Wachsberger and David Gottesman, and about a kind of social transformation that might be called the Jewish tipping point.</p>
        <p>American Jews, at least American Jews of a certain age, know well the concept of a tipping point, that moment when a neighborhood or school district or town abruptly, wrenchingly, unalterably changes character. As city dwellers, they experienced the lightning transformation of Brooklyn's Brownsville, Chicago's South Shore and scores of similar white working-class havens; once blacks began to arrive in a neighborhood, unscrupulous real estate agents exploited their presence to frighten whites into panic-selling, creating the instability and plummeting property values that turned integration into ghettoization. Today the tipping is occurring within American Jewry, pitting a confident and increasingly affluent Orthodox population against the ethnic, cultural kind of Jews who, for most of the past century, set the example of Jewish identity in the United States.</p>
        <p>From the Pico-Robertson district in Los Angeles to the Five Towns on Long Island, from Brookline outside Boston to West Rogers Park in Chicago, Orthodox Jews have come to define, even to dominate, what were once the redoubts of their less-observant brethren. The shift that swept through Midwood and Flatbush in Brooklyn more than a decade ago now has reached the very heartland of the secular Jewish intelligentsia, Manhattan's Upper West Side, where the sidewalks of Broadway and 86th Street teem with Sabbath shulgoers and the faithful dance down West End Avenue to celebrate Simchat Torah. Teaneck, N. J., has been nicknamed Dati-neck, by some of its growing number of observant residents, dati being the Hebrew word used by Israelis to describe their Orthodox citizens. For that matter, Israel itself may offer the ultimate example of a tipping point, one played out on a national canvas, with Tel Aviv the citadel of secularism and Jerusalem the crown of the theocracy.</p>
        <p>The Jewish tipping point rarely leads to the financial trauma of the racial version, in which families lost their life's savings by desperately unloading their homes. A non-Orthodox Jewish homeowner in a suburb like New Rochelle will most likely pocket a respectable profit selling to an Orthodox lawyer or doctor. The Orthodox settle in clusters not as an act of conquest but as a result of religious imperative, since they must be able to walk to a synagogue on Sabbath. Less-observant Jews don't flee tipping communities en masse as much as they slowly drift away and stop moving into them.</p>
        <p>But as a struggle over turf and the legitimacy turf conveys, the phenomenon cannot help turning bitter. Religious day schools have boomed as public schools have lost Jewish students. The sort of ''kosher style'' deli that stayed open on Saturday and offered ice cream and pastrami on the same menu has been supplanted by restaurants that not only observe the Sabbath and eschew dairy products but also hew to the stringent rules of glatt kosher, a standard that originated among the Hasidim. Most often, the struggle between Orthodox and non-Orthodox Jews has taken the form of battles literally over land -- site-plan approvals for Orthodox synagogues or schools, for instance, or municipal sanction for wires to be strung around the perimeter of an Orthodox area to create an eruv, a zone in which observant Jews are freed from the usual Sabbath prohibition on carrying items (whether a Bible or a baby).</p>
        <p>Nowhere more than in Beachwood, Ohio, have communal strife and civic life become so thoroughly conflated. And because the welter of litigation, electioneering and bureaucratic process has dragged on so long and inconclusively, the pace of upheaval in Beachwood has slowed just enough to be observed as it unfolds, even in the lives of two men as likable, as firmly Jewish and as diametrically opposed as Si Wachsberger and David Gottesman.</p>
        <p>One Saturday afternoon in the spring of 1996, Si Wachsberger was tending his front yard. He grew forsythia and myrtle, and had planted a dogwood for each of his three grandchildren. He was near them, taking clippers to the shrubbery, when two men and a woman strolled up the sidewalk. He could tell by the dark suits, fedoras and long-sleeved dress that they were Orthodox, returning home from synagogue.</p>
        <p>''On Shabbos you have to work?'' the woman asked Si.</p>
        <p>''You come down during the week and do this work for me,'' Si shot back, ''and I won't have to on Saturday.''</p>
        <p>The moment passed and the woman moved on, but the indignation lingered in Si, the sense that his town was being swiped from under his feet. The assistant rabbi at Si's Reform temple had been through a similar experience, accused of desecrating the Sabbath as he drove through an Orthodox section of Beachwood on a Friday night. Si had no gripes about Orthodox Jews in general. He could still rhapsodize about the Sabbath dinners of his boyhood with his grandmother Gittel, who advised him, ''Be a rabbi.'' In deference to his fiancee Shirley's family and his own grandparents, he was married in an Orthodox ceremony. On the walls of his home hang a line drawing of a Hasidic man at prayer and a lithograph of an Old World rabbi.</p>
        <p>In Si's own life, though, nostalgia was no match for the pluralist promise of America. One of relatively few Jews in his hometown of East Cleveland, in his high school, in college (Miami of Ohio), in his Army unit during the war, he had found only acceptance, whether from the Italian-American classmate whose mother stuffed Si with pasta or the Arkansas-bred fellow soldier with whom he hitched rides on leave. Si was the cheerleader, the organizer, the bundle of pep his Miami friends dubbed the Little Corporal. ''I knew I was different,'' he recalled years later of being a Jew among gentiles, ''but I never felt a finger pointing at me.''</p>
        <p>So as a young husband and father in the early 1950's, part of the postwar migration into suburbia, Si chose to buy his first home in Beachwood partly because, unlike nearby Cleveland Heights, it was ethnically and religiously mixed; if there was any majority, it was Christian. ''I didn't want to move into a totally Jewish neighborhood,'' he said years later. ''I didn't want my kids to think that all of life was like that. I wanted them to go out into the world and mix with people of all cultures.''</p>
        <p>Si's first encounter with overt anti-Semitism challenged that goal. Cleveland's venerable, influential Reform congregation, Anshe Chesed, bought land in Beachwood in the late 1940's to build a temple large enough for its 1,800 member families, of whom just 20 then lived in the suburb. Beachwood officials, none of them Jewish, rejected the required rezoning in 1952 as ''detrimental to the public safety, welfare and convenience of the village.'' And, not so coincidentally, white-supremacist literature began circulating through town declaring that the ''battle is on'' against the ''Jew plan.'' Bothered but not frightened, Si told friends, ''Not in America.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, a state court approved the temple construction in a scathing decision. The bigots were right in one respect, though, because Jews emboldened by the ruling flocked to Beachwood, enlarging the public school system as the vehicle for upward mobility and supporting three Reform temples that propounded a liberal brand of politics and theology. Fairmount Temple, as Anshe Chesed renamed itself, swelled to 5,400 members, yet fewer than 400 attended Sabbath services. A basket of yarmulkes sat atop a small lobby table bearing the sign ''Optional.'' For postwar Beachwood, Saturday meant sandlot football, matinees at the local movie theater and, for Si, the occasional dinner at a Chinese restaurant. Fairmount Temple's rabbi, Arthur Lelyveld (whose son would become executive editor of The Times), earned national renown, as well as Si Wachsberger's awe, for braving a beating in Mississippi as a civil rights advocate. He was standing up for the polyglot ideal -- and a Jewish passion for social justice -- that Si himself so cherished.</p>
        <p>The Orthodox who began moving into Beachwood in the 1980's, though, struck Si as a threat to that model. In 1982, a congregation of Lubavitcher Hasidim bought a private home along Beachwood's western border for $270,000 and transformed it into a religious community center (known as a Chabad house, in Lubavitcher parlance) replete with worship services, ritual bath and summer day camp. In three transactions from 1986 to 1992, an Orthodox real estate developer named Ivan Soclof purchased two adjacent houses and a parcel of undeveloped property for a total of $600,000. On what was officially residential land, and the site of several homes, there was now a Young Israel congregation with 125 members, among them David Gottesman. And in late 1996, a coalition of Orthodox groups, ranging from Hasidic to Modern Orthodox, collectively applied to the Beachwood Planning and Zoning Commission for approval to demolish the existing houses and erect a campus composed of a $2.5 million synagogue for Young Israel, a $2 million Chabad center including a mikvah, a Hebrew high school for 250 girls, a separate ritual-bath building and playgrounds and parking lots.</p>
        <p>As a city councilman, Si fumed at the stealthy way the Orthodox bought property and their cavalier manner of flouting zoning rules. More so, he feared Beachwood was going the way of Cleveland Heights. Over the last generation, Orthodox Jews had moved in and non-Orthodox Jews had moved out, and to Si's mind the exodus was a matter of causality rather than coincidence. So many Orthodox stores operated along the Heights' Taylor Road that other Jews ridiculed it as ''Rue de la Peyes.'' (Peyes are a Hasidic male's forelocks.) The Orthodox gladly bought homes in the racially mixed suburb, but for religious reasons they sent their children to parochial schools. Partly as a result, the Cleveland Heights public schools, once bellwethers for Jewish students, began their tips. Growing less affluent and heavily nonwhite by the mid-1990's, its high school, once renowned, was finding that fewer than half of freshmen could pass state proficiency tests.</p>
        <p>As the proposed Orthodox campus started its twisty journey through Beachwood's layers of government, Si couched his public criticism in benign terms. ''You sit down at dinner and they give you a piece of strawberry shortcake,'' he put it. ''And it tastes very good. Then you get another. And another. And all of a sudden, there's 10 pieces of strawberry shortcake in front of you, and it's overkill.'' Privately, he preferred a blunter analysis: ''When the Orthodox began moving onto Taylor Road, the non-Orthodox felt they were being pushed out.''</p>
        <p>He translated those feelings into action in the spring of 1997, two months after the zoning meeting, when the Beachwood City Council took up the campus project. After the zoning vote against the plan, the Cleveland area's Jewish establishment and rabbinate had pressed hard for reversal for the sake of communal unity. Six of the seven Beachwood council members took the advice. Si alone dissented. Where was all the talk of unity, he wondered, when none of the ritual baths in the area let Reform and Conservative rabbis use them for conversion ceremonies? When only one Orthodox rabbi had set foot in Fairmount Temple for Rabbi Lelyveld's funeral the year before? When a national association of ultra-Orthodox rabbis, the Agudath Harabonim, recently had declared the Reform and Conservative branches were ''not Judaism at all''? Si not only voted no, he also urged a fight against the campus ''to preserve our beautiful Beachwood community.''</p>
        <p>One evening several weeks after the council vote in favor of the campus, David Gottesman was watching his son Joshua play softball in Beachwood's summer league when a woman approached him with a petition. She explained that she represented a group called the Committee to Preserve Residential Zoning, and she was collecting signatures to put a referendum about the Orthodox campus on the ballot in November 1997 and try to overturn the council's approval. David happened to be wearing a baseball cap instead of a kippa, so she didn't recognize him as an enemy. He decided to play along and ask why he should sign.</p>
        <p>''I used to live in Cleveland Heights,'' the woman answered. ''The Orthodox ruined the school system there. It went down the toilet. It'll happen here now.''</p>
        <p>After 17 years in Beachwood, David suddenly felt alien, suspect. Until this night, he had known the ball field as the epitome of neighborliness and mutual respect. ''You saw kids playing, their tzitzis falling out, no one cared,'' he said. ''One parent had to bring a snack every week, and they'd always bring something kosher, because they were sensitive.'' And David, for his part, wanted to be sensitive, too. If he saw Orthodox mothers pushing their strollers in the street on Sabbath, he'd shout at them to get on the sidewalk, lest a driver think the women meant to spite him. In such intimate ways, David believed he was helping to achieve achdut, oneness, among Jews. ''I always felt the internal pressure to be the model Orthodox,'' he said. ''The one with the highest level of ethics. The one no one could point a finger at.''</p>
        <p>That desire to be a paragon, to mend something broken in the Jewish world, went back to the number tattooed on the arm of his mother, Erna. As the child of a Holocaust survivor, David had always acted with preternatural obedience, as if any boyish prank, any teenage excess, would inflict needless pain on a life already burdened with too much. So he graduated at the top of his high school class in Fairfield, Conn., and he escorted families to the local Orthodox synagogue on Saturday; he obeyed the parental command of sha shtil, a term that loosely translated means ''don't make waves,'' especially as a Jew forever vulnerable in a gentile country, even America.</p>
        <p>Only when David plunged into the Modern Orthodox environment -- as a teenager attending Camp Morasha, as a premed major at Yeshiva University -- did he finally feel embraced. After years of sticking out as a public school student who lugged a kosher bag lunch to school and missed every Saturday afternoon football game, he now moved effortlessly in a subculture with a kosher automat and Orthodox folk singers called the Rabbis' Sons. The homogeneity, far from limiting David, liberated him. ''I could be who I wanted to be,'' he said later. ''I was free.''</p>
        <p>With his medical school degree and a growing family, David moved to the Cleveland area in 1978 to take a fellowship in gastroenterology. When he decided two years later to establish a private practice in the area, he bought in Beachwood, joining only about a dozen Orthodox families in town. Over the next several years, though, others arrived, settling on the western edge, a long though not impossible walk to synagogues in Cleveland Heights. David found friends like himself, Modern Orthodox professionals in their 30's -- a professor of math, a rheumatologist and two lawyers. They shared Sabbath dinner on Fridays, worshiped together on Saturdays and by 1989 helped form a Young Israel congregation that met in one of the houses Ivan Soclof had bought.</p>
        <p>Given his druthers, David never would have proposed the Orthodox campus as a joint project. Differences over theology and Zionism divided Young Israel from the Lubavitchers from the non-Hasidic ultra-Orthodox; still, David never imagined a town as Jewish as Beachwood would object, much less that its longtime residents would navely lump all the Orthodox together and view the campus as some kind of invasion. He had pulled his own children out of a right-wing Orthodox day school in favor of a Modern Orthodox competitor. But Beachwood's mayor insisted that the varied Orthodox groups submit one plan rather than several separate proposals, and encouraged them to hire a city planner as a consultant to ease the path toward approval. At the least, David believed, Beachwood would accept the campus in the interest of communal unity.</p>
        <p>Now, instead of watching Joshua's softball game, David watched the crowd to see who signed the petition -- who opposed the campus; who, at some level, hated him. One neighbor had publicly claimed the Orthodox wanted to turn Beachwood into ''another Crown Heights.'' A letter to The Cleveland Jewish News, a local weekly, described the zoning issue as a ''holy war by Orthodox Jews.'' David could hardly imagine Jews daring to oppose a Baptist church or a Catholic school with such vitriol. How could they block the Orthodox campus the way gentile bigots had tried decades earlier to block Anshe Chesed? But fear-mongering did work. By late July, the campus referendum was on the November ballot.</p>
        <p>David set about donating and raising money to win. Ultimately the campus proponents spent $40,000, more than 20 times their opponents, on polling, direct-mail solicitations, glossy ads, lawn signs and consultants. Even as the local rabbinate urged approval of the campus, polling showed the electorate opposed by a narrow margin, as if the appeals to Jewish unity had not won over the opposition as much as muzzled it.</p>
        <p>Amid the electioneering, this spectacle of Jew against Jew, David thought often of a photograph a cousin had shown him in a book about Auschwitz. It depicted a group of Jews being herded from cattle cars to the camp gate. One of them, a teenage girl with her face turned toward the camera, was unmistakably Erna Gottesman. It didn't matter to the Nazis whether she was Orthodox or Reform, a Marxist or a cosmopolitan. She was a Jew. ''Beachwood,'' David said, lingering over the word. ''Hitler would've burned us all.''</p>
        <p>By 6 A.M. on Election Day, half an hour before polls opened, Si Wachsberger was working the perimeter of Hilltop Elementary School, wearing a ''Vote No'' button on his coat and gazing at the Orthodox canvassers down the sidewalk. Since the weekend, he had been campaigning 12 hours a day, ringing doorbells, passing out literature, talking himself hoarse. He had raised $800 to pay for an ad in The Cleveland Jewish News that showed the beginnings of a tip in Beachwood -- enrollment in public kindergarten dropping 20 percent in the past year even as parochial school attendance rose. There was a visible class element to the flux, too, as Orthodox families crammed mansions worth $500,000 or more onto one-acre lots in a suburb of modest colonials and ranches.</p>
        <p>''You didn't want Beachwood to be a ghetto,'' Si said. ''I hate to use the word 'ghetto' because it has so many bad connotations. People were forced to live in the ghetto; they had no choice. I feel pity for anyone who wants to live in one now.''</p>
        <p>Election Day progressed in suitably ugly fashion. The police were called to the polling place at Fairmount School to remove signs the Orthodox had put up in a no-electioneering area. Across town, an anticampus poll watcher tore down pro-campus signs and locked them in the trunk of her car. Si's wife, Shirley, a nursing-home volunteer who sometimes helped infirm residents cast their ballots, had just gotten an anonymous letter warning ''she will be watched this Election Day'' because ''it is a felony to tamper with another person's vote and/or to cast a vote for another person.''</p>
        <p>As the hours passed, Si migrated among all five polling places, checking the turnout, hoping for the large one. But at every poll, the pro-campus forces had 8, 10, a dozen campaigners, replacing them in shifts throughout the day. As balloting ended at 7 p.m., the turnout remained below 70 percent, which Si reckoned as the threshold for victory. By midnight, though, the tally showed the campus had been defeated 2,680 to 2,397. Whatever satisfaction Si enjoyed was tempered by the latest hate mail. ''Once one has sinned,'' it concluded, ''there is no peace.''</p>
        <p>And indeed there was not. On Jan. 6, 1998, with Si retired from the Beachwood City Council, it voted 4-3 to allow Young Israel and Chabad each to build a synagogue while simultaneously enacting a newer, even more stringent zoning ordinance. The compromise lasted two minutes before Mayor Merle Gorden vetoed it, saying he was honoring the results of the referendum.</p>
        <p>Si refused to join any celebration. The referendum campaign had convinced him that the Orthodox had pockets deep enough to spend their opponents into oblivion. Besides, he could see Beachwood changing already. Every young mother in a shaytl, every glatt butcher store or restaurant prophesied that in a few years, or a dozen, the Orthodox would have sufficient votes to pass whatever they wanted.</p>
        <p>One Sabbath in January 1998, shortly after Beachwood's mayor had vetoed the Young Israel and Chabad approvals, David Gottesman went to synagogue. In the course of a Torah commentary, his rabbi suddenly and abjectly asked, ''What is it about us, as Orthodox Jews and as Young Israel of Beachwood, that has engendered this kind of enmity?''</p>
        <p>David had been wrestling with the same metaphysical question. When he first took the presidency of Young Israel back in 1996, he expected to worship in a new sanctuary within the year. Now every time he drove past the congregation's house, it stood as reproachful as the broken walls of Jerusalem. The futility was not for lack of trying. The campus controversy had consumed David's entire life. He had not attended a professional conference in two years. During the momentary breaks in his 11-hour workdays, he fielded calls from lawyers and politicians. He spent half of a family trip to Florida on the phone with Beachwood and once was tracked down by Young Israel's attorney while accompanying his son to New York for a day school basketball tournament. ''You can't relax if you don't know what's going on,'' David put it, ''and you can't relax if you do.''</p>
        <p>Over the 18 turbulent months that followed, Young Israel, Chabad and the Hebrew Academy all resubmitted separate, downscaled plans to the Beachwood Board of Zoning Appeals, the city's final arbiter in land-use cases. Each project was approved, and each was instantly challenged in court by local homeowners. In the first suit to be decided, a Cuyahoga County judge struck down the zoning approval for Young Israel, ruling that the Beachwood board's decision was an ''unconscionable'' maneuver ''to circumvent the zoning laws and referendum.''</p>
        <p>Young Israel, of course, appealed the decision, and David tried to tell himself all the litigation was just a stalling tactic, a postponement of the inevitable. He watched as Orthodox families moved into Beachwood and joined his congregation -- two lawyers, two doctors, a day school teacher, a day-care-center operator, a professor, all in 1999 alone. Still, every temporal satisfaction was undermined, afflicted, plagued. One night burglars broke into the Young Israel house, stealing $2,000 worth of appliances and recording equipment. The fire department, meanwhile, cited the house for code violations that would cost $50,000 to correct. Then, during the service on Tishah b'Av, neighbors called the police to gripe about the cars parked on the Young Israel lawn. The congregation's rabbi, Yaakov Feitman, left to take a position on Long Island. Alluding to Jewish disunity at the time the Second Temple was destroyed, he blamed sinat hinam, ''the baseless hatred that was directed at us, not me personally, but at Orthodox Jews in our community,'' for his departure.</p>
        <p>David concluded his term as president of Young Israel just after the High Holy Days of 1999. The synagogue he had dreamed about, the synagogue for which he had raised money and recruited members, remained just blueprints and court documents. The bitterness it had sown, meanwhile, went on undiminished. On the Jewish holiday Sukkot, a number of non-Orthodox Jews complained to city officials that their observant neighbors were breaking the law by putting the outdoor booths called sukkahs in driveways instead of backyards.</p>
        <p>''I've asked myself, 'How can God allow this to happen?' ''David said. ''Why have we had to struggle like this? What are we to have learned? There's got to be a reason. Beachwood is a microcosm of what's happening within Jewry. Nobody's getting along. And God's angry with us about it.''</p>
        <p>Three months ago, the Ohio Court Of Appeals swept aside the morass of municipal and lower-court rulings to permit Young Israel to expand on the contested land. ''We are just happy to be done with it,'' David told The Cleveland Jewish News. In one regard, he was wrong. An attorney for the homeowner who brought the initial suit promised to appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court. In another way, though, both David Gottesman and Si Wachsberger recognized that the future of Beachwood was already being decided outside of court.</p>
        <p>Twenty years after David had moved into a tiny Orthodox enclave in Beachwood, some 300 Orthodox families lived in the suburb, making up perhaps one-sixth of its population of 12,000. A new Orthodox neighborhood was forming almost in the shadow of Fairmount Temple, using a nearby Hebrew school for its synagogue. The local day schools had waiting lists of students; enrollment at Fuchs Mizrachi School, which three of David's children attended, had jumped 400 percent in a decade.</p>
        <p>Some of Beachwood's non-Orthodox residents were aging and simply selling their homes in favor of apartments or condos. Others, though, were consciously fleeing, or so it appeared to Si. One friend told Si about the Orthodox man who showed up, unannounced, to offer to buy his home in cash. A nearby Reform temple announced it was considering moving to Solon, a suburb farther east.</p>
        <p>Amid the tip, Si clung to his place, as if grasping the deck of a capsizing ship. There was something valiant and futile in his persistence. He was fighting a battle on behalf of ethnic Jewishness that most ethnic Jews couldn't be bothered to fight, preferring instead to abdicate the definition of identity to their religious brethren and complain from the bleachers about having lost. And he was, more broadly, fighting for a melting-pot vision of America that had long since been supplanted by the ideal of cultural pluralism. For all his vigor and pluck, he knew as much. One afternoon he drove past the first home he and Shirley owned in Beachwood, a colonial. On the street where they reared their four boys, he spotted two signs that no longer surprised him, but still filled him with sorrow: FOR SALE.</p>
