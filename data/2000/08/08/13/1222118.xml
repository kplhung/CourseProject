        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As a follow-up to the Streetscapes article ''The 400 Block of East 91st Street; A West Side Food Name Shapes an East Side Block'' [July 30], I have some first-hand historical information about 407 East 91st Street.</p>
        <p>For 32 years (from 1920 to 1952), my father, Nathan Turkel, owned and operated the New York Wet Wash Laundry (later the New York Laundry) in that five-story industrial building. The laundry, established in 1911, provided private laundry and dry cleaning service to families in Manhattan and in the Bronx, as well as wholesale laundry service to rooming houses, restaurants and small hotels.</p>
        <p>The laundry occupied two floors, with the remaining three floors leased to industrial tenants. The power plant had two generators that provided electricity for the laundry and tenant use. The waste steam from the generators was used to preheat boiler feed water in an early energy-conservation installation.</p>
        <p>As late as 1949, the so-called ''home routes'' (close to East 91st Street) were serviced by horse and wagon. When I sometimes worked as vacation relief for the regular routemen, I discovered that the horses knew the customers' addresses and invariably stopped in front of the next building for a pickup of dirty laundry.</p>
        <p>Incidentally, in 1948 the price for 25 pounds of wet wash was $1.60, picked up soiled at 6 a.m. and delivered clean and extracted later the same day.</p>
