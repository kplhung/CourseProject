        <p>THE SETTING -- Last week, hundreds of twentysomethings jammed a Chelsea bar, fueling up on $3 bottles of Budweiser, slapping backs and swapping Web site war stories.</p>
        <p>It was a scene any of these Internet kids could have envisioned last year, hanging out toasting their soaring stock options.</p>
        <p>But now that many Internet companies have gone from start-up to belly up, losing their financing and firing employees, the drinks tend to be tonics to soothe broken dot-com dreams.</p>
        <p>In fact, the Chelsea gathering was one of the weekly ''pink-slip parties'' held Wednesday nights at Rebar, at 16th Street and Eighth Avenue, for victims of dot-com downsizing.</p>
        <p>THE BUZZ -- There were very few tears in the beer, actually. The mood was like that of a crew that narrowly escaped going down with the ship.</p>
        <p>Since these parties started last month, word has spread through e-mail invitations from Allison Hemming, president of Thehired guns.com, a consulting firm for Internet and technology companies. She bills the happy hour as a ''safe haven for dot-com-miserating.''</p>
        <p>At last week's party, Jodie Kahn talked like an old hand. She was fired from Grit.net, a Web radio site, in 1998, ''back before it was hip to be downsized,'' she said.</p>
        <p>''There's really no stigma anymore to being fired from a dot-com,'' said Ms. Kahn, who said working for a doomed start-up goes like this: ''When you're hired, they tell you, 'This is gonna be so great.' Then when the financing's gone, it's, 'Sorry, we can't afford you anymore.' ''</p>
        <p>That's how Carol Huang, one of 140 workers laid off last June by APBnews.com, said it was for her.  Back from a monthlong vacation in the Middle East, she is looking for work as a freelance writer ''until I figure out what I'm supposed to do with myself.''</p>
        <p>Her friend Judy Dutton said she came to the party ''to feel superior'' since she had a secure job as a senior editor at Cosmopolitan magazine.</p>
        <p>''It's such an ego boost to be among so many recently unemployed people,'' she said, laughing.</p>
        <p>Of course, the events are a bountiful harvest for recruiters. One of them, Bonnie Halper of Sendresume .com, chatted up several Internet casualties, but said she would find no ''techies'' -- computer programmers and code writers -- this evening.</p>
        <p>''You know where they hang out?'' she said. ''Strip clubs. You think I'm kidding, but I'm not. When I go there to recruit them, I have to bring my husband, and he'll only go if I get a lap dance.''</p>
        <p>Susana Saja was at her third straight party. Ms. Saja, 27, recently lost her job at Orientation.com, a portal site. ''They never got their third round of financing, and they fired 50 employees in one day,'' she said. ''It was so impersonal.''</p>
