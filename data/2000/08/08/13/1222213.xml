        <p>The Suffolk Legislature voted last week to give the developers $1.8 million if they agreed to add affordable family housing to a much-debated plan for the former Long Island Developmental Center in Huntington.</p>
        <p>But the developers, SBJ Associates of Garden City, will refuse the money, according to their lawyer, John A. Harras, and want to go forward with a development designed largely for older residents.</p>
        <p>SBJ paid the state $16.1 million for the 380-acre parcel in October. They are asking Huntington for a zoning change to allow an 18-hole golf course and 1,375 condominium and detached and semi-detached units primarily for people 55 and older.</p>
        <p>The Suffolk legislation would award the $1.8 million if SBJ built 30 percent of the units to sell to families for $50,000 to $130,000. The developers could use the money for roads, curb cuts or other costs.</p>
        <p>The presiding officer of the legislature, Paul J. Tonna, a Republican from Huntington and a sponsor, said the bill was ''a carrot without a stick'' to ensure that the development benefited working families and young people who have been priced out of the housing market.</p>
        <p>''There's nothing wrong with housing for seniors,'' he said, ''but we really have to do something here for affordable housing for everyone.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Harras said the proposed alteration could disqualify the project as a ''senior community'' under the Federal Fair Housing Act, wiping out subsidies that would hold down the cost of units for older residents.</p>
        <p>Under the developers' plan, prices would range from $125,000 for some subsidized condominium units to $500,000 and up for detached houses. The project includes some rental units.</p>
