        <p>The huge crowd that flocked to the Buick Open today had plenty to watch, and not just Tiger Woods.</p>
        <p>Chris Perry, shooting a third-round 65, snatched the lead boldly, like a house guest taking the biggest steak at a summer barbecue. Phil Mickelson, who also shot a 65, and Woods, who shot a 67, birdied themselves into contention. Woody Austin, who started the day with a two-stroke lead, struggled to a 73 and was overtaken. Meanwhile, proven winners like Hal Sutton, Vijay Singh and Paul Azinger remained within an eyelash of the lead, ready to strike.</p>
        <p>Sunday's final round at Warwick Hills Golf and Country Club should be an exciting prelude to next week's P.G.A. Championship. Perry ended today at 15-under-par 201, one stroke ahead of Rocco Mediate, who had a two-under-par 70.</p>
        <p>The list of players with a realistic chance to win was at least 15 deep. Sutton and Austin were tied for third at 13 under par; Azinger and Joe Ozaki were 12 under; Singh, Brad Faxon, Dudley Hart, Skip Kendall and Mickelson were 11 under; and Paul Goydos and Jeff Maggert were 10 under. Woods was tied at nine under par with four players -- Fred Couples, Jeff Sluman, Robin Freeman and Kenny Perry.</p>
        <p>''If you shoot a 72 tomorrow, you're not going to win the tournament,'' said Perry, who won the 1998 B.C. Open, his only career victory on the PGA Tour. ''There are a lot of high-profile players on the leader board, so somebody is going to shoot a low number.'' No matter what happens, fans will come, because Woods will be there. While the tournament does not keep an official attendance count, today's crowd was estimated at 50,000, by far the largest ever at the Buick Open. Many came to see the marquee twosome, Woods and Mickelson, with fans packed shoulder to shoulder outside the gallery ropes, craning their necks to get a glimpse of the action.</p>
        <p>Other players felt somewhat ignored, including Austin and Mediate, who played in the final twosome and teed off almost two and a half hours after Woods. By the time Austin and Mediate played their final three holes, many fans had left because Mickelson and Woods were finished.</p>
        <p>''It was the weirdest final group I've every played in,'' Mediate said. ''Tiger took all the fans with him. It was eerie. We got to the 17th hole, and there was hardly anybody there.''</p>
        <p>But earlier in the day, the atmosphere was like a state fair. With cheers and yelling echoing through the trees, the electricity surrounding the Woods-Mickelson pairing resembled a major championship, and both players rose to the occasion. Mickelson birdied the first four holes and put himself in position to win for the fourth time this year. While some players are rattled playing with Woods, Mickelson fed off the energy.</p>
        <p>''I really enjoy playing with Tiger,'' said Mickelson, who stopped Woods's six-tournament winning streak in February by winning the Buick Invitational. ''What he goes through every day, I can take in small doses. I don't know how he does it. It's so loud and there is so much hoopla, I can't even hear. It was just all a blur. On the first hole, it took me five minutes after hitting into the trees to get people out of the way so they were not in danger to hit another shot. You basically need to keep it in play when you play with him.''</p>
        <p>But Mickelson kept his head, and he forced Woods to keep up. Woods did not make his first birdie until the fifth hole, but then he proceeded to birdie Nos. 7, 9, 10, 13 and 14 to reach 10 under par. Woods made a double-bogey at the par-4 No. 15, however, hitting a tee shot into the trees, his second shot into the front bunker, a bad bunker shot 15 feet past the cup and a chip 4 feet past the hole, followed by a missed putt.</p>
        <p>If Woods does not win, he will lament that hole as a turning point. But the big picture for Woods this week is to prepare for the P.G.A. Championship. Based on his ball-striking and performance today, he appeared headed in the right direction. ''I felt if I could make a few birdies, I could feed off of Phil,'' Woods said. ''If not, I was going to get left high and dry. I finally made a few, but I could have made a few more.'' Asked about the crowd -- some fans chanted Woods's name between shots and others chanted Mickelson's name, not to mention other comments -- Woods smiled.</p>
        <p>''Pretty interesting, huh?'' said Woods, whose announcement that he would be playing more than doubled ticket sales. ''They're the biggest crowds I've ever seen here. And when the noise gets between the trees, it starts to echo.''</p>
        <p>Woods will be paired with Goydos on Sunday, while Perry and Mediate will be in the final group.</p>
