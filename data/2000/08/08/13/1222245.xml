        <p>The buses, which already run crosstown on 79th and 86th Streets, have two parts, connected with an accordionlike midsection that bends to turn. At 60 feet from fender to bumper, they are 20 feet longer than standard models, and longer than some subway cars.</p>

        <p>Early next month, New York City Transit officials plan to deploy a fleet of articulated buses on the 23rd Street crosstown line, and riders are rattling in their seats.</p>
        <p>The buses, which already run crosstown on 79th and 86th Streets, have two parts, connected with an accordionlike midsection that bends to turn. At 60 feet from fender to bumper, they are 20 feet longer than standard models, and longer than some subway cars.</p>
        <p>They have 62 seats and standing room for 77, compared with 40 seats and space for 30 passengers in standard buses. Because the articulated models are so big, the transit authority plans to run three for every four of the standard buses that run during rush hour.</p>
        <p>''We run the articulated buses where we have the densest ridership,'' said Robert Slovak, a spokesman for the transit agency. ''This is one of our busiest routes in Manhattan.''</p>
        <p>But riders say the buses will cause gridlock, particularly when they zigzag around a new traffic triangle at 11th Avenue to pick up riders at Chelsea Piers.</p>
        <p>''We took a test ride and it took us 17 minutes to get from the Chelsea Piers to 10th Avenue,'' said Maria Garcia, a freelance writer who rides the line, the M23, regularly, and who took the ride with transit officials and community board members. ''That's only two blocks.''</p>
        <p>State Senator Thomas K. Duane also criticized the decision to run fewer buses in rush hours. ''This is a plot to allow for reduction in the frequency of bus service,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Articulated buses, he said, should be used to reduce crowding on existing schedules, rather than reduce the number of buses in service.</p>
        <p>Mr. Slovak said the buses had been used successfully in other cities, including Paris, Rome and Washington, as well as in the Bronx, where they run along the Grand Concourse and other wide boulevards.</p>
        <p>As for concerns about clogged traffic, Mr. Slovak said the new buses made tighter turns than their predecessors.</p>
        <p>''Besides,'' he said, ''traffic jams are nothing new to the city.''</p>
