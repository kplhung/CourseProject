        <p>THE house, a 10,000-square-foot postmodern abode, isn't finished. The sweeping front lawn has yet to be sodded. No matter.

Their 1,500-square-foot personal putting green, after all, has been in place since last fall, just a 9-iron from the tee at the corner of the garage, 100 yards away. Pristine white sand fills its traps, lush bluegrass covers the berms and mounds surrounding the artificial bent-grass putting turf. Who needs a kitchen? With four cup locations to sink a golf ball into, the Schwalbes are busy this summer working on their putts.</p>

        <p>THE house, a 10,000-square-foot postmodern abode, isn't finished. The sweeping front lawn has yet to be sodded. No matter. Fred and Ruth Schwalbe brought their golf clubs to their new Quiogue weekend and summer home months ago. Their 1,500-square-foot personal putting green, after all, has been in place since last fall, just a 9-iron from the tee at the corner of the garage, 100 yards away. Pristine white sand fills its traps, lush bluegrass covers the berms and mounds surrounding the artificial bent-grass putting turf. Who needs a kitchen? With four cup locations to sink a golf ball into, the Schwalbes are busy this summer working on their putts.</p>
        <p>''If you just want to go practice, you don't have to go to the club, to the range,'' said Mrs. Schwalbe. Her husband, a real estate investor and fellow golf novice, likes to practice his sand shots each morning before heading to his tennis club. ''You can basically practice right here.''</p>
        <p>Initially, Mr. Schwalbe, 63, intended to install a tennis court. But his friends, many of whom have forsaken tennis for golf over the past few years, wouldn't commit to an afternoon game of doubles. Besides, the Schwalbes' sons -- Evan, 23, and Jason, 26 -- preferred golf.</p>
        <p>''We just thought this would be great,'' said Mrs. Schwalbe, 50, who tries to play a round of golf nearly every day at the Hampton Hills Golf and Country Club when her back is not out. ''It just made a lot more sense to us than doing the tennis court. We have a boat in the back and the dock and a pool. Having the toys around keeps everyone around the house having fun and having friends over. This got everybody excited. This is prettier.''</p>
        <p>For the past 15 years, Carl Weiss looked out his Westhampton Beach front window onto a drab, flat stretch of yard. It needed landscaping. It needed oomph. But rhododendrons, birches and flowering perennials weren't exactly what Dr. Weiss had in mind. An avid golfer, he envisioned his own tee and golf hole, complete with a sand trap and perhaps even a mound or two. So this summer, Dr. Weiss, 65, a semi-retired orthopedic surgeon with a practice in Garden City, hired John Caputo Jr., a residential putting green builder, to design and install a 1,000-square-foot putting turf.</p>
        <p>''It was a very big vacant area,'' Dr. Weiss said. ''It needed something for aesthetics. This is about as attractive a thing as I could put in and far more functional than trees or bushes. I enjoy golf.''</p>
        <p>With the economy booming and interest in golf soaring, more and more personal putting greens are dotting the Long Island landscape. Tiger Woods wannabes play in their pajamas. Fairway fanatics add lights and play at night. Links lovers sink putts before breakfast.</p>
        <p>''It will be great for after dinner,'' Dr. Weiss said excitedly as the putting green construction neared completion recently. ''There are sand bunkers so it gives you all the practice you need. There's an 80-yard pitch shot.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Weiss plays 18 holes several times a week, both at the Garden City Country Club and Westhampton Country Club. But he can use his own green every day, nearly year round.</p>
        <p>''When they come out here, they want to rest and recreate,'' said Mr. Caputo, 49, owner of Personal Putting Greens. His company has installed about 300 private putting greens, mostly at summer and weekend homes on the East End, in backyards on the North Shore of Long Island and Westchester, and at condominium complexes. ''The difference between what we do and what you see on golf courses is the scale. To golfers, there is nothing prettier than seeing a golfstick in a hole.''</p>
        <p>The greens run from $7,000 to $70,000, from a tiny turf with no sand trap in a small side yard of a home in Quiogue to a 3,200-square-foot green on an 8-acre Mill Neck estate with two big bunkers and tee areas at 75, 100 and 150 yards. For a lavish Water Mill project, Mr. Caputo cleared an acre of woods, creating a long vista of fairway up to the green. Then he dug a large pond for a water hazard, complete with a waterfall coming out of the woods.</p>
        <p>''Half of your strokes on a golf course are usually spent putting on the green,'' said Mr. Caputo, tending to workout barefoot on his own backyard green in Miller Place far more often than he gets to play a round. ''The big shots from the tee you can practice at the driving range. The putting stroke, and reading breaks and contours in the green, where do you practice that? Unless you go to the club or find a green at a golf course, which isn't always convenient, this is the best way to do it.''</p>
        <p>When Mr. Caputo started his residential golf business a decade ago after being laid off from his job as a land surveyor, no market existed for residential putting greens.</p>
        <p>''It's not like we are building swimming pools where everybody knows that there are companies out there building swimming pools and there's a need for them,'' Mr. Caputo said. ''This was something they didn't realize could be done for them.''</p>
        <p>Golf was Mr. Caputo's passion. And he had heard about PGI, an Indiana company that manufactures the artificial bent-grass surface. He putt ed on it and was impressed by how the tight, twisted knitted nylon fiber played like natural grass. He signed a contract for a sole distributorship, began studying golf-course architecture and went on a marketing binge. It took five years to get the company off the ground.</p>
        <p>''I consider these art,'' Mr. Caputo said of his greens. ''When you put something so prominently in a landscape, they have to be attractive to look at. Every one is a little bit different, a little unique.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Caputo used his knowledge garnered doing road improvements and widenings for a consulting engineering company to write the specifications and excavate traps. Two gradations of crushed stone are used to build the porous base that hold the green's subtle contours. The initial shaping, mounds, berms and elevations are done with a sandy loam. Though the putting surface is synthetic, the collar and perimeter areas are natural.</p>
        <p>Business has gotten so brisk lately that Mr. Caputo has divided his territory. While he concentrates on Long Island and Westchester, franchise-like dealerships in Chester, N.J., Wilton, Conn., and Doylestown, Pa., handle the demand there.</p>
        <p>Sometimes the putting green alone isn't sufficient to stave off a golf addiction. Placing mats around the swimming pool to chip shots off of, Robert Reiner, 47, a psychologist from Manhattan, turned the one-acre yard at his Quogue retreat into a small golf course. Hitting over the pool is 40 yards to the stick, a very short par 3. Chip a ball onto Dr. Reiner's green at night and motion detectors make it light up like a pinball machine. ''It certainly gives you an edge when you compete with your friends,'' he said. ''If you think you're a good putter, then you are one. What better way to acquire confidence than through practice and repetition? It makes you a better putter. It's one of those things that if you use it, it will almost definitely lower your score.''</p>
        <p>Four years ago, Stewart and Jill Tain of Lloyd Harbor decided to take up golf. They joined a country club. Two years later, the Tains hired Mr. Caputo to build a green with a sand bunker and four holes at the back of their two-acre property. For longer shots, a tee was installed 35 yards down the lawn.</p>
        <p>''In a way, it feels like we're on the golf course,'' said Mrs. Tain, 53, who practices on the personal green between playing 18 holes four times a week at her club. ''There's a view from the green of our house, which looks like a clubhouse when you look at it. It's relaxing and it's fun.''</p>
        <p>''Our friends get a kick out of it,'' Mrs. Tain said. ''We feel it enhances our backyard. It's just a beautiful thing to see.''</p>
