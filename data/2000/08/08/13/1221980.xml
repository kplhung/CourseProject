        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As an adult fan of the Harry Potter books, I was delighted that your ''Sorting Hat'' selected Stephen King to review J. K. Rowling's latest opus, ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'' (July 23). His commentary was insightful and amusing. (I was relieved that the entrepreneurial King didn't serialize his review, forcing readers to pay for its conclusion through his Web site.) While King is leery of the upcoming movie adaptation, he neglected to mention the outstanding audio books read by the British actor Jim Dale, in which he creates voices for Harry, Hermione, Ron and more than a hundred other characters. If King should ever find himself bedridden again, I suggest he relive Harry's adventures through Dale's inspired performance.</p>
