        <p>Natalie Scott Dyer, a daughter of Natalie and Elisha Dyer of Washington, Conn., was married there yesterday to Nicholas Vance Benson, a son of Shirley and Raymond E. Benson of Weybridge, Vt. The Rev. Cheryl P. Anderson, a minister of the United Church of Christ, officiated at a house belonging to the bride's parents.</p>
        <p>Ms. Dyer, who is 34 and is known as Lili, is keeping her surname. She teaches English as a second language at the Children's Workshop School in Manhattan. She is also a staff developer on curriculum and classroom-development issues for teachers of English as a second language and bilingual teachers in Community School District 1, on the Lower East Side.</p>
        <p>She received bachelor's and master's degrees in French language and literature from Middlebury College, and also received a master's degree in teaching English to speakers of other languages from New York University.</p>
        <p>The bride's father retired as a senior vice president of Hilliard Lyons, a stockbrokerage firm, for which he was a floor broker at the American Stock Exchange in Manhattan. Her mother, also retired, taught remedial reading at the Rumsey Hall School, a private school in Washington, and now operates the Dyer Need Farm there, where she raises sheep.</p>
        <p>Mr. Benson, 34, is an adjunct associate professor of English at the Long Island University campus in Brooklyn and an Italian language translator. He is a graduate of N.Y.U. and received a master's degree in Italian language and literature from Middlebury and a Ph.D. in Italian from N.Y.U. His mother is an independent translator of Russian books and articles. His father, who is retired, was until 1987 the public affairs officer at the United States Embassy in Moscow.</p>
        <p>The couple met 10 years ago when Ms. Dyer responded to a posting for an Italian conversation partner that Mr. Benson had placed in a Cambridge, Mass., bookstore.</p>
