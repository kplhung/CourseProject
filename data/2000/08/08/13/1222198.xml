        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Francesca Harper's interesting article [''To Europe and Back, a Dancer's Odyssey Of Self-Discovery,'' July 30] compells me to share my own experience of Europe. I lived in Germany for 11 years, coming of age there as an artist and as an African-American. I worked as a teacher of dance, and choreographed for my own company as well as for films, fashion, television and, yes, Milli Vanilli. My teaching and choreographic work took me all over Europe.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Francesca Harper's interesting article [''To Europe and Back, a Dancer's Odyssey Of Self-Discovery,'' July 30] compells me to share my own experience of Europe. I lived in Germany for 11 years, coming of age there as an artist and as an African-American. I worked as a teacher of dance, and choreographed for my own company as well as for films, fashion, television and, yes, Milli Vanilli. My teaching and choreographic work took me all over Europe.</p>
        <p>I have learned to speak another language, offering up my voice and my culture through my art, becoming a citizen of the world. Not just the dance world. Leaving a society and culture that rewards you for being yourself and expressing your passions and views through art, and returning to a society that feels it is artistically isolated, overcrowded and fiscally thwarted with thousands of artistic mouths to feed, is most disheartening.</p>
        <p>As a returning artist currently performing on Broadway in ''The Lion King,'' I have found that my experiences are difficult for other American artists and lay people to comprehend. Opportunities to voice your views creatively and succeed here are often hard to come by for the many thousands struggling for the one grant or even gig. They become ''Americentric'' and are thrust into an environment of insular creativity instead of one of expansion.</p>
        <p>I hope that The Times continues to  look at African-American artists living outside the United States in order to illuminate, particularly for young artists, the creative opportunities and experiences that are available to them abroad.</p>
