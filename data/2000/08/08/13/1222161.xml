        <p>WITH its late summer opening by the Kings County Shakespeare Company, ''A Midsommer Nights Dreame'' is intended to rouse spirits and the spirited. The company, now in its 17th year, is using the text of the First Folio, hence the spelling. This production is directed by Liz Shipman, who characterizes it as ''a proper fairy tale'' in which the spirit world shadows the urges, desires and dreams of the human world.</p>
        <p>The cast includes (above, left to right): Cyrus Farmer (Lysander), Sherri Pullum (Hermia), Andrew Stuart (Puck), Andrew Oswald  (Demetrius) and Renee Bucciarelli (Helena). ''Midsommer'' will alternate with ''The Rivals'' by Richard Brinsley Sheridan.</p>
