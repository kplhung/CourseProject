        <p>Forty years ago Alfred Siefker and two teenage buddies, like him interested in paleontology, were digging around a rock quarry off Toennelle Avenue in North Bergen. They uncovered a piece of shale with an imprint of what looked like a giant firefly. It turned out to be a 200-million-year-old fossil of a flying vertebrate that raised a scientific furor because it showed that animals flew far earlier than had been thought. It was named Icoarosaurus Siefkeri, for Mr. Siefker, and put in the American Museum of Natural History in Manhattan. But now Mr. Siefker, 56, is ailing and needs money for medical bills. So the fossil will be offered for sale by Butterfields Auctioneers in a simulcast auction in San Francisco and Los Angeles on Aug. 27. The minimum bid is $250,000. Mr. Siefker hopes the fossil, known as the Icarosaurus Siefkeri, will end up in a museum, said David Herskowitz, director of the natural history department at Butterfields.</p>
