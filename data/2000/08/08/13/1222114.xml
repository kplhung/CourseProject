        <p>PATTY GOBLE of Danbury understands as well as anyone the mixed blessing of understudying a leading role on Broadway. Ms. Goble has been understudying the actress Marin Mazzie since 1996, first as Mother in ''Ragtime'' and then as Lilli Vanessi in ''Kiss Me, Kate,'' currently playing at the Martin Beck Theater on West 45th Street.</p>
        <p>There's the stress of going on under-rehearsed as well as the anxiety of perhaps never playing the starring role. Then there's the rare occasion when the actor knows well in advance that she will fill in, as Ms. Goble did last July and will do again Thursday through next Sunday.</p>
        <p>''I'd known for a week,'' Ms. Goble said as she ate a salad in Ms. Mazzie's dressing room before a performance. ''It feels a lot better than the first time I went on.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Goble was pulled from the chorus to replace Ms. Mazzie soon after ''Kiss Me, Kate'' opened last October. Ms. Goble had barely rehearsed with her fellow understudies and hadn't even been fitted for costumes. Ms. Mazzie's dresser waited offstage to dress Ms. Goble for each new scene and point her in the right direction.</p>
        <p>''It was actually going well considering how unprepared I was,'' Ms. Goble said. ''Then I went up in the middle of 'I Hate Men.' ''</p>
        <p>''Went up'' means she forgot her lines, which, in a song, can literally stop a performance. ''Stop it cold,'' Ms. Goble said. ''There was silence. I said, 'Sorry', which was picked up over my mike. I heard people call out different words from the wings and I finally got it. Not fun.</p>
        <p>''After the show Celeste Holm came backstage,'' she said. ''I apologized for botching the song and she said: 'Oh, it's nothing. I've done worse.' ''</p>
        <p>Before replacing Ms. Mazzie that week in July, Ms. Goble played Lilli 18 times. That is a lot of opportunities considering that she has been a chorus member since moving east from Colorado in the 80's with her husband, Dan Goble, now head of the jazz department at Western Connecticut State University in Danbury. She worked in the Livent company's Toronto production of ''Phantom,'' understudying the ingenue Christine and the villainous Carlotta. After playing Jellyorum and Giddlebone in the national tour of ''Cats,'' Ms. Goble understudied all three women in Andrew Lloyd-Webber's revue ''Music of the Night,'' which ran for nine months in Toronto.</p>
        <p>In understudying Ms. Mazzie in ''Ragtime,'' Ms. Goble made her Broadway debut. She hasn't left since that show opened in January 1998. ''When people ask me what my next project is, I tell them to ask Marin,'' Ms. Goble quipped. ''To be honest, I didn't think I'd understudy again after 'Ragtime.' Then this came around, and I have such respect for Marin. I didn't want to be left out.''</p>
        <p>Understudying is not every actor's cup of tea. When they do fill in for the star, they are expected to follow the lead without adding any personal flourishes to the performance. ''When you go on with short notice, you're just thinking about getting through it,'' Ms. Goble said. ''Now that I've played Lilli a few times, I can make it mine without disrupting the overall performance.</p>
        <p>''Not everybody is cut out for this, but I think I'm good at it. There are lots of excellent baseball players who perform necessary backup roles for their team. I guess I'm the Todd Pratt of 'Kiss Me, Kate,' '' she said, referring to the backup catcher for the Mets superstar Mike Piazza.'</p>
        <p>A few hours later, Ms. Goble performed without any discernible mishap. Playing Lilli as if she owned the role, Ms. Goble earned grand applause for her solos ''So in Love'' and ''I Hate Men.'' She passed the true litmus test by getting a rise in applause at her curtain call.</p>
        <p>Following her performance, Ms. Goble enjoyed her borrowed time in the spotlight. ''I can't say for how long I'll still enjoy understudying,'' she said, ''but I'm comfortable with where I am right now.''</p>
        <p>Patty Goble performs the role of Lilli Vanessi in ''Kiss Me, Kate'' Thursday through next Sunday at the Martin Beck Theater, 302 West 45th Street (212-239-6200).</p>
