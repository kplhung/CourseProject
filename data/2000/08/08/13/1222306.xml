        <p>ALTHOUGH Michael Nadel is just getting started as an investor, he says the mutual fund industry has already lost him as a customer.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nadel, 26, a Washington lawyer, says he grew frustrated a few months ago when he could not determine what was causing the sharp decline in the value of his shares of an Internet stock fund. Because most mutual funds disclose their complete holdings only twice a year and with a significant time lag, he said, ''I don't know what they own or how they make decisions.''</p>
        <p>Thinking that he could generate better returns by calling his own shots, Mr. Nadel shifted a retirement savings account to Folio[fn], an Internet-based start-up that lets investors build their own baskets of stocks and trade them as often as they like, for a monthly fee of $29.95. ''I have no desire to be in a managed fund any more,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nadel is an early convert to a new breed of investment services that are using Web technology to create alternatives to mutual funds and traditional brokerage accounts. Since Folio[fn] introduced basket investing for individual customers in May, a raft of upstarts have appeared, promoting similar products they variously call folios, e-baskets or personal funds. As they race to harness the Internet's power to sell investment advice and flexible, low-cost products, they threaten to siphon off some of the $7 trillion that is now in mutual funds and the trillions more parked in brokerage accounts.</p>
        <p>Each start-up is trying to carve out its own slice of the spectrum between actively managed mutual funds and online brokerage accounts. Some, like Folio[fn] and Unx.com, will let customers choose preselected baskets of stocks or build their own. Others, like NetFolio and Smartleaf, plan to advise investors on how to use baskets of individual stocks to manage their taxes, trading costs and investment risks. Yet another venture, Personal Fund, which is backed by the financial journalist Andrew Tobias, is selling software to brokerage firms and financial planners that would help them manage these baskets.</p>
        <p>All these young companies share an underlying belief that the Internet provides a way for investors to combine the simplicity of mutual funds with the greater control of owning stocks through a brokerage account -- and that they can make money by exploiting that opportunity.</p>
        <p>The companies' executives argue that mutual fund shareholders pay too much in taxes and fees to managers who exert complete control, disclose too little about what they are doing and routinely underperform the overall market. Online brokerage accounts, on the other hand, leave investors to navigate a sea of choices without much guidance, they say.</p>
        <p>''There's a lot of potential in the idea,'' said John Rekenthaler, director of research at Morningstar Inc. ''Diversification with more customization, more ability to control one's tax bill and potentially lower costs -- that's an attractive combination.</p>
        <p>''But it's not for everybody,'' he continued. ''It's a minority audience that's going to want to make their own decisions.''</p>
        <p>That is why start-ups like NetFolio and Smartleaf are emphasizing the value of the advice they offer and are leaving it to others to buy the stocks to place in the baskets. James J. Atkinson, a fund executive, says this sort of unbundling of investment ideas -- from the packages they come wrapped in -- reminds him of the controversy that is roiling the recorded-music industry.</p>
        <p>Mr. Atkinson, who heads the domestic mutual fund operations of Investec Asset Management, says the Internet is opening financial services to an early-stage ''disruptive technology'' like the one that spawned Napster, the service that lets people swap music files over the Internet instead of buying compact discs.</p>
        <p>''If the fund industry is no longer the way to get packaging and convenience, they will lose the ability to control pricing of their intellectual content,'' just like recording companies, he said.</p>
        <p>Industry experts say these personalized funds are more likely to draw money away from mutual funds than from brokerage accounts. But it is the brokerage firms that have begun to respond with plans for baskets of their own. Meanwhile, executives of the two biggest mutual fund companies, Fidelity Investments and the Vanguard Group, say they do not see the new products as much of a threat to their businesses.</p>
        <p>Still, investors have already shown an appetite for new twists on the decades-old format of mutual funds. In the last two years, companies have rolled out dozens of products that look like mutual funds but trade all day like stocks, including several from Merrill Lynch called Holdrs. In the first six months of the year, assets in all of these exchange-traded funds grew almost 50 percent, to $52.6 billion.</p>
        <p>Some of the established financial companies are not waiting to see if personalized funds will catch on. E*Trade, the second-largest Internet brokerage firm in trading volume, recently bought one of the upstarts, the Electronic Investing Corporation of San Francisco. Before year-end, E*Trade plans to offer the ability to create and manage baskets of stocks -- either directly to its customers or through affiliated financial advisers. E*Trade has not said how it will price the products.</p>
        <p>Charles Schwab, the leading online brokerage firm, is developing a similar service and may introduce it as soon as early next year. But as the operator of the largest mutual fund supermarket, Schwab has more at stake than most brokerage firms: about 30 percent of its customers' assets are in mutual funds, which pay service fees to Schwab.</p>
        <p>Daniel Hubbard, a Schwab spokesman, said that fact would not stop Schwab from offering baskets if the company's executives decided to proceed. ''We don't believe these products represent a direct challenge to mutual funds or to our relationships with mutual fund companies,'' Mr. Hubbard said. ''The real issue is whether there is enough investor interest.''</p>
        <p>JAMES P. O'SHAUGHNESSY, a money manager who sold his mutual fund business this year to get into the business of advising investors on setting up their own baskets of stocks, has no qualms about butting heads with the fund industry. Visitors to his NetFolio Web site are greeted with the headline: ''Goodbye mutual funds. Hello NetFolio.''</p>
        <p>Mr. O'Shaughnessy, who has built a following among individual investors who think there are ways to consistently outperform the market, said: ''I've always thought that mutual funds were the investment of choice for the masses. But I think the enabling technologies of the Internet are going to change that.''</p>
        <p>For as little as $200 a year, NetFolio will advise investors on buying one of more than 100 ''e-baskets'' of 5 to 40 stocks to fit their investing goals and appetite for risk. The customers will be able to make changes in the baskets or create their own from scratch. The stocks will be held in brokerage accounts at Bear Stearns, said Mr. O'Shaughnessy, whose desk in NetFolio's temporary  offices in Midtown Manhattan is a folding table. Bear Stearns, which has invested $1 million in Mr. O'Shaughnessy's company, plans to offer NetFolio's service to its wealthy brokerage clients, he said.</p>
        <p>The folio approach has already caught on with some hedge fund managers and investment advisers, said Matthew Ridenour, chief executive of Unx.com, an online brokerage firm based in Burbank, Calif., that specializes in such investing for the institutional market.</p>
        <p>For decades, professional and individual investors alike have sought ways to diversify efficiently by investing in groups of stocks, through actively managed mutual funds, index funds, hedge funds or other packages of securities. Mr. Ridenour predicted that as much as $2 trillion could move from these existing funds into the new breed of basket over the next 18 months.</p>
        <p>Unx.com, which has assets of about $250 million, plans to develop an offering for individual investors. ''My argument,'' Mr. Ridenour said, ''is that no one ever needs a mutual fund again.''</p>
        <p>Steven Wallman, a former member of the Securities and Exchange Commission who founded Folio[fn], is trying to make a competitive issue of the fees, expenses and taxes rung up by mutual fund investors. Mr. Wallman says folios allow investors to better manage their tax bill because they can sell losing positions to offset profits on winners. Mutual fund investors are not able to manage their taxes in that way, because fund managers decide when to distribute gains.</p>
        <p>Investors in the typical mutual fund pay about 1.35 percent of assets annually in management fees -- about $500 on the median investment of $38,000. Many funds also charge sales fees when you buy into, or sell out of the funds, some as high as 5.5 percent. If that fee is paid up front, it reduces the amount that an investor puts into the account -- a significant factor in certain tax-deferred retirement accounts, like I.R.A.'s, in which the fee cuts into annual contribution limit.</p>
        <p>In the short term, paying a flat fee to set up a personalized fund can also cost less than buying the same stocks through a discount broker at $10 to $30 a trade.</p>
        <p>The new investment vehicles have attracted the support -- and participation -- of some big-name financial experts. Steve Ross, a professor of finance at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is an adviser to Smartleaf, a start-up that wants to use the Internet to deliver advice to individual investors on managing trading costs, taxes and risk.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tobias, the Personal Fund co-founder who for years has been warning investors through his books and columns about the hidden costs of mutual funds, said he would be endorsing the concept as a low-cost alternative to mutual funds.</p>
        <p>''It stuns me how many folks currently pay a sales fee to buy a high-expense mutual fund over which they have no tax control,'' he said. ''We can help them see how much better they could be doing.''</p>
        <p>Stefan Sharkansky, the chief executive of Personal Fund, said that mutual funds would be around for a while, but that, ''over time, the mutual fund structure will be displaced by mass-customized personal accounts.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sharkansky says companies that do not offer customized funds in some form will risk losing investors like himself. Four years ago, he was the kind of customer whom most brokers dream about: he had been the president and the biggest shareholder of Prospero Systems, an Internet communications company that was acquired for $3 million, and he wanted to invest his share of the proceeds.</p>
        <p>After studying the costs of actively managed mutual funds, and after a big brokerage firm quoted him commission rates as high as 2 percent, Mr. Sharkansky decided to pick his own stocks, using an online broker. But in short order, he said, he became frustrated with this stock-by-stock approach.</p>
        <p>''Owning individual stocks is pretty appealing, but it's too much damn work to have to pick them one at a time,'' he said. ''I really wanted a more convenient solution which would help me get reasonable diversification and also appropriate tax strategies.''</p>
        <p>THEN he could not find online tools for building a more coherent investment strategy, he said, he decided to create his own. ''Just as Pierre Omidyar invented eBay so his girlfriend would have a place to buy Pez dispensers, I invented Personal Fund in order to satisfy my own needs,'' Mr. Sharkansky said, referring to one of the resounding success stories of electronic commerce.</p>
        <p>Personal Fund is preparing to offer free access to the portfolio-planning and tax-management tools on its Web site, www.personalfund.com, while it tries to strike deals to sell its basket-management software to brokerage firms.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sharkansky cites his wife, Irene Song Sharkansky, as an ideal prospect. A lawyer and a former employee of General Electric, she owns ''a fair amount'' of shares in G.E., one of the most widely held stocks in the world. ''Now, when she buys a mutual fund in her 401(k) at work, what is she buying?'' he asked. ''More G.E., which she doesn't need.''</p>
        <p>That is a problem that even the most cost-efficient index funds, like Vanguard's 500 Index, cannot conquer. By definition, funds that are intended to match the major stock-market indexes own shares in the biggest American companies. Occasionally, they also surprise their shareholders with taxable gains, because they must sell shares of companies that are deleted from indexes and buy shares of their replacements.</p>
        <p>''For the person who wants to buy big stocks and big stocks only, Vanguard 500 is a good choice,'' said Mr. O'Shaughnessy, the former money manager, who spelled out his quantitative approach to investing in ''What Works on Wall Street'' (McGraw-Hill, 1996).</p>
        <p>''Our proposition,'' he said, ''is that most people don't want to buy just big stocks.''</p>
        <p>All this talk about a brave new investing world does not seem to be rattling executives of the biggest mutual fund companies.</p>
        <p>Robert C. Pozen, a vice chairman of Fidelity Investments, said he thought the products would run into regulatory hurdles. Doing so could slow their development and drive up their costs.</p>
        <p>Purveyors of the new products assert that they are not subject to the Investment Company Act of 1940, which governs mutual funds. ''These are people who are trying to make believe that they're not mutual funds, but they're coming very close to the line, and I would say they're actually crossing the line,'' Mr. Pozen said. ''I think that issue will be litigated, and properly so.''</p>
        <p>John Brennan, chief executive of the Vanguard Group and chairman of the mutual fund industry trade group, the Investment Company Institute, was more dismissive. ''I think it's likely to be a niche product at best,'' he said. ''It's hard for me to see the competitive advantage in them.''</p>
        <p>This is not the first time that Vanguard executives, including Mr. Brennan, have spoken out against a new twist on mutual funds. In an interview in the February issue of Money magazine, George U. Sauter, head of Vanguard's indexing division, criticized exchange-traded funds. But by May, after several competitors had introduced them, Vanguard announced that it would also hop into that arena.</p>
        <p>If the mutual fund giants doubt the viability of folios, there are believers on the outskirts of the industry. Among them is Mr. Atkinson of Investec, a London firm that manages $27 billion worldwide. Investec's limited presence in the United States has driven Mr. Atkinson to devise out-of-the-ordinary products -- including a mutual fund that tracks an index created by the editors of Wired magazine, as well as the first wireless mutual fund -- to attract investors' attention.</p>
        <p>Now, he said, Investec is considering offering individual baskets of stocks ''as some kind of complementary products to our funds.''</p>
        <p>''While it may cannibalize the fund business,'' he added, ''we're more interested in serving our investors' needs.''  THERE are still plenty of skeptics who say they have seen threats to the mutual fund industry come and go, but the whiff of potential for the new personal funds seems to have many nostrils flaring.</p>
        <p>A recent check of available Internet domain names that incorporate the word ''folio'' revealed that dozens had already been taken. Among them were Schwabfolios.com and Vanguardfolios.com, though they were not registered by Schwab or Vanguard.</p>
        <p>Those and other domains with the word ''folio'' were registered by Peter Moran, the chief marketing executive for Turner Funds, which manages $10 billion, after he read an article in the July 31 issue of Barron's that mentioned Folio[fn].</p>
        <p>Mr. Moran said he had intended to reserve only one generic domain name, managedfolios.com, and had registered the other names unintentionally while experimenting at Register.com, a Web site that charges $35 to reserve an Internet address.</p>
        <p>''We sell mutual funds through Schwab -- obviously that's a faux pas,'' he said, adding that he planned to cancel his transactions for the Schwab and Vanguard domains. But he has been following the development of Folio[fn] and NetFolios for some time and wanted to find his own way to play.</p>
        <p>''It was more of a California gold rush -- jump on your horse and throw your stake in the ground,'' Mr. Moran said. But he is planning to keep managedfolios.com, in case the concept takes off, he said, adding, ''It might be the best $35 I ever spent.''</p>
