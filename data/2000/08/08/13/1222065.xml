        <p>WHAT renowned American classical ballet company garnered enough engagements in 1999 to employ its dancers for an impressive 41 weeks? The Joffrey Ballet, maybe? American Ballet Theater? No, it was Les Ballets Trockadero de Monte Carlo, fondly known as the Trocks, home of bulldozing stars like Olga Supphozova and Ida Nevasay neva. The company, opening at the Joyce Theater on Tuesday, will present two repertory programs consisting primarily of Slavic chestnuts, including the New York premiere of an impeccably affected ''Raymonda's Wedding,'' coached by Elena Kunikova. Because of an advance sell-out of their last Joyce engagement, the Trocks are extending this year's New York summer season to a full two weeks.</p>
        <p>Keeping ballerinas who are veritable ships of state in working form requires running a tight ship. Although heavy on levity, the all-male comedy ballet troupe, now in its 26th year, is run by a troika of no-nonsense leaders: Eugene McDougle, the general director; Tory Dobrin, the artistic director; and Pamela Pribisco, the ballet mistress. Their ingredients for financial as well as artistic success consist of low-cost, high-quality productions, impressive technical standards, audience accessibility and an undeniable talent for slapstick.</p>
        <p>Not a drop of grant money has ever been received by the Trocks. During the dance boom of the 1970's, the Trocks qualified for the National Endowment for the Arts' Dance Touring Program and became one of its biggest moneymakers. According to the program's guidelines, however, it was the sponsors who received the money, not the Trocks.</p>
        <p>''I've always felt that one of the reasons that the company has been financially successful was that we didn't get any funding in the beginning and did not, therefore, build up a superstructure that required a lot of money just to maintain a large staff and office space,'' says Mr. McDougle. He and Mr. Dobrin still run the company out of their apartments, renting rehearsal space at City Center when not on tour.</p>
        <p>After a slump in the 1980's, when the quality of the productions suffered, the Trocks pulled themselves up by their point shoe ribbons and developed a more professional look. Nancy Gabriel, vice president of I.M.G. Artists, which now handles bookings for the Trocks and other high-profile companies like the Parsons Dance Company and Pilobolus, identifies the Trocks' critically acclaimed 1997 London season at the Peacock Theater as a turning point. ''Their level of artistry, technique and comedic genius have never been at a higher level in their 26 years of existence,'' Ms. Gabriel says. ''They are attracting the best dancers who are getting rave reviews.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, while the Trocks of yesteryear felt quite at home falling off point, it is not unusual to see their current crop of 16 ballerinas churning out batches of triple fouettes or propelling themselves well into the stratosphere. When Madame Supphozova (a k a Robert Carter) launches into a diagonal of chaine turns in ''Paquita,'' her tutu takes on the ferocity of a buzz saw.</p>
        <p>The newly acquired technical superiority can be attributed to a generally higher level of male dancing.</p>
        <p>''The better trained they are when they come in,'' Ms. Pribisco says, ''the easier it is for them to learn to do point work, because it's not a different technique. It's an additional knowledge that they haven't experienced yet, because men don't do that vocabulary.''</p>
        <p>Les Ballets Grandiva, a successful male troupe founded by a former Trocks dancer, Victor Trevino, has also benefited from better male dancers. Paul Boos, a New York City Ballet alumnus who coaches Grandiva's dancers, stresses that, although the ballerinas may be portraying wilting sylphs or spry soubrettes, the physical demands of their performances are high.</p>
        <p>The wild popularity of Grandiva and the Trocks in Japan has provided a substantial part of their meal tickets. While the Trocks toured 37 cities in the United States and 6 European countries in 1999, the company recently completed its 16th Japanese tour with fees that actually produced a surplus. Its high jinks may be a perfect outlet in a nation that appreciates the broad sense of humor displayed in Tokyo's television game shows.</p>
        <p>But it is a similarity to the Kabuki Theater tradition, and not just in the form of heavily crayoned eyebrows and brazenly slashed eyeliner, that begs comparison. ''We fit into their cultural norms,'' Mr. McDougle says. ''Traditional Japanese theater has been totally male dominated. They have no problem accepting us as men doing women's roles.'' The adulation has even taken the form of an organized fan club of giggling teenage Japanese girls who hurl bouquets at their favorite divas.</p>
        <p>In terms of overall marketability, Ms. Gabriel praises the flexibility of the troupe. ''Sometimes they are presented on a straight dance program, other times on a variety or special attraction series, on a comedy series, or even on a family series. In short, there is almost always a place for them.'' Exquisitely made costumes, accompanied by simple sets, keep the freight costs of touring down.</p>
        <p>Not to be ignored is the audience appeal of old-style, Ballets Russes-inspired divas vamping in the spotlight and flaunting their indispensable mannerisms. ''Everyone in the Trocks is encouraged to really go to the max with their personalities,'' says Mr. Dobrin. ''And, you know, it's much easier when you have a wig, makeup and eyelashes on. You tap into those areas of your character that are a little wacky anyway.''</p>
