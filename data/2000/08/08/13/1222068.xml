        <p>WHAT gets called the 60's had any number of endings, most of them elusive or much debated. But for those who understood the decade (or era, or moment) as more a cultural than a political phenomenon -- a last, late Romantic pastoral -- the end came quite precisely and inarguably: Friday night, Dec. 6, 1969, at the Altamont Speedway not far from San Francisco, as the Rolling Stones, distracted and distraught, worked their way through ''Under My Thumb.''</p>
        <p>The Hell's Angels had been hired to provide security at the free, outdoor Altamont festival, which drew 300,000 people and was to feature not only the Stones but  also the Grateful Dead (whose manager had recommended the Angels' services), Santana, the Jefferson Airplane and Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young. The Angels, many of them new recruits to the club with something to prove, spent much of the afternoon clearing the area in front of the stage with the help of weighted pool cues. Then, a few songs into the Stones' closing set, several of the Angels developed a particular interest in an 18-year-old black man 10 or 15 yards from the stage. Meredith Hunter was attacked by one of the Angels, and when he pulled a gun and ran, was chased down, stabbed and beaten to death by a pack of them. None of the Stones could see this, but they knew something was happening -- it was there in the confusion of their playing, and in the fear they conveyed to one another in those quick glances with which longtime band mates say all that needs to be said.</p>

        <p>WHAT gets called the 60's had any number of endings, most of them elusive or much debated.

        <p>The Hell's Angels had been hired to provide security at the free, outdoor Altamont festival, which drew 300,000 people and was to feature not only the Stones but  also the Grateful Dead (whose manager had recommended the Angels' services), Santana, the Jefferson Airplane and Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young. The Angels, many of them new recruits to the club with something to prove, spent much of the afternoon clearing the area in front of the stage with the help of weighted pool cues. Then, a few songs into the Stones' closing set, several of the Angels developed a particular interest in an 18-year-old black man 10 or 15 yards from the stage. Meredith Hunter was attacked by one of the Angels, and when he pulled a gun and ran, was chased down, stabbed and beaten to death by a pack of them. None of the Stones could see this, but they knew something was happening -- it was there in the confusion of their playing, and in the fear they conveyed to one another in those quick glances with which longtime band mates say all that needs to be said.</p>
        <p>This moment is understood in such terrible detail largely because of ''Gimme Shelter,'' the extraordinary cinema verite account by Albert and David Maysles and Charlotte Zwerin of the Stones' 1969 American tour that ended in the Altamont darkness. The documentary, which takes its name from a Stones song, was something of a hit for months after it opened in September 1970 -- a run that solidified Altamont in the counterculture imagination as the Last Big Bummer.</p>
        <p>The film also inspired reams of a very 60's kind of commentary. There were analyses of the lyrics of Stones songs like ''Sympathy for the Devil,'' raising the possibility that the band's own music had somehow conjured the Altamont debacle. And there were anguished tracts that pondered the fate of the nation's youth and the collapse of Woodstock Nation. The critic Albert Goldman, writing in The New York Times, suggested that the movie documented how the ''most unruly generation in American history is demanding -- and receiving -- punishment by big father figures.'' For Mr. Goldman and others, the Stones'  '69 tour was not about rock music, really. It was about the big stuff -- the darkness of the social unconscious, of modern civilization itself -- for which the music was just a soundtrack.</p>
        <p>I doubt that the 30th-anniversary rerelease of ''Gimme Shelter'' (it opened on Friday) will engender that sort of Last Days exegesis. It remains a remarkable film nevertheless, and one of its many remarkable aspects is its very un-60's-like measure: it unfolds the story of Altamont vividly, but not to the exclusion of other stories. One of these -- and the one that, 30 years on, matters more to cultural history than Altamont -- is that of a band bringing to pop music the spectacle and glamour and startling sonic intensity that had always been rock's promise. On what could be called the prototype for the arena-rock tour, the Stones were not only securing their place as the premiere band of that time but pointing where rock, for better and for worse, would go in the 1970's and beyond. The Stones weren't the end of anything but a beginning, ambitious and sensational.</p>
        <p>''Gimme Shelter's'' first extended scene takes place, oddly and effectively, after Altamont, with Mick Jagger, Keith Richards and Charlie Watts ruminating about the concert in the Maysles's editing room. It's a setting that is returned to time and again as the film cuts from concert performances to backstage scenes, and occasionally fast-forwards to the negotiations that at the 11th hour allowed the big free concert to go on. The editing room trope creates self-consciousness and distance, durable guards against sensationalism. But more than that, it permits the Stones -- studying film of the tour on editing monitors -- to be introduced as many could not or would not imagine them back then: as serious young musicians baffled by how their story had somehow, in a knife-flash, come down to this.</p>
        <p>The group had not been to America since the summer of 1966, when a fan was still likely to be a sobbing girl chaperoned by her dad. The Stones had been through a lot since then: drug charges, squabbles and, musically, a disappointing psychedelic period that culminated in a portentous mess of an album, ''Their Satanic Majesties Request.'' By the end of 1967, Brian Jones was drifting deeper into drugs and booze, and there were rumors of a Stones split-up.</p>
        <p>In the first months of 1968, Mr. Jagger and Mr. Richards, who together wrote the band's songs, set about to rid their music of all flower-power traces and to recapture the Stones' essence: fast, hard, rocking blues, metallic and elemental. But the hit singles like ''Jumpin' Jack Flash'' and the rock songs on their album ''Beggar's Banquet'' -- it had acoustic tunes, too, which sound a lot like today's alt-country -- represented more than a simple return to roots. The rock was now more epic and anthemic, the lyrics more imagistic (and lubricious), the playing more sophisticated and the sound more grittily viscid than any that pop music had yet produced. It begged to be played loud and live, and it's what the Stones brought with them to America in October 1969.</p>
        <p>WITH them, too, was a young blues guitar player named Mick Taylor; he was taking the place of Mr. Jones, who had been forced out of the group in June 1968 and, a month later, was found dead in his swimming pool. And along for the tour's last weeks was the documentary crew -- actually a couple of different crews, hastily assembled when the Stones decided, more than halfway into the tour, that a film might be a cool idea. (The band maintained a veto over the film's content, a power they chose, in the end, not to exercise, though reportedly not without some anguish.) ''Gimme Shelter's'' anxious, quickened feel no doubt owes something to the last-minute nature of the project, but it is in keeping with the Maysles's aesthetic, which was to grab truth where it lay in agile, relatively unobtrusive snatches, and so limn the reality hidden in plain sight.</p>
        <p>The ''truth'' about the Stones turns out to be what fundamentally un-countercultural lives they were leading. There was more hard liquor around than hard drugs, and their taste in women ran not to hippie chicks but to Marilyn Monroe (Mr. Richards shows off a T-shirt with her bosomy image) and Tina Turner (who, with husband Ike, opened for them on the tour). Mainly, though, there was work: the shuttles to the airport in packed sedans and to concerts in dangerously packed helicopters; the meetings with the press and the concert organizers; the album cover to shoot and the album to mix.</p>
        <p>Of course, the most inspired work the Stones do in ''Gimme Shelter'' is on stage. Concert footage was shot not only at the Altamont festival but during several shows at Madison Square Garden two weeks earlier, and it's these scenes, in the force and very essence of what they capture, that put Altamont in perspective -- that, in effect, put the lie to Altamont's stated purpose. At one point in the film, Mr. Jagger is seen pontificating to the press about how the festival would create ''a sort of microcosmic society'' from which everyone, you know, might learn to live together and love together. But the Stones had no genuine interest in furthering the Woodstock Nation, whatever that was. On stage, their desire was to commune with the ghosts of the Mississippi Delta and with one another. And, at the Garden, commune they did.</p>
        <p>Dramatically lighted, suffused with a pop glamour only the Beatles rivaled (and they were no longer touring) and benefiting from a state-of-the-art sound system that captures their dirty rocking blues with astonishing vibrance and clarity, the Stones play furiously, the guitars clawing at one another, the bass and drums thundering.Each of the band members is lost in the music, particularly Mr. Jagger, who, prancing and shimmying and singing ecstatically, somehow embodies the mesmerizing sound. The audience connects, but not as compatriots. They're enraptured spectators. (The film shows this, too.) They're experiencing what gets called art.</p>
        <p>I was there, down with the cameras, when the Stones came on past midnight at the last Garden show. I was 16, and I had spent much of the evening wending my way from the cheap seats toward the stage. I got about as close to the Stones as Meredith Hunter did, and later I would think about that a lot, but not because I ever thought it could have been me. Meredith Hunter's death was not about the Stones, or the 60's. He perished in the miasma of booze and drugs and testosterone that still poisons soccer matches and late-night bars along with rock festivals, here and around the world. That wasn't the mood of the Garden that night.</p>
        <p>The only danger that night was the danger created by certain types of music -- the sound of dread experience, seeking you out. It couldn't  bring about a ''microcosmic society,'' that music, but it could overpower you, make you feel things, show you a nasty good time and give you something to marvel at. The Stones, through the mid-70's, would perfect this kind of spectacular rock show by professional rock stars, and countless others would embroider upon what they more or less invented in the fall of '69: Led Zeppelin, U2 and Pearl Jam, and, it should not go unmentioned, Aerosmith, Guns 'n' Roses and Limp Bizkit. No band, though, ever played it better than the one captured 30 years ago, and forever, in ''Gimme Shelter.''</p>
