        <p>HALF-JEW</p>
        <p>A Daughter's Search</p>
        <p>for Her Family's Buried Past.</p>
        <p>By Susan Jacoby.</p>
        <p>Illustrated. 302 pp. New York: Scribner. $ 25.</p>
        <p>Not until her early 20's, after moving to Washington to work as a journalist, did Susan Jacoby's suspicions about Jewish skeletons in her family closet harden into a conviction. She suddenly found herself surrounded by reporters who simply assumed that she was Jewish because of her last name. Nobody in her hometown of Okemos, Mich., had ever raised this possibility, except, perhaps, for one of the nuns who taught her in parochial school. Sister Misericordia, her sixth-grade teacher, had spoken obliquely of ''certain influences within the family'' after Jacoby turned in a story that struck her as decidedly Jewish, about a ''a girl trying to concentrate on her homework while a spider concentrated on spinning a web underneath her dress.'' Jacoby retrospectively interprets her adolescent essay as a subconscious expression of her intimations of a buried identity. The episode introduces a secondary theme of ''Half-Jew'': writers need to know where they come from, and the obstacles confronting those who grow up in a family with a hidden past are daunting.</p>
        <p>Jacoby speaks of the ''sense of genuine pleasure and release'' she experienced once she finally figured out the ''deep dark secret'' of her father's origins. Robert Jacoby wasn't an Episcopal convert to Catholicism -- as he had claimed -- after all: ''Dad's Jewishness explained all of the inconsistencies and half-truths, as well as the powerful mixed signals he had been sending, and I had been receiving, throughout my teenage years.'' In the course of her research into her father's ancestry, her initial anger about his lies turns into a sympathetic understanding of a man ''with no Jewish education of any kind, a vessel emptied of Jewish content, open to the magical metamorphosis promised by conversion.'' It was not as if her father had grown up in a home with any coherent sense of Jewish identity. His was the third generation of fully assimilated Jews. As a child in the 1920's in New York he and his siblings (who would also intermarry and convert to Catholicism) would be served brisket and sponge cake -- traditional Passover fare -- at the family Easter dinner. It is not surprising, then, that in the absence of any positive religious or cultural inheritance, and in the face of the run-of-the-mill anti-Semitism he experienced in the schoolyards of Brooklyn and in the social world of Dartmouth College (where he lasted only two years), he came to see his Jewishness as a source of shame, something to be hidden or put aside.</p>
        <p>Because Susan Jacoby was cut off from interaction with practicing Jews and raised in a Catholic home, her formative understanding of Jewish identity was grounded not in any sense of the history, rituals or sacred texts of the Jews, but in powerful post-Holocaust narratives like Anne Frank's diary, Leon Uris's ''Exodus'' and Elie Wiesel's ''Night'' -- books that offer a portrait of Jews as victims, one that fits neatly into the familiar Catholic genre of martyrology. As conversant as Jacoby would subsequently become with Jewish traditions, her identification with Jews as a persecuted people would remain at the core of her adult conception of Jewishness.</p>
        <p>A confirmed atheist, as alienated by rabbinical Judaism as she was by the rigid doctrines of Catholicism, the adult Jacoby faced a difficult bind: she was unwilling to embrace Judaism fully -- that is, to convert or engage in ritual observance -- but she was equally unwilling to surrender all connection to her Jewishness. Hence the title, ''Half-Jew.'' She knows that this is a deliberately provocative term. To Orthodox Jews there's no such thing: if your mother is Jewish you are too; if not, you're not. Even Reform Jews, who recognize patrilineal descent, require those who claim a Jewish identity to accept it fully. The last ones to call people half-Jews or mischlinge were Nazis; they divided identity up so neatly because they saw Jewishness in racial, not religious or cultural terms. Despite this disturbing association, Jacoby insists upon her status as half-Jew, an identity that carries with it unusual burdens and possibilities. Her ultimate response to the inevitable question, ''What does a half-Jew believe? -- Anything she wants,' ''will undoubtedly please some readers and frustrate others.</p>
        <p>Much of the burden has to do with writing. She first confronted the term ''half-Jew'' in an essay by Cynthia Ozick, who used the phrase to characterize Montaigne and Proust. The tag resonated with Jacoby and spoke directly to the difficulties a mixed inheritance created for writers: the ''labyrinthine nature of the search for long-concealed truth, with its inevitable false starts and dead ends, may explain why half-Jews have not yet established an imaginative voice in American literature.'' That is beginning to change, if books like Mary Gordon's ''Shadow Man'' and Stephen J. Dubner's ''Turbulent Souls'' are any indication; in fact there is a rich legacy beyond America's shores, reaching back to books like Uriel da Costa's wrenching 17th-century memoir, ''Specimen of a Human Life.'' Indeed, if the works of Zadie Smith, Anita Brookner and Ruth Prawer Jhabvala are any indication, a hybrid cultural or geographic inheritance seems increasingly to be a defining feature of the modern novelist. And while the debilitating effects of growing up with parental deception are obvious, one wonders if there aren't some advantages as well: in Jacoby's case, her early recognition of stories that didn't add up and her acute sensitivity to shades of meaning may well have helped her become such a perceptive journalist and writer.</p>
        <p>When, in his early 60's, Jacoby's father was finally able to talk openly with his daughter about her relationship to Jewishness, he could not help drawing attention to the limitations of an affiliation that turned on seeing Jews as tragic victims: ''It's+. . .+It's like letting Hitler define the terms. Holocaust, Holocaust, Holocaust -- well, it seems to me that being a Jew has to mean something more.'' This book itself, then, is Jacoby's response to his demand for ''something more,'' a way of writing herself into Jewish history, of reconstructing ''what could be reconstructed of the fragments the Jacoby family left behind.'' It is impossible not to admire her courage and her dedication to this task. The result is a book of considerable interest not only as a memoir, but also as a detective story and as a social history of assimilation. Sadly, though, by the time that Jacoby was able to piece together the surviving fragments of her family's Jewish past, there wasn't much left to salvage.</p>
