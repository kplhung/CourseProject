        <p>Stahl Real Estate opens baseball center called Frozen Ropes, first of chain of such stores to open in New York City, on West 74th Street between Broadway and Amsterdam Avenue; logo (S)</p>

        <p>There used to be a section under the  bank building on West 74th Street between Broadway and Amsterdam Avenue that was used as a bowling alley, where employees socialized. It was also once a print shop, and most recently, used as storage space. But on July 11, the day of the Major League Baseball all-star game, Stahl Real Estate, the company that owns the landmark location, began using the large basement space at 202 West 74th Street for a baseball center called Frozen Ropes. It is the first Frozen Ropes in New York City.</p>
        <p>Like the six others in the United States and Canada, Frozen Ropes offers batting cage and pitching mound rentals, birthday parties and corporate events, one-on-one professional instruction, weekend clinics and after-school programs for children 7 to 15. The center does not run a baseball league.</p>

        <p>The general manager is a retired Montreal Expos relief pitcher, Derek Aucoin. The name, he said, is a baseball term for the ''ultimate line drive,'' one that ''defies gravity.''</p>
