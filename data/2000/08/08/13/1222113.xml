        <p>THERE was a time when the advertising slogan of the Putnam County Visitors' Bureau, ''Where the Country Begins,'' seemed the perfect description of Route 22, the main road here.</p>
        <p>Drivers heading north from New York City and Westchester could jostle with traffic on the parkways and then race up I-684, where no matter how fast they were driving, it wasn't fast enough for the tailgater behind them. But once they crossed the bridge over the Croton River and got onto Route 22, they could relax.</p>
        <p>The two-lane road, lush with swamp maples, oak trees and untamed shrubs, first forced drivers to slow to country pace, then opened up to a vista of old-time American enterprise. A drive-in hamburger stand, diners, bait and tackle shops, a survivalist's outlet, a cattle ranch, a taco restaurant with more kitsch than kitchen and even a modest ski slope add to the hokey charm of the road.</p>
        <p>These days, however, suburbia has caught up with Route 22. Traffic has slowed from a leisurely trot to a frustrating crawl, and the State Department of Transportation, which has been contemplating widening the road for at least 15 years, says that, come fall, it will unveil its plan for expansion at a series of public hearings.</p>
        <p>''It's about time,'' said Celeste Bachrach, 48, an art teacher from Southeast (more commonly known by its mailing address, Brewster). ''They should have widened it a long time ago. What were they waiting for?''</p>
        <p>Like many in the towns of Southeast and Patterson, Mrs. Bachrach settled in Putnam County because it was a fast drive to Westchester, where her husband works.</p>
        <p>''The only reason I got him to move to Brewster was because we could live right off Route 22,'' said Mrs. Bachrach, who moved from Mount Kisco in 1987. ''Now, that traffic just makes me crazy. I will go to any length to avoid 22.''</p>
        <p>And she means any length.</p>
        <p>Instead of going to a Chinese restaurant less than a half mile away on Route 22, for instance, Mrs. Bachrach drives to Danbury, a round trip of 18 miles, for takeout.</p>
        <p>''It takes me forever to get there and back,'' she said. ''But I get so aggravated and my level of stress gets so high in traffic, it's worth it to me to take a little longer.''</p>
        <p>Route 22 was once a main thoroughfare from New York City to Canada, but over the years it has been bisected and marginalized throughout Westchester. In Putnam County, however, it remains a major north-south road. It is also the state's easternmost major road, making it attractive to drivers heading to New England.</p>
        <p>The section of the road the state is now considering widening is just 3.1 miles long. It starts at the end of I-684 and goes to Doansburg Road, said Brian J. Doherty the Route 22 project manager for the Department of Transportation.</p>
        <p>The proposed $25 million project would widen the road to four lanes and add a median divider from the Interstate to the first stop light, at Milltown Road. The four lanes would continue but instead of having a raised median it would be divided by a center turning lane. The project would end just past the State Police barracks.</p>
        <p>The project, which has been discussed since the mid-1980's, has been held up by, among other things, concerns about New York City's water. The section of Route 22 to be widened is bounded on both sides by reservoirs that are part of the Croton Reservoir System. To the east, just beyond the road, lies the East Branch Reservoir. To the west lies the Bog Brook Reservoir.</p>
        <p>In the fall the Department of Transportation will complete its environmental assessment. Public hearings will be held, and the state will evaluate comments. If the plan is approved, construction is expected to begin in 2002, Mr. Doherty said.</p>
        <p>When construction is contemplated in watershed territory, however, nothing moves quickly. One 1997 proposal involved filling in a portion of the Bog Brook Reservoir.</p>
        <p>''When we saw it, we said 'Oh wow!,''' said Geoffrey C. Ryan, a spokesman for the New York City Department of Environmental Protection. ''We are certainly not interested in having any incursion in our reservoir.''</p>
        <p>So the state scrapped that plan.</p>
        <p>While the issues are being resolved, traffic continues to grow. Last year, there were about 26,000 cars on the 3.1 mile stretch of road each day. The road averages about 85 accidents a year, Mr. Doherty said.</p>
        <p>Traffic is expected to increase by 1 percent every year for the next 20 years, Mr. Doherty said, as a housing boom continues.</p>
        <p>In 1990 Putnam County, which has six towns and is the state's smallest county, had 83,941 residents. By July 1998, the population had jumped to 93,358, and demographers expect another big jump in the 2000 census.</p>
        <p>In Dutchess County, the next county north, the population rose 3.4 percent from 1990 to 1999, to 268,237. But in Dutchess, new housing permits suggest that the boom is just beginning. There are 106 major residential projects (of 25 residences or more) planned or under construction in Dutchess, said Lindsay Carille, a junior planner in the county's Planning Department.</p>
        <p>More houses translate into more traffic.</p>
        <p>''The traffic really started to get bad in the 80's with the last economic boom we had,'' Lois C. Zutell, the Southeast town supervisor, said. ''For the amount of commuters we have now, I don't think you have any question that this road has to be fixed. The inconvenience it is causing is just unbelievable. Plus the Friday afternoon traffic with all the New Yorkers going up to the Berkshires is just too much.''</p>
        <p>But a lot of those weekend commuters like Route 22 for its old-fashioned feel.</p>
        <p>Red Rooster, a drive-in that started as an ice cream parlor in the early 60's, is a particular favorite of the country house set. On Friday evenings and again on Sunday afternoons the parking lot fills with Range Rovers, Lexus sport utility vehicles and Mercedes convertibles, whose drivers make a ritual of stopping off during their trips from Manhattan to the Berkshires or Millwood or some other lush country haunt.</p>
        <p>''Our clientele is very exclusive,'' said Jack Sypek, 62, a manager and one-time part owner who has worked at Red Rooster for 29 years. ''Doctors, lawyers, movie stars, they all come here. Kevin Bacon, Michael J. Fox, Sam Waterson, James Earl Jones, you name it, they stop here. They like the atmosphere.''</p>
        <p>There's a lot to like. Red Rooster, which regularly gets good ratings in Zagat's dining guides and has been voted one of the nation's best hamburger havens by those who vote on such things, is steeped in nostalgia.</p>
        <p>Clean-cut teenagers in crisp white uniforms serve fast food with manners and enthusiasm straight out of the 50's. Customers squeeze into the tiny vestibule that was added in the 70's and then bring their food out to one of the 25 picnic tables. Adults eat and chat while children climb a graceful apple tree. There's room to walk the dog and a somewhat faded miniature golf course, which features one hole with Porky Pig (par 3) and another with Bugs Bunny (par 2).</p>
        <p>Tim Pasik, who lives on 72nd Street and Park Avenue in Manhattan and drives with his three children, his wife and two nannies to his country home in Salisbury on most weekends, looks forward to his weekly stop at the Red Rooster.</p>
        <p>''If we get here in time for dinner, we do dinner,'' said Mr. Pasik, 40, a reinsurance underwriter. ''If not, we get ice cream and coffee. We stop here all the time. We wouldn't miss it.''</p>
        <p>Under the proposed widening plan, Route 22 would have to veer more to the Red Rooster side of the road (the east side) than it does now in order to preserve a pre-Revolutionary War graveyard just a bit north. Red Rooster would lose most of its parking lot and all of its miniature golf course, Mr. Sypek said.</p>
        <p>''Don't worry, we have plans,'' Mr. Sypek said. ''We own the land next to us, and we'll rebuild.''</p>
        <p>But it remains to be seen whether making changes to Red Rooster, which, Mr. Sypek said, is now ''doing as much business as we can handle,'' will affect its fortunes. After all, one of Red Rooster's charms is that it's not something designed to look retro. It's the real thing.</p>
        <p>''They don't pay you for loss of business,'' Mr. Sypek said. ''They just pay you for what they take.''</p>
        <p>Edward R. Heelan, president of Heelan Realty and Development Corporation in Brewster, is skeptical that the road expansion will take place anytime soon.</p>
        <p>''I've heard that before,'' he said. ''They've been singing that song for 20 years.''</p>
        <p>He thinks the state's delay on the road expansion is hurting Putnam County's tax base. Businesses are going elsewhere because they don't like the traffic problem on Route 22. Mr. Heelan represents the owners of 1,000 acres of land that is currently for sale along Route 22.</p>
        <p>''You need commercial development to offset all the residential development that's going on,'' Mr. Heelan said. ''Route 22 is a prime avenue for that. I took out a client today who wanted to build a 60,000-square-foot facility. He wouldn't even look at 22. There is a cloud hanging over it. People want to know, Where will the road go, where will the turnarounds be, what will traffic be like?''</p>
        <p>He added that the planned expansion doesn't go far enough.</p>
        <p>''When they finish up to Doansburg Road, they'll have to start the next section, up through Patterson,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Some people fear that if the road is widened it will begin to resemble Central Avenue in Yonkers and lose its country flavor, green space and mom-and-pop shops.</p>
        <p>''Nobody's for that,'' said Sean Diggin, whose family owns two motels, Heidi's Inn and the Bel Air Motor Lodge.</p>
        <p>Heidi's, with 40 rooms, a restaurant and a pool, is old Brewster. It will benefit from  road construction because the plan is to move the road away from Heidi's to straighten out a bad curve, Mr. Diggin said.</p>
        <p>''It used to be like the Poconos, a summer resort,'' Mr. Diggin said. ''You'd have to make reservations a year in advance.''</p>
        <p>But the Bel Air Motor Lodge, an unassuming stopover for truck drivers and construction workers, may have to close. The road will take over its parking lot and the land where its well lies.</p>
        <p>''They say we can relocate it, but I don't know where,'' Mr. Diggin said.</p>
        <p>It has been a long time since a spot alongside Route 22 was considered a summer resort. Two shopping plazas were built in the last five years, each with its own A.&amp;P., Blockbuster Video and Dollar stores, and the plazas are just eight miles apart.</p>
        <p>Edie Keasbey, 70, has lived in Patterson, just down the road from one of the new shopping plazas, since 1938.</p>
        <p>She is a member of watchdog organizations like the Croton Watershed Clean Water Coalition, and for decades she has watched as farm lands sprouted housing developments, wetlands were filled in and country roads were paved over.</p>
        <p>''Basically, improvements in roads leads to more development and more traffic and more over everything we are trying to put a brake on up here,'' she said. ''It's such a vicious circle.''</p>
