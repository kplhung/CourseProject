        <p>WHAT was once one of Brooklyn's most important clubs is now St. Ann's School, founded in 1965 at 129 Pierrepont Street with unconventional goals and described in its brochure as ''an amusement park'' in which the amusements include Aristophanes, Darwin and Baudelaire. Now the school is in the middle of a $1 million facade renovation for the building, which was completed in Brooklyn Heights in 1906 for the Crescent Athletic Club.</p>
        <p>In the late 19th century, Brooklyn was a city, not a borough, and it had a growing network of civic, cultural and political organizations. The Crescent Athletic Club was organized in 1884 to play football in Prospect Park, and soon became a social and athletic organization. Such was the rapid growth of Brooklyn that within 10 years the club had a giant complex in Bay Ridge -- fields, a boathouse and a shingled country club -- along with a downtown building at 25 Pierrepont Street.</p>
        <p>Brooklyn became part of New York City in 1898, and the club kept expanding. In 1902 The New York Tribune reported that the club, with membership limited to 1,500 and dues of $50 a year, was going to build a new clubhouse.</p>
        <p>The new building, designed by Frank Freeman, went up at Pierrepont and Clinton Streets across from the Long Island Historical Society (now the Brooklyn Historical Society). Freeman had done exquisite work in the 1890's in the Romanesque Revival style -- his designs included the former Eagle Warehouse on Old Fulton Street near the Brooklyn Bridge -- but by 1906 the rich expanses of dark brick that marked his high period were out of fashion.</p>
        <p>For the new structure, Freeman adapted the neo-classical style, with deeply rusticated limestone on the ground floor and light brick and terra cotta above, where the figure of a crescent is worked into the design.  The Crescent clubhouse is usually slighted when compared to his earlier work, but the deft handling of the terra cotta detail, especially at the upper floors, shows a very competent hand.</p>
        <p>The new clubhouse had 12 levels, with a swimming pool, rifle range and bowling alleys in the basement, a grand hall on the second floor, a double-height oak-paneled dining room on the third floor, a gym on the top floor, and sleeping rooms, squash and handball courts, a library, and billiard and other rooms on other levels.</p>
        <p>An article in Architects' &amp; Builders' Magazine in 1907 praised Freeman's handling of the architectural detail but took issue with his use of double-height window frames to make the facade resemble a much lower building. Although the same approach met with general praise when McKim, Mead &amp; White used it on the University Club at Fifth Avenue and 54th Street in Manhattan, here the magazine considered it ''superficial beauty at the cost of accuracy.''</p>
        <p>The clubhouse was built under the presidency of Charles M. Bull, a Wall Street broker who lived five blocks away, at 269 Henry Street. The year the clubhouse opened, Bull circulated a stern letter complaining about steady thefts of club silverware, hairbrushes and other items emblazoned with the club's crescent-moon symbol. He called it larceny and threatened more serious action if the thefts did not stop.</p>
        <p>Bull's son, Charles M. Bull Jr., was a frequent club champion in singles tennis, squash and bowling. And the club itself was an early and powerful force in ice hockey and lacrosse. In 1912, the Crescent was 11-2 in amateur lacrosse, playing Cornell, Swarthmore and several Canadian clubs.  By that time the Crescent's membership was 2,650.</p>
        <p>But membership began to fall in the mid-1920's -- indeed, the city's landscape is filled with the sites and shells of abandoned turn-of-the-century clubhouses.</p>
        <p>Membership had fallen to 1,600 in 1929 when the club expanded to include a 215-acre site in Huntington, Long Island, for polo, cricket, golf and other sports. Accounts vary as to whether it was the club or only individual members who purchased the property, which still survives as the Huntington Crescent Club.</p>
        <p>The club cleaned its Brooklyn facade in 1936, the same year the Bowery Savings Bank forced the sale of the club's Bay Ridge property. In 1939 the Crescent Athletic Club itself filed for bankruptcy. The next year it vacated its clubhouse, closing after only 56 years.</p>
        <p>The building was then used for offices and stores -- the Crescent Bowling Lanes operated out of the basement in the 1950's. In 1966 the nearby St. Ann's Episcopal Church bought the structure for $365,000, for use by its school. St. Ann's School gradually expanded through the building. Student artwork now decorates the old store windows on the ground floor.</p>
        <p>St. Ann's School became a separate entity from the church in 1982. It has 1,050 students, and has a reputation for art, theater and a sense of its own differentness. The school's catalog describes it as ''something new, something that does not fit, designed for the child who will not fit.''</p>
        <p>IN addition to the more straightforward subjects, among them Latin and Japanese, the catalog also offers Recombinant DNA Technology, Floor Hockey and Enemies of the Roman Empire. No grades are given. The catalog asserts ''an undisguised, confident and possibly reactionary commitment to Western civilization.''</p>
        <p>Although much of the interior has been stripped, several of the club's original rooms survive. But the marble floor in the main hall, with its crescent inset, is covered in linoleum, and the classical-style murals by the Rambusch Decorating Company in the hall and the library (the old club dining room) are damaged and dark with age.</p>
        <p>The school's longterm headmaster, Stanley Bosworth, says that frequent street excavations continually loosen the facade and have led to the current project to repair the elevations on Clinton and Pierrepont Streets.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bosworth says he is no particular fan of the building's historic character -- he would, for instance, like to replace the original wooden windows with modern ones. But he says he loves the complexity of the multilevel structure: ''It's highly idiosyncratic, like we are. It has a thousand-odd shapes, and we never get bored.''</p>
