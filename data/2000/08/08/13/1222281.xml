        <p>Kenya Latrell Johnson, a daughter of Josephine and Walter Johnson of Brooklyn, and Michael George Johnson, the son of Nancy and George Johnson of St. Albans, Queens, were married yesterday. The Rev. Richard J. Lawson performed the ceremony at the New Canaan Baptist Church in Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Johnson, 29, works in Manhattan as the project manager in marketing for Discovery.com, the Web site for Discovery Communications, a media company. She graduated from Clark Atlanta University in Georgia. Her mother retired as a traffic enforcement agent with the New York Police Department. Her father, also retired, was a porter for the New York City Transit Authority.</p>
        <p>Mr. Johnson, 27, is a senior planner with the New York City Economic Development Corporation. He graduated from the University of Virginia at Charlottesville. His mother is a real estate sales representative with Greene Team Realty in St. Albans. His father is a custodian with the New York City Board of Education.</p>
        <p>The couple met the old-fashioned way: at church, specifically the New Canaan Baptist Church, in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn. They had grown up in that church together but over the years had exchanged no more than a polite ''How are you?'' They didn't even know each other's names.</p>
        <p>In the fall of 1997, the bride, who had been working as a promotions coordinator at various Atlanta television stations, made the church one of her first stops after returning to Brooklyn. She had taken a job at a pay-per-view television service in Manhattan and was re-establishing her social life in New York.</p>
        <p>Mr. Johnson was putting away his trumpet after playing for the Sunday morning service when she approached him. He, too, had recently returned to Brooklyn, after receiving a master's degree in city planning from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ''I had recognized him from the church,'' Mrs. Johnson said.</p>
        <p>The two commiserated about the task of finding jobs, and he took her business card. He was about to move to Maryland but called her a couple of times just to chat. About a week later, when job prospects in Maryland didn't pan out, he returned to New York and made a date.</p>
        <p>By the end of the evening, Mr. Johnson said, he was seeing her ''in a different light.'' She didn't have stars in her eyes yet, but she agreed to get together again.</p>
        <p>''I liked his warmth,'' Mrs. Johnson remembered. ''He was easy to be with. He loved his family and was intelligent.'' By the third or fourth date, he had won her over.</p>
        <p>By December 1997, things were serious enough to make both sets of parents check to see if branches of the two family trees were somehow entwined. (They aren't. His roots are in Virginia, hers in North Carolina.) After he proposed last Christmas Eve, the jokes began.</p>
        <p>''The whole church refers to us as Johnson &amp; Johnson,'' the bride said. ''They say, 'Here comes Johnson &amp; Johnson -- not the baby powder, but the love crew.' ''</p>
