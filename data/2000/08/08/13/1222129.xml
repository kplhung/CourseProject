        <p>JOHN LAWS'S service station, with two pumps, is the last one in town, now that the Mobil station has closed. Mr. Laws, who is 63, can remember when there were seven, and he can remember the two clothing stores, the barber shop, the movie theater, the hardware store, the pool hall and the A&amp;P. And those were just some of the businesses on Main Street.</p>
        <p>''You didn't have to leave to do anything,'' Mr. Laws said as he stood outside Laws &amp; Laws service station and hardware store, the busiest place in town on this hot weekday morning.</p>
        <p>Now, you have to leave Port Norris to do practically everything. There is just Laws &amp; Laws and Newcomb's grocery across the street, and a small pizzeria. There is no pharmacy, no laundry, no library, no liquor store, no diner. The two doctors in town just gave notice that they will be moving to Millville, 12 miles away.</p>
        <p>From its docks on the Maurice River, this settlement in Commercial Township used to send Delaware Bay oysters north by the boxcar. But since a blight devastated the beds in the 1950's, Port Norris has been emptying. An industry that once had 4,500 workers has fewer than 200 today, and nothing has come to take its place.</p>
        <p>And now Port Norris, with 1,000 to 1,500 residents, is just the biggest bead on a string of tidewater hamlets -- Dividing Creek, Turkey Point Corner, Cedarville -- on the edge of the vast bayside marsh, their clapboard buildings peeling, their commercial centers an occasional grocery with a wooden floor and their residents separated by miles of lowland farms from any sign of New Jersey's labor-hungry suburbs.</p>
        <p>Unemployment rates are not broken down by municipality, but the Commercial Township mayor, George Garrison, said joblessness here was ''in the double digits, and I'm sure of that much.''</p>
        <p>Commercial Township is not the poorest municipality in Cumberland County -- average incomes in Bridgeton and Fairfield and Maurice River Townships are lower -- but it cannot support itself.</p>
        <p>The township's chief financial officer, Judson Moore, said the biggest tax-paying industry was sand mining, which provided few jobs. The biggest employer, Mr. Moore said, is the school district, with 70 to 80 employees.</p>
        <p>Otherwise, the jobs are in Millville and Vineland, at least 20 minutes away. The nearest supermarket is in Millville, too.</p>
        <p>Port Norris's ambitions now center on its future as a site for development as part of a federal empowerment zone for distressed areas. The designation brings many forms of aid, which local officials want to use for a wastewater treatment plant, among other things, needed to draw business back to the waterfront.</p>
        <p>They also want to bring tourists to the waterfront, consisting of the fishing villages of Shellpile and Bivalve, with its marinas and its unspoiled view across the river's mouth.</p>
        <p>But sometimes development presents a bind, too. ''If we ever get a water and sewer treatment plant down here, people have to start paying fees,'' Mr. Moore said. ''But there are a lot of poor people in this town. I've talked to senior citizens who have an income of $7,600 for the whole year.''</p>
        <p>Nor are people clamoring for strip malls and entertainment parks, although Port Norris could use bus service -- to Millville, or anywhere.</p>
        <p>''This is a pretty isolated corner of New Jersey,'' said Stephen Kehs, the director of economic development for Cumberland County. ''Most of the people I've spoken to in these little bayshore towns and villages like it that way.''</p>
        <p>Isolation has its advantages for Port Norris. ''There's not a lot to spend dollars on,'' Mr. Moore said. ''But we're hoping people rediscover it.''</p>
