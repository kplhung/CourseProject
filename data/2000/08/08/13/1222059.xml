        <p>NINE years ago, before ''Survivor,'' before ''Big Brother,'' before ''The Real World,'' even, I was introduced to reality programming of the most intimate sort. It was thrilling and disturbing. It made me want to look away. It made me want to look back again. I think it even made me nauseous. But then everything made me nauseous, because I was pregnant. This was the final week of Lamaze class and my spouse and I and our classmates were finally watching the Movie.</p>
        <p>Most Lamaze classes screen a variation of the Movie, a natural childbirth documentary depicting actual couples experiencing labor and delivery. The only part I remember clearly is the one in which the woman serenely labored at home in her rocking chair, then strolled over to the hospital to give unmedicated birth with nary a groan. The two other vignettes involved long, hard labors that were clearly not helped any by the magical pain-dulling techniques we'd spent a month learning about.</p>

        <p>NINE years ago, before ''Survivor,'' before ''Big Brother,'' before ''The Real World,'' even, I was introduced to reality programming of the most intimate sort. It was thrilling and disturbing. It made me want to look away. It made me want to look back again. I think it even made me nauseous. But then everything made me nauseous, because I was pregnant. This was the final week of Lamaze class and my spouse and I and our classmates were finally watching the Movie.</p>
        <p>Most Lamaze classes screen a variation of the Movie, a natural childbirth documentary depicting actual couples experiencing labor and delivery. The only part I remember clearly is the one in which the woman serenely labored at home in her rocking chair, then strolled over to the hospital to give unmedicated birth with nary a groan. The two other vignettes involved long, hard labors that were clearly not helped any by the magical pain-dulling techniques we'd spent a month learning about.</p>
        <p>As Lamaze propaganda, the movie was a bust; it was a much better endorsement for the value of an epidural (or for being knocked out cold with a large mallet). And it was seat-squirmingly embarrassing -- you felt sorry for the hard-laboring women and their terrified mates, so vulnerable and exposed in what should be a private moment. I snickered at the dorky intrusiveness of it all. Yet each time a woman gave her final triumphant push and out came a slippery baby, I was surprised by the tears welling up in my eyes. I became, truth be told, a tad verklempt. And I wasn't the only one, judging from the sniffles around me. I chalked it up to hormones, confident it would pass once I was back to my old un-expectant self.</p>
        <p>One afternoon last year, I turned on my TV and stumbled upon a sight that instantly took me back to Lamaze class. There, in my living room, was a woman in labor, with a doctor and nurses urging her to push, a husband at her head telling her to breathe and a half-dozen family members crowded around the foot of the bed watching her (discreetly draped) nether region as if it were a wide-screen TV. O.K., that part was weird. But the rest of the scene was just like the Movie -- right down to the sobby lump in my throat. I had found ''A Baby Story,'' a reality series on cable's Learning Channel that follows expectant couples through the last weeks of pregnancy and into the delivery room. It's like watching a Lamaze movie every day, except that you don't have to do the breathing exercises.</p>
        <p>Since its premiere in late 1998, ''A Baby Story'' has become the Learning Channel's most popular daytime series among adult women, drawing 3.8 million viewers a week. Two consecutive half-hour episodes are broadcast each weekday (beginning at 2 p.m.), sandwiched between ''A Dating Story'' and ''A Wedding Story'' (now there's a chronology that probably gives conservatives fits). A five-hour ''Baby Story'' marathon is scheduled for -- of course -- Labor Day.</p>
        <p>Who the heck watches ''A Baby Story''? I imagine the audience is made up of women like me, years removed from new motherhood, but whose scary, overpowering new-mom instinct never quite got turned all the way back to ''off.'' And it doesn't take much for the floodgates to open. We'd sell our own grandmothers to hold an infant and get a fix of that intoxicating scent known as ''new baby's head.'' Childbirth is a test of a woman's stamina, proof of her body's power. It's an unbelievably heady feeling giving birth, probably akin to winning a marathon (but how many of us ever win a marathon?). ''A Baby Story'' expertly taps that rush of maternal giddiness.</p>
        <p>Hopelessly addictive, ''A Baby Story'' provides an undeniable voyeuristic tingle; not only do you get a peek at one of life's most awesome, intimate spectacles, you get to see how your birthing performance rated in the overall scheme of things. It's like childbirth porn -- complete with unflattering lighting, sometimes muddy sound and decidedly nonprofessional stars. And it's shamelessly formulaic. Each episode of ''A Baby Story'' opens with the expectant couple in their living room talking about how they met, how long they've been together and why they've decided to have this baby. If it's a first baby, the episode features the obligatory ''couple goes shopping'' scene, where the wide-eyed mom- and dad-to-be are played like violins by the baby-goods-store clerk (yes, you must have this electric diaper wipe warmer!). If the couple already have a child, the shopping scene is replaced by one in which the parents tout the joys of big brother or sisterhood to their firstborn.</p>
        <p>Then, halfway through the episode, the drama of labor begins and it's time for the couple to go to the hospital (pausing, of course, to notify the 60 or so relatives and friends they want to take with them). The passing of the hours is quaintly signaled by (I swear) shots of the hospital room clock. The episode's climax -- the mommy shot, if you will -- comes when the determined woman gives one last mighty push (her private parts are blurred in postproduction) and the doctor holds aloft the slick, wiggly bundle. As the new parents cuddle their baby, happy tears glistening on their cheeks, a winsome acoustic guitar tune fills the soundtrack. The music could have been lifted straight from an episode of ''thirtysomething,'' and why not? Both shows are about couples totally absorbed in new parenthood -- as if no one had ever had a baby before them.</p>
        <p>Part of the allure of the new reality programming is its mean-spiritedness; we watch ''Survivor'' and ''Big Brother'' so we can laugh at the obnoxious exhibitionists whose lives are on display. But ''A Baby Story'' is virtually alone among reality series in the dignity it accords its subjects. Oh, I'm not saying you won't chortle at the naivete of some of these couples, fluttering around stocking up on frilly little baby clothes and fancy, useless gadgets. But ''A Baby Story'' is, for the most part, generous and respectful (if that can be said of a show that presents birth as entertainment).</p>
        <p>The producers solicit couples for the show through an announcement at the end of each episode, and through the program's Web page, http://tlc.discovery.com/tlcdaytime /babystory/newkids.html. Oddly, though, these cattle calls have not resulted (on air, anyway) in a circus of shameless Springer-esque attention seekers. No, these appear to be ordinary people who approach the show as an opportunity to create the deluxe version of a keepsake home video.</p>
        <p>What strikes you most about the couples on ''A Baby Story'' is how thoughtful and committed they seem. ''A Baby Story'' presents a variety of parents-to-be -- white, African-American, Latino, Orthodox Jewish, Mormon, blue-collar, yuppie, rural, urban, deaf -- and a panorama of parenting philosophies. My favorite parents-to-be were the Philadelphia couple, both boho artists, who decided to name their soon-to-be-born daughter Liberty, decorated her nursery with Springsteen posters and kitschy Americana and devised a touchingly kooky ''commitment to parenthood'' ceremony in which they invited family and friends to join them for a day at a steam train amusement park to conjure memories of what it felt like to be a kid.</p>
        <p>In one aspect, though, every story on ''A Baby Story'' is the same: all of these babies are wanted. (For those seeking hardcore, depressing childbirth stories, the Learning Channel offers the occasional prime-time reality series ''Maternity Ward,'' a production of New York Times Television, which documents unwed teenagers giving birth in public hospitals -- the fathers of the babies are never there -- and shows us the harrowing medical complications that ''A Baby Story'' leaves out.) Which is not to say that ''A Baby Story'' has an agenda, that it's an advertisement for (take your pick) family planning or the pro-life movement. It's just that it presents childbirth under the best, most hopeful of circumstances.</p>
        <p>I used to wonder if my Lamaze instructor was nuts. A perky mother of three, she attended several births a week, observing the deliveries of friends, family members, students and probably total strangers, too. If you've seen one birth, haven't you seen them all? At the time, I didn't get it, but now I do. ''A Baby Story'' freezes that four-handkerchief moment of perfect joy, when, gazing upon their newborn, parents are filled with gratitude and humility. As any parent knows, the trick is to hold onto those delivery room feelings through the anxiety-filled, exhausting, increasingly complicated years that follow. And that's why ''A Baby Story'' keeps you coming back for more; it makes you remember why you signed on for this in the first place.</p>
