        <p>In design, just as in cooking, Eberhard Mller and Paulette Satur have no patience for pretense. ''A lot of architects we interviewed tried to give us columns and balustrades,'' Satur recalls, deeming such neo-Shingle Style proposals ''too fancy for the North Fork.''</p>

        <p>In design, just as in cooking, Eberhard Mller and Paulette Satur have no patience for pretense. ''A lot of architects we interviewed tried to give us columns and balustrades,'' Satur recalls, deeming such neo-Shingle Style proposals ''too fancy for the North Fork.''</p>
        <p>But there is nothing too fancy about Annabelle Selldorf. True, the German-born, Jil Sander-clad, minimalist-modern architect's sleek spaces and fanatical attention to detail endear her to hotshots in the art world like the painters David Salle and Eric Fischl or the dealers Barbara Gladstone and Michael Werner. But Selldorf believes in self-effacing subtlety and disdains flash and polemics. ''I don't want my work to be about style,'' she explains. ''It's profoundly grounded in necessity.'' Which was part of the draw for Satur and Mller. ''We liked her clean, simple approach,'' says the celebrity chef. ''No fussiness or unnecessary design.''</p>
        <p>And how. The 2,600-square-foot, cedar-sided house that Selldorf designed to overlook the couple's vegetable fields is American Gothic by way of the International Style. Its roof is flat; it sits smack on the ground; and its interior is open and drenched in light. The house's boxy form is broken only by a towerlike volume containing a central stair hall that vents warm air up and out of the house, since its owners hate air-conditioning.</p>
        <p>The interiors are spare and simple, with cherry floors, pale walls and no curtains -- the better to let the light in. The living-dining room alone has six pairs of French doors that open onto the farmland view, and the master bedroom boasts a luxurious three exposures. Other than that, however, the place is almost spartan in its simplicity. ''Eberhard refuses to bend to fashion,'' Satur says. ''The house is like that, too.''</p>
        <p>The architect's and her clients' shared abhorrence of fuss made for speedy completion of the house, just 18 months after their first meeting. ''I could tell Annabelle wasn't going to try to push something past us,'' Mller says of Selldorf, who returns the compliment. ''They're not idle people,'' she observes. ''There was nothing frivolous about this project.''</p>
        <p>Still, Selldorf feels the house's austerity is tempered by its light and warmth. ''It's not sentimental, but it's not brutal,'' she says.</p>
        <p>Not that it could be, given its owners' hospitable bent.</p>
        <p>''My favorite place in the house,'' Mller says, ''is at the head of the dining table on a Saturday night, when I look around at our friends.'' That's plain enough.</p>
