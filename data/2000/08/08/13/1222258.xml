        <p>Although the Hunts Point market in the Bronx is the primary distributor of the fresh produce, fish and meat that ends up on city dining tables, and handles more produce than any other food distribution center in the nation, many of the 16,000 people in the neighborhood have trouble finding fresh food to put on their own tables.</p>
        <p>The wholesale markets, including the Hunts Point Terminal Market, which primarily sells produce, and the Hunts Point Cooperative Market, selling largely meat and fish, are for professional buyers. The average shopper is discouraged.</p>
        <p>To help bring together Hunts Point's residential and commercial sides, a neighborhood organization, the Point, has developed a plan to make some products from the wholesale markets available to local residents at an outdoor farmers market next to the terminal market.</p>
        <p>It is part of a larger project, Rivermart, which would include a waterfront park next to the Bronx River, along Edgewater Road, in an area neglected by the city for years.</p>
        <p>''We can make this place a real destination, demystify the Hunts Point market and set up a kind of showroom for the wholesalers,'' said Paul Lipson, executive director of the Point, which helped neighborhood residents set up a makeshift park in the same area, the point at which Lafayette Avenue leads to the Bronx River.</p>
        <p>The proposal, first conceived in 1998, involves setting up four farmers market kiosks just north of the terminal market and creating small landscaped picnic and recreational areas next to a riverside walkway and a dock and boat launching ramp off Lafayette Avenue.</p>
        <p>The entire plan would involve several acres of vacant city land. For the past two years, the Point sought support for the plan from the local community board, which approved it this year, and has been trying to find vendors interested in setting up stalls in the market.</p>
        <p>Vincent Pacifico, owner of Vista Food Exchange, one of the 43 tenants of the Hunts Point Cooperative Market, said he would participate in the farmers market, noting that there was a built-in customer base for such a project.</p>
        <p>''It is noble idea, and it may work,'' he said. ''What's more important is that we preserve the resources that are available to the community, and it's especially important that we have access to that market.''</p>
        <p>The Point has not yet received the backing of the Hunts Point Terminal Market, which is next to the proposed site. Officials from the market declined to comment.</p>
        <p>But Assemblyman Ruben Diaz Jr., who represents the area, said he thought the proposal was likely to become a reality.</p>
        <p>''I'm sure that within a year the day will come,'' he said, ''when I will be able to buy the freshest cherries, vegetables, dairy and meat right in my area.''</p>
