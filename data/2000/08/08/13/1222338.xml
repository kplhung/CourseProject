        <p>With the federal government's debt shrinking -- politicians differ as to just how much -- the Treasury has been decreasing the size of its quarterly auctions, leading some bond market experts to fear that demand from investors could outstrip the dwindling supply.</p>
        <p>But all went well at last week's auction.</p>
        <p>Demand for Treasury securities has abated, said Jack Albin, chief investment officer for Colonial Asset Management in Jacksonville, Fla., citing two reasons.</p>
        <p>''First, the 30-year bond is no longer the benchmark,'' he said. Anointing the 10-year as the benchmark puts the United States in line with the rest of the world.</p>
        <p>''Secondly, given the improving complexion of the corporate landscape vis-a-vis the stock market, current spreads adequately compensate corporate investors for the additional risk -- credit, liquidity and otherwise.''</p>
        <p>Also, dealers pressured prices lower near the bidding deadline to make the government securities more attractive to investors. ''With government buybacks and the reduction in size of debt issuance,'' said Gerald Lucas, senior government strategist at Merrill Lynch, ''this was the last chance of the year to buy a government 30-year issue.''</p>
        <p>In 1998, the Treasury sold $30 billion in 30-year bonds. In 1999, the figure fell to $20 billion. In 2000, it has sold $15 billion, $5 billion of that on Thursday. At auction, the 30-year bond was priced to yield 5.697 percent; late Friday the yield was 5.70 percent.</p>
        <p>At the start of last week's auction, investors gave a warm welcome to the Treasury's $10 billion of five-year notes. The issue was awarded at a price to yield 6.060 percent, after a government report on Tuesday of a better-than-expected productivity gain in the second quarter and a dip in labor costs, raising optimism that the Federal Reserve Board would refrain from raising rates when the Open Market Committee meets on Aug. 22. The five-year yield was unchanged late Friday.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, the Treasury sold $10 billion of 10-year notes, at a price to yield 5.84 percent. That was down to 5.78 percent on Friday.</p>
        <p>Looking ahead, Theodore Ake, director of fixed-income trading at First Union Capital Markets in Charlotte, N.C., questioned how much further the Treasury market would rally. He put the next resistance level on the long bond at 5.63 percent.</p>
        <p>With a smaller percentage of investment money going into Treasuries than in the past, he said, ''We're no longer the dog wagging the tail -- we're now the tail.''</p>
