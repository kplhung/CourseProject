        <p>Call it the Harlem Bible Belt.</p>
        <p>Each summer, two churches raise sprawling white tents in vacant lots on Frederick Douglass Boulevard, and almost every night for about six weeks, set up loudspeakers to summon God with preaching, shouting, foot-stamping and singing.</p>
        <p>Summer revival meetings have taken place in Harlem since the 1920's, when large numbers of blacks first started moving to the neighborhood. The meetings continued through the 70's and 80's, when many buildings along the boulevard were abandoned and burned. And they return each summer, as the boulevard undergoes something of a real-estate boom.</p>
        <p>In the past, most people, even those who did not care for evangelism, simply regarded the gatherings as part of Harlem, like the vendors who sell radical literature along 125th Street.</p>
        <p>So perhaps it was a measure of how much the area has changed in recent years that the police and the Mayor's Quality of Life Task Force have received several complaints this summer about the whooping, yelling and sermonizing.</p>
        <p>In the last two weeks, the 28th Precinct in Harlem has been called twice to address noise complaints on Frederick Douglass Boulevard, said Detective Walter L. Burns, a police spokesman. Both times, he said, the police spoke with the church ministers who, he said, ''were very willing to calm things down.''</p>
        <p>C. A. Murray, a spokesman for the Northeastern Conference of Seventh-day Adventists, which has held revivals in Harlem for eight decades, said: ''We have never tried to disturb a community, and we come in to help a community. So if that means turning the volume down, we'll do that.''</p>
        <p>But Carlos Vargas, who has lived in the neighborhood for two years, said he had seen the police ask ministers to lower the volume, but ''they ignore the requests.''</p>
        <p>''The volume of the music or the speeches or the sermons never goes down,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Stanley Gleaton, chairman of Community Board 10 in central Harlem, said he was surprised at the requests. ''Usually we don't get complaints,'' he said. ''It could be the influx of new residents coming into the community. Maybe it's just a touchy period.''</p>
        <p>A new congregation of the Seventh-day Adventists, Dimensions of Hope, set up on Frederick Douglass Boulevard at 117th Street for its evangelical crusade for the first time this year. About 175 people attend on weekday nights, and as many as 350 gather on the weekends, Mr. Murray said.</p>
        <p>At Frederick Douglass Boulevard and 119th Street, the Salvation and Deliverance Church of Harlem has another tent. Officials from that church did not respond to requests for comment. Both congregations have permits from the city.</p>
