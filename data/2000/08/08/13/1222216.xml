        <p>Re: ''Cold Spring Harbor Finds Land for Park'' [July 23], I must respond to the assertion that state officials ''found out purely by accident that the property was already state-owned,'' and ''park officials are now combing the maps looking for more.''</p>
        <p>I have had numerous discussions over the past four years with state officials about problems relating to illegal dumping and encroachments on this parcel. They have met with me on the property, taken photographs and written memos about what they saw.</p>

        <p>We've also spoken about extending state park designation to the entire Greenbelt Trail north of Bethpage State Park, utilizing the right of way for the unbuilt Bethpage State Parkway. This would create an 11-mile linear state park along the trail.</p>
        <p>So if the Parks Commissioner is seriously on a treasure hunt for more land, she won't have to search very hard.</p>
