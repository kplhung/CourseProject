        <p>CRUISE  Floating Feng Shui</p>
        <p>The principles of feng shui, the Asian practice of placing buildings and arranging interior spaces to create balance and harmony, are becoming as commonplace as dim sum. Crystal Cruises has renovated the spa aboard its Crystal Symphony to conform with feng shui tenets, and the Crystal Harmony's spa will get the same treatment later this year. Among the touches on the Symphony that are designed to allow qi (life force) to flow like the tides are Chinese tiles outside beauty rooms and Zen rock gardens in waiting rooms. Call (800) 820-6663.</p>
