        <p>Soriya Daniella Kowalsky, a daughter of Mimi and Seymour Kowalsky of Boca Raton, Fla., is to be married today to Dr. Brad Kenneth Cohen, a son of Debra and Morton Cohen of Dix Hills, N.Y. Rabbi Yakov Saacks will officiate at the Crest Hollow Country Club in Woodbury, N.Y.</p>
        <p>The bride, 28, was until early last year an associate at Feingold &amp; Alpert, a New York law firm. She is now a freelance writer for Israeli magazines and newspapers. She graduated from the State University at Buffalo and cum laude from New York Law School.</p>
        <p>The bridegroom, 30, is an assistant clinical instructor in orthopedic surgery at the State University at Stony Brook, N.Y. He graduated from Williams College and the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine.</p>
        <p>The couple met in February through a Jewish dating Web site. After exchanging e-mail messages for about a week, they agreed to meet for a date of ice skating at Rockefeller Plaza, to be followed by a late-night meal at an Italian restaurant. The evening ended, however, with a search -- at 2:30 a.m. -- through the aisles and storage rooms of a 24-hour supermarket.</p>
        <p>''I was going to change apartments the next day, and he helped me collect boxes,'' Ms. Kowalsky said. She said she was impressed by the last part of the date because ''it showed that he was down to earth and that he could go with the flow.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Cohen was impressed also. Three weeks later, he told Ms. Kowalsky he wanted to marry her. They became officially engaged on April 30.</p>
        <p>Did Ms. Kowalsky consider nine weeks a short time for making a lifelong commitment? ''After you've dated for a number of years,'' she said, ''you know what you are looking for.''</p>
