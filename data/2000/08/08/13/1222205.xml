        <p>YankeeNets, the parent company of the New York Yankees and the New Jersey Nets, has secured the financing to complete its $175 million purchase of the New Jersey Devils hockey team by next Friday. Under the deal, which was first announced in March, Puck Holdings, an affiliate of YankeeNets, will buy the hockey team from John McMullen. A small group of private investors, yet to be completed, will hold stakes in the team. Delays in the deal were caused by new investors having to pass the National Hockey League's background checks, according to a spokeswoman.</p>
