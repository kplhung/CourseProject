        <p>AFTER a sharp run-up, which helped put gasoline back onto front pages in the spring after a long absence, oil prices have subsided and politicians rail no longer about supposed industry gouging.</p>
        <p>Investors seem unshaken in thinking oil prices can only slide further, following the pattern traced after the 1973-74 Arab embargo, the 1979-82 period that included revolution in Iran and the 1991 Persian Gulf war.</p>
        <p>But Charles T. Maxwell, regarded as the dean of Wall Street's oil analysts, contends that things are different now. Mr. Maxwell, with Weeden &amp; Company, made the case on Thursday for his against-the-grain view. Here are excerpts from the conversation.</p>
        <p>Q. You're predicting that oil will average $24 a barrel through 2003 in contrast to a Wall Street consensus that it will return to $18 to $20 within the next year or two. Why?</p>
        <p>A. Excess world capacity, what could quickly be brought into production, has ranged between about 7 and 10 percent over the last 50 years. It reached 18 percent in 1986, when prices collapsed. Today it's around 5 percent, and we need 2 to 2 1/2 percent as a cushion against emergency, such as weather or strikes. So we are as tight now as I have seen in my 44 years studying the industry. It's not political maneuvering by OPEC -- the oil physically isn't there.</p>
        <p>Q. Is this a result of reduced supply or higher demand?</p>
        <p>A. Both. Low prices until recently not only created disincentives to invest, but they've also limited the capital available to invest because earnings collapsed. And then demand rebounded in the Far East and Europe, and we've got unprecedented prosperity in America.</p>
        <p>Q. But profits are now pretty robust, right?</p>
        <p>A. It takes as much as four years from the time a major development project gets approved to the time when oil begins to flow. Besides, national oil companies in Venezuela and elsewhere must compete for budget money, and the Exxon Mobils of the world are sensitive to stockholder values and their own options. Every dollar they put into buying back shares because they're cheap is a dollar that doesn't go into the drill bit.</p>
        <p>Q. Is the tight market what caused the price of gasoline to jump recently, to as much as $2.50 a gallon in the Midwest?</p>
        <p>A. It may have been a modest contributor, but what happened there was basically an environmental issue -- making reformulated gasoline. They brought in supplies from other areas, and the problem quickly dissipated.</p>
        <p>Q. So will the government investigation prove to be fruitless?</p>
        <p>A. No investigation we've had yet has found a conspiracy of the oil companies. I'm not going to say there weren't individual operators or terminals that were gouging.</p>
        <p>Q. If profits are good and you think oil will stay above $20, why are most industry stocks, except for the oil-field service and exploration companies, in the dumps?</p>
        <p>A. Investors have ''learned'' from experience that a high price elicits an investment cycle, which creates an expanded supply, which drops the price quickly and leaves them hanging. And while I think the process this time will be gradual, irregular and stretched out, the business is regarded as more cyclical than 20 years ago, when people saw growth in it.</p>
        <p>As the price of oil holds in the mid-20's, I expect people to realize what good value these stocks are. The stocks have suffered from being ''old economy.''</p>
        <p>Q. Hasn't Chevron, for one, been bragging about becoming a high-tech company?</p>
        <p>A. Let's be serious. They're going to do a little Internet purchasing, but I think it's laughable. When Internet P/E's get low enough, they won't even mention it again.</p>
        <p>Q. Will the industry continue to consolidate?</p>
        <p>A. The game's not over. Chevron probably won't merge, but Texaco is likely, with Royal Dutch the most logical candidate. Conoco, Amerada Hess and Phillips would be perfect for takeover. Phillips, which doubled reserves when it bought ARCO's Alaskan assets, is most appealing, selling for 9 times earnings, compared with 15 1/2 for its peers.</p>
        <p>Q. Do oil companies stand to gain if George W. Bush and Dick Cheney, both of whom worked in the industry, win in November?</p>
        <p>A. When push comes to shove, the parties would make geopolitical decisions about such things as imports and subsidies pretty much the same way. But Bush's would be a looser environmental policy, on offshore drilling, say, than Gore's.</p>
        <p>Q. How did Mr. Cheney do as chairman of Halliburton, whose stock has a P/E of 65 and has jumped 30 percent this year?</p>
        <p>A. I wouldn't call him a brilliant businessman, but he did a workmanlike job organizing the company, putting a face on it and winning business. He certainly met the expectations of the people who put him in.</p>
