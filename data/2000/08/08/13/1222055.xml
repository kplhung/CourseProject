        <p>A FEW nights after Nick Spitzer was ousted from his job as a disc jockey, his friends on the Philadelphia rock station WMMR-FM gave a farewell party. They had listened over the previous two years as Mr. Spitzer had spun Bessie Smith and Merle Haggard during afternoon drive-time, and they knew that the program director had been ridiculing the choices as ''nostalgia music.'' Now, in December 1973, Mr. Spitzer had resigned rather than be consigned to the 2 a.m. shift, when his taste could do little damage to ratings.</p>
        <p>So Mr. Spitzer's girlfriend at the station presented him with a copy of the book ''Country Music, U.S.A.,'' even though she herself preferred British Invasion bands. Another colleague handed him a Sony cassette recorder bought with donations from staff members. For his own part, Mr. Spitzer vowed to his friends, ''I'm going where music is made, not where records are made.''</p>
        <p>More than a quarter-century later, that party looks more like a beginning than an end. Mr. Spitzer's uncompromising passion for American music in all its vast variety has found expression in the nationally syndicated public radio program ''American Routes.'' Part travelogue, part oral history, part musical survey, the show is 100 percent Nick Spitzer, which is to say that in a given two hours each week it might range from Thelonious Monk to Doc Watson to Lauryn Hill, stopping along the way to interview a New York cabbie or a Delta barber, deliberately heedless of categories.</p>
        <p>''You want to enlarge someone's ear,'' Mr. Spitzer said during a recent telephone interview from the ''American Routes'' studio on Royal Street in the French Quarter of New Orleans. ''You want them to listen to the radio and say, 'What's that?' The secret is to be sui generis.'' More deeply, he explains: ''I'm not a multiculturalist. I'm a creolist. I'm drawn to the boundaries where cultures meet and overlap and simmer together. I gravitate to mixed realities.''</p>
        <p>Less than three years after its debut, ''American Routes'' has been picked up by more than 175 stations nationally, including such powerful National Public Radio affiliates as WAMU in Washington, KOPB in Portland, Ore., and KUOW in Seattle. (In New York, WFUV-FM, 90.7, carries the show at 5 p.m. on Sundays.) The music critic Nat Hentoff, writing in The Wall Street Journal, likened ''American Routes'' to an evening spent with the legendary folklorist Alan Lomax.</p>
        <p>Mr. Spitzer has achieved such success against significant odds. Commercial rock radio, eclectic if sometimes amateurish in its early days, has been divided into rigid niches for more than a generation. Many of the college stations that kept alive the free-form style during the 1980's have more recently tied themselves to the Adult Acoustic Alternative format, known in the field as Triple-A, which aims at baby-boomers with folk-rock artists like Shawn Colvin and John Prine. And NPR affiliates have tended to limit themselves to a single style of programming, whether jazz or classical or information. Even syndicated music shows, like ''Afropop'' or the Celtic ''Thistle and Shamrock,'' generally hew to a single identifiable genre.</p>
        <p>''The orthodoxy of ratings thinking,'' said Steve Behrens, editor of Currents, a trade newspaper covering public broadcasting, ''is that you want a constant format so people can know what they'll hear whenever they tune in. If you're not playing what they want, they may not come back. And if they don't come back, they won't become members and financial supporters. So public-radio people are reluctant to split their format. It takes convincing.''</p>
        <p>''American Routes'' has surmounted such wariness partly by dint of Mr. Spitzer's own reputation, built up during a 25-year career as an author, anthropologist, record producer, radio host and music-festival impresario. From its outset, ''American Routes'' has been identified with him in the way that ''This American Life'' is indelibly tied to its creator and host Ira Glass or ''Fresh Air'' is to Terry Gross. And the roots of Mr. Spitzer's sensibility go back well before his professional radio career.</p>
        <p>Now 49, Nick Spitzer grew up in Manhattan and Long Island as the son of a refugee and a rebel -- a German Jewish father fortunate to have come to America for college before the Nazis barred the door, and a blueblood mother whose forebears left their native Virginia as abolitionists. From his father, a trained cellist who worked as a chemist in the United States, Mr. Spitzer received an immersion in Beethoven and Wagner. From his mother, behind the wheel of a '51 Plymouth, he got the scent of adventure.</p>
        <p>''Almost every night, she'd put my brother and me in the car for our 'sleepy-bye ride,' '' he recalled. ''She'd play the radio and we'd see the city. We'd hear the ocean liners tooting on the river. We'd go to Harlem. We'd go down to Greenwich Village and see the Beat crowd. My mother believed all of America is part of what our lives should be.''</p>
        <p>On the radio, meanwhile, Mr. Spitzer heard Mel Allen and Red Barber jawing their way through Yankees games, Cousin Brucie and Murray the K working through the pop charts. ''What I took away was two things,'' he said. ''The visual imagination of radio -- that you could be listening to a game from out west and visualize that ground ball hitting a rock and bounding into left field. And that rock and roll was cracking into the Top 40 and changing my idea of music. In school, you're singing '15 miles on the Erie Canal,' and here's 'I found my thrill on Blueberry Hill.' ''</p>
        <p>During college at the University of Pennsylvania, Mr. Spitzer put his welter of musical interests to use both at the campus radio station, WXPN, and in the folklore department, where he took a course in cowboy songs and did research among the Italian-Americans in South Philadelphia. Even before Mr. Spitzer found and lost the job at WMMR, one of his professors was steering him to the graduate program in folklore at the University of Texas in Austin. There, he steeped himself in the mongrel cultures that to this day fascinate him -- the Mexican, Czech and German mixture in South Texas; the French, African and Caribbean melange of New Orleans and Cajun Louisiana. And he came to realize that he was as estranged from the academy as he was from commercial radio.</p>
        <p>''In the world of folk music, there are hard-core academics who don't want anything contaminating the purity of the songs,'' Mr. Spitzer said. ''They're not open to the idea of cultural mixture and synthesis. They have the idea that everything radiates out from the pure center and the bounds are questionable. But the bounds are where I went.''</p>
        <p>Through the late 1970's he produced a couple of zydeco records, boarded for a while with the fiddler Dewey Balfa and began compiling, on his Sony cassette recorder, what is now a 1,000-hour collection of oral histories. He raised grant money for Louisiana to create a position of state folklorist, to which he was promptly appointed. And when he developed cancer in the mid-1980's, he took Cajun and Afro-Caribbean folk remedies in addition to chemotherapy.</p>
        <p>Along the way, Mr. Spitzer began working with the producer Mary Beth Kirchner on a series of folklore documentaries for Radio Smithsonian. ''From the moment I met him,'' she said, ''I knew there were few people in the country who could assemble music and voices the way he could.'' Mr. Spitzer reported several folklore segments for NPR's ''All Things Considered'' in the early 1990's, and he and Ms. Kirchner developed radio broadcasts from a series of folklore concerts he arranged for Carnegie Hall and Wolf Trap.</p>
        <p>Still, it seemed to Ms. Kirchner that none of those forums had fully captured the Nick Spitzer who had burst into her office back in 1977 rhapsodizing about zydeco music, the Nick Spitzer who could wax for an hour about any record he owned. In early 1997, when his resume was nearly 20 pages long and she had won an Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University Award for producing the radio documentarian Norman Corwin, Ms. Kirchner called him with a dare: ''You've wanted to do a show for 25 years. Maybe now's the time to do it. Otherwise, you'll spend the rest of your life wondering, 'What if?' ''</p>
        <p>The pair applied to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting for a $90,000 grant, enough to prepare three months' worth of weekly shows. The corporation, duly wowed, unilaterally tripled the amount. In November 1997, Mr. Spitzer launched ''American Routes'' on the community station WWOZ in New Orleans with Clarence Bonton Garlow's rendition of that Cajun incitement to revelry, ''Bon Tons Roulet.''</p>
        <p>By early 1998, American Public Radio (since renamed Public Radio International) was syndicating ''American Routes'' to 39 stations. While Ms. Kirchner, as executive producer, wrote the grant applications and pitched the show at public-radio conventions, Mr. Spitzer infused it with his aesthetic. From the beginning, each ''American Routes'' broadcast adopted a particular theme -- daily life in the Delta, for instance, or the legendary highway Route 66 -- and explored it through both music and taped interviews.</p>
        <p>Famously loquacious off the air, Mr. Spitzer speaks on ''American Routes'' mostly through the recordings themselves and his crafty way of structuring a show. Sometimes, as in a segue from Howlin' Wolf to Tom Waits, Mr. Spitzer suggested lines of influence across genres; sometimes he emphasized the disparity in interpretations, playing the original cast recording of ''Old Man River'' from ''Showboat'' right after a version by the jazz saxophonist Gene Ammons. Without being pedantic about it, Mr. Spitzer also enhanced the show with his scholar's knowledge, for instance explaining after Dr. John's cover of ''Junco Partner'' how its syncopation grew out of inmates' work songs at the Angola state prison in Louisiana and was called the ''jailbird beat.'' Several stations that carry ''American Routes'' have been pressing for Mr. Spitzer to spend more time on-mike himself.</p>
        <p>By now, nearing the third anniversary of ''American Routes,'' Mr. Spitzer commands a budget of $500,000 and a full-time staff of five. Though he still consults ''Country Music, U.S.A.'' from time to time, he has retired his Sony cassette recorder to an exhibit in the Louisiana capitol building. But he still ventures out to record interviews, recently speaking with a New Orleans plasterer named Allison (Totie) Montana, who doubles as the Big Chief of a tribe of Mardi Gras Indians. The result, in typically catholic Spitzer fashion, will air on a Labor Day weekend show that also explores the legacy of Woody Guthrie.</p>
        <p>''This is the show I wanted to do when I left Philadelphia,'' Mr. Spitzer said. ''There was no outlet for it then. Finally, I had to build my own.''</p>
