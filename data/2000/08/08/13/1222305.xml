        <p>WHEN Drexel Burnham Lambert filed for bankruptcy in 1990, it was the end of an era in Los Angeles. No other Wall Street firm commanded the attention that Drexel's high-yield bond operation there did as it transformed not only the way that corporate America financed acquisitions but the character of the city as well.</p>
        <p>At the time, many of those who worked at Drexel's offices in Beverly Hills wondered whether they would ever work in such a heady environment again. As things turned out, Drexel alumni are all over -- working on Wall Street, running their own investment firms, even comfortably retired, managing the millions of dollars they were paid more than a decade ago.</p>
        <p>Michael Milken, who masterminded the junk-bond unit, continued to make headlines well after he pleaded guilty in 1990 to violating securities laws and served time in prison. Now Mr. Milken, as a financier-turned-philanthropist, is the chairman of the Milken Institute, which is involved in charities and institutions that finance prostate cancer research and education. He is also the chairman of Knowledge Universe, which invests in Internet concerns; he was a co-founder of the company in 1996.</p>
        <p>Gary Winnick, a former senior vice president, has also received much attention lately. He left Drexel in 1985, before it crashed, to start what later became the Pacific Capital Group, an investment firm in Beverly Hills. More recently, he helped found Global Crossing, an cable telecommunications concern that went public in 1998 and now has an eye-popping market capitalization of $23 billion, making Mr. Winnick a multibillionaire.</p>
        <p>Off Santa Monica Boulevard in Century City, about a mile from Global's headquarters, are the offices of Apollo Management. Apollo was formed by a group of former Drexel executives, and several are still there. John Kissick, Drexel's former head of corporate finance on the West Coast -- and the man who took over as head of the junk-bond department after Milken left -- is now a senior partner at Apollo. So is Antony Ressler, a senior vice president at Drexel who briefly managed the syndication desk, and Leon D. Black, who works at Apollo Advisors in New York.</p>
        <p>Lorraine Spurge, who preceded Mr. Ressler at the syndicate desk, is now a Los Angeles-based adviser for a handful of investment firms and a consultant for, among others, the music producer Quincy Jones.</p>
        <p>Ken Moelis, a managing director, left Drexel in 1990, taking nine associates with him down the street to Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, where he is head of corporate finance. Donaldson's Los Angeles office has succeeded Drexel as the most prominent Wall Street firm in the city today.</p>
        <p>Not all of Mr. Milken's colleagues ended up in Southern California. Peter Ackerman was Mr. Milken's right-hand man, heading the structured finance unit and helping with the recapitalization of Mellon Bank, among other companies. He is now an executive at Rockport Capital, an investment firm based in Washington, making private investments. He is also co-author of a yet-to-be published book called ''A Force More Powerful: A Century of Nonviolent Conflict.''</p>
        <p>Wall Street executives said Warren Trepp, Mr. Milken's chief bond trader, moved to Lake Tahoe at some point and manages his own capital now. Mr. Trepp could not be reached for comment.</p>
        <p>And Dennis B. Levine, the Drexel banker who pleaded guilty to insider trading and started the firm's fall, is now president of the Adasar Group, financial advisers in New York.</p>
        <p>There were, of course, many executives who did not work at Drexel but used its financial muscle and played a part in making it an important player in the 1980's. One of the best-known was Thomas Spiegel, the security-conscious former chief executive of the Columbia Savings and Loan Association, which was a big buyer of Drexel-backed junk bonds. He caught the latest business wave and went to work for MP3.com, the San Diego-based Internet music site, in business development. Mr. Spiegel recently left MP3, but remains a consultant, the company said. Mr. Spiegel did not return phone calls seeking comment.</p>
        <p>Correction:  August 20, 2000, Sunday  An article last Sunday about the career paths of former executives of Drexel Burnham Lambert referred incorrectly to the Milken Institute, where Michael R. Milken, former head of Drexel's junk-bond unit in Los Angeles, is chairman. The institute is an economic research organization; it is not involved in charities. The Milken Family Foundation, which had Mr. Milken as a co-founder in 1982, is a private charitable organization that supports education and medical research; Cap Cure, founded by him in 1993, is a public charity that supports prostate cancer research.</p>
