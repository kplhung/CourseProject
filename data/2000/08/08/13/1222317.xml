        <p>IT'S not quite the Scopes trial, but a raucous Republican state school board primary election in Kansas this month sent a signal about the place of science in 21st century America, and about how quickly the relationship between science and religion is changing.</p>
        <p>In the election, voters defeated those candidates who last year supported removing the mention of evolution from the state science curriculum. The word is expected to be restored after the November school board elections, a significant setback for creationists.</p>
        <p>Evolution won out in Kansas not because people in this conservative, deeply religious state have grown agnostic. Rather, they believe that science, more than ever, is critical to their children's future and the future of their state. These dot-com times demand scientific knowledge and technical expertise, parents believe, and to lack it is to be left behind.</p>
        <p>''There is a realization that we can't have an informed generation if they don't know basic science,'' said Robert Russell, a physicist and minister who is executive director of the Center for Theology and the Natural Sciences, which is affiliated with the Graduate Theological Union in Berkeley, California. ''It's their right, it's their inheritance. Instead of seeing science as an enemy, you see it as a tool.''</p>
        <p>The idea that Kansas would fall behind academically and economically was one of the principal arguments used by evolution proponents in Kansas. Scientists and school board candidates -- even the governor -- said Kansas would seem embarrassingly backward if the new science standards stayed in place. The lieutenant governor, Gary Sherrer, said that businesses considering relocating to Kansas had been ''scared off'' out of  concern that their employees' children would not be getting a good education and that the work force would not be competitive.</p>
        <p>Sue Gamble, who won the primary in a district that includes affluent Kansas City suburbs, said during the campaign that she worried the new science standards could ''put students at a disadvantage on a national level'' and that ''students from out of state won't want to come here and study because they feel the standards won't be up to snuff.''</p>
        <p>Pro-evolution forces also made overtures of inclusiveness to those who wanted to embrace religion and scientific reasoning. Steve Case, a biologist at the University of Kansas and a leader of the drive to restore evolution to the curriculum, said that he and others brought in speakers like Kenneth R. Miller, a Brown University microbiologist and author of ''Finding Darwin's God: A Scientist's Search for Common Ground between God and Evolution.''</p>
        <p>In his talks, Dr. Miller quoted St. Thomas Aquinas, ''who says it's wrong for the religious community to misdescribe how nature works because what it will do is drive people away from religion,'' Mr. Case said. ''That helped clarify for a person in the middle how they could hold a religious view and not have that conflict with science.''</p>
        <p>Accommodation, national polls suggest, is smart politics. A 1999 Gallup poll found that 68 percent of American adults favored teaching both creationism and evolution in public schools. Another poll, released this year by the People for the American Way Foundation, found that while 83 percent supported teaching evolution in schools, almost half of the respondents said that evolution ''is far from being proven scientifically.'' And 68 percent said it was possible to believe in evolution and that God created humans and guided their development.</p>
        <p>''Maybe voters in Kansas didn't see it as an either-or thing,'' said James F. Moore, a professor of theology at Valparaiso University, who also directs the science and religion workshop at the Zygon Center for Science and Religion in Chicago. ''I really do sense that there's a growing trend among common folk to search for how the two areas that are so important to our life can work compatibly together.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Moore sees that desire in the way that major hospitals and research projects like the human genome project now have ethics panels with religious representatives.  And ''in religious communities there is an awareness of how important scientific developments have become,'' Dr. Moore said. ''If we don't know what's going on, and we don't know how to interpret what's going on, how can any religious voices really play a role? We will be left behind and not know what we need to know.''</p>
        <p>That is not to say that the battle between evolution and creationism is over. But the language in which it is fought, especially on the religious right, has changed. Proponents of ''intelligent design,'' for example, assert that the earth is too complex to have been created by random processes. Only some sort of an intelligence could have done it, they say, and they seek to debunk evolution by, for instance, pointing to gaps in the fossil record.</p>
        <p>SUCH arguments, which scientists find specious, have been well received in some quarters. Alabama and Oklahoma, for example, have included disclaimers in biology textbooks that raise questions about the certainty of evolution. Kentucky recently eliminated the word ''evolution'' from its curriculum, substituting the phrase ''change over time.''</p>
        <p>Several other states are debating similar moves. In Arizona and Ohio, bills have been introduced that would require teachers to present evidence for and against evolution, and Mr. Case said he has been contacted by people in Minnesota looking to fend off such a challenge. And dozens of local school boards across the country are considering teaching some form of creationism.</p>
        <p>Phillip E. Johnson, a law professor at the University of California who supports intelligent design, said the Kansas episode would only stiffen the spines of evolution opponents to show ''that the neo-Darwinian sensibility is intellectually vulnerable.''</p>
        <p>Yet, as science continues its inexorable progress, some believe that religion must, ultimately, embrace it.</p>
        <p>''I don't think the church has been good at this,'' said the Rev. Christopher Carlisle, an Episcopal priest who co-directs the God and Science Project at Amherst College. ''I think it has been self-preservationist, and I think the result of that has been we have been losing people and we have less and less to preserve. An awful lot of the future of the church depends upon the church's welcoming these questions and these conversations.''</p>
        <p>IF religion ever accepts science fully, some say, the result may well be better and more nuanced the teaching of evolution.</p>
        <p>Dick Teresi, a science writer and co-leader of the God and Science Project, says that the fanaticism of creationists has made scientists so defensive that they have lost the critical perspective that is the basis of scientific inquiry.</p>
        <p>''Now, you have to believe in evolution as if it were a religion,'' Mr. Teresi said. ''You see evolution being taught in a very teleological way -- this organism is built this way because. This would never happen in physics, where the whole thing is to poke holes in other people's theories. I would teach evolution with all its flaws, and emphasize the randomness. We have to live with the idea that humans are random creatures.''</p>
