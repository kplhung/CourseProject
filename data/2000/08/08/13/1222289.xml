        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Hospital Chain's Critics Call Recovery Incomplete'' (Aug. 6), which looked at the performance of the Tenet Healthcare Corporation:</p>
        <p>As the hospital industry has undergone a remarkable transformation caused by Medicare cuts, managed care and new technology, Tenet has managed to build successful hospital networks in major markets that preserve access to local care for millions of patients. The company has accomplished this as many other hospital operators have suffered huge losses, dozens of hospitals have closed and thousands of workers have been laid off.</p>
        <p>The article contains little of this important context. Much of the article seems drawn from controversy that surrounded Tenet's acquisition of not-for-profit hospitals in Los Angeles, Philadelphia and St. Louis two years ago.</p>
        <p>Certainly, there were concerns raised then by community leaders and others unfamiliar with Tenet about how it would operate these facilities and whether it would continue to provide care for the poor. Yet there was little in the article to suggest how those acquisitions have turned out.</p>
        <p>In 1998, Queen of Angels-Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center in Los Angeles and St. Louis University Hospital in St. Louis joined Tenet in order to meet the tough economic challenges that threatened their future viability. Today, under Tenet ownership, both are stronger than ever. They have added services and, importantly, they have continued to provide the same level of care to the underserved in their communities. The controversy of two years ago has given way to a general recognition that Tenet has strengthened these important health care facilities that otherwise faced an uncertain future.</p>
        <p>Two years ago, Tenet stepped in to rescue a network of venerable hospitals in Philadelphia that was within days of closing down after years of losses. Today, thanks to Tenet and the millions of dollars that it has invested, these local health care assets are very much on the mend.  Recently, in fact, former President Gerald R. Ford was treated for a mild stroke at Tenet's Hahnemann University Hospital -- a facility that might not even still be open if Tenet had not saved it.</p>
        <p>Tenet has achieved its current financial success by investing in its hospitals, making them efficient, emphasizing quality and service, and meeting the needs of the communities that it serves.</p>
