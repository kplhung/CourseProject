        <p>As Antoinette Purcell stepped out the back door of Betances Houses, a public housing development in Mott Haven, she made a sweeping motion with her hand like a television spokesmodel.</p>
        <p>''And this,'' she said, pausing for effect, ''is our wonderful backyard.''</p>
        <p>Her 5-year-old son, Aaron, begged to differ.</p>
        <p>''It's not wonderful,'' he said glumly, then jumped on his new scooter and rode across the dismal concrete courtyard.</p>
        <p>Ms. Purcell, 27, has lived at 400 Brook Avenue near 143rd Street, one of 13 buildings that make up the Betances Houses projects, since she was 7. But she said little had changed in the building, which was built in 1973, since she was a child.</p>
        <p>She remembers that children frequently fell off the castlelike concrete structure in the building's back courtyard, just behind the basketball court, and injured themselves. As a child, she did not worry about it. But now that she is a parent of two small children, Ms. Purcell is concerned, because children are still being injured falling from the structure, which was built as a fountain but has been turned off.</p>
        <p>''Almost every year, someone gets really hurt on it,'' she said. ''Almost every day, someone falls off it. Last year, a child fell, and it made me cry. It rearranged his whole face.''</p>
        <p>Hilda R. Cortes, president of the advisory board for the Betances Houses community center, agreed. ''Everybody's child has fallen there,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Purcell said she and other neighbors had repeatedly complained to the New York City Housing Authority, which owns the development, asking officials either to remove the structure or install padding to make it safer. Ms. Cortes said most of the children who live in the Betances projects, including at least 240 who live in 400 Brook, congregate in the courtyard because many of the buildings in the complex, a hodgepodge of different structures, from single-family homes to looming brick towers, do not have their own courtyards.</p>
        <p>Howard Marder, a spokesman for the housing authority, said the agency had no records of complaints from neighbors about the structure. He said the residents might have complained but had never filed their grievances formally. But he added that if children were jumping off the structure, there was ''not a lot we can do.''</p>
        <p>''It's not a piece of playground equipment, and it's up to parents to monitor what kids are doing,'' he said. ''There's not much we can do about that.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Cortes and Ms. Purcell said they were shocked to hear that the housing authority had no records of the complaints.</p>
        <p>Mr. Marder said officials from the agency's design department would look into the matter. ''They will make a determination if there's a problem how to remedy it,'' he said.</p>
