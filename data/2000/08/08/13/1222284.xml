        <p>AUGUST is the quiet month, the deceptively still month, the month when it seems as if nothing is happening in New York. But in truth a million behind-the-scenes plans are being laid for the season ahead. It is when competitive parents prepare lists of schools to tour after Labor Day, when ambitious actors mail out their resumes for fall auditions, when sophisticated travelers reserve plane tickets for the holidays. It is a month, in other words, to get a leg up.</p>
        <p>And in Gramercy Park, a neighborhood synonymous with advantage, August is the month when the bills go out for yearly maintenance fees and property owners are reminded in writing to renew their keys.</p>
        <p>These are the keys that open stately wrought-iron gates with a quiet click of power and admit entitled users to the park itself, an indescribably lovely two-acre parcel marked by meandering gravel paths, tasteful sculpture and meticulously tended roses. They are the keys that literally separate insiders from outsiders at the city's only private park, the centerpiece of a 19th-century development that has survived populist scrutiny into the 21st century.</p>
        <p>''It's simply a historic anomaly,'' said Sharen Benenson, the chairwoman of the board that governs Gramercy Park and distributes the keys with ritual solemnity.</p>
        <p>The culture of the keys is spelled out in the Gramercy Park indenture, or founding document, an original copy of which lies in a vault at the New-York Historical Society. Drawn up in the 1830's by the prosperous and visionary landowner Samuel Ruggles, the indenture created a trust to oversee the park and the property immediately surrounding it. (Residents or institutions who own the 63 lots around the park are the only ones who are supposed to use it.) The indenture also lists the park's myriad rules, which forbid large parties, playing on the grass and drinking alcohol.</p>
        <p>There are 38 owners of those 63 lots within the historic trust, and each lot is entitled to two keys. That means, for example, that the Brotherhood Synagogue has eight keys. The National Arts Club has four keys, one of which was recently dubbed the Bill Gallo Key in honor of the Daily News cartoonist who had a book party there.</p>
        <p>The keys are numbered, recorded and monitored. Though park admirers routinely telephone one of several neighborhood associations, clubs or co-op boards seeking keys, they are always referred to the trustees and in turn to the trustees' discreet secretary and keeper of the keys, a Gramercy Park resident named Jack Bringmann.</p>
        <p>''We get at least five calls a week asking for keys,'' said Arlene Harrison, president of the 2,000-member Gramercy Park Block Association.</p>
        <p>Security surrounding the keys is so tight that guests of the Gramercy Park Hotel (on six lots with 12 keys) are not allowed to borrow one if they want to use the park, but must ask the concierge to walk them across the street and unlock the gate. With trustees' approval, a trust member may buy a key for $275, an option many apartment-dwellers have exercised because they must borrow a key from the doorman every time they or a nanny take children to the park.</p>
        <p>Guests are allowed but not large crowds, a murky distinction that often aggravates the much-publicized feud between the patrician Ms. Benenson and her neighborhood nemesis, the flamboyant Aldon James. Mr. James, the National Arts Club president, says the park outside the club's front door is underused and should be open to the public. Steven Leitner, a trustee who is an ally of Mr. James, has suggested that keys be sold to people outside the trust, much like gym memberships, as another source of revenue for park maintenance.</p>
        <p>''There are a lot of wealthy people today who would be willing to pay $500 a year for the use of the park,'' Mr. Leitner said.</p>
        <p>He noted that a person needs a key not only to enter the locked park but also to leave it. Several years ago, he recalled, a young woman innocently followed a key holder into the park and then became trapped after dark. Mr. Leitner, who lives in the National Arts Club's residential section, said he ran down to the park in his pajamas in response to her screams to find a panic-stricken tourist from the Midwest.</p>
        <p>''I'm never coming back to New York City,'' she told him. ''They lock you in the parks at night!''</p>
        <p>The keys have been made by Warshaw Hardware on Third Avenue near 21st Street for as long as anyone can remember. They are designed to be hard to duplicate, according to Edward Warshaw, the third-generation proprietor. (The hardware is made in Europe, but Mr. Warshaw would not be more specific about where, lest overeager New Yorkers seek the exact location on the Internet.)</p>
        <p>Only a few stores throughout the country get the original key from its foreign maker, said Mr. Warshaw, who works withh his father, Richard Warshaw. Edward Warshaw said they make about 350 new keys each fall and change the locks every Oct. 1.</p>
        <p>''People are always trying to make copies of them,'' Mr. Warshaw said. ''But I know which keys are for the park and I say, 'Sorry, I only make them for the trustees.' Sometimes, people have lied, saying: 'This is a key for my office. Can you please make a copy?' But of course I recognize the key.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Warshaw deals with Mr. Bringmann, who drops off the yearly purchase order and hand-delivers the results. Mr. Bringmann refused to be interviewed. ''I have nothing to say on the matter,'' he said. ''I just want to do my job and forget about it.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Benenson and the third trustee, Arthur Abbey, a lawyer, acknowledged that a dozen or so people who live ''off the park'' and are not trust members have keys, albeit at a slightly higher price of $300 each. Almost all received keys years ago, often as a reward for volunteer work, and have been allowed into the circle out of respect for their age or their community service.</p>
        <p>One outsider who could easily use the park if he wanted to is Mr. Warshaw. But he is too busy and unwilling to exploit his connection. As for the Warshaw family, they live outside Manhattan.</p>
        <p>''My kids need trees,'' Mr. Warshaw said, ''and not the ones behind the gates.''</p>
