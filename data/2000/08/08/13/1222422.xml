        <p>A deranged man barricaded in his Brooklyn home with a small arsenal of weapons wounded a police officer with a shotgun blast yesterday afternoon and, after a tense six-hour siege with surrounding police sharpshooters, was killed in a backyard gun battle that left two more officers wounded last night, the police said.</p>
        <p>On a day that illustrated again the perils of confrontations with armed, emotionally disturbed people, the police mounted a cordon around the gunman's house at 16 Parkway Court, just off Ocean Parkway in Gravesend, evacuated the neighborhood to prevent civilian casualties and used robot TV cameras, bulletproof shields and nonviolent tactics trying to defuse a dangerous situation.</p>
        <p>But the gunman, Arthur Alalouf, 47, who, the police said, had threatened to kill his family and any police officers who showed up at his home -- and, indeed, shot the first officer he saw -- refused to surrender and, as darkness fell, slipped out into his backyard and hid in the house of a neighbor who had been evacuated.</p>
        <p>Unable to establish contact with the gunman, the police, meantime, had sent first a camera-equipped robot and then several officers into his home. A room-by-room search turned up no one. But a search of the neighborhood uncovered him in a basement.</p>
        <p>The authorities said he opened fire as the officers entered the basement, then climbed out a window and continued the gun battle in a backyard. When the smoke cleared shortly after 8 p.m., Mr. Alalouf was dead and two more officers had been shot, one of them in the face, and six others had been injured.</p>
        <p>All were taken to Kings County Hospital Center. The officer shot in the face was in critical condition, the other wounded officers were serious but stable, and six others were treated for injuries ranging from pellet graze wounds and cuts to bruises and bites inflicted by the gunmen's four dogs.</p>
        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who went to the hospital twice for news conferences, called the officers heroes of the first order. ''I don't believe any emergency services in the country could have done any better,'' he said. ''This is one of the times in which you recognize that our emergency services in New York City are the best in the world. Today, a number of them put their lives at risk with tremendous professionalism and tremendous restraint.''</p>
        <p>Little was known about the gunman. The police and Mayor Giuliani said that he had been a correction officer from 1982 to 1984, but it was not clear why he had left city service or what he had done in recent years, though he had lived with his parents and a sister. He had no criminal record, the police said, but it was unclear if he had a history of mental illness.</p>
        <p>The day's tragic drama began, the police said, when Mr. Alalouf's mother and sister, whose names were not released, went to the 61st Precinct station house and told Sgt. Janet Velez that he was apparently emotionally distraught, and was armed and dangerous.</p>
        <p>The police quoted the mother and sister as saying that Mr. Alalouf on Friday had purchased several weapons, and was in possession of a rifle, a shotgun and two handguns. He also had made a series of threats: to burn down the house, to kill his parents and sister if they did not leave immediately, and, if they went to the police, to kill any officers they brought back.</p>
        <p>Dealing with emotionally disturbed people is one of the most difficult and dangerous tasks of police officers. While there have been tragic confrontations in the past, including fatalities, police officials say the vast majority of encounters are handled carefully and without harm to anyone.</p>
        <p>Emergency service units with special training, tactics and equipment are deployed, and, according to an account provided by the police and the mayor, dozens of officers were sent to the Alalouf home, situated on a short quiet street just off Ocean Parkway a mile north of the beach at Coney Island.</p>
        <p>Officers Gregory John and Patrick Coleman were among the first on the scene. As they and other officers approached to take up positions near the house at 1:45 p.m., Mr. Alalouf opened fire from a first floor window. While other officers took cover behind vehicles in the street, Officers John and Coleman ran up closer to the house.</p>
        <p>Mr. Alalouf, meantime, went up to the second floor and, from an open window, fired his shotgun down at Officer John, 32, who was struck in the left shoulder and knocked backward onto the ground. Some of the pellets also struck his upper left side, but two bulletproof vests apparently saved his life, the police said.</p>
        <p>Despite his wounds, Officer John, still prone, joined other officers in returning the gunfire, which forced the gunman to retreat from the window. Seizing the moment, Officer Coleman dragged Officer John to safety behind the cover of a police van. About a dozen more shots were fired in the exchange, but no one else was hit, the police said.</p>
        <p>As the siege began and Officer John was rushed to Kings County Hospital, reinforcements were called and hundreds of officers set up a ring of firepower behind vehicles and nearby houses. They also halted traffic and evacuated scores of homes for two blocks in all directions, and police negotiators began attempts to make contact with the gunman.</p>
        <p>But the telephone inside went unanswered and by early evening the police had been unable to contact the gunman. There also had been no gunfire beyond the initial exchanges, and sometime after 7 p.m. the police decided to send in a robot equipped with a television camera. A battering ram was used to knock down the locked front door. The robot searched the two-story yellow house room by room, but detected no one.</p>
        <p>Entering cautiously at about 8 p.m., police officers also searched the house and found no one. The gunman had by then slipped out, crossed the backyards and hidden in the basement of a nearby house at 523 Avenue Y.</p>
        <p>The police next searched the evacuated neighborhood, going from house to house in teams. At 8:08 p.m., a half-dozen officers entered the basement of 523 Avenue Y, and were fired upon by the gunman. Officer Jose Guerra, 33, was hit in the left cheek, right eye and chest with buckshot.</p>
        <p>Other officers returned fire, but missed the assailant in the darkness. As they retreated toward a door, the gunman climbed out a window and made his way into the backyard. More officers, then making their way alongside the house, spotted him and another gunfight erupted.</p>
        <p>The officers beside the house dropped to the ground, according to Albert Castricone, 43, who lives across the street and was videotaping the confrontation. ''They went down like bowling pins,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Witnesses told of dozens of shots -- flashes and what sounded like bursts of automatic gunfire ringing in a neighborhood that, on a Saturday night, normally sees people sitting quietly in yards and on stoops. When it was over, Mr. Alalouf lay dead in the backyard. Officers Guerra and Joseph Ocasio, who had been shot in the leg, were carried out by comrades. They and the six other injured officers were taken away in three ambulances.</p>
        <p>Officer Guerra, a 10-year veteran of the force, was in critical condition but doctors said his injuries were not life-threatening. Officers John and Ocasio were in serious but stable condition at the hospital.</p>
        <p>Mayor Giuliani said the assailant had been extremely dangerous. ''This is a man obviously who could have done tremendous damage,'' he said. ''By confronting him, returning fire, driving him back into the house, the officers saved lives. They should receive a lot of credit for this.''</p>
        <p>Officer John, who lives in Baldwin, N.Y., with his wife, Karen, and daughters Briana, 7, and Jada, 3, is the son of Milton John, a retired police officer, and two of his brothers, Anthony, 36, and Douglas, 34, are both police officers.</p>
