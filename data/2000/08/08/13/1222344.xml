        <p>Psychologists have long assumed that while people in Beijing might ponder different topics than those in Oklahoma City, their ways of gathering information and making sense of the world were indistinguishable.</p>
        <p>New research, however, indicates that people from different cultures may in fact think differently.</p>
        <p>In laboratory studies comparing East Asians and Americans, Dr. Richard Nisbett, a professor of psychology at the University of Michigan, and his colleagues uncovered two separate thinking styles. The Asians tended to be more ''holistic,'' showing greater attention to context, a tolerance for contradiction, and less dependence on logic. Westerners were more ''analytic,'' avoiding contradiction, focusing on objects removed from their context, and more reliant on logic.</p>
        <p>Asked to describe an animated underwater scene, for example, Asians were more likely to describe the background and the relationship between objects. Americans focused immediately on the largest fish.</p>
        <p>Dr. Nisbett's work, because it is systematic and repeatable, may prompt scientists to re-evaluate their notions of what is universal and what is local. Dr. Susan Andersen is a professor of psychology at New York University and an associate editor of the journal Psychological Review, which will publish a theoretical paper by Dr. Nisbett and his colleagues. She said the research ''turns on its head a great deal of the science that many of us have been doing, and so it's sort of scary and thrilling at the same time.''</p>
