        <p>Until last month's United States Olympic track-and-field trials, Joe Clark was perhaps better known as the principal at Eastside High School in Paterson, N.J., portrayed by Morgan Freeman in ''Lean on Me.'' But now he's also the father of two current Olympians, Hazel Clark, 22, and Joetta Clark Diggs, 37, and the father-in-law of a third, Jearl Miles-Clark, 33, who took the top three spots in the women's 800 meters at the trials. Yoel Judah is the father of seven boxing sons, including the I.B.F. world champion junior welterweight Zab Judah, 22, who recently made his second title defense. Here, Clark and Judah discuss what goes into being a good ''Little League'' parent.</p>
        <p>Clark: Up to 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, around that age, I do feel sincerely that most of what kids do should be exploratory, as opposed to parents dictating or demanding that they go into sports that they might ultimately have no real interest in. I made sure that I exposed all three of my children to many different athletic experiences. They were involved in tennis and golf and karate -- my son was a black belt -- and bowling and track and field. Every conceivable athletic encounter I made sure they were exposed to, and they made a decision based upon their interests to pick a sport they thought they could excel in. And it happened to have been track.</p>

        <p>Clark: Up to 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, around that age, I do feel sincerely that most of what kids do should be exploratory, as opposed to parents dictating or demanding that they go into sports that they might ultimately have no real interest in. I made sure that I exposed all three of my children to many different athletic experiences.

And it happened to have been track.</p>
        <p>Judah: I put mine in the gym at 6, 7. I never really pushed them into boxing. I had them in karate. But I took them to the boxing gym one day, and yo -- they took to it naturally. They jumped into the ring and put the gloves on. Me being so much in martial arts, I wanted them to go into the arts first, but they took to boxing so great that I just left it. My whole thing was that I was living in Bedford-Stuyvesant in Brooklyn and I wanted to make sure that when they came home from school while I was working, they wouldn't be in the streets. So the gym was safe for them, and at the same time they were learning. But we can only take it so far. After a while you back off and let them do their own thing and then they take it to another level. Maybe it's in the genes; I don't know.  Clark: I agree. Much of what a person accomplishes athletically or academically is often natural talent. But you must be dedicated and committed to taking your gift to the ultimate level, which means training, exposure, ad infinitum.  Judah: I think it runs in the family. My uncle was Johnny Saxton, two-time welterweight champion of the world. So when I grew up, I was a three-time world-champion kick-boxer. Zab just ran with it.  Clark: My girls reflect my perseverance, my pertinacity. I do believe that with ability and persistence, there is very little that you cannot achieve. So I am happy that they have a solid, good ethic that was inculcated in them early on that will serve as a vehicle to help them be good, solid people in a highly complex society.  Judah: I bet all your kids have different personalities. There's not two of my sons that are the same. And as a parent, I have to deal and cope with each one individually. How about your daughters?  Clark: They are vastly different, and they can be competitive. A lot of things go into it. And you just have to be on top of it. If you're not, you can very easily discourage them.  Judah: You've just got to roll with it. I never chose my sons' careers for them. This is what Zab wants to do, and the proof? He's very good. People always say, ''How do you watch your son go into the ring and get beat up?'' I say: ''I don't. Watch him. Watch how long he lasts and how sharp he is.'' If my son was getting punched all in the head and getting beat up, I'd pull him out so quick. But he very seldom gets hit because I spent two, three years just working with him on defense.  Clark: I don't get nervous anymore because I've been watching them run for years. The only thing that ever concerns me is their physical conditioning, that they put the road work and the mileage in, that they've eaten and they've slept properly. I think a lot of people don't understand that athletes at the levels that my daughters and your sons have reached require an unswerving, complete commitment.  Judah: And when they don't want to compete anymore, that's it. You don't push them. If my sons tell me tomorrow that they don't want to box, it's over. It's not like I'm depending on them for a life or a career. If I see them taking too many punches or they're not running anymore or doing the things they got to do to keep them at their status, then it's time to get out.  Clark: I would have no apprehension whatsoever if I am told by either one of them: ''Dad, I've had enough. I want to try something else.'' Then to insist upon them remaining in that sport would be detrimental to them and ultimately to me.  Judah: We're not strict and rigid. We're guys with good hearts, and we made it good for our kids.  Clark: It is so important that men become more involved with their children so that their children, when they get on TV, will have the inclination to say, ''Hi, Dad!''  Judah: I'm a single father. Their mother left, and I raised them with some help from my mother. This Saturday, my son was on Showtime doing commentary for a fight, and all through the fight he was talking about me, saying, ''Me and my father do this'' and ''Me and my father do that.'' And it felt great. That's the reward. I'm sure when your kids win a meet and you know they played by the rules and they were disciplined and they played like a team -- you feel like hitting the ceiling.  Clark: Absolutely. I guess the big thing I get from you, and it's applicable to myself also, is that so very often American black men have been labeled as not being committed to their children and family structure. So when I see anyone like you supporting their children, it makes my heart palpitate with glee, because in many instances, that defies the general notion.</p>
