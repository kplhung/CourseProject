        <p>THIS is a plea on behalf of ethos, the set of cultural values that underlies the forms of artistic expression -- or eidos, if you'll excuse the Sunday morning anthropology lesson I'm about to foist on you.

        <p>Decisions are now being made about a cluster of major civic projects that, between them, will exercise an unprecedented impact on the immediate and long-range future of New York. All the projects have an important role to play in meeting the fundamental challenge faced by New York and other aging urban centers: the transition from the industrial city of the 19th century to the cultural matrix of the 21st. The projects are on different scales, and each calls for a different eidos -- a distinctive formal response. But the ethos that should shape these responses is the same: sense of place; historical awareness; an educated view of where history is going; and a receptive state of mind.</p>

        <p>THIS is a plea on behalf of ethos, the set of cultural values that underlies the forms of artistic expression -- or eidos, if you'll excuse the Sunday morning anthropology lesson I'm about to foist on you. The ethos of ancient Egypt, for example, was theocratic hierarchy. Its eidos was the pyramid. Nice forms, pyramids. Not so nice, the beliefs that gave rise to them. But it's enlightening to know about the beliefs nonetheless.</p>
        <p>Decisions are now being made about a cluster of major civic projects that, between them, will exercise an unprecedented impact on the immediate and long-range future of New York. All the projects have an important role to play in meeting the fundamental challenge faced by New York and other aging urban centers: the transition from the industrial city of the 19th century to the cultural matrix of the 21st. The projects are on different scales, and each calls for a different eidos -- a distinctive formal response. But the ethos that should shape these responses is the same: sense of place; historical awareness; an educated view of where history is going; and a receptive state of mind.</p>
        <p>As of this writing, decisions are imminent on two contested Manhattan sites. They are 2 Columbus Circle, the midtown site now occupied by Edward Durell Stone's Venetian-style campanile, originally designed for Huntington Hartford's Gallery of Modern Art, and the East River waterfront property, just below South Street Seaport, on which the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation proposes to build a museum designed by Frank Gehry. Also in the works are a waterfront park for Brooklyn and a citywide plan designed to attract the 2012 Olympic Games to New York.</p>
        <p>Just last spring, it was possible to predict with some confidence that cultural values, in particular architectural values, would play little part in the outcome of these and other civic projects. Rather, the choices would be driven by a combination of economic and political considerations. There was cynical speculation that before heading off to Washington, Rudolph Giuliani (as is often the norm in politics) would directly or indirectly reward his supporters with real estate development plums.</p>
        <p>What has changed, of course, is that the mayor will not be heading to Washington. He will presumably not be leaving City Hall before his term runs out. And, because of the mayor's brush with mortality, he is said to be better disposed than formerly to do the right thing. New Rudy or not, this is as good a time as any to talk about good things, and about some of the bad things that prevent good things from happening in architecture -- that prevent the ethos from taking architectural form.</p>
        <p>Anyone can make a list of bad things. Mine would include the cultural illiteracy of key decision makers, both in city government and in private civic groups; the notion that the new buildings for cultural institutions can be mere boxes for housing cultural functions; the failure to grasp, therefore, that the cultural responsibility of the container is at least as great as the contained. Not least, one must factor in the interlocking wheels of public relations and private dealmaking that join to bestow vaunted cultural status on utterly worthless buildings.</p>
        <p>I want to focus on the Guggenheim project because, of all the plans now pending, it is the eidos that draws most deeply from the New York ethos: the city's open-endedness, its receptivity to change. As such, the project could help shape the standards by which designs for other civic projects should be judged.</p>
        <p>Set aside for the moment the particulars of Gehry's design and the global ambitions of Thomas Krens, the Guggenheim Museum's Napoleonic director. Look instead at the landmark that has commanded the East River waterfront, on the Brooklyn as well as the Manhattan sides, for more than a century. Consider the mental as well as the physical landscapes dominated by the Brooklyn Bridge, the bridge's impact on the imagination of citizens, painters and writers, its metaphoric as well as its functional value.</p>
        <p>Think about Hart Crane, the great lyric poet of 20th-century New York. Crane's opus, ''The Bridge,'' the democratic ideals symbolized by the bridge and the cultural milieu that supported the expression of those ideals -- these are as finely woven into the Guggenheim's site as the cables that support the bridge's roadbed. Come now, do you really want to see this site submerged beneath the platforms of some river-themed upscale floating hotel? (That is the other plan the city is considering.)</p>
        <p>If you live in Brooklyn, you can see the Brooklyn Bridge as Hart Crane thought it should be seen: as a portal from the old world to the new. At once a departure and an approach, the bridge summons up images of things left behind and things as yet untried. It stretches between an ending and a beginning, the familiar and the unknown, hierarchy and equality, ancient customs and freedom from them.</p>
        <p>The skyline of lower Manhattan, which Crane photographed from his window at 110 Columbus Heights, was a vision of possibility. Or, as Whitman phrased it more simply two generations before, ''The shapes arise!'' Together, bridge and skyline were the eidos, the formal expression of ideas the poets put into words.</p>
        <p>This is the background against which the Guggenheim project should be seen. While not conventionally contextual, Gehry's design is acutely responsive in formal terms to the lower Manhattan skyline and the riverfront location. It is a tripartite composition, divided horizontally. The public spaces at the base, including an immense skating rink, extend the river surface inland. The steel cloud above is fashioned from titanium ribbons; within are galleries and a central atrium. The cloud appears to be composed of long strips of reflective river surface that have been loosely wrapped, an unstable mass of creative energy. Above that, a 450-foot tower appears to lean slightly to the north, as if awestruck by the skyline's panache.</p>
        <p>Nobody can claim that this is a background building. To blend in would be alien to its nature. This is due not only to the formal originality of Gehry's design, but also to the idea animating it. That idea, simply put, is that subjective expression has a critical role to play in architecture at this moment of the city's transition from an industrial to a cultural space.</p>
        <p>We are accustomed to subjective treatments of the city in poetry, painting, film, photography, music, fiction and dance. And we bring our own subjectivity to bear when we gaze at the skyline. But we still expect the architects of individual buildings to conform to some imagined objective ideal. Buildings should not be artistic performances. They are not sculpture. They should not be individualistic or, to cite a term that has been misapplied to Gehry, egocentric.</p>
        <p>So-called contextualism is the latest version of this prejudice. It restricts architects to the dictates of external authority -- in this case, the forms and scale of neighboring buildings. It denies them the freedom to reckon creatively with the city as it evolves. As a consequence, it prohibits the city itself from becoming the architect's muse.</p>
        <p>There is a picture of the man who served as Crane's muse during the time he was writing ''The Bridge.'' His name is Emil Opffer. He is shown standing on the roof of 110 Livingston Street, with the bridge in the background. Opferr himself was a bridge. He enabled this deeply introverted, alcoholic poet to engage with the world in a far more direct, physical way than was possible with his writings alone. Opffer was a bridge toward love and the inspiration that comes from it.</p>
        <p>Crane's muse was a merchant seaman, frequently absent, which probably satisfied the poet's need for romantic yearning. And Opferr's roving, maritime life drew the sea into the compass of Crane's mental landscape. It is the sea, not just the East River, that Crane's bridge is always crossing. In 1932, at age 32, Crane drowned himself in its depths.</p>
        <p>This is the real context from which Gehry's design springs. The design denies any inherent distinction between architecture and other forms of cultural expression. That denial is based on a sharp historical awareness of the city at this moment. It is not an expression of ego. It reflects a solid grasp of the role architecture ought to play in the cultural city. It, too, is a bridge, a span between past and future. More than a mere monument to itself, the design recaptures the unfamiliarity that the skyline represented for Crane.</p>
        <p>Cities are productive places. If they can no longer support industrial production, they must throw their weight behind cultural production. They must look beyond the model of cultural consumption toward a more productive set of conditions. If they remain content to package culture as an inventory of select consumer products, their future will be indistinguishable from that of a suburban mall. Gehry's design points the way out of this fate. The fluid line between our inner and outer worlds -- between the objective and the subjective -- is one of the critical cultural issues of our time. The Guggenheim plan frames this issue more concretely than any New York has seen.</p>
        <p>Under Mr. Krens's direction, the Guggenheim has carved out a singular place for itself in the cultural system. The museum's exhibitions are occasions for consumption, but they are also creative productions in their own right. So is the Guggenheim's global network of branches. These are at once centers for culture consumers and components of a larger, creative vision of art as a form of international exchange.</p>
        <p>As I think back on the exhibitions mounted during Mr. Krens's tenure, I am struck by how many of them have taken urbanization as their subtext. For example, the present show, ''1900,'' documents the relationship between industrial and cultural production in the era of the great world's fairs. As such, it offers a prehistory of the present moment. ''The Great Utopia'' and ''The Italian Metamorphosis'' have also provided historical slices that illuminate the contemporary urban condition.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani is said to be a traditionalist. So am I. But New York's most vital tradition is its ethos of change. To represent that enduring ethos, the eidos must change. This is the city's great paradox.</p>
        <p>People should not be asking whether Gehry's design fits into the context of lower Manhattan. They should be asking whether New York's new buildings fit into the urban context that Mr. Krens, among others, has been putting together. That context is now global, but in origin it is local. It is New York's gift to modern times.</p>
        <p>ART/ARCHITECTURE  Correction:  August 20, 2000, Sunday  A picture on Aug. 13, with an article that discussed architectural projects in New York City in relation to the cultural values embodied by the Brooklyn Bridge, was published in error. It showed the poet Hart Crane (not Crane's friend Emil Opffer) standing on the roof of a Brooklyn building where Crane lived. The article also gave two erroneous addresses for the building. It was at 110 Columbia Heights, not 110 Columbus Heights or 110 Livingston Street.</p>
