        <p>ASLEEP</p>
        <p>By Banana Yoshimoto.</p>
        <p>Grove, $21.</p>
        <p>Contrary to its title, this slender volume could stifle the most persistent of yawns. The three novellas in Banana Yoshimoto's new book are slow to start and circuitous in exposition, yet they insinuate themselves in your mind; you're briefly yet utterly consumed. Each story features a woman grappling with loss: in ''Night and Night's Travelers,'' Mari mourns for a lost lover; in ''Love Songs,'' a woman loses a rival for one man's affection; and in the title novella, Terako copes with the death of an intimate friend. Concerned as it is with the limits of consciousness -- with characters who sleep too much or too easily, conflate dreams and reality or become haunted by the past -- the text picks up an ethereal, spare quality that should not be mistaken for simplicity. The frankness of the characters elicits some startlingly tender observations. Terako, whose friend has committed suicide, dates a man whose wife lies in a coma. That loss defines their growing love: ''He dressed me in beautiful clothes, and he liked it when I laughed and cried just a little, very softly. . . . There was something lonely between us, and we protected that ever so carefully in the way we loved each other.'' First published in Japan in 1989, ''Asleep'' examines the numbness and fatigue that often come with pain and transition. It is to Yoshimoto's credit, in this artful translation by Michael Emmerich, that she is able to articulate those physical and emotional states that are more often than not aligned with silence.</p>
