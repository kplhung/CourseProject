        <p>INSIDE our newsroom in St. Petersburg, Fla., is a filing-cabinet drawer emblazoned with a yellow smiley face. We call it the Happy Drawer -- home to the good stuff.</p>
        <p>No, it's not where we keep the Belvedere vodka. We're talking chocolate. Hershey's Kisses, Snickers bars and Reese's peanut butter cups.</p>
        <p>When the chocolate stash runs low, people get cranky. No small problem, considering that there is a correlation between chocolate served and articles produced. The average 1,000-word article might require a handful of Kisses, while a 300-page nonfiction book might mean 27 1/2 pounds of peanut M &amp; M's.</p>
        <p>So what a treat to come across the management tricks of fellow chocolate aficionado Ellen Gordon, the chief executive of Tootsie Roll Industries. At 68, Mrs. Gordon presides over production of 49.5 million Tootsie Rolls and 16 million lollipops a day, generating a net profit margin of 17 percent, far ahead of her competitors at Hershey. She merits a place among the profiles of ''Why the Best Man for the Job Is a Woman'' (Harper Business, $24), by Esther Wachs Book, a former reporter at  Forbes magazine who knows how to put a human face on a business story.</p>
        <p>My eyes tend to cross at most management texts, but this one is different. It's not a generalized, predictable tome on how and why women should become leaders. Ms. Book's book is like a series of comfy chats inside a corporate suite. We hear the voices of the women who have broken into the boys' club.</p>
        <p>It's lonely there, and the statistics are truly pathetic. In 1999, women  held just 12 percent of the senior posts in Fortune 500 companies. And women chief executives are as scarce as pandas. But in broader terms, women still represent power and money -- they control 85 percent of all personal and household spending.</p>
        <p>The profiles offer plenty of lessons.  For starters, these women never forget their roots.</p>
        <p>Marcy Carsey, who developed ''The Cosby Show'' and ''Roseanne,'' then pitched them to the networks, is the daughter of a shipyard worker and a homemaker from Quincy, Mass. A self-described nerd, Ms. Carsey endured the gray, slushy winters by watching television. Clearly, she understands the untapped market of female viewers. ''Roseanne,'' for instance, portrayed the absurdity of everyday life for working moms.</p>
        <p>Ms. Carsey's shows became huge hits: her production company is worth an estimated $1.2 billion and she is now a partner with Oprah Winfrey in Oxygen Media, whose chief executive is Geraldine Laybourne, a former chairwoman of the Nickelodeon cable channel.</p>
        <p>Several of these successful women knew hard and dirty work in their childhood. Rebecca Mark slopped hogs in Missouri; she is now chief executive of Azurix, a global water supplier started by Enron. Her Escada blazer and Ebel watch belie her modest farm roots, but the work ethic has remained. After her hotel was bombed during a visit to Bombay, she worked by candlelight to develop a new power plant for the city of Dabhoi. But that probably wasn't as tough as raising her twins while earning her Harvard M.B.A. with distinction. Just reading about her workweek made me want to take a nap.</p>
        <p>All of these women also demonstrate the importance of establishing confidence at an early age. Researchers have found that self-esteem for many girls plummets at about the age of 13. One survey cited in the book found that 60 percent of girls are happy in elementary school, but that drops to 29 percent in high school. Boys maintained a higher level of self-esteem.</p>
        <p>Sports were important confidence-builders for many of the women, including Meg Whitman, chief executive of eBay, who was a swimmer.</p>
        <p>Along with self-confidence, of course, comes the courage to take chances. Ms. Carsey, for instance, quit a comfortable job at the networks, took out a second mortgage and started her company.</p>
        <p>MANY of the women lead by example and know how to balance work and family. They go to school plays and don't miss birthday parties. That sends a clear message to their colleagues: ''I trust you to get the work done. You don't have to account for every minute of your time.''</p>
        <p>The book has a couple of flaws. First, the editors could have shown us some mercy by deleting every other use of the word ''paradigm.'' A far greater problem is the excessive fawning over unsympathetic characters like Darla D. Moore. The book chronicles Ms. Moore's time at Chemical Bank, where the bankruptcy and reorganization unit she ran earned millions a year before she joined her husband, Richard E. Rainwater, the billionaire investor, as president of his investment firm.</p>
        <p>In her Upper East Side condo, the book says, she displays a floor-to-ceiling oil painting of herself, decked in burgundy taffeta. And the book acknowleges her reputation as a manager who motivates by fear. One of her mantras to employees: ''So, what are you wasting your time on today?''</p>
        <p>But for my money, the single fat paragraph given to Ms. Moore's and Mr. Rainwater's woes in the Columbia/HCA Healthcare scandal falls short. The two were slow to catch on to Richard L. Scott's management problems at the chain, which Mr. Rainwater founded with Mr. Scott.  Eventually, Ms. Moore pushed for Mr. Scott's ouster, but it took a federal investigation into allegations of Medicare fraud to get her attention. Columbia paid hefty penalties in settling the case, and shareholders saw their investment dwindle. But, hey, Ms. Moore wants to be a role model for young M.B.A.'s attending the Darla Moore School of Business, a result of her $25 million contribution to the University of South Carolina. This might not be someone I want my nieces to admire.</p>
        <p>But back to the good stuff -- chocolate. Mrs. Gordon's family has controlled Tootsie Roll for 65-plus years. Her grandfather had sold paper to the company and noticed that management was late in paying its bills. Enter Grandma, who saved a bit of her teacher's pay to buy up Tootsie Roll stock. Other relatives did likewise, and the family bought a controlling interest after the Depression.</p>
        <p>Her father took young Ellen along with him to work, and she wrote a high school essay on how she wanted to become a businesswoman, a laughable notion in that era.</p>
        <p>After college, she and her husband took over the company. She watched General Motors and other American manufacturers lag behind foreign competitors because they failed to invest in new technology. So she invested in high-speed machines and listened to employee feedback.</p>
        <p>''As a manager, you really don't know all the answers,'' she said.</p>
        <p>At meetings, many people may drop by to offer their points of view. ''That's why my chairs have wheels on them,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The company doesn't even track turnover; most employees have been there for more than 20 years.</p>
        <p>PUSHING 70, Mrs. Gordon still gets calls from headhunters with job offers; she rebuffs them. She has no plans to retire but hopes to pass on the Tootsie Roll business someday to one of her daughters or a top manager. ''I love the game,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Must be all that chocolate.</p>
