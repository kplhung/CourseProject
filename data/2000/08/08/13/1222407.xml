        <p>In a dispute over organized labor's future in the New Economy, more than 86,000 workers went on strike against Verizon Communications, the nation's largest local telephone and wireless company. The union wants concessions from Verizon making it easier to organize in the company's fast-growing wireless division. The strike affected 25 million people in 12 Eastern states and Washington, D.C. Verizon was formed by Bell Atlantic's acquisition of the GTE Corporation.</p>
