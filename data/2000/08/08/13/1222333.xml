        <p>A SIMPLE facelift wouldn't have been enough for prunes. This ubiquitous dried fruit, long a favorite of the over-65 generation, needed a name change to create a more youthful image and to appeal to shoppers, especially women, in the 35-to-50 age range.</p>
        <p>''They thought of prunes as something their parents ate,'' said Richard Peterson, executive director of the California Prune Board, noting that prune sales were flat in that younger group. So the board petitioned the Food and Drug Administration for permission to use the term ''dried plums'' as an alternative to prunes on packages of the fruit.</p>

        <p>A SIMPLE facelift wouldn't have been enough for prunes. This ubiquitous dried fruit, long a favorite of the over-65 generation, needed a name change to create a more youthful image and to appeal to shoppers, especially women, in the 35-to-50 age range.</p>
        <p>''They thought of prunes as something their parents ate,'' said Richard Peterson, executive director of the California Prune Board, noting that prune sales were flat in that younger group. So the board petitioned the Food and Drug Administration for permission to use the term ''dried plums'' as an alternative to prunes on packages of the fruit.</p>
        <p>''It's something we've been discussing for years,'' Mr. Peterson said. ''Last year we thought it was time to do it.''</p>
        <p>The project took about a year. Mr. Peterson and some board members first approached the F.D.A. in May 1999, but it was not until he asked Senators Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer, Democrats of California, to lend their support that the request was granted.</p>
        <p>''We had to reassure the agency that consumers would not be confused and that we would educate them,'' Mr. Peterson said. Packers that make the change, which is optional, will use both names on boxes and containers of whole and pitted varieties for two years. They will then have the choice of labeling the fruit as dried plums alone, with no mention of prunes.</p>
        <p>Most packers, including Sunsweet, the big cooperative in Yuba City, Calif., plan to incorporate the new term into their packaging. ''A lot of people don't think of prunes as dried plums, and when you put it to them that way, it's more attractive,'' said Dana Doron, product manager at Sunsweet.</p>
        <p>Mr. Peterson estimated that the cost of the change, including advertising campaigns, in-store sampling and programs promoting the health benefits and convenience of the fruit, would exceed $5 million. Shoppers will probably not see the new labels before fall, he added.</p>
        <p>But they're not touching prune juice. They're leaving its image alone. For the over-65's.</p>
