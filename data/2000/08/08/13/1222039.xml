        <p>James Britton  Nabi Gallery, Route 114, Sag Harbor. Through Aug. 22. (631) 725-2629.</p>
        <p>When Britton first visited Sag Harbor in 1922, the village was, in his words, ''a harbor of refuge'' from the stifling heat and intense professional activity of New York City. For the next four years, he made a home for himself and his family in a residence-cum-studio over the offices of the local newspaper, The Sag Harbor Express. The open rooftop where he often set up his easel is now enclosed and occupied by the Nabi Gallery, where a selection of his landscapes, portraits and wood-block prints is on view.</p>
        <p>This intriguing coincidence enhances the exhibition, for many of the scenes Britton painted are still visible from the gallery's windows. The port itself, the view across Division Street and some of the quaint old buildings remain as evidence of the qualities that attracted him nearly 80 years ago. What appealed to him most, however, was the solitude, now long lost, which he described in his unpublished autobiography. ''No one went to Sag Harbor,'' he wrote in 1935. ''That was as it should be.''</p>
        <p>Britten's small oil sketches soon filled the studio, as he recorded it in a 1925 canvas. Interspersed with the studies of boats, buildings and cloud-dappled skies are a self-portrait propped on a folding stand and a portrait of his wife, Caroline. On the cot, where he napped and listened to his wife playing the piano downstairs, is his trademark red hat, which he wore while recording his impressions of his surroundings.</p>
        <p>Many of the paintings are little more than sketches, capturing the fleeting effects of light and the patterns of clouds in motion. Often using a palette knife to lay in slabs and patches of color, Britten was remarkably subtle in his evocation of atmosphere. He evidently enjoyed concentrating on the sky itself, relegating the land or water to a subsidiary position. In more concrete compositions, like ''The Red Warehouse,'' he used thick impasto to articulate foreground masses. The lively handling of paint animates even the smallest works, which still retain the immediacy of the artist's enthusiasm.</p>
        <p>In contrast to the oils, Britten's woodcuts are bold and stylized. Hoping to make a living as an illustrator, he produced handsome portraits of literary and political figures. Several are on view here, together with one of the original wood blocks bearing a likeness of Abraham Lincoln and a couple of nude studies. The graphic simplicity of these images contrasts sharply with the tonal nuances of the paintings, but in both mediums Britten used reductive means to capture the essence of his subjects.</p>
        <p>Britten moved to back to his native Connecticut in 1926 and died there 10 years later. Although he was an active member of the New York art world during the early part of the 20th century, his reputation dwindled in the years after his death. Now, thanks to the efforts of his granddaughters, his work is finding a new and appreciative audience. Although his paintings are almost diaristic, and in fact correspond closely to his written impressions of daily life, they reach beyond the power of words to capture and communicate a sense of place that transcends nostalgia for a bygone era.</p>
        <p>'Local Color'  Gallery North, 90 North Country Road, Setauket. Through Sept. 24. Hours: (631) 751-2676.</p>
        <p>Among the 36 artists in this large and varied group show, not all are preoccupied with local subject matter, nor is everyone's work colorful in the literal sense. Instead, color runs the gamut from brilliant to subdued, and the term local indicates merely that the artists are all Long Islanders, not that they share a common interest in specific regional locales.</p>
        <p>Take, for example, Pam Nolan's studies of the equinox moon, a poetic subject that transcends geographic distinction. Her scenes are generalized, concentrating on the mysterious aura of the moon itself. The landscape, bathed in darkness, is barely distinguishable, while the dominant moon commands attention. Similarly, but using full daylight to focus the viewer's gaze on the sky, Larry Horowitz's watercolor, ''Boats at Anchor, Setauket,'' is only nominally a picture of sailing craft. The real subject is light, diffused through the moisture-laden atmosphere typical of a coastal environment.</p>
        <p>Light is also a primary preoccupation of Joseph Reboli, who has a special fondness for the warm glow of afternoon sun and the moment, as in ''East End Reflections,'' with its rain-soaked fields mirroring passing clouds, when changeable skies yield dappled effects. The reflections of foliage in rippling streams create fascinating patterns in Pat Ralph's two watercolors, which could have been painted anywhere that branches overhang gently flowing water.</p>
        <p>A pair of small watercolors by Guna Petersons combine fine technique with the sensitive study of landscape details. In ''Cold Spring Harbor,'' a patch of marsh grass in a watery inlet is singled out and lovingly described. Again, it hardly matters that the scene is local, because the artist has removed it from its surroundings and presented it as a beautiful vignette, inherently interesting in its own right. Even Miriam Dougenis's portraits of charming old houses are relatively generic, concentrating on the building masses and the patterns created by light and shadow.</p>
        <p>Laura Westlake's still lifes are indeed colorful, but their tonality is soft and sensuous. Using colored pencil with a stippling technique, she renders with equal finesse the gleaming metal of a pitcher and the delicate skin of a pear. In a more impressionistic vein, Robert Schoeneman's ''Head of the Harbor, Fall'' blurs the details of a particular landscape to emphasize the mood of a calm autumn day. Christian White, on the other hand, prefers intense colors and broad brushwork for beach scenes, which, although equally spontaneous, play down mood in favor of visual impact.</p>
