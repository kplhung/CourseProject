        <p>IT was hot in my room at the Windward Sands Guest House in Grenada, so I walked over to the window to turn on the air-conditioner. In the dim light, I couldn't make sense of the words on the control panel.</p>

        <p>IT was hot in my room at the Windward Sands Guest House in Grenada, so I walked over to the window to turn on the air-conditioner. In the dim light, I couldn't make sense of the words on the control panel.</p>
        <p>Exasperated, I rummaged in my luggage until I found my reading glasses and discovered that it wasn't my eyesight that had failed me. The air-conditioner was a Soviet model, and the controls were printed in Cyrillic.</p>
        <p>I hadn't expected to encounter an artifact of Grenada's past as a revolutionary state allied with Cuba, so soon after my arrival. I'd heard from friends who had visited recently that Grenada had changed a lot since I'd been there 15 years ago, more than a year after the United States invaded the island in October 1983. Roads damaged by shelling had been repaved and widened. And Grenada's famous long white stretch of beach, Grand Anse, boasted many resort hotels that hadn't been there before. There were even two new shopping malls.</p>
        <p>What remained the same, my friends assured me, was Grenada's laid-back small-island pace. If it was easygoing in its winter busy season, I imagined that in late June and early July (when I visited for five days) Grenada would be sound asleep. That sounded good to me. Summer might seem an odd time to think about a Caribbean vacation, but I enjoy being in the islands when the tourists are gone and local life returns to its own rhythm. The season's weather in the Caribbean, with temperatures in the 80's and cool ocean breezes, is often an improvement over New York City's swelter. And hotel prices plummet in the slow season 30 to 40 percent below their winter rates.</p>
        <p>Caribbean summer is slow in every way except one: air travel. I was surprised when I called the Brooklyn agency I normally use for Caribbean trips and discovered that flights from New York to Grenada were heavily booked and that round-trip tickets were selling for $740. I usually count on getting a good deal on a Caribbean ticket from one agency or another that caters to a West Indian clientele. But the agent reminded me that lots of Brooklyn's West Indians go home to visit during the summer, or send their kids to the islands to visit Grandma. What was more, my planned travel time overlapped the dates of St. Vincent's popular carnival -- St. Vincent is the next major island up the Windward chain from Grenada.</p>
        <p>Discouraged, I almost abandoned my plans for a Caribbean summer getaway. But in a last-ditch attempt, I decided to call a couple of airlines directly. That's how I found out that Air Jamaica had entered the competition for the eastern Caribbean market by adding new flights to Barbados from New York and creating an affiliate called EC Express, which currently runs connecting flights on propeller planes to St. Vincent, St. Lucia, Trinidad and Grenada. To wean clients away from the competition, Air Jamaica had lowered its fares. The flights were almost all sold out, but the agent at the airline's office in Brooklyn managed to find me round-trip connections to Grenada on the days that I wanted for $599.</p>
        <p>I left New York with a sigh of relief on a late June day after the thermometer had been in the high 80's, and the air had been clinging to my skin like a coat of grease. About six hours later that day a taxi deposited me on the doorstep of the Windward Sands Guest House in the middle of a torrential tropical downpour.</p>
        <p>I sat at a table on the veranda of the Windward Sands and watched ruefully as the rain fell in windy sheets, shaking the slender branches of an enormous flamboyant tree heavy with orange-red blooms. When you travel to the Caribbean anytime after Easter, you play roulette with the rain. Mountainous Grenada has an interior covered with rain forest, so it gets wetter than other, flatter islands. Sometimes a cloudburst will be followed by days of crisp, clear sunshine. Other times, the rain settles in for a spell. Forget the Weather Channel -- when it comes to Caribbean rain, only the local people know for sure.</p>
        <p>The Windward Sands, which is one of several small guest houses along the main road one block behind the Grand Anse beach, is run by a Grenadian family, the Phillipses. When I arrived, the young son and stepson of the owner, Johnny Phillips, were running the show in his absence. I looked around for one of them, hoping they could answer my climate (and climate-control) questions.</p>
        <p>But they weren't there. The place seemed deserted. Then, suddenly, looking through the screen door to the main house, I spied someone moving around.</p>
        <p>''Excuse me,'' I shouted. ''Do you think that this rain will stop by tomorrow? And can you read Russian?''</p>
        <p>The person stepped out of the shadows. ''I'm afraid I can't help you,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Steve wasn't a Phillips family member -- he was the only other off-season guest in the house. A railway dispatcher from New Jersey, he is a carnival aficionado who for the last 10 years has been traveling to all the West Indian island fetes on his vacations. He'd been to carnivals in Trinidad, Barbados, Guyana and Haiti -- in fact, he reminded me we had actually met briefly four years ago while we were both staying at the Hotel Olaffson in Port-au-Prince. Now he had stopped to tour Grenada for a few days on his way to carnival in St. Vincent.</p>
        <p>We compared notes on our rooms. Steve had a cubicle, without window or air-conditioner, and he was paying $25 for it. My room was larger with two windows, the Soviet A.C., a double mahogany four-poster bed and a little veranda, and it was priced at $35. Both rooms would have benefited from a coat of paint. And in each of our bathrooms (shower, sink, toilet, no tub), the hot water spigot was a decorative rather than functional item. But we agreed that we preferred to stay in West Indian guest houses during our travels rather than in the cookie-cutter tourist hotels that are the next price point up from a place such as the Windward Sands. At a guest house run by a friendly family, you slip more easily into the local stream.</p>
        <p>There is another big advantage to a Caribbean guest house besides lower prices and personal attention. The following morning, Clive, Mr. Phillips's stepson, served me a perfectly turned omelet laced with local herbs, accompanied by great coffee, fresh mangoes and bananas, toast and homemade spice jam. Breakfast is included in the room price at the Windward Sands; dinners cost $15 and must be ordered in advance.</p>
        <p>Clive, his father's kitchen apprentice, was a super cook. Breakfast was so good I asked Clive if he could cook me dinner the following evening, and he said yes. Did I want curried lambi (conch) or stewed Creole chicken?</p>
        <p>Steve joined me at my table on the veranda as I was deciding. He asked if I wanted to join him on an island tour; he'd arranged for a driver and guide for the day.</p>
        <p>I thought about it. The rain had stopped, but the sky looked iffy.</p>
        <p>Private taxis cost $20 an hour in Grenada, a price fixed by the government. Even with the two of us sharing the cost, a tour would be a bit pricey. On the other hand, if I tried to hook up with a less-expensive package tour, I risked not finding one during my stay, since tour operators won't go out unless the bus is full, or nearly so, and there were almost no tourists around. I decided to join Steve -- it wasn't a beach day, and this would be a good way to get oriented on the island.</p>
        <p>Cosmos, our guide, was like a Rastafarian Outward Bound leader; he assured us that he would take us ''deep into the bush.'' We drove for half an hour up the rocky west coast of the island, then cut into the interior on a small side road. ''Concord Falls,'' Cosmos said. ''It's only a 20-minute hike.'' A veteran of several Caribbean waterfall hikes, I had doubts.</p>
        <p>Forty minutes later, the falls nowhere in sight, Steve dropped out when we came to the third river crossing without a bridge. Cosmos bounded across the wet, slick stepping stones expertly; I followed gingerly, lost my footing, and slipped and landed on my backside in the knee-deep water. I stayed put in the stream; the water was cool, the surrounding forest a hissing tangle of thick bamboo, breadfruit, mango and nutmeg trees.</p>
        <p>Grenada is the world's second largest producer of nutmeg, after Indonesia. The ripe fruits looked like pale yellow tennis balls with a flaming red seed in the center, and they littered the forest path. Steve and Cosmos jumped in the water, too. We forgot about the falls.</p>
        <p>By the end of the day, my wallet was about $70 lighter after tipping the driver and Cosmos. But I'd covered about two-thirds of the island, visiting Dougaldston, an old spice processing plantation on the west coast dating from the 1800's, as well as Grenada's main nutmeg processing station in the nearby town of Gouyave, where thousands of sacks of the little brown nuts are aged, sorted and shipped around the world. I'd driven through an enormous lush mountain plantation in the island's interior called Belvidere, where nutmeg trees flourish alongside cocoa, papaya and banana trees, and stopped in Grenville, Grenada's second-largest town, a sleepy port on the east coast with a few 18th-century stone buildings.</p>
        <p>After my grand orientation tour, I felt more confident about getting around the island the way the locals do, by ''bus'' -- red minivans that seat 12 people and ply fixed routes. I learned how to hand my fare to the driver's assistant (usually about 75 cents, more for longer distances) and how to signal when I wanted to stop -- by knocking on the ceiling of the bus sharply with my fist. The drivers would always greet me as I stepped into the bus.</p>
        <p>''Good morning. How are you? First trip to Grenada? Are you enjoying yourself? Good!''</p>
        <p>It felt genuine, not like a P.R. campaign directed at tourists. Soon, I relaxed and took the buses everywhere. I went with Steve to the Grand Etang Forest Reserve, high in the cool, misty mountains. We hiked a nature trail there at high elevation but found the paths too wet, so we caught another bus back to Belvidere and hiked for a few hours on a back road through the lush fruit trees as the afternoon cooled.</p>
        <p>The rain disappeared, and the days turned hot and sunny at last -- perfect beach weather. Still, I found that I preferred exploring the Caribbean splendor of Grenada's lush inland to hanging around on the beach by Grand Anse. It is a picturesque place for strolling, or having a drink in an outdoor bar, but the water is shallow, calm and reefless, not that interesting for swimming or snorkeling.</p>
        <p>Even more than wilderness exploring, I enjoyed lolling around Grenada's capital, St. George's, perhaps the prettiest port town in the Caribbean. Nestled on a steep hillside around a deep, U-shaped harbor, St. George's has changed little in the last hundred years; it still has an abundance of 18th- and 19th-century buildings, many of them red-brick Georgian-style.</p>
        <p>There had been one big improvement in town since my last visit: a transplanted Italian named Alberto Olivetti had opened a waterfront restaurant, the Carenage Cafe. It had outdoor tables, from which I could watch the big wooden cargo boats from Trinidad and Carriacou and St. Vincent in the harbor. A little touch of European ambience in a West Indian landscape, the cafe also had Internet access -- and excellent, thin-crust pizzas. I had one for lunch, then lingered over cappuccino until the sun got hot enough to drive me under cover, back to the Windward Sands for a nap.</p>
        <p>Clive didn't know how to read Cyrillic, but he knew which switches to flip. The air-conditioner shuddered, and I crossed my fingers. But I needn't have worried, for this was a machine that had outlasted the Cold War. I fell asleep dreaming of tropical forests as cool as Siberia.</p>
        <p>The bottom line at the foot of the Windwards</p>
        <p>I spent an average of $67.50 a day on meals, lodging, local transportation and activities during five days and four nights in Grenada. The E.C. (Eastern Caribbean) dollar, Grenada's currency, trades at $2.70 to the U. S. dollar, and all prices here are given in U.S. dollars.</p>
        <p>Shop for deals on air fares. Air Jamaica, which flies direct to Grenada at 7 a.m. Sundays and Thursdays, goes from New York to Barbados on other days, and its affiliate EC Express runs connecting flights from there to Grenada. My round trip, with connections, cost $599. British West Indies and American also fly to Grenada.</p>
        <p>Lodging</p>
        <p>The eight-room Windward Sands Guest House (Post Office Box 1299, Grand Anse, telephone and fax (473) 444-4238, is a typical West Indian, family-run guest house, meaning that it's low on luxury and high on friendliness. My room was one of the nicer rooms in the place, with a double four-poster bed, air-conditioner and bathroom with shower, but no hot water. An excellent, made-to-order hot breakfast was included in my rate of $35, which can climb to $50 in season. Dinners, about $16 including tip, are available on request. Hotels and guest houses in Grenada charge a service tax of 10 percent and a government charge of 8 percent on top of quoted room rates. The Windward Sands is a block from the Grand Anse beach; there's no view.</p>
        <p>Some hotel managers in the Grand Anse beach area are willing to cut their high-season rates considerably. The Gem Holiday Beach Resort, Post Office Box 58, Morne Rouge Bay, (473) 444-4224, fax (473) 444-1189, is a modern two-story hotel with private balconies on Morne Rouge beach, a pretty crescent of sand down the road from Grand Anse. It quoted me a discounted rate of $55 for a non-ocean-view single, a savings of $35 off its winter rate.</p>
        <p>On the road just west of Grenville, the Rainbow Inn, Grand Bras, phone (473) 442-7714, fax (473) 442-5332), a guest house similar to the Windward Sands but with larger, airier rooms, is well situated for exploring Grenada's forested interior. Year-round rates are between $30 and $45, depending on size and amenities of the rooms (all had baths, some had kitchen facilities). No beach nearby.</p>
        <p>Food</p>
        <p>The Windward Sands Guest House is well-known for its excellent kitchen. I had the best West Indian-style meal of my stay there -- curried conch with sides of rice and fresh vegetables. With appetizer and dessert, but not drinks, the bill came to about $16 with tip. A beer costs $2, a rum punch $3.</p>
        <p>The Carenage Cafe (Ottway House, Carenage, St. George's, (473) 440-8701), is run by a friendly Italian immigrant, Alberto Olivetti, who among other things has trained his Grenadian staff to make perfect thin-crust pizzas (about $8 for a medium-size pie). A congenial waterfront hangout, the cafe also has Internet connections and a bar, and has become a local hotspot.</p>
        <p>The Coconut Beach restaurant, Grand Anse beach, (473) 444-4644, is a large wooden pink house on the beach, a five-minute walk from the Windward Sands. The tables are right on the sand, and the standard West Indian chicken and fish entrees are prepared with interesting variations, such as a cream and ginger sauce. The place also makes an excellent rum punch. Entrees are around $16, drinks $2.75. Closed on Tuesdays.</p>
        <p>Activities</p>
        <p>Cosmos Hagley, (473) 444-4780, is an energetic guide who specializes in nature trekking. He took us around for a seven-hour day, with a driver; the price came to $70 apiece for two.</p>
        <p>Grenada is just 21 miles long and 12 miles wide. Once I had the lay of the land, I felt confident about exploring the island on my own. I hopped a local bus, and visited Grand Etang Forest Preserve, in the interior. A round-trip ride between St. George's and Grand Etang costs about $3. A visit to the park's exhibits costs $1; hiking the trails is free. For more serious hiking, a guide is recommended, since the trails are not well marked.</p>
        <p>In Gouyave, on Grenada's west coast, I visited the island's largest nutmeg processing plant. A fee of $1 is charged for a tour guided by one of the plant's employees. The plant is well worth a visit. Telephone: (473) 440-2217.</p>
        <p>Odds and Ends</p>
        <p>A taxi from Point Salines International Airport on the southwest tip of the island to anywhere in Grand Anse costs $10; the prices are government-fixed.</p>
        <p>Grenada charges an exit fee of $19.</p>
        <p>The guidebooks I consulted wrongly said that Grenada didn't have working A.T.M.'s. I was able to extract cash from both a machine along the Carenage, in St. George's, and another at the Scotiabank in the Grand Anse shopping mall.</p>
