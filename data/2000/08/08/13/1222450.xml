        <p>Chipper Jones hit his first home run in 77 at-bats, a two-run shot, and Greg Maddux pitched six and one-third strong innings yesterday as host Atlanta beat Los Angeles, 4-1.</p>
        <p>Jones hit his 25th homer just barely over the right-field fence in the first inning, after Rafael Furcal reached on an error. The reigning National League most valuable player broke out of a 1-for-27 slump -- the worst of his career -- with a go-ahead run-scoring double in a five-run eighth inning in Friday night's 7-2 victory over Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>Jones's first homer since July 18 came off Los Angeles starter Ismael Valdes (2-6) and gave Atlanta a 2-0 lead.</p>
        <p>Maddux (13-6) hadn't won since that July 18 game, an 8-2 victory over Tampa Bay. He had three losses and a no-decision in his four previous starts, despite giving up only nine earned runs in 28 innings. The Braves were shut out twice over that span.</p>
        <p>Maddux gave up seven hits, one run, walked one and struck out five yesterday.</p>
        <p>Kerry Ligtenberg pitched two hitless innings for his 11th save in 12 chances.</p>
        <p>REDS 3, CUBS 0: Jason LaRue homered twice and Ken Griffey Jr. reached 100 runs batted in for the fifth straight season, leading Scott Williamson and visiting Cincinnati over Chicago.</p>
        <p>Williamson pitched seven shutout innings, striking out Sammy Sosa three times in a row.</p>
        <p>The Reds won for the fourth time in five games, and defeated Chicago for the second consecutive day.</p>
        <p>It is only the second time since the All-Star Game break that the Cubs have lost a series and lost two in row.</p>
        <p>Williamson (5-7), who allowed a career-high six runs in his last outing, gave up four hits, including a double to Mark Grace in the sixth. He struck out seven and walked five.</p>
        <p>Relievers Scott Sullivan, Ron Villone and Danny Graves completed the combined five-hitter.</p>
        <p>CARDINALS 2, BREWERS 1: Will Clark drew a two-out, bases-loaded walk from Curtis Leskanic in the 12th inning as visiting St. Louis beat Milwaukee.</p>
        <p>Leskanic (2-3) walked Carlos Hernandez, allowed a single to Placido Polanco and hit Fernando Vina to load the bases.</p>
        <p>He then struck out Craig Paquette and Jim Edmonds, but Leskanic's close full-count pitch to Clark was called a ball by the umpire Phil Cuzzi, who angered both teams with his balls-and-strikes calls.</p>
        <p>Matt Morris (1-3) threw a scoreless 11th inning to get the victory. Mike James pitched a perfect 12th for his second save.</p>
        <p>PHILLIES 3, ASTROS 2: Robert Person pitched seven and one-third strong innings and host Philadelphia beat Houston.</p>
        <p>It was the Phillies' first home victory against Houston in eight games, dating back to Aug. 17, 1998.</p>
        <p>Person (6-4) gave up five hits and one earned run -- all in the first three innings -- en route to his first victory since May 27. In his longest outing since a complete game on May 9, he struck out six and walked three.</p>
        <p>PIRATES 9, DIAMONDBACKS 6: Kevin Young's infield single turned into two runs as third baseman Matt Williams threw wildly in the seventh inning, ending host Pittsburgh's six-game losing streak against Curt Schilling and rallying the Pirates past Arizona.</p>
        <p>Aramis Ramirez hit a grand slam in the eighth off reliever Johnny Ruffin and drove in five runs as the Pirates won for only the third time in 11 games. Arizona has lost eight of 13.</p>
        <p>Schilling (9-7) had been 3-0 since the trade to Arizona and was 9-1 in his last 10 starts against the Pirates before allowing five runs and eight hits in seven innings.</p>
        <p>His last previous loss to Pittsburgh was on July 21, 1997.</p>
        <p>ROCKIES 14, EXPOS 2: Jeff Cirillo went 4 for 6 with a career-high seven R.B.I. and Larry Walker had his fourth four-hit game of the season to lead visiting Colorado over Montreal.</p>
        <p>Colorado had 22 hits off five pitchers and has outscored the Expos, 24-5, in consecutive games.</p>
        <p>Jeffrey Hammonds also had four hits as the Rockies won consecutive road games for just the fourth time this season.</p>
        <p>Masato Yoshii (5-12) allowed both runs and five hits in eight innings, winning for the first time in eight starts since June 29. Yoshii had lost his previous five decisions.</p>
        <p>PADRES 2, MARLINS 1: Eric Owens blooped a single with two outs in the 10th inning to break a scoreless tie and send visiting San Diego past Florida.</p>
        <p>Desi Relaford singled off Antonio Alfonseca with one out in the 10th and moved to second on the pinch-hitter John Mabry's hard-hit ground ball to second, which Luis Castillo initially bobbled before making the play.</p>
        <p>Owens fouled off seven pitches in a 12-pitch at-bat before his pop fly landed just past the outstretched arm of first baseman Derrek Lee.</p>
        <p>Mike Darr followed with a double, scoring Owens for a 2-0 lead.</p>
