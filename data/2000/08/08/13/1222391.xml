        <p>They bought him eight years ago for $4,000 in the hopes that he would be an athletic steeplechase horse. They thought his name was Stuart's Affair. By the time he became a 2-year-old, however, Thomas Voss discovered two things. First, the colt could not jump. Second, he had the wrong horse.</p>
        <p>It turned out the big chestnut was really named John's Call. Somewhere between South Carolina and the trainer's base in Maryland, the wrong horse got on the wrong truck. But John's Call was on the right track here today and splashed home a 9 1/4-length winner in the rain-softened bog at Saratoga in the Grade I Sword Dancer.</p>
        <p>''He could run on broken glass,'' Voss crowed. ''He may be 9 years old, but he doesn't think he's 9.''</p>
        <p>John's Call, who is now a gelding, probably did. He was the oldest horse in the field by three years. With 31 races, he was the most seasoned. His steeplechase experience? Well, he tried it as late as last fall.</p>
        <p>''When does a 9-year-old gelding who was supposed to be a jumper win a Grade I race at a one and a half miles?'' said Douglas Joyce, one of the owners in Trillium Stable, which collected $300,000 for the first-place check, before answering his own question. ''Never.''</p>
        <p>But under Jean-Luc Samyn, John's Call laid in the back of the pack around the first, second and third turns before pulling even in the stretch with Aly's Alley, who had set a leisurely pace in an attempt to steal the swampy race from the front end.</p>
        <p>''I wasn't surprised to be on the lead,'' said Aly's Alley's rider, Robbie Davis, who held on for second place.</p>
        <p>But Samyn had charted his trip around the spongy footing to finish well. He stayed on the rail.</p>
        <p>''I knew the rail was the place to be, and I wouldn't have moved off it for anything,'' he said. ''Once daylight opened up, he just took off and exploded. It was a superb race for a 9-year-old to run. The thing I loved about it was that he was happy to do it. He knew he had won. He was happy galloping back.''</p>
        <p>Even after the field dwindled to eight when two millionaires -- Val's Prince and Honor Glide -- and three other horses were scratched so as not to take on the tricky footing, John's Call, racing as part of the mutuel field with Aly's Alley, was sent off as the fifth choice and rewarded his believers with a generous $16.80 payoff for a $2 bet to win. He ran the mile and a half in 2:32.17.</p>
        <p>One classy horse that stayed in the race experienced all kinds of trouble. Under Kent Desormeaux, the $1 million earner Single Empire never got in gear and chased the top two finishers home in third place. ''It was a big effort on ground on which he is probably not his best,'' the trainer Neil Drysdale said.</p>
        <p>There were valid reasons for the crowd of 24,787 to doubt that the aging John's Call belonged at the top levels of turf racing. Besides his steeplechase attempts, one of which he won here, John's Call had run for as low as a $50,000 claiming price and had never taken on such classy company.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, John's Call had won 13 times, placed 11 times and come in third twice in his 31 starts. He also had an affinity for Saratoga, winning twice and placing second three times in seven attempts.</p>
        <p>Voss understood how confusing John's Call might have looked to the public. He had often been confused himself about the horse. In 1992, the owners bought two horses and sent them to South Carolina to be broken. One was sent to Voss, the other to another trainer. It was not until Stuart's Affair was about to race that Voss noticed his identifying tattoo belonged to John's Call.</p>
        <p>Ever since, however, they have been together. From jumps to flats. From Delaware to Maryland to New York. With a chip in his ankle and months on the farm and in a victorious gallop in a $500,000 race. Seven years in all. So whatever happened to Stuart's Affair?</p>
        <p>''He never ran a race in his life,'' Voss said. ''Isn't that something?''</p>
