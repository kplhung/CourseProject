        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Michael Kimmelman's article about Van Cliburn [''Playing When He Wants, and Remembering,'' July 30] brought back a fine memory of Mr. Cliburn's generosity to American servicemen in 1958 in Heidelberg, Germany.</p>
        <p>He had performed at the Brussels World's Fair and expressed a desire to play for servicemen while he was in Europe. I was visiting friends at the military post in Heidelberg when word arrived that Van Cliburn would perform in the base movie theater in the afternoon.</p>
        <p>Servicemen packed the theater and the aisles to hear him play and talk about what each piece meant to him. Mostly he played Chopin, and the applause he received after each piece was extraordinary. Without hesitation, he played many encores. No one wanted him to stop. This was a very generous gift by our most gifted pianist.</p>
