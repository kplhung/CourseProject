        <p>John Schoen letter on Lisa Belkin's July 23 article on backlash against children questions why childless people should be given free ride on backs of generation they refuse to invest in</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>If childless adults want to eliminate ''subsidies'' like the standard tax deduction for dependents, so be it. It wouldn't be the first time that parents have been cast as a special-interest group. Witness the gutting of local school budgets by taxpayers without children. These days, things like band uniforms and school sports programs that were once financed as a matter of course are now paid for with car washes and bake sales.</p>
        <p>The extension of this logic, of course, is that my kids' tax dollars should be used to pay Social Security and Medicare expenses incurred only by parents. Why should these childless folks get a free ride on the backs of a generation they refuse to invest in?</p>
