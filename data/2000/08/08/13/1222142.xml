        <p>Everyone has Vinca minor (sometimes called periwinkle or myrtle), and those who don't probably should. It covers the ground, acting as a natural mulch, succeeds in shade and hides dying foliage of spring bulbs and ugly ankles of taller plants. On top of that, it requires almost no care.</p>
        <p>Gardeners who shun vinca on the grounds that it is uninteresting should know that there are a fair number of cultivars, and some of them are pretty flashy.</p>

        <p>Blue and Gold has variegated foliage, while Miss Jekyll is a dwarf variety with small white blossoms. Vinca minor florplena Double Purple has, as the name suggest, double purple blossoms. The Golden variety has green and gold variegated leaves and white flowers. You can order these and other cultivars from Oregon Trail Groundcovers, P.O. Box 601, 9080 S. Good Lane, Canby, Ore. 97013; (503) 263-4688; www.galyeannursery.com.</p>
