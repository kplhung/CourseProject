        <p>Wainewright</p>
        <p>The Poisoner</p>
        <p>The Confession of</p>
        <p>Thomas Griffiths Wainewright.</p>
        <p>By Andrew Motion.</p>
        <p>Illustrated. 276 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Alfred A. Knopf. $26.</p>
        <p>Thomas Wainewright doesn't really matter; that has always been his attraction. He is a shadow in the literary London of the early 1800's: fop, charmer, debtor; a minor critic and a painter of legends and incubi in the stolidly diabolical manner of Fuseli. What art never gave him, debts did: a kind of fame. To get money, he became a forger; he planned to commit fraud and he probably did commit murder, at least twice.</p>
        <p>For overheated Romantics -- and for aesthetes who wanted morals entirely subordinated to the question of whether things were done well -- Wainewright was a splendid specimen: a devil who had actually come to dinner, either a great dissembler with a divided self, a man whose crimes could be read in his wicked art, or else, in Swinburne's words, a man ''admirable alike as a painter, a writer and a murderer.'' Wainewright inspired a Bulwer-Lytton novel; he is also in a Dickens story and an essay by Oscar Wilde.</p>
        <p>He was the killer aesthete, enough to shiver the hock and seltzer in the glasses of Victorians who knew that the ''criminal classes'' were quite distinct from cultivated, proper people. He was the Romantic, head full of horrors, who watched his victims die, who studied agony among the leeches and clysters of a penal colony hospital when he was finally transported to Australia. He was the one who went the whole way.</p>
        <p>Times change, and Wainewright has long been shelved, waiting to become serviceable again. But Andrew Motion's ''Wainewright the Poisoner'' is not the grand Romantic biography you might expect, although he takes a brisk interest in the notion that what some critics term Wainewright's ''insanity'' somehow connects ''his life as an artist and his life as a criminal.'' Motion's real subject is in the state of the modern literary exchanges. He has dug up Wainewright in order to discuss the coming Great Biography Crash.</p>
        <p>For months, the chat in London has been of disillusioned biographers, troubled by their craft and newly self-conscious, and of publishers suggesting that biography is no longer the cash cow of our times. Now Motion is not just poet laureate of Britain; he has written distinguished biographies of John Keats and Philip Larkin, and he runs the only creative writing program in Britain that anyone knows by its alumni. Naturally, he needs to make an intervention in the biography debate. But, being a proper writer, he has done so obliquely and in a book.</p>
        <p>This explains a method that looks very curious at first -- a self-serving memoir, Wainewright's supposed confession, broken every few pages by a solid batch of footnotes. Wainewright was a famous liar, and Motion makes him the standard unreliable narrator, so the confession becomes a kind of literary puzzle, which the notes seem to resolve. We're faced at once with a strategic problem: whether to read on navely, page after page, or knowingly, chasing the context and sources of each incident in the notes. The two-finger strategy -- one each in memoir and notes -- seems to work best.</p>
        <p>We aren't allowed for a moment to miss the point: a biographer makes a fiction out of the facts of a life; he deals in records that may or may not be reliable; and he's always contending with the Self or Selves that his subject invented in the process of living. (Capital letters, in biography, sometimes count as argument.) In this book, Motion ''goes public,'' he says, ''about matters that biography normally only implies.'' To do this, he needs a marginal subject.</p>
        <p>It helps that Wainewright survives mostly as a literary artifact; he hardly has a life. But the poisoner turns out to be less amenable than you might think. For a start, he's a consistent liar; he's always covering his tracks. And since he's too self-absorbed to be a good observer, we miss learning much about literary London at a time when rival editors could duel to the death. Then Motion overplays his subject's talent for knowing everybody; he doesn't claim Coleridge for Wainewright's circle, but he does claim Keats, which is odd since he later tells us that ''it is more nearly certain'' that Wainewright ''met Coleridge than Keats.''</p>
        <p>Although Motion assigns himself a task he performs effortlessly, impersonating a hack, this can't hold the reader's attention for very long. We yearn for something madder and more vivid and, awkwardly enough, we find it when Wainewright's own words break into the text -- a bit of a memoir, a plea for mercy in the penal colonies. Hysteria was the man's best register, which doesn't help when Motion sets out to forge the forger. Nor can he dramatize Wainewright's awful deeds because Wainewright always denied them; so the book's drama is confined to the footnotes. The effect is to make Wainewright a creature without autonomy. Often, he forgets what happens to be missing from the record -- even his place of birth -- until he is transported to Australia and the memoir suddenly blossoms with the atmospherics of a dozen other men's accounts. The choice of what to invent and what to leave blank seems deliberately to avoid the questions that are particular to Thomas Wainewright.</p>
        <p>Motion's book works as a neat critique of the worst biographies: all background, populated with pathetic figures who are not allowed to breathe. Indeed, Wainewright can't see a man smoking a pipe without thinking immediately of a steam train -- and not just any steam train; it has to be the famous Rocket that killed a man at the opening of the Liverpool-Manchester line. Wainewright is transported to Australia, and somebody has to shoot an albatross en route. Coleridge is immediately mentioned.</p>
        <p>But although Motion has devised a clever scheme, by the end it has imploded. We don't have a life of Wainewright or a critique of the idea of a life of Wainewright; each one battles the other. The tension between fiction and archives is too obviously being manipulated by the author, not forced on him. We're free to go on thinking that Thomas Wainewright doesn't really matter.</p>
