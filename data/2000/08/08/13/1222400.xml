        <p>THE county's Department of Social Services and the Westchester Arts Council will collaborate on a $50,000 project to bring dance, theater and other arts to people on public assistance.</p>
        <p>Under the program, 25 artist residencies will be created at day care centers and homeless shelters, among others places, to demonstrate how the arts can enhance various social services programs.</p>
        <p>''It has been well documented that the arts can help all people live richer, fuller and more productive lives,'' said Janet T. Langsam, executive director of the arts council.</p>
        <p>She cited a recent three-year study by the federal Department of Justice of at-risk youth in Atlanta, Portland, Ore. and San Antonio. When the youths were introduced to arts programs, the study showed, they performed better in school, had lower dropout rates and fewer instances of delinquent or criminal behavior, and they were able to express themselves and complete tasks more efficiently.</p>
        <p>Integrating the arts into programs for people with mental disabilities, at-risk youth, geriatric populations and other groups has already begun in Westchester, as elsewhere in the United States. The Arts Council and the county's Department of Mental Health, for example, have been working together for several years.</p>
        <p>''The council has been at the forefront of this type of effort,'' Ms. Langsam said, ''sending artists into Head Start programs, after-school programs, community centers, senior centers, mental health facilities and shelters for battered women for many years.''</p>
        <p>The new program with the Department of Social Services will bring similar programs to those on public assistance ''who traditionally have very little access to the arts,'' said Kevin P. Mahon, the county's social services commissioner.</p>
        <p>Social service agencies are increasingly recognizing that ''welfare reform is more than just pushing people to go out and get a job,'' explained Dennis J. Packard, deputy commissioner for the Department of Social Services. ''It involves helping them learn to cope with the stress and challenge of independent survival, to focus on and stay with a task, to build self-esteem, to participate in a group and to communicate with others.''</p>
        <p>The new project grew out of a conference called ''The Arts and Human Services: A Powerful Partnership,'' held in May at the Arts Council's offices in White Plains.</p>
        <p>The United Way of Westchester and Putnam is also a partner in the venture, contributing money to expand arts programs for the agencies on its roster.</p>
        <p>A panel of social service providers and artists will choose artists for the program early next month. For each residency, an artist will conduct 10 sessions at the site. A staff training workshop and planning session will precede each residency.</p>
