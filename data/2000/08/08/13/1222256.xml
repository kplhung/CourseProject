        <p>When Frank Perri opened Buzz-A-Rama 500 in 1965, slot car racing was all the rage in New York City. With 45 other model race car businesses in town, any kid could pretend to be Al Unser or Mario Andretti.</p>

And while slot car aerodynamic technology has changed as drastically as that of modern race cars, Buzz-A-Rama remains almost the same. It still has four racetracks, refurbished in 1990, in the same ramshackle Brooklyn building on Church Avenue in Kensington where it first opened. Customers guide their racers by pushing hand-held trigger controls. And Mr. Perri still stands over the microphone to call the action for the weekly races. He considers 50 people a good crowd.</p>

        <p>When Frank Perri opened Buzz-A-Rama 500 in 1965, slot car racing was all the rage in New York City. With 45 other model race car businesses in town, any kid could pretend to be Al Unser or Mario Andretti.</p>
        <p>Now, 35 years later, Mr. Perri said, his slot car establishment is the only one that has survived. And while slot car aerodynamic technology has changed as drastically as that of modern race cars, Buzz-A-Rama remains almost the same. It still has four racetracks, refurbished in 1990, in the same ramshackle Brooklyn building on Church Avenue in Kensington where it first opened. Customers guide their racers by pushing hand-held trigger controls. And Mr. Perri still stands over the microphone to call the action for the weekly races. He considers 50 people a good crowd.</p>
        <p>Now 64, Mr. Perri marveled at how he was able to stay in business all these years while the competitors with names like Raceway-a-Go-Go and Thunderbird disappeared.</p>
        <p>''This business is cyclical, '' he said. ''It's like a fad. It seems to get hot with a new group of kids every few years.''</p>
        <p>For Mr. Perri, building his own six-inch race cars and watching them hurtle around a track has been a hobby since he was a child. While he believes other entrepreneurs opened shops to ''make a quick buck,'' he opened Buzz-A-Rama as a genuine enthusiast.</p>
        <p>He's the lone employee, supervising children's parties, repairing cars and issuing faux drivers' licenses for members who pass Mr. Perri's driving test: five laps in one minute without skidding off the track. He sells slot cars to customers, encouraging beginners to buy the $45 models. His own handmade all-steel cars can sell for about $500.</p>
        <p>One of the not-so-secret secrets of the business is that many of Mr. Perri's customers are grown men who still like to race their cars. On a recent Sunday, John Driscoll of Bay Ridge wandered around Buzz-A-Rama much the way he did when he first walked in 30 years ago at the age of 14. ''It's always been a place to make friends, and there's not a cutthroat atmosphere,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Perri said racers from 17 states and five countries gathered at his racetrack in 1979 for the slot car equivalent of the Grand Prix.</p>
        <p>When times are slow, Mr. Perri looks for ways to earn extra money; alongside the slot car chassis and motors there are nutritional supplements and vitamins for sale. Anything to stay in business, he said.</p>
        <p>''I've gotten some terrific offers to buy this building,'' he admitted. ''But I'm not ready to hang up my controls just yet. I'm not in this for the dollar.  I'm happy to give kids a hobby and help keep them out of trouble.''</p>
