        <p>VASARI'S life of Michelangelo reports that the artist believed the male body was ''something divine,'' an idea so powerful that for 200 years it was thought appropriate to make nude monuments to Napoleon and Beethoven. For several centuries, artists regarded the male rather than the female nude as the noblest subject they could treat. In the 19th century, when the naked female triumphed decisively over the naked male in art, it turned out to be a pyrrhic victory, with women not so much ennobled as reduced to sex objects.</p>
        <p>The long-term superiority of the male nude in western art depended on classical Greece, where a homosexual preference was openly expressed in vase painting and in literature. Later, though the sexual nature of the female nude was always evident, the homoerotic element of male nudity was seldom explicit or even acknowledged, though it could be implied or inferred. Greece was the source to which artists looked for justification, for compositional types, sometimes for subjects. Greek mythical or historical subjects automatically conferred a certain dignity on artistic enterprises and were the best excuse for male nudity since Adam.</p>
        <p>As it turns out, this held true even for photography. The first photographer to make male nudes popular subjects for both homosexuals and heterosexuals was Baron Wilhelm von Gloeden (1856-1931), an East Prussian aristocrat who worked in Sicily, primarily from 1890 to 1914. Forty-one of his images, most of them of young Italian boys got up like ancient Greeks, are currently on view at Throckmorton Fine Art in midtown Manhattan (through Sept. 9).</p>
        <p>The baron, after he was found to have a lung disorder (probably tuberculosis), moved to Taormina in 1878 for his health. Evidently he left Germany for other reasons, too, being unable to fulfill his sexual fantasies or desires in his native land. He took up photography as a hobby, encouraged by Wilhelm von Pluschow, a distant relative who lived in Naples and also specialized in pictures of young nude men. Germany in the 1880's was still prosecuting men for nude sunbathing, but in Sicily, male children ordinarily went nude on the beach, and most Mediterranean countries tacitly accepted homosexuality as a passing phase in a boy's development.</p>
        <p>Von Gloeden's pictures are fascinating as much for what they reveal about the late 19th century, the history of sexuality, and photography itself as they are for their sometimes beauty and campiness. He created an arcadian past embodied by the local boys dressed up in togas or loincloths or simply their bare skins, with garlands in their hair or laced-up sandals on their feet, carrying Pan pipes or stringed instruments, gazing off at Mount Etna, posing next to amphorae, holding palm leaves, toying with grape clusters. Von Gloeden was an innovator, taking the nude body out of the studio, where it had resided in the 19th century, and photographing it in his private garden or some secluded outdoor spot .</p>
        <p>He created a theatrical idyll, a classical age that had never existed outside the imagination of those who wished it had. This faux-Greek paradise was a place of pastoral grace, eternal youth and budding masculinity.  It was the photographer's fantasy come almost true, enacted by contemporary peasants who must have taken time off from their outdoor labor to play roles in this romance. Von Gloeden paid them for their time before his lens, and their expressions indicate that they trusted him and enjoyed the game.</p>
        <p>Both the past and the pastoral were von Gloeden's inventions. His props were a mix of different periods and his models altogether unlike the delicate young men wooed by athletes in Greek vase painting. One or two of the Sicilian boys have stocky bodies that would not have fit the Greek ideal. Some were even North African, with dark skins. The ancient Greeks, to whom the word barbaric meant ''not Greek'' (it later meant ''not Roman,'' and later still ''not Christian''), presumably would not have found them so attractive.</p>
        <p>Besides, child labor was common in Taormina, and several of the boys, despite the photographer's attempts to cover up the effects of weather and work, have sunburned faces, necks and hands acquired through laboring outdoors in a good deal more clothing than they wore for him. (Taormina was poverty-stricken and threadbare when von Gloeden arrived. He contributed to its improvement, and by the late century, it was a thriving tourist spot.)</p>
        <p>The glory and peculiarity of these pictures is the exacting degree of realism the camera cannot help bestowing. If a boy's ribs show or a shoulder is bony or a bit of fuzz is beginning to grow on his upper lip, photography adds that information to Arcadia. It does not hesitate to point out that none of the models have been circumcised, or that some, though barely into adolescence, have sprouted pubic hair. A dying boy dramatically sprawled on his back on a large rock, in a pose roughly derived from Hellenistic sculpture (but upon whose groin a large bunch of leaves has decorously fallen), is indisputably a real boy who is just as indisputably not dying. As Roland Barthes once wrote, ''The Baron's photographs are at the same time sublime and anatomical.''</p>
        <p>At the turn of the century, von Gloeden's pictures were popular with a wide and educated audience. Well, some were. Others were popular with a more restricted and educated audience of homosexuals. His work was shown in international exhibitions and published in art journals, which doubtless preferred the more discreet images, for von Gloeden's project spoke to the hopes of the time.</p>
        <p>The late 19th century experienced a gathering sense of unease in the face of all the changes brought on by the Industrial Revolution, changes that threatened established ways of life. The dream of a long-gone golden age when life was simpler, calmer and more innocent -- that dream that seems to recur whenever ''progress'' looms and anxiety creeps up on material well being -- had seized the popular imagination. Taormina, von Gloeden and his photographs seemed to incarnate the dream. His studio was a drawing card for tourists; his guest book included the signatures of Oscar Wilde, Eleonora Duse, J. P. Morgan and King Edward VII.</p>
        <p>Of these guests, perhaps only Wilde correctly translated the erotic messages underlying the classical gloss on these photographs. In the century that Michel Foucault said had ''invented'' homosexuality, the coded signs that initiates could recognize were subtly embroidered upon. But today, von Gloeden's photographs do not seem subtle in the least. Nineteenth-century ideas about sexuality were sometimes primitive and hazy, but 19th-century powers of self-deception were highly developed. So was the ability to devise elegant stratagems to legitimize sexual display.</p>
        <p>Classicism covered a multitude of sins while uncovering the body, and it made a habit of doing so throughout the century. In 1863, for example, Alexandre Cabanel painted ''The Birth of Venus'' as a straightforwardly lascivious image of a juicy-fleshed young woman lying on her back on the sea, from which Venus usually rises. Had it hung above a bar, no one would have noticed the painter's artistry, but Cabanel had a high reputation in the academy, and so did his classical subject. Like Cabanel's Venus, von Gloeden's naked peasants fiddling with Pan pipes fulfilled three wishes: for art, for classical tranquillity and for permissible glimpses of desirable bodies.</p>
        <p>They did even more for homosexuals, who could also buy his more starkly naked postcards, which could not be mailed to friends. Around the turn of the century, as homosexual culture gathered force, a few periodicals were established to cater to gay men's tastes; these, too, reproduced some of von Gloeden's photographs.</p>
        <p>Von Gloeden was an artful dodger whose work circumvented the appointed censors. Not only his hybrid classicism but also his artistic bona fides made admirable what would otherwise have been illicit. He borrowed from many masters other than the Greek and had a large following himself.</p>
        <p>As most male nude photographs up to his time had been ''academies'' -- studio studies of mature individuals that were intended for artists and that made no effort at naturalness -- von Gloeden's work was a kind of treasure trove for artists. In his own time, he had an influence on F. Holland Day, Frederick Leighton, Alma Tademas and Maxfield Parish, and after his death on Cecil Beaton, Andy Warhol, Robert Mapplethorpe and Bruce Weber.</p>
        <p>Not bad for a man who might have well been arrested for child pornography in our supposedly more tolerant and certainly less willfully innocent culture. Von Gloeden was interested only in young boys and early adolescents (except in genre pictures of the local population). He photographed some of the same models for years but usually stopped doing so as they reached early manhood. A couple of young children who cannot be much more than 5 or 6 also turn up in his photographs.</p>
        <p>By the turn of the century, Freud had recognized the sexual nature of children, but good citizens would have considered that kind of wisdom mere folly. Under the guise of erudite classicism, the public opted for ignorance, bliss and the promise of eternal youth and all-male company in the shadow of Mount Etna.</p>
