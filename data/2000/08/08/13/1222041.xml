        <p>A FOUNDATION whose enormous real estate portfolio is the unlikely legacy of a onetime cobbler is bringing new life to one of its most prominent assets -- the neglected turn-of-the-century brick buildings in Pioneer Square. The buildings were once hotels, offices and stores built after the Great Fire of 1889 destroyed the wooden buildings and wharves of Seattle's original business district.</p>
        <p>Workers under the strict eye of a preservation board are making upgrades as part of a $70 million restoration of 14 buildings between First and Third Avenues that the Samis Foundation, through its operating arm, the Samis Land Company, is transforming into 68 high-ceilinged loft apartments, 700,000 square feet of retail and office space and a 453-space parking garage.</p>
        <p>The buildings are part of Pioneer Square, a seven-block-long, five-block-wide neighborhood that is home to art galleries, antiques shops, cafes and clubs and within walking distance of downtown high-rises directly to the north.</p>
        <p>All are owned and operated by a foundation created by the late Samuel Israel, which finds itself refurbishing the buildings that its founder had allowed to run down for decades.</p>
        <p>When he died at age 95 in 1994, Mr. Israel left his foundation a portfolio of more than 500 debt-free parcels whose worth has been estimated at more than $100 million, as well as several million dollars in the bank. The foundation's mission is to finance education for Seattle's Jewish children and enhance culture and the environment in Israel.</p>
        <p>His collection comprises one of Washington's largest private commercial-property holdings, including 35 other downtown buildings and prime industrial land by Seattle's Boeing Field airport, timberland in three counties and homes and 1,600 acres of ranch land in eastern Washington.</p>
        <p>''We focused on Pioneer Square initially,''  said William Justen, a major figure in Seattle's real estate industry since the 1970's who was hired in 1996 as managing director of the Samis Land Company, ''because it held the biggest concentration of structures and was where we could most quickly raise revenues. Some buildings had no revenues and so were a financial and tax drain.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Justen said he expects to finish the Pioneer Square work next year. ''These great old brick buildings ooze with charm,'' he said, ''and we're trying to make this the best place to live, work or visit in Seattle.''</p>
        <p>Samuel Israel was born into the Sephardic Jewish community of Rhodes, in the Aegean Sea between Turkey and Greece, in 1899 and immigrated to Seattle in 1919. As a shoemaker, he had a lucrative Army contract to repair boots during World War II, and he put his profits into real estate through the Samis Land Company. He lived like a pauper on a cattle ranch in semi-arid eastern Washington, which reminded him of Israel.</p>
        <p>''Sam felt that owning land for land's sake was a means of security,'' said Rabbi Rob Thoren, the foundation's grants director.  ''He often acquired buildings on a fire-sale basis, really cheap, and never sold anything. He did not believe in owing money, so owned his real estate outright.'' He concentrated on Pioneer Square starting in the 1940's when the district was on the skids because the downtown core had moved northward.</p>
        <p>BUT Mr. Israel gained a reputation as a slum landlord because he refused to repair or improve his buildings, except for the roofs. As a result, rents in Pioneer Square were among the cheapest in the city, attracting mom-and-pop stores and an artist culture.</p>
        <p>''His attitude was, lease it as it is, you fix it or move out, I don't care,'' said Tom  Grass, leasing agent for the one of the first Pioneer Square buildings to undergo an overhaul, the six-story Corona Hotel at 606 Second Avenue, built in 1903. The Corona had housed an art gallery at street level but the floor was collapsing, the heat did not work and only pigeons occupied the dusty and deserted upper stories for the last 50 years.</p>
        <p>Plasterers are putting finishing touches on the Corona's new 5,000 square feet of retail space, where Steve Perry's Willow's Gallery will open this month. Market-rate rent for stores is about $24 a square foot annually, while prime downtown space leases for $50 to $75.</p>
        <p>In July, renters began moving into 20 loft apartments, with 13-foot-high ceilings and 1,100 square feet of space, that lease for $1,900 monthly. Suzanne Cole, the project manager, said that ''there are few apartments like this in the city, so demand is high.''</p>
        <p>A block away, scaffolding covers the Terry-Denny Building at 109 First Avenue South, which is being transformed into 48 loft apartments and 10,000 square feet of street-level retail space. Built in 1889 as the grand Northern Hotel when Seattle hastened to recover from the devastating fire, it was vacant when Mr. Israel bought it in the 1970's, and its only recent tenant was the Colour Box nightclub. Apartments are 600 to 1,300 square feet and rents will range from $1,080 to $2,340 when occupancy begins in October.</p>
        <p>Mr. Israel was criticized for decades for letting his buildings decay. Ironically, Samis this summer received bad press when it refused to renew leases in the 110-year-old, six-story Washington Shoe Building at Occidental and South Jackson so that it could start rehabbing the building into apartments or offices.</p>
        <p>Street-level tenants -- an antiques store, a picture-frame boutique, an art gallery and a kite shop -- reluctantly moved out. And so did artists who had been living illegally in studios on the five upper floors that were not in compliance with building codes.</p>
        <p>''The artists and all of us who leased space knew we had a good deal going,'' said Stephen Croft, owner of Elliott Bay Antiques, who moved his shop a block away when forced out. ''But I have no animosity toward Samis. This is not the old regime that said, 'Don't call me unless the roof is leaking.' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Croft paid Samis $5,000 a month for 8,000 square feet of space, 85 percent of it in the unheated basement, but now pays market rates of $4,000 a month for 2,000 square feet.</p>
        <p>Mr. Israel had unsuccessfully tried to buy the 42-story Smith Tower, once the tallest building west of the Mississippi. He had owned the rest of the block between Yesler Way and James Street. Three years after his death, Samis bought the 522-foot-high landmark at auction after GE Capital had foreclosed on a loan.</p>
        <p>Lyman Cornelius Smith, of the L. C. Smith &amp; Brothers typewriter company, which later became Smith Corona, had constructed the tower as the showcase for the business district, but by the time it was built in 1914, downtown was moving north. Mr. Smith also owned a shotgun-manufacturing company.</p>
        <p>BY 1997, ''paint was peeling, there was no air-conditioning, it was not well-wired, cobwebs were everywhere and it looked like no one moved a piece of furniture in 30 years,'' Mr. Grass recalled. It had small tenants and lawyers who had been there for decades.</p>
        <p>Samis spent $28 million to restore the Smith Tower to its original elegance, with marble walls, bronze windows that open and a 35th-floor banquet room furnished with gifts given by the Empress of China in 1914 in return for typewriters and guns. It still has manually operated elevators, but it is now one of the city's most high-tech office buildings, with fiber-optics and wireless communication, and it has attracted some dot-com companies that like the funky neighborhood.</p>
        <p>Samis placed the heat and air-conditioning in an adjacent building so the tower's basement could become a health club, and it is constructing a 453-spot parking garage across the street to serve tenants.</p>
        <p>While the Samis Foundation is the beneficiary of the real estate portfolio, the costs of rehabilitation of its buildings to bring them up to modern standards is high. Samis awarded $2.5 million in grants last year to its Jewish endeavors and will give $3.5 million in 2000. ''We will grant out of operating income for many decades, not by selling property,'' Mr. Justen said. But, he added,  ''There also is enough development work in our portfolio to last a lifetime.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  August 20, 2000, Sunday  A map last Sunday with an article about the renovation of the Pioneer Square district in Seattle mislabeled a roadway. It was the Alaskan Way Viaduct, not the Alaska Highway Viaduct. The map also included an outdated label. The Kingdome was demolished last spring.</p>
