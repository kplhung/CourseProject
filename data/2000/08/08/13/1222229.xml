      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The Rye School District has adopted new security measures to protect children and staff. Two-way communication will be installed in all classrooms. Only students, faculty and staff will be allowed to enter doors other than the main entrances in the morning. Parents or other visitors must enter the main entrance, sign in and get a visitor's pass. During recess and lunch, teacher aides will have access to the school by means of a key or a keypad, and teachers and support staff will need identification cards with a picture of themselves. Also, students in middle and high school will be issued locks for their lockers, with school officials having access to the lockers. Superintendent Edward Shine said the new measures were not being adopted in response to a particular incident, but reflected concern about violence in schools across the country.</p>
