        <p>Vice President Al Gore said today that in his acceptance speech to the Democratic National Convention he would embrace President Clinton's success in presiding over the hardy economy but send an unmistakable message:  ''I'm running on my own agenda, on my own voice and through my own experiences.''</p>

        <p>Vice President Al Gore said today that in his acceptance speech to the Democratic National Convention he would embrace President Clinton's success in presiding over the hardy economy but send an unmistakable message:  ''I'm running on my own agenda, on my own voice and through my own experiences.''</p>
        <p>In the first extensive interview previewing his address to the delegates on Thursday -- the most momentous of his political career -- Mr. Gore also said the speech at the Staples Center here would be loaded with policy specifics, because he wanted the public to know he had a definite agenda to lead the country.</p>
        <p>And he said he would pledge to connect with the American public as president by constantly holding ''town meetings'' with ordinary citizens that would become ''a major theme of my presidency.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore spoke by telephone from Pittsburgh on the last weekend of campaigning before joining the stream of delegates heading to the first convention in this city since John F. Kennedy was nominated in 1960. Hillary Rodham Clinton, who was already here, said today that she and the president would stay just long enough to proclaim their support for Mr. Gore, then drop ''out of sight.'' [Page 23.]</p>
        <p>Vowing to ''speak very concretely,'' Mr. Gore said he would outline his plan for cutting taxes for middle-class families and altering the Social Security system, his championing of the environment and his role ''in efforts to set time limits and reform welfare.''</p>
        <p>''The reason I'm going to take the risk of going into specifics,'' he said, ''is that I think people ought to know the issues that are at stake.''</p>
        <p>He said he believed that his decision to speak in detail, reminiscent of Mr. Clinton's policy-laden State of the Union messages, was a gamble because ''the modern trend has been to resort to the vaguest of generalities and not to challenge the audience with specifics and hard substance. I don't go along with that.''</p>
        <p>His implicit suggestion was that Gov. George W. Bush's acceptance speech in Philadelphia had been short on substance.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore made clear that his proposal for town meetings was intended to help address what some of his advisers say has been his central vulnerability: that he is not personally appealing to the public.</p>
        <p>''It will be the centerpiece of the way I conduct an open, continuing, candid, no-holds-barred dialogue with the American people throughout the Gore-Lieberman administration,'' said Mr. Gore, who was known for holding endless public sessions when he was a young congressman from Tennessee.</p>
        <p>He said he welcomed the comments this week by Mr. Clinton that the vice president should not be tarred with any scandals of the Clinton years. ''I appreciate what the president said,'' Mr. Gore said. ''He repeated what he said in the past and what many others have said: This campaign is about the future.''</p>
        <p>Dismissing worries among some Democratic officials that the Clintons were looming over the proceedings here and distracting attention from him, Mr. Gore repeated: ''This election is about the future. It is about the choice that has to be made between Governor Bush and myself. Anyone who doubts that underestimates the desire of the American people.''</p>
        <p>Yet some Democrats here expressed concerns that the Clintons have hardly slipped gently away as Mr. Gore's big week approaches. Recognizing, perhaps, that he has overwhelmed the news coverage in the run-up to the convention, Mr. Clinton abruptly canceled television interviews scheduled for this weekend. And White House officials said they called off an interview with The New York Times because they were furious about the newspaper's coverage of how the Clintons are the headline attractions at fund-raising events here that competed with Mr. Gore's.</p>
        <p>The overriding objective of the delegates here was to name a ticket that would continue eight years of their party's rule in the White House. But thus far, Mr. Clinton's long shadow has been the talk of the convention.</p>
        <p>Edward G. Rendell, the general chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said in an interview that Mr. Clinton had resisted a Monday speaking slot here because he thought Tuesday would be a bigger night. Mr. Rendell, the former mayor of Philadelphia, said he had persuaded Mr. Clinton to settle on Monday -- and to leave town the next day -- by telling him he would draw a larger audience if he delivered his address immediately after what would surely be a highly rated Titans-Rams football game.</p>
        <p>''The reason I was able to sell him on Monday was the Titans-Rams game,'' Mr. Rendell said. ''I said, 'Look, we've got to get the maximum audience because there's nobody alive who can better explain why Al Gore should be president than you.' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore said it would not be fair to compare his task to that of Vice President George Bush in 1988, who advisers said was essentially offering himself as the steward of a third term of the Reagan administration. Rather than merely continue with Mr. Clinton's achievements, Mr. Gore said his message would be that he could build on the economic successes of the last eight years.</p>
        <p>''I will make a new start to include those who have not yet fully enjoyed the benefits of the progress we have made,'' Mr. Gore said, ''and upon which I can launch this new effort to connect the American people to the full spirit of our democracy: the open meetings.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's advisers said his speech would be a pivotal moment in his stepping out from Mr. Clinton. Asked if he would mention Mr. Clinton in his address, Mr. Gore replied: ''Sure. I will say that the last eight years have been years of such remarkable economic progress and progress in lowering the crime rate and welfare reform, in significant measure because of his dedication to trying to create a better future.''</p>
        <p>Yet Mr. Gore also said he would put forth a new vision. ''He gave us a foundation upon which I will build, upon which I will make a new start to include those who have not yet fully enjoyed the benefits of the progress we have made,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The vice president said that while he would make contrasts with Mr. Bush and Dick Cheney, his running mate, on policy, he intended to keep his remarks upbeat. ''It will be positive, positive, positive,'' Mr. Gore said of the speech, which he drafted largely himself. ''And it will describe a time of tremendous hope and possibility. There will be no negative points about Governor Bush or Mr. Cheney, either overt or covert, either direct or implied. There will be direct comparisons of the approach Joe Lieberman and I take to the issues.''</p>
        <p>His pledge to stay positive in his speech, Mr. Gore insisted, was not rooted in any concern that the Republicans would continue to portray him as having a relentlessly negative campaign style.</p>
        <p>''Now that the American people are beginning to tune into this dialogue, most of them for the first time,'' Mr. Gore said, ''it is imperative that we elevate the tone of the campaign on both sides. I think there's a willingness to do that on the other side. And I hope the other side will see this convention and this speech as an opening of opportunities for them as well as for us.''</p>
        <p>Despite Mr. Gore's assurances, several Gore advisers and convention officials said that while they were mindful that the program should not appear harshly negative, some speakers would not shrink from aggressively taking on Mr. Bush and the Republicans. The wide belief among leading Democrats is that the sharp-edge remarks against Democrats at the Philadelphia convention, particularly by Mr. Cheney, gave them an excuse to fire back.</p>
        <p>''I don't think they have a lot of credibility left on that anymore,'' said Robert Shrum, one of Mr. Gore's top advisers. ''The Cheney and Bush speeches had a personally negative tone. Secondly, I think you can very respectfully discuss issues, and the differences you have on issues. People don't see that as a negative at all. They see that as something they're entitled to know.''</p>
        <p>Asked if Republicans might trap Democrats by goading them into lambasting Mr. Bush, then condemning them as too negative, Mr. Rendell said: ''They had a chance but they blew that on Wednesday night. If they had run a sweetness-and-light convention on Wednesday night, it would have been difficult for us. We would have had to tread gingerly to even do issues comparatives without seeming negative.''</p>
        <p>Explaining how this convention would address matters like education and health care, Mr. Shrum ridiculed the largely cheery and temperate convention staged by the Republicans, saying: ''Look, we've not trying to run an ersatz variety show. We're trying to run a convention that puts a person, in a very serious way, before the American public.''</p>
        <p>In the interview today, Mr. Gore said he was intent on reaching back -- to far before he became vice president -- for the public to understand what motivates him.</p>
        <p>''I want them to know that the proposals I'm making for the future are rooted in my 24-year fight for working families,'' he said. ''I want them to know that my proposal for regular open meetings as president is rooted in my experience in learning from the working families for whom I fought for 16 years in the House and Senate. I want them to know that my passion for protecting the environment is rooted in the battle that I've waged for almost a quarter century.''</p>
        <p>Democrats in Los Angeles said they were bracing for a livelier, and seemingly less disciplined, gathering than the Republican convention, in part because of the Clintons.</p>
        <p>Mark Mellman, a Democratic pollster, said Mr. Gore had more to gain from the convention than his opponent -- and maybe more to lose -- because as close as the polls are, Mr. Bush is now ahead and the vice president needs to scramble the dynamic. ''The largest number of people,'' he said, ''are going to learn the most about Al Gore during the course of this convention.''</p>
