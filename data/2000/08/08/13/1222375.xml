        <p>The police say they are ready.

        <p>The police say they are ready. They've chopped down trees that could be set on fire, uprooted newspaper racks that could be used as battering rams and fenced off a good-size patch of downtown Los Angeles with tall silver swaths of chain-link in an effort to keep any protests at the Democratic National Convention from getting out of hand.</p>
        <p>The demonstrators say they are ready, too. They're building puppets to protest corporate greed, practicing passive resistance and media techniques, sharing organizing tips over the Internet and warily watching the police cars that circle their ''convergence center'' near MacArthur Park. They pledge, as one of their Web sites puts it, to ''celebrate and renew our resistance to corporate globalization, militarism, poverty, starvation, campaign finance corruption, sexism, racism, homo/trans-phobia, criminalization of youth, environmental destruction, prison industrial complex, genocide,'' and that's just for starters.</p>
        <p>The politicians? They're nervous, but hoping for the best: hoping that protests stay peaceful, that freeways stay open, that the Police Department that made ''Just the facts, ma'am'' famous keeps it cool.</p>
        <p>''We have been assured by all the law enforcement entities that everything's in hand, and that they're prepared for all contingencies and that everything's going to work out fine,'' said Terry McAuliffe, the chairman of the Democratic National Convention Committee and the overall organizer.</p>
        <p>''We're going to peacefully coexist with the demonstrators. They have every right to be heard and we have every right to be heard.''</p>
        <p>That does not mean there hasn't been wrangling, or that there won't be more. On Friday afternoon, a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order barring the city and the Los Angeles Police Department from seizing any puppets or written materials from the headquarters of an umbrella protest group, as the authorities did in Philadelphia. In addition, the judge, Dean Pregerson of United States District Court, barred officials from entering the demonstrators' offices on the basis of purported administrative and building code violations.</p>
        <p>''It sends a loud and clear message that the Constitution will not be suspended while the convention is in town,'' said Dan Tokaji, a lawyer for the local chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, which had earlier successfully sued the city to force creation of a designated protest site in clear view and hearing of the delegates entering the Staples Center, where the convention will be held. The city's initial plan was to fence off protesters in a parking lot well across the street and out of direct view. ''We believe this order will be more than adequate to protector protesters' speech rights,'' Mr. Tokaji said.</p>
        <p>At the same time, Mr. Tokaji said: ''We remain very fearful. This department has a long history of violating people's civil rights, and we're very concerned about the us vs. them mentality that the L.A.P.D. brass has adopted. We believe that's actually harmful to the cooperation that will be necessary for things to go smoothly.''</p>
        <p>In fact, Los Angeles does not have a public culture of robust political activism or a tradition of large street demonstrations, and the department here is seldom called on to handle the kinds of raucous gatherings that are par for the course in New York, for example. The videotaped image of Los Angeles officers beating the black motorist Rodney King remains indelible, and nearly a decade after the adoption of measures intended to improve police training and discipline, the city is facing the threat of a federal civil rights lawsuit from the Justice Department, which alleges a pattern of widespread police misconduct.</p>
        <p>But top officials here insist that the police are prepared for a firm but measured response, one that could very well involve a variety of nonlethal weapons from tear gas to rubber bullets, pepper spray or paint-ball guns.</p>
        <p>''You're going to see the most professional police enforcement ever,'' Mayor Richard J. Riordan said in an interview this week. ''It's not just the L.A.P.D. It's also the F.B.I., the Secret Service, the county sheriffs, the highway patrol. Everybody's working well together.''</p>
        <p>Elise Hogue, a spokeswoman for the umbrella protest groups, D2KLA and DAN (which stands for Direct Action Network), said that it was difficult to estimate how many protesters, from a disparate range of loosely connected groups, might actually converge on the city. But she said the estimate of 50,000 offered by some city officials in the past was wildly overstated.</p>
        <p>''We're going for somewhere between 5,000 and 10,000,'' she said.</p>
        <p>''We're cautiously optimistic,'' Ms. Hogue added in an interview from the group's base near downtown. ''Everything is going as planned. We're making some beautiful puppets and hoping they survive. But you can't really walk outside our door without seeing a policeman or an individual patrol vehicle cruising around.''</p>
        <p>The police planning has been under way for more than a year, and one of its principal goals has been to foster better cooperation than in some past crises, like the 1992 riots that followed the acquittal of the officers in the King beating. In that violence, interagency cooperation faltered, but now officials say there are clear plans. Sheriffs' deputies, for example, will be on hand to process demonstrators if mass arrests are necessary, leaving patrol officers available to stay on the streets, while highway patrol officers will provide security on delegates' buses.</p>
        <p>City and Democratic officials acknowledge that their biggest concern is not the area around the Staples Center itself, which is compact and can be sealed off, but the possibility that a relative handful of demonstrators could create disruptions in widely spread out areas of this widely spread out city and seriously disrupt traffic on freeways or buses at hotels. Protesters have hinted that their prime targets might include corporate office towers that have nothing to do with the convention.</p>
        <p>In the case of traffic disruptions or blocked buildings, top Democratic organizers say they are prepared to wait out demonstrators rather than provoke violence too quickly.</p>
        <p>''We have told the L.A.P.D. that we can start the convention sessions late if we have to,'' one senior planner said.</p>
        <p>Because delegates are so dispersed (the longest round trip from delegate hotels to the Staples Center is close to 50 miles), Los Angeles poses special challenges. Event Transportation Associates, the private concern organizing the transportation planning for the Democrats, says the longest one-way travel time has been clocked at 1 hour and 40 minutes. Nearly 300 buses will shuttle nearly 10,000 delegates, donors and friends of the party to and from 76 hotels in seven cities.</p>
