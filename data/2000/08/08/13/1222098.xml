        <p>LEGEND has it that the reason school is out in the summer is that long ago, children were needed to work in the fields.</p>
        <p>These days, you'd be hard pressed just to find a child mowing a lawn. In fact, in some neighborhoods, you'd be hard pressed to find a child at all.</p>
        <p>''This is like such a ghost town, said Helene Maia, a first-grade teacher from Millburn. ''It's so weird. There's just no children. You don't see any bikes. There's no kids playing ball. There's no kids running around.''</p>
        <p>No, the missing children haven't been raptured up to heaven or abducted by aliens. You won't find their pictures on milk cartons. They're in Maine, New Hampshire and Pennsylvania, living in bunks, paddling canoes, playing Capture the Flag, having food fights and doing all the wonderful things that Hayley Mills did in ''The Parent Trap'' -- often on the same hallowed ground where their baby boom parents came of age.</p>
        <p>Why do so many children go away for the summer? Mostly because their parents did. ''Camps do an excellent job creating a sense of family lineage,'' said Maurice Elias, a professor of psychology at Rutgers. ''It's like a club.''</p>
        <p>The parents left behind are another club. A club of grown-ups that dines at fine restaurants, goes on European vacations or simply gets through a whole day without once finding dirty socks in front of the refrigerator. I found myself mingling with just such a club at a party this summer where everybody else, it seemed, was sending off their progeny to camp for either four or eight weeks.</p>
        <p>I felt left out. But I need not have. It was a club that would gladly have me as a member -- if only I would send away for $15 worth of iron-on name labels and rob several  banks.</p>
        <p>The privileges of this club are sometimes prosaic. ''It's definitely neater,'' said Nancy Star, a novelist from Montclair whose two daughters, 9 and 12, are in Maine for eight weeks. ''And there is less laundry. Those are absolutes.''</p>
        <p>But sometimes the privileges are profound, like finding that you can relate to your spouse not just as a co-parent and fellow domestic slave, but as a person. ''The rhythms of what you used to do together come back,'' Ms. Star said. ''But if my kids weren't happy, I don't think I would have enjoyed a second of it.''</p>
        <p>There is another club I don't belong to, and that's the club of moms who loll around with their kids all summer, completely unstructured, and enjoy it immensely.</p>
        <p>''We're just having a good time,'' said Mary Meyer of Glen Ridge. ''I can't imagine being away from my kids all summer. I would be so lost.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Meyer says her children have been Roller Blading, bicycling, playing with puzzles and going to the local library, which runs a summer reading game. In Millburn, Mrs. Maia had just finished painting a flower pot with her daughter Christine, 6.</p>
        <p>Christine and her brother Daniel, 11, also spend a lot of time at the public library, but sometimes (horrors!) they actually sit around and veg.</p>
        <p>''Yeah, sometimes they'll sit in front of that TV set for three hours and you know what? It's not a bad thing,'' Mrs. Maia said.</p>
        <p>There's only one strict rule, and that is that nobody is allowed to use the B-word. Mrs. Maia has promised to ''unbore'' any child of hers who complained of having nothing to do. So far, they haven't availed themselves of the opportunity.</p>
        <p>Naomi Drew, an educator who wrote the forthcoming book ''Peaceful Parents, Peaceful Kids'' (Kensington Publishers, $14), thinks children could use more time just making mud pies. ''We're really robbing children of the empty spaces of time that they need,'' she said. ''Empty spaces of reverie where creative ideas just emerge.''</p>
        <p>I picture kids just climbing on trees, or stretched out on the grass, deciding whether the clouds look more like elephants or pianos. But I'm a hopeless romantic. ''Some kids will be very content watching blades of grass grow,'' Dr. Elias said. ''There will be a few of them, but not too many.''</p>
        <p>Here's the club that I belong to. The children go to day camp some of the time. They visit their grandparents occasionally. And sometimes they just hang out with me. And here's a confession. I, too, will be a member of the iron-on label club. My kids are going to sleep-away camp for one whole week.</p>
        <p>It's heartbreaking, I know. I'll be lost. But how else, I ask you, will they get the privilege of showering with spiders?</p>
