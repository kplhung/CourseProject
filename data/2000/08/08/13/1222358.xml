        <p>Nearly 20 years ago, an 18-year-old prince, heir to a doomed Asian royal line, commandeered a small boat and sailed unnoticed with his brother and their nanny across the Mekong River from Laos to Thailand. Laos had become a Communist nation, in the orbit of neighboring Vietnam, and the prince, Soulivong Savang, feared being co-opted or killed.</p>
        <p>Two decades later, the prince -- grandson of the last king of Laos, who died mysteriously in Communist captivity with the prince's father and other relatives -- is beginning to reassert his claim of leadership.</p>
        <p>The return of a monarchy, even a constitutional monarchy, to Laos is at best a remote possibility. Royal families continue to play a role in Asia, from the Himalayas through Southeast Asia to Japan, but Prince Soulivong Savang is not focused on those examples.</p>
        <p>In an interview in New York on a recent visit to Laotian exile communities in the United States, the prince, now 37, said that after years of a European education in law and political science, he has found a new hero in King Juan Carlos of Spain, a champion of democracy in a country that emerged from a long dictatorship.</p>
        <p>''I'm not so interested in the future of monarchy in Laos,'' he said, speaking in Lao through an aide who interpreted. ''My main proposal is to restore democracy first. The restoration of the monarchy would be up to the Lao people.''</p>
        <p>He is taking that message to Laotians exiled in the West at a time of unexpected new unrest in Laos, a country of barely five million people. In recent months, bombings in the capital and other towns, coupled with an apparently reinvigorated rebellion among the Hmong people in the north, has shaken the last largely unreconstructed Communist government of Southeast Asia.</p>
        <p>Prince Soulivong Savang treads carefully in talking of the Vietnamese, who had hoped to keep Laos and Cambodia within an Indochinese federation dominated by Hanoi. The federation was a legacy of French colonialism, which ended in the mid-1950's. The French also promoted the modern Laotian monarchy. As its heir, the prince is portrayed in Laos as a client of the West.</p>
        <p>The crown prince, who lives in Paris, has been following reports of student unrest and a surreptitious return of the Vietnamese military to Laos. He is also concerned about the domination of Thai business on the fragile economy of Laos.</p>
        <p>With an end to Communism, Vietnamese and Thai influence would be gone from Laos, said his uncle, Prince Sauryavong Savang, who escaped death because he was in Thailand when the sweep of the royal family took place in 1977. The elder prince regent also lives in Paris. The Laotian government has never said exactly what happened to the rest of the royal family, except to announce in 1989 that King Savang Vatthana was dead.</p>
        <p>Prince Soulivong Savang said that he was away at school in 1977, when his grandfather, father and six other family members were arrested. He was allowed to remain with his mother, Princess Manilay Khampane Panya, in the royal capital, Luang Phabang, though under constant surveillance.</p>
        <p>The government arranged his secondary education, which included large doses of Communist doctrine. A cousin of the late king, Prince Souphanouvong, had become a Marxist, so there was a precedent. Because the young prince's family had been stripped of their money and possessions, he learned to grow rice to feed them, he said.</p>
        <p>Within a few years, he said, his friends began disappearing from school. ''When they stayed loyal to the monarchy they would be taken away for re-education,'' he said. ''Later I realized that the government was trying to prevent a group of supporters growing around me because by the age of 18, I had become a symbol and a danger. I heard a rumor that I would be sent to a Communist country for further education. I was obliged to find a way to escape.''</p>
        <p>The prince said that he faked allergies that he said needed urgent treatment by a doctor in Vientiane, now the Laotian capital. Before his minders could see what was happening, he had fled from there across the Mekong to Nong Khai, a Thai river port.</p>
        <p>In Thailand, he and his brother were protected by the Thai royal family until it was considered safe to arrange the prince's travel to France. His mother is still alive in Laos, he said. They met last year in Australia, where the Lao government had allowed her a visit when her daughter, the prince's sister, had a baby.</p>
        <p>Prince Soulivong Savang is learning English in London in the hope of reaching a wider audience of Lao exiles. Never married, he said he is willing to put his life into his cause, and his followers in the United States are pressing his case as part of a broader democracy movement seeking support from Congress.</p>
        <p>The Laotian exile community -- 100,000 in France, 40,000 in Australia and half a million in the United States -- has been fractured ethnically between Lao and Hmong. The crown prince said he tells both groups that a constitutional monarchy is their best hope of unity.</p>
