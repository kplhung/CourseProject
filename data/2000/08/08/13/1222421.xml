        <p>By her sophomore year of high school, Cristina Teuscher was an elite international swimmer. Her graduation present in 1996 was a gold medal in the 800-meter freestyle relay at the Atlanta Olympics.

        <p>By her sophomore year of high school, Cristina Teuscher was an elite international swimmer. Her graduation present in 1996 was a gold medal in the 800-meter freestyle relay at the Atlanta Olympics. She could have attended any of the major swimming powers, such as Stanford or Southern Cal, which were more than willing to give her a full-scholarship ride through college.</p>
        <p>Instead, Teuscher chose to stay close to home, attending Columbia University and shelling out $34,000 a year. Do not worry about cost, her father, Enrique Teuscher, a psychiatrist in New Rochelle, had told her. Just be happy. So she remained close to her parents, balancing the academic rigors of an Ivy League education with the demands of a high-level swimming career, minus the pressures of having to justify her scholarship by leading her team to national collegiate titles.</p>
        <p>She chose a road not often taken in the swimming world, and her career has benefited demonstrably. Teuscher now has a degree in psychology, four individual collegiate titles and yet another spot in the Olympics, having qualified tonight for the Summer Games in Sydney, Australia, by winning the 200-meter individual medley at the Olympic trials in 2 minutes 13.36 seconds, her career best by nearly a second. Gabrielle Rose, who competed for Brazil at the 1996 Games, finished second tonight in 2:14.95.</p>
        <p>Teuscher had been a favorite last Wednesday in the 400-meter individual medley, but apparent complacency and tentativeness took her out of the race immediately and she finished third. Only two swimmers qualify for the Olympics in each event. Tonight, not wearing a high-tech bodysuit because it constricts her breaststroke, she swam much more aggressively, drawing away steadily from her competition and winning by more than a second and a half, a huge victory in a race that can be decided by hundredths of a second.</p>
        <p>''It was important to prove to myself that I could get up after being down,'' the 22-year-old Teuscher said.</p>
        <p>In the men's 200-meter butterfly, Tom Malchow of St. Paul, Minn., was nearly a half second faster than his world-record pace after 150 meters, but he perhaps went out too fast. He still won easily in 1:56.87, but did not threaten record of 1:55.18. In finishing second in 1:57.48, 15-year-old Michael Phelps of Baltimore became the youngest American male swimmer to qualify for the Olympics since 1932.</p>
        <p>''Hopefully, we can put together two great swims and dominate this event,'' Malchow said.</p>
        <p>Lindsay Benko of Elkhart, Ind., won the women's 200-meter freestyle in 2:00.45, ahead of Owen Rada (2:00.54) of Arlington, Va. In the semifinals of the men's 100-meter freestyle, Neil Walker, who finished second on Friday in the 100-meter backstroke, posted the fastest time of 48.55 seconds. Gary Hall Jr., the 1996 Olympic silver medalist, posted the second-fastest time in 48.92 seconds. Hall has been found to have diabetes since the Atlanta Games, and was an uncertain presence before the trials began. He is now a serious contender in Sunday's final.</p>
        <p>In the women's 200 individual medley, Teuscher said that her choice to remain close to home for college had been long validated and did not depend on a victory tonight.</p>
        <p>''I see people go off to college and have difficulty balancing academics and the responsibilities of a college scholarship,'' Teuscher said. ''They are away from home and their defenses are always up. I'd rather be in a comfortable setting, around people I know who would give me unconditional love. I could let my guard down.''</p>
        <p>She won the first two collegiate swimming titles for Columbia in 1998, then stunned her competitors by leaving the national meet early to go home and study. While in school, she trained in the morning at Columbia with Coach Diana Caskey and in the afternoons at Lehman College in the Bronx with John Collins, her longtime coach at the Badger Swim Club in Larchmont. Grants from the United States Olympic Committee and the national swimming federation helped defray tuition costs.</p>
        <p>''I had the best of both worlds with a female and male coach,'' the 6-foot-1-inch, 150-pound Teuscher said. ''I hate to generalize, but a woman coach seems more in tune about how I feel. I'm an emotional person. John really knew what I needed physically to be in shape. The mixture was perfect for me.''</p>
        <p>Caskey said, ''I think this allowed her to develop her own sense of self-confidence and maturity.''</p>
        <p>At the Atlanta Games, Teuscher, then 18, said she was in a ''catatonic state,'' unnerved by the crowds of 18,000 people at Georgia Tech. After winning the 200-meter freestyle at the 1996 trials and finishing second in the 400 freestyle, her best individual finish at the Olympics was sixth.</p>
        <p>''She was like a scared rabbit,'' Collins said. ''Some people step up in those kind of situations. With Cristina, it didn't work that way at all. I'm proud that she was able to recover to get a gold medal in the relay.''</p>
        <p>Attending Columbia provided a sort of protective cocoon, Collins said, allowing Teuscher to rebuild her confidence and to gain a broader world view in a rigorous academic environment. Team swimming was stressed, relieving the pressure of individual accomplishment. Four years later, she entered the 2000 trials relaxed and self-assured.</p>
        <p>''People said I looked like a five-year-old on TV, ready to cry,'' Teuscher said with a laugh about her performance in Atlanta. ''I felt all the pressure on my shoulders. I think I've learned to brush that off and just get in the pool and swim. I've definitely come a long way since then. The secret to it is to be relaxed and have fun.''</p>
        <p>She may have been too relaxed in the 400 individual medley after a superb early season, Collins said. He said the third-place finish had the effect of waking up a somnolent Teuscher.</p>
        <p>''I don't think she concentrated enough to be to do what she had to do to win,'' Collins said. ''It was a wakeup call. Everyone needs that once in a while, but it came at an inopportune time.''</p>
        <p>Before tonight's race, Teuscher spoke to Jenny Thompson, a five-time Olympic gold medalist, and to Summer Sanders, who won a silver medal in the 200 individual medley and a bronze in the 400 at the 1992 Summer Games in Barcelona, Spain. She also covered herself with ladybug stickers as sort of good-luck charms.</p>
        <p>Thompson told her to remain controlled and Sanders said, ''Just have fun and go for it.''</p>
        <p>''Sometimes you need to hear that from people beside your family and coach,'' Teuscher said. ''I was really more aggressive. I wasn't taking any chances.''</p>
