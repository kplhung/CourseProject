        <p>Correction of July 30 article on proposed rent increases at Peter Cooper Village in Manhattan, which misattributed quote to Soni Fink and misstated amount of Fink's rent increase (S)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>An article in the Neighborhood Report pages on July 30 about proposed rent increases in Peter Cooper Village misattributed a quotation from a critic of the increases. It was not Soni Fink but another Peter Cooper resident, unidentified, who said: ''My husband fought in World War II, and he got this apartment as part of the benefits for returning vets. And now this is the thanks we get.'' The article also misstated the percentage by which Ms. Fink's rent would rise. It would be 22 percent, plus standard lease renewal increases, not ''nearly half.''</p>
