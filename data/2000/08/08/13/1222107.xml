        <p>SUFFOLK COUNTY has been spraying pesticides to battle mosquitoes that might be carrying the West Nile virus for about a month now. So has New York City. But Nassau County, despite being wedged between the two, has so far held off.</p>
        <p>Nassau's decision has drawn both criticism and praise. While environmental groups applaud the county's restraint, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has repeatedly said that not spraying along Nassau's western border could endanger city residents because birds infected with West Nile have been found on the city's side of the border.</p>
        <p>The first reported case of West Nile virus this year was found this month in a 78-year-old Staten Island man, who recovered. Last year, 62 people were infected and 7 died from the disease, which can cause severe brain inflammation.</p>
        <p>The question of whether Nassau should be spraying is another chapter in the long-running debate over pesticide use on Long Island, where environmentalists and breast cancer activists have argued that pesticides may contribute to the region's higher-than-average cancer rates.</p>
        <p>County officials say they have chosen not to use pesticides simply because the conditions have not yet warranted it. They add that neither pressure from antipesticide groups nor the county's current financial problems have contributed to the decision not to spray.</p>
        <p>Dr. Kathleen Gaffney, the county health commissioner, said the county had been following guidelines devised by state and local officials earlier this year that recommend spraying only when an infected mosquito is found, or when two or more infected birds are found within two miles of one another. No infected mosquitoes have been found in the county, and the five infected birds found were more than two miles apart.</p>
        <p>Dr. Gaffney said that because the county has monitored mosquito breeding for years, ''we know where to look and check for larvae and we can nip mosquitoes in the bud.'' The county has been using the historical data, she added, ''to make sure we're doing the right thing.''</p>
        <p>She also said that while Mayor Giuliani has been critical of Nassau County, he has not directly asked officials to begin spraying. (The Mayor has also publicly urged officials in Westchester County and New Jersey communities that border the city to spray for mosquitoes.)</p>
        <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued recommendations last month that are slightly stricter than the state's, suggesting that spraying for mosquitoes should be done within a two-mile radius of even one infected bird. According to the C.D.C. guideline, spraying within two miles of an infected bird found in Douglaston, Queens, would include a slice of Nassau County.</p>
        <p>But Dr. Gaffney said county officials had increased mosquito surveillance in that area and have so far found no evidence that the virus exists there. She also noted that the county has submitted more than 300 birds and more than 30,000 mosquitoes to state laboratories in Albany for testing. ''So it's not like we're not looking,'' she said.</p>
        <p>But some residents question the prudence of Nassau's decision.</p>
        <p>''I don't know what they're waiting for,'' said Valerie Kovel, a homeowner in Old Bethpage who lives near areas where two infected dead birds have been found. Ms. Kovel said she goes outdoors with her 10-month old son as little as possible.</p>
        <p>''I'm probably being neurotic, but they're there,'' she said of West Nile-carrying mosquitoes. ''They're everywhere else, so they've got to be out there somewhere. The county people just haven't caught the right mosquito yet.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Kovel, who has complained to county officials about the decision not to spray, said she is not unconcerned about possible side effects from pesticides. ''We don't know the effect of pesticides,'' she said, ''but at the same time, we do know the effect of West Nile: It can kill you. To me that makes the choice obvious.''</p>
        <p>Officials in Suffolk said they generally do not share Mr. Giuliani's concerns about Nassau's decision not to spray, noting that infected birds and mosquitoes have not been found on their border with Nassau.</p>
        <p>Suffolk started spraying for mosquitoes on Fire Island in early July not because West Nile had been found but because residents requested the pesticides to rid the area of nuisance mosquitoes. Spraying to battle West Nile began in mid-July after infected birds and mosquitoes were found in Babylon.</p>
        <p>But even Suffolk officials have used restraint, choosing not to spray in Smithtown even though infected mosquitoes have been found there.</p>
        <p>Dr. David G. Graham, Suffolk's director of public health, said the county had not sprayed in Smithtown because the infected mosquitoes were found in a remote part of Blydenburgh Park.</p>
        <p>''It's a very unpopulated area and we determined the risk to human beings was very low,'' he said, adding that officials were continuing to monitor the area closely. ''Our main objective is to reduce transmission to people and all decisions are based on that.''</p>
        <p>Since the mosquito season began this spring, Suffolk has submitted more than 5,000 dead birds and more than 34,000 mosquitoes to Albany for testing. State officials have so far found 15 infected birds and 35 infected mosquito pools in Suffolk County, most of them in western towns.</p>
        <p>Community groups and cancer-patient advocacy groups said they believed Nassau County was moving with appropriate care and that if anything, Suffolk was using pesticides a little too liberally.</p>
        <p>''We're of course very worried about the dangers and side affects of these chemicals no matter how safe they tell us they are,'' said Geri Barish, executive director of 1 in 9, a coalition of breast cancer activists. ''We wouldn't want to see anyone get West Nile, but if we're not in that kind of danger right now, why take the risk with the pesticides?''</p>
        <p>Neal Lewis, executive director of the Long Island Neighborhood Network, questioned the effectiveness of widespread spraying done last year.</p>
        <p>''Many of us feel it was basically a p.r. thing, that officials needed to show they were doing something,'' he said. ''But studies have shown that using nonchemical methods to keep mosquito populations down are the best way to try to control these kinds of things.''</p>
        <p>He noted that when the West Nile virus was discovered in New York City last year, the city did not have a mosquito monitoring program. ''There was no prevention whatsoever,'' Mr. Lewis said. ''But that's not the case here. We think Nassau County has got it about right. Infected mosquitoes should be found before spraying.''</p>
        <p>Officials from the Centers for Disease Control and from the state Department of Health said that their recommendations for when to spray for mosquitoes were intended as nothing more than guidelines.</p>
        <p>''We've said all along that the decision for whether to spray rightly belongs in the hands of local health officials,'' said Kristine A. Smith, a spokeswoman for the state Health Department. ''There may be specific circumstances that factor into any decision making. Oftentimes things are not cut and dried, and this is one of those issues. There is no one-size-fits-all solution.''</p>
