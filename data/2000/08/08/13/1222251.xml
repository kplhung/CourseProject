        <p>Album's Winding Road</p>
        <p>Q.: Several hours before he gunned down John Lennon outside the Dakota, Mark David Chapman asked him for an autograph, which Lennon provided. What became of it?</p>
        <p>A.: Mark David Chapman had been loitering outside the Dakota for two days when John Lennon and Yoko Ono left the building about 5 p.m. on Dec. 8, 1980. Mr. Chapman asked Mr. Lennon to sign a copy of ''Double Fantasy,'' the record album the couple had released two weeks before.</p>
        <p>Using a blue ballpoint pen, Lennon wrote ''John Lennon 1980'' on the album cover, scribbling the words over Ms. Ono's throat. The pen didn't work right away, so he wrote his name twice, the second time on top of the first. As Lennon wrote, Mr. Chapman stood to his left. A freelance photographer casually snapped a picture of the pair, which appeared in The Daily News the next day.</p>
        <p>At some point over the next few hours, Mr. Chapman stashed the album in a flower urn, one of two that stand on tall pedestals flanking the Dakota's deep, arched entryway on West 72nd Street.</p>
        <p>Hours later, as Mr. Lennon lay dying, Philip Michael stood with other passers-by viewing the chaotic scene unfolding in front of the building, and the album fell out of the urn, almost on top of him. He tried to replace it several times, but it kept falling, so he kept it and took it with him when he left in a cab hours later. It wasn't until another passenger in the cab told him that the police were looking for the album that Mr. Michael understood its significance.</p>
        <p>Mr. Michael gave the album to the police, who held it as evidence to be used in Mr. Chapman's trial. Mr. Chapman pleaded guilty, however, and in August 1981 Mr. Michael applied to have the album returned. It came back slightly worn, with 16 small police notations and forensically enhanced fingerprints of Mr. Chapman on the jacket, sleeve and record. With it came a letter of gratitude from the district attorney.</p>
        <p>Mr. Michael has said he didn't look at or play the album for 17 years, but in 1998 he decided to offer it for sale over the Internet, asking $1.8 million. Gary J. Zimet, Mr. Michael's sales agent, said the album was bought by an anonymous California collector in January 1999 for $460,000.</p>
        <p>Tunnel Visions</p>
        <p>Q.: Strips of red and blue lights appear sporadically along the wall of the reconstructed Queens-Midtown Tunnel. Though they look like Christmas decorations, they must serve a more serious purpose. What is it?</p>
        <p>A.: According to M.T.A. Bridges and Tunnels, the red lights at either end of the tube mark emergency exit doors. Blue lights mark five crossover doors, which allow employees to travel between the north and south tubes. The doors are for M.T.A. personnel, not motorists, who are discouraged from stopping in the tunnels under any circumstances.</p>
        <p>The Iguana Moves On</p>
        <p>Q.: What happened to the giant iguana on Pier 25, off West Street? I've been a fan of the iguana since it sat atop the old Lone Star Cafe on lower Fifth Avenue.</p>
        <p>A.: It was loaded onto a flatbed truck and shipped to a Texas buyer a year and a half ago, said Bob Wade, who built the iguana out of steel mesh and spray-on polyurethane in 1978. It was a downtown landmark while perched above the Lone Star, but after the bar closed in 1989, the 40-foot-long lizard was sold to a Virginia couple. Mr. Wade bought back his sculpture in the mid-1990's, had the blackish-gray beast painted a more reptilian green, and lent it to Manhattan Youth Recreation and Resources, a community group that runs children's programs on Pier 25. Mr. Wade, who lives in Austin, does not know where the iguana will next be displayed. ''Probably along some freeway,'' he said.</p>
