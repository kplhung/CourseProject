        <p>A HANDSOME Democrat is arriving in Los Angeles to accept his party's nomination for president. The craven reporters, the hyperambitious advisers, the mercenary fat cats are on hand, too, eager to claim their political pound of flesh.</p>
        <p>And that, of course, is not to mention the candidate's resentful spouse, the star-crazed Hollywood fund-raiser or the conniving wife of a has-been senator who lashes out with exclamations like ''I have been here longer than dirt. I know where all the dead bodies are - all of them!''</p>
        <p>So. Campaign fact or fiction?</p>
        <p>Well, as improbable as this may sound, it's all made up. This reasonable facsimile of an actual cast of convention characters forms the soapy nexus of ''Running Mates,'' an original TNT movie that has its premiere tonight at 8. It asks the question: Can a sexy Michigan governor find happiness - and address the troubling complexities of campaign finance reform - all within the confines of the Staples Center in Los Angeles?</p>
        <p>The movie, produced by, among others, Gerald Rafshoon (who, political addicts will recall, was the real-life advertising man for former President Jimmy Carter), features the kind of telegenic ensemble that any modern media consultant would kill to have on a convention dais. Tom Selleck plays the candidate, Nancy Travis is his wife, Laura Linney has the role of campaign manager, Teri Hatcher portrays the movie-world mover and shaker, and Faye Dunaway is Meg Gable, the woman who knows where the bodies are buried.</p>
        <p>Politics, more than ever before, is show biz. The Republican convention in Philadelphia, with its remote transmissions of Gov. George W. Bush talking to delegates from classrooms and historic sites, adn his wife, Laura, addressing the gathering with inner-city schoolchildren seated around her, was more of a set for the cameras than a platform for the issues. And with the Democrats set to commence their own four-day multi-media spectacle tomorrow in Los Angeles, what better time for show biz itself to get into the convention act?</p>
        <p>''Running Mates'' follows the travails of Gov. James Reynolds Pryce (Mr. Selleck) in the days leading up to his nomination for the presidency. The burning political mystery is who will be his vice president: the John McCain-like straight-arrow junio senator from Colorado, Terrence Randall (Bob Gunton), or the malevolent senior senator from Texas, Mitchell Morris (Bruce Mcgill), whose eyes seem to light up with dollar signs within 50 paces of a lobbyist.</p>
        <p>Pryce's dilemma: Side with Randall and the angels, and abandon any real hoe of winning, or enlist with Morris and his steel-jawed money men, who tell the governor that a $100 million war chest is his for the choosing of Morris as his running mate.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rafshoon, who divides his time between Hollywood and Washington, where he still lives, said that he was well aware that the $13 million production was taking something of a risk. It's one thing, after all, to portray the political world as a kind of ''General Hospital'' on the Potomac - remember the steamy ''Washington Behind Closed Doors''? - and quite another to make the central conflict of a prime-time story a topic about as titillating as a subcommittee hearing on excise taxes.</p>
        <p>''We brought in the aspect of campaign finance,'' Mr. Rafshoon said. ''Some might say it might be the kiss of death.''</p>
        <p>Then again, voters do tell pollsters that what they want from presidential candidates are discussions of real issues. And it's clear that fictionalized inside looks at decision-making in Washington can still capture the country's imagination: consider the success of ''The West Wing,'' the NBC series set in the White House that was nominated last month for an Emmy Award for best drama.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rafshoon said that given his own career in politics, he wanted to be sure that ''Running Mates'' at least came close to verisimilitude. Liberties, of course, were taken. In a break from recent American electoral experience, Pryce does not reveal his choice for vice president until the end of his acceptance speech on the final night of the convention. (An acceptance speech, by the way, that Mr. Selleck described in an interview as ''the shortest in American history.'')</p>
        <p>And there is one climactic scene in a ladies' powder room, in which all of the women in Pryce's life meet to congenially compare notes about his prowess as a man (as well as politician) that may strike some viewers as a tad on the cheesy side and less than highly probable. Mr. Rafshoon, however, contends that the protrayal of Pryce's moral crisis, and of the group of big-time donors who put pressure on him to go along, is not much of a stretch.</p>
        <p>''When he goes to meet those fat cats for the $100 million, that happens,'' Mr. Rafshoon said. ''It isn't that simplistic, but we can back up what happens. Politics has become a big business, and people realize that by backing candidates with their money they can stop legislation.</p>
        <p>''Pryce's journey could be used as metaphor for any walk of life. He's a good man, he wants to be president, he wants to succeed, and he's having these things thrown in his way.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Selleck said Mr. Rafshoon's first-hand knowledge of the process was one of the intriguing elements of the assignment. ''When I first read the script, it hand an authentic sense,'' said the actor, who got to introduce Nancy Reagan at the 1988 Republican National Convention. (He describes himself today as a political independent.)</p>
        <p>''I didn't know Gerry, but then I found out what Gerry did,'' said Mr. Selleck, ''and I bounced a lot of things off him in terms of just political philosophy, process, all sorts of things.''</p>
        <p>The movie, with its intimations of an idealist trapped in a world of venal pragmatrists, carries echoes of Frank Capra's ''Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.'' But, as Mr. Rafshoon relates, the political environment that inpsired ''Running Mates'' has changed radically since the era of the Capra film.</p>
        <p>''When Capra himself came to Washington in '39 to screen 'Mr. Smith' at the National Press Club, practically the entire Congress was there, and they became so incensed they walked out.'' But when Mr. Rafshoon screened ''Running Mates'' recently in Washington for members of Congress and other political players, the reaction was quite different.</p>
        <p>''Everybody laughed,'' he said. ''We were depicting business as usual.''</p>
