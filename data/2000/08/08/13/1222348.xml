        <p>The other day, La Caravelle, the three-star Manhattan restaurant, bought '99 Muga white Rioja to sell by the glass, a tipoff that the producer has fielded a winner.</p>
        <p>Andre Jammet, an owner, finds that the wine goes with ''any fish, like salmon or cod; scallops or lobster; or any white meat -- veal, chicken, guinea hen.''</p>
        <p>Bodegas Muga, in the Rioja Alta region, is one of Spain's few traditionalists still rearing its wines wholly in oak. Indeed, an agreeably woody bouquet and flavor frame this barrel-fermented composition of native viura grapes with some malvasia.</p>
        <p>Fans of barrel-fermented California chardonnay are likely to be wooed by the vanillan, almost baked-apple aroma with its hints of smoked meat, the ample body and creamy texture, the almost honeyed flavor, the roundness.</p>
        <p>For optimum use, chill this bright, pale-brass-colored dry wine moderately and, in the casual manner of aficionados, keep swirling and sniffing it so that convection currents keep releasing its subtleties.</p>
        <p>In Manhattan, the wine costs $11 at Martin Brothers, 2781 Broadway (107th Street); $12 (with a 20 percent case discount through Sept. 9 in a city where the maximum tends to be 15 percent) at Union Square Wine and Spirits, 33 Union Square West (East 17th Street); $11 at SoHo Wines, 461 West Broadway (Houston Street.</p>
        <p>In Queens, the wine is $13 at Wine and Spirit Company, 108-50 Queens Boulevard (Continental Avenue), Forest Hills; in Brooklyn, it's $12 at Shawn, 141 Seventh Avenue (Carroll Street), Park Slope.</p>
        <p>Muga is brokered by Jorge Ordo'nez, whose portfolio of Spanish estates sets high standards for quality. Merchants can obtain the wine from Tempranillo, an importer and distributor, in Mamaroneck, N.Y.</p>
