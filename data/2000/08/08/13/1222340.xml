        <p>WHILE Ron Wyden was campaigning for the Senate in Oregon in 1996, a local newspaper ran a letter denouncing him as an ''Ashkenazi'' -- clearly a code word for Jew. It set off an uproar and some soul-searching in Oregon. How dare a responsible paper publish such anti-Semitism? But what happened next was instructive: the editors apologized, explaining that they had never heard the term and were unaware it could give offense.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wyden, whose parents fled Nazi Germany, is now the Democratic senator representing a state in which Jews account for less than 1 percent of the population. Oregon, by the way, is home to not a few militia members and black-helicopter conspiracy buffs. And yet, Mr. Wyden says he encountered only a ''small hard core'' of haters.</p>
        <p>The tale of Mr. Wyden bears retelling for those who reacted to the news of Al Gore's selection of Senator Joseph I. Lieberman as a running mate with the queasy suspicion that this just cannot be good for the Jews. Will it awaken the sleeping giant of anti-Semitism, they asked themselves? Will Jews be the scapegoats if the Gore-Lieberman ticket is defeated?</p>
        <p>Although bigotry thrives, Jews in this country have never before had so little reason to worry. The reason is that Jews are no longer considered ''the other'' in America.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Wyden found in Oregon, even where Jews are few, acceptance is at an all-time high. Americans typically either see Jews as neighbors or kin, or as objects of fascination, or have no experience with them at all. Paradoxically, the reasons have little to do with television hits like ''Seinfeld'' and everything to do with the nation's intense Christian faith. Visit the most conservative evangelical church in America today and you will hear from the pulpit mention of ''our Judeo-Christian heritage.'' President Ronald Reagan used the phrase in speeches, and the concept has been thoroughly assimilated by the religious right. Gary Bauer invoked it on the campaign trail.</p>
        <p>Mainline Protestants talk of Jews and Christians as ''people of the Book,'' the Old Testament that both faiths share. Pope John Paul II stood in a Roman synagogue and referred to Jews as ''our elder brothers,'' setting a tone for recon ciliation that has reverberated through the Roman Catholic Church.</p>
        <p>More than mere tokenism, this language represents a major shift. A broad swath of Christians in this country have begun to recognize, to study and even embrace the Jewish roots of their faith. Most Christians still believe that Jews would be better off accepting Christ, but respect for Jews who do not has grown substantially, scholars say.</p>
        <p>''I think there is a growing rapprochement and a sense of commonality,'' said Max L. Stackhouse, professor of Christian social ethics at Princeton Theological Seminary. ''Part of it has to do with the increased encounters with others of the world religions and the new sense of pluralism in this country.''</p>
        <p>In other words, to the average American Christian who sees Buddhist books on the best-seller list and Hindu temples rising in the suburbs, Jews seem downright familiar.</p>
        <p>''Jews are more like us,'' said Professor Stackhouse, summing up a common attitude among Christians. ''We feel greater affinity to those who are Jewish.''</p>
        <p>Another factor is intermarriage, each wedding vow a chink closing up the old religious divide. The 50 percent intermarriage rate that for 10 years has caused angst among Jews has a flip side: more and more Americans count a Jew in the family tree. When Uncle Michael goes upstairs to read the children a bedtime story, it becomes harder to regard Jews as ''the other.''</p>
        <p>But what really keeps many Jews awake at night is the fear that every new Jewish-sounding surname in the headlines only stokes the widely held conspiracy theories that the world is run by Jews.</p>
        <p>Someone who knows the conspiracy thinking well is Paul T. Coughlin, an evangelical Christian who wrote ''Secrets, Plots and Hidden Agendas'' (InterVarsity Press, 2000), because he was stunned by the amount of conspiratorial talk from callers to his Christian radio show in Oregon.</p>
        <p>''There are millions of people who feel that Jews control the economy through what's called the New World Order, and people on the far right argue that this is all dictated in the Book of Revelation where the Apostle John wrote about a world government,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But surprisingly, Mr. Coughlin said, even for a large majority of those believers -- all but the anti-Semitic and racist fringe -- Judaism is ''not an issue.''</p>
        <p>WHY? They believe that membership in the New World Order is determined ''more by ideology than heritage,'' he said. ''It's actually liberal elitists, the media, people in universities, who are going to control the New World Order.''</p>
        <p>Although liberal Jews are suspects, Senator Lieberman, as an Orthodox Jew who represents conservative family values, is not, Mr. Coughlin said. The senator may convince the conspiracy thinkers that ''Jewish'' and ''liberal'' are not synonymous, he said. He adds that many of these same Christian conspiracy thinkers actually venerate Jews because the Bible talks of God's covenant with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. ''It is actually beneficial for Lieberman to be Jewish,'' he said.</p>
        <p>This is not to claim that anti-Semitism has been eradicated, like smallpox. It lives on, mutates, makes people sick. Mr. Wyden says he received a heap of hate mail when, in a memorable moment broadcast on television, he asked a lineup of tobacco executives at a Congressional hearing whether nicotine is addictive. The anti-Semitic letters came mostly from those in tobacco-growing country, accusing him of destroying their livelihoods, but were filled with ''religious animus,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In the Midwest, the Rev. David Ostendorf, executive director of the Center for New Community in Chicago, said: ''We did a seminar a few months ago with five or six Chicago high schools, and when we asked how many of you have seen racist symbols like swastikas in your neighborhoods, 90 percent of the kids raised their hands. It kind of jarred us.''</p>
        <p>The selection of Senator Lieberman is likely to uncap a geyser of ugly extremism. Already, Internet message boards have been swamped with anti-Semitic postings. The head of the local chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in Dallas rambled on about greedy Jews on a talk show.</p>
        <p>The response was telling. Scores of people posted Internet messages expressing their disgust at anti-Semitism. The N.A.A.C.P. official was immediately dismissed.</p>
        <p>''You have your crazies,'' said Jerome A. Chanes, the editor of ''Anti-Semitism in America Today: Exploding the Myths'' (Carol Publishing, 1995). ''But in the year 2000, whatever anti-Semitism does exist does not compromise the ability of any Jew to participate in the workings of society at any level.''</p>
        <p>Gallup polls show that 92 percent of Americans say they would vote for a qualified Jew for president, up from 62 percent in 1958. Other polls that ask the question differently show similar results. Even if twice as many people are lying -- and respondents to polls gauging tolerance often do -- that is still a huge approval rating, Mr. Chanes said. The polls indicate that it is far worse to be a Mormon or an atheist running for office than a Jew.</p>
        <p>So why do polls also show that Jews see anti-Semitism as a serious problem in this country, and one likely to worsen? There is a generational divide, said Spencer Blakeslee, author of ''The Death of American Anti-Semitism'' (Praeger), between older, immigrant Jews who experienced the most vicious anti-Semitism and ''the post-World War II generation,'' for whom the Holocaust is history.</p>
        <p>A HEADLINE in last week's New York Observer rendered the divided response to the Lieberman candidacy partly in Yiddish: ''Alter Kockers Shaking, Pishers Are Thrilled.''</p>
        <p>''We have a lot of Jews walking around who are frightened at things they need not be frightened about,'' said Mr. Blakeslee, a sociologist at Framingham State College in Massachusetts. ''When in the world are Jews going to learn to take yes for an answer?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Wyden said that for him the challenge is ''not overt anti-Semitism or prejudice, but that there may be a significant number of people who have had little or no contact with Jews, aren't familiar with the Holocaust and so much of the history that Jews are sensitive to.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Wyden says he considers any campaign for a Jewish candidate to be ''a terrific opportunity, because the slate is clean.''</p>
