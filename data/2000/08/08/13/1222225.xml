        <p>THERE is something about lilies in a garden. With careful selection of them, bloom can be seen from the beginning of the summer months to earliest fall.</p>
        <p>But that was not always the case in my own garden. For many years I was most hesitant about giving lily bulbs a try. I had always admired them in other people's gardens but felt that those particular gardeners were rather advanced in knowledge to have such great success with their own lilies in bloom. For me, I thought, lily bulbs were just too difficult.</p>
        <p>I had always been taught that lily bulbs are never dormant, that they never sleep. (Which, by the way, is true). Because of this, I felt that they should be planted immediately upon receipt, in the fall months. But I always worried that it might be rainy or too cold to plant. As a result, no lily bulbs were ever tried.</p>
        <p>But now I have lilies abloom in many sizes, shapes and colors in my garden. Modern storage methods have made it possible to ship lily bulbs in fall or spring. Professionals have learned how to keep the bulbs from drying out. Gardeners can plant them in spring just as safely as in fall.</p>
        <p>That great sage of gardeners, Donald Wyman, notes in his ''Gardening Encyclopedia'' that ''within the past decade, lilies have come to the fore as one of the most popular and easily grown of the summer-flowering bulbs.''</p>
        <p>The flowers are not only spectacular to see, but they can be cut for a handsome floral decor in the house. Just one or two flowers is enough for a fine luncheon table display.</p>
        <p>The first of the lilies to bloom are the sorts that are shorter and usually grouped together as the Asiatic lilies. Most of these have flowers that are open faced, upright and in splendid shades of yellow, orange, red, pink, white and often blends of those colors.</p>
        <p>For the most part, these Asiatic lilies are short-stemmed, about three feet tall, so they do fit nicely into groups when placed in a perennial border. The best part is, the lily bulbs are perennials that seem to last for many, many years.</p>
        <p>Once the flowers have faded, it is a good idea to cut down the remnants, for the plants have given their all and do not add much to the border afterward. Their foliage is just there and not too dramatic.</p>
        <p>The later lilies belong to the Oriental group. These are the big, sometimes huge-flowered lilies. They can also be quite tall. The Oriental kinds look best at the back of the border or near a fence where their magnificent blooms on rather stately plants can be seen. Some of these lilies are extremely fragrant, too, adding another dimension to the pleasure.</p>
        <p>Many of these later-blooming lilies have recurved petals or pendant form or both, which makes them even more dramatic. Some have spots on the petals, others have frills or waves.</p>
        <p>Because there are from 150 to 200 species in the lily clan plus too numerous to mention hybrids, selection of particular lilies has to be left to personal taste. Or, notes can be taken when visiting gardens and nurseries to highlight particular favorites that can be ordered for later planting.</p>
        <p>After favorites are selected, and before the heart is set on having an impressive-looking lily display, two essentials must exist in the garden to be assured of winning. The soil must be well drained, and the ground must have a modicum of fertility.</p>
        <p>Good drainage is essential to these bulbs as they are highly susceptible to rot. The slightest lingering of moisture on these bulbs induces decay. Any moisture in the soil must be able to drain away easily.</p>
        <p>Also, lilies are big feeders, as are peonies, which are also planted in fall. Fertilizer is not the answer to correct a poor soil. It must be well endowed with organic matter and friable before any lily bulbs are considered for planting.</p>
        <p>Other than these two requirements, all should be well.</p>
        <p>Most lilies do best in some degree of sunlight rather than shade. But many a garden has gotten by with good lily bloom where there is some modicum of shade. Deep shade, of course, is out.</p>
        <p>Lilies are true lilies, members of the genus Lilium. Most them have come from Asia, although a few species belong to the Northeast. However, many garden plants are called lilies but they are not true lilies.</p>
        <p>Probably the one that seems to cause the most confusion is the day lily. This flower belongs to the genus Hemerocallis, a word derived from the Greek that roughly translated is ''beautiful for a day.''</p>
        <p>Although the flowers may look somewhat alike, the plant and foliage is entirely different.</p>
        <p>Here are some other lily impostors: lily of the valley (Convallaria), African lily (Agapanthus), fairy lily (Zephyranthes), spider lily (Nerine) and Mariposa lily (Calochortus).</p>
        <p>All of them are lovely to have around for their glorious blooms. But only the true lily deserves the proper claim to its own fame.</p>
