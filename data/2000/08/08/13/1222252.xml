        <p>AFTER Tanya Theriault spent spring break of her senior year of college in New York City, she was sure that she would not be applying to medical school. At least not right away. She had found a job that she felt compelled to take, even though it was grueling and carried no salary.</p>

        <p>AFTER Tanya Theriault spent spring break of her senior year of college in New York City, she was sure that she would not be applying to medical school. At least not right away. She had found a job that she felt compelled to take, even though it was grueling and carried no salary.</p>
        <p>''I couldn't wait,'' Ms. Theriault said. ''Finishing school became a formality.''</p>
        <p>So upon graduating from Boston College in 1997, she hopped a bus to the Lower East Side and moved into a Catholic Worker ''House of Hospitality'' at 55 East Third Street, near First Avenue.  Called Maryhouse, it is one of two brick tenements used by the New York contingent of the Catholic Worker, a 67-year-old charity founded in part by Dorothy Day, whom the Roman Catholic Church is now considering for sainthood. Like the other volunteers there, Ms. Theriault doles out soup, bread, clothes and beds to people in need.</p>
        <p>Not everyone she knew understood the move. ''Since she was 6 years old, she talked about being a doctor,'' her father, Ronald Theriault, recalled. ''She graduated in the top 15 percent of a class of 3,000 students.'' Some of her other relatives worried that she was wasting her degree on either a bout of religious mania or a showy act of youthful self-denial.</p>
        <p>Ms. Theriault had spent her spring break -- she wanted an alternative to the usual Florida bacchanal -- at the Worker's grubby buildings, which are incongruously located in the middle of a gentrifying area. She had observed the group's cluttered rooms and chaotic ways, and the Friday night discussions at which the cutting-edge topics were ''Cistercian Spirituality'' and ''The 1911 Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire -- Did Labor Legislation Make a Difference?'' She had witnessed an angry outburst or two. And she had noted how the group's rejection of most forms of technology -- an old computer that cranks out mailing labels is one of few conveniences -- meant days filled with repetitive manual labor.</p>
        <p>Although the place appealed to her, it also provoked a twinge of dread. She wondered,  ''Could I really live this life?''</p>
        <p>She didn't mind the tumult so much as the  lack of privacy in the houses, where volunteers live along with the destitute residents and so ''have to put the game face on'' as soon as they leave their rooms. She also had doubts about the food, which varies in quality and often suggests summer camp, and  about the lack of air-conditioning.</p>
        <p>''It's gross, it's so gross,'' she said of humid summer days. ''It puts people in a bad mood.''</p>
        <p>But Ms. Theriault, whose seriousness is leavened by youthful optimism, moved in anyway.</p>
        <p>She ditched the trappings of her first-rate education and her life as one of two children in a middle-class family in Rumford, Me., a mill town. While her friends earned graduate degrees or took professional jobs, Ms. Theriault, whose father works in a boys' home, scrubbed dented aluminum pots and escorted homeless women to health clinics.</p>
        <p>In so doing, Ms. Theriault joined the religiously inspired movement that Ms. Day and Peter Maurin, an itinerant French intellectual, founded in 1933 by starting The Catholic Worker, a newspaper, and aiding the homeless.</p>
        <p>Against all prediction, the paper still sells for a penny a copy and Maryhouse and St. Joseph House, the group's other shelter in the city, at 36 East First Street, still operate nearly two decades after Day's death in 1980 at age 83. Indeed, the group today counts more than 100 shelters and farming communes here and abroad.</p>
        <p>LIKE a beggar at a ball, the Catholic Worker strives to be a contradiction to the mores of modern New York. ''Everybody can't just be a self-interest maximizer,'' said Bill Griffin, a pediatric nurse practitioner with a monk's haircut and a fondness for abstract speaking, who has volunteered at the Worker for 25 years. ''It's insufficient as our definition of a person.''</p>
        <p>The Worker seems to be a self-interest minimizer. It accepts no money from foundations, government agencies or the Catholic Church. It maintains no savings account because it contends that earning interest is usury. It does not register with the state as a nonprofit agency, which would make contributions to it tax-deductible. In fact, it relies entirely on providential windfalls, which can come in the form of day-old doughnuts, a few wrinkled bills in the mail or volunteers like Tanya Theriault.</p>
        <p>After a few months at Maryhouse, Ms. Theriault moved to St. Joseph House. For her labors she gets room, board and $10 a week in ''ice cream money,'' which she prefers to call ''beer and cigarette money.'' (''Don't tell my parents,'' she said.)</p>
        <p>To make her student loan payments, she works eight hours a week at a nearby government-financed shelter for the homeless. This job exposes her to secular social-work culture, which she is quick to contrast with Catholic Worker methods.</p>
        <p>''It's a whole different system of how to treat people,'' Ms. Theriault said. ''There are case managers and psychiatrists. There's a lot of paperwork.'' At the Worker, she pointed out, there are no intake forms or means tests for the men and women invited to join the ''house family'' of some 60 residents, some of whom stay until death.</p>
        <p>''It's more intimate care,'' she said. ''We bathe them and wash their clothes. We take them to the doctor.''</p>
        <p>The Catholic Worker is not a place to dabble in such works of charity. Dorothy Day herself said that the best way to serve the poor is to join them in poverty, which she herself did for 50 years. Pat Jordan, an editor at Commonweal, a lay Catholic magazine, worked closely with her when he lived at the Catholic Worker from 1969 to 1975. Yet even he is not sure how she stuck it out. As he wrote in a recent reflection on her spirituality in Commonweal, ''How Dorothy Day managed to keep her psychological wholeness over the years in the disorder, disease, mental confusion and violence that mark Catholic Worker houses was a practical miracle to me.'' Then he recalled one of her mottoes: ''Pray and endure.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Theriault has been at the Catholic Worker for three years now. She said the experience has cured her of all world-altering ambition. ''It's ridiculous to think that you can right the wrongs of what people have been through,'' she said. ''All you can do is offer some soup, meet a person's request with some sort of understanding, and try not to lose your temper. It's the small stuff.''</p>
        <p>She said that at least some who viewed her joining as a mistake no longer do so. But some have replaced their alarm with a misunderstanding: they romanticize her commitment. ''They'd like to think that I gave up everything,'' she said recently as she adjusted a bandage on her foot where a cheap sandal had rubbed the skin red. ''But they don't know that there is also laughter and high points here.''  One high point: a fistful of blue ''deli daisies'' that a housemate nicknamed Whiskers gave her two weeks ago as a 25th-birthday present.</p>
        <p>Dorothy Day herself confused people when she began the Catholic Worker movement at age 35 in an aparment on East 15th Street. Eugene O'Neill and other bohemian friends thought she had gone over to the forces of reaction.</p>
        <p>Before converting to Catholicism at age 30, Day had been a journalist for socialist publications like The Masses and The Call, where her colleagues included Max Eastman and John Reed. She was also part of the hard-partying Provincetown Playhouse crowd, which drank away much of the 1920's at a Village saloon called the Hell Hole.</p>
        <p>During that time, she had an abortion, which she mourned for the rest of her life, and was divorced. In 1927 she gave birth to a daughter, Tamar. But when she insisted on having the child baptized in a kind of dry run for her own entrance into the Catholic Church, the baby's father, an anarchist and nonbeliever, bitterly broke with her.</p>
        <p>This is not the classic resume of a defender of the faith. For many years the church did not support Day or the Catholic Worker. In the 1950's, it even asked her to remove the word ''Catholic'' from the name of the newspaper, which she politely refused to do. But over time she proved her loyalty on questions of moral doctrine, like its ban on married and female priests. Simultaneously, the largely immigrant Catholic Church in America grew more secure in its cultural standing. And eventually, it allowed that Day's social activism on issues like labor and civil rights might be legitimate.</p>
        <p>Then last year, Cardinal John J. O'Connor completed a remarkable reversal in ecclesiastical thinking by asking Pope John Paul II to consider Day for sainthood.</p>
        <p>''Dorothy Day is a saint,'' the Cardinal, who died May 3, wrote in February, in his final column in Catholic New York, the archdiocesan weekly. ''Not just a 'gingerbread' saint or a 'holy card' saint but a modern-day devoted daughter of the Church'' whose work on behalf of the poor stands as ''the hallmark of her life.'' On March 16, the Congregation for Sainthood at the Vatican announced that the pope had accepted the cardinal's request and named Dorothy Day a ''Servant of God'' -- the first step in the often decades-long canonization process.</p>
        <p>By taking this action, the church is implicitly recommending Day's vision of what constitutes a good and meaningful life. The matter is controversial, especially at the Catholic Worker, where some worry that the search for miracles and other saint-making procedures will denature the Dorothy Day they knew: the foe of unrestrained capitalism and the pacifist who attended daily Mass but did not shy from criticizing the church on issues of social justice.</p>
        <p>The Catholic Worker abides no shrines to its founder. Except for a batch of photos in a  Maryhouse office, it displays few pictures of Dorothy Day. The battered walls are covered instead with fliers and news clips and portraits of Cesar Chavez, Teresa of Avila and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.</p>
        <p>Two kinds of photos of Day hang in the Maryhouse office. The first are published  shots, and one of the most famous shows  Day taking part, in her 70's, in a United Farm Workers sit-in in California. She wears scuffed shoes and a plain dress and is framed by the gun-holstered hips of a pair of policemen who are closing in to arrest her.</p>
        <p>And then there are the private scenes. Day reads to her grandchildren or pecks away at a typewriter on a fourth-hand desk. These glimpses of the ''real'' Dorothy Day  are important, Ms. Theriault said. ''The New York Catholic Worker has people who knew her personally,'' she said. ''So the legend is played down here.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Theriault acknowledged that the group gets its share of poverty tourists and spiritual adventurers, mostly the young who want to emulate Day. But in the opinion of Jane Sammon, a 25-year volunteer, the daily grind tends to weed out the naive. ''Dorothy used to say it's the pinpricks of community that wear you down,'' she recalled. ''I agree. But I say they're more like machete blows.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Sammon, however, is one of those who perform the kindnesses that make communal life possible -- gently putting drops into the eyes of an elderly woman, for example, and listening sympathetically to the disjointed complaints of another.</p>
        <p>As to which volunteers have staying power, Mr. Griffin said: ''I don't want to get religious on you. But you can't do this work without spiritual resources.'' Those who last longest tend to share a religious commitment with other members. They go to Mass together on Sundays and hold vespers on most weeknights, followed by conversation over coffee and donated cookies.</p>
        <p>STILL, there is no litmus test for joining. Many volunteers are non-Catholic or follow no particular faith. One was the writer Michael Harrington, who lived at Maryhouse in the early 1950's. After leaving, he wrote ''The Other America,'' a classic examination of poverty in the United States. Still others, like the novelist and New York memoirist Dan Wakefield, attended Worker events and were stimulated by its radical philosophy.</p>
        <p>Robert Coles, the Harvard psychiatrist, volunteered on the soup line about the same time as Mr. Harrington, then 25 years later wrote a biography of Day. In it, she speaks about the Good Samaritan's tendency toward smugness. ''A person can start out aiming to be righteous,'' she told him, ''and end up self-righteous.''</p>
        <p>For her part, Ms. Theriault said she must guard against looking down on those who volunteer mainly to feel good about themselves. ''I try not to judge them,'' she said.  But she also worries that her own intensity might keep her away from all but the most devoted of her peers.</p>
        <p>''The Worker can be an insulated circle,'' she added. ''I have friends who say: 'You have to start dating. You have to get back to the real world. You're going to forget how to do it.' '' But then a pipe will break or a housemate will fall ill and before she knows it, another week has passed.</p>
        <p>IN fact, she admitted, she has probably passed the point of applying to medical school. ''Anyway,'' she said, ''I'm not sure that's the best way of healing people.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Theriault says he has reconciled himself to his daughter's chosen path, in part because he knows she has inherited his stubbornness. ''She sometimes gets exhausted,'' he said. ''We can hear it in her voice when we talk on the phone. We say: 'You've got to take it easy.' ''</p>
        <p>In truth, there are not enough workers at the Worker. (The joke at Maryhouse is that Dorothy Day's first miracle should be that the Catholic Worker somehow still exists.) During recent visits, several members whispered, ''Please mention that we need more people.''</p>
        <p>The group also faces questions about whether it should continue to pursue its mission in a neighborhood rife with achingly chic eateries and self-conscious sculpture gardens. In 1968, when the Worker moved into its current buildings, the area bulged with immigrants and hippies; in the 80's, it was a crossroads for the crack and heroin trades. But now it no longer seems odd that gleaming limousines pull up two doors down from St. Joseph House and disgorge models and celebrities in front of Chez Es Saada, a hip Moroccan restaurant.</p>
        <p>Carmen Trotta, a 12-year volunteer, recalled that last year a wedding party rolled up to the brown metal door of St. Joseph House, thinking it was a nearby trendy catering hall. He said a parade of gowned and bow-tied guests, some holding glasses of Champagne, began marching through the door before they realized their mistake and quickly exited.</p>
        <p>Such fish-out-of-water scenes reveal a problem for the group, some of whom feel it is they, and not the area's well-heeled visitors, who are now the fish. Some Workers feel pulled to move to a poorer neighborhood where their services are more manifestly needed. Others feel pushed by newcomers who object to the line that forms four mornings a week outside the soup kitchen at St. Joseph House.</p>
        <p>Mr. Griffin said that a resident of a new co-op on East First Street recently motioned toward the line and asked him, ''Why don't you move to the Bronx?''</p>
        <p>One man who would miss them is Richard Peterson, 63, who said a gambling addiction landed him in a hotel on the Bowery many years ago. He habitually stops at the soup kitchen -- the Worker serves 800 to 1,000 meals a week -- on his way to play speed chess for cash in Washington Square Park. Standing on the mottled sidewalk outside St. Joseph House one morning, he said he liked the Worker because it fed him without trying to save his soul. ''This is considered a safe place for those who want a good and wholesome bowl of soup -- and to get away without being hassled,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Griffin also sees a logic in staying put despite the area's growing affluence. ''Dorothy Day was canny about being in Manhattan,'' he said, because the Worker's commitment to its brand of Gospel literalism -- sell all your possessions and serve the poor -- can be witnessed by so many. He added that the Workers are an argumentative lot, and  might just stay put because of a lack of consensus on any alternative.</p>
        <p>Ms. Theriault said she wouldn't mind staying. ''I came to the Catholic Worker to attempt to make an honest life,'' she said, part of which means serving as an obscure but nagging irritant to the conscience of New York. ''I made a decision in my heart.''</p>
