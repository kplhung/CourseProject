        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>During 30 years of living in the suburbs I've noticed an increasing intolerance.</p>
        <p>People seem horrendously offended by trivia. There was a campaign against people putting mangers on public property at Christmas time. There was an uproar over the way some guy decorated the exterior of his house. Over in New Canaan there was a fight because the water company sold some privately owned land to a builder who wanted to put several homes on it. All perfectly legal, all within the zoning regulations -- but someone didn't want it.</p>

        <p>During 30 years of living in the suburbs I've noticed an increasing intolerance.</p>
        <p>People seem horrendously offended by trivia. There was a campaign against people putting mangers on public property at Christmas time. There was an uproar over the way some guy decorated the exterior of his house. Over in New Canaan there was a fight because the water company sold some privately owned land to a builder who wanted to put several homes on it. All perfectly legal, all within the zoning regulations -- but someone didn't want it.</p>
        <p>Now there's a campaign against cell towers -- which I think have not been thoughtfully evaluated. The brouhaha in Scarsdale is particularly bizarre.</p>
        <p>So I'd like to say a word in favor of towers.</p>
        <p>Towers have been an architectural ornament in the past going back to Cleopatra's needle. Then there's Nelson's monument. There's a couple of towers in parks in New York. I shouldn't forget the Indian's totem poles or the Washington monument. And how about the Eiffel Tower, which is right in the center of the most prosperous districts in Paris? Or the Arc de Triomphe, which is kind of a bent-over tower.</p>
        <p>To the tower in Scarsdale, I say why not?</p>
        <p>Perhaps they could improve the design. I'd like to see a little restaurant like the Eiffel Tower has about 75 feet up. If they put an apron on it like they have on the Space Needle in Seattle, the view would be fabulous.  If the deck were wide enough, you could get 20 or 30 tables on it. Maybe McDonald's would come in. Then we'd have both the Eiffel and the Arc.</p>
