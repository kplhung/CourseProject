        <p>As Asian fever, cowboy cool, 60's modernism and vintage kitsch are all touching down on the fashion tarmac, a new fleet of books is taking off, on the quirkiest notions of chic. Style monitors have ventured to far-flung corners and brought back Ferlin Husky's dog-sled-embroidered jacket add Suzie Wong's signature cheongsam deress. The coffee table is groaning.</p>
        <p>Mao Knew This Would Happen</p>
        <p>Between the red plastic covers of ''China Chic,'' Vivienne Tam creates what she calls a visual memoir, which she uses to examine the cultural influence of China on world style. Ms. Tam, a fashion designer who was born in Canton, China, and now lives in New York, goes way beyond embroidered silk. The richly illustrated volume, due in November (Regan Books/Harper Collins; $50), brings together tradition and pop culture -- wedding ceremonies and ''The World of Suzie Wong,'' Ming furniture and Mao jackets -- as it explores East-meets-West style. Each chapter introduces a different Chinese character, followed by a personal anecdote. Child's Heart, the symbol of child and woman, provides an occasion for the tale of how Ms. Tam was smuggled into Hong Kong when she was 3. Chinglish is the hybrid language she spoke as a teenager.</p>
