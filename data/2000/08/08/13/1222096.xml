        <p>AS the rain-soaked summer wears on, a cadre of scholars have immersed themselves in sinister goings-on at the Vanderbilt Planetarium here.</p>
        <p>Three behavioral scientists, Dr. Christina Beaumont, Dr. Alfred Walker and Dr. Elaine Wodahs, have reached a threshold in their study of man, time and consciousness, which will soon be made public at a lecture at the planetarium. Along with Detective Peter Isles, against a backdrop of murder and supernatural mayhem, they are about to unlock some scary, forbidden secrets.</p>
        <p>But wait, isn't Dr. Walker the villainous Lex Luthor from the ''Lois and Clark'' television series? And Dr. Beaumont is a dead ringer for April O'Neill from the ''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'' movies. And Detective Isles? He was the father on ''The Wonder Years.'' Welcome to Hollywood East.</p>
        <p>''The Empath,'' a supernatural crime thriller filmed on Long Island by Long Islanders, is the brainchild of Eric Koenig of Centerport. He is the founder and creative director of Eric Koenig Studios Inc., EKSI, a two-year-old design, development and holding firm based in Huntington.</p>
        <p>Mr. Koenig's business partner, David Lowell Sonkin, 33, of Merrick, is the film's co-writer, director and executive producer. He won best feature honors at the 1999 Long Island International Film Exposition for his low-budget film ''Friends, First and Foremost.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Koenig estimates that up to one-half of the mostly female staff and crew are from Long Island, including the film's producer, Karie Koppel of Westbury. Financing also came from local sources like Gary Brustein, owner of Champion Motor Group in Huntington.</p>
        <p>Most of the locations are local as well -- the Vanderbilt Museum and Planetarium (now celebrating its 50th anniversary), the DeSeversky Conference Center in Old Westbury, and St. Paul's Lutheran Church and the American Legion Hall in Amityville.</p>
        <p>Victoria Hawes, location manager, said her directive from Mr. Sonkin was, ''The more we're on Long Island, the happier I am.''</p>
        <p>What makes the Island so appealing for filmmakers, she said, is ''its diversity and natural resources.''</p>
        <p>''The mansions in the north, the picturesque towns in the south,'' Ms. Hawes said. ''And since this is new to the Island, everyone is still very accommodating.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sonkin, who believes that Long Island filmmakers have an identifiable approach, said: ''I can't imagine a better palette for locations and talent. The cultural foundation inspires wonderful character-based stories.''</p>
        <p>The almost month-long filming has been a positive experience for local actors and production crew. Michael Carbonaro, 24, of Oakdale, was hired to play Young Doctor No. 2.</p>
        <p>''This has been great fun,'' said the actor, who has been an extra on several locally filmed episodes of ''The Sopranos.'' ''And it's even better not to commute into the city.''</p>
        <p>Dennis Widmyer, 23, of Hicksville is a production assistant who says he learned more during shooting ''The Empath'' than in all his years at school. ''This is a perfect setup,'' he said. ''It's below Miramax but it's bigger than the typical renegade indie project.''</p>
        <p>Like many other project participants, a plus for Mr. Widmyer is working on cutting-edge high-definition video. The process is cheaper, takes a shorter time to film, is easier to edit and looks good in the final cut.</p>
        <p>Dan Luria of Lindenhurst, who played the father on ''The Wonder Years,'' jumped at the chance to return home to work. The actor, who plays Detective Isles, is not a fan of the sci-fi genre, but he chose this role, he said, because he ''liked the idea of high-definition digital filming, liked the character, it was shooting on Long Island, and I have faith in David Sonkin.''</p>
        <p>In addition to Mr. Luria, the actors include Chris Lemmon of the television series ''Duet,'' Paige Turco of ''Ninja Turtles'' and ''Party of Five,'' and John Shea, the former Lex Luthor who won an Emmy for ''Baby M.''</p>
        <p>Hans Zimmer's award-winning music-scoring team is also a first-class catch. They worked on two recent blockbusters: ''Gladiator'' and ''Mission Impossible 2.'' Even the vice president of finance, Adam Cinque, has credentials; he was the former senior manager of the marketing department for Miramax.</p>
        <p>As independent films achieve greater status (thanks to blockbuster hits like the ''Blair Witch Project,'' which cost $22,000 to produce and generated more than $140 million in domestic revenue) and similar supernatural-thriller themes draw crowds (think ''Sixth Sense''), filmmakers like Mr. Sonkin, his wife and co-producer, Michele, Ms. Koppel and Mr. Koenig have high hopes for the future.</p>
        <p>Mr. Koenig says that he temporarily bounced two other film projects because the potential for ''The Empath'' was so great.</p>
        <p>Independent films can make large profits. With a budget of $843,648, ''The Empath'' is projecting $5 million in income. Most of the cast and crew work for scale and a share of the profits. Total crew salary is only $24,000, and the entire cast is being paid a total of $68,000, a fee Mr. Shea, alone, can earn for a fraction of the time he's spending on ''The Empath'' if he were in a major film or television production. But these sacrifices are made for many reasons, including the appeal of the film, the lure of independent filmmaking and the great profit that can be earned on the back end on domestic distribution rights, television, cable, video, DVD and foreign sales.</p>
        <p>The next step is to create a trailer to rein in the distribution deals Mr. Koenig hopes will enable ''major theatrical release in as many theaters as possible'' by early next year. Entering festivals like Cannes and Sundance is part of the strategy.</p>
        <p>Last Monday was day 20 of shooting. In the planetarium, they were readying the big lecture scene. Mr. Shea was asking Mr. Sonkin for character motivation (yes, that really does happen). A few minutes later 20 extras entered the auditorium. Ms. Turco, who plays ''smart, sexy'' Dr. Beaumont, enters for her scene and after the fifth take complains about the pacing. Hollywood had come to Long Island.</p>
        <p>''I'm betting on this,'' Mr. Luria said. ''Long Island is very lucky to have someone like David Sonkin. He just might create an industry out here.''</p>
