        <p>Q I have been living in a rent-stabilized apartment for more than 25 years and for most of that time the lease was in my name only. I married about eight years ago and added my wife's name to the lease. Since she did not change her former name, the lease is now in both my name and her name. For approximately four years we have been paying the rent under my wife's name. Recently, however, the landlord called and said he will no longer accept checks in my wife's name. He also eliminated my wife's name from our monthly rent bill. Is it legal for our landlord to refuse a rent check with my wife's name after accepting it for all these years? . . . Walter H. Lamont, Manhattan.</p>
        <p>A Colleen F. McGuire, a Manhattan landlord-tenant lawyer, said that the Rent Stabilization Code provides that a tenant's spouse may be added to a lease as an additional tenant when the spouse uses the apartment as his or her primary residence. Accordingly, Ms. McGuire said, the landlord has a legal obligation to add the letter writer's wife's name to the lease if the apartment is her primary residence.</p>

        <p>Q I have been living in a rent-stabilized apartment for more than 25 years and for most of that time the lease was in my name only. I married about eight years ago and added my wife's name to the lease. Since she did not change her former name, the lease is now in both my name and her name. For approximately four years we have been paying the rent under my wife's name. Recently, however, the landlord called and said he will no longer accept checks in my wife's name. He also eliminated my wife's name from our monthly rent bill. Is it legal for our landlord to refuse a rent check with my wife's name after accepting it for all these years? . . . Walter H. Lamont, Manhattan.</p>
        <p>A Colleen F. McGuire, a Manhattan landlord-tenant lawyer, said that the Rent Stabilization Code provides that a tenant's spouse may be added to a lease as an additional tenant when the spouse uses the apartment as his or her primary residence. Accordingly, Ms. McGuire said, the landlord has a legal obligation to add the letter writer's wife's name to the lease if the apartment is her primary residence.</p>
        <p>In fact, Ms. McGuire said, since the wife's name was added to the lease eight years ago, there does not appear to be any legal justification for the landlord to remove her name from the rent bill or to refuse to accept rent checks from her.</p>
        <p>''If she wants to, the wife can continue to tender the rent checks in her name each and every month,'' Ms. McGuire said. ''Either the landlord will begin to cash the checks, which would be the desired result, or he will continue to reject them and commence a nonpayment proceeding.''</p>
        <p>In the latter case, she said, the tenant can use the tendering of the checks as a defense to the suit. In all likelihood, Ms. McGuire said, the court will find in favor of the tenant and chastise, or even sanction, the landlord for engaging in frivolous litigation.</p>
        <p>The Code on Electrical Wiring</p>
        <p>Q Recently, we accidentally turned off the air-conditioner in our bedroom and then turned it on again without waiting three minutes as recommended in the owner's manual. The power surge caused a fuse to blow, which turned off the lights and outlets in the bedroom, bathroom and kitchen. The only lights that remained on were the ones in the living room. We are wondering if the refrigerator should have its own circuit and what the proper circuitry should be for an apartment that has one bedroom, a living room, a kitchen and a bathroom. Although the fuse box seems to have space for six fuses, only two seem to be active. . . . Sally Greenberg, Manhattan.</p>
        <p>A Ilyse Fink, a spokeswoman for the New York City Department of Buildings, said that the condition described by the letter writer is both common and legal in older buildings.  Ms. Fink explained that under the current Electrical Code, in newer buildings and in buildings that are being completely renovated, there must be separate individual circuits installed for kitchen appliances, air-conditioners and general lighting.</p>
        <p>''That means that for older buildings, unless or until there is a voluntary upgrade of the wiring, the condition like the one described by the letter writer would be grandfathered and would not be in violation of the Electrical Code,'' she said. Ms. Fink added that the requirement for separate circuits for kitchen appliances went into effect in 1957, and the requirement for separate circuits for air-conditioners was instituted in 1964.</p>
