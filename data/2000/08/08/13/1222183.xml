        <p>As Asian fever, cowboy cool, 60's modernism and vintage kitsch are all touching down on the fashion tarmac, a new fleet of books is taking off, on the quirkiest notions of chic. Style monitors have ventured to far-flung corners and brought back Ferlin Husky's dog-sled-embroidered jacket add Suzie Wong's signature cheongsam deress. The coffee table is groaning.</p>
        <p>This Is Serious Art</p>
        <p>Once derided as kitsch, mass-produced paintings of exotic beauties and cutesy pets are now considered highly collectible. And in ''Just Above the Mantelpiece: Mass Market Masterpieces,'' Wayne Hemingway, a fashion designer, reassesses talents like Vladimir Tretchikoff, J. H. Lynch and Margaret Keane, whose big-eyed waifs define the genre. Due in October from Booth-Clibborn Editions ($49.95), the book features 300 works from the author's own collection. As co-founder of the British label Red or Dead, Mr. Hemingway was an arbiter of cool in the early 90's. His imprimatur is sure to lend new cachet to supermarket art -- and increased value to his own tacky cache.</p>
