        <p>It has always been an open secret here, though one that is not supposed to be shared with outsiders.

        <p>It has always been an open secret here, though one that is not supposed to be shared with outsiders. So when a recent consumer survey of 30 countries concluded that Venezuelans, men and women alike, are the most vain people in the world, the results were considered a bit embarrassing, but hardly surprising.</p>
        <p>''Of course it is true,'' said Marga Bermudez, a salesclerk in a busy beauty products store at a shopping center in a middle-class area here. ''How could it be otherwise? Ours is a country renowned for its beauty queens, and so we are always, always worrying about our appearance.''</p>
        <p>Whether gauged by President Hugo Chavez extolling the comeliness of the Venezuelan woman in speeches or the magazines that trace the careers of the growing number of Venezuelan male models who are achieving success abroad, this is a society that sets an extraordinary stock on looking good. Rich and poor, women and men, young and old -- all are expected to make themselves as attractive as possible, no matter what the cost to their pocketbook or body.</p>
        <p>According to the market research study, 65 percent of Venezuelan women and 47 percent of men admitted that they think about their looks  ''all the time.'' Russian women, at 51 percent, and Mexican men, 40 percent, finished second in the survey, conducted last year by Roper Starch Worldwide, while just 27 percent of American women and 17 percent of American men were recorded as saying that their appearance was always on their minds.</p>
        <p>To Osmel Sousa, those findings merely prove that Venezuelans have more discerning tastes than other mortals. Mr. Sousa may well be in a position to know: as director of the Miss Venezuela pageant he is ''the Pygmalion of our national mythology,'' in the words of the sociologist Tulio Hernandez, and the one person most responsible for establishing the ideals of physical attractiveness for which Venezuelans aim.</p>
        <p>''You can find vain people everywhere, but I don't think the Venezuelan people as a whole are especially vain,'' he said in an interview here, cutting a dapper figure himself in a white suit and white shoes. ''What you have here is people paying a lot of attention to and investing a lot of effort in their personal appearance, in looking good and dressing well. We're not vain here so much as we are lovers of beauty.''</p>
        <p>Maybe so, but the effort to cultivate an attractive exterior seems to go to unusual lengths here, compared even with other Latin American countries that have a narcissistic image, such as Brazil or Colombia. A Spanish businessman, for instance, said that of the three maids who work in his household, two have already had plastic surgery and the third is saving up money for an operation, a phenomenon that he said would be ''unthinkable'' in his native land.</p>
        <p>''The day before the election, I had to work until midnight,'' recalled Souky Villalobos, a 25-year-old hairdresser who works at a chic upscale salon, referring to the July 30 presidential vote here. ''My customers knew that they were going to have to stand in line for several hours to vote the next day, and they wanted to make sure they looked good while they were waiting.''</p>
        <p>Despite the country's vast oil wealth, more than 80 percent of Venezuela's population of 23 million people continue to live below the poverty line. Yet when it comes to looking their best, there seems to be little difference between the rich and the much poorer.</p>
        <p>''Board a bus even in the most humble of neighborhoods, and it reeks of perfume,'' said Gladys Duque Cabrera, a hairdresser in Catia, a working-class area here. ''Venezuelans would rather not eat than not look elegant.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, market researchers here estimate that the average Venezuelan household spends a fifth of its income on personal care and grooming products.</p>
        <p>Last year, the Venezuelan economy contracted by more than 7 percent as a result of the worst recession in years, but while sales of some basic foodstuffs fell, several companies actually reported increases in sales of cosmetics and similar products.</p>
        <p>''When times are bad, you want to look good,'' explained Alberto Armas Crespo, a construction worker, showing a reporter the cologne he carries in his lunch box. ''Otherwise where is the fun in living?''</p>
        <p>Many reasons have been offered to explain why the cult of beauty is more intense here than elsewhere. More often than not, the explanations end up focusing on the longstanding national obsession with beauty pageants and the distraction they provide from a host of social and economic problems.</p>
        <p>''You show your passport when you go overseas, and the immigration agents always say 'Oh, you're from the country of the beauty queens,' '' said Andreina Fuentes, 33, a museum employee. ''It's difficult to be a woman anywhere, but there is added stress in being a Venezuelan woman because you are expected to look perfect on every occasion.''</p>
        <p>As Mr. Hernandez sees it, ''the apprenticeship process'' of being obsessed with one's personal appearance ''begins at the most tender of young ages, with the election of a Carnival queen in every classroom of every school.'' Sports teams, private clubs, and professional associations also elect their beauty queens, not to mention ''neighborhood, city and state fairs and festivals,'' he added, and even the occasional women's prison.</p>
        <p>''Maybe we bear a bit of the blame,'' Mr. Sousa conceded. ''The contest is something that is always promoted for many months before the event and sets standards of how to look good and encourages the public to rate the girls in terms of their attractiveness.''</p>
        <p>In recent years, a ''Mr. Venezuela'' pageant has also become popular. Though it may only be a coincidence, a simultaneous surge in the number of men enrolling in aerobics and other exercise programs, tinting their hair and using colognes has been reported.</p>
        <p>''Our women are so beautiful that you are in danger of being overshadowed when you are standing alongside them,'' said Alejandro Otamendi, a 25-year-old security guard. ''So yes, it is only natural that men should also paying more attention to the way they look.''</p>
        <p>A recent museum exhibition here brought the national fascination with beauty under critical scrutiny. Called ''90-60-90,'' the metric equivalent of the 36-24-36 figure that is considered to be the feminine ideal here, it drew record crowds to see items that included photographs of ''Miss Cloaca,'' a contestant in an imaginary ''alternative'' Miss Venezuela pageant, as well as a work made from the fat extracted from liposuction operations.</p>
        <p>But it was the display of the four Miss Universe and five Miss World crowns won by Venezuelan beauty queens that seemed to most fascinate the public. ''To the extent that the country sinks into poverty and violence,'' Alfons Hug, a curator, told the daily El Nacional when the show opened in May, ''the star of the Miss rises higher, shines brighter and gains importance in society.''</p>
