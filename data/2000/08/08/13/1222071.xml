        <p>PERHAPS more than for any other people, music has been an integral part of the lives of Africans. Whether it has been the chants of boatmen on the Niger, or the sound of the kora (a kind of lute) played by a griot as he recites the history and genealogy of a people, or the brassy horns and vibrant rhythm sections of a contemporary band in a Lagos nightspot, Africans -- and their descendants in the diaspora -- always seem surrounded by music. So it hardly comes as a surprise for a museum curator to decide that traditional African instruments should not only be listened to but looked at.</p>
        <p>That is the point of ''Audible Artwork: Selected African Musical Instruments,'' a pleasant though rather modest exhibit showing here at the National Museum of African Art through April 8.

        <p>PERHAPS more than for any other people, music has been an integral part of the lives of Africans. Whether it has been the chants of boatmen on the Niger, or the sound of the kora (a kind of lute) played by a griot as he recites the history and genealogy of a people, or the brassy horns and vibrant rhythm sections of a contemporary band in a Lagos nightspot, Africans -- and their descendants in the diaspora -- always seem surrounded by music. So it hardly comes as a surprise for a museum curator to decide that traditional African instruments should not only be listened to but looked at.</p>
        <p>That is the point of ''Audible Artwork: Selected African Musical Instruments,'' a pleasant though rather modest exhibit showing here at the National Museum of African Art through April 8. Mounted, encased in glass and subtly lighted, the wooden rasps, gongs, rattles, drums, thumb piano and whistles that make up the exhibit shed their utilitarian mien, presenting themselves as objects of art.</p>
        <p>Music seems to be a prevalent theme for the Smithsonian Institution this summer. Across the garden from the Museum of African Art, the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery is presenting ancient Chinese instruments in an exhibit called ''Music in the Time of Confucius.'' Not far away, the National Museum of American History is sponsoring ''300 Years of the Piano.'' It seems as though the museums are striving to make up for this city's discordant political rhetoric with a reminder that life is often harmonious.</p>
        <p>Compared to these other exhibits of musical instruments, the small scale -- 11 pieces -- of ''Audible Artwork'' gives the Museum of African Art's effort a kind of ''me too'' quality. Still, it is worth the time minutes it takes to enjoy, not only for the beauty of the instruments but also as a primer on the breadth of African art.</p>
        <p>''I think most people tend to think of African art only in terms of masks, figures and drums,'' said Bryna Freyer, the exhibit's curator. ''I think it's getting better in that regard because of our museum and other museums like us. The fact that we put on shows of pottery, and small personal objects and musical instruments, tends to say to people out there: 'Hello! This is art work! This is important!' ''</p>
        <p>There is an opportunity to listen to the instruments, of course. The exhibit provides a station with headphones that allows a visitor to hear traditional drumming by the Ga peoples of Ghana, a song accompanied by a five-string harp fashioned by the Zande people of the northeast Congo and a harvest celebration in Burkina Faso featuring xylophones, gourd drums and whistles.</p>
        <p>But the exhibit's point is visual, not auditory, and each of the pieces is presented in elegant simplicity. As visitors enter the exhibit room at the bottom of a staircase on the second level of the underground museum, they immediately see two sistrums, a kind of rattle. The first, fashioned by the Bamana people of Mali, is made of wood and gourds. With the pie-shaped gourds hanging on the end of a polished stick that itself resembles a wishbone, the Bamana sistrum looks like a mushroom doubled over from a punch to the gut. It is unadorned, like those that accompany the chants of young Bamana boys as they march to be initiated into the n'tomo youth association. Once they have gone through this rite of passage on the way to manhood, their sistrums would be decorated with grass fibers.</p>
        <p>On a slightly more grand scale is the sistrum used to mark time in an Ethiopian Orthodox Church service. Grasped with a handle made of horn, the sistrum has two ornate copper alloy pillars, each topped with an onion-shaped dome. The intricate working of the brass is a testament to the craftsmanship of the late 19th and early 20thcentury artisans.</p>
        <p>Dominating the exhibit is a large drum made around 1935 by the Ghanaian artist Oseil Bonsu, perhaps the most important Asante sculptor of the 20th century, who is well known for the drums he created for the Ntan society -- a kind of civic association that also performs at weddings, funerals and festivals. Bonsu's drum is a brightly painted hodgepodge of symbols and tales in red, green, brown and beige. It contains breasts, probably representing fertility, as well as pictures of puff adders capturing frogs, birds, elephants and palm fronds. It sits atop a figure of a lion. One could spend hours transfixed by this drum, trying to figure out all its maker is trying to say.</p>
        <p>While there are more formidable pieces in the exhibit, none can match the stark beauty of the wooden three-note whistles of the Nuna people of Burkina Faso. In their most basic function, they are a signal for hunting dogs. They are also played in ensembles at funerals and celebrations of the hunt. In a display case, they seem like stylized stick figures of an eerily human form, standing arms akimbo.</p>
        <p>Next to them is a tiny whistle carved from ivory in the late 19th or early 20th century by a craftsman from either the Mbun or the Pende tribe (the curators are not sure which) of the Congo. The rounded figure with the quizzical face seems a perfect symbol for the show. Its sound commands hunting dogs to pay attention. Its elegance -- like that of the show as a whole -- implores visitors to do the same.</p>
