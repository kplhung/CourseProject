        <p>TALK about laboring in obscurity. Consider for a moment the life of Joseph Antonacci, a man whose lot is to try to distract commuters from their newspapers and novels with Mileposts, his information pamphlet about the Metro-North Railroad.</p>
        <p>All right, so Mileposts is not exactly sexy. It arrives on commuters' seats once a month with its folksy graphics and surprisingly witty copy. But Mr. Antonacci, a 41-year-old Brooklyn resident with a droll smile and a goofy sense of humor, thinks of his work with the pride of a true auteur.</p>
        <p>Unlike most writers, however, he finds glory not in bylines or public accolades but rather through telephone calls to the railroad from customers wondering what advertising agency Metro-North is using. There is none. Mr. Antonacci, his assistant and his editor are it.</p>
        <p>Writing about schedule changes and safety issues each month can be a challenge. Mr. Antonacci entertains himself by trying to entertain others. His item on holiday fairs last year began: ''O.K., so the subscription to Popular Body Piercing you gave as a gift last year went over like . . . well, like a poke with a sharp object.''</p>
        <p>He described Metro-North, with its many service awards, as ''the Tom Hanks of commuter railroads.''</p>
        <p>And this is how he needles cell phone users who have taken to using headsets: ''When worn in public, they often make you look 'different' to everyone else -- and not in a good way.''</p>
        <p>Mileposts has been part of Metro-North for almost 20 years, but it wasn't until 1996 that Mr. Antonacci took it over and recast it with his blend of information, pop culture, chat and jokes.</p>
        <p>''Hey, if it's boring and you have to spend all day writing it anyway, why not make it funny?'' he said.</p>
        <p>Metro-North says its riders, in general, love the publication -- as evidenced by the fact that they actually read it; when Mr. Antonacci wrote about the lost and found department, traffic there increased 68 percent.</p>
        <p>''I know it's silly,'' said Lynn Leahey, the editor in chief of Soap Opera Digest Magazine, who takes the train from Irvington, ''but commuting can be so impersonal, it's nice to see that they know there is a person sitting in that seat, not just a ticket. Obviously they're trying to reach out to people.''</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Antonacci gets his share of gripers: ''It's too cute, and it's a waste of money,'' said Michael Muscaro, a hairdresser from Sleepy Hollow. ''It's like, 'Aren't we great? And don't forget, winter's coming!' Maybe the occasional tourist likes it.''</p>
        <p>Sometimes readers miss the jokes altogether. A reference to Jackie Gleason's classic comedy, ''The Honeymooners,'' was lost on one rider who, fuming over an apparent grammatical gaffe, decided that Mileposts was written by illiterates.</p>
        <p>Actually, Mr. Antonacci is a Pace University graduate with a degree in journalism, who previously worked as a press officer at the Museum of Natural History. At Metro-North, he takes pride in his work, griping about changes to his copy that ''kill the flow.''</p>
        <p>In general, however, Mr. Antonacci's manager, Donna Evans, lets him have his way. She is ''as demented as I am,'' he said. ''We sort of have to be because we produce so much stuff. If we didn't laugh I think we'd sort of freak out.''</p>
        <p>With one assistant, Mr. Antonacci pumps out new issues of Mileposts each month, along with Mileposts West (for commuters west of the Hudson River), Outposts (which is bilingual for Bronx riders) and two Metro-North employee publications. Much of the information appears again and again in different forms, a fact that would leave most writers dizzy and bored. But Mr. Antonacci shrugs it off.</p>
        <p>''I'm the master of recycling,'' he said. ''I use everything from Bugs Bunny to Brian Wilson lyrics. If I can make people laugh, they might read my stuff.''</p>
        <p>He continued, talking to a reporter, ''Remember, I'm competing with you guys -- The News, The Times and The Post -- just to get read. What good is it if it just sort of lays there?''</p>
        <p>This all started when Mr. Antonacci, working as a security guard, decided that his destiny lay in public relations because it appeared to be ''just taking people to expensive lunches and talking a lot,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He completed his degree at Pace, got a job at The Rockland Review, a weekly, where he wrote restaurant reviews as ''The Stranger,'' and in 1987 wound up in the Metro-North media relations office.</p>
        <p>The idea was to gain some experience and get out quickly. Thirteen years later, Mr. Antonacci says that he can't wait to get back to work when he's home and that during vacations he ponders future issues of Mileposts while lying on the couch.</p>
        <p>His is a corporate office, with the standard computer, files and gray carpeting. But during an interview there, shrieks and guffaws from Mr. Antonacci's coworkers could be heard next door, and people kept popping by to wave hello in a decidedly unbuttoned-down way. When things go badly, he said, the staff starts barking ''Woof!'' at each other.</p>
        <p>As the yuks-master of Metro-North, he says he is the quiet one in his family, which consists of his wife, Joanne, their 6-year-old daughter, Ariana, and two stepsons, Peter, 21, and Alex, 18. They live in a restored country Victorian in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>''When you start your career writing as 'The Stranger' it's somehow logical that you'd end up writing Mileposts,'' he said, laughing at the nonsequitor. ''I like to hook people with humor because, let's face it, how else are you going to get them to read through a whole article on schedule changes?''</p>
