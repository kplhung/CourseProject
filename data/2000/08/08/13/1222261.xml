        <p>Stephanie King Canter and Seth Jeremiah Copeland were married yesterday by Judge Kevin J. Murphy of California State Superior Court at the Elizabeth Gamble Gardens in Palo Alto.</p>
        <p>The bride, 35, graduated from the American University in Paris and is pursuing a doctoral degree in clinical psychology at the Pacific Graduate School of Psychology. Her father, Dr. Norman Canter of New York, is a retired surgeon. Her mother, Margaret King, lives in Fairfield, Conn., where she operates an educational and career consultancy.</p>
        <p>The bridegroom, 45, is the chief executive of Wideband Computers, which makes dental X-ray equipment, and of Wideband Semiconductor, a wireless communications company, both in Mountainview, Calif. He graduated cum laude from the University of San Francisco. His parents, the late Evelyn and Mortimer Copeland, lived in Messena, N.Y., where his father operated River Road Coffee, a roasting business.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Copeland called the couple's courtship a typical Silicon Valley romance. She said that the men there are so driven and busy that ''the trend is get engaged during lunch and go back to work.''</p>
        <p>It began in December 1998. The bride, newly arrived in Palo Alto, was a research coordinator at the Bipolar Disorders Clinic at the Stanford Medical School. A colleague said Mr. Copeland might be a candidate as a boyfriend.</p>
        <p>In setting up a date, they exchanged e-mail. In one message, the bride asked, If someone were making a movie of your life, who would star in it? His reply: Pippi Longstocking, because of ''her sense of adventure.'' This contrasted favorably with other answers she had recently received to similar queries, among them Robert De Niro and Harrison Ford.</p>
        <p>Their first meeting, at a local restaurant, was a different matter. ''He was wearing a baseball jacket -- big, pink and turquoise sleeves,'' she said with astonishment. ''It was made of felt. Like the felt used for stuffed animals.'' As they walked to the parking lot, she found that, unfortunately, his truck complemented his jacket.</p>
        <p>''It was like a movie scene where everything disappears and you zoom in on the truck,'' she said. The eight-year-old Ford pickup had peeling gray paint and decals of pink and turquoise flame. ''I thought, is this what California is like?''</p>
        <p>Despite that jarring first impression, she found Mr. Copeland ''sweet, handsome and funny.'' He said he enjoyed her wry sense of humor and her ''cognitive logical skills.''</p>
        <p>They started going out, but after three months he hadn't so much as held her hand, so she asked, ''What's up?'' There was some heated discussion, and then he disappeared.</p>
        <p>''It took me a long time to open up to her,'' Mr. Copeland explained in retrospect. He said that at 45, he wanted to move into a new relationship with deliberation.</p>
        <p>Two weeks later, Mr. Copeland sent an e-mail message to her, inviting her out for his birthday. They rekindled the relationship, which became closer than before. He met her family, and they visited his brother in the Adirondacks. After nine months, she decided it was time for another barometric reading. Again the discussion was heated. And again, he disappeared.</p>
        <p>''I think she was expecting a dramatic proposal in the Adirondacks,'' Mr. Copeland said. ''Because I'm older, I'm more pragmatic.''</p>
        <p>When he resurfaced two weeks later, he had a spreadsheet. ''Living out here is so expensive,'' he explained. ''As a business guy, I try to look at control issues in the world. Do we make enough to have children? I'm seriously considering our relationship, and the only way I have to do this is to look at it in little steps.''</p>
        <p>The little steps led to the big step of buying the ring, which he did during his lunch hour, with Ms. Canter in tow.</p>
        <p>''I had bought the ring,'' Mr. Copeland said. ''So I figured, why not do it right now.'' So in the parking lot of the jewelry store, in the aging pickup truck with the peeling paint, bare metal top and decals of pink and turquoise flames licking either side, he proposed.</p>
        <p>''I've come full circle,'' the bride said. ''I love that truck.''</p>
