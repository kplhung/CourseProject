        <p>THIS IS THE SUNFLOWER. By Lola M. Schaefer. Illustrated by Donald Crews. Greenwillow. $15.95. (Ages 4 to 8) A cumulative rhyme describes the life cycle of a sunflower: from full bloom to the ripe seeds harvested and scattered by birds, and so on to next summer's sunflower patch. The watercolor illustrations are bold, and the 17 birds shown nibbling on one double-page spread are identified at the end.</p>
        <p>SITTING BULL: And His World. By Albert Marrin. Dutton. $27.50. (Ages 12 and up) An unusually rich biography of the legendary 19th-century Lakota warrior, this thoughtful, lavishly illustrated volume takes careful note of cultural differences. Contemporary photographs and artwork, including images from Sitting Bull's pictorial autobiography, appear as annotated illustrations.</p>
        <p>RING! YO? Written and illustrated by Chris Raschka. DK Ink. $15.95. (Ages 4 to 7) A boy is talking on a very old-fashioned phone, the kind not even many grandparents have these days, but for story purposes it could be any model. The reader is watching and eavesdropping on a virtually monosyllabic routine by this earnest youngster and inevitably tries to figure out what's being said at the other end. The author suggests one possible interpretation, but you could supply others. Very amusing, and could make a good game.</p>
        <p>RICE IS LIFE. By Rita Golden Gelman. Illustrated by Yangsook Choi. Holt. $15.95. (Ages 5 to 9) On the Pacific island of Bali people eat rice, which they call nasi, at every meal. Here's an account of how their rice is grown and harvested by hand in the lush wet fields.</p>
        <p>OH MY BABY, LITTLE ONE. By Kathi Appelt. Illustrated by Jane Dyer. Harcourt. $16. (Ages 2 to 5) Mama Bird drops baby off at nursery school, and the text tells about her wistful feelings of longing and anxiety. The charming watercolor illustrations show just what a wonderful time baby has there with friends, playing, at story time, even at nap.</p>
        <p>SAMIR AND YONATAN. By Daniella Carmi. Translated by Yael Lotan. Arthur A. Levine/Scholastic. $15.95. (Ages 12 and up) Samir, a Palestinian boy, finds himself in a Jewish hospital in Israel waiting for an American doctor to operate on his shattered knee. In this sharply observed novel Shamir gets to know the four other children in the ward, and budding friendship alters his political views.</p>
        <p>HOG MUSIC. By M. C. Helldorfer. Illustrated by S. D. Schindler. Viking. $15.99. (Ages 3 to 8) Here's an adventure set along the National Public Road in the 1840's. Aunt Liza in Maryland sends a hat addressed to Lucy Owen, Vandalia, Ill., as a birthday present. The package makes many detours on its way to the little girl, and her thank-you note recapitulates the accreted surprises.</p>
        <p>WHEN KAMBIA ELAINE FLEW IN FROM NEPTUNE. By Lori Aurelia Williams. Simon &amp; Schuster. $17. (Ages 12 and up) In this very ambitious first novel set in the Bottom neighborhood of Houston, the narrator, Shayla Dubois, deals with various problems. There are the misadventures of her older sister, Tia, who is hanging out with a not-so-bright boy, the reappearance of her long absent father and the strange new next-door neighbor, Kambia Elaine.</p>
        <p>THE SOCCER MOM FROM OUTER SPACE. Written and illustrated by Barney Saltzberg. Crown. $15.95. (Ages 5 to 8) The night before Lena's first soccer game, Dad tells her about Ruben Drinkwater, Ruben's mom and the Atomic Pickles soccer team. It turns out that Mrs. Drinkwater, the ultimate cheerleader, put funny ideas into Dad's head.</p>
