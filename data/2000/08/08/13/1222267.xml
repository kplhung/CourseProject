        <p>Hilary Michele Henkind, the daughter of Barbara Henkind of Scarsdale, N.Y., and Lewis Henkind of Greenwich, Conn., is to be married this morning to Jeffrey Scott Plattus, a son of Marian Plattus of New Rochelle, N.Y., and the late Robert Plattus. Rabbi Wendy Pein will officiate at the TriBeCa Rooftop in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>The bride, 32, will continue to use her name professionally. She is an associate at Mound, Cotton &amp; Wollan, a law firm in New York. She graduated cum laude from Union College in Schenectady, N.Y., and received her law degree magna cum laude from Boston University. Her father owns a real estate development company that bears his name, based in White Plains, and is a trustee of the Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx.</p>
        <p>The bridegroom, 34, is a currency trader in the New York office of the French bank Societe Generale, which has headquarters in Paris. He graduated from Boston University. His father was a stockbroker at Gruntal &amp; Company in New York.</p>
        <p>The couple met on a blind date in March 1999. An older brother of Mr. Plattus's and a colleague of Ms. Henkind's thought the two would be a good match.</p>
        <p>''We both talk a lot and love to eat out, and had already been on hundreds of blind dates,'' Ms. Henkind said.</p>
        <p>On their first date they learned they had something else in common: they both loved the fried chicken at Poultry Time, a well-known takeout restaurant in New Rochelle, near where both grew up.</p>
        <p>''Jeff said I should try Sylvia's in Harlem, and a month later, he took me there,'' Ms. Henkind said. ''We had a great time and took a long romantic walk along the F.D.R. esplanade afterward.''</p>
        <p>The evening was memorable, so much so that Ms. Henkind was sure that if Mr. Plattus were to propose, it would be on a subsequent visit to Sylvia's. But Mr. Plattus came up with something less predictable.</p>
        <p>One day last December, he took a takeout meal to Ms. Henkind's Murray Hill apartment and hid it in the oven. When the bride arrived home, he proposed, and then they celebrated -- much to her surprise, with fried chicken, macaroni and cheese, turkey wings and cornbread. It was from Sylvia's, of course. ''Although we didn't know it when we first met, we grew up a two-minute walk from one another and hung out at the same takeout place,'' Ms. Henkind said. ''It gives a whole different meaning to the words 'soul food.' ''</p>
