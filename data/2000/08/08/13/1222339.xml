        <p>IN the exhaustive analysis of Al Gore's selection of Senator Joseph I. Lieberman as his running mate, one factor has been strangely overlooked: Mr. Lieberman's uncanny resemblance to Sam Jaffe.</p>
        <p>Voters of a certain generation may not be able to look at the man who would be vice president without thinking of the late character actor best remembered as the High Lama in ''Lost Horizon,'' Dr. Zorba in the TV series ''Ben Casey,'' and Gunga Din.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman is known as a religious man; Mr. Jaffe often played priests, though he too was Jewish, born Shalom Jaffe in 1891 on the Lower East Side. In a career that spanned half a century (Mr. Jaffe died in 1984), he played only a few Jewish roles. In ''Ben-Hur,'' he was Saimonides, Charlton Heston's family retainer and book-keeper, who utters the line: ''Judah Ben-Hur! You've come back to us like a returning faith!''</p>
        <p>But it is in ''Gentlemen's Agreement'' that the connection with the senator takes on cosmic meaning. Here, in Elia Kazan's indictment of anti-Semitism, Jaffe played a Jewish professor. His name? Lieberman.</p>
