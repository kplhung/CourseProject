        <p>First things first: I did not try the gyro. That would have been too much pressure for this little man. Gyros, as proclaimed on full-color posters in every Greek diner, are ''America's tastiest sandwich.'' And Jersey City's Gyro Stop advertises the ''Best Gyro in Town.'' Intimidated by such superlatives, I am bowing out of the debate, and will leave it to the specialists.</p>
        <p>My particular area of expertise is inane trivia. Let me demonstrate. The Gyro Stop, true to its logo, is shaped like a stop sign. I walked a full 360 degrees around the establishment to verify. While on my fact-finding mission, I discovered a second eight-sided building next door: the quizzically-spelled ''Sparckling Clean'' Laundromat. Once again, my knowledge in this field is limited, so I will abandon my full-scale investigation of Jersey City's octagonal architecture.</p>

        <p>My particular area of expertise is inane trivia. Let me demonstrate. The Gyro Stop, true to its logo, is shaped like a stop sign. I walked a full 360 degrees around the establishment to verify. While on my fact-finding mission, I discovered a second eight-sided building next door: the quizzically-spelled ''Sparckling Clean'' Laundromat.

        <p>Which brings us back to the Gyro Stop. Friendly, white-shirted gentlemen behind the counter take your order. It's a small, clean place, decorated with the aforementioned posters of gyros, falafel and souvlaki. I chose the curry chicken shish kebab on a pita, which is served with lettuce, tomato, onion and creamy cucumber sauce. Betraying the fast-food look of the restaurant, my meal came on an actual plate. The dish was reasonably priced at $4, and the tender morsels of chicken, surrounded by fluffy pita bread, were delicious.</p>
        <p>The Gyro Stop is a Halal restaurant, meaning that food is prepared in accordance with traditional Islamic standards. There are also many American favorites offered, such as burgers, hot dogs and cheese steaks. And the clientele, a mix of ages and ethnicities, seemed as diverse as the menu.</p>
        <p>As I drove home after an enjoyable meal, I realized a cool thing about having a stop sign as your logo: free advertising on every corner.</p>
