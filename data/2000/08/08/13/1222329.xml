        <p>Harry Pearce, vice chairman of General Motors, is taking his leukemia battle from the hospital room to the boardroom. Two years after his leukemia was diagnosed, and treated with a bone marrow transplant, Mr. Pearce, who is in remission, is taking on a second personal battle: to help raise funds to fight leukemia, lymphoma and myeloma -- all blood-related cancers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pearce is asking his corporate peers in the United States and around the world to match G.M.'s $1.5 million grant, which will finance the new Specialized Center of Research  program of the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society. The program plans to distribute a total of $67.5 million to nine teams of scientists over three years to map the genes responsible for these cancers and to develop new treatments.</p>

        <p>Mr. Pearce is asking his corporate peers in the United States and around the world to match G.M.'s $1.5 million grant, which will finance the new Specialized Center of Research  program of the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society. The program plans to distribute a total of $67.5 million to nine teams of scientists over three years to map the genes responsible for these cancers and to develop new treatments.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pearce said recent research into blood cancers saved his life, and he praised G.M.'s contributions to fighting cancer. ''If you think back 20 years, this diagnosis was basically a death sentence,'' he said. ''It really comes home when you have this disease yourself.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Pearce intends to document for other corporations the costs associated with blood-related cancers, which kill an estimated kill 60,500 Americans a year.</p>
