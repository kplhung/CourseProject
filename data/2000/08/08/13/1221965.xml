        <p>THE NAKED AND THE DEAD, by Norman Mailer. (Picador USA, $16.). Norman Mailer was a young World War II veteran with a story to tell in 1948 when this hefty novel, his first, was published. On page 6 of The Book Review, David Dempsey, found it "the most ambitious novel to be written about the recent conflict'' and "the most ruthlessly honest.'' " 'The Naked and the Dead' is not a great book,'' this early evaluation concluded, "but indisputably it bears witness to a new and significant talent among American novelists.'' The novel has been reissued in a 50th anniversary edition with a new introduction by Mailer. Picador has also reissued WHY ARE WE IN VIETNAM? ($13) a Mailer novel from 1967, when he was well established as Celebrity Writer. Vietnam itself is not mentioned until the last page of the novel, which chronicles the Alaska hunting trip of two soldiers-to-be, who set out to prove their virility in various ways. Anatole Broyard said in these pages that it "may be a third-rate work of art, but it's a first-rate outrage to our sensibilities.''</p>
        <p>ISAAC'S STORM, by Erik Larson. (Vintage, $13.) More than 6,000 people died in the hurricane that struck Galveston, Tex., in 1900 and the Isaac in question was Isaac M. Cline, chief of the United States Weather Bureau's Galveston station. He "survived his colossal misreading of the situation on an impromptu raft,'' W. Jeffrey Bolster wrote here last year, adding that "Larson never personifies nature, but he sees poetry in weather.''</p>
        <p>ALICE SPRINGS, by Nikki Gemmell. (Penguin, $12.95.) A footloose young artist journeys into the Australian outback to find her mysterious father. The novel "offers a whittled-down portrait of external and internal landscapes under pressure,'' Elizabeth Graver wrote here last year.</p>
        <p>THE VIEW FROM ALGER'S WINDOW: A Son's Memoir, by Tony Hiss. (Vintage, $13). The author was 7 years old when his father, Alger Hiss, was accused of passing secrets to the Russians. By drawing on hundreds of letters Alger Hiss sent from prison, the son takes up his father's cause in what Ann Douglas, in these pages last year, called "a poignant, wonderfully written and deeply troubling memoir.''</p>
        <p>THOSE DAMN YANKEES: The Secret Life of America's Greatest Franchise, by Dean Chadwin. (Verso, $15.) The author, a New York lawyer, sees baseball's perennial overdogs as a malign influence on the sport. He "tackles his topic with a zealotry worthy of any Kennedy conspiracy theorist,'' Allen St. John said here last year. But he finds the author's larger point "muddled by his anti-Yankee animus.'' The Yankees' championship season of two years ago, along with the Mark McGwire-Sammy Sosa home run derby, is celebrated in SUMMER OF '98, by Mike Lupica. (Contemporary Books, $14.95). The book "finds fresh ways of telling us history we have already lived through,'' George Robinson wrote here last year.</p>
        <p>THE ACCIDENTAL BRIDE, by Janice Harayda. (St. Martin's Griffin, $13.95.) In this comedy of contemporary manners, Lily Blair, a newspaper reporter, is about to marry the third-richest man in the second-largest city in Ohio when she is torn between the security of married suburban life and following her career dreams to New York. This first novel is "devoid of the delicious tension that infuses books like 'Pride and Prejudice,' '' Maggie Galehouse wrote in these pages last year. But she praised the author as "an astute social commentator.''</p>
        <p>LATER AUDEN, by Edward Mendelson. (Farrar, Straus &amp;Giroux, $17.). The work of W. H. Auden rather than the life dominates this second of two biographical volumes by his literary executor and the editor of his collected works. The author "makes Auden dull, a mere clerk of the emotions,'' William Logan wrote here last year, though he found that "Mendelson's readings fathom the poem phrase by phrase, and even the footnotes are lively with criticism.'' Farrar, Straus has also released EARLY AUDEN ($16), covering the poet's life until he left England for New York in 1939. "Professor Mendelson is informative on the early influences,'' Denis Donoghue wrote here in 1981.</p>
        <p>RIVER OF DARKNESS, by Rennie Airth (Penguin, $6.99.) Surviving the carnage of the World War I battle of Ypres, a sergeant major returns to Surrey's green and pleasant land as a psychopathic killer. The Scotland Yard inspector on his trail is himself a battle-scarred veteran. The novel "has balanced savagery and civilization neatly, and given civilization just the barest edge,'' Christopher Dickey wrote here last year.</p>
