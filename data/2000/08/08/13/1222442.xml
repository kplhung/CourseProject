        <p>IT has been 13 years since executives at Discovery Channel first assembled a weeklong block of shows focusing on sharks, sharks and more sharks. Great whites, hammerheads, blues, lemons ad nurses are mong the species that play starring and supporting roles during Discovery Channel's annual sharkathon.</p>
        <p>The 21 hours of original programming in this year's ''Shark Week Uncaged'' include documentaries commissioned by the network, co-productions with European filmmakers and shark shows for younger viewers. In all, there are enough snapping jaws, churning waters and ominous mentions of ''nature's most deadly flesh-eater'' to satsify even the most die-hard fans of the cartilaginous fish.</p>
        <p>''There's something about sharks that just fascinates people,'' says Nigel Marven, the British naturalist and filmmaker who introduces each night of programming and also is host of one of this week's five new productions. ''Sharks are one of the last free-ranging predators of man remaining on the planet. They're more like jet fighters than fish.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Marven's ''Giants: Sharks'' will be shown tonight at 10, following the 9 p.m. premiere of ''Sharks 3-D,'' in which viewers examine the fossil record left by the prehistoric Megalodon through the lenses of 3-D glasses (available at LensCrafters, Nature Company and Discovery Channel stores). Other premieres, all of which begin at 9 p.m., are ''Great White Down Under'' (Monday), about the relationship between humans and sharks in Australia; ''Jurassic Shark'' (Wednesday), which traces the evolutionary history of sharks; and ''Wolves of the Sea'' (Friday), which focuses on the packlike behavior of white sharks. Interspersed among the new shows are brief segments on shark-obsessed people, including an Ohio wrestler called Shark Boy who wears a mask with fin and teeth.</p>
        <p>Mr. Marven is new to the series this year, giving blow-by-blow narration while swimming with sharks in South Africa, the Galapagos Islands and the Bahamas throughout the week. A snake enthusiast from central London who got his start researching wildlife documentaries for Richard Attenborough, Mr. Marven approaches his subject with a boyish glee, mixing natural history commentary with bold displays of fearlessness.</p>
        <p>In a sequence from ''Giants: Sharks,'' Mr. Marven dons a T-shirt, shorts and a snorkel before leaping into the water with a 15-ton whale shark. ''That was as thrilling as any attraction in any theme park anywhere in the world,'' he says. ''I thought I was going to run out of breath and come up and hit it on the tummy.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Marven says he thinks his approach falls somewhere between the reportorial style of Sir Richard adn the dardevil approach of Steve Irwin, host of the Australian series ''The Crocodile Hunter.''</p>
        <p>''I'm not a professional host; I'm an expert enthusiast,'' says Mr. Marven. ''Hopefully my enthusiasm comes across in a raw way rather than a pat television way.''</p>
        <p>He is currently working on a show for British television about ''the science of blood feeding,'' in which he travels to remote patches of wildlife in hopes of being fed upon by mosquitoes, leeches and vampire bats. ''The worst are the mosquitoes,'' he says. ''The leech bite is utterly painless.''</p>
        <p>After facing swarms of bloodsuckers, leaping into the water with a group of thrashing sharks is just another day at the office. Mr. Marven says he takes such unusual measures in part to attract new and younger audiences to nature documentaries. ''The people who go out walking in the country are already watching,'' he says. ''But we've got to get the attention of the mass audience.''</p>
        <p>''Shark Week'' apparently has that mass appeal, with the combined audience for last summer's series reaching 26 million. That's mostly because of the ''primal appeal'' of sharks, says Mike Quattrone, Discovery Channel's executive vice president and general manager. Not that sharks are the only creatures the network depends upon to scare up ratings. Mr. Quattrone says viewership tends to spike for dinosaurs, snakes, deer and trukeys.</p>
        <p>''Turkeys do amazingly well,'' he says. ''Especially around Thanksgiving.'' There are no current plans, however, for ''Turkey Week.''</p>
