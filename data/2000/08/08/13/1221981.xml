        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In his thorough and insightful review of W. S. Merwin's translation of the ''Purgatorio'' of Dante (July 23), Daniel Mendelsohn describes the souls in purgatory as purging themselves of sin ''by means of hard punishments.'' Although such a view was at the time and continues to be the popular one of what happens there, Dante's great insight is to describe purgatory as a place not so much of punishment as of re-education. As Mendelsohn points out, pride is purged by the carrying of heavy stones, but souls are purged of their pride by laboring in a divine stone quarry filled with statuary from which they learn lessons of humility. And, yes, envy is purged by having the eyes sewn shut, but this heightens the sense of hearing, allowing the envious souls to appreciate voices in the air singing a litany in praise of the mercy of the saints.</p>
