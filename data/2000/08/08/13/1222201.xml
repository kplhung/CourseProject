        <p>Crime in New Jersey decreased by more than 6 percent last year, reflecting a national decline of 7 percent, and making it the sixth year in a row that the number of violent crimes in the state went down, according to the New Jersey State Police Uniform Crime Report issued last week. The number of murders declined from 321 in 1998 to 287 last year, the lowest number of murders in 33 years. Rape declined 13 percent, and robbery and aggravated assault both dropped 6 percent. Nonviolent crimes that are tracked are burglary and theft, both of which declined, and motor vehicle theft, the only crime that showed an increase, up 1 percent. Every county, with the exception of Mercer and Gloucester, saw a decline in violent crimes.</p>
