        <p>In designing a new building for the Solomon Schechter School of Westchester, Neville Epstein of Perkins Eastman Architects of Manhattan, its architect, wanted to evoke the feeling of a ''sanctuary, combined with a place of learning.''</p>
        <p>The 140,000-square-foot building, now rising on West Hartsdale Avenue in Hartsdale, will house the Conservative Jewish day school's middle and high schools. ''It will have the elements of a Jerusalem street, with concrete block towers, an arched entryway and the look of old stone,'' Mr. Epstein said.</p>

        <p>In designing a new building for the Solomon Schechter School of Westchester, Neville Epstein of Perkins Eastman Architects of Manhattan, its architect, wanted to evoke the feeling of a ''sanctuary, combined with a place of learning.''</p>
        <p>The 140,000-square-foot building, now rising on West Hartsdale Avenue in Hartsdale, will house the Conservative Jewish day school's middle and high schools. ''It will have the elements of a Jerusalem street, with concrete block towers, an arched entryway and the look of old stone,'' Mr. Epstein said.</p>
        <p>Now in White Plains, the school provides a comprehensive general and Judaic studies program for kindergarten through eighth grade. ''We've outgrown our present capacity with a student population of 660,'' said Dr. Elliot Spiegel, the headmaster. ''The new building gives us a place to house the middle school, grades 6 through 8, and create a new high school.''</p>
        <p>The building's dual religious and academic functions will be evident from the entryway, he said. ''You'll be able to see through to a glass-enclosed two-story library,'' he said. ''And there will be chapels on either side of the entrance, one for the middle school and one for the high school.''</p>
        <p>The 24-acre site is zoned for school use and borders Woodlands High School, a public school.  Across the street is the Maria Regina High School, a Roman Catholic school. ''We plan to use some facilities at the public school, including the running track,'' Dr. Spiegel said.</p>
        <p>Construction will take place in two phases, Dr. Spiegel said. The first, now under way, will include 17 classrooms, four science labs, six seminar rooms, a 25,000-volume library, two chapels, a gymnasium, a cafeteria, a video production lab and offices. It is expected to be completed next August.</p>
        <p>The second phase is expected to begin four years after completion of the first. It will add about the same number of classrooms and labs, plus a theater, a pool and a music room, Mr. Epstein said. The entire project is expected to cost about $27 million.</p>
