        <p>LOOKING down from the control tower at Republic Airport in East Farmingdale, the airport manager, Stephen D.

        <p>LOOKING down from the control tower at Republic Airport in East Farmingdale, the airport manager, Stephen D. Williams, pointed to the 200-foot separation between Runway 1/19 and its neighboring taxiways, and the 500-foot space that separates the airport's other runway, 14/32, and its taxiways.</p>
        <p>''We want to increase the separation here, too, to 500 feet,'' he said. ''It's a matter of safety.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Williams explained that as more large Boeing 737 jets use the airport, a 500-foot separation would provide breathing room should two 737's pass each other on the runway and on the taxiway. Their wings would not touch even with the 200-foot gap, he added, but a greater separation would enhance safety.</p>
        <p>The proposal is one of 21 in a draft plan presented at a boisterous public meeting this month that drew 500 residents, most of whom angrily attacked the document as a ploy to turn Republic, which now handles cargo and private planes and a few charters, into a much busier commercial jetport. Engineers who attempted to explain the plan were often drowned out by jeers.</p>
        <p>Among the proposals is a plan to allow airplanes landing from the north to use all 5,516 feet of Runway 1/19, which runs north-south. They have been landing 789 feet into the runway to make sure they cleared buildings at the northern end, but the buildings were razed in 1995 and Republic officials want to change landing patterns to take advantage of that extra margin.</p>
        <p>Once that is done, the master plan calls for shifting the usable runway surface 425 feet north.</p>
        <p>Hugh D. Jones, the director of Republic, said the shift northward would help ensure that noise levels for homeowners at the southern end of Runway 1/19, in North Amityville, would stay below 65 L.D.N. units. (The abbreviation stands for ''levels day and night,'' an average that measures the annoyance factor by giving nighttime flight noises 10 times the weight of daytime noises.)</p>
        <p>''If noise levels are less than that, the F.A.A. says you don't have a problem in terms of impact on the neighborhood,'' Mr. Jones said. ''We said that if the noise level reached that point, we'd take steps to lower it.''</p>
        <p>When it was found earlier this year that noise levels measuring 65 units had been reached in 1999 just a block or two from homes in North Amityville, Mr. Jones said, he convinced the airport's two regular operators, Long Island Jet Center and Million Air, to brief all its pilots.</p>
        <p>In addition, he said, Republic surveyed all 500 aircraft based at the airport and found that of the 23 corporate jets, four exceeded the noise limits. The owners of those planes agreed not to operate them between 10 p.m. and 7 a.m., and one even bought a less noisy jet ''because he realized he was not being a good neighbor,'' Mr. Jones said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jones said cargo operations had been kept to a minimum because of the noise restrictions, which he said are unique among New York area airports. United Parcel Service, for instance, was turned down in 1994 when it requested permission for five 727 cargo flights a week.</p>
        <p>But Helen G. Norjen of Farmingdale, co-chairwoman of the airport committee at the Woodland Civic Association, said the moves to curb noise levels just disguised the real goal: expanding the airport.</p>
        <p>''Look at MacArthur,'' she said of the passenger airport in Islip. ''They have all kinds of commercial flights and large planes flying over their communities. Republic officials say they want to make this airport safe, but safe for what size planes? The small ones that are supposed to use the airport, or the large ones'' that the proposed changes could accommodate?</p>
        <p>A map supplied by TriState Planning and Engineering, which drew up the expansion plan, shows that the shift of Runway 1/19 and the possibility of using larger planes will in fact push the noise profile south by about two blocks, almost to Southern State Parkway, though the level would remain below 65 units.</p>
        <p>There will be a similar expansion of the noise profile southwest of the intersecting Runway 14/32, deeper into the Mount Ararat Cemetery, though no changes are planned on 14/32.</p>
        <p>Noise profiles to the north and northwest, on the contrary, should recede as flight patterns change.</p>
        <p>Beyond the structural changes, the overwhelming concern of the residents nearby seems to be a large expansion of air traffic.</p>
        <p>On the Web site run by the Village of Farmingdale (www.fdale.com), local civic groups warn that if Runway 1/19 is modified to accommodate large aircraft, Republic's ability to ''provide more reliable service will be enhanced, and this could turn Republic into a jetport.''</p>
        <p>It also says that a proposal to allow instrument landings in more hazardous weather will ''enhance the airport's ability to provide reliable scheduled service, further contributing to the possibility of Republic becoming a jetport.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Jones insisted that all the master plan was doing was making recommendations based upon expected growth.</p>
        <p>''If we don't do anything, demand will still be greater,'' he said. ''This is a way to responsibly plan ahead.''</p>
        <p>A 37-member committee of residents, pilots, town officials and airport staff members began work on the plan in June 1997. The release of the first 20-year forecast caused the uproar at the recent meeting.</p>
        <p>Although many people in favor of the airport showed up, carrying signs like ''A Massapequa Family for Republic,'' they were outnumbered 4 to 1 by opponents, and the police were called to ensure order as opponents of the airport traded words with proponents.</p>
        <p>Before the meeting, Julia Lauria-Blum of Farmingdale said she welcomed the proposed changes if they were needed to improve safety.</p>
        <p>''When I moved to Farmingdale 12 years ago, one of the things that appealed to me about this area was the presence of the airport,'' she said. ''It preserves the area and does not allow other things to happen here, such as the construction of more shopping malls, which would only increase congestion.''</p>
        <p>Another supporter, William J. McLean, 75, of Lindenhurst, said he moved to within a mile and a half of the airport in 1956 and believes the proposed changes ''benefit the neighborhood because they are looking to improve the airport.''</p>
        <p>''I don't think this is going commercial,'' he added.</p>
        <p>But Rose Hobbins, president of the 1,000-family North Massapequa Civic Association, replied: ''All I know is that 15 or 20 years ago, there were Piper Cubs and a flying school here. Now we have 737's and 727's.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Jones interjected that when Southwest Airlines approached Republic three years ago about starting commercial service, he turned them down. ''We told Southwest that they could sue us and probably win, but that this was not the place for them, and we asked them to go to Islip instead,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Also preventing regularly scheduled flights of large planes is the airport's weight limit, Mr. Jones noted. The runway was designed to handle only 117 planes a year that weigh more than 60,000 pounds, and although there has been a court injunction since 1984 preventing enforcement of the limit, he said, since 1994 the most that have landed in a year was 72, and ''most of that activity related to the Islanders' games.'' Both the Islanders and visiting teams use large charter planes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Williams said consultants would now conduct an environmental evaluation of the plan, which could take six months to a year. If they find no significant impact, the advisory committee would begin work on financing and implementing the plan. He said 90 percent of the money would come from the F.A.A.</p>
