        <p>WILL the euro ever rally?</p>
        <p>That is a fair question, given the currency's tumble this summer. Despite predictions that it was time for a rebound in the euro, the unified currency of 11 European nations, it is back within striking distance of new lows, bedeviling American investors by erasing gains that they may have made in European equities.</p>
        <p>After a rally of 8.5 percent from its record low of 88.95 cents on May 4, the euro has fallen 6.4 percent from its recent peak of 96.49 cents, on June 16. It dropped below 90 cents on Wednesday and finished the week at 90.33 cents. That is down 22.6 percent from its debut value of $1.1667 in January 1999.</p>
        <p>''It's embarrassing to be a currency forecaster these days,'' said Anne Mills, senior foreign economist at Brown Brothers Harriman &amp; Company. She is not alone. There is no easy answer to why the euro remains so weak.</p>
        <p>The economies of the countries behind the euro are now growing at 3 to 4 percent a year. They are at an earlier stage in their expansion cycle, compared with that of the United States, so they should be able to keep perking along. Their stock markets, while not taking off, are doing better than American equities so far this year. And the European Central Bank has moved to support the euro and to keep inflationary pressures in check, raising its benchmark interest rate by 1.75 percentage points since November. Many analysts expect that inflation and euro worries will prompt another rate increase late this month or in September.</p>
        <p>''I find it very difficult to explain the softness of the euro from the European side,'' said Nicholas P. Sargen, global market strategist for J. P. Morgan's private clients.</p>
        <p>The euro has also received help from the United States in the last year, as the Federal Reserve has lifted its benchmark interest rate by 1.75 points, aiming to put a brake on American economic growth. A slowing United States economy should make a rebounding Europe more attractive, especially in a year when the American stock market indexes are in negative territory.</p>
        <p>But all that came of this was a six-week rally that started in early May and got its real lift when the Fed raised its target for the federal funds rate by half a point, to 6.50 percent, on May 16.</p>
        <p>So what happened? While analysts are not confident of their explanations, they put most of the blame on the strong performance of the United States economy and investors' consequent unwillingness to bet on Europe when American has given them so much.</p>
        <p>Rather than worrying that the American economy will slow sharply, investors seem to be betting that the Fed can direct the economy to a soft landing, with growth remaining relatively robust and inflation continuing to be restrained. German jobs data, released last week, may have also created concern; the number of unemployed fell by 9,000 in July, but that was below the predictions of 10,000 to 25,000. The unemployment rate slipped to 9.5 percent, from 9.6 percent.</p>
        <p>''What has made us wrong,'' Ms. Mills of Brown Brothers Harriman said, ''is the appetite of Europeans for direct and portfolio investment in the United States.''</p>
        <p>Karen E. Parker, director of currency research at Chase Securities, pointed out that European companies were still behind their United States competitors in restructuring and in productivity gains. That, too, is probably undermining the euro, she said.</p>
        <p>Even the euro pessimists have been surprised. Ms. Parker has been bearish on the currency since its inception. But she had predicted that it would rally this year, in part because the Fed was pushing interest rates higher and the American economy's rapid growth was expected to slow. Last December, she forecast that the euro would be at $1.10 by the end of this year.</p>
        <p>Now she predicts that the best the euro can do is 92 cents by year-end and 95 cents by next June. ''The most that we are counting on is that the euro has bottomed out,'' she said. But she is not ruling out a brief side trip to a new low.</p>
        <p>''This is one of those major moves that simply take longer to turn around than people think,'' Ms. Mills said.</p>
        <p>She said she felt sure of one development -- although, wisely, she declined to forecast the timing: ''Sometime in the next five years, we will be doing the same search for reasons why the dollar is so weak.''</p>
