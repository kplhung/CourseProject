        <p>Q: You led the victors in Westmoreland v. CBS and Uncle Sam v. Microsoft, to name just a couple of the big victories. And you left the top-dog law firm, Cravath, to represent the Yankees -- only the winningest team in baseball. Then you go and lose the first round to the Recording Industry Association of America in its copyright infringement case against Napster. How were those 30 hours as a loser?</p>
        <p>Very busy. About the only time anyone had to reflect was the time between when we put in our reply brief and the time the appeals court stayed the decision. Even then, we were mostly working on shutting the system down. You don't have time to reflect on whether you're happy or sad; you've got to get to work. Other defeats, when the smoke clears and it's all over, you think about a lot. When it goes bad, you remember all the details. You remember every single card of a bad bet. Or how the board built up in a craps game.</p>

        <p>Q: You led the victors in Westmoreland v. CBS and Uncle Sam v. Microsoft, to name just a couple of the big victories. And you left the top-dog law firm, Cravath, to represent the Yankees -- only the winningest team in baseball. Then you go and lose the first round to the Recording Industry Association of America in its copyright infringement case against Napster. How were those 30 hours as a loser?</p>
        <p>Very busy. About the only time anyone had to reflect was the time between when we put in our reply brief and the time the appeals court stayed the decision. Even then, we were mostly working on shutting the system down. You don't have time to reflect on whether you're happy or sad; you've got to get to work. Other defeats, when the smoke clears and it's all over, you think about a lot. When it goes bad, you remember all the details. You remember every single card of a bad bet. Or how the board built up in a craps game.</p>
        <p>I've heard of your craps games. I'm surprised you like the game so much -- the chance to control your own fate is so limited.</p>
        <p>First of all, it is the casino game that you have the best chance of winning. The second thing is that, perfectly played, it's pure luck. It's literally a roll of the dice. If I wanted to earn my living gambling, I would play blackjack and not craps, probably. But I gamble to relax. I don't want to think real hard about how many cards I've seen. The other thing about craps is that it's very social. You know everybody at the craps table. I run into people all over the world that I've met at a craps table in Las Vegas. They remember who you are, the great runs.</p>
        <p>So what songs have you personally downloaded from Napster?</p>
        <p>Me, none. However, my children. . . .</p>
        <p>What kind of music do you listen to?</p>
        <p>Everything from the Beatles to Led Zeppelin to Crosby, Stills and Nash. And country: Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson, Hank Williams. And a variety of things in between, like Billy Joel or Mariah Carey.</p>
        <p>Anyway, why represent Napster and risk that winning record of yours?</p>
        <p>We formed the firm because we want to do important litigation that matters. Is this important litigation? Of course. Does this litigation matter? Probably very few other cases matter as much. If we're not going to do it, who is? And it didn't hurt us in making the decision that every one of our children insisted on it.</p>
        <p>You defended IBM from antitrust prosecutors but prosecuted Microsoft on antitrust grounds. Is taking clients a matter of who pays most?</p>
        <p>I tend to take on cases that I really believe in. In part because I have the luxury to do that and in part because there are other lawyers out there. My view is that everyone is entitled to a lawyer, but not everyone's entitled to me.</p>
        <p>An attorney told me you're ''one of the brilliant litigators of all time.'' Why are lawyers so diplomatic when it's so much about crushing your opponent?</p>
        <p>Part of it is the formalistic courtesies of war. The adversary system means that you're out to, within the rules of the game, undercut your adversary's credibility, embarrass him or her, make your client prevail and not theirs. Part of the way we stay civil is by trying not to engage in personal attacks on our adversaries.</p>
        <p>War? That's a better comparison for litigation than sports?</p>
        <p>It's probably in between. Not nearly as serious as war, but more serious than most games. One of the great advantages to litigation is you can't really get hurt unless your charts fall on you.</p>
        <p>It amuses me to think of all the kids around us in this bar not knowing that they may end up owing you thanks for preserving their favorite new pastime.</p>
        <p>I was on an American Airlines flight from L.A. last week, really oversold, not a single free seat -- they were paying people to get off. Long story short, it's one mechanical problem after another and we're sitting on the ground for hours. One guy sitting a few rows ahead keeps turning around and eyeballing me. He waves and says, ''Hey, aren't you Napster's lawyer?'' I tell him I am and he announces, ''Napster's lawyer is on the plane!'' Everyone in coach cheers. Right then I knew the record industry was in trouble.</p>
