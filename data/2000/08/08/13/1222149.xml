        <p>HIS star cast member just died of cancer. Another cast member is still hospitalized. The director, whose last professional gig was as a photo double for Wilford Brimley in Cocoon II, is laid up in a nursing home bed, recuperating from an operation.</p>
        <p>So, is the production of ''The Old Gold Radio Show'' canceled?</p>
        <p>Pinned to a poster board in the lobby of a nursing home, next to a note from the state on ''nursing home responsibility,'' a flier reads ''Actors, Singers, Dancers, Comedians Wanted for Future Show . . . Please see John Oberon.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Oberon, the director, is determined; the show will go on.</p>
        <p>Mr. Oberon, 83, is in a wheelchair and is fighting leukemia. His desire to present a re-creation of the 1944 Radio Age classic, complete with song, instrumentals, and sketch comedy, might seem quixotic -- even dangerous -- at most nursing homes, but it's show business as usual on West Hudson Avenue here.</p>
        <p>This is where a deaf 93-year-old woman plays the piano and sings. A ninetysomething man with Alzheimer's disease entertains residents and guests with his jazz piano riffs. A 92-year-old woman bursts into Jimmy Durante or Mae West impressions in the middle of the dining hall.</p>
        <p>Yes, this is the geriatric equivalent of ''Fame,'' the musical based on the High School of Performing Arts in Manhattan. The Actors' Fund Nursing and Retirement Home is one of only a handful of institutions in the country that specialize in caring for entertainment professionals. Most of the 109 residents of the Actors' Home, which includes a 67-bed nursing home and a 42-bed assisted-living section, have spent more than 20 years in show biz.</p>
        <p>Although many of the retired actors, writers, directors, musicians, singers and dancers are in assisted care because they are sick, weak or disabled, the drive to perform still shines through.</p>
        <p>''It's something I've loved all my life,'' said Howard Whitfield, 85, who traces his passion for theater to 1918. Though in a wheelchair and battling cancer, Mr. Whitfield has acted, lectured, directed, and recited poetry in his 11 years at the Actors' Home. Mr. Whitfield, who worked as a stage manager for Josh Logan and David Merrick, said his performances at the nursing home were a continuation of his life's work.</p>
        <p>''I'm an old ham actress,'' said Blanche Collins Perry, 92, a former vaudevillian who is unabashed about performing in the home's dining hall. ''I can never stop doing this.''</p>
        <p>Some of the residents are not physically or mentally capable of executing a Jimmy Durante impression. This is, after all, a place where people who can walk are referred to as ''ambulatory.'' Many are too ill even to think about getting out of bed, let alone perform. And even for those who are lucid and able, special assistance is often needed.</p>
        <p>Because Beatrice Greenbaum, 93, is too weak to play the piano keys and work the pedals simultaneously, she enlists a nursing assistant to push the pedals for her. Because so many elderly residents have diminished memories and so few are ambulatory, the in-home theater group, the Actors' Fund Players, performs ''radio-style.''</p>
        <p>''You don't have to move, and you don't have to memorize lines,'' Mr. Oberon, the founder of the Players, said. ''The script is right in front of you. All you have to do is read.''</p>
        <p>When Mrs. Perry contemplated moving to the assisted-living portion of the home with her husband, Luther Perry, a year and a half ago, she didn't expect to hear about any artful activities. ''I dreaded it,'' said Mrs. Perry, who expected to ''eat breakfast, eat lunch, play bingo, watch Jeopardy.''</p>
        <p>But Mrs. Perry quickly discovered the Actors' Home was not typical. In addition to wheelchairs, nursing stations and linen closets, the home has six pianos, a 20-seat, three-piano theater, a library stacked with dozens of scripts and drama school texts, a screening room, a video library, an audio collection with everything from Puccini and Handel to old show tunes. Hallways and rooms are plastered with pictures of stars like Jimmy Cagney, Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. The American Movie Classics channel regularly pumps Cary Grant and Clark Gable into the lounge.</p>
        <p>If that's not enough to light the creative fire, there are the activities. Of course, ''Jeopardy,'' ''Wheel of Fortune,'' physical therapy and sometimes even bingo are offered.</p>
        <p>But add to that a poetry-reading group, which meets once a month; a film-viewing (and critiquing) group, which gathers in the screening room once a week; the intergenerational programs, which give residents a chance to swap tales, mentor and even perform with college-age drama students; and the Ice Cream Social Club, which introduces youngsters from the neighboring Bergen County communities to the home's residents.</p>
        <p>The home's staff strongly encourage residents to participate, because involvement in activities seems to have therapeutic benefits, especially, said Denise Scott, the director, when they are making the often traumatizing transition from independent to institutional living. ''I've never seen anything like it,'' said Ms. Scott, who has worked in management at five nursing homes. Residents quickly realize they live in a place where their life's passion is celebrated, and, Ms. Scott said, ''they feel comfortable here right away.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Elizabeth Markson, a Boston University gerontologist who has studied nursing homes for more than 20 years, said that engaging residents in talking about ''their life's passion'' can stimulate memory and improve social skills. Even better, Dr. Markson said, is getting older people to perform or to continue to rehearse their art. This, she said, can help them retain, even improve, mental skills.</p>
        <p>Dr. Markson also noted that elderly show business people have not, in most cases, had a chance to perform for decades. ''Roles are limited for elderly actors,'' she said. ''This is a great opportunity for them.''</p>
        <p>Most of Mr. Whitfield's career as a traveling Shakespearean actor was more than 50 years ago. Nowadays, he's the home's resident Shakespeare expert, reciting in the poetry group and speaking about Shakespeare's life at the home's celebration of his birthday.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Perry, who started performing vaudeville acts before the end of World War I, is now performing material she developed decades ago. And sometimes it's with -- or in front of -- peers she's admired for decades. ''It's like starting a new career for me,'' she said.</p>
        <p>As for Mr. Oberon, who was a commercial actor and band leader in the 1940's, his time in the home has been prolific. He has started the Players, worked on three stage plays and performed done shows at 19 nursing homes in Bergen County in the last 11 years.</p>
        <p>He has also learned something about nursing home theater. Casting is a big problem. ''People will get sick,'' he said, ''You just have to be patient.''</p>
        <p>But the patience pays off. That's why he's still doing ''The Old Gold Radio Show,'' and telling ''jokes that are about 100 years old.''</p>
        <p>Performing in a home is a gratifying experience, he said. ''It's not like the curtain comes down and that's it,'' Mr. Oberon said, ''we really enjoy coming out and doing this.''</p>
