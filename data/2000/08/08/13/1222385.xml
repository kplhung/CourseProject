        <p>They came over on wobbling merchant marine ships, refugees with a few valises apiece that contained all they owned in the world.</p>
        <p>Rebuilding from scratch -- they had, after all, lost their homes and most of their closest kin -- they worked at low-paying jobs in dingy dress factories, luncheonettes, dry-goods stores. For many, it was too late for any grander aspirations. Their children would redeem their shattered lives.</p>
        <p>Their children more than met their expectations. But all the pride they asserted over half a century -- quietly, so as not to provoke the Yiddish evil eye -- seemed to crystallize last week with a special piquancy when a daughter of Holocaust survivors, Hadassah Freilich Lieberman, stood on a platform and heard her husband, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, introduced, however prematurely, as the next vice president of the United States.</p>
        <p>''I got the chills when I heard about it,'' said Sonia Erlich, who lost all but one of her 34 relatives in the Holocaust and lives in the dwindling survivor community in Riverdale, the Bronx. ''The world should know what we lost, but there is something in us that God did not forget us. We believed something good would come out from us.''</p>
        <p>The sudden national prominence of Mrs. Lieberman has brought into focus a largely overlooked chapter of the Holocaust story: the lives the survivors built for themselves and their children in America. Roughly 140,000 of them came to the United States in the decade after World War II. Many denied themselves even ordinary pleasures -- no movies, no dinners out, no taxis -- so that their children could be educated and sent off to a better life than had been granted them.</p>
        <p>''I saw that life is gornischt, life is a feather,'' said Julia Rosen, an Auschwitz survivor, using a Yiddish term for ''worthless.'' ''So I tried to educate my children so they should know more than I do, because if I was an educated person I would have run away. I would have gone to China or Italy or I would have hid in the forest.''</p>
        <p>In the United States, Mrs. Rosen worked as a bakery clerk; her husband, Andrew, drafted blueprints. But they put their three children through colleges like Columbia and Barnard, and those children are now a pharmacist, a computer consultant and a yeshiva teacher. Like Mrs. Erlich and Mrs. Lieberman's mother, Ella Freilich, Mrs. Rosen lives in Riverdale, a leafy neighborhood where survivors and their offspring help give the neighborhood a European accent and gentility.</p>
        <p>In the years after they came here, the refugees barely had the confidence to remind the world what had been done to them, let alone protest. For years, there were no rallies, and only the flimsiest of survivor organizations.</p>
        <p>That is partly why Rabbi Irving Greenberg, a Riverdale resident who is chairman of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, saw in Mrs. Lieberman's new stature what he called ''an incredible contrast.''</p>
        <p>''Fifty years ago the Jews were totally powerless,'' Rabbi Greenberg said. ''Here was the most total genocide, and they didn't have the political clout to get the president to let Jews in. They didn't have the clout to get the president to bomb the railroads.''</p>
        <p>The survivors had already felt that powerlessness in Europe, where in countries like Poland anti-Semitic incidents were commonplace and it was difficult for Jews to go to high school, let alone college, or to work for the government or enter professions. And so the survivors share an almost ingenuous gratitude to America, and ''are superpatriots as a rule,'' said William B. Helmreich, a professor of sociology at the City University of New York and the author of ''Against All Odds: Holocaust Survivors and the Successful Lives They Made in America.''</p>
        <p>''These people's attitude was, 'I came here with nothing and look what America allowed me to do,' '' Mr. Helmreich said. ''So this becomes a critical event in their lives. In what other country could you have the wives of two candidates for the highest offices named Tipper and Hadassah?''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Lieberman's story has familiar echoes for many survivors and their offspring. She was born in Prague, where her mother, an Auschwitz survivor, and her father, a slave laborer for the Nazis, settled after the war.</p>
        <p>''We came from hell,'' was all Mrs. Freilich wanted to say about her wartime experience.</p>
        <p>The family came here when Mrs. Lieberman was 3, and lived with a sister of Mrs. Freilich in New York. Samuel Freilich had received training as both a lawyer and a rabbi in Czechoslovakia, but he did not speak English and he knew he did not have time to resurrect his legal career. So he went to the Jewish Theological Seminary in Manhattan, looking for a rabbi's position, and soon found himself on a bus to Gardner, Mass., a furniture- manufacturing center in the northern part of the state. There, Ohave Sholom, a Conservative congregation, was eager to have him.</p>
        <p>''He was an immensely disciplined man,'' said Ary Freilich, Mrs. Lieberman's brother, who was born in Gardner. ''He sat down with The New York Times and a German-English dictionary and started at the top of the page and began teaching himself English.''</p>
        <p>He didn't earn much money, but he put Hadassah through Stern College and Boston University and Ary through Yeshiva University. In Boston, Hadassah Lieberman met her first husband, Gordon Tucker, the former dean of the Jewish Theological Seminary, and now a rabbi in White Plains. After they divorced, she lived in Riverdale with her son, Ethan, until she met Mr. Lieberman.</p>
        <p>''She's very appreciative of what she has,'' said Mindy Weisel, a Washington friend of Mrs. Lieberman's who was born in a displaced person's camp near the site of the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. ''She has not been a princess. She doesn't take anything for granted, and that is a keynote of her being a survivor's daughter.''</p>
        <p>In many homes, the survivors and their children maintained a tacit silence about the wartime experiences. ''My daughter didn't want me to talk about Auschwitz,'' Mrs. Rosen said.</p>
        <p>But Ary Freilich, who runs a real estate company in Fort Lee, N.J., said he had a different experience.</p>
        <p>''My parents did not speak of it often, but you don't need to speak of it often for the words to have an impact,'' he said. ''The absence of relatives, the pictures of small children who never made it to be adults, were images that were present in our home.</p>
        <p>''The Holocaust survivor families always have a little bit of sadness in them,'' he continued. ''There is an appreciation of the fragility of life and of the fragility of society. There is an awareness that forces can bring a society down. But by the same token there is an immense appreciation of life that comes from people who always lived at the very edge.''</p>
        <p>Knowledge of genocide is in the children's genes, said Thane Rosenbaum, a survivors' son and author of ''Second Hand Smoke'' and other Holocaust-themed novels.</p>
        <p>''There is a kind of moral imperative that children of survivors have about speaking out, not being silent, not falling prey to the language of indifference,'' he said. ''When I heard Hadassah Lieberman was a child of survivors, I wondered whether she influenced her husband's speaking out in the Monica Lewinsky case.''</p>
        <p>In a way, said Menachem Rosensaft, founding chairman of the International Network of Children of Jewish Holocaust Survivors, ''Hadassah's presence signifies that we are now very much part of the American mainstream. Our heritage of children of survivors has in effect become, through Hadassah Lieberman, part of the American melting-pot heritage.''</p>
        <p>But the children never seem to forget what makes them distinctive.</p>
        <p>Ms. Weisel said that after Mrs. Lieberman watched her husband accept Vice President Al Gore's invitation to become his running mate in Nashville last week, she got an e-mail message from her.</p>
        <p>''Mindy,'' it said, ''I felt I stood there for all the lost souls.''</p>
