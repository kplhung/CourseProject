        <p>LUCCA in September can make one forget the Renaissance ever happened. Situated just above the knee of the Italian boot barely 20 miles from the Mediterranean Sea, this Tuscan city of 87,500, long prosperous and well pleased with itself, uses the beginning of autumn to celebrate what it was and what in good part it still is.</p>
        <p>The dour beauty of the old city is medieval. Florence is 50 miles to the southeast but even more distant in spirit. The Romans gave the town its enduring roots although Lucca (probably from ''luk,'' the Ligurian word for marshland) had residents going back to Paleolithic times. The marks of an economic boom during the first two centuries of the Christian era have not gone away. The great amphitheater in the center of old Lucca is Roman to this day, as are some of the surviving walls around the city.</p>
        <p>Lucca became both a crossroads for trade and more important a purveyor of silk, which it sold to both Europe and Asia. The feudal struggles that followed were not good for business, ending in some ugly 15th-century episodes during which Florence and the hated nearby Pisa moved in and established rule. There was also an unfortunate takeover by Napoleon and his sister Elisa in the early 1800's, but Lucca -- handsome and livable -- eventually retook and retained its air of independence and hard work. The mulberry trees that ring the ramparts remind the visitor of the city's silk trade. The banks that seem to occupy every corner of the old city today testify that the Lucchesi  have found new ways to make money.</p>
        <p>If the ancient buildings and the narrow streets of old Lucca act as physical reminders, it is the enduring attitude toward art and religion that makes this city feel so medieval. The Renaissance told us that painting, architecture and music could exist away from the church, where it had been so at home. In the third week of September, Lucca has the festival of the Volto Santo to remind us of old unities, beginning with a midmonth procession of solemnity and beauty to make its point.</p>
        <p>''The Wandering Saint'' (loosely translated) is a life-sized crucifix that was carved, according to legend, by Nicodemus from a cedar of Lebanon. It is said to have arrived in Lucca on a cart drawn by untamed oxen after having come ashore on an unmanned ship at some shadowy time a millennium ago. Legend says that boatmen from Pisa were the first to spot the floating crucifix, but broke their oars trying to approach it. The Lucchesi had no such problem, hence their current ownership. The Pisani, I am sure, have another story.</p>
        <p>Ownership seemed to have had its problems early on. Apparent inanimacy did not keep this dark and fierce-eyed image of Christ from walking periodically from its perch at night and reclining in adjacent fields. There, the ancient Lucchesi would find it in the morning and restore it to its church. Now elegantly housed at the Cathedral of San Martino within a small 15th-century octagonal temple designed by Matteo Civitali and set in an enclave to the left of the main altar, the Volto Santo has stopped its wandering ways.</p>
        <p>Yet with a little help, it makes a yearly sacred promenade, the Luminaria di Santa Croce. Outfitted with a crown, the simple robe on the Christ figure covered with elaborate ornament, this object of continued and sincere devotion waits every Sept. 13 for sundown. Streetlights are turned off and torches lighted, and the ancient crucifix is carried for about two hours across the half-mile width of Old Town from the Church of San Frediano to the cathedral. Good deeds and good fortune are attributed to the Volto Santo, and in gratitude gold plaques from citizens are hung for display in the cathedral, or cash is donated.</p>
        <p>For this slow march, clergy from local and nearby churches is joined by squadrons of parishioners, all in full regalia. Windows along the Via Fillungo are embellished with richly decorated cloth and carpet. The procession, slowed by the narrowness of the streets, passes the Piazza San Giovanni and then reaches the cathedral. Participants keep up their strength with nut candies called croccanti, which are made and sold for the occasion from the bancarelle, or street carts, set up along the way.</p>
        <p>At San Martino, high Mass is celebrated and a motet, written annually for the occasion, is sung. For the last decade the composer has been one of the city's musical activists, Msgr. Emilio Maggini. His predecessors include the father, grandfather and great-grandfather of the opera composer Giacomo Puccini, all of them church musicians. If the cathedral is filled to capacity, which it usually is, loudspeakers on the piazza outside convey the proceedings.</p>
        <p>Two to three hours can pass from start to finish, by which time Lucchesi are ready for dinner. For the immediate celebrants the church lays on a banquet; restaurants are filled, or else families go home to dinner.</p>
        <p>This has been an evening when art serves the church, but in multiple events lasting through October, the church opens its doors to art and music. The La Scala Orchestra's  concert last fall of nonoperatic Puccini conducted by Riccardo Muti was held, for example, in San Frediano. Art exhibits are everywhere.</p>
        <p>It is at this time of year that theater and opera also come to life. The jewel-like and historic Teatro del Giglio begins its opera season; last fall it was with ''La Sonnambula'' by Bellini. Puccini, like Catalani and Boccherini, were from this town, and the citizenry, amazingly just now awaking to the extraordinary reputation of ''La Boheme'' and ''Madama Butterfly'' in the rest of the world, are plotting citywide festivals of Pucciniana in the next few years: in October, ''Il Trittico,'' followed in succesive seasons by ''La Fanciulla del West'' and ''Turandot.''</p>
        <p>If culture begins to wear on you, comforts are to be had. One place to stay is the large, slightly worn but engaging Hotel Universo. Administered by silver-haired, good-hearted but sometimes grumpy men, the Universo is reasonably priced and looks directly across the Piazza del Giglio to the opera house. Once a ducal palazzo, its rooms tend now to be small and minimal in the manner of so many European midpriced hotels. Traces of grandeur remain in the high-ceilinged lobby and in the faded murals and frescoes of the second-floor breakfast and conference rooms.</p>
        <p>Sitting at the Universo's front door, one can soak up music history without so much as wiggling the toes. Look straight ahead to the Giglio where Gilbert Duprez in 1831 introduced Italian opera to the first tenorial high C sung from the chest, thus changing the medium forever. Turn your head to the right and contemplate the stately Palazzo Ducale, where Paganini, wizard of the violin, had apartments and was said to frolic illicitly with his landlord, Maria Luisa of the Parma Bourbons.</p>
        <p>If you are hungry and feeling a bit fancy, walk two doors to the left. At the Ristorante del Giglio one finds superior veal and wild mushrooms and a splendid La Badiola red wine for under $40 a person. Fancy is not always best in this city, however.</p>
        <p>I have dined well and often in the back room of Da Guido on the Via Giovanni Battista. Presiding is Leo Barsotti, who makes or grows almost everything you eat: wine, olive oil, chickens, rabbits, produce. Finish with the hard biscotti Toscani and an after-dinner glass of the local vin santo. One's stomach is well treated for under $20. (Blue-collar workers pay by the week, and assuredly less.) Mr. Barsotti doesn't speak English, but his young waiter is taking lessons and is happy to use you for practice. Another plain and pleasant place is Slim Joes restaurant on the Corte Campana, started originally by an American couple. Large, well-lighted and popular with townsfolk, Da Giulio is near the city walls on the Via delle Conce.</p>
        <p>Increasingly a tourist destination, Lucca could use more hotels. Locals will steer you to small and welcoming ones off the winding central streets. One is the Piccolo Hotel Puccini on the Via di Poggio, another is La Luna on the Via Fillungo.</p>
        <p>Lucca, like most of urban Europe, has its antique district (the Via del Battistero) and all the familiar big-name boutiques. But Bellandi on the Via Beccheria behind the Universo, offers sweaters, scarves and related goods of a splendor and variety I don't find in New York at three times the price. If you, like me, pine for those old European bath towels, the ones with the hard and waffled textures, they are stocked at In Villa on the Via Vittorio Veneto. I bought two big ones for $35 each, and scarcely anything Turkish has touched my back since.</p>
        <p>The walls, most of which were built in the 16th and 17th centuries to protect Lucca from marauders, also help modify the corrosive traffic plaguing most Italian cities. Many thoroughfares and byways are for pedestrians only, and this is truly a walkable town, especially along the tops of the walls themselves. One stop on almost every pedestrian tour is the Caffe di Simo on the Via Fillungo where Puccini and colleagues gathered. It has its glossy charm, but odd and accidental discoveries on aimless walks are often more interesting. I was struck by the postered death notices found on walls all over town. Paid obituaries in local newspapers, I was told, are expensive; these ''manifesti per lutto'' are the medium of choice.</p>
        <p>The towers are fascinating. Where 130 once existed, only about nine remain, some four and five stories high. Trump-like, rich homeowners once used towers to compete among themselves: the higher the altitude, the more potent the family. That the Torre delle Ore on the Via Fillungo survives has to do with its clock, deemed a practical necessity.</p>
        <p>Wandering through the Roman Ampitheater, laid out in the first century A.D., one comes upon ancient houses now being peeled to the original brick. The smooth facades we associate with old Italian cities were in fact a product of the plague. Stucco, it was thought by 14th-century Lucchesi,  sealed off disease.</p>
        <p>The Renaissance did pay rich visits to Lucca. See especially Tintoretto's ''Last Supper'' at San Martino, the cathedral built in the sixth century, rebuilt in the 11th and notable for its stacked arcades and sculpted pillars. A lot of Lucca's striking pictures, facades and sculpture are older. In San Martino, spend time in two places. First, before the Volto Santo. If the glaring eyes of the Christ figure follow you too closely, find relief and calm in the extraordinarily beautiful Sarcophagus of Ilaria del Carretto, young wife of the powerful Paolo Guinigi, carved by Jacopo della Quercia in 1405.</p>
        <p>Mystery and something vaguely disquieting inhabit the first image, utter serenity the second. A few moments with both might help prepare the visitor for the people out there on the streets of Lucca. They have been good businessmen for several millenniums, yet it is these same shrewd and practical people who hold firmly to the city's mysterious Christian legends. The thoughts may be new, but they are informed and colored by old beliefs.</p>
        <p>If the Lucchesi dream of the past, they also insist on time to live right now. The growing, cooking and consuming of food is discussed in bars and cafes as rabidly as baseball is in the Bronx. This city must have its workaholics, but the flow of pedestrians in the streets at noon and late-afternoon reflects a citizenry that knows when to put business behind it and to enjoy friends and family. Creating space for both enterprise and relaxation is a life's work here.</p>
        <p>Fine for a walk, a bit of opera, a good meal</p>
        <p>Getting There</p>
        <p>One thing that protects Lucca from a tourist onslaught is its lack of an airport. Alitalia and British Airways schedule regular flights into Pisa, 15 miles away. Train service to Lucca is regular and cheap, with departures every two hours or so.</p>
        <p>Taxis are metered and not unreasonable. I took a cab from Pisa with a Lucchese and paid $40, at 2,100 lire to the dollar, but returned alone for $48. Just smile. Minimal fleecing -- the furtive surcharge or unspoken tourist tax -- should be accepted with good grace.</p>
        <p>Getting Around</p>
        <p>Lucca is a walled city of manageable size that continues to lean more and more toward pedestrians and away from cars. Just about everything worth seeing can be reached on foot. A quick drive by rental car will get you to Puccini's charming little retreat at Torre del Lago about 15 miles west or to such equally charming hilltop towns as Montecarlo and Barga. And at Barga there is a first-class summer opera season.</p>
        <p>Where to Stay</p>
        <p>Central, appealing and relatively large is the Hotel Universo at Piazza del Giglio 1, across the Piazza Puccini from the Teatro del Giglio, Lucca's historic opera house; telephone (39-0583) 493-678, fax (39-0583) 954-854. Rates are $71 for a single and  $124 for a double, breakfast included, but can actually vary wildly according to who you are.</p>
        <p>A smaller alternative is La Luna, Corte Campagnoni 12, telephone (39-0583) 493634, fax (39-0583) 490021; $52 single and $81 double, with breakfast buffet $7 per person.</p>
        <p>The Piccolo Hotel Puccini, Via di Poggio 9, (39-0583) 55421, fax (39-0583) 53487, charges $44.50 single and $61 double.Lucca's recent discovery by tourists has caught the city short of hotels. But newer ones are appearing almost monthly.</p>
        <p>Where to Eat</p>
        <p>For fancy dining with white tablecloth, spiffy service and splendid food and wine, try the Ristorante del Giglio, Piazza del Giglio 2, next door to the Hotel Universo, (39-0583) 494058. Forty to fifty dollars a person will take care of you splendidly.</p>
        <p>Da Giulio, Via della Conce 45/47, near the city walls, is a family favorite for locals; (39-0583) 55948. At Da Guido, Via C. Battisti 28, you will be hard pressed to spend more than $20 a person; (39-0583) 467219. Simple, straightforward and frugal is Slim Joes, at Corte Campano 3; (39-0583) 312037.</p>
        <p>Where to Shop</p>
        <p>Lucca has all the fancy international shops you will find on Madison Avenue, but for sweaters and woolen goods of unusual quality and imagination go to Bellandi Maglierie at Via Beccherie 25, just behind the Hotel Universo; (39-0583) 496052.</p>
