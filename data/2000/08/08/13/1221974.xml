        <p>AIDS DOCTORS</p>
        <p>Voices From the Epidemic.</p>
        <p>By Ronald Bayer and Gerald M. Oppenheimer.</p>
        <p>310 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Oxford University Press. $27.50.</p>
        <p>In 1994, during a break at a medical conference, I sat in a plush hotel lobby talking with an old friend. ''I have something to tell you,'' he said with premonitory earnestness. ''I have AIDS.'' No, I thought. No, you work on AIDS. You are an expert on AIDS policies and issues. In this epidemic there are doctors and there are patients, and you are a doctor. ''I have AIDS,'' he persevered. ''And I'm afraid I don't have long.''</p>
        <p>Within a year he was dead. But he is an exception. The recent onset of the epidemic, as well as the youth of most of the physicians who rose to fight it, means that most of them remain alive and active today. These physicians are an engaged and articulate group of men and women who have cared for AIDS patients, pioneered new treatments and struggled with the epidemic's vexing biological, clinical and social issues. Many of them have played multiple roles -- clinician and researcher, healer and gay activist, policy maker and layer-on of hands. In 1994, Ronald Bayer, who teaches at the Joseph L. Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University, and Gerald M. Oppenheimer, who teaches at Brooklyn College, set out to talk to as many of these AIDS doctors as possible, taping and transcribing 75 oral histories in the following years. ''AIDS Doctors: Voices From the Epidemic'' is their report from the front line -- and it is an extraordinary report.</p>
        <p>Bayer and Oppenheimer have succeeded in capturing the varied and often arresting voices of people whom inclination or chance put in the way of one of the monumental events of the 20th century. We hear personal accounts of doubt, frustration, bigotry, anger and death as well as of the fascination of science, the gratification of hand-holding and the joy of clinical breakthroughs. Paradoxes abound. Some talk of the incredible sense of being on the cusp of history, defining something that has never been seen before, while others describe the fear of taking an unknown killer home to their loved ones at the end of the workday. For some, AIDS was a career maker, ''a new epidemic under my nose,'' while others recall being shunned by senior academicians, who wrote them off as working with ''a very unattractive disease.''</p>
        <p>The personal accounts add up to more than instructive narrative. The book is really a biography of the epidemic itself. At a time when most people believed infectious diseases were bested, AIDS erupted, without a known cause, a clear pattern or even a name. ''There was no history,'' Paul Volberding of San Francisco General Hospital observes. ''We were it.'' Richard Chaisson of Johns Hopkins, who had contemplated working abroad on schistosomiasis or malaria, recalls that ''I didn't have to go anywhere, that I was surrounded by an incredible epidemic . . . that people were walking away from.'' And people did walk away -- at first from pure fear but, as the epidemiology of the disease became clearer, because of antagonism to or lack of interest in those most affected, gay men and intravenous drug users. Carol Brosgart had a sense of being a pariah when she joined the staff at the Alta Bates Hospital in Berkeley, Calif. She remembers meeting a new colleague: ''And just as we were about to shake hands and I said, 'I run the AIDS program,' he took his hand away from me. And then he said, 'Oh, I'm sorry; I guess you can't get AIDS that way.' ''</p>
        <p>Much of the book memorializes the colossal frustration of AIDS doctors during the middle years, when the course of the disease was clear, the shape of the oncoming epidemic was alarming and there was little they could do to help. ''I realized I was a travel agent for death,'' Constance Wofsy of San Francisco General reports, ''and that my role was to make the process as drawn out, as comfortable and as full of interesting things as it was possible to do.''</p>
        <p>These were years of funerals, assisted suicides, burnout and more funerals. In 1986, the first clinical trials of AZT began and the era of treatment was underway. Controversy, however, raged around the conduct of the trials and the proper use of the drug. Martin Hirsch, an AIDS researcher, recalls the chagrin and fear he felt at hearing Larry Kramer, the founder of Act Up, proclaim on national radio, ''What we need is a few assassinations and maybe they'll start listening to us.'' AZT has been followed by new and ever more effective antiretroviral agents that blunt symptoms and extend life. By 1999, people were living on with treated AIDS; as the infectious disease specialist Abigail Zuger puts it: ''It's a disease. It's not a way of life.''</p>
        <p>AIDS doctors have been at the biological front lines for 20 years, but they have also participated in a series of collateral mini-revolutions. AIDS has stimulated and legitimized the discussion of homosexuality and, indeed, of sex in general in America. The disease has challenged the brother's keeper in each of us by dramatizing the fault line between the culture of poverty, beset by endemic drug use and a smoldering AIDS epidemic, and the culture of the rest of us, called on to respond with sympathy and tax dollars. HIV/AIDS also created a new kind of patient, who, out of desperation and intelligence, reads medical journals and challenges clinicians and researchers. ''I think we as physicians realized that, in the first place, you couldn't buck that type,'' Marcus Conant, a pioneer in developing ways to share information with his patients, said about his experiences in the earlier days of the epidemic. ''That is the way it should be, and particularly when you cannot, in fact, save their lives.'' AIDS patients have been in the forefront of democratizing and ''consumerizing'' medical care -- and so, perforce, have their doctors.</p>
        <p>Bayer and Oppenheimer have not deployed oral history in its most common form, as a chronological narrative that gives the reader a full picture of an individual. Rather, they use multiple short excerpts to amplify and punctuate the story. This effectively brings many perspectives into play, creating a rolling and colorful chorus of voices, but the portraits of the doctors themselves are never fully developed. Yet it is hard to argue with the potency of the product. ''AIDS Doctors'' walks us through the American epidemic with grace, drama and a mastery of the social history of a profoundly important event. It deserves to sit on the bookshelf alongside the earlier classics of the epidemic, Randy Shilts's ''And the Band Played On,'' Abraham Verghese's ''My Own Country'' and Abigail Zuger's ''Strong Shadows.''</p>
