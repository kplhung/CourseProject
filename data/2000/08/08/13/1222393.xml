        <p>Taiwan's new president, Chen Shui-bian, today abruptly canceled an informal reception with several members of Congress planned for Sunday in California after vigorous protests from China and expressions of concern by the State Department.</p>
        <p>The reception had been organized by Representative Sam Gejdenson, Democrat of Connecticut, as an opportunity for Mr. Chen to meet a bipartisan group of lawmakers, many of whom are gathering in Los Angeles for the Democratic National Convention.</p>
        <p>But aides to Mr. Chen, who is staying in California overnight on Sunday on his way to the Caribbean and Central America, informed Mr. Gejdenson's office that the meeting would not take place. Amos Hochstein, Mr. Gejdenson's senior policy adviser, said tonight that the Taiwanese did not give a reason but that all indications pointed to pressure from China and the State Department.</p>
        <p>China considers Taiwan a renegade province and fights efforts by Taiwanese officials to gain even the appearance of diplomatic status.</p>
        <p>The United States has maintained only informal relations with Taiwan since it established diplomatic relations with the government in Beijing in 1979. The State Department granted Mr. Chen a transit visa, citing its desire to provide ''for the safety, convenience and comfort'' of Mr. Chen and his party.</p>
        <p>But administration officials  stressed that they did not favor Mr. Chen's meeting with lawmakers or other American officials in a way that could be construed as official contacts.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gejdenson, the ranking Democrat on the House Committee on International Relations, said in a curt statement released by his office tonight, ''I regret that State Department and administration officials have pressured President Chen to refrain with meeting members of Congress during his visit.''</p>
        <p>The cancellation appears to avoid a potentially divisive diplomatic confrontation with China. In 1995, after the administration granted a visa for Taiwan's president at the time, Lee Teng-hui, to visit Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y., China withdrew its ambassador from the United States and conducted war games that culminated in the firing of missiles in the Taiwan Strait.</p>
        <p>Ever since his election in March, Mr. Chen has been viewed with deep suspicion by the Chinese government because he had previously supported independence for Taiwan, although he has muted those views since taking office.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hochstein said the reception, which was to take place in the Santa Monica home of a former aide to Mr. Gejdenson, was not meant to be an official visit.</p>
        <p>''He didn't think this should have been controversial,'' he said. ''It was an informal meeting and at an unofficial place. We just happened to be in Los Angeles at the same time.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  August 19, 2000, Saturday  An article on Sunday about a decision by President Chen Shui-Bian of Taiwan to cancel a meeting with American congressmen in California after protests by China and expressions of concern from the State Department misstated the year China fired missiles near Taiwan. It was 1996, before Taiwan's presidential election -- not 1995, during a dispute over a visit to the United States by Mr. Chen's predecessor.</p>
