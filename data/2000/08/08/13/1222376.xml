        <p>Charlie Woo is the sort of business and civic leader one would expect to find at the head of the welcoming line at the Democratic National Convention next week, and, in fact, he will be, as  a vice chairman of the city's host committee.</p>
        <p>But perhaps the most revealing aspect of Mr. Woo's prominence and devotion to an impressive array of community organizations is the boards that he -- like many of the other successful people in the city's new wave of leaders -- is not on.</p>
        <p>Mr. Woo will soon become the first Asian-American chairman of the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce, and he has helped guide groups involved in everything from voter registration to inner-city job development and Chinese-American political fund-raising. But even though he is an obvious candidate, he has no involvement in the prestigious institutions that once stood at the apex of civic life here, the philanthropies, art museums and especially the downtown Performing Arts Center.</p>
        <p>''That represents a different world that isn't relevant to me in the same way these things might have been in the past,'' said Mr. Woo, a toy manufacturer. ''The power shift that is taking place here is not just new ethnic groups rising, but a new approach to how you get involved.''</p>
        <p>Major public events like the Democratic convention are opportunities for the host cities to put a well-scrubbed face forward and for their power elite to stand on a national stage, displaying a shared sense of civic pride and identity.</p>
        <p>But in Los Angeles, a sprawling concatenation of communities with a restless multiethnic character, there is no single ''face,'' in the usual sense of the word. A surge of immigration and the rapid shift toward an economy dominated by small businesses rather than huge corporations have pushed Los Angeles into a dizzyingly complex transition.</p>
        <p>The city, with a population nearing four million, has lost its white majority and will soon have a Latino majority, with a swiftly growing number of Asian-Americans. But despite these shifts, the power elite at the most well-recognized civic bodies remains heavily white.</p>
        <p>For instance, the Performing Arts Center, formerly known as the Music Center and once the most prestigious social prize, today has 81 board members, 4 of whom are minority members. There are 2 minority  members on the Los Angeles County Museum of Art's 39-member board, and the pattern of underrepresentation of the city's emerging minorities is similar at some other traditionally important boards, from the Huntington Library to the University of Southern California.</p>
        <p>As many leaders point out, there is, in truth, no single power elite here today, but many, some of whom are just emerging and have made it clear they have little interest in the traditional avenues for civic involvement, which had long been closed to them. This has long been true for Hollywood power brokers, who have historically shown almost no interest in the standard civic groups, and now the attitude seems to be spreading to emerging ethnic groups.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the host committee for the Democratic convention limped from one crisis to another, at least partly  because there was no longer a lengthy A-list of reliable contributors to call whenever a financing problem arose. There have been plenty of other disappointments, from the tepid new millennium celebration to the city's continued failure to secure a professional football team, all considered a product of the lack of a shared vision by a unified power group. But the most potent symbol of the decline of the old order was the sale of The Los Angeles Times earlier this year to the Tribune Company of Chicago by its controlling shareholders, the Chandler family, which once defined civic commitment but has now all but vanished.</p>
        <p>Today, few of Los Angeles's governing elites really know one another well, lunch together or golf together, or share much beyond a conviction that the whole notion of civic leadership must be broadened.</p>
        <p>The Democrats, in short, will be seeking to define themselves for the new millennium in a city that has lost its unified old civic aristocracy and has yet to find a new one.</p>
        <p>''In the old days there was a real power structure and it was clearly defined and you knew how to access it,'' said Gordon Davidson, a founder and artistic director of the Center Theater Group at the Performing Arts Center, home to many of the city's most festive and elite fund-raising galas. ''The sad thing now is that we don't have it in the same way. It's a healthy sign, but it means you have to work a lot harder.''</p>
        <p>He added: ''Frankly, it's what makes being here still something of an adventure. The question that I don't really have an answer to is, who is setting the pace?''</p>
        <p>Linda Griego, an entrepreneur and a former deputy mayor, says she grows slightly irritated when asked why the old-line boards do not have more Latino or Asian-American or black members. In short, she said, many elites from minority groups are frustrated that these older organizations have not been more aggressive in courting them. But she said that leaders who are members of minorities often do not join those boards, even when they are invited, because their missions did not seem to serve the ethnic population.</p>
        <p>''The old aristocracy is really gone,'' said Ms. Griego, who has served on boards as varied as hospitals, community redevelopment, the local community college system and the city's cultural affairs office. ''It was kind of a downtown, music-center nucleus, based on old families and huge corporations. But what I ask is, where would a Latina get a feeling of fulfillment, of having made it? I think it's a different kind of civic board.''</p>
        <p>For instance, Dominic Ng, the chairman of the EastWest Bank here, said that when he was first urged to join the high-status local board of the United Way about five years ago, he hesitated.</p>
        <p>''My first reaction was, why should I join? They don't do much for the Asian-American or even the Hispanic communities,'' said Mr. Ng, an immigrant from Hong Kong. But he said he was persuaded that by joining he could help alter the philanthropy's mission, and, with the help of some committed board colleagues, he has. The United Way has cut back on its contributions to traditional recipients, like the American Heart Association, and poured money into programs that will help train new immigrants for jobs and help them buy homes. Mr. Ng is now the board's vice chairman. He serves on other boards as well, but he said that he sees little need to join the traditional boards of the old power elite.</p>
        <p>''Many of those organizations have asked me, but I declined,'' Mr. Ng said. ''I feel I need first to help the poor and to really help change the community.''</p>
        <p>Economics have exerted a major influence over these trends. Nearly all of the Fortune 500 companies that once had headquarters in Los Angeles, from Arco and Unocal to the First Interstate Bank, have been acquired or have moved elsewhere. Along with this shift, the downtown district has atrophied, as the thriving new businesses have tended to move to other parts of the city and region.</p>
        <p>Instead, this has become an economy that is dominated by myriad small companies. And members of minorities have found it far easier to rise in the entrepreneurial ranks than in the old corporate hierarchies, a fact that has also contributed to the changing civic architecture of Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>''We know we have to reach out more,'' said Joanne Corday Kozberg, the president of the Performing Arts Center. ''We need to reach the entrepreneurial base, and by that you really mean a lot of people of color. You have to look at where the community is going. We may need to focus more on trade, and we hadn't done that before.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Davidson, of the theater group, said one irony was the fact that his staff was far more diverse than his board, in part because it was proving far easier to find minority artists interested in working at the theater than in finding minority business leaders interested in setting artistic policy. That still leaves many people here frustrated.</p>
        <p>''There is a disconnect between the changing face of Los Angeles and the political, economic and civic leadership circles,'' said Antonio Villaraigosa, a former speaker of the California Assembly. ''Los Angeles is the Ellis Island of the west. These civic organizations really lag what is happening in the population.''</p>
        <p>He said the key to the changes and the city's future vitality was not that some of the old elite organizations are opening their doors, but that the more dynamic leaders are forging their own paths, without feeling obliged to follow in the footsteps of the elites of previous generations.</p>
        <p>Luis Nogales, a child of migrant farm laborers who was recently named to the board of the J. Paul Getty Trust, expressed frustration at the pace of civic change and a sobering view of the multiple barriers that will need to fall to speed the pace.</p>
        <p>''I've had too many firsts,'' said Mr. Nogales, an entrepreneur who was the first Latino graduate of Stanford's law school and the first Latino trustee of Stanford. ''One of the problems is that the first step is usually for show. But I make it a point not to be the last Hispanic member of those boards, and that takes a lot of work.''  He added: ''It's a good start to be on a board, but it's a start. I'm not satisfied to just get the appointment. I come with an agenda. Making any difference means you have to work twice as hard.''</p>
