        <p>That ceaseless scratching, clapping and clicking coming from a warehouse here, just inland from Long Beach Island, is the sound of the Jersey Shore's unofficial pet -- the hermit crab. More precisely, it is the sound of about 100,000 of the critters.</p>
        <p>That is because Bill and Martha Huelsenbeck, the owners of Shell Shanty Inc. here, are among the largest wholesalers of hermit crabs in the United States.</p>
        <p>The creatures -- whose average owner is a 10-year-old child -- are waiting to be shipped to department stores, gift shops and pet emporiums not only along the shore, but as far afield as boardwalks in California, souvenir shops in Idaho and amusement parks in Kansas. Once there, they will be sold for about $1.99 and if they buyer is lucky, the crab may live to see the teenage years -- though they generally succumb earlier.</p>
        <p>''The hermit crab is the best pet for a little kid, which means the kids love them, parents love them and even grandma loves them,'' said Mr. Huelsenbeck, 54, who last week was making room in his warehouse for a large shipment of hermit crabs coming into Atlantic City Airport from their native Caribbean.</p>
        <p>The hermit crab -- also known as the soldier crab or the land crab -- is native not to the Jersey Shore, but to the beaches of the Florida Keys and the Caribbean islands. They began gaining in popularity in this region in the early 1970's, when some states outlawed the sale of painted turtles because their excrement was spreading salmonella.</p>
        <p>At that time the Huelsenbecks were running a shell shop in Beach Haven. One of their distributors was a North Carolina man by the name of Woodrow Stetson, who had recently vacationed in Florida. After seeing hermit crabs as pets in small shops down there, he figured he would try to sell them in his main markets: Myrtle Beach, S.C.; Ocean City, Md.; and Long Beach Island.</p>
        <p>The Huelsenbecks took a chance on Mr. Stetson's new item, and soon they said they were selling hundreds of them a month. When Mr. Stetson retired in 1986, they bought his growing wholesale hermit crab business.</p>
        <p>Now, the Huelsenbecks say, they sell more than a million of the little crabs and their shells every year. Not only that, Shell Shanty has a 55-item catalog of hermit crab accessories: hermit crab gravel in assorted colors; hermit crab bathing ponds; hermit crab treats; Choya wood hermit crab tunnels; Hermit the Crab magnets; hermit crab mini-condos.</p>
        <p>The Huelsenbecks have also published two books: ''The Land Hermit Crab Handbook,'' about caring for hermit crabs, which was dedicated to Mr. Stetson, and ''Hermit the Crab,'' an educational book illustrated by the Huelsenbeck's niece, Ashley F. Gamble, as a high school art project in 1997.</p>
        <p>Despite the Shell Shanty's distribution network and huge volume, the business is quite homey. There are the workshop where the Huelsenbecks and some of their teenage employees assemble plastic and wire cages and a bin in the corner of the warehouse where they mix the secret formula for hermit crab food and treats.</p>
        <p>Most of the crabs are kept in two former refrigerator trailers that used to haul fish. Because the trailers are so well insulated, they are easy to heat in the winter and cool in the summer. Mr. Huelsenbeck has also built another domed structure with mulch and driftwood on the floor and lots of places to climb for the larger and older hermit crabs that he sometimes sends back to the Caribbean for breeding.</p>
        <p>''We've gone down there to see what works to keep hermit crabs alive, which is the point of someone buying them,'' he said. The Huelsenbecks get their hermit crabs from harvesters in Haiti and the Turks and Caicos Islands.</p>
        <p>He said Florida was not a good place for harvesting hermit crabs because so many people went there to collect shells, which is where hermit crabs make their home. Hermit crabs in the wild love to change shells, said Mr. Huelsenbeck, so Haiti -- where people eat shellfish and throw the shells on the beach -- is an ideal place from which to import the crabs.</p>
        <p>Most of the crabs for sale are at least 2 years old. An adult crab lays about 50,000 eggs at a time in the ocean, and they swim around for six months to a year if they are fortunate enough not to be eaten by fish or reptiles. The survivors crawl onto land, and their gills modify so they can begin breathing. They still need moisture, but they can no longer live underwater. And they start slipping in and out of shells for protection and warmth.</p>
        <p>Care of hermit crabs is simple, said Mr. Huelsenbeck. Keep the cage or aquarium damp and warm; 78 degrees is the optimum temperature. Throw in a good supply of different kinds of food -- anything from unsweetened cereal to fish to fruit to his mixes and a dish of drinking water. Put in at least two shells per crab, so they can vary their habitat. And then just watch and giggle along with their scratching and crabby movements.</p>
        <p>''The average age of a hermit crab buyer is about 10,'' said Mrs. Huelsenbeck. ''That means they like brightly painted shells and reflecting colors and just love their pets.''</p>
        <p>The Huelsenbecks import many of their painted shells from India and the Philippines, but also collect some smaller ones from the Jersey Shore. Mr. Huelsenbeck said the crabs tended to like smooth, snail-like shells, so they can grab on and slide in quickly.</p>
        <p>Though they still run a shell shop in Beach Haven at Schooner's Wharf, the Huelsenbecks spend most of their summer working at the inland warehouse here, caring for the crabs and then sending them to customers -- often in two shipments a week in summer, when some larger shops can sell at least 200 crabs a week.</p>
        <p>''It's been a great business, and nothing we would have thought when Woodrow first brought them to us,'' said Mr. Huelsenbeck. ''And it's great to think that we bring such easy pleasure to so many kids.''</p>
