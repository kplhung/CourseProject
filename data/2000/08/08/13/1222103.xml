        <p>MORE than a century's worth of tradition haunts the corridors of Swezey's, but the president, William L. Knapp, doesn't think for a moment that tradition brings customers through the door.</p>

        <p>MORE than a century's worth of tradition haunts the corridors of Swezey's, but the president, William L. Knapp, doesn't think for a moment that tradition brings customers through the door.</p>
        <p>''The customer,'' he said, ''cares about what's on the shelves today. And getting it promptly in the right size from a pleasant, knowledgeable employee. We feel that when we bring customers through the door, that's their experience, and they'll come back because of it.''</p>
        <p>Next month Mr. Knapp cuts the ribbon on the family-owned chain's new department store, a $10 million, 100,000-square-foot building rising on the western edge of downtown Patchogue, not far from the original 1894 storefront. A survivor from the days when Swezey's was the backbone of Long Island retailing, the Island's second-oldest department store (Hildreth's, in Southampton, takes the prize) is intent on carving out a niche among a generation of young adults who shop in malls rather than on Main Street.</p>
        <p>The opening of the new store is supported by the first television advertising campaign Swezey's has done in more than a decade. Developed by EGC Media in Hicksville, the million-dollar campaign includes a rhyming jingle that suggests that shoppers will find more at Swezey's than they expect, and will have fun doing so.</p>
        <p>''A new generation of shoppers has grown up or moved here who haven't been to Swezey's,'' Mr. Knapp said. ''The new building will bring many of them in the door. It will be up to us to keep them coming back.''</p>
        <p>The opening of the new store, built on the foundation of a crumbling 19th-century lace mill, positions Swezey's, which had $32 million in sales last year, to compete against an invasion of much larger, out-of-town retailers including Kohl's, which opened seven stores on the Island in March and plans three more by October, and Target, which has seven stores on the Island, two of them new in the last six months.</p>
        <p>''Heritage is usually more important to the retailer than to the customer,'' said Joe Madenberg, whose Huntington Station company, the Retail Survey Group, has polled nearly 10,000 customers and prospective customers of Swezey's over the years. ''One of Bill's strengths as a retailer is that he realizes that.''</p>
        <p>When Mr. Knapp's great-grandfather, Arthur M. Swezey, opened the first store on Main Street in 1894, customers hitched their horses outside. Swezey's grew to include stores in Riverhead, Setauket, Babylon and, last year, Glen Cove. Generations of Swezey family members drove home the importance of service to generations of sales personnel, many of whom stayed with the company throughout their careers. Mr. Knapp, a Swezey on his mother's side, occasionally reinforces the tradition by hopping in a truck to deliver an order to a customer's door. More routinely, sales associates greet shoppers by name, gift wrap items free and tote packages to the parking lot.</p>
        <p>''Swezey's is the kind of store where you can return an item after a year, without a receipt, and if it's not abused, they refund your money,'' said Mayor Ed Ihne of Patchogue.</p>
        <p>Today's younger shoppers, however, don't necessarily expect salespeople to be friendly or knowledgeable, or even visible on the sales floor. To establish Swezey's with the 20- and 30-somethings, the store asked EGC Media to focus on merchandise, lifestyles and the store's personalized service.</p>
        <p>''The new advertising campaign shows how Swezey's combines Nordstrom-quality customer service with Macy's-style merchandising savvy,'' said Ernie Canadeo, president of EGC Media. ''The store delivers an exciting and contemporary shopping experience, and that's what the ad campaign conveys.''</p>
        <p>The campaign will begin in late August with back-to-school spots, then resume in October. The spots will run on News 12 and Channel 55, and WALK and WBLI radio.</p>
        <p>The ads are intended to update market perceptions about the chain. ''Customers -- and people in the market we would like as customers -- used words like old-fashioned, or dowdy, to describe our merchandise mix,'' Mr. Knapp said. ''We had to change that perception.''</p>
        <p>The cramped flagship store, now occupying four buildings on Patchogue's Main Street, didn't help with its labyrinth of low ceilings and mid-century fixtures. When Mr. Knapp became president in 1980, however, upgrading the Main Street store's image was far from a priority.</p>
        <p>''The 80's were a fantastic decade to be in retailing,'' Mr. Knapp recalled. ''You put something on the floor and you sold it. In the 90's, the rules changed.''</p>
        <p>By the mid-1990's, Mr. Knapp had begun instructing the store's buyers to bring in more fashionable merchandise, especially clothing. 'We wanted to be perceived as more fashion forward,'' he said, ''carrying the same brands you would get at a store like Macy's but with service you won't get in a mall.''</p>
        <p>Today, women choose from such names as Eileen Fisher and XOXO while men drape themselves in Tommy Hilfiger, Guess and other trendy brands.</p>
        <p>''These brands are more often associated with larger department stores,'' said David Knapp, a menswear buyer and the president's brother. Because sales of trendier merchandise are harder to predict, ''buying them carries more of a risk for the store,'' he added, ''but it's what our customers tell us they want.''</p>
        <p>Joel Evans, a professor of management at Hofstra University, defined Swezey's as competing in the mid-market range with Macy's and Stern's. ''Target is a discounter,'' he said. ''Kohl's comparatively has more ambience but still occupies the niche -- and mainly the same stores -- as Caldor's once did. But both are competing on price, where stores like Nordstrom's and Bloomingdale's compete on ambience and service.</p>
        <p>''The middle market,'' he continued, ''has become the toughest place to define yourself on Long Island.''</p>
        <p>Responding to the increasingly competitive retail environment, Mr. Knapp began investing in growth and modernization. Three years ago he hired Inner Vision, a Manhattan design agency specializing in retailing, to reshape the Setauket branch.</p>
        <p>The president of Inner Vision, Joseph Weiscar, found a store stuck in the 1970's. ''There were terrific traffic problems and operational problems,'' he said. Merchandise was hidden in boxy, decades-old cabinets; Mr. Weiscar had them removed and replaced with multilevel displays that used visual cues to bring customers toward the center of the store.</p>
        <p>Mr. Knapp was pleased by the 10 percent boost in sales at the Setauket store, and awarded Inner Vision a major role in designing the Patchogue flagship.</p>
        <p>The new building may draw curious shoppers, but will they return? And will the store's loyal base of traditional shoppers feel unwelcome?</p>
        <p>''That's one of the hardest things to do in retailing: expand your target market while retaining the loyalty of your longtime customers,'' said Joel Evans, a management professor at Hofstra and author of ''Retail Manager'' (Prentice Hall), now in its eighth edition. ''Sears has tried it; J. C. Penney has tried it. Both failed, and miserably.''</p>
        <p>To maintain the loyalty of long-time shoppers, Professor Evans said, Swezey's will need to communicate artfully to regular visitors that it will continue to carry items those customers buy and that their business is still valued. ''They need to get that message out through promotions and mailings, and any way they can,'' Professor Evans said.</p>
        <p>L.I. @ WORK  Correction:  August 20, 2000, Sunday  The L.I.@Work column last Sunday, about Swezey's department stores and their struggle for market share on Long Island, misstated the name of an interior design consultant to Swezey's. It is New Vision Studios, not Inner Vision. The column also misspelled the surname of New Vision's president. He is Joseph Weishar, not Weiscar.</p>
