        <p>In the article ''A Place of Their Own, With a Difference'' (July 9), the writer paints a positive picture of the growth of assisted-living facilities. Many of us who have gone through the process of finding a place to live on behalf of an elderly relative have different stories to tell.</p>
        <p>Most new places are very attractive; this does not mean that there are enough staff members to handle an aging population or that the staff is properly trained. Since the average stay in an assisted-living facility is two years, once an elderly person starts to fade, they may be hurried out so that the facility is not liable for health crises. And since seniors pay their own way, they may find that they have spent the money they would need to get them into a good nursing home. While intermediate care is considerably more expensive, good facilities have enough staff and medical care, as well as Medicaid benefits.</p>
