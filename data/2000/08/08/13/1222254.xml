        <p>As Asian fever, cowboy cool, 60's modernism and vintage kitsch are all touching down on the fashion tarmac, a new fleet of books is taking off, on the quirkiest notions of chic. Style monitors have ventured to far-flung corners and brought back Ferlin Husky's dog-sled-embroidered jacket add Suzie Wong's signature cheongsam deress. The coffee table is groaning.</p>
        <p>When Flying Was Fun</p>
        <p>Back in the ''Coffee, Tea or Me?'' days, flight attendants were called stewardesses, and they had mystique. So did air travel. In ''Airline: Identity, Design and Culture,'' Keith Lovegrove, a design consultant, recalls those heady days. Examining the fashion, food and design of air travel, he recalls the hot pants and knee boots worn by Southwest Airlines stewardesses in the early 70's and celebrates the beauty of the sushi served in club class on Nippon Airways flights. He also marvels at the $2 million makeover that a hot young designer, Marc Newson, gave a private jet a couple of years back. The $42 million plane looks like an airborne version of Canteen, a SoHo restaurant designed by Mr. Newson, but it is no more exotic than an animal-print 747 ''tiger lounge'' bar built for Boeing as a prototype in 1972. The book (teNeues Publishing; $24.95, paperback) takes off in October.</p>
