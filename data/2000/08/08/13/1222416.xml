        <p>It is interesting how quickly fans forget. It was not long ago when Brett Favre, the Green Bay Packers quarterback, could have run for mayor in that city. Super Bowl appearances in the 1996 and 1997 seasons had revitalized football in Packersville, and Favre's rocket arm was the biggest reason for it.</p>
        <p>Now, on radio talk shows in Green Bay, fans and some members of the news media are questioning if Matt Hasselbeck, the backup quarterback, should replace Favre. Hasselbeck will indeed be a starter in this league. He is good, but is he better than Favre?</p>

        <p>It is interesting how quickly fans forget. It was not long ago when Brett Favre, the Green Bay Packers quarterback, could have run for mayor in that city. Super Bowl appearances in the 1996 and 1997 seasons had revitalized football in Packersville, and Favre's rocket arm was the biggest reason for it.</p>
        <p>Now, on radio talk shows in Green Bay, fans and some members of the news media are questioning if Matt Hasselbeck, the backup quarterback, should replace Favre. Hasselbeck will indeed be a starter in this league. He is good, but is he better than Favre?</p>
        <p>Will everyone please come back to this solar system?</p>
        <p>If the Packers are going to make a return to the Super Bowl, their best chance is with Favre, not Hasselbeck, who has been impressive in preseason games mostly against backup players (against the Jets last week, Hasselbeck completed 11 of 15 passes for 162 yards and 2 touchdowns). But he has yet to be tested on a consistent basis during the regular season against the starters of top defenses.</p>
        <p>Favre was not thrilled when he was asked about the Hasselbeck chatter, or the status of his sore throwing elbow. There is some mild concern in the Packers' organization that Favre will again battle arm and hand injuries, as he did last season, when a severely injured thumb disrupted his passing motion.</p>
        <p>''I haven't thought much about it,'' Favre said last week of the Hasselbeck talk. ''As far as I know, I'm still the starting quarterback, and they're paying me for it. When they stop doing that, I've got a tractor and you all can start talking about somebody else. I mean, there'll be another backup quarterback that comes in and the whole phenomenon will start over again.''</p>
        <p>On the persistent questions about his elbow, Favre, who was addressing reporters from a podium during his weekly news conference, said rather testily: ''I don't enjoy all these questions. I don't know if any of you would be standing up here.''</p>
        <p>Once again the old backup quarterback controversy is rearing its ugly head. No matter how many Super Bowls a quarterback wins, if he goes through a rough stretch there are always calls for the backup. John Elway, Dan Marino, Phil Simms, Terry Bradshaw, Joe Montana -- all great throwers who at one point heard calls for the understudy.</p>
        <p>Of course there is a reason the backup was the backup to begin with. But perspective is always the first victim when the controversy strikes.</p>
        <p>It is true that tendinitis in Favre's right elbow has affected his passes in camp, as have blisters on his hand. For now he is not throwing with that familiar Favre zip. As a result, Coach Mike Sherman has reduced Favre's throwing repetitions to rest the elbow. He is scheduled to play only a handful of series during today's preseason game against the Denver Broncos.</p>
        <p>Favre maintains his elbow is fine, and that if the season began today, his passes would be as deadly as ever. For the first time in his career, Favre is following the example of great veteran passers like Troy Aikman, who does not overwork his arm in camp.</p>
        <p>''I'm not going to do anything to jeopardize my throwing for when it really counts,'' Favre said. ''Nothing counts in preseason except for guys trying to make the team. That's as clear as I can state it.''</p>
        <p>''I'm not trying to prove anything to anybody right now,'' he added. ''I just want to survive preseason. Five years ago, I probably would take every snap. But I'm trying to be smart about it now.''</p>
        <p>Favre, whose 235 touchdown passes in the 1990's is the most of any quarterback, has been an unparalleled leader with a chance of being in the Hall of Fame. This is Favre's 10th season so it is no wonder Favre is having some physical problems with his arm.</p>
        <p>But bench Favre? Now? The idea is silly.</p>
        <p>Theismann Can Still Throw</p>
        <p>Joe Theismann, the ESPN analyst and former Washington Redskins quarterback, has been friends with Baltimore Coach Brian Billick for years. So when Thiesmann made an appearance at training camp last week, Billick thought he would break up the monotony by allowing the 50-year-old to toss a few passes to Ravens receivers, who were being covered by the secondary while running pass routes.</p>
        <p>Theismann's first throw was a bullet across the middle, only several inches too high. The zip on the ball was so strong, the Ravens players, almost in unison, shouted, ''Oooohhhhh!''</p>
        <p>Thiesmann was not done. His second throw was a perfect, tight spiral on a deep out pattern that was caught and led to several veterans joking that the backups had better watch out for their jobs.</p>
        <p>Despite still having a strong arm, Theismann is not about to come out of retirement. There was a time, though, when people wished the Ravens starter Tony Banks would try another sport. But after a dismal stint in St. Louis, Banks is entrenched as the starter in Baltimore, and so far the move to trade for him after the 1998 season has proven to be a brilliant one. Banks is making better reads and decisions and this is the most comfortable he has ever been in an offense.</p>
        <p>During a scrimmage earlier in camp against a good Ravens defense, Banks completed his first 13 passes, including a 17-yard touchdown pass to Jermaine Lewis. Over all, including last week's preseason game against Philadelphia, he has been excellent.</p>
        <p>It has helped Banks that he is in the first settled situation of his N.F.L. career. As a professional, he has never been in the same offensive system for two straight seasons remarkable considering this is his fifth season. And Billick's system is extremely quarterback friendly. Last season, Banks started the final 10 games, and finished 6-4, including a 4-0 record in December.</p>
        <p>''Tony has showed that he can run our offense efficiently,'' Billick said. ''I've said all along that Tony can step to another level if he stayed in the same offensive system for two years in a row.''</p>
        <p>Giants Considering Two Trades</p>
        <p>Are the Giants, usually conservative when it comes to making trades, thinking about making two?</p>
        <p>The chances of the Giants pulling off one trade by the end of the preseason are not as slim as one might believe, and neither is the possibility of a second deal.</p>
        <p>First, several general managers have said, the team is considering trading wide receiver Brian Alford, a third-round pick in 1997. The Giants are deep at his position and Alford, though he has shown flashes of talent at times in training camp this year, will likely get little playing time during the season. That makes him expendable.</p>
        <p>Those same general managers said the Giants, short on cornerbacks, are considering trading for Jerry Azumah, currently the third corner on the Chicago Bears' roster. The Bears may not cut Azumah, and the Giants think they might be able to steal him for a low-round draft choice.</p>
        <p>''You have to have patience with players,'' General Manager Ernie Accorsi of the Giants said of Alford. ''This player has had no chance to play. We have not given up on him.''</p>
        <p>Accorsi had no comment on Azumah, and would only say Giants scouts are looking at a number of players.</p>
        <p>Brown Outperforming Arrington</p>
        <p>The regular season has not started yet, but it is looking more and more like the Cleveland Browns made the right decision in picking the defensive lineman Courtney Brown with the No. 1 overall pick in April's N.F.L. draft.</p>
        <p>Browns officials say at times he has looked like the best player on the field. The athleticism scouts and coaches saw when he was at Penn State is showing on the professional level.</p>
        <p>Originally the team debated between choosing Brown or his college teammate LaVar Arrington, now with the Redskins. There is no question Arrington is going to be a good player as well. But Brown so far has a slight edge, mainly because he has been nothing but a true professional, while Arrington irritated coaches and players when in June he turned a one-day excused absence from minicamp into a four-day unexcused absence.</p>
