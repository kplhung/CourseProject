        <p>IN the genteel days of railroad tourism, the Canadian Rockies had predictable, limited flows of visitors who came to gawk at dramatic mountain crags that were marketed around the world as the second Switzerland. But now Banff National Park, the oldest park in Canada's system, has a busy, largely four-lane highway transecting it and an international airport only 90 minutes away, in Calgary. Flying to Calgary from Tokyo or piloting motor homes from Michigan, an estimated 4.4 million people visit the park every year, with another 4 million indulging in what park officials call ''windshield tourism'' as they drive through on the Trans-Canada Highway.</p>
        <p>In the peak days in July and August, the population of Banff can easily quadruple from its year-round population of 7,000. ''It's like a wall of metal,'' Pamela L. Veinotte, a Parks Canada tourism manager, said of the lines of recreational vehicles that wind up one mountain road to a major attraction, Moraine Lake, where still waters are framed by granite peaks.</p>
        <p>Even with high gasoline prices, the American tourist crush is not expected to abate this summer. Canada is a travel bargain as the American dollar fetches almost $1.50 Canadian. And even if Air Canada pilots conduct a slowdown or go on strike this month over pay and working issues stemming from the airline's ongoing merger with Canadian Airlines, there are alternatives. U.S. carriers offer direct flights linking Calgary with major American cities -- Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Houston, Los Angeles, Salt Lake City and San Francisco.  With a North American open skies agreement that began to take effect five years ago, the number of Americans flying to Canada increased by almost 60 percent during the 1990's, putting Canada on a par with Britain as Americans' favorite air travel destination after Mexico.</p>
        <p>To cope with this summer's crowds at Canada's most heavily visited park, planners have taken new steps to induce recreational-vehicle drivers to take shuttle buses, to reduce conflicts between tourists and wildlife and to cut down on the herds of tourists tromping through Chateau Lake Louise, the venerable resort hotel on the edge of the emerald lake.</p>
        <p>Starting last June, visitors have had the option of riding free shuttle buses between the Lake Louise Campground and Lake Louise and between the campground and Lake Moraine. Although passers-by may hail the buses, priority is given to drivers of recreational vehicles. As North American baby boomers age, park officials have detected an increase in motor homes and a decrease in back country camping.</p>
        <p>Also in June, managers at Chateau Lake Louise began to put much of the 488-room hotel off limits to nonguests, with the exception of the eight restaurants and a shopping arcade. Guests, some of whom were paying $250 a night for a room, had long complained of tourists filling up easy chairs in the hotel's famous Lakeview lounge.</p>
        <p>''It was the crowds -- people were paying a premium rate for a world-class experience for Lake Louise and were not getting it,'' Janet Eger, the hotel's director of public relations, said of the new restrictions on public access.</p>
        <p>Tourist encounters with bears, elk and wolves have long been a problem along the park's central valley and the park's two towns, Banff and Lake Louise. After tourists were injured by elk during calving season in the spring and rutting season in the fall, park officials moved last winter to relocate about two-thirds of Banff's elk population of 400 animals to remote park areas. Two small herds remain and are easily visible off the eastern edge of town, around the city golf course.</p>
        <p>''The locals notice the amount of flowers that are not eaten at night,'' said Dennis R. Shuler, Banff's part-time mayor. To minimize conflicts with grizzlies, park officials have cracked down on bird feeders, on the grounds they attract bears, have temporarily closed some campgrounds and trails, and have harassed bears with noisemakers to teach them to stay away from humans.</p>
        <p>At Moraine Lake, where several trails were closed in past summers because of  grizzlies in the area, the park is experimenting with allowing hikers to go out in groups of six or more, on the theory that there is greater safety in numbers.</p>
        <p>Wardens patrol the Bow Valley Parkway, an unfenced valley road that parallels the Trans-Canada Highway, looking for ''bear jams,'' or traffic backups in front of bears and other wildlife. One road section now has a temporary speed limit of 20 miles an hour because a wolf litter was spotted near the road in early June. After a cougar attacked and injured a loose dog near Banff in April, wardens increased warnings to visitors to keep dogs on leashes.</p>
        <p>Although hotels in the park offer 8,800 beds, space tightens in the peak season of July and August. In May, the neighboring town of Cranmore closed off one loophole, passing a law that forbids homeowners from renting their homes for periods of less than 28 days. In illustration of how tourism pressure is spilling out of the park, Cranmore now fines illegal tourist homes up to $3,000 -- more than double the fines for unauthorized logging.</p>
