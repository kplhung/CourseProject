        <p>Astronomers this week added nine to their tally of planets known to orbit other stars, bringing the total to more than 45. Among the newly discovered planets is one orbiting the star Epsilon Eridani, located only 10.5 light-years from Earth.</p>
        <p>Epsilon Eridani was one of two stars focused on in 1960 in the first search for radio signals from alien civilizations -- and the first false alarm. As soon as a radio telescope was pointed at the stars, loud, pulsing signals immediately burst from the loudspeakers, which turned out to be interference from a passing plane. More recent listening efforts by the SETI Institute of Mountain View, Calif., have not heard anything.</p>
