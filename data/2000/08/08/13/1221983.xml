        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The review of ''Door Wide Open'' (July 23) uses the occasion of letters between Jack Kerouac and his girlfriend Joyce Johnson (nee Glassman) to determine who is the better writer, concluding that Kerouac is not. Would a review of the correspondence between Pound and Eliot come down to such a comparison? As a longtime scholar on the Beats, I find the current trend toward Kerouac bashing vexing.</p>

        <p>Let us agree, Kerouac is not for everyone. The language of his more experimental books, like ''Visions of Cody'' (written after ''On the Road''), is uneven, at times brilliant, at times problematic. The reviewer's assertion that after ''On the Road'' his writing ''dissolved in alcohol and crude self-parody'' is simply a cliche borrowed from wrongheaded critics. The review misses what is truly special in this correspondence: though Johnson was the more smitten one, these writers were engaged in a writerly discourse, unusual for the male-dominated Beat arena. As the poet Anne Waldman has said, the men were simply not passing on the wisdom to women. In this relationship, Kerouac was.</p>
