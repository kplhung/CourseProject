        <p>Even as the Republican Town Supervisor of Oyster Bay, John Venditto, and the Democratic Councilwoman Bonnie Eisler work together for a bipartisan water protection plan, Councilman Anthony D. Macagnone weighs in on the side of development at any cost [Letter, July 30].</p>
        <p>The supervisor and the councilwoman are considering a limited, one-year moratorium on new development in a state-designated groundwater protection area in Jericho, Woodbury and Syosset.</p>
        <p>In Mr. Macagnone's view, construction of 270 housing units on the 81-acre Underhill property in Jericho would be good for taxpayers and the economy even if it would be deadly for the environment.</p>
        <p>He also argues that the Oyster Bay town government is already protecting drinking water through ''reasonable and orderly planning and development'' and a ''comprehensive review process for all proposals for development.'' This, less than a month after a state appeals court blasted the town's lack of review before rezoning the Underhill property, saying, ''One might reasonably query whether town officials were really ever concerned about the environmental effects of the proposed development.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Macagnone is an apologist for those who would finish paving over the last remaining open space in Nassau County without regard for a need as basic as protecting our supply of drinking water.</p>
