        <p>Something New</p>
        <p>Reflections on the Beginnings</p>
        <p>of a Marriage.</p>
        <p>By Amanda Beesley.</p>
        <p>Doubleday, $21.95.</p>
        <p>This is less chirpy than it might have been; after all, ''Something New'' is partly based on a monthly column Amanda Beesley wrote for Self magazine about her first year of marriage. The tone is more ''Barefoot in the Park'' than ''Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'' The book, unlike the columns, also tells the story of Beesley's ailing mother, whose dementia was diagnosed two days after Beesley, then 29, became engaged. (By the way, Beesley's husband, Nicholas Weinstock, is the son of Betsy Weinstock, who wrote Martha Stewart's ''Weddings.'' It seems matrimony is the topic in this clan.) Though ''Something New'' has its charms, there are minor irritations throughout: Beesley's dream analyses are tiresome, for instance, and certain characters, like her father, never come to life. (Bouts of cuteness are also nettlesome. She admires a couple who serve ''I Do Brew'' at their wedding.) But Beesley is also capable of some sharp, wistful insights: she and Weinstock are ''always responding to each other: a hundred times a day, a hundred ways a minute. That's what makes me so attached to my husband. And that's what makes me, at times like this, so enormously tired.'' And she can be pleasantly arch: talking to a single friend, Beesley feels ''as if marriage were some stodgy idea that went out of style with Dorothy Hamill haircuts.'' At the least, ''Something New'' isn't stodgy. It's even worth committing to, for better, for worse.</p>
