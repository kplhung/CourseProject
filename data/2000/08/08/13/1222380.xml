        <p>Following are excerpts from an interview with Hillary Rodham Clinton at her hotel in Century City today.</p>
        <p>Q. Is there a danger that what you and President Clinton are doing here could overshadow Mr. Gore's week here?</p>
        <p>A. No. We've talked about it. Everything we're doing has been coordinated with the vice president and Tipper and top levels of our staffs. We're doing everything we can to send a very clear message that if America liked the Clinton-Gore administration, they will like the Gore-Lieberman administration. And that there is a continuity here, a commitment to the same issues, a focus on the New Democratic philosophy.</p>
        <p>That's why the convention has been planned the way it is -- where we came early and we will leave Tuesday morning, and we will join the Gores and there will be an almost, I don't know how to describe it exactly, but a kind of passing on, that is, a very explicit statement by the president about his strong support for and affection for and admiration for the vice president. And then we're done. We're gone.</p>
        <p>Q. On the race in New York: Why do you think it is that after everything you've done, in terms of drawing contrasts with your opponent, you and Mr. Lazio seem to be tied in almost every public poll?</p>
        <p>A. I don't think people have paid a lot of attention to politics yet. And this is not at all surprising to me. . . . If people really confront the choices that they face, between me and my opponent, they will know what happens to be true, which is that my stand on issues and what I will do in the Senate is much more in line with the majority of New Yorkers. He's the Republican-conservative candidate. New York is neither Republican nor conservative when it comes to guns and choice and education and health care and the economy. So I have a lot of energy for this coming campaign.</p>
