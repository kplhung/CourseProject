        <p>The Nazi Olympics</p>
        <p>Berlin 1936.</p>
        <p>By Susan D. Bachrach.</p>
        <p>Illustrated. 136 pp. Boston:</p>
        <p>Little, Brown &amp; Company. $21.95. (Ages 10 and up)</p>
        <p>The sepia photograph on the jacket of ''The Nazi Olympics: Berlin 1936'' shows a formation of hundreds of smiling uniformed boys with eyes fixed on a lone torch-bearing runner as he approaches the Olympic flame. The scene is typical of many Olympic ceremonies, but these boys are members of the Hitler Youth and this was the 1936 Berlin Summer Games, Hitler's paean to Aryan superiority. Many serious analyses have been published about this key event in Nazi Germany's quest for legitimacy, but this volume, based on a 1996 exhibition at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, is not for scholars but for children 10 years old and up. It should be in every school library.</p>
        <p>In September many children will watch on television the truly remarkable feats taking place in Australia during the 2000 Olympics. They will see athletes of all races, nationalities and creeds competing for medals. Most youngsters don't know that the Games were once held in a nation that prohibited a segment of its population from participating, let alone attending. The history of the Olympics was marred by various tragedies throughout the 20th century, but the 1936 Games were a stage on which sanctioned racism and anti-Semitism were played out for the world to see. Children today who view sports as a kind of melting pot, where excellence transcends prejudice, will be surprised to learn that athletics was (and is) sometimes used as a propaganda weapon.</p>
        <p>In Hitler's Germany sports was a tool in the propagation of Aryan culture, which forbade non-Aryans to take part. ''The Nazi Olympics'' uses sports as a lens to examine the roots of anti-Semitism and the Holocaust. Of course, this is not bedtime reading. Susan D. Bachrach, a historian in the exhibitions division of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, neither sugarcoats nor simplifies the issues that surrounded the Olympics. Instead she gives a detailed, though perfectly accessible, account of what led to Hitler's obsession with the Games and the complicity of other nations in making them a Nazi showcase. It reflects the ''never again'' theme of the Holocaust Memorial itself.</p>
        <p>The book is filled with fascinating and disturbing short items that underscore the ramifications of the event. In one, under a photograph of the Dutch women's gold medal gymnastic team, the caption summarizes the fate of its five Jewish members in the camps: ''All but one woman were killed in the Holocaust,'' it reads. Another lists ''a sample of the actions taken in Germany to bar Jews or 'non-Aryans' from sports clubs and facilities in the three years before the 1936 Olympics.'' Another is about Ruth Langer, 15 years old, the 1936 Austrian champion in the 100- and 400-meter freestyle races; she boycotted the Olympics because of anti-Semitism.</p>
        <p>What makes this book a very useful teaching tool for social studies and history classes is its keen account of the complex politics that infused the Olympics. Since anti-Semitism was at the heart of the Nazi regime, inevitably Jewish participation was an issue at the Games for Germans and non-Germans alike. Controversy pursued the decision by American coaches to bench their only two Jewish runners, claiming they needed the fastest athletes to win the race. One, Sam Stoller, wrote in his diary that it was the ''most humiliating episode'' in his life. Bachrach says that ''some individuals, including Stoller, came to believe'' that anti-Semitism, and the desire of Avery Brundage, the American director of the Olympics organization, ''not to embarrass Hitler by having two Jewish athletes on the winning podium,'' also helped explain the change. It's a passage that will surely pique classroom discussions.</p>
        <p>Paradoxically, the 1936 Olympics marked a triumph for African-American athletes. In addition to winning numerous medals, the track stars Jesse Owens, Mack Robinson (Jackie's brother) and John Woodruff, among others, left Germany with ''good memories of their treatment by the German public and the friendships they developed at the stadium.'' Nonetheless, Bachrach also notes that the reception that African-American athletes received from Nazi officials was chilly. Hitler reportedly refused to shake Owens's hand. And when Olympic protocol officers urged the Fhrer to receive all the medal winners or none, he opted for the latter. Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels decreed that newspapers had to show due respect for African-American athletes as American citizens, but in his private diary after the second day of the Games, he wrote: ''We Germans won a gold medal, the Americans three, of which two were Negroes. That is a disgrace. White people should be ashamed of themselves.''</p>
        <p>''The Nazi Olympics'' is illustrated with a rich collection of rare visual material, including a selection of full-color Nazi posters promoting the Games, and a few foreign ones protesting them. Some of the juxtapositions of images are vivid and telling. A photograph of Sachsenhausen concentration camp, which accepted its first prisoners in the fall of 1936, is on the same spread as a postcard by the British cartoonist David Low, satirizing ''Olympic Courtesy,'' in which Nazis are instructed to be courteous to Jews from June 30 to Sept. 1: ''It is verboten to bump Jews with iron bars without first saying 'excuse me.' ''It is equally ''verboten'' to kick Jewish women in streetcars ''without first rising and offering your seat.''</p>
        <p>As children enjoy the 2000 Olympics, and perhaps learn from the team and individual accomplishments, ''The Nazi Olympics'' offers a chance to address the power of sports as a means to capture the public's hearts and minds. The 1936 Olympic Games were significant though narrowcast, captured in just a few images; today's spectacles are broadcast live to millions of viewers around the world via satellite. Perhaps the first discussion question in class might be this: If Hitler's Games had been seen by such a huge audience, would the Holocaust have still happened?</p>
