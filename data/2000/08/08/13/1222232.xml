        <p>The owner of residential real estate broker Prince &amp; Ripley Inc. of Rye has sold the family business to Bronxville-based Houlihan/Lawrence Inc., in a merger of two of the county's best-known real estate concerns.</p>
        <p>''When you add the experience of our two companies together and you get almost 200 years, that's not bad,'' said George B. Prince Jr., the owner of Prince &amp; Ripley.</p>
        <p>Terms of the acquisition were not disclosed.</p>
        <p>Houlihan/Lawrence had more than $1.7 billion in sales last year while Prince &amp; Ripley, founded in 1915, had about $40 million in sales.</p>
        <p>Both companies have offices in downtown Rye across the street from each other. Prince &amp; Ripley's office is in a 100-year-old farmhouse. The merger forms a company with more than 42 sales associates.</p>
