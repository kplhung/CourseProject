        <p>Colorful Beginnings  The use of caddies can be traced as far back as the 18th century, when golfers would use servants to carry their clubs and find their balls. These first caddies were usually unsavory characters, accepting bribes and stealing the feathery golf balls, which could be worth a week's wages.  One of the most famous caddies was Willie (Trap Door) Johnson, above. He pretended one leg was shorter than the other and, using a special boot with a hollow sole, would hide lost golf balls and later sell them back to his clients. It is said that his boot could hold as many as a dozen golf balls.</p>
        <p>The Bag  In the bag (carried about 5 miles a round), a caddie must include everything he can think of to ensure that he meets his player's every need. Typical items carried during tournament play by Portilla for Len Mattiace.</p>
        <p>A Tournament Week</p>
        <p>MONDAY  Get there early to walk the course and get a yardage book. If there is no book, make your own.</p>
        <p>Prepare as if the tournament starts on Tuesday, identifying problem areas and how to play particular holes.</p>
        <p>TUESDAY  Meet the pro for the practice round.</p>
        <p>WEDNESDAY  If there is a pro-am, entertain the amateurs and have a good time.</p>
        <p>Take another look at the course, because greens and course are now closer to tournament condition.</p>
        <p>If not in pro-am, work out at range. Probably off-site because amateurs and pros are working on their games for the pro-am.  thursday</p>
        <p>Meet an hour before tee time to work on putting and go to the range to loosen up. See how the ball is flying and what kind of swing the golfer brought to the course.</p>
        <p>Tee off and hope to have a good round.</p>
        <p>After the round, hit balls to reinforce what went on at the course.</p>
        <p>FRIDAY</p>
        <p>Same ritual as Thursday.</p>
        <p>SATURDAY</p>
        <p>If the cut is made, follow Thursday's and Friday's ritual. If not, either hang around or pack up and get ready for the next city.</p>
        <p>SUNDAY</p>
        <p>After the tournament, head out to the next city to start the process over again.</p>
        <p>Logging Miles, Pinching Pennies  Caddies work an average of 28 tournaments a year. Last year, Portilla was home a total of six weeks. As shown on the map above, he has been very active, stopping home for a total of three days this year.</p>
        <p>The average caddie makes about $650 a week. In addition, if his pro makes the cut (plays well enough to qualify for the weekend), the caddie can earn up to 10 percent of the pro's earnings. The caddie is responsible for his own expenses, including hotel, food and transportation between tournaments. No health benefits are offered.</p>
        <p>To save money, Portilla has walked 17 miles to the next course and slept in parking lots and gas-station bathrooms. He has gone long stretches eating nothing each day but a can of tuna fish and steamed rice. If his pro misses the cut, he sometimes earns extra money by spotting for TV crews and relaying club selection and yardages to the on-air announcers.</p>
        <p>Helping Out, Tee to Green</p>
        <p>OFF THE TEE  Get to the tee and step off the distance from the markers to that day's tee to identify yardage to hazards or other trouble. Identify wind direction and how it might affect the shot. Agree on the club to be used. After the player executes the shot, walk to the ball and go over the same scenario, but in a different environment.</p>
        <p>THE APPROACH SHOT  Identify the distance and any hazards or trouble there might be. Check wind direction and calculate where to land the ball. Determine if wind, temperature, lie or change in elevation demands more or less club for the shot. Agree on the club.</p>
        <p>ON THE GREEN  Assist in reading the greens and lining up the putts. Some pros, however, want to do it on their own. Clean the ball, then identify tomorrow's pin placement by looking for a dot on the green that indicates the next day's position. Make notations in the yardage book about the new pin and where to put the approach for the best putt at it. Once off the green, the scenario starts over again.</p>
        <p>Portilla On . . .A Caddie's Responsibilities  Typically a caddie's responsibility is to be at the player's beck and call. The ultimate objective is to make it as easy as possible for a player in regards to the game where all he has to do is worry about executing the shot. If you do nothing else, know the yardages, know the golf course, know where you should and should not be on the course. At times a caddie has to be somewhat of a psychologist. If the player hits it in the water, immediately you might have to jump in his face and say: 'Hey, don't worry about it. It's only the second hole. Plenty of golf to play, the lead is not slipping away from us.'</p>
        <p>What Drives a Caddie?  The same thing that drives the players, wanting to succeed. If you get the right guy and you can communicate to that person and motivate and drive that person to success, you will be greatly rewarded. A million dollars will maybe get the player 30th place on the money list. But to a caddie, a million-dollar player is a six-figure income.</p>
        <p>Are Caddies Proficient Golfers?  About half a dozen are excellent golfers, maybe as many as 10. The rest are just average players. But there are guys out here who don't play golf at all. They are just good people as far as motivators and workers who know how to do their jobs. Caddies have always had a knack for scoring. They may not be the best players but they can get the ball in the hole. You'll always hear a player say that's a caddie shot, because we're always in the trees or in the rough. That's the kind of golf we play. We're always in trouble. A 2-iron is probably my best club. I'll hit a 2-iron 50 feet or I'll hit it 220 yards. It's flat, it's long, it fits in a lot of places.</p>
