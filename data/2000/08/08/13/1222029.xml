      <abstract>
        <p>Rita Mattia letter on Lisa Belkin's July 23 article on backlash against children says, as mother of grown man, that she never assumed that anyone should be inconvenienced or burden by her choice to have a child</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Belkin's article was pretty evenhanded, right up to those last three paragraphs when she shrugged her shoulders and said, in effect: Hey, childless ones, whether you like it or not, our kids are your problem.</p>
        <p>I am the mother of a grown man of whom I am proud in every way. But I am prouder still that there was never, ever, a time in his childhood when I believed or assumed that the government, my neighbors, my co-workers or anyone else should be inconvenienced or burdened by what was entirely my choice in bringing him into this world.</p>
