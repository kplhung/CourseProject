        <p>A conference on the possibilities for expanding home ownership in New York City and across the country is scheduled for Sept. 7 at the New York University School of Law.</p>
        <p>Spurred by the strong economy, innovative lending practices and public-private partnerships to create affordable housing, ''home ownership in the United States has reached record levels in recent years,'' said Michael Schill, director of the N.Y.U. law school's Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy.</p>
        <p>''Yet, there remains a large number of Americans who aspire to become home owners,'' Professor Schill said, ''and ownership rates among some racial and minority groups and immigrants are much lower than those of white, native-born households.''</p>
        <p>The conference, sponsored by the N.Y.U. center, the Rutgers University Center for Urban Policy and the Fannie Mae Foundation, will feature panel discussions on reducing the cost of building affordable housing, presentations of case studies of lending strategies by small and large banks, a luncheon and, in the afternoon, a bus tour of housing developments that are sponsored by Asian Americans for Equality, many of them in downtown Manhattan.</p>
        <p>The conference is free and open to the public, but reservations must be made by calling Kenneth Kidd at the N.Y.U. real estate center: (212) 998-6666.</p>
