        <p>TAKEN FOR A RIDE</p>
        <p>How Daimler-Benz</p>
        <p>Drove Off With Chrysler.</p>
        <p>By Bill Vlasic and Bradley A. Stertz.</p>
        <p>Illustrated. 372 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>William Morrow. $26.</p>
        <p>WHEN Daimler-Benz and Chrysler joined together to become DaimlerChrysler in November 1998, the deal was billed as a merger of equals. In less than a year, it was clear Chrysler had become no more than an American subsidiary of Daimler, with German executives firmly in charge of the combined company. Confused and dismayed Chrysler employees soon came up with an explanation: when it came to corporate infighting, their former chairman, Robert J. Eaton, was playing checkers; Daimler's boss, Jrgen Schrempp, was playing chess.</p>
        <p>Bill Vlasic and Bradley A. Stertz don't use that particular analogy. But ''Taken for a Ride'' lays out just how right those Chrysler employees were. Using clear language and a wealth of telling and vivid details, Vlasic and Stertz, both of The Detroit News, describe the descent of one of America's best-known industrial icons to second-class status as little more than a business unit of a foreign multinational. The result is a book in the manner of ''Barbarians at the Gate'' -- a spellbinding tale, juicy gossip and all, of how business is really done among the world's largest companies.</p>
        <p>Eaton, who retired as co-chairman of DaimlerChrysler earlier this year, was long one of Detroit's most enigmatic executives, a seemingly stoic loner with a seldom-disguised disdain for safety and environmental issues. He made a fortune by turning over Chrysler to Daimler-Benz. But ''Taken for a Ride'' portrays him as a complicated though ultimately hapless character motivated by more than just a desire for personal gain. He clearly wrestles with what is best for the company, and is so overcome by emotion on three occasions that he breaks into tears in front of large groups of auto executives.</p>
        <p>Schrempp and Robert Lutz, the former Marine Corps pilot who was Chrysler's vice chairman until the merger, come across as Hollywood caricatures of auto executives. Schrempp crushes corporate rivals in between holding wild parties and cavorting with his aide, notably on one night after bellowing songs with other executives until early in the morning at a business meeting in Seville, Spain: ''Then, with a wild gleam in his eye, he grabbed his ever-present assistant, Lydia Deininger, picked her up and threw her over his shoulder. The room exploded in laughter as Schrempp snatched a bottle of champagne in his free hand, raised it in the air and yelled out with a grin, 'See you later, boys!' ''</p>
        <p>Financial complexities are the bane of books about mergers. Many authors gloss over them, omitting important information in the process. A few plunge so deeply into the minutiae that they discourage practically any reader who is not an investment banker. Vlasic and Stertz accomplish the rare feat of explaining what happened in considerable detail and yet with such clarity that they will not put off even readers who routinely skip their newspapers' business sections. They manage this trick by sticking to plain English, avoiding numbers and jargon almost completely.</p>
        <p>The authors are skeptical about the merger -- a skepticism that has been borne out by events. Promised cost savings have not materialized. Chrysler's profits have fallen, although Daimler's operations prosper. And skilled American executives have fled to other automakers.</p>
        <p>But even good books have at least one shortcoming. This book has two. One problem is that Vlasic and Stertz rely extensively on the reconstruction of meetings, including direct quotations, without identifying their sources or providing footnotes. It should be said, however, that this is an increasingly common practice in books about current events, and Vlasic and Stertz are comparatively restrained in their use of quotations. Their comprehensive description of events and their list of interviews at the end of the book show that they spoke to virtually everyone involved. The only top executive missing is Alexander Trotman, who, as the Ford Motor Company's chairman and chief executive, briefly floated the idea of having Daimler-Benz merge with Ford. When Trotman is introduced in the text, the authors promptly disclose that he declined to speak with them.</p>
        <p>The book's other shortcoming is hard to miss: the opening. Having assembled dozens of illuminating anecdotes, Vlasic and Stertz decided to begin their book with a four-paragraph description of the merger's importance so prosaic as to discourage a bookstore browser. They then plunge immediately into the narrative, beginning three years before the merger took place, when Chrysler was being threatened by a corporate raider. Yet within a couple of pages, the material and the writing become so interesting that it's hard to put the book down.</p>
        <p>''Taken for a Ride,'' full of fresh facts and insights on one of the most heavily covered business stories of the 1990's, provides the first comprehensive look at how DaimlerChrysler came together. It is as fun to read as it is informative about how one of the world's largest companies was formed.</p>
