        <p>Randy Cohen The Ethicist column on whether to report prospective co-op buyer to Internal Revenue Service for deducting entire cost of Ivy League MBA, clear violation of tax laws; on holding optician responsible for cracking eyeglass lens after fixing glass for free; on taking unsold newspaper from newsstand that appeared to be bundled for recycling (M)</p>

        <p>I am a member of my co-op board. A prospective buyer's tax return showed that she had deducted the entire cost of her Ivy League M.B.A., a clear violation of the tax laws. I am appalled by her deceit and wonder if it is a legitimate reason to reject her application. Should I report her to the I.R.S.? -- Anonymous, New York</p>
        <p>You should neither reject her application nor report her to the I.R.S., at least not based on what you've described. You have no idea if her deduction was deceitful or an honest error -- or if indeed it was an error at all. ''If education or training is undertaken to qualify you for a new profession, it is not deductible,'' says Curtis Arluck, a partner in the accounting firm Weikart Associates. ''But if it's further training within your field, it may be deductible.'' Either way, the case should be settled by the I.R.S., not a co-op board. And the I.R.S. has every opportunity to do so if it wishes: the woman declared her tuition on her tax forms, after all.</p>

        <p>I am a member of my co-op board. A prospective buyer's tax return showed that she had deducted the entire cost of her Ivy League M.B.A., a clear violation of the tax laws. I am appalled by her deceit and wonder if it is a legitimate reason to reject her application. Should I report her to the I.R.S.? -- Anonymous, New York</p>
        <p>You should neither reject her application nor report her to the I.R.S., at least not based on what you've described. You have no idea if her deduction was deceitful or an honest error -- or if indeed it was an error at all. ''If education or training is undertaken to qualify you for a new profession, it is not deductible,'' says Curtis Arluck, a partner in the accounting firm Weikart Associates. ''But if it's further training within your field, it may be deductible.'' Either way, the case should be settled by the I.R.S., not a co-op board. And the I.R.S. has every opportunity to do so if it wishes: the woman declared her tuition on her tax forms, after all.</p>
        <p>While you have a legitimate interest in assessing a prospective buyer's financial strength, you should use each applicant's private information for that purpose only, not to snare tax cheats or otherwise clean up Dodge City. Unless you learn that an applicant is engaged in a serious and ongoing crime -- a string of grisly murders, say, or touring with 'N Sync -- then you must respect her privacy.</p>
        <p>When my eyeglasses needed a new screw to hold the lens in place, I went to the village optician. He fixed them and declined my offer to pay. Ten minutes later, I noticed the lenses were cracked. I presume he just made them too tight. I feel he should pay at least part of the replacement cost, but since I did not pay for his services, am I wrong to hold him responsible? -- Peter Rogavin, Westchester, N.Y.</p>
        <p>If the optician broke your glasses, he should replace the lenses. He might argue that his refusal to accept payment transformed your encounter from a commercial transaction to a favor, and you can't hold someone accountable for a favor. He'd be wrong to think so. This was a professional service -- probably rendered with the thought of your repeat business -- and he should stand behind his work. Some opticians who do free repairs post an at-your-own-risk sign, but if that's his policy he should make it clear before starting the job.</p>
        <p>Why not go by the shop and talk to him? However, if he declines to cover your cost, don't be surprised, and if he tries to put you in pink rhinestone harlequin frames, don't be persuaded.</p>
        <p>When newsstands discard unsold papers, they tear off part of the front page for reimbursement, bundle the papers and place them by the garbage, I presume for recycling. One day I undid the bundle and helped myself to a paper. The newsstand attendant told me to put it back. I said it was garbage and that I'd return after he left and take it. Am I wrong? -- N.R., New York</p>
        <p>Yes. No matter how you figure it, you are stealing from someone -- the publisher, the news dealer or the recycler. Further, the continued existence of newspapers, something you seem to value, depends on readers buying a paper. Why not try that?</p>
        <p>Incidentally, all of us who have written for a paper have heard it called ''garbage,'' but it still hurts our feelings.</p>
