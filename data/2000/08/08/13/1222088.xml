        <p>THE tale of George M. Cohan's impact on musical theater is still waiting to be told. And it will go on waiting until real musical theater collaborators can tell it, or more precisely, show it. If you think that will happen, don't bet on it.</p>
        <p>Even musical theater historians do not know just what that impact was. If they do, they do not agree.

        <p>THE tale of George M. Cohan's impact on musical theater is still waiting to be told. And it will go on waiting until real musical theater collaborators can tell it, or more precisely, show it. If you think that will happen, don't bet on it.</p>
        <p>Even musical theater historians do not know just what that impact was. If they do, they do not agree. Here was ''The Man Who Owns Broadway,'' the title of one of his songs and one of his shows (with a verb in the present tense, of course). But he's a mere footnote, if that, in one academic musical theater tome after another.</p>
        <p>Now to George M. Cohan, the man, er, the blowhard. Does anybody care? It's no news that no one wants to know about the mean streak, the obsessive drive and the ultimate unfulfillment of the very famous star who messes up his life.</p>
        <p>Whatever remains, and it is a considerable flag-waving, simplistic song fest, has been done, one dares say as palatably as it can be done, by the makers of ''George M!'', now in a rare revival at Goodspeed Opera House in East Haddam. This is the 1968 musical grab bag with a smidgen of a stock backstage story and a bounty of tunes that sift through a wide, wide range of resistibility, with an epilogue of options, arranged and revised by Mary Cohan, daughter of George M Cohan. It lasted a year on Broadway, hardly a hit but nevertheless a star vehicle for Joel Grey as well as a showcase for Bernadette Peters, a Broadway debutante at age 20, as Josie, George's sister who leaves the family act. True to the way Cohan outlived his stardom -- ''there goes what's his name,'' they say after flashback scenes -- ''George M!'' is one of those forgotten (on purpose) musicals, yet just the sort of good-time show that Goodspeed, like the Goodspeed of old, can still do best. Remember that ''Little Johnny Jones'' itself -- the first hit Cohan wrote, in a few days it appears -- was a Goodspeed success in 1980, but a one-night stand on Broadway two years later.</p>
        <p>No one will argue about the enduring rah-rah appeal of ''Give My Regards to Broadway,'' and particularly ''Over There.'' ''Yankee Doodle Dandy,'' take it or leave it, makes its own singular statement, even in a genre that couldn't be more generic.</p>
        <p>The show can work to the max with a superstar in charge. Goodspeed's George M. (John Scherer) is a likable cad, who would have invented the word chutzpah if he weren't Irish, and who, in any case, was the precursor of Attitude, with a capital A and no modifier. Mr. Scherer is a hoofer, expending effort for the effect of effortlessness. In an otherwise workmanlike cast, Dorothy Stanley is a sparkling veteran as Nellie Cohan, his mother, and Tia Spertos, as Agnes, wife No. 2, is a beauty with brains and talent.</p>
        <p>Very happily indeed, Randy Skinner's choreography and Greg Ganakas' direction, come off as truly collaborative, bringing to stage life the Cohan credo: ''speed, lights, music.'' The continuity of such musical numbers as ''All Aboard for Broadway'' and ''Twentieth Century Love,'' during which years go by in one choreographically sustained interlude, is lovely proof of how musical expertise can sail right over a cursory book, of how musical comedy can develop through music and dance.</p>
        <p>Whenever that book butts in, one hears lines like ''You're usin' up so many people along the way'' (observed by George's father after one too many offers to play Poughkeepsie ''and if you shape up, Troy'') and ''We ate, breathed and lived this business'' (George). The crisis scenes -- Cohan's obstinate refusal to acknowledge the formation of Actors Equity when they're all shouting ''strike! strike!'' and then his all-washed-up blues -- are fudged; important life details are simply passed over. A major long-lasting battle with his producing partner Sam H. Harris is cavalierly disregarded. Finally, Cohan is told off: ''It's 1937, and things have changed,'' a stage manager says.  ''Maybe you shouldn't have come back.''</p>
        <p>But he does. It may be finally, but it is not the finale. The Goodspeed audience can keep clapping along all through the curtain calls.</p>
