        <p>Almost half the money from federal education programs is going to the poorest schools in the country, but those schools continue to lack qualified teachers and technological resources, including computers with Internet access, says a new report from the Department of Education.</p>
        <p>The report, released on Friday, examined six federal programs, including the Title I program that allocates $8 billion each year to try to help disadvantaged children get access to teachers and computers.

        <p>Almost half the money from federal education programs is going to the poorest schools in the country, but those schools continue to lack qualified teachers and technological resources, including computers with Internet access, says a new report from the Department of Education.</p>
        <p>The report, released on Friday, examined six federal programs, including the Title I program that allocates $8 billion each year to try to help disadvantaged children get access to teachers and computers. The report was based on data from the 1997-1998 school year collected in 720 schools in 180 districts.</p>
        <p>The report showed that although secondary schools had a third of the country's more impoverished students, only 15 percent of Title I money went to those schools.</p>
        <p>One of the report's more disturbing findings showed that teachers' aides rather than qualified teachers were teaching many students in Title I schools.</p>
        <p>Although almost all of the teachers' aides in Title I schools had a high school diploma or an equivalent degree, only 19 percent had a bachelor's degree, the report said. That figure dropped to 10 percent in the schools with the highest poverty rates.</p>
        <p>Half of the instructional workers supported by Title I money were teachers' aides. But 41 percent of these aides said that they spent at least half of their time teaching students on their own, without a teacher present.</p>
        <p>The report confirmed the existence of a growing digital divide in the country's classrooms, which keeps students from low-income families from having more access to computers and the Internet.</p>
        <p>While federal money paid for almost a quarter of the computers that schools received in the 1997-1998 school year, ''high-poverty schools had less access to technology than low-poverty schools in terms of the quantity, quality and connectivity of computers,'' the report said.</p>
