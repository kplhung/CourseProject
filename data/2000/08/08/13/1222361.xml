        <p>G. Warren Schloat Jr., a writer and illustrator of children's books who also worked on several of the classic films from the Walt Disney Studios, died on July 30 at a hospital in Escondido, Calif. He was 86 and lived in Rancho Bernardo, Calif.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schloat wrote and illustrated 22 children's books, including ''Andy's Wonderful Telescope,'' ''Fay Gow, a Boy of Hong Kong'' and ''Playtime for You,'' published mostly in the 1950's and 60's by Charles Scribner's Sons and Alfred A. Knopf.</p>
        <p>Nearly two decades earlier, after attending Santa Monica Junior College, he began to work his way up the ranks of the Walt Disney Studios, first as an animator, where his deft hand captured cartoon subjects like Donald Duck and Pluto, and later as a story editor, where he contributed to classics like ''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,'' ''Dumbo'' and ''Pinocchio.''</p>
        <p>At the end of World War II, after a short stint in the Navy during which he made training films, Mr. Schloat moved to New York and took a job as a writer and photographer for Look, where he mastered the magazine's photo-essay format. Working as a writer and director in the early days of television in the 1950's, he devised commercials for Schick razor blades and Gleam toothpaste for the Compton and William Estes agencies. In the 1960's he founded Warren Schloat Productions Inc., an educational publishing company based in New York, which was sold to Prentice Hall in 1970.</p>
        <p>During his retirement, he assisted his sons in the creation of two educational publishing companies, Sunburst Communications Inc., which was sold last year to Houghton Mifflin, and Human Relations Media Inc.</p>
        <p>He is survived by his wife of 63 years, Virginia L. Schloat; two sons, G. Warren III, of Mount Kisco, N.Y., and Anson Wilson, of Bedford, N.Y.; a brother, Don T. Schloat of Valley Center, Calif.; and five grandchildren.</p>
