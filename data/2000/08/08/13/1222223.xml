        <p>LAST week, this column focused on the preliminaries for building a fence. When you have the necessary materials, you can begin construction.</p>
        <p>The first step is to set the posts in the ground. Begin with the end posts. Fence posts should be set to a depth of at least 32 inches. They can be held in place with either packed dirt or concrete.</p>
        <p>You can use a clamshell-type posthole digger if you only have a few holes to dig, but for a long fence you might want to rent a power auger to bore holes. (For more information on the tools and techniques of hole digging, see the Home Clinic, March 26, 2000.) The holes should have flat solid bottoms.</p>
        <p>Two problems that you may encounter are rocks and tree roots.</p>
        <p>Try to dislodge rocks with a pry bar and a pick. If the rock is too large to be moved, you may have to relocate the fence post.</p>
        <p>Tree roots are less of a problem because you can cut the smaller ones and shift the hole slightly to avoid the larger ones.</p>
        <p>Place each end post in its hole and fill it with about six to eight inches of soil. Use a level to make sure the post is perfectly vertical on all four sides, then tamp the dirt down around the post with a piece of 2 by 2. Start gently on one side, and then work around the post with more forceful strokes. Be careful not to tamp too hard on any one side; you could push the post out of plumb.</p>
        <p>When the end posts are in place, run a line between them and locate the positions for the section posts. Dig the holes, then set the posts in them, using the same tamping technique that you applied to the end posts.</p>
        <p>After setting all the posts, step back and check their alignment. Are they all in line? Are the tops even? Are they all straight? If not, now is the time to make corrections.</p>
        <p>If you are satisfied with the posts, you can fill the holes with either dirt or concrete. Whether you use dirt or concrete, it is important to shape the top of the fill so it slopes away from the post. This raked profile will shed water that might otherwise collect around the post and penetrate the wood, causing rot.</p>
        <p>The next step is to nail the stringers in place with 10-penny galvanized nails. The stringers are the long boards that run horizontally between the posts to provide a support for the pickets.</p>
        <p>They will have to be toenailed, that is, drive the nails at an angle through the top of the stringer into the vertical side of the post. Toenailing horizontal members like stringers presents a problem because the downward force of the hammer blows tends to knock the pieces out of alignment.</p>
        <p>There are two ways to prevent this. You can enlist the aid of a strong-armed helper to hold each stringer as you nail it in place, or if you are working alone, you can use spacer blocks to support the stringers as you toenail. Start with the bottom stringer first. It should be about 13 inches from the ground. Cut two pieces of 1 by 6 13 inches long and place them at the base of each post. Place the bottom stringer so each end rests on a spacer block, then nail it to the post.</p>
        <p>The top stringer should be about 38 inches above the bottom one. Cut two more spacer blocks 38 inches long and place them at posts so they rest on the bottom stringers. Place the top stringer on these blocks and nail it in place. You can remove the support blocks once both stringers are nailed in place.</p>
        <p>The final step in constructing the fence is to nail the pickets to the stringers.</p>
        <p>The hardest part is positioning the pickets so they align horizontally and so they are spaced evenly apart. This task can be made easier if you make a spacing jig out of scrap lumber.</p>
        <p>The jig consists of only four boards (see the accompanying illustration) and is relatively easy to nail together. However, the pieces must be accurately measured and assembled or else all the pickets will be out of alignment.</p>
        <p>Place the jig on the top stringer, then fit the picket in place in the vertical slot with the top of the picket nestled against the horizontal guide on the jig.</p>
        <p>Face nail the picket to the top stringer with two 7-penny galvanized nails. Use two more nails to secure the bottom of the picket to the lower stringer. Pick the jig up and move it along the stringer to the next position and nail the rest of the pickets.</p>
