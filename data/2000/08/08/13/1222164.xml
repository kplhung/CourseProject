        <p>The waterfront of this small town with the big view has been a scene of bitter contention since Aaron Burr mortally wounded Alexander Hamilton in their famous duel of 1804.</p>
        <p>But at least their behavior was civilized.</p>
        <p>There is a new standoff here, with some residents opposed to a proposed development that could alter the character of this township of 12,000 people and change the face of the place as seen from the Circle Line and Manhattan's West Side.</p>
        <p>Arthur E. Imperatore, an executive of Romulus Development Corporation of North Bergen and president of New York Waterway and his partners in the project, the Roseland Property Company, are seeking the approval of the township planning board to erect what amounts to a small city at the base of the Palisades to be called Port Imperial South, after the existing Port Imperial marina, ferry and restaurant complex.</p>
        <p>Under the plan, a total of 1,632 apartments, town houses and condominiums, 1.3 million square feet of office space and another 300,000 square feet of retail space would go up, as well as a hotel, a retirement home and a ferry terminal near a stop on a future stretch of the Hudson-Bergen Light Rail line. In addition to 6,405 parking spaces, Port Imperial South would feature bike paths and a state-mandated waterfront walkway to run the length of the project.</p>
        <p>As currently envisioned, the tallest of the buildings would be 133 feet high, or 12 floors. Part of the Hudson River would be partly obscured as viewed from Hamilton Park, a sliver of green atop the Palisades named for the loser of that famous duel.</p>
        <p>A vote on the plan, which has been the subject of 24 planning board meetings since  October, has not been scheduled. The proposal has been criticized and its approval delayed through the efforts of a group called Friends of the Weehawken Waterfront.</p>
        <p>In the opinion of the Friends, Weehawken's view is its defining characteristic. In an earlier dispute, the group opposed a plan by Hartz Mountain Industries to build two office towers at its Lincoln Harbor complex,  south of the Port Imperial South site, that would have obscured the view of Manhattan for motorists on the ramp that spirals down to the Lincoln Tunnel.</p>
        <p>In January, after a decade of litigation -- largely between Hartz and the state Department of Environmental Protection, which had asserted its authority over waterfront projects -- Hartz and the state agreed on changes that would preserve the view.</p>
        <p>Still, local opposition to the Hartz proposal was hardly unanimous. It had been approved by the Weehawken Planning Board before the state blocked it, and it promised to generate thousands of jobs, not to mention property-tax ratables without the threat of a costly new burden to the school system. And many residents, including Mayor Richard Turner, felt little sympathy for the aesthetic pleasure of out-of-town motorists who contribute nothing to Weehawken but smog.</p>
        <p>In the latest instance, Port Imperial South promises to augment township tax coffers (although the effect on local schools, with its 1,600 potential new families, seems unlikely to be as benign), and presumably contractors and other local businesses would profit from the project's construction and its subsequent inhabitants.</p>
        <p>Some supporters of Port Imperial South have expressed concern that Weehawken might miss out on the waterfront boom that has rained development dollars on Jersey City, Hoboken, West New York and other communities. Moreover, there is a perception among many blue-collar residents here that the Friends of the Weehawken Waterfront are simply liberal newcomers who think they can dictate what is best.</p>
        <p>''I know these people well,'' said Jerry Nicol, 40, a lifetime resident, who addressed the planning board and about 300 residents during a recent hearing at Weehawken High School. ''I went to graduate school with them. I drank cafe lattes with them. Every time I hear their diatribes and their rhetoric I think of Hillary Rodham Clinton, that other carpetbagger from New York.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Nicol's remarks drew the applause from much of the crowd -- including township employees. ''As soon as their children reach school age,'' he said, ''they'll pack up their Volvos and head out on Route 80. They're not the Friends of the Weehawken waterfront, they're the hypocrites of the Weehawken waterfront.''</p>
        <p>Another longtime resident, William Applegate, 41, a paramedic and a former exalted ruler of Weehawken Elks Lodge 1456, was just as emotional in expressing his support for the project. ''If I believed that this would hurt my beloved Weehawken, I would be against it,'' Mr. Applegate said. ''Our lodge is known as the lodge with the million-dollar view. This proposal will do nothing but benefit this town.''</p>
        <p>Despite the raised voices and stinging oratory, local officials insisted at the meeting that it would be unfair to characterize Weehawken as a community sharply divided over Port Imperial South, and the Friends insisted their intent was not to block the project, but to preserve the view of the river and ensure open access to it.</p>
        <p>Earlier in the evening, Gail Humphrey, a township resident and principal spokeswoman for the Friends of the Weehawken Waterfront, ran down a litany of concerns,  from building heights to what she said was the state's lax standard for capping contaminated ground with 18 inches of topsoil.</p>
        <p>''We oppose and reject the Port Imperial South application,'' Ms. Humphrey said. In an interview later, Ms. Humphrey said some of the remarks directed at her group were off base ''Carpetbaggers?'' she said. ''What do they mean by that?''</p>
        <p>Ms. Humphrey said she and her husband, Eric Conger, both actors and voice-over artists, bought a house in Weehawken seven years ago, and have had two children there.  ''I would not be doing this if I didn't feel so strongly about the town,'' she said. ''I plan on being here a long time.''</p>
        <p>Interestingly, a large number of the people Mr. Nicol spoke for in supporting the project are residents who are most likely to have less of a stake in the township than Ms. Humphrey and her family. Indeed, many of the residents of Port Imperial South will be renters, who historically take a less active role in the community than homeowners.</p>
        <p>The township's planning consultant, Jill Hartman, said there were elements of the 40-acre project -- including a waterfront walkway -- to ensure that all Weehawken residents would feel free to go down to the river. But Ms. Hartman acknowledged that there was little officials could do to ensure that the new residents would make their way inland.</p>
        <p>Prof. Jill Lewis, chairman of the Center for Public Policy and Urban Research at New Jersey City University, said it generally took several years for residents of such developments to weave themselves into the fabric of the community, achieved principally through their children's enrollment in school. Otherwise, Professor Lewis said, there is ''the possibility of further divisiveness, erosion of community.''</p>
        <p>At the high school, 51-year-old Ed Flood, a  township fire official, took no side in the debate, but spoke in favor of the application process itself.</p>
        <p>''There is absolutely nothing wrong with the Friends of the Weehawken Waterfront asking these questions,'' said Mr. Flood, a 27-year resident here, ''and it is the responsibility of the planning board to listen. I'm glad it's protracted, and I hope it goes on until we get the best project we can have.''</p>
