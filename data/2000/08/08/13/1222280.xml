        <p>ARE you a poor fool who mows the lawn on a hill so steep you have to pull the mower back up on a rope? And then your back goes out and you have to be hauled off on a stretcher?</p>
        <p>That hill needs a ground cover.</p>
        <p>The same applies if you are bashing into your trees with that mower. Stop, unless you want to kill them. Plant a ground cover from the tree's trunk clear to its drip line. Or even farther, if you would like a sustainable, low-maintenance landscape.</p>
        <p>''I'm going to tell you a lot of horticultural heresy,'' Jim Glover said, brandishing a pot of golden creeping Jenny (Lysimachia nummularia Aurea), a sun lover that can form a carpet of little round, golden leaves in areas too wet for a lawn. ''Rip up your lawns! Forget about flowers! You can get as big a bang for your buck with foliage -- for nine months of the year.''</p>
        <p>I've been happily brainwashed by Mr. Glover and his brother, Rob, who started Glover Perennial Growers three years ago out in Mattituck, N.Y., where you can still sniff the salt breezes over the potato fields. Rob runs the business end of things, and Jim heads the propagation in 32 greenhouses.</p>
        <p>Their three-year-old wholesale business is thriving because a plant-hungry public wants new perennials and alternatives to grass. Not only is grass often unsuited to wet or shady areas, but it needs to be doused with chemicals to stay lush and green, unlike many ground covers.</p>
        <p>''In the 80's, you had to push new stuff,'' Jim Glover said. ''Now, people say: 'New? Oh, give me new!' ''</p>
        <p>Some are new cultivars of old favorites like Ajuga, or bugleweed, which is usually associated with spoon-shaped purplish leaves and little blue flowers that bloom from May through June. But now, even the classic types of Ajuga have interesting variations: Gaiety's purple leaves are highly glossed and crinkled; Jungle Beauty has highly textured, mahogany-purple leaves, and its blue flowers are 10 inches tall; Chocolate Chip has cute, smaller leaves that form a dense cover; and there's a real oddball named Mini Crispa Red, which has crispy wrinkled bronze leaves that curl inward to form little buns. It's not a spreader, like some Ajugas, and rock gardeners can't get enough of this weirdo.</p>
        <p>Mr. Glover also grows unusual perennials like golden box-leaf honeysuckle (Lonicera nitida Baggesen's Gold), a shrubby spreading evergreen that grows to three feet, with tiny, brilliant yellow, fern-shaped leaves. Its foliage turns red in winter, but it doesn't like full sun, so Mr. Glover suggests using it to highlight a bed of purple-leaf Ajuga.</p>
        <p>The Glovers' greenhouses look like quilts of many colors and textures: burgundy, chartreuse, blue green, grass green, tawny and gold; soft mats of tiny rounded leaves, leathery, crinkled ones, billowy grasses that wave in the breeze.</p>
        <p>Which leads me to the versatile Carex family, with roughly 2,000 species of sedge. Somewhere in that range is a plant that can tolerate almost any condition. Ice Dance, for instance, which has leathery 12-inch green leaves with creamy white margins, loves the sun and forms such a dense cover you'll never see a weed. The Beatles is a green mop top that loves wet conditions. So does Bowles Golden, a large clump-forming sedge that grows 18-to-30 inches tall; its glowing yellow foliage lights up dark spaces, and it's perfect for the mucky edge of a pond. Carex flacca, an intensely blue sedge that grows 6 to 12 inches tall, tolerates salt and drought.</p>
        <p>Mr. Glover also recommends an unusual Japanese forest grass (Hakoneckloa macra Aureola), with bamboo-like weeping foliage. The leaves are yellow with a green stripe and turn intense pink-red in the fall, lighting up the area beneath a tree.</p>
        <p>Some ground covers are being rediscovered, like lily of the valley and Kenilworth ivy (Cymbalaria muralis), a Victorian creeper with tiny lavender viola-like flowers that loves to grow on shady stone walls.</p>
        <p>I'm a sucker for creepers that grow in and around stepping stones and in the cracks of old brick terraces, and Mr. Glover is experimenting with a number of marginally hardy types like Cotula squalida Platts Black, or New Zealand Brass Buttons, which has soft deeply dissected black leaves with a touch of green. It has little yellow buttonlike flowers in summer and tolerates light foot traffic. If you live in Zone 7 (zero degrees) or higher, try it among your stepping stones.</p>
        <p>Mazus reptans is another good one for the walkway, especially if the soil is moist. It forms a two-inch carpet of bright green with little blue or white flowers, and it's tough enough to thrive under the weight of Morgan, the Glovers' hefty Labrador, who likes to nap on its cool cushion. Another stepping-stone cover that takes light foot traffic is dwarf shamrock, Oxalis magellanica Nelson, which has little white double flowers.</p>
        <p>West Coast strawberries are taking hold on the East Coast, because they thrive in sandy soil and form a dense cover that prevents erosion. The red stems are beautiful, but the berries are kind of dry, so if you want to graze on your ground cover, grow an old favorite like Fort Laramie, Ozark Beauty or Quinault.</p>
        <p>There's also an evergreen creeping raspberry called Rubus calycinoides, with tough leaves that turn red in the fall and winter. It bears orange raspberries, full size and sweet, in midsummer.</p>
        <p>Since Glover Perennials is a wholesaler, you can't drive up its sandy lane to buy plants, but they are sold in fine garden centers in New York and Connecticut. Many other growers are propagating these same varieties, so ask for them at your local nursery.</p>
