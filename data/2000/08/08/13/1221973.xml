        <p>LOOKING FOR MARY</p>
        <p>Or, The Blessed Mother and Me.</p>
        <p>By Beverly Donofrio.</p>
        <p>246 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Viking Compass. $23.95.</p>
        <p>THERE'S something about Marys. Annes and Janes have their own formidable histories, but -- with no disrespect to St. Anne and Anne Boleyn, or Jane Fonda and Plain Jane Austen -- can they compete with a lineup of Magdalene, Shelley and Tyler Moore? Yet even those three irresistibles have to take a back seat to Mary the Mother of God (or, if you prefer, Jesus), the Co-Redemptrix, as some Roman Catholics would have it, greater than all the angels and all the saints.</p>
        <p>Beverly Donofrio goes a step farther. She has little use for Christ -- I don't even like him. He's a whiner'' -- but she adores the Blessed Mother. This wasn't always so. For much of her life, she found Mary to be ''too removed and sterile, too far away up in the virginal Catholic clouds.'' In her 40's, though, she bought a framed postcard of Our Lady of Fatima, then some yard-sale paintings of Mary, and before she knew it the Virgin was multiplying all over her house ''like Richard Dreyfuss's little mud mountains in 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind.' ''Soon a fondness for kitsch would lead to actual devotion: ''I'd made a shrine of my house, and knowing a good opportunity when she sees one, the Blessed Mother came in.''</p>
        <p>Which should come as no surprise. Early in ''Looking for Mary: Or, The Blessed Mother and Me,'' a semi-spiritual quasi memoir, Donofrio bestows on herself the title ''Lapsed Catholic,'' a term that always seems to imply an inevitable return to the faith. In her case, however, it's not clear what kind of Catholic she used to be. She lived through the bad old days, when men were men and nuns were nuts (''I hate God! I grew up Catholic''), so anyone who's ever had the stuffing knocked out of him by a Sister of Charity can empathize. But she admits to having thought that Our Lady of Guadalupe was a Mexican saint, until a trip south of the border set her straight. She is puzzled by the phrase ''Offer it up'' (''What does that mean?''), as in ''Offer up your suffering for the souls in purgatory.'' And toward the end of the book she refers to ''God and Jesus, who, as far as I understood it, were one and the same -- and so was the Holy Spirit. It's all so confusing.''</p>
        <p>Donofrio, the author of ''Riding in Cars With Boys,'' made an NPR documentary a few years back about Marian apparition sites in the United States, and the bulk of this new book consists of her reporting from Medjugorje, the Bosnian village where Mary is said to appear regularly. (The church is agnostic on this issue.) ''On a silent fasting retreat with 49 zealous Catholics,'' Donofrio thinks some of them are too zealous: ''I do not want to be a crazy, sign-seeing, rose-smelling, rigid, right-to-life Catholic.'' Nevertheless, in Medjugorje she makes her first confession in 35 years, owning up to a long-ago abortion, and is obviously caught up in the apparitional excitement. After receiving holy communion, also for the first time in 35 years, she notices that her statue of a weeping Virgin has been transformed: ''The tear and its shiny track have disappeared from Mary's face.''</p>
        <p>Back in the States, Donofrio, with Our Lady's help, learns to love Jesus and to be a better mother to her own son, who seems to have endured some truly hurtful behavior. The flashbacks involving him are often moving, and his mother is, at times, capable of rigorous self-criticism (''My own needs had always been more important than my son's''; ''I was no theologian''). Finally, she moves to Mexico to escape ''the patriarchal American church.''</p>
        <p>''Looking for Mary'' is strange, but not without a kooky charm. Believers may be baffled by its placement of the Madonna on the Trinity's already crowded throne. Nonbelievers will be baffled, period. Maybe the in-betweens, those of you who don't know what you believe, will profit from reading the Book of Beverly. If not, offer it up.</p>
