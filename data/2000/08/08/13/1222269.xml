        <p>FOR Ravi Nathan, the weather is not kindling for small talk. Sunshine does not necessarily lift his spirits, nor does rain always sour his mood.</p>
        <p>As the portfolio manager of weather derivatives at Aquila Energy, Mr. Nathan is more concerned about how heat waves lingering over California, hurricanes gathering in the Gulf of Mexico and cold fronts drifting into the Northeast will affect his clients, companies whose businesses are vulnerable to the vicissitudes of the seasons.</p>
        <p>This summer has been especially unruly, with droughts and high heat in parts of the South and West, but rain and relatively cool weather (so far) in the Northeast.</p>
        <p>On a hot day in Kansas City, Mo., where Aquila -- a unit of Utilicorp United, an energy company and utility -- is based, Mr. Nathan talked of his complicated relationship with the shifting skies. Following are excerpts from the conversation.</p>
        <p>NEELA BANERJEE</p>
        <p>Q. What does it mean to hedge against the weather?</p>
        <p>A. We use various weather measures, such as temperature and precipitation, to come up with various averages for a city, a region. And we can create an index from those averages that we base our contracts on.</p>
        <p>So for example, if you see from the index that there will be several days over 100 degrees in New York this summer, then you enter into a contract that says, for every degree over 100, you get $10,000. But for that protection, you pay a premium ahead of time.</p>
        <p>Q. Who are most of your clients?</p>
        <p>A. Technically, any business impacted by the weather is a candidate. But mainly it's energy companies, utilities.</p>
        <p>But we also get soft-drink companies, too. Beverage companies hedge by setting up contracts in case there aren't enough hot days. If the temperature gets above 90, people drink more soda. The contract will be set up, say you have 50 days in the summer under 90 degrees, and for each day you get paid depending on how much in prospective sales you lose.</p>
        <p>The average risk exposure on the contracts is about $2 million. But the biggest single contract I've had is $10 million.</p>
        <p>Q. So how are your clients faring? Did they guess right about the weather this summer?</p>
        <p>A. The weather market in California originally thought summer would be cool there, because the last three summers have been cool and power prices didn't do much, and they expected it to be the same. But weather being weather, it will surprise you.</p>
        <p>They don't know the meteorological pattern that's caused it, but a ridge of heat has stayed over the whole West for most of July, which is strange because weather usually moves around and lets a region cool off.</p>
        <p>But utilities also hedge against cool summers, against people not turning on their air-conditioners, if you want to put it simply.</p>
        <p>Q. Has the summer's unexpected weather -- the lasting heat and droughts in the West, the cool, rainy weather in the Northeast -- been good or bad for business? And do you react to the weather differently from other people?</p>
        <p>A. What's good for business is when risks go up. When there's so much volatility, the prospects for making money are good. At the same time, it is so important for me to balance my exposure out -- all over the country, all over the world.</p>
        <p>This summer in America has been absolutely good for business. We're doing quite well.</p>
        <p>But it's bad being a weather trader, because I just can't enjoy the weather. You walk out of the house and you think the weather will be a kiss on the cheek, but it ends up being a punch in the nose. I'll go to New York, say, and I may have a contract there, and if the weather isn't going the way we planned, I think, ''Oh, God, I'm losing money.''</p>
        <p>Q. Can individuals use weather derivatives, to, say, hedge their barbecues?</p>
        <p>A. We're prevented by our regulators from dealing with mom and pop. If people want to bet on the weather, maybe they should try Vegas.</p>
