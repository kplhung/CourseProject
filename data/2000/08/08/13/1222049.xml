        <p>DANCE is getting itself happily mixed up. Some choreographers are having a ball with rock 'n' roll and all that jazz. Others are uniting seemingly disparate music and dance styles. The results can be artistically provocative, the best of such productions making theatergoers gaze in wonder at both dance and the world from which it comes.</p>
        <p>Take two refreshing productions at this summer's American Dance Festival in Durham, N.C. Mark Dendy's new work was performed to a potpourri of rock and pop music of the recent past. Although the choreography reflected the musical moods, it seldom resembled anything you'd see on MTV.</p>
        <p>The piece was easy to enjoy simply as a modern-dance energy study. But Mr. Dendy called it ''I'm Going to My Room to Be Cool Now, and I Don't Want to Be Disturbed.'' That title made it possible to interpret the sometimes feverish action as the daydreams -- especially the erotic ones -- of an adolescent, confused by his strong but inchoate urges and unsure of his sexual orientation, who has locked himself in his bedroom to listen to favorite records.</p>
        <p>Trisha Brown presented the complete version of ''The Trilogy,'' excerpts from which had been seen previously in New York. In some episodes of this full-evening jazz piece, she appeared to be inventing her own eccentric form of jitterbugging. The choreography certainly did swing. But most of the production, with its sudden juxtapositions of rigorous order and wiggling, was as idiosyncratic as its complex score by Dave Douglas. Some theatergoers even wondered if the music was jazz at all, just as they did when they heard Donald Knaack's score for another festival premiere, Twyla Tharp's ''Surfer at the Styx,'' which, like Ms. Brown's creation, was made possible through the Doris Duke Millennium Awards for Modern Dance and Jazz Music Collaborations.</p>
        <p>When the question ''Is this jazz?'' was raised during a festival symposium with Ms. Brown and Mr. Douglas, the composer replied that he comes from a jazz background, considers his close collaboration with Ms. Brown as an extension of his tradition and expressed an interest in the way art forms can redefine themselves.</p>
        <p>Art keeps leaping over formal boundaries. So maybe the time has now come for the Lindy Hop version of Stravinsky's ''Sacre du Printemps.''</p>
        <p>The possibility of such a thing was suggested back in 1930 in Carl Van Vechten's ''Parties,'' an incisive satirical novel about Prohibition-era New York. During his long life (1880-1964), Van Vechten was not only a fiction writer with a wicked tongue but also an erudite music and dance critic whose interests extended from the newest ballets and modern-dance experiments to the latest Harlem dance styles. In ''Parties,'' recently reissued by the Sun and Moon Press of Los Angeles, Van Vechten noted that because the strenuous social dance known as the Lindy Hop involved an ''ecstatic flinging about of arms and legs, and contortions of the torso,'' it could produce an effect approaching ''the sensations of religious ecstasy.''</p>
        <p>''It could be danced, quite reasonably and without alteration of tempo to many passages in the 'Sacre du Printemps,' '' Van Vechten wrote. His suggestion, though undeniably odd, is not totally freakish; Stravinsky's work, after all,  does depict states of spiritual possession.</p>
        <p>As ease of travel and speed of communication make it easy to become acquainted with the world's cultures, inquisitive, internationally minded choreographers are combining  styles and techniques, just as imaginative chefs blend elements of several cuisines to create their own distinctive recipes.</p>
        <p>In recent years, many Japanese dancers have flocked to Spanish flamenco classes. The schedule for this year's Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival in Becket, Mass., included Compagnie Jant-Bi, a Senegalese company, in ''Le Coq Est Mort,'' which was created for it by the German Neo-Expressionist choreographer Susanne Linke. In her ''Pour Antigone,'' shown last month at Lincoln Center Festival 2000, the French choreographer Mathilde Monnier retold a Greek tragedy in African terms with a cast of both African and European dancers. The mixing and matching of dancers and styles can have fascinating results.</p>
        <p>Of course, however they may be modified in specific productions, traditional dance techniques should also be preserved in their purity in honor of a culture's heritage. The dance world needs the old as well as the new. And it is easy for new choreographic composites to be merely messy.</p>
        <p>But at their best, stylistic potpourris can be entertaining and aesthetically challenging. When Donald Byrd/The Group appeared at the Joyce Theater last season, the company offered Mr. Byrd's ''In a Different Light: Duke Ellington,'' a tribute affirming the remarkable range of this great jazz composer. Some scenes were lyrical. Yet one episode was a sexy -- indeed, raunchy -- comic romp in what might have been a nightclub or brothel. At still other times, Mr. Byrd's choreography was as cool and precisely patterned as certain balletic abstractions by George Balanchine. All these episodes were choreographically convincing responses to Ellington's music, which, as Mr. Byrd's title suggested, can be interpreted in many different artistic lights.</p>
        <p>When the Australian Ballet performed at City Center last fall, its most unusual offering was Stephen Page's ''Rites,'' to Stravinsky's ''Sacre du Printemps.'' For this production, the ballet dancers were joined by members of the Bangarra Dance Theater, an Australian aboriginal company. Mr. Page turned Stravinsky's ballet, which originally depicted human sacrifice in prehistoric Russia, into an aboriginal ritual honoring earth, wind, fire and water. The concept was original and the hybrid choreography convincing.</p>
        <p>So how about it? Is anyone inspired to try that Lindy Hop ''Sacre''?</p>
