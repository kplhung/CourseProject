        <p>It is easily the wittiest candidate commercial of the 2000 election. In a parody of MasterCard's ''priceless'' television campaign, Ralph Nader's first spot takes aim at the ways the major-party candidates finance their runs for the presidency.</p>
        <p>''Grilled tenderloin for fund-raiser: $1,000 a plate,'' the announcer says. ''Campaign ads filled with half-truths: $10 million dollars. Promises to special interest groups: over $10 billion dollars. Finding out the truth: priceless.''</p>

        <p>It is easily the wittiest candidate commercial of the 2000 election. In a parody of MasterCard's ''priceless'' television campaign, Ralph Nader's first spot takes aim at the ways the major-party candidates finance their runs for the presidency.</p>
        <p>''Grilled tenderloin for fund-raiser: $1,000 a plate,'' the announcer says. ''Campaign ads filled with half-truths: $10 million dollars. Promises to special interest groups: over $10 billion dollars. Finding out the truth: priceless.''</p>
        <p>That last line is narrated over a photograph of Mr. Nader as a young consumer advocate. But the commercial overlooks Mr. Nader's latest public role: professional thorn in Vice President Al Gore's side.</p>
        <p>The Green Party standard-bearer, who polls show is likely to siphon off some liberal Gore supporters, was not the only third-party candidate muscling his way onto television last week: the Reform Party, meeting to pick its candidate in Long Beach, Calif., broke into rival conventions.</p>
        <p>The struggle was between the conservative commentator Patrick J. Buchanan, representing a new guard in the party formed by Ross Perot in 1992, and a faction of party veterans that was backing John Hagelin, a physicist who has run for president twice on the Natural Law Party ticket. ''We are going to reach back to the 20 million people who voted for Ross Perot in 1992, the people who are not looking for a right-wing extremist,'' Mr. Hagelin said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Buchanan seemed to be practicing his own politics of inclusiveness on Friday, when he selected as his running mate a black educator from Los Angeles, Ezola Foster. ''We welcome everybody,'' he said.</p>
        <p>There were other distractions for the Gore campaign. In South Barrington, Ill., President Clinton faced 4,000 members of the Willow Creek Community Church on Thursday to speak about his life after an adulterous affair and the effect that event should not have on the man he wants to succeed him.</p>
        <p>''He doesn't get enough credit for what we did together that is good, and surely, no fair-minded person would blame him for any mistake that I made,'' the president said.</p>
