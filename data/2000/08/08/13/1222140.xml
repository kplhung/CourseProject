        <p>DEAR DIARY:</p>
        <p>At the Fair Haven Post Office one recent day, I happened to be behind a middle-aged woman who proceeded to ask the person behind the counter for some stamps. The clerk handed her six big, garish stamps, commemorating some disease</p>
        <p>''Don't you have anything prettier?'' the woman asked.</p>
        <p>The clerk then handed her six Daffy Duck stamps. The woman put them on her letters, slid them into the mail slot, and left.</p>
        <p>Jim Dooling</p>
        <p>Overheard on the express bus to New York City the other day:</p>
        <p>First Lady: ''I'm expecting my new computer to be delivered next Monday but I won't be home. I asked my son to come over, but the trouble is that the first thing he does when he comes over is to fall asleep.''</p>
        <p>Second Lady: ''I have a simple solution for you. Put a sign on the front door saying, 'MAN SLEEPING. BANG HARD.' ''</p>
        <p>Patricia Panson</p>
        <p>A sign has been up in Mahwah on Wyckoff Avenue -- leading to the Wyckoff ''boarder'' -- which I assume is a lodger with whom the residents of Mahwah are not permitted to fraternize.</p>
        <p>Carl Sparacio</p>
        <p>SHOWERS, COAST-TO-COAST</p>
        <p>We've never seen</p>
        <p>The lawn so green,</p>
        <p>Praise be! And yet we're mirthless</p>
        <p>Because what made</p>
        <p>The grass this shade</p>
        <p>Made our vacation worthless!</p>
        <p>Maureen Cannon</p>
        <p>While having lunch at the Millburn Diner recently, my friend confided to me: ''Summer's almost over, and I can't wait until the kids are back from camp. But if you think the transition is going to be easy, think again.''</p>
        <p>Then she begin to tell me about a telephone conversation she'd had with her daughter the previous night.</p>
        <p>Mother: ''As soon as you get home, we're going shopping for school clothes.''</p>
        <p>Daughter: ''Cool . . . Gee, I hope I get a nice counselor this year.''</p>
        <p>Mother: ''Teacher, dear, not counselor.''</p>
        <p>Daughter: ''Whatever, I just hope I like my bunk.''</p>
        <p>Marilyn Cohen Vasen</p>
        <p>As I sat watching a Mets-Cardinals game, my 30-month-old granddaughter, Elizabeth, climbed on my lap and began to drink her bottle. Intending to please her, I clicked on the cartoon channel.</p>
        <p>But with the bottle's nipple clenched between her teeth, Elizabeth turned to me and exclaimed, ''Hey, pop-pop, I want to watch the ball game.''</p>

        <p>THE WAGES OF SIN</p>
        <p>Hot fudge sundae Monday night</p>
        <p>Tuesday will be cellulite</p>
        <p>Barbara Alpren</p>
        <p>Another bus, another cell phone.</p>
        <p>But the cell phone guy would rather his friends and business associates not know about the bus part. This fellow, on the 33 to Montclair one evening began each loud conversation with ''I'm on the train . . . ''</p>
        <p>Carl Sommers</p>
        <p>I thought you might enjoy the enclosed. It appeared inb a local newspaper:</p>
        <p>''Hosiery does not bother me. I don't usually go bare because my shoes do not feel comfortable unless I have them on.''</p>
        <p>Maribeu Glasscock  (No comment.)</p>
        <p>WET AND WETTER</p>
        <p>You ask me, love, to pray for sun.</p>
        <p>I will do.</p>
        <p>Without it, love, I have begun</p>
        <p>To Mildew.</p>
