        <p>ONE of the biggest fig leaves of all times has  been removed. And what can at last be seen by everyone, after centuries of censorship, is a remarkable collection of erotic antiquities in the National Archaeological Museum of Naples.</p>
        <p>In the 19th century, the small collection housed in these rooms bore the name ''cabinet of obscene objects.'' Material of this sort has been on or off limits depending on the tenor of the era. What the Romans celebrated, the Middle Ages forbade. In turning to ancient civilization, the Renaissance exulted its licentious sides as well as its forms. Then the Counter Reformation closed the door. In the 18th century, the Enlightenment was true to its name, yet we all know the meaning of the label Victorian for what followed. Whatever terms like the Sexual Revolution suggest, only now has public entry been permitted again. It is a breakthrough in our access to cultural history.</p>
        <p>To see these works you must first pass iron gates under the words Gabinetto Segreto -- Secret Cabinet. The introduction gives you the distinct sense that the prison doors have been opened, that you are entering forbidden territory. Rather than minimize that feeling, the museum's slightly overdone presentation emphasizes the naughtiness.</p>
        <p>The fuss seems unnecessary. Few of the Pompeiian frescoes and Roman bronzes and marble sculptures within fit under the rubric of pornography. Many are art objects of the highest quality that celebrate the forces of life in the manner of Homer and Ovid. While some were meant to be overtly sexual, others functioned more as fertility symbols -- of the sort that existed in any number of ancient civilizations on every continent. Obscenity is in the eyes of the beholder.</p>
        <p>The exhibition opens with the few pre-Roman objects in the collection. A black-figure Greek vase is as unusual for its graphic style as for its subject matter. It depicts two nude male athletes, one penetrating the other from behind, in a sketchy and naive style more typical of cave painting than of Attic art in the fifth century B.C. To the Greeks, the license of the scene was neither abnormal nor shocking, yet it seems to have emboldened and liberated its artist to draw with rare spontaneity.</p>
        <p>The display below the vase is a hodgepodge of terra cotta phalluses and breasts and uteruses that were used in temple rituals; more anatomical than erotic, they represent the wish for sexual health and fertility, timeless themes that dominate modern medicine.</p>
        <p>What follows are some superb fresco paintings from private villas in Pompeii that show various forms of physical love. Whether the coupling pairs are satyrs and nymphs or the gods of antiquity, the articulation is vivid, the style lively and relaxed, the colors sublime.</p>
        <p>The image of Polyphemus with his hand firmly planted on the side of Galatea's bare hip vividly illustrates his claim in Ovid's Metamorphosis that she is ''ripe to the taste as apple or globed pear'' and ''softer than the swan, more white than she, or milk that curdles in a shepherd's bowl.'' Much of this imagery on view in Naples authentically represents the earthiness and physical passion of Ovid's text. It is no more, or less, salacious, and equally intense and graceful. Not that Ovid totally escaped censorship either. In A.D. 8, the emperor Augustus banished the poet and declared his writing unacceptable for young Romans.</p>
        <p>While Chaucer and Shakespeare openly adored the energy and eternal nature of Ovid's work, the Victorians relegated it to unreachable shelves, leaving his rediscovery to more recent times. The amorous Daphne and Apollo and the enchanting Leda in these frescoes from Pompeiian villas could have been used to illustrate those lively texts by Ovid. The Hermaphrodites unsuccessfully resisting their bold and eager lovers fit with Ovid's description of the naked Hermaphroditus succumbing to Salmacis:</p>
        <p>Though he tried to shake her off, she clung</p>
        <p>Fastening his lips to hers, stroking his breast, surrounding him with arms, legs, lips, and hands</p>
        <p>As though she was a snake caught by an eagle.</p>
        <p>Further on in the exhibition, some large first-century frescoes that served as headboards for beds in the garden of the Casa del Medico in Pompeii show pygmies in a lovely landscape. Some are frolicking in sexual pursuit of one another; others simply dance. All are rendered with the lightness and fluidity that characterize Roman painting at its best.</p>
        <p>There are also some outstanding marble reliefs and free-standing sculptures, often of nymphs and satyrs disporting themselves, some rather tamely, others with X-rated abandon. One animated, polished carving shows Pan in sexual congress with a goat. It is potentially shocking not just because of the subject but equally because of the palpable desire and tenderness with which the wild-eyed Pan and his four-legged, heavily hooved companion regard each other. As with a lot of the displays, the sexuality appears to have inspired -- or, at least, not to have diminished -- the considerable artistic skill of the creator.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, there are some lapses into lewdness without the artistry to match. The frescoes advertising the services of prostitutes and slaves fall into this category. (One inscription in Latin offers the counsel, ''Please come very slowly.'') The sculptures of disproportionately endowed mythological figures in various states of arousal are also primarily salacious. These, and all the bronze penises, are like uncouth parodies of Freudian thought. One display at Naples shows penises with bells hanging from them, penises with legs, penises with wings and, in one instance, a penis with bells, legs and wings. A small bronze gladiator faces the panther's head at the end of his own large curving penis and threatens it with a sword; it is an image that even the most outrageous of the Surrealists might have had the sense to avoid.</p>
        <p>The works that are calmer in subject and artistry, and therefore were more suitable to everyday life, are what warrant the journey. A phallic relief with an inscription that means ''here lives good luck'' was originally on the wall of a Pompeiian bakery; the image was considered a sign of health. There are banqueting objects that were charmingly bawdy but not outrageous. The anatomical imagery on amulets and mirrors had to do with warding off evil as much as with being overtly erotic. At its best, the holdings of the Secret Cabinet celebrate life in a way that is realistic and lovely to behold. One wishes only that they could be seen where they belong: in the context of everything else in this archaeological museum, as part of a life as a whole rather than as the sort of peep show that censorship and prudery have forced them to become.</p>
