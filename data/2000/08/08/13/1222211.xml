        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The answers last Sunday to Peter Applebome's request for responses to his July 23 column about his decision not to confront a black man about loud rap music with X-rated lyrics he was playing in the presence of Mr. Applebome's young daughter revealed much about the respondents. Nowhere in evidence was there concern for the daughter in permitting her to be exposed to such vulgarity -- or to the display of cowardice and ignobility implicit in failing to oppose it -- or, for that matter, for all the other little daughters who will, likewise, eventually be exposed by the failure to act now.</p>
        <p>The reasoning behind most of the respondents was the same ethic-less selfishness displayed by Mr. Applebome. ''We have to put up with more and more thoughtlessness from others and really can't fight back,'' says Marian Parker. The thought of righteous opposition to indecency evidently never crosses her mind. ''Why risk an altercation with someone you'll never see again?'' asks Gene Busnar. Someone will see that man again; are their rights not to occupy some portion of your philosophy? ''There is just too much rage floating around in society to make it worth any risk of your well-being, or even your life,'' observes Phyllis Lutzker. What kind of ''life'' is it to perpetually ignore evidences of inhumanity?</p>

        <p>The answers last Sunday to Peter Applebome's request for responses to his July 23 column about his decision not to confront a black man about loud rap music with X-rated lyrics he was playing in the presence of Mr. Applebome's young daughter revealed much about the respondents. Nowhere in evidence was there concern for the daughter in permitting her to be exposed to such vulgarity -- or to the display of cowardice and ignobility implicit in failing to oppose it -- or, for that matter, for all the other little daughters who will, likewise, eventually be exposed by the failure to act now.</p>
        <p>The reasoning behind most of the respondents was the same ethic-less selfishness displayed by Mr. Applebome. ''We have to put up with more and more thoughtlessness from others and really can't fight back,'' says Marian Parker. The thought of righteous opposition to indecency evidently never crosses her mind. ''Why risk an altercation with someone you'll never see again?'' asks Gene Busnar. Someone will see that man again; are their rights not to occupy some portion of your philosophy? ''There is just too much rage floating around in society to make it worth any risk of your well-being, or even your life,'' observes Phyllis Lutzker. What kind of ''life'' is it to perpetually ignore evidences of inhumanity?</p>
        <p>The responses that did not depict overweaning absorption with one's own survival alone displayed a penchant for embracing the insipid and meaningless. Austin J. Maher describes his wife as ''lightheartedly'' offering that she ''really likes the beat of the music, but doesn't know about the lyrics.'' Truthfulness about her opinion of the music apparently takes a back seat to simply defusing the incident. D. Grace Challoner states that she resorts, simply, to rolling up the window and having a sing-along with her child -- inculcating the notion that evil is not to be countered, only run away from, leaving others to face it. Terrence Ripmaster offers only the observation that the makers of the rap music ''generate billions of dollars into our economy.''</p>
        <p>The respondents all come from high-priced enclaves of the sort Mr. Applebome inhabits. Mr. Applebome speaks of ''a sense of suburban politesse that trumps everything else.'' Such ''politesse'' appears to be to sacrificing ethics and principle just to cut someone not from the suburbs some slack. One detects feeling that, having skewered the public in so many other ways, the least the snotty rich can do is to allow those they see as their beasts of burden to act like the animals they perceive them to be, once in a while.</p>
        <p>Mr. Applebome does, after all, conjure the image of a ''working-class white kid'' playing the rap music in a car next to him. Evidently, Mr. Applebome divorces himself from the working world. With the remuneration he is provided through the thought control articles he seems to perennially submit to the media, he seems in no hurry to consider himself part of the same masses he seeks to pattern the morality and manners of.</p>
        <p>We all are responsible for making the civilization better, and the only way it can get better is if we do not just sit back and let the world overtake us. You have to be a participant in the world.</p>
