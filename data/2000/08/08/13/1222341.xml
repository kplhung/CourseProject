        <p>Editorial Observer recalls 1960's at Yale, where three out of four major-party candidates spent their college years</p>

        <p>For all the talk of the importance of average families in the election this year, it turns out to be a grand year for elites. The last time a presidential race featured a candidate from Harvard (Al Gore), Yale (George W.

        <p>For Yale, however, it's a trifecta. With the selection of Dick Cheney and Joseph Lieberman as vice-presidential candidates, three out of the four major-party nominees spent at least some of their college years in New Haven.

        <p>For all the talk of the importance of average families in the election this year, it turns out to be a grand year for elites. The last time a presidential race featured a candidate from Harvard (Al Gore), Yale (George W. Bush) and Princeton (Ralph Nader) was 1912 -- the year of Woodrow Wilson, Teddy Roosevelt and William Howard Taft -- when the Ivy League was more clearly a place of privilege than it is today.</p>
        <p>For Yale, however, it's a trifecta. With the selection of Dick Cheney and Joseph Lieberman as vice-presidential candidates, three out of the four major-party nominees spent at least some of their college years in New Haven. It is not a burning issue, but still you have to wonder. What was there at Yale that helped incubate these choices?</p>
        <p>With his reputation as a fun-loving fraternity president, Mr. Bush fits into a popular stereotype of Yale, dating from old New Yorker cartoons depicting the guy in a raccoon coat at a football game. But what I find striking about the candidates is their echo of a peculiar strain of political ambition combined with do-goodism rampant at Yale in the 1960's, when I was a student along with Mr. Bush and Mr. Lieberman and other budding politicians like Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts and Gov. George Pataki of New York.</p>
        <p>Back then Yale, like most campuses, was a hub of idealism, networking and, in retrospect, more than a little sanctimony. My years there were framed by two Kennedy assassinations and filled with civil rights activity and antiwar protests. ''There were moments when you weren't sure about the survivability of the country,'' says Roland Betts, one of my class's biggest champions of Mr. Bush. ''It was not like today, when kids go through college planning their careers and figure that everything will be all right.''</p>
        <p>The two presidents of Yale from that era were also moral spokesmen. Kingman Brewster's defense of the legal rights of Black Panthers led eventually to his departure, and A. Bartlett Giamatti, my thesis adviser, made the study of Renaissance epic poetry into a quest for the ideal. Everything was debated in moral terms -- not just the war and the draft, but coeducation, teacher tenure and whether to join a fraternity or go to law school.</p>
        <p>According to Lewis Lapham, editor of Harper's and a chronicler of the American class system, Yale has been a place of moral debate since its founding in 1701 by ministers upset that Harvard had strayed from its religious purity. ''The argument between God and mammon, between doing well and doing good, is always alive and well at Yale,'' he says.</p>
        <p>In recent decades, the struggle has taken place on both the left and right. The left of my day saw Yale as a tool of the establishment, whereas Mr. Bush says he recalls the condescension of the liberals, just as William F. Buckley had a generation earlier. Yet Mr. Bush is sending his daughter to Yale this fall, just as Mr. Buckley sent his son.</p>
        <p>The most memorable feature of the ferment at Yale was how Yale-like it was. There was a perverse pride in knowing that while some Yale professors had done recruiting for the C.I.A. and alumni like the Bundy brothers and the Rostow brothers were helping to prosecute the war, the antiwar movement was led by Yale graduates like Benjamin Spock, David Dellinger and the Rev. William Sloane Coffin Jr. I can still remember my irritation with Mr. Coffin when he challenged a group of us to get off our rear ends -- during exam season -- to organize a protest against Lady Bird Johnson, who was speaking to the Political Union. We did, but the main goal, I remember, was to make sure that the radicals didn't do something really impolite like pull down their pants.</p>
        <p>The other relevant feature of life at Yale was what Gaddis Smith, the diplomatic historian, calls the ''ethos of organized activity.'' Mr. Smith, who is writing a book about Yale in the 20th century, says that students have aspired to organize and lead groups since the late 19th century.</p>
        <p>In the absence of student government, Yale students joined publications, sports teams, academic advisory boards, fraternities, singing groups and other organizations. I was active in The Yale Daily News and the Political Union, a campus debating society that was sometimes ridiculed as a place of earnest and ambitious student politicians. Mr. Pataki led the Union's Conservative Party, and Mr. Kerry led the Liberal Party but caused a rump faction to break off in protest against his support of the Vietnam War. Mr. Lieberman, a law student while I was at Yale, was in a separate tradition of News chairmen with political ambitions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush, by contrast, was believed to have no political ambitions. That memory came back two weeks ago, when about 18 of his classmates held a kind of class reunion at the Republican convention in Philadelphia. Everyone I talked to at the party was both proud and amazed that he had become such an extremely effective politician. In New Hampshire earlier this year, when I caught up with Mr. Bush, I found myself saying to him that I simply found it incredible that he was running for president. He laughed and said that all his classmates had the same reaction, but that it was absurd to say he never had any interest in politics.</p>
        <p>''It's true, I didn't go out and join the Conservative Party,'' he said, with that familiar trace of mockery toward the Political Union. ''But I cared about politics. Look, I'm not saying that being president of D.K.E. qualifies me to be president. But it shows that I do like to accomplish things and get people to do things. I always did.''</p>
        <p>To me, in running a moral crusade, Mr. Bush seems more than ever like the child of Yale in the 1960's that he says he never wanted to be. It sounds strained, perhaps. But it is somehow reminiscent of Yale in the 60's that on both sides its graduates are convinced they are trying to save the nation's soul.</p>
