        <p>WHEN Pina Olson and her life partner decided to buy a Manhattan apartment together in October 1998, they put money aside to hire a lawyer to draft an agreement that would spell out what would happen in the unlikely event that they eventually parted. As it turned out, Ms. Olson said, the agreement was never drafted.</p>
        <p>The couple moved into the apartment and lived together for a little more than a year. Then the unlikely happened.</p>
        <p>''I moved out in December,'' Ms. Olson said. ''He still lives there, but I'm still paying half the mortgage. I can't afford not to. If he lets it go into default, it could ruin my credit for life.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Olson, of course, is not alone. In fact, real estate lawyers say, while life partnerships have become an increasingly common alternative to traditional marriage, those who buy property with a significant other should be careful to attend to legal and practical matters first.</p>
        <p>''If two people are buying property together, and they're not legally married, they almost always need to exert some effort to protect themselves,'' said William H. Michelson, a Plainfield, N.J., real estate lawyer who frequently represents gay, lesbian and unmarried heterosexual couples.  ''There are two basic problems they have to prepare for. One is to decide what happens if one of them dies, and the other is to decide what happens if they split up.''</p>
        <p>The first issue is relatively simple for married couples, he said. They generally take title to property as ''tenants by the entirety,'' a form of ownership -- available only to married couples -- that results in title to the property passing automatically to the surviving spouse when the other spouse dies.</p>
        <p>For an unmarried couple to achieve a similar result, Mr. Michelson said, they must specifically state on the deed that they are taking title as ''joint tenants with right of survivorship.'' With such a form of ownership, he said, title passes to the surviving joint tenant on the death of the other, achieving the same result that a married couple would get with a tenancy by the entirety.</p>
        <p>It is also possible, Mr. Michelson said, to pass title to property into the name of a surviving unmarried partner by taking title as ''tenants in common'' -- whereby each partner owns a 50 percent interest in the property -- and then drawing up wills that leave each partner's share to the other upon death.</p>
        <p>Mr. Michelson cautioned, however, that buying property as tenants in common can be tricky if the partners fail to execute wills naming each as the beneficiary of the other, or if one or both of them executes a will and then later changes it.</p>
        <p>''You can end up with what I call 'the wicked stepsister syndrome,' '' Mr. Michelson said, referring to the possibility that a surviving partner may end up owning the property with a relative of the deceased partner whose relationship with the survivor may be strained or even hostile.</p>
        <p>''Once heirs have inherited a deceased partner's share they can say, 'We want the property sold,' and the surviving partner is going to be hard-pressed to stop it,'' Mr. Michelson said.</p>
        <p>Even that may be easier than dealing with an ex-partner who is still alive.</p>
        <p>''Whether you're buying a co-op, a condo, or a house, if you're not husband and wife, the law looks at you as if you were joint investors,'' said Stanley Simon, a Manhattan real estate lawyer. ''And smart investors always have written agreements governing their investments.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Simon said that regardless of how title to property is held by an unmarried couple, it is essential that the couple have an agreement that addresses the issues that often arise when a relationship sours.</p>
        <p>''The agreement can be as simple or as sophisticated as the situation dictates,'' he said, adding that at the least the partners should agree on a way to settle issues of ownership if they disagree. For example, Mr. Simon said, an agreement should establish the ground rules that would be used if one party wants to buy out the other's interest.</p>
        <p>''The most important thing is to make sure that the partner who is selling gets his or her name taken off the note and mortgage,'' he said, explaining that in most cases, the only way to do that is for the remaining partner to refinance the mortgage and put it in his or her name alone. Failure to do so, Mr. Simon said, can result in one's credit rating being damaged if the partner who remains responsible for paying the bills pays late or misses payments.</p>
        <p>''Even if the bills get paid on time, the partner who left could still have a hard time getting a mortgage on another house because he or she is still obligated on the previous mortgage,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The agreement should also specify that if a buyout cannot be accomplished without the selling partner being removed from the note and mortgage, then the property must be put up for sale to a third party.</p>
        <p>Ted Bohn, a Manhattan real estate lawyer, said that a well-drafted property ownership agreement should specify how the property is to be valued if one partner wants to buy the other's share.</p>
        <p>''The parties can agree to use a mutually agreed upon independent appraiser,'' Mr. Bohn said. ''Or, if they can't agree on that, they can agree to each get their own appraiser and then use the average of the two appraisals.''</p>
        <p>He said it is also important for property-ownership agreements to contain an acknowledgment of each partner's respective contributions to the property, including the original down payment, improvements and repairs, and payments on the mortgage.</p>
        <p>This is important because whenan unmarried couple splits up they cannot go to a divorce court, which usually seeks an equitable distribution of assets between divorcing couples. The unmarried couple must instead file what is known as an action for partition -- a legal proceeding whereby a court orders the property sold and the proceeds distributed.</p>
        <p>Unlike a divorce court, however, the court in a partition proceeding will typically look to the actual contributions of the respective parties in determining how the proceeds of the sale will be divided.</p>
        <p>''That means that if one party contributes all the down payment, makes all the repairs and improvements and pays all the mortgage payments, there's a good chance that the other party isn't going to end up with much in a partition action,'' Mr. Bohn said.</p>
        <p>Accordingly, he said, it is critical for unmarried partners who own property to keep accurate records of each partner's respective contributions over the years -- even if they have a property-ownership agreement.</p>
        <p>Ms. Olson, who has toyed with the idea of filing an action for partition against her former life partner, agreed.</p>
        <p>''When we first split up we tried to sell the apartment on our own,'' she said. ''We had these young couples in love coming in to look at it, and some of them weren't married. I wanted to pull each of those people aside and say: Whatever you do, make sure you have an agreement drawn up.  Don't be an idiot like me. It's too expensive a lesson to learn.''</p>
