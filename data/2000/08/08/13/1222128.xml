        <p>AS their lease drew to a close at 160-170 Varick Street on the lower west side of Manhattan, executives of Colahan Saunders Corporation, a commercial printing company, knew they were going to have to move. Their landlord, Trinity Church Real Estate, was converting its portfolio of buildings from largely industrial uses to offices, at rents industrial tenants could not afford.</p>
        <p>''We saw the handwriting on the wall,'' said Peter F. Burke, executive vice president of the family-owned concern, which has been in business for more than 100 years. ''Trinity was changing its flavor, and we didn't expect our lease to be renewed.''</p>
        <p>After searching for possible locations in the entire metropolitan area, Colahan Saunders settled on the Long Island City section of Queens, buying a building at 47-01 Van Dam Street a few blocks from Queens Boulevard.</p>
        <p>With vacancy rates in Manhattan near record lows and rents spiking upward, Long Island City, with its proximity to the heart of the city, good transportation links and sharply lower rents, is functioning as a destination for companies being squeezed out of Manhattan and for those that need space to expand.</p>
        <p>The space squeeze in Manhattan is responsible for the blossoming of the Jersey City waterfront on the west side of the Hudson River as companies like Goldman Sachs Group and Chase Manhattan Bank shift back-office jobs to the less costly buildings there. But the Queens area on the eastern bank of the East River has an advantage that the New Jersey location lacks: it is within New York City. For some city residents that can be an important consideration.</p>
        <p>''We could have bought a building in New Jersey for half as much as this one, but we would have lost a lot of employees,'' said Peter D. Colahan, the president of the printing company. Because they stayed in the city, he said, only one of the company's 75 employees declined to make the shift from Manhattan. The fact that so many employees remained helped to keep the operations of a company that runs 24 hours a day running smoothly.</p>
        <p>Long Island City has long been an industrial area that also served as a basement for Manhattan, holding warehousing and distribution centers for retailers like Macy's, Bloomingdale's and Gimbels. But now, as office uses are taking the place of factories and warehouses, it is changing.</p>
        <p>Jeffrey A. Bernstein, a managing director of Insignia/ESG, a big brokerage and real estate services company, said the situation in Long Island City today is similar to that in Midtown South in Manhattan two decades ago. ''I started in Midtown South 20 years ago, taking industrial properties and repositioning them for offices,'' Mr. Bernstein said. ''The same dynamic is at work in Long island City today, and service companies are coming out of Manhattan.''</p>
        <p>He said he is marketing to office tenants a building at 34-09 Queens Boulevard that was once a factory that made Breyer's ice cream. The asking annual rent in the renovated building is $25 a square foot, about half of what comparable space would cost in Manhattan. Another nearby building, at 32-02 Queens Boulevard, formerly a home to garment manufacturers, is similarly being offered to office tenants.</p>
        <p>Despite the savings in real estate costs, he said, the East River remains a barrier to many Manhattan firms, albeit a psychological one, since the area is only a few minutes away from Midtown by subway or the Queensboro Bridge, at 59th Street.</p>
        <p>To help overcome that barrier and to avoid getting lost on Queens streets, Mr. Bernstein said, he typically arranges for clients to meet him at Grand Central Terminal and take the subway. ''We can be at the buildings within seven minutes,'' he said.</p>
        <p>ONE advantage that Long Island City has over downtown Brooklyn as a location for office development is that it can serve as an adjunct of Midtown rather of downtown Manhattan, said James Meiskin, the president of Plymouth Partners, a tenant's broker. He noted that Midtown Manhattan has roughly 250 million square feet of office space compared with 100 million square feet downtown.</p>
        <p>The development of downtown Brooklyn's Metrotech complex was largely driven by Wall Street companies in downtown Manhattan shifting back-office jobs to the Brooklyn location, which is also only a few minutes away by subway. Mr. Meiskin said that Long Island City could become Midtown East, in much the same way Midtown South was transformed earlier.</p>
        <p>Long Island City's prospects for development have looked brighter in the past, only to be dimmed by a sharp decline in the Manhattan market. The company then known as Citicorp completed a 50-story, million-square-foot tower there in 1989, but it stands alone today in an area of low-rise loft buildings because the recession that followed the stock market collapse of 1987 made space available at low rents in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>One project that was hit hard by the competition from Manhattan was the proposed International Design Center in two renovated factory buildings on Thompson Avenue. It was to have been a center for design companies that could not afford Manhattan rents.</p>
        <p>''By the time the buildings became available, the concept never really took off,'' said Michael A. Barak, who represents a group that recently acquired the property. Renaming it the Queens Corporate Atrium Center, the new managers recently rented 300,000 square feet of space to MCI Worldcom, a telecommunications company.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak said that calls about available space were now coming from companies that do business with MCI Worldcom and from city agencies, such as the Department of Transportation and School Construction Authority, that are also situated there.</p>
        <p>The possibility of using low rents to lure tenants out of Manhattan is behind other projects in the area. A group led by Marvin Schnee of Schnee Realty Company in Cedarhurst recently bought a nine-story, 95,000-square-foot building at 42-15 Crescent Street at the foot of the Queensboro Street bridge. The group is renovating the lobby, but the main attraction is to be annual rents in the low $20's per square foot.</p>
        <p>''We are looking to get people from Manhattan who are paying $45 to $50 a square foot who like the sound of $25 a square foot,''  he said.</p>
        <p>Some brokers say that the conversion of industrial buildings to office use may be a good thing for the landlords involved but that it is a threat to the warehouse and mechanical companies that have cherished their proximity to Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Close to 2 million square feet of industrial space has been converted to offices recently, and industrial rents have doubled in the last 18 months, according to Franklin Zuckerbrot, executive vice president of Sholom &amp; Zuckerbrot Realty, a brokerage company. ''Companies that were paying $4 and $5 a foot are now facing $9 to $12 a foot,'' he said.</p>
        <p>One prominent landlord in the area, Irwin Cohen, the chief executive of ATC Management, said that new companies do not necessarily have to drive out industrial tenants. The trick is to combine new skills, such as computer-aided design, with the light manufacturing already in the area.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cohen, whose properties include a 10-story, million-square-foot building at 30-00 47th Avenue known as the Factory, said that one of his tenants is a jewelry manufacturer that is planning to bring out a new line of merchandise to be sold directly over the Internet, rather than through retailers or television.</p>
        <p>He said software producers could make agreements with the jewelry company not only to assist in designing the new merchandise, but also to help develop the Internet marketing system and Web sites. ''They are going to sell directly from the factory to the customer, so their prices can be lower,'' he said.</p>
        <p>New York City is the center of jewelry manufacturing in this country, he said, and developments like this one can help keep it that way. He said the rising rents in Manhattan, where he operates the Chelsea Market complex at Ninth Avenue and 16th Street, will help promote these types of alliances.</p>
        <p>''In Long Island City,'' he said, ''you can do manufacturing and e-commerce at the same place.''</p>
