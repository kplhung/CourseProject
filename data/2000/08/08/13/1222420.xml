        <p>For a coach who had just watched two of his rookies fumble away a preseason victory in the game's final seconds, Jim Fassel did not appear too shaken in the wake of the Giants' 16-13 loss Friday night.</p>
        <p>To be sure, when he emerged from the team's locker room he was a bit red-faced from yelling at his charges, or perhaps just red-faced.</p>
        <p>How often, after all, does a game turn in the final seven seconds on a collision between teammates when each was trying to protect the football and the victory?</p>
        <p>Leading by 13-9, team members were initially relieved when Giants cornerback Fred Lewis, a rookie from Louisiana Tech, intercepted a pass thrown by Jacksonville's Jonathan Quinn near the Giants goal line. Lewis, not sure if he had caught the ball in the end zone, started to advance the ball up field. Running laterally across the field, he passed Jack Golden, a rookie linebacker from Oklahoma State. Golden said later that he wanted Lewis to fall to the ground to avoid a fumble.</p>
        <p>So, as Lewis sped by, Golden reached out and tackled his teammate, knocking the football from Lewis's grasp. It rolled into the corner of the end zone, where Jacksonville tight end Brandon Christenson fell on it for the Jaguars' game-winning touchdown.</p>
        <p>''Holy smokes,'' Fassel said later to reporters.</p>
        <p>No one bothered to ask if Fassel had ever seen a finish like that. Fassel was the offensive coordinator at Stanford in 1983 when the University of California made its now famous lateral-laden, marching-band-abusing kickoff return for a touchdown on the game's final play.</p>
        <p>''That's just an amazing way to lose a game,'' Fassel said, though it was not apparent whether he was talking about 1983 or 2000.</p>
        <p>If Friday had been a regular-season game, there would have been no effort to see the bigger picture after such a bizarre loss. But since preseason games are intended to prepare for the regular season, the majority in the Giants' locker room, -- Fassel included -- saw mostly positives.</p>
        <p>The Giants starters, for example, were disheartened, but it was far more important to them that they had again showed progress -- they won their part of the game, leaving with a 10-6 lead at halftime.</p>
        <p>''We were rooting pretty hard on the sideline for the victory, so I'm not going to stand here now and say it meant nothing,'' said running back Tiki Barber, who had a spectacular game with 83 rushing yards and 27 receiving yards in one half. ''But you've got to know that what happened was a freaky thing and not let it overshadow everything else we came down here to accomplish.''</p>
        <p>Since the Giants have never played well here, and since it was their only preseason game on the road, one goal was to play a mistake-free game in an unfriendly environment. The Giants, now 0-2 in the preseason, wanted to be aggressive and show some mental toughness.</p>
        <p>The game's conclusion hardly fit the bill, but in the first half, the Giants were the better team, revealing at least a glimpse of what they would like to accomplish this year.</p>
        <p>Quarterback Kerry Collins was sharp, just as in last weekend's loss to Chicago, when the starters also left with a lead. Collins completed 10 of 19 passes for 110 yards, including a well-executed pass to Amani Toomer for a 22-yard touchdown.</p>
        <p>Barber set up a field goal and stunned the Jaguars with a 55-yard dash around right end that was all running instinct and a burst of speed.</p>
        <p>The rookie Ron Dayne had 17 carries for 66 rugged yards at running back. Dayne broke tackles, ran well in short-yardage situations and made the most of small openings.</p>
        <p>And finally, the Giants' top offensive line played with unity against an opponent known for its swarming, blitzing defense. With four new members in the line, there have been a lot of questions, but for the second successive week, Collins was not sacked and rarely even hurried.</p>
        <p>Fassel said of his new line, ''Compared to where we were last year, we're vastly improved.''</p>
        <p>Defensively, the Giants were steady, although their tackling was occasionally slipshod. The Giants were without their starting middle linebacker, Mike Barrow, who has a knee sprain, and also lost his backup, Pete Monty, who broke his thumb and will miss two to three weeks.</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>JOE MONTGOMERY played fullback, something the Giants are considering for him as the season goes on. . . . Defensive end CEDRIC JONES and defensive tackle CHRISTIAN PETER each had sacks and strong games against Jacksonville. . . . Coach JIM FASSEL said MIKE BARROW was expected to resume practicing on Monday.</p>
