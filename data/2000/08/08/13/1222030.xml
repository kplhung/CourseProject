        <p>The child free should be careful about getting what they ask for. Elinor Burkett writes, ''Every time someone takes off for that sick child or that school conference, then someone else has to pick up the extra work.'' It is a small step to go from objecting to a parent leaving early to pick up a sick child to objecting to an observant Jew asking not to be scheduled to work on Saturday or to a blind person arriving at work early and leaving early to miss the rush-hour crowds on public transit. All accommodations to personal needs are a potential inconvenience to other workers.</p>
        <p>If intolerance of personal needs becomes the norm, the child free may soon find that they, too, have lost job flexibility on needs important to them.</p>
