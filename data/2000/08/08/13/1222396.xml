        <p>Lorie Kane is down to her last red shirt. The Canadian golfer's timing is impeccable, since the du Maurier Classic's final round is Sunday and she is tied for the lead with Annika Sorenstam after 54 holes.</p>
        <p>''It's nice to sleep with the lead, but I know that Annika is a fierce competitor,'' said Kane, who managed a one-under-par 71 today and tied Sorenstam at six-under-par 210 when Sorenstam bogeyed the final hole. ''Today was an under-par round,'' Kane said, ''but it was a shaky one.''</p>

        <p>Lorie Kane is down to her last red shirt. The Canadian golfer's timing is impeccable, since the du Maurier Classic's final round is Sunday and she is tied for the lead with Annika Sorenstam after 54 holes.</p>
        <p>''It's nice to sleep with the lead, but I know that Annika is a fierce competitor,'' said Kane, who managed a one-under-par 71 today and tied Sorenstam at six-under-par 210 when Sorenstam bogeyed the final hole. ''Today was an under-par round,'' Kane said, ''but it was a shaky one.''</p>
        <p>Kane was not the only one who had a shaky round at Royal Ottawa Golf Club. Sorenstam wobbled in at even-par 72. Diana D'Alessio, the first-round leader, finished with a one-over-par 73 after incurring a one-stroke penalty on the 13th green for a moving-ball violation on top of what turned into a triple-bogey seven. She stands tied for third at 213 with Meg Mallon, who shot a 72.</p>
        <p>Juli Inkster, who charged up the leader board on Friday to put herself into contention, never seemed to recover from her own triple-bogey misfortune on the fifth hole. Inkster lost her uphill approach shot in some trees, was forced to take a lost-ball penalty, found a bunker and quickly gave away three shots to the field. Inkster was last seen today walking off the 18th green, shaking her head and mumbling after a 74 left her four strokes off the pace.</p>
        <p>Karrie Webb, the tournament's defending champion, took a tumble from seventh place after 36 holes to a six-way tie for 15th (219) after a round of 76. Webb, who has won the Nabisco Championship and the United States Women's Open this year, lost four shots on her last five holes today to damage her bid for a third major championship this year.</p>
        <p>With Royal Ottawa's small greens drying in the August sun, the third round became one of defensive maneuvering. Sorenstam, who normally plays with the precision of a sharpshooter, appeared out of sync. In a highly uncharacteristic showing, the Swedish golfer stumbled on the back nine holes with three of her four bogeys, and only one of four birdies. It was even more uncharacteristic for Sorenstam to yank her drive left off the tee on the 552-yard, par-five 18th hole. Sorenstam then punched out from under a tree, laid up with a 5-iron on an improbable 250-yard approach to the stamp-sized green, bumped a sand wedge from 75 yards to within 6 feet of the pin and nearly saved par. The putt veered left, and Sorenstam gratefully took the bogey.</p>
        <p>''I really have mixed feelings right now,'' said Sorenstam, a five-time winner this year. ''It's a downer to bogey 18, but the positive thing is I'm still in good shape for Sunday.''</p>
        <p>Kane has the momentum, coming home to Canada a week after her long-awaited, career-first victory, which came in the Michelob Light Classic in Eureka, Mo. She also has the overwhelming and unabashedly biased support of her fellow Canadians in the gallery.</p>
        <p>But Sorenstam has another weapon that most others in the field covet. She has held a final-round lead 25 times in her career, and has won 16 of those tournaments.</p>
        <p>Hunger is another factor and Kane, who was a runner-up nine times before winning, does not want to be the tour's perennial bridesmaid. What's more, in what appears to be the final staging of the du Maurier Classic, every red shirt on the property knows that only one other Canadian, Jocelyne Bourassa, has ever won the event. She did it in 1973 at the tournament's predecessor, La Canadienne, before it became a major championship. Canadian government anti-tobacco legislation has banned cigarette advertising at sports and cultural events, affecting the tournament's title sponsor, Imperial Tobacco, and Sunday's final round is likely to be this tournament's last hurrah. Tournament organizers have yet to find a new sponsor.</p>
        <p>''To be able to deliver at the du Maurier Classic for Jocelyne would mean the world to me,'' Kane said, ''and I hope that corporate Canada also is sitting out there watching to know what this tournament means to this country. It's an exciting time for me, but it's also a sad time. And I have a lot of work to do tomorrow.''</p>
