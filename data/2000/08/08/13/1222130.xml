        <p>WHEN Gervase Peterson first informed his acting coach, Nick Dana, that he planned to spend more than a month on a desert island with 15 strangers trying to pick each other off to win $1 million, Mr. Dana told him he was crazy.</p>
        <p>''I thought it was highly irregular,'' said Mr. Dana, who runs the Actor's Studio in Haddonfield. ''It's not what you would call the normal path you'd take to becoming an actor.''</p>
        <p>But after seeing Mr. Peterson hold his own against David Letterman after his departure from the CBS show ''Survivor,'' Mr. Dana was impressed and predicted big things for his 30-year-old part-time student, whom he said ''showed quite a bit of promise, right from the start.''</p>
        <p>''For a quiet guy that came in here with no experience, he has really come into his own; he's very natural, and unassuming, and he's got a lot of zip too,'' said Mr. Dana, adding that Mr. Peterson was always well prepared for class, knew all his lines and was ready to act in front of the camera.</p>
        <p>For the last year, Mr. Peterson has been taking a weekly two-hour acting workshop at the acting school, moving from the beginners' program to the advanced class. And while his Hollywood agent is looking at Mr. Peterson for his potential as a talk show host or a comedic actor, Mr. Dana said the tall, handsome former ''Survivor'' participant had a dramatic side as well, having done a convincing job in roles from Arthur Miller's ''A View from the Bridge'' and Eugene O'Neill's ''Beyond the Horizon'' at the workshop.</p>
        <p>If he makes it, Mr. Peterson will not be Mr. Dana's first success story. Linda Fiorentino, who has appeared in ''Men in Black'' and ''Last Seduction,'' graduated from the Actor's Studio, as did Melissa Connell. Laura Paige -- who long ago played the role of Ken on the soap opera ''The Secret Storm'' -- has spent the last two years studying with Mr. Dana. Ms. Paige, who is from Mount Holly, recently finished a commercial for Fleet Bank and has appeared in an ad for Mount Sinai Hospital and one for Arista Records, in which she appeared with Mr. Peterson. She described Mr. Dana as ''the true definition of a director.''</p>
        <p>''He's a great guide and teacher and he makes you really enjoy coming to class each week,'' said Ms. Paige, who has particularly appreciated his tips on she should conduct herself in auditions and pursuing job leads.</p>
        <p>Much of Mr. Dana's most recent advice for Mr. Peterson has centered on auditions and ''taking meetings,'' emphasizing the importance of letting his personality come through as well as letting them know he can act. Ms. Paige is sure Mr. Peterson's current celebrity turn will stick.</p>
        <p>''I couldn't imagine it wouldn't open doors for him,'' she said, ''especially when they realize how much talent he has.''</p>
