        <p>THE main gallery at the Stamford Art Museum and Nature Center features contemporary art as often as not.

        <p>THE main gallery at the Stamford Art Museum and Nature Center features contemporary art as often as not. But the center runs another gallery, down the driveway from the main building, where current art is always on. Art-X, as the space is called (the X is presumably for annex or exhibition), has been operating for 15 years, but was closed from 1990-1993 for budgetary reasons. An exhibition featuring a sampling of work from everyone who has exhibited at Art-X in the past five years commemorates the reborn space. But the show is not at the museum.</p>
        <p>Rather the art has come down from the mountain to the crisp white gallery at the University of Connecticut downtown. ''Best of the Art-X 95-2000'' is the show's unwieldy title. It is a diverse affair, the kind of relaxed, mixed show that used to be the norm in summer.</p>
        <p>Several strong works among those by 25 artists compel attention, and the more modest offerings are at least material for discussion. Ken Marchione, the director of art at the museum and the person who chose the artists in the first place, seems to favor art that is open, which means art that deals with the basic principles of form and color. At the same time Mr. Marchione seems to like abstraction and representationalism equally well.</p>
        <p>Three sculptures, all with the sea as a theme, attract attention by being imposing. Vincent Dion has made a life-size hammerhead shark out of some undisclosed but lightweight material. It's mounted on the wall recalling those sharks or marlins mounted in bars as trophies. But Mr. Dion's comes out of the wall into both the viewer's space and face, and is in two parts.</p>
        <p>More charming are twin fiberglass clams, by Chandler Davis. The hinges connecting the valves are like little heads; the clams are further personified by being titled ''Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee.''</p>
        <p>In her Art-X show Joan Wheeler presented color photographs of improbable creatures, but here she returns to her more usual assemblage mode that makes use of a bevy of innocuous pink plastic dolls. They cavort on seashells in a plexiglass box, with its front trimmed in white feathers (which make an interesting substitute for sea froth).</p>
        <p>One recurring trait of Mr. Marchione's selections is a novel use of materials or a fresh use of traditional techniques. Willie Bell used found objects -- including cardboard, foam packing material and a sample of industrial carpeting -- to construct three-dimensional or relief objects that recall geometric abstraction. They are modern materials for a modern style. In reverse-glass painting, an age-old technique, what is painted on one side of a piece of glass appears in reverse on the other, which is displayed. D. Dominick Lombardi uses this glossy method to render a set of creatures suffering from diseases brought about by the misuse of the environment.</p>
        <p>Michael Hearn revives the fresco technique, at least briefly, in ''Moon-Lit Villa.'' His rapidly done image on a ground of stucco and wax hints at the past glory of Italy, but its evanescence belies the permanence signified by fresco. For her digital prints, such as the one of iris flowers, Susan Karpov scans an arrangement of live flowers and plants arranged in a special light box. But how the deeply colored specimens appear in the picture is accidental.</p>
        <p>The viewer doesn't know why Ernest Jolicoeur calls his involved painting ''Allergic to Bees,'' but an off-kilter honeycomb pattern seems to emerge across surfaces of wood, canvas and Formica. For those who like to see evidence of the processes involved, Mr. Jolicoeur gouges into the Formica, while painting with acrylic and enamel on the other two materials.</p>
        <p>A mixture of contemporary means and materials -- oil pastel, Mylar and xerography -- yields Camille Eskell's old-fashioned, pleasant ''Ghost Drawing I.'' A woman in outline is posed against a faint background of paisley or leaves.</p>
        <p>The show contains numerous straightforward and energetic paintings, exemplified by the composition of pinwheel-like circles in Carol Schlosberg's ''Pretty As You Feel.'' The exhibition is dedicated to Schlosberg, who was murdered in 1996. The decision to show a sunny painting is an appropriate tribute.</p>
        <p>Instead of circles, triangles dominate ''Red River Rock,'' by Vincent Baldassano. Although the intensely red painting owes much to Abstract Expressionism, its firm and plotted compositional structure gives it a kind of majesty.</p>
        <p>A gestural approach figures in a couple of other paintings. The flow in Matthew Burcaw's eponymous painting refers to traffic. Mr. Burcaw's brush has moved the pigment in a flow-like way and the background brushwork subtly influences this painting in which the cars are sketched in black. Both Alyse Rosner and Jose Riveros allow paint to flow in inventive ways in their works. A thin application of paint allows light to shine through appropriately in ''Bedroom with Standing Lamp,'' by Matthew Lopas.</p>
        <p>A couple of veterans of the Connecticut art scene are represented by figurative works. Ann Chernow's two works are based on old movie posters, but they are rendered rather ghostly in grisaille, or gray monochrome. The heads that star in Ronald Sloan's two paintings might be bleached, but against rich backgrounds they make their deliberately irritating presence felt.</p>
        <p>''Best of the Art-X'' is at the Art Gallery at the University of Connecticut in Stamford through Sept. 12.</p>
