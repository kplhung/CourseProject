        <p>MARCUS LOEW, who founded Loews Theaters in the early 1900's, once said: ''We sell tickets to theaters, not movies.'' That was certainly the case when the grand movie palaces of the teens, 20's and 30's lit up America.</p>
        <p>For the most part, the theaters were showy grandes dames. They flaunted crystal chandeliers, marble floors and architectural ornamentation worthy of the Sun King. The Loews Paradise in Fordham in the Bronx was beyond rococo, festooned with statues, elaborate archways and intricate frescoes.</p>
        <p>By the 40's, the golden age of movie palaces was falling into a decline that, in the 70's, the mall-driven rise of the multiplex began to counter, only for it to be clobbered again by the VCR craze.</p>
        <p>But in the last few years, a new grandiosity has arrived, inflating cinemas into Brobdingnagian multiplexes that house as many as 30 screens, the theaters competing with their film selections in terms of theatricality.</p>
        <p>AMC, the national movie chain formerly known as American Multi-Cinema, has built 11 30-screen theaters in six cities, including Los Angeles, Chicago, Phoenix, Detroit, Dallas and Houston. On West 42nd Street in Manhattan, it has erected the AMC Empire 25, which, as its name suggests, has a mere 25 screens. There are also four roof decks -- a sublime amenity for stargazers, sun addicts and smokers. Those who want an unencumbered view of Manhattan's skyline can choose to look from outdoors or  indoors, thanks to vast banks of windows. At one of six concession stands, there is cafe seating and several television monitors, which show coming attractions as well as interviews with luminaries on Cable News Network. There is also a V.I.P. room for celebrities who don't want to mingle with hoi polloi.</p>
        <p>Across the street is a Loews, with a ceiling fresco in the lobby and wall murals meant to hark back to the likes of the Paradise. This cinematic emporium has 13 screens, TV sets at the concession stands and, like AMC, several talking machines where moviegoers can purchase  tickets. It also has a restaurant that supplies the concession stands with more than the usual movie fare, reflecting the fact that more profits are made there than on ticket sales. On the menu are mini mozzarella sticks ($5.99), chicken quesadillas ($5.99), potato skins ($6.99) and popcorn shrimp ($7.99).</p>
        <p>Theater owners pin this bigger-is-better, more-is-more ethos squarely on the synergy of the booming economy and changing demographics.</p>
        <p>''Times are good,'' said Rick King, a spokesman for AMC. ''People have more disposable income.'' And those people, he said, include baby boomers who have become empty nesters, and big-spending teenagers and young adults, who are savvy and demanding.</p>
        <p>''Today's teenager and young adult movie-goers have higher expectations in a technical sense,'' Mr. King said, ''for sound and picture quality.''</p>
        <p>The cinemas reflect the shift.  ''We've returned our attention to film presentation and showmanship in our buildings,'' said Marc Pascucci, a spokesman for Loews. ''The consumer is a lot more savvy about the presentation. Entertainment has become news.''</p>
        <p>Consequently, every possible technological advance is being incorporated: digital sound, bigger screens and stadium seating, where everyone is on a riser.</p>
        <p>''So what happens is, the moviegoing experience is more powerful and more consuming,'' Mr. Pascucci said. ''What we've found is that instead of going to an ordinary theater in the neighborhood, people will go to a theater one or more miles away if it's splashier.''</p>
        <p>But for all that focus, the new grandiosity holds little resemblance to the old. What technology gives now, atmosphere offered then.</p>
        <p>Stewart Jones, a senior associate at Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer Associates, a Manhattan-based architectural firm, said the old movie palaces, with their mixing of Baroque, Italian Renaissance, Classical and Moorish themes, were meant for fantasy.</p>
        <p>''You were going to a different period of time,'' he said. ''They were taking you to a different place. You were transported.''</p>
        <p>''Today's analogy,'' he said, ''is: buy a plane ticket, go down to Disney World and end up in the Magic Kingdom. It's the wonderful world of movies.''</p>
        <p>THE megaplexing trend appears to be going as global as the taste for American movies. Loews, which has 245 movie locations in 22 American  cities, also has cinemas in Canada, Spain, Hungary and Turkey. And it has plans to build in Italy and  Vietnam.</p>
        <p>It's a good bet the new style in megamultiplexing will last as long as the economy rides high -- or until some unforeseen social development steals its audience. The grand old movie palaces -- all set in urban centers -- died out less from the Depression than from housing patterns that sucked city populations into new suburbs after World War II, according to Toby Miller, a professor of cinema studies at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts.</p>
        <p>''The televisualization and suburbanization of American homes denuded the inner city of its population,'' he said. Modest cinemas became the norm.</p>
        <p>And there's another area of vulnerability. Bigger is only better until it isn't. Years ago, there was a monopoly-busting Justice Department decree that forced major movie studios, which used to control distribution, production and exhibition, to sell off the theaters.</p>
        <p>At AMC Empire 25 last week, the backlash against big was more personal. Yoland Trevino, who is from Los Angeles, said she felt like ''a rat in a maze'' trying to find a bathroom.</p>
        <p>''There are no signs visible from here,'' she said, looking around in the lobby. ''It's like sensory overload. I'm overwhelmed.''</p>
