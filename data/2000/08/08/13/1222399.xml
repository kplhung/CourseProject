        <p>It's Aug. 13. Do you know where the Florida Marlins are?</p>
        <p>At .500, with a 58-58 record, that's where they are, and that's utterly remarkable.</p>
        <p>Rising rapidly from the bitter ashes of the 1997 World Series championship and their fire sale, the Marlins have become a competitive team again, if not a contender. Putting that phrase ''competitive team again'' in perspective, this is only the second season in the Marlins' eight-year history that they have had a winning record after the All-Star Game.</p>
        <p>''We're pleased with where we are at this point compared with where we've been the past couple years,'' said Dave Dombrowski, the president and general manager, who has engineered the quick comeback. ''We know nothing matters till you're a championship team, and we have 50 games left in the season. But if you had told us in spring training we'd be over .500 in August, you'd be pleased with that. There are a lot of encouraging signs down here.''</p>
        <p>The 1997 Marlins will live forever in baseball infamy. The first team to reach the World Series that had not finished in first place, they defeated the Cleveland Indians for the championship after wiping out an Indians' lead in the ninth inning of the seventh game, then wiped themselves out by fiat of the then owner, H. Wayne Huizenga.</p>
        <p>Dombrowski, in the most painful act of his impressive career, dutifully dismantled the champions, trading his good veteran (read: high-priced) players or letting them go as free agents. At the time, it might have appeared that he was giving them away, but he was amassing a collection of talented youngsters, primarily pitchers, who have matured enough to know how to play winning baseball.</p>
        <p>The turnaround becomes even more remarkable when Dombrowski's trade itinerary is considered. He was still making trades to shed veterans well into the 1998 season, not much more than two years ago. And he has not created this winning team by snatching a free agent here and there.</p>
        <p>Consider one of the key members of the team, Antonio Alfonseca. He inherited the closer's role when the Marlins traded Matt Mantei to Arizona 13 months ago, and he has performed brilliantly. He leads the major leagues with 34 saves, and he has saved 59 percent of the 58 victories the Marlins had at the start of the weekend. Add his four victories, and he has figured in 66 percent of the victories, also tops in the majors.</p>
        <p>''We thought he had the potential to do it,'' Dombrowski said, ''but to say he'd put up the numbers he has would have been presumptuous on our part. One characteristic he had was he had ice in his veins. Look back at the World Series. He was pitching in middle relief, and he came in and pitched scoreless ball'' -- three games, six and a third innings, no runs -- ''throughout. He rose to the occasion, and he has done that as the closer. He's been phenomenal for us.''</p>
        <p>The Marlins plucked Alfonseca  from the Montreal minor league system in 1993. Two other relievers, Armando Almanza and Braden Looper, were acquired from St. Louis in the December 1998 trade of Edgar Renteria. Dan Miceli came from San Diego last winter, Manny Aybar from Cincinnati last month. Vic Darensbourg came up through the team's minor league system.</p>
        <p>The relief corps has the lowest earned run average in the majors,  3.75.</p>
        <p>''When you get late into a game, that's been our biggest plus,'' Dombrowski said.</p>
        <p>The pitching has generally been stingy in recent weeks. In the last nine games (6-3), the Marlins have allowed three or fewer runs seven times and in their last 16 games (10-6) they had given up four or fewer runs 14 times.</p>
        <p>Luis Castillo has become the catalyst of the offense, holding the National League's third-highest batting average, .352, the third-highest on-base percentage, .437, and the most stolen bases, 47. He has driven in only nine runs, but the last third of the Marlins' lineup does not give the second baseman many R.B.I. opportunities.</p>
        <p>''He epitomizes what you look for in a leadoff hitter,'' Dombrowski said. ''He disrupts the other club's pitcher any time he's on base, and he scores a lot of runs.''</p>
        <p>Preston Wilson, the center fielder, is the team's No. 1 run producer, driving in 88 runs, but he also is the major leagues' No. 1 strikeout victim. With 148 strikeouts in playing 115 of the team's 116 games, he is headed for the record of 189 strikeouts Bobby Bonds set in 1970.</p>
        <p>''He'll always be a high-strikeout guy because he has that kind of swing,'' Dombrowski said. ''But now the emphasis is on the positive side -- R.B.I.'s, stolen bases, defense. He's a maturing young person who keeps getting better and better. He's not the type of guy to be affected by the strikeouts. He knows he strikes out a lot. It's talked about a lot. But he's a very hard worker, and he works at getting better and better.''</p>
        <p>Among other developing players are first baseman Derrek Lee, third baseman Mike Lowell and right fielder Mark Kotsay.</p>
        <p>The Marlins have won 10 more games than they did in the corresponding period last year and 17 more than they did in 1998, the year after. They will not reach the playoffs this season, but they are headed in the right direction.</p>
        <p>The Losingest Pitchers</p>
        <p>The way Joe Mays pitched in his last start, he is clearly one of the favorites to win the race, but do not overlook Jose Lima. And what is Mike Mussina doing there?</p>
        <p>It's the race no pitcher wants to win: most losses of the 2000 season.</p>
        <p>Mays, who allowed four runs in a third of an inning last Thursday for Minnesota; Lima, who won 21 for Houston last season; and Steve Parris of Cincinnati are tied for the lead with 14 losses each. Kelvim Escobar of Toronto has 13, and Mussina, struggling with the dying Baltimore Orioles, is one of five pitchers with 12 losses each. Steve Trachsel, traded recently from Tampa Bay to Toronto, has 11 losses. He won last year's race with 18 losses.</p>
        <p>Brian Kingman will not be rooting for any particular pitcher to win this year's race. He'll just root, as he did with Trachsel a year ago, for none of them to lose 20. He was the last major league pitcher to lose 20, in 1980, and he wants to retain the distinction.</p>
        <p>Clemens Is Highest Paid</p>
        <p>The Yankees are not shouting it from the highest hill; they're not even whispering it under the covers. But contrary to George Steinbrenner's allergic reaction to establishing salary standards, the Yankees have done just that by making Roger Clemens the highest-paid player in baseball history.</p>
        <p>That development was not mentioned Friday when the Yankees announced that they have given Clemens a contract extension worth $30.9 million. That's because the Yankees called it a three-year deal. But Clemens has to play only two years to receive all of that money so the annual average value computes to $15.45 million, and it surpasses the $15 million average of Kevin Brown's seven-year contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers, the previous record.</p>
        <p>The Yankees will jump up and down and insist that the two-year computation is incorrect; they'll stamp their feet and say the third year has to be included and that the average is really $10.3 million. But the third year is an option year -- at Clemens's option. He can say no, thank you, not play for the Yankees in 2003 and still collect his money for that year, $10.3 million.</p>
        <p>Any money a player can receive for an option year that is not exercised, either by the club or the player, is included in the guaranteed part of the deal. The year, however, is not because it is not known if the player will play for the team that season.</p>
        <p>Pedro Martinez, for example, has a six-year contract with the Boston Red Sox that includes an option for a seventh season in 2004 at a $17.5 million salary. If the Red Sox do not exercise the option, they will pay Martinez $2.5 million. To determine the value of the contract, that $2.5 million buyout is added to the other guaranteed money for a total of $75 million for six years, or an average of $12.5 million a year.</p>
        <p>The collective bargaining agreement between the owners and the players stipulates that when it comes to free agents clubs cannot act in concert with other clubs and players cannot act in concert with other players. But the labor contract does not say anything about owners acting in concert with players and their agents, and that's what Steinbrenner has apparently done here with Randy and Alan Hendricks, the pitcher's agents.</p>
        <p>The Yankees acquired Clemens in a trade with Toronto in February 1999. As a player traded during a multiyear contract, the pitcher had the right to demand a trade last November. When he did not invoke that right even as leverage for an extension, Clemens seemed to confirm what some baseball executives had said: that the two sides already had an understanding about an extension.</p>
        <p>One person with knowledge of the Clemens development said the contract announced Friday is a two-year deal with the $10.3 million for the third year serving as a makeup for the lower salaries Clemens has had in his two years with the Yankees, $8.25 million last year, $6.35 million this. He said the two sides had reached that understanding last year.</p>
