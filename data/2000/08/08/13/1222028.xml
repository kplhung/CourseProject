      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Belkin raises many intriguing points, but I want to focus on just one: the alleged unfairness of workplace accommodation to people with children. Our child is grown and starting his career. While he was growing up, I tried to come home at a reasonable hour and to spend weekends on family things rather than office work. Sometimes, I am sure, it meant that others covered my matters and helped move things along.</p>
        <p>But when our son went off to college, an odd thing happened. Even though I was more senior, and had people working with me, I began to work later and to cover other people's work, so that they could be with their children and families. It wasn't a conscious thing, and it certainly wasn't mandated. But I tried to make it to all those ''little'' events that were so big when my son was growing up, and I want my colleagues to be able to do the same.</p>
        <p>What happened with me, and I've noticed similar behavior in my colleagues, probably shows that I work for a company with its head screwed on straight. But it also illustrates a more general point: we are all in this together -- young and old, the parent and the child free.</p>
