        <p>As air tankers loaded with fire retardant droned overhead, a group of us gathered at the Teller Wildlife Refuge in Montana's Bitterroot Valley to discuss the role of fire in the natural ecosystem. A rash of fires in the valley has turned the Big Sky into the Red Sky, a bloodshot whirl of smoke and fancy colors. The main highway, U.S. 93, has become a runway for fire vehicles -- dilapidated school buses transporting 20-person crews, brush buggies rigged with small fire hoses, heavy fire engines with thousands of gallons of water, water tankers, and on and on.</p>
        <p>The audience at the symposium had come from near and far. There were enough Forest Service personnel from the region for a reunion of sorts. But we had a smattering of people from out of state as well, both new residents of the Bitterroot Valley, the fastest-growing region in Montana, and visitors to the Teller refuge, a private sanctuary along the Bitterroot River.</p>
        <p>In the past decade, the Bitterroot Valley has become a magnet for retirees, stock market millionaires and computer techies with dreams of a ''cabin in the woods,'' even if the cabins cost upward of $500,000.</p>
        <p>The conference became something of a forum for new-old conflicts. Three of us -- Jack Ward Thomas, retired chief of the Forest Service, Stephen J. Pyne, author of a dozen books on fire history, and I -- tried to explain the basic fire problems of the West, in particular the challenge of protecting the rising number of homes and cabins built in once-unpopulated forests and grasslands, the so-called urban-wildland interface.</p>
        <p>The dream home, a log structure with a shake roof nestled among trees, is a firefighter's nightmare. A fire crew may well walk away from such a place and let it burn -- a revelation to newly arrived urbanites, used to city services.</p>
        <p>A federal crew chasing a fire beyond the public lands will defend private homes. But these people should not be asked to risk their lives if a homeowner has done nothing for wildfire protection, we told the crowd.</p>
        <p>Forest Service vets nodded happily. Some homeowners looked glum. One visitor piped up: ''Why can't you solve the problem with zoning? In New York City we'd solve this problem in a minute. We'd pass zoning so the houses would be built properly.'' Pretty tough talk from a city that couldn't pick up its own garbage a few years ago. But the problem is broader than regional resentments.</p>
        <p>As fire rages across the 11 Western states this summer, there is no quick fix in sight. With the current fire season only half over, more than 4 million acres have burned, already making this the worst fire season in almost half a century. The previous record was 14 million acres in 1952.</p>
        <p>Today, huge amounts of dead wood  are ready to burn.</p>
        <p>For the past century, the natural cycle of fires has been interrupted. After fires destroyed early communities in the West -- the famed 1910 fire burned more than 3 million acres in Montana and Idaho and killed more than 85 people -- the federal government adopted the ''10 a.m. policy,'' meaning every fire was to be controlled by 10 o'clock the morning after it was spotted. In recent years, forest managers have allowed some fires to burn, if they pose no threat to life and property.</p>
        <p>Logging and prescribed burning can help, but both have checkered histories. Rapacious logging practices created a backlash that has reduced the timber cut on federal lands to a quarter of what it was.</p>
        <p>Prescribed burning, a godsend to land managers because it creates breaks in the vegetation, lost some of its allure this spring. A prescribed burn got out of hand and tore through  Los Alamos, N.M., and wiped out more than 200 homes. The General Accounting Office estimates it would cost $12 billion to conduct prescribed burning operations on the 40 million acres of land needing treatment -- and that assumes no more expensive mistakes.</p>
        <p>The federal fire effort also suffers from government downsizing and aging of the workforce. There are so few experienced supervisors left that Australian fire managers have been called to help out.</p>
        <p>Federal spending on fire runs close to $1 billion a year, but budget numbers amount to a gamble, a yearly bet that nothing like this summer will happen. Federal fire budgets are based on a percentage of a 10-year average season, with emergency funds available for heavy seasons. But this ensures inadequate funds for staples like training and staffing.</p>
        <p>The threat fire poses to homes is a bigger problem than a local zoning board can handle, we told the questioner from New York. For one thing, home builders can hop from one jurisdiction to another, avoiding restrictions. But those who buy the homes will expect protection.</p>
        <p>The West has a split personality on government interference. A Montana newspaper poll taken this summer as fires raged showed almost even numbers favoring tighter restrictions and favoring none.</p>
        <p>Attitudes may change with more bad fire seasons. At this stage, no one has had the temerity to propose mandatory national standards. The occasional insurance company provides a wake-up call, denying coverage for a home that cannot be defended. Many homeowners have installed metal roofs, moved woodpiles and taken other steps.</p>
        <p>This season's fires will die out with the snows this fall. But controversy and confusion over how to handle the fire crisis will be with us for years to come.</p>
