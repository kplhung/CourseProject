        <p>Every minor leaguer has a major league dream. This is one of them.</p>
        <p>George Steinbrenner's plane, en route from Tampa, Fla., to New York, is forced to land at the tiny Harford County airport near here. Impatient, feeling baseball-deprived, the Boss dials the radio until he lands at the tiny community station, WHFC-FM 91.1. He is mesmerized by the local game he hears, the quickness, depth, savvy, desire, the power to use the entire field.</p>
        <p>He growls at an assistant, ''Who is that guy and why isn't he at Yankee Stadium?''</p>
        <p>That guy, the dreamer, is Neal Conan, the 50-year-old rookie play-by-play announcer of the Aberdeen Arsenal, a first-year expansion club in the independent Atlantic League. Like Conan, the players are not kids, most of them struggling to be rediscovered after being cut from major league farm teams.</p>
        <p>But Conan, who gets to dream out loud, has had 23 years in the major leagues, as an executive producer, a host, a prize-winning foreign correspondent for National Public Radio, from which he is on leave.</p>
        <p>Four years ago, while preparing for a live broadcast from the Democratic convention in Chicago, his attention was caught by the Cubs' broadcasters on his hotel television. He thought: that isn't so different, I can do it. He began taping play-by-plays in front of a silent TV screen. For the past three seasons, he moonlighted as the part-time second voice of the Bowie Baysox.</p>
        <p>And on the night of Aug. 5, he was climbing the metal ladder to the roof of the tiny press box at the tiny home field of the local community college. An old friend, me, handed up his cables, mikes, headset, Comrex Hotline, Shure mixer, Sony DAT recorder, all of which, he explained, will ''squirt the broadcast signal down a telephone line from the ballpark to the radio station'' and back out to an unknown number of listeners, including Conan.</p>
        <p>He broadcasts with the backfeed echoing in his ears; it is the only way he can be sure he is really on the air. Because his cell phone is a different area code from the station's, he is not sure that someone there will call long distance if there is a problem. If indeed there is someone there.</p>
        <p>''All of this,'' I said, minutes before the game, ''seems like a midlife crisis to me.''</p>
        <p>''Yep,'' said Conan, cheerfully.</p>
        <p>He paced the press box roof, waiting to begin his pregame show with a taped interview. He had melted Maleke Fowler's reserve by dubbing the 25-year-old outfielder ''the discourager'' for having hit a leadoff home run in the last game.</p>
        <p>''The discourager,'' I sneered. ''Talk about ingratiating yourself with a subject. Did you call Saddam Hussein 'the heavy hitter?' Some Bosnian jackal 'the cleanup man?' ''</p>
        <p>Conan, who was captured and held for a week by the Iraqis while covering the Iran-Iraq war nine years ago, smiled serenely through a graying red beard. ''It's true, I never said, 'What a great ambush.' Reportorial detachment is good, but it's nice to finally be for something. I want these guys to win, to do well. I got rushes covering wars and political conventions and the impeachment hearings, but this is all by myself, filling three hours on the radio, feeling really alive.''</p>
        <p>Suddenly, Conan screamed into his phone: ''Why aren't we on the air? It's Neal. Pick up the phone.''</p>
        <p>It was not until the first Lehigh Valley Black Diamond was at the plate that the connection was made and Conan was alive again. It was easy to imagine his clear, dryly friendly voice in a larger market. His delivery is crisp, seamless and authoritative, if a little forgiving; he tends to excuse overrun pop flies as lost in the late-evening shadows. But there is no false enthusiasm and no irony. He has also learned that it is one thing to inform listeners that the 26-year-old pitcher Zac Stark read Updike and Hesse on the last bus trip, another to extol someone's wife and kids back home when that someone is dating locally.</p>
        <p>This is ''family entertainment'' as much as it is organized baseball. Independent league teams, with no responsibility to develop players, can concentrate on winning games and profitably building a community audience. Seats are $12 and $8 (children under 5 and in Little League uniforms are free). Cal Ripken Jr., who was raised in nearby Aberdeen, is part owner of the club and is building a fancy ballpark with a baseball academy attached.</p>
        <p>Conan is thinking bigger, too; commentaries on his minor league life are broadcast every other Friday on NPR's ''Morning Edition'' and will fuel a book, entitled ''Play by Play.'' That might get Steinbrenner's attention.</p>
        <p>But it is still the bushes and far from home. His two college-age children and wife, Liane Hansen, an NPR anchor, live outside Washington, too far to commute. She says he looks 10 years younger, and he says he is happy, but he has had twinges as the political season heated up. Was he doing the right thing?</p>
        <p>''But then,'' Conan said, ''a fan asked me to sign his glove. That never happened at a convention.''</p>
