        <p>There is probably no more efficient way for a newspaper columnist to spark a rhetorical tempest than to compare a person with whom they have a dispute to Hitler. It is also a good way to get your column suspended, as the writer, Frank Borzellieri, has found out.</p>
        <p>Last month, Mr. Borzellieri used his column in The Queens Ledger, a chain of six weekly newspapers, to apply the Hitler analogy, among other insults, to Terri Thomson, the appointed Queens representative on the city's seven-member Board of Education. He wrote that the two shared an ''anti-democratic, anti-representative government view of the world.'' The column also repeatedly ridiculed Ms. Thomson's physical appearance.</p>

        <p>There is probably no more efficient way for a newspaper columnist to spark a rhetorical tempest than to compare a person with whom they have a dispute to Hitler. It is also a good way to get your column suspended, as the writer, Frank Borzellieri, has found out.</p>
        <p>Last month, Mr. Borzellieri used his column in The Queens Ledger, a chain of six weekly newspapers, to apply the Hitler analogy, among other insults, to Terri Thomson, the appointed Queens representative on the city's seven-member Board of Education. He wrote that the two shared an ''anti-democratic, anti-representative government view of the world.'' The column also repeatedly ridiculed Ms. Thomson's physical appearance.</p>
        <p>When The Queens Ledger's publisher and editor, Walter Sanchez, read the column, after it had been published, he said he felt ''utterly ashamed.'' He informed Mr. Borzellieri, who was elected three times to School Board 24 in western Queens, that he would be suspended indefinitely as a paid columnist for the newspaper chain. The decision spawned some 40 letters to the editor, Mr. Sanchez said, a large majority of which objected to the columnist's removal.</p>
        <p>The publisher defended his decision in an editorial that stated, ''There is a line of simple human decency which should not be crossed.''</p>
        <p>He added that the column read as an ad hominem attack because Mr. Borzellieri did not explain his main complaint about Ms. Thomson. That  centered on Chancellor Harold Levy's decision in June not to name John Lavelle. a school principal, as district superintendent, as Board 24 had recommended.</p>
        <p>In an interview, Mr. Borzellieri accused Ms. Thomson of working to thwart the hiring of Mr. Lavelle. ''She used her influence to ruin a good man's career,'' he said. He did not mention the issue in his column, he said, because he assumed his readers knew of the dispute. As for the Hitler reference, he said he was using hyperbole to give Ms. Thomson ''a bloody nose.''</p>
        <p>A board spokeswoman, Vicki Streitfeld, said Ms. Thomson was on vacation last week and could not be reached for comment.</p>
        <p>But City Comptroller Allan Hevesi called Ms. Thomson ''one of the most decent people in public life.'' He added, ''It's O.K. to disagree with her about an issue, but comparing her to Adolf Hitler is sick.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Borzillieri admitted that he may have pushed his points with too much spleen.</p>
        <p>''It may have backfired in a sense,'' the columnist said, referring to the statements about Ms. Thomson offered by the comptroller and others. ''If anything, it's gotten her sympathy.''</p>
