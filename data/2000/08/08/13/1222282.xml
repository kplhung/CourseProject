        <p>Shelley Caroline Neumeier, the daughter of Carol Jean Oldham of San Anselmo, Calif., and Edward James Neumeier of Kentfield, Calif., was married yesterday at the Serai, a hotel on Bali, to James Thomas Farley III, a son of Johanna and James Farley Jr. of Washington. The Rev. I Wayan Mastra, a minister with the Protestant Church of Indonesia, officiated.</p>
        <p>The bride, 34, and the bridegroom, 28, worked until recently as television news editors for CNBC Asia in Singapore.</p>
        <p>Ms. Neumeier, who will keep her name, graduated magna cum laude from Brown University. Her father retired as an administrator for the Tamalpais Union High School district in Marin County, Calif. Her mother runs a counseling service for prospective college students, in San Anselmo.</p>
        <p>Mr. Farley, who is known as J. T., graduated cum laude from Georgetown University and received a master's degree with distinction in Asian politics from the University of Hong Kong. His mother, a tour guide in Washington, was previously the consumer protection commissioner for Rockland County, N.Y. His father is vice president for news and programming at WTOP-AM in Washington.</p>
        <p>Mr. Farley was working for CNBC Asia in Hong Kong in 1998 when it merged with Dow Jones's Asia Business News. He was transferred to Singapore, where he met Ms. Neumeier, then with Dow Jones. ''He had three strikes against him,'' she recalled. ''He had a girlfriend, he was too young and he was my co-worker.''</p>
        <p>That September, Mr. Farley left for a four-month sabbatical in the United States and Mongolia, where his girlfriend was working. But after a month, ''I realized I was in love with Shelley,'' he said, and he returned to Singapore.</p>
        <p>Soon the two were seeing more of each other than they had bargained for. Both were promoted, and given overlapping responsibilities. They worked in close quarters, and then decided to share an apartment. ''I saw it as kind of a litmus test,'' Mr. Farley said. In short order, they agreed they could ''handle a more permanent arrangement.''</p>
