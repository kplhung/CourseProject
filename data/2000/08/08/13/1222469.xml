        <p>HISER-Elizabeth. The staff of Miavita mourn the tragic loss of our esteemed and beloved colleague Betsy Hiser. Our hearts go out to her children, Jessica, Will and Peter, and to her family who have lost a treasure and shining light. Betsy walked tall among us. She was a leader and the embodiment of the healthy lifestyle she so earnestly wanted to help others achieve. We are honored to have shared her light and wisdom and will endeavor to spread her words and knowledge to others, as she would have wished.</p>
