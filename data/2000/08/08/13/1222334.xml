        <p>WE must help protect our children, in our schools and streets, by finally and strictly enforcing our nation's gun laws,'' Gov. George W. Bush of Texas declared in his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia. In other words, Mr. Bush was saying, we don't need more laws to do the job.</p>
        <p>This is one side of the long-running debate on how to control the terrible toll guns exact on the country. It is the side supported by the Republican leadership in Congress and the National Rifle Association, who see new gun laws as a threat to American freedom.</p>
        <p>But is this true? In 1998 alone, 30,708 people were killed by guns in America, including murders, suicides and accidents, at an additional cost to society estimated as high as $100 billion. Are current laws adequate to fight this scourge?</p>
        <p>The case of Bill Dollar suggests they aren't. For years, Mr. Dollar and his sister Connie Jean, operating from their gun stores in Birmingham, Ala., used friends, strangers, homeless people and drug addicts to fill out federal handgun applications, then watched as these people turned the weapons over to illegal dealers or gang members from Brooklyn. It was a classic example of straw purchasing, using someone to buy a gun for a person prohibited from doing so.</p>
        <p>Altogether, according to the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, guns from the Dollars' stores were used in at least 50 homicides and 901 violent crimes in 12 states, from Massachusetts to Texas. But despite years of investigation by the bureau and witnesses willing to testify that they lied on the paperwork with the Dollars' knowledge, a federal judge dismissed all the charges against them. Congress has never passed a law fully and clearly barring the practice, so lying on a federal form was not enough to convict corrupt gun dealers, the judge said.</p>
        <p>A.T.F. agents and prosecutors say that, in fact, the nation's gun laws are a hodgepodge, filled with loopholes and provisions devised by pro-gun lawmakers to make the laws hard to enforce. Until the last few years, all this was obscured by the fact that the illegal gun market was not well understood. It was generally believed that criminals and juveniles stole their guns, or borrowed them from friends, and that given the nation's 200 million firearms, there was little anyone could do to stanch the supply.</p>
        <p>But under prodding by the Clinton administration, the bureau greatly expanded its efforts to trace the origin of guns used in crimes, and it came up with a surprising discovery. More than half of the guns criminals use are purchased from federally licensed dealers using gun traffickers, like those who went to the Dollars, said David Kennedy, a senior researcher at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University.</p>
        <p>This is largely because criminals and juveniles are brand-conscious, Mr. Kennedy said. They want the same high-powered handguns they see in the movies.</p>
        <p>Further data gained from tracing crime guns has now shown that only a handful of suspect dealers, 1.2 percent of the nation's 83,000 licensed dealers, supply almost 60 percent of the guns used in crimes. Mr. Kennedy said this information led to Boston's successful campaign against guns. Supply was greatly reduced by targeting suspect dealers, traffickers and straw purchasers, and only one juvenile has been killed in Boston by a handgun in the last two years.</p>
        <p>But the framework of gun laws, including the powers granted the firearms bureau, has not kept pace with this information. In addition to being hampered by Congress's failure to ban straw purchases, the bureau is allowed to inspect a dealer's records only once a year. It cannot send in undercover agents posing as felons to buy guns from a gun store; it cannot maintain a computerized record of gun sales.</p>
        <p>The bureau also lacks authority to regulate sales by individuals at gun shows or elsewhere, perhaps 40 percent of all sales. This undermines the effect of the Brady law, which requires background checks on handgun buyers, but only from licensed dealers, says a study published this month in the Journal of the American Medical Association.</p>
        <p>Then there are the restrictions created by the Firearm Owners Protection Act of 1986, a law championed by the N.R.A. For the firearms bureau to prosecute individuals who sell large numbers of guns without a license, it must prove that they are engaged in the business ''for livelihood and profit,'' a vague term that has led to cases being thrown out of court. The law also reduced to a misdemeanor the penalty for dealers who failed to keep records of their sales, or forged them.</p>
        <p>''For all practical purposes, after 1986, it became somewhere between difficult and impossible to prosecute dealers for selling guns without keeping a record, because U.S. attorneys don't want to waste their time prosecuting misdemeanors,'' said William Vizzard, a retired A.T.F. agent who is now a professor of criminal justice at California State University at Sacramento.</p>
        <p>Wayne LaPierre, the N.R.A.'s executive vice president, insists this is all beside the point. ''The government has every statute it needs to stop the bad guys, and when they don't, I think they are just playing politics,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Rather than focusing on gun dealers, who Mr. LaPierre believes are legitimate business people, he says the Clinton administration should go after street criminals caught using guns, then prosecute them in federal court, where they can be given harsher sentences.</p>
        <p>BUT who will make the arrests? The N.R.A. has long opposed expansion of the firearms bureau, calling its agents ''jackbooted fascists,'' so that in 1998 it had just 1,631 agents, only nine more than in 1973. And the Republican-controlled Congress has not acted on a Clinton administration request last winter to hire 500 more A.T.F. agents and 1,000 state and federal prosecutors specifically to attack gun crime.</p>
        <p>Finally, even successful prosecutions of gun law violations are relatively ineffective. That is because penalties for gun crimes are light, especially compared with the harsh mandatory sentences for drug crimes, often 10 to 25 years in prison. In 1998, a task force of federal firearms agents and New York City police officers tracked two traffickers who had purchased 90 handguns in Georgia and were selling them without a license in New York. One was sentenced to 18 months incarceration. The other received six months home detention.</p>
