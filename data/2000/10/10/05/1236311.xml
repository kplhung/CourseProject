        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your Oct. 4 coverage of the first presidential debate would seem to suggest that it ended in a draw. Does this mean that because George W. Bush did not fall off the stage that he held his own with Al Gore? To cite one example, Mr. Bush has no foreign policy background, and he seemed befuddled and impatient with these questions.</p>

        <p>Your Oct. 4 coverage of the first presidential debate would seem to suggest that it ended in a draw. Does this mean that because George W. Bush did not fall off the stage that he held his own with Al Gore? To cite one example, Mr. Bush has no foreign policy background, and he seemed befuddled and impatient with these questions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore demonstrated a complex grasp of multiple subjects, seemed eager to get his point across and to debate on any and all subjects, while Mr. Bush appeared scripted and ''handled.''</p>
        <p>At work this morning, the discussion was all about the debate, and Democrats and Republicans alike agreed that Mr. Gore presented a far higher intelligence, depth of experience and fuller grasp of the issues.</p>
