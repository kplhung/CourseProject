        <p>Dell Warns That Its Sales Will Not Meet Estimates  Dell Computer told analysts that its third-quarter sales would fall about $8.2 billion, or 3 percent, below estimates, attributing the problems to weak demand in Europe and from small-business customers in the United States.</p>

        <p>Dell Warns That Its Sales Will Not Meet Estimates  Dell Computer told analysts that its third-quarter sales would fall about $8.2 billion, or 3 percent, below estimates, attributing the problems to weak demand in Europe and from small-business customers in the United States.</p>
        <p>The announcement, combined with similar shortfalls from Apple Computer and Intel, could indicate a widespread slackening of demand for computers. [Page C10.]</p>
        <p>Brothers to Combine Their Banks  Firstar of Milwaukee agreed to acquire U.S. Bancorp of Minneapolis in a $21 billion stock deal that unites two large regional banks led by brothers. The combination will create the nation's eighth-biggest bank. [C4.]</p>
        <p>Nasdaq Rebounds With a 2% Gain  The Nasdaq composite index gained 67.27 points, or 2 percent, to 3,523.10. The Dow Jones industrial average advanced 64.74 points, or 0.6 percent, to 10,784.48, while the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index rose 7.86 points, or 0.6 percent, to 1,434.32. [C12.]</p>
        <p>PepsiCo Chief to Retire Next Year  Roger A. Enrico, 55, left, the chairman and chief executive of PepsiCo, who transformed the company from an expansive and rather cumbersome conglomerate into a streamlined packaged-foods company, announced that he would retire by the end of next year. Steve S. Reinemund, 52, PepsiCo's president and chief operating officer, who is known for his tenacious and, at times, single-minded focus on growth, will take over as chief executive by 2002 and chairman by 2003. [C2.]</p>
        <p>Drug Makers' Broad Unseen Reach  With prescription drug prices at the center of the political debate, the drug industry has so far staved off what it fears most: a government-run prescription drug plan for the elderly, which drug makers say could lead to price controls. The industry has a broad and sometimes unseen reach into the debate. [A1.]</p>
        <p>Oracle Reaffirms Its Projections  Oracle executives sought to clarify remarks made earlier in the week by the company's chief financial officer that apparently led to a sell-off in its stock. The company reaffirmed its revenue and earnings projections. [C10.]</p>
        <p>Firestone Accused of Hiding Defects  Ford's Venezuelan unit accused Firestone of hiding defects in its tires and said the company should take responsibility for more than 100 road accidents in Venezuela. [C19.]</p>
        <p>Not Enough Air Travel Deregulation  With deregulation, more people are flying than ever before, but delays are common. That is because airports and the air traffic control system are still owned and operated by government agencies and have neither the flexibility nor the incentives to operate efficiently. Virginia Postrel: Economic Scene. [C2.]</p>
        <p>Correction:  October 6, 2000, Friday  An entry in the Business Digest yesterday about Dell Computer's announcement that its sales growth could slow in the third quarter misstated its projection. Dell predicted a revenue increase to about $8.2 billion -- 3 percent below estimates -- not a decrease of $8.2 billion.</p>
