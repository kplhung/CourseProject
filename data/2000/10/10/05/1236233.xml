        <p>Vice President Al Gore today intensified a foreign policy argument with George W. Bush that began during their debate on Tuesday, arguing that his vision of using the American military to build new democracies after peace is won has its roots in the Marshall Plan that rebuilt Western Europe after World War II.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's argument that using the military in that role was endangering its essential function, Mr. Gore suggested, ignored the lessons of a postwar policy that he credited not only with saving a war-ravaged continent but also with building prosperity and, ultimately, reuniting Germany under democracy after the collapse of Communism.</p>
        <p>''It's not a new mission,'' Mr. Gore insisted, when asked about Mr. Bush's criticism that American military preparedness has suffered because troops are overdeployed around the world, often for nonmilitary tasks. ''The generation that won World War II, having seen the catastrophe of the interwar period of the '20s and '30s, wisely decided that nation-building was a preferable alternative to World War III.''</p>
        <p>''And it was a stunning success,'' he added, suggesting that it could be replicated around the world today.</p>
        <p>The Marshall Plan, announced shortly after the war by Secretary of State George C. Marshall, was an economic reconstruction effort for Western Europe and involved aid, not troops. But in Japan and to some extent in Germany, the American occupation forces helped build a court and legislative system, drafting laws and running local governments, as well as providing security. Mr. Gore was suggesting that that was an appropriate model, on a smaller scale, for American troops in Bosnia and Kosovo.</p>
        <p>The vice president spoke today in an hourlong interview on foreign policy in response to a request sent several weeks ago to both major party candidates to talk about how the United States should use its military, financial and diplomatic power abroad. Mr. Bush's aides have said they are considering the request, but have not set a date.</p>
        <p>In his interview, Mr. Gore also said that if he was elected, he would refuse to lift most sanctions on Cuba until Fidel Castro died or was removed from office. When it was suggested that the next president might have to deal with a change of regime in Havana, Mr. Gore shot back, ''I hope so.'' He described himself as a ''hard-liner on Cuba.''</p>
        <p>Opposition to Castro's government is a major political issue in Florida, a state that Mr. Gore's aides say they now believe he can win. A victory there would be crucial in Mr. Gore's efforts to put together enough electoral college votes to win the presidency five weeks from now.</p>
        <p>In a survey of world trouble spots, Mr. Gore also said that as president he would step up efforts to help the Iraqi opposition to President Saddam Hussein -- though he declined to say if the aid would be overt or covert -- and he was sharply critical of Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin, for efforts to harass the country's newspapers and crack down in Chechnya. He also spoke at length about his growing concern that Indonesia, the world's fourth most populous nation, was on the brink of chaos, but conceded that he had yet to explore options about how the United States could stabilize the country.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's position on Cuba was in sharp contrast to his views on how to deal with another hard-line but economically failing Communist nation, North Korea, whose leaders also go to extraordinary lengths to repress dissent. There, he insisted, a slow but steady lifting of American sanctions has ''yielded some tentative positive results,'' including recent reunions between North and South Korean families that have been separated for half a century. But he added that while North Korea has ''been moving haltingly in the right direction, Cuba has been moving headlong in the wrong direction.''</p>
        <p>Historically, foreign policy plays a major role in presidential elections only during times of crisis, most notably in the 1968 contest at the height of the Vietnam War and in the 1980 election, during the Iran hostage crisis. In today's interview, Mr. Gore noted that ''even in our increasingly interdependent world,'' where foreign economic crises affect agricultural markets, and when oil supplies are once again a major issue, ''foreign policy is still not usually on the front burner for most people.'' Indeed, at a rally here in Ohio today just before his interview, he never mentioned international issues, and he rarely does from the stump.</p>
        <p>''The cliche that you often hear is that it can't help you but it can hurt you,'' he said. ''I'm not sure that's true.'' His advisers, when speaking on background, often describe Mr. Gore's knowledge of the world in an effort to make the case that he is more suited for the presidency than is Mr. Bush. Mr. Gore himself, earlier this year, described Mr. Bush as ''noticeably blank'' on issues of foreign policy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore avoided such criticisms today. But, looking relaxed as he settled into a wingback chair next to a fireplace at a hotel here, he used every opportunity to display the fruits of seven years of daily intelligence briefings. He talked about the nature of the rebellions in Aceh, an Indonesian province, differentiated among the Iraqi groups opposing Mr. Hussein, and discussed at length his conversations with Jiang Zemin, China's president, about Beijing's efforts to control Internet traffic.</p>
        <p>''Their efforts to control the Internet are doomed to failure,'' he said, calling that one of the ''happy side effects'' of the trade agreement with China that the Senate endorsed two weeks ago by granting China permanent trade status with the United States.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore used the discussion of when he would deploy the military to draw sharp contrasts with Mr. Bush, saying it was ''one area where Governor Bush and I part ways.'' He suggested, as he did on Tuesday night in Boston, that sometimes American troops might be sent to prevent humanitarian crises even if any direct threat to American security was remote. And he drew attention to Bosnia, where he was an earlier advocate of intervention than was President Clinton.</p>
        <p>''It was later than it should have been,'' he said of the decision to use force in Bosnia in 1995. ''But it wasn't too late.'' At another point he said: ''It was a hard decision for the United States to get involved. But it was in my view, clearly, the right decision.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's top foreign policy adviser, Condoleeza Rice, said on Tuesday night in Boston that the governor's concern about ''nation building'' centered on a fear that American troops were being used for ''civil administration, taking kids to kindergarten,'' and that they are unwisely ''sent to intervene in civil wars, as in Haiti.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore acknowledged that there was ''a legitimate concern about how far we go,'' but argued that part of what he called forward engagement in the world was the use of American troops to build courts, administrative agencies and schools. His father, later a senator, had such a role in Germany after World War II, he said.</p>
        <p>When the discussion turned away from the Balkans and toward Indonesia -- where the United States has been deeply involved since the Asian economic crisis of 1997 and the forced resignation of President Suharto a year later -- Mr. Gore was clearly less comfortable describing how the United States might make use of ''forward engagement.''</p>
        <p>He said he would talk to American ambassadors, military commanders and knowledgeable academics, in order to ''give a more considered answer, rather than trying to hop off on the spur of the moment.'' But he did not say why he or other members of the administration had not done so yet, given two years of slow disintegration in a nation that is a major supplier of oil to world markets and sits astride vital sea lanes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's comments about Mr. Castro reflected both seven years of White House frustration in dealing with Cuba and election-year politics at a time that Florida's 25 electoral votes are being desperately fought over by the two candidates.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton had hoped, early in his presidency, gradually to lift 40-year-old sanctions against Cuba. Those hopes were dashed when four Cuban American activists from Miami flying near the Cuban coast were shot down in 1996. Congress is now considering legislation that would slightly ease sanctions, allowing the sale of medicine and food. But even if passed into law, the action would be largely symbolic, because a ban on loans and hard-currency transactions would remain in place.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore also had harsh words for Mr. Putin, saying that ''I'm very troubled by his apparent backtracking'' on the advances in press freedom, and on ''his conduct in Chechnya.'' But he said he would not favor withholding American aid as a lever to change Russia's actions, noting that most of the money goes toward dismantling Russia's nuclear arsenal. Nevertheless, he added, ''there is all kinds of leverage'' in Washington's other dealings with Moscow.</p>
