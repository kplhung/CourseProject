        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>George W. Bush singled out a school in Texas during the debate. He referred to the KIP Academy and said that it was for ''at risk'' children and that at-risk ''means basically they can't learn'' (transcript, Oct. 4). In fact, ''at risk'' generally means children who have learning impediments that are due to physical, emotional, socioeconomic or cultural factors.</p>

In fact, ''at risk'' generally means children who have learning impediments that are due to physical, emotional, socioeconomic or cultural factors.</p>
        <p>Yet even when a learning disability is diagnosed, it does not mean that a child can't learn. One study has shown that one-third of at-risk children grow into competent adults who are able to sustain employment and relationships.</p>
        <p>There are millions of children with this label. The effect of this ignorant statement on the confidence and health of such children cannot be positive. Surely, the children of the KIP Academy would like to know they can learn.</p>
