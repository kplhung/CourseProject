        <p>The inspector general of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said yesterday that several subway lines were ''potentially in danger of experiencing a train collision, derailment or serious delays'' because supervisors failed to make hundreds of inspections of signal equipment.</p>
        <p>An investigation started last year by the inspector general, Roland M. Malan, after an anonymous tip, found that during 1999 as many as 358 pieces of signal equipment did not undergo an annual inspection that looks for wiring problems.</p>
        <p>The city began the inspections after a 1989 accident in which a crowded Broadway-local train slammed into a cash-and-token train parked in a station on the Upper West Side. Both trains derailed, and more than 50 people were injured.</p>
        <p>The National Transportation Safety Board determined that the probable cause of that accident was wiring problems near the station that caused a signal to malfunction. This allowed the train to enter the station without its automatic brakes being activated.</p>
        <p>New York City Transit officials said yesterday that they strongly disagreed with the findings and conclusions of the inspector general's report, which also said it appeared that signal maintenance supervisors had falsified records to make it look as if they had performed various kinds of inspections when they had not.</p>
        <p>Albert W. O'Leary, the chief spokesman for New York City Transit, said that agency officials firmly believed that passengers' safety was not put into jeopardy by any failure to perform signal inspections, many of which are first performed by signal maintenance crews and then double-checked by supervisors.</p>
        <p>Mr. O'Leary said the 507 reports that were identified by the inspector general as having been falsified represented only 1.3 percent of the signal inspection data recorded during 1999. Transit officials said they believed the mistakes in the reports could have been honest ones.</p>
        <p>''We don't believe there was any attempt at fraud,'' Mr. O'Leary said.</p>
        <p>The investigation found, however, that in many cases supervisors were on vacation or off work on days when transit records showed they had made dozens of inspections. The report added that 53 percent of the signal equipment on the A, B, C, D, E, F and G lines throughout the city and the R line in Brooklyn was overdue for backup visual inspections by supervisors at the end of 1999.</p>
        <p>The report added that the backup supervisory inspections were important because regular signal maintenance crews did not have the knowledge, experience or expertise of supervisors.</p>
        <p>About the wiring inspections, special checks only supervisors are allowed to perform, Mr. O'Leary said the agency considered those inspections redundant because they are designed only to ensure that wiring repairs are done properly. The agency already requires supervisors to inspect repairs as they are made. ''Unless somebody touches it, you can't have a problem with it,'' Mr. O'Leary said of the signal wiring.</p>
        <p>After investigators recently alerted New York City Transit of the possibility that none of the wiring inspections had been done in 1999, Lawrence G. Reuter, the transit president, did order that those inspections be made on all the equipment. The inspections were completed last month, with no problems found. But Mr. O'Leary added that the agency was looking into whether the inspections are unnecessary and should no longer be required.</p>
        <p>In the report, the inspector general recommended that the wiring inspections not only should be kept, but also should be given higher priority. Asked to comment yesterday on the transit agency's response to the report, officials from the inspector general's office said only that they stood by their findings.</p>
