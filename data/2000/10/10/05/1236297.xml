        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I've been a WordPerfect user for more than 10 years now. I have yet to want to do something that it can't do. WordPerfect has always been a bargain in comparison to Word. Does  Microsoft really expect people to believe that Word is five times as good as WordPerfect? I hope that Corel will keep producing WordPerfect. Choice is good.</p>
