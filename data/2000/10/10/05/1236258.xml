        <p>The day after Gov. George W. Bush said he thought he would have no authority as president to overturn the Food and Drug Administration's approval of the abortion pill, two anti-abortion lawmakers today introduced legislation restricting access to it.</p>
        <p>The bill proposed by the legislators, Senator Tim Hutchinson of Arkansas and Representative Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, both Republicans,  would make law several conditions that the F.D.A. had reportedly considered but did not impose last Thursday when it approved the drug, RU-486, or mifepristone, for marketing.</p>
        <p>The measure would require prescribing physicians to know how to handle complications of an abortion. It would mandate that the doctors know how to read sonograms, know how to perform surgical abortions and maintain admitting privileges at a hospital no more than an hour from their offices.</p>
        <p>The sponsors' stated purpose is to protect the health and safety of any woman who takes RU-486; one of the authors, Dr. Coburn, is himself a physician, a family practitioner who by his count has delivered 3,500 babies.</p>
        <p>But the net effect of the requirement that the prescribing physician be able to perform a surgical abortion might be to limit access to the drug largely to abortion clinics.</p>
        <p>That would eliminate what abortion rights advocates see as its main advantage: that it moves abortion away from clinics, where patients have often been confronted by demonstrators, into the privacy of doctors' offices.</p>
        <p>The bill coincides with another political question about the future of the drug: whether as president Mr. Bush, who opposes abortion, could force the F.D.A. to reverse its decision. The answer, experts say, is that while his doing so might be theoretically possible, it would be highly unlikely.</p>
        <p>To begin with, a president cannot unilaterally order a drug withdrawn from the market; that authority rests with the secretary of health and human services, who delegates it to the commissioner of food and drugs.</p>
        <p>Typically, the F.D.A. reconsiders a drug's approval only when new evidence emerges showing that it is  unsafe or ineffective. Peter Barton Hutt, former general counsel of the agency, said federal law did not permit it to take ''cost-benefit, political or social'' factors into account.</p>
        <p>Still, the president can ask the F.D.A. to reconsider approval. In an interview last week, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, Ray Sullivan, said that if elected, the governor would order a ''careful review'' of the decision. But in the presidential debate on Tuesday night, Mr. Bush said only that he would ''make sure that women would be safe who used the drug.''</p>
        <p>''I am pro-life,'' he said, adding, however, that ''I don't think a president can unilaterally overturn'' an F.D.A. decision.</p>
        <p>So, much will depend on what Congress does. The likelihood that legislation will be passed this year is remote; this Congress is to adjourn soon, possibly by the end of next week. And Dr. Coburn will not return to Washington next year, having decided against seeking re-election.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, Mr. Hutchinson said, introducing the bill today ''keeps the debate focused and lays some groundwork for what I hope we can accomplish next year.''</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the Bush campaign said the governor had not taken a position on the bill.</p>
