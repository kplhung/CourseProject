        <p>THE first computer system that I bought for my personal use came with 8 megabytes of RAM and took up a sizable portion of the available space atop the cheap kick-together Swedish desk I had at the time. It was 1994, and I thought I was living large.</p>
        <p>But to live large these days, you have to go small.

        <p>THE first computer system that I bought for my personal use came with 8 megabytes of RAM and took up a sizable portion of the available space atop the cheap kick-together Swedish desk I had at the time. It was 1994, and I thought I was living large.</p>
        <p>But to live large these days, you have to go small. As I write this, I have in my (nontyping) hand a silver computer with a bright color L.C.D. screen, a built-in voice recorder, an infrared beaming port and 32 megabytes of RAM. Made by Compaq Computer, this particular device is called the iPAQ H3650 and it costs about $500.</p>
        <p>The iPAQ H3650 is one of a new line of consumer-oriented handheld computers called a PocketPC. The devices run the PocketPC operating system, which is built upon Version 3.0 of the Microsoft Windows CE operating system.</p>
        <p>Packed with features and designed with the mobile professional in mind, PocketPC is both an apt name and a description; it is pretty much like toting around a multimedia PC that has been squished down to pocket-size. Smaller than an airport paperback (and easier to disguise during a less-than-riveting staff meeting), it makes even a subnotebook seem like Godzilla.</p>
        <p>Other manufacturers have also jumped into the PocketPC arena. Hewlett-Packard sells its Jornada 540 series (with 16 to 32 megabytes of RAM) with a list price starting at $499, and Casio offers the Cassiopeia EM-500 (with 16 megabytes of RAM and a choice of colors) for about $500.</p>
        <p>The devices all come with fast processors, shortcut buttons and U.S.B. (Universal System Bus) connections to the PC. The Jornada and Cassiopeia models have expansion slots for users to add memory cards and snap-on accessories like digital cameras, modems and external keyboards; iPAQ users will need to purchase an expansion pack to add cards and additional equipment. Along with software for synchronizing data with the desktop computer, the new PocketPC's come with improved smaller versions of popular Microsoft programs like Word, Excel, Internet Explorer and Microsoft Money.</p>
        <p>Although limited to basic tasks, the smaller pocket versions of the programs are similar to the full-scale editions. And the color graphics make the programs, particularly the miniature copy of Internet Explorer, much easier to use. (Fresh Web content can be downloaded to a PocketPC from a desktop computer during synchronization by using Internet Explorer 5 on the desktop to create Mobile Favorites.) Included are  an e-mail program and organizer applications like a calendar, to-do list and contact database.</p>
        <p>For those who prefer entertainment to work while in transit, there is a Windows Media Player version that can also play files in the MP3 format, as well as the Microsoft Reader program, which uses the company's heralded Clear Type technology to make reading the screen easier on the eyes.</p>
        <p>The boom in tiny electronic devices that you can carry around, use to keep track of your life and then synchronize with your desktop computer arguably began in 1996, when U.S. Robotics released the Pilot. (U.S. Robotics was bought by 3Com, which spun off the division into Palm Inc.)</p>
        <p>Other palmtop organizers at the time, like the Psion series and the Wizard by Sharp Electronics, also offered the harried road warrior a place to record daily data, but it was the Pilot -- small, fast  and easy to integrate with a desktop PC -- that quickly won over the masses. As one might postulate from the Web browser wars between Netscape and Microsoft, however, if there is money to be made in an area of computing, Microsoft is bound to turn up somewhere.</p>
        <p>In the summer of 1998, the company's first handheld computers hit the market. The devices, made by different manufacturers, ran an earlier version of Windows CE. That name was sometimes shortened to WinCE and pronounced ''wince'' by wags and users who found its miniature version of Windows to be clunky and cumbersome on a P.D.A.</p>
        <p>''Who needs a giant Start menu and cascading submenus on a device with a three-inch-wide screen?'' was a popular question. ''Why is this system so slow compared with the Palm OS?'' was another.</p>
        <p>So you can evaluate the iPAQ or any of its competitors, you should know whether the new PocketPC operating system, released by Microsoft in April, is any improvement over earlier flavors of Windows CE. Surprisingly, at least to this Palm user, it is.</p>
        <p>''The key difference is that we simplified the interface,'' said Ed Suwanjindar, a product manager with Microsoft's mobile devices division. ''In the past, we had tried to take the Windows experience and cram it into a portable device, and the feedback that we heard overwhelmingly from customers, and the press, was that that was just not the right way to do things.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Suwanjindar mentioned the system's Today screen, which is a centralized area that shows a thumbnail view of the user's day with regard to pending appointments, tasks and messages. The Start menu has moved to the top of the screen and has been simplified as well, and the current active program is shown on the screen.</p>
        <p>''In this release,'' Mr. Suwanjindar said, ''we have flattened out the user interface. There are no more 3-D dialogue boxes. No more cascading menus.'' Space-hogging menu options and icons have also been eliminated so the user can use more of the limited screen space.</p>
        <p>After sampling both the iPAQ and the Cassiopeia EM-500 for a few days, I found the improvements both welcome and very apparent. The PocketPC system that comes on both devices is much more user-friendly, not to mention much zippier.</p>
        <p>Toting all that RAM around must help. (Palm's high-end models all have only 8 megabytes of memory installed.) The PocketPC's respond quicker than the previous generation of Windows CE devices, and a user can now tap once and hold the stylus on the screen to call up a menu of options when changing appointments and tasks, instead of jumping to a menu bar and using multiple taps.</p>
        <p>The sleek silver iPAQ, which is back-ordered in many stores, has rounded edges and a firm feel to its metallic case. With its big round navigation wheel and spring-loaded stylus, it's a little more up-to-date in the industrial design department than the more traditional-looking Cassiopeia EM-500, which comes in silver and five colors of plastic: green, yellow, sky blue, a darker blue and red.</p>
        <p>The Cassiopeia screen, though, can display more than 65,000 colors, compared with 4,096 colors on the iPAQ.</p>
        <p>The Microsoft Reader program that is shipped with both PocketPC devices comes with two fairy tales by Hans Christian Andersen for the user to start with before installing new e-books from around the Web, and the Clear Type technology looks especially handsome on the Cassiopeia.</p>
        <p>The color screens drain a lot of battery power, compared with the power needed by P.D.A.'s with monochrome screens, and the PocketPC's are equipped with rechargeable lithium ion batteries. The Cassiopeia even comes with a backup battery installed, and the company says that the EM-500 can get up to 6 hours of battery life between charges, but that amount will vary with the types of functions used and the screen brightness. Compaq estimates that the iPAQ can last up to 12 hours between charges, but that also varies.</p>
        <p>Deciding whether one should use a PocketPC handheld or one of the many devices running the Palm OS is strictly a personal decision that should be based in part -- as with any computer consideration -- on what you intend to do with the thing. The $500 price tag on a PocketPC may put it out of the range for the user who doesn't want a lot of bells and whistles.</p>
        <p>The PocketPC devices are gorgeous, however, and this third-generation operating system on them has improved dramatically. Perhaps the third time is the charm.</p>
