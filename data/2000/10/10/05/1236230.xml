        <p>After a three-year investigation into the multibillion-dollar auction business, Diana D. Brooks, the former president and chief executive of Sotheby's, has agreed to plead guilty today to conspiring to violate antitrust laws in collusion with Sotheby's archrival, Christie's, people close to Ms. Brooks and the government said yesterday.</p>

        <p>After a three-year investigation into the multibillion-dollar auction business, Diana D. Brooks, the former president and chief executive of Sotheby's, has agreed to plead guilty today to conspiring to violate antitrust laws in collusion with Sotheby's archrival, Christie's, people close to Ms. Brooks and the government said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The felony plea would leave Ms. Brooks, 50, once seen as the most powerful woman in the art world, facing a possible three-year federal prison sentence and a large fine.</p>
        <p>The hard-fought deal with the Justice Department sets the stage for a high-stakes courtroom drama, turning Ms. Brooks into a witness against her longtime boss, Sotheby's former chairman, A. Alfred Taubman, 75, the multimillionaire Detroit shopping center developer, people involved in the case said. Both resigned under fire in February.</p>
        <p>In a related deal revealed yesterday, Sotheby's also agreed to plead guilty today to violations of antitrust law and pay a fine of $45 million --  above a huge settlement two weeks ago in a civil case stemming from the same investigation.</p>
        <p>People involved in the case confirmed the plea agreements after the case was listed on the federal court calendar for today.</p>
        <p>The investigation centered on the issue of whether Sotheby's colluded with Christie's in a host of business practices, including fixing fees and commissions charged at auctions. In January, Christie's turned over documents and other evidence to the Justice Department, winning amnesty by, in effect, admitting collusion.</p>
        <p>Ever since, the case has transfixed the rarefied, gossipy and money-driven worlds of art and auction, where every year $4 billion of art and antiques flow through the two houses.</p>
        <p>As part of her agreement with the Justice Department, Ms. Brooks will provide details about the fixing of fees and other practices that may have stifled competition going back at least eight years. In particular, she will be asked to provide information under oath about Mr. Taubman.</p>
        <p>John Scanlon, a spokesman for Mr. Taubman, declined to comment. Mr. Taubman, who bought Sotheby's in 1983, has previously denied wrongdoing. Ralph T. Giordano, chief of the federal antitrust office in New York, also declined to comment.</p>
        <p>Stephen E. Kaufman, a lawyer for Ms. Brooks, said the case was on the calendar for today but declined to discuss the proceeding. A lawyer involved in the case said that under the arrangement, Ms. Brooks would waive indictment and admit to a single count in what is called an information -- tantamount to an indictment -- that is devised for the plea. Ms. Brooks will have to tell a judge in her own words what crime she committed and is now admitting to.</p>
        <p>In Sotheby's coordinated but separate plea, the fine of $45 million will be spread out over five years, people close to the case said.</p>
        <p>This fine comes on top of a $256 million payment Sotheby's agreed to pay to auction buyers and sellers last month in a settlement of a civil class-action lawsuit. Christie's also agreed to pay $256 million to customers but faces no federal criminal charges because it came forward first with evidence of collusion and won conditional amnesty.</p>
        <p>Ms. Brooks's plea, aimed at building a full-blown prosecution of Mr. Taubman, whose fortune is put at more than $700 million, caps weeks of intensive talks between lawyers for Ms. Brooks and prosecutors for the Justice Department, people involved in the case said.</p>
        <p>Matthew Weigman, a spokesman for Sotheby's, declined to comment on any aspect of the case.</p>
        <p>The pleading before a federal judge, who will be selected by lottery, is set to take place at the Pearl Street courthouse in Manhattan after an appearance before a magistrate at 10 a.m. The judge could take the plea then and there but could reschedule it for the next day or another time.</p>
        <p>Whether Ms. Brooks will serve time in prison will not be decided until her sentencing after her cooperation with the government. Her lawyers had sought a commitment from the Justice Department that it would ask the sentencing judge to spare her prison. But no agreement was reached, people close to the case said.</p>
        <p>The offense she is set to plead guilty to, a violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act's prohibition against conspiracies in restraint of trade, also gives the judge discretion in levying the fine. He could, in theory, choose the higher of three amounts: $350,000; or the illicit financial gain to her; or twice the loss by victims. Since the settlement in the civil case acknowledged claims of close to $500 million (less unspecified legal fees) a doubling of losses could technically mean a fine of close to $1 billion.</p>
        <p>Ms. Brooks and her husband, Michael, a venture capitalist, have homes in Manhattan, Long Island and Florida, and have been financial benefactors of their alma mater, Yale. But their wealth has never been equated with that of Mr. Taubman and other superrich collectors. Her last salary at Sotheby's was $600,000 a year, which came to more than $1 million with bonuses.</p>
        <p>The inquiry that led to today's pleas was based in large part on documents provided by a former chief executive of Christie's, Christopher M. Davidge, who resigned on Christmas Eve. As part of a $7.5 million departure settlement he got from Christie's, Mr. Davidge turned over to Christie's lawyers more than 100 pages of notes and other records said to document meetings and conversations he had with the chairman of Christie's, Sir Anthony Tennant, and counterparts at Sotheby's, Ms. Brooks and Mr. Taubman.</p>
        <p>Christie's will receive conditional amnesty from prosecution as long as it continues to cooperate.</p>
        <p>The Davidge documents, which were given to the lead lawyers, Boies, Schiller &amp; Flexner, in the civil class-action antitrust case as part of the recently concluded settlement discussions, were put under seal by Judge Lewis A. Kaplan of Federal District Court in Manhattan, who is presiding over the civil case. But the documents would presumably be presented as evidence in any trial of Mr. Taubman or other defendants.</p>
        <p>Mr. Davidge could be called upon to testify; his financial settlement with Christie's and his amnesty from prosecution require him to cooperate with the investigation. Ms. Brooks is also likely to be called to testify about the documents.</p>
        <p>Sir Anthony, who is based in England, has refused to comment as has his lawyer, Richard Taylor. People close to the case said it was doubtful that he could be extradited to the United States were he to be charged.</p>
        <p>Mr. Taubman, clearly the target of the government's move to turn Ms. Brooks into a prosecution witness, has already incurred major financial losses. Of the $512 million civil settlement that Sotheby's and Christie's recently agreed to pay auction customers, in equal shares of $256 million, Mr. Taubman agreed to pay $156 million of Sotheby's portion. He also agreed to pay $30 million to settle a suit by Sotheby's stockholders who argued that their holdings were devalued by the company's wrongdoing. In return, Sotheby's agreed not to seek other financial redress from Mr. Taubman.</p>
        <p>Of the remaining $100 million that Sotheby's must pay under the civil settlement, $50 million can be in the form of coupons to future sellers, so the company need only come up with $50 million cash. Christie's, which is privately held, must come up with the entire $256 million.</p>
