        <p>Bob Herbert Op-Ed column holds Vice Pres Al Gore easily won presidential debate if judged by which candidate was better prepared, more knowledgeable, had greater command of facts and grasp of issues; sees him hurt by inability to keep supercilliousness in check; sees Gov George W Bush aided by his more conversational tone, but by little else (M)</p>

        <p>If he can somehow force himself to stop sighing and interrupting and behaving condescendingly in front of the television cameras, Al Gore may yet get elected president.</p>
        <p>Most of America understands that the competence bar is set so low for Gov. George W. Bush of Texas that it's practically lying on the ground. It was pretty much acknowledged going into the debate that as long as he didn't misspell potato or mispronounce some three-syllable word or misstate the name of a world leader, he would be judged to have done O.K.</p>
        <p>Woody Allen is supposed to have said that 80 percent of success is just showing up. That was proved Tuesday night. Governor Bush showed up -- albeit reluctantly -- at the Clark Athletic Center at the University of Massachusetts. And he did fine.</p>
        <p>That is, if you didn't bother to look at the content of the debate.</p>
        <p>If you paid attention to the content, and used it as a gauge to determine which candidate was better prepared, was more knowledgeable, had a greater command of the facts and grasp of the issues, then Vice President Gore won easily.</p>
        <p>He asserted, for example, that Governor Bush ''would spend more money on tax cuts for the wealthiest 1 percent than all of the new spending that he proposes for education, health care, prescription drugs and national defense all combined.''</p>
        <p>That happens to be true. And Mr. Bush never attempted to explain why this peculiar configuration of priorities -- this re-direction of national resources from the bottom and the middle to the top -- is a good idea.</p>
        <p>The vice president clobbered Mr. Bush on the issue of prescription drugs for the elderly. And he scored well, I thought, when discussing potential appointments to the Supreme Court, saying, ''Governor Bush has declared to the anti-choice groups that he will appoint justices in the mold of [Antonin] Scalia and Clarence Thomas, who are known for being the most vigorous opponents of a woman's right to choose.''</p>
        <p>But Vice President Gore never wins easily. He may have the experience and most of the issues on his side, but he can't keep his superciliousness in check. He just can't do it. So there he was on Tuesday night sighing loudly with disdain, or smiling contemptuously, or smugly, as Governor Bush did the best he could with this answer or that.</p>
        <p>Earth to Al Gore: This turns people off.</p>
        <p>There's an old saying: You don't shoot a man who's committing suicide. There were times during the debate when Governor Bush seemed not to understand the finer points of his own tax cut and Social Security proposals. And he seemed lost on matters of foreign policy. It would have been quite sufficient for Mr. Gore to give his own views on these matters and to correct any misstatements by his opponent.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Gore seems to feel the need to pour it on -- to offer not just his answer to a given question, but to show us everything he knows about the topic. He doesn't seem to realize that in the real world, people hate Eddie Haskell.</p>
        <p>At one point during the debate the moderator, Jim Lehrer, said to the vice president: ''I've got an idea. If you have any more to say about this, you can say it in your closing statement. We'll move on, O.K.?''</p>
        <p>The vice president's boorishness gets in the way of his message and almost certainly pushes some voters into a more favorable view of Mr. Bush, who benefits from a more conversational tone and the demeanor of an ordinary guy.</p>
        <p>The bad news for Bush supporters is that there are not many other reasons for undecided voters to shift to their man. Mr. Gore has got a good thing going with, among other things, his health care issues, his strong defense of a woman's right to choose, and the continued strong economy.</p>
        <p>Republican campaign operatives are very worried. Key swing states are moving toward the vice president. Some crucial states for the G.O.P. -- Florida and Ohio -- remain up for grabs. And despite Tuesday's debate, the belief that Mr. Bush may not be up to the rigors of the presidency is widespread and in danger of becoming entrenched.</p>
        <p>Issues count in a presidential election, but so does style. Mr. Gore, as he closes in on his dream of winning the White House, might consider tempering his fighting style with a touch of modesty and grace.</p>
