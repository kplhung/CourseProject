        <p>A creatively focused Los Angeles agency is opening in New York with ambitious plans for the new outpost to someday be much larger than the home office.</p>
        <p>The agency is Ground Zero, a six-year-old shop in Marina del Rey that handles accounts with billings estimated at $95 million to $100 million for clients like the Atlantis resort in the Bahamas, part of Sun International; the ESPN cable network owned by the Walt Disney Company; Gloss.com, part of Estee Lauder; iXL Enterprises, an Internet consultant; and The Los Angeles Times, owned by the Tribune Company.</p>

        <p>A creatively focused Los Angeles agency is opening in New York with ambitious plans for the new outpost to someday be much larger than the home office.</p>
        <p>The agency is Ground Zero, a six-year-old shop in Marina del Rey that handles accounts with billings estimated at $95 million to $100 million for clients like the Atlantis resort in the Bahamas, part of Sun International; the ESPN cable network owned by the Walt Disney Company; Gloss.com, part of Estee Lauder; iXL Enterprises, an Internet consultant; and The Los Angeles Times, owned by the Tribune Company.</p>
        <p>Ground Zero is one of several agencies founded in the last decade on the West Coast that have burnished the region's reputation as a hotbed of advertising creativity. Its best-known work includes a campaign for the Bijan cologne named after Michael Jordan that was centered on his silhouette and a campaign for the Virgin Group to introduce Virgin Cola to Americans that was centered on consumers ranting on soapboxes.</p>
        <p>The most recent big new account for Ground Zero came in late August, when the agency signed a five-year contract -- with estimated total billings of $125 million -- to create anti-smoking campaigns for the California Health Services Department.</p>
        <p>The New York office of Ground Zero is the agency's first such foray outside its headquarters. It is being headed by Andrew Gledhill, a management executive transplanted from the West Coast, and Tyler Whisnand, a creative executive who has worked in Hong Kong, Italy and the Netherlands.</p>
        <p>The eastward expansion by Ground Zero is indicative of the increasing decentralization of the agency industry as shops spread out to seek greater growth opportunities. As West Coast agencies open on the East Coast, East Coast agencies are opening on the West Coast. And agencies on neither coast, i.e. agencies based in London, are expanding to America.</p>
        <p>''This is all about the clients we don't have rather than the clients we do have,'' said Jim Smith, 47, chairman at Ground Zero.</p>
        <p>''In some reasonable period of time, certainly in five years, the New York office should be twice as big as the L.A. office,'' he added, ''and maybe sooner than that, because of the substantially bigger client base.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Smith was among five executives who outlined the agency's plans in an interview yesterday in Midtown Manhattan. In addition to Mr. Gledhill and Mr. Whisnand, Mr. Smith was accompanied by the creative partners with whom he founded Ground Zero: Court Crandall, 35, and Kirk Souder, 38.</p>
        <p>''This is not just about being in the largest advertising market,'' said Mr. Whisnand, 32, who is being named the first creative partner at the New York office. ''It's about being in the largest business market.''</p>
        <p>New York is ''where brands and companies are born and made,'' he added. ''It makes sense to be near that energy.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Whisnand is joining Ground Zero after stints at Colors magazine, published by the Italian apparel retailer Benetton; Kessels Kramer, an agency in Amsterdam; and the Hong Kong office of BBDO Worldwide, part of the Omnicom Group. He will run the New York office along with Mr. Gledhill, 42, who continues as president of Ground Zero.</p>
        <p>''By opening up here, we are recognizing an existing reality,'' Mr. Gledhill said, ''that we're a national agency with clients in Portland, San Francisco, Atlanta, Fort Lauderdale, New York and California that required people to come to us through Marina del Rey.</p>
        <p>''Coming here, there's not only a bigger client pool,'' he added, ''but a bigger talent pool.''</p>
        <p>In opening a second front on the East Coast, Ground Zero joins a long list of agencies like Chiat/Day, now the TBWA/Chiat/Day unit of TBWA, part of Omnicom; Fallon Worldwide, now owned by the Publicis Groupe S.A.; Hal Riney &amp; Partners, now the Publicis &amp; Hal Riney unit of Publicis; and Wieden &amp; Kennedy.</p>
        <p>In some instances, success came only after bumpy early days. For some, the jury is still out. And for others, the efforts ultimately failed.</p>
        <p>''The people who have done really well'' in opening additional offices ''have integrated their culture, their business philosophy, really well,'' Mr. Smith said.</p>
        <p>''Something we always talk about is how we have to avoid the New York office seeming simply an offshoot,'' he added, ''and figure out how to have it feel like Ground Zero.</p>
        <p>''And it's a bit pompous to assume everyone will beat a path to our door in a time frame that suits us,'' Mr. Smith said. ''We're trying to arrive here with a little humility.''</p>
        <p>The Ground Zero New York office will pitch in on accounts handled from Marina del Rey as it courts its own accounts in categories that include autos, beverages, financial services, high technology, packaged goods and travel.</p>
        <p>The goal, Mr. Souder said, is to introduce East Coast clients to the Ground Zero philosophy that ''if you dig into a brand and find what's at the core of it, there's a soul, something deeper than how it ends up as a product on your table.''</p>
        <p>And, as Mr. Smith chimed in, ''there seems like an awful lot of brands here whose souls are not being terribly well celebrated.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps the Ground Zero executives could update that quintessential New York musical, ''Guys and Dolls,'' in which shy Sister Sarah Brown saved the soul of the suave Gotham gambler Sky Masterson. Anyone for a stirring chorus of ''If I Were a Bell Atlantic, Now Verizon, I'd Be Ringing''?</p>
