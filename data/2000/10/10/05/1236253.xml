        <p>In a decision that seems designed to buy time for President Slobodan Milosevic, Yugoslavia's highest court tonight annulled parts of the Sept. 24 presidential elections, according to the official news agency, Tanjug.</p>
        <p>The decision, which was described only briefly tonight and will be released on Thursday, is likely to require a repeat of the first round with the same five candidates. It means that there will be no second-round runoff on Sunday between Mr. Milosevic and his main challenger, Vojislav Kostunica, and that the current tussle between Serbia's ruler and his opposition could drag on.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kostunica immediately called the decision ''a trap'' and said it showed that Mr. Milosevic ''is weaker than ever.'' But Mr. Kostunica, a constitutional lawyer, said he wanted to see the entire decision before commenting further.</p>
        <p>Goran Svilanovic, a party leader in Mr. Kostunica's coalition, said a repeat of the first round is unacceptable to him, but the decision would have to be Mr. Kostunica's to make.</p>
        <p>''Milosevic is offering us everything to get us off the street,'' Mr. Svilanovic said. ''He wants to buy time and stay president until July,'' when his current term was originally  to expire, Mr. Svilanovic said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kostunica and his coalition say he won the first round outright, with 51.4 percent, and that Mr. Milosevic and his Federal Election Commission stole and manipulated votes to bring Mr. Kostunica under 50 percent and require a runoff, which had been scheduled for Sunday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kostunica has vowed that he would defend his victory without a runoff, and the opposition has called a rally for Thursday in Belgrade, the climax of a rolling general strike to push Mr. Milosevic out of power.</p>
        <p>In an open letter to Mr. Milosevic earlier today, Mr. Kostunica said ''it will be better for you to recognize'' defeat or risk ''the danger of open clashes'' throughout Serbia.</p>
        <p>The timing of the decision from the constitutional court -- on the eve of the rally and just after Serbian police broke and failed to clear strikers from a key coal mine -- is no accident, Mr. Svilanovic said.</p>
        <p>The court will present the opposition with yet another set of choices: to accept a new first round under the same unfair conditions and with the same potential for vote fraud; to reject the court order and try to overthrow Mr. Milosevic through street pressure; or to continue to try to get international mediators to ensure a fair recount of the first round. But the debate over whether to participate in Sunday's second round has suddenly become moot.</p>
        <p>Today, much of Belgrade came to a halt when thousands of students marched and blocked traffic. The state communications agency went on strike. Many stores were shut and garbage went uncollected. Elsewhere in the country, major roads and railways were blocked and opposition-run cities were at a near standstill.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kostunica and the coalition brought the case to the constitutional court intending to prove fraud in the counting of the votes by the Federal Electoral Commission and to get a recount. They did not challenge the voting process itself.</p>
        <p>But the court, according to the official news agency, also invalidated the voting, which would seem to mean a first-round repeat.</p>
        <p>It is not clear if Mr. Kostunica would accept a repeat, or when it would be. Some experts tonight said that Mr. Milosevic may want first to swear in the newly elected federal Parliament -- which he and his allies control -- and have it set a new date, enabling him to remain president until the summer; others said the court decision is likely to name a new date.</p>
        <p>In his 13 years of ruling Serbia, Mr. Milosevic has proven a master at using legal wrangles to maneuver himself out of difficulties, to buy time and to exhaust his opponents.</p>
        <p>The key sentence in the Tanjug report said only: ''The Federal Constitutional Court has unanimously decided to annul the part of the electoral process for the President of Yugoslavia relating to voting, determining and announcing the results of the vote.''</p>
        <p>State television tonight said that the court was writing the decision overnight and that ''the public would be fully informed about all the details of the decision tomorrow.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kostunica's representative on the Federal Electoral Commission, Nebojsa Bakarec, said tonight: ''Until I get the decision it's hard to comment. But it seems they have annulled everything that happened on the 24th. This is something we didn't ask for. We just asked the court to annul the decision about the final results.''</p>
        <p>Another opposition member of the commission, Dragor Hiber, said: ''This decision could mean the annulment of the first round of elections, of the elections in Kosovo, or the sending of documents back to the Federal Electoral Commission for a recount.'' But the court should also name a date for new voting, he said.</p>
        <p>Zoran Djindjic, who has led the opposition campaign, said the court decision was ''the height of cynicism and yet another fraud.''</p>
        <p>He said: ''Milosevic had first wanted to announce his own victory, and when he saw that wouldn't work, he announced he was in the lead in the first round, and then that Kostunica was in the lead, but that there will be a runoff vote. After that he wanted to introduce a state of emergency, and when he saw this wouldn't work either and that he was finished, he annulled the elections through the Constitutional Court.''</p>
        <p>The court did not annul the elections -- also held on Sept. 24 -- for federal Parliament, which Mr. Milosevic and his allies won, or the local elections, which strengthened opposition control of many key Serbian cities and towns.</p>
