        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re one letter that commented on the column about WordPerfect: The letter writer was correct, strictly speaking, in pointing out that the format of documents created in Adobe Acrobat is PDF, not Adobe Acrobat, because the latter is an application. The letter writer does split hairs, though: He should also have noted that Microsoft Word and Corel WordPerfect are both applications, not formats; they are each capable of saving files in many different formats. Similarly, HTML is a language, not a format. We often use shorthand to describe the formats of the documents created in certain applications or languages. Many graphics professionals refer to the Acrobat format, rather than the PDF format. I think that usage is the key, not strict interpretation.</p>
