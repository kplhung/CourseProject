        <p>Because he surprised the undecideds by fighting his more experienced debate opponent to a draw, George W. Bush won Round One.</p>
        <p>To those few of us who are human-rights interventionists, Al Gore was not only more sure-footed in demeanor but more sensible about the need for the U.S. to apply pressure to remove Slobodan Milosevic after the Yugoslav election. Whichever of Bush's policy advisers suggested that we turn to Russia's Vladimir Putin as a mediator did the G.O.P. candidate a disservice. Gore, who should be on the defensive about his trust-Russia record, deftly took advantage of the opening.</p>
        <p>Contrariwise, Bush belted Gore all over the ring on accountability in  education. The Texas governor was both well versed and passionate; his sincerity was in contrast to the vice president's cornball use of a letter from a Florida parent complaining that a daughter had no desk to sit at  in class. (A local radio reporter then found out that the Sarasota classroom was crowded that day because $100,000 in new lab equipment had just been moved in. Live by folksy anecdotes, die by folksy anecdotes.)</p>
        <p>Gore again put on display his compulsion to exaggerate. Republicans call it ''the flaming whopper'': after Bush complimented the Federal Emergency Management Agency for its response to fires raging in Texas in 1998, Gore blurted, ''I accompanied [FEMA Director] James Lee Witt down to Texas when those fires broke out.'' Not true; Gore went without Witt, said a few words about the fires at the Houston airport, and continued on to a trial lawyer's fund-raiser, one of those events he likes to call ''donor-related community outreach.''</p>
        <p>Abortion should have been Gore's strongest suit, but Bush put him on the defensive by raising its most extreme form. Gore responded, ''On the issue of partial birth or so-called late-term abortion'' (he meant to say ''late-term or so-called partial birth abortion''), ''I would sign a law banning that procedure, provided that doctors have the ability to save a woman's life or to act if her health is severely at risk.''</p>
        <p>Note that insertion of severely. The loophole that pro-choicers want is ''health,'' which would allow a woman late in pregnancy to say that birth would cause her stress. By adding ''severely,'' Gore may upset some of his absolutist followers, but he shrewdly moves closer to the majority of voters who disapprove of the late-term procedure.</p>
        <p>An unremarked zinger was Bush's ''I don't know where the vice president stands'' on tearing down hydroelectric dams in the Northwest, as fish-protectors want and job-protectors oppose. Gore ignored that and continues to straddle, but the heat is now on for him to decide, which will cost him crucial votes in the swing states of Washington and Oregon.</p>
        <p>Bush missed a chance to counterpunch when Gore, with his lifelong pipeline to Occidental Petroleum, went into his populist riff blaming ''the big oil companies'' for oil prices. Bush failed to nail Gore for his election-time flip-flop on dipping into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.</p>
        <p>But here I am scoring the debate on debating points when the political impact of the contest is on general impression.</p>
        <p>Gore programmed himself not to appear programmed, but the relentless robot showed through. Not thrice but 10 times on this Rialto did he repeat ''the wealthiest 1 percent,'' his rallying cry of class warfare. Bush's riposte was to point out that his across-the-board tax cuts would benefit the lower middle class more than Gore's more modest tax plan, but that appeal to the already-decideds failed to register.</p>
        <p>What did come across was a certain amiable niceness, or even gentlemanliness, in Bush's demeanor even as he imputed phoniness to Gore's numbers, lack of credibility to his character and ''totally false!'' to his attacks. Bush proved he is not the caricature drawn of him.</p>
        <p>Gore was undeniably a commanding presence, interrupting, demanding more time, reciting a series of hot-button points, to the brink of bullying both opponent and moderator (though Jim Lehrer kept equal-time discipline). That impulse to domineer probably helped the vice president with men, hurt him with women.</p>
        <p>Offstage, Gore is a serious man of parts, but the part I didn't like in this debate was his mugging as his opponent was speaking. The eye-rolling, snorting, head-shaking, moaning, derisive displays of disbelief struck me as puerile and disrespectful.</p>
        <p>In all, two men with profound differences stood toe to toe, and Bush stunned detractors by holding his own. By not losing, he ''won.'' In Rounds Two and Three, he will have to win to win.</p>
