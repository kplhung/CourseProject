        <p>If Rosa writes a letter to her grandfather, should it begin ''dere Grandpa,'' ''dear Grandpa'' or ''Dear Grandpa''?</p>
        <p>Until today, the correct answer did not matter to grade school students taking the Connecticut Mastery Test, because even though the test has asked such questions since its inception in 1986, state education officials have never counted the answers.</p>
        <p>This morning, the Connecticut Board of Education voted unanimously to make students' answers to multiple-choice questions on grammar, punctuation and spelling account for 40 percent of their overall grade in the test's writing section.</p>
        <p>Until now, the writing aptitude of fourth-, sixth- and eighth-grade students statewide has been judged solely on how well they composed a short story or an expository essay on the 45-minute writing test. The test also includes about a dozen multiple-choice questions on grammar and spelling. The state has tabulated how well each student answered those questions, and reported those results to local school districts.</p>
        <p>But those results did not count in the students' writing scores. State officials said they had felt it was more important to measure students' ability to write creatively and demonstratively than to test the mechanics of writing.</p>
        <p>''It didn't rise to the level of importance to be counted in the students' overall score,'' said the State Education Department's spokesman, Thomas Murphy. ''We think that was wrong.''</p>
        <p>Theodore S. Sergi, the state education commissioner, said the decision to make the change came after a month of disagreement among board members and other educators over testing student grammar.</p>
        <p>''I think what the board did today shows that we very much value the creative part of writing and its correctness and accuracy,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But the decision drew criticism today from several associations of language-arts teachers and child-education groups, which said the change was more in the interest of creating uniform testing standards than helping children learn to write well. They said it would make teachers focus more on drilling students in grammatical rules and less on writing ability.</p>
        <p>''I think in the long run it's going to have a negative effect on the writing that's done,'' said William McCarthy, a teacher in Darien and president of the Connecticut Council of Teachers of English. ''It will take the emphasis away from clarity, originality, organization, elaboration. There will be more time spent on the writing worksheets, and less time given in classes and on homework to writing activities.''</p>
        <p>Connecticut, where fourth-grade reading and math scores are the highest in the nation, has long been regarded as one of the most innovative states in student testing. Though most other states, including New York and New Jersey, test student writing skills and grammar with a combination of essay and multiple-choice questions, many of those tests were modeled on the Connecticut Mastery Test, said Wayne Martin, a director at the Council of Chief State School Officers in Washington, which represents state education commissioners.</p>
        <p>The Board of Education's decision today, made after a month of deliberation and discussion with those who opposed it, illuminated two different philosophies of how best to teach written-language skills.</p>
        <p>One side emphasizes the importance of teaching written clarity and creativity first, filling in grammatical shortcomings later. ''If you get kids hooked on trying to communicate what they're trying to say in a way that's clear and persuasive, the mechanics will fall into place,'' said Emily O. Wurtz, a senior associate with the National Education Goals Panel, a federal agency that monitors education testing patterns.</p>
        <p>The other side of the argument, which Commissioner Sergi used in urging today's decision, stresses the mechanics of writing as the basis for all writing skills. ''You don't see a lot of beautifully creative writing that is technically deficient,'' Mr. Sergi  said.</p>
        <p>David Agrawal, a senior at Rockville High School in Vernon and a student member of the state's Board of Education, argued today in favor of the testing change.</p>
        <p>''The one thing I keep hearing is, 'Our children are better writers than they were, but they've lost the basics in editing and other necessities,' '' Mr. Agrawal told the board. ''Maybe grammar can be boring to some students, but it's something that they need to know and something they need to be tested on.''</p>
