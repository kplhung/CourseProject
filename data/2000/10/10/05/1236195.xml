        <p>Concerned that Manhattan's biggest real estate firms had joined forces to publish their listings on the Web, a group of smaller brokerage firms unveiled its own Web site yesterday to compete head-to-head in cyberspace.</p>
        <p>The opening of the new site ratcheted up the intensity of a feud that had its origins in August, when a group of brokerage firms lead by the Corcoran Group and Douglas Elliman, the two largest residential real estate firms in Manhattan, announced plans for a multiple listing service for Manhattan properties.</p>
        <p>They invited other brokerage firms to join in, but the offer was rejected by many smaller firms, whose leaders expressed concerns that Corcoran and Elliman would own too much of the system.</p>
        <p>More than 100 of the smaller brokerage firms then formed the Manhattan MLS Joint Industry Task Force. Its members met with the Corcoran-Elliman group for weeks, trying to negotiate an agreement on the creation of one Web site where consumers could search virtually all the listings in New York City.</p>
        <p>But the two sides were unable to reach an agreement, and the task force, which includes Sotheby's International Realty, Alice Mason Ltd., Coldwell Banker Hunt Kennedy and Brown Harris Stevens, decided to unveil its Web site, nymls.com, yesterday, to get ahead of the other group.</p>
        <p>Yesterday morning, nymls.com had 1,760 homes and apartments for sale and 469 rentals, representing about 42 percent of the estimated market, according to officials running the site.</p>
        <p>The Corocran-Elliman group, which includes the Halstead Property Company and Bellmarc Realty, has a combined total of about 1,818 homes and apartments for sale on the four companies' existing sites, said Scott Durkin, the chief operating officer of the Corcoran Group.</p>
        <p>The start of nymls.com caught the Corcoran Group by surprise, Mr. Durkin said.</p>
        <p>''We've been having meetings with what we call the MLS group and we have all agreed that we would not do anything until we decided whether we would continue as one or split off into two,'' he said. ''Now, we see this announcement today.''</p>
        <p>The Corocran-Elliman group has said it hopes to start its site by Jan. 1, and Alan Rogers, the chairman of Douglas Elliman, said his group was ''on track with our plan and will continue on the course we've set.''</p>
        <p>''We will unquestionably deliver the best product,'' Mr. Rogers said.  ''We are confident that the industry will follow.''</p>
