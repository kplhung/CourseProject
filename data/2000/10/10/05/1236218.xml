        <p>Federal tax agents have seized seven years' worth of financial records from the headquarters of the school board in this affluent suburban community as part of an investigation into possible money laundering, corruption and budget irregularities, officials said today.</p>
        <p>A few hours after the raid, the school board voted to suspend the district's business administrator.</p>
        <p>Ten agents of the Internal Revenue Service spent most of Tuesday afternoon at the board's small, one-story office building examining files, and left with several cartons of vendor lists, purchase orders, bills and a computer containing financial data, Benjamin Fox, the president of the school board, said.</p>
        <p>In addition, the agents, who came with a wide-ranging federal search warrant, confiscated school board resolutions, meeting agendas and 19 other categories of material dating back to 1993, said Al Drucker, a spokesman for the criminal investigation section of the I.R.S.</p>
        <p>Mr. Drucker said the warrant gave the agents authority to search for possible violations of eight sections of the federal criminal code, including those dealing with money laundering and public corruption. He would not offer other details of the inquiry, including the reasons for it or whether it was a spinoff of a broader federal investigation of public officials elsewhere in New Jersey.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fox, the superintendent of this small district of 2,200 students, said he was mystified about the origins of the investigation and the reasons for it, and pointed out during an interview that the search warrant bore only the name of Richard Davis, the school system's business administrator and chief financial officer for the last 17 years.</p>
        <p>The board held an emergency meeting Tuesday night and suspended Mr. Davis, who is also the secretary to the school board. Mr. Davis was allowed to continue collecting his annual salary of $135,000, Mr. Fox said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Davis could not be reached today for comment on the inquiry and his suspension. A woman who answered the phone at his home said, ''Not available, thank you,'' and hung up.</p>
        <p>The federal government has seldom investigated school district financing in New Jersey. Typically, the State Department of Education monitors school budgets and usually helps local officials resolve minor problems with them.</p>
        <p>In districts with deep-seated, persistent budget problems, the state has usurped local control and put a fiscal monitor in charge of spending. In an extreme case of fiscal mismanagement in the late 1980's, the State Education Department seized control of the Jersey City school system, which it continues to run.</p>
        <p>In Wyckoff's case, officials at the Education Department and the State Division of Criminal Justice said they had no prior knowledge of the I.R.S. inquiry or the seizure of documents.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fox said the district's books were examined each year by an independent outside auditor as required by state education law. ''There's been no irregularities whatsoever,'' he said. ''All those audits in the past have had A+ ratings.''</p>
        <p>He said the State Education Department routinely reviewed the audits and had never raised questions about Wyckoff's $19 million annual budget or any of its accounting practices. He said he had no idea whether any money was missing from school district accounts. And he said he and other board members knew nothing about the possible existence of any obscure accounts with questionable deposits or payments consistent with any money-laundering scheme.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fox said the inquiry had unfairly ''cast a shadow'' on the entire school system and its teachers and other employees. ''It's important for the public to continue to support this district,'' he said. ''The Board of Education has nothing to hide, and we want to get to the bottom of whatever took place. That's a message I want to make perfectly clear.''</p>
        <p>At its meeting on Tuesday night, the board voted to hire another auditing company to review the financial data at issue, Mr. Fox said. He said there was no indication that the board's regular auditor was involved in the investigation.</p>
        <p>News of the inquiry startled many in this suburb of about 17,000 in western Bergen County. The school system generally has a solid educational reputation and, as in many of the wealthier suburbs in northern New Jersey, Wyckoff's schools are an important underpinning of high property values. The system has five elementary schools, a middle school and two regional high schools. Pride in the system runs deep, and parents were disturbed today.</p>
        <p>''Everybody is just totally shocked right now,'' said one parent, Helene Naftali, interviewed outside George Washington Elementary School. ''This is a community where the feeling is that everything is upstanding. This is very shocking and very upsetting.''</p>
        <p>Another parent, Barbara Lucia, said she was worried that the investigation could undermine support for a $20 million bond issue for renovations at one of the regional high schools, Ramapo High.</p>
        <p>''It just goes to show you that there's no community that's immune from this kind of thing,'' she said.</p>
