        <p>Jeff Kent might consider retiring should the Giants win the World Series. The subject came up when the second baseman was asked about the most valuable player award.</p>
        <p>''I think we all want to win the M.V.P.,'' he said. ''So to sit here and say, 'I don't care if I don't win it,' that's a lie. But honestly, that's something I don't care or worry about right now, because I put so much effort into playing the game as a team that if we win the dang World Series, you might not see me playing here next year.</p>
