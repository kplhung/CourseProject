      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Emmanuelle Fouks, a fashion designer, never paid much attention to her mother's shop, Maison de Vacances, known for its simple but chic white and beige bedding. She was too busy designing fashion collections and being paid as a trend spotter for Japanese clients. Two years ago, after having a baby, Ms. Fouks suddenly noticed her mother's business. ''I saw the potential to merge two of my passions -- fashion and home furnishings,'' said Ms. Fouks, right, who added color (raspberry, orange, fuchsia, khaki, purple) and texture (velour, mohair, rabbit fur, alpaca) to the natural linen that had been the Maison de Vacances trademark. ''When you buy a pair of shoes, you don't buy them thinking you will keep them for 10 years,'' she said. ''I think home furnishings should be the same.'' At recent trade fairs buyers snatched up her first collection: velour house slippers, above, $60 a pair, and cushions ($70 to $350) and bedspreads ($340 to $650) in velour and linen, mohair cable and jersey knit, and rabbit fur and linen. Available soon at Roberta Freymann, 23 East 73rd Street, (212) 585-3767; A La Maison, 1078 Madison Avenue (near 81st Street), (212) 396-1020; Ad Hoc Softwares, 136 Wooster Street, at Prince, (212) 982-7703; and in January, Bloomingdale's.</p>
