        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I was glad to see some print space devoted to the danger that Microsoft's nearly total market share presents to WordPerfect's survivial as a word processing program. I would, however, go further than Mr. Brinkley: WordPerfect's ''Reveal Codes'' option is not merely a ''convenience,'' but a critically important feature for those who, like me, spend much of their working lives in the mire of complex documents. Note it well - no matter what its aficionados tell you, Word has no remotely comparable function. Should WordPerfect and its ''Reveal Codes'' function become unavailable, untold productive hours will be lost, the inevitable result of which is bound to be an increase in the cost of doing business.</p>
