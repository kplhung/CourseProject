        <p>''It's the story of a home,'' the architect and designer Florence Fabiani-Baudoux, above, said of her maiden furniture collection, Oom. The first Oom pieces -- a sofa, low table, lamp, rug and key chain; yes, a key chain -- are for the living room. ''In January, I will present the bedroom and so on and so forth until the collection, the house, is complete in two years,'' she said. A khaki felt sofa with a few stripes, above, and a low table divided into three lacquer trays have a contemporary feel with French refinement. Ms. Fabiani-Baudoux is known in Paris for her architectural and design work on residential projects. She is now doing her first home in the United States. Information, www.luma-oom.com; fax, 011-33.1.45.49.37.36.</p>
