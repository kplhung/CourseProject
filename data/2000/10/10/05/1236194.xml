        <p>In what gun-control proponents consider a major boost for their cause, Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican, has begun appearing in television commercials promoting ballot initiatives in Colorado and Oregon that would require people who buy firearms at gun shows to undergo criminal background checks.</p>
        <p>The 30-second spots, which began airing in the Denver area today, show Mr. McCain saying into the camera: ''I'm John McCain with some straight talk. Convicted felons have been able to buy and sell thousands of guns at gun shows because of a loophole in the law. Many were later used in crimes. That's wrong.''</p>

        <p>In what gun-control proponents consider a major boost for their cause, Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican, has begun appearing in television commercials promoting ballot initiatives in Colorado and Oregon that would require people who buy firearms at gun shows to undergo criminal background checks.</p>
        <p>The 30-second spots, which began airing in the Denver area today, show Mr. McCain saying into the camera: ''I'm John McCain with some straight talk. Convicted felons have been able to buy and sell thousands of guns at gun shows because of a loophole in the law. Many were later used in crimes. That's wrong.''</p>
        <p>Gun-control advocates are hoping Mr. McCain will significantly broaden the credibility of their cause  among more conservative voters. Not only has Mr. McCain been a reliable ally of the National Rifle Association in the past, but he is also a decorated war hero with wide appeal among veterans who gained national prominence this year in his insurgent bid for the Republican presidential nomination.</p>
        <p>The commercials are being financed by Americans for Gun Safety, a nonprofit gun-control group created in July by Andrew J. McKelvey, the billionaire chief executive of TMP Worldwide, a marketing company with holdings including Monster.com.</p>
        <p>Mr. McKelvey has pledged to spend $8 million of his personal fortune on the group, which has already opened chapters in 28 states.</p>
        <p>''From our perspective, Colorado and Oregon are ground zero in the gun-safety debate,'' said Jonathan J. Cowan, president of Americans for Gun Safety. ''If both states pass these common-sense initiatives, it will send a significant signal that the momentum in this debate has shifted.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cowan, a former chief of staff to Housing Secretary Andrew M. Cuomo, said his group's goal was to find a ''third way'' in the contentious world of firearms politics that could unite gun owners and gun-control advocates around an agenda calling for both new laws and stricter enforcement of existing regulations.</p>
        <p>In the new commercial, Mr. McCain states the group's ethos this way: ''I believe law-abiding citizens have the right to own guns. But with rights come responsibilities.''</p>
        <p>Mr. McKelvey, a registered Republican, recruited Mr. McCain to help promote his group because he wanted to break free of the stereotype of gun-control advocates as liberal Democrats. As recently as last year, Mr. McCain sided with conservatives in Congress in voting against legislation intended to close the gun-show loophole.</p>
        <p>But in an interview today, Mr. McCain said that mass shootings at places like Columbine High School in Colorado -- where one of the weapons was bought at a gun show -- had caused him to rethink his views.</p>
        <p>''I do believe my view has evolved,'' he said. ''It's appropriate to do so in light of some of the terrible tragedies that have befallen our nation.'' He added that he would push for passage of the gun-show bill in Congress next year.</p>
        <p>Joe Sudbay, political director for Handgun Control Inc., said the McCain commercials provide further evidence that the National Rifle Association is losing its grip over the Republican Party. ''He's been a true advocate for the gun lobby,'' Mr. Sudbay said of Mr. McCain ''So I think it's a big deal.''</p>
        <p>William Powers, a spokesman for the rifle association, which is fighting the ballot initiatives, declined to comment.</p>
        <p>Some political analysts contend that the Colorado initiative could draw many Democrats to the polls, thus helping Vice President Al Gore win the state from Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the Republican. But Mr. McCain, who finished behind Mr. Bush in the Republican primaries this year, said he did not think that would happen.</p>
        <p>Asked if he had heard from the Bush campaign about the new commercials, Mr. McCain replied, ''No. But I'm sure I will tomorrow.''</p>
