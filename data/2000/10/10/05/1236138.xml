        <p>WHEN it comes to assessing the relative benefits of computers in their children's</p>
        <p>lives, parents don't have it easy. The signals are decidedly mixed. As computer manufacturers and software companies promote computers as indispensable educational tools, some educators agree, but certain scholars and technology skeptics denounce the reliance on the machine. Sorting through the arguments is no small task.</p>
        <p>Last month, for example, a little-known organization called the Alliance for Childhood issued a statement (allianceforchildhood.org) calling for a moratorium on the further introduction of computers into the nation's elementary schools until their effect on young children is assessed more carefully.</p>
        <p>The group's statement was signed by more than 85 experts in fields as varied as psychiatry, education, philosophy, neurology and nutrition.</p>
        <p>Accompanying the statement was a long report that cited a litany of negative effects that computers can have on small children. Long stints in front of the computer, the group said, not only come at the expense of creative play and outdoor experiences but also increase the risk of social isolation, obesity and eyestrain.</p>
        <p>Among other recommendations, the group called for ''a comprehensive report by the U.S. Surgeon General on the full extent of physical, emotional and other developmental hazards computers pose to children.''</p>
        <p>In many corners, the study prompted a sigh of relief. At last, a voice against the technology juggernaut.</p>
        <p>But once the initial media rush to cover the announcement had passed, reactions to the group's 100-page, densely footnoted report, ''Fool's Gold: A Critical Look at Computers in Childhood,'' were mixed. Several child development experts questioned the report's assumption that young children were limited in their ability to think abstractly, a theory once embraced by the developmental theorist Jean Piaget but long since discounted by contemporary experts in cognitive development.</p>
        <p>''If anything, it's just the opposite,'' said Dr. Alison Gopnik, a developmental psychologist at the University of California at Berkeley and co-author of ''The Scientist in the Crib: Minds, Brains and How Children Learn'' (William Morrow, 1999). ''The last 30 years of research have shown us that even very young children go well beyond just sensation and action and understand the world in a more abstract way.''</p>
        <p>As it turns out, the Alliance for Childhood has strong ties to Waldorf education, a pedagogical approach that emphasizes the development of sensory motor skills in the early years, often puts off intensive reading instruction until second or third grade and frowns on television viewing and mass-produced textbooks. The alliance, a privately financed, nonprofit organization in College Park, Md., was formed 18 months ago after an international Waldorf meeting on kindergarten education.</p>
        <p>''The teachers present felt strongly that something had to be done to help children,'' said Joan Almon, United States coordinator for the Alliance for Childhood and co-chairwoman of the Waldorf Early Childhood Association of North America.  ''We were seeing problems related to stress and nervousness in children spread around the world like an epidemic, including millions of children being placed on psychotropic drugs.'' The group suspected that computer use could be part of the problem.</p>
        <p>Some critics are wary of the Alliance for Childhood's ties to Waldorf education. ''It's not like they have evaluated in a dispassionate way the research on children and computers and come to a conclusion,'' said Dr. Susan A. Gelman, a psychology professor and child development expert at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor. ''They have a theoretical commitment to children learning through these interactions that involve the whole body.''</p>
        <p>The group's supporters have spread well beyond the Waldorf movement and into the wider world of technology skeptics, who have grown weary of the high-tech industry's constant celebration of computers in schools.</p>
        <p>''I've seen extremism coming out in torrents from the opposite side for years, and the other shoe has finally dropped,'' said Dr. Langdon Winner, a political scientist at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y. Dr. Winner is a technology skeptic of long standing and one of the signers of the Alliance for Childhood's position statement.</p>
        <p>''I haven't heard anything except 76 trombones for the past 20 years,'' he said, ''and here you have a little piccolo saying maybe this isn't such a good idea.''</p>
        <p>Another signer of the group's position statement, Dr. Jane M. Healy, an educational psychologist and the author of ''Failure to Connect: How Computers Affect Our Children's Minds -- and What We Can Do About It (Simon &amp; Schuster, 1999), said she was appalled by the flood of money  being allocated to computers in schools, at the expense of other needs.</p>
        <p>''We have buildings that are falling apart, and we have an inadequate number of teachers and inadequately trained teachers,'' Dr. Healy said. ''For the sake of technology, schools have cut reading and math specialists, arts, music, phys. ed., all the things we have clear evidence that prepare kids for the real world.''</p>
        <p>Few researchers have spent prolonged periods inside elementary school classrooms, observing the use of computers there. ''Most of the data is usually self-reported, either by teachers or principals,'' said Dr. Larry Cuban, a professor of education at Stanford University and a signer of the Alliance for Childhood's position statement.</p>
        <p>Dr. Cuban and two doctoral students recently spent seven months visiting 11 preschool and kindergarten classrooms in the Silicon Valley area, watching children use computers and interviewing teachers.</p>
        <p>''What we found were computers were modestly used,'' Dr. Cuban said. The children used the computers for around 30 minutes at a time, playing games and doing math and alphabet drills.</p>
        <p>''It was benign,'' Dr. Cuban said, ''because they'd been incorporated into the existing developmental perspective of most of these teachers.''</p>
        <p>Still, Dr. Cuban signed the group's statement because, he said, he believed that it was ''worthwhile to call a halt to all the hype about the importance of this.''</p>
        <p>''It's worthwhile,'' he added, ''for someone to say, 'Whoa, let's take a look at this.' If anything, it raises questions about the expenditures and how pressured schools are to adopt technology.''</p>
        <p>Gary Chapman, director of the 21st Century Project at the University of Texas at Austin, a research and education program on science and technology policy, is known for his occasional critical view of computers but reacted differently. Mr. Chapman refused to sign the statement, partly because he considered the call for a moratorium too extreme.</p>
        <p>''I told them I thought it unnecessarily alienated the technology industry, that a lot of these people have kids, too, and they'd be open to what the group said,'' Mr. Chapman said. ''But this was just provocative.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Almon said it was not the group's intention to set up opposing camps. ''The alliance is raising serious concerns about the increasing emphasis on computers and trying to open a national conversation,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Even some cognitive development experts who did not agree with the group's views on childhood development said they believed that the call to action had struck a chord among parents.</p>
        <p>''This is a tremendous broadside without much evidence and a lot of passion,'' said Dr. David Klahr, a professor of psychology at Carnegie Mellon University who specializes in cognitive development. ''On the other hand, they're definitely on to something, because I feel uneasy when I see my kids or my friends' kids spend seven hours a day in front of the computer.</p>
        <p>''They're saying that computers are compelling, almost addictive, and they take kids away from other things that are good for their personal development. Intuitively that has a lot of appeal. It would be nice to get some solid data.''</p>
        <p>In the end, said Dr. Winner, at Rensselaer Polytechnic, the group's position statement was more political than anything else. ''From Plato to the present day, the question has been, 'How do we educate our young? What are appropriate processes?' And my feeling is, that's not a scientific question, it's a political and philosophical question, about which there's a lot of disagreement.''</p>
