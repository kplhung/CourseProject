        <p>While the vice-presidential debate scheduled for this evening will focus on national issues, Senator Joseph Lieberman, the Democratic nominee, remains at the center of a vital matter affecting voters in his home state and members of his national party.

Thus he is running for two offices at once, a fail-safe approach that almost certainly guarantees him a Senate seat in case the Democratic presidential ticket loses.

His replacement on the Democratic line, probably the state attorney general, Richard Blumenthal, would be chosen by a committee of party leaders.</p>

        <p>While the vice-presidential debate scheduled for this evening will focus on national issues, Senator Joseph Lieberman, the Democratic nominee, remains at the center of a vital matter affecting voters in his home state and members of his national party. Since being nominated for vice president this summer, Mr. Lieberman has refused to take his name off the ballot for the United States Senate in Connecticut. Thus he is running for two offices at once, a fail-safe approach that almost certainly guarantees him a Senate seat in case the Democratic presidential ticket loses. The problem is that this dual candidacy is unfair to his constituents at home and undercuts his own image as a person who puts principle above political convenience.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman has constructed a tortured and self-serving excuse for depriving Connecticut voters of a Democratic Senate nominee who would be guaranteed to serve if elected to that office. Mr. Lieberman argues that by dropping out now, he robs those voters of a chance to choose which candidate should be the Democratic nominee. His replacement on the Democratic line, probably the state attorney general, Richard Blumenthal, would be chosen by a committee of party leaders.</p>
        <p>He fails to mention that the procedure is a legally mandated way of dealing with unforeseen developments such as his selection for the national ticket by Al Gore. Moreover, if Mr. Lieberman is elected vice president and has to resign from the Senate, Connecticut's Republican governor, John Rowland, would choose his replacement. That choice would surely be a Republican, an even greater distortion of fairness if a majority of Connecticut voters want a Democrat to represent them.</p>
        <p>For their own partisan reasons, Mr. Lieberman's Democratic colleagues are privately steaming about his decision to place job security above the party's interests. Not only does his approach raise questions about his confidence in the Gore-Lieberman ticket, it also muddies the national party's argument about the importance of putting the Senate back in Democratic hands. There is now at least a long-shot chance that the party could capture the four Senate seats it needs to break the G.O.P.'s Senate majority, but it would give one of them away if Mr. Lieberman won the vice presidency.</p>
        <p>Voters have a right to ask Mr. Lieberman and the national Democratic leadership this question: If you believe that Democratic control of the Senate is really important to the welfare of the working families Mr. Gore is always talking about, why are you treating that control so casually?</p>
        <p>Senator Robert Torricelli of New Jersey, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, was right to call on Mr. Lieberman to withdraw from the Senate race. Since then, Washington Democrats have been quiet, probably because they know the subject makes Mr. Lieberman testy and because they do not want to have an intramural squabble right before the election. But it is an open secret that many, perhaps most, party leaders disapprove of Mr. Lieberman's selfish behavior.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman has until Oct. 27 to drop out and give his state the contest it deserves. But every day's delay adds to his distortion of the election process, since absentee ballots go out as soon as Friday. If he follows his hard-headed course, Mr. Lieberman's ploy could assure that one person, Governor Rowland, will choose Connecticut's next senator instead of a million-plus voters.</p>
