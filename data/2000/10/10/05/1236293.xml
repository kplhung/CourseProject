        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As a recent high school graduate, I know of the difficulties facing this year's high school seniors as they begin the tedious college admissions process (''The College Search Game, Spam Included,'' Sept. 28).</p>
        <p>Commercial college Web sites played a small role in my admissions process. They helped me create an initial list of schools I may be interested in and also provided some statistical information. However, this is about as helpful as they could be.</p>
        <p>Firsthand feedback, whether through a visit to campus, a discussion with a current student, or a meeting with an admissions officer is by far the most valuable resource in choosing a right school. Until commercial college Web sites begin providing more important information to assist students in making decisions, and less redundant facts, I would advise the college-bound not to waste time on them.</p>
