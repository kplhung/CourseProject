        <p>All That Dancing  Can Exact a Toll</p>
        <p>CAROLINE H. NEWHOUSE was eight words into a sentence -- ''My first job was at the City Opera'' -- when her nephew MARK interrupted from across the table. ''We aren't going to say the 'O' word today,'' said Mr. Newhouse, who is on the board of the New York City Opera.</p>

        <p>All That Dancing  Can Exact a Toll</p>
        <p>CAROLINE H. NEWHOUSE was eight words into a sentence -- ''My first job was at the City Opera'' -- when her nephew MARK interrupted from across the table. ''We aren't going to say the 'O' word today,'' said Mr. Newhouse, who is on the board of the New York City Opera.</p>
        <p>The reason the ''O'' word was out of bounds was that this was a ''D'' lunch -- ''D'' as in dance. Specifically, the lunch was for Career Transition for Dancers, a nonprofit group that Caroline Newhouse started 15 years ago. Career Transition provides counseling and scholarships for dancers who are forced into retirement in middle age, or sooner.</p>
        <p>''My aunt is a sculptor and used to use dancers as models,'' Mr. Newhouse, the vice president and general manager of The Star-Ledger of Newark, explained a moment later. ''Dancers are like athletes: they devote their bodies to their art and by the time they're in their 30's, they need to start all over again.'' The lunch, at the Russian Tea Room, was a warmup for a benefit on Monday honoring the philanthropist ANNE H. BASS, who is on the board of the New York City Ballet, and PETER MARTINS, the dancer and choreographer. Caroline Newhouse said she remembered Mr. Martins's first performance at the City Ballet; he began in 1967 as a guest artist.</p>
        <p>Ms. Bass said, ''So many of us who love dance worry about training dancers.</p>
        <p>''We forget that at a very young age, these fantastic people have to find another life.''</p>
        <p>Debatable Choice</p>
        <p>Not everyone in New York was glued to a television on Tuesday night for the presidential debate or the American League division playoff game. EDIE FALCO and other cast members from the HBO series ''The Sopranos'' were watching a screening of the film ''Two-Family House'' when the two televised contests were going on.</p>
        <p>There was no contest for RAYMOND DE FELITTA, who wrote and directed ''Two-House Family'' -- he was at the screening.</p>
        <p>One of the stars, MICHAEL RISPOLI, arrived in a black stretch limousine with his excited wife, PAM, who asked everyone if ''they had already seen the movie.'' (She has seen it four times.) Mr. Rispoli, who knows how to get maximum mileage from a raised eyebrow, played a gangster who died of cancer on ''The Sopranos.'' The part in ''Two-Family House'' was a departure from the kinds of roles he is usually hired for.  ''I'm usually a cop or a crook,'' he said. ''Arresting someone or being arrested.'' So did he enjoy being a romantic lead? ''I could get used to it,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Special Cargo</p>
        <p>A conductor's baton and a medal will go into space on the shuttle Discovery's latest trip, scheduled to begin today.</p>
        <p>WOLFGANG SAWALLISCH, the music director of the Philadelphia Orchestra, conducted with the baton at a recording session of the trumpet-and-timpani opening of Richard Strauss's ''Also Sprach Zarathustra'' -- the passage used in ''2001: A Space Odyssey'' -- last week.</p>
        <p>''I'm happy to have my baton go up, so long as I don't have to,'' Mr. Sawallisch said through a spokeswoman.</p>
        <p>One of the astronauts, WILLIAM S. McARTHUR, is taking a National Ethnic Coalition of Organizations Ellis Island Medal of Honor and a list of recipients.</p>
        <p>The list includes GEN. H. NORMAN SCHWARZKOPF, GEORGE M. STEINBRENNER 3rd, DIANE SAWYER, BARBARA WALTERS and LEE A. IACOCCA. Colonel McArthur's name is on the list, too: he received the medal last year. (The medal he was given is staying home; he is taking a look-alike.)</p>
