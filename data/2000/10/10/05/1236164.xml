        <p>Even the Darth Vader of the evil empire is beloved in his hometown.</p>
        <p>''Iosif Stalin was a great hero,'' Irma Kutashvili, 16, said as she described the lessons she is learning in high school about Gori's most famous native son. ''He was a very outstanding person and an outstanding leader of the country.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Kutashvili spoke as she and a friend, Mariam Chagazashvili, sat on the steps of the house where Stalin was born on Dec. 21, 1879. Both said they had never heard a bad word about the man who sent millions of his countrymen to exile and death as the iron-fisted ruler of the Soviet Union for three decades.</p>
        <p>The brick-and-timber house, really little more than a hut, is surrounded by a gaudy Greco-Italianate pavilion built in 1937 at the height of Stalin's power. Behind it stands the Stalin Museum, a palatial structure completed after Stalin's death in 1953 and the only public museum honoring him.</p>
        <p>Since the collapse of the Soviet Union a decade ago, Stalin's image has enjoyed a slight -- but recognizable -- burnishing. The number of visitors to his birthplace and museum has increased, though it remains modest at about 50 a week. To some, Stalin represents their nostalgia for the security of the Soviet era.</p>
        <p>''What do we have now that is so great?'' Nina Tskrialashvili, 75, asked angrily when questioned about Stalin's legacy. ''We have no electricity, no food and no jobs. At least under the Soviet regime, there was enough food.''</p>
        <p>Manana Chutkerashvili, a stout woman in a severe black dress, has been a guide at the Stalin Museum for many years. Standing inside the door of the house, she gestured to the bed, with its coarse blankets, and said solemnly, ''This is the bed where he was born.''</p>
        <p>It is a tiny room in a tiny house. There is a wide bed, a small dining table and four stools. The future leader of the Soviet Union was born Iosif Dzugashvili, the son of a poor shoemaker and his wife. His mother lost two sons in childbirth before he was born, and he lived with his parents in the single rented room for four years.</p>
        <p>Gori, a town of 5,000 in the late 19th century, is on the grasslands along the Kura River, not far from the snow-capped High Caucasus. Stalin stayed here until 1894, when he went to study for the priesthood in the Georgian capital, Tbilisi, about 60 miles to the east. He was expelled from the seminary for Marxist activities three weeks before graduation in 1901, and he eventually became a full-time Communist organizer and one of the leaders of the revolution, keeping his underground name, Stalin, or steel.</p>
        <p>Today, Gori has a population of about 70,000, and its village atmosphere was long ago replaced by the harsh concrete buildings of the Soviet era. Over the years it has been an important agricultural marketing center, but, like much of Georgia, it is now a place where people scrape a living from small jobs and agriculture.</p>
        <p>The Stalin Museum reflects the condition of the city. The promenade leading to the building is covered with weeds and litter. There is no money to pay for electricity, even when electricity is available. On sunny days visitors rely on the light from windows to see the inside, and on darkened afternoons the matronly guides carry small flashlights.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Chutkerashvili said that the museum is especially popular with tourists from Japan and China, and almost on cue a group of 10 Chinese tourists trudged up the darkened stairway to the second-floor exhibition rooms.</p>
        <p>For each boast about a Stalin accomplishment, there is a defense for his reputation as a cold-hearted thug who sentenced enemies and innocent citizens to death and labor camps. ''He gave the orders to send traitors into exile, and it was not his fault that some people misused his orders,'' the guide explained.</p>
        <p>With a look of pain, she volunteered that her grandfather had been exiled to Kazakhstan in one of Stalin's purges. Her grandfather, she explained, was lucky. He wrote to the authorities and proved that he was not a traitor, so he was allowed to return to Gori.</p>
        <p>Stalin's great-grandson, Yasha Dzugashvili, is a 28-year-old Internet entrepreneur who went to school in England and who lives in Tbilisi. He said he wishes the museum were kept up better. He also wishes that the memory of his famous ancestor were refurbished, too.</p>
        <p>''You cannot speak about him without considering the whole history of Georgia and the Russian empire,'' Mr. Dzugashvili said. ''People around the world say things about him, even historians, but there is no attempt to understand the complexity of his situation.''</p>
