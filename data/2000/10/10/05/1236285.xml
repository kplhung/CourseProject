        <p>Cursory answers, glazed expressions, awkward silences and sudden changes. Those are the elements of a spiraling team, and that is how the Yankees looked and acted for most of the past two days. They were numb and they almost seemed done. Their season could have been over tomorrow night.</p>
        <p>But there still is a pulse on this perplexing team. There is still a way for the Yankees to forget about their dreary waltz through late September, after Andy Pettitte did what Roger Clemens could not last night and powered the Yankees to a 4-0 victory over the Athletics: one, two, three, exhale. The Yankees won a game and it felt as if they had won the division series.</p>

        <p>Cursory answers, glazed expressions, awkward silences and sudden changes. Those are the elements of a spiraling team, and that is how the Yankees looked and acted for most of the past two days. They were numb and they almost seemed done. Their season could have been over tomorrow night.</p>
        <p>But there still is a pulse on this perplexing team. There is still a way for the Yankees to forget about their dreary waltz through late September, after Andy Pettitte did what Roger Clemens could not last night and powered the Yankees to a 4-0 victory over the Athletics: one, two, three, exhale. The Yankees won a game and it felt as if they had won the division series.</p>
        <p>But that is how desperate the Yankees had gotten as their season dangled above them like a $100 bill on the end of a kite. The Yankees kept playing and trying and hoping, but they could not grab the bill. Finally, behind the gritty Pettitte and Joe Torre's revised lineup, the Yankees emerged and grabbed Game 2.</p>
        <p>If the Yankees had stumbled again, Paul O'Neill admitted they would have been ''tapped out,'' a fading team awaiting burial.</p>
        <p>Things change instantly in a three-of-five series, which is why the Yankees, surly and in denial after losing Game 1, felt much better as they returned to New York. Glenallen Hill and Luis Sojo, part of the lineup that banished Chuck Knoblauch and lowered O'Neill, belted the crucial hits. Now the Yankees have Orlando Hernandez, their best postseason pitcher, in Game 3.</p>
        <p>''I feel very strongly that the momentum can change very quickly,'' Torre said before Game 2. ''If we win tonight, now all of a sudden people will say, 'Aha, they're going home for two games.' In 24 hours, people take a different viewpoint.''</p>
        <p>When Sojo was asked if the momentum had swung, he barked: ''Oh, yeah. We just had to break the ice and get the win.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees had not played this type of sticky postseason contest since Game 4 of the 1998 American League Championship Series against the Indians and Game 3 of the 1996 World Series against the Braves. When Derek Jeter was asked if tonight's game reminded him of those affairs, he said, ''Definitely.''</p>
        <p>Hernandez defeated the Indians two years ago to bring the Yankees back from a 2-1 deficit and help save their 114-victory regular season from potential ruin. An ornery David Cone stopped the Braves four years ago to initiate a streak of four straight shocking victories. Tonight, pitching rescued the Yankees again.</p>
        <p>Pettitte kept a towel wrapped around his neck in the dugout for most of the night and strangled the A's into the eighth. After Ramon Hernandez lined a two-out double and Sojo tripped after fielding a grounder, the Yankees summoned Mariano Rivera. Randy Velarde tapped a grounder to third base that caromed off the lip of the grass, but Scott Brosius was adept enough to block the ball with his bare hand, pick it up and throw it to first.</p>
        <p>The Yankees exhaled again. ''I don't know if we had a sigh of relief,'' Brosius said. ''We expected to win.''</p>
        <p>After failing to win Game 1 and show that there was a walk accompanying their talk, the Yanks forced Torre to push another button. The manager who has shown an uncanny touch while guiding the Yankees to three titles in the last four years benched Knoblauch and dropped O'Neill from the third spot to sixth in the lineup. Torre started Hill at designated hitter and batted David Justice third. Torre, like the Yankees, was searching.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes, you change things and maybe the sun comes out,'' said O'Neill.</p>
        <p>It shined for the Yankees in the sixth. After the A's intentionally walked O'Neill to put men on first and second wth two out for Hill, Hill calmly punched a single to center to make it, 1-0. Sojo followed by squirting a two-run double to right.</p>
        <p>As much as it made sense to move the slumping O'Neill, who is 4 for his last 45, it seemed questionable to tamper with Knoblauch. Knoblauch was 13 for 40 off Kevin Appier, the Oakland starter, while Hill was 2 for 12. Knoblauch sat in the corner of the dugout before the game and wondered why he was not the d.h. or the second baseman ahead of Sojo. But Torre's moves were golden. Again.</p>
        <p>''He shook things up,'' said Tino Martinez. ''He pushes the right buttons.''</p>
        <p>Torre benched first baseman Martinez for Cecil Fielder in the 1996 World Series and it worked. Torre started little-used Ricky Ledee in the first three games of the 1998 World Series and Ledee went 6 for 10 against San Diego. Torre avoided the normal setup roles for his relievers and used Ramiro Mendoza in the toughest spots last October. Those moves sang. So did tonight's.</p>
        <p>The Yankees went into this series having won 22 of their last 25 postseason games, but teams do not keep that torrid pace. They find out what the postseason is like for the teams that lose because they become one of those other teams. The Yankees, who are on a 1-1 pace this season, are trying to avoid becoming one of them.</p>
