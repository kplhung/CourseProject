        <p>After 10 days of bickering among officials of the Connecticut Junior Soccer Association and the two team coaches, it appears the 10-year-old boys of the Avon Soccer Club will play Fairfield United after all.</p>
        <p>Today, under an intense press  spotlight, the association waived a rule requiring that the game be played before Oct. 1 and gave them until Saturday to make up the State Cup tournament game.</p>
        <p>''Youngsters should not suffer as a result of adults' inability to reach a reasonable accommodation,'' the association said in a statement today.</p>
        <p>The officials who issued the statement did not answer phone calls this evening and declined to explain what had changed their minds after days of declining to alter the rules.</p>
        <p>A week ago, all the Avon players, six of whom are Jewish, refused to play the game on Saturday, during Rosh Hashana, the Jewish New Year.</p>
        <p>Though Avon's coach, Len Goldberg, had asked Fairfield's coach, Donald Houston, to play the game early, Mr. Houston had refused, saying last week that doing so would have meant playing without two injured players, putting his team at a disadvantage.</p>
        <p>On Friday, Mr. Houston changed his mind, saying that his team would not accept a forfeited victory and would also forfeit the game.</p>
        <p>The two teams expect to meet next Saturday.</p>
