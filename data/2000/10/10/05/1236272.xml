        <p>A day after his first debate with Gov. George W. Bush, Vice President Al Gore seemed far removed from the thrust and parry of forensics.</p>
        <p>At a rally in the courthouse square here, Mr. Gore mentioned the debate only in passing. ''Did you see the debate last night?'' he asked the  crowd. ''I don't know about you, but I think, even though Governor Bush and I have a lot of differences, personally, I think it's better to spend time attacking America's problems than attacking people personally.'' The audience cheered.</p>
        <p>Offstage, Mr. Gore's campaign aides accused Mr. Bush of making several misstatements in the 90-minute exchange in Boston on Tuesday night and acknowledged that Mr. Gore had made a couple of slips himself. Mr. Gore conceded that he did not examine fires in Texas in 1998 with the director of the federal disaster agency, as he had said in the debate. It was the deputy director.</p>
        <p>But today, Mr. Gore focused on education, health care and preserving retirement security. Similarly, at a rally on Tuesday night in Boston after the debate, Mr. Gore did not mention the big event either, dwelling instead on his fond recollections of Boston from his days at Harvard.</p>
        <p>This morning, Mr. Gore was queried on several television talk shows about his debate performance. But he showed little interest in rehashing the event, even though many talk-show hosts suggested he had won.</p>
        <p>Christopher Lehane, a Gore campaign spokesman, said Mr. Bush had made at least four misstatements:</p>
        <p>*That as president he would not be able to overturn the decision by the Food and Drug Administration to legalize the abortion pill RU-486. ''In the past he has said if he was president, he would have the government review it,'' Mr. Lehane said.</p>
        <p>*That Mr. Gore had outspent him in the presidential campaign. ''Bush has spent $93 million, we spent $46 million,'' Mr. Lehane said.</p>
        <p>*That the Strunk family from Allentown, Pa., would benefit under his prescription drug plan. Mr. Lehane said the family would not qualify because their income is too high.</p>
        <p>*His response when Mr. Gore asked where he would find the trillion dollars to privatize Social Security: ''The trillion dollars comes from the surplus.'' Mr. Lehane pounced on this answer, saying, ''A trillion dollars on top of his budget numbers already? That would be economically disastrous for our country -- there's absolutely no way that that money exists.''</p>
        <p>In a second debate misstatement cited by the Bush campaign, Mr. Gore said Sarasota High School in Florida was overcrowded. He had based this on a letter from the father of a student at the school and an enclosed newspaper clipping. But the school principal, Daniel Kennedy, said today that the student's classroom had been overcrowded on one particular day because it was being refurbished.</p>

        <p>Event Snarls New Jersey</p>
        <p>The performance by Jon Bon Jovi at his New Jersey home last night may have been unusually decorous for a rock concert. But security for the guest of honor, Vice President Al Gore, turned parts of the state into a veritable mosh pit.</p>
        <p>State police closed off miles of road for Mr. Gore, who flew in and out of Newark International Airport for a Democratic fund-raiser on Mr. Bon Jovi's 18-acre riverside estate in Middletown Township in Monmouth County.</p>
        <p>Jon S. Corzine, the party's candidate for the seat being vacated by Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, also attended the event, which raised $850,000 for Mr. Gore's campaign.</p>
        <p>On the New Jersey Turnpike, the Garden State Parkway, I-78 and I-80, cars were backed up for miles, first about 6 p.m. and then again after the fund-raiser ended about 9 p.m., traffic monitors said.</p>
