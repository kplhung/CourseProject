        <p>THIS is just a little pied-a-terre,'' said Susan Gutfreund, the New York hostess and aspiring decorator, thus stretching the credulity of more than 40 attentive American interior designers ogling the palatial splendor of her triplex in the chic Seventh Arrondissement.</p>
        <p>Furnished by the legendary designer Henri Samuel with exquisite 18th-century paneling and objets d'art, Ms. Gutfreund's apartment was delectable bait used to attract young, successful designers from across the United States to the Biennale International des Antiquaires, the world's most glamorous -- and outrageously expensive -- antiques fair.</p>
        <p>The three-day romp was part of an aggressive marketing campaign conceived by the Biennale's organizers, the National Antiques Dealers Syndicate, who hoped to lure record numbers of platinum-card-wielding American customers.</p>
        <p>''Let's face it, Americans are the ones who are buying,'' said Brian McCarthy, a New York designer who travels to Paris every six weeks for clients who lust for Louis XV commodes. ''We're their bread-and-butter.''</p>
        <p>Judging by the Dallas drawls and Yankee twangs on opening night, the syndicate's efforts paid off. The exchange rate of the franc to the dollar -- seven to one -- didn't hurt, either.</p>
        <p>By the time the two-week fair closed on Oct. 1, several dealers reported that more than 60 percent of their sales were heading for the United States, including a $1 million Chinese bronze lamp bought from the Brussels dealer Gisele Croes. ''I think we speak more English this evening than French,'' said Jacques Perrin, a leading Paris dealer and a vice president of the syndicate.</p>
        <p>Mr. Perrin sold a magnificent Louis XVI gilded bronze clock and a pair of elaborate 18th-century armchairs to a New York financier during the gala preview of the show, held at the Carrousel du Louvre, a subterranean sprawl beneath the museum's Pyramid. ''All exceptional objects, museum quality,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Out of 116 hand-picked dealers, only 10 were purveyors of 20th-century objects. Nonetheless, that was twice as many as last year, and the booths offering French furniture from the 1930's and 40's proved wildly popular, perhaps inspired by Karl Lagerfeld's abrupt switch from collecting 18th-century gilt to the clean, lean contemporary lines of furniture by Jean-Michel Frank. ''It's a style that feels totally right today, the perfect antidote to all the clutter we had in the 80's,'' said John Barman, a New York designer.</p>
        <p>''Everything I sold this evening was to Americans,'' said Pierre Passebon, a first-time Biennale participant, whose spectacular lineup included a rare Surrealist chandelier by Giacometti in the shape of a woman's breast, and a pair of gleaming hall chairs designed by Emilio Terry for Carlos de Beistegui's home in Paris ($71,000). Equally intriguing was the booth itself, which was also for sale: a handsome padded-leather smoking room designed by Frank in 1935 for the Paris home of Jean-Pierre Guerlain, the perfumer.</p>
        <p>Mr. Passebon declined to reveal which Americans had bought his treasures. But Leon Black, an insatiable New York collector of French decorative arts, was seen gazing at two vertical Giacometti lamps with proprietary ardor.</p>
        <p>Some American plutocrats chose to stay home, to the chagrin of their decorators. ''One of my clients wouldn't come because of the Concorde,'' lamented Matthew Smyth, a New York designer, who nonetheless shopped with Wall Street titans brave enough to endure the trans-Atlantic trip in first class.</p>
        <p>The inconvenient suspension of supersonic flights to Paris didn't deter Darlene and Anthony Soave, a couple from Michigan, who were shopping up a storm with their New York decorator, Tony Ingrao, and his partner, Randy Kemper.</p>
        <p>''It's our first Biennale,'' Ms. Soave said, flashing an ice-rink-size D-flawless diamond ring as she passed the stand of Francois Leage, a Parisian dealer who specializes in 18th-century objects. ''They're doing all the paneling for our ballroom in Grosse Pointe.''</p>
        <p>A French 18th-century ballroom in suburban Detroit? ''The panels are Louis XIV, from a town house in the Place Vendome,'' Mr. Ingrao explained. ''But we have to make more, because their new ballroom is so huge. It's a three-year project -- the whole house is going to be 18th century.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Soave, the son of a grocer who worked his way up to a scrap-metal fortune, also hired Mr. Ingrao to design the Soaves' apartment in Naples, Fla., and a modern Manhattan duplex in the new Trump World Tower across from the United Nations. ''We're on the 88th floor, the same as Bill Gates,'' Ms. Soave said sweetly.</p>
        <p>Larry Laslo, a New York designer, was aghast at the multimillion-dollar prices. ''All I've bought so far is a jambon sandwich,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Given the astronomical sums involved, some designers on a Biennale trip organized by Elle Decor were shopping elsewhere. ''You see the prices and cringe,'' said Charles Spada, an interior designer from Boston, who keeps a small apartment in Paris as a base for his frequent shopping expeditions.</p>
        <p>''They're definitely not going to get any money out of me,'' Mr. Spada said cheerfully during a lunch at the Louvre underwritten by Hachette Filipacchi, Elle Decor's parent company, to introduce designers to top dealers at the Biennale. ''I'm heading for the flea market,'' he said. Two days later, he had filled an entire 40-foot container with treasures to be sent by his shipper, Camus, to his antique stores in Boston and on Nantucket.</p>
        <p>For some designers, the trip was a novel opportunity to engage the attention of Margaret Russell, Elle Decor's new editor in chief, who inherited the Paris trip when the magazine's former editor, Marian McEvoy, left to take charge at House Beautiful in mid-July.</p>
        <p>While Ms. Russell is revered for her clean, American taste and her gimlet eye for identifying designers of promise, she made no claims to being an antiques aficionado. When asked her reaction to the Biennale's impressive array of F.F.F. (the industry shorthand for fine French furniture), Ms. Russell looked bewildered. ''What's that?'' she asked.</p>
        <p>On matters like this, she defers to Angus Wilkie, Elle Decor's well-connected antiques columnist, whom she recently promoted to editor at large. ''Angus's expertise is a wonderful asset to the magazine,'' she said. That expertise will presumably come in handy when Elle Decor succeeds Town &amp; Country as the main sponsor of the Winter Antiques Show at the 67th Street armory in January.</p>
        <p>Among the American designers with clients in tow spending serious sums was Scott Snyder, who is based in Palm Beach and Manhattan. ''We just bought a beautiful 18th-century black lacquer gaming table,'' said Mr. Snyder, who was accompanying his client Lewis Foman, elegantly attired in a black silk suit. Like just about every other American of means at the Biennale, Ms. Foman owns a house in Palm Beach and an apartment in Paris, where she intends to install her gaming table.</p>
        <p>''With the American economy so strong, we're inundated with clients from New York and California looking for apartments in Paris,'' said William Holloway, who set up the Paris office for Sotheby's International Realty two years ago.</p>
        <p>''Usually, we show apartments in the half-a-million-to-a-million-dollar range,'' Mr. Holloway explained. ''But with everyone in town for the Biennale, there's more demand for apartments and houses from $1 million to $15 million. I guess when people buy furniture at the Biennale, they figure they need somewhere to put it.''</p>
        <p>To the glee of Parisian dealers,  Henry and Marie-Josee Kravis recently purchased an enormous apartment in the Seventh Arrondissement. The New York financier and his French-Canadian wife discreetly prowled the aisles of the Biennale one afternoon with their French decorator, Francois-Joseph Graf, selecting furniture of impeccable palace provenance.</p>
        <p>Such is the awe -- and sense of financial expectation -- the Kravises aroused that dealers swiftly drew gilded ropes across the entrance of their booths to keep the less affluent away as the formidable threesome stepped in.</p>
        <p>For some, the exotic spending was a little disconcerting. ''The problem is, our museum is so poor,'' lamented E. John Bullard, the director of the New Orleans Museum of Art, after touring the Biennale. ''As a lady on this trip said, 'Twenty-five million dollars barely furnishes a room, does it?' ''</p>
