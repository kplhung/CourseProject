        <p>Challenging broadcasters to open the airwaves to more robust political debate, the federal government today suspended two long-established rules that had required radio and television stations to provide free reply time for opponents of political candidates endorsed by the stations and for candidates and others whose integrity is attacked.</p>
        <p>The rules, the last major vestiges of the fairness doctrine, have been under assault for years by broadcasters and Republican regulators and lawmakers who say they are an unnecessary burden that chills free speech.</p>
        <p>The broadcasters have maintained that the regulations, known as the political editorial and personal attack rules, do not encourage robust debate on controversial issues as they are intended to do.</p>
        <p>Although the government rarely brings cases to enforce the rules, radio and television stations say the rules have the effect of discouraging them from taking editorial positions and airing controversial broadcasts.</p>
        <p>Responding to the latest legal challenge to the rules, a sharply divided Federal Communications Commission announced today that it had suspended them for 60 days to test the broadcasters' proposition and whether, in the absence of the rules, radio and television stations would commit more air time to political and controversial issues without provoking complaints about fairness.</p>
        <p>The agency said that, since national elections are only a few weeks away, it was an ideal time to conduct an experiment to see what effect the suspension of the rules would have on political coverage. Without saying what results might justify repealing the rules, officials suggested that reports of increased air time for political debate and relatively few complaints might indicate that the rules were outdated.</p>
        <p>William E. Kennard, the chairman of the F.C.C., said in an interview that the agency had issued its order because of concern that a federal appeals court would strike down or modify the rules, particularly since until today the agency had been deadlocked over the rules and could not provide the judges with any reliable data about their effect on the industry.</p>
        <p>''It would be irresponsible to leave this to a court,'' Mr. Kennard said. ''It seemed clear that the court was prepared to modify or vacate the rules based on an old, stale record. The majority of Americans still get most of their news and information from broadcasting, and broadcasting remains the main way politicians communicate with the public.</p>
        <p>''And that's why I felt personally before we allowed a court to just vacate the rules on our books for 30 years, we take another look,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But critics of the rules, who have long sought to have them repealed, saw today's suspension as a tactical legal maneuver intended, in the long-run, to preserve, and possibly even expand them.</p>
        <p>Two Republican commissioners who wanted to repeal the rules dissented from the decision, saying that the temporary suspension may coerce the broadcasters to air programs and endorsements they might otherwise have withheld, to prove to regulators that the rules are unnecessary.</p>
        <p>And other critics of the suspension said it had the unfair effect of shifting the legal burden of proof from the government, which is supposed to justify any restrictions on speech, to the industry.</p>
        <p>''It is outrageous that the F.C.C. refuses to discard tired regulations that stifle free speech rather than enhance it,'' said Edward O. Fritts, the president of the National Association of Broadcasters.</p>
        <p>Mark Millage, news director at KELO television, the CBS affiliate in Sioux Falls, S.D., said the commission had ''set up a test in a way that is designed to fail.''</p>
        <p>''We don't have the time to establish the proper process for doing what the F.C.C. is proposing,'' said Mr. Millage, chairman of the Radio Television News Directors Association, one of the industry groups that had filed the lawsuit challenging the rules. ''Newspapers have editorial boards. That's not something you can just slap together. It would be irresponsible.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Millage said KELO does not broadcast editorials or political endorsements, but that it would probably reconsider that position if the F.C.C. rules were permanently repealed.</p>
        <p>Supporters of the political editorial and personal attack rules said today that the commission should not have buckled to court pressure to suspend them. ''The costs of today's order far outweigh any benefits,'' said Andrew J. Schwartzman, president of the Media Access Project, a nonpartisan organization that promotes diversity on the airwaves.</p>
        <p>In recent years, fewer television and radio stations have made political endorsements. Industry executives say this is a result of the rules. Others say it is because it makes more economic sense to use the air time for more commercially attractive programming.</p>
        <p>Both the Supreme Court and the F.C.C. have long rejected the broadcasters' objections to the rules, which were written in the 1920's at the dawn of radio and codified by the agency in 1967.</p>
        <p>The supporters say that the requirements are a fair price for the broadcasters to pay in return for control over the limited and valuable airwaves, and in 1967, a unanimous Supreme Court agreed. It upheld the constitutionality of the two rules at issue today, as well as the broader fairness doctrine.</p>
        <p>The fairness doctrine, which the F.C.C. said today it would consider adopting again, required broadcasters ''to provide coverage of vitally important controversial issues of interest in the community'' and ''to provide a reasonable opportunity for the presentation of contrasting viewpoints on such issues.''</p>
        <p>Most of the elements of the fairness doctrine were repealed by the F.C.C. in 1987, but the political editorial and personal attack rules survived. The rules require that stations provide candidates not endorsed by the station with a reasonable opportunity to reply.</p>
        <p>The rules also give free reply time to candidates or anyone who is the subject of an attack based on ''honesty, character, integrity or like personal qualities.'' News programs are exempt from the rules.</p>
        <p>Four years ago, the broadcasters brought a new lawsuit challenging the rules. A federal appeals court considering that case ordered the F.C.C. to provide a more complete record by last Friday, including better data on the possible chilling effects of the rules.</p>
        <p>It was in response to that request that the commission said today it would suspend the rules.</p>
        <p>The court now has the option of dismissing the lawsuit, striking down the rules or delaying its final decision until after suspension.</p>
        <p>The 3-2 decision breaks a deadlock that had plagued the commission. The two Democratic commissioners, Susan Ness and Gloria Tristani, had voted to retain the rules, while the two Republicans had urged that they be abandoned. Mr. Kennard had disqualified himself from participating in the proceeding because as a young lawyer in the early 1980's, he had helped prepare a legal brief attacking the rules on behalf of the National Association of Broadcasters.</p>
        <p>But two weeks ago, Mr. Kennard reversed course and announced that, because of the appeals court case, he would no longer stand on the sidelines.</p>
        <p>''Of course, elections will be held during the 60-day period, making it an ideal time to determine how broadcasters are affected by the political editorial rule,'' the commission said in its order. ''While less obvious, it is also an ideal time to obtain evidence regarding the effect of the personal attack rule, which was established in a series of cases in the early 1960's involving personal attacks on candidates and elected officials.''</p>
        <p>The commission's Republican members, Michael K. Powell and Harold W. Furchtgott-Roth, dissented from the decision. Mr. Powell, in an opinion endorsed by Mr. Furchtgott-Roth, called the agency's decision ''a day late and a dollar short,'' and said it was ''inappropriately coercive,'' trying to force the broadcasters to prove the weaknesses of the rules by airing more editorials.</p>
        <p>''Knowing that the political editorial rules will be restored at the end of the experimental period, and taking the hint that any hope of the rules being eliminated rests on demonstrating increased political speech, a broadcaster likely will feel he has no choice but to broadcast political editorial content,'' Mr. Powell wrote.</p>
        <p>''I believe this clever device presents the danger of government coercing political speech in the final innings of a major national election.''</p>
