        <p>THE spirit of Barbara Anne Frederiksen Pingree could be found floating around the Internet one day last July. Some people gasped. Others cried. Ms. Pingree had died less than a week earlier of lung cancer at age 69.</p>
        <p>Yet there she was, her essence streaming across the digital ether. At least that's how it felt to Lisa Runolfson, Ms. Pingree's niece, as she sat next to her mother and another aunt in her mountain home above Salt Lake City. They were watching Ms. Pingree's funeral on a computer in the foyer. On the screen, a RealPlayer window only inches wide  showed the mourners, the cedar chest containing the ashes, even Ms. Pingree's 2-year-old great-grandson walking into the chapel in Arizona singing a Danish lullaby. And it was all happening live.</p>
        <p>''We all had martinis and cocktails and watched the funeral,'' Ms. Runolfson said. ''It was beautiful, the fact that we could see it. It made it much easier for my mother to handle the death of her sister.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Runolfson's family could not attend the funeral because of health problems. But streaming video and a camera mounted in the Messinger Indian School Mortuary Home in Scottsdale, Ariz, gave them a seat near the other mourners. They could hear the eulogies and spot the gardenia next to Ms. Pingree's remains.</p>
        <p>Messinger is one of several companies that are exploring the possibilities of doing business online. They are applying cutting-edge technology to that most immutable aspect of human existence: death.</p>
        <p>The trend also points to a convergence of two growth industries. As the baby boomer population grows older, the funeral count from 2010 onward is expected to be higher than in recent decades, and the e-commerce sector is generally on the rise, despite the recent lackluster performance of the Nasdaq technology stock index.</p>
        <p>Entrepreneurs in the realm of grief are exploring a wide range of online options. There are Web sites that charge people to post obituaries and memorials. There are dozens of online coffin and urn vendors eager to provide final resting places. There are ''cremation cams,'' business-to-business companies selling body hoists and embalming fluids, and even an outfit called Celestis that takes out online ads offering to scatter one's ashes in space.</p>
        <p>No one has an exact count of how many funeral-related Web sites are on the Internet. But there is no doubt that the number is growing. One indication is that more Internet businesses have been setting up booths at the annual convention of the National Funeral Directors Association. Only four or five e-commerce companies showed up last year, but twice as many have registered for this year's convention, to be held next week in Baltimore, said Kelly Smith, an association spokesman.</p>
        <p>The American funeral industry pulls in tens of billions of dollars, perhaps as much as $100 billion, each year, Mr. Smith said. Given those numbers and the relative scarcity of funeral-related e-commerce businesses, some financial analysts say that the industry has huge growth potential on the Internet.</p>
        <p>''When it gets that large, it's a no-brainer, it can happen,'' said Tim Clark, a senior analyst at Jupiter Communications, a New York-based company that tracks Internet businesses. ''It's not a surprise at all that funeral homes are going online.''</p>
        <p>Still, many in the industry are not exactly clamoring to break into online commerce. The funeral business has long abided by a tradition of conservatism, as befits a trade that deals with one of the oldest human rituals. Although large corporations have bought a lot of funeral homes in recent decades, most of these businesses are still independent mom-and-pop shops.</p>
        <p>Many funeral directors do not even have fax machines. A recent informal survey done by the funeral directors association showed that more than 60 percent of its 13,500 members did not use e-mail. Most funeral directors are middle-age or older and, as Nancy Keil, a director at Messinger, put it, are ''touchy-feely kind of people.''</p>
        <p>People in the industry also question whether even the most hard-core Internet consumers will go online to knock on funeral home doors. For many people, it might not seem right to incorporate high technology into such a personal and solemn event.</p>
        <p>''What we don't know yet is, How are the younger baby boomers and those folks raised in the computer generation going to integrate the computer into their funeral rituals?'' Mr. Smith said. ''Is the computer going to play an important role such as in Webcasting, or is there a feeling that a funeral is too much of a personal, individual event for computerization?''</p>
        <p>Such thoughts did not deter Mary Ann Turner when she decided to broadcast the funeral of her mother, Ms. Pingree, over the Web. When Ms. Pingree succumbed to cancer in Phoenix, Ms. Turner worried that the funeral would cause hardship for family members who had to travel.</p>
        <p>So when the Messinger funeral home told Ms. Turner that she could broadcast the funeral free over the Web, she jumped at the chance. ''A light came on,'' she said.</p>
        <p>On July 6, more than 50 of Ms. Pingree's friends and relatives across the western United States logged on to the mortuary's Web site. They typed in a password, and the funeral unfolded in streaming video.</p>
        <p>''Because people are so transient these days and so spread out, we thought this was making the world a little smaller,'' Ms. Keil said. ''If you had asked me about this three years ago, I would have said no way. It just seems so far out there, and the funeral service seems so personal. But it's one of the most exciting things that's happened to funerals.''</p>
        <p>But the idea of watching a loved one's last rites on RealPlayer may leave some mourners cold. Since Messinger held its first Webcast last year, only seven other families have taken the funeral home up on its offer. And given today's embryonic Webcast technology and modem speeds, images sometimes freeze or jerk.</p>
        <p>Paradise Memorial Crematory, run by Messinger, also gives families the option of watching a cremation on the Web. The family can witness the body (in a combustible box) being sent down a conveyor belt into  the retort, where, once the doors are closed, the corpse will be turned into ashes. The wall-mounted Cremation-Cam was installed because many potential customers had heard horror stories about crematoriums where the wrong corpse would be cremated or where people would be cremated alongside animals.</p>
        <p>Other funeral businesses are looking into  selling merchandise online. An independent  study recently commissioned by the industry association showed that 1 percent of the 1,000 people surveyed had bought funeral merchandise off the Internet. Despite that  small number, some independent coffin and urn vendors are embracing the Internet as a way to reach customers who might otherwise buy those items from funeral homes.  Many of the online entrepreneurs say they can undercut the prices for comparable models at funeral homes. An estimated two million coffins are sold each year in the United States.</p>
        <p>An online shopper can presumably avoid the aggressive sales tactics used by some funeral homes. Some people even print price lists found on the Internet and use them to negotiate with local funeral directors. A federal law requires funeral homes to serve customers even if they have bought coffins elsewhere.</p>
        <p>Alex Frost, the owner of WebCaskets.com, said he sold 40 to 50 coffins per month. His site, which is at webcaskets.com and is run from Newport Beach, Calif., advertises more than 400 models.</p>
        <p>They range from a cloth-covered coffin for $560 to a bronze model that weighs only three pounds and costs more than $6,400. Somewhere in between is a reddish wood model called the Buckingham, which became a recent best seller on the site. Like Amazon.com and other e-commerce ventures, Mr. Frost's business has a warehouse to store its most popular models.</p>
        <p>''To some degree, there will always be a part of the population that will do this face to face,'' Mr. Frost said. ''But what we've learned is that there are not a lot of people comfortable shopping around during the time of the funeral. When someone dies, you don't want to go to funeral homes comparing prices.''</p>
        <p>Most of the people who buy coffins online do so when a family member has just died or is about to die, Mr. Frost said.</p>
        <p>Some funeral Web sites are also handling business-to-business transactions. These usually involve sales between funeral directors and vendors of funeral equipment. HeavenlyDoor.com, for instance, is trying to establish itself as a clearinghouse for all funeral-related matters. The site provides a range of services, like providing links to newspaper obituaries (heavenlydoor.com).</p>
        <p>The Web site charges funeral homes about $250 per year for the creation of a home page that is linked to Heavenlydoor.com and can be viewed by consumers and other businesses. About 400 homes have signed on, although fewer than a quarter have set up home pages so far. (One database manager said that it had been tough getting design information from funeral directors because many of them are still leery of the Internet.) This fall, HeavenlyDoor.com plans to open an online marketplace where funeral directors and vendors will be able to do business; the Web site will make a commission on each transaction.</p>
        <p>''Let's say there's a person who's 500 pounds and dies,'' said Andrew Weissberg, a marketing consultant for the company. ''There are not a lot of casket manufacturers who make them for fat people. But a vendor can negotiate through our site.''</p>
        <p>HeavenlyDoor.com plans to make available through its Web site a full range of funeral equipment, like embalming fluids, body hoists and hearses. But relatives or friends of someone who has died will not be able to order items like coffins directly from the vendors. They will have to make the purchases through funeral homes.</p>
        <p>Still, consumers can enter the online Heavenly Store and browse through memorial cards, rosary beads, flowers and grief-support books. The company is also trying to set up a funeral planning system, something that many industry insiders see as having a lot of potential for growth. HeavenlyDoor.com's service would allow people to plan their own funerals by browsing through the Web sites of funeral homes and filling out electronic forms that specify matters like coffin selections and clergy choices.</p>
        <p>But most funeral-related Web sites are sticking with simple business models for now. Many of these deal in online obituaries or memorials. The written testaments are often short, but they can sometimes go on and on, taking advantage of the Internet's infinite number of pages. Some sites also let people post photographs or audio snippets.</p>
        <p>LifeFiles.com, based in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., is testing two pieces of online obituary software that it plans to sell through funeral homes (www.lifefiles.com). The first, called Remembrance Registry, is tentatively priced at $195; it will let mourners set up Web sites on LifeFiles.com's server for six months. Each family can post an obituary, display funeral service information and create a guest book where visitors can leave messages up to 350 words long.</p>
        <p>The second piece of software is a glorified version of the registry, called Lifelegacy. For a tentative price of $295, the family can create a long-term Internet memorial to the deceased. It stays on the server for two years and can be renewed for $29.95 per month afterward.</p>
        <p>The software prompts family members to write profiles of their dead relatives, aiding them with questions aimed at drawing out memories. ''We had to design something that would work for both a plumber and a poet,'' said Bert Oliver, a senior vice president at the company.</p>
        <p>Visitors to the memorial Web site can post photographs and write their own testaments to the dead person.</p>
        <p>''We were told that the No. 1 grief relief for humans is writing,'' Mr. Oliver said. ''No. 2 is talking, but then you need a good listener.''</p>
        <p>But like all the other Internet ventures related to the funeral industry, online obituaries are a relatively young phenomenon. There is no telling to what degree people will embrace this alchemy of digital technology, mourning and remembrance. In theory, a virtual memorial has the potential to outlast something as transitory as a newspaper obituary or a flower left at a grave site. But then again, even such a creation is subject to the capricious workings of human memory.</p>
