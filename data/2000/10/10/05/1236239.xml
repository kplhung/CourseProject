        <p>A mammoth laser project at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory will apparently not have to be halted, as proponents had feared, after Congress this week nearly tripled its original budget for the 2001 fiscal year to cover large cost overruns and construction delays.</p>
        <p>''Frankly, it was nothing short of a miracle,'' Representative Ellen O. Tauscher, a California Democrat whose district includes the laboratory, said of the sharp increase that she supported.</p>
        <p>She said the increase had to overcome opposition from members of Congress who said that project officials had not been forthcoming on the likely costs of the project and that the move would not have been possible without the nation's budget surplus this year.</p>
        <p>Called the National Ignition Facility, the project is designed to train 192 converging laser beams on pellets of nuclear fuel like hydrogen, crushing and heating them in order to set off tiny thermonuclear explosions. Officials at the laboratory and the Department of Energy, which runs it, hope that those experiments will help them study nuclear weapons without testing them in much larger explosions.</p>
        <p>But the projected cost of the laser has ballooned to $4 billion, nearly $1 billion more than originally expected, after laboratory officials greatly underestimated the complexity of the project and then did not report growing problems to the Energy Department and Congress.</p>
        <p>The officials have said the overruns grew out of management problems that have been corrected, while critics maintain that the laser still has technical difficulties.</p>
        <p>The officials said the Clinton administration's original request for the project in 2001, $74 million, would have forced it to shut down.</p>
        <p>In votes on Thursday and Monday, the House and Senate approved an increase to $199 million. The money is part of an energy and water bill that still is subject to approval by President Clinton. The bill faces a veto threat because of an unrelated environmental dispute, but Congressional aides say the laser financing will almost certainly remain intact in any agreement.</p>
        <p>Clay Sell, a staff member on the energy and water subcommittee of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said $60 million of the increase amounted to new financing, while the rest came from other weapons programs at Livermore.</p>
        <p>The increase had strings attached, including heightened oversight of the project and a study to determine whether the project could be replaced by a smaller version with fewer laser beams, or a cheaper alternative based on different technology.</p>
        <p>Madelyn Creedon, the deputy administrator for defense programs at the Energy Department's National Nuclear Security Administration, said she believed the full-scale project was ''essential for keeping our nuclear weapons reliable and safe.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Tauscher said that while the management of the project had been ''terribly bungled'' she believed that those problems had now been fixed and that the science behind the laser was sound.</p>
