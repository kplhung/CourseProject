        <p>The New York Post, which is in the midst of a heated price competition with The Daily News, has disciplined one of its pressmen for ''his role in fomenting the deliberate slowdown of operations,'' according to a memorandum last Friday from the newspaper's publisher, Ken Chandler.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chandler wrote, ''This disruption comes at a time when we are combating a challenge from The Daily News with its new, free afternoon edition,'' called The Daily News Express. Mr. Chandler also limited lunch breaks and overtime for all pressmen, and forced the union chairman to work on the production crew.</p>

        <p>The New York Post, which is in the midst of a heated price competition with The Daily News, has disciplined one of its pressmen for ''his role in fomenting the deliberate slowdown of operations,'' according to a memorandum last Friday from the newspaper's publisher, Ken Chandler.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chandler wrote, ''This disruption comes at a time when we are combating a challenge from The Daily News with its new, free afternoon edition,'' called The Daily News Express. Mr. Chandler also limited lunch breaks and overtime for all pressmen, and forced the union chairman to work on the production crew.</p>
        <p>According to those familiar with the situation, the unofficial slowdown began in mid-September in response to union members' anger over a new labor agreement.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chandler would not comment on the memorandum except to say, ''The letter speaks for itself.''</p>
        <p>Efforts to reach officials of the printers' union by telephone last night were unsuccessful.</p>

        <p>METRO BUSINESS  Correction:  October 7, 2000, Saturday  A brief report in the Metro Business column on Thursday about a New York Post pressman who was disciplined for engaging in a slowdown referred incorrectly to his union. It is the pressmen's union -- formally the New York Newspaper Printing Pressmen's Union No. 2 -- not the printers' union.</p>
