        <p>Editorial scores Senate-passed bill to criminalize disclosure by government officials of all 'properly classified' information; holds government classifies far too much information, often just to cover up embarrassments or misdeeds; urges House conferees to block measure</p>

        <p>American government officials can go to jail for disclosing certain kinds of classified information. It is a crime to reveal secrets about nuclear weapons, codes and intelligence communication or the names of covert agents. It is also a crime to leak information that could injure national defense, although this is seldom prosecuted. But a bill passed on Monday by the Senate would criminalize the disclosure of all ''properly classified'' information. It is an overly broad proposal that would deprive the public of information vital to national debates on serious issues.</p>
        <p>The Central Intelligence Agency has tried for years to get Congress to criminalize all leaks of classified information. The Justice Department under President Clinton has resisted in the past, but endorses the current bill. Justice Department officials argue that the bill is now narrower, because it applies only to ''properly classified'' information.</p>

        <p>American government officials can go to jail for disclosing certain kinds of classified information. It is a crime to reveal secrets about nuclear weapons, codes and intelligence communication or the names of covert agents. It is also a crime to leak information that could injure national defense, although this is seldom prosecuted. But a bill passed on Monday by the Senate would criminalize the disclosure of all ''properly classified'' information. It is an overly broad proposal that would deprive the public of information vital to national debates on serious issues.</p>
        <p>The Central Intelligence Agency has tried for years to get Congress to criminalize all leaks of classified information. The Justice Department under President Clinton has resisted in the past, but endorses the current bill. Justice Department officials argue that the bill is now narrower, because it applies only to ''properly classified'' information.</p>
        <p>But this is not a narrow category -- it means all information classified according to the law. The Pentagon Papers were ''properly classified.'' The total figure for the nation's intelligence budget was classified until 1997. Then it was released for two years. But now it is classified again -- ''properly classified,'' the courts have ruled.</p>
        <p>Far too much information is classified by the government already. Recent Congressional disclosures about the C.I.A.'s role in Chile shows once again that some classified information is kept secret only to cover up government embarrassments or misdeeds -- information the public has a right to know. House members should block this measure in the House-Senate conference. It is wrong to criminalize the release of information crucial to a full debate about serious public issues.</p>
