        <p>The Nets' top draft pick, Kenyon Martin, rolled his right ankle in practice yesterday morning after he and the free agent Kevin Freeman became entangled during a three-on-one drill. Everyone on hand seemed to gasp.</p>
        <p>But Martin, who broke his right leg and tore ligaments in the ankle in his final game with the University of Cincinnati in March, sprang up, then watched the rest of the practice and sat out last night's practice. He will play in tonight's session.</p>
        <p>Kendall Gill developed bursitis in his right elbow and had to have it drained. Forward Aaron Williams did not pratice because he needed to have both toes drained again; he was stepped on during a scrimmage last Friday.</p>
        <p>Lucious Harris, the backup shooting guard, will undergo hernia surgery tomorrow, and the reserve forward-center Jamie Feick will have surgery on his left Achilles' tendon on Monday.</p>
