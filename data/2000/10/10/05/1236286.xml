        <p>His juggernaut had stalled and Joe Torre figured it was time for change, and there was nothing conventional about the decisions he made tonight other than to rely, again, on Andy Pettitte.</p>
        <p>Torre, the Yankees' manager, allowed Glenallen Hill to bat in the sixth inning when numbers and logic screamed for him to make a change, and Hill drove in the first run. Torre benched Chuck Knoblauch and stuck with Luis Sojo at second base, and Sojo had two runs batted in. And Pettitte gave the Yankees exactly what they needed, shutting out Oakland for seven and two-thirds innings in a 4-0 victory that revitalized Torre's team in this American League division series.</p>
        <p>The Yankees and Athletics are tied at 1-1 in their three-of-five-game series; Orlando Hernandez will face Oakland's Tim Hudson in Game 3 Friday night in Yankee Stadium.</p>
        <p>The Yankees had not won a game in 10 days and this victory serves to relax them. As they ate and dressed after the game, they could laugh and joke about the replay of Sojo's goofy eighth-inning error that could have led to disaster. In short, they seemed like themselves again. ''This was a huge game for us,'' Pettitte said.</p>
        <p>Torre treated it that way. The Yankees' desperation was growing and Torre decided to change his lineup radically, benching Knoblauch, inserting Hill as the designated hitter, promoting Derek Jeter to the leadoff spot, moving David Justice up to the No. 3 slot and Paul O'Neill down to the No. 6 spot. All kinds of changes. Torre told the team's principal owner, George Steinbrenner, about them by phone today. ''Good,'' Steinbrenner responded.</p>
        <p>Nothing worked at first. O'Neill came to bat in the first inning, bases loaded and two out, squinting in the shadows to see Oakland's Kevin Appier. O'Neill was mumbling to himself, appearing to say, ''Come on, come on.'' But he lifted a looping liner to right, and while Oakland right fielder Adam Piatt battled the glare of the setting sun to make the catch, O'Neill barely moved up the first-base line, rigid with frustration.</p>
        <p>The Yankees did not have any base runners in the second or third innings, and when Bernie Williams led off the fourth with a single, Torre lifted the choke on his offense, trying to get it started, putting Williams in motion on a hit-and-run with one out. But Williams was thrown out at second -- replays showed he was actually safe -- and the Yankees could not advance Sojo the next inning, after he led off with a walk.</p>
        <p>The Yankees had no runs after five innings, drought conditions again, and their pre-eminence seemed to be hanging in the balance; a loss in this game, some of the Yankees agreed before the game, would be devastating, a body blow to a team in pursuit of its third consecutive World Series title.</p>
        <p>It was a good thing for the Yankees that Pettitte was pitching. October tends to grab Pettitte's wandering attention, and he appeared in a deep trance facing the Athletics tonight, staring in for the sign. Like his idol, Roger Clemens, Pettitte decided not to shave before the game, to minimal effect; Clemens has a forest of facial hair, Pettitte a few seedlings.</p>
        <p>Oakland had runners at first and third in the first inning -- once again, the Athletics had brazenly and successfully challenged O'Neill's throwing arm -- and Olmedo Saenz bounced to third to start a double play. Saenz was the first of 13 straight Oakland batters who would not reach base.</p>
        <p>With one out in the sixth, Williams turned on a pitch inside and smashed a liner down the right-field line for a double. Tino Martinez whiffed for the second out. Oakland Manager Art Howe ambled to the mound to discuss the options. O'Neill, a left-handed batter, was due to bat. He was hitless in his last 17 at-bats, dating from Sept. 27. The right-handed-hitting Hill was on deck, coming off the worst at-bat of any player in this series: Appier had closed out the fourth inning by throwing three sliders to Hill, who had swung and missed badly on all of them.</p>
        <p>''We felt like our best shot was going after Glenallen,'' Howe said later.</p>
        <p>Now Torre had a decision. At that moment, Hill had only two hits in 14 at-bats in his career against Appier, with strikeouts in three of his last four at-bats. Luis Polonia, sitting on Torre's bench, had 22 hits in 63 career at-bats against Appier, for a .349 average. Knoblauch had good career numbers against Appier as well. ''There's no question that everything crosses your mind,'' Torre said.  ''When you make a commitment, we just decided, let's stay with him.''</p>
        <p>Hill saw Oakland catcher Ramon Hernandez set up for the intentional walk; big mistake, he thought to himself. Hill had been overeager in his first two at-bats, as if he were swinging 500 miles an hour, he said, and the ball were being thrown 2 m.p.h. Hill went to the plate looking for an off-speed pitch, and when Appier threw a slider, Hill smacked a bounding single through the middle, scoring Williams. Several of the Yankees burst from their dugout, shouting, Jeter clapping as he greeted Williams. The Yankees had a lead.</p>
        <p>Sojo then hacked at a fastball with that awkward, off-balance swing of his and drove a grounder past the dive of first baseman Jason Giambi, and Yankees circled the bases --  O'Neill came across the plate first, the first time he has scored a run since Sept. 12, and Hill followed. ''There was a little bit of luck there,'' Sojo said later, through a smile. Three runs in all for the Yankees, no small accomplishment.</p>
        <p>Pettitte had pitched with economy, limiting the pitches he threw inning to inning. Eric Chavez doubled to open the sixth and Pettitte retired the next three batters. Oakland had runners at first and second with one out in the seventh and Ben Grieve bounced into a double play. Pettitte drew back his left hand, made a fist, and jabbed at the air. The Yankees had counterpunched, the dynasty still standing, Round 3 on Friday.</p>
        <p>There was one brief goose-bumped moment in the eighth. Oakland had a runner at second and two out, and Sojo fielded a routine ground ball and stepped to throw to first -- and his right foot caught on the shoelaces of his left foot, and he fell down. Oakland had two runners now, and Mariano Rivera relieved Pettitte. Sojo, embarrassed, would not go to the mound during the change, standing next to Umpire Paul Schrieber. ''What are you laughing at?'' Sojo asked the ump.</p>
        <p>Oakland's Randy Velarde chopped a grounder toward third; when it took an awkward hop, Scott Brosius knocked it down with his bare hand and threw to first. The Yankees added a run in the top of the ninth, and they all chuckled about Sojo and his feet. Maybe a time will come when they can laugh about that season-ending losing streak, too.</p>
