        <p>Eight years ago Claire Marie Panke set out to make a film about the daily drama inside the intensive care unit for newborns at St. Vincents Hospital in Greenwich Village, where nurses and parents struggle to save and nurture sick, fragile and underweight babies.</p>
        <p>Now, days before its premiere on national television, Ms. Panke's film has suddenly taken on a newly tragic dimension, as the nursing staff at that neonatal unit mourns the death of four of its own, killed in a car accident in Virginia.</p>
        <p>''It is all so fragile,'' said Ms. Panke, who has worked as a nurse in the unit, full time and then part time, since 1989. ''Which in the end is what the film is all about.''</p>
        <p>The nurses, who died when the car in which they were riding plunged off a parking garage roof in Virginia Beach, were not stars of Ms. Panke's film, although they appeared in the background in several scenes. But the four -- Mary Ann Dono, 60; Mary Ann Going, 60; Kathleen Mollick-Kelly, 63; and Joan Ellen Walsh, 56, who had worked at St. Vincents for a combined 158 years -- were a major influence on a unit that is known for professional and emotional cohesiveness.</p>
        <p>The women, who were close friends, had gone to St. Vincents nursing school together and worked together throughout their careers. They served as a professional yardstick for others who worked with them. Ms. Walsh was Ms. Panke's boss for almost 10 years, and Ms. Going had worked at St. Vincents since 1961, the year after Ms. Panke was born.</p>
        <p>''As one of the nurses said the other night, we have worked together longer than most marriages,'' said Ms. Panke, herself a child of St. Vincents, where her father worked as a doctor and where she was born. ''Attrition has historically been very low.''</p>
        <p>So now the film, conceived as an account of three infants and their families as they made their traumatic journey in and out of the neonatal unit, is serving as a tribute to the nurses who dedicated their life's work to those babies and thousands like them.</p>
        <p>The film, titled ''A Baby's Battle for Life,'' ( Ms. Panke's original title was a ''A Chance to Grow'') will be shown on the Discovery Channel on Saturday night at 9.</p>
        <p>After graduating from Georgetown University with an degree in English, Ms. Panke found herself drawn to neonatal nursing. ''It is so intimate, so intense, because the patients can't speak for themselves, because the emotions swing so quickly from joy to despair and back again,'' she said. ''You are dealing with patients who stay with you for three months, even more. I thought that it was a good fit for me, intellectually and emotionally.''</p>
        <p>But even as she worked full time at St. Vincents, Ms. Panke used her free time to return to a high school passion for film and photography. ''People keep asking me how I do nursing and filmmaking,'' she said. ''The connecting point is the human story.''</p>
        <p>The film had a difficult start. At one point a nonprofit corporation overseeing money that Ms. Panke had collected for her film went bankrupt, and she had to halt production for almost a year. She was later able to recoup some of that money and received a grant from the New York State Council on the Arts. The Discovery Channel finally stepped in as a co-producer in return for television rights and helped finance the final editing.</p>
        <p>As a nurse and as a filmmaker, Ms. Panke said she felt at times as if she were split in two. Once she was filming a scene when the unit was suddenly overwhelmed by the emergency delivery of quadruplets, who were then followed by triplets, all seven of them seriously underweight. ''I wanted to step back and get in there and help, but I was filming,'' said Ms. Panke.</p>
        <p>Another time she caught a glimpse of an infant's father sitting by himself, clutching a stuffed animal, while the baby, sealed off in an isolette, was undergoing another in a series of medical crises. ''There was the father holding the teddy bear while 15 other people were hovering over his son,'' she said. ''And he couldn't do anything. At that moment he was helpless. He was a child. And I remember thinking, where is my camera?''</p>
        <p>What continued to guide her was the melding of two instincts, one to observe the joy and anguish experienced by the families and the other to help them and shield them as they underwent the experience.</p>
        <p>''There were moments when my cameraman would say, 'This is it, we should stay and film,' and I would say, 'No, this is the moment when we turn off the camera and go,' '' she said. ''In the end the families trusted me because they knew I was not going to exploit them. To borrow someone's else phrase, there is a difference between stealing someone else's story and sharing it.''</p>
        <p>The result is a film that mixes tenderness and realism as it tracks a single mother and two couples coping with babies who were born so sick and weak that for weeks they could not be held or removed from the battery of tubes and machines that had become their lifelines.</p>
        <p>In the film one father describes how he would duck the usual questions from friends and colleagues about his new baby's birth weight, which was less than two pounds. ''You don't want to know,'' he said. Later he describes how he decided to put aside his anxieties over his son's precarious health and indulge in the pure joy of fatherhood.</p>
        <p>The nurses, too, are on a roller coaster. One minute they must make complex split-second decision about saving a life, knowing the baby could later be faced with a lifetime of physical and mental disabilities, and the next minute they may have to hold the hand of a mother who after weeks of struggle is watching her baby die.</p>
        <p>Like the filmmaker, the nurse has to know when to stand back, Ms. Panke said. ''No one wants a sappy neonatal nurse,'' she said. ''You have to be both compassionate and competent.''</p>
        <p>''We've found ourselves in a situation where technology can run away with us,'' she said. ''We have to slow down and get over to the low-tech side. And here both parents and nurses have a lot to teach each other.''</p>
