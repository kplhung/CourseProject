        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>When it comes to finding a college, there's no substitute for the real thing. With the financial stakes constantly rising -- four-year tuition is projected to exceed $135,000 by 2005 -- actually seeing colleges can hardly seem retrograde. As president of LifeTrails Inc., I'd like to say that guided campus tours like ours, with admissions seminars, give students and parents real-life exposure to campuses and face-to-face instruction on the admissions process. Web research is great for finding options; live confirmation may be even more critical.</p>
