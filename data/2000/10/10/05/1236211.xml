        <p>In the third departure in a week of a top executive from Carnegie Hall, the director of artistic planning resigned yesterday.</p>
        <p>The resignation of Kristin Lancino, who had worked at the hall for 10 years, followed the departure last week of David Kitto, the director of marketing and a 17-year employee, and Jennifer Wada, the public relations director and an employee for 18 years.</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>In the third departure in a week of a top executive from Carnegie Hall, the director of artistic planning resigned yesterday.</p>
        <p>The resignation of Kristin Lancino, who had worked at the hall for 10 years, followed the departure last week of David Kitto, the director of marketing and a 17-year employee, and Jennifer Wada, the public relations director and an employee for 18 years.</p>
        <p>Franz Xaver Ohnesorg, a Bavarian who was appointed executive director more than a year ago, characterized the departures in a statement as part of ''an evolutionary process of a dynamic institution poised for yet another period of great and exciting growth.''</p>
        <p>But an anonymous letter addressed to a variety of news organizations complained about low morale and blamed the current management, which they said showed a ''lack of stewardship,'' for the departures. And several employees, who requested anonymity saying they feared reprisals, said in interviews that the letter gave a true picture of the situation.</p>
        <p>Ms. Lancino's resignation was announced to Carnegie Hall's trustees yesterday along with a description of  management restructuring, which included the hiring of a new chief information officer and a new editor of the hall's internal publications.</p>
        <p>As the director of artistic planning, Ms. Lancino helped select Carnegie performers and was responsible for artist relations. She did not respond to messages seeking comment, and the other departed executives declined to comment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ohnesorg, the former director of the Cologne Philharmonie, assumed the position of executive and artistic director at Carnegie Hall in September 1999, succeeding Judith Arron, who died in December 1998.</p>
        <p>Since his appointment, Mr. Ohnesorg has presided over the ambitious reconstruction of a new theater under the main auditorium of Carnegie Hall. The performance space will be named for Mrs. Arron and the overall hall for Judy and Arthur Zankel, who gave $10 million toward the estimated $50 million construction cost.</p>
        <p>This week, Mr. Zankel, the vice chairman of the board, expressed his support for Mr. Ohnesorg.</p>
        <p>''We've got a new fellow in there and he's doing what new people do,'' Mr. Zankel said. ''There's no board problem with Xaver. Everybody loves him. I think there are some personnel changes and some people have quit and some people may have not quit.''</p>
        <p>''That is what happens when you change heads,'' he said. ''Some like the new person. Some don't. I haven't seen anything that one would remotely describe as wholesale departures.''</p>
