        <p>Following are excerpts from an interview today with Vice President Al Gore on foreign policy issues, as recorded by The New York Times:</p>
        <p>MR. GORE -- Let's take the case of Bosnia. Here we had the most violent and bloody war in Europe since World War II, in an area of Europe that spawned the conflicts that became World War I. A growing instability that threatened to touch off a chain reaction that would spill over border after border and lead to a much wider conflict and disorder. And at the heart of the festering wound was what they called, in the repugnant phrase they coined, ethnic cleansing. It was a hard decision for the United States to get involved. But it was in my view, clearly, the right decision.</p>
        <p>Q.  Was it too late?</p>
        <p>A.  It was later than it should have been. But it wasn't too late, no.</p>

        <p>Following are excerpts from an interview today with Vice President Al Gore on foreign policy issues, as recorded by The New York Times:</p>
        <p>MR. GORE -- Let's take the case of Bosnia. Here we had the most violent and bloody war in Europe since World War II, in an area of Europe that spawned the conflicts that became World War I. A growing instability that threatened to touch off a chain reaction that would spill over border after border and lead to a much wider conflict and disorder. And at the heart of the festering wound was what they called, in the repugnant phrase they coined, ethnic cleansing. It was a hard decision for the United States to get involved. But it was in my view, clearly, the right decision.</p>
        <p>Q.  Was it too late?</p>
        <p>A.  It was later than it should have been. But it wasn't too late, no.</p>
        <p>And I think our country should feel very proud of what we did. Without the loss of a single American life in combat, we brought the bloodshed to an end, and gave them the chance to rebuild their lives and their communities.</p>
        <p>Q.  Mr. Bush made nation-building a point of difference with you.</p>
        <p>A.  I think that phrase taps into a legitimate concern about how far we should go and how long we should be involved. But it's not a new mission. The Marshall Plan was about nation-building. And the generation that won World War II, having seen the catastrophe of the interwar period in the 20's and 30's, wisely decided that nation-building was a preferable alternative to World War III. And it was a stunning success.</p>
        <p>I spoke in Berlin on the 50th anniversary of World War II, of the end of the war in Europe, and quoted Eisenhower, who said to a group of journalists at his headquarters after the end of the war in Europe, when he was in Germany, he said the real verdict on this war will come 50 years from now, if the people of Germany are genuinely free and able to govern themselves in peace. And quoting from his pithy telegram to the president as the war ended, he said, ''Mission accomplished.'' That was his only expression. . . .</p>
        <p>In recalling his prediction that we would only know the outcome 50 years from now, I said to the Germans on behalf of a new generation of Americans and Germans, I said to General Eisenhower across the decades, ''General, mission accomplished.''</p>
        <p>And I think that was nation-building. We had people in the little towns of Germany helping to establish administrative procedures and reconstitute the courts. My father for a time was actually one of them, in the Army. So this is not really a new mission.</p>
        <p>Q.  On Cuba, it is very possible that the next president would witness a change in regime there, simply by the passing of the current leader.</p>
        <p>A.  I hope so.</p>
        <p>Q.  What strategy would you as president adopt now to help bring Cuba to a soft landing, democratization? And, short term, would you press for the lifting of sanctions?</p>
        <p>A.  No. No. I'm a hardliner on Castro. I still find it incomprehensible that he would release mentally ill criminals, prone to violence, onto an innocent population here in the United States with a wave of murder, rape and all manner of violent crimes going all the way up I-95 three years afterwards. I find his whole penchant for repression and his whole style abhorrent.</p>
        <p>Q.  The North Koreans have not exactly been great players in the world, but we have regularly been lifting sanctions.</p>
        <p>A.  Incredibly enough, we have seen a positive response to initiatives there. We have been asking Castro to have elections for a long time. They are very different situations.</p>
        <p>The strategy for getting North Korea off its nuclear bent has yielded some tentative positive results. And, of course, the jury is still out, to say the least. But the second-ranking official in North Korea has now scheduled a visit to Washington. We have seen a very emotional beginning of rapprochement on the peninsula. There is clearly a desire to explore the changes that would make it possible for them to have a more normal relationship with the rest of the world.</p>
        <p>While they have been moving haltingly in the right direction, Cuba has been moving headlong in the wrong direction. The repression has actually increased in Cuba. There have been more arrests. . . .</p>
        <p>But I do not favor any openings to the Castro government.</p>
        <p>Q.  On Russian president Vladimir Putin --</p>
        <p>A.  I am very troubled by his apparent backtracking on press freedom for Russia in the postcommunist era. I am very troubled obviously by their conduct in Chechnya.</p>
        <p>We have to put first things first, and recognize that the United States has an abiding interest in continuing to manage the nuclear threat, and we should not ever forget that Russia has thousands of nuclear warheads and the delivery systems capable of targeting them on the United States. . . .</p>
        <p>There is all kinds of leverage. We are very deeply involved in helping them construct the institutions of a free society, helping them write their basic contract law, helping them put in place basic accounting standards, helping them establish security and safety procedures for the storage of weapons-grade nuclear material, helping them figure out how to work with us on the problems associated with terrorism around the world.</p>
        <p>We just completed an effort on disaster assistance. The space station, of course, is one of the flagship cooperative efforts. So we certainly have leverage with them, there's no question about that. And they do listen. They do listen to us. There are limits to the use of leverage.</p>
