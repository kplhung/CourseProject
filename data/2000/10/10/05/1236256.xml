        <p>Neil Kraft, a well-known figure in fashion and fragrance advertising, is opening his own agency, KraftWorks in New York, after leaving Frierson Mee &amp; Kraft in New York, which he joined in 1998 as a partner and creative director.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kraft and John Frierson, president at Frierson Mee &amp; Kraft, confirmed a report about the changes this week in Adweek. They attributed Mr. Kraft's departure to a difference of opinion regarding the future direction of the agency as a minority stake is being sold to a larger New York shop, Kirshenbaum Bond &amp; Partners. James Hitchcock, 37, a creative director at Kirshenbaum Bond, will succeed Mr. Kraft as creative director at Frierson Mee &amp; Kraft, which is being renamed Frierson Mee &amp; Partners.</p>
        <p>One initial client of KraftWorks is likely to be In Style magazine, part of the Time Inc. unit of Time Warner Inc. in New York, which had recently been searching for an agency to handle creative assignments that include promoting the magazine as well as a planned Web site. Before Mr. Kraft left Frierson Mee &amp; Kraft, that agency was a finalist in the search, which is being managed by Advice and Advisors in New York.</p>
