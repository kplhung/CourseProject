        <p>A longtime Cuban intelligence official who had broken with his government and sought political refuge here was arrested by armed immigration agents on Tuesday night and deported to Cuba this morning, government officials and human-rights advocates said today.</p>
        <p>The Cuban, Pedro Riera Escalante, had been stationed here as a diplomat, in the post of consul in the Cuban Embassy, from 1986 to 1991. His legal representatives in Mexico City also identified him as a major in the Cuban intelligence service who was seeking political asylum. He told The New York Times little more than an hour before he was arrested that he wanted to leave Cuba for a safe haven and feared for his life if he fell into the hands of his old service.</p>
        <p>After that meeting, late Tuesday afternoon, Mr. Riera went to see a Mexican national security official, Jose Luis Baez, to pursue his asylum request. He was accompanied by an exiled Cuban journalist, Edelmiro Castellanos.</p>
        <p>Mr. Castellanos said the meeting, at Sanborn's, a popular restaurant, ended with Mr. Baez's assurances that ''we expect a prompt solution to this problem.'' Minutes later, at 6:15, seven armed men seized Mr. Riera on the sidewalk, shoved him into an unmarked white van, and drove away, Mr. Castellanos said.</p>
        <p>A Mexican official said today that the armed men were immigration agents who held Mr. Riera overnight and put him on a commercial flight to Havana this morning. Mr. Riera was ''illegally in Mexico'' and had been deported, the official said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Riera left Cuba clandestinely about six weeks ago. He had been petitioning Mexico for asylum for a month, meeting with senior Foreign Ministry and national security officials, said Rafael Alvarez, a human-rights advocate. The Foreign Ministry confirmed those meetings and Mr. Riera's request for refuge.</p>
        <p>''The only response he got to his request for asylum in Mexico was his disappearance and deportation,'' said Mr. Alvarez, who called the Mexican government's conduct a violation of international law.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry said Mr. Riera's request had been sent to the Interior Ministry, which handles state security. In a statement, the Interior Ministry said  Mr. Riera's rights had been respected during his detention, because officials from the Cuban Embassy were present when he was questioned.</p>
        <p>In conversations in Mexico City with his advocates, Mr. Castellanos and two reporters, Mr. Riera, 49, said he started working as a spy in 1973. He was in Europe, Africa and Mexico, and ran operations aimed at discrediting or disrupting the Central Intelligence Agency, he said.</p>
        <p>He told the Mexican rights advocates who were representing him that his work in Mexico, under cover as a diplomat from 1986 to 1991, included recruiting and managing agents, among them Mexican officials, who collaborated with the Cuban government.</p>
        <p>But in 1991, he said, his cover was blown by TV Marti, the anti-Castro television station based in the United States that broadcasts to Cuba. He returned to Cuba.</p>
        <p>He said his faith in Mr. Castro had suffered ''three shocks.'' First, he said, was the purge of his uncle, Anibal Escalante, a Communist leader in Cuba before Mr. Castro's 1959 revolution. Mr. Castro fell out with Mr. Escalante in the 1960's and denounced him on television. Mr. Riera said he admired his uncle and was hurt by the attack. Ever since, he said, ''the Escalante name brings Fidel Castro bad memories.''</p>
        <p>Second, he said, was when his own service began to investigate him in 1989 for advocating reforms like greater freedom to travel for Cubans.</p>
        <p>The third, and most devastating, shock was the summary trial and execution of a top general, Arnaldo Ochoa, and a senior intelligence official, Antonio de la Guardia, in 1989. Mr. Riera said the episode shattered a highly effective intelligence agency, leaving many officers demoralized and bewildered. He said that in the 90's, the intelligence service degenerated into an instrument of internal repression serving mainly to protect Mr. Castro's power.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, in the conversation shortly before his arrest, he was worried and tense. He spoke of the case of Florentino Aspillaga Lombard, like himself a major in the spy service, who defected to the United States in 1987. In 1988 in London, a Cuban official tried to shoot Mr. Aspillaga, but missed. Mr. Riera said Cuban intelligence officials had orders to shoot Mr. Aspillaga on sight.</p>
        <p>As he ended the conversation, he said he worried that Mexico might deny him asylum, forcing him to seek safety in another country -- not the United States. He said his biggest fear was falling into the hands of his own service.</p>
        <p>Correction:  October 6, 2000, Friday  A front-page contents entry yesterday about a Cuban intelligence official who was seeking refuge in Mexico misstated his relationship to the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City. He was a consul there from 1986 until 1991, not recently.</p>
