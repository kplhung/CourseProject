      <block class="full_text">
        <p>The mother is 32. The daughter is 16. Do the math.</p>
        <p>Lorelai Gilmore was just 16 herself when she gave birth to her daughter, Rory. Mother and daughter, still trying to grow up together, are the title characters of ''Gilmore Girls,'' a likable if lightweight not-too-dramatic series that begins tonight on the WB network.</p>
        <p>Here's the back story: When Lorelai (Lauren Graham) found she was pregnant she refused to marry her boyfriend and bolted from her filthy-rich parents (but not from their picture-perfect Connecticut town), vowing to make it on her own. She got a job as a maid in a quaint country inn and has now worked her way up to manager of the place, where the staff includes a couple of zany made-for-television characters. Meanwhile Rory (Alexis Bledel) has grown into a levelheaded young woman who must occasionally play the parent to her impetuous mother.</p>
        <p>Now Rory has been admitted to a prestigious prep school, which will help her realize her dream of attending Harvard and getting the education that Lorelai never . . .</p>
        <p>Hey! No fair filling in the plot yourself. You haven't already seen the pilot, have you?</p>
        <p>Anyway, the tuition at the prep school is pretty steep. There's only one way for Lorelai to get it, by swallowing her pride (along with her ever-present coffee, one of the show's tepid running jokes) and seeking help from her parents, Emily (Kelly Bishop) and Richard (Edward Herrmann). On one condition, says the imperious Emily: she demands that the grandparents spend more time with Rory so they can make sure she gets some of the opportunities that Lorelai never . . .</p>
        <p>Is there an echo in here?</p>
        <p>As a premise for a television series, this one isn't half bad. But the real test is the characters, and ''Gilmore Girls'' may make it on that score, too. Ms. Bledel, new to television, creates an appealing blend of precocious wisdom and teenage anxiety. Ms. Bishop makes for one tough bird, and although Mr. Herrmann isn't given much to do in tonight's episode, he aptly handles another installment, due for broadcast in two weeks, in which Richard and his granddaughter learn to reach out to each other.</p>
        <p>Among the supporting players who just may grow on you if given the chance are Melissa McCarthy as the inn's ditsy chef, Yanic Truesdale as its fussy concierge and Scott Patterson as the proprietor of the Gilmore Girls' favorite diner, who dispenses advice with the grub. Slinging a cheeseburger on the table, he barks, ''Red meat can kill you.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Graham, however, doesn't seem to have a firm grasp on Lorelai's precarious position, stuck between unresolved adolescence (wide grin) and adult responsibility (serious grimace). Just a few months ago she wore that same pained expression as a single aunt sharing life with a too-smart teenage niece in NBC's ''M.Y.O.B.'' (R.I.P.) Someone should tell her she's in a different show now. (O.K., maybe not all that different.) If viewers come to care about Lorelai as much as they're bound to love Rory, this show may stay afloat.</p>
        <p>''Gilmore Girls'' contains a few vulgar asides that cannot be repeated here. That's not noteworthy in today's television climate. But the network proudly (and a bit piously) proclaims that this show, created by Amy Sherman-Palladino, a writer and producer for ''Roseanne,'' is the first series to get off the drawing board with the help of the Script Development Fund of the advertiser-supported Family Friendly Forum. What does that mean? You judge. When Rory learns that she has been admitted to the prep school, she says to Lorelai, ''You didn't with the principal, did you?'' Mom replies, ''No, honey, that was a joke.''</p>
        <p>Rest assured, parents. This isn't one of those family-unfriendly shows that take sex seriously.</p>
        <p>GILMORE GIRLS  WB, tonight at 8  (Channel 11 in New York)</p>
        <p>Created by Amy Sherman-Palladino. Jenji Kohan and Mel Efros, producers; Joanne Waters, consulting producer; Jed Seidel, supervising producer; Daniel Palladino, creative consultant. Produced by Dorothy Parker Drank Here Productions and Hofflund/Polone in association with Warner Brothers Television. Amy Sherman-Palladino and Gavin Polone, executive producers.</p>
        <p>WITH: Lauren Graham (Lorelai Gilmore), Alexis Bledel (Rory Gilmore), Melissa McCarthy (Sookie St. James), Keiko Agena (Lane Kim), Yanic Truesdale (Michel Gerard), Kelly Bishop (Emily Gilmore), Edward Herrmann (Richard Gilmore), Scott Patterson (Luke Danes) and Liz Torres (Miss Patty).</p>
