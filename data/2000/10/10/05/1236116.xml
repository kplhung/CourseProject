        <p>GOOD-LOOKING and multitalented. Sleek, with a sense of humor.'' If a stool, table or chair could write a personal ad, that's what these pieces would say. They are space-savers that can do double duty, making a small place more comfortable and fun. But generally speaking, this will not be a cheap date.</p>
        <p>1. Stackable stools of maple plywood by Pablo Pardo have removable rubber tops so the cylinders can be used for storage. They come in two heights: 16 inches ($120) or 21 inches ($150). A 48-inch-long laminate top ($90) turns two stools into a coffee table; a 24-inch round top ($70, not shown) makes one stool into a table ($70). The stainless steel serving bowl ($35) is handy for chips or fruit. Twelve-inch-high stools (not shown) for children will be available in December in four colors: aqua, yellow, red or orange. All are available from Pablo, www.pablodesigns.com or (415) 822-2712.</p>
