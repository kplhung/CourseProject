        <p>VIDEO GAMES: BEHIND THE FUN  (Produced by Tera Media; Monday night at 10 Eastern and Pacific time on the History Channel.)</p>
        <p>ONE of the great things about Pong, says Keith Feinstein, a video game historian who appears in ''Video Games: Behind the Fun,'' a History Channel documentary, is that you could play it with a beer in one hand. It's a good line. Unfortunately it is also one of the more insightful things anyone in this documentary about video games has to say about the subject.</p>
        <p>The story of how a multibillion-dollar industry grew out of a few arcade games should be an interesting one. So should the story of how a modern high-tech game is created or how plot and character have become an integral part of games.</p>
        <p>''Behind the Fun'' thinks so, too, and tries to cover all these topics, flitting from one to the other without illuminating any of them. At one hour, the program is too short to  explore its subject properly, but it  wears out its welcome almost immediately with a dry Cliff Notes approach.</p>
        <p>To compensate, ''Behind the Fun'' shows dozens of video sequences from games, almost all of them released in the last couple of years: Space Channel 5, Kiss Psycho Circus, Grim Fandango, Nocturne.</p>
        <p>Even when discussing older games, the program can rarely pull itself away from the cinematics of the current crop. That is understandable because games look better than they ever have before. But rather than showing this, ''Behind the Fun'' makes it seem as though games moved from simple blocky visuals to realistic animations in one huge leap. By virtually ignoring the important steps in between, we are given little sense of how games have progressed visually and stylistically. It's as if a documentary on the history of film was made up primarily of clips from ''Terminator 2'' and ''The Cell.''</p>
        <p>The clips seem to have been chosen for their entertainment value instead of their ability to illustrate a point. For example, as we are being told that computers are becoming a more popular platform for video games than consoles, we are shown the opening sequence of Resident Evil: Code Veronica, a console game that hasn't been released for the PC.</p>
        <p>''Behind the Fun'' does make some interesting points. Space Invaders is convincingly posited as the beginning of story and character in video games. In Space Invaders, odd-looking monsters slowly moved toward the bottom of the screen while you shot at them. That's all there was to it, but there was an implied invasion, an implied resistance and a cast of aliens, even if you have never thought of Space Invaders in terms of narrative structure.</p>
        <p>There is also a smattering of interesting trivia: Space Invaders was so popular in Japan that it caused a coin shortage; the first PC from I.B.M. came with a joystick; video games were banned in the Philippines.</p>
        <p>''Behind the Fun'' picks up in its second half, as though the documentary makers are less bored by the age of the modern game. Even then, some ideas are never fully examined. Although the video game is put forth as a medium that can rival traditional art and literature, we are shown only slight instances of this.</p>
        <p>Shenmue, which has not been released in the United States, is offered as an example of how a game rethinks interactions by having characters remember what the player has told them. Ultima is said to hold its players morally accountable, penalizing them for killing and theft.</p>
        <p>These are interesting ideas, but not ideas pulled out of thin air. There is no discussion of earlier influential games, like System Shock or Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers, that pushed the medium forward as interactive art.</p>
        <p>The history of video games is primarily a history of ideas, but this documentary can't seem to appreciate an idea in any game that is not visually appealing.</p>
        <p>''Behind the Fun'' is not going to hold the interest of people who don't like video games (my wife walked out at the first mention of texture mapping). And for anyone familiar with these games, the program will shed little new light on the subject. Despite clips of shootings and explosions, this is a documentary that never catches fire. Perhaps ''Video Games: Without the Fun'' would have been a better title.</p>
