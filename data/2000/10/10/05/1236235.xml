        <p>THE DEMOCRATS</p>
        <p>CLINTON TOURS FOR GORE -- President Clinton's travel schedule at the tail end of his second term has begun, not surprisingly, to overlap a lot with the states Vice President Al Gore needs to win. Yesterday found him in Florida, where, also not surprisingly, he was high in praise of Mr. Gore's performance in Tuesday's debate.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton told an enthusiastic crowd in Jacksonville that Mr. Gore had done ''a great job'' of laying out his differences with Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.</p>
        <p>The president also put in a good word for Representative Corrine Brown of Jacksonville, a Democrat in a tough fight for re-election.</p>

        <p>THE DEMOCRATS</p>
        <p>CLINTON TOURS FOR GORE -- President Clinton's travel schedule at the tail end of his second term has begun, not surprisingly, to overlap a lot with the states Vice President Al Gore needs to win. Yesterday found him in Florida, where, also not surprisingly, he was high in praise of Mr. Gore's performance in Tuesday's debate.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton told an enthusiastic crowd in Jacksonville that Mr. Gore had done ''a great job'' of laying out his differences with Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.</p>
        <p>The president also put in a good word for Representative Corrine Brown of Jacksonville, a Democrat in a tough fight for re-election.</p>
        <p>Today, Mr. Clinton is off to New Jersey and New York; he will be in Ohio and Indiana on Saturday. White House aides say that he has more requests for visits than he can answer and that they are sifting through them with an eye on both the calendar and the electoral map. The only state he has not visited is heavily Republican Nebraska, but his schedulers say he will go there before Election Day.</p>

        <p>THE REPUBLICANS</p>
        <p>THE CHENEY MUTINY -- The secret of the suddenly swankier hotels on the Cheney campaign trail can now be told.</p>
        <p>After putting up with quite a few, well, less than five-star establishments, the Republican vice-presidential candidate Dick Cheney beamed a videotaped message to the Bush campaign headquarters in Austin, Tex., about 10 days ago, threatening in his deadest dead pan to send the Bush campaign manager, Joe Allbaugh, ''on an all-expense paid trip to every lousy hotel we stayed in during the course of the campaign.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney recalled hotels with ''green used hospital sheets and nonworking shower heads,'' one that ''offered exposed wiring and bed bugs,'' another so dire that ''the advance staff asked to be transferred to the local KOA campground.'' He told of how one hotel lost all power, ''probably because of Al Gore's energy policies,'' and how he and and his wife, Lynne, transferred to another where ''the snoring that woke Lynne up wasn't coming from me, but from the guy in the next room.''</p>
        <p>So?</p>
        <p>At the next stop, Mr. Cheney and his crew found themselves in a Ritz-Carlton.</p>

        <p>THE HOUSE</p>
        <p>FLORIDA CONGRESSIONAL RUNOFF -- The stage has been set for a Florida contest that could give Democrats a new seat in their battle to regain control of the House.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, in a Republican primary runoff in the Eighth Congressional District, Ric Keller, a prominent Orlando lawyer, defeated State Representative Bill Sublette to win the right to take on Linda Chapin, the Democratic nominee, in November. Mr. Keller won by five percentage points.</p>
        <p>Ms. Chapin, a popular former chairwoman of the Orange County Commission, hopes to benefit from the contentious runoff, calculating that it left Republicans divided with little time to pull themselves together before the general election. The district's current congressman, Representative Bill McCollum, a Republican who gained national attention as a House manager of President Clinton's impeachment case, is running for the United States Senate.</p>

        <p>THE SENATE</p>
        <p>AN ENCORE IN GEORGIA -- In 1992, Mabel Lopp, a home health care worker from South Georgia, sang a plainspun but memorable jingle in a campaign advertisement for Paul Coverdell that helped send him to the United States Senate. Mr. Coverdell died in July, but now his old campaign committee is using leftover money to pay for a similar advertisement for Mack Mattingly, a Republican former senator who is competing for Mr. Coverdell's seat against former Gov. Zell Miller, whom the governor appointed to fill the Coverdell seat. In the radio commercials, Ms. Lopp, 81, criticizes Mr. Miller while singing unaccompanied to a tune she wrote that sounds vaguely like ''Dixie.'' The words include:</p>
        <p>We hear Zell claim he's like Coverdell,</p>
        <p>But that's not his desire.</p>
        <p>He's Clinton's friend he can't deny.</p>
        <p>He's changed his tune, and we know why.</p>
        <p>So vote Mack Mattingly in the Senate</p>
        <p>And let Zell re-retire.</p>
        <p>Ms. Lopp also appeared in commercials for Republicans in 1994 and 1996. Both candidates lost.</p>

        <p>DEBATE LOG</p>
        <p>BY THE NUMBERS -- During Tuesday's presidential debate in Boston, Vice President Al Gore interrupted, went over his time limits, asked for more time, even petitioned Jim Lehrer, the moderator, for more chances to respond. He was, in short, the over-eager beaver, trying to monopolize the evening, doing most of the talking.</p>
        <p>Right?</p>
        <p>Not quite.</p>
        <p>It just seemed that way at times because of his relentless recitation of facts and figures. In fact, however, a look at the debate transcript shows that Gov. George W. Bush talked more. He managed to get out 7,900 words in the 90 minutes, give or take a mouthful. Mr. Gore got out 7,400.</p>
        <p>A footnote: The ABC News political unit put a stopwatch on the debaters: Mr. Gore talked for 43 minutes and 15 seconds; Mr. Bush talked for 42 minutes and 30 seconds.</p>
        <p>Go figure.</p>
        <p>Another footnote: The Hotline political tip sheet kept a scorecard:</p>
        <p>Number of times 'Lieberman' was uttered: 1  Number of times 'Cheney' was uttered: 0  Number of times 'McCain' was uttered: 6</p>
