        <p>Buoyed by Oracle's reaffirmation of strong prospects, the Nasdaq composite index climbed nearly 2 percent yesterday after losses in eight of the nine previous sessions, a downturn that had dropped the technology-heavy gauge back to the levels of late May.</p>
        <p>While cautioning that one day's gains proved little, strategists and portfolio managers said they were encouraged by what appeared to be a fresh appetite for beaten-up technology stocks with the waning of the season in which companies have been warning of shortfalls in sales or profits or both.</p>
        <p>The market also seemed to have overcome fears of big increases in oil prices and disappointment in some quarters that the Federal Reserve did not suggest after its meeting on Tuesday that it could afford to be less vigilant against inflation.</p>
        <p>''Tech really rebounded here,'' said Timothy M. Stevenson, senior portfolio manager at the First Capital Group. ''Most of the negative preannouncements are probably behind us, and you're starting to see a more constructive environment for investors to take on more risk.''</p>
        <p>One piece of evidence was a skid in utility stocks, a traditional haven for nervous investors. The Standard &amp; Poor's utility average fell 2.9 percent yesterday, trimming its gain so far this year to a still-heady 43.3 percent.</p>
        <p>Another optimist was David Alger, president of Fred Alger Management, who said in a panel discussion sponsored by SunAmerica that he expected technology companies to soon begin reporting strong summertime profits and that their stocks would ''turn around and run in the fourth quarter.''</p>
        <p>After an early 73-point swoon, during which Oracle traded as low as $60.50, the Nasdaq gained 67.27 points, or 2 percent, to 3,523.10. Oracle finished at $68.13, down $1.38, after declaring that this would be a ''terrific year'' and that remarks by its chief financial officer on Tuesday were not intended as a warning of shortfalls.</p>
        <p>Oracle shares, downgraded by at least one analyst, were by far the day's most active, with 102.35 million  changing hands, the second-most-active session ever for Oracle and the 19th most active for any stock.</p>
        <p>The second-heaviest-traded issue was Microsoft, which lost $1.13, to $55.44, another 52-week low. The stock was at $119.94 in December.</p>
        <p>The Dow Jones industrial average advanced 64.74 points, or 0.6 percent, to 10,784.48. It was the biggest of three consecutive gains for the blue-chip barometer, with the technology components I.B.M., Hewlett-Packard and SBC Communications making the biggest positive contributions and J. P. Morgan and Citigroup among the biggest drags.</p>
        <p>The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index also managed a gain despite the fact that declining issues outnumbered advancing ones 255 to 227. Its rise was 7.86 points, or 0.6 percent, to 1,434.32.</p>
        <p>Knight Trading, which announced an unexpected profit decline, slumped $3.69, to $28.50, and seemed to cast a pall over the brokerage sector as a whole. Lehman Brothers and Goldman Sachs fell by more than four points each.</p>
        <p>Amazon.com gained 94 cents, to $36, despite a downgrade by a Robertson Stephens analyst who said the company might not be able to make money with its current business plan, which goes far beyond books to a myriad of products.</p>
        <p>PepsiCo, which announced a 16 percent profit gain and the retirement at the end of 2001 of its chief executive, eased 88 cents, to $45.13.</p>
