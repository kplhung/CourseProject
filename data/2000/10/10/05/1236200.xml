        <p>When Columbia University approved new procedures for handling sexual misconduct complaints against students earlier this year, the changes were widely praised on campus despite some concerns that accused students could no longer confront their accusers or have lawyers represent them at hearings.</p>
        <p>Now a new group that says it wants to protect free speech and academic freedom on college campuses is taking aim at the new policies, saying they violate due process and basic fairness, a position that is winning some support from civil liberties lawyers and others.</p>
        <p>Under the new procedures, students who believe they have been sexually assaulted can file a complaint with a newly created sexual misconduct office, which will assemble a panel of two deans and a student trained in sexual misconduct issues. The panel will hold hearings in which the members interview the accuser, the accused and other witnesses separately, then recommend to the dean of the college within Columbia that the accused student attends whether to discipline the student.</p>
        <p>Thor L. Halvorssen, executive director of the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, the year-old group critical of the new procedures, said university officials ''have a moral obligation to protect the rights of the accused.''</p>
        <p>An editorial in The Wall Street Journal yesterday seconded the concerns of the group. And Norman Siegel, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, said in an interview that he would strongly urge Columbia to reconsider its policies and procedures.</p>
        <p>''It's a no-brainer,'' he said. ''Sexual misconduct is a serious and substantial problem, and Columbia needs to take it seriously. But due process is equally important.''</p>
        <p>Columbia, in a statement yesterday, said that courts have ruled that due process procedures guaranteed in American courts are ''not necessary to ensure a fair and effective process for handling the violations of university policies.''</p>
        <p>It added that its new procedures were intended to provide ''a nonadversarial hearing process'' by panels of specially trained deans and students where students are allowed to bring a ''silent supporter'' with them. It said that a new oversight committee would monitor the new sexual misconduct policy to ensure its fairness and consistency.</p>
        <p>Students can also bypass the new procedure and file a criminal complaint or invoke Columbia's regular disciplinary process.</p>
        <p>Columbia began to review its sexual misconduct procedures two years ago because they were meant to be temporary and had been used only twice in five years.</p>
        <p>Students charged that the low use did not reflect the prevalence of date rape on campus, since local hospitals received several complaints of sexual assault a month from Columbia students.</p>
        <p>After lengthy discussion by a task force and the Columbia Senate -- both comprising students, faculty and staff members -- the Senate approved the new policies, which included a new full-time coordinator charged with educating students about sexual misconduct and the optional streamlined complaint process. ''We were trying to make the most effective way possible to investigate each case, where witnesses would not be intimidated, confidentiality would be maintained and people won't be hurt,'' said Sofia Berger, a junior majoring in civil engineering who was a member of the task force.</p>
        <p>The Senate approved most of the policies unanimously in February, but the hearing procedures faced opposition from those who wanted to strengthen the due process rights of the accused. Ultimately, however, the procedure was approved nearly unanimously</p>
        <p>''There was really overwhelming student and faculty support, from both men and women,'' Ariel Neuman, president of the undergraduate student government, said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Neuman, a senior from Arizona majoring in political science, said that if he faced sexual misconduct charges, he would not be concerned by the new procedure, because it provided adequate review and an appeal process.</p>
        <p>But when Harvey A. Silverglate, a Boston lawyer whose daughter is a senior at Columbia, heard about the new policy last year, he was alarmed. Mr. Silverglate is a board member of the American Civil Liberties Union and a co-founder of the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education.</p>
        <p>Correction:  October 11, 2000, Wednesday  Because of an editing error, an article on Thursday about a new sexual misconduct policy at Columbia University referred incorrectly to a senior there whose father is Harvey A. Silverglate, a co-founder of a group critical of the policy. The student is his son, not his daughter. Because of an editing error, the article also misstated Mr. Silverglate's title and affiliation. He is a board member and a former president of the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts, not a past board member of the national A.C.L.U.</p>
