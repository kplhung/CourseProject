        <p>Their New York experiences have been eerily similar. Both came to the Giants with reputations as passing gurus only to deal with quarterback controversies. Both earned coach-of-the-year honors in their first season with the Giants. And after two mediocre seasons, each entered his fourth year with his job security in doubt.</p>
        <p>The Giants and Jim Fassel play the Falcons and Dan Reeves, the former Broncos and Giants coach, on Sunday in a game featuring two teams that are slumping. Each has lost two consecutive games.</p>
        <p>Although Reeves's team apparently has even more questions than the Giants, he is not ready to talk about retirement. Reeves, who was fired by the Giants after the 1996 season, said today that he felt great physically. He has relaxed a bit after having quadruple heart bypass surgery in the middle of the 1998 season, but this season has tested his tolerance.</p>
        <p>Atlanta is 2-3, and its three losses have been blowouts, with the opposition scoring at least 38 points in each game. Jamal Anderson, the Atlanta running back, has clearly been slowed by major surgery on his knee last October. He has gained only 300 yards in five games, but will now face a Giant defense that yielded 125 rushing yards to Tennessee's Eddie George last Sunday.</p>
        <p>The Falcons are playing so poorly that if the Giants were 4-1 instead of 3-2 they might view this as the dreaded trap game, the prototypical letdown in their schedule. Instead, the Giants must capitalize on Atlanta's misfortunes, which are extensive.</p>
        <p>Two years removed from the Super Bowl, there is so little interest in the Falcons in Atlanta that 23,000 tickets remain available for Sunday's game. Things have been so bad that people interpreted Reeves's self-indictment and glum expression following last Sunday's 38-10 loss to Philadelphia as a sign of impending retirement.</p>
        <p>''People say maybe coach will retire,'' Anderson said. ''What else would he do?''</p>
        <p>Told of Anderson's remark, Reeves said: ''I think Jamal makes a lot of sense, doesn't he? I don't know how long I'm going to do it. As long as it's fun.''</p>
        <p>Reeves knows something about the pressure on Fassel. Reeves coached the last Giants team to start the season 3-0 in 1994 only to lose its next seven games.</p>
        <p>''That is tough on everybody and that has nothing to do with any kind of ultimatum, because any year you go out there you could be fired,'' Reeves said. ''You're kind of working against public opinion and so forth. It's just a tough business.''</p>
        <p>Lack of Respect</p>
        <p>Denny Marcin, the Giants' defensive line coach, said the team's once-feared four-man unit does not intimidate opponents the way it used to and has lost the respect of other teams.</p>
        <p>''No question, and we have to get it back," said Marcin, who added that the beleaguered group is not giving a good second effort on pressuring quarterbacks.</p>
        <p>Defensive end Michael Strahan and tackle Keith Hamilton each have two and one-half sacks, the only sacks recorded by the unit this season. Strahan, Hamilton and fellow starters Cedric Jones and Christian Peter continued to practice with the first-team defense today. Jones is playing with a cast on his hand for a bruised thumb. Marcin said the Giants are simply not beating one-on-one blocks, allowing other teams to abandon double-teaming them.</p>
        <p>Strahan, whose sacks dropped from 15 in 1998 to 5 1/2 last season, should have ample opportunity Sunday. Atlanta starts two rookies on Strahan's side of the line.</p>
        <p>''I think he's definitely disappointed with what he's doing,'' Marcin said. ''I think he'd tell you that.''</p>
        <p>Barrow Is Questionable</p>
        <p>Linebacker Michael Barrow was limited in practice today because of a pinched nerve in his neck that caused him to miss half of Sunday's game at Tennessee. Coach Jim Fassel is concerned because Barrow, the Giants' biggest off-season acquisition, has had several similar injuries since training camp. He is listed as questionable, as is kicker Brad Daluiso.</p>
        <p>After missing Sunday's game with a sore neck, Daluiso did not kick today as planned and expects to be inactive again Sunday. He said his back had improved but the team wanted him to return to full strength so he wouldn't suffer a setback.</p>
        <p>Jaret Holmes, signed Saturday to replace Daluiso, had a dubious first full practice with the Giants, missing four of six field-goal attempts on a windy day and prompting an early pep talk from Coach Jim Fassel.</p>
        <p>''He said, 'Don't worry,' but I'm sure that's what he was thinking,'' Holmes said.</p>
        <p>Wide receiver Amani Toomer cut his practice short because of a sore toe, but Fassel said he should be fine.</p>
