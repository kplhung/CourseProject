      <abstract>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>While trying to sum up my reactions to Tuesday's debate, I couldn't help but come away with a feeling of deja vu (front page, Oct. 4). Just as in 1960, a sitting vice president spouted facts and figures while looking ill at ease. Mr. Bush, on the other hand,  was as pleasing to listen to as to watch, much as it was with John F. Kennedy.</p>

        <p>While trying to sum up my reactions to Tuesday's debate, I couldn't help but come away with a feeling of deja vu (front page, Oct. 4). Just as in 1960, a sitting vice president spouted facts and figures while looking ill at ease. Mr. Bush, on the other hand,  was as pleasing to listen to as to watch, much as it was with John F. Kennedy.</p>
        <p>The issues discussed were covered adequately by both. Obviously, Mr. Gore thinks Washington knows best when it comes to what to do with our money, and Mr. Bush feels the people do. Mr. Gore likes to take credit for our prosperity, yet he rails against the companies and entrepreneurs that brought us to where we are today.</p>
