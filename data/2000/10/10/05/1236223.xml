        <p>The stock prices of networking equipment companies like Cisco Systems and Nortel Networks sometimes seem as if they are priced for perpetual success. But shares of the phone companies that buy that equipment have spelled failure so far this year. Now, one analyst is warning investors in the equipment makers that this difference may not last much longer.</p>
        <p>Giant telecommunications companies like AT&amp;T, WorldCom and Deutsche Telekom have fallen sharply in the last year, as investors worry that the carriers are spending too much money on new telecommunications and Internet equipment. Shares in smaller companies have fallen more steeply, and some of the upstarts are teetering on the edge of bankruptcy.</p>
        <p>Over all, capital spending by telecommunications companies in the United States will exceed $100 billion this year, almost three times the 1995 level. At the same time, revenue, which is forecast just over $300 billion this year, is growing much more slowly.</p>
        <p>Yet investors still love Cisco, Nortel, Juniper Networks and the other beneficiaries of that runaway spending. Though Cisco and other makers of networking and communications equipment have fallen since the summer, they are still among the most highly valued stocks around.</p>
        <p>For example, Nortel has risen ninefold over the last two years, sports a market valuation of nearly $200 billion and trades at almost 90 times its projected profit for this year. Cisco trades at nearly 80 times its projected earnings for the July 2001 fiscal year, and the company's valuation exceeds $400 billion, trailing only General Electric.</p>
        <p>Such valuations and price-to-earnings ratios imply that investors are expecting profits at equipment makers to continue to increase at high rates for several more years.</p>
        <p>Now, Paul Sagawa, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company, is sounding an alarm about the widening gap between the fortunes of the equipment makers and the companies they serve. In a research report last week, Mr. Sagawa warned that capital spending by telecommunications companies is likely to grow much more slowly in 2001 than it has the last two years. But investors in equipment makers have not faced that reality, Mr. Sagawa said.</p>
        <p>He lowered his ratings on Cisco and Nortel and warned that many smaller companies could fail to meet earnings expectations.</p>
        <p>''In particular, we are concerned that companies trading at prices more than 50 times forward earnings will face considerable pressure in an environment of decelerating sales,'' Mr. Sagawa wrote.</p>
        <p>Many other analysts who follow these industries disagree with Mr. Sagawa, calling his conclusions alarmist and simplistic. But if he is right, some companies in the sector could have a long way to fall, because stocks are extremely expensive compared with much else in the market. The top 15 networking equipment companies have a market valuation of more than $1.1 trillion, about 7 percent of the value of all American equities listed, though their sales this year will be $100 billion and their profits less than $15 billion.</p>
        <p>Factor out Cisco, Nortel and Lucent Technologies -- the three largest and most-established equipment makers -- and the valuations appear even more extreme. The next dozen communications suppliers, including Juniper, JDS Uniphase and Corning, have a total market valuation of $400 billion on projected 2000 sales of less than $14 billion and profits of less than $3 billion. With such high price-to-earnings and price-to-sales ratios, some second-tier companies may need years of extraordinary growth to justify their current valuations.</p>
        <p>But ''the revenue pool that's supposed to pay for that growth is decelerating,'' Mr. Sagawa said. ''If the customer is sick and not making money for the services, they are not going to be able to pay for all this equipment.''</p>
        <p>Both established telecommunications service providers like AT&amp;T and upstart competitors like Level 3 Communications and Teligent are spending far more on equipment this year than they will make in profit, Mr. Sagawa said.</p>
        <p>Over all, the American telecommunications industry had negative cash flow of $20 billion in the first half of 2000, on top of negative cash flow of $11 billion in 1999. To make up the difference, the industry has turned to the capital markets, issuing tens of billions of dollars in stock and debt. AT&amp;T alone raised more than $10 billion from investors by selling a piece of its wireless division in April.</p>
        <p>But with carriers' profits weak and competition relentless, investors are becoming reluctant to finance more spending, Mr. Sagawa said. Established carriers have had to offer higher interest rates to sell their bonds, and the stock prices of some money-losing upstarts like Teligent have fallen 80 percent or more this year, effectively erasing the chance they can issue new shares. ''Access to capital is a problem,'' Mr. Sagawa said.</p>
        <p>So the carriers will soon be forced to cut back on new capital spending, he declared, or at least slow their growth. And with Cisco and its kin so expensive, Mr. Sagawa predicted, investors would react badly to a slowdown.</p>
        <p>To be sure, this analyst's views are hardly universal. Many other analysts and technology mutual fund managers say his conclusions are mistaken. While carriers are unlikely to increase spending on networking equipment by 30 percent next year, as they are doing in 2000, demand for new communications equipment is likely to rise in absolute terms next year and for years to come, they say.</p>
        <p>Demand for bandwidth remains very strong from both consumers, who want faster Internet access, and businesses, which are sending huge amounts of data across networks, said Max Schuetz, an analyst with Thomas Weisel Partners.</p>
        <p>''You go out to all these carriers that are supposedly going to cut off spending,'' Mr. Schuetz said, ''and then you ask them whether they have excess capacity on their networks. And the answer is uniformly no.''</p>
        <p>David Santos, co-manager of the $7 billion Putnam Growth Opportunities fund, said that telecommunications companies had no choice but to continue buying new equipment. For companies like AT&amp;T, he said, ''the competitive environment will not become any easier -- it will become more intense, and in that environment, service providers are compelled to spend in order to compete.''</p>
        <p>In addition, carriers are redirecting their capital spending away from ''poles and holes,'' or physical construction like laying fiber optic cables, and toward equipment, said Michael Ching, a Merrill Lynch analyst.  In a Sept. 18 report headlined ''Please, Smack Chicken Little,'' Mr. Ching argued that spending both in the United States and abroad would remain strong through 2001.</p>
        <p>Lucent's continuing problems provide a hidden boost for Cisco and the other companies in the sector, Mr. Santos said. Lucent is the largest of all the equipment makers, but it is weak and badly positioned to capitalize on soaring demand for optical and packet-switching gear, he said. That will enable Cisco, Nortel and JDS Uniphase to take sales from Lucent even if overall demand is weaker than expected.</p>
        <p>''You can clearly see who's winning the battle at this point in time over the technology front,'' he said, ''and how that's reflected in sales.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sagawa does not disagree that in the short run, demand for telecommunications services remains very high. In fact, the equipment makers are likely to report excellent earnings for the rest of 2000, he said. But in the long run, investors in the equipment makers need to recognize that the carriers will not keep increasing their capital spending if the returns on that spending continue to decline, he said.</p>
        <p>''We're going to have to have a year where total spending goes down,'' Mr. Sagawa said. ''What we have is a cyclical business that's being treated as a perpetual business.''</p>
