        <p>Spain's telephone company, Telefonica S.A., is in talks to purchase Motorola's stake in several Mexican mobile phone companies. It would be Telefonica's first move into Mexico. Telefonica said a subsidiary, Telefonica Moviles, would acquire the Motorola shares and that a final agreement was expected within the next two weeks. No price for the shares was disclosed by Telefonica, but Spanish media reports said that the purchase would be worth about $2.6 billion and the companies involved were Movitel, Portatel, Cedetel, Baja Celular and Norcel. The transaction would be the first since Cesar Alierta, above, took over as chairman and Fernando Abril-Martorell as chief executive after Juan Villalonga resigned in July. The deal would give Telefonica Moviles about 1.3 million new cell phone customers.</p>
