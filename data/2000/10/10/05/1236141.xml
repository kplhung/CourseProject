        <p>DESIGN being used as a marketing tool? Hardly shocking. In the 1980's, Chrysler, now DaimlerChrysler, got a leg up on the competition by making design history with its minivan; this year it was the company's bulbous retro PT Cruiser with the getaway-car fenders. Chrysler also came up with the Chrysler Design Awards in 1993, dedicated to sussing out innovators in the fields of architecture, environmental design, electronic media and graphic and industrial design. The winners, announced this week, each receive a trophy and $10,000.</p>
        <p>The accumulated roster of winners reads partly as a roundup of the usual suspects (Frank Gehry, Karim Rashid, Apple), partly as a finger-in-the-wind forecast (Chuck Hoberman, John Maeda of the M.I.T. Media Lab, Edward Fella). But by now the Chrysler Design Award, as it moves from celebrating heroics to heralding the developers of new design technologies, has gathered enough critical mass to define a generation, albeit one in transition.</p>

        <p>DESIGN being used as a marketing tool? Hardly shocking. In the 1980's, Chrysler, now DaimlerChrysler, got a leg up on the competition by making design history with its minivan; this year it was the company's bulbous retro PT Cruiser with the getaway-car fenders. Chrysler also came up with the Chrysler Design Awards in 1993, dedicated to sussing out innovators in the fields of architecture, environmental design, electronic media and graphic and industrial design. The winners, announced this week, each receive a trophy and $10,000.</p>
        <p>The accumulated roster of winners reads partly as a roundup of the usual suspects (Frank Gehry, Karim Rashid, Apple), partly as a finger-in-the-wind forecast (Chuck Hoberman, John Maeda of the M.I.T. Media Lab, Edward Fella). But by now the Chrysler Design Award, as it moves from celebrating heroics to heralding the developers of new design technologies, has gathered enough critical mass to define a generation, albeit one in transition.</p>
        <p>The range of this year's six winners is as free-form as ever. Will Bruder of Phoenix, Ariz., has built a reputation for elegant modern architecture that is environmentally sensitive without being punishingly earnest. Ted Muehling is a jewelry designer who has created new art forms to wear. (Both men are also finalists for the first round of the National Design Awards, administered by the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum. Those winners will  be announced next month.)</p>
        <p>There's an award for Gary Panter, a graphic designer and artist, who moved from building Pee-wee Herman's playhouse to creating the post-apocalyptic underground comic ''Jimbo.'' One went to David M. Kelley, the founder of Ideo, who knows what the future will look like because his team is engineering the design of many of its high-tech products.</p>
        <p>Rounding out the list: James Corner, a professor of landscape design at the University of Pennsylvania, and Paula Scher, a designer and partner at Pentagram who reimagined the graphic image for the Joseph Papp Public Theater.</p>
        <p>The trophies, kinetic sculptures made out of childproof acrylic and steel, will be presented at a private party in New York on Oct. 25.</p>
