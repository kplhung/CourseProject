        <p>A loophole in American tax law that allows insurance companies to stop paying income taxes simply by opening a small office in Bermuda is causing deep concern on Capitol Hill amid signs that a number of companies are preparing to exploit it.</p>
        <p>The loophole, disclosed in March by The New York Times, could cost the Treasury as much as $4 billion a year, equal to about 2 percent of all corporate tax payments, if every American property and casualty insurer exploited it, according to the latest estimates circulating on Capitol Hill. If individual taxpayers have to make up that loss it would cost them each about $32 annually. State governments would also lose money.</p>
        <p>By March, six companies had positioned themselves to move their official headquarters to Bermuda and operate free of federal and state income taxes. Three more deals have been announced and stock market analysts are praising the Bermuda strategy as a boon to shareholders.</p>
        <p>A bipartisan bill to close the loophole was introduced in Congress in April, but languished until last week, when one of the six companies that moved to Bermuda announced it was acquiring a larger insurer. The company, White Mountains Insurance Group, formerly known as Firemen's Fund, is buying the property and casualty insurer CGU, a unit of the CGNU Group of London. White Mountains operates out of offices in Hanover, N.H., but 11 months ago reorganized itself as a Bermuda company.</p>
        <p>Later last week, the chairman of White Mountains, John J. Byrne, discussed the possibility of acquiring Safeco, a large insurer in Seattle. Mr. Byrne later said he had no plans to seek ownership of Safeco.</p>
        <p>After hearing that large companies like Safeco might suddenly try to operate untaxed, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Bill Archer, Republican of Texas, told his staff to find a way to close the loophole quickly, according to Representative Nancy Johnson, a Connecticut Republican on the committee.</p>
        <p>Mr. Archer could not be reached last night but aides said the meeting did take place and that Mr. Archer was deeply concerned. The chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, William V. Roth Jr., Republican of Delaware, also has told his staff to find a way to close the loophole, his spokeswoman, Ginny Flynn, said.</p>
        <p>Representative Johnson said Mr. Archer ''understood the urgency of this matter and is really concerned about stopping the flow of jobs and capital out of the country.''</p>
        <p>Her district includes the headquarters of several insurance companies, among them the Hartford, which wants the Bermuda loophole closed.</p>
        <p>The Hartford, Chubb, Kemper and Liberty Mutual say long-established companies with deep reserves cannot take advantage of the loophole because of other tax rules. They warn that if the loophole is not closed  they will be hurt because, as companies that continue to pay income taxes, they will be at a competitive disadvantage to those that operate untaxed.</p>
        <p>The loophole works this way: Companies that insure against fire, injuries on the job and other property and casualty losses send premiums collected from customers to a corporate parent in Bermuda and treat the transfer as a business expense, even though money is simply being shifted from one part of the company to another. The business expense gives the American subsidiary a deduction that wipes out taxable profits. And the Bermuda parent can invest the premiums and not have to pay taxes on the investment profits because Bermuda has no income tax.</p>
        <p>Congress does impose an excise tax when premium money is transferred to Bermuda, but the tax rate is only 1 percent. The federal corporate income tax rate is 35 percent.</p>
        <p>Two of the largest companies that organized in Bermuda, the ACE Group of Companies and X.L. Capital Ltd., have denounced the bipartisan legislation as protectionist and say that the tax benefits of the Bermuda move are exaggerated.</p>
        <p>A Democratic co-sponsor of the bill to close the loophole, Representative Richard E. Neal of Massachusetts, expressed doubt that action would be taken this year because Congress needed guidance from the Treasury on how to close the loophole in a way acceptable to the White House. ''I believe there is a wide consensus in the Congress that the Bermuda loophole is a major problem,'' Mr. Neal said, ''but frankly nothing is going to happen until Treasury makes up its mind on a solution.''</p>
        <p>Like Senator Roth, Mr. Neal is worried that closing the loophole could lead to other problems with tax policy affecting global commerce.</p>
        <p>Mr. Archer argues that federal corporate tax law is driving investment and jobs out of the country and that the only solution is to replace the corporate income tax with an entirely new tax system.</p>
        <p>This stance has led him to oppose fixing a variety of specific problems with the tax laws. But in this case, Representative Johnson said, he is worried that a stampede to Bermuda is under way and action must be taken quickly to stop it.</p>
        <p>White Mountains has not taken advantage of the loophole, its chief tax official, David Staples, said last night, even though it did reorganize late last year as a Bermuda company and is eligible to do so. ''We have formed an offshore reinsurer,'' Mr. Staples confirmed, ''but we have no plans at this time'' to take advantage of the Bermuda tax break.</p>
