        <p>Editorial backs charge by Vice Pres Al Gore that Gov George W Bush's tax cut plan would award more money to wealthiest 1 percent of taxpayers than amounts Bush would set aside for major programs; opposes giving wealthiest, who pay 20.1 percent of taxes, 42.6 percent of tax break</p>

        <p>Of all the contentious issues in their debate Tuesday night, none underscored the differences between Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush more than taxes. Repeating himself relentlessly, Mr. Gore asserted that the Texas governor's proposed tax cuts would award more money to the wealthiest 1 percent of taxpayers than the amounts Mr. Bush would set aside for education, health and defense combined. Mr. Bush accused the vice president of using ''fuzzy numbers,'' but never refuted the basic charge. In fact, Mr. Gore's formula was on target, illustrating a stark choice between the two candidates' approaches on the tax issue.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush likes to defend his proposals as lowering tax rates for everyone, not just those who seize the narrowly crafted incentives offered by Mr. Gore. He has a point. In order to take advantage of the Gore tax cuts, taxpayers would have to tap into credits or deductions for child care, health insurance, college tuition, care of disabled relatives and other needs. A working-class family without these expenses might get little or no tax relief. It is legitimate to raise a question whether Mr. Gore's approach would further complicate an already complex tax code.</p>

        <p>Of all the contentious issues in their debate Tuesday night, none underscored the differences between Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush more than taxes. Repeating himself relentlessly, Mr. Gore asserted that the Texas governor's proposed tax cuts would award more money to the wealthiest 1 percent of taxpayers than the amounts Mr. Bush would set aside for education, health and defense combined. Mr. Bush accused the vice president of using ''fuzzy numbers,'' but never refuted the basic charge. In fact, Mr. Gore's formula was on target, illustrating a stark choice between the two candidates' approaches on the tax issue.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush likes to defend his proposals as lowering tax rates for everyone, not just those who seize the narrowly crafted incentives offered by Mr. Gore. He has a point. In order to take advantage of the Gore tax cuts, taxpayers would have to tap into credits or deductions for child care, health insurance, college tuition, care of disabled relatives and other needs. A working-class family without these expenses might get little or no tax relief. It is legitimate to raise a question whether Mr. Gore's approach would further complicate an already complex tax code.</p>
        <p>But there are issues beyond simplicity. Among other steps, the Bush tax proposals would lower the marginal tax rates in all brackets, double the child tax credit and repeal the so-called ''death tax'' on estates -- a change that would benefit primarily the richest American families. Taken together, the Bush tax proposals would award 42.6 percent of the tax reductions to the wealthiest 1 percent of taxpayers, according to Citizens for Tax Justice, a liberal-leaning research group that bases its projections on figures from the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation.</p>
        <p>Bush supporters emphasize the middle-class beneficiaries of the tax cut. They also argue that since the wealthiest pay most of the taxes, it is not unjust for them to get most of the benefit. But according to the Treasury Department, the wealthiest 1 percent of taxpayers account for 14.8 percent of total income and 20.1 percent of tax revenues. To give them 42.6 percent of a $1.3 trillion tax cut over 10 years makes no sense -- unless the goal is to comfort the already comfortable. To oppose that idea is not just populism. It is common sense.</p>
        <p>Contrary to Mr. Bush's claims, these are not ''fuzzy'' numbers. They illuminate the desire by most Americans for a fair-minded tax code that taxes those most able to pay at higher rates, without reducing the incentive for the rich to increase their wealth. That principle of progressivity has been around since the income tax was first enacted during the Civil War. It is a precept that lies at the core of a just society, as most of its members would understand it.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore may continue to hammer at this point, and be accused of waging class warfare. But he has astutely sensed that public fervor for tax cuts, so prevalent in the 1980's, has given way to broader concerns with equity and fiscal responsibility. There can be no more important goal for a society than to reward its burdens and benefits in a recognizably fair way. Mr. Bush's tax proposals do not meet that test.</p>
