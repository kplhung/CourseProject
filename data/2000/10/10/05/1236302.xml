        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The column about WordPerfect was right on the money. My assistant and I create manuals that must be frequently updated. These are very long documents, with frequent use of indents, borders, bullets, font changes, margin changes, page formats, etc., with footers and headers. All these formatting issues are best dealt with in WordPerfect, and Reveal Codes is essential. It is extremely difficult to control paragraph indents, bullets and even page numbering in a long document in Word. We have found that WordPerfect 9 mimics Word perhaps too closely -- it now sometimes takes off on its own or refuses to accept commands. WordPerfect 9 is not as stable as WordPerfect 8.</p>
