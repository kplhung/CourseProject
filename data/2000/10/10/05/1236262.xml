        <p>Barry Bonds's reputation preceded him when he came to bat in the third inning at Pacific Bell Park today. That is what the Mets thought, at least, after a borderline pitch went Bonds's way and nothing was the same in the opening game of their division series with the Giants.</p>
        <p>Bonds smacked a triple on the next pitch from Mike Hampton, giving the Giants a lead they kept. The Mets' right fielder, Derek Bell, injured himself on the play, and Hampton lost his rhythm.</p>
        <p>Two batters later, the left field foul pole interrupted the flight path of a deep drive by Ellis Burks. The Giants had a three-run homer and a 5-1 lead. The Mets had some chances, but Livan Hernandez and two relievers were stingy. The score never changed.</p>
        <p>The game was tied, 1-1, when Bill Mueller singled with two outs in the third. Mueller had doubled and scored in the first, when Bonds helped along a rally with a single. This time, Bonds worked the count to 2-2 against Hampton, then laid off a four-seam fastball that may have been a bit outside. Home plate umpire Jeff Kellogg called it ball three.</p>
        <p>''It could have gone either way,'' Hampton said. ''Ninety-nine times out of 100, it's going to go to the Hall of Famer.'' Still, Hampton took a step toward the visitors' dugout, hoping the inning was over. On the bench, the Mets felt the pitch was a strike. But, like Hampton, they understood that Bonds -- a three-time Most Valuable Player who has led the league in walks six times -- usually gets close calls.</p>
        <p>''Does he deserve that pitch, based on what he's done in the past? Sure,'' said Mets outfielder Darryl Hamilton. ''But it's the playoffs, and we're trying to win out there. So we don't want anyone given things.''</p>
        <p>Giants Manager Dusty Baker noticed Hampton's body language after that pitch, and he said the call might have affected Hampton, an intense and demonstrative pitcher. Hampton disagreed; his next pitch, an inside sinker, was O.K., he said.</p>
        <p>But Bonds has quick hands, Hampton said, and he hit the ball hard, a liner just inside first base. It kicked off the bullpen mound and caromed off a side wall angled toward the infield. Bell headed toward the corner in pursuit, but when the ball bounced into mid-right field, Bell re-directed and slipped.</p>
        <p>He hobbled after the ball, retrieving it and tossing it gamely as Bonds pulled into third. The game was delayed for several minutes as a trainer attended to Bell, who stayed in the game briefly before removing himself with a sprained right ankle. X-rays on the ankle were negative, but General Manager Steve Phillips said Bell was doubtful for Game 2 on Thursday.</p>
        <p>Hampton took two warm-up tosses during the injury delay, and after the game, Manager Bobby Valentine said: ''I should have had Mike throw more. He lost his rhythm after that.''</p>
        <p>Hampton did not agree. He seemed unnerved by the 2-2 call and the triple, walking Jeff Kent on four pitches, but that was more or less the plan. ''If he was going to swing, he was going to hit one of my pitches,'' Hampton said. ''I was going to go after Ellis.''</p>
        <p>Burks, a .344 hitter, turned on a cut fastball, crushing it, then stood at home plate. There was no need to start running. Burks knew the ball would land foul or be a game-turning home run. ''I knew it had the distance,'' he said.</p>
        <p>When the ball struck the foul pole, the Giants had a 5-1 lead. For the next six innings, the team with the best record in baseball treated 40,430 fans to flawlessly executed baseball. Whenever the Giants needed an out, they got it. They made standout plays, threw smart pitches and immediately reversed their mistakes.</p>
        <p>The Mets scored their only run on a sacrifice fly, and were 0 for 6 with runners in scoring position. The Mets batted .243 in that situation this season, the worst average in the majors, and they may have been afflicted today by their September habit of trying too hard.</p>
        <p>''Guys are probably pressing; they want to get that big hit,'' said left fielder Benny Agbayani. ''That's a problem sometimes. Everybody wants to do it right then and there, instead of just letting everything happen one at a time. The big hits are going to come; we just have to keep battling. There's no time to be looking back.''</p>
        <p>Hernandez will give a team chances, said Mets first baseman Todd Zeile, a former teammate. He is never really on or off, Zeile said; Hernandez simply stays confident and does not worry when he gets himself into jams. ''He's almost effortless,'' Zeile said.</p>
        <p>The 25-year-old Hernandez was making his first postseason appearance since the 1997 World Series, when he beat Cleveland twice and won the Most Valuable Player award for Florida. He got nine flyouts and four pop-ups over seven and two-thirds innings, negating some good swings by the Mets with a sharply breaking slider.</p>
        <p>The right-center-field power alley is 421 feet from home plate at Pac Bell, and Mike Piazza, who was 0 for 3, said Hernandez invited the Mets to hit him there. ''It's tailor-made for him,'' Piazza said.</p>
        <p>Hernandez benefited from strong throws by shortstop Rich Aurilia, and he was not hurt by two Giants miscues.</p>
        <p>Center fielder Marvin Benard misjudged Edgardo Alfonzo's fly ball with two outs and two on in the fifth, but scrambled back a few steps to catch it. With two on in the eighth, Robin Ventura's grounder got stuck in Kent's glove, and he bobbled it after wresting it loose. But Kent, too, recovered, firing to first for the out.</p>
        <p>Hernandez walked the next hitter and left with two outs and two on in the eighth, holding his cap aloft and waving with both arms to the fans. Felix Rodriguez came on and fanned Hamilton, ending the inning. Closer Robb Nen worked a 1-2-3 ninth to close it out.</p>
        <p>''Our guys got big outs, too,'' Valentine said, referring to Turk Wendell, Rick White and Glendon Rusch, who all escaped similar jams. ''But they already had a lead.''</p>
        <p>And now, the Giants have a 1-0 series lead, with two of the next four games remaining at a park where they went 54-19 beginning with a four-game sweep of the Mets in May. Realistically, the Mets could not have expected to win both games here. But winning Thursday's Game 2 is imperative.</p>
        <p>''Any time you face a team that tied you for the best home record, it's very difficult to say you're going to take two from them,'' Hamilton said. ''We knew we'd have to try to get a split and bring it home. That's the goal.''</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>The left-hander GLENDON RUSCH came on in the eighth inning. BOBBY VALENTINE said before the game that Rusch would be available, and not the right-hander BOBBY J. JONES -- though that did not mean Valentine was ready to announce his starter for a possible Game 4.</p>
