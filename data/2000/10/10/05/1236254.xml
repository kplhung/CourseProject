        <p>In a team sport, an individual star often gets credit for the success of the group. When the team fails, blame is usually more dispersed. But as the Chicago White Sox have lost twice to the Seattle Mariners in the first round of the baseball playoffs, it has been hard to overlook the performance of Frank Thomas, the veteran slugger who led the Sox to the best record in the American League this season.</p>
        <p>Seattle defeated the White Sox, 5-2, this afternoon, leaving the wild-card Mariners one victory away from a sweep of the three-of-five-game series. Thomas batted four times and had no hits, hitting the ball high and harmlessly each time. In Game 1, a 7-4 Seattle victory on Monday, Thomas was 0 for 3 with two walks. His outs then were all on soft, short flies.</p>

        <p>In a team sport, an individual star often gets credit for the success of the group. When the team fails, blame is usually more dispersed. But as the Chicago White Sox have lost twice to the Seattle Mariners in the first round of the baseball playoffs, it has been hard to overlook the performance of Frank Thomas, the veteran slugger who led the Sox to the best record in the American League this season.</p>
        <p>Seattle defeated the White Sox, 5-2, this afternoon, leaving the wild-card Mariners one victory away from a sweep of the three-of-five-game series. Thomas batted four times and had no hits, hitting the ball high and harmlessly each time. In Game 1, a 7-4 Seattle victory on Monday, Thomas was 0 for 3 with two walks. His outs then were all on soft, short flies.</p>
        <p>Thomas took his time today before discussing his efforts, waiting almost an hour before emerging from private clubhouse quarters. But when he arrived wearing a blue suit and a big diamond in his left ear lobe, the big man spoke bluntly about his failures. Among them were a fly ball to left with no outs and a man on third base in the first inning off Paul Abbott, the starter and winner, and a fly ball to center with runners on first and second and one man out in the seventh off Jose Mesa.</p>
        <p>''I guess I'm overpressing, not doing what I normally do,'' Thomas said. ''I think it's making everyone else uncomfortable. I'm just popping balls up. This is sad. This is terrible. I feel real bad because I've let a lot of people down.</p>
        <p>''I've set the tone all year. I definitely need to set a better tone. I haven't really popped up this many balls all year. Of course I'm taking responsibility. I'm not getting it done and this bothers me. A guy on third, less than two outs, I've got to get him home. That's what I'm paid to do, bottom line. I'm frustrated. I've worked very hard to get to this point to see it slip away like this, me being 0 for 7.''</p>
        <p>The Sox also got no hits today from the fourth, fifth and sixth hitters, who bat after Thomas. The Mariners, as they did Monday, produced at crucial times. Today, it was a solo home run by Jay Buhner off Mike Sirotka, the loser, to break a 2-2 tie in the top of the fourth. And Seattle got another save from Kazuhiro Sasaki, who saved Game 1. Today, he struck out all three batters in the ninth inning as shadows covered home plate while sunshine illuminated the mound.</p>
        <p>Seattle's bullpen has pitched 10 scoreless innings and allowed only 3 hits in the first 2 games. Arthur Rhodes, Mesa and Sasaki did not allow a hit today in relief of Abbott.</p>
        <p>Abbott, a journeyman with a 21-17 record since breaking into the major leagues in 1990, was elated by his first success in the postseason. ''This is a dream come true,'' said Abbott, who gave up consecutive doubles to start the first inning but only three more hits over five and two-thirds innings. ''It couldn't have been any more fun today. Playing on the road in front of 45,000 Chicago screaming fans, they're not going to make it easy for you. For me, that was a blast, just being part of it.''</p>
        <p>But much more attention went to Thomas, because so much was expected of him. In the regular season, he batted .328 with 43 home runs and 143 runs batted in. It was said that his personality changed for the better after a two-year slump (by his high standards) and a big argument with Manager Jerry Manuel in spring training.</p>
        <p>Thomas, 32 years old, held a big party for his teammates after the final regular-season game Sunday. He spoke before this series about how the Sox players enjoy each other and were primed for their first playoffs since 1993. Thomas, one of few Chicago players on the roster then, batted .353 in 1993's playoffs and drove in three runs in six games.</p>
        <p>He said he was surprised in this series because he felt comfortable with his swing and was not striking out. He said he was ''missing the ball'' in the sense that he saw the pitches well but did not put the bat flush against the ball. Instead, he has fouled it back or lofted it.</p>
        <p>''I haven't been swinging the bat that well in day games all year,'' Thomas said. ''Hopefully, we can try to do something to make me feel it's night, because this is terrible.'' Games 3 and 4 are scheduled for Seattle on Friday and Saturday afternoon, beginning at 1 o'clock local time.</p>
        <p>Thomas said he would look at videotape before then to study his swing.</p>
        <p>''Who knows if it's adrenaline or just overswinging,'' he said. ''I don't feel like I'm struggling. That's the problem. My bat's not tired at all, no way. I've got tremendous bat speed right now. I'm just popping balls up.''</p>
