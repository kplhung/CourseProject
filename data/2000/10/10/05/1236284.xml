        <p>IT was right at the trading deadline, at the end of July of last year, and the news had leaked. The Yankees were about to deal one of their top pitchers. Andy Pettitte, who had been struggling, was about to change uniforms, swapping the Bronx Bomber pinstripes for the Phillies' candy stripes.</p>
        <p>''It was ready to happen, if the Boss wanted it,'' recalled Brian Cashman, the Yankees' general manager. The Boss was one George Michael Steinbrenner III. ''But almost everyone in the organization wanted Andy to stay, especially me,'' Cashman said. ''I'm a big believer in a track record, and Andy had a great track record with us. George listened -- that's one of his virtues -- and decided not to pull the trigger.''</p>

        <p>IT was right at the trading deadline, at the end of July of last year, and the news had leaked. The Yankees were about to deal one of their top pitchers. Andy Pettitte, who had been struggling, was about to change uniforms, swapping the Bronx Bomber pinstripes for the Phillies' candy stripes.</p>
        <p>''It was ready to happen, if the Boss wanted it,'' recalled Brian Cashman, the Yankees' general manager. The Boss was one George Michael Steinbrenner III. ''But almost everyone in the organization wanted Andy to stay, especially me,'' Cashman said. ''I'm a big believer in a track record, and Andy had a great track record with us. George listened -- that's one of his virtues -- and decided not to pull the trigger.''</p>
        <p>When the trade wasn't made, Pettitte called Cashman aside in the clubhouse.</p>
        <p>''Thanks for keeping me here,'' Pettitte said.</p>
        <p>Cashman held up his hand, with his 1998 Yankee World Series ring glistening.</p>
        <p>''I wouldn't have this without you,'' Cashman said.</p>
        <p>Last night, the Yankees once again were returning the thank you to Pettitte, who was masterly in beating the A's, 4-0, to tie the series at one game apiece as the show journeys across the continent to resume tomorrow at Yankee Stadium.</p>
        <p>When the Yankees had become desperate for a victory, had become almost despairing for a victory -- they had lost 16 of their last 19 games, and 8 straight, including Game 1 of this series on Tuesday -- Andrew Eugene Pettitte of Baton Rouge, La., a left-hander, came to the rescue, all 6 feet 5 inches, 225 pounds of him.</p>
        <p>In fact, in his last start, in the last weekend of the regular season, Pettitte, going for his 20th victory in a game against Baltimore, lasted just one and a third innings; he was pounded for nine runs and was also on the mound long enough to walk three straight batters, an anomaly with a control pitcher like Pettitte.</p>
        <p>''It's a whole new season,'' Pettitte had said before this series began. ''The postseason is different. You can throw out the end of the season.''</p>
        <p>The opposition seemed to agree. ''He's the pitcher on the Yankees who scares us the most,'' A's third baseman Eric Chavez said.</p>
        <p>''He's a big-game pitcher,'' said Randy Velarde, the A's second baseman. ''He's made for this kind of atmosphere.''</p>
        <p>And their manager, Art Howe, said: ''Pettitte won't wilt, he's not going to beat himself. You've got to beat him.''</p>
        <p>Last night Pettitte, 7-4 in postseason play, was the picture of professionalism. Watching his intensity on the mound, it was clear that he understood he had to be this good since the Yankees' bats appeared to be made of sponge. He even was seen to be mumbling to himself.  ''He holds little conferences with himself on the mound,'' Joe Torre, the Yankee manager, said.</p>
        <p>What does he say? ''If I start overthrowing, I'll say something like, 'Stay back,' '' Pettitte said. ''It's just to get me locked in my concentration, and my focus tonight was good.'' At one point in the middle of the game, Pettitte retired 13 straight batters. This is not a new thing. At age 28, and over the last five years, he trails only Pedro Martinez and Greg Maddux in total wins -- Pettitte has 88, two behind Martinez and Maddux. Then the Yankees scored three runs in the sixth. This was a surfeit of riches, since last night Pettitte needed but one run to achieve his goal.</p>
        <p>Pettitte put out just a few small Oakland uprisings, until the eighth. Then with two out, he gave up a double to Ramon Hernandez. An easy ground ball by Terrence Long to Luis Sojo at second was going to get him out of the inning, but Sojo tripped himself, and flipped into the air and fell in a heap, like a vaudeville routine, still holding the ball. With runners now on first and third, and Pettitte having thrown 100 pitches and some change, Torre decided that Pettitte had done more than his share for the evening. He removed him for the relief pitcher Mariano Rivera, who retired the next batter and shut the A's down in the ninth.</p>
        <p>Pettitte looked stunned when he was removed. ''I thought, 'This ain't gonna happen,' '' he said. ''This was a huge game for us. I didn't want to come out.'' But then he righted himself and left the game graciously. Which is of a piece with what we know about Pettitte. ''He's the kind of guy who doesn't call attention to himself,'' Cashman had said. ''He's such a quiet, decent person.''</p>
        <p>Cashman thought back about that time in July of 1999 when Pettitte almost became a Phillies pitcher.</p>
        <p>''But from that point forward,'' Cashman recalled, ''he went 6-1. It was lights out.''</p>
        <p>Like, if you're keeping score, last night.</p>
