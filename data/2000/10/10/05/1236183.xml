        <p>The Firstar Corporation agreed yesterday to acquire U.S. Bancorp in a $21 billion stock deal that unites two large regional banks led by brothers.</p>
        <p>The combination of the Milwaukee-based Firstar, whose chief executive is Jerry A. Grundhofer, and the Minneapolis-based U.S. Bancorp, which is led by his younger brother, John F. Grundhofer, will create the nation's eighth-biggest bank, with more than $160 billion in assets.</p>
        <p>The negotiations started with a telephone call by John Grundhofer in mid-September. His brother was eager to talk. ''Our board always looks at alternatives'' Jerry Grundhofer said yesterday. ''We had a wish list, and it always seemed to gravitate toward U.S. Bancorp.''</p>
        <p>The fact that he is buying his brother's company will only help, he said, adding, ''I've always found it easy to talk to Jack.''</p>
        <p>Firstar is paying 1.265 shares of its stock for each share of U.S. Bancorp, valuing the bank at $28.15 a share, a 21 percent premium to its closing price of $23.19 on Tuesday. Shares of U.S. Bancorp rose $1.81 yesterday, to $25. Firstar fell $2.25, to $20, reducing the value of the deal to $25.30 a share, or $19 billion.</p>
        <p>The boards of both companies have approved the deal. The surviving company will be known as U.S. Bancorp, but Firstar's management will control 14 of 25 board seats and 50.5 percent of the stock. Jerry Grundhofer will serve as president and chief executive, while John Grundhofer will be chairman until the end of 2002.</p>
        <p>The deal unites two institutions with complementary strengths and weaknesses. Firstar has a strong retail franchise, which accounted for 50 percent of its earnings in the most recent quarter and has been growing at 21 percent a year. U.S. Bancorp has struggled with its retail business, and an anemic 6 percent growth rate has largely contributed to the company's recent earnings disappointments.</p>
        <p>''That business has been an albatross around their necks for the last year,'' said Jon Arfstrom, an analyst with Dain Rauscher Wessels in Minneapolis.</p>
        <p>The U.S. Bancorp acquisition allows Firstar to diversify away from its core lending business. U.S. Bancorp owns the regional brokerage firm Piper Jaffray, which it acquired in 1998, as well as a payment-systems business that includes corporate charge and purchasing cards. Thanks largely to these subsidiaries, fee-based activities will account for 43 percent of the combined company's earnings, compared with 35 percent currently for Firstar.</p>
        <p>Banks have been eager to expand their mix of businesses that generate fees to reduce their vulnerability to credit cycles and interest rate swings.</p>
        <p>U.S. Bancorp also brings Firstar some geographic advantages: 52 percent of its deposits come from metropolitan areas in California and the Pacific Northwest, where household growth is twice as strong as it is in the Midwestern regions served by Firstar's branches.</p>
        <p>What the two banks do have in common are lagging stock prices. Both companies' share prices have been virtually flat this year, with U.S. Bancorp held back by a series of earnings disappointments and Firstar restrained by worries that the company was about to announce an acquisition.</p>
        <p>Firstar is the product of two mergers, which led the company to grow to $74 billion in assets from $20 billion over the last three years. As Firstar's management completed the integration of its most recent deal, last year's $9 billion merger with the Mercantile Bancorporation, its stock began to falter as investors anticipated its next move.</p>
        <p>Firstar shareholders are not likely to see the stock rebound soon, even though the company has announced a deal, Mr. Vander Ploeg said. With $86 billion in assets, U.S. Bancorp is a far bigger bite than any acquisition Firstar has tackled so far, he said.</p>
        <p>''Investors will want to see evidence of revenue growth before they are willing to buy the stock,'' he said. ''That's not likely to happen for the next 12 months.'' Mr. Vander Ploeg downgraded his rating on Firstar's shares yesterday, to ''market perform'' from ''strong buy.''</p>
        <p>Both Grundhofers said they were unconcerned by the stock market's short-term reaction to their deal. Firstar is projecting that the purchase, scheduled to close in the first quarter next year, will increase earnings 3.7 percent in 2001.</p>
