        <p>The Energy Department sold 30 million barrels of crude oil yesterday from the country's Strategic Petroleum Reserve to 11 companies, defying predictions that refiners might boycott the sale and buoying a White House campaign to replenish low stocks of heating fuel in the Northeast.</p>
        <p>News of the sale drove the price of crude oil for November delivery down 64 cents, or 2 percent, to $31.43 a barrel in New York yesterday, just as the announcement of plans to tap the reserve had sent prices tumbling earlier. ''Now we're on the road to averting a home heating oil disruption on the East Coast,'' Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said.</p>
        <p>Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, who had criticized the administration's plan as political opportunism, had no comment after the successful sale. But some analysts warned that uncertainties remained as to whether the sale would bring more heating oil to consumers soon, because refineries were already running at capacity.</p>
        <p>Structured as a swap, the sale of the 30 million barrels drew offers from the buyers to deliver a total of 31.5 million barrels to the federal stockpile between August and November of next year. At the latest, all the oil from the reserve should be delivered from the Gulf Coast salt domes where it is stored to the terminals and ports designated by the buyers by the end of next month, the department said.</p>
        <p>Inventories of heating oil in the Northeast fell by about 300,000 barrels last week, according to data reported this week. Total heating fuel stocks in the region stand at about 24 million barrels, or 50 percent less than a year ago, a shortfall that has alarmed policy makers and consumers.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, critics of the decision to release the government oil have argued that the 570-million-barrel reserve was created after the Arab oil embargo in the 1970's to protect against serious disruptions in oil supply, not to soften the blow of lagging inventories or high prices. Many detractors, including Mr. Bush, the Republican presidential candidate, saw in the administration's move a pre-election populist gesture to buoy the campaign of Vice President Al Gore.</p>
        <p>Indeed, as late as Wednesday morning, oil markets were abuzz with rumors that the sale would not find enough buyers, because oil companies might boycott it as unnecessary and a dangerous tampering with the market.</p>
        <p>Although several large oil companies, including Exxon Mobil, did not participate in the swap because they had enough oil for their refining needs, the successful bidders included such major United States refiners as BP Amoco and Valero Marketing and Supply, a unit of Valero Energy of San Antonio. Market-moving traders like Vitol S.A. and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter were also buyers.</p>
        <p>''We'll be splitting the oil between two of our Gulf Coast refineries,'' said Mary Rose Brown, a spokeswoman for Valero. ''It's a good deal, in that we're getting expensive oil today and can replace it with less expensive oil in a year.''</p>
        <p>But Ms. Brown and others said it remained to be seen how soon heating oil supplies would begin to rise.</p>
        <p>Despite the favorable terms of the swap, Valero, for example, bought only one million barrels because, like most American refiners, it is running at nearly maximum capacity. Other refiners will shut units down this month for maintenance, further reducing refining capacity by about 3 percent to 5 percent.</p>
        <p>To prod the refining process along a bit, the Energy Department made sure that 25 million of the 30 million barrels it sold was ''sweet'' crude, stored at its sites in West Hackberry, La. Sweet crude has less sulfur than ''sour'' crude, making it easier and faster to refine -- a key consideration as temperatures in the Northeast drop.</p>
        <p>Market experts expressed some concern that either the crude itself or the refined heating oil might leave the nation for more lucrative markets in Europe, where supplies of heating fuel are at even more perilously low levels than in the Northeast. Buyers of the reserve crude are free to apply for export licenses, though the length of the process might discourage such a move.</p>
        <p>''Once these companies take title of the oil, I don't know how the government can prevent export of crude or refined product; it's too hard to monitor,'' said John Kilduff, senior vice president at Fimat, a commodities trading arm of Societe Generale. ''Over the past several weeks, there have been exports to Europe, despite the dire situation in the Northeast.''</p>
        <p>But purchasers of the crude assert that the appetite in the United States is strong enough to keep the oil here.</p>
        <p>''Why do it? We have contracts to provide 12 million barrels of light sweet crude in 2001,'' said Renard Euell, chief executive of Euell Energy, a small concern in Aurora, Colo., that bought three million barrels of sweet crude. ''The oil is in the United States, and we have contracts to move the crude within the U.S. We think we can help build those stocks in the Northeast.''</p>
