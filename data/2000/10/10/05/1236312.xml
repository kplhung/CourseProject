        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Bush and Gore Stake Out Differences in First Debate'' (front page, Oct. 4):</p>
        <p>The problem with Al Gore is that on one side of his mouth he has said the economy is great, and on the other side he suggests that the gap between rich and poor is widening.  Hasn't it widened further over the last eight years?</p>
        <p>Why hasn't this administration closed the gap over the last eight years with the same skill it used to guide this great economy? How can Mr. Gore take credit for the good parts of the economy and separate himself from the bad?</p>
        <p>The vice president seems to imply that Mr. Bush's tax-cut proposals, which will disproportionately benefit the rich, would cause this gap to grow. Although it's unknown what the effects of such a proposal would be, I know for sure that under this vice president's watch, the poor and a large part of the middle class have been left behind economically. If Al Gore wants to take credit for the great economy, he must accept the positives as well as the negatives. He can't have it both ways.</p>
