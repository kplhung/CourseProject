        <p>In the Limelight</p>
        <p>The actress Julia Roberts will be the honoree when American Museum of the Moving Image holds its 16th black-tie gala salute in the Grand Ballroom of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel on Feb. 28. Previous recipients of this honor include Sidney Lumet, James Stewart, Robert De Niro, Dustin Hoffman and Al Pacino. . . . At the New York Hilton Hotel tomorrow the actor-director Rob Reiner will be the target of the annual Celebrity Roast of the New York Friars Club.</p>
        <p>As It Was</p>
        <p>The exhibition spans the years from 1912 to 1948, a time of social activism that intensified during the Depression. And it focuses on artists whose work was shaped by social and political awareness. The show, opening on Saturday and continuing through Jan. 14 at the Museum of the City of New York, is ''Life of the People: Realist Prints and Drawings From the Ben and Beatrice Goldstein Collection, 1912-1948'' (below). The 59 drawings come from a collection of some 2,000 works on paper assembled by Ben Goldstein, a garment manufacturer and labor advocate, and his wife, Beatrice, and left to the Library of Congress.</p>
        <p>Old but New</p>
        <p>Straight from the Victoria and Albert Museum in London and bound for the Metropolitan Art Museum in Tokyo, the exhibition described as the largest ever devoted to Art Nouveau opens at the National Gallery of Art in Washington on Sunday. Including a Paris Metropolitan entrance by Hector Guimard, this celebration of this exuberant modern art style embraces more than 350 works in painting, sculpture, glass, graphics, ceramics, textiles, furniture, jewelry and architecture. With highlights from the 1900 World's Fair in Paris, ''Art Nouveau, 1890-1914'' (right), through Jan. 28, dwells on the eight cities where the style flourished, including Brussels, Glasgow, Vienna, Munich, Turin, New York and Chicago.</p>
        <p>Footnotes</p>
        <p>The Cairo Opera has canceled this year's performance of Verdi's ''Aida'' at the Pyramids, citing a conflict with parliamentary elections starting on Oct. 18 and associated concerns about security. The Culture Ministry said the performances, traditionally held in October, will resume in 2001, the centenary of Verdi's death. . . . The first copies of ''The Beatles Anthology,'' a 300,000-word illustrated oral autobiography, go on sale today around the world. It's an outgrowth of six years of secret meetings among Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr. . . . The directorship of the Cannes International Film Festival will be shared. Veronique Cayla was named general director and Thierry Fremaux artistic director. They succeed Olivier Barrot, who held the post briefly this year after he succeeded Gilles Jacob, now the festival president.</p>
