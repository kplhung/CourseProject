        <p>After a three-day strike aimed at forcing concessions from the government and shippers, Spanish truckers reached an agreement today on higher rates and a tax break to offset rising fuel prices and began dismantling their blockades of border crossing points.</p>
        <p>''Everything should be returning to normal very soon,'' the development minister, Francisco Alvarez Cascos, said as the deal was signed. Madrid had been under pressure from the European Union to end the strike and get crossborder freight traffic flowing again.</p>

        <p>After a three-day strike aimed at forcing concessions from the government and shippers, Spanish truckers reached an agreement today on higher rates and a tax break to offset rising fuel prices and began dismantling their blockades of border crossing points.</p>
        <p>''Everything should be returning to normal very soon,'' the development minister, Francisco Alvarez Cascos, said as the deal was signed. Madrid had been under pressure from the European Union to end the strike and get crossborder freight traffic flowing again.</p>
        <p>Thousands of rigs had sealed off crossings into France at La Junquera and Irun since Monday, allowing only passenger vehicles through. Other blockades were set up at two main highways into Portugal and at major routes into Valencia, Salamanca and other cities.</p>
        <p>Some drivers holding out for a better deal refused to move their trucks in Irun and vowed to continue the protest, but a spokeswoman for the Development Ministry said authorities expected traffic to return to normal there by Thursday.</p>
        <p>The strike had little effect on supplies of food or gasoline, but by the second day automakers like Mercedes-Benz, Nissan, Opel, Citroen and Renault were shutting down production and sending workers home for lack of parts and a backlog in shipments.</p>
        <p>Some automobile plants chartered planes and helicopters to fly in parts to keep their assembly lines rolling.</p>
        <p>The truckers had complained that their operating costs were rising extravagantly because of soaring fuel prices. Along with fishermen, farmers and taxi drivers, they were demanding that the center-right government of Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar sharply reduce fuel taxes, which can account for up to 60 percent of the pump price.</p>
        <p>Since world petroleum prices began to climb, diesel prices in Spain have risen by 15 percent, to about $2.40 a gallon.</p>
        <p>Under the accord with the truckers, shippers agreed to raise the tonnage fees they pay by 10 percent and the government promised low-interest loans and tax rebates.</p>
        <p>Fuel price protests broke out across Spain more than two weeks ago and the government hammered out accords with associations of fishermen and farmers by promising them income-tax cuts and soft loans. Workers in some sectors have pledged to continue to press their demands for a fuel-tax cut, which the government rejects, and taxi drivers are still threatening strikes like one they staged on Tuesday.</p>

        <p>Fuel Protest in Romania</p>
        <p>BUCHAREST, Romania, Oct. 4  Reuters</p>
        <p>Truck and taxi drivers angered by high diesel and gasoline prices blocked roads outside government offices today, snarling traffic throughout Bucharest.</p>
        <p>Hundreds of trucks, vans and taxis drove through Bucharest, blocking traffic on main streets in protests similar to those that hit western Europe last month.</p>
        <p>Trade union leaders started talks with the government in an effort to resolve the issue. Drivers have threatened to block access to several refineries across the country if the talks fail.</p>
        <p>The drivers are demanding a 50 percent cut in excise duties for gasoline and diesel oil and a freeze on fuel and energy prices. Excise duties and taxes represent around 75 percent of the retail price of gasoline and diesel.</p>
        <p>The national oil company raised retail prices last month for leaded gasoline to almost $2 a gallon.</p>
