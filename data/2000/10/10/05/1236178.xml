        <p>Before the Olympic Games opened in Sydney last month, the aging gold medalists Bruce Jenner, Dorothy Hamill and Bart Conner were talking more about their arthritis than the coming events.</p>
        <p>There's a good reason. All three athletes are being paid by either Merck or Pharmacia to appear on talk shows and speak to groups about the new prescription pain relievers that they are taking for their sore joints.</p>
        <p>The testimonials are part of one of the fiercest and most expensive battles now being waged in the pharmaceutical business: the war between Merck's Vioxx and Pharmacia's Celebrex. Since last year, Merck and Pharmacia, which has hired the drug giant Pfizer to help sell its new drug, have each been spending tens of millions of dollars a month on marketing their new blockbuster pain relievers to patients and doctors.</p>
        <p>The money is paying for television and print advertisements, for stipends to hundreds of doctors to speak on behalf of the drugs and for millions of free samples of the medications, known as Cox-2 inhibitors. Each side now has more than 4,000 representatives visiting doctors to promote the drugs.</p>
        <p>They are not alone. All drugmakers are pouring resources into marketing, trying to please investors who have come to expect sales of a top drug to exceed $1 billion a year. While drug companies once waited for sales of a new drug to gradually take off, they now must sell as much of a drug as possible, just as soon as it hits pharmacy shelves. If not, they risk disappointing the very expectant stock analysts on Wall Street.</p>
        <p>In the case of Vioxx and Celebrex, the marketing efforts have paid off handsomely for all three companies selling the drugs. In the history of the pharmaceutical industry, no other drugs have earned more money for their makers in their first year on the market, not even the anti-impotence drug Viagra. The companies expect to sell about $4 billion worth of the painkillers this year.</p>
        <p>Both drugs are hot sellers, but Merck, long known for its research rather than its marketing, has surprised Wall Street by turning up the heat under Vioxx. Pharmacia began selling Celebrex six months before Vioxx arrived, but Merck has almost caught up. While Celebrex still outsells Vioxx, the Merck drug overtook the Pharmacia medication -- in terms of new prescriptions -- during the third week of September, according to statistics released this week by IMS Health, a health care information company.</p>
        <p>Merck has become a more aggressive marketer because five of its best-selling drugs will lose their patent protection in the next two years. When a drug loses its patent, which grants exclusive ownership rights, less costly generic drugs can quickly eat into brand-name sales.</p>
        <p>The new pain relievers are considered a scientific breakthrough by many doctors because, even though they have not been shown to relieve pain any better than widely available drugs like ibuprofen, they appear to have fewer side effects. In particular, studies by the companies have found the Cox-2 inhibitors lower the risk of developing ulcers, which in rare cases can be a dangerous side effect of anti-inflammatory pain relievers like aspirin and ibuprofen.</p>
        <p>But the issue of side effects is not settled. The Food and Drug Administration still requires the companies to warn patients that the new drugs could cause ulcers.</p>
        <p>The drugs have set off a debate among doctors over whether they are worth the attention that they have been given.</p>
        <p>And, their popularity has alarmed health insurance companies, which have watched as the cost of caring for their arthritis patients has skyrocketed. Robert Seidman, vice president for pharmacy for Wellpoint Health Networks, an insurer in California, said that a monthly prescription for Celebrex cost about $86 -- eight times the cost of treating someone with generic prescription pain relievers. Vioxx is priced similarly to Celebrex.</p>
        <p>Wellpoint, like most insurers, has tried to limit prescriptions of Celebrex and Vioxx by setting strict conditions for patients to meet before the company will pay for the drug.</p>
        <p>''When you read the medical literature, maybe 5 to 6 percent of people are at risk'' of developing a serious ulcer, Mr. Seidman said. ''The vast majority of people have been comfortable with other drugs.''</p>
        <p>Despite such efforts, the expensive Cox-2 drugs are quickly replacing prescriptions written for generic pain relievers like ibuprofen, leading to a significant increase in costs to treat arthritis.</p>
        <p>American sales of anti-inflammatory pain relievers, including Cox-2 drugs, rose 65 percent in the last 12 months, to $4.5 billion, according to IMS Health. Before the Cox-2's arrived, the market for anti-inflammatory drugs had been in decline.</p>
        <p>The surge in sales came soon after the F.D.A. approved Celebrex on Dec. 31, 1998. Within days, executives at Pfizer and Monsanto, which developed the drug before being acquired last year by Pharmacia, started a huge campaign to teach physicians about Celebrex. They placed more calls to doctors than any company had ever done for any other drug, said Joseph C. Papa, president of  Pharmacia's North American sales operation.</p>
        <p>To educate consumers, Monsanto and Pfizer also enlisted members of the American Gastroenterological Association in a campaign paid for by the companies that encouraged people with arthritis and other patients to take a quiz to see if they might be at risk for developing serious ulcers. Those found to be at risk were encouraged to talk to their doctor.</p>
        <p>Pharmacia's marketing was so effective, in fact, that it gave its rival Vioxx a boost. By the time the F.D.A. approved Vioxx, in May 1999, doctors and consumers were well versed in the benefits of the Cox-2 drugs, making Merck's job far easier.</p>
        <p>Merck quickly started spending millions of dollars on consumer advertising and even began a commercial on television a month before Pharmacia started a major TV ad campaign. During the first four months of this year, Merck spent $67 million to advertise Vioxx to consumers, according to Scott-Levin, a consulting concern. That was more than any company spent to advertise any other drug.</p>
        <p>Seeing Vioxx's success, Pharmacia early this year began offering a $5 rebate to patients who receive a new prescription of Celebrex.</p>
        <p>As the companies fight to dominate the market for Cox-2's, physicians have found themselves in the middle of the battleground.</p>
        <p>Dr. Randy Sassich, a resident in internal medicine at Barnes-Jewish Hospital in St. Louis, said that shortly after Vioxx was approved in May 1999, he suddenly saw more free Celebrex samples in the hospital. One resident was carrying a box of Celebrex samples the size of a small microwave oven, he said.</p>
        <p>And he said that a representative from one of the companies, while visiting the hospital's rheumatology clinic, had suggested that his competitor was suppressing a study that showed its drug in an unfavorable light. ''It's competitive and ugly,'' Dr. Sassich said.</p>
        <p>Both companies also hired former Olympians to help in their campaign. Pharmacia hired Bart Conner, 42, who won two gold medals in gymnastics in 1984 while Merck hired Bruce Jenner, 50, who won the decathlon in 1976, and Dorothy Hamill, 44, who earned the gold in figure skating the same year. In late August, Mr. Jenner and Ms. Hamill -- on Merck's expense account -- began traveling to Arthritis Foundation chapters in large cities around the country and telling arthritis sufferers about Vioxx.</p>
        <p>In the days before the Olympics started, many newspapers and television stations quickly jumped at the chance to interview Mr. Jenner and Ms. Hamill about their arthritis. Larry King on CNN, for instance, interviewed the athletes during his entire hourlong show on Aug. 29.</p>
        <p>''My doctor prescribed Vioxx for me,'' Ms. Hamill said on the show, ''and it's as if I've been given a new life. It's just -- it's been amazing.''</p>
        <p>Cox-2 inhibitors were developed in response to discoveries about a decade ago that cyclooxygenase, or COX, came in two forms, one of which appears to help protect the stomach from ulcers and another associated with pain or inflammation. Aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs work by inhibiting both forms of COX, thus raising the risk of ulcers. (Tylenol and other acetaminophen-based pain relievers don't ease inflammation, and so do not pose the same risk to the stomach.) Cox-2 inhibitors only block the form of cyclooxygenase associated with inflammation and pain, and thus in theory reduce the risk of ulcers.</p>
        <p>Studies sponsored by both companies -- there are, as yet, no independent clinical studies -- have shown that patients taking either Vioxx or Celebrex have a lower incidence of ulcers than those taking other pain relievers. Ulcers can be a painful side effect of regularly taking aspirin, ibuprofen or other anti-inflammatory pain relievers. In rare cases, the ulcers can become serious, resulting in hospitalization and even death.</p>
        <p>The F.D.A. estimates that 2 to 4 percent of all people who take pain relievers known as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for a year experience serious ulcer complications. About 13 million Americans regularly take anti-inflammatory pain relievers for arthritis, according to research gathered by Pharmacia, and about 10 percent discontinue the medication because of side effects.</p>
        <p>The F.D.A., however, still requires Merck and Pharmacia to include warning labels stating that Celebrex and Vioxx could cause serious ulcers. The warnings state how often other anti-inflammatory drugs have caused severe ulcers and say it is not yet known how Cox-2 inhibitors might change those numbers.</p>
        <p>The Cox-2's can still have some other side effects, including abdominal pain and nausea.</p>
        <p>And, some doctors say the benefits of the new drugs may have been overstated. Dr. Walter L. Peterson and Dr. Byron Cryer, who have worked as consultants to the companies, said that while the drugs did  appear to reduce the incidence of ulcers in some patients, it was not cost effective to prescribe the drugs to all people with arthritis. They also argued that the use of Cox 2's should instead be limited to people who have a greater chance than others of developing a serious ulcer. ''It is unclear whether all the hype is warranted,'' the two doctors wrote in an editorial late last year in the Journal of the American Medical Association.</p>
        <p>But many doctors say they are widely prescribing the drugs because they believe they are safer than traditional therapies.</p>
        <p>''I use them in pretty much all adults,'' said Dr. Joanne M. Jordan, a rheumatologist at the Thurston Arthritis Research Center at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Dr. Jordan said she had been paid by both Merck and Pharmacia to speak to other doctors about the benefits of the drugs.</p>
        <p>Executives at both Merck and Pharmacia dispute the claims of some doctors and health insurance companies that the drugs should be limited to only certain patients. The executives say that the drugs are worth their cost because of their safety.</p>
        <p>They have asked the F.D.A. to soften the label warnings on ulcers and have submitted studies to the agency showing that the incidence of serious ulcer complications was lower for people taking the new Cox-2's than for those taking other anti-inflammatory drugs.</p>
        <p>''Some people have serious adverse effects very early on'' when taking other pain relievers, said Dr. Roger M. Perlmutter, Merck's executive vice president for worldwide basic research. ''On balance, you would prefer to take a drug that had fewer risks because it can happen to anyone.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Steve Geis, Pharmacia's vice president for arthritis clinical research, echoed that view: ''Even with short-term therapy, people can have serious ulcers and bleeding. You can be healthy and get a complication.''</p>
