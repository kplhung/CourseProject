        <p>The Ministry of Finance plans to release a ''national balance sheet'' intended to clearly show how the country's assets compare with its rising debts, which are partly a result of government spending to stimulate the economy. Publication of the balance sheet, scheduled for next week, is part of a government effort to be more open about the nation's finances and raise awareness of its long-term fiscal problem, which already has made Japan the world's largest debtor nation. The Nihon Keizai Shimbun, the leading economic newspaper in Japan, published what it called a draft of the balance sheet, which showed that Japan's liabilities, including pension obligations for the nation's aging population, are more than double its total assets of 660 trillion yen, or about $6.1 trillion.</p>
