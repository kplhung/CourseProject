        <p>In a case of the big getting help from the bigger, Vodafone AirTouch said today that it would invest $2.5 billion and strike an alliance with China's largest wireless phone company, China Mobile Hong Kong Ltd.</p>
        <p>China Mobile will use the money to help finance the purchase of cellular properties from its mainland Chinese parent. That deal, worth $32.84 billion, would give China Mobile 15.4 million new subscribers in Beijing, Shanghai and five coastal provinces.</p>
        <p>China Mobile Hong Kong, which is publicly traded here, said the seven franchises would vault it from No. 4 to No. 2 among all cellular companies, with just under 40 million customers. Vodafone, with 66 million subscribers, would remain the world's largest wireless provider.</p>
        <p>''The seven target assets are some of the most attractive mobile assets in mainland China,'' said Wang Xiaochu, the chairman of China Mobile. ''These acquisitions would elevate our status as a leader in the global wireless industry.''</p>
        <p>The alliance gives Vodafone a potentially valuable entrance to China's market. Although it will own less than 2 percent of the company, Vodafone prevailed over Deutsche Telekom and NTT DoCoMo in the deal with China Mobile, which is controlled by the Chinese government.</p>
        <p>''There is no need to tell you about the potential of the China market,'' said Chris Gent, the chief executive of Vodafone, based in London. ''We could not have hoped to find a better partner in China.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gent said he hoped Vodafone would be able to bolster its equity stake to 15 to 20 percent over several years.</p>
        <p>Under its agreement to enter the World Trade Organization, China must allow foreign companies to own up to 49 percent of telecommunications providers. But Beijing does not have to relax current restrictions for four years and shows no signs of doing so before that deadline.</p>
        <p>Vodafone will not get a seat on the board of China Mobile, nor will it receive a stake in any specific mobile assets. For now, the alliance involves mostly the swapping of research and technical expertise.</p>
        <p>''It's more symbolic than anything else,'' said John Tysoe, an analyst at West LB Panmure in London. ''But this could be the prelude to something more substantial.''</p>
        <p>Duncan Clark, a partner in BDA China Ltd., a telecommunications consulting firm in Beijing, said: ''China wants a seat at the high table in the mobile industry. But they're trying to get it on their own terms.''</p>
        <p>What gives China Mobile such leverage is the size and growth of the Chinese market. By year-end China will have 65.2 million cellular subscribers, according to Intrinsic Technology, a consulting firm in Shanghai. It projects that China will become the largest wireless market in two years, and will have 254.1 million subscribers by 2005.</p>
        <p>China Mobile's only significant rival, China Unicom, had 4.2 million subscribers when it issued shares last June. Just before the offering, Vodafone signed a collaboration agreement with Unicom, which now seems moribund.</p>
