        <p>The Jets may not know which half of Pittburgh's two-headed quarterback they will face until game time on Sunday. But does it matter?</p>
        <p>Kent Graham, the former Giant, and Kordell Stewart, the former Slash, present strikingly different styles. Graham is a classic stay-in-the-pocket quarterback, one who remains convinced that he can be a viable starting quarterback.</p>
        <p>Despite an 0-3 record in games he started this season, despite an embarrassing error in which he took an inexplicable sack in the waning seconds of a loss to Cleveland that prevented the Steelers from getting off a potentially game-tying field goal, Graham will start Sunday if Coach Bill Cowher believes he has recovered from a hip injury that kept him out of last Sunday's game. Graham, who has completed 48 of 98 passes for 625 yards in three games, will practice this week, but Cowher may not know until Sunday if he is able to play against the Jets.</p>
        <p>Stewart, the former quarterback/ receiver/running back sensation, has been called ineffective as a quarterback by his own team's news media guide. Yet the Steelers are 13-15 since 1997 with Stewart as their starter and 1-7 without him. He began the season on the bench, but he was the starter last Sunday for the Steelers' only victory of the season, a 24-13 domination of Jacksonville. Pittsburgh was propelled by 209 yards rushing, 61 of them by Stewart. Stewart has also completed 12 of 22 passes for 147 yards this season.</p>
        <p>''You have to prepare for both guys,'' the Jets' nose tackle, Ernie Logan, said today. ''With Graham, he's not much of a scrambler. Kordell runs as good as some of the running backs in this league. You have more of a double threat when Kordell comes in. Any time you have a quarterback who can scramble, it keeps the defense on their toes.''</p>
        <p>Stewart provided a spark to the offense last week, and Graham seemed to be growing increasingly comfortable with the offense before his injury; he threw for 254 yards two weeks ago against Tennessee. But the Steelers are still awaiting their first passing touchdown of the season, although National Football League officials said they were in error when they did not rule a touchdown on a ball caught by wide receiver Hines Ward against Tennessee.</p>
        <p>Even if Graham is healthy, Stewart is very likely to come in on short-yardage situations. Still, Cowher has repeatedly given his vote of confidence to Graham as the starter.</p>
        <p>''I try to be very up front with each of them,'' Cowher said. ''Kordell is the guy who came in and came out with a big win and I'm very happy for him from the standpoint of the scrutiny he's been under. But you can't discount what Kent has done with this offense. No question we got better each week. I think it's a very good situation we have.''</p>
        <p>No wonder the Steelers gave such strong consideration last spring to drafting Chad Pennington, who now carries a clipboard as the Jets' rookie quarterback. Graham, who lost the Giants' starting job to Kerry Collins last season, had just signed as a free agent in March. But the Steelers were so uncertain about their situation on draft day that they tried to engineer a trade with the Jets to grab Pennington with the 18th overall pick. No deal, the Jets said. Cowher said today it would do no good to review that situation.</p>
        <p>By all accounts, the relationship between Graham and Stewart is mutually supportive. They entered the season knowing that their situation would be heavily scrutinized and stressful. And because of Cowher's support, Graham says he feels more secure in his job than he has ever felt in his career.</p>
        <p>''It puts you at ease,'' Graham said. ''It does make me feel probably the most comfortable I have in my career as far as job security.''</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>The Jets finally acknowledged the ankle injury that nose tackle JASON FERGUSON sustained in the second quarter against Tampa Bay, listing him as doubtful for Sunday. Still unannounced: the groin injury that kept receiver VINCENT BRISBY from playing against Tampa Bay. . . . VINNY TESTAVERDE, who was unusually outspoken about not wanting to get all the blame for the offense's woes, seems to have reconsidered. ''I take full responsibility, because I'm the leader of the offense,'' Testaverde said.</p>
