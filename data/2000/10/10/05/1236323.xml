        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In the first presidential debate there were two clearly different and unfair standards for success (''Bush and Gore Stake Out Differences in First Debate,'' front page, Oct. 4). Al  Gore had to be articulate without being too confrontational and ''policy wonkish.'' George W. Bush had to show up and speak articulately.</p>
        <p>Al Gore put on a bravura performance on Tuesday night by providing specific, easily understood descriptions of his proposals and pointed contrasts to Mr. Bush's plans. He was superlative on taxes, deficit reduction, Social Security, reproductive rights and Medicare and provided contrast without resorting to personal attacks.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush did show up, and he spoke articulately. But he paled in comparison to Mr. Gore. He never responded to Mr. Gore's point that his tax cut would go to the wealthiest 1 percent of the population. He was also weak on foreign policy, military leadership, handling a financial crisis, and on abortion.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore exceeded expectations by being specific without sullying the debate. Mr. Bush met his minimal standard for success, but do we really want a president who is held to such low standards of competence?</p>
