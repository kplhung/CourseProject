        <p>Dawn had yet to peek through the pitch-black curtain of a New Mexico morning when Nancy Laflin, a reporter for KOAT's Action 7 News, hit the streets to find out what waking thoughts the city had about the presidential debate.</p>
        <p>Bleary-eyed, craving coffee -- ''Do you have a skycap for the bags?'' she said off camera, pointing to the circles under her eyes -- Ms. Laflin overcame her weariness and sampled opinions in the Frontier Restaurant, where many of the early-morning diners seemed less than overwhelmed by the candidates' performances on Tuesday night.</p>
        <p>David Grady, the owner of an Internet startup business said, ''There was no new data, no new ideas.''</p>
        <p>Charlie Steele, an Albuquerque businessman, concurred: ''It was a stump speech broken into many different parts.''</p>
        <p>And Dee Trester, a retired library science professor and a member of the League of Women Voters, pronounced the evening so disappointing that she vowed to boycott the remaining debates.</p>
        <p>The person-on-the-street report may have been a newsroom staple, but the currents Ms. Laflin picked up seemed to reflect the sentiments of many who watched the debate in Albuquerque, by far the largest city in New Mexico, a state that despite its relatively small population has become one of the most vigorously contested in the campaign.</p>
        <p>Ms. Laflin's reporting was a contrast to the buildup the debate received in the local and national news media, which promoted the showdown between Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore as a kind of political gunfight at the O.K. Corral. ''The debate could be a turning point, and I think both of them know it,'' Bob Schieffer told Dan Rather on the CBS Evening News. The local media picked up the theme, reinforcing the idea that the debate was more than a discussion of issues.</p>
        <p>''Make or Break?'' asked The Albuquerque Journal, New Mexico's largest and most influential newspaper, on its front page on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>''Battle for the Undecided,'' was the headline in The Albuquerque Tribune, the city's afternoon daily.</p>
        <p>But people here did not immediately see the actual event as a brawling winner-take-all. ''It may not have clinched it for either of them,'' said Larry Ahrens, who hosts a morning drive-time talk show on KOB AM.</p>
        <p>In an interview after his 5:30-to-10 a.m. program ended, Mr. Ahrens said that few of his callers today reported any change of heart as a result of the debate.</p>
        <p>''I think we heard from a lot of people who already had their minds made up,'' Mr. Ahrens said. ''They wanted to reinforce what they saw, they found the best of what their guy did last night, and they validated it.''</p>
        <p>On the national stage, what the people of New Mexico took away from the debate appeared to count for a lot, and certainly, a lot more than news people and their readers and viewers here are accustomed to. The Bush and Gore campaigns have devoted large amounts of time and money to the state; recent newspaper polls here show the race to be a dead heat. Adam Vance, a KOAT cameraman, counted seven visits to the state by Mr. Gore, Mr. Bush and their running mates since June.</p>
        <p>And the commercials in the race are virtually nonstop on Albuquerque stations: the candidates and their surrogates ran 500 spots costing $131,000 in the last week of September alone, said Ken Goldstein, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin who monitors spending on campaign advertising. That represented a huge commitment in a state of 1.7 million people and just five electoral votes.</p>
        <p>''We've never had anything like this, and I grew up here,'' said Ms. Laflin, who, unlike some of the reporters assigned full time to cover the nominees, has snared one-on-one interviews over the last month with Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>With more than 1,000 balloonists arriving for the start this weekend of Balloon Fiesta 2000, the yearly installment of New Mexico's hot-air balloon festival, there was formidable competition on the airwaves this week. Still, the debate was the first or second item on many of the newscasts before the event, and, for the most part, both the run-up and the outcome were reported in fairly direct and unembellished ways.</p>
        <p>The daily papers relied largely on articles that were syndicated by larger newspapers -- both the Journal and The Santa Fe New Mexican, for instance, carried a debate analysis by The Washington Post on their front pages -- and the local stations repeatedly picked up reports by correspondents for the networks. They added the requisite local angle through reports like those from Ms. Laflin, and articles like a Journal piece today that was headlined: ''N.M. Observers Saw Event As Riveting, Dull, Waste of Time.''</p>
        <p>The local contributions often consisted of polls: KOAT, the ABC affiliate and the market's dominant news station, ran an informal one on its Web site and the New Mexican published the results today of a Mason-Dixon poll it commissioned that gave Mr. Bush an edge of 44 percent to 41 percent, a difference within the survey's margin of error. And of course, the experiences of Joseph Austin, an Albuquerque construction worker who was tapped by the Gore campaign to be one its 13 ''real people'' advisers were faithfully related.</p>
        <p>The extent to which the coverage shaped voters' perceptions was probably negligible, at least based on the reactions recorded on the day after. Brian Sanderoff, president of Research and Polling, a firm here that conducts the surveys for the Journal, said voters generally tended not to find outside commentary persuasive for events like debates.</p>
        <p>''People are resistant,'' Mr. Sanderoff said. ''They have become so much more sophisticated in what will or will not influence them. It's almost comical to watch Cokie Roberts and Sam Donaldson overemphasize things. No one has those expectations of these events except the pundits.''</p>
        <p>Still, some voters here said they had been able to make judgments about the candidates based on highlights of the debate on local television. Ruben Martinez, a student at the University of New Mexico, said he had been inclined to vote for Mr. Bush until he watched reports on the debate this morning on KOAT.</p>
        <p>What caught his eye, he said, was an excerpt in which Mr. Gore declared himself to be his own man, a statement Mr. Martinez took to mean the vice president ''was positioning himself away from the Clinton scandals.'' The declaration struck him as so genuine, he said, that as a result, ''I'm up in the air.''</p>
        <p>Some local news outlets tried to explore how decisive the debate might have been. KRQE, the CBS affiliate, and The Albuquerque Tribune conducted a joint focus group Tuesday night with about a dozen undecided voters immediately after the live forum.</p>
        <p>John Robertson, the state editor of the Journal, said readers are putting a premium these days not on articles that emphasize strategy, but that analyze the candidates' positions and try to illustrate the differences.</p>
        <p>''We were already getting calls today asking us, 'What can you do to help us sort out the 'fuzzy arithmetic,' '' Mr. Robertson said, invoking a word Mr. Bush used repeatedly in the debate. But even if ''civic-style analysis'' is not the most glamorous kind of journalism, Mr. Robertson said, the Journal will try to stick to the issues until Election Day.</p>
