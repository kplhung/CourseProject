        <p>Oh, what wonders are to be beheld on the stage of the New Victory Theater.</p>
        <p>Great hoards of gold and silver, a valley of diamonds, magical birds, ghouls, a wicked sorceress, men and women turned to stone and restored to life. Here are high adventure, low comedy, tales of peril and death and lessons to live by.</p>
        <p>The source of these wonders is the Young Vic Theater Company of London and its scintillating production of ''Arabian Nights,'' intended for audiences at least 7 years old. Adapted and directed by Dominic Cooke, this imaginative display of the magic of theater weaves its spell from rich strands of fine acting, riveting storytelling, music, dance, puppetry, design, lighting and costumes.</p>
        <p>Calling the New Victory home through Oct. 22, nine splendid performers, equally comfortable in comedy and drama, are accompanied by two equally versatile musicians as they revisit ancient Samarkand and Persia in the days of kings, caliphs and viziers and of Ali Baba, the 40 thieves and Sinbad (here called Sindibad) the Sailor. It is a time of great poverty, grisly death (usually inflicted on puppets) and enormous reversals of fortune.</p>
        <p>Of course, the framing device for these enduring stories from ''Thousand and One Nights,'' also known as ''Arabian Nights,'' is the tale of the beautiful and brave young woman whose name is here spelled Shaharazad (Priyanga Elan). It is she who literally risks her neck for her despairing people after King Shahrayar (Paul Bhattacharjee), embittered by his wife's infidelity, orders the beheading of each of her successors after a single night of marriage.</p>
        <p>With the women of the kingdom in terror, Shaharazad, the daughter of the king's vizier (Nizwar Karanj), enlists the help of her sister, Dinarzad (Natasha Gordon), in a plot to volunteer as a bride and so beguile the king with her storytelling that each morning he will postpone her execution.</p>
        <p>And so, as Shaharazad spins out her accounts of Ali Baba (Richard Katz) and the 40 thieves, and the funny little beggar (Tristan Sharps) who seems to be murdered again and again, and the Sindibads rich (Mr. Sharps) and poor (Paul Chahidi), and the unfortunately flatulent Abu Hassan (Mr. Karanj), and the wife (Martina Laird) who wouldn't eat, and the envious sisters (Ms. Laird and Yasmin Wilde), the tale comes full circle. Once again Shaharazad stands imperiled, and the king must choose between life and death.</p>
        <p>Much wisdom is to be found in ''Arabian Nights'' and much extraordinary entertainment.</p>
