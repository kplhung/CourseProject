        <p>The slowdown in the personal computer industry has hit one of its most successful companies, Dell Computer, which told analysts yesterday that its third-quarter sales would fall short of expectations.</p>
        <p>Dell attributed the problems to weak demand in Europe and from small-business customers in the United States. As a result, its sales will be about $8.2 billion, or 3 percent below estimates.</p>
        <p>Andrew Neff, an analyst for Bear, Stearns, said that Dell's announcement, following similar shortfalls from Apple Computer and Intel, indicated the potential of a widespread slackening of demand for computers.</p>
        <p>''At a macro level, there is the decline in the euro and higher oil prices,'' he said. ''At the micro level, there are the delays in the Pentium 4 chip and the higher interest rates in the United States. Taken together the demand picture is getting murky and the earnings of a number of companies are at risk.'' Last week, Mr. Neff downgraded shares of Apple, Dell, Compaq Computer and Hewlett-Packard.</p>
        <p>Dell said after the markets closed that it expected to meet third-quarter profit forecasts, but could fall 1 or 2 cents below expectations for the fourth quarter.</p>
        <p>Analysts had expected Dell to earn 25 cents a share in the third quarter and 27 cents in the fourth.</p>
        <p>If the weakness persists in the fourth quarter, the company estimated its revenue for the full year would be $32 billion, up 27 percent from 1999. Still, Dell's growth is slowing sharply. Last year, its sales rose 38 percent, and in 1998, they grew 48 percent.</p>
        <p>Michael S. Dell, the company's chief executive, said he expected the company to continue to outpace its competitors. ''The question is not whether Dell will continue to grow, it's at what multiple will we continue to grow relative to the market, and how do we manage that growth,'' Mr. Dell said, according to a transcription by The Associated Press.</p>
        <p>He spoke at the beginning of a two-day analyst meeting at Dell's headquarters in Round Rock, Tex.</p>
        <p>The company said that profit margins remained firm, even in the face of price cuts, because shortages in important computer components had abated and prices had fallen. And it said that sales to large corporate customers, its most important segment, along with sales to home users remained strong.</p>
        <p>''Dell is the most profitable company in the industry,'' Mr. Neff said. ''But that's having the best house in the worst neighborhood.'' He said that the company would need to focus on cutting costs even more.</p>
        <p>Shares of Dell, which declined 38 cents, to $28.19 in the regular trading, fell as low as $25.75 in after-hours trading. Dell's shares had already been trading at their lowest point in two years.</p>
        <p>Two weeks ago, Intel said that its sales would grow 3 percent to 5 percent instead of the 9 percent to 12 percent it had expected. The company mainly blamed the fall of the euro, which has effectively raised prices of computers in Europe by 18 percent so far this year.</p>
        <p>On Friday, shares of Apple plunged by more than half after it said that sales were slow in September, a month usually buoyed by back-to-school shopping.</p>
        <p>Also yesterday, Micron Electronics said that its personal computer business grew only 5 percent in the quarter, below analysts' expectations. Over all, the company beat expectations because of the strength of its memory business.</p>
