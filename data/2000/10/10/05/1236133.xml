        <p>For his operas, Benjamin Britten was drawn toward stories in which malevolence lurks beneath mundanely straightforward social surfaces, with those dark forces invariably breaking through to wreak havoc in the lives of innocents. Recent biographies have explored the degree to which Britten's works reflect issues that he grappled with personally, most notably his relationships with the young boys who performed in them. But it is one of Britten's strengths as an opera composer that he was able to address these matters, again and again, in works that are as musically and dramatically compelling as they are disturbing.</p>
        <p>In ''The Turn of the Screw,'' Britten's 1954 adaptation of the Henry James story, with a libretto by Myfanwy Piper, the pervasive evil takes the form of two ghosts, Quint and Miss Jessel, but it is tempered by ambiguity and doubt. As presented, the story is the memoir of an unnamed Governess, hired to look after two children, Flora and Miles. Although several of her discussions with the housekeeper, Mrs. Grose, suggest that the ghosts are real, the dream-sequence quality of the piece invites us to wonder if they are figments of the Governess's imagination and if the story is a chronicle of her own descent into madness.</p>
        <p>On that question hang several others. Is Miles killed by a final encounter with Quint, as the stage action suggests, or has the Governess either killed him or terrified him to death herself? And if Quint and Miss Jessel are real, what is the nature of their hold on the children?</p>

        <p>The New York City Opera's production of ''The Turn of the Screw,'' which returned to the New York State Theater on Tuesday evening, was startling when it was first seen in the house, in 1996, having been staged first at the Glimmerglass Opera four years earlier. Directed by Mark Lamos, with sets and costumes by John Conklin, it plays on the work's nightmarish aspects by keeping the characters in 19th-century costumes but transforming the house into a world of textured slabs and tilted windows.</p>
        <p>Robert M. Wierzel's lighting bathes the stage in bright yellows, reds, greens and harsh white. Shadows thrown on backdrops and scrims evoke a sinister atmosphere, and the scrims keep the stage picture hazy.</p>
        <p>The company has assembled a strong cast. Amy Burton, a soprano who has long been an able contemporary-music performer, sang the music with assurance and an attractively nuanced tone. Her portrayal is quite different from the one Lauren Flanigan gave when the company first presented the production: Ms. Flanigan's Governess was clearly and progressively unhinged. Ms. Burton's is more rational, or at least more determined to maintain her foothold in the rational world, despite her almost immediate encounter with Quint's ghost.</p>
        <p>Jeffrey Lentz was a superb Quint. He moved through his scenes with a nonchalance that seemed commanding, and he sang both Quint's music and that of the Prologue with power and clarity. Both Mr. Lentz and Maire O'Brien, whose Miss Jessel was also vivid and well sung, give their characters a sympathetic underpinning, something Britten may have hoped for: however destructive their spectral presences are, Quint and Miss Jessel are also deeply pained by relationships left unresolved at their deaths.</p>
        <p>Eugenie Grunewald brought a necessary firmness to Miss Grose's music. In the children's roles Sandra Joseph, as Flora, had an easier time staying in tune than Jacob Ashworth, whose Miles nevertheless had its appealing qualities. Stewart Robertson conducted a suitably eerie account of Britten's rich chamber score, with especially fine contributions on the piano and celeste by Lynn Baker.</p>
