        <p>Palestinians and some Israeli liberals have said that it was the well-publicized and intensely guarded visit to the area of the Al Aksa Mosque on the Temple Mount by the rightist leader, Ariel Sharon, that has touched off nearly a week of deadly fighting.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Sharon himself has been determinedly unapologetic and dismissed the notion that he could be held to blame, saying he was asserting his right and the right of every Jew to visit Jerusalem's holy places.</p>
        <p>Indeed, Mr. Sharon, a former general and seasoned political veteran,  has laid the entire blame for the rioting on the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat. After six days of violence, the focus of the debate in Israel has shifted to whether the massive Arab protests are a spontaneous, street-level explosion, or one orchestrated  by Mr. Arafat.</p>
        <p>It was a debate delayed in any case by two days over the Rosh Hoshana holiday last weekend, when no newspapers appear and the usually hectic public discussions in Israel abate almost entirely. By the time the public debate resumed on Monday, the violence had acquired a momentum of its own.</p>
        <p>''There is nothing since the destruction of the Second Temple that I haven't been held responsible for,'' he said in an interview today. ''I bear no responsibility for this. It was initiated by Yasir Arafat, and it was timed and orchestrated by Yasir Arafat.''</p>
        <p>Initially thrown on the defensive when the rioting began, especially abroad, Mr. Sharon has bounced back, buoyed by repeated public assessments by Israeli generals that the Palestinian violence has been organized from the top.</p>
        <p>At home, at least, Mr. Sharon's role at the outset of the unrest has been obscured by the popular preoccupation with the intensity of the Palestinian resistance and by its spillover into Israeli Arab villages and towns. The focus has also shifted to the government's handling of the crisis.</p>
        <p>Now it is Public Security Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami who has been put on the defensive, sharply criticized by Israeli Arab leaders after the police used gunfire to quell riots in Arab towns in Israel itself, killing nine Arabs. Mr. Ben-Ami tried to explain that policy today, as well as the decision to allow Mr. Sharon to visit the vast sacred plaza the Muslims call Haram al Sharif and the Jews call the Temple Mount.</p>
        <p>''When you're in negotiations, when you are defending Jerusalem as our capital, when the Temple Mount and Jerusalem are under Israeli sovereignty, you cannot be in a situation where you permit a parliament member from the left, from the right, a religious Arab, a secular  Arab, a religious Jew, a secular Jew, everybody, to go, but Ariel Sharon can't,'' Mr. Ben-Ami said in a radio interview.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ben-Ami added that the police had not anticipated major disturbances after the visit, and that he had received assurances from the Palestinian security chief in the West Bank, Jibril Rajoub, that as long as Mr. Sharon did not enter Muslim shrines, there was no cause for concern.</p>
        <p>For his part, Mr. Sharon said, ''Jerusalem is under Israeli sovereignty, and I don't need anyone's permission'' to visit the Temple Mount. He  added, ''It's my absolute right to be there. I'm not hurting anyone and I had no intention of visiting the mosques.''</p>
        <p>But to the Palestinians, Mr. Sharon is not just any Jew, and he remains a hated figure, the architect of the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982 when Christian militiamen allied with Israel massacred hundreds of Palestinians in Beirut refugee camps. ''Sharon defiled Al Aksa and provoked the feelings of the entire Muslim world,'' said Tawfik Mahameed, a resident of the Israeli Arab town of Umm al Fahm, where there were violent protests this week.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sharon dismissed the Palestinian reaction as blind hatred, and argued that the violence was intended to extract more concessions from Israel at the negotiating table. ''Arafat was looking for a pretext for a confrontation that could be called the last battle before an agreement,'' he said.</p>
        <p>With all the violence it engendered, Mr. Sharon's visit had the undeniable effect of deflecting attention from Benjamin Netanyahu, the former Likud leader who could challenge Mr. Sharon for the party leadership. Last week, the Israeli attorney general found that there was insufficient evidence to try Mr. Netanyahu for corruption, and he is widely expected to attempt a political comeback.</p>
        <p>Some political commentators in Israel have suggested that may have been Mr. Sharon's motivation from the start.</p>
