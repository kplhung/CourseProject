        <p>NO time like the present to drag Consumers Union's boss, Rhoda H. Karpatkin, out of her anechoic chamber, a soundproof vault where stereo speakers blast themselves silly seeking a best-buy rating from Consumer Reports, and talk politics.</p>
        <p>What with her not-quite-doppelganger, Ralph Nader, running for president, and with Ms. Karpatkin retiring as president of Consumers Union after 26 years as its top teeth-baring watchdog, why not team up on a ''Consumers Rule!'' ticket? Nobody gets price-gouged ever again, and anyone who knowingly sells a lemon goes to jail!</p>
        <p>''And I forgot to call Ralph back last week,'' she mock-wails, ensconced (for a few more months) in her corner office-fit-for-a-queen at the $40 million headquarters in affordable Yonkers. ''Maybe he was offering the vice presidency,'' she says, brows arched in disbelief.</p>
        <p>But enough with the levity. That's as far as Ms. Karpatkin, no-nonsense at 70 yet willing to work up a sizable smirk over Mr. Nader's antics, buys into our campaign fantasy. She's a reality-based gal, a Depression-era child who says she's ''too stiff-necked'' for politics (sorry, Ralph), her way of implying that politicians  will compromise principles when the pressure's on or the price is right.</p>
        <p>Ms. Karpatkin can't help hanging a ''Not Acceptable'' rating on such behavior. She believes that being ''above reproach'' is not just Consumers Union hype but the reason that, unlike politicians, it has held people's trust across the decades.</p>
        <p>As a schoolgirl journalist in Brooklyn (she dropped journalism for law  ''to do important things, not report on them''), Consumers Union struck her ''as one of the quintessential do-good organizations.''</p>
        <p>''You just got the feeling they couldn't be bought, couldn't be seduced.''</p>
        <p>Still can't. ''It's a very scary role to be in,'' says Ms. Karpatkin, who worked her way through Yale Law School despite the initial objections of her immigrant parents and went into private practice in 1954.</p>
        <p>Besides her disinclination to compromise, evidenced by the swollen finger she got yesterday on the basketball court in a ''hot game of one-on-one'' against her teenage grandson, it seems that she and Mr. Nader don't boast a hand-in-glove rapport. He quit Consumers Union's board once she came aboard and made it clear that product testing would not play second fiddle to product and policy advocacy. Goodbye Ralph, hello 50 testing labs.</p>
        <p>''Ralph's disappointment in me started right at the beginning,'' she says without disappointment.</p>
        <p>But no one at Consumers Union, the 64-year-old product tester, consumer adviser and publisher that during her tenure has raised its magazine subscriptions to 4.3 million and created the Web's largest paid-subscriber site with 350,000 users, is likely to complain about her. When a nonprofit entity produces annual revenues of $140 million, none of it from advertising, and stages tests so unbiased that only 13 makers of panned products have sued in 40 years (Consumers Union has never lost or settled), what's to gripe about?</p>
        <p>HERE'S how she finagled financing for the new headquarters she deemed necessary in 1991, when Consumers Union  was in the red: she asked subscribers for donations, and 600,000 loyalists gave $15 million. ''The thought that this was even possible was the height of chutzpah,'' she says.</p>
        <p>Not that Ms. Karpatkin, for 16 years Consumer Union's legal counsel before becoming its president in 1974 (a coup tempered by the abrupt death of her husband and law partner, Marvin, a few months later),  loses sleep over her detractors. When biggies like Bose (it argued over a stereo speaker rating), Isuzu (Trooper sport utility vehicle), Suzuki (Samurai S.U.V.) and Korbel (champagne) threatened to take her to court, off she marched. And prevailed (Suzuki has appealed).</p>
        <p>She practices what she preaches, avoids pivotal purchases without consulting Consumers Report (this includes her new videocassette recorder and her long-suffering Brooks Brothers trench coat). If she buys on impulse, like the carved wooden spatula from South Africa and the filigreed 1920's toaster from a shop in Manhattan, there's a subtext.</p>
        <p>The spatula is proof she's no slave to the notion that modern is better, the toaster an ode to anyone who's ever implied she could have -- make that should have -- taken her law degree (Yale '53) and liberal ideals (the F.B.I. kept a file on her in the 50's) and fought for civil rights instead of consumer rights. ''Calling us toaster-testers was a way of putting us down,'' she says.</p>
        <p>Calling her subscribers the best-informed and best-protected consumers in the world is her comeback to the putdown. Her enemies? She has two, the advertising industry and the World Trade Organization. She agrees with Mr. Nader that the organization has the potential to endanger consumer safeguards. ''A totally undemocratic organization that operates in secret. We can't have it!''</p>
        <p>Advertising is becoming ''more manipulative all the time,'' she says.</p>
        <p>If she's not too busy playing with her seven grandchildren after she retires, Ms. Karpatkin, free to be biased, may dust off her protest clothes, last used when she, her husband and their three children demonstrated against the Vietnam War.</p>
        <p>That personal quality she terms ''the height of chutzpah''? She's still got plenty in the tank.</p>
