        <p>Spinach by Another Name</p>
        <p>Q. This year I tried growing strawberry spinach. It was labeled Blitum foliosum. The seeds sprouted quickly in the compost I use, and the seedlings didn't appeal to the legions of slugs reveling in my mulch. But not one plant ever got larger than an inch and a half. Will they survive the winter cold and grow next summer? Would it be a good idea to let a few winter over with my houseplants? Is compost too ''sour'' for this species? Can you provide any other tips?</p>

        <p>Spinach by Another Name</p>
        <p>Q. This year I tried growing strawberry spinach. It was labeled Blitum foliosum. The seeds sprouted quickly in the compost I use, and the seedlings didn't appeal to the legions of slugs reveling in my mulch. But not one plant ever got larger than an inch and a half. Will they survive the winter cold and grow next summer? Would it be a good idea to let a few winter over with my houseplants? Is compost too ''sour'' for this species? Can you provide any other tips?</p>
        <p>A. Strawberry spinach, also known as strawberry blite (''blite'' is the Middle English word for wild spinach), has had a number of different Latin names through the years. Those that start with Blitum are distinctly old-fashioned, however; the plant has been classified as Chenopodium (C. capitatum) for about a century.</p>
        <p>Whatever you call it, strawberry blite should be 18 to 24 inches tall at maturity, and it's difficult to know what befell yours. Though the plants may have been stunted by intense heat or excessive shade, strawberry blite is a weed at heart, and keeping it from taking over is more likely to be an issue than getting it to grow.</p>
        <p>C. capitatum is closely related to Good King Henry (C. Bonus-Henricus) and to lambs' quarters (C. album), one of the most common weeds of cultivated ground. All do best in the mild weather of late spring and early summer, and will grow lush if the soil is rich.</p>
        <p>As long as you harvest them when they are young, tender and mild, all three are delicious as cooked greens, but only strawberry blite, a k a beet-berry, also produces the small bright red fruits that give it its common names. While they are edible, that's about all that can be said for them; the kindest noncommercial descriptions feature adjectives like bland and insipid.</p>
        <p>Strawberry blite is an annual. It will not winter over, indoors or out, so don't bother trying to save any of this year's reluctant crop.</p>
        <p>Next year, sow it where it is to grow, and if you plant it in compost, let the compost be a thin layer on top of good garden soil. (If this year's compost did cause problems, it was not because it was sour but simply because compost, by itself, is not a good long-term home for plants. Weeds do grow in it, as anyone with a neglected compost pile will testify, but even weeds are happier with their feet in the soil.)</p>
        <p>Sources include Bountiful Gardens (18001 Shafer Ranch Road, Willits, Calif. 95490; 707-459-6410) and Nichols Garden Nursery (1190 Old Salem Road NE, Albany, Ore. 97321; 541-928-9280). Both offer free catalogs.</p>
        <p>A Hesitant Hibiscus</p>
        <p>Q. My hibiscus, although tall and lush with foliage in mid-September, produced no buds at all this summer and was still flowerless when last seen in early September. Last summer it bloomed profusely. What's the problem?</p>
        <p>A. This summer was rainy and cool in much of the Northeast, good for vegetative growth but discouraging for heat and light lovers like fruits and warm-weather flowers. If your tomatoes also delivered a questionable performance, chalk up the balky hibiscus to a bad year.</p>
        <p>If, on the other hand, you did have plenty of warmth and sun, your healthy but monochromatic plant is probably the product of too much high-nitrogen fertilizer. Did you perhaps reward it for last year's splendors by feeding it overlavishly?</p>
        <p>A tropical hibiscus (H. rosa-sinensis) that was growing in a pot might need multiple doses of bloom-boosting high-phosphorus fertilizer. But a hardy type (H. moscheutos), exemplified by varieties like Disco Belle and Blue River, is a different story. Because it is growing in the ground, it has other resources.</p>
        <p>Hardy hibiscus should be quite happy with one meal of compost and well-rotted manure and, if your soil is poor, a bit of bone meal, applied when growth starts in late spring.</p>
        <p>It is also distantly possible that your plant bloomed early last year (unusually sunny and hot, remember?) and missed its chance this time. Though tropical hibiscus flower all summer, even in the north, where winters are cold, the hardy types don't start the show until quite late in the season.</p>
