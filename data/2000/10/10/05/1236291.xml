        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''Capturing Every Moment of That Saturday Soccer Match'' (Sept. 21) concludes by essentially saying that creating movies with iMovie software is a nice thing to do but may take too much time.</p>
        <p>I would ask the writer if he ever becomes a chef at home and takes four or five hours of time to prepare a delicious meal and then present it in a beautiful fashion to his loved ones or friends. Millions of people do. And similarly, I'm positive millions of home editors will take the time to prepare a visual feast for those they care about.</p>
        <p>As someone immersed in making iMovies of his economics lectures at Baruch College of the City University of New York, as well as someone who is a home chef (so far a better chef than editor), I see these two activities as remarkably similar.</p>
        <p>Both require planning, coordination, technical expertise, patience, time and an eye for detail.</p>
        <p>The only difference is that I usually don't have to come up with a catchy title for a meal. That's not true for my current iMovie. I can't decide between ''Napster -- Blackbeard or Robin Hood?'' ''Napster Is Adam Smith's Invisible Hand'' or ''Napster: It's Not a Problem; It's a Blessing.''</p>
