        <p>Eight AIDS advocates were arrested inside the campaign headquarters of the Senate candidates Hillary Rodham Clinton and Rick A. Lazio yesterday after they staged simultaneous protests at the sites, criticizing the two candidates for their lack of attention to AIDS-related issues, the police said.</p>
        <p>Four protesters from the AIDS group Housing Works marched into Mrs. Clinton's Seventh Avenue office, while another four marched into Mr. Lazio's Park Avenue office around 11 a.m. and handcuffed themselves to filing cabinets, desks and chairs. Dozens more protested outside, chanting and handing out fliers.</p>
        <p>The protest was relatively quiet and was over in about 30 minutes, according to representatives from both offices. As soon as the protesters marched unannounced into the two headquarters, workers at both campaigns called the police. The protesters were charged with criminal trespassing and resisting arrest.</p>
        <p>''Neither one of them have put out an effective AIDS policy for the state of New York,'' said Terri Smith-Caronia, a spokeswoman for Housing Works, a nonprofit group that provides housing for people with AIDS.</p>
        <p>Representatives from both campaigns defended their respective candidates' records and positions regarding AIDS policy.</p>
