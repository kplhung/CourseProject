        <p>With a .200 career batting average in the playoffs, Barry Bonds was particularly sensitive about his past. He was testy toward the Mets, too, opening the National League division series today with two key hits and sparking the San Francisco Giants to a 5-1 victory.</p>

        <p>With a .200 career batting average in the playoffs, Barry Bonds was particularly sensitive about his past. He was testy toward the Mets, too, opening the National League division series today with two key hits and sparking the San Francisco Giants to a 5-1 victory.</p>
        <p>''If you go negative on me, I'm going to have to end the interview,'' Bonds said after repeated questions about his 16 hits in 80 career postseason at-bats.</p>
        <p>Only positive energy flowed from the Giants' clubhouse after another dominating performance over the Mets, who lost their fifth straight game at Pacific Bell Park for several reasons other than Bonds.</p>
        <p>Ellis Burks provided the game-breaker, standing still with hope and wishing a three-run home run fair after bashing a 1-1 pitch from Mike Hampton that hit the left-field foul pole.</p>
        <p>''He threw it down and in, and I was looking for something out over the plate,'' Burks said. ''I just reacted with my hands and hit it fairly well. I knew I had the distance. It was just a matter of keeping it fair or foul.''</p>
        <p>Livan Hernandez's mastery of the Mets' lineup made it easy for the Giants. Staked to a 5-1 lead through three innings, Hernandez continued into the seventh inning and allowed five hits while striking out five and walking five batters.</p>
        <p>''The guy has no fear,'' Bonds said of Hernandez. 'He goes out there, stays within himself and makes the pitches when he needs to. He's become more of a finesse pitcher at this point in his career.''</p>
        <p>Bonds had a single and a triple, drove in a run and scored a run, adding to his strong statistics in recent postseasons. In his last seven playoff games, he has hit .370 (10 for 27) with a home run, three doubles, a triple and five runs batted in.</p>
        <p>''We don't have any questions about Barry,'' Jeff Kent said. ''Too many people make too big a deal about what he's done in the postseason. We need him just like we need the 25th player on the team. Barry's not running the show. As good as he is, you can't go into a war with just one guy. He's one of 25 leaders on this team.''</p>
        <p>Instead, the Giants stressed winning both games here before heading to Shea Stadium, where they lost three of four games in August. Game 2 of the three-of-five-game series is Thursday night.</p>
        <p>Mets catcher Mike Piazza, though, observed of Bonds: ''He had situations he took advantage of. No matter how frustrated he's been at the postseason, if you give him too many opportunities to make things happen, eventually he's going to come through.''</p>
        <p>Bonds delivered twice in the early innings. His single in the first inning sent Bill Mueller to third base. Mueller then scored on Kent's groundout, giving the Giants a 1-0 lead.</p>
        <p>In the third inning, Bonds drilled a 3-2 pitch from Hampton down the right-field line for a triple that was helped when Derek Bell sprained an ankle chasing the ball. The hit scored Mueller and kept the Giants' two-out rally alive for Kent and Burks.</p>
        <p>''I didn't see him come up real lame,'' Bonds said of Bell, ''I just thought I could make it to third the whole time.''</p>
        <p>With the count at 2-2, Hampton thought he had struck out Bonds with a fastball and seemed frustrated with the home plate umpire, Jeff Kellogg. ''I don't remember if it was close or not,'' Bonds said. ''Mike Hampton is a really good pitcher, and I really don't think anything like that would upset him.''</p>
        <p>The line between the Giants and the Mets was drawn again when Hampton walked Kent and fired the fastball that Burks clanked halfway up the left-field foul pole for a 5-1 lead. Burks has played in the postseason five times with four teams. He has batted .279, but his home run today was only his second in 17 playoff games.</p>
        <p>''We're going to need him throughout this series,'' Bonds said of Burks.</p>
        <p>Burks's home run came after the Mets had tied it, 1-1, on Jay Payton's sacrifice fly in the third inning. ''It's important to answer back like that to keep your momentum going,'' Burks said.</p>
        <p>Hernandez improved to 5-0 in his postseason career with a 2.75 earned run average. He got Piazza to pop up three times and was difficult on the middle of the Mets' lineup. ''It's a tough lineup, with a lot of power hitters like Piazza,'' Hernandez said. ''With him, you don't want to make a mistake.''</p>
