        <p>Read of love and the emotions arising from it, and suddenly and surprisingly you realize that mostly you are reading novels written by men, not women, or so it seems. Now I'm not talking of fantasy romances -- dashing executives and swooning young women -- or bodice rippers, but of the mazy pleasantries and miseries of average people in common settings who unite, sometimes briefly, in triumph and tragedy. That's the ''love story'' genre.</p>
        <p>This fall there are three such books written by men that come to mind. All fill the reader's requirement for sentiment like so many chocolates consummating the need for sweets. One, ''The Rescue'' (Warner Books) by Nicholas Sparks, will be No. 1 on the hardcover best-seller list of The New York Times on Oct. 15, knocking off the top that manly man thriller, Tom Clancy's ''Bear and the Dragon (G. F. Putnam's Sons), which will go to No. 2. ''The Rescue'' is the story of a volunteer fireman who rescues and then finds love with a single mother who has a son with severe learning disabilities. Top that for piety and rapture.</p>
        <p>This is Mr. Sparks's fourth best seller. Remember ''Message in a Bottle'' (Warner, 1998)?</p>
        <p>The other man-woman love story written by a man is ''The Man Who Ate the 747'' (Bantam Books), a first novel by Ben Sherwood, a senior producer of the NBC ''Nightly News.'' In this romantic fable, which the hero of the novel calls ''the story of the greatest love, ever,'' a Nebraska farmer grinds the metal of a crashed airplane into a ''granular grayish ketchup'' and slowly eats it, bit by bit, to prove his love for a local woman. It doesn't work; he doesn't get the woman. But what a heroic effort! The novel is doing well, although it's not quite a best seller</p>
        <p>And soon to be in the bookstores is a tender and sad emotional story of family love and land by David Baldacci, the writer of best-selling thrillers. The novel is ''Wish You Well'' (Warner Books).</p>
        <p>Name the women who have written love stories, not romances, in recent years. Maybe some Alice Munro and Terry McMillan and a very few others. But men. Love stories, as opposed to romances, actually go back to the Greek tragedies. Certainly Shakespeare had a way with them.</p>
        <p>In more recent years it probably all started with Erich Segal's ''Love Story''(Harper &amp; Row, 1970) or perhaps before that with the novels of John P. Marquand. (Whichever. I'm not about to risk putting Shakespeare and Segal in the same paragraph.) Then there was Robert James Waller's ''Bridges of Madision County'' (Warner Books, 1992), which was on the best-seller list for more than three years. One publisher recalled: ''A lot of women writers said it read like a category romance, and who are you kidding? If it had been written by a woman it would have been in the back of the store, but because it was a male author it was taken seriously.'' Then came Nicholas Evans's ''Horse Whisperer'' (Delacorte, 1995). And so on until today.</p>
        <p>Many women writers still believe that publishers will pay for better bookstore placement because this type of novel was written by a man.  In short, the same fiction by women would be relegated to the romance section of stores. There's very likely much truth in this: men getting in touch with their romantic feelings and slobbering in print about it are more likely to have their books prominently displayed in stores than women doing the same thing.</p>
        <p>The justification for this from publishers is that women are the greatest book buyers; the theory, then, is that women want to find out how men really think about relationships, and reading love stories written by men is one way to do that.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sherwood denies that he wrote his book to get in touch with his feelings: ''I decided I wanted to write about the extraordinary things people will do in the pursuit of great love, the crazy, embarrassing and outlandish gestures people make in the name of love.'' Grinding up and eating an airplane surely qualifies. He added, however: ''I do think when it comes to emotion, men are underrated. So if a man writes a love story it adds a certain measure of curiosity about what men think of love; there may be a special interest in what the Martians have to say about love and emotions.''</p>
        <p>His publisher, Irwyn Applebaum, said that he did not ''think these writers set out to pander or do gender profiling'' with stories of love and emotion. ''It happens that these three novels written by men all touched aspects of their lives and tell how men really think, and most readers are women, so they'll be interested.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sparks said: ''A love story is a very tough genre to work in successfully. I try to keep my men regular guys, doing regular things. Characters in love stories have to be in common settings, but have to meet in original ways and fall in love in original ways -- a photographer photographing country bridges meets a woman -- and then have the tragedy of not being able to stay together. Romance novels must end happily. Love stories have to have a tragedy.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sparks's publisher, Jamie Raab, said these novels succeed, when they do, ''because women like reading love books by men because it makes them believe that men have a romantic side to them, or at least believe that some men understand women.'' She continued, ''When men write these books, it still seems a novelty to many woman and that's another reason they sell so well.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Baldacci, the thriller writer, describes his novel ''Wish You Well'' this way: ''It's Southern fiction, about working people and their attachment to the land. It's about faith, the faith and belief people have in each other. Well, I've been thinking about it for a long time, and after five thrillers this seemed the right moment.''</p>
        <p>All this seems pretty winsome when one is accustomed to the male author cliche as eye-catchingly macho, turning out muscular prose that crackles. But remember Erich Segal's one recalled sentence was ''Love means not ever having to say you're sorry.'' For these writers that certainly holds true.</p>
        <p>MAKING BOOKS  Correction:  October 6, 2000, Friday  Because of an editing error, the Making Books column on Thursday, about the market appeal of romantic novels, misstated the name of the publisher of ''The Bear and the Dragon,'' a thriller by Tom Clancy. It is G. P. Putnam's Sons, not G. F.</p>
