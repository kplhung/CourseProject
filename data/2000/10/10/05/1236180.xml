        <p>The new man behind the Chicago Blackhawks' bench, Alpo Suhonen, respects the accomplishments of other hockey coaches. But he also admires the work of William Shakespeare, Anton Chekhov, Samuel Beckett, Sam Shepard and Tennessee Williams. Between hockey jobs, Suhonen was the artistic director of the theater company in Turku, Finland. He said there are similarities between people who play between the boards of the hockey rink and those who perform on the boards of the stage.</p>
        <p>''To me, it's a very existential question, to be a player,'' Suhonen said. ''Theater or music or playing hockey or whatever -- are all dimensions in human life. They all come from the same origin: To be able to know yourself, to be able to communicate with society and with other people to tell your feelings, tell your sadness, tell your joys. To be a hockey player, it's kind of a role.''</p>

        <p>The new man behind the Chicago Blackhawks' bench, Alpo Suhonen, respects the accomplishments of other hockey coaches. But he also admires the work of William Shakespeare, Anton Chekhov, Samuel Beckett, Sam Shepard and Tennessee Williams. Between hockey jobs, Suhonen was the artistic director of the theater company in Turku, Finland. He said there are similarities between people who play between the boards of the hockey rink and those who perform on the boards of the stage.</p>
        <p>''To me, it's a very existential question, to be a player,'' Suhonen said. ''Theater or music or playing hockey or whatever -- are all dimensions in human life. They all come from the same origin: To be able to know yourself, to be able to communicate with society and with other people to tell your feelings, tell your sadness, tell your joys. To be a hockey player, it's kind of a role.''</p>
        <p>Suhonen, 51, is assembling his multinational cast for the 2000-2001 National Hockey League season, which began its 84th year last night with a game between the Colorado Avalanche and the Dallas Stars. In the first full season of the 21st century, Suhonen's artistic background is not the only thing that makes him unique among his peers.</p>
        <p>He and Pittsburgh's Ivan Hlinka, 50, represent a new era in what has become a 30-team league. With about 30 percent of the N.H.L.'s players now from Europe, Suhonen and Hlinka are its first two head coaches born and reared in Europe.</p>
        <p>''I don't like to say I'm nervous, but this is something special for me,'' Hlinka said. ''I am very glad to get a chance to be inside the biggest hockey business around the world.''</p>
        <p>Suhonen paid his hockey dues by coaching Finland's Olympic team and by serving as an N.H.L. assistant in Toronto and Winnipeg. Hlinka has even gaudier credentials. Before serving as an associate head coach last season in Pittsburgh, he rebuilt the Czech Republic's national program and coached its Olympic team to a gold medal in the 1998 Winter Games in Nagano, Japan.</p>
        <p>Long before that, Hlinka played for the national team of Czechoslovakia and he spent two seasons with the Vancouver Canucks in the early 1980's, when European hockey players were rare on this side of the Atlantic. Craig Patrick, the Penguins' general manager who hired Hlinka, has also assembled a team with 15 European players, the most ever in the N.H.L., whose teams dress 20 players for games. Ten Penguins are from Hlinka's native land, including Jaromir Jagr, the captain. But that does not mean Hlinka will be partial to any particular nationality, Patrick said.</p>
        <p>''He's not going to play any favorites at all,'' Patrick said. ''He's a players' coach, and he gets close to all his players.''</p>
        <p>As for the extra attention sure to fall on Hlinka, Patrick said: ''I don't think he feels any pressure. We certainly don't feel any pressure for him or put any pressure on him.''</p>
        <p>Patrick, who is an American, is a minority in a sport that is still dominated by Canadian executives. Mike Smith, another American general manager, hired Suhonen.</p>
        <p>When Smith ran the Winnipeg Jets in the early 1990's, he was often criticized for putting Europeans on his roster. Some Canadian journalists and fans felt their citizens were entitled to a hiring preference. Smith, who began his N.H.L. career as a Rangers assistant coach in 1976, said that the diversification of the league was inevitable at all levels, despite initial resistance.</p>
        <p>''Hockey is a game of prejudices,'' Smith said. ''It's all tribalism, nationalism, regionalism, whatever. It probably tells you the power of the game to overcome this prejudice. The game is stronger than its prejudices.''</p>
        <p>Smith recalled an era when some N.H.L. executives believed French-Canadians could never coach teams outside Quebec, a theory that evaporated in the 1980's when Jacques Demers won in St. Louis and Detroit. But Smith said this does not guarantee the immediate acceptance of European coaches.</p>
        <p>''There are lots of hockey people who it probably wouldn't bother them if they were to see Hlinka and Alpo fail,'' Smith said. But he also said that their success or failure would not make them test cases for their nationalities, any more than American collegiate or European players did for those who came after them.</p>
        <p>''In reality, hockey is an international game,'' Smith said. ''There are lots of Europeans as players. There are lots of Europeans as scouts. And we're going to have Europeans as coaches.''</p>
        <p>Smith's roster is about half North American, but this is his first full season on the job. On Monday, he traded Bryan McCabe of Canada to Toronto for Aleksandr Karpovtsev of Russia.</p>
        <p>Despite the reluctance of some executives and franchises to hire Europeans, a survey of league rosters suggests a rapidly increasing diversification. Part of this is because of expansion, which this year includes new franchises in Columbus, Ohio, and Minnesota. In 1967, when the league expanded from 6 to 12 teams, its players were 97.7 percent Canadian and 2 percent were American. The other 1.3 percent were born outside North America.</p>
        <p>The Canadian percentage declined to less than 90 percent for the first time in 1977-78, when it was 89.5. By 1992-93 it had decreased to 66.2 percent and last season it was 56.3 percent. The American percentage rose to more than 10 percent for the first time in 1979-80, when it reached 11.6 percent. It reached a peak of 19.9 percent in 1994-95 and last season was 16 percent.</p>
        <p>The proportion of N.H.L. players from outside North America -- almost all of them European -- reached double figures for the first time in 1989-90, when it was 12 percent. It increased to 20.8 percent in 1995-1996 and to 27.7 percent last season. The first wave of Europeans, from Sweden and Finland, arrived in the 1970's. Players from the country then known as Czechoslovakia joined in the 1980's and athletes from the former Soviet Union arrived in the 1990's in large numbers.</p>
        <p>One of the first Russians was Slava Fetisov, who played with the Devils and the Detroit Red Wings and who is now an assistant coach in New Jersey. For reasons both nationalistic and political, the Russians faced great resistance.</p>
        <p>''Eleven years ago, when I came here, they said Europeans don't belong in this league,'' Fetisov said. ''But you see what is happening right now: lots of Europeans and they dominate at many positions.''</p>
        <p>Fetisov said he expects to see an expansion of European coaching methods, such as the use of five-man units instead of separate shifts of three forwards and two defensemen. ''I think it's a game moving in the right direction,'' Fetisov said.</p>
        <p>He works for Lou Lamoriello, another American general manager. The Devils won the Stanley Cup last season, their second in six years, and Lamoriello consistently compiles one of the league's most international rosters.</p>
        <p>But Jagr, whom Hlinka calls ''the best hockey player in the world,'' expressed some trepidation last May when Hlinka was hired.</p>
        <p>''It's always a risk when you do something new,'' Jagr said. ''He can be a hero. He can be a zero.''</p>
        <p>Jagr wears the number 68 on his back to commemorate the uprising against the Soviet Union in Prague in 1968.</p>
        <p>Darius Kasparaitis of the Penguins, a Lithuanian who was trained in the Soviet hockey program, said Hlinka's system would be successful and may surprise some teams and fans, because he will encourage his players to hold onto the puck instead of playing the dump-and-chase style favored in Canada.</p>
        <p>''Our forwards keep the puck all the time,'' Kasparaitis said. ''Remember how the 'Russian Five' played in Detroit? That's what Ivan wants to do here.''</p>
        <p>Kasparaitis is part of the intense locker-room banter among the Penguins. He good-naturedly calls Czech players Slovaks and Czech players call him a Russian. Kasparaitis said most Penguins use English for both teasing and serious conversation. ''We're all here with the same accent,'' he said. ''Hockey terminology is not that hard.''</p>
        <p>Matthew Barnaby, a Penguin who is Canadian, said it was ''a little weird'' to feel like a minority, but that ''we joke about it and it's a lot of fun, too.'' (Pittsburgh's Canadians are called Americans by some of their European teammates.) Hlinka keeps the mood light, Barnaby said, by exchanging jests, by maintaining an upbeat disposition and speaking English most of the time.</p>
        <p>While some N.H.L. coaches insist that only English be spoken in the dressing room, neither Hlinka nor Suhonen have such a rule. Hlinka studied English last summer with a tutor, but he often pauses before carefully choosing his words.</p>
        <p>''Each month, it will be better,'' he said of his English. ''I can also speak German. I can speak Russian, a little bit.''</p>
        <p>Suhonen, whose favorite playwrights came from many different nations, said, ''Everybody has a right to speak his own language.''</p>
        <p>When asked which ones he speaks best, Suhonen chuckled and replied: ''a little bit many.''</p>
        <p>''The hockey language is very international,'' he said. ''You don't need words to play. It's like music.''</p>
