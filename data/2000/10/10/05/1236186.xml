        <p>Worried that New York City students are ill equipped to meet new graduation requirements in mathematics, Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy has appointed a panel to study how the subject is taught in city classrooms and to recommend changes by spring.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levy said he was concerned because starting this year, high school students throughout New York State will have to pass a Regents mathematics examination to graduate. Yet nearly 70 percent of fourth and eighth graders failed the citywide math tests last year, and math scores have remained flat for three years straight.</p>

        <p>Worried that New York City students are ill equipped to meet new graduation requirements in mathematics, Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy has appointed a panel to study how the subject is taught in city classrooms and to recommend changes by spring.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levy said he was concerned because starting this year, high school students throughout New York State will have to pass a Regents mathematics examination to graduate. Yet nearly 70 percent of fourth and eighth graders failed the citywide math tests last year, and math scores have remained flat for three years straight.</p>
        <p>''The school system has not made any progress in mathematics in the last several years, and it's now time for us to focus on this in a critical way,'' Mr. Levy said yesterday. ''It is critical that children be not only literate, but numerate.''</p>
        <p>The chairman of Mr. Levy's panel will be Matthew Goldstein, the chancellor of the City University of New York, who has a Ph.D. in mathematics. Mr. Goldstein worked with Mr. Levy to select the other 13 members of the panel, including Philip Uri Treisman, a math professor at the University of Texas and a former MacArthur fellow; Lynn Arthur Steen, president of the American Mathematical Association; Lee McCaskill, principal of Brooklyn Technical High School; and David Brownstein, head of municipal derivatives at Salomon Smith Barney.</p>
        <p>Among other things, the panel will examine a new kind of math instruction that has taken root in Manhattan's District 2 and in some other areas of the city in recent years. Proponents of the ''new math,'' as it is known, believe it is more important for children to construct their own solutions to math problems than to learn the standard practices that schools have traditionally taught. Many schools that favor the approach do not even use textbooks.</p>
        <p>Some parents have protested the approach, complaining that their children are not learning the skills they need to succeed academically and professionally.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levy said he also wanted the panel to decide whether the passing grade on the Regents math exam is reasonable. Mr. Levy does not have any control over the passing grade, because the State Board of Regents makes that decision. But he could recommend that the board change it.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levy said one of the panel's most important tasks would be ensuring that the city's math curriculum prepared students not only for the Regents exams, but also for the entrance exams required by CUNY, and even the College Board test. Another crucial question is whether the skills students acquire in city math classes are ones they are likely to need in the new economy.</p>
        <p>''We have to figure out whether we are teaching children something that is actually going to be useful,'' Mr. Levy said. ''We should not gratuitiously torture students to learn mathematics that is no longer relevant.''</p>
