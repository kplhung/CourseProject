        <p>DESIGN euphoria finally has a New York home. Ian Schrager's new hotel, the Hudson, contains a thousand guest rooms, a suite of public rooms and an outdoor garden, but the main attraction is the imagination with which Mr. Schrager and Philippe Starck have redesigned the face of the cosmopolitan idea. For the city of strangers, they have proposed an aesthetic of strangeness. It's a match.</p>
        <p>The Hudson, which opened Tuesday on 58th Street between Eighth and Ninth Avenues, pumps up New York's legendary status as a noble social experiment. It also brings Mr. Schrager into focus as one of the outstanding social scientists of our time. How much rejection will people risk for the sake of feeling accepted? How much unfamiliarity can they tolerate? Sociologists routinely address questions along these lines. In Mr. Schrager's environments, people get to live the questions.</p>
        <p>How much design can people tolerate? How many people are willing to pay for a room in which all but a few inches of floor space is covered by the mattress? How do you create a raving, Dionysian bar scene without repelling the Apollonian creative types you would also like to attract? These are a few of the experiments that will be conducted on paying volunteers inside the Hudson hotel.</p>
        <p>But this project also raises questions about the city outside its doors. Why has New York architecture been driven inside? What does it mean that talented architects of Mr. Starck's generation are lucky if they get to work on loft, restaurant and store interiors? What does this portend for a city that takes civic pride in its cosmopolitan composition?</p>
        <p>I have always loved hotels, and I never tire of Philippe Starck. I could live serenely in one of the Hudson's small $95-a-night bedrooms. Each is a perfect pillbox, your daily vitamin of space. The minimum requirements include a queen-size bed, little reading lamps with shades that reproduce watercolors by Francesco Clemente, and an emaciated desk. Perfect for writing spare prose. Only the slimmest laptops need apply.</p>
        <p>You enter the room through a tiny hall: for a room this size, any hall feels extravagant. Shower/bath on the left. Storage on the right. A mini-stereo set and a mini-minibar. A mini-window above the headboard, and that's it. Suites are available, starting at $150, but why bother. Sleep small. Dream big. That's the Hudson idea. It's an Eloise concept. The grown-up world as seen through children's eyes.</p>
        <p>At the Hudson, everything is a play on scale, from the stretch-version ''Vertigo'' escalators at the entrance to the bento box rooms upstairs. Just the thought of a 1,000-room Schrager hotel is a wild exaggeration. This boutique hotel is designed for Gulliver's travels.</p>
        <p>IS design the new lingua franca for global travelers? Thomas Fisher, dean of the college of architecture and landscape architecture at the University of Minnesota, is dedicating a new division of his school to that idea. And why not? Design has functioned throughout history as a system of signs. Check out Chartres. Now it serves as a communications medium for the new economy. Checkout and check-in.</p>
        <p>Post-literate people will feel most welcome at the Hudson. At the entrance, no name, no letters, no typography disturb the design. Instead, there is a torch with an eternal flame, suspended beside a doorway sheathed with chartreuse glass. In colonial days, hospitality was symbolized by carved wooden pineapples placed by the door. At the Hudson, citron twists are evidently the fruit of choice.</p>
        <p>Just inside the entrance there will be gift shops specializing in the well-designed traveler's needs. But if you're checking in, you will want to step aboard the escalator that carries you up two floors through a narrow tunnel bathed with yellow-green light. You will feel like a sip of margarita rising through a straw. (Carry your own paper umbrella.)</p>
        <p>The main lobbies of all grand hotels are stage sets. At the Hudson, the play appears to take place in a lively town square. There ought to be gesticulating extras milling about in a crowd scene, saying things like ''cheese and crackers, cheese and crackers,'' while pretending to converse among themselves. The centerpiece of this square, in effect its statue or fountain, is a long wooden desk carved with a mock-Bavarian motif, and an enormous Baccarat chandelier with hologram candles designed by Ingo Maurer.</p>
        <p>The lobby is ringed with the sort of refreshment spots you would expect to find in a well-appointed piazza. Only a Surrealist sense of surprise unites the different styles in which the public rooms are designed. Collegiate Gothic is the motif in the restaurant, or Cafeteria, as it is called here. Heavy brown curtains. Heavy oak chairs. Refectory tables with heavy oak benches. The effect is ''The Belles of St. Trinian's'': a gang of louche students running amok in the seedy boarding school that now occupies a former stately home.</p>
        <p>The bar is Kubrick territory. The translucent floor, illuminated from beneath, sets off tables and chairs like game pieces on a board. Make your move toward a Regency side chair with silicone cushions. Or pull up a log, equipped with backrests, designed by the Dutch firm Droog. Overhead, a fresco by Mr. Clemente brings back memories of similar work executed by the artist for the Palladium, an earlier Schrager experiment. To my eye, the ceiling creates a stronger impact than the installation conceived for the Guggenheim Museum's Clemente retrospective last year.</p>
        <p>More post-literacy awaits in the Library, a room of clublike ambience with bookshelves that wrap around the walls. But the shelves are too high to reach. They are pitched at balcony height, but there is no balcony, and no rolling ladder.</p>
        <p>Lower down, however, are slanting, lecternlike shelves displaying  art books. And desks with computer screens set into the surface. The room is dominated, however, by a pool table of British imperial aspirations, and the immense metallic shade of the Ingo Maurer lamp suspended above.</p>
        <p>Eloise will take over the park. She will not want for attention here. Installed in the courtyard between the building's two wings, the so-called Private Park has been conceived as a theater: the play within the play. Readings and recitals will be offered, along with drinks and snacks, while the guest rooms looking onto the garden will form tier upon tier of private boxes.</p>
        <p>A glass roof partly encloses the park, which is furnished with huge topiary pots, an immense rake and other grossly inflated garden tools. But some may find that the most gracious touch is the existing balustrade overlooking West 57th Street. Classic Georgian in style, it is an icon for gracious prewar city life, as well as a fine place to perch and pose.</p>
        <p>The dream logic of Mr. Starck's design invites the possibility that things could turn nightmarish. At any moment, the brick walls of the park might dissolve and we would behold a scene out of Genet. From the courtyard of a vast panopticon, we would see road warriors in their terry cloth robes, isolated in $95 cells, grimly wishing away the confinement with flicks of the speed dial. Let's wander over to the Library, where Alba Clemente is reading aloud selected passages from Cocteau's ''Voix Humaine'' to an audience of crows and pigeons.</p>
        <p>It strikes me that Mr. Starck may be feeling at home with himself.  What is notable about the Hudson is that few pieces of furniture bear the designer's tradmark. Instead, he has curated environments that include furnishings by other well-known designers (Charles and Ray Eames, Ingo Maurer, Droog), along with generic examples of period styles. Executed with precision and spirit by Anda Andrei and Michael Overington, longtime players on Mr. Schrager's team, the result is more relaxed, more diverse, less insistent on controlling the atmosphere.</p>
        <p>I F I had the means, I would furnish each room with a copy of Bonnie Menes Kahn's wonderful book, ''Cosmopolitan Culture: The Gilt-Edged Dream of a Tolerant City'' (Atheneum, 1988). The book is not quite Eloise. It is a grown-up valentine to a certain ideal of city life. The cosmopolitan cities are the cities of great architecture, great art, great music, the cities of great renown, Ms. Kahn writes. It is no accident that where the stranger is welcome, there is both tolerance and genius.</p>
        <p>She has many provocative things to say about the social forces that make and break a great cosmopolis, but the key to it all is the spirit of tolerance for strangers. I'd go further and say that what makes the difference is a ravenous appetite for strangers, even an inexhaustible desire to be a stranger. Night life flourishes on this principle. The great Peter Gay, writing on Weimar Berlin, termed this phenomenon the outsider as insider. This idea is dramatized at the Hudson. It is a ''Mahagonny,'' ''I Am a Camera,'' ''Street Song'' world.</p>
        <p>Which isn't to say that everyone will feel comfortable here. New York is the most judgmental city in the world, and the Hudson can't help keeping up that tradition, too. It helps to be a certain kind of narcissist, the type who never throws a fit to get attention because he always assumes he's getting it, even when he's being ignored. It also helps to be a creative type with more dash than cash, as Vogue used to call it.</p>
        <p>The Hudson is a refuge for such people, and for all those who crave what is lacking in the city outside: the realization of contemporaneity in public, urban space. Think about what happens in the street: you make a split-second decision whether to marry, kill or stare right through everybody who comes walking toward you on the sidewalk. This complex of reactions is primal, uncivilized, self-centered, basic, romantic and normal. They are tolerant and intolerant at the same time. They wouldn't work with people you know. They depend on your tolerance for strangers. Variations on this experience can be found in music, publishing, theater, dance and any other quarter of the city where cultural values hold sway.</p>
        <p>The Hudson transposes the street dynamic into a compact indoor version. Like it, hate it, like it, hate it. A man with a bad toupee walks through. Oh, the humanity! Oh, the unstylishness! This is the worst thing that ever happened in the world! But if you feel at home here, it's because you enjoy being a stranger among strangers, and the sense of freedom that arises from it.</p>
        <p>Mr. Starck has codified that sensation in color, scale, light and space. It can, he shows, be done. And that's not a minor lesson in New York at a time when the city's builders have become addicted to an architecture that merely reassures us with signs of the all too familiar. In this sense, the Hudson is a ghetto for architecture, an art form for which New York has developed almost zero tolerance over the years, an art that must now be practiced in privacy between consenting adults.</p>
        <p>The Hudson has an unmarked entrance, elevators for mass transit, a brick air shaft for a park and a public library with a pool table. Community boards can't shut it down, the Landmarks Commission can't declare it inappropriate and city planners can't subject it to the approval of so-called design advisers. Imagine the possibilities if the city at large were to be liberated from the intolerance coded within such restraints.</p>
