        <p>Tuesday was an evening of biology as destiny, genetically groomed specimens caught up in a battle over prescription drugs, the gulf between rich and poor, and apocalyptic pronouncements about the fate of the post-millennial world.</p>
        <p>That was the TV show you wanted to watch, over on Fox. ''Dark Angel'' had everything the presidential debates did not. Snappy dialogue. Captivating style. Gripping fight scenes. A compelling star, 19-year-old Jessica Alba, as Max, the bicycle messenger in a ''Blade Runner'' world who has black-leather attitude and a bar code stamped on her neck denoting her souped-up DNA.</p>
        <p>Max knows how to handle the Unexpected, and it's not by distributing hugs and tears to the dispossessed or even by inviting Russian ex-prime ministers over to her crib. She is not just a Reformer With Results. She's a Reformer With Lips. And unlike Al Gore, she knows how to apply makeup so that she doesn't look like a big, orange, waxy, wickless candle.</p>
        <p>On ''Dark Angel,'' America's technology has been vitiated by terrorists who tossed up an electromagnetic pulse. At least there was a pulse.</p>
        <p>On the networks you could find the flatlining show you didn't want to watch, the tantric debate between the Insufferable and the Insufficient.</p>
        <p>I wanted to strangle Gore and slap Bush. I wanted the Dark Angel to hang both these weenies out of a window by their ankles, as she did some pushy, tattooed blonde.</p>
        <p>To borrow Max's lingo, I was not loving hanging in social studies class with prissy rich dudes yapping about the land of milk and honey, blah, blah, blah. I wanted to jet.</p>
        <p>A Max observation summed up my feelings about the Oedipal one-upmanship of Bush and Gore: ''I actually feel sorry for guys sometimes. They're prisoners of their genes.'' (''So are dogs,'' her lesbian pal retorted.)</p>
        <p>This was the first debate, after all, that seemed genetically determined.</p>
        <p>Al Gore senior was a famous Southern orator who taught his son to get used to settings where he had to talk. George Bush senior was a famous New England non-orator who taught his son to be wary of settings where he had to talk.</p>
        <p>Al Gore learned from his father the value of old-fashioned populism, making a case to the people. W. learned from his father the value of old-fashioned elitism, not having to make a case to the people.</p>
        <p>W. did not check his watch, as dad did. But he was just as eager to see the clock run out. He acted annoyed, in a genial way, when Al Gore filibustered and threw in brain-twisters. But W. did not try very hard to wrest back the microphone. The microphone is not his friend.</p>
        <p>Months of study had given W. a fragile grip on the issues, but the tension about whether he would know an answer evoked the scene in Hitchcock's ''North by Northwest'' when Cary Grant (W.) is hanging on to the Mount Rushmore precipice by his fingertips and Martin Landau (Gore) is grinding his foot into Cary's hand.</p>
        <p>W.'s policy riffs were filled, as the jazz critic Whitney Balliett wrote of Thelonious Monk, ''with dissonances and rhythms that often give one the sensation of missing the bottom step in the dark.''</p>
        <p>Why does a man who has to be confronted with the inquisitive specter of Jim Lehrer to concentrate his mind on issues believe he is ready to be president?</p>
        <p>Al Gore was taught formal intellectual policy discourse at his father's knee. W. was taught informal bull sessions with the inner circle at his father's knee.</p>
        <p>Al Gore was never a natural performer, like his father, so he concentrated harder on his homework. If he could not be charming, he would be dogged. So now, in debates, he is doomed to be Annoying Boy, apple-polishing and doing that smug-mugging.</p>
        <p>Asked on CNN about his unvocalized but audible condescension, Mr. Gore explained that he thought his sighing was off the record: ''Under the debate rules we were told there was going to be no coverage of our reactions when the other guy was talking,'' he said fastidiously.</p>
        <p>The vice president showed he was ready for the Oval Office. Still, you  wanted to pull down his collar and see if there was a bar code on the back of his neck. He seems like a genetically engineered politician prototype, but with something slightly off -- as though the scientists in the lab didn't give the beaker that extra shake.</p>
