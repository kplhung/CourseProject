        <p>The semiconductor maker Broadcom said yesterday that it would acquire Element 14, a British developer of high-speed communications chip sets, for $594 million. The privately held company makes low-power digital subscriber line chip sets and other network technology. Element 14, a year-old company with 68 employees, is based in Cambridge, England. Broadcom said that the acquisition would help expand its local and wide-area network offerings with a full range of DSL technology for home and enterprises. As part of the deal, Broadcom will issue 2.65 million shares of its common stock in exchange for all of Element 14's stock.</p>
