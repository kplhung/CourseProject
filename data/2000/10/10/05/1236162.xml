        <p>Roger A. Enrico, 55, the chairman and chief executive who transformed PepsiCo from an expansive and rather cumbersome conglomerate into a streamlined packaged-foods company, announced yesterday that he would retire by the end of next year.</p>
        <p>Steve S. Reinemund, 52, PepsiCo's president and chief operating officer, who is known for his tenacious and, at times, single-minded focus on growth, will take over the position as chief executive by 2002 and chairman by 2003.</p>
        <p>While the succession had been expected since last year, Mr. Enrico said yesterday that he chose an auspicious time for the company to formally make it public. In addition to announcing Mr. Enrico's retirement yesterday, PepsiCo reported its fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, and forecast a fifth, bolstering investor enthusiasm for a company that had struggled through much of the 1990's.</p>
        <p>''This is a great capstone,'' Mr. Enrico said in an interview.</p>
        <p>With the momentum it has gathered from consistently beating analysts' earnings forecasts, PepsiCo has wrestled away much of the confidence analysts previously reserved for its chief rival, Coca-Cola, which is grappling with a painful revamping.</p>
        <p>Coke remains far ahead of Pepsi in the beverage business, with a 44 percent market share, compared with slightly more than 31 percent for Pepsi, but many analysts say PepsiCo is poised to grow faster in the critical segments of the industry, including juices and water.</p>
        <p>''Pepsi has gone from a 'show me' company to one that has believers,'' said Emanuel Goldman, an analyst with ING Barings. ''Now Coke has become the 'show me' stock.''</p>
        <p>In a conference call with analysts and reporters yesterday, Mr. Enrico sidestepped taking credit for the improvement in PepsiCo's results and emphasized Mr. Reinemund's role in revamping the company, reassuring investors that a ''seamless transition'' was under way. But while Mr. Reinemund has shouldered much of the hands-on responsibility for steering PepsiCo through its recent successes, and has served on the board for more than a year, Mr. Enrico is widely thought to be the visionary behind its transformation.</p>
        <p>Often referred to as the ''great cola warrior,'' Mr. Enrico took charge of Pepsi's beverage business in 1983 and quickly started a highly visible assault on Coca-Cola's dominance in the category. Enlisting celebrities like Michael Jackson for splashy advertising campaigns, he whittled away at Coke's market share, earning a reputation as a flashy but no less worthy adversary. At one point, Pepsi actually surpassed Coke in grocery sales.</p>
        <p>Although he said he ''never hungered for'' the chief executive spot, Mr. Enrico's subsequent experience running the company's Frito-Lay and restaurant divisions -- which, at the time, included Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and KFC -- made him the obvious replacement for the chief executive at the time, Wayne Calloway, who fell ill with prostate cancer in the early 1990's.</p>
        <p>Mr. Enrico stepped in to lead PepsiCo in 1996, after the company had been battered by seven consecutive quarters of disappointing results in 1994 and 1995. In short order, he abandoned costly yet unproductive efforts to go head to head with Coke in South America, turning PepsiCo's attentions to countries where Coke was less entrenched and Pepsi could better compete. He also orchestrated a barrage of complaints to overseas regulators about Coke's marketing practices, setting off the many numerous antitrust investigations that now besiege its rival.</p>
        <p>Convinced that PepsiCo's restaurants were hampering its growth, Mr. Enrico spun them off into Tricon Global Restaurants Inc. in 1997, ridding the company of an expensive and labor-intensive division. Then, in 1998, he oversaw the acquisition of Tropicana, now one of PepsiCo's fastest-growing brands. Finally, in 1999, he led the initial public offering of the Pepsi Bottling Group, which bottles drinks and gets them into stores, leaving PepsiCo to focus on the highly profitable concentrated syrup and salty snacks businesses.</p>
        <p>In paring down the company, Mr. Enrico is credited with having unified its corporate culture. Today, it is common practice for Tropicana, Pepsi and Frito-Lay to join together to promote their products, a strategy that PepsiCo has used to great advantage with large retailers like Wal-Mart. But that spirit of cooperation is a recent phenomenon, analysts said, and in prior years the company's separate units consistently tried to outdo one another, hoping to prove their worth in the conglomerate's portfolio.</p>
        <p>''It was almost as if it was like a dysfunctional family in which businesses were pitted against one another to get ahead,'' said Andrew Conway, a Morgan Stanley Dean Witter analyst.</p>
        <p>As the head of PepsiCo's Frito-Lay and Pizza Hut units, Mr. Reinemund, a former Marine captain, was steeped in that competitive culture, and became known as a taskmaster unwaveringly dedicated to short-term results. Under Mr. Enrico's tutelage, however, many say Mr. Reinemund has broadened his perspective and smoothed his rougher edges.</p>
        <p>''There's no question that Steve is an individual in continuous improvement,'' said Mr. Enrico, who prefers not to take the credit.</p>
