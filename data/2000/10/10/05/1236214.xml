        <p>The Giants continued yesterday to reassemble the pieces from two consecutive losses with an eye on the Atlanta Falcons. In both losses -- especially in Tennessee last Sunday -- the Giants found an array of leaks that need plugging.</p>
        <p>The running game needs a charge. The passing game could use a boost. The tackling requires improvement. There is a need to guard against becoming so varied on offense that players who must touch the ball -- Tiki Barber, Ron Dayne, Amani Toomer and Ike Hilliard -- get it early and often.</p>
        <p>Over all, the Giants know they will go nowhere without the proper mind-set and confidence. They know that winning at Atlanta on Sunday and reaching a 4-2 record would, for the moment, remedy that.</p>
        <p>At least the Giants are not being pulverized on the ground. They allowed 89 rushing yards to Washington's Stephen Davis and 125 to Tennessee's Eddie George. Far from perfect, but neither back hurt the Giants as much as their pass defense. In the last two games, it has crumbled, particularly against Tennessee.</p>
        <p>The Giants allowed 28 first downs against Tennessee. Thirteen passing first downs were allowed in the first half and five more were allowed in the second. Consider that nine National Football League teams last Sunday did not gain a total of 18 first downs in their entire games.</p>
        <p>There is the thought that pass defense begins and ends with the secondary. But the Giants illustrated against Tennessee that is not the case. Potent pass defense begins with the pass rush of the defensive linemen, with the linebackers dropping back swiftly and effectively in coverage and the secondary clicking, all in unison.</p>
        <p>Against Tennessee, the Giants had one sack and few other quarterback pressures. The linebackers were routinely beaten on pass routes by the Tennessee tight ends. Add that to the mistakes in the secondary and you have a catastrophe.</p>
        <p>''You could put Dick (Night Train) Lane at cornerback with Herb Adderly,'' said Ernie Accorsi, the Giants' general manager, referring to the Hall of Famers, ''and if they don't have a pass rush, they don't have a chance.''</p>
        <p>''It's an 11-man deal,'' said John Fox, the Giants' defensive coordinator. ''Teams that play good pass defense in this league have corners who can cover and a good four-man rush.''</p>
        <p>Accorsi and Fox both admit it takes talent to play cornerback. Even more talent is required when one or two extra cornerbacks are added to the defense in passing situations. The cornerbacks are exposed, usually in a one-on-one deal. Sooner or later, they have to make plays and defend against receivers, usually the fastest and most explosive players on the field.</p>
        <p>The Giants know about Jason Sehorn at one corner. They believe Dave Thomas, the free agent from Jacksonville, can do it.</p>
        <p>The nickel back is Emmanuel McDaniel. Behind him is Reggie Stephens. Both are young with promise, but thus far, both have struggled.</p>
        <p>And that is expected. McDaniel is in his third year, but only his second with the Giants. Stephens, from Rutgers, is also in his second season with the Giants. When both enter games, offenses are looking for them. They want that matchup.</p>
        <p>''We're growing as a secondary,  and it's going to take a little bit of time,'' strong safety Sam Garnes said. ''There is a lot of communication going on with a lot of new people and some of the new people don't even know they are supposed to be communicating. Teams are going to attack us and we've got to do two things individually and as a group: first, know where you belong and second have confidence and believe in what you're doing.</p>
        <p>''When I was a rookie, offenses sure came after me. Players make mistakes up and down the field on defense, but the ones people remember the most are the ones in the end zone. That's been tough on some of our guys. But it's all about making plays and getting off the field on third downs. You've just got to get mad. You've got to challenge.''</p>
        <p>Fox asks a lot of his secondary and especially of McDaniel and Stephens. When they enter games, they are often covering slot receivers, usually among the most shifty and elusive on the field.</p>
        <p>''Right now it's a matter of timing and not playing tight,'' Stephens said. ''There are some plays to be made that we haven't made. It's also the experience factor, because the best way to learn is in games. But you can't give up touchdowns all the time while learning. There is a lot of thinking going on out there in the secondary, but I'm being like a sponge. I do accept the challenge.''</p>
        <p>And there are challenges, even in Atlanta. Receivers Terance Mathis, Shawn Jefferson and Tim Dwight are better than the Titans' crew of receivers, especially on the Georgia Dome's quick turf. With games against Atlanta, Dallas, Philadelphia and Cleveland up next, the goal of the pass defense is to blend into a strong unit that can help the Giants win.</p>
        <p>If that happened, the Giants would be 7-2 when they play the amazing and fleet St. Louis Rams' passing game at Giants Stadium on Nov. 12.</p>
        <p>The Giants are currently not ready for such a test. There is, however, opportunity and time.</p>
