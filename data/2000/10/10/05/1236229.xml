        <p>With New Yorkers citing education as a critical concern -- and with some voters still undecided in the Senate race -- Representative Rick A. Lazio and Hillary Rodham Clinton are spending a lot of time in classrooms as Election Day approaches.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton likes to say that she has been ''re-imagining the education system'' since the 1970's, when she was a law student working for the Children's Defense Fund. She has visited several dozen schools since announcing her candidacy and portrayed herself as a champion of teachers, while calling for more rigorous teacher training.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio, her Republican opponent, has not been not particularly vocal about education issues for most of his eight years in Congress, although he recently sponsored bills to expand alternative certification and teacher mentoring programs. On the campaign trail, Mr. Lazio stresses the importance of local control over education policy and spending -- a theme he shares with Gov. George W. Bush.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio has called for $98 billion in new federal spending on education over the next decade -- compared with the roughly $125 billion in education spending that Mrs. Clinton has proposed. The amount is striking, considering that Mr. Bush, the Republican presidential candidate, has proposed spending a mere $25 billion over five years.</p>
        <p>''Hillary's plan is not that different from what all the other Democrats are saying this year,'' said Amy Wilkins, a principal  partner of the Education Trust, a nonpartisan research group in Washington. ''But among Republicans, Lazio stands way out front in the amount of money he's willing to invest.''</p>
        <p>In fact, Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Lazio are offering many of the same ideas about how to improve schools. Both want the federal government to help finance the college education of people who pursue teaching careers. Both have proposed competency tests for teachers, and alternative certification programs as a solution to the state's severe teacher shortage. And both are calling for the federal government to invest billions of dollars in school construction.</p>
        <p>But many of Mrs. Clinton's proposals play to the powerful teacher unions that support her -- it was no coincidence that she first declared her candidacy at the United Federation of Teachers headquarters in Manhattan. In comparison, Mr. Lazio is more focused on wooing the suburban voters whose support he desperately needs. Mrs. Clinton has proposed testing prospective teachers on their subject of expertise as a condition of letting them teach, for example -- a plan the unions have endorsed. Mr. Lazio has also called for competency testing, but he wants school districts to have the option of testing teachers every five years. If teachers failed the test twice, they could not stay on the job under Mr. Lazio's plan.</p>
        <p>Randi Weingarten, president of the United Federation of Teachers, attacked Mr. Lazio's testing proposal at a meeting of 1,500 union delegates yesterday, comparing it with Alfonse M. D'Amato's proposal to eliminate teacher tenure in his unsuccessful bid for re-election to the Senate in 1998.</p>
        <p>''The teacher testing proposal he has enunciated is simply yet another way to get around tenure and due process,'' Ms. Weingarten told the assembled teachers as Mrs. Clinton looked on and nodded.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio also wants to invest $10 billion on a ''Hometown Choice'' grant program that would let local schools and parents decide how to spend the federal dollars. The plan seems aimed at suburban voters, who pay high property taxes in part because their school districts receive only a tiny amount of federal funds.</p>
        <p>Most significantly, Mr. Lazio wants to provide $60 billion -- the bulk of his $98 billion education package -- in grants to states to cover the cost of special education programs over 10 years. The federal government requires these programs under the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act, but pays only about 12 percent of the cost. Aware that the issue resonates with suburban voters, Mrs. Clinton has a similar proposal, although hers would provide $20 billion over 10 years.</p>
        <p>''It's a classic property tax issue,'' said Tom Loveless, director of the Brown Center on American Education at the Brookings Institution. ''Special education is a federally mandated program that consumes a huge amount of local education budgets.''</p>
        <p>Despite the laundry list of education proposals that each candidate is flourishing, much of the education debate in this campaign has focused on a single hot-button issue: federally financed vouchers that would give parents money to enroll their children in private schools. Mrs. Clinton has sided with the teacher unions in vehemently opposing vouchers, saying they would strip the public schools of precious resources.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio has quietly endorsed vouchers, a position that does appeal to more conservative voters. In Congress, he voted several times for experimental voucher programs. But in the Senate race, where he has been careful to paint himself as a moderate, he has referred to vouchers as ''opportunity scholarships.'' Under his plan, the federal government would provide $5 billion to families who have children in failing schools. The money could be put toward tuition at a private school.</p>
        <p>The Clinton campaign has pointed to Mr. Lazio's support of vouchers as glaring evidence that he does not respect the public school system. Mrs. Clinton has also accused him of fighting against education spending in Congress, lumping him with Newt Gingrich and other conservatives. In particular, she has attacked his votes in 1995 to abolish the Department of Education and to slash education spending as part of the Republican budget plan.</p>
        <p>Although Mrs. Clinton has no voting record to measure against Mr. Lazio's, she did play a major role in reshaping education policy in Arkansas in the 1980's, when her husband was that state's governor. Specifically, Mrs. Clinton led a commission that produced a number of recommendations for the state's public education system, including a longer school day, mandatory standardized tests for certain grades and higher teacher pay. Her husband financed the plan with a one-cent increase in the sales tax.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio has taken every opportunity, including last month's debate in Buffalo, to attack Mrs. Clinton's record on educational issues in Arkansas. One of his television advertisements states that ''spending went up and student scores went down'' as the result of her plan. The scores on the American College Test for Arkansas students did drop after the plan was put in place, but standardized test scores for elementary and secondary students went up. But policy experts say the issue is not likely to resonate with voters.</p>
        <p>Christopher Cross, president of the Council for Basic Education, a nonpartisan group that helps states establish academic standards, voiced skepticism about both candidates' proposals, saying some were poorly thought out and aimed more at capturing headlines and votes than improving schools in the long term. Mrs. Clinton, for example, has proposed federally financed scholarships for college students who commit to teaching. But Mr. Cross said the money would be better spent on loan forgiveness programs for teachers who took out student loans, since there is no way to ensure that the students who get the scholarships actually pursue teaching careers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio's plan to increase the percentage of federal dollars that pay for special education programs could just encourage local districts to place more students in special education classes, Ms. Wilkins of the Education Trust said. And Mrs. Clinton's proposal to require competency tests for teachers before they enter the classroom is redundant, Ms. Wilkins said, given that New York State already requires new teachers to pass a series of certification exams.</p>
        <p>No matter how strong their proposals, there is an irony in the amount of attention that Mr. Lazio and Mrs. Clinton are devoting to education issues: the federal government provides only seven percent of elementary and secondary education funds. Even though both candidates want to increase that percentage, federal dollars would still play only a marginal role in the average school's budget.</p>
        <p>''The federal financing role is so tiny and they would be only 1 out of 100 senators deciding how that money is spent,'' Mr. Loveless said. ''In that context, it's amazing how much time they are spending on this issue.''</p>
        <p>Take, for example, Mr. Lazio's proposal to spend $5 billion a year on school vouchers. If the money was split evenly among the 50 states, New York would get only $100 million. If each tuition voucher was worth $5,000 -- a relatively low amount considering most private school tuitions -- the program would serve 20,000 students.</p>
        <p>Another example is Mrs. Clinton's proposal to provide scholarships to 60,000 students a year if they promise to teach for at least four years. Arthur Levine, president of Teachers College at Columbia University, said the proposal was ''a nice idea,'' but that it was ''a drop in the bucket'' given that the nation needs at least two million new teachers over the next decade.</p>
        <p>''The country is demanding that any candidate running for office, from president to dog catcher, have a big education agenda,'' Dr. Levine said. ''But the federal government can't fix American schools.''</p>
