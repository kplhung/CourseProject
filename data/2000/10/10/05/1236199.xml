        <p>The Library of Congress has just received the largest single donation in its history, $60 million, and Dr. James H. Billington, the librarian, is eagerly preparing to spend it repairing relations between ''the thinkers and the doers,'' between a resident panel of visiting senior scholars he plans for the library and the politicians across the street in the Capitol.</p>
        <p>''These two worlds just kind of fell apart in the 60's and haven't really come back together again,'' Dr. Billington said as he explained his new program for the ultimate mix in political town and academic gown.</p>
        <p>He plans rotating far-flung scholars to Washington to pursue fresh research and play a ''catalytic'' intellectual role for Congress, the primary user of the national library.</p>
        <p>Beginning next year, the program will endow eight senior chairs plus a dozen fellowships for younger scholars. And most prominently, it will create a $1 million prize for intellectual excellence in the human sciences, a field that Dr. Billington feels is neglected by the Nobel prizes.</p>
        <p>''We're trying to celebrate and facilitate not just the life of the mind, but also the role of the life of the mind in the life of the republic,'' he said of the new scholar center, which will be named after its benefactor, John W. Kluge.</p>
        <p>A billionaire entrepreneur and philanthropist, Mr. Kluge heads the library's Madison Council, which has been enlisting advisers and donors from the private sector for the past decade. After helping the library raise about $160 million in the last 10 years from others, Mr. Kluge, now 85 and chairman of the Metromedia International telecommunications and entertainment company, has donated $60 million to it himself.</p>
        <p>Based around the great hall in the library's newly refurbished Jefferson building, the center -- which will be formally announced on Thursday -- is to set aside suites of offices and meeting rooms for the scholars and lawmakers. The hope is they will intermingle for whatever discussions they please about ideas large or small, pressing or serendipitous.</p>
        <p>''You can't legislate or buy depth but we're making some probes,'' said Dr. Billington, a 71-year-old historian and Russian specialist who diplomatically stressed that he has nothing against the capital city's hedgerows of think tanks and flocks of talking heads all now operating in the name of thoughtfulness.</p>
        <p>Still, he said, ''a deeper immersion'' and interplay between scholarly ideas and political curiosity is needed. ''There is already a great deal of applied intellect in this city, even if a lot of it is in lobbying and advocacy.''</p>
        <p>He vowed to reach out for scholars not usually associated with a Washington intellectual life top-heavy with economists and political scientists.</p>
        <p>The initial senior scholars are to be chosen within the next year, with the first Kluge prize for intellectual excellence likely in 2002. Those under consideration will be vetted from assorted disciplines by Dr. Billington and an advisory council of scholars led by his deputy at the library, Dr. Prosser Gifford.</p>
        <p>Dr. Billington declined to speculate on choices. But he said the standard would ideally be of the sort set by two scholars he had previously coaxed into serving the library briefly -- Vyacheslav Ivanov, the linguist and lecturer on semiotics, and the late philosopher Isaiah Berlin.</p>
        <p>The eight specialties to be covered by the senior chairs are broadly defined along the library's separate collections to include the culture and society of the Northern (advanced) and Southern (less developed) Hemispheres; technology's interaction with society; American law and governance; education; international relations; American history and ethics: and modern culture, including the library's formidable collections of music and films.</p>
        <p>''What we're trying to do is to make sure you get Greece into Rome,'' said Dr. Billington, the 13th librarian of Congress in the two century-history of the institution.</p>
        <p>''What's fascinating is that the link between learning and lawmaking was here from the beginning,'' he said, describing how the first joint committee was created by the founding Congress to run the library.</p>
        <p>Scholars have at least as much to gain in the untapped resources of the library as in the interaction with lawmakers, Dr. Billington said. He noted, for example, the thousands of unread copyrighted novels in the library's archive of more than 120 million items.</p>
        <p>''I tell my friends in academia that instead of deconstructing novels that everybody used to enjoy before you started writing about them, how about coming down and discovering the unpublished novels that nobody has read,'' he wryly added.</p>
        <p>''There is no magic bullet for interacting doers and thinkers,'' he conceded, but he expressed faith in the idea of simply bringing ''some of the scholars scattered all over the country directly into the library'' that members of Congress use -- ''people who already have a life of scholarly accomplishment but who might be capable of distilling some wisdom in roaming across the rich variety of things at the library.''</p>
        <p>Reviewing the institution's virtues, he cited its several hundred book cataloguers as rich foragers. ''They're my hidden heroes,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''It's going to be additive, it's going to be catalytic,'' Dr. Billington insisted. ''It's not a little empire, or a university or a new think tank.''</p>
        <p>''It's going to have an ever changing group of people,'' he added, with most of them staying for a year or so. ''It will work in that way America does things best -- not with a giant prefixed plan that you sit around and debate in the abstract, but by working on the human elements and hoping that things will jell.''</p>
