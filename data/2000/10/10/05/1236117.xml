      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>When two friends from Miami asked Pierre de Gastines, a Paris designer, to do a tableware collection inspired by Moroccan classics, Yzza (pronounced E-zah) was born. Mr. Gastines, born and raised in Morocco, created a modern yet timeless collection perfect for everyday use but special enough for a more formal setting. Among the pieces are a streamlined tagine cooker (large one shown, $135; small pair also shown, $35), plates decorated with a single Arabic letter (set of six, about $190) and simple vases with a Moorish cutout in slate blue, moss green, sand and taupe (large, $190, small $122). Vase and tagines are available at Barneys New York, and the entire line at Dean &amp; DeLuca. Wholesale, www.yzza.com.</p>
