        <p>Along Eighth Avenue in Brooklyn's Sunset Park, Hasidic Jews and Palestinian Muslims cross paths at every corner. Women with unmistakable Yiddish accents shop in Islamic markets, alongside Arabic women in head scarves. In the evenings, Jewish fathers pass Muslim fathers clutching the Koran, each on the way to pray to God or to Allah. A few return home to the same blocks.</p>
        <p>In Sunset Park, both sides say they have found peace, a refuge from the warring that has historically divided the Middle East. For years, Jews and Arabs have raised children here and taught them to believe that in Sunset Park it is possible for people of divergent beliefs to coexist.</p>
        <p>But now some residents are concerned that their neighborhood peace is in jeopardy. They worry that graffiti at a synagogue and a Jewish cemetery and two violent incidents this week in which Jews reported  attacks by people identifying themselves as Palestinian may be linked to the gun battles and rioting between Jews and Palestinians in the Middle East. So far, one of the attacks has been labeled a hate crime by the police.</p>
        <p>That case involved a 50-year-old Hasidic man who was slashed on Sunday, as he was strolling on Eighth Avenue in Sunset Park. The police say the attacker yelled during the attack that he was Palestinian and that his victim was a Jew.</p>
        <p>In the second incident, a Jewish man told the police that a man kicked him as he left the B train at the Fort Hamilton Parkway station. The police are investigating varying accounts of the incident, including one that the attacker was with a group waving a Palestinian flag.</p>
        <p>No arrests have been made in either case. The police said yesterday that they were investigating several other complaints of what could be bias crimes.</p>
        <p>Because of the attacks, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has ordered increased police patrols. At a meeting with 50 Jewish and Muslim leaders at City Hall yesterday, he said, ''Whatever is going on in the Middle East or in other parts of the world, people in New York have a right to have very strong feelings about it, very strong passions about it, but they have no right to harm anyone else.''</p>
        <p>Still, some people say they cannot shake the fear that hatred from another continent is threatening to turn neighbors here into enemies.</p>
        <p>Gadeer Abdullah, an 18-year-old Palestinian woman who lives two blocks from where the slashing occurred, said she was angry that such a violent act had happened so close to her home. And she has been equally angered by the number of detectives who have come knocking on her door and those of other Palestinians living in Sunset Park.</p>
        <p>''We're being singled out,'' Ms. Abdullah said as she and a cousin sat outside Halal Meats, a market frequented by Jews as well as by Arabs, on a recent evening. ''The police, they keep coming to our houses, asking us questions like we know what's going on, just because we're Palestinians. We lived our whole lives in this community together without hating. ''</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, when news came that a bus parked in front of a yeshiva on Ninth Avenue had been set on fire, some feared that their neighborhood had become the scene of yet another bias crime. However, the police said that they believed the bus had probably been set on fire by students from a rival yeshiva and that they were not investigating it as a hate crime.</p>
        <p>The police determination also confirmed Ms. Abdullah's concern. As she watched scores of people making  their way to the corner where the charred remains of the bus sat surrounded by police and television cameras, Ms. Abdullah feared that  ''they're only going to blame us.''</p>
        <p>For hours, Orthodox Jewish men, women and children gathered around the bus, which the police say was set on fire early Tuesday morning. Some people in the crowd looked to the arson attack as proof that the rumors were true, that Jews in Brooklyn were under attack.</p>
        <p>Across the street, others stared, too, but they said they were not ready to point fingers at neighbors who for years had done them no harm. ''I'm terrified for my husband to go out at night to pray and to study,'' said Suri, a young Hasidic mother who would give only her first name. ''We never had a problem with them before, especially not something like this,'' she said glancing at the bus. They have never let what happens over there  affect here. Everybody is civil.''</p>
        <p>Yaakov, a tall Hasidic man who works at the school and who also would not give his full name, agreed. ''We have lived very well together,'' he said in between answering questions from detectives. ''We have different beliefs, but we do business together; we say 'hello.' ''</p>
        <p>But for Ms. Abdullah and other Palestinians here, the rush to judgment surrounding the bus, and the identity of the slasher, makes it difficult to believe that Sunset Park is immune to hate. ''We're angry about what we're seeing on TV'' from the Middle East said Shafic Mansour, a young Palestinian man. ''That doesn't mean we're going to get crazy and go hurt people.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Abdullah added, ''Nobody likes what has happened, the slashing, the bus. But why is it so easy for so many of them to believe it's Palestinians, when we've never had anything between us. You don't know somebody is Palestinian or Arab just because they say they are,'' she said referring to the slashing case in which the attacker identified himself as Palestinian.</p>
        <p>Despite her frustrations and fears, Ms. Abdullah said she was determined not to judge her neighbors or abandon her love of shopping at National Liquidators, a Jewish-owned neighborhood wholesale store where she goes at least three times a week.</p>
        <p>Even as she keeps her own daily death count of the Palestinian victims in the Middle East and memorizes the faces she sees on TV, she  remembers where she lives.</p>
        <p>''This is not Israel,'' she said. ''We've got to respect each other. We live together. ''</p>
