        <p>'The Trouble With Normal'  ABC, Friday night at 8:30</p>
        <p>This is a lonely guy version of ''Friends,'' except it might have been more aptly titled ''Perceived Enemies.'' Four hapless single young men are somehow living on their own in Manhattan, trading weak one-liners and -- here's the concept -- acting paranoid.</p>
        <p>Why these not very cool but otherwise healthy-looking guys are so neurotic is not made clear in the debut episode. The answer must be New York, that well-known incubator of weirdos. It's also not clear why a paranoid New Yorker would routinely leave his apartment door unlocked and casually open it for anyone who knocks, as Bob does. But no matter.</p>

        <p>'The Trouble With Normal'  ABC, Friday night at 8:30</p>
        <p>This is a lonely guy version of ''Friends,'' except it might have been more aptly titled ''Perceived Enemies.'' Four hapless single young men are somehow living on their own in Manhattan, trading weak one-liners and -- here's the concept -- acting paranoid.</p>
        <p>Why these not very cool but otherwise healthy-looking guys are so neurotic is not made clear in the debut episode. The answer must be New York, that well-known incubator of weirdos. It's also not clear why a paranoid New Yorker would routinely leave his apartment door unlocked and casually open it for anyone who knocks, as Bob does. But no matter.</p>
        <p>We meet Bob (David Krumholtz) in turmoil. He thinks his high-strung next-door neighbor Zack (Jon Cryer) is spying on him. The joke is that Zack is spying, for his own paranoid reasons. Joining the high jinks is Bob's equally skittish chum Max (Brad Raider) -- who works, originally enough, in a surveillance-equipment store -- and Zack's befuddled sidekick Stansfield (Larry Joe Campbell), a portly mailman.</p>
        <p>The four eventually stumble into one another and become, yes, friends. Bob and Max then recruit Zack and Stansfield to join their therapy group -- this is New York, after all -- led by the rookie psychologist Claire (Paget Brewster), who tends to say the wrong things. Through all this Mr. Cryer and Mr. Campbell, alone among their peers, manage to display some comedic talent. They may need it soon for their next job.</p>
