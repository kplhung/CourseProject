        <p>Trying to send a message that widespread violence and corruption will no longer be tolerated in Indonesia, President Abdurrahman Wahid refused today to pardon the convicted son of Suharto, the former dictator, and ordered the arrest of the country's most notorious militia leader.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Wahid's actions could lead to further unrest. Violence and public disorder have erupted during past government efforts to bring the Suharto family and the militias to justice, underscoring the difficulty of this impoverished country's struggle to forge a democracy after decades of authoritarian rule.</p>
        <p>After returning from an overseas trip today, Mr. Wahid said he would not grant clemency to Mr. Suharto's son, Hutomo Mandala Putra, whom the Supreme Court has sentenced to 18 months in prison for his role in a multimillion-dollar land scam. Mr. Hutomo, who is known as Tommy Suharto, admitted his guilt on Tuesday and pleaded for a presidential pardon to avoid jail.</p>
        <p>The president replied, ''No,'' when asked by reporters if he would intervene on behalf of Mr. Hutomo, whom he has also accused of being behind recent bomb attacks in Jakarta that prosecutors said were intended to derail a separate corruption case against his father. Last week, a court ruled former President Suharto unfit to stand trial.</p>
        <p>It remains unclear whether or when the government plans to arrest Mr. Hutomo. His lawyers have asserted that he cannot be taken into custody until his request for clemency is formally processed. The lawyers said they planned to appeal the conviction. Prosecutors said on Tuesday that Mr. Hutomo would remain free in the interim, a decision that student groups have said is likely to result in violent protests.</p>
        <p>Under growing international pressure to stop the bloodshed in divided Timor, the police arrested Eurico Guterres, central leader of the pro-Indonesia militia groups that have caused havoc on the West Timor border. The police apprehended Mr. Guterres in a hotel in downtown Jakarta, but the authorities gave conflicting reasons for his arrest aside from the president's order.</p>
        <p>The national police chief, Gen. Suroyo Bimantoro, said Mr. Guterres had been arrested on weapons charges for instructing his followers not to surrender their guns during a recent government campaign to disarm the gangs. They are accused of having killed three United Nations workers in West Timor last month. The police said they had arrested two militia members in West Timor in connection with those killings and were pursuing four others.</p>
        <p>But the state news agency Antara quoted police officials as saying Mr. Guterres had been arrested for taking part in the destruction of an office of the United Nations high commissioner on refugees in the West Timor border town of Atambua on Sept. 6.</p>
        <p>The aid workers were killed in the rampage. The United States and the World Bank have warned Indonesia that it could lose vital aid if it did not disband the militias.</p>
        <p>''Eurico Guterres was arrested after there was enough evidence for him to become a suspect in the destruction and burning of the U.N.H.C.R. office in Atambua,'' said a police superintendent, Saleh Saaf, according to Antara. He did not say whether Mr. Guterres was a suspect in the United Nations killings, but the agency said he could face more than five years in jail for incitement.</p>
        <p>Early this week, Mr. Guterres warned that his followers would unleash a new wave of violence if he was arrested.</p>
