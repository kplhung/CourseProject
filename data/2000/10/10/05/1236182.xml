        <p>It is the Satur day evening news, and Aleksandr I.  Saliy  50-ish, stiff in a vaguely Soviet way, looking every bit the Parliament member and Tatarstan Communist Party boss that he is -- is reciting the shortcomings of President Vladimir V. Putin's cabinet. It is a television ritual, the sort of numbing boilerplate party bosses can deliver to a camera in their sleep.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Saliy is not sleeping. Rather, he is determinedly ignoring the one aspect of the interview that, clearly, is far beyond his capacity to ignore.</p>
        <p>It is the pleasant young woman with the microphone. As far as the camera shows -- and it shows a lot -- she isn't wearing a stitch.</p>
        <p>This is ''The Naked Truth,'' 13 minutes of usually sober and straight-faced newscasting delivered by young women who are either undressing, being undressed or already in the altogether.</p>
        <p>It is not so much must-see TV as can't-avert-your-eyes TV. Needless to say, scores of thousands of Muscovites either cannot or do not want to avert their eyes: ''The Naked Truth'' is a hit. And for better or worse, it has established channel M1, a little two-studio station that not so long ago was the broadcast equivalent of cold kasha, as the home of the offbeat and unexpected.</p>
        <p>The offbeat includes another news program, ''In Time,'' in which the newscasters wear clothes but describe the week's events with strings of double entendres, and yet another, ''Yellowness,'' which covers Moscow's robust collection of rumor-mongering newspapers. There also is a coming Larry King-style program, ''Natural Selection,'' whose title is a subtle giveaway to its theme.</p>
        <p>But more about that later.</p>
        <p>''We try to create alternative television,'' said Sergei L. Moskvin, the general director of M1's owner, Tele express, and the father of ''The Naked Truth.'' ''We use the tricks nobody else uses. When I came to this channel, they set their conditions and I set mine: they don't interfere with broadcast policy or personnel, and I don't ask them for money. Our ratings have doubled, and our revenue's tripled.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Moskvin, an expansive fellow with a gray pompadour, a ready laugh and an excellent tailor, worked in Moscow television for 21 years before taking over M1, then known by the less catchy name Channel 31, last year.</p>
        <p>Since then he has overhauled the 20-hour-a-day programming schedule in an attempt to set the station apart from its near-indistinguishable competitors. In that vein, ''The Naked Truth,'' whose title makes a play with the name of the old Communist Party daily, Pravda, or Truth, is a device to attract attention, not money: the show does not accept advertising.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Moskvin claims the station makes money anyway, a boast that, if true, would be a rare accomplishment. Russia's 1998 financial panic wiped out advertising; though Moscow now seems awash in billboards and commercials, experts say the industry has yet to recover.</p>
        <p>Clearly, money is coming from somewhere. Teleexpress's studios, in a tree-shaded office building just north of downtown, are endowed almost luxuriously with new control rooms, edge-of-the-envelope editing equipment and even robot cameras, whizzing along on little monorails suspended above the sets.</p>
        <p>According to the Gallup organization's television surveys, M1 is the sixth most popular of the city's 13 major television channels, with a strong audience among high school graduates and the 25-to-55 crowd. The station mostly broadcasts Russian-language movies aimed squarely at the average Muscovite.</p>
        <p>On its face, not to mention its other body parts, ''The Naked Truth'' is a one-trick pony. The 26-year-old anchor, a Ukrainian actress named Svetlana Pecotska, opens the newscast fully clothed, reading a report all but indistinguishable from the top reports on other major programs. By the close of the news segment, Ms. Pecotska is usually topless or nearly so; if she is not, the weather reporter is.</p>
        <p>(Bottomless reportage is forbidden. And when the main story involves Mr. Putin or another figure commanding national respect, full dress is in order.)</p>
        <p>But each time ''The Naked Truth'' also has a story line, albeit one fittingly brief for a 13-minute program. In one episode, Ms. Pecotska delivers the news while dancing an effusive tango with a curly-locked admirer. In another, she discovers a hole in her stocking, worries with it throughout the newscast, and concludes with both feet on the anchor desk.</p>
        <p>In still another, she plods obliviously through the week's events while a pair of hands undresses her from behind and ties a bow tie around her neck. And in a fourth, she plays a game of chess during the newscast -- fully clothed -- while the camera slowly pulls back to reveal a naked opponent.</p>
        <p>Mr. Moskvin, who replays these and other programs at the drop of a hat on a vast digital television screen in his office, makes no bones about the fact that sex sells. Government censorship -- so far, anyway -- is not a problem; racier programs are not uncommon on late-night Moscow television.</p>
        <p>He says he has heard no protests about the program from women -- ''maybe because of the climate in Russia, feminism does not breed here,'' he says -- although he once included a naked man in the newscast for equality's sake.</p>
        <p>But he does argue with a straight face that ''The Naked Truth'' is about more than sex -- that, in fact, it is a bold form of political satire.</p>
        <p>''Why does this program seem funny?'' he asked. ''The point is, if I turn off the video and leave only the sound, it's absolutely no different from any other news program anywhere -- in the U.S., in England, in Russia. If I turn off the sound and leave the video on, it's just an erotic program or a humor program.</p>
        <p>''But when it all goes together, it's an animal unknown to scientists -- a mixture of crocodile and motorbike.  And in fact this is not an erotic program at all. The idea here is that we are explaining to the viewer that he should not take the news seriously.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Moskvin said he conceived ''The Naked Truth'' in May 1999 as a practical joke on an unidentified friend, a pompous television reporter ''who considered himself the greatest TV newsman in the world.'' Not so, he says; television journalism is nothing but reading from the prompter -- which, as Ms. Pecotska proves, is as easy as putting on one's clothes.</p>
        <p>On the program's better days, the sexual content takes a backseat to other elements.</p>
        <p>For suspense and roll-on-the-floor laughter, for example, there is little on any television screen to match the head of Russia's far-left Agrarian Party discussing land reform, his interviewer intently serious and jaybird-naked, the politician trying his hysterical best to focus on some imaginary point in a far corner of his office.</p>
        <p>Mr. Moskvin says he is looking forward to the fall television season, which coincides with the return to Moscow of Russian members of Parliament. ''It's quite easy to persuade them to appear,'' he said, ''because the program is so popular.''</p>
        <p>But M1 has no plans to stop its sendup of self-important television there. The station's next show -- and in Mr. Moskvin's mind, its funniest -- is ''Natural Selection,'' a talk program lifted straight from American television. Its King-like, Leno-esque host, John dePalma, will tackle everything from politics to love to Western philosophy with a range of star guests.</p>
        <p>The catch this time is that John dePalma -- literally, John from the palms -- is a chimpanzee. ''This,' Mr. Moskvin said, ''is going to be more popular than 'Naked Truth.' ''</p>
