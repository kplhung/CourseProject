        <p>This 30-second commercial, titled ''Ain't Buying It,'' is the first released by Representative Bob Franks, a Republican of New Jersey, in his campaign for the Senate against Jon S. Corzine. It began running yesterday on television stations in Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>PRODUCER -- Smith &amp; Harroff</p>
        <p>ON THE SCREEN -- The ad opens with a view of Mr. Corzine, frozen so that he seems to be smiling rather goofily. Alongside, in a split screen, slogans scream, tabloid-style: ''$60 million to buy your vote'' and ''Corzine can't afford the truth.'' The ad shifts to a series of newspaper articles and editorials, with such headlines as ''Corzine's phony alibi on his tax returns,'' ''Corzine donated to powerful groups,'' and ''Jon Corzine's secret.'' Over another picture of Mr. Corzine, his eyes downcast, snippets of editorials flash -- including one titled ''Untrustworthy'' -- amplified by visual and sound effects. When the narrator gets to Mr. Corzine's response, he is shown stiffly high-fiving a supporter during a game of pool and is heard whooping happily. But in this context, the clip, taken from a Corzine ad, insinuates that Mr. Corzine could not care less about the criticism and is even celebrating his ability to ignore it.</p>
        <p>THE SCRIPT -- Narrator: ''He's spending 60 million bucks to buy New Jersey's Senate seat, but Corzine can't afford the truth. Refusing to disclose his tax returns. Paying $100,000 to groups that later endorsed him and trying to hide it. 'Strange behavior,' says The New York Times. 'A pattern of deception,' says The Courier-Post. 'Untrustworthy,' says The Trentonian. Corzine's response: Negative ads distorting Congressman Franks's record. Just more deception. Spend all you want, Jon. But New Jersey ain't buying it.''</p>
        <p>ACCURACY -- Mr. Corzine spent $35 million in the Democratic primary, and by late last month he had nearly reached the $50 million mark, including commitments for television commercials through Election Day. It is possible, but unlikely, that he will reach $60 million. Mr. Corzine says he would like to release his tax returns but is prevented from doing so by a confidentiality agreement with Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company, his former employer. He also notes that he has revealed his financial assets and sources of income, as required by law.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine tried for months to avoid disclosing his gifts to charities before buckling under pressure from Mr. Franks in September, when he revealed that he had donated more than $100,000 to groups whose leaders or sponsors later endorsed him. Newspaper editorial headlines are cited accurately.</p>
        <p>SCORECARD -- Mr. Franks earns points for mockery in this ad, which adheres to the maxim that the best defense is a good offense. It highlights some of Mr. Corzine's worst moments. But it is unlikely many voters will see the ad; it is running only in the Philadelphia media market, which reaches just the southern third of New Jersey. More important, the ad shows that with the little money he now has, Mr. Franks has elected to attack Mr. Corzine rather than promote himself to voters who know little about him. Surveys show that most voters are more interested in candidates' fiscal policies and social programs than in their finances.</p>
