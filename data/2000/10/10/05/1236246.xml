        <p>The bid to drive an electric car from Hawthorne, N.Y., to Detroit without recharging to show off the capabilities of its novel zinc-air power system, ended Monday evening in central Pennsylvania. Evonyx, the technology company that cobbled together the car, ended the attempt when night-driving conditions became hazardous as its vehicle was averaging just 45 miles an hour on the heavily traveled Interstate 80. The company said that data collected from the 1,075 fuel cells on board suggested that it could have reached its goal even though more than 300 of the cells did not work properly. A tandem car quit earlier with mechanical problems unrelated to the power system.</p>
