        <p>For all the buildup of the first presidential debate as a make-or-break moment for Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore, Republicans and Democrats alike conceded today that the overall dynamics of the race did not seem to have changed.</p>

        <p>For all the buildup of the first presidential debate as a make-or-break moment for Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore, Republicans and Democrats alike conceded today that the overall dynamics of the race did not seem to have changed.</p>
        <p>In fact, the encounter on Tuesday night at the University of Massachusetts campus here did not captivate the American public in the way some politicians had predicted. The viewership was estimated at more than 46 million people, on a par with the number who tuned in for the first debate between President Clinton and Bob Dole four years ago, an event that generated far less drama, given Mr. Clinton's lopsided advantage in the polls.</p>
        <p>Today, it was hard to find an abiding sense of enthusiasm in the Gore or Bush camps -- in some cases it was more a sense of relief -- even as top officials on both sides said their candidates had met their basic objectives in the 90-minute encounter.</p>
        <p>Even the Democratic Party's chief cheerleader, Edward G. Rendell, the general chairman, declined to give his candidate the most stellar marks, saying, ''I think Al Gore gets a B plus and George Bush gets a C plus.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rendell said his party's nominee, for all his fine qualities, lacked the demeanor to close the deal with the American public in a single evening. ''Had Al Gore gone up there and convinced people that he was Bob Newhart, maybe he would have scored a knockout,'' he said. ''But Al Gore's not a Bob Newhart. That's not going to happen.''</p>
        <p>Many lawmakers, governors and strategists in both parties were unusually measured, saying that neither man had put in a performance compelling enough to force many voters to immediately reconsider whom they would support. Such admissions are rare; the tradition after presidential debates is for operatives to rush out of the auditorium to declare that their candidate ''won.''</p>
        <p>Instead, many operatives said it might not be until the third and final presidential debate on Oct. 17 that the views of the candidates among undecided voters would finally begin to sink in.</p>
        <p>''The worst George Bush did was tie,'' said Gov. Tommy G. Thompson of Wisconsin. ''But even a tie is good for George Bush.''</p>
        <p>Karen P. Hughes, Mr. Bush's communications director and one of his top advisers, said: ''My feeling is it will take some time. People know that other debates are coming, so they may be reluctant to seal their decision yet.''</p>
        <p>William M. Daley, Mr. Gore's campaign chairman, put it this way: ''One of these is not going to be determinative. These are not knockout punches.''</p>
        <p>Operatives in both camps said that today they began recalculating some of their decisions about priorities and resources in the wake of the debate. Advisers to Mr. Bush, for instance, said they were comfortable enough with the outcome of the debate that they had decided to funnel additional resources into more states, like California, that are leaning toward Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>Had Mr. Bush's performance been a disaster, they said, the campaign might have been more targeted in spending money only in the most crucial battlegrounds.</p>
        <p>Even as neither side claimed a triumph, Democrats and Republicans asserted that they had accomplished many objectives in the debate. Advisers to Mr. Bush said they believed that by standing side-by-side with Mr. Gore, Mr. Bush had put to rest nagging questions about whether he had a sufficient grasp of issues so he could hold his own against the vice president, a seasoned debater.</p>
        <p>''People wanted reassurance,'' said Karl Rove, Mr. Bush's top strategist. He added, ''The first and most important thing was for Bush to share with people a substantive agenda that was bold and optimistic. The second was to demonstrate that he understood the leadership requirements of the office. And there was a need to show that he had substance and detail in his plans.''</p>
        <p>Backers of Mr. Gore, meanwhile, said they believed he had succeeded in resisting falling into bitter denunciations of Mr. Bush's record. They also said he had demonstrated that his stands on major issues, from health care to taxes, were more in line with those of most Americans.</p>
        <p>Mr. Daley said Mr. Gore had conveyed this image to the public: ''I'm a serious guy who takes this stuff seriously. And I know what I'm talking about.'' He said he might have hoped -- but never expected -- Mr. Bush would have performed so badly that the race would essentially have ended on Tuesday night. ''You can hope that the guy would fall off the podium,'' Mr. Daley said of Mr. Bush, ''but that's not going to happen.''</p>
        <p>Before the debate, Mr. Daley said, he had reminded Mr. Gore to stay upbeat. He said his worst-case scenario would have been if Mr. Bush had goaded the vice president into sounding mean and struggling to defend the administration's ethics.</p>
        <p>''I told him, 'Stay positive, don't take the bait of a negative attack,' '' Mr. Daley said. ''He clearly didn't and that helps him with the independents. They don't buy that.'' He said he had feared that Mr. Bush would ''really try to trash and bait Gore into going back at him on the political stuff and Clinton.''</p>
        <p>Senator Sam Brownback, a Kansas Republican, said Mr. Bush's performance halted ''the questions about the stature'' of the governor compared with Mr. Gore. He acknowledged he had worried that Mr. Bush could have stumbled or done something to damage his prospects.</p>
        <p>Recalling President Gerald R. Ford's incorrect comment in a debate in 1976 that Poland was not under Soviet domination, he said, ''Everybody fears some sort of statement that dominates the news that's not true like what Gerald Ford said.''</p>
        <p>Many Democrats, and even some Republicans, said Mr. Gore held a slight advantage because several polls showed him a few points ahead, though in most cases the lead was statistically insignificant. He also enjoys the benefits of being the incumbent vice president, and having issue positions that, polls show, are generally more popular than Mr. Bush's.</p>
        <p>''I really believe that with the economy -- which obviously isn't going to suffer enough to change this election -- it's a very tough race for Governor Bush to face,'' said former Senator Warren B. Rudman, a New Hampshire Republican who backed Senator John McCain in the primaries. ''I don't know what he can do. He's a naturally friendly guy, but he's not a person who lifts people like a John Kennedy or a Ronald Reagan or, on occasion, a Bill Clinton.''</p>
