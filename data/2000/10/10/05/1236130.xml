        <p>ONE day last week, I went undercover. Parking inconspicuously in front of the Minimally Invasive Surgery Center in my town, I slouched behind the wheel and surveyed the action unfolding across the street. I wished I had worn dark glasses. I wished I had stopped at Starbuck's to get a cup of hot joe.</p>
        <p>I was on a stakeout. My mission? Checking out rival gas stations to compare prices. I began this covert operation -- which, by the way, lasted about 30 seconds before I got bored and went home without even bothering to drive past that Mobil station by the park -- because despite the gasoline crisis, I hadn't really been paying attention to prices in my neighborhood.</p>

        <p>ONE day last week, I went undercover. Parking inconspicuously in front of the Minimally Invasive Surgery Center in my town, I slouched behind the wheel and surveyed the action unfolding across the street. I wished I had worn dark glasses. I wished I had stopped at Starbuck's to get a cup of hot joe.</p>
        <p>I was on a stakeout. My mission? Checking out rival gas stations to compare prices. I began this covert operation -- which, by the way, lasted about 30 seconds before I got bored and went home without even bothering to drive past that Mobil station by the park -- because despite the gasoline crisis, I hadn't really been paying attention to prices in my neighborhood.</p>
        <p>You might wonder what would prompt a person extravagant enough to routinely fill up at a full-service pump to start pinching pennies at this late date. Although I barely noticed the 23 percent increase in gas prices over the past year, I knew I had to check for myself after I visited Priceline's new gasoline service, where the claim on the home page sounded too good to be true: ''Save up to 10 to 20 cents per gallon!'' Priceline bankrolls the savings by charging some of its 50,000 participating gas stations for referrals and also charges sponsor fees on its Internet site.</p>
        <p>Of course, since the company's grocery service had routinely saved me between 30 percent and 50 percent at the supermarket over the past nine months, I had no real reason to doubt that Priceline could deliver cheap gas, as well. On the other hand, there's no international shortage of canned goods that I know of, and OPEC hasn't been going around accusing Europe of raiding its reserves of salted crackers, has it?</p>
        <p>So far about one million customers have used Priceline to purchase gasoline since the service was rolled out in 46 continental states last summer (the company is awaiting state approval in New Jersey and Missouri). The average saving, according to Priceline, has been 12 cents a gallon.</p>
        <p>According to my calculations, that would total about $1.80 per tank. Although I appreciate that Priceline is trying to save me money that I didn't even know I was losing, somehow I couldn't see myself thinking far enough ahead to log onto my computer every time I needed gas. I usually don't think about it until a little icon lights up on the dashboard.</p>
        <p>''You are in the minority,'' Scott Case, the company's president, told me. ''Most of America wants to save on every gallon because gasoline represents a large portion of their budget, but they don't get any pleasure out of using it. Commuting is not pleasurable, and on top of it, you have to show up at a gas station where the prices seem like they're always going up.''</p>
        <p>If you have used Priceline to buy groceries, the gas service will seem very familiar, both in its inconvenience and in its ability to save you money. Here's how it works. First, I specified a grade of gasoline (I chose premium, which Priceline defined as 91 to 93 octane) and an amount (in increments of 10 gallons up to 50 gallons in a two-week period) to purchase.</p>
        <p>Then I entered my ZIP code and got a list of nearby participating stations. I had to choose at least three where I would be willing to get gasoline. The list of 18 included nearby Exxon, Sunoco and Mobil stations. I chose three near my house.</p>
        <p>Next, Priceline informed me that the average price in my ZIP code area was $1.83 a gallon for premium gas and asked me to give a price I was willing to pay.</p>
        <p>Could I trust Priceline's assessment of local prices? That's when I went sleuthing and learned that premium prices at two nearby stations actually averaged $1.849 per gallon.</p>
        <p>Back home, I bid $1.66 on a proposed purchase of 20 gallons (which would save me $3.78 at the pump). But Priceline told me within about 15 seconds that my price was not accepted and informed me I could try again in 24 hours.</p>
        <p>Instead I waited 24 seconds (based on my experience with the grocery service, I suspected Priceline would allow me to bend a few minor rules), then tried again. This time, I bid $1.71 for 20 gallons. ''Congratulations! Your price was accepted!'' the site told me, then informed me that I should use a Priceline gasoline card.</p>
        <p>Which brings me to the biggest annoyance: before redeeming your purchase, you must wait up to 10 days for that Priceline card to arrive in the mail. It's a Catch-22: you can't apply for the card until you successfully bid. But Priceline charges your credit card for that purchase immediately.</p>
        <p>After purchasing gas you have up to 90 days to pump it, and the card will keep track of how many gallons remain uncollected (no refunds, though, so redeem every drop). After Priceline sent me a card via overnight mail so I could test the service, I also applied the typical way for another card, which arrived in two days.</p>
        <p>Luckily, when I went to get my gas a few hours later, the attendant was more familiar with the procedure than I was. (Priceline requires you to pump your own unless, like me, you live in a town that mandates full-service pumps.) Before swiping the card to pay, he showed me where the six-digit PIN was on the receipt I had printed out. The pump receipt listed the pump price, but both the attendant and Priceline officials assured me my credit card had been charged only the amount I bid.</p>
        <p>If you were to buy the maximum 50 gallons every 14 days, the savings would be worth it. A bulk purchase would also mitigate the inconvenience of having to log onto your computer before you buy something as mundane as gas. Also, if the credit on your Priceline card gets low, don't worry; Priceline allows you to pump an additional five gallons at the same purchase price.</p>
        <p>But keep track because if you cheat, either by buying a higher grade of gas than you specified or getting too many gallons, the company will charge you a $1.50 service fee. That I would notice.</p>
