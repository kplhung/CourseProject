        <p>If you have not yet been swept up in the digital music explosion, either by choice or indifference, you pose a tempting target for an increasing group of companies determined to develop devices that will make you forget all about your old stereo system.</p>
        <p>One of the latest variations on the theme is DigMedia's new MusicStore, a tabletop digital audio jukebox. Designed to be self-contained, MusicStore plays CD's on a built-in drive and delivers the sound through headphones.</p>
        <p>The device can also copy music from CD's into MP3 audio files and store them (about 200 CD's at FM quality) on its 5.4-gigabyte internal hard drive. It costs about $500, measures 12.8 inches by 6.5 inches by 2 inches and weighs 2.6 pounds.</p>
        <p>In a novel development, the device comes with a companion portable MP3 player, called a SoulMate, that fits into a slot to pick up music files. The player weighs 3.5 ounces and is a dead ringer for a fancy cellular telephone.</p>
        <p>The SoulMate, which can store less than an hour's worth of near-CD-quality music in its 48-megabyte memory, sells separately for about $100.</p>
        <p>When the MusicStore is linked with included stereo cables to a standard amplifier of a home stereo system, it can play its digital music files through speakers.</p>
        <p>The device may also be linked, by way of a U.S.B. line, to a personal computer so MP3 audio files on the PC's hard drive may be moved in and out of its memory.</p>
        <p>The MusicStore comes with installation and music management software and a few preloaded tracks.</p>
