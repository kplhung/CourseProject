        <p>ON WRITING  Memoir of the Craft  By Stephen King  288 pages. Scribner. $25.</p>
        <p>When Stephen King summons his early years in his new memoir, he recalls being teased by a flatulent, 200-pound ''Misery''-prototype baby sitter and horribly tormented by the doctor who drained his infected ear. He describes the ''dirt-floored, rock-walled, spider-infested'' basement from which he and his brother Dave put out a homemade newspaper. He describes the formative experience of working at a laundry that served a seafood restaurant, where the dirty table linens ''stank to high heaven and were often boiling with maggots.''</p>
        <p>In other words, developing a best-selling ghoulish imagination was not a stretch for him. He lived in a Stephen King world long before the Stephen King writing style was born. And when he began to describe that world in print, he inevitably met the teacher who told him: ''What I don't understand, Stevie, is why you'd write junk like this in the first place. You're talented. Why do you want to waste your abilities?'' Somewhere that teacher must be wondering whether having the last laugh is such an empty cliche after all.</p>
        <p>Now it's Mr. King's turn to give instruction. And his warmly conversational book about literary craftsmanship should interest even those who find something oxymoronic in its conception. As someone who describes the authorial brainstorm of setting off a bomb in ''The Stand'' because the story was becoming overpopulated, he may not be the most noble of stylists, but there's no denying that he knows how to make a story fly.</p>
        <p>So he takes a helpful, nuts-and-bolts approach to the budding writer's basic concerns while giving them a King-like spin. ''The dictum in writing classes used to be 'write what you know,' '' he notes. ''Which sounds good, but what if you want to write about starships exploring other planets or a man who murders his wife and then tries to dispose of her body with a wood-chipper?''</p>
        <p>Well, first things first. In the commonsensical tone of a man who is often asked how to write 30-odd hugely popular books, create a one-man Internet publishing revolution and become Hollywood's favorite literary brand name, Mr. King advocates some valuable basics. He recommends reading lots of books if you expect to write one, for instance, and making sure your work space is television- and video-game-free. He advocates a structured work day, and says that he sometimes finds himself ''perky as a rat in liverwurst'' when the day's writing comes more easily than expected.</p>
        <p>As someone who clearly loves books (and who reveals astute, varied tastes in a recommended reading list), Mr. King advocates an autodidactic approach over the communal experience of writing classes. ''It is, after all, the dab of grit that seeps into an oyster's shell that makes the pearl,'' he writes, ''not pearl-making seminars with other oysters.''</p>
        <p>As both devoted reader and literary practitioner, Mr. King has pet peeves worth appreciating. He passionately hates adverbs, which means that ''He hates adverbs'' would be a better way of saying so. Ditto for loathing passive constructions in place of active ones, in a point that he makes with typical no-nonsense bluntness. ''I think unsure writers also feel the passive voice somehow lends their work authority, perhaps even a quality of majesty,'' he says. (He also prefers a simple ''says'' or ''said'' to fancier forms of dialogue attribution.) ''If you find instruction manuals and lawyers' torts instructive, I guess it does.''</p>
        <p>In the arena of storytelling he argues for interesting situations rather than ironclad plotting. (''Plot is, I think, the good writer's last resort and the dullard's first choice.'') And ''On Writing'' is liberally illustrated with examples from the author's own work, as in the ''what if'' premises from which his stories have grown.  (What if ''vampires invaded a small New England village?'' That's ''Salem's Lot.'' Or ''a young mother and her son became trapped in their stalled car by a rabid dog?'' That's ''Cujo.'')</p>
        <p>Most important for the fledgling fiction writer he recommends not trying to imitate the popular formulas perfected by anybody else. ''You can't aim a book like a cruise missile,'' he maintains, warning his readers ''not to commit intellectual dishonesty in the hunt for the buck.''</p>
        <p>''On Writing'' began as a compendium of tips like these, in a tone suitable for lecture circuit or Internet discussion. It also included a sharp, pungent account of Mr. King's growing up, finding a soul mate named Tabitha, going through a rocky phase that involved taking drugs and drinking mouthwash, and eventually discovering his professional destiny. Then, through an outrageous twist of fate, it became something more.</p>
        <p>He writes in the book's final section about being hit by a runaway van while walking along a Maine road, of waking up to hear the driver say he was heading for ''some of those Marzes-bars they have up to the store,'' and of having the grotesque idea that he had nearly been killed by one of his own characters.</p>
        <p>Monstrous as it was, that event turned ''On Writing'' into a much stronger, more meaningful book than it might have been. Halfway through this project, when he was hurt, Mr. King incorporated his revivifying return to work into this book's narrative in ways that will make readers realize just how vital it has been for him. And the accident is eloquently described here, as a sterling illustration of all the writing guidelines that have come before. For once, less is more in Mr. King's storytelling, and the horror needs no help from his imagination.</p>
        <p>''There have been times when for me the act of writing has been a little act of faith, a spit in the eye of the despair,'' he writes. In the end, with unexpected intimacy and dignity, ''On Writing'' becomes the essence of those times.</p>
