        <p>At a major bridge tournament the journalists usually concentrate on the players who are in contention for the title. That was not entirely true at the Transnational Mixed Teams played last month at the World Championships in Maastricht, the Netherlands.</p>

        <p>At a major bridge tournament the journalists usually concentrate on the players who are in contention for the title. That was not entirely true at the Transnational Mixed Teams played last month at the World Championships in Maastricht, the Netherlands.</p>
        <p>The winners in the field of 68 teams were Jill Meyers, Irina Levitina, Sam Lev, John Mohan, all of the United States, Migry Tzur-Campanile of Israel and Piotr Gawrys of Poland.</p>
        <p>But there was also great interest in a fourth-round match between two teams that had no expectations and finished in the bottom half of the standings. One was a foursome from Israel: Lilo and Matilda Poplilov, both of Tel Aviv; Doron Yadlin of Petah Tikva; and Ruth Levit of Givatayim. The other consisted of six Palestinian players: Dr. Alfred Toubasi of Ramallah; Adnan Shakhshir of Nablus; Raja Hamarneh of Bethlehem; and Shukri Laurence, Aida Dajani and Badira Ibses, all of East Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>It is believed that this was the first head-to-head meeting in any peaceful competitive activity by Israeli and Palestinian teams. Dr. Toubasi is the president of the Palestine Bridge Federation, which was founded in 1995 and has 100 members. The Israeli players have invited the Palestinians to take part in two tournaments, in Eilat in November and in Tel Aviv in February. Whether they will accept is not known.</p>
        <p>In the wider world Israelis and Palestinians seldom agree about anything. But in the microcosm of the bridge table they were in total agreement about how the diagramed deal should be bid. Both North players opened one club, and both East players contributed a pre-emptive jump in diamonds. South bid his hearts, West put on some pressure with a jump to five diamonds, and South hit the target with a jump to six hearts. This was easily made, with the club ace the only loser, for a score of 980.</p>
        <p>At any other vulnerability, East-West would surely have saved in seven diamonds. But it would have been right here, even in the teeth of the vulnerability. After the best lead of a club against seven diamonds doubled, the defense would take three tricks and collect 800. And with any other lead the declarer would be able to work on spades. Eventually he would establish the fifth spade in the West hand, use it to dispose of a club loser, and hold the penalty to 500. So a really bold East-West pair, willing to go to the seven level, would have gained 5 imps or 10 imps depending on the opening lead.</p>
