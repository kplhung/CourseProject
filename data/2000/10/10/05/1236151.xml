        <p>So far, wearable computing has been for the highly technical and the very strange. But Inviso, a company with headquarters in Sunnyvale, Calif., would like to change that with eShades, a head-mounted computer display device that looks like a pair of oversize sunglasses.</p>

        <p>So far, wearable computing has been for the highly technical and the very strange. But Inviso, a company with headquarters in Sunnyvale, Calif., would like to change that with eShades, a head-mounted computer display device that looks like a pair of oversize sunglasses.</p>
        <p>When attached to a laptop, the eShades device makes it possible to view documents or Web pages at what appears to be full size.</p>
        <p>The glasses use a technology called Liquid Crystal on Silicon. Liquid crystal is injected under a glass pane that is placed over a silicon chip. The result is a flat-panel display on the computer chip itself.</p>
        <p>When viewed with the optics in the eShades, the display has the appearance of a 19-inch monitor seen from a distance of two and a half feet. But the resolution, 800 by 600 pixels, is closer to what you might find on a 15-inch conventional monitor.</p>
        <p>The company expects to have the glasses available early next year at a price between $550 and $600. They are aimed at mobile professionals who value their privacy while working. It will also appeal to those who value battery life: Inviso says the eShades will use only about a quarter of the power of conventional laptop displays.</p>
