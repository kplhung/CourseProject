        <p>On one side of the bay, the Yankees finally got back on track with a 4-0 victory in Oakland to even their playoff series, 1-1. On the other side, the Mets never got untracked and lost their opener in San Francisco, 5-1.</p>
        <p>Behind strong pitching from Andy Pettitte, the Yankees ended a losing streak that had spanned the last seven games of the regular season and the first game of the postseason. Glenallen Hill, the designated hitter, broke a scoreless tie in the sixth.</p>
        <p>Orlando Hernandez will pitch Game 3 tomorrow night at Yankee Stadium against the ace of the Oakland staff, Tim Hudson.</p>

        <p>Orlando Hernandez will pitch Game 3 tomorrow night at Yankee Stadium against the ace of the Oakland staff, Tim Hudson.</p>
        <p>Orlando's brother, Livan Hernandez, improved to 5-0 in his postseason career in beating the Mets. Barry Bonds added a triple and a single. On the triple, the Mets' Derek Bell was injured and will probably miss Game 2 tonight.</p>
        <p>In Chicago, the Mariners again shut down the White Sox, 5-2, and sent the three-of-five series to Seattle with the Mariners up by 2-0.</p>
