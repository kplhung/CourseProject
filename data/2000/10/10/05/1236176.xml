        <p>Bond prices were mixed yesterday, a day after the Federal Reserve left short-term interest rates unchanged but reaffirmed its belief that low unemployment and high oil prices could lead to higher inflation.</p>
        <p>Despite a modest decline in the price of crude oil yesterday, bond trading was quiet, punctuated by a small improvement in longer-maturity issues. A Commerce Department report showing a 2 percent rise in August factory orders, slightly above expectations, had little effect on Treasuries.</p>
        <p>The price of the closely followed 10-year Treasury note fell 6/32, to 99, while its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 5.88 percent from 5.86 percent on Tuesday. The 30-year bond rose 1/32, to 104 11/32. Its yield was unchanged at 5.94 percent.</p>
        <p>With the Fed in the role of observer at this point, some market participants think that any substantial movements in the next few weeks could come in reaction to energy or stock prices.</p>
        <p>''The bond market's inability to rally significantly in the face of the stock market's sell-off on Tuesday indicates that it doesn't have the potential to move higher at this point,'' said Robert Pugliese, senior vice president and fixed-income director at J. W. Genesis Financial in Boca Raton, Fla. ''It will take a major catalyst to get things going, a sharp directional change in the stock market or oil prices.''</p>
        <p>The Fed's rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee said on Tuesday that rising energy prices posed a risk of higher inflation and that it continued to be concerned that the use of available workers remained unusually high. The job situation will become clearer tomorrow with the Labor Department's employment report for September.</p>
        <p>''The Fed is still quite sensitive to the inflationary potential of a vibrant economy with an unemployment rate hovering near 4 percent,'' said Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Fleming Asset Management, ''but the F.O.M.C. will stand pat and remain on hold for an extended period of time unless economic growth shifts direction sharply and/or inflationary pressures become truly threatening, neither of which appear to be on the radar screen at the moment.''</p>
        <p>''But since the degree of moderation in economic growth is still an open question at this juncture,'' he continued, ''the bond market seems to be anxiously lying in wait in anticipation of Friday's labor market report for September, from which to take its directional cues.''</p>
        <p>Forecasts on the report vary widely, Mr. Fine noted, and after adjusting for workers returning from a strike against Verizon Communications and a reduction in temporary census workers, the predicted range runs from a tepid rise of 130,000 to a strong gain of 325,000. Projections for unemployment range from 4 percent to 4.2 percent.</p>
        <p>Elsewhere, a week after a revision to correct an error in the Consumer Price Index cast a pall over the Treasury's inflation-protected securities program, officials announced yesterday that they planned to sell $5 billion of reopened inflation-indexed 30-year bonds next Wednesday.</p>
