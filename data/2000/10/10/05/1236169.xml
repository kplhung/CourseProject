        <p>Editorial, citing bipartisan support of nation's governors for five-year reauthorization of Americorps, Pres Clinton's signature national service program, urges Congress to reject cuts to Americorps's budget proposed by Senate and reauthorize program</p>
      </abstract>
    </body.head>
    <body.content>
      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>In an extraordinary outpouring of bipartisan support, 49 of the nation's governors -- including George W. Bush of Texas and his brother Jeb Bush of Florida -- sent a joint letter to Congress last month calling on lawmakers to approve a five-year reauthorization of Americorps, President Clinton's signature national service program. The letter was a well-deserved tribute to the program's approximately 40,000 volunteers, who receive a $4,725 educational stipend in exchange for an intensive year performing valuable work like cleaning up dilapidated parks, tutoring at-risk children and helping communities to recover from natural disasters.</p>
        <p>The presence of so many Republican signatories conveys a message that the Republicans who run the House and Senate would be out of step with the mainstream of their own party if they did not support this program. They should resist the cuts to Americorps's budget proposed by the Senate and should ensure the program's future by passing a formal reauthorization measure.</p>

        <p>''We do not want to lose this force for good in our communities, states, and country,'' said the governors in their letter. Neither should Congress.</p>
