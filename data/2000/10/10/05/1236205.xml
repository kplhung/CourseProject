        <p>Trailing in the polls and struggling to raise money, Representative Bob Franks, the Republican candidate for United States Senate, began running his first television commercial today after a month in which his wealthy Democratic rival, Jon S. Corzine, had the medium all to himself.</p>
        <p>The commercial says nothing about Mr. Franks, who for the most part remains unknown to New Jersey voters. Instead, it attacks Mr. Corzine by using the harsh language of a number of recent newspaper editorials, calling him untrustworthy and deceptive.</p>
        <p>Few voters will see the commercial, however. The Franks campaign could afford only a one-week commitment of $250,000 to place the commercial on Philadelphia stations, so it will not be seen often, and even then in only about a third of New Jersey households.</p>
        <p>By contrast, Mr. Corzine is spending $1.2 million each week for television commercials that are blanketing the state, in both the New York and Philadelphia markets.</p>
        <p>Mr. Franks's aides declined to say whether they would keep the advertisement on the air after the first week. A spokesman, Peter DeMarco, said the campaign would reassess its position then. Experts say candidates usually do not stop advertising on television once they have started, for fear of losing whatever gains they have made.</p>
        <p>One Republican official confirmed today that the Franks campaign hoped the commercial would demonstrate to potential contributors that Mr. Franks was determined to win the campaign and had a strategy for doing so, and therefore would be a worthwhile investment despite Mr. Corzine's ability to spend so much.</p>
        <p>Perhaps for the same reason, the Franks campaign released its own poll on Friday showing him neck and neck with Mr. Corzine; on Monday, The Record of Hackensack published an independent survey that put Mr. Corzine ahead by 14 points.</p>
        <p>In fact, Mr. Corzine appears to be widening his lead. The Quinnipiac University Polling Institute, which said he had an 8-point lead in August, released a new survey today that showed him with a 14-point advantage, among both registered and likely voters.</p>
        <p>In the Quinnipiac poll, Mr. Corzine shows a huge advantage among women likely to vote, 52 percent to 28 percent. And while Mr. Corzine leads among Democrats, 80 percent to 7 percent, he is also supported by 18 percent of Republicans. Mr. Franks shows some strength; among independents, he leads 39 to 38. The survey of 1,045 registered voters, with a margin of sampling error of three percentage points, was conducted from Sept. 26 to Oct. 1.</p>
        <p>Cliff Zukin, director of The Star-Ledger/Eagleton-Rutgers Poll, said Mr. Franks was wise to try to reach independent and unaffiliated voters, who make up three-fifths of the New Jersey electorate, by attacking Mr. Corzine rather than by advancing his own positions. He noted that Mr. Corzine still had not surpassed 50 percent in any of the independent horse-race polls.</p>
        <p>Mr. Franks need not worry about getting Republican votes and can essentially write off gaining Democratic support, Mr. Zukin said. ''So the battle is going to be for swing voters in the middle. And since we know from our own polling that 31 percent of all voters are uncomfortable with Corzine's spending, being turned off about the money may well reach those swing voters.''</p>
        <p>Tom Shea, a spokesman for Mr. Corzine, said the commercial was deceptive when it said Mr. Corzine would spend $60 million by Election Day. ''They're using numbers that they can't document,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Charlie Smith, Mr. Franks's campaign spokesman, said it was an ''educated estimate'' based on Mr. Corzine's prior spending reports.</p>
        <p>Mr. Shea added that Mr. Franks, and a Republican supporter who placed a strikingly similar commercial Tuesday, were ignoring polls showing that New Jerseyans had little interest in Mr. Corzine's finances. ''Bob Franks and his attack dogs are barking up the wrong tree,'' Mr. Shea said. ''It's just not what the voters want to hear about.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Smith retorted that the Corzine campaign seemed ''panicked,'' adding: ''It's close. They've got a problem. They still can't get over 50 percent'' in the horse-race polls, known as ballot tests.</p>
        <p>''I could take $50 million,'' Mr. Smith added, ''and get my shoe over 50 percent in a ballot test.''</p>
