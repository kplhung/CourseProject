        <p>The Passion Play here, depicting the last hours and resurrection of Jesus, has been delighting Christian believers and incurring increasing controversy over its anti-Semitism, however grudgingly modified in recent decades, for nearly 400 years. But this year's installment, which began on May 21 and ends Oct. 8, has had a curious pendant, which in its own understated way has made a comment on that anti-Semitism that has passed largely if not entirely unnoticed in Germany.</p>
        <p>The pendant is an installation by Robert Wilson, the American artist best known for his original plays and operas and for his highly stylized direction and design for stage works by others, old and new. But Mr. Wilson started as a painter, and has kept up his work in the visual arts throughout his career. He has specialized (apart from his idiosyncratic chair designs) in installations, tableaus charged with implied theatricality. He even won the Golden Lion sculpture award for one of those installations at the 1993 Venice Biennale.</p>

        <p>The Passion Play here, depicting the last hours and resurrection of Jesus, has been delighting Christian believers and incurring increasing controversy over its anti-Semitism, however grudgingly modified in recent decades, for nearly 400 years. But this year's installment, which began on May 21 and ends Oct. 8, has had a curious pendant, which in its own understated way has made a comment on that anti-Semitism that has passed largely if not entirely unnoticed in Germany.</p>
        <p>The pendant is an installation by Robert Wilson, the American artist best known for his original plays and operas and for his highly stylized direction and design for stage works by others, old and new. But Mr. Wilson started as a painter, and has kept up his work in the visual arts throughout his career. He has specialized (apart from his idiosyncratic chair designs) in installations, tableaus charged with implied theatricality. He even won the Golden Lion sculpture award for one of those installations at the 1993 Venice Biennale.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wilson's Oberammergau installation is called ''14 Stations'' and is located directly behind the Passion Play Theater. Its subject is, of course, entirely suitable and was indeed commissioned by the organizers of the Passion Play. It depicts the 14 Stations of the Cross, the stages through which Jesus passed on the way to his crucifixion.</p>
        <p>The work is entered through a long, warehouselike building, from the center of which, at right angles, extends a walkway. On either side of the walkway are six gray cottages, and at the end is a final sculpture depicting the Resurrection. The entrance building has a dark floor and walls and a clinical-looking bright ceiling. Bright bulbs hang on wires in neat rows, and in the center is a metal cistern, at the bottom of which is a vortex of liquid that looks like blood.</p>
        <p>The far end offers a Wilsonesque vision of the Resurrection: a cutaway teepee-like structure with a grass floor, a thatched interior, a blue bed and, suspended above the bed, an upside down white mannequin.</p>
        <p>The 12 cottages, 6 on either side of the Via Crucis, or axis, have small windows on the walkway side, through which only one person at a time can comfortably peer. As you stick your head inside each cottage, you become the sole observer of a tableau -- a Ludwig II-like observer at your own private opera -- with eerie sound effects adding to the effect of a frozen Wagnerian music drama.</p>
        <p>Each tableau depicts an incident in Jesus' passage toward death: shouldering the cross, falling beneath it, Veronica wiping his face, six charitable women, being stripped of his garments.</p>
        <p>The tableaus are in a style familiar to those who know Mr. Wilson's work. Each has a chilly mystical power, with disembodied hands, hanging boulders, white mannequins dressed and undressed, suspended furniture, beds. They are moving but also disturbing, nightmares for the faithful.</p>
        <p>The most striking tableaus are the 12th and 13th, the last before the Resurrection. The 12th, entitled ''Jesus dies on the cross,'' shows a pack of five raging red wolves, snarling, teeth glistening, ready to lunge. They are set against a painted rendering of craggy Alps, of the sort in which Oberammergau itself is nestled, part of a recurrent motif of German Romanticism that pervades the installation.</p>
        <p>The 13th, ''Jesus is taken down from the cross and laid in Mary's arms,'' has a blue ceiling and walls, with what looks like a heap of hundreds of glass medical-sample bottles piled up on the floor. Above them soar 11 stuffed birds, depicted with precise realism. In the background is a hanging fabric, rippling lightly, with what looks like a red-lipsticked fashion model from an issue of Vogue magazine from the 1950's, with literally bejeweled tears on her face and an enigmatic smile. The model turns out to be Madonna, the pop singer.</p>
        <p>In discussing his ideas for the installation in interviews, Mr. Wilson has laid emphasis on the shape of a Christian cathedral and on Quaker imagery, which has long influenced his work. The cottages and much of the furniture look Quaker, and especially in the sixth and eighth stations, with threatening female mannequins dressed in Quaker costumes, the connection is marked. But that's not all there is to it.</p>
        <p>Nearly everyone who visits ''14 Stations'' is disturbed by it, and some, including one recent visitor, a Jewish woman from Beverly Hills who is a longtime Wilson admirer, say they are terrified, even though they may feel no particular involvement with the Passion story itself. There may be a covert reason for this disquietude.</p>
        <p>Whether for a stage production or an installation, Mr. Wilson draws from piles of pictures and picture books heaped on a work table. While he was preparing his version of ''Four Saints in Three Acts'' at the Houston Grand Opera, the table had everything from Javanese and African jewelry to Quaker houses to Spanish Renaissance paintings.</p>
        <p>From the form ''14 Stations'' has taken, it appears Mr. Wilson drew his pictorial inspiration not just from representations of Christian cathedrals, Quaker villages and craggy Alps, but also from photos of nearby Dachau, Auschwitz and the ultimate Nazi killing machine, Birkenau, near Auschwitz.</p>
        <p>There is a long transverse brick entry building at Birkenau, through which the train tracks ran directly toward the crematories (now replaced with an anti-Fascist memorial). The tracks (they're still there) ran up the central spine of the camp, flanked by low wooden bunkers that look rather like Mr. Wilson's Quaker cottages. The Resurrection teepee recalls death-camp crematories. The medical bottles in the 13th station look like the piles of eyeglasses at Auschwitz. Hitler's nickname was Wolf. The central walkway here is made of railroad ties.</p>
        <p>When asked about this connection, Mr. Wilson allowed that people had suggested the parallel to him as the work took shape, and that he had conceded, ''You could see it that way.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Wilson has a history of discretion about owning up fully to controversial inspirations for his pieces; he would rather they be appreciated on their own terms, not clouded by controversy. His first-ever production commissioned and created in Europe was for the West Berlin Schaubuhne in 1979 and was called ''Death, Destruction and Detroit.'' (There have since been two more in that series.)</p>
        <p>The central image that inspired Mr. Wilson for that piece was a photo of Rudolf Hess raking leaves in a walled courtyard of Spandau Prison in Berlin. In other words, a reference back to the Nazis was the centerpiece of the entire production, yet Mr. Wilson never once fessed up to that image in interviews.</p>
        <p>In this instance, perhaps he can be taken fully at his word that death-camp imagery played no role in his initial conception. Perhaps. But sometimes those who perceive an artwork find insights in it of which even the artist was unaware, or chose to mask.</p>
        <p>Whether consciously or subconsciously intended, the connection with the Holocaust adds a powerful resonance to this already moving and important work. Mr. Wilson is apparently trying to find a permanent home for ''14 Stations,'' most likely in the United States, once it is dismantled after Oct. 8. If that happened, more people would have a chance to experience its beauty, and its disturbing undercurrents, for themselves.</p>
