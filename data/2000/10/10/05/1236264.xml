        <p>On his way to lunch today, Yankee Manager Joe Torre met up with Don Zimmer, his bench coach, and Torre showed Zimmer an altered lineup he was considering for Game 2. As Torre pulled out a slip of paper, Zimmer produced a few suggestions he had jotted down.</p>
        <p>The proposals were similar and resulted in substantial change. Chuck Knoblauch, the leadoff hitter in all of the Yankees' postseason games since he joined the team in 1998, was dropped out of the lineup altogether, replaced by Glenallen Hill at designated hitter.</p>
        <p>The slumping Paul O'Neill, a fixture in the No. 3 slot in the batting order for years, was dropped to sixth. Shortstop Derek Jeter was shifted from No. 2 to leadoff, catcher Jorge Posada moved to No. 2, and David Justice went from No. 5 to No. 3. Luis Sojo remained in the lineup as the second baseman.</p>
        <p>As it turned out, Sojo and Hill had a hand in the first three runs of the Yankees' 4-0 victory tonight. Sojo drove in two runs with a double in the Yankees' three-run sixth inning after Hill had singled to drive in one.</p>
        <p>''It's just to do something different,'' Torre said before the game. ''The hard part was having to sit Knobby. I think it's more rearranging the furniture than anything else.''</p>
        <p>Knoblauch entered tonight's game with better career numbers against Oakland's starter, Kevin Appier, than Hill's. Knoblauch had 13 hits in 40 at-bats (.325) against Appier. In one start against him this year, Knoblauch was 2 for 4 with a homer and a double. Hill, on the other hand, entered 2 for 12 (.167) against Appier after going 0 for 3 with two strikeouts against him in August. But Torre was resolute.</p>
        <p>The Yankees are starving for offense and Torre wants Hill to provide some power at a time when O'Neill, Jeter, Tino Martinez and Scott Brosius are not. He could have returned Knoblauch to second base, but Torre acknowledged that he did not because of Knoblauch's compromised defense.</p>
        <p>Knoblauch has been a star player his entire career, acquired by the Yankees primarily for his skills as a leadoff hitter. Anticipating that Knoblauch would be asked about the move by members of the news media, Torre encouraged Knoblauch this afternoon to say what he felt.</p>
        <p>But Knoblauch managed to contain his anger. ''I'm not surprised by anything anymore,'' he said. ''It's not about me; it's about winning.''</p>
        <p>He was asked if he felt he could help the Yankees win at a time when the offense was hurting. ''I don't want to take anything away from anybody else,'' Knoblauch said, ''but certainly, yeah, I feel I add a dimension leading off, getting on base. I want to make things happen. I got on base a couple of times last night but didn't score.''</p>
        <p>Knoblauch indicated that he felt his defense at second had been good, that he had been making the plays. Torre felt differently. ''That's his decision,'' Knoblauch said. ''He's the manager. If he doesn't have confidence enough in me to put me out there, then he's not. You've got to live with that.''</p>
        <p>Sojo made the only Yankee error tonight when, in the eighth inning, he fielded a grounder cleanly but then fell to the ground when his feet got tangled up while he was setting himself to throw to first.</p>
        <p>O'Neill, who is 5 for 47 (.106) since Sept. 12, was 0 for 2 with two walks tonight. Being dropped to sixth in the lineup did not take pressure off him. He came up with the bases loaded in the first inning and flied out to right field. But he played a role in the three-run sixth when he was intentionally walked with two out and Bernie Williams on second, setting up Hill's single and Sojo's double.</p>
        <p>Weekend Game Times</p>
        <p>With their victory in Oakland tonight, the Yankees helped clarify the weekend schedule in New York for themselves and the Mets.</p>
        <p>By tying the series at 1-1, the Yankees assured a Game 4 at Yankee Stadium at 7:30 p.m. Saturday. Game 3 of the Mets-Giants division series that day will be at 4 p.m. if the Seattle-Chicago series is over, or at 1 p.m. if there is a Game 4 in Seattle.</p>
        <p>If the Yankees and A's need a Game 5, it will be played at 8 p.m. Sunday in Oakland. If that is the case, and the Mets-Giants series needs a Game 4, it will be played at 4 p.m. Sunday at Shea.</p>
        <p>If there is no Yankee game on Sunday and the Mets need a Game 4, they will play at 8 p.m.  BASEBALL: YANKEES NOTEBOOK</p>
