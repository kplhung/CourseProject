        <p>Mike Piazza remained seated in the dugout as Matt Franco looked at strike three from Mariano Rivera to end Game 4 last night. Piazza stayed there as Bobby Valentine walked by and patted his right knee, trying to comprehend how his first World Series could be one loss from ending.</p>
        <p>Piazza still sounded defeated half an hour later as he spoke quietly by his locker. He has been at the center of this entire series, but last night his two-run home run was not enough in a 3-2 loss to the Yankees.</p>
        <p>''It's frustrating,' Piazza said when asked why he took so long going to his locker. ''I'm not in the best of moods.''</p>
        <p>Piazza seemed to realize the Yankees had given the Mets a chance last night and they had squandered it. In the top of the ninth, the Yankees had two runners on before David Justice flied out to the warning track in right field to end the inning. Piazza remained in his crouch behind the plate and Scott Brosius, the Yankees' runner on third base, whispered ''whew'' as he jogged off the field.</p>
        <p>The whole night felt like that, Piazza acknowledged. The Yankees could have easily won by more than a run, but it became a tease to the Mets.</p>
        <p>In the bottom of the ninth inning, as his teammates stood or leaned on the dugout steps, Piazza and pitcher Bobby M. Jones, who is not on the active roster, were the only players sitting on the dugout bench. Piazza's elbows rested on his knees and he stared at the field as Benny Agbayani looked at strike three to start the inning. Piazza would see Jay Payton fly out to left field before Franco came to bat.</p>
        <p>The bat was out of Piazza's hands and he was helpless.</p>
        <p>Piazza has been the centerpiece of the Mets' World Series experience. Like most of his teammates, he had no experience in such a grand stage and had little idea what to expect. He has played a key role in each game.</p>
        <p>In Game 1, Piazza made his World Series debut as a designated hitter and was held to a single. He was picked off first base, one of several base-running blunders in the Mets' 12-inning loss. Game 2 featured his rematch with Roger Clemens, which quickly degenerated into a bat-throwing incident. Piazza faced endless questions the next two days.</p>
        <p>Piazza doubled and scored the tying run in Game 3 before the Mets won, 4-2. Last night, Piazza served as the Mets' only offense.</p>
        <p>In the first inning he nearly homered, driving Denny Neagle's 0-1 pitch down the left-field line and into the upper deck but foul. Piazza blamed himself for being too ''amped'' and trying to power the ball over the fence, instead of swinging up the middle or to right field.</p>
        <p>''That was just another what if,'' Piazza said. He struck out that at-bat, but got Neagle in his next turn.</p>
        <p>In the third inning, Neagle, the Yankees' left-handed starter, made a good pitch to Piazza on a 1-0 count, but Piazza drove the breaking ball below his knees over the left-center-field wall. The home run was Piazza's second of the Series and cut into the Yankees' 3-0 lead.</p>
        <p>''We thought that was going to be a big help and complete the comeback,'' Piazza said. ''We didn't get it done. It was a frustrating night.''</p>
        <p>Piazza had hit only .211 with two homers and seven runs batted in during his postseason career before this month. Last night's home run was Piazza's fourth of these playoffs.</p>
        <p>The Yankees were hitting line drives off Bobby J. Jones, beginning with Derek Jeter, who hit Jones's first pitch over the left-center-field wall. Jones allowed a run in each of the first three innings and appeared in danger of quickly leaving the game. He made it through five innings.</p>
        <p>Piazza's home run helped accelerate Neagle's departure.</p>
        <p>Following the home run, Neagle retired seven of the next eight batters to bring up Piazza again with two outs and no one on in the fifth inning. Yankees Manager Joe Torre had seen Piazza crush two balls off Neagle and was not about to lose the one-run lead. He removed Neagle for David Cone, who got Piazza to pop out to second base on a slider that broke back over the plate.</p>
        <p>The score remained 3-2 entering the bottom of the eighth inning, when Torre called on Rivera to get a save. Again, Piazza factored heavily in Torre's thinking. Piazza was 0 for 2 with a walk in his career against Rivera, including a strikeout in Game 1.</p>
        <p>After Edgardo Alfonzo lined out to right field, Piazza hit a hard grounder to shortstop on a 1-1 pitch. Todd Zeile followed with a single, but Robin Ventura popped out on the first pitch to end the eighth.</p>
