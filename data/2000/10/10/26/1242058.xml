        <p>This is a new 30-second commercial, ''Friends,'' that the Clinton campaign plans to begin broadcasting today.</p>
        <p>PRODUCER -- Callahan Creative</p>
        <p>ON THE SCREEN -- The commercial opens with a snippet from a Lazio campaign commercial released Monday in which Representative Rick A. Lazio, seated at a diner, refers to a saying of his father, ''Show me your friends, and I'll tell you who you are.'' The image is moved to the upper left side of the screen as highlights of the announcer's script appear on the screen.

        <p>PRODUCER -- Callahan Creative</p>
        <p>ON THE SCREEN -- The commercial opens with a snippet from a Lazio campaign commercial released Monday in which Representative Rick A. Lazio, seated at a diner, refers to a saying of his father, ''Show me your friends, and I'll tell you who you are.'' The image is moved to the upper left side of the screen as highlights of the announcer's script appear on the screen. A reproduction of a Daily News story used as a source in the advertisement flashes on the screen. The commercial ends with white text on a black screen reading: ''Rick Lazio does take care of his friends. But what about you?'' Below the words is a small picture of Hillary Rodham Clinton.</p>
        <p>THE SCRIPT -- Mr. Lazio: ''Show me your friends, and I'll tell you who you are.''</p>
        <p>Announcer: ''O.K., let's look at Rick Lazio's friends. A Daily News investigation just revealed that the homebuilding industry has kicked in a million dollars to Lazio's campaign. And Lazio has tried to help them weaken safety and construction standards. The AARP said his bill could lead to weaker safety rules, put residents at risk. This is the industry that Rick Lazio is supposed to oversee as chairman of the housing subcommittee. Rick Lazio -- he does take care of his friends. But what about you?''</p>
        <p>ACCURACY -- The commercial relies on an Oct. 8 report in The Daily News and, in the case of AARP, an Oct. 15, 1998, article in The News and Record of Greensboro, N.C., quoting officials of the organization reacting to a bill Mr. Lazio had introduced in 1998 that included a provision to change safety and construction standards for manufactured housing. Mr. Lazio was being lobbied by the manufactured housing industry at the time and had accepted thousands of dollars in donations from  executives of manufactured housing companies. But the commercial fails to note that Mr. Lazio agreed to modify the legislation after negotiations with Democrats and opponents, including the AARP, and the bill was later wrapped into a larger housing bill that passed the House and Senate earlier this year. Several opponents that fought the original bill are no longer fighting it. Mr. Lazio's campaign also noted that the congressman, as chairman of the housing subcommittee, at times has won bipartisan praise for his legislative work on housing. This advertisement, said Mr. Lazio's chief spokesman, Dan McLagan, ''is the latest and most unbelievable desperate charge from the Clinton spin, smear machine.''</p>
        <p>SCORECARD -- It is uncertain how effective this attack ad will be for a public facing a barrage of them from both camps in the closing days of a tightly contested race. The breathless tone of the commercial should be enough to give viewers pause. Its review of this part of Mr. Lazio's housing record is a flat-out distortion meant to confuse viewers about Mr. Lazio's record in the House at a time when he has increasingly cited it to justify his run for the Senate.</p>
