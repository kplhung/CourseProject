        <p>President Clinton and Congressional Republicans narrowed their differences today over a tax-cut package that includes relief for small businesses and an increase in the federal minimum wage, but significant hurdles still blocked final agreement.</p>
        <p>The tax bill, which would cost roughly $245 billion over 10 years, is also intended to help people pay for retirement and for long-term health care, to offer incentives to revitalize poor urban and rural areas and to impose new tax rules for American exporters to avert a trade war with the European Union.</p>
        <p>After months of partisan bickering, Mr. Clinton and Speaker J. Dennis Hastert exchanged amiable letters today, promising cooperation in hammering out a year-end tax relief package.</p>
        <p>But House and Senate Democrats, as well as the White House, said they had not seen final details of the Republican plan, and after looking at Republican summaries distributed today, they raised objections about provisions that they said would draw a presidential veto.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, Republican leaders said they would try to schedule votes in the House and Senate on Thursday for the bill, and they all but dared Mr. Clinton to veto legislation that contains provisions he wants, like the antipoverty program and higher minimum wage.</p>
        <p>''We've gone as far as we can go, and we've made a lot of adjustment, taken consideration of the things that they had concerns about or wanted,'' said Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader.</p>
        <p>''But at some point,'' Mr. Lott continued, ''we have to get the votes in the House and in the Senate, and the president has to do what he feels like he has to do.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lott said it would be ''unfathomable'' for Mr. Clinton to veto the tax package.</p>
        <p>But Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader, and Gene Sperling, Mr. Clinton's economic policy director, said the president would do just that unless Republicans agreed to several changes, including more money for school construction and less money back to Medicare for health maintenance organizations.</p>
        <p>''We're still too far apart for the president to sign this bill,'' Mr. Sperling said, ''but we're hopeful that negotiations lead to a bill that's mutually agreeable.''</p>
        <p>The dueling tax proposals came as Congress approved a 24-hour extension of spending at current levels to keep the government running through Thursday. It is the only type of extension that Mr. Clinton says he will now approve -- 25 days into the new fiscal year -- in an effort to force lawmakers to wrap up the budget process.</p>
        <p>The House approved a bill today to finance primarily the nation's foreign aid programs, legislation that also contained authority to raise the budget ceilings for discretionary spending to $637 billion from $600 billion for the current fiscal year.</p>
        <p>Aside from the tax bill, lawmakers and administration officials said major differences over education and immigration policies still stalled final action on two major spending measures. Republican negotiators met tonight to decide whether to push their immigration plans over the White House's objections.</p>
        <p>''We're stopped,'' Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa, said.  ''We're dead in the water. Nothing's happened in two days.''</p>
        <p>Frustration was evident on the Senate floor.</p>
        <p>''It's time we realized that at the end of this week we will be one week away from the election,'' said Senator Ted Stevens, an Alaska Republican who heads the Appropriations Committee. ''I do not believe Congress should be in session one week before the election.''</p>
        <p>The tax bill contains several popular provisions.</p>
        <p>Workers would be able to set aside $5,000 in individual retirement accounts, up from $2,000 now. In 401(k) plans, which permit workers to set aside savings from their pay and allow employers to take tax deductions for adding to those amounts, the annual limit on tax-deferred employee contributions would rise to $15,000 from $10,500. An exception would be made for those people over 50, who would be allowed to save an extra $5,000 a year.</p>
        <p>The minimum wage would increase by $1, to $6.15 an hour, over two years. In exchange, Mr. Clinton agreed to $30 billion in tax breaks for small businesses, to offset the increased wages. But at Mr. Clinton's insistence, Republican leaders dropped several proposals, including one to freeze the wages of waiters and waitresses who earn tips, at $2.13 an hour.</p>
        <p>Republican leaders want the bill to include a full deduction for people who pay 50 percent or more of their own health insurance premiums and a $10,000 deduction for the costs of adopting a child.</p>
        <p>Democrats argue that this approach will not do enough to help  uninsured Americans. In his letter to Mr. Hastert, the president said such deductions were ''inefficient'' and proposed making them tax credits instead.</p>
        <p>Critics of the Republican plan complained that while pension limits were increased for people with higher incomes, two other Democratic measures, one intended to encourage  savings for middle-income workers and another to provide tax incentives for small businesses to provide pensions for their employees, were dropped.</p>
