      <block class="full_text">
        <p>President Alberto K. Fujimori ordered military units to hunt down his former intelligence chief tonight, but after security forces searched five locations, they could not find him.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fujimori led the operation to locate the former spy chief, Vladimiro Montesinos, who returned to Peru on Monday from a monthlong exile in Panama, and in doing so, threw Peru into a state of agitation.</p>
        <p>Opposition leaders celebrated the decision to isolate Mr. Montesinos, and quickly concluded a deal with the government on the date for new elections, in which Mr. Fujimori has pledged not to run.</p>
        <p>As a condition for clearing the way for the elections, the government had been insisting on a sweeping amnesty for members of the security forces. But tonight the government suddenly dropped that condition, and the negotiators agreed to an election date of April 8.</p>
        <p>Speaking to the nation late tonight, Mr. Fujimori called for calm, but suggested that elements of the security forces had probably helped Mr. Montesinos escape. ''We hope this operation will have the total support of the complete armed forces and police,'' President Fujimori said.</p>
        <p>In ordering the operation, Mr. Fujimori told all military units to remain in their barracks. He said he took personal command of the operation, which included elite units of all the armed forces.</p>
        <p>Mr. Montesinos, who had been Mr. Fujimori's closest aide since 1990, is suspected of involvement in a variety of crimes ranging from corrupt acts to human rights violations, including torture.</p>
        <p>It was not clear exactly what Mr. Fujimori hoped to gain from the operation. Curiously, he told the nation, ''there is no order to detain him, only to find him.'' But he added, ''This operation will continue day and night until he is found.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fujimori said once Mr. Montesinos was found, he would be handed over to judicial authorities.</p>
        <p>Since Monday, Mr. Fujimori has been touring military installations, apparently to rally support, and he quietly transferred several of Mr. Montesinos's allies out of security positions in the presidential palace.</p>
        <p>Mr. Montesinos was forced to leave the country four weeks ago after a videotape was broadcast on a cable television station showing him handing over $15,000 to a newly elected opposition congressman in exchange for his change of parties. The video also forced Mr. Fujimori to call for new presidential elections in which he will not run.</p>
        <p>Since Mr. Montesinos's return, the first vice president, Francisco Tudela, resigned and the government's forces in the Congress have divided.</p>
        <p>Mr. Montesinos continued to play a role in Peru even while in exile, directing members of the military high command that he handpicked last year to put pressure on Mr. Fujimori to issue the amnesty.</p>
        <p>Since his private jet arrived at an air force base in the southern port of Pisco on Monday, Mr. Montesinos's whereabouts has not been made public.</p>
        <p>Senior American officials monitoring developments said they thought that Mr. Fujimori had reinforced his control over the armed forces in recent days. ''I really do not think there is any danger of a coup,'' a senior Clinton administration official said.</p>
        <p>''Fujimori is removing people from positions who were more loyal to Montesinos than to him.''</p>
        <p>The talks with the opposition broke down over the weekend over the proposed amnesty for the security forces. But when the government relented tonight, the opposition, in turn, agreed that the presidential term would be reduced to four years, from five.</p>
        <p>''Today began the national reconciliation'' said an opposition congressman, Fernando Olivera. ''I want to congratulate the president and the armed forces.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Montesinos has acted with increasing independence of Mr. Fujimori since the presidential campaign earlier this year in which he manipulated much of the media, judges and the election apparatus, which came under heavy criticism from the Organization of American States. Where his power ended and the president's began became more and more difficult to decipher.</p>
        <p>Much of his power apparently came from intelligence files and videotapes peering into the lives of military officers, government officials and opposition leaders.</p>
        <p>The former spy chief was long an associate of the Central Intelligence Agency, according to government officials of Peru and the United States.</p>
        <p>He directed an antinarcotics agency with C.I.A. help within the National Intelligence Service. United States officials said he was the only official who could coordinate the operations of various security forces, and he served as a conduit for intelligence.</p>
        <p>His relationship to the United States goes back to the 1970's. Finally the Clinton administration broke with Mr. Montesinos two months ago when evidence emerged that he may have known of the selling of Russian assault rifles to a Marxist guerrilla group in Colombia, or even been involved in it, American officials said.</p>
