        <p>SLAIMAN-Don. The Officers, Members and Staff of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union mourn the loss of Don Slaiman, a great friend of working people, a leader in the battle for civil rights in this country and a fighter for justice throughout the world. Don Slaiman believed in the rights of all workers to be treated with dignity, justice and respect, and devoted his life to advancing their cause. People throughout the world have been touched by his integrity and commitment. We will miss him greatly. Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union UFCW, AFL-CIO, CLC Stuart Appelbaum, President Charlie N. Hall, Sr. Secretary-Treasurer Lenore Miller, President Emeritus</p>
        <p>SLAIMAN-Donald S. The officers, staff and leadership of the Jewish Labor Committee mourn the death of Donald Slaiman, trade union and civil rights activist, and past president of our organization. Brother Slaiman will be remembered for his many years of involvement in the labor movement. His work as head of the Michigan Jewish Labor Committee in the 1950s, and later as JLC's President from 1979 to 1984, was a natural extension of his commitment to defending the rights of working men and women. Heartfelt condolences to wife, Marjorie, sons Donald and Gary, daughters Lauren and Tracey, and grandchildren. Morton Bahr, President Avram B. Lyon Executive Director Jewish Labor Committee</p>
