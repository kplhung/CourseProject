        <p>''If we win this seat, we're going to control Congress,'' Representative Thomas M. Davis III of Virginia, head of the National Republican Congressional Committee, told a group of party loyalists gathered to support Shelley Moore Capito for Congress.</p>
        <p>Mr. Davis, who makes the same comment in various districts and expects to retain control whatever happens here, was spending today campaigning for Mrs. Capito because the Republicans have taken this race seriously for more than a year, while Democrats have scoffed.</p>
        <p>One measure shows how seriously: 40 Republican incumbents gave her $41,000 last year out of their own campaign coffers. Political action committees headed by Republicans like Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, Dick Armey, the majority leader, Tom DeLay, the majority whip, and others chipped in $42,999 more. ''When I got that help in November,'' Mrs. Capito said, ''I could get started.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Capito, the daughter of former Gov. Arch A. Moore Jr., is challenging decades of Democratic control in the Second District. The seat opened when Representative Bob Wise ran for governor, and Jim Humphreys, a Democratic lawyer and former legislator, is still favored. But her efforts and television advertisements run by the Republican Congressional group have made it a contest.</p>
        <p>The Republican members' money was critical. Mrs. Capito has now received $105,374 from Republicans' campaign funds and PAC's. And she is just one of 11 nonincumbent Republicans to have taken in $100,000 or more from such sources, compared with just four Democratic nonincumbents, according to data assembled by the Center for Responsive Politics.</p>
        <p>The explanation is quite simple. Representative Larry Combest of Texas, for example, who sent $2,000 last October, has no worries about being re-elected. But he will not continue to be chairman of the Agriculture Committee unless the Republicans hold the House. Democrats need a net gain of just seven seats to take control.</p>
        <p>Representatives Philip M. Crane of Illinois and Bill Thomas of California expect to be re-elected comfortably. Each would like to be chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. If Democrats take control, neither will make it. Mr. Crane sent $4,000 and Mr. Thomas $2,000.</p>
        <p>Republicans have poured members' money and leadership PAC cash into several other seats they hope to take from the Democrats. Former Representative Dick Zimmer, trying to win back New Jersey's 12th District, has received $156,000. Melissa Hart, seeking the Democratic open seat in Pennsylvania's Fourth District, has $153,499. Mike Rogers, trying for the Democratic open seat in Michigan's Eighth District, received $124,572.</p>
        <p>Embattled incumbents have done even better with their colleagues. Representative Ernie Fletcher of Kentucky received $178,270, and Representative Donald L. Sherwood of Pennsylvania received $168,378.</p>
        <p>Democrats have made similar efforts, but not as widely. Dianne Byrum, running against Mr. Rogers, has taken in $162,202 from members and their PAC's. Scotty Baesler, Mr. Fletcher's challenger, got $132,000. But in all, only nine Democrats, including incumbents, got $100,000 or more from members and their PAC's. Twenty-one Republicans did.</p>
        <p>Some Democrats are giving without restraint. Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, who wants to be majority whip if Democrats have a majority to be led, has distributed $662,449 in personal and PAC cash. That tops even Mr. DeLay, whose PAC has given $631,142. And Representative Charles B. Rangel of New York, who hopes to thwart Mr. Thomas and Mr. Crane and become the Democratic chairman of Ways and Means, has passed out $359,875.</p>
        <p>Mr. Davis's appearances here and later at Berkeley Springs High School emphasized the party. ''You don't want to send a president to Washington and have a Congress hostile to him,'' he told the students, whose show of hands had made it clear they overwhelmingly preferred Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.</p>
        <p>But as he often must, Mr. Davis soft-pedaled some differences he has with fellow Republicans, including Mrs. Capito. She and the students made it clear they were solidly pro-gun and generally anti-abortion. He represents Washington suburbs, and said in other areas ''citizens react quite differently.''</p>
        <p>Besides the money, the Republican Congressional group provided speech training for Mrs. Capito, a state legislator. But its television advertisements have been its most significant effort. They have pounded Mr. Humphreys, saying ''We can't trust Jim Humphreys'' and reporting that he was late paying taxes.</p>
        <p>They prompted the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee to get involved on top of the $5.3 million Mr. Humphreys has spent. Its newest television advertisement said Mrs. Capito's support for private investment of some Social Security taxes ''would hurt West Virginia families and seniors.''</p>
