        <p>Shea Stadium was buzzing in the afterglow of the Mets' first victory of the World Series on Tuesday night when Derek Jeter was introduced as the leadoff hitter for the Yankees last night. Jeter was oblivious to the rowdy energy around him. His attention was on his good buddy sitting behind home plate, Seattle shortstop Alex Rodriguez.</p>

        <p>Shea Stadium was buzzing in the afterglow of the Mets' first victory of the World Series on Tuesday night when Derek Jeter was introduced as the leadoff hitter for the Yankees last night. Jeter was oblivious to the rowdy energy around him. His attention was on his good buddy sitting behind home plate, Seattle shortstop Alex Rodriguez.</p>
        <p>''I talked to him,'' said Rodriguez, who was in town for a meeting with a company he represents. ''I was messing with him right before he hit the home run.''</p>
        <p>Whether Jeter was responding to his friend's prodding or fulfilling Joe Torre's clairvoyant hunch to change the lineup, the Yankees' shortstop slipped the Mets' fans in the crowd a sedative the instant he lifted a fastball by Bobby J. Jones over the wall on the first pitch in Game 4 of the World Series.</p>
        <p>Jeter set the tone of the game, changed the mood of the stadium and gave the Yankees the critical first run. Nine innings later, it was still as important as it was when it left Jeter's bat in a managerial tug of war the Yankees won, 3-2, to take a commanding three-games-to-one lead in the World Series.</p>
        <p>''Everyone seems to ask if I'm changing my approach when I'm the leadoff hitter,'' said Jeter. ''But I'm aggressive, and I've been known to swing at the first pitch. With runs tough to come by in the postseason, you want to score early.''</p>
        <p>Although Chuck Knoblauch called Jeter's home run in the clubhouse before the game, it was Torre who was the true holder of the crystal ball when he explained the lineup change. Seeking a first punch into the Mets' spirits, Torre removed Jose Vizcaino from the top spot and used Jeter there for the first time in the Series.</p>
        <p>''We've won some games with Jeter in the No. 1 hole,'' Torre said before the game. ''He's just batted second more than any other position. If I recollect correctly, in the five years he's been here, he's batted everywhere from first to ninth. It doesn't matter to him.</p>
        <p>''When I say he's comfortable, that's just from my perspective. If you ask him, it doesn't matter where he hits. Hopefully, the top of the lineup can get things going. He's a great base runner. I'd like to see him score a run in the first inning.''</p>
        <p>Torre's wishes were answered swiftly. But Jeter has made a habit of coming through since the postseason began. Jeter has 19 hits in 59 at-bats, which includes a very impressive 8 for 18 (.444) in the World Series. In some ways, Jeter seems to be making up for a regular season that would have been great by almost anyone's standards but his own. He hit .339 with 15 homers.</p>
        <p>To some, he slipped behind his friend Rodriguez. But Jeter is the one of them still remaining in the postseason. Jeter is the one with all the World Series rings that his buddy has grown to envy. Last night, Torre was the envy of many other managers when his lineup change resulted in an immediate response.</p>
        <p>With Knoblauch's throwing issues, and with the Yankees playing in a National League park, Torre has been forced to mix and match his lineup to fit the situation. One pitch into the game, Torre's decision turned out to be the perfect pick-me-up for the Yankees.</p>
        <p>''It certainly makes you feel good,'' Torre said. ''Jeter may be leading off, but he's not a leadoff hitter. He's going to see the ball, and he's going to swing at the ball. He makes things happen. He's a kid who has only been around five years, and he's got all the qualities of someone who takes charge and leads by example, as opposed to telling anybody that he is the leader of this club.''</p>
        <p>Jeter did not stop at one moment, though. In his next at-bat, he unearthed enough speed to turn a double into a triple and went on to score his second run of the game -- his fifth of the World Series. For a moment, he had a chance to become the first player in postseason history to hit for the cycle. That fantasy fizzled, but he finished 2 for 5 and made a memorable initial impact on the game.</p>
        <p>''We're playing at Shea, and you want to take the crowd out of the game,'' Jeter said. ''We wanted to give Denny Neagle a comfort zone. They battled back. And then it seemed like it was the battle of the bullpens.</p>
        <p>''I was looking for a fastball. It was right there, inside a little bit. I put a good swing on it. I don't consider myself a home run hitter, but every once in a while it happens.''</p>
        <p>Last night his timing was perfect. In front of his good friend Rodriguez, inside a stadium ready to push the Mets to victory, Jeter unleashed his power burst on cue.</p>
        <p>''We're one win away from where we want to be,'' Jeter said.</p>
