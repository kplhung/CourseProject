        <p>Yugoslavia will soon apply to join the United Nations, indicating a clear change in policy under its new president, Vojislav Kostunica, the American ambassador to the United Nations, Richard Holbrooke, said today after meeting with Balkan leaders.</p>
        <p>''It is clear that Yugoslavia will join the United Nations in a very short time,'' Mr. Holbrooke said. ''We are very pleased to hear that.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Holbrooke, who was the first prominent member of the Clinton cabinet to meet with Mr. Kostunica, said he had long argued over the issue of Yugoslavia's membership in the United Nations with the former president, Slobodan Milosevic, who insisted that his country was the sole successor to the old Yugoslavia, even after four of its republics obtained independence, and he refused to apply to join the United Nations.</p>
        <p>Because of that, the old Communist flag of Tito's Yugoslavia still flies outside the headquarters of the United Nations, which has left issues of the property and liabilities of the former Yugoslavian republics frozen.</p>
        <p>Those countries also urged Mr. Kostunica in a joint communique today to respect the equality of the states that emerged from the nation's breakup.</p>
        <p>The issue was just one of many that Mr. Kostunica grappled with today, just weeks into his new job as president, and still without a federal government or even a foreign minister.</p>
        <p>After his meeting with Mr. Holbrooke he also said that he would cooperate with the United Nations war crimes tribunal in The Hague, but that it was not high on his agenda. ''There is an interest for truth of events, but it is not a priority,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kostunica also said he was working on releasing some 800 Kosovo Albanians being held in Serb prisons, and suggested that a law granting them amnesty was a possibility.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kostunica's discussions with Mr. Holbrooke, a longtime negotiator in the Balkans, centered on the Dayton accords that ended the war in Bosnia, as well as on Kosovo and the United Nations resolution under which that province is now governed. The issues of Albanian prisoners in Serbia and the missing Serbs and Albanians were also discussed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Holbrooke played down any differences, saying that the changes in the way Yugoslavia is run following the departure of Mr. Milosevic would be enormous. In particular, he said, there would be an end to the subversion by Milosevic allies and Interior Ministry police.</p>
        <p>Working with Mr. Kostunica on Bosnia would be easier, one senior American official predicted, but serious differences on Kosovo remained.</p>
        <p>''He is a nationalist and he is proud to be one,'' the official said of Mr. Kostunica. ''To a Serb nationalist, Kosovo is part of the Serbian state. But he repeatedly said he was a pragmatist, that Dayton was a part of international law, and that he recognizes that the economic future for Yugoslavia lies in these things. It is encouraging.''</p>
