        <p>All Together  Yes, of course there are families that play together. For proof, look no farther than the Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium of the Metropolitan Museum of Art at 8 tomorrow night. That's when ''Bach With a Beat'' will bring together the clarinetist Richard Stoltzman; his wife, the violinist Lucy Stoltzman; and their son Peter John, a jazz pianist. More than half a dozen other instrumentalists will join in a program that spans cultures and rhythms and mingles Bach with music by Joao Gilberto, Antonio Carlos Jobim and Astor Piazzolla.</p>
        <p>Literary Lights  His works include ''Tea and Sympathy,'' ''I Never Sang for My Father'' and ''The Nun's Story.'' He is the playwright and screenwriter Robert Anderson, and today and tomorrow he will be the subject of a conference, with a performance and staged reading, at the Hofstra University Cultural Center in Hempstead, N.Y. Mr. Anderson will participate with playwrights and actors like Edward Albee, A. R. Gurney, Donald Margulies, George Grizzard, Eileen Heckart and Teresa Wright. . . . Mr. Albee, who is this semester's Sidney Harman Writer in Residence at Baruch College, will also take part in a reading and conversation at 5:45 p.m. today at its Conference Center at 151 East 25th Street in Manhattan. The reading will be devoted to his one-act play ''Counting the Ways,'' which will be followed by a conversation between Mr. Albee and Mel Gussow, a reporter for The New York Times and author of ''Edward Albee: A Singular Journey.''</p>
