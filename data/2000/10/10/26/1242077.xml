        <p>Among the fans in Shea Stadium last night was one Alex Rodriguez, a resident of Miami, who may indeed be shopping for a new place of employment before the next baseball season.</p>
        <p>Rodriguez, who said he was in New York on business unrelated to his free agency, showed up as a surprise to his pal, Derek Jeter, just before the game.</p>
        <p>''He came over and I was messing with him,'' Rodriguez said. ''I told my lawyer, 'Watch, he'll swing at the first pitch,'' ' which Jeter did, hitting a home run to set the tone of the 3-2 Yankee victory over the Mets.</p>
        <p>Rodriguez said he did not speak to officials of either team. The Mets are believed to be interested in him, but he said, ''The way I put it, I'm leaning to Seattle because that's the known.''</p>
        <p>However, he conceded that he does wonder, as he moves from ballpark to ballpark, what it would be like to play in that town. But as far as scouting locations in New York where he might like to live, Rodriguez smiled and said, ''I haven't gotten that far.''</p>
        <p>He admitted he was still fatigued from the American League Championship Series with the Yankees, which the Mariners lost. ''I didn't do my job, I didn't lead my team,'' Rodriguez said, adding that he admires Jeter for ''setting a tone.''</p>
        <p>Rodriguez said, ''It's bizarre for me to be a free agent at 25.'' Then he said he was leaving for Miami.</p>
