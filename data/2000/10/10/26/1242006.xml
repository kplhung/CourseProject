      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial Observer by Tina Rosenberg discusses claim by Hernando de Soto, Peruvian economist, that lack of legal title has crippled economic development in third world; de Soto says world's poor own trillions of dollars' worth of assets: houses, farms and businesses with no formal titles; jungle of red tape dissuades them from seeking title; lack of legal proof of ownership means people cannot use their property as collateral with hope of turning little money into lot of money; legalizing billions of dollars in informal property challenges country's powerful, and can be done only with committed leadership</p>

        <p>The outskirts of third-world cities today are vast jumbles of tin, concrete and misery. Practically every large city in Latin America, Asia and Africa is ringed with settlements of migrants from the countryside. These migrants claim their plots in nighttime land invasions, living under blankets and poles while stockpiling materials for better housing. They establish threadbare small businesses selling fruit or cobbling shoes for their equally impoverished neighbors. And all this takes place outside the margin of the law.</p>
        <p>These precarious concrete houses and makeshift enterprises are the symbols of poverty today for much of the world. But Hernando de Soto, a Peruvian economist, sees them as something else -- assets. To Mr. de Soto, the world's poor own trillions of dollars' worth of assets. But these houses, farms and businesses have no formal titles. The lack of legal proof of ownership means that people cannot use their houses as collateral for loans, sell stakes in their businesses, buy insurance to minimize risks or do other things that people in developed nations can do to turn a little money into a lot of money. But if the poor could get formal title to their property, these dead assets would become trillions of dollars in live capital.</p>

        <p>The outskirts of third-world cities today are vast jumbles of tin, concrete and misery. Practically every large city in Latin America, Asia and Africa is ringed with settlements of migrants from the countryside. These migrants claim their plots in nighttime land invasions, living under blankets and poles while stockpiling materials for better housing. They establish threadbare small businesses selling fruit or cobbling shoes for their equally impoverished neighbors. And all this takes place outside the margin of the law.</p>
        <p>These precarious concrete houses and makeshift enterprises are the symbols of poverty today for much of the world. But Hernando de Soto, a Peruvian economist, sees them as something else -- assets. To Mr. de Soto, the world's poor own trillions of dollars' worth of assets. But these houses, farms and businesses have no formal titles. The lack of legal proof of ownership means that people cannot use their houses as collateral for loans, sell stakes in their businesses, buy insurance to minimize risks or do other things that people in developed nations can do to turn a little money into a lot of money. But if the poor could get formal title to their property, these dead assets would become trillions of dollars in live capital.</p>
        <p>Mr. de Soto, who leads the Institute for Liberty and Democracy in Lima and became known in America as author of the book ''The Other Path,'' has now written ''The Mystery of Capital: Why Capitalism Triumphs in the West and Fails Everywhere Else.'' The answer, he says, lies not in political culture, geography or work ethic, but in the unglamorous world of property registries. Capitalism in America and Britain, he argues, took off when governments decided to make it easy for people to get title to their property. The same would be true in the third world, where the vast majority of dwellings and businesses are what is known as informal holdings.</p>
        <p>Mr. de Soto can be excessively enthusiastic about the joys of property rights. Surely the rise of liberal democracy had something to do with the success of capitalism in developed nations. But over all, his idea is a powerful one. He convincingly argues that lack of legal title has crippled economic development.</p>
        <p>Once their property is considered legal, people no longer have to bribe the police to keep from being turned off their land. They can get cheaper credit in banks instead of going to loan sharks. Only legal proprietors can improve their businesses, confident their investment will not suddenly vanish. Informal businesses are invisible to investors. Few providers of electricity, telephone lines or water are willing to grant services to buildings for which no one is legally responsible.</p>
        <p>Although extralegal owners pay no taxes, Mr. de Soto argues that most poor people would love to get title to their property but simply cannot. In ''The Other Path,'' he and his aides set up a two-sewing-machine garment factory in a Lima shantytown and recorded exactly what was necessary to register it legally. As improbable as it may seem, they concluded that an entrepreneur would need 300 days, working six hours a day. To get title to a house in an informal settlement whose permanence the government had already acknowledged took 728 steps for one agency alone, and 10 other agencies also required approvals. Mr. de Soto's team is now working in Egypt, Mexico, the Philippines and Haiti, and it has found the same jungle of red tape, and the same consequences.</p>
        <p>Mr. de Soto hopes to foment a revolution, but his ideas have intriguing alliances with a revolution well under way, the microcredit movement. Microcredit is the child of Muhammad Yunus, a Bangladeshi economist, who began in 1976 by lending 62 cents apiece to a group of 42 artisans -- thus freeing them to buy a day's materials in advance and sell the finished product to whoever they chose, at market rates. Mr. Yunus founded the Grameen Bank, which gives small loans mainly to women.  The borrowers need only social collateral -- they form groups of five and all are cut off if one defaults. Today more than eight million people in more than 58 countries get microcredit loans. A few years ago, a study of Grameen borrowers showed that one-third had escaped poverty.</p>
        <p>The first place Mr. de Soto set up a property registry was Peru, and 1.3 million buildings and 300,000 businesses were titled from 1991 to 1994. Now he and his team are doing similar work in other countries.</p>
        <p>Legalizing billions of dollars in informal property challenges a country's powerful, and can be done only with committed political leadership. In many ways Mr. Yunus has an easier job, as all microcredit requires from government is that it stay out of the way. But the success of small loans at lifting people from poverty makes Mr. de Soto's idea even more intriguing. ''Five-sixths of humanity have assets, but nothing they can use to secure a loan,'' he says. ''When their assets are documented, the banks will find a way to lend them money.''</p>
