        <p>Animated by a spirit of whimsy, characters with names like Finola Cornflakes, Granny Gee and Dr. Disposio enliven Neena Beeber's new comedy ''Hard Feelings.''

Recognizable problems abound -- self-realization, self-image, unhappy love affairs, senile dementia, child custody and career choices among them.</p>

        <p>Animated by a spirit of whimsy, characters with names like Finola Cornflakes, Granny Gee and Dr. Disposio enliven Neena Beeber's new comedy ''Hard Feelings.'' The props include a pair of pale green bunny slippers and a revolver. Recognizable problems abound -- self-realization, self-image, unhappy love affairs, senile dementia, child custody and career choices among them.</p>
        <p>But when all is said and done, when the bunny slippers have worked their magic, when characters come to terms with their real selves and when a happy ending comes knocking at the door, ''Hard Feelings'' proves to be unexceptional fluff.</p>
        <p>As spirited and well acted as the characters are in this Women's Project and Productions presentation at the Women's Project Theater, they are neither funny enough to be highly entertaining nor deep enough to be touching. Still, under the direction of Maria Mileaf, the pace never flags as Selma Rogers (Seana Kofoed) contends with her messy life.</p>
        <p>To begin with, her unseen mother seems to have taken permanent custody of Selma's daughter, Edwina, who supposedly was left with her only until Selma straightened out her troubles. To make matters worse, Selma's lover, Finola Cornflakes (Kate Jennings Grant), a grief counselor, is leaving, though not without making a parting gift of those bunny slippers.</p>
        <p>To compound Selma's difficulties, she lives with Granny Gee (Mary Fogarty), her maternal grandmother, whose ability to remember flickers worse than a candle in a windstorm (except when she dons those slippers). And one more thing. Selma makes her living performing electrolysis, but new techniques are about to make hers obsolete. In the meantime she tends to her client Irene (Pamela J. Gray), a totally self-absorbed blonde who can't make up her mind whether to marry for money or go off to India.</p>
        <p>So it's back to school again for Selma. Having already studied hypnosis, she now decides to take a course in writing, only to encounter more problems. The professor, Dr. Disposio (Guy Boyd), is a pompous, prurient, arbitrary and capricious fraud who takes pride in his refusal to read beyond first sentences. But when he finally consents to accept Selma as a student, she discovers that one of her classmates is Finola.</p>
        <p>Through it all, Selma remains determined to get back her daughter, even if it means using Irene's pistol.</p>
        <p>The ingredients are plentiful. The pot bubbles. But in the end, really, nothing extraordinary is cooking in ''Hard Feelings.''</p>
        <p>HARD FEELINGS</p>
        <p>By Neena Beber; directed by Maria Mileaf; sets by Neil Patel; costumes by Katherine Roth; lighting by Russell Champa; sound by Eileen Tague; production manager, B. D. White; production stage manager, Becky Garrett. Presented by the Women's Project and Productions; Julia Miles, artistic director; Patricia Taylor, managing director. At the Women's Project Theater, 424 West 55th Street, Clinton.</p>
        <p>WITH: Seana Kofoed (Selma Rogers), Guy Boyd (Dr. Disposio), Kate Jennings Grant (Finola Cornflakes), Mary Fogarty (Granny Gee) and Pamela J. Gray (Irene).</p>
