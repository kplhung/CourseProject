        <p>CHEATS have always driven Joan R. Salzman crazy. She's 43 now, yet there's no missing the flush of adolescent pique undermining her veneer of grown-up makeup as she thinks back to grade school and the earth science classmate who cheated her way to good test marks whenever the teacher's back was turned.</p>
        <p>The high school valedictorian in her is still irked by it.</p>
        <p>''I used to get so incensed,'' says Ms. Salzman, adding that she restrained herself from informing on the earth science scofflaw only because she did not want to be ''a rat.''</p>
        <p>Times have changed. If you work for the city, heads up. Ms. Salzman, the chief of enforcement for the Conflicts of Interest Board, is watching. Commissioners she watches extra hard. Wielding the ethics code spelled out in Chapter 68 of the City Charter and able to impose fines of up to $10,000 for each infraction, the board has heard more than 100 complaints this year, up from 80 in 1999 and 8 in 1990, the year it began imposing fines.</p>
        <p>''And ignorance is not an excuse,''  Ms. Salzman says.</p>
        <p>Ever since the board went to the mat in a four-year tussle with the former city comptroller, Elizabeth Holtzman, for taking a campaign loan from a bank with a bond-underwriting subsidiary that was looking for city business, the rules it enforces have gained a higher profile.</p>
        <p>''A landmark case,'' Ms. Salzman says.</p>
        <p>Ms. Holtzman was fined $7,500, not a devastating amount, but being a banner public servant is all about reputation, reputation, reputation. And when a public official is rebuked or fined by the conflicts board, reputation takes a hit.</p>
        <p>Just ask the former police commissioner, Howard Safir, whose acceptance of a $7,000 trip to the 1999 Academy Awards from Revlon set the precedent for enforcement of the Valuable Gift Rule. Or a former city sheriff, Kerry John Katsorhis, whose $84,000 fine for numerous ethics violations, including using city equipment to conduct an outside law practice, was the largest ever. Four years later, he is still fighting Ms. Salzman in appellate court.</p>
        <p>The board, by the way, has never lost a case. ''Not yet,'' says Ms. Salzman, not wanting to appear smug about the board's batting average.</p>
        <p>Most recently, the commissioner of the Human Resources Administration, Jason A. Turner, and his first deputy, Mark Hoover, felt the board's censure. Yesterday, Mr. Hoover was fined $8,500 for misuse of office; last week, Mr. Turner was fined $6,500 for various offenses, including hiring Mr. Hoover, his former business partner, and using city resources to complete an Arizona consulting contract that predated his appointment by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.</p>
        <p>Textbook stuff, Ms. Salzman says of the rules Mr. Turner skirted.</p>
        <p>SO would it be some sort of conflict, Ms. Salzman, you closet Yankees fan, to disclose whether it annoyed you when the mayor deemed ignorance an excuse for Mr. Turner's misdemeanors, and said his behavior was unwitting, not unethical?</p>
        <p>Ms. Salzman's eyelids flutter like hummingbird wings -- she's not flirting, she's edgy. Sure, she knows better than to criticize the mayor, not that her appointment to this $98,000-a-year post came through him -- she answered a classified ad back in 1994 and worked her way up the ladder. But she cannot be evasive about ethics. ''I'm not terribly interested in spin,'' she says. ''I want the facts, I want the law, and once I have the goods, and have a principle worth fighting for, I do not let go. And nobody has told me to shut up. Besides, there's no elected official who would want to be known as anti-ethics.''</p>
        <p>Her mission, which has kept her at the board's Lafayette Street office six years beyond the one she signed on for, is to ''ensure the integrity of the whole city government.''</p>
        <p>A glance at her computer's screen saver shows her to be as incensed by cheats now as she was in school: ''We don't need no stinkin' badges,'' it proclaims. The line is borrowed from a Humphrey Bogart film, and she doesn't think she's taken it out of context.</p>
        <p>She hastens to note that most officials caught in a conflict accept their error and pay their fine. But some -- she calls them chiselers -- are unrepentant: ''Those who don't want to settle with us, who show no humility or haven't been sorry, those are the ones I fight the hardest.''</p>
        <p>She got her work-equals-esteem ethic from her mother, a teacher who supported the family after Ms. Salzman's father, a salesman, was hobbled by Parkinson's disease. ''She took me aside when I was 16 and said, 'Joanie baby, you have to have a profession, and I think you should become an international lawyer,' and ever the obedient child I said, 'O.K., Mom, what's that?' ''</p>
        <p>She found a mentor -- Jose A. Cabranes, a federal judge -- as an undergraduate at Yale. She clerked for him after Harvard Law School and joined Hughes, Hubbard &amp; Reed in 1983 only to leave in 1988 to avoid -- what else -- a potential conflict. Seems she'd fallen in love with and married a co-worker, Michael Salzman. Since he was senior, he stayed, she left. They have two children and live on the Upper West Side, where she likes to entertain friends.</p>
        <p>But Ms. Salzman, didn't you admit you don't make many friends in this job? A grin. ''My friends are not within my jurisdiction.'' Lucky for them.</p>
