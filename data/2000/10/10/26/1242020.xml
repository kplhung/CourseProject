        <p>Judge Leonard B. Sand of Federal District Court in Manhattan told a defendant in the embassy bombings case this week, ''I really don't want to get into a debate with you about the American system of justice.''</p>
        <p>The judge's comments came as he refused to accept a guilty plea from the defendant, who claimed that he had no chance of winning his case in an American court and did not want to undergo the humiliation of a trial.</p>
        <p>While the judge said he would not  be drawn into a debate on the fairness of American justice, in many ways the bombings case has become a continuing debate about that very issue, with some defendants essentially refusing to aid in their defense on religious grounds.</p>
        <p>A newly released court document showed that the case has forced Judge Sand to confront a series of legal and ethical quandaries that could have serious ramifications in the trial stemming from the 1998 bombings of United States embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. The blasts killed more than 200 people and injured thousands.</p>
        <p>For example, one defendant, Mohamed Rashed Daoud al-'Owahli, who faces the death penalty, instructed his lawyers last spring not to go to Washington to argue against capital punishment in the case.</p>
        <p>Last week, another defendant, Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, variously withdrew a motion to suppress his statements in his case, told the judge that he wanted new lawyers and said that he wanted to cross-examine a witness himself.</p>
        <p>Another defendant, Mohammed Saddiq Odeh, recently instructed his lawyers to withdraw an affidavit in which he claimed he had been coerced into giving statements to the authorities in Pakistan and Kenya after his arrest in the bombings.</p>
        <p>Mr. Odeh said that ''Islamic law prevented him from making accusations against the Pakistani, Kenyan or American governments before any tribunal other than the Islamic court,'' Judge Sand later wrote.</p>
        <p>Lawyers in the case declined comment. But lawyers who are not involved discussed Mr. Odeh's actions yesterday, and the impact they could have on his defense.</p>
        <p>''What you're witnessing here,'' said Steven M. Cohen, a defense lawyer and former federal prosecutor in Manhattan, ''is the question of whether a defendant has the right to engage in self-immolation in the service of what he perceives to be a greater purpose.''</p>
        <p>''The criminal justice system is not very comfortable with the concept of martyrdom,'' Mr. Cohen said.</p>
        <p>But another defense lawyer, Ronald L. Kuby, said such a move might be consistent with a defendant's broader goals.</p>
        <p>''Many political defendants seek to use their trial as the opportunity to make a political denunciation of the government of the United States,'' Mr. Kuby said. ''They see their trial as the opportunity to put the government on trial.''</p>
        <p>Judge Sand, in the court filing, observed that in the bombing case, deciding who makes decisions between a defendant and his lawyers ''is an extremely sensitive one which cannot be resolved by a simplistic reference'' to legal standards of the American Bar Association, which he said ''make no reference to a defendant's religious belief.''</p>
        <p>''Defendants' ardent adherence to Islamic law, as they understand it, permeates their actions and thinking,'' Judge Sand continued. ''One does not lightly disregard the firmly held religious belief of a defendant.''</p>
        <p>Judge Sand noted that such issues could not be considered without recognizing that under most circumstances, a defendant has a constitutional right to represent himself.</p>
        <p>Indeed, he said, Mr. Odeh had once advised the court that he wanted to represent himself but was now reconsidering the matter.</p>
        <p>The last time a defendant represented himself in such a big terrorism case in New York was in 1996, when Ramzi Ahmed Yousef defended himself on charges involving a plot to blow up American commercial airliners in East Asia. Mr. Yousef was convicted in that case, as well as in a later trial on charges stemming from the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center. In that case, he used a lawyer.</p>
        <p>Mr. Odeh, who has pleaded not guilty to charges stemming from the embassy bombings and a broader terrorism conspiracy, filed his affidavit along with an extensive motion that cited coercive police tactics during nearly three weeks of interrogation in Pakistan and Kenya.</p>
        <p>His instructions that his lawyers withdraw the affidavit led to disagreement among them, the judge noted. One lawyer, Sandra Babcock, was considering leaving the case, the judge said, because she believed the defense should pursue the motion even without Mr. Odeh's affidavit.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Odeh's lead counsel, Anthony L. Ricco, told the judge that he had advised Mr. Odeh that ''no papers would be filed on Mr. Odeh's behalf without his prior approval,'' Judge Sand wrote.</p>
        <p>The judge said that ''because of the sensitivity of the issue and its critical impact on future proceedings in this litigation,'' he would not issue ''a broad pronouncement that a client's wishes as to all matters must prevail,'' but would try to resolve such disputes on a case-by-case basis.</p>
