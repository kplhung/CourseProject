        <p>THE Internet might not be such a sad and lonely place after all.</p>
        <p>A new report from the University of California at Los Angeles released yesterday suggests that the common view of Internet users as withdrawn and antisocial ignores the reality of today's online population.</p>
        <p>The World Internet Project of the U.C.L.A. Center for Communication Policy surveyed more than 2,000 American households and found that, on average, those surveyed said the Internet increased their contact with others, including family members. More than one in four said they had online friends they had never met in person, and 12.4 percent of people who had made friends online said that they had gone on to meet online friends face to face.</p>
        <p>Family life has benefited as well, according to the study: Nearly all users (91.8 percent) said that since being connected to the Internet at home, members of the household had spent about the same amount of time or more time together. Nearly half of users said they spent at least some time each week using the Internet with other family members. ''People do not go online at the expense of their personal lives,'' said Jeffrey I. Cole, director of the U.C.L.A. center.</p>
        <p>What does get squeezed out of the Internet users' lives, apparently, is television. Web users reported they watched 28 percent less television than nonusers.</p>
        <p>The report joins a growing mountain of research on the ways that the Internet affects society. The new report compares Web users with those who have not gone online and also looks at Web use around the world.</p>
        <p>Professor Cole said that he and his colleagues had worked to eliminate the biases that could creep into survey-based research, throwing out questions that produced unreliable answers.</p>
        <p>The report also suggests that worries about a digital divide based on income might be overstated. Two-thirds of Americans have access to the Internet at home or at work, according to the survey. And although the very highly educated have the highest levels of Internet use, those with lower income and less education are signing on rapidly: more than half (53.1 percent) of those with only a high-school education use the Internet, and some 60 percent of adults with incomes of $15,000 to $49,000 use the Internet. Forty-one percent of adults with incomes under $15,000 are logging on.</p>
        <p>The survey, however, did find a substantial part of the population that is unlikely ever to join the online revolution: 16.8 percent of the people interviewed said they would not buy a computer at any price. They ''don't want to go online because everybody else is online,'' Professor Cole said.</p>
        <p>An earlier study from researchers at Carnegie Mellon University, begun in 1995 and published in 1998,  suggested that those who spend time online might feel more socially isolated and depressed.</p>
        <p>Robert Kraut, a professor of social psychology and human-computer interaction at Carnegie Mellon, suggested that both studies could be correct because in the five years since he began gathering data for his own Web project, the medium had been transformed. ''Five years ago you couldn't talk to your best friend or your mother online because they weren't online,'' he said.</p>
