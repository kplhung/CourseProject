        <p>When Denny Neagle walked off the mound in Shea Stadium last night, he may have been making his last appearance as a starting pitcher for the Yankees. If so, it must have been a bittersweet moment for Neagle, who becomes a free agent after this World Series. Certainly his removal was a bold and cold decision by Joe Torre, his manager, and it was a maneuver that worked out well.</p>
        <p>''I saw that look in his eye,'' Torre said. ''He was shocked.''</p>
        <p>He had his reason. When Neagle left, he had pitched pretty well, maybe well enough to get a victory. He had given up only two runs on four hits. There were two out and no men on base with Mike Piazza coming up in the fifth inning and his Yankees ahead, 3-2. The Yankees went on to defeat the Mets by that score to take a three-games-to-one lead in the four-of-seven-game Series. They can clinch it tonight at Shea.</p>
        <p>''I thought I was pitching well enough to still be in the game,'' Neagle said. ''I was disappointed. I didn't even know he was coming out until I turned around to get the ball back. I really did think he was going to talk about the situation.''</p>
        <p>Torre sometimes stays with his favored starters longer than he should, as was the case with Orlando Hernandez, the losing pitcher in Game 3. But Neagle, acquired by trade from Cincinnati in July, is not a particular favorite of Torre. The manager has even implied that Neagle does not challenge hitters as much as Torre would like. Neagle nibbles at the plate with his pitches.</p>
        <p>Worst of all, Neagle had given up a two-run home run in the third inning to Piazza, the Mets slugger. Torre did not want the left-handed Neagle to face Piazza again. So he replaced Neagle with David Cone, who got Piazza to pop out. Piazza was the only batter Cone faced.</p>
        <p>Although Neagle had given up only two runs, and the Mets never tied it or held the lead, Neagle was one out short of the minimum required for a starting pitcher to qualify for a victory. The winning pitcher in cases like these is determined by a decision of the official scorer. Bill Shannon, one of three official scorers, said the rules are firm.</p>
        <p>''If a starter does not go five innings, he is not eligible,'' Shannon said. ''That is not a judgment. The rules do not permit us to give the win to Denny Neagle.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees used four pitchers after Neagle. The victory was awarded to Jeff Nelson, who faced five batters. In that span, he gave up one hit and one walk; he retired two batters on a line-drive double play; he struck out one batter. He threw 12 strikes in 23 pitches.</p>
        <p>Regarding Torre's decision, Cone said: ''I was surprised.'' He said he had been told to warm up for Piazza, but expected to face him only if there was a man on base.</p>
        <p>Torre, who strode briskly to the mound with a determined gait when he took Neagle out, said, ''If something bad had happened, I never would have been able to forgive myself.'' From the context of the remark, he seemed to suggest that he was worried about something bad happening had he left Neagle in.</p>
        <p>In two previous playoff starts this year, Neagle was 0-2 with a 4.50 earned run average over 10 innings. ''I've done my job,'' Neagle said. ''I stand by that. I was the victim of a lack of run support.''</p>
