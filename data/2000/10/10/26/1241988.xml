        <p>For Nets point guard Stephon Marbury, these are the dog days of fall. Marbury has not gone full speed this preseason, assuming that nothing counts until opening night, Oct. 31.</p>
        <p>''Preseason is just practice,'' Marbury said today. ''That's all it is, to really be honest. You could go 7-0 or 8-0 and nobody cares about it.''</p>
        <p>Except his coach, Byron Scott, who apparently cares deeply. Scott publicly criticized his 23-year-old point guard today, a day after Marbury shot a dismal 3 for 17 in the Nets' 90-81 preseason loss to the Knicks. It was the Nets' fourth straight loss and dropped the team's preseason record to 1-4.</p>
        <p>''Steph really needs to get into it,'' Scott said. ''This is one of those preseasons where I think he's coasting. Instead of 110 percent, he's probably playing at 90. I don't think he's playing extremely hard offensively. Maybe he's just waiting for the regular season. I hope he can turn it on like that. I would really like to see him last game and next game start playing like the Stephon Marbury I know.''</p>
        <p>The Nets' final preseason game is Friday, against the Cleveland Cavaliers in Cincinnati, a homecoming for the team's top draft pick, Kenyon Martin. Scott also criticized Martin, from the University of Cincinnati, this week; Martin responded Tuesday with his first double-double (14 points, 11 rebounds) as a professional. Martin also absorbed a shot to the ribs that kept him out of practice today.</p>
        <p>Now it is Marbury's turn to respond. ''If coach says that I'm coasting, I'd better pick it up,'' Marbury said. He is shooting 32.8 percent in five exhibition games and averaging 12.2 points.</p>
        <p>Marbury had 13 assists and 8 rebounds on Tuesday, but those statistics were not as noticeable as his 3-for-17 shooting. He had shot 4 for 14 and 2 for 10 in earlier games. Scott said that Marbury was still finding his way with the offense.</p>
        <p>''I have to make shots,'' Marbury said. ''I'm playing hard defensively, but I haven't been attacking the basket. I really haven't been going into the lane, getting banged up like I normally do.''</p>
        <p>He drove hard twice out of frustration against the Knicks, showing more passion than he has exhibited much of the preseason. For Marbury, the memory of last year's 5-3 preseason, which was followed by a disappointing 31-51 regular season, is still vivid.</p>
        <p>Marbury led the Nets in scoring for seven of their eight preseason games last year, averaging nearly 29 points. ''I've just got this bitter taste from last year's preseason,'' he said. ''Guys are playing hard, then all of a sudden, it wasn't the same way. It's kind of hard when you know that it doesn't count. But next week, it's a whole other game. The vibes are totally different. I'll be more aggressive, way more.''</p>
        <p>REBOUNDS</p>
        <p>The Nets have a deadline of 6 p.m. Thursday to cut their roster to 15 players. They have 17 after waiving the rookie guard CHRIS ROBINSON  Wednesday. The rookie free agent KEVIN FREEMAN, who attended Paterson (N.J.) Catholic, could be next. That would leave the Nets with an extra player, and still overcrowded at backup point guard. The Nets like the free agent KEVIN OLLIE, but he does not have a guaranteed contract; SHERMAN DOUGLAS, in his 11th pro season, will make $1 million this year, and Elliot Perry, in his ninth year, will make $2.8 million. A trade is still possible. . . . Center JIM McILVAINE left practice early Wednesday with the stomach flu. Center EVAN ESCHMEYER missed the last 25 minutes with a mild asthma attack.</p>
