        <p>The noise from Hollywood, swaddled as it is in exuberant mumbo jumbo, is about agents for the stars also becoming their clients' managers, like a one-stop shopping mart. Isn't publishing about ready to enter the e-book, Internet era, in which new thoughts must be thought? Will the trend move east, and change the role of the literary agent? The author's agent as career planner? ''Hello, I'm Daniel Webster, Stephen Vincent Benet's career planner.''</p>
        <p>In the movies and television, agent and manager supposedly have two different roles, separated by law as well as tradition. In book publishing, literary agents for the most part  aren't changing the way they define their work as much as they are being pummeled by technology and events into doing more of what they have been doing all along, only in a wider universe. Many agents have always been career planners as well as deal makers. Nothing new there.</p>
        <p>Still, Robert Gottlieb, head of the newly formed Trident Media Group, said he believed that ''agents need to spend much more time doing something more than selling manuscripts.''</p>
        <p>''It's perfectly sensible for the business manager of authors to help find international financing for a variety of projects for the writer client,'' he said.</p>
        <p>What does that mean? Mr. Gottlieb's rap: Author has written a popular novel; a production company wants to turn the book into a television miniseries; author's agent/ manager helps production company find international financing for project. ''The benefit to the authors is that they get a much bigger piece of the financial pie,'' Mr. Gottlieb said. He also thinks the manager concept is helpful in turning authors into franchises. (More of that below.)</p>
        <p>But to other prominent authors' representatives, it's a rose by any other name. They don't see their assignment as being appreciably different from what it always was, and to them that includes doing much of what Mr. Gottlieb is proposing.</p>
        <p>What is new? Well now, there are  digital rights and e-book rights and Internet rights to be sold. Cyberspace.</p>
        <p>Andrew Wylie, the agent, said that agenting always involved career planning -- will this book project help or hurt the writer's career, regardless of the advance? -- and that now there are added buyers, the electronic world. ''What I see is sighs of relief in the publishing business for the foreseeable future,'' he said, since there's so little real change at the moment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wylie added: ''If an Internet company wants something from Elmore Leonard, it has to pay competitively with publishers. I'm happy to sell Contentville the rights to a short story, but let them try to make their offer more attractive than The New Yorker. And they don't hold the rights to the story any longer than anyone else would.''</p>
        <p>Well, this is a new area, but it isn't. It's still simply an agent selling and protecting his author. (Among other things, Contentville.com allows customers to search out material, from television transcripts to magazine articles to short stories, much of it previously published. But if it wants a new short story, for example, it will have to deal with the writer's agent. There are other similar Internet services.)</p>
        <p>Esther Newberg, a prominent agent, said that her agency had a group that spent most of its time studying and preparing for electronic publishing in whatever form it takes. ''We negotiate electronic fees with companies,'' she said. ''Each is different, just as each publishing house is different. We have a whole new world and none of us really knows what it will turn out to be.''</p>
        <p>Yet, like Mr. Wylie, she sees agenting the same way it always was. ''It's up to us to be ahead of the curve, to take this off the writer's back,'' she said. ''To be a manager always meant that was the person who went out and picked up the laundry.''</p>
        <p>Lynn Nesbit, another important agent, essentially agrees that agenting hasn't changed that much, despite the hype from Hollywood. She said: ''Of course, we're concerned with keeping ahead of the curve, attracting the younger readers who are used to video games and the Internet. The technology makes this an interesting time to be in the business, but for now the biggest change I see is that younger agents are doing more editing and giving more editorial advice than at any time in the last 25 years.''</p>
        <p>This whole discussion about the changing modes of literary agenting was probably touched off by Michael Ovitz's demise at Disney and subsequent startup of a management company for movie talent. (Before Disney he had founded and headed the movie industry's most powerful agency, the Creative Artists Agency.)</p>
        <p>In Hollywood, by state law, talent agents can only negotiate contracts for their clients; managers, unregulated, are only supposed to advise, not actually find employment for their clients. Although the typical movie star employs both, in practice the dividing line between agent and  manager is, like much in the movies, fantasy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ovitz, with his new company, appeared to be unabashedly doing both. He lured the megaselling author Tom Clancy from his William Morris literary agent, taking over what in essence will be a second Tom Clancy franchise of novels he will write, books for which he will be the co-author and books that he will conceive and oversee but have others write, as well as Mr. Clancy's future motion picture and television opportunities.</p>
        <p>If Mr. Ovitz could manage and  agent, wouldn't literary agents want to do the same? Indeed, three months ago Ms. Newberg helped negotiate the colossal deal with Sony Pictures for the film rights to Patricia Cornwell's 11 novels in which the medical examiner Dr. Kay Scarpetta is the central character.</p>
        <p>Was that book agenting or managing? Is there really any difference? Actually it was a fine example of the terse formula Mr. Wylie says is the nut of agenting: ''Limit the license and push up the fees. That's what it's all about.''</p>
