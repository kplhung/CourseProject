        <p>Congress approved a $100 million aid package to Serbia today, but made it contingent on the new Yugoslav government's cooperation in apprehending those indicted on charges of war crimes, including the country's former president, Slobodan Milosevic.</p>
        <p>The new money for Yugoslavia was contained in a $14.9 billion spending bill that includes foreign aid and was approved by a vote of 65 to 27 in the Senate and 302 to 101 in the House.</p>
        <p>While much of the attention surrounding the bill was focused on a provision ending restrictions on abortion-related activities of international family planning groups and a huge increase in the money made available to the poorest third world countries to reduce their debt, the bill contained a cornucopia of other items. Among them were these substantial outlays:</p>
        <p>*A $60 million increase in American military aid to Israel, pushing military assistance up to $1.9 billion -- the largest item in the foreign aid budget.</p>
        <p>*A jump in funds for international child survival and disease programs to $963 million, an increase of $248 million. The program includes $300 million for prevention and treatment of H.I.V./AIDS, mainly in Africa.</p>
        <p>*A $20 million increase in the budget of the Peace Corps, bringing its financing up to $265 million.</p>
        <p>*Increased funds for international narcotics control by $20 million, bringing the total up to $325 million.</p>
        <p>*About $135 million in disaster assistance for Southern Africa, including Mozambique, which was ravaged by floods this year.</p>
        <p>In addition to the increases in financing, the measure includes a number of contentious policy pronouncements. Among them is a requirement that after next March, American aid to Serbia will depend, among other things, on cooperation with the international war tribunal. Separate aid packages were voted for Serbia and Montenegro, the two components of Yugoslavia.</p>
        <p>In order to keep the aid flowing, the Yugoslavs must furnish documents related to war crimes, help in the location of witnesses and provide access for tribunal investigators. In addition, the government must provide help in the ''surrender and transfer of indictees or assistance in their apprehension.''</p>
        <p>''We want to support the new Serbian government,'' said Senator Patrick Leahy, a Vermont Democrat who pressed for the conditions on Serbian aid. ''But only if it respects the rights of its neighbors and human rights.''</p>
        <p>Congressional experts acknowledge that it may be difficult for Yugoslavia's new president, Vojislav Kostunica, and his deputies to comply with some of the provisions.</p>
        <p>''They don't have control of basic institutions,'' said one Congressional staff member. ''So the idea of cooperation with war crimes tribunal is problematic.''</p>
        <p>Congressional officials said that apart from the wording of the family-planning provisions of the spending bill, the administration had very little input in shaping the legislation.</p>
        <p>''We called O.M.B. an hour before we went to the floor and briefed them on what was in the bill,'' said one Congressional staff member referring the Office of Management and the Budget. ''That was it.''</p>
