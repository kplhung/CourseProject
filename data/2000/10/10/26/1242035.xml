        <p>Forced to campaign in his home state today, Vice President Al Gore framed his differences with Gov. George W. Bush of Texas on education by emphasizing his commitment to the public schools while criticizing Mr. Bush's proposals as ''half-measures'' and his Texas record as ''hollow.''</p>
        <p>After rallying their headquarters staff and attending a series of fund-raisers that brought in $4.3 million in Nashville on Tuesday night, Mr. Gore and his running mate, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, campaigned in two distinct media markets in central and western Tennessee today before the vice president flew to Kansas City for an evening rally.</p>
        <p>It is disconcerting for the Gore campaign that the vice president cannot take Tennessee and its 11 electoral votes for granted at this point, and that the Democratic National Committee has had to invest money in advertising there. But Mr. Gore and his aides have argued that the vice president's roots in Carthage, Tenn., and his 24-year political career in the state cannot be expected to overcome its recent political domination by Republicans.</p>
        <p>With Mr. Gore as his running mate, President Clinton won the state by only two percentage points in 1996 and by five percentage points in 1992. Its governor, both of its United States senators, and five of its nine members of Congress are Republicans.</p>
        <p>''I think Tennessee always is a competitive state in national races,'' Mr. Gore said today in an interview with WTVF in Nashville. ''This is a classic border swing state.''</p>
        <p>At a rally in Jackson, his grandmother's West Tennessee hometown, Mr. Gore asked how many relatives he had in the crowd and beamed when dozens of hands were raised.</p>
        <p>''You know from your own experience that I want to fight for you,'' he said. ''I have kept the faith with Tennessee. Now, here is what I'm asking from you. I am asking you to get out there in these next 13 days.''</p>
        <p>After summarizing his philosophy about the role of government on Tuesday, Mr. Gore turned his attention today to education in his address to students at Tennessee State University, a historically black college.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore outlined his proposals for using federal money to hire 100,000 new teachers, to reduce class sizes, to provide universal preschool to 4-year-olds, to provide families with tax deductions of up to $10,000 a year for college tuition, to force states and local school boards to change the administration of persistently failing schools and to increase testing of  students and teachers.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Gore devoted most of his remarks to arguing that Mr. Bush's support for private school vouchers would undermine public education, that his ''budget-busting tax cuts for the wealthiest'' demonstrate misplaced priorities and that the integrity of student testing in Texas was questionable.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush, he said, ''would give more in tax cuts to the wealthiest 90,000 multimillionaires than he would give in the form of all the new investments he has proposed to make in all 90,000 public schools combined.''</p>
        <p>As he has throughout the campaign, Mr. Gore rejected the concept of vouchers, which would provide some parents of children in poor-performing schools with grants to send their children to private schools.</p>
        <p>''Turning around failing schools isn't easy,'' he said. ''Our public schools aren't perfect and can't always turn on a dime. But we all have a moral obligation as Americans to help them and improve them and defend them, not just walk away from them.''</p>
        <p>Dan Bartlett, a spokesman for Mr. Bush, said Mr. Gore's comments defined him as ''the chief defender of the status quo in the public schools.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore laced his attack with provocative new metaphors. Mr. Bush's voucher plan, he said, would make Washington ''a national private school headmaster.'' Because not all students would receive help from vouchers, the plan amounts to ''education roulette,'' he said. Mr. Bush's opposition to spending federal money to hire thousands of new teachers, Mr. Gore added, ''is like trying to write on a blackboard without any chalk.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore also used the speech to make his first remarks about a study released this week by the RAND Corporation, a research organization in Santa Monica, Calif., that raised questions about the effectiveness of student testing in Texas.</p>
        <p>The study found that Texas students had demonstrated greater improvement in recent years on the state's Texas Assessment of Academic Skills exam than on the leading national assessment test. The report said these ''stark differences'' in performance raised ''serious questions'' about the credibility of the state test as a meaningful gauge of academic progress.</p>
        <p>The report speculated that the state test scores might have been artificially inflated by, among other things, a practice known in educational circles as teaching to the test, or drilling that helps students prepare for specific types of questions but does not result in real learning.</p>
        <p>Because Mr. Bush has made his educational record in Texas a hallmark of his campaign, the Gore forces have treated the RAND study as an October gift. Mr. Lieberman used it to attack Mr. Bush on Tuesday, and Mr. Gore took his turn today.</p>
        <p>''This is the bottom line,'' Mr. Gore said. ''We cannot afford to teach kids how to take a state test while leaving them with serious learning deficits. We cannot afford that kind of short-sighted shortcut in education policy any more than we can afford it in economic policy where we cannot afford to cook the books and bust our budget, leaving America with endless financial deficits.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore said practices like teaching to the test ''might elevate the reputations of school administrators and politicians but actually do nothing to really raise standards.''</p>
        <p>In His Own Words  AL GORE</p>
        <p>Remarks yesterday at Tennessee State University in Nashville:</p>
        <p>''To me, education is all about raising standards and expanding choices. Raising standards to help our children learn more and ultimately earn more in this new economy. Providing choices so that parents can help their children do better and go further with their own hard work and initiative.</p>
        <p>We should let all of our families have the choice of high-quality preschool for their kids, by making preschool available and by making child care more accessible and refocusing it on learning and by making high-quality preschool available on a voluntary basis to every 4-year-old in America.</p>
        <p>We should let all families have the choice of an excellent public school for their children with more public charter schools run by teachers and parents, free to adopt a cutting-edge curriculum and approach. And we should let every family have the chance and the choice of sending a son or daughter to college by making up to $10,000 a year of college tuition tax deductible.</p>
        <p>Now, my opponent, Governor Bush, has a different approach because he has different priorities. He would give more in tax cuts to the wealthiest 90,000 multimillionaires than he would give in the form of all the new investments he has proposed to make in all 90,000 public schools combined. . . .</p>
        <p>''There are only two real proposals of any substance in his entire education plan: private school vouchers and what he calls accountability. His vouchers, I believe, would actually harm education. And his claims to accountability rest on half-measures and a hollow record. In fact, the governor's private school vouchers would give no choice and no chance to the millions of children he would leave behind in failing schools.</p>
        <p>I believe we have to change and improve our public schools, not walk away from them. I believe that it is wrong to drain away public money from public schools that educate 90 percent of American children.</p>
        <p>Under the Bush plan, states would be forced to offer vouchers and finance them out of their budgets -- a brand new federal mandate -- whether states and local school districts like vouchers or not. . . . Governor Bush says he doesn't want a national superintendent of schools, but his mandatory voucher plan would make Washington, D.C., a national private school headmaster.''</p>
