        <p>Do not look for a Jets player among the league leaders for quarterback, receiver, running back, sacks or interceptions. The Jets are not ranked among the top offensive or defensive teams, either. There is only one place in a sea of statistics where one can easily find the Jets: atop the American Conference East.</p>
        <p>The Jets, with a 6-1 record, thrive on fourth-quarter comebacks. Their latest theatrical revival -- overcoming a 30-7 deficit on Monday night against the Miami Dolphins -- was not merely their fourth turnaround victory of the season, it was their seventh in the last 11 games.</p>

        <p>Do not look for a Jets player among the league leaders for quarterback, receiver, running back, sacks or interceptions. The Jets are not ranked among the top offensive or defensive teams, either. There is only one place in a sea of statistics where one can easily find the Jets: atop the American Conference East.</p>
        <p>The Jets, with a 6-1 record, thrive on fourth-quarter comebacks. Their latest theatrical revival -- overcoming a 30-7 deficit on Monday night against the Miami Dolphins -- was not merely their fourth turnaround victory of the season, it was their seventh in the last 11 games.</p>
        <p>In fact, going back to the midway point of last season, the Jets have won nine games in which they trailed in the fourth period. No other team comes close.</p>
        <p>''This team is mentally strong,'' quarterback Vinny Testaverde said. ''A lot of teams would have folded their tent last season. Then in the off-season we lost Bill Parcells and Keyshawn Johnson and Bill Belichick. Really, the whole defensive staff.''</p>
        <p>The Jets are the only A.F.C. East team without a divisional defeat (4-0), and they can put even more distance between themselves and the rest of this tough division with a victory Sunday against the Bills at Buffalo.</p>
        <p>Togetherness and mental toughness may be a cliche, but it has become a standard for players such as running back Curtis Martin. Today Martin said that he looked at the Giants Stadium scoreboard late Monday night, with that outrageous deficit, and the numbers told him something else.</p>
        <p>''The only thing I thought of when I was looking at the scoreboard, I couldn't think of myself at 5-2,'' he said. ''All I could think of was 6-1. This is a collective mentality. We've come back so often. That whole day I was thinking 6-1.''</p>
        <p>Imagine that. Imagine that before last season, the Jets were the worst fourth-quarter comeback team in football in the 90's.</p>
        <p>But as Bills quarterback Doug Flutie said today, reflecting on comebacks: ''There's something about your back to the wall, and guys step it up. Plus, when you've done it in the past, it gives you confidence in those situations.''</p>
        <p>Brad Banta, the long snapper and one of the newer Jets, played for a Colts' team in 1995 that specialized in comebacks. Twice they won after being down by 24-3 in the third quarters -- at the Jets and at Miami.</p>
        <p>''I've kind of been associated with a comeback team before,'' said Banta, who got so excited on one special-teams' play that he was flagged for two penalties. ''One thing here you really see is everybody is accountable for their actions. You can look guys in the eye. These guys believe, and that's what you need. On the sidelines, there wasn't much talking, just a sense of urgency. Guys knowing what they have to do.''</p>
        <p>Left tackle Jason Fabini, who helped protect Testaverde (1 sack in 59 passing attempts), said: ''It's just resolve. Maybe the past performances have something to do with it. I think some of it may have carried over from last season, when we started 1-6 and wound up 8-8.''</p>
        <p>Cornerback Aaron Glenn, whose defense has kept the Jets close most of the season, said admiringly of his colleagues, ''I look forward to seeing what the offense is doing in the fourth quarter.''</p>
        <p>That fourth quarter has produced 74 points in seven games -- only the 7-0 Vikings, with 78 points, have more. The Jets have scored almost half of their point total this season in the fourth period.</p>
        <p>The Jets' No. 1 draft pick, Shaun Ellis, recalled a comeback victory for his college team, Tennessee, over Arkansas two years ago.</p>
        <p>''I experienced some of this at the college level,'' he said. ''But I never experienced anything like Monday night. There's just something special about this team. Coach Groh kept telling us, 'Keep fighting, fighting.' ''</p>
        <p>Now the fight continues at Orchard Park, N.Y., against a Bills team coached by Wade Phillips.</p>
        <p>''I watched Monday's game till it was 30-7,'' said Phillips, who then turned off the television. ''But I thought Dewey won, too.''</p>
        <p>Actually, Phillips was not the only one who got the result wrong. Two major newspapers' Web sites posted blurbs that said the Dolphins had won.</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>JOHN ABRAHAM, a pass-rushing specialist, will miss the Bills game because of an abdominal muscle pull. . . . The Bills have lost three road games to teams with a combined 18-3 record, WADE PHILLIPS said.  . . . The Jets have added wide receiver SHANNON MYERS to the practice squad.</p>
