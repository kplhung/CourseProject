        <p>WHEN Al Groh described his halftime tirade during the Jets' 40-37 Monday night classic victory over the Miami Dolphins in overtime, he smiled.</p>
        <p>''I sang 'em a lullaby,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Not really; a lullaby puts a baby to sleep. This lullaby would have burned little kids' ears. It woke up all those big babies in green-and-white uniforms who fell behind, 30-7, before their fourth-quarter explosion on four of Vinny Testaverde's five touchdown passes.</p>
        <p>More important, this lullaby showed not only that the Jets' new head coach is in command, but also that his players will play hard for him.</p>
        <p>In short, it showed that Al Groh is a good coach, that he is maintaining the Jets' level of success that Bill Parcells created after all those previous seasons of frustration and futility.</p>
        <p>''We knew Al as the linebackers coach for three years,'' defensive end Ernie Logan said at the Jets' complex, ''but we didn't know him as a head coach, particularly what he would be like in adversity when you have to take control and demand respect from your players. He's doing that. You have to tell 'em what you want and if you don't get it, demand it. I like that.''</p>
        <p>Anybody can be a good rookie head coach when all is going smoothly, as it was when the Jets jumped to a 4-0 start with theatrical triumphs over the New England Patriots and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. But after a flat, disappointing 20-3 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers, suddenly Groh was faced with his first test: get the Jets back on track against New England.</p>
        <p>The Jets won, 34-17.</p>
        <p>Then, on Monday night, Groh faced an even tougher test: win a game that appeared lost.</p>
        <p>And he got an even higher mark.</p>
        <p>''We hadn't seen Al that angry,'' Curtis Martin, the thoughtful running back, said. ''We realized we were embarrassing the coach. That sparked guys. His emotion sparked us. It made us angry because what he was saying was true.''</p>
        <p>One Jet was quoted as saying that Groh growled that the nation was watching ''a bunch of pathetic losers,'' a harsh phrase the coach yesterday denied saying and a phrase that does not fit.</p>
        <p>The Jets' resiliency is a tribute to their core of players who developed in 1998 when the team went to the American Football Conference championship game, a core that hardened in its 7-2 finish last season after the team got over the shock of losing Testaverde in the opener with a torn Achilles' tendon. But not every new coach would have succeeded so quickly.</p>
        <p>''The team has taken to Al,'' Martin said. ''He's not what I would call an outcast coach. When he says something, players operate with his mentality because he's so much a part of us. I'm an observer and when I observe Al, I see the character in him. I take to that because that's what I believe in my heart. You believe in him because you know he's in your corner.''</p>
        <p>Not long after Parcells chose Groh as his successor, after Bill Belichick's defection to the Patriots, Parcells decided not to retire. He would stay on as the director of football operations.</p>
        <p>Parcells wanted to be there for Groh during his transition to head coach after having been on Parcells's staff with the Jets, the Giants and the Patriots.</p>
        <p>''I want this guy to succeed,'' Parcells said at the time.</p>
        <p>For all of the advice Parcells may or may not have quietly given to Groh so far, Groh is basically succeeding on his own. Except for being in his office in the Jets' complex, Parcells has virtually been invisible. He has not even attended any of the Jets' games, thereby eliminating the opportunity for anybody to think he is looking over Groh's shoulder.</p>
        <p>Parcells's coaching philosophy was always simple. ''Give 'em a good design,'' he often said, ''and get 'em to play hard.''</p>
        <p>Groh has done both, although he does need to get the Jets to play hard a little earlier during games so that these fourth-quarter comebacks will not be necessary. And looking to Sunday's game in Buffalo, he now faces another test: he needs to bring the Jets down to earth after Monday night's classic comeback.</p>
        <p>''It's like I told the players,'' Groh said yesterday. ''It's time to get on with the present.''</p>
        <p>Martin understood.</p>
        <p>''You can't go forward, looking backward,'' the running back said.</p>
