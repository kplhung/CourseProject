        <p>As columns of black smoke rose all across this city, tens of thousands of people poured into chaotic streets today and converged on the center of Abidjan, overthrowing the military ruler, Gen. Robert Guei, one day after he declared himself the winner of a disputed presidential election.</p>
        <p>The whereabouts of General Guei, who seized power last year in a Christmas Eve coup in one of the few African countries never to have experienced military rule, are unclear. Soldiers and the security forces who turned against the general today did not find him in the presidential palace here.</p>
        <p>With the popular revolt, a fierce political battle now looms.</p>
        <p>The general's main opponent in the election held on Sunday, Laurent Gbagbo, declared himself president today, and on the state television tonight, the army chief of staff, Gen. Soumaila Diabakate, said the armed forces were now behind Mr. Gbagbo.</p>
        <p>But at least one of the main political parties said it would not recognize the results and called for a new election. The balloting on Sunday, which many Ivoirians and Western governments considered deeply flawed, excluded major party candidates and was boycotted by large portions of the population.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, a disastrous 10-month-long period of military dictatorship in this former French colony appears to have reached its end, raising the possibility that the Ivory Coast may reassume its traditional role as a regional economic and political anchor.</p>
        <p>Today, in what quickly became one of the few times that a popular uprising in support of a democratic process had dislodged a dictator in Africa, ordinary residents of this West African nation pushed through military barricades erected around the city center and the site of the presidential palace.</p>
        <p>The protesters, many of them marching in flip-flops, were unarmed. Many painted their faces white and wore twigs with leaves around their foreheads in the belief that it would keep them safe from harm. Soldiers loyal to General Guei (pronounced gay) fired into the air, and then into the surging crowds. But other soldiers stood by with their arms crossed in front of a military barrack. Eventually, the paramilitary gendarmes joined the civilians in opposing the military government, and most soldiers could be seen siding with protesters or remaining neutral. Mr. Gbagbo's party said 60 people had been killed in violence since Tuesday.</p>
        <p>''The mistake Guei made was to let us watch scenes from Belgrade,'' said Alfred Tohouri, 31, a student, referring to the fall of Slobodan Milosevic in Yugoslavia, where an uprising forced him to admit he had been defeated in a contested election.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tohouri was making his way through thick crowds of people who had stopped for a moment this morning about 500 feet in front of an army tank in the city center. ''Ah!'' he added. ''The people have stood up like one man. We have been marginalized too long, lied to too often.''</p>
        <p>Half an hour later, scores of gendarmes wrested away the state television building from loyalist soldiers, an event that also echoed the Yugoslav revolt. ''The TV station has been freed!'' a civilian near the building shouted into his cell phone as the crackle of automatic gunfire made him duck. A truck filled with heavily armed gendarmes rumbled toward the station, cheered on by onlookers who reached up to shake their hands. In front of the television building, scores of protesters tore down a shack that had been used by the soldiers and then danced on its crumpled aluminum roof.</p>
        <p>''We are free!'' shouted Hermann Karamo, one of the protesters. ''It's freedom for the Ivory Coast!''</p>
        <p>Then just before 1 p.m., Mr. Gbagbo, the opposition leader who had been leading in the ballot tally before General Guei, who took advantage of a mutiny by unpaid soldiers last year to overthrow the unpopular president, Henri Konan Bedie, canceled the vote-counting on Tuesday, appeared on the state television.</p>
        <p>''The Ivory Coast could not accept this electoral coup d'etat,'' Mr. Gbagbo said in a four-minute speech in which he declared himself the country's new president. ''That is why I called on you to resist.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gbagbo said he now controlled the military, called for national reconciliation and said he would soon form a government.</p>
        <p>Across Abidjan this afternoon, people flashed ''V'' signs.</p>
        <p>Despite the euphoria, many questions remained unanswered as night fell over the city. General Guei was reported to have fled to nearby Benin with his family. But then the army chief of staff, General Diabakate, told journalists that General Guei was still in the presidential palace.</p>
        <p>General Diabakate seemed to accept the reality of the popular uprising. He called on all soldiers to return to their barracks, telling Ivoirians that ''the armies of the Ivory Coast have heard you.''</p>
        <p>Politically, the country remains as divided as ever, and there were no signs tonight that Mr. Gbagbo's declaration that he was president or his call for reconciliation would be heeded. Mr. Gbagbo's party, the Ivoirian Popular Front, is the third largest, behind the Democratic Party of the Ivory Coast and the Rally of the Republicans -- both of which were excluded from Sunday's election.</p>
        <p>''We must hold another election with the participation of all the candidates,'' said Ali Coulibaly, the spokesman for the Rally of Republicans, in a telephone interview. ''Guei proclaimed himself president yesterday, and Gbagbo proclaimed himself president today. The president of the country must be chosen by the people.''</p>
        <p>Members of the Rally of the Republicans marched here and through the northern cities of Bouake and Korhogo late this afternoon, calling for a new election. The party's candidate, Alassane D. Ouattara, a former prime minister and a former deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund in Washington, was disqualified from running in Sunday's election by a court controlled by General Guei.</p>
        <p>It will be particularly difficult for a reconciliation between Mr. Ouattara and Mr. Gbagbo. A onetime ally of Mr. Ouattara, Mr. Gbagbo turned against him last year and adopted a xenophobic platform aimed at rallying Christian southerners like himself against Muslim northerners like Mr. Ouattara.</p>
        <p>About 40 percent of the population are Muslims, and most of them boycotted Sunday's election, whose two major candidates and three minor ones were all Christian southerners.</p>
        <p>The court also eliminated the candidate of the Democratic Party of the Ivory Coast, whose officials had earlier rejected General Guei's attempt to become its candidate.</p>
        <p>Western nations condemned the court's verdict, withdrawing financial support from the election, which they called illegitimate from the start. The two major Ivoirian parties boycotted Sunday's election, and turnout appeared very low.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, after preliminary results showed that General Guei was trailing Mr. Gbagbo, the junta dissolved the National Electoral Commission and the general declared himself the winner. The announcement immediately sent protesters into the streets.</p>
        <p>What is more, soldiers loyal to General Guei clashed with other soldiers inside a military camp on the outskirts of Abidjan. Heavy firing could be heard from the camp until the predawn hours.</p>
        <p>As soon as the sun rose this morning, tens of thousands of ordinary Ivoirians began marching from working-class neighborhoods surrounding the city center. In lines stretching several miles, the demonstrators moved through avenues littered with broken shop stands, burnt cars and burning tires. Supporters of Mr. Gbagbo were joined by Ivoirians from the north and other regions.</p>
        <p>The crowds moved forward, turning back when soldiers fired.</p>
        <p>''They fired in the air first, and when we didn't turn back they fired at us,'' said Roland Degre, a marcher who was running away from the city center in a large crowd. ''Guei fired on us.''</p>
        <p>Another marcher, Alain Djahouri, said: ''Two people were killed. They shot one in the face. They shot another in the chest.''</p>
        <p>And yet despite those two deaths, and the deaths of others today, the crowds kept surging forward toward the city center. At a spot not too far from the presidential palace, thousands of marchers had been stopped at a barricade beyond which soldiers waited in a tank.</p>
        <p>''I'm here because I have two sons in their 30's who are sitting at home with no future in this country,'' said Jean-Yves LePrince, a gray-bearded 51-year-old. ''I'm here for them. We must take back this country.''</p>
