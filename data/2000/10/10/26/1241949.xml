        <p>A federal judge yesterday agreed to postpone a court battle in which the Justice Department is trying to force Northwest Airlines to sell its controlling stake in Continental Airlines.</p>
        <p>The closely watched antitrust trial was set to begin in Detroit today, two years after the Justice Department filed its complaint. But Federal District Judge Denise Page Hood pushed back the start of the trial to Nov. 1 at the request of Northwest, which asked for time to try to settle the case.</p>
        <p>The stakes are high for all sides in the trial, which many experts believe will help determine the future shape of the airline industry. The Justice Department is also examining the proposed $4.3 billion bid for the US Airways Group by the UAL Corporation, the parent of United Airlines, which could also end up in the courts.</p>
        <p>Northwest, the country's fourth-largest airline, bought the controlling stake in Continental, the fifth-largest carrier, in early 1998 for $430 million from a partnership controlled by investor David Bonderman. The shares represent 14 percent of Continental's equity but hold a majority of the voting rights.</p>
        <p>Northwest said it bought the stake only to keep it away from a rival bidder, Delta Air Lines, so that it could protect its budding marketing alliance with Continental. It placed the stock in a trust that limits its rights over the shares until 2008.</p>
        <p>But the government charged that the deal still amounted to a takeover that would inhibit competition between the two carriers and place Continental managers under their future bosses at Northwest.</p>
        <p>Both airlines vigorously disputed that when the government filed its original lawsuit. But they have since grown apart. Earlier this year, Gordon M. Bethune, Continental's chief executive, said that he would like to buy the shares back from Northwest. Northwest has declined to sell.</p>
        <p>Continental then decided to side with the government against Northwest, its co-defendant, at the trial. Northwest recently received permission from the court to treat Continental executives as hostile witnesses, giving its lawyers the latitude to cross-examine them.</p>
        <p>That sets the stage for what could be an ugly confrontation harmful to both airlines and their marketing alliance, which both sides agree is lucrative. Up to now, most of the charges and counter charges in the case have been under court seal.</p>
        <p>Northwest could attack the integrity of Continental executives who have contradicted themselves in  statements by first supporting Northwest and then the government. Continental in turn may present evidence of heavy-handed intrusions by Northwest to show that it broke its promises to respect the airline's independence.</p>
        <p>Northwest and the Justice Department held exhaustive and ultimately fruitless settlement talks before the government filed its lawsuit two years ago. After the talks broke down, Northwest said that the government did not object to it owning a stake in Continental but that it demanded that Northwest give up majority voting rights. It also objected to Northwest's insistence on retaining the right to vote its shares if a third party tries to take over or merge with Continental.</p>
        <p>Officials at both Northwest and the Justice Department's antitrust division declined to comment yesterday.</p>
        <p>Northwest has repeatedly tried to delay the trial leading some to question the sincerity of their interest in a settlement. But now that Continental has sided with the government it may be easier for Northwest to work out a deal with Continental that will then satisfy the Justice Department.</p>
        <p>''Although this may simply be a litigation tactic,'' said Ned Walker, a spokesman for Continental, ''if Northwest is truly serious, we are encouraged. And if they are not, we will see them in federal court next week.''</p>
