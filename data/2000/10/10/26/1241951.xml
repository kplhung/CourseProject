        <p>America Online today asked a federal appeals court for permission to file a supporting brief in the appeal of the Microsoft antitrust case, noting that the plaintiffs in the case -- the federal government and 19 states -- support the idea while Microsoft opposes it.</p>
        <p>An America Online executive testified on behalf of the government during the trial, and Microsoft called him back as a hostile witness during the trial's rebuttal phase.</p>
        <p>In its filing today, the company did not say what its brief might discuss, and an AOL spokesman would not comment, though it is clear that the brief will support the government's argument and a federal judge's rulings against Microsoft.</p>
        <p>In June, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson of the United States District Court found that Microsoft had violated antitrust laws and ordered it to be broken in two. Last month, the Supreme Court refused to consider a direct appeal of Judge Jackson's rulings and sent the case to the appeals court.</p>
        <p>Today's court filing notes that AOL now owns Netscape, which the judge's rulings described as the primary victim of Microsoft's behavior. And America Online adds that the case raises ''important legal issues, and the resolution of those issues not only will shape the development of antitrust law into the future, but is likely to have a significant impact on the continued development of the Internet as an empowering tool for consumers everywhere.''</p>
        <p>Separately today, both Microsoft and the government filed briefs with the appeals court commenting on the court's decision last week to take a briefing from a technology expert on some of the technical questions underlying the case.</p>
        <p>On Oct. 18, the appeals court invited Michael H. Hites, chief technology officer of the Illinois Institute of Technology, to a briefing session tentatively scheduled for Nov. 14. Representatives of Microsoft and the government are also invited to attend.</p>
        <p>The court said the session would not delve specifically into the issues relating to the case but would instead explore ''basic concepts underlying the fundamentals of automation.''</p>
        <p>In a court filing today, Microsoft said the company ''welcomes the court's interest in the technical subjects underlying this appeal and believes that the background provided by the review session will assist the court in resolving the case.''</p>
        <p>But then the brief questioned Dr. Hites's qualifications.</p>
        <p>''It is not apparent from Dr. Hites's resume what knowledge or experience he has with personal computer operating systems,'' the company wrote, adding that Sun Microsystems, a fierce competitor, once sponsored a piece of research by Dr. Hites.</p>
        <p>The Justice Department offered cautious support of the review session and Dr. Hites. But the government's brief stressed that the review session should not even tangentially address issues in the case.</p>
        <p>The government said it wanted to use one of its trial witnesses as a representative at the session, while Microsoft said trial witnesses should be excluded. So, as with other stages in the case, numerous disagreements remain to be settled before the session can be held.</p>
