        <p>CBS has agreed to pay $8 million to about 200 of its female technicians who said in a class-action lawsuit that they had been sexually harassed and discriminated against at six CBS stations.</p>
        <p>The lawsuit was filed in 1996. The employees said their managers had unfairly denied them favorable assignments, promotions and opportunities to work overtime, instead favoring their male colleagues. They also said they were subjected to a work environment generally hostile to women.</p>

        <p>CBS has agreed to pay $8 million to about 200 of its female technicians who said in a class-action lawsuit that they had been sexually harassed and discriminated against at six CBS stations.</p>
        <p>The lawsuit was filed in 1996. The employees said their managers had unfairly denied them favorable assignments, promotions and opportunities to work overtime, instead favoring their male colleagues. They also said they were subjected to a work environment generally hostile to women.</p>
        <p>The women were employed as camera operators, film editors, equipment maintainers and in other technical positions at the CBS stations in Minneapolis, New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Detroit and Green Bay, Wis.</p>
        <p>Under the terms of the settlement, CBS, which is now a unit of Viacom, agreed not only to pay the women $8 million, but also to institute new procedures to ensure that all of its stations' technical workers have equal access to promotion, overtime opportunities and assignments.</p>
        <p>In a statement, the network denied any wrongdoing, but, citing legal costs, said it was agreeing to the terms of the settlement so that it could put the charges ''behind us.''</p>
        <p>Last October, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission said that it had found the CBS stations had discriminated against the female technicians. The commission had also filed its own lawsuit against CBS. It was settled yesterday as well, under the same terms as the class-action lawsuit.</p>
        <p>The settlements are subject to the approval of a federal judge.</p>
        <p>Susan E. Stokes, a lawyer for the women, said the amount of money each worker would receive from the settlement would be based upon length of service and her specific complaint.</p>
