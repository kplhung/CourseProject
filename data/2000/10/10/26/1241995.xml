        <p>NEW YORK</p>
        <p>WHITE PLAINS: CONVICTION IN 1994 DEATH  After years of silence from a crowd of witnesses, a Yonkers man was convicted of second-degree murder yesterday in the stabbing death of a college student. The man, Anthony DiSimone, 33, could be sentenced to 25 years to life for stabbing Louis Balancio, 21, outside a bar in Yonkers on Feb. 4, 1994, said Jeanine F. Pirro, the Westchester County district attorney. More than 20 people saw the crime, but no one would testify for three years. Some suspects, including Mr. DiSimone, were thought to have ties to organized crime. More than 30 arrests have been made in the case, Mrs. Pirro said.</p>

        <p>ALBANY: McCALL FAULTS INSPECTION LAW  A new law requiring annual inspections of retail food stores raises concerns over how the requirement would be met because the state already has a serious backlog of under-inspected sites, H. Carl McCall, the state comptroller, said yesterday. He cited a 1999 audit his office conducted finding that nearly a third of the 28,000 food establishments in the state had not been inspected on time during the previous year.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: A NEW TOURISM PROMOTION  Hoping to capitalize on the attention the Subway Series has brought the city, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani announced a new city-sponsored radio campaign yesterday that will be broadcast in several large cities. The commercials, narrated by the mayor, promote the period from Jan. 5 through Feb. 28, a traditionally slow time for tourism, as an opportunity for hotel discounts and varied cultural attractions.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: GUARDS AT HOSPITALS  The president of the Teamsters local that represents security guards at New York City's public hospitals urged the City Council yesterday to enact legislation that would block the Giuliani administration's plans to privatize security at those hospitals. Carroll Haynes, president of Local 237 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, said he feared that the 850 officers now working for the Health and Hospitals Corporation would be replaced. The mayor's office expects privatization to cut costs, but Mr. Haynes said he doubted that the performance of the private security guards would be as good as that of the current police.</p>

        <p>PEARL RIVER: MORE PARKING AT STATION  Parking at the Pearl River train station in Rockland County will be substantially expanded under renovations to begin in late December, officials said. The $1.2 million project will add 125 parking spots to the current 140. Many of the 300 daily commuters who use the station have had difficulty finding parking.</p>

        <p>ALBANY: GAS RATE REGULATION  The New York State Public Service Commission formally took steps yesterday to regulate or reduce natural gas costs for customers supplied by Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation. The commission approved a multiyear rate and restructuring plan in July submitted by Niagara Mohawk that either decreases or freezes delivery charges on almost all gas bills for its customers through Aug. 31, 2003. It also provides for the restructuring of Niagara Mohawk's gas operations to foster more competition.</p>

        <p>YONKERS: MAN HIT BY TRAIN  As many as 7,000 riders were delayed when a northbound Metro-North Railroad train struck a man yesterday on the tracks near the Ludlow station, a Metro-North spokesman said. About 6 p.m, a train on the Hudson line about a car length north of the station struck a man, who was later taken to a local hospital with a gash on his head, said Dan Brucker, the spokesman said. Power to the tracks was shut off from 6:15 to 6:34 p.m. Eight trains going in both directions were delayed for 25 to 50 minutes, and the train that struck the man was delayed for 40 minutes, Mr. Brucker said. The eight-car train, carrying 1,000 passengers, was bound for Poughkeepsie, due to arrive at 7:12 p.m.</p>

        <p>NEW JERSEY</p>
        <p>TRENTON: COURT AFFIRMS BALLOT MEASURE  The New Jersey Supreme Court ruled yesterday that a ballot measure that asks voters to establish a permanent taxpayer-financed transportation fund could remain on the ballot. The question, which seeks to dedicate $3.75 billion for road improvements and mass transit in the state, will appear on the ballot Nov. 7. While not opposing its substance, the League of Women Voters had challenged the ballot measure's wording, saying it asks voters to approve two constitutional amendments in a single question. Two lower courts had previously ruled that the question did not violate the state constitution. If approved, the measure would funnel part of the state's sales and gasoline tax to highway and public transportation projects.</p>

        <p>NEWARK: POLICE ACCUSED IN AUTO THEFT  Two police officers were indicted yesterday on charges that they were part of an auto theft ring that dismantled stolen cars and sold the parts, officials said. The officers, Douglas Boyce III, 30, and Jose Correa, 29, were arrested after a three-month investigation into allegations that a group of Newark officers were collaborating with thieves who stole cars in nearby towns. A grand jury did not bring charges against a third officer, and five others face departmental charges, among them neglect of duty and making false statements. During the investigation, undercover officers bought stolen wheel rims from Officer Boyce and both he and Officer Correa, residents of Newark, were found to be driving cars that had stolen parts.</p>

        <p>HARTFORD: NEW HEAD OF SCHOOL BOARD  A former speaker of the state's House of Representatives, Tom Ritter, will next month become chairman of the state-appointed board of trustees charged with running Hartford's ailing public schools, Gov. John G. Rowland announced yesterday. Mr. Ritter, 47, a Democrat who represented the city in the General Assembly for 18 years until leaving office in 1999, will succeed the board's current chairman, Robert M. Furek. Governor Rowland, a Republican, also appointed six other new board members. The board is legally required to disband in June 2002, when voters will elect a local board of education.</p>

        <p>UNCASVILLE: TRIBE TO SPEND $1 BILLION  The Mohegan Indian tribe has increased its casino spending plans to nearly $1 billion. The estimated cost of expanding its Mohegan Sun casino has risen to $960 million from $800 million, said Peter Schultz, vice chairman of the tribal council. A new gambling salon with 2,550 slot machines and additional table games is scheduled to be completed by October 2001. In all, the number of slot machines at the casino would double, to 6,227. The tribe is also building a 10,000-seat arena and a 1,200-room hotel.</p>
