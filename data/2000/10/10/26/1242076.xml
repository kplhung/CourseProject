        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As the principal of P.S. 287, I would like to add my voice to the discussion about the benefits of e-mail mentoring (''E-Mail Gives Students More Choices for Career Advice,'' Oct. 12). Our elementary school began an e-mail mentoring program with the employees of the Securities Industries Automation Corporation in 1993 to improve our young students' reading and writing skills.</p>

        <p>As the principal of P.S. 287, I would like to add my voice to the discussion about the benefits of e-mail mentoring (''E-Mail Gives Students More Choices for Career Advice,'' Oct. 12). Our elementary school began an e-mail mentoring program with the employees of the Securities Industries Automation Corporation in 1993 to improve our young students' reading and writing skills.</p>
        <p>SIAC's volunteers serve as mentors and role models, and help students review math, social studies and other assignments.</p>
        <p>For primarily economic reasons, most of our students do not have access to computers outside school. The use of e-mail as the primary communications tool between mentor and ''mentee,'' as opposed to the traditional face-to-face relationship, gives our studens an early, non-threatening exposure to technology. And the supportive, personalized attention of an e-mail mentoring relationship provides students with the most important benefit of all: increased self-esteem.</p>
