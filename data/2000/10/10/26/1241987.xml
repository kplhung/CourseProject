        <p>The bond markets appear to be signaling that America should be more worried about an economic slowdown than about the prospects of higher inflation. Are bond investors -- who have been pretty good at spying clouds on the horizon well before the rest of the world -- right this time?</p>
        <p>On Monday, investors retreating to the safe haven of United States Treasury securities pushed yields to their lows for the year. Government bonds have weakened a bit since then, but the yield on the five-year Treasury note, at 5.72 percent, is down from 5.9 percent in early October. The security maturing in two years is yielding 5.89 percent.</p>
        <p>At the same time, high-yield bonds issued by corporations have plunged in price and rocketed in yield. The Merrill Lynch high-yield corporate bond index carried a yield of 13.24 percent yesterday; in September 1998, when economies around the world seemed at the precipice, the yield was just 10.28 percent.</p>
        <p>You would expect a flight to Treasuries as investors react to the unrest in the Middle East, the ravaging of technology stocks and recent problems at old-line companies like Eastman Kodak and Xerox. The surprise is that the Treasury market's meteoric rise -- and the corresponding fall in yields -- comes at a time when inflation is rising.</p>
        <p>Today's announcement of the employment cost index, a closely watched inflation measure, will give the market more information about where costs are headed. But from other data it is already clear that inflation is higher than it has been in a decade.</p>
        <p>Yet real returns on government bonds -- that is, returns adjusted for inflation -- are at extremely low rates of around 2.5 percent, down from around 4 percent earlier this year. Numbers like those are hardly what you would expect from a market worried about rising prices.</p>
        <p>Why parse the numbers so closely? For investors interested in divining where the economy is headed, the bond market's gyrations have been worth following in recent years. For example, in December 1994, when the economy was growing at 3.5 percent, yields on the 10-year Treasury bond peaked around 7.81 percent and began to slip, reaching about 6.2 percent six months later. What bond investors had spied was a decline in economic growth in the United States. By the end of 1995, growth had fallen to 2 percent.</p>
        <p>Bond investors have also signaled significant risks in the financial system in recent years. In 1998, for example, the bond market bottomed in May and by July had moved up almost a half percentage point, driving yields lower. A month later, news that Russia had defaulted on its debt rocked the markets -- tremors that worsened with the bailout in September of the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund. In retrospect, it is clear the bond market had sensed the speculative excesses in both the United States and overseas.</p>
        <p>Some observers dismiss the rising price of bonds as solely the result of the government's repurchases of Treasury debt. With investors chasing fewer bonds, they argue, bond prices are sure to rise. But others say this cannot be the whole story, if only because investors have been aware of the government buybacks for months.</p>
        <p>Unlike in 1998, the bond market is not foretelling systemic risk, says Stan Jonas, managing director at Fimat U.S.A., a brokerage firm in New York. Rather, he contends, it is reacting to more specific risks associated with individual companies, like Xerox, that are experiencing problems with earnings or with their overall businesses.</p>
        <p>''It's a very different horror show than before,'' Mr. Jonas said. ''It's about creative destruction. People are very frightened about individual credit risk; they don't know which one of these companies will survive.''</p>
        <p>Still, falling Treasury bond yields have often presaged a recession or an economic slowdown. Some economists have begun to fear that the Federal Reserve will not be able to manage the wished-for economic soft landing -- and to warn that investors should get ready for a bumpy ride.</p>
        <p>Stephen S. Roach, chief economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, worries that events in the Middle East could transform an orderly increase in energy prices into a classic oil shock. ''That's the stuff of recession,'' he said, ''a shock that hits the economy when it is already on a slippery down-slope.'' Mr. Roach said he thinks a hard landing by the middle of next year is highly probable.</p>
        <p>If Mr. Roach is right, the Fed could cut interest rates, fueling a further rally in Treasury securities. That could explain why yields in the government market are as low as they are today.</p>
        <p>But if bond investors are focusing on that scenario, they are ignoring an important piece of the inflation puzzle, according to Alan W. Kral, vice president for portfolio management at Trevor Stewart Burton &amp; Jacobsen in New York. Mr. Kral pointed out that in the past three months, the broadest measure of money supply has been growing at an annualized rate of 11 percent.</p>
        <p>''What we've got is a volatile economy caused by things like oil and capital spending potentially declining that is offset by the Fed providing tons of liquidity,'' Mr. Kral said. So while the Fed talks tough on inflation, its actions send a different message. ''We see this great bulge in money supply as potentially resulting in inflation,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Regardless, some observers think that the bond market's current behavior is a reflection of investors' staunch belief in Alan Greenspan's ability to save the day no matter what. In the event of a slowdown, ''people are making a strong bet that the Fed will ease immediately,'' Mr. Jonas said.</p>
        <p>Even more so, Mr. Kral says, today's Treasury bond yields reflect the fact that the investors known as the bond vigilantes are no longer around.</p>
        <p>In the early to mid-1990's, these powerful investors -- people like Stanley F. Druckenmiller of Soros Fund Management and Louis Moore Bacon of Moore Capital Management -- made huge bets on government bonds. They had the upper hand in monetary policy, driving interest rates up when they thought they saw signs of inflation and pushing rates down when the price data looked benign. It was these vigilantes to whom the early Clinton administration economic policy makers were in thrall; the bond market's anxiety about inflation played a big part in the tax and spending policies that contributed to today's big budget surpluses.</p>
        <p>''The bond vigilantes are gone, and the reason they are gone is that Greenspan has been elevated to a status that is enormous,'' Mr. Kral said. ''The bond market may be saying, 'Alan's going to bail us out.' We bailed out Russia, we bailed out Long-Term Capital Management. Maybe some people are beginning to feel that Nasdaq is too big to fail.''</p>

        <p>Bond Prices Pull Back</p>
        <p>By Reuters</p>
        <p>Treasury bond prices sank yesterday despite weakness in technology shares as investors moved to take profits in government bonds ahead of key labor market and growth data later this week.</p>
        <p>The decline in Treasury prices was cushioned somewhat by a dramatic dive of almost 6 percent in the technology-heavy Nasdaq stock index, which drove some investors to seek the safe haven of government issues.</p>
        <p>The 10-year Treasury note fell 12/32, to a price of 100 18/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.67 percent from 5.62 percent on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 17/32, to 107 5/32. The bond's yield rose to 5.74 percent from 5.71 percent on Tuesday.</p>
