        <p>With its smart, ergonomic styling and color L.C.D. screen in a button-studded back panel, the new Kodak Advantix Preview camera looks like another point-and-shoot that has gone thoroughly digital.</p>
        <p>But don't be fooled.</p>
        <p>Despite its advanced circuitry and chip sets inside, this $300 Kodak camera has not embraced megapixels. Instead it is still wedded to film. So why all the electronics?</p>
        <p>Kodak designers said they listened to consumers and learned that many of them still preferred film but would like greater control over which pictures are actually printed.</p>
        <p>Using a CCD image sensor, the same device that is at the heart of most digital cameras, the Preview camera takes two pictures: one that is exposed on Advantix film and another electronic one that is displayed on a preview window on the back of the camera. If a photographer doesn't like the picture, which is rendered to closely match what is captured on film, he or she can easily set a selector to tell the photo finisher to skip that shot.</p>
        <p>The same selector can also adjust the setting on any picture to have as many as nine copies of it made when the film is developed.</p>
        <p>The camera, which has a 2.6x zoom lens and a six-function built-in flash, also has other controls to change the format of the picture.</p>
