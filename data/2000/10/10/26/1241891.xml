        <p>Mini-malls are in vast supply in Los Angeles, and there is a shortage of schools. Philip Lance, an Episcopal priest and director of Pueblo Nuevo Development, a community redevelopment organization, had a creative solution: turning a mall into a school. He enlisted a nonprofit school developer, EXED, as well as Paul Cummins, an expert in founding new schools, and hired the architects Daly Genik to create the newly opened Camino Nuevo Charter Academy, above. The architects transformed an 11,000-square-foot mini-mall, which had never opened, into a vibrant school building in the Rampart district with classrooms for 250 children, from kindergarten to fifth grade. They added new windows and doors and gave the building a bright splash of paint. An existing external balcony and stairs were transformed into a striking structure made of steel and a beige synthetic ''lumber'' made of recycled plastic and paper pulp. An entrance to underground parking was relocated, making way for more classrooms and a play area, and giving teachers their own parking area under the school, an important security issue in this low-income area.</p>

        <p>The $1.1 million Camino Nuevo represents a bright light for the community. ''There's always a chance to rethink the city fabric, and having an opportunity to turn it into a school was a special one,'' said Kevin Daly, whose firm is better known for spare, modern residences. Camino Nuevo Academy is at 697 South Burlington, at Seventh Street.</p>
