        <p>In this guarded enclave of money and privilege, intruders ravaged Cindy Aloi's lake-front property this summer after hurdling a seven-foot mesh fence or wriggling underneath it. They used to swim across the lake, too, until she put a stop to that with an electric fence along the shoreline.</p>
        <p>Ms. Aloi, a freelance television director, has given their description to the village police: four-legged, brown fur, white tail.</p>
        <p>''They broke in and ate every rosebush I had, and then they ate my tomatoes, and that meant war,'' said Ms. Aloi as she fumed at the chewed-over garden in her backyard. ''You think I want to put an electric fence by the water? You think I want to live like this?''</p>
        <p>Like many of her neighbors, Ms. Aloi has declared war on marauding deer after years of putting up with their brazen ways. Tuxedo Park officials changed their no-hunting policy this year, over the objections of some residents, to allow for a ''culling program'' in which sharpshooters would kill deer.</p>
        <p>They are also considering restoring a fence that once kept big game inside these 2,300 acres in Orange County when it was a hunting preserve for Pierre Lorillard, the tobacco heir, and his wealthy friends in the late 1800's. Only now, the fence would keep out pesky deer.</p>
        <p>In affluent suburbs across the Northeast, frustrated residents and officials are advocating once unthinkable hunts and other costly defenses against what they see as a growing threat from deer run amok. For instance, in New Jersey, Millburn officials decided last month to hire sharpshooters after a much-anticipated program to relocate the unwanted deer captured only a dozen of them.</p>
        <p>Similarly, a deer committee in New Canaan, Conn., mailed letters to the town's largest landowners last week to encourage bow hunting on their properties. It has also sponsored two forums on deer control and Lyme disease that drew 400 people, and raised $18,000 in donations for an aerial survey to count the deer.</p>
        <p>Fire Island residents have spent more than $60,000 on a research program that now injects 200 does a year with a chemical that prevents them from becoming pregnant. And so many gardeners have lost their prized azaleas and tomato plants in Chappaqua, N.Y., that the board of education offers a two-hour class, for $25, on how to outfox the deer by, among other things, planting what they do not eat.</p>
        <p>But this show of zero tolerance has also pitted those trying to enjoy the good life against those wanting to save the wildlife -- with no easy answers for either side.</p>
        <p>''I got someone mad at me because I referred to Tuxedo Park as the all-day buffet,'' said Cornelius J. J. Madera Jr., a real estate developer who is the village mayor, as he drove by clusters of deer grazing along the roadside. ''The last several years, they've just been multiplying and there's no natural predators here, so the deer are just living the life of Riley.''</p>
        <p>Of course, not everyone sees the deer as the problem. Richard Waite, a retired fabric designer, said he quit Tuxedo Park's deer committee after other members insulted him and ignored his pleas to spare the deer. ''I was the only one out of the whole group that had any sanity about animal life,'' said Mr. Waite, who is one of several residents suing the village to block the culling program.</p>
        <p>The deer population, estimated at 1.2 million in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, has thrived in recent years largely because of mild winters and fewer threats, including a declining number of hunters. And as these herds have foraged farther afield for food, they have strayed into roads, farmland and subdivisions and run afoul of their neighbors.</p>
        <p>Deer damage complaints from New Yorkers have increased 79 percent in the last five years, to 1,250 last year from 697 in 1994, according to state wildlife officials. There was also an 84 percent rise in nuisance permits, which allow property owners to shoot deer that cause extensive damage, to 1,087 permits last year.</p>
        <p>In New Jersey, deer complaints decreased about 4 percent to 913 last year, but farmers secured 600 nuisance permits, or nearly double the 309 permits issued five years ago. Connecticut, which does not track complaints, has already granted 1,530 nuisance permits this year, or a 2 percent increase over last year (1994 figures were not available).</p>
        <p>The deer have also been singled out for causing more car accidents, spreading Lyme disease and eroding watersheds with their indiscriminate munching. New York and Connecticut wildlife officials reported an 11 percent increase in car accidents involving deer to 13,151 last year from 11,800 in 1994. (New Jersey figures were unavailable.) In Morristown, N.J., a man even sued state and local officials this month, alleging that the deer had become a hazard to motorists.</p>
        <p>Timothy P. Gordon, the Millburn business administrator, said safety concerns now outweigh the moral objection to killing the deer for many citizens. As an example, he said the township's tax collector, Gerald Viturello, was driving to work last week and was shaken when a buck crashed through his car window.</p>
        <p>''It's rare that a tax collector gets sympathy,'' he said. ''But this brought the danger closer to home. What if it were a van with schoolchildren?''</p>
        <p>While the deer are not exclusively a problem of the rich, they seem to frequent the same idyllic retreats. In Tuxedo Park, Mr. Madera counts about two deer for each of the 330 luxury homes nestled among the lakes, mountains and woods. The village police receive two or three complaints a week about these intruders.</p>
        <p>But just outside the village entrance, there is much less discord in the middle-class town that surrounds Tuxedo Park. Unlike the village, the town of Tuxedo has long allowed hunting in some areas. Kenneth Magar, the town supervisor, said he had received no complaints about deer this year -- though there had been six complaints about bears.</p>
        <p>What did he make of the deer wars in Tuxedo Park? ''I was born and raised on a dairy farm in Orange County, so this all seems a little weird to me,'' he said. ''We just used to bag them and freeze them.''</p>
        <p>In the rarefied air of Tuxedo Park, so many fences have gone up in the last two years that village officials have declared a moratorium on them and proposed building a single fence around the entire village at a cost of $800,000 to $2 million. ''It started to look like the Bronx Zoo,'' Mr. Madera said.</p>
        <p>But the moratorium has not stopped some residents. Ms. Aloi said she had spent more than $50,000 to deer-proof her 1.2 acre property, including replacing a mesh fence that was chewed through by hungry mouths last month. She buys from Deerbusters, a mail-order company in Frederick, Md., that claims to be the nation's largest supplier of deer fencing and repellants with more than 150 items.</p>
        <p>And she is not alone. Jason Wiles, general manager for Deerbusters, said his company's sales had tripled in the last year, though he would not give specific figures. He said about half the company's 100,000 customers live in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.</p>
        <p>Did he happen to be familiar with Tuxedo Park? ''Oh yeah,'' Mr. Wiles said without hesitation. ''They just purchase an amazing amount of things.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Wiles said he even discussed the merits of deer fencing with one of Tuxedo Park's most famous residents, Whoopi Goldberg. (She declined through her publicist to be interviewed for this story.)</p>
        <p>Yet nothing ever keeps the deer at bay for long in Tuxedo Park. Dolores Marchand, president of the village's garden club, sprayed her flowers with coyote urine, fertilizers, even a homemade concoction of lye soap, cayenne pepper and eggs. Finally, she just gave up her garden. ''People are very bitter about it,'' she said. ''If you talk about a particular plant, they'll say, 'Oh I had that, and they ate it.' ''</p>
        <p>Even residents who oppose the culling program say something needs to be done. After pointing at  half-eaten shrubs, Peter Simonetta, a retired restaurateur, charged at a doe lounging on his neighbor's lawn. The startled doe pranced away. ''I won't eat deer; I call it Bambi burger,'' he said. ''But I do object that there's no control. Here around 4 o'clock, it's like a petting zoo.''</p>
        <p>The deer invasions have become the stuff of gossip, rumor and neighborly banter in this secluded village, which has almost no crime and few other worries. As dark sedans roll up the narrow drive into Tuxedo Park, a police officer waves through the residents, logs in guests and turns away everyone else.</p>
        <p>Well, not quite everyone.</p>
        <p>Four-legged intruders occasionally saunter past the parked police cars, past the imposing fieldstone guardhouse and through the wrought-iron gates as if they owned the place. Not many nights ago, a pair of does showed up.</p>
        <p>''They went right in,'' said the policewoman who was on duty. ''They were in the proper lane. Should we have asked them where they were going?''</p>
