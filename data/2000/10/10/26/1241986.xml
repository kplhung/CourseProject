        <p>A young man shot by a robber  Tuesday as he changed a tire outside a Brooklyn high school died of his injuries early yesterday, the police said.</p>
        <p>The shooting took place about 5:30 p.m. Tuesday outside Bushwick High School as the man, Joseph Gallo Rodriguez, 18, who was working for a garage, was changing a tire on a teacher's car, the authorities said. The car was parked on Irving Avenue outside the school. It was Mr. Rodriguez's fourth day on the job at Quality Automotive Services, said his mother, Joanne Gallo.</p>
        <p>The police said two men approached Mr. Rodriguez and demanded the chain he wore around his neck. When he refused, one of them fired a single shot, hitting him in the neck, and both robbers fled west on Woodbine Street. Two men were being sought yesterday, the police said. As of last night, the police had not released descriptions of the men.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rodriguez was taken to Brookdale University Hospital and Medical Center and had been in stable condition, but his condition deteriorated during the night, and he died at 4:36 a.m. yesterday, the police said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Gallo said yesterday that the necklace her son wore -- a sterling silver chain with a crucifix charm,  was a treasured gift from his father.</p>
        <p>''It's senseless,'' Ms. Gallo said. ''Over a piece of metal -- a piece of metal they didn't even take.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rodriguez preferred silver over gold, his mother said. ''He didn't want to wear expensive things because he wouldn't want to be robbed. You'd think with the silver at least he'd be safe.''</p>
        <p>Her son had dropped out of the East New York High School of Transit Technology two years ago, she said, after he was slashed in the face while waiting for the school bus. It was part of a gang initiation rite, Ms. Gallo said, and after that, Joseph seemed to have lost his taste for school. ''I don't think it was so much that he was afraid, but I think he had a mental block after that,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Sitting with family photos in the  living room of the Starrett City apartment she shared with her son, Ms. Gallo, who uses a wheelchair,  sobbed as she spoke of Joseph. Her son, she said, helped her to shop for food and would take her to the mall.</p>
        <p>At his new job, Ms. Gallo said, her son was training to be a dispatcher but responded to the teacher's call because the garage had been swamped with requests for help.</p>
        <p>A dispatcher at Quality Automotive Services said yesterday that the company's trucks were all out on other jobs or caught in traffic when the teacher's call came in. The dispatcher, who asked to be identified only as Pat, said Mr. Rodriguez saw that it was a schoolteacher and decided to go to help her.</p>
        <p>''You don't find responsible kids like that anymore,'' Pat said of the  trainee. ''How many kids are there out there that are going to help a woman in trouble?''</p>
        <p>A group of seniors who congregated outside Bushwick High yesterday said their school had become more orderly since their freshman days. Metal detectors were installed and misbehavior was punished more severely, they said.</p>
        <p>''People aren't scared to go to school,'' said Janine Valentin, 17, a senior. ''Before, there were kids in the hallways. Now there aren't. Kids have to go to summer school or else they don't pass. If you fight, you get expelled. Before, you just got suspended.''</p>
        <p>But one teacher, who declined to be named, said he was considering calling in sick today to avoid a scheduled open house that required teachers to stay past sundown. ''Something like this scares me off,'' said the teacher, a 17-year Bushwick High veteran. ''I'd consider leaving, but it's so hard to do once you've been in a place so long.''</p>
        <p>Teachers at the school said their colleague who had summoned help for her flat tire was not at school yesterday. She was badly shaken by the incident, they said. This was her first year at the school.</p>
        <p>Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy visited the school yesterday, a spokeswoman for the Board of Education said. ''He went out to see what the situation was and to reassure them and make sure it was a safe and orderly environment for them, which it is,'' said the spokeswoman, Pam McDonnell. Nonetheless, she said, additional security officers would be stationed there.</p>
