        <p>A heated rivalry among Manhattan real estate companies appears to have cooled down, with the city's smaller real estate concerns close to an agreement to merge their Web site with one planned for four of the city's largest brokerage companies.</p>
        <p>Officials of the two competing groups have held private talks in fits and starts for the last few months, and earlier this week, they finally agreed in principle to a deal, according to several executives close to the talks. They said the companies planned to make an announcement as early as tomorrow, although it was more likely to come at the start of next week.</p>
        <p>The deal would mean buyers and sellers could go to one Web site and obtain almost all of the residential listings in Manhattan. The combined site would represent the city's closest attempt at a multiple listing service -- a database provided by members that automatically shares property information among brokers.</p>
        <p>Most cities in the nation have had these listing services for decades, but until earlier this year Manhattan's brokerage companies had resisted, choosing instead to keep some listings of condominiums, co-ops and town houses to themselves.</p>
        <p>The battle between the two groups began in August, when three of the city's largest residential real estate concerns -- the Corcoran Group, Douglas Elliman and the Halstead Property Group, -- announced their intention to start a Web-based multiple listing service in January. They invited other Manhattan brokerage firms to join, but only Bellmarc Realty signed up.</p>
        <p>Instead of joining, several other concerns, lead by Sotheby's International Realty, Brown Harris Stevens and Coldwell Banker Hunt Kennedy, balked and started their own site, Nymls.com, earlier this month after they became frustrated in the talks with Corcoran and Elliman.</p>
        <p>If the deal comes together, it will mean the end of a bitter battle between the two groups. The smaller brokerage concerns have contended that the group led by Elliman and Corcoran was trying to start a profit-generating multiple listing service that would benefit larger companies at the expense of smaller ones.</p>
        <p>The steering committee of the Nymls.com group is scheduled to meet today to discuss the deal, which was forged in principle on Tuesday in the office of William L. Zeckendorf, the chairman of Brown Harris Stevens, people close to the talks said. Nymls.com's full membership is to review the plan tomorrow.</p>
        <p>''We don't have a deal until our general membership looks at it,'' said one senior executive involved in the discussions. ''But I am optimistic that by the end of the week we will have something.''</p>
        <p>Another executive close to the deal said yesterday that officials in the Elliman-Corcoran group agreed to drop plans to make the listing service a for-profit business and approved creating a board of elected representatives of each of the different types of companies in the city.</p>
        <p>The new Web site will drop the name Nymls.com, the executive said, but will incorporate much of the technology used on that site, which has been run by Gabriels.net, an Internet company that Barbara Corcoran, the chairwoman of the Corcoran Group, has invested in.</p>
