        <p>Happy dancegoers kept seeing double on Tuesday night. American Ballet Theater opened its autumn engagement at City Center with a gala performance that showed off many of its principal dancers.</p>
        <p>The evening concluded with what the program listed as a ''preview performance'' of Ballet Theater's new production of ''Prodigal Son,'' George Balanchine's great work of 1929, which is entering the company's repertory this season. But before this choreographic meat and potatoes came what was termed ''A Celebration of Tchaikovsky's Music in Dance,'' a suite of tidbits to scores by Tchaikovsky that served as the balletic equivalent of a buffet table heaped with hors d'oeuvres.</p>
        <p>Except for the concluding ensemble, everything in this five-part suite was a pas de deux. Such programming was risky. Although each duet was spectacular in itself, all were so structurally similar that watching one after another might have proved wearying rather than exhilarating.</p>
        <p>Fortunately, Ballet Theater's dancers were in fine form. Their dancing glittered yet was never tarnished by the razzmatazz that can sometimes plague unabashed displays of virtuosity.</p>
        <p>Susan Jaffe was dignified and Vladimir Malakhov was fleet in the third-act pas de deux from Marius Petipa's ''Sleeping Beauty,'' as staged by Kenneth MacMillan.</p>
        <p>Irina Dvorovenko and Maxim Belotserkovsky offered the third-act duet from ''Swan Lake,'' a sequence popularly known as the ''Black Swan'' pas de deux. Performing a version choreographed by Kevin McKenzie based on the original by Petipa, they not only danced brilliantly, but also let their performance serve as a reminder that in the context of ''Swan Lake,'' this duet is a seduction scene. Appropriately, therefore, Ms. Dvorovenko was alluring and Mr. Belotserkovsky seemed magnetized by her.</p>
        <p>Paloma Herrera and Marcelo Gomes sailed blithely through Balanchine's ''Tchaikovsky Pas de Deux,'' a contemporary tribute to classical style. In another homage to the past, Mr. McKenzie's choreography for ''The Nutcracker'' pas de deux, Ashley Tuttle was regal in the Adagio and delicate in her solo, and Angel Corella made all his turns speedy.</p>
        <p>Then a large ensemble led by Gillian Murphy and Giuseppe Picone filled the stage with the finale from Balanchine's ''Theme and Variations,'' one of the grandest parades in all ballet.</p>
        <p>After the intermission came ''Prodigal Son,'' with its bold score by Prokofiev and settings in stained-glass colors by Georges Rouault. Several dancers are scheduled to portray leading roles in this staging by Richard Tanner. On this occasion, Ethan Stiefel was the Prodigal Son and Julie Kent was the Siren. Both were dramatically intense.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stiefel indicated the Prodigal's rebelliousness by making his phrases as sudden as tantrums. But this reckless lad was totally overawed by Ms. Kent's Siren, an imperious temptress who often appeared ready to devour him. Later Mr. Stiefel brought admirable gestural clarity to the scenes in which the Prodigal returns home in physical and emotional agony.</p>
        <p>The production as a whole looked strong, although the white beard and wig of Brian Reeder as the Prodigal's Father were much too obviously fake. It will be fascinating to see various interpretations of ''Prodigal Son'' throughout the season, which continues through Nov. 5.</p>
        <p>Ormsby Wilkins and David LaMarche conducted.</p>
