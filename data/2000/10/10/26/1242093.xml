        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I was happy to learn that kindergartens are finally exposing children to academic subjects to prepare them for the real world (front page, Oct. 23). Young children are held to higher standards in most developed countries, and it is high time that America followed their lead.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I was happy to learn that kindergartens are finally exposing children to academic subjects to prepare them for the real world (front page, Oct. 23). Young children are held to higher standards in most developed countries, and it is high time that America followed their lead.</p>
        <p>In the Ukrainian kindergarten I attended, we learned to read, write and compute simple mathematical problems, draw people (not just stick figures), dance and recite poetry. In the first month of first grade, we learned to write in script, read newspapers and multiply numbers. When I immigrated here, I was shocked to discover that children here do not learn to multiply until the third grade.</p>
        <p>Bravo to educators for realizing that for the United States to continue to lead the world, our children need to be held to a higher standard!</p>
