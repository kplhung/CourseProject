        <p>If asked to identify the most remarkable bid in the history of the game, it is likely that a panel of knowledgeable experts would select the final action in the diagramed deal. It was played almost half a century ago, and the hero was Sidney Lazard of New Orleans, long one of the country's brightest stars. In Anaheim, Calif., in August, he was inducted into the American Bridge League's Hall of Fame, and the episode was recalled by his regular partner, Bart Bramley.</p>
        <p>In a rubber bridge game played for high stakes, Lazard sat South. He was not entirely surprised to hear a one-club opening on his right, for he knew his man, one of his own regular partners. East was Bill Hanna, an expert who frequently made psychic openings with bad hands, a popular gambit at that time, and he invariably bid his long suit. Lazard's suspicions were confirmed when the one-spade response was passed, but he did not know what to do. He tried two no-trump, suggesting a strong hand with stoppers in the suits bid by the opposition.</p>

        <p>If asked to identify the most remarkable bid in the history of the game, it is likely that a panel of knowledgeable experts would select the final action in the diagramed deal. It was played almost half a century ago, and the hero was Sidney Lazard of New Orleans, long one of the country's brightest stars. In Anaheim, Calif., in August, he was inducted into the American Bridge League's Hall of Fame, and the episode was recalled by his regular partner, Bart Bramley.</p>
        <p>In a rubber bridge game played for high stakes, Lazard sat South. He was not entirely surprised to hear a one-club opening on his right, for he knew his man, one of his own regular partners. East was Bill Hanna, an expert who frequently made psychic openings with bad hands, a popular gambit at that time, and he invariably bid his long suit. Lazard's suspicions were confirmed when the one-spade response was passed, but he did not know what to do. He tried two no-trump, suggesting a strong hand with stoppers in the suits bid by the opposition.</p>
        <p>Everyone now knew that East was very weak, so when West persevered with three hearts, it was clear that he held a strong major two-suiter. After considerable hesitation East carried on to four hearts, and Lazard, in his turn, plunged into thought.</p>
        <p>Hanna surely held four-card heart support and club length. What could he have been thinking about? The raise would be obvious. No doubt he was considering the possibility of playing in spades, so his most likely distribution was 3-4-1-5. West must also be short in diamonds, so North surely held considerable diamond length.</p>
        <p>On this reasoning Lazard electrified the table by bidding six diamonds and found the dummy he expected. Now he had to make the slam. He ruffed the second heart lead with the trump ace, cashed the king and led the nine to dummy's jack.</p>
        <p>Ruffing dummy's last heart was going to leave him in a bad position. Instead he led the club jack, which was covered by the queen and king. The last trump in the close hand was led to the queen, and two more trump leads left this position:</p>
        <p>Diagram</p>
        <p>Note that East had been forced to give up a spade to save all his clubs. South finessed the club nine and cashed the ace, throwing the spade 10 from the dummy. He then led the club eight, and West, now down to the heart queen and the king-jack of spades, gave up a spade to save his heart winner. Lazard ruffed in dummy and scored the last trick with the spade three to make an incredible slam.  BRIDGE</p>
