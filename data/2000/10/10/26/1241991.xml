        <p>Gov. George W. Bush made an aggressive appeal to elderly voters in Florida today, pitching his plans for Social Security and Medicare as superior to Vice President Al Gore's and casting Mr. Gore's assertions to the contrary as blatant scare tactics.</p>

        <p>Gov. George W. Bush made an aggressive appeal to elderly voters in Florida today, pitching his plans for Social Security and Medicare as superior to Vice President Al Gore's and casting Mr. Gore's assertions to the contrary as blatant scare tactics.</p>
        <p>''I know it's Halloween time, and I know the man is trying to scare you into the voting booth,'' Mr. Bush said during a speech in Daytona Beach, where he began a long day of campaigning with two high-profile Republican companions: his brother, Jeb, the Florida governor, and Senator John McCain of Arizona.</p>
        <p>''But not this time, Mr. Gore,'' Mr. Bush added. ''And not this year.''</p>
        <p>At a succession of grandly staged, densely crowded rallies in a state where Mr. Bush is being forced to fight much harder than he had wanted or expected to, he implored retirees not to believe claims about his Social Security plan that Mr. Gore and other Democrats have made.</p>
        <p>They have said that by partly privatizing the entitlement program, Mr. Bush would endanger retirees' current level of benefits, a charge that Mr. Bush cannot afford to let stick. Retirees make up a disproportionately large percentage of voters in Florida and may well hold the key to its 25 electoral votes, the fourth most in the country.</p>
        <p>''We've got a plan that says to seniors: we're going to keep our promises,'' Mr. Bush said in Daytona Beach. He repeated that pledge later at rallies in Sanford and Brandon.</p>
        <p>He said elderly people would fare better under his plan to change Medicare and give them a prescription drug benefit by encouraging them to join government-subsidized private insurance plans that included it. Mr. Gore would expand the government's Medicare program so that a drug benefit would be available voluntarily to all older Americans for an additional monthly premium.</p>
        <p>''He forces every senior from Florida who wants prescription drug coverage to join a government-controlled H.M.O. for prescription drugs,'' Mr. Bush said. ''He calls it a 'pharmaceutical benefit manager.' ''</p>
        <p>''But it works like an H.M.O.,'' Mr. Bush continued. ''It acts like an H.M.O. It quacks like an H.M.O. He can call it a P.B.M., but that's Washington talk for H.M.O. And if you don't like the one the government puts you in, that's just too darned bad, because you don't have any choices under his plan.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush has visited Florida about once a week since Labor Day. His decision to cross the state by bus today, less than two weeks before Election Day, underscored the surprising tightness of the race here. According to a new poll by the New York Times and CBS News, Mr. Gore leads Mr. Bush here by four percentage points among likely voters.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush had begun his current swing through Florida with a rally in Jacksonville on Tuesday night, and from that moment on, there was a palpable sense of urgency and electricity to his events, which had the feel of eve-of-election exhortations.</p>
        <p>Held mostly in enormous spaces, Mr. Bush's rallies variously featured thundering music, dramatic lighting designs, fireworks, confetti, balloons and big, foot-stomping, passionately shouting crowds.</p>
        <p>He stoked crowds into cheers and boos with increasingly sharp language about Mr. Gore, whom he portrayed as an inveterate exaggerator and wanton spender under whom the size of the federal government would become ''Gore-gantuan.''</p>
        <p>And he kept both his brother and Mr. McCain, both of whom had faced questions about whether they were doing enough to promote Mr. Bush's campaign, close at his side. Jeb Bush repeatedly vowed to deliver a victory in Florida to the Bush campaign.</p>
        <p>The Texas governor took the dynamics and demographics of the Florida electorate into careful account, dwelling on Social Security and Medicare and courting the state's many veterans with his promise to treat them better and strengthen the military.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCain, a former prisoner of war in Vietnam, bolstered that effort, vouching for Mr. Bush's ability to keep America secure. He even went so far as to bring the recent bombing of a Navy ship in Yemen, which killed 17 Americans, into the political fray.</p>
        <p>''We just saw in the tragedy that befell those brave young Americans onboard the U.S.S. Cole that we still live in a very dangerous world,'' Mr. McCain said in Daytona Beach. Then he said: ''We need a steady hand on the tiller. We need the kind of leadership that George W. Bush and Dick Cheney will provide this country so we cannot have those kinds of tragedies ever happen again.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush derided Democrats for phone calls that the Florida party had placed to thousands of voters to tell them that Mr. Bush's plans ''would undermine'' Social Security. Those words were part of a recorded message from the television actor Ed Asner that Mr. Bush said was intended to scare older voters.</p>
        <p>At the rally in Brandon, near Tampa, tonight, Jeb Bush said: ''Let's tell Ed Asner to go back to Hollywood where he belongs.''</p>
        <p>The Texas governor's response to what he sees as Democrats' efforts to scare older voters has been to try, as Democrats see it, to scare younger ones.</p>
        <p>He did so today by repeating his accusation that Mr. Gore's Social Security plan would create $40 trillion in debt by the middle of the century, a projection and figure that the Gore campaign has vigorously disputed.</p>
        <p>Many experts say Mr. Bush's own Social Security proposal, which would allow people to start investing part of their Social Security payroll taxes in private retirement accounts, also has extraordinary costs that he has been unwilling to acknowledge. Mr. Bush has not answered many questions about the transition from the current system to the one he is suggesting.</p>
        <p>And while Mr. Bush turned H.M.O. into a nasty set of initials for the purpose of attacking Mr. Gore, many of the private insurance plans that his proposed changes in Medicare would coax people into would be H.M.O.'s.</p>
        <p>Kym Spell, a spokeswoman for the Gore campaign, in fact described the Bush plan as a deliberate effort to line the pockets of private companies, saying it was created ''for and by special interests.'' Ms. Spell also said that Mr. Bush was grossly mischaracterizing Mr. Gore's proposals.</p>
        <p>In His Own Words  GEORGE W. BUSH</p>
        <p>Remarks yesterday in an  appearance with Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, at Seminole Community College in Sanford, Fla.:</p>
        <p>''They're trying to say, You know, old George W. is going to take away your check. But I'm going to set aside $2.4 trillion of Social Security surplus.</p>
        <p>They can't make that case. They can try, but we're not going to let them this time, this year. We're going to tell them loud and clear, a promise made will be a promise kept to the seniors of this country. That $2.4 trillion in payroll taxes, it means $2.4 trillion more in payroll taxes than we owe the seniors, which means there's a really interesting opportunity to make sure we not only fulfill the promises to the seniors but we have a Social Security system that is hopeful for the younger workers.</p>
        <p>This is a very interesting moment in our country's history. And it requires our nation putting trust where it belongs: with the people in order to make sure there's a Social Security system around tomorrow, at least one that looks like one today, one that doesn't require huge payroll tax increases or major benefit reductions. In order to make sure there's a system that reflects the fact that there's not going to be enough people putting money in the system to take care of aging baby boomers like me and McCain.</p>
        <p>In order to make sure that's the case, we must let younger workers take a portion of their own payroll taxes and put it in the marketplace to get a better rate of return on your own money, on your own money.</p>
        <p>But guess what's happened? The agents of the status quo in Washington, D.C., have misread the people on this issue. They misread the people. They think they can frighten people. Halloween's right around the corner, so they're trying to politically scare people into booths. But there's a new dynamic in the country. There's a lot of younger folks who are thinking differently. A lot of younger folks who are saying, 'Trust me.' ''</p>
