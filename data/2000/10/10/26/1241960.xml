        <p>Brown Brothers Harriman &amp; Company and a developer have made an offer to buy control of a site in Battery Park City where the bank plans to build a new waterfront headquarters.</p>
        <p>But the bank first has to negotiate a complicated series of special zoning changes and tax breaks with both state and city officials and come to terms with the Battery Park City Authority on a price for the land.</p>
        <p>Brown Brothers, the oldest private commercial bank in the nation, has searched fitfully for a new home over the last four years. It had looked at the vacant waterfront parcel earlier this year before it found space at the top of a tower at the nearby World Financial Center. But when the bank failed to move quickly and lost the space, real estate executives said, it turned its attention back to the land on the Hudson River waterfront.</p>
        <p>Brown Brothers and the developer, Brookfield Financial Properties, have proposed building a 23-story glass tower just north of the New York Mercantile Exchange in Battery Park City. The bank, whose headquarters has been on Wall Street for 157 years, would own and occupy about half the 800,000-square-foot building, while Brookfield would control the rest, Battery Park City officials said.</p>
        <p>The authority, the state agency that controls the site, had planned on selling the development rights for the parcel to the highest bidder, for an apartment house. But city officials asked the state authority to accommodate the bank and to amend the master plan for Battery Park City so that a commercial tower could be built there.</p>
        <p>Fearful that Brown Brothers would make good on a threat to move to New Jersey, the city's Economic Development Corporation has gone to great lengths to help the bank find a new home. But real estate executives scoffed at the idea that Brown Brothers, the epitome of an old money, white-shoe bank, would move its headquarters out of Manhattan, although it does have an office and 550 employees at the Newport Office Tower in Jersey City.</p>
        <p>In any event, last week Brookfield made an undisclosed offer for the site that fell short of what the authority wanted. Timothy S. Carey, president of the authority, said he was putting together a counteroffer and expected negotiations to accelerate. He said he wanted to get the full value of the property, a rare downtown development site.</p>
        <p>''We're looking for a return on our investment,'' Mr. Carey said. ''The tax breaks are a negotiation between the developer and the city.''</p>
        <p>Michael Carey, president of the Economic Development Corporation, did not return calls requesting comment.</p>
        <p>Radford W. Klotz, a partner at Brown Brothers, and Richard Clark, president of Brookfield, said that the two companies were working together on a proposed project at Battery Park City. But they declined to discuss details of the negotiations.</p>
        <p>While it is no longer a powerhouse, Brown Brothers still has a list of wealthy clients and about 850 employees at its historic home at 63 Wall Street. It moved an operations center to Jersey City in 1994.</p>
        <p>For the last four years, as it  searched for a new home, the bank has considered a number of sites, including 350 Madison Avenue and 875 Third Avenue in Midtown, and 100 Broadway and 125 Broad Street downtown.</p>
        <p>But an agreement was never reached, and, as the search dragged on, rents skyrocketed and the prospect of a deal became more and more expensive.</p>
        <p>Even after the bank began talks with city officials about Battery Park City earlier this year, Brown Brothers focused on space available at the top of 1 World Financial Center.</p>
        <p>But Lehman Brothers moved more quickly, according to real estate executives, and has struck a tentative deal for the space. So Brown Brothers went back to the  waterfront site three weeks ago and selected Brookfield to be the developer.</p>
        <p>The Brown Brothers search was complicated by the lack of vacant space downtown and in Midtown. To try to stem the resulting rent increases and the flow of companies to New Jersey, the Battery Park City Authority is about to put a large separate parcel up for sale that could accommodate a 1.8-million-square-foot tower.</p>
        <p>The city is selling another vacant site, at Murray and Greenwich Streets. The Brown Brothers tower would also help, since it would include 400,000 square feet of space for other tenants.</p>
        <p>But, even if the deal for the waterfront property does not work out, few brokers believe that Brown Brothers, which closed its brokerage business in May and laid off 78 investment analysts and traders, is going anywhere outside of Manhattan.  ''They're not leaving the city,'' said one prominent broker who has talked with Brown Brothers. ''It's not a critical mass of jobs anyway.''</p>
