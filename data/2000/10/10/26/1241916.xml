        <p>THE Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology was overflowing with happy faces last week at the opening of ''A Woman's Hand: Designing Textiles in America, 1945-1969.'' Forty designers are represented in the show. Many of them are being honored for the first time, although their designs are well known.</p>
        <p>A number of these fabrics, with their bold 50's designs of leaves and boomerangs and Sputniks and atomic symbols, and names like Tiki, have become collectibles. Seventy-five fabrics will be on view at the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology, on Seventh Avenue at 27th Street, until Jan. 13. (No admission charge; information available from (212) 217-5800.)</p>
        <p>''This show gives credit to the unsung heroes of American fabric design,'' said Dorothy Casonas, the vice president of design at Unika Vaev, a fabric company in New York. ''Think about America going through the war years -- the idea was to create happy patterns then.''</p>
        <p>One pattern in the exhibition is actually called Carefree and shows blue and lime-green biomorphic shapes interspersed with drunken pickup sticks. It was designed by Chris Ranes, a woman who studied at the Pratt Institute.</p>
        <p>''Women in design are more risk takers than their male counterparts,'' Ms. Casonas said, ''at least when it comes to scale of patterns and color.''</p>
        <p>Lynn Felsher, the curator of textiles at the Fashion Institute's museum, notes that textile design has changed radically since the 50's. ''The postwar period -- the 40's to the 60's -- was a period of printed fabrics,'' she said. ''They were less expensive to produce than wovens, and they also filled a void. After the drab war years, people wanted to buy bright, colorful fabric with bold patterns.''</p>
        <p>Strongly patterned fabric samples with nubby textures and brilliant colors fill the cases of the first floor gallery. On view are home furnishings textiles as well as some apparel fabrics. Many of the designers of that period were trained as fine artists and found textile design was a natural segue into the workforce. Although some names like Anni Albers, Ray Eames and Dorothy Liebes are well known, most of the designers in the exhibition worked anonymously. Ms. Felsher said the fabric companies or even the salesmen often took credit for the patterns.</p>
        <p>Ms. Ranes, who was at the opening of the exhibition, designed textiles from 1951 to 1955. In addition to Carefree, she designed patterns like Tiki and Happy that were emblematic of the 1950's. Carefree and Tiki are again being produced and can be purchased on the Internet from www.melinamade.com for $40 a yard.</p>
        <p>Tammis Keefe's Lemons, a bold chartreuse and orange design from 1949, was originally available as a home furnishings fabric. Ms. Keefe had previously designed printed linen handkerchiefs.</p>
        <p>Three print patterns by Ruth Adler Schnee -- Central Park South, Germination and Nosegay -- have been re-issued as woven designs by Unika Vaev and can be purchased at ICF (920 Broadway at 22nd Street) or through ICFsource.com/uv/ for $43 to $45 a yard.</p>
