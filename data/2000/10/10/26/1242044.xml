        <p>A year after he jumped bail, a Brooklyn-born businessman who was sentenced in absentia to 845 years in prison for his role in an immense insurance fraud scheme was arrested Tuesday afternoon in Austria.</p>
        <p>Federal officials described the businessman, Sholam Weiss, 46, as an extremely canny fugitive and said his arrest ended a search that took the authorities across three continents, and from some of the world's finest hotels to the slums of Sao Paulo, Brazil.</p>
        <p>The authorities said they believed that he had had access to as much as half the $450 million he helped steal and used some of it in flight.</p>
        <p>Officials have begun extradition proceedings to return Mr. Weiss to the United States.</p>
        <p>In a series of extremely complex mortgage and stock frauds, Mr. Weiss and several others looted the National Heritage Life Insurance Company in 1993 and 1994, leading to what the federal authorities called the largest insurance company failure caused by a criminal act in United States history. The company, which largely sold annuities to retirees, is chartered in Delaware, but the majority of its mostly elderly policy holders live in Florida.</p>
        <p>After his escape last year, Mr. Weiss seldom stayed long in one place, using prepaid cell phones, mounds of cash and a series of false identities to elude authorities in South America, Europe and Israel, often by using his Brazilian girlfriend as a front, said officials in the United States and Brazil.</p>
        <p>Despite his vigilance, his taste for fine hotels and young women helped officials capture him, they said.</p>
        <p>By any account, Mr. Weiss was an unconventional fugitive. A wanted poster on the F.B.I.'s Web site notes that he is subject to panic attacks and may be taking the prescription drugs Klonopin and Xanax to handle the anxiety. He is so fond of gambling that authorities regularly checked casinos for a trace of him.</p>
        <p>A father of five who built a lucrative plumbing supply business in Borough Park, Brooklyn, Mr. Weiss, a Hasidic Jew who long ago ceased being observant, shaved his beard days after jumping bail, on Oct. 18, 1999, one official said, citing a photo ID he got in Brazil later that month. The burly Mr. Weiss also lost at least 40 pounds, the official said.</p>
        <p>Police officials in Brazil, Germany and Austria, working in conjunction with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, were able to find Mr. Weiss by following his 27-year-old Brazilian girlfriend, whose name was not released by the authorities.</p>
        <p>She left Sao Paulo on Monday bound for Budapest via Frankfurt, said Frank A. Gallagher, who heads the F.B.I. office in Tampa, Fla. But then, in a move that the authorities said she likely picked up from the cautious Mr. Weiss, she took a train to Vienna instead of going to Budapest.</p>
        <p>Mr. Weiss met her at the Vienna train station and took her to an apartment in the fashionable Old Town section. The authorities learned later that he had moved into the apartment that day, renting it  under the name of his brother-in-law.</p>
        <p>One investigator said the F.B.I. believed that Mr. Weiss had been in the process of moving from South America to Vienna and was about to establish a new false identity.</p>
        <p>When the police in Vienna knocked on his door, however, his reaction helped give him away to a team of investigators who had never seen him and were at that moment unsure of whether they had found the right man.</p>
        <p>''When they did grab him, he said, 'I want a lawyer,' not 'Who are you?' 'You got the wrong guy,' 'What are you doing?' or whatever, and that really helped,'' one official said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gallagher of the F.B.I. praised the efforts of the Brazilian, German and Austrian police forces who worked together to track Mr. Weiss's girlfriend to Vienna. The Brazilian police official who oversaw the investigation in Sao Paulo said that he had five investigators working with him on the case full time for several months.</p>
        <p>The Brazilian investigators focused on Sao Paulo's large Jewish community since they felt Mr. Weiss might try to hide there, and on the city's finer hotels where they thought he would seek to maintain his expensive style of life, said the official, Jorge Pontes, a senior official with the Brazilian Federal Police.</p>
        <p>They sent investigators disguised as mail carriers to some of the hotels with mail addressed to Mr. Weiss and found the normally discreet concierges happy to tell what little they knew, said Mr. Pontes, who serves as his agency's liaison to Interpol, the international police agency.</p>
        <p>They began to find traces of Mr. Weiss, and learned that he had been thrown out of an expensive hotel because of a party he held in his room for himself with 9 or 10 young prostitutes, another official said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pontes, who spoke in a telephone interview yesterday from Japan, where he was attending an Interpol seminar, said his investigators tracked Mr. Weiss to another hotel in August, where they were able to obtain his telephone records and found one call that stood out.</p>
        <p>Since the call was to one of the city's poorer neighborhoods, ''It was strange for us, because it broke a little bit his profile,'' Mr. Pontes said.  It turned out to be the home of his girlfriend's mother, and it was the break that ultimately led them to track her to Vienna and to Mr. Weiss.</p>
        <p>While it is unclear how long the extradition process will take, Judy K. Hunt, the assistant United States attorney who prosecuted Mr. Weiss, said his conviction would make the process clear cut procedurally.</p>
        <p>Mr. Weiss was convicted in Orlando, Fla., in November on racketeering, money laundering and fraud charges.</p>
        <p>A lawyer who represents the Delaware insurance commissioner, Donna Lee Williams, who was named as the receiver for the National Heritage Life Insurance Company in 1994, said that $192 million of the company's assets have already been recovered and that he hoped Mr. Weiss's capture would lead to the recovery of more. ''There's $250 million that still needs to be recovered,'' said the lawyer, Fred Marro. ''From what we've heard, Sholam controls at least that kind of money, and so we're very excited that he's been rounded up.''</p>
        <p>Joel Hirschhorn, the lawyer who defended Mr. Weiss during his trial and removed himself from the case after Mr. Weiss became a fugitive, reiterated his belief yesterday that the 845-year sentence was ''horrific'' and that although his former client's appeal was dismissed because of his flight, the sentencing issue can nonetheless be reconsidered.</p>
        <p>''But I'm not sure if Mr. Weiss's year away from home, his year away from the system, was worth it,'' he said, adding, ''Only he can judge that.''</p>
