        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I am alarmed after reading your Oct. 23 front-page article about pushing children academically in kindergarten.</p>
        <p>When I was growing up in India, my mom used to argue with my teachers about the dryness of the educational material.</p>
        <p>We went on a three-month vacation during my first grade, and when the teachers complained that I would fall behind, my mother said that was all right. Not only did I not fall behind, I learned bits of another language and had a fun time.</p>
        <p>I shudder to think what I would do if any child of mine were sent to a  journal-writing, literature-discerning kindergarten. The primary purpose of being in kindergarten is to have fun, not to excel in some exam. I hope that the latter never becomes the norm.</p>
