        <p>EARLIER this month, Robert A. Casinghino took a walk in the woods. A student at Marist College in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., he had driven into the Dutchess County countryside in an old Chevrolet that he had borrowed from his parents. He was seeking the perfect place to leave a two-gallon paint bucket with a modest treasure trove: a waterproof brass match case, a few packages of field rations, a set of camping utensils, a log book and a pencil.</p>
        <p>Mr. Casinghino found a pretty spot in a green thicket. (''It just felt right,'' he said later.) He then pulled out his bright yellow Global Positioning System receiver to record the precise location and drove home to post the location on the Internet.</p>

        <p>EARLIER this month, Robert A. Casinghino took a walk in the woods. A student at Marist College in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., he had driven into the Dutchess County countryside in an old Chevrolet that he had borrowed from his parents. He was seeking the perfect place to leave a two-gallon paint bucket with a modest treasure trove: a waterproof brass match case, a few packages of field rations, a set of camping utensils, a log book and a pencil.</p>
        <p>Mr. Casinghino found a pretty spot in a green thicket. (''It just felt right,'' he said later.) He then pulled out his bright yellow Global Positioning System receiver to record the precise location and drove home to post the location on the Internet.</p>
        <p>He was geocaching, the latest fad in the never-ending pursuit of ways to use sophisticated technology to accomplish useless things. Players leave caches and others find them, often hiking for hours and enduring physical hardships to do so. For hundreds of enthusiasts worldwide, this high-tech Easter egg hunt is something to do with gadgets they have bought but may not have much use for.</p>
        <p>''I got it, honestly, because it was just a neat toy,'' Mr. Casinghino said. ''Unfortunately, I'm kind of a geek like that. I go for every gadget I can afford.''</p>
        <p>That is one of the reasons he is so excited about geocaching, he said. ''Now with this sport starting up,'' he explained, ''I actually have a use for it and I don't have to look at people and say, 'Well, I got it to play with.' ''</p>
        <p>Since May, at least 120 caches have been hidden in 31 states and 13 countries,  including Australia, New Zealand and Chile. ''I'm amazed that it took off like it has,'' said Mike Teague, an early player from Vancouver, Wash.</p>
        <p>Mr. Casinghino, however, said that he had to work at convincing friends ''that it isn't a complete waste of time.''</p>
        <p>Caches (also called ''stashes'' by players) generally include a log book, a disposable camera and inexpensive goodies like backpacking equipment, batteries or beer. The game resembles an earlier game called letterboxing, which shuns yuppie toys for the romance of maps and compasses. But the key to geocaching is the love that gadgeteers feel for their G.P.S. devices.</p>
        <p>The Global Positioning System was developed by the Defense Department for the military. An orbiting network of 24 satellites transmits signals that can be picked up by receivers anywhere in the world; the devices determine location by using those signals to triangulate. They have been used for years by hikers, boaters and lovers of high-tech toys. The prices of G.P.S. devices continue to slide  downward as their popularity grows; these days, a handheld receiver can be had for less than $100.</p>
        <p>Until this year, however, the military gave itself an advantage over any enemies who might use the same network of satellites by giving the system a form of technomyopia. Under a policy called selective availability, encryption was used to degrade the signal for most users, ensuring that while the military  would be able to pinpoint locations within a few yards, most civilian devices would have a built-in imprecision of about 330 feet.</p>
        <p>On May 1, President Clinton announced that he was ending selective availability, bringing the accuracy of devices for users worldwide down to within several feet. Mr. Clinton predicted that the benefits would be plentiful. ''For example,'' he said, ''emergency teams responding to a cry for help can now determine what side of the highway they must respond to, thereby saving precious minutes.''</p>
        <p>Of course, hobbyists had other plans. Two days after Mr. Clinton's announcement, Dave Ulmer, a G.P.S. enthusiast from Beavercreek, Ore., posted a simple suggestion at alt.geo.satellite-nav. He wrote, ''Now that S.A. is off, we can start a worldwide Stash Game.'' There would be just one rule: ''Get some stuff; leave some stuff.''</p>
        <p>In a telephone interview, Mr. Ulmer said he had bought a receiver for snowmobiling. But he immediately grasped the fact that shutting off selective availability meant that ''for the first time in the world, you could just be given coordinates and find a small object on the planet Earth.''</p>
        <p>The next day, Mr. Ulmer announced that he had left a stash near Portland, Ore., and gave the coordinates. Mr. Teague read the notice and found the cache on May 6.</p>
        <p>''I was hooked in right there,'' Mr. Teague said. ''I had actually found something with my G.P.S.'' (The five-gallon plastic bucket contained software disks, a can of beans and a slingshot.) Mr. Teague, in turn, buried two caches in the lava mounds and fields near Mount St. Helens.</p>
        <p>Within days, caches were popping up around the nation, with a quick-and-dirty Web site (www.triax.com /yngwie/gps.html) to keep track.</p>
        <p>The geocachers say that there is  more to finding a cache than simply following an arrow on a screen. Getting to the caches can involve strenuous climbing and hiking, and then a little looking around. In doing so, they happen upon great natural sites and vistas.</p>
        <p>Jeremy Irish, a Web site designer in Bellevue, Wash., who maintains the leading site for the game, www.geocaching.com, found one of Mr. Teague's stashes -- one of eight that he has hunted down. ''There were bugs all over the place,'' he said. ''But it was worth it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Irish said he hoped that his polished site would promote the game through corporate sponsorship of expensive caches -- true treasures. But, he said, the real fun he derives from the game is ''tricking eggheads to go out there and do some hiking to seek out these caches.''</p>
        <p>Getting the tech set to trek outdoors is no small feat, Mr. Casinghino said. ''The people I live with here at Marist, and especially the people online, they're all hard-core computer users,'' he said. ''When they're not at class or at work, they sit in front of their machines all day. There's this mind-set that if you can't do it with a good computer, it's not worth doing.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Casinghino said he chafed at that. ''You can't do everything in life sitting in front of a monitor,'' he said. ''You have to go out to do stuff.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Casinghino experienced the culture clash on Slashdot, a Web site where the geekerati discuss technology, popular culture and issues of the day. A brief article about geocaching was met with scorn.</p>
        <p>''This sounds like a very good idea for people other than me,'' wrote a participant in the discussion. ''It's not like I am going to travel a couple of hours (at the least) to go rooting through someone's garbage.''</p>
        <p>Another wrote: ''I'm not opening no bucket someone left somewhere, thank you very much.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Casinghino stands up for his hobby. ''I get a lot of 'Why bother? What's the use? Go out, find a bucket, write your name on a piece of paper, leave? It's a waste of time,' '' he said. ''The same can be said of just about anything. Why sit in front of a computer 24-7? Why read this book? Why watch that TV show?'' This is recreation, he said. ''And Sometimes  recreation is supposed to be a waste of time.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ulmer, however, said he had moved on. ''I have no problem with geocaching,'' he said. ''But it just got a little old to me, finding a bucket full of goodies.''</p>
