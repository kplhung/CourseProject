        <p>WHAT magic ingredients turn a designer like India Mahdavi into a success in three years' time? The answer is talent, certainly, but also luck and an eclectic background that marks her work as exotic, global and sophisticated.</p>
        <p>Her influences range from classical to cutting-edge: from the Ecole des Beaux Arts in Paris, where she received an architecture degree, to Cooper Union in New York, with its reliance on the craft of building and exploration of materials.</p>
        <p>Note that she is also in a field where successful men strikingly outnumber successful women. Since taking on her first client in 1997, India Mahdavi, 37, has opened a Paris design studio, IMH Interiors; succeeded Philippe Starck in designing the next hotel for Ian Schrager, the Empire, opposite Lincoln Center; fashioned a breezy hotel in Miami and a private nightclub in New York; and come up with a new concept for Givenchy stores worldwide -- the first will open in Paris next spring.</p>
        <p>So what is her style? ''You can't pin it down to a specific influence or reference,'' said Yann Le Coadic, a freelance interior designer in Paris, who says the French call the look faux coordonne -- meaning something appears to have been conceived of as a single thing but ''on close inspection is composed of elements coming from different sources.'' He added, ''Every detail of a space India designs is thought out to the millimeter, and yet the overall impression is very uncontrived. India focuses on how a space will be lived and not what visual impression it will make.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Mahdavi began working for Christian Liaigre in 1990, when he had just redesigned  the interiors of the Montalembert Hotel in Paris, the project that put him on the map. Mr. Liaigre's studio had a staff of only four, and ''I was able to do a little of everything,'' Ms. Mahdavi said. The studio later tripled in size, and she become the art director.</p>
        <p>In 1994, Ms. Mahdavi met Derek Hudson, a photojournalist, when he walked into Mr. Liaigre's shop. Two years later, she gave birth to their son, Miles.</p>
        <p>''Having a baby changes your perspective,'' she said. And after working with Mr. Liaigre on the tailored Mercer Hotel in New York, she began a solo career working from home. ''I didn't have a clue how things were going to work out,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Only a few weeks later, she got her first big commission: two shops, a line of furniture and the office headquarters for the fashion retailer Joseph in London. Joseph Ettedgui, who runs Joseph, hired her on instinct, convinced she could be a lead designer.</p>
        <p>Why? ''Her attitude,'' he said. ''It was a pleasure working with her, which is not always the case with gifted people.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Mahdavi designed eight pieces of furniture for his men's store on Sloane Avenue. They included typical bachelor items: a daybed, mirror and free-standing suit racks with masculine, graphic lines in sycamore and wenge wood. She used clothing fabric like navy pinstripe for upholstery. British critics gave rave reviews.</p>
        <p>A few private residences in London followed, and then America came calling. Jonathan Morr, a New York restaurateur who owns Bond Street and Republic, asked her to create an ''undesigned'' hotel in Miami, called Townhouse. Because there was no way to build a swimming pool, she created a roof terrace. Guests can sunbathe on queen-size water beds or wade in a fountain that she put inside an old water tower, adding tiled walls and benches. Throughout, Ms. Mahdavi used colors inspired by sand and sky and created multifunctional furniture suitable for gathering, dozing or having a room service meal.  Benches offer a selection of daily newspapers, and there's an exercise bike at the end of each corridor facing a window.</p>
        <p>''Miami is basically a beach place,'' Ms. Mahdavi said. ''Why try to do some chic European thing when all you really want in Miami is to get a little suntan, sit on a terrace with a drink, go out at night, feel at home?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Morr encountered the same practical attitude when he asked her to design an invitation-only New York hangout, tentatively called the Apartment. (He will give its location only as 13th Street, in the meatpacking district.) ''When I asked India if she'd design a nightclub for me, she said she never goes out to bars and clubs so she wouldn't know what to do,'' he said. ''Then she suggested the idea of entertaining in an apartment, because that is what she does when she sees friends.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Mahdavi said the space, which occupies 2,500 square feet on two floors of a seven-story building, has the scale of a real apartment. ''You even have to ring the bell,'' she said. ''There is an open kitchen, dining table, sofa area, even a bed. It's meant to feel like an open house with friends coming and going.'' Invited friends, that is.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schrager saw her work on the Miami hotel and heard about her from Mr. Ettedgui. ''India is a great stylist in the genre of Andree Putman,'' he said, referring to the Parisian interior designer who was his collaborator (along with Steve Rubell) at Morgans hotel in the 80's. ''She has a tremendous amount of strength and she's inventive and original. That's a potent combination.'' The Empire hotel, which he sees as ''the next generation of Morgans'' -- with vibrant colors instead of black, white and grays -- is expected to open in 2001.</p>
        <p>Ms. Mahdavi was born in Tehran of an Iranian father and a half-Egyptian, half-Scottish mother. The family moved to Cambridge, Mass., when Ms. Mahdavi was an infant and her father, an economist, entered the M.B.A. program at Harvard University.  The family then moved to Germany and ultimately to the south of France. Ms. Mahdavi was raised with four siblings in a home where French and English were spoken.</p>
        <p>At age 7, she began attending the progressive Ecole Freinet, near Nice, where students defined their own studies and activities and pottery was seen as equal to math.</p>
        <p>''It was up to each student to take initiative to choose what they wanted to do, carry it out and present it,'' Ms. Mahdavi said. ''The Ecole Freinet had a big impact on me. It is where I learned to have confidence in my choices.''</p>
        <p>Though she wanted to study filmmaking, ''there were no accessible film schools in Paris at that time,'' she said, ''so I thought I'd do like Fritz Lang and study architecture first.'' She completed the seven-year program at the Ecole des Beaux Arts, but her first job persuaded her to try another profession. ''I never liked the ambience of architects' offices,'' she said. ''They give me the blues.''</p>
        <p>Finding interior design more lively, she headed to New York City, where she spent a year studying graphics at Parsons, furniture at Cooper Union and industrial design at the School of Visual Arts.</p>
        <p>Her style is rooted in a modern elegance that marries the contemporary with the tried and true. One of her best-selling designs, a floor tray nearly six feet long called Celibataire, is meant to sit under stacks of books and magazines or under pictures leaning against a wall.</p>
        <p>''I like the idea of an accessory that becomes a piece of furniture,'' she said. (The tray can be ordered from IMH Interiors at 3, rue Las Cases, 75007 Paris, 011-331-45.51.63.89, for about $400, plus shipping.)</p>
        <p>Her home, in the Left Bank neighborhood of St.-Germain-des-Pres, is a reflection of her ever-evolving ideas. An L-shaped, high-backed corner bench that Ms. Mahdavi designed sits in the dining area next to a table she inherited from her grandmother and a 1950's swivel chair she bought in Miami. In the living area an orange velvet love seat and matching screen, which she also designed, mix with pieces that influence and inspire her: a three-legged Adnet metal stool upholstered in leather, a 40's plexiglass chair coupled with a Pierre Paulin desk from the 60's, a Royere side table, a bronze cylindrical stool by the contemporary French designer Eric Schmidtt.</p>
        <p>''I like mixing things,'' she said. ''My apartment doesn't have to be all about me and what I do.''</p>
        <p>It seems her only fear is becoming successful too quickly. ''One should always be able to make mistakes, because that is how you learn,'' she said. ''But it is hard when everyone is looking at you. It's not that I don't trust my talent, but I am so much at the beginning of what I could do.''</p>
