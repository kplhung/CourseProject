        <p>Divers entered the wreck of the Russian submarine Kursk for the first time today and removed the bodies of three of the 118 crewmen entombed there in one of Russia's worst naval disasters.</p>
        <p>The three bodies, placed in special containers, were lifted through a hole cut in the submarine's triple-layer hull and brought to the surface about 7:40 p.m. (12:40 p.m. Eastern time), a spokesman for the navy's Northern Fleet command said.</p>
        <p>[Reuters reported that a fourth body was recovered early Thursday.]</p>
        <p>Forecasts of worsening weather over the Barents Sea site of the wreck, off Russia's northwest coast, left the course of the recovery operation uncertain. But the chief of staff of the Northern Fleet, Vice Adm. Mikhail Motsak, indicated that the navy was determined to continue.</p>
        <p>''One thing can be definitely said: none of the compartments will be sealed or work in them wrapped up until they have been examined by our divers in detail,'' he told Russia's RTR state-run television network.</p>
        <p>The first three bodies apparently were found in one or both of compartments No. 8 and No. 9, located farthest from the scene of two explosions that ripped open the submarine and sank it at a depth of more than 300 feet on Aug. 12.</p>
        <p>As many as 10 sailors had been stationed in those two compartments, and initial reports said that no bodies had been found in either. That sparked speculation that the crew had survived long enough after the first explosions aboard the submarine to rush to other parts of the vessel.</p>
        <p>Information was sketchy tonight, and it was not clear whether other bodies might remain in the two compartments. Early in the day, one Russian diver had to stop explorations after moving about 20 feet into the ninth compartment because his air hose was too short.</p>
        <p>The retrieval of the remains, after five days of underwater planning and work, was a technical triumph for an operation that even naval officials had speculated was too dangerous to carry out.</p>
        <p>President Vladimir V. Putin ordered the bodies retrieved and reburied after suffering a public rebuke over what many called the government's ham-handed response to the Kursk disaster. The submarine lay underwater for nearly a week after its sinking, supposedly too badly damaged for any successful rescue, before a team of Norwegian and British divers was allowed to approach it. They quickly opened a hatch and determined that everyone inside was dead.</p>
        <p>Divers used torches to cut an access hole in the Kursk's hull, one of seven holes that must be carved if the recovery operation is to be completed. Military planners say they hope to raise the submarine once the recovery is complete, a task that would not be feasible until next year's summer weather.</p>
