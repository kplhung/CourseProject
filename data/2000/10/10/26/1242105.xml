        <p>Manna Soul Food &amp; Salad Bar, on Frederick Douglass Boulevard and 125th Street, reopened this month after undergoing a $500,000 expansion. Located opposite the new Harlem U.S.A. shopping center, the restaurant opened in 1983 as the tiny B &amp; R Barbecue, named for its owners, Betty and Rick Park, immigrants from Korea. Now expanded to two floors, the cafeteria-style restaurant -- one of the few alternatives to fast food on 125th Street -- can seat 90 people. Several new restaurants have opened in Harlem recently, including Amy Ruth's, at 116th Street between Lenox and Seventh Avenues; Bayou, on Lenox Avenue between 125th and 126th Streets; Londel's Supper Club, on Frederick Douglass between 139th and 140th Streets; and Miss Maude's, on Lenox Avenue between 137th and 138th Streets.</p>
