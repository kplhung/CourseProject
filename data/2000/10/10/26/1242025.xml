        <p>State Department officials told Congress today that a 1995 deal approved by Vice President Al Gore allowing Russia to sell a large cache of conventional weapons to Iran was legal and did not threaten American security.</p>
        <p>The agreement, signed in 1995 by Mr. Gore and Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, the former Russian prime minister, exempted Russia from a law requiring that economic sanctions be imposed on countries that sell arms to nations that sponsor terrorism, including Iran.</p>
        <p>The 1992 law was sponsored by then-Senator Gore and Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona.</p>
        <p>''The 1995 understanding was fully consistent with U.S. law,'' said John P. Barker, deputy assistant secretary of state for nonproliferation control. He appeared today before a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.</p>
        <p>Senator Sam Brownback, Republican of Kansas, convened the hearing to draw attention to what he contends was a flawed deal by Mr. Gore that was illegally concealed from Congress.</p>
        <p>The agreement required Russia to stop all sales of conventional weapons to Iran by the end of 1999. But the sales have continued past that deadline, prompting complaints to Moscow by Mr. Gore and Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright.</p>
        <p>In a classified message to Igor S. Ivanov, the Russian foreign minister, Dr. Albright noted that arms deliveries from Moscow to Tehran continued unabated despite the 1999 deadline. She reminded him of the 1995 agreement that exempted Moscow from sanctions under United States laws and said that continued arms sales could subject Moscow to stiff economic sanctions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barker argued that the agreement prevented what would have been even larger sales to Iran.</p>
        <p>''Had not the U.S. secured this commitment,'' Mr. Barker told the senators, ''Russia would have been free to provide Iran with advanced conventional arms, and greater overall quantities of conventional arms.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Barker said that the weapons that Russia sold to Iran did not trigger the sanctions law because they did not meet the act's definition of advanced conventional weaponry and did not destabilize the Persian Gulf region.</p>
        <p>The weapons permitted under the Gore-Chernomyrdin deal included a sophisticated Kilo-class diesel submarine with long-range torpedoes, hundreds of tanks and armored personnel carriers and thousands of mines, bombs and artillery shells.</p>
        <p>''Frankly, these were hard calls,'' Mr. Barker said. But he added that top Pentagon officials had advised that the arms did not threaten American forces in the region and that an agreement to bring an end to Russian sales to Iran was in the nation's interest.</p>
        <p>The outlines of the deal were announced publicly in Moscow and provided to Congress in a briefing five years ago, but important details were never disclosed to Congress. Previously undisclosed aspects of the agreement were detailed in an article in The New York Times this month.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barker said that some documents relating to the deal remain classified and warned that continued publicity about the matter could endanger efforts to halt international traffic in dangerous arms.</p>
        <p>''Playing this out in the press can only have a chilling effect on our ability to continue the process and could seriously undermine the U.S. national security interests at stake,'' Mr. Barker said.</p>
        <p>Senator Brownback expressed frustration with the administration's refusal to provide Congress with documents that spell out the terms of the Gore-Chernomyrdin agreement.</p>
        <p>He complained that the administration's explanation -- that the agreement was not a binding international agreement that did not need to be submitted to Congress -- was ''hairsplitting'' that undermines public confidence in elected officials.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brownback said that Republicans on the foreign affairs committee were considering issuing a subpoena to the administration to force disclosure of the documents describing the deal.</p>
        <p>''I thought today because we agreed to do it in closed session they'd give us the agreements and the supporting documentation,'' Senator Brownback said in an interview. ''But they refused. They stiffed us.''</p>
        <p>In Moscow, Mr. Chernomyrdin said today that the criticism in Congress of his deal with Mr. Gore was politically inspired, and he defended the arrangement as serving the interests of the United States and Russia.</p>
        <p>''What we did with Iran posed no threat to the U.S.,'' Mr. Chernomyrdin said, according to a report by The Associated Press. ''They were waiting for this moment just before the election. They are playing the Russian card.''</p>
