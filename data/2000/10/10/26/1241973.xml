        <p>With the population about to get decidedly older and the nation enjoying a moment of prosperity, Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush agree that now is the time to put Social Security on sound footing for generations to come.</p>
        <p>But their deep differences about how to do so have made the future of the retirement system one of the most supercharged issues of the presidential campaign, and the first test of whether Social Security's status as politically untouchable has been altered by the fact that more than half of all households now own stocks.</p>
        <p>The debate has turned vigorous and occasionally nasty in the campaign's final weeks, with each campaign throwing around big numbers to suggest that the other side's approach is irresponsible.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore, playing to older voters who turn out reliably at the polls, has been asserting that Mr. Bush's plan would drain from the system $1 trillion needed to pay benefits to current retirees. Casting themselves as the true reformers, Mr. Bush, of Texas, and his advisers said Mr. Gore's plan would saddle today's young people with $40 trillion in debt.</p>
        <p>Each side has a point, though each is arguably exaggerating to make it. In any case, neither candidate's plan by itself would assure Social Security's solvency for the next 75 years, the benchmark the system uses to assess its financial stability. And both candidates have avoided acknowledging that fully restoring Social Security's health would almost inevitably require choosing from among a menu of politically painful options including benefit reductions and tax increases.</p>
        <p>''When you look at the big picture, neither of them has solved the whole problem or addressed the details and the pain issue,'' said Ron Gebhardtsbauer, senior pension fellow at the American Academy of Actuaries, a nonpartisan research organization.</p>
        <p>Driven by projections that the retirement system will run short of the money it needs to pay all benefits within a few decades, both candidates are proposing what would be the most sweeping changes to Social Security since its inception in 1935.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush wants to harness the power of the financial markets by allowing individuals to invest a portion of their Social Security payroll taxes in stocks and bonds.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore wants to leave the system unchanged and maintain the current level of guaranteed benefits even as the number of retirees grows substantially. To do so he would supplement payroll tax revenues with general income tax receipts. Separately, he has proposed tax incentives to help low and middle income people save for retirement outside of Social Security.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Bush's proposal would bring more far-reaching changes to the system, each approach is revolutionary in its own way.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's plan would move the system away from its identity as a collective pact under which each generation of workers helps support the retirement of its predecessors. The Bush plan would nudge the system in the direction of having each worker save for his or her own retirement, shifting both opportunities and risks to individuals.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's plan would end the tradition of Social Security being wholly self-financed through the payroll tax, and in the long run would require higher taxes, reduced spending or additional government borrowing. Critics say the change would undermine support for Social Security by making it more like welfare than a pension, a pawn in the unceasing battle over taxes and spending.</p>
        <p>Social Security's difficulties are rooted in demographic trends. As the population ages, the proportion of working people to retirees is declining. In 1960, there were more than 5 workers for every Social Security beneficiary; today there are 3.3, and by 2030 the figure will be 2.</p>
        <p>Those proportions are important because of the way Social Security raises money to pay benefits. Workers and their employers split a 12.4 percent payroll tax. But the levy is not set aside to pay benefits for the workers who pay it; rather, it goes to pay benefits to current retirees.</p>
        <p>Right now the system is generating more than enough money to pay all benefits. Payroll tax receipts will exceed benefit payments by more than $900 billion over the next decade, allowing the system to invest that surplus in government bonds. If interest payments from the bonds are included, the surplus over the next 10 years will be more than $2 trillion.</p>
        <p>But that favorable situation will deteriorate rapidly as the 76 million baby boomers begin retiring. By 2015, payroll tax revenue will no longer cover benefit payments.</p>
        <p>At that point, Social Security will need to start drawing on the interest income from its bond holdings -- the Social Security Trust Fund. That means the government will have to start appropriating money out of general tax revenues each year to begin supporting Social Security.</p>
        <p>By 2025, even the combination of payroll tax revenue and interest payments on the bonds will no longer cover benefits, forcing the system to redeem the bonds it holds.</p>
        <p>If nothing is done, Social Security will have exhausted its store of bonds in 2037, leaving it totally reliant on payroll tax revenue to pay benefits. Payroll taxes at that point would cover just over 70 percent of promised benefits.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's plan would allow workers to place into their own investment accounts each year a little more than one-sixth of what they and their employers currently contribute directly to Social Security -- that is, 2 percentage points of the 12.4 percent payroll tax.</p>
        <p>The idea is that workers would benefit from the higher rates of return available over the long run in the financial markets. Increasing the rate of return would narrow the gap between what Social Security can afford to pay in benefits and what it has promised.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's plan would be voluntary. People who are retired or near retirement would not see any changes in benefits.</p>
        <p>For those who do participate, Mr. Bush has said, there would be a menu of relatively safe and conservative investment options available.</p>
        <p>But his approach creates problems that Mr. Bush avoids discussing. The most immediate is that allowing workers to place a portion of their payroll taxes in a private accounts reduces the amount of money available to pay benefits.</p>
        <p>Prodded by Mr. Gore in their final debate last week, Mr. Bush acknowledged that he would need to use $1 trillion out of the surplus over the next decade to cover the shortfall created by the establishment of personal accounts.</p>
        <p>Because Social Security is projected to run a surplus of more than $2 trillion during that period, using $1 trillion for private accounts would not immediately imperil the system's ability to pay full benefits to current retirees, as Mr. Gore has implied it would.</p>
        <p>But it would substantially move up the date at which Social Security would run through its store of bonds and become completely reliant on payroll tax revenue.</p>
        <p>According to the Gore camp, diverting two percentage points of the payroll tax into personal investment accounts would exhaust the trust fund in 2023, 14 years earlier than under the current system. In 2024, assuming no other changes are made, the system would be short of the money needed to pay benefits by hundreds of billions of dollars.</p>
        <p>One partial solution would be to reduce the guaranteed Social Security benefit for those people participating in the private accounts plan. The idea would be that the investment returns from the private account, plus the reduced guaranteed benefit, would still leave retirees, at least those young enough to have participated in the plan, just as well off.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Bush and his advisers have declined to say if they would reduce the guaranteed benefit, a step that would clearly open a new line of attack for Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>Indeed, Mr. Bush has not been willing to provide any details of how their plan would work, saying the specifics would have to be hashed out in a bipartisan way between Congress and a Bush administration.</p>
        <p>A guide to what a complete Bush plan might look like comes from similar plans introduced in Congress in recent years. All of them would cut guaranteed benefits, pump substantial amounts of general revenues into the system or require individuals to return to the system a portion of their investment gains from the personal accounts.</p>
        <p>The possible benefit cuts include such politically unpopular steps as raising the retirement age and reducing annual cost of living adjustments. And Mr. Bush has not given any indication of whether or how workers would be insulated from the risk of a stock market downturn around the time they retire.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's approach would dedicate nearly all of the Social Security surplus to paying off the $3.4 trillion national debt within a dozen years.</p>
        <p>Starting in 2011, Mr. Gore would then allocate to Social Security, out of general tax revenues, an amount equal to the interest saved from debt reduction -- $250 billion a year by 2016. The additional money, and the interest paid on it, would extend the system's solvency to 2054 from 2037.</p>
        <p>On Monday, Mr. Bush said the revenue transferred to Social Security by Mr. Gore's plan, plus interest, would total nearly $40 trillion over four decades ending in 2050. That huge sum, Mr. Bush said, would weigh down the economy and future generations of taxpayers.</p>
        <p>Aides to Mr. Gore said the $40 trillion number had to be considered in the context of the size of the problem. Using the same type of calculation, they said, Mr. Bush's plan would require $57 trillion between 2023 and 2054 to keep the system solvent, unless Mr. Bush was willing to reduce guaranteed benefit payments or increase the payroll tax.</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Gore's reliance on general revenues means much of the bill would be borne by people decades down the road in the form of higher taxes, reduced spending or increased borrowing.</p>
