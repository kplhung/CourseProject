        <p>Darryl Strawberry was arrested yesterday on charges of violating his probation after he slipped out of a Tampa drug clinic and smoked crack cocaine and popped Xanax pills, Florida prison officials said.</p>
        <p>Strawberry, who is fighting colon cancer, has been on probation in Florida since he was convicted of possessing cocaine in May 1999. He was also suspended from baseball this season for cocaine abuse. He has not played since last year's World Series, in which he was a pinch-hitter for the Yankees, and at 38 he no longer seems to have a viable future as a baseball player.</p>
        <p>Strawberry was being held without bail at the Hillsborough County Jail, said Debbie Buchanan, a spokeswoman for the Florida Department of Corrections.</p>
        <p>Prison officials filed a motion requesting that Strawberry be sentenced to 30 days in the county jail and then sent back to the private drug clinic for the remainder of his two years of probation. They are also asking a judge to order him to wear an electronic bracelet that would allow his parole officer to track his movements.</p>
        <p>The arrest was the latest turn in the downward spiral Strawberry's life has taken since he was found to have colon cancer just before the 1998 World Series. He underwent surgery and chemotherapy, and rejoined the team the next spring. But in May 1999, a Tampa police officer arrested him on charges of soliciting a prostitute and possessing drugs. He was sentenced to a year and a half of probation. Baseball suspended him for three months.</p>
        <p>Last February, he failed a drug test required by Major League Baseball, and Commissioner Bud Selig suspended him for the 2000 season. In August, his colon cancer returned and he underwent surgery to remove a second tumor. Last month, Strawberry was arrested by an off-duty police officer in Tampa after he blacked out and drove his car through a street sign and into the rear of car stopped at a red light. He later admitted that he had been under the influence of sleeping pills and painkillers he was taking as part of his cancer treatment.</p>
        <p>Strawberry could have been sent to jail for violating his probation at that point, but Judge Florence Foster of the Hillsborough County Court sentenced him to two years of house arrest at a drug treatment clinic. He was prohibited from leaving the center without permission from his probation officer, Shelley Tomlinson.</p>
        <p>But on Saturday, Strawberry slipped away from the clinic without permission around 11 p.m., officials said. He did not come back until 3 a.m. Sunday. Later that day, he admitted to Tomlinson that he had smoked cocaine with ''a woman named Christine'' and had taken 10 Xanax pills, a tranquilizer prescribed by doctors for anxiety, according to court papers.</p>
