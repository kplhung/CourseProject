        <p>For more than a year, the smartest money in both major political parties on both coasts held that Gov. George W. Bush could not win California, that his positions on gun control, abortion and the environment were out of step with voters in a state where the Republican Party was reeling. Most of the smart money still thinks that Mr. Bush will not win here, but it is harder these days to find experts in either party who say flatly that he cannot.</p>
        <p>As the candidates seesaw for the lead in national polls, the race has tightened in the biggest state of all. Mr. Bush is suddenly giving Al Gore a run for his money here in the one state that most experts say the vice president must win to take the White House.</p>
        <p>More precisely, the California Republican Party is spending $1.5 million a week on television advertisements in support of Mr. Bush, including a new round of Spanish-language advertisements to start this week, while the Democrats are not spending a dime on television, and have no plans to, though they plan to run some radio commercials and -- at the request of Gov. Gray Davis -- to import President Clinton for a final get-out-the-vote tour.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore, who has courted California assiduously in his eight years in the White House, has not visited the state since Sept. 20 and has no plans to return before Election Day. By contrast, Mr. Bush has spent 30 days in the state since June 1999, and is to come back next week to campaign and appear on the ''Tonight'' show with Jay Leno.</p>
        <p>Meantime, the Green Party candidate, Ralph Nader, has been digging into Mr. Gore's once-double-digit lead in a state where voters tend to be more liberal than the national norm on issues like offshore oil drilling and restrictions on handguns.</p>
        <p>''We're talking about a much tighter race in California than anyone expected, and voter turnout is going to be crucial,'' said Mark Baldassare, survey director of the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California.</p>
        <p>The institute's latest statewide poll ending last week found that Mr. Gore's lead over Mr. Bush had shrunk to five points among likely voters, 44 percent to 39 percent, with 6 percent for Mr. Nader. That is half the size of Mr. Gore's lead in the same poll a month ago, and some Democratic consultants say their own private surveys show the race even closer (within the margin of sampling error) among the likeliest voters. A Los Angeles Times poll, concluded on Monday and published today, showed Mr. Gore with a seven-point lead, 48 percent to 41 percent for Mr. Bush, with Mr. Nader at 5 percent.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's advisers say they are confident that his campaign has stabilized and is trending upward again after the dip that coincided with his performance in the first two presidential debates. But the unsettled situation here reflects the overall volatility of a close race, in which Mr. Gore finds himself struggling in states he should have locked up long ago, like Tennessee, his home state, and in which Mr. Bush is in a close contest in Florida, where his brother is governor and he had figured on a strong advantage.</p>
        <p>''We have a triple threat,'' said Paul Maslin, a California-based Democratic pollster for Governor Davis and other national figures. ''They have more money, their base has more energy and we have a drag from Nader.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush still faces formidable obstacles here. Mr. Gore holds a comfortable advantage among voters on most issues, from education to health care, Social Security and Medicare, and The Los Angeles Times poll shows that just over half of California voters have an unfavorable opinion of Mr. Bush, while 6 in 10 view Mr. Gore favorably.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Gore has lost support to Mr. Nader, other minor-party candidates and the undecided column, Mr. Bush has not gained support, according to the Public Policy Institute poll. Among Hispanic voters, a group Mr. Bush has taken great pains to court, Mr. Gore still leads by ratios of better than two to one, and Mr. Bush's showing is little better than that of Dan Lungren, the party's failed nominee for governor here in 1998.</p>
        <p>Even Mr. Bush's advisers here are cautious in a state where Democrats hold an 11-point edge in voter registration and control all but one statewide office and both houses of the Legislature. Told by a reporter that Mr. Bush seemed to be doing well, his state campaign chairman, Gerald Parsky, said quickly, ''Better.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Parsky also noted that the campaign had done what it said it would more than a year ago, by bringing Mr. Bush to the state often for major policy speeches and appearances, by raising money to help the state party retire its debt, by grass-roots organizing intended to field 30,000 volunteers to help get out the vote on Election Day and by backing it all up with paid television advertising. The campaign began with a modest $600,000 a week statewide advertising push just after Labor Day and accelerated its efforts two weeks ago.</p>
        <p>In his appearances here, Mr. Bush has gone out of his way to try to soften the bad aftertaste, among Hispanic voters especially, left by Gov. Pete Wilson's strong campaigns against illegal immigration and affirmative action, and to reflect the reality that successful Republican presidents since the days of Dwight D. Eisenhower have all had a substantial political base here.</p>
        <p>''I know people didn't believe us, and it's been an uphill battle,'' Mr. Parsky said. ''But I really think we've made progress. I believe if we can be within five points on Election Day, then our grass-roots effort can put us over the top.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, Democrats here are more than a little worried about turnout. Partly because the Gore campaign long ago declared the state safe, there has been little sense of urgency here, and Mr. Gore has never managed to generate the enthusiasm among California Democrats that Mr. Clinton did in two aggressive campaigns. Mr. Bush is leading in traditional swing areas like the Central Valley and the Inland Empire east of Los Angeles, while Mr. Nader is drawing double-digit support in the San Francisco Bay area, which should be a Democratic stronghold.</p>
        <p>Last week, reflecting pent-up frustrations, Governor Davis's chief political adviser, Garry South, issued a sharp public warning that the Gore campaign risked taking the state for granted and pleading for more support. After his comments caused a stir, Mr. South swiftly took pains to say that Mr. Gore would still win, but his point was not lost on Republicans, who for the last two elections have found themselves pleading with their national party for a serious effort in a state that former President George Bush's aides publicly abandoned in 1992 and where Bob Dole made a desperate last-minute push in 1996.</p>
        <p>''The Democrats are sitting in the shoes we've been in for years,'' said Leslie Goodman, a Republican consultant in Sacramento.</p>
        <p>In fact, Democratic operatives here note that Mr. Davis has his own reasons for wanting a stronger Democratic presence on the airwaves. He has staked his prestige on a ballot initiative to lower the approval threshold for local school bonds to 55 percent, and though polls show the measure drawing majority support, Democrats fear that the measure might fail if Democratic turnout is low.</p>
        <p>Gore campaign officials profess confidence.</p>
        <p>''Every piece of evidence that we rely on shows that Al Gore remains in a very strong position in California,'' said Mark Fabiani, Mr. Gore's deputy campaign manager. ''We watch it very closely. It's obviously a critical state for us. But Al Gore's positions on the issues are so much more in sync with Californians than Bush's are.''</p>
        <p>But other Democrats here point to more complicated realities. Mr. Gore is fighting fires on too many other fronts to suddenly open an advertising campaign in California's brutally expensive media markets, and the mere act of doing so could set off broader anxiety about his campaign's overall prospects that could have a snowball effect.</p>
        <p>''Unfortunately for the Gore campaign, they set up a perception for a long, long time that they were safe here, and they sold it and they spun it and they're stuck with it,'' said a Democratic operative here who spoke on the condition of anonymity but worries that Mr. Gore is vulnerable here. ''I sympathize with them, and they've got other states to worry about. But we are not crying wolf.''</p>
