        <p>Hillary Rodham Clinton said yesterday that she would return $50,000 in political contributions received at a fund-raising event sponsored by a Muslim organization based in California.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton said she was offended by remarks attributed to members of the organization, the American Muslim Alliance. The group's president has been quoted as defending a United Nations resolution that he said allowed for the use of armed force by Palestinians against Israel, while other members have been accused of making anti-Semitic remarks.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's decision to return the money, as well as $1,000 from an official of another American Muslim group, the American Muslim Council, puzzled leaders of both Muslim organizations. The groups acknowledge that they have some members with extreme views on Israel, but say that they are mainstream and oppose terrorism. Officials in the groups yesterday took issue with the characterizations of the remarks.</p>
        <p>Members of the groups contribute to Republicans and Democrats alike, and have been courted by various politicians, including Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. He recently met with the American Muslim Council in Michigan, which has a sizable Arab-American population, and received its backing. The council also says it considers Senator Joseph I. Lieberman a friend, and it gave him an award a few years ago.</p>
        <p>The Bush campaign said yesterday it would return $1,000 that had been donated by Abdurahman Alamoudi, a board member of the American Muslim Council, who was quoted in interviews as supporting the radical Islamic group Hamas.</p>
        <p>The fund-raising disclosures, first reported yesterday in The Daily News, thrust Middle East politics into the center of the close New York Senate race and set off a daylong exchange of denunciations between the campaigns, which have been wooing Jewish voters. Mrs. Clinton's opponent, Representative Rick A. Lazio, called the donations ''blood money.''</p>
        <p>Rallying to Mrs. Clinton's defense were prominent New York Jews, including former Mayor Edward I. Koch and Senator Charles E. Schumer. The first lady's campaign staff also released a television commercial showing Representative Nita M. Lowey in support of Mrs. Clinton.</p>
        <p>At a news conference in Queens, Mrs. Clinton announced that she would return the money. ''The statements that are attributed to the organization and some of its members are offensive and outrageous,'' she said. ''I don't want anyone to be under a misimpression. I don't want anyone to have a false idea about what I believed was the case, so I am going to return all of the money.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton also said she would return $1,000 to Mr. Alamoudi of the American Muslim Council. She said she did not know that the fund-raising event, which was held in Boston in June, had been sponsored by the American Muslim Alliance even though she was photographed at the event accepting a plaque from the chairman of the group's Massachusetts chapter.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio spent part of his day campaigning in Monsey, speaking with girls at a yeshiva, meeting with three rebbes and wearing a skullcap with his name knitted in it, as he spoke about Israel. Earlier, he said the donations were evidence of the candidates' differences on Israel. His campaign also criticized Mrs. Clinton for playing host to several White House receptions that were attended by people opposed to the peace process in the Middle East.</p>
        <p>During a campaign appearance in the Bronx, Mr. Lazio said, ''My dad used to say, an old saying which I keep with me all the time, show me who your friends are, and I'll tell you who you are.''</p>
        <p>That touched off another round of criticism from the Clinton campaign, which pointed out that Mr. Lazio once said he would not mind running for Senate on the Reform Party line, even if Patrick J. Buchanan, who has been criticized as an anti-Semite, was at the top of that ticket.</p>
        <p>The two Muslim groups belong to the larger American Muslim Political Coordination Council Political Action Committee, which endorsed Mr. Bush at a news conference in Washington on Monday. Tahir Ali, the Massachusetts chairman of the American Muslim Alliance, said he had held fund-raisers for both Democrats and Republicans, including Gov. Paul Cellucci of Massachusetts.</p>
        <p>Dr. Yahya Mossa-Basha, a radiologist in Michigan who is president of the American Muslim Council, said he had met twice with Mr. Bush -- once last month -- and once with Vice President Al Gore, Tipper Gore and Hadassah Lieberman. He said he had recently had discussions with the Gore campaign about meeting the vice president this Sunday, but no date had been set. He also said he was invited to a Lazio fund-raising event attended by Mr. Lazio last August in Michigan, but decided not to attend. The Lazio campaign said it did not invite Mr. Mossa-Basha, but said it did not know if a Lazio supporter had invited him.</p>
        <p>Faroque Khan, the chairman of the American Muslim Alliance's New York chapter, based on Long Island, said members had contributed to Mr. Lazio's Congressional campaigns over the years. He gave $300 to the election campaign of Gov. George E. Pataki in 1994.</p>
        <p>''If someone returns a gift, you feel hurt,'' said Mr. Ali, the Massachusetts chairman of the alliance and a software engineer in Westborough, Mass. ''But I mostly feel sorry for the first lady that she has been put in this position that she feels it will hurt to take our gift. So much for the Jewish community lobby. They are trying to intimidate her.''</p>
        <p>Agha Saeed, president of the alliance and a professor of political science, said his remarks had been distorted. He acknowledged that he had spoken publicly about armed resistance by the Palestinians, but he said it was always in the context of a United Nations resolution that he said gave the Palestinians the right to resist oppression by all means. And he said he always made it clear that he supported a peaceful settlement in the Middle East. (Mr. Saeed said the resolution was passed in the 1980's, but was unable to provide other details.)</p>
        <p>''I support the peace process,'' Mr. Saeed said. ''But people living in this country who are citizens have the right to criticize the Israelis. I insist upon having that right. If they kill people, we are going to criticize them.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Alamoudi, whose $1,000 contributions are to be returned by the Clinton and Bush campaigns, was out of the country and could not be reached for comment, Mr. Mossa-Basha said. But Mr. Mossa-Basha said that as an organization, the council is clear about Hamas and violence in the Middle East.</p>
        <p>''I think that all the time we are against violence and terrorism,'' he said. Hamas ''is an overseas issue and that is an issue of dispute between the Israelis and the Palestinians.'' He added, ''We do not want to get in the middle of it.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton implied that the Daily News article was prompted by the Republicans, suggesting that they would be eager to associate a prominent Democrat with the Muslim organizations at the time the groups were endorsing Mr. Bush. The Daily News, however, referred to research by Steven Emerson, who identified himself as a freelance journalist preparing a magazine article on terrorism; he became well known when he initially strongly suggested that the Oklahoma City bombing was the work of Arab terrorists. Mr. Emerson, who attended Mrs. Clinton's news conference, said Republicans and Democrats were both willing to associate with groups that he considered sympathetic to terrorists or aligned with them.</p>
        <p>In materials he made available to reporters, he accused the American Muslim Alliance of disseminating ''anti-Semitic tracts'' and said a Texas member had questioned the existence of gas chambers at Auschwitz.</p>
        <p>Mr. Saeed, president of the alliance, which is based in Fremont, Calif., said that Mr. Emerson had misquoted members and taken their statements out of context.</p>
        <p>Just a few months ago, when the peace process in the Middle East was less slippery, the issue of donations from a Muslim-American organization would have carried less significance among Jewish voters.</p>
        <p>''We have 13 days left in this election; fasten your seat belts,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ''This is just the beginning. You have no idea what is going to be thrown at me. It is going to be everything including the kitchen sink.''</p>
        <p>While distancing herself from the groups that contributed the money, she defended her larger efforts to encourage a dialogue between Jews and Muslims about the Middle East.</p>
        <p>''Over the course of the last seven years, as part of the administration's efforts to open lines of communication and build bridges with Muslim-American and Muslim leaders from all over the world, many, many people have been invited to the White House,'' she said. ''They were part of the effort taken by this administration to help facilitate the peace negotiations that all of us hoped would achieve a comprehensive peace agreement.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  October 28, 2000, Saturday  A front-page article on Thursday about Hillary Rodham Clinton's plans to return some political contributions, including one from a board member of the American Muslim Council, gave a misspelled name in some copies for Senator Joseph I. Lieberman's wife, who was in a group that the council president told of having met. She is Hadassah Lieberman, not Haddasah.</p>
