Scholastic.com features a daily news service, lesson planners and educational events. Mike Lorion, vice president for education at Palm, said the company could not say how many teachers or students currently used Palm hand-held devices, but he said students made up a large percentage of buyers of Palm's lower-priced m100 unit.</p>
