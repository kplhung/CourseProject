        <p>To hear Ahmed Qurei declare the Oslo peace track all but dead is to realize how much has unraveled in the last few weeks.</p>
        <p>Perhaps more than any one else, Mr. Qurei, who is known by the nom de guerre Abu Ala, embodied the Palestinian leadership's commitment to the rocky peace effort that began secretly in the Norwegian woods, where he himself walked leafy paths with Israeli officials. He became a Palestinian architect of the Oslo interim peace agreement of 1993 and has since assumed the role of business-like negotiator trusted by a series of Israeli and American officials for his access to Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, and his ability to close a deal.</p>
        <p>Now, however, Mr. Qurei has entered another era. He has not exactly buried Oslo, not publicly. To do so would be to turn his back too unequivocally on a process in which he has invested more than seven years. It would be, in effect, to say to the Palestinian opposition and to the Palestinian man on the street that they were right, the process was bankrupt after all.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Qurei did say today that ''the negotiations have become useless.'' He shrugged off Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's ''timeout'' from the peace talks, saying ''whether time out or time in, I don't see the difference.'' And he repudiated the format that he has accepted for years, American-brokered talks built on the original Oslo agreement and aimed toward a final peace accord that was supposed to have been sealed in May 1999.</p>
        <p>''There will have to be a new formula, a new structure'' with ''other international powers besides the U.S.'' assisting in the effort, Mr. Qurei said, betraying a new distrust of Washington's ability to act as a mediator. ''The old formula cannot be accepted anymore and doesn't lead to a permanent deal. There is no more trust between the Israelis and the Palestinians.''</p>
        <p>In response, Israel's acting foreign minister, Shlomo Ben Ami, who just last spring had a close working relationship with Mr. Qurei, insisted that it was premature to talk about the end of Oslo. If the violence stops, the three-way talks can be restarted; it would be fruitless to throw away the carefully negotiated agreements that already exist, he said.</p>
        <p>Smiling broadly, however, Mr. Qurei said acidly that Mr. Ben Ami, a soft-spoken academic and longtime dove, was ''a general now.'' He was referring to what Palestinians have been calling Israel's ''war'' against them, the conflict that has left more than 130 dead, almost all Palestinians.</p>
        <p>The Israelis have been saying that Mr. Arafat is no longer a ''peace partner.'' Mr. Qurei said today that Mr. Arafat was just not willing to be a partner in the peace that Israel, backed by the Americans, was trying to ''impose'' -- first at Camp David in July, and now ''through force.'' ''We know Mr. Barak came with a peace program and now he's ended with a war program,'' he said. ''He's preparing for the reoccupation of the West Bank.''</p>
        <p>To some Palestinian journalists listening to Mr. Qurei today at the Grand Park Hotel here, it seemed that their leadership was waking up belatedly to what common people have been saying: Oslo, as it is known in the vernacular, was not working, and they did not expect it to work.</p>
        <p>In the West Bank and Gaza, there have for years been many people who espoused peace but did not believe in the peace process. In seven years, as many Palestinians saw it, that process had left the Israeli military and economic occupation subtly and not so subtly intact, and their nationalist aspirations unfulfilled.</p>
        <p>The Palestinian Authority, with its own deep-seated problems, had assumed authority over most of the Palestinian population. But the Israelis were still everywhere: they controlled the movement of people and goods into, out of and between Palestinian-ruled areas. Sustaining and expanding settlements that dotted the West Bank and Gaza, they perpetuated what Palestinians lived and felt as a daily provocation.</p>
        <p>Many nonmilitant Palestinians gave up on the peace effort long ago; too many Israeli promises went broken, several said. Some intellectuals said they were beginning to think that the process would go on and on, as would the Palestinian struggle, because the key issues were beyond resolution. It did not seem possible that an Israeli government would grant refugees the right of return or recognize Palestinian sovereignty over East Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>By pushing Mr. Arafat to address these issues at Camp David, where he was offered less than he wanted, the Israelis and the Americans boxed him into a corner, Palestinian analysts said, and they did not fully understand that Mr. Arafat could not compromise on these issues -- the fundamental issues of his cause -- and that he would prefer to live in limbo.</p>
        <p>The Israelis and the Americans rushed Mr. Arafat into Camp David, although he protested that he was not ready, Palestinian analysts say. They also rushed him to cease-fire talks in Egypt last week, although again he made it clear that he was reluctant and their own analysts told them Mr. Arafat would be unwilling to quell the uprising before the Arab leaders' emergency meeting in Cairo later in the week.</p>
        <p>Palestinian officials say that the Israelis and Americans have not been listening to them, and that it is partly this failure that has led to the present state of despair and the desire to bring other interlocutors into the process.</p>
        <p>Mr. Arafat's growing frustration -- and his people's -- have been on full display for almost four weeks now. ''In my analysis, we are going through a reversal process of the last 10 years, back down and into the streets,'' said Ghassan Khattib, a Palestinian political analyst.</p>
        <p>It bears all the markings of an independence battle.</p>
        <p>''We are resisting against the Israeli occupation,'' Mr. Qurei said. ''There are no instructions up until now for the Palestinian police to use arms, but if it continues in the same way, I don't know where it will go, this struggle.''</p>
