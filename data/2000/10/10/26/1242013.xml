        <p>THE politicization of diseases is an old story by now. Public officials so routinely enlist in a fight against the most high-profile malady of the day that even those offended by such transparent tactics have come to accept them. After all, political attention raises awareness and money -- good things, whatever the motivation.</p>
        <p>It is also a good thing, though, for the public to focus occasionally on how the system works. Hence, we bring you the political subtext of the Breast and Cervical Cancer Prevention and Treatment Act, the one that President Clinton signed in private  this week -- without benefit of a public ceremony. A routine decision, said the White House press secretary, Jake Siewert, but one that happened to deny Representative Rick A. Lazio -- Hillary Rodham Clinton's opponent -- a little publicity.</p>
        <p>Petty. Mr. Lazio was indeed a sponsor of that new law, which provides at least $250 million in federal money over five years to treat working-poor women with breast or cervical cancer. You'd think the White House would give Mr. Lazio his due.</p>
        <p>But what is his due? Less central than he and his staff members contend, in the estimation of several advocates for the bill and members of Congress. Nor was Mrs. Clinton's role as instrumental as the White House asserts, they say: she was supportive and made some calls, but was hardly in the trenches.</p>
        <p>In fact, many lawmakers were involved, the bill's advocates say, and at various times they took the lead while Mr. Lazio, though the lead House sponsor, was not helpful or even reachable -- especially when the measure drew Republican opposition. Why? One theory: Mr. Lazio was contemplating running for a House leadership position and did not want to alienate influential Republican conservatives, who objected to the bill because it would expand Medicaid.</p>
        <p>As one leading lobbyist for the bill put it, ''There were people who really played leadership roles. Rick Lazio played a role at times. There were times he made a difference. There were other times that he did not return our phone calls. And times that we had to go around him.''</p>
        <p>One of the bill's supporters, Representative Anna G. Eshoo, a Democrat of Northern California, goes further. She accuses Mr. Lazio of losing interest in the bill when he was not a Senate candidate, then rediscovering it after Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani announced that he had prostate cancer and dropped out of the race -- opening the way for Mr. Lazio.</p>
        <p>Before that, she said, he refused to help her find balancing budget cuts to pay for the measure, would not take on two conservative Republican members of Congress who were blocking the bill, and introduced a new version of the measure that had no financing and replaced 300 sponsors (including Ms. Eshoo) with three -- Mr. Lazio and one congresswomen from each party who had survived breast cancer.'</p>
        <p>''This is not a pretty story about him,'' Ms. Eshoo said. ''He introduced a bill without a dime in it. He ditched women across the country.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio's advisers would not respond to specific charges. His chief of staff, Andy Ehrlich, said only that the congressman was ''thrilled this is the law of the land; political credit at this point doesn't matter.''</p>
        <p>Officials with the National Breast Cancer Coalition, which led the campaign for the bill along with the American Cancer Society, said there was indeed a financing problem and that Mr. Lazio was reluctant to push his fellow Republicans. Ultimately, the financing was restored, backers led by Ms. Eshoo lined up majority support in the House, and a bill passed there and in the Senate this month. Then Representative Sue Myrick, Republican of North Carolina, persuaded the House to pass the Senate version -- beating back a potentially fatal conservative amendment.</p>
        <p>Many legislators in both the House and Senate were closely involved, said Fran Visco, president of the National Breast Cancer Coalition. Bill-signing ceremonies are nice, but no big deal, she said. ''The story should not have been about that, but about the bill that is now law.''</p>
        <p>SINCE 1990 about 4,000 women have been diagnosed with breast or cervical cancer through federally financed screenings. Most could not afford treatment. The discrepancy came to the attention of Jan Eick-Swigert, an affluent woman from Long Beach, Calif., who has since died of breast cancer. She contacted the National Breast Cancer Coalition, which started reaching out to lawmakers.</p>
        <p>Now maybe some women will get help -- even without a photo op at the White House starring candidates with sharp elbows.</p>
