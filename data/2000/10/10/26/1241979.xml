        <p>A bond trader at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter who has accused the firm of sexual discrimination filed additional complaints with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission yesterday, accusing Morgan Stanley of firing her on Tuesday in retaliation for her complaints.</p>
        <p>Raymond O'Rourke, a spokesman for Morgan Stanley, confirmed that the trader, Allison K. Schieffelin, had been dismissed. ''She was terminated yesterday for insubordination and inappropriate behavior,'' Mr. O'Rourke said. He declined to comment further, citing continuing talks with the commission regarding Ms. Schieffelin's case. Ms. Schieffelin filed a complaint with the commission in November 1998, saying she had been denied promotion to managing director because of her sex.</p>
        <p>Gay Ebers-Franckowiak, a managing director at the firm and Ms. Schieffelin's supervisor, did not return calls seeking comment.</p>
        <p>In June, the commission issued a determination in Ms. Schieffelin's favor. Since then, Morgan Stanley has been trying to settle the matter and to avoid a class-action lawsuit in a process known as conciliation.</p>
        <p>Ms. Schieffelin's lawyer, Wayne N. Outten, said the conciliation process came to a halt at the end of September. Typically, once conciliation fails, the commission must decide whether to file a lawsuit. Nevertheless, Morgan Stanley is still talking with the commission to try to avoid such a suit, Mr. Outten said.</p>
        <p>''It's probably not a coincidence that a few weeks after conciliation failed, they fired her,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Elizabeth Grossman, a supervisory lawyer at the commission, declined to comment specifically on Ms. Schieffelin's case. But she said, ''Generally, the E.E.O.C. takes allegations of retaliation very seriously, especially retaliation for filing E.E.O.C. charges.''</p>
        <p>If the commission ultimately decides to pursue a lawsuit, Ms. Schieffelin will become a party to the suit, Mr. Outten said. If the agency decides not to pursue the case, she will probably file her own lawsuit, he said.</p>
        <p>In the supplemental complaint filed yesterday, Ms. Schieffelin's lawyers described a recent conversation between her and Ms. Ebers-Franckowiak. ''During that exchange, Ms. Schieffelin reminded Ms. Ebers that she herself had frequently complained to Ms. Schieffelin and others about gender discrimination by Morgan Stanley against herself and other women,'' the document noted. ''Ms. Ebers then angrily challenged Ms. Schieffelin, 'Why don't you just leave?' Ms. Schieffelin replied she intended to stay with her job and her career at Morgan Stanley.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Schieffelin, who declined to comment yesterday, has worked solely at Morgan Stanley since graduating from business school in 1986, her lawyer said. ''She loved her job and her clients and didn't want to give up her career,'' Mr. Outten said.</p>
