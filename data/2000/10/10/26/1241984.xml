        <p>This is a new 30-second commercial that the Lazio campaign began broadcasting statewide yesterday.</p>
        <p>PRODUCER -- The Murphy Pintak Gautier Hudome Agency</p>
        <p>ON THE SCREEN -- The commercial opens with Patricia Lazio, wife of Representative Rick A. Lazio, speaking off camera as a series of scenes appear: Mr. Lazio, sitting at a kitchen table covered with schoolwork, with his arm around daughter Molly; a close-up of both daughters, wearing Lazio hats, leaning out the window of their father's campaign bus; Mr. Lazio with a microphone in hand, talking to a small crowd; Mr. Lazio in a classroom, dressed casually as he sits and talks with schoolchildren. Amid the montage, Mrs. Lazio appears briefly, talking directly into the camera, before the commercial returns to images of Mr. Lazio campaigning.</p>
        <p>THE SCRIPT -- Mrs. Lazio: ''Rick Lazio is a pretty special guy. He's a father who loves his daughters and takes the time to be very involved in their lives. In Congress, he's worked to make our schools better and stood up for those who don't always have a powerful voice, like the disabled. I'm not asking you to vote for Rick because he's a good father and husband. I just want you to know that you can count on Rick to always do what's right for New York.''  Male announcer: ''Rick Lazio. From New York. For New York.''</p>
        <p>ACCURACY -- Mr. Lazio has supported legislation to change the way federal dollars are allocated, including a bipartisan bill signed into law by President Clinton last year that authorizes states to grant waivers to local school districts that want to spend federal dollars in ways that differ slightly from the specifically intended purpose. He was also the sponsor of a law that allows disabled people under certain circumstances to remain eligible for Medicaid while earning up to $45,000 a year, and sets aside $250 million to help the states joining the program to pay for it. (New York has not joined the program.) Democrats, however, say Mr. Lazio's support of education has been inconsistent, citing a 1995 vote on Congressional legislation that would have cut off financing to the Department of Education.</p>
        <p>SCORECARD -- Mrs. Lazio has begun making more frequent campaign appearances for her husband, who has stepped up the competition for women voters against his opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton. This is the second commercial in which Mrs. Lazio plays a prominent role; the first, released in July, promoted Mr. Lazio's record on health care. She and the Lazio children, however, have regularly appeared in his ads, including one this month that shows them all at the kitchen table with the children's homework. Although she says, ''I'm not asking you to vote for Rick because he's a good father and husband,'' the ad's imagery evokes that idea. The shots of a happy family around the kitchen table contrast with the Clintons' marriage troubles. Altogether, the commercial raises issues -- education and helping the disabled -- that political analysts contend play well with women and suburbanites who are deemed crucial to the outcome of the election.</p>
