        <p>Flocks of noisy Canada geese descended on the lake in front of the sprawling AT&amp;T corporate headquarters here today, roiling the water much the way C. Michael Armstrong, the chairman, was stirring the corporate waters.</p>
        <p>For Dolores Grady, a secretary for the last 36 years, the announcement that the telecommunications giant would once again try to remake itself, this time by splitting into four different companies, was just another sign of the company's ''unstable'' nature in the last decade or so. She confessed some nostalgia for relics like teletypes and telegraph, once the company's core business, and some despair at what would happen to ''this fabulous staff'' at the headquarters.</p>
        <p>''I can personally retire, and so I'm not in a bind,'' she said. ''A lot of us are just fed up with AT&amp;T being so unstable.''</p>
        <p>But for others, like Keith Black and Timothy Venkersammy, both  information technology specialists, the changes were welcome. The two work for Concert, a wholly owned subsidiary of AT&amp;T and British Telecommunications, which designs and markets broadband communications systems aimed at businesses.</p>
        <p>''This means that AT&amp;T is focused on the future business and revenue base and not on the past business,'' Mr. Black said as he and his co-worker left the Thirsty Turtle Restaurant in nearby Bernardsville after lunch. ''Consumer long distance was its old business and its cash cow. This announcement is a statement that the company's future is in broadband technology, wireless communication and information telephony.''</p>
        <p>The hardware of wires and switching equipment that so comforted Ms. Grady seemed ''anachronistic'' to Mr. Black, who joined the company 15 years ago and has known little but change since.</p>
        <p>''It was in a constant state of change when I got here,'' said Mr. Black, a British native who now lives in Atlanta and frequently travels to the headquarters here. ''We're used to change. We relish the change. It is the nature of our business.''</p>
        <p>Wrenching change has been a way of life at the company for at least 10 years, said Jeffrey Keefe, an associate professor in the school of management and labor relations at Rutgers University, in New Brunswick, who has studied the effects of the company's downsizing on its work force. Today's announcement represents the third major change at AT&amp;T since divestiture in 1984.</p>
        <p>''It makes life tenuous for many,'' he said. ''But there is a core group that continues because the company provides some of the best benefits, working conditions, pay and bonuses of any company. But the culture has changed as they moved from being a regulated monopoly to competing in the workplace, from shedding the Baby Bells and now competing with them and from merging two years ago with TCI. A lot are so used to these changes that they just want to end up working for a viable business and are not concerned about the larger machinations.''</p>
        <p>News of the breakup was communicated to employees here at the same time that it was announced at a noon press conference. In break rooms, cafeterias and auditoriums, there were video viewing stations where employees could hear the formal announcement. Worldwide, said Dennis Lawler, an AT&amp;T spokesman, there were nearly 400 viewing stations where employees could gather and watch.</p>
        <p>In addition, he said, Mr. Armstrong would be available to employees on a closed-circuit video-and-telephone link on Thursday to answer questions and give them details on what they may face in the future. There would also be 4,000 telephone ports that will allow employees to call in any questions they have for him.</p>
        <p>As the press conference unfolded, many at headquarters described the reactions as ''calm,'' ''business as usual,'' and ''reflective.'' One woman walking about the wooded, campus-like setting said the announcement had given her closure in the midst of months of speculation. Insisting on anonymity, she said the branching of company functions seemed self-explanatory and gave many a clear idea of where their background and talents could take them in the future.</p>
        <p>She recalled the announcement two years ago by Mr. Armstrong, newly appointed as chairman, that cost cuts would lead to 14,000 to 18,000 layoffs. ''Now that was ominous,'' she said, noting that there were generous severance packages and a roaring economy that could absorb most of those who left. ''But this is restructuring.''</p>
        <p>Susan J. Friedman, a clinical social worker and consultant to the company, was just ending a morning-long seminar on juggling work and family when the announcement was made. ''It was fascinating to watch,'' said Ms. Friedman, who had been working with 20 people in person and 20 more by teleconference in Florida, as she lingered a bit to watch the news settle in. ''It was quiet, very reflective,'' she said. ''Some were frightened but not terrified. They just didn't know how it would play out.''</p>
        <p>Back at the Thirsty Turtle, Mr. Black and Mr. Venkersammy said that in many ways their jobs with Concert, with its high-tech focus and marketing to businesses in competition with other communications companies, were very similar to what the future would look like for many AT&amp;T employees. They flashed plastic wallet inserts that on one side carried Concert identification cards and, on the other, AT&amp;T employee cards.</p>
        <p>Already, in anticipation of the breakup, they both said, co-workers at the mother company had called them to ask what it was like to have one foot in the company's future and one foot in its past. ''I tell them it is exciting,'' Mr. Black said. ''Very exciting and very global.'' Still, Ms. Grady seemed unconvinced as she reviewed Mr. Armstrong's presentation. ''Hogwash,'' she called it, and then angrily labeled it ''mumbo jumbo,'' which still left the future as murky as the goose-stirred lake out front. ''Some of us who are low on the totem pole,'' she said, ''still don't know where we stand.''</p>
