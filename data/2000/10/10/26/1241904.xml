        <p>UNDER ''hubris,'' the dictionary ought to say, ''See Eliot Ness,'' Al Capone's archenemy, immortalized on television and on film in ''The Untouchables.'' But to appreciate the full weight of his pride-punished-by-the-gods tragedy, the place to look is not Chicago, but Cleveland. That is where Ness, the highly (some said over- and self-) glorified gangbuster, moved after the Capone years and where his career began a long slide.</p>
        <p>The paradox is that Ness, who may have gotten credit he did not deserve in Chicago, endured the opposite in Ohio. Hired in 1935 as director of public safety when Cleveland was a wide-open city, he hit town like an avenging angel, cleaning up a corrupt police force and cracking down on gambling and extortion, youth gangs and brothels.</p>

        <p>UNDER ''hubris,'' the dictionary ought to say, ''See Eliot Ness,'' Al Capone's archenemy, immortalized on television and on film in ''The Untouchables.'' But to appreciate the full weight of his pride-punished-by-the-gods tragedy, the place to look is not Chicago, but Cleveland. That is where Ness, the highly (some said over- and self-) glorified gangbuster, moved after the Capone years and where his career began a long slide.</p>
        <p>The paradox is that Ness, who may have gotten credit he did not deserve in Chicago, endured the opposite in Ohio. Hired in 1935 as director of public safety when Cleveland was a wide-open city, he hit town like an avenging angel, cleaning up a corrupt police force and cracking down on gambling and extortion, youth gangs and brothels.</p>
        <p>Ness is often remembered for getting Al Capone, even though he didn't. In Cleveland, his genuine municipal accomplishments were overshadowed by his seeming failure to catch a horrific serial killer known as the torso murderer. But Ness may have gotten his man after all.</p>
        <p>For a quick overview, there is a summary of Ness's life by Paul W. Heimel, author of ''Eliot Ness: The Real Story'' (Knox Books, 1997), at www.geocities.com/halbrown /eliot</p>
