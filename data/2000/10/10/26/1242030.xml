        <p>The networking giant Cisco Systems, Silicon Valley's biggest employer, received final government approval for a planned $1.3 billion corporate office complex to be built in a rural area south of San Jose, Calif. The expansion project, which calls for a 688-acre office park for 20,000 Cisco employees, was unanimously approved by the City Council, with one member abstaining because of a conflict of interest. The project was approved several weeks ago by the city planning commission. Cisco's proposal has been at the center of controversy in recent months because it will encroach on one of Silicon Valley's last rural tracts, known as Coyote Valley. To appease opponents of the plan, Cisco announced recently that it would donate $3 million and help raise $97 million more for land preservation efforts. But it remains unclear whether those steps will be enough to placate environmental opponents.</p>
