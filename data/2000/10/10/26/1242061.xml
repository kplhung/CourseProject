        <p>President Clinton helped his Senate candidate wife celebrate her 53rd birthday last night, giving her the best possible gift so soon before the election.

        <p>President Clinton helped his Senate candidate wife celebrate her 53rd birthday last night, giving her the best possible gift so soon before the election. Rather than presenting her with roses or jewelry, he was the host of a star-studded Manhattan fund-raiser and dinner that funneled $2 million into Hillary Rodham Clinton's New York Senate bid.</p>
        <p>Cher took the stage to serenade the first lady. Ben Affleck, Cameron Diaz and Chevy Chase performed humorous skits. There were more than 1,000 guests in all at the Roseland Ballroom, the actors Tom Cruise and Robert De Niro included, and many of them had written birthday checks to help fill Mrs. Clinton's campaign coffers.</p>
        <p>''She has the requisite aggression to be a good New Yorker,'' the president said, describing how she came over to him to introduce herself after he had been staring at her at Yale Law School.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's birthday is actually today, but with the election less than two weeks away, campaigning will take precedence over celebrating. In the morning, Mrs. Clinton will shake hands at Grand Central Terminal. Later, she will fly to Albany for a newspaper editorial board meeting. Then she will prepare for her next debate with Representative Rick A. Lazio, her Republican opponent.</p>
        <p>A Lazio impersonator took the stage repeatedly last night, poking fun at the real-life candidate's behavior at the first debate, when he strode across the stage to insist that Mrs. Clinton sign a campaign finance pledge. The Lazio stand-in demanded last night that she sign his yearbook, his guest book and his cast. Each time, he was hauled away by Secret Service agents.</p>
        <p>The Republican presidential candidate, Gov. George W. Bush, also appeared by proxy. ''When it comes to wishing people happy birthday, I've crossed party lines and got it done,'' the impersonator said, mimicking the cadences of the Texas governor and repeatedly mangling Mrs. Clinton's first name. ''I wish you a happy birthday, or as they say in Spanish, feliz Navidad.'' The Broadway actor Nathan Lane acted as moderator, gently poking fun at the birthday girl.</p>
        <p>''Her policy on her age is, don't ask, don't tell,'' he said, adding, ''It was many years ago that Hillary was born in New York's outer borough -- Illinois.'' After the show, the Clintons joined the performers and others at the Hudson Hotel, where it cost  $10,000 to get in.</p>
        <p>It was a long -- and successful -- day of fund-raising for the president.</p>
        <p>He helped raise $300,000 for the re-election bid of Representative Gregory W. Meeks, all the more notable because the New York City Democrat faces no opposition. Then Mr. Clinton was the host at a reception that raised $1 million for Democratic  candidates for the State Assembly.</p>
        <p>In all, Mr. Clinton's fund-raising tally for the year has topped $100 million. He has made dozens of appearances in New York and throughout the country on behalf of his wife.</p>
