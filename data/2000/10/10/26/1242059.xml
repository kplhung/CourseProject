        <p>There was a homecoming party of sorts at the offices of the Coalition for the Homeless on Chambers Street last night.</p>
        <p>Hugs, backslaps and addresses were exchanged in the big room that was usually reserved for much drearier business. There were brownies. There were cookies. There was coffee. But best of all, there was money.</p>
        <p>Dozens of men and women who were homeless in the 1990's had come to pick up their shares of an $816,000 settlement in a lawsuit against two Midtown business improvement districts. The groups, the Grand Central Partnership and the 34th Street Partnership, had employed homeless people in the 90's and paid them $1 an hour, a wage that a judge ruled was illegally low.</p>
        <p>Fitzroy Frederick, a 43-year-old with long dreadlocks, carried a reminder of those days with him.</p>
        <p>''I still got my W-2 form from 1994,'' Mr. Frederick said, ''and when I get my check, I'm going to burn it.''</p>
        <p>One by one, the former workers were called into a cubicle where they signed a release form in the presence of a notary public. Then they stepped into a hallway where a secretary handed them a check.</p>
        <p>Mr. Frederick, who showed off a bent, folded and spindled W-2 with $34 on the wage line, came back with a check for more than $4,200. Now he had a new challenge: how to keep the windfall from disqualifying him from Supplemental Security Income.</p>
        <p>A Legal Aid lawyer, Amanda Moretti, explained that he could spend the money, put up to $2,000 in a savings account or set up a trust fund for his personal needs and turn it over to someone else.</p>
        <p>The plaintiffs -- 198 people, who received checks for back wages and damages averaging more than $4,000 -- cleaned shelters or did outreach work getting other homeless people off the street under a program run by the two business groups. The groups claimed that they were entitled to pay the low wages because the homeless people were trainees, not employees.</p>
        <p>But the judge ruled that the training was minimal and the responsibilities of the homeless people were often identical to those of full-time workers.</p>
        <p>One former outreach worker, Galen Shavuo, 62, flew in from San Diego to pick up his check. Mr. Shavuo, who said he was homeless for 4 years, 6 months and 21 days, now runs a gift-basket store in California and plans to use the money to open a similar business here.</p>
        <p>''You know what's funny?'' Mr. Shavuo said. ''All these people you're seeing here? Ever since they got away from Grand Central Partnership, they're doing a lot better.'' The program, he said, ''was trying to help us, but they were holding us back from being what we wanted to be.''</p>
        <p>Many of the former dollar-an-hour workers have indeed turned their lives around, though others are still struggling.</p>
        <p>One former homeless worker, Michael A. Lucas, was one of several alumni who worked as a drug counselor. Mr. Lucas, who spent years on the street, said he planned to invest most of the money and ''give a nice healthy piece of it to my mother.''</p>
        <p>When asked if he thought some of the plaintiffs might spend the money on drugs, he paused and searched for a diplomatic response.</p>
        <p>''Well,'' he said, ''Given the ratio in general of people that do smart things and people who do wise things, there is a percentage of people who will probably spend their money unwisely.''</p>
