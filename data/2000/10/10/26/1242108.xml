        <p>The national anthem is a ritual that has been part of the sports landscape for decades. The color guard comes out, and someone usually sings as a prelude to the game.</p>
        <p>Last night at Shea Stadium, ''The Star-Spangled Banner'' took on added significance when five sailors from the destroyer Cole accompanied the color guard for the national anthem before Game 4.</p>
        <p>The sailors were on the Cole in Yemen on Oct. 12 when a bomb ripped a hole in the hull. Seventeen sailors were killed and 39 were wounded. The sailors at Shea last night had injuries that included a broken jaw and a broken wrist.</p>
        <p>They were introduced individually, and the crowd responded with a standing ovation and a brief chant of ''U-S-A! U-S-A!'' The sailors had seats behind home plate.</p>
        <p>The startling transformation from Yemen to Flushing, Queens, was a bit much to grasp. ''Two weeks ago we were in the Persian Gulf, now we're here in New York going to the World Series,'' Petty Officer Second Class Robert D. McTureous said. ''I'm just glad to be home, but our shipmates are still out there, so I'm still thinking about them.''</p>
        <p>The sailors, guests of Major League Baseball, arrived in New York yesterday afternoon. Petty Officer Second Class Bobby D. Asher said he appreciated the Cole and its crew being remembered at Yankee Stadium before Games 1 and 2 as well as last night's invitation to Shea.</p>
        <p>''It kept what happened in everybody's mind, and that's good,'' Asher said. ''It's hard to imagine that one time you're hanging out laughing with your friend and a minute later, he's no longer there, or you're carrying him out. That's hard for people to understand.''</p>
