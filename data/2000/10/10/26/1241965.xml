      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The intense national seminar about Roger Clemens and the broken bat he threw toward Mike Piazza during Game 2 of the World Series may seem an overblown fascination with what is in the end only a game. But there is good reason to pay attention to such a primordial conflict between two athletes. It seems we have acknowledged in this episode that males can be physically dangerous and that tight regulations are necessary to limit their behavior.</p>
        <p>The attraction of sports is that contests are contained by the rules of the game. Overt and often bitter conflict is essential, but so is a willing commitment to a higher social order represented by crisp obedience to the rules and the referees who enforce them. When people throw hard round objects at each other at nearly a hundred miles an hour or violently batter these objects with thick sticks, it is simply too dangerous for anyone to stray beyond a narrow range of acceptable and predictable behavior.</p>

        <p>The intense national seminar about Roger Clemens and the broken bat he threw toward Mike Piazza during Game 2 of the World Series may seem an overblown fascination with what is in the end only a game. But there is good reason to pay attention to such a primordial conflict between two athletes. It seems we have acknowledged in this episode that males can be physically dangerous and that tight regulations are necessary to limit their behavior.</p>
        <p>The attraction of sports is that contests are contained by the rules of the game. Overt and often bitter conflict is essential, but so is a willing commitment to a higher social order represented by crisp obedience to the rules and the referees who enforce them. When people throw hard round objects at each other at nearly a hundred miles an hour or violently batter these objects with thick sticks, it is simply too dangerous for anyone to stray beyond a narrow range of acceptable and predictable behavior.</p>
        <p>But ballplayers are supposed to withhold all displays of personal turbulence and operatic emotionality while they do their work. Beyond athletic skill, playing effectively demands a rich portfolio of emotions ranging from triumph to patience to stoicism, cunning and despair. Under the microscopic inspection of television cameras and with countless people looking on, the athlete has to hide all these.</p>
        <p>Especially in baseball, a poker face is part of the uniform. While everyone knows or can imagine the inner experience endured by a player under pressure, an aspect of a player's excellence is how well he keeps it to himself. Like it or not, even in this age of the talk show, it remains a mark of male competence and even honor to get on with the game. ''Play ball, never let go, stand tall, keep a grip'' -- these are elements of the psychological catechism a successful athlete must learn.</p>
        <p>Throwing splintered bats at opponents isn't part of this. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani suggested that Clemens's toss was just an ''instinctual reaction.'' That is precisely the problem. The last thing large and strong athletes can afford to do in the emotion of tense struggle is react with unfiltered ferocity. It is not only far too dangerous for them personally but an affront to the wider community that understands the mandatory nature of the rule book.</p>
        <p>The reason so many people -- men especially -- watch sports is precisely because sports are at once turbulently passionate and coolly formal. They take place in real time. Catch the ball or not, hit it or not, steal the base or not -- there can be no psychobabble excuses, no whiny moralizing. The rules are the same for everyone. They make the game safe and emotionally bearable. They work. Roger Clemens should be ashamed of himself for not following them.</p>
