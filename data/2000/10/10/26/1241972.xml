        <p>A panel of federal judges decided today to consolidate in Indianapolis the pretrial proceedings in all but one of the 64 federal lawsuits against Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. and the Ford Motor Company involving the failure of Firestone tires on Ford Explorer sport utility vehicles.</p>
        <p>The panel's decision is a victory for Firestone and Ford, which had feared that their executives and lawyers would have to give depositions in states across the nation. Lawyers who have filed the personal injury and class-action lawsuits had sought separate pretrial proceedings on the chance that discrepancies in depositions in one case could be used against the companies in others. After the pretrial proceedings, cases are likely to be sent back to the original courts for trial.</p>

        <p>A panel of federal judges decided today to consolidate in Indianapolis the pretrial proceedings in all but one of the 64 federal lawsuits against Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. and the Ford Motor Company involving the failure of Firestone tires on Ford Explorer sport utility vehicles.</p>
        <p>The panel's decision is a victory for Firestone and Ford, which had feared that their executives and lawyers would have to give depositions in states across the nation. Lawyers who have filed the personal injury and class-action lawsuits had sought separate pretrial proceedings on the chance that discrepancies in depositions in one case could be used against the companies in others. After the pretrial proceedings, cases are likely to be sent back to the original courts for trial.</p>
        <p>Firestone and Ford had asked that the cases be consolidated in Chicago. The plaintiffs' lawyers had opposed consolidation but contended that if necessary, it should be done in the South, where most cases had been filed. The panel chose Chief Judge Sarah Evans Barker of the Southern District of Indiana, whose courtroom is in Indianapolis, citing her ability to handle complex litigation.</p>
        <p>The lawsuits being consolidated have been filed in 27 different federal districts. The only federal lawsuit not included in the consolidation involves a different kind of tire than the rest. Dozens of state lawsuits, involving numerous deaths and injuries, are not included in the consolidation.</p>
        <p>In a separate development, Safetyforum.com, a research group that works with lawyers, said that regulators had received many complaints about Firestone tire models not covered by the company's recall on Aug. 9. Firestone's recall covers 14.4 million of the 47 million tires under investigation by regulators. Firestone and Ford have replaced more than half of 6.5 million recalled tires still in use.</p>
        <p>Firestone has said repeatedly that all of the tires that have not been recalled have failure rates that are no higher than those of other tires on the road. But C. Tab Turner, a lawyer in Little Rock, Ark., who handles tire cases and works with Safetyforum, said that the research group's analysis showed a need for a broader recall.</p>
