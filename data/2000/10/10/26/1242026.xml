        <p>A relative calm prevailed on the streets of the West Bank and Gaza Strip for the third day today, as both sides seemed to be taking a deep breath and considering their options.</p>
        <p>Prime Minister Ehud Barak's chief of staff, Gilead Sher, said tensions seemed to be easing. There were no major demonstrations or confrontations at Israeli roadblocks and only a few minor clashes under gray, storm-lashed skies.</p>
        <p>President Clinton called Mr. Barak and the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, on Tuesday, in an effort to quell the violence of the last three weeks that has killed more than 130 people -- nearly all of them Arabs.  ''If it continues to be calm, and by the way, since last night there's a feeling things have calmed down on the Palestinian side,'' Mr. Sher told Israel radio, ''we will do our part and withdraw our forces according to the Sharm understandings.'' He was referring to Israeli troops positioned along the outskirts of the Palestinian areas, where they have been the targets of protests, and to the truce framework brokered in Egypt at Sharm el Sheik.</p>
        <p>While the stone-throwing slackened, a different kind of warfare seemed to break out in a totally different sphere, the Internet.</p>
        <p>The Foreign Ministry's Web site crashed today under a coordinated assault by thousands of pro-Palestinian computer users who called it up simultaneously. In Beirut last week, Hezbollah, the Shiite Muslim militia group, said that its Web site had gone down under a similar attack by Israeli hackers. Hezbollah said it was designing countermeasures.</p>
        <p>A Foreign Ministry spokesman, Uri Noy, said the attack was traced to what he called a ''a pro-Palestinian and pro-Shiite Muslim'' Web site in the United States that had urged users to flood the Israeli site.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday night, Mr. Barak quietly dispatched one of his top security aides, Yossi Ginosaur, to Gaza to meet with Muhammad Dahlan, the Palestinian chief of security there.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dahlan is a central figure in the cooperation efforts between Palestinian and Israeli security officials which is being overseen by an American -- George J. Tenet, the director of central intelligence. At the Camp David summit meeting last July, Mr. Dahlan was said to have been among the most amenable of the Palestinian negotiators to compromise, and he reportedly established a rapport with his counterpart Shlomo Ben-Ami, the Israeli foreign minister.</p>
        <p>Negotiations throughout the day today produced a meeting between ranking Israeli and Palestinian military commanders. The head of the Israeli Army's Southern Command, Maj. Gen. Yom-Tov Samia, sat down in Gaza with a Palestinian, Maj. Gen. Abdel-Razek al-Majayden, for talks the Israelis said were aimed at ''lowering significantly the level of friction and violence in the field.''</p>
        <p>Efforts were under way to set up a similar meeting between Maj. Gen. Yutzhak Eitan, head of the Israeli Central Command, which operates on the West Bank, and his Palestinian counterpart.</p>
        <p>The army's chief of operations, Maj. Gen. Giora Eilaud, said, ''There is a U.S. effort to calm the situation,  and this has brought about the willingness by the Palestinians to attend a meeting with us.''</p>
        <p>But General Eilaud and other Israeli commanders are worried that the conflict with the Palestinians could shift from street rioting to a nagging low-level guerrilla war with the kind of shooting incidents that have become nightly occurrences, particularly in Hebron. There have been 600 such incidents, General Eilaud told reporters at a briefing today, most of them involving small groups of Palestinians sneaking up on Israeli positions at night and opening fire.</p>
        <p>''The number of these incidents had been from 25 to 30 a day,'' he said, adding that ''the number is diminishing. In the past 24 hours there have been only a few shooting incidents. On the other hand, some of these incidents were more severe.''</p>
        <p>Today in the Gaza Strip, for example, a roadside bomb went off near an Israeli Army convoy, and Palestinian gunmen then opened fire.  There were no casualties.</p>
        <p>There was no gunfire last night between the Palestinian town of Beit Jela and the neighboring settlement of Gilo. There was some shooting reported, however, from the West Bank town of El-Bireh toward a nearby settlement. The American Consulate here issued a stern warning today urging citizens to ''defer all travel to Israel, the West Bank and Gaza.''</p>
