        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>It is disheartening that corporate America, the real hero in the current expansion, is being bashed by a study that ignores the tax burden on American corporations and mischaracterizes legitimate tax provisions as tax avoidance schemes (Business Day, Oct. 20).</p>
        <p>Internal Revenue Service data show that on average, corporations pay almost 30 percent of their profits in federal income taxes, a figure that signals a high rate of compliance, not widespread tax evasion. A deeper concern is the attack on the pro-growth tax policy that has contributed to our strong economy.</p>
        <p>Corporations provide well-paying jobs, investment opportunities and services for all Americans. Instead of legitimizing the class warfare rhetoric of the current campaign by bashing corporations for alleged tax avoidance, let's focus our efforts on reducing taxes for both corporations and their employees.</p>
        <p>MICHAEL E. BAROODY  Senior Vice President  Natl. Assn. of Manufacturers  Washington, Oct. 24, 2000</p>
