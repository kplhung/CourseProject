        <p>Three workers' advocacy groups announced yesterday that Street Beat Sportswear, a women's clothing manufacturer, agreed this week to pay them $85,000 in legal fees and damages. That settlement came after a judge ruled that the company had filed an improper, retaliatory lawsuit against the three organizations.</p>
        <p>Under the settlement, Street Beat will pay $85,000 to three New York-based groups: the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund, the Chinese Staff and Workers' Association and the National Mobilization Against Sweatshops.</p>
        <p>Last year, Justice Sheila Abdus-Salaam of New York State Supreme Court found that Street Beat broke a new law against frivolous and retaliatory lawsuits when it filed a lawsuit demanding $75 million in damages from the three advocacy groups. Street Beat filed that lawsuit after the Asian-American legal fund brought a lawsuit on behalf of 15 Chinese immigrant garment workers, charging the company with large-scale violations of minimum wage and overtime laws. In June 1999, Street Beat settled that suit by agreeing to pay $285,000.</p>
