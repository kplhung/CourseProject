        <p>NOT all wall beds answer to the name Murphy. Today, there are many manufacturers who make fold-up or mobile beds, with platforms or European-style wood-slat bases. Most are  custom-made to fit into idiosyncratic spaces and satisfy diverse lifestyle (and style) needs.</p>
        <p>1.  The TableBed, from Inova, with a twin-, full- or queen-size bed, is a free-standing unit that can be moved or even used as a room divider with a bookcase behind. The frame extends 14 1/2 inches from the wall, less than other wall bed units. The table can be ordered as a desk. In wood veneers or finishes, from $6,000 to $7,000; (212) 932-1446.</p>

The frame extends 14 1/2 inches from the wall, less than other wall bed units. The table can be ordered as a desk. In wood veneers or finishes, from $6,000 to $7,000; (212) 932-1446.</p>
        <p>2.  The Poliform Senzafine closet system can include bifold closet doors that hide a twin- or full-size Murphy bed (the company uses the Murphy brand hardware). The basic closet shown includes a twin-size bed with a spring mattress and white lacquer doors. It costs $8,500 at Poliform, 150 East 58th Street or through the Internet at www.poliformusa.com.</p>
        <p>3.  A home-office with a Murphy bed was designed by Insight Design of SoHo. The system shown costs $7,800 and includes a full-size bed in maple ($6,800 in laminate and $6,000 in unpainted wood). The desk unit is $4,000. There is an additional design fee based on an hourly rate; (212) 366-6413 for information.</p>
        <p>4.  Wall beds by Techline fold into an 18-inch-deep cabinet in a floor-to-ceiling wall system of bookshelves, closets, armoires and display cabinets made of cherry or maple veneer. When closed, the bed looks like a two-door closet. A queen-size wood unit costs $2,781 ($354 extra for the mattress); $2,180 in Formica; also with twin- or full-size bed. The system pictured with the desk costs $16,700. At Techline, 35 East 19th Street; (800) 356-8400 or through www.techline-ny.com.</p>
        <p>PAGE 1.  The Alpha wall system by Interlubke, on the first page of this section, includes a cube-shaped bed module. The twin-bed unit with a foam mattress and a wood-slat base is $3,300 in beech or white lacquer (for the bed module only). The shelves, drawers and closets can be built around the bed and easily dismantled. Interlubke's systems are at M2L, 979 Third Avenue (58th Street).</p>
