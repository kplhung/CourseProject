        <p>Here it is always called the ''War to Resist America and Aid Korea.'' Today China is celebrating the 50th anniversary of its entry into that conflict -- the day its ''volunteers'' poured across the Yalu River to surprise the American-led United Nations forces in North Korea and went on to battle them for three miserable years toward an uneasy truce.</p>
        <p>China's authorities always see history as an ideological weapon, so it comes as no surprise that the approved story of that war is scrubbed into a parable of national heroism and purposeful achievement.</p>
        <p>And this week, although it has applauded the easing of tensions on the Korean peninsula, the government is shaping that conflict of half a century ago to serve its current needs.</p>
        <p>In official accounts -- repeated in a crescendo of articles and programs, a new official three-volume history and a speech by President Jiang Zemin this morning -- the fledgling People's Republic defended itself against a menacing foreign force, achieving a victory that put China on the world map.</p>
        <p>The war in Korea ''was a great victory of the world's peace-loving people,'' Mr. Jiang told fellow leaders, military veterans and others in a celebration in the Great Hall of the People, ''and a grand monument erected by the Chinese people in maintaining world peace and human progress.''</p>
        <p>The war drew more than two million Chinese into a costly battle little more than a year after the Communists had finally won China's civil war, having conquered all but the forces of Chiang Kai-shek that had fled to Taiwan. By Western estimates some 700,000 to 900,000 Chinese were killed or wounded before the Korean conflict ended in an armistice in 1953.</p>
        <p>But recent efforts by a few maverick historians here to ask whether Stalin maneuvered China into intervening in the war, or to ask the true price of a conflict that solidified American military support for Taiwan, have elicited vitriolic condemnation.</p>
        <p>A plaque listing the number of Korean War ''martyrs'' by provincial origin, in a commemorative exhibit at Beijing's Military Museum, lists total Chinese war deaths at 171,669 -- a significant toll, if well under Western estimates. But it is the glorious victory of the weak over the strong that gets the most emphasis in official accounts.</p>
        <p>Today, with Chinese military planners openly discussing a new American threat to China's interests in Asia and with the Communist Party losing its appeal, the message is intended to shore up national morale.</p>
        <p>The victory in Korea, said today's People's Daily in a front-page editorial, ''tells us that the Chinese Communist Party is the faithful representative of the fundamental interests of the Chinese nation.''</p>
        <p>Liberation Army Daily, alluding to China's acute sense of past humiliations at the hands of foreigners, wrote: ''The War to Resist America and Aid Korea was a settling of accounts with the Opium War of over a century beforehand.'' It was, the article added, ''the first display of China's abilities as a great power.''</p>
        <p>Based on the Korean War, in which Chinese and North Korean troops overcame technologically superior weaponry, ''we have every reason to conclude that the weak can beat the strong,'' said China Defense News, acknowledging China's continued paucity of high-tech arms as it contemplates the possibility of facing down the United States over Taiwan.</p>
        <p>The official themes seemed to resonate with the crowds admiring the old weapons and war trophies in the Military Museum's 50th anniversary exhibit. A small crowd gathered around Liang Xiucheng and Chiu Mingfa, who served as nurses in Korea and went to the exhibit wearing several war medals each and recounting stories of their service.</p>
        <p>Ms. Liang, 66, said she had joined the army at age 17, and she seemed to have no regrets. ''At that time the American forces were on the Yalu River, and there was no choice but to fight back,'' she said.</p>
        <p>''China had been bullied so long by other countries, including yours,'' she said to a nearby American with a laugh. ''But nobody can bully China anymore!''</p>
        <p>''Why did you come so far to fight anyway?'' she asked. ''This was right on our doorstep!''</p>
        <p>The exhibit about the war to ''Protect Our Families and Defend Our Country,'' as large banners put it, does not reflect on the price of the conflict, or any of the questions a few venturesome historians have been raising here. Some have said China may have made a mistake by intervening in the war -- that the United States would never have invaded China and that the fighting diverted too many resources from the task of rebuilding the nation and the priority of conquering Taiwan.</p>
        <p>Other historians, using recently available Soviet and Chinese documents, argue that China's entry was engineered by Stalin, as the Soviet leader gave the North Koreans the go-ahead to attack the South without fully consulting Mao.</p>
        <p>In response to the North Korean attack, the United States sent the Seventh Fleet into the Taiwan Strait, foiling Mao's hopes of invading Taiwan and creating a lasting standoff.</p>
        <p>''As New China had just been established and was preparing for a battle to liberate Taiwan, Mao Zedong still hoped that at this time a war would not break out in Korea,'' wrote one of the leading revisionists, Shen Zhihua, a private scholar who has studied the Soviet archives. ''However, as the leader of the Asian revolution, Mao was unable to refuse Kim Il Sung's demand, especially as Stalin had already expressed his position, and so China could only accept this.''</p>
        <p>Though such assertions do not cast China in a malicious light or question its forces' achievements, they do show Mao as less than all-knowing and all-powerful and have drawn scathing responses.</p>
        <p>Liberation Army Daily, in a recent commentary, described the revisionists as ''flies,'' saying they ''fly back and forth,'' leaving droppings, ''spreading bacteria and blackening the faces of the heroes to toady to their foe.''</p>
