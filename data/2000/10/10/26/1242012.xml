        <p>A Japanese consumer group said today that bioengineered corn not approved for human consumption had made its way from the United States into cornmeal manufactured here.</p>
        <p>The corn, called StarLink, had been detected in several corn products in the United States. But today's report was the first indication that it had spread overseas.</p>
        <p>Any concern about contamination of corn shipments here could have serious implications for American corn farmers, for whom Japan is the largest overseas market, taking 30 percent of their exports and about 6 percent of the overall crop.</p>
        <p>''The problem originates in the United States,'' said Makiko Irisawa of the No G.M.O. Campaign, the 6,000-member group that had the cornmeal tested. The group opposes genetically modified foods.</p>
        <p>The group's assertions, which the government and the manufacturer neither disputed nor affirmed, had officials scrambling to determine how the corn might have arrived in Japan. StarLink is not approved in Japan -- not even in animal feed, a use authorized in the United States.</p>
        <p>[The developer of the corn, Aventis CropScience, a subsidiary of Aventis S.A., asked the Environmental Protection Agency in Washington today to modify its ban on human consumption of StarLink for four years, saying there was ''reasonable certainty of no harm.'' The petition was made as tests showed the corn in another brand of American taco shells.]</p>
        <p>After a hastily convened meeting this morning, officials of the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare said the National Institute of Health Sciences would conduct its own tests on the product, called Homemade Baking, which is used to make scones and other baked goods.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, the ministry said it had asked the manufacturer, Kyoritsu Shokuhin, to recall the cornmeal, and to determine the source of any StarLink corn in its product. It also asked the United States Embassy to look into the report and provide assurances that there would be no other such incidents.</p>
        <p>A scientist from the United States Department of Agriculture was traveling to Tokyo this evening in an effort to address the Japanese concerns. Grain importers said representatives of the North American Grain Export Association and the United States Grains Council were also on their way.</p>
        <p>This is the second time the United States government has dispatched officials to Japan because of the grain, an embassy spokesman said. He said a team from the Agriculture Department came to Japan last spring after the same consumer group released test results showing traces of StarLink in chicken feed.</p>
        <p>The tests on the cornmeal were conducted by Genetic ID Japan, an affiliate of the Iowa-based research lab that found StarLink in store-bought taco shells in the United States last month. Those tests were conducted on behalf of groups opposed to genetically modified foods.</p>
        <p>In the 1998-99 fiscal year, Japan imported 15.4 million tons of American corn, accounting for $1.5 billion of the $5 billion in total corn exports from the United States.</p>
        <p>Japan allows some varieties of genetically modified corn to be imported, although some foods made with such corn will have to be labeled starting April 1. But corn shipments could be rejected if they contain even a speck of StarLink.</p>
        <p>In an interview about the findings on the cornmeal, Mrs. Irisawa of the No G.M.O. Campaign said: ''We've been conducting these tests for some time because we are skeptical about the Japanese distribution system for food staples. We are also skeptical that the United States distribution system can detect whether foods are genetically modified or not.''</p>
        <p>In the episode last spring involving chicken feed, which got little attention, the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries said the consumer group's test involved too small a sample and was statistically flawed, but it did not move to conduct its own tests of the feed immediately.</p>
        <p>Rather, it is including that feed among other varieties that it is testing one by one under a policy that started this year, said Yutaka Kunugi, an official in the feed distribution section of the Agriculture and Fisheries Ministry. Those tests are still under way, he said.</p>
        <p>The discovery of StarLink last month in taco shells manufactured by Kraft Foods using cornmeal supplied by a Texas mill touched off product recalls and other precautionary steps in the United States. With the reported discovery of StarLink in Japan, the controversy is fast becoming an international one.</p>
        <p>Two days ago, John Richardson, the deputy chief of mission for the European Union in Washington, said discussions with American officials had failed to persuade the Europeans that StarLink had not found its way to their grocery shelves. Unlike Japan, however, Europe is not a significant importer of American corn.</p>
        <p>The StarLink corn is engineered to insert a gene that produces a protein lethal to the corn borer, a common pest. Because it could not rule out the possibility that it could cause human allergies, the Environmental Protection Agency approved StarLink only for animal feed.</p>
        <p>After the corn was detected in food products last month, Aventis and the government moved to buy up the entire StarLink crop and ensure that it was not commingled with other corn. But food and grain industry officials said this month that the corn had been shipped to hundreds of grain elevators and that they were unsure how much had been properly identified and segregated.</p>
        <p>''Though StarLink corn was only approved for use as animal feed or for industrial processes, some Starlink corn appears to have entered the food supply and might find its way into products overseas,'' the embassy spokesman here said. ''I want to emphasize that even though the E.P.A. did not approve for StarLink for use in food, the E.P.A. has no evidence that food containing this corn poses any threat to public health. Our scientist believe the risks, if any, are extremely low.''</p>
        <p>The problem is difficult to contain, experts say. ''The type of handling in which we would separate the corn at every stage of transportation, shipment and import into Japan is very expensive,'' said Makoto Hyodo, who oversees grain and oil imports at the Tomen Corporation, which imports about two million tons of corn a year.</p>
        <p>In addition to animal feed, the Japanese use corn in most of the same ways as Americans: in cooking oil, muffins, snack foods and the like.</p>
