        <p>IT turned out that Joe Torre had even less faith in Denny Neagle with a lead last night than Bobby Cox did four years ago. Mike Piazza had hit one tape-measure foul ball against Neagle in the first inning. He had belted a two-run homer into the Shea Stadium picnic area in the third. By the fifth inning, with Neagle one out from being the pitcher of record on the winning side, Torre would not allow Piazza to feast his eyes on Neagle again.</p>
        <p>Out went a stunned Neagle. In came a resurrected David Cone, if only for one hitter before Torre pinch-hit for him with two out and two on in the sixth. Torre, not playing around, pressing all buttons for a 3-2 Game 4 victory, was, in effect, admitting that the Yankees were playing with World Series fire. He had seen this kind of spark get out of control before, become a blaze that burned down an Atlanta Braves' Series dynasty-in-the-making.</p>

        <p>IT turned out that Joe Torre had even less faith in Denny Neagle with a lead last night than Bobby Cox did four years ago. Mike Piazza had hit one tape-measure foul ball against Neagle in the first inning. He had belted a two-run homer into the Shea Stadium picnic area in the third. By the fifth inning, with Neagle one out from being the pitcher of record on the winning side, Torre would not allow Piazza to feast his eyes on Neagle again.</p>
        <p>Out went a stunned Neagle. In came a resurrected David Cone, if only for one hitter before Torre pinch-hit for him with two out and two on in the sixth. Torre, not playing around, pressing all buttons for a 3-2 Game 4 victory, was, in effect, admitting that the Yankees were playing with World Series fire. He had seen this kind of spark get out of control before, become a blaze that burned down an Atlanta Braves' Series dynasty-in-the-making.</p>
        <p>Torre remembered Neagle's last Game 4 Series start, in 1996, when Braves' manager Cox lifted him in the sixth inning after he had surrendered half a six-run lead against his Yankees. Jim Leyritz's 3-run homer ruined Mark Wohlers and the Braves that night. It was a fateful blast, the moment that launched the Yankees to where they are now, a victory away from four titles in five years. The Braves, defending champions, experienced tomahawk choppers, may have been a few measly outs from their own such run. Neagle, who didn't join the Braves until August 1996, left Atlanta with only memories of failure.</p>
        <p>''Every year, at least when I was with Atlanta, we'd make base-running mistakes,'' he said. ''Nobody would come up with a hit. When we needed to make that one big pitch, somebody else would get a hit against us. These guys in this clubhouse -- with guys like El Duque, with Jeter, with Bernie, now Justice -- it's a different guy every year.''</p>
        <p>It was happening this fall, even after their September slide, until their 14-game Series streak was halted in Game 3. But the moment Edgardo Alfonzo squeezed David Justice's pop fly for the last out Tuesday, the Mets were suddenly where the Yankees were four years ago, on the verge of discovering if their decorated opponent was too seasoned to touch, or ripe enough to be plucked.</p>
        <p>Torre had two choices for the starting assignment last night. Cone, who all season was the embodiment of decline, or Neagle, an ominous reminder of how form is not always worth the newspaper on which it's promoted. Torre went with the younger arm, but in yanking Neagle the way he did, it became clear that his head was in charge last night, not his heart.</p>
        <p>''He really didn't say anything,'' Neagle would say. ''He just asked for the ball.''</p>
        <p>''I looked in his eye and he was shocked,'' Torre said. ''But I had just made up my mind that Cone was going to pitch to Piazza.''</p>
        <p>A week ago, all signs, all emotions, pointed to Cone on the mound again at Shea. He has given New York and Torre's Yankees so much, but his record in 2000 made too good a case against banking on the past. As it turned out, Torre gave Cone one hitter, five pitches, maybe the last he'll throw. Cone, pitching in Shea for the first time since the Mets traded him in 1992, got Piazza to pop out.</p>
        <p>''I'd like to believe experience gives you a certain amount of advantage,'' Torre would say, knowing that Cone by now had little else to give.</p>
        <p>The years can be linked by experience, by results. The Yankees' last two were a jackpot exacta. But there is also an intuition that sometimes suggests change, something weird about to go down. Four years ago, there was no doubt that the Braves were in trouble as Leyritz circled the bases while Wohlers hung his head.</p>
        <p>Torre had to have that in his subconscious last night. He felt urgency, if only to remove all possibility of elimination pressure being put on the shoulders of his hard-throwing head-hunter and bat-hurler. The Mets, Roger Clemens and Game 6. Fourteen years ago, Clemens started against the Mets in the game that has been celebrated more than any other in their history. Now he is public enemy No. 1 in the Mets' clubhouse. That was motivation enough for Torre to want to at least meet Saturday night with a margin of error.</p>
        <p>Derek Jeter homered to left-center on Bobby Jones's first pitch. Paul O'Neill tripled and scored in the second. Jeter tripled and scored in the third. They were standing up, coming through, just as Neagle had said. Neagle thought he was, too, until Torre took the ball from him, went to work massaging his staff. Cone. Jeff Nelson. Mike Stanton. Finally, safely, Mariano Rivera in the eighth inning with the score still 3-2.</p>
        <p>In the night air of Queens, the Subway Series had rumbled to a fateful fork in the tracks. As Yogi would say, Torre and the Yankees took it.</p>
