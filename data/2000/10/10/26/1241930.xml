        <p>DOMINGO RODRIGUEZ, in after-shower boxers and a T-shirt, appeared fresh even after nine hours of apple picking. While a stereo played Spanish music, the lacy window curtains fluttered and the bistec sizzled under the broiler, Mr. Rodriguez, a migrant worker, gave a tour of the modest 810-square-foot house he shares with Alain Leon Burgos. He reveled in its comforts as if it were a fine hotel. Mr. Rodriguez and Mr. Burgos are part of a six-man crew that came up from Puerto Rico in June to help harvest 400 acres of apples and 200 acres of peaches at Bream Orchards, in the fruit-picking heartland of Pennsylvania near Gettysburg.</p>
        <p>The house is a prefabricated metal shed with aspirations: a pitched roof, a columned porch and an overstuffed Victorian armchair angled to catch the last warm rays of October sunlight. It is the work of Bryan Bell, the founder of Design Corps, a nonprofit operation dedicated to bringing design intelligence to bear on the enduring problem of substandard housing for migrant workers, ''among the poorest and worst-housed groups in the United States,'' according to a report released last week by the Housing Assistance Council, an advocacy group in Washington.</p>
        <p>The house where Mr. Rodriguez, 54, lives for five months each year is one of four identical buildings in a neighborly row in an apple orchard. Vincent Scully, the architectural historian, has called them ''small temples for migrant workers.'' Mr. Rodriguez, pausing to show off a washing machine tucked neatly in a closet off a sunny hallway that leads to two bedrooms, called it a ''dream house,'' one step toward the suburban ranch pinups he had torn from magazines to decorate the walls. It was a world away from the chicken coop crudely adapted to human use that Mr. Rodriguez used to occupy. And it is nothing like the dilapidated mobile homes, concrete-slab dormitories with outhouses or decades-old one-room bullpens, where male workers sleep on cots crammed side by side. Such substandard housing is still visible along the county roads of rural America. Every picking season, local newspapers chronicle even worse conditions throughout the country: migrants sleeping in tents, caves, cars or under bridges.</p>
        <p>Moises Loza, the executive director of the Housing Assistance Council, which issued the report ''Abundant Fields, Meager Shelter,'' called migrant housing ''an undeclared disaster of the highest urgency.''</p>
        <p>There are more than 1.3 million migrant workers in the United States, who come mostly from Mexico but also from Puerto Rico, Haiti, Jamaica, Florida and Texas and travel state to state in search of work. Many don't speak English. According to the Labor Department's National Agricultural Workers Survey, released in March, 52 percent of the hired farmworkers are illegal immigrants. They are also largely invisible: ladders poking up along horizons of fruit trees, or the weekly rush of Spanish-speaking customers at a local grocery store, offer the only evidence that they are here -- until they make the news. Last month in Farmingville, N.Y., two Mexican men looking for work were beaten and knifed by two men posing as contractors promising jobs -- a brutal testament to the sometimes uneasy relationship between laborers and the communities where they work.</p>
        <p>Migrant workers usually stick to themselves. Their median income is $850 a month, earned over a five-month picking season, and their yearly income is well below the poverty level. When the growers who hire migrant workers do not provide them with a place to live, their housing options are dismal: they cannot take on rental leases for their short stay, and motels are prohibitively expensive.</p>
        <p>''What's tragic is that what migrant workers do is  critical to everyone, to all of us who eat, and yet they don't have any influence to get things done,'' Mr. Loza said, lamenting the lack of a comprehensive federal policy easily applicable to migrant housing. ''In any other situation, war would be declared and the problem would be addressed, but still nobody is doing anything about it.'' Migrant workers are even losing ground, according to the Workers Survey report, which found that their earnings, adjusted for inflation, are 11 percent lower than they were 10 years ago, having stagnated at a national adjusted average of $7,500 a year.</p>
        <p>In an old sewing machine factory overlooking the battlefields of Gettysburg, Mr. Bell, 40, has pledged himself to the fight. A bashful man (he could be a von Trapp sibling in ''The Sound of Music'') in a flannel shirt and tan work boots, Mr. Bell has himself come a long way from the kind of work he did as a graduate with architecture degrees from Princeton and Yale.</p>
        <p>Ten years ago, Mr. Bell was doing what was expected of him, working his way up in a prestigious New York firm, Steven Holl Architects, designing doorknobs and details for a multimillion-dollar house. ''I realized that that wasn't what I wanted to be doing with the talents I had, with the education I had,'' Mr. Bell said, over tacos and papaya juice at a roadhouse near the fields, where workers come for lunch on their 30-minute breaks. ''I was determined to do something different, something that I valued.''</p>
        <p>At the time, Mr. Bell's sister, then a legal aide, began sending him photographs showing the degraded conditions of migrant housing in Pennsylvania. She was inspecting camps to see that they met federal and state housing codes. She described motel-style buildings with communal toilets and dank barrack-type dwellings, images of ''overcrowding, overflowing toilets, raw sewage.''</p>
        <p>''My sister also told me about the fear and paranoia,'' he said. ''People were so afraid to talk about the problems, they'd pass notes instead.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bell quit his job and moved down to a fishing shack on a stream with no electricity in Gettysburg, a part of one of the largest fruit-processing regions on the East Coast, where outhouses, though uncommon, are still in use. ''I wanted to try and see if I could get to know a very small community very well, and do appropriate architecture for them,'' he said. ''I was challenging my value as an architect. I saw a problem and thought here was someplace I could come in and help. To me it was a design problem.''</p>
        <p>In many states, there are small pockets of activism -- church groups and nonprofit organizations working with communities to build a handful of better houses. Mr. Bell himself has spent considerable time learning from Samuel Mockbee at Rural Studio in Greensboro,  Ala., where each semester students make buildings for the impoverished residents of Hale County, Ala.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Bell's goal is more ambitious: develop a national housing program tailored to the financial realities of farmers and the daily needs of workers, and installed at very low cost. ''I'm against the generic,'' said Mr. Bell, who envisions as many building types as there are migrant communities. ''Every tiny cultural group should somehow have the opportunity to shape their environment.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bell started out by interviewing dozens of migrant workers and growers on the East Coast. He recruited volunteers to work with him, sending them to local migrant health centers, where workers were more likely to speak freely. ''Nobody ever really talked to migrant workers about what was best, what was good and what was bad, or what was the housing like where they came from,'' Mr. Bell said. ''The workers themselves didn't want to complain, because they think of themselves as guests in this country.''</p>
        <p>For five years he worked with Rural Opportunities, a program financed by the Agriculture and Labor Departments, learning how to apply for grants and how to tap into the byzantine world of federal aid.</p>
        <p>And he talked to growers, traveling to their association meetings to lecture. ''I always spoke after the guy who was talking about dagger nematodes, a parasite that kills apple trees,'' he recalled. ''I knew that lecture by heart.'' Mr. Bell slept in his car, short of hotel money, but stored up a wealth of raw experience. He learned that farmers were resentful but resigned to remaining the main providers of worker housing. ''They had gotten into it out of necessity, because no one else could afford the operating costs,'' Mr. Bell explained.</p>
        <p>In 1991, he opened Design Corps and began designing in earnest. Mark Bream, a third-generation farmer, was one of the first fruit growers to sign on. ''I wish I could just put my ad in the paper, get workers and get the job done,'' he said in an interview. ''But that's just not the way it works. It doesn't make you any money. But at least I have workers when I need them.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bell has built 10 houses for 50 migrant workers in Pennsylvania, including the one occupied by Mr. Rodriguez. Mr. Bream paid $75,000 for his four units, with matching funds Mr. Bell helped him get from the state. Mr. Bream provides the land and pays for utilities and maintenance. ''If you don't have the housing, it's really hard to get the workers,'' said Mr. Bream, who charges each laborer $9 a week for housing.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bell alters prefabricated units to need, using design to meet and often exceed federal and state code requirements. For example, a house is required to provide 100 square feet per person. Mr. Bell's five-man dwelling at Bream Orchards is 810 square feet, with no extra cost to the farmer.</p>
        <p>When asked to describe his designs, Mr. Bell refrains from professional jargon, describing instead how design can make a typical picker's job a little less spirit- and backbreaking. ''Not all design issues are about money,'' he said. ''Having the sun come in your window in the morning doesn't cost anything. They come back from work with some equipment. So I made a screened  porch where they can drop off their tools, and I have a big sink there so they can wash up some from the pesticides. Generally, a couple of them will start cooking, while some are showering, taking turns.'' He made sure to build in a long kitchen counter that could double as a dining bar for ad hoc meals.</p>
        <p>Exhausted pickers' most popular activity was watching television lying down. ''Originally, I had the TV in one bedroom, but they were all piling on one guy's bed to watch it,'' Mr. Bell explained. So in one model he has arranged a four-bed space with a television in the middle so that everyone can watch while reclining. He aligned windows on each side of the living room ''to make sure there's plenty of cross ventilation, because there are rarely any air-conditioners.'' he said, adding: ''And I always try to include porches. They just seem to  remind people universally of home.''</p>
        <p>Early next year, four new units will be constructed  near Gettysburg. Farmers often ask for housing that can accommodate as many as 30 men, but Mr. Bell prefers a more intimate scale. ''They come up from the South by car, four or five men,'' he explained. By the time workers reach Pennsylvania, ''the core group of friends has already formed,'' he added. The housing unit itself is shaped aerodynamically, with a rounded roof and a porch with a flaring roofline. ''I wanted it to suggest modes of transportation: a Conestoga wagon, or an Airstream trailer,'' Mr. Bell said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mockbee, his mentor, said: ''Seeing Bryan's work, you say, 'Ah! There's intelligence at work here,' but it doesn't scream at you. His work is much closer to the client's aspirations than what most architects would ever consider catering to.''</p>
        <p>This winter, Mr. Bell is taking his campaign on the road to South Carolina, where living conditions are more squalid and farmers are slower to upgrade. This time, his model house has four bedrooms for eight people, two airy porches and a communal living room with 10-foot ceilings, two stoves and two refrigerators for families who told him they preferred to live in pairs, as long as each family could have its own kitchen space. Mr. Bell's conviction that design can improve lives is unshaken. ''It started out as a search,'' he said. ''Now I know it's the truth: designers are needed to address social issues.''</p>
        <p>In Pennsylvania in early October, Mr. Rodriguez was expecting only one more week of work, as the harvest was ending. His earnings this year will be about $4,000, a disappointment after last year's bumper crop, when he brought home $6,000. He offered three visitors plastic cups full of crunchy, savory green bananas, which he had sauteed with onions to accompany his bistec.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bell noticed that Mr. Rodriguez had moved the refrigerator to hide the trash can from view. The architect made a mental note. Next time, he'd make sure to design a cabinet to do that job.</p>
