        <p>Franklin Resources, the operator of the Franklin, Templeton and Mutual Series mutual fund groups, announced a deal yesterday to acquire Fiduciary Trust for $825 million in an all-stock transaction. The new company will manage assets of more than $280 billion. Charles B. Johnson, chairman and chief executive of Franklin, said the deal would combine ''complementary'' businesses. ''Franklin has been primarily a retail operation and Fiduciary has been primarily an institutional operation,'' he said. Franklin, based in San Mateo, Calif., is the No. 8 manager of mutual funds. Fiduciary Trust of New York manages about $50 billion for wealthy and institutional clients.</p>
