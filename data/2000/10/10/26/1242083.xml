        <p>The Mets needed to build on the momentum of their Game 3 victory, but it didn't even last a single pitch in Game 4 of the Subway Series last night. Derek Jeter clubbed Bobby J. Jones's first offering of the game for a home run, giving the Yankees a lead they never relinquished, and now the Yankees are on the verge of another championship.</p>
        <p>A relay team of Yankees' relievers -- David Cone, Jeff Nelson, Mike Stanton and Mariano Rivera -- maintained a 3-2 lead from the fifth inning through the ninth at Shea Stadium, giving the Yankees a 3-1 lead in the four-of-seven-game series. Jeter added a triple to his home run and scored twice, and Paul O'Neill, 37, who has been revitalized in this Series, had a triple and single and made a sliding catch to start the bottom of the eighth inning.</p>
        <p>Cone got one out in the fifth in relief of Denny Neagle. Nelson got four outs, Stanton two, and Rivera came on to pitch the final two innings for the Yankees. ''They made a lot of good pitches, especially out of the bullpen,'' said Bobby Valentine, the Mets' manager.</p>
        <p>The Yankees staggered and nearly collapsed at the end of the regular season and barely got through the first round of the playoffs against the Oakland Athletics. They play with the knowledge that some of the veterans who have been integral to the recent championships probably won't be in pinstripes next year. But now they are one victory away from becoming the first team since the Athletics of 1972-74 to win three consecutive championships, and the first team to do so since the advent of free agency in 1976, a change that made it far more difficult for clubs to hold a core of players together.</p>
        <p>Al Leiter will try to keep the Mets' hopes alive tonight in Game 5 at Shea Stadium, pitching against the Yankees' Andy Pettitte, but there is no longer any margin of error for the Mets. No team has come back from a 3-1 deficit to win the World Series since 1985, when the Kansas City Royals eventually defeated the St. Louis Cardinals.</p>
        <p>Yankees Manager Joe Torre juggled his lineup a little for Game 4, replacing Jose Vizcaino with Luis Sojo at second base and reluctantly shifting Derek Jeter to the leadoff spot. Jeter is the antithesis of the prototypical leadoff hitter, an aggressive swinger more likely to hack at the first pitch than wait patiently, and Torre strongly prefers using him as his No. 2 hitter. But with Chuck Knoblauch out of the lineup, Jeter was Torre's best option.</p>
        <p>Jones, the Mets' starter, usually has good control and pitches around the strike zone, but he did start the game with a twist, throwing a changeup with his first pitch rather than a fastball.</p>
        <p>Just before Jones threw the pitch, Knoblauch made a prediction on the Yankees' bench: ''First pitch is going out.'' Vizcaino and a couple of others on the Yankee bench heard it.</p>
        <p>Jeter attacked the first pitch and launched a high drive to left field, and before everybody was seated at Shea Stadium, the Yankees led by 1-0. It was, Torre said later, a huge lift, a relief, the first home run by a Yankees' leadoff batter in the first inning since Gene Woodling in Game 5 of the 1953 World Series.</p>
        <p>Some of the Yankees fell out of the dugout laughing. Vizcaino pointed at Knoblauch, and as soon as Jeter returned to the dugout, breathing heavily from excitement, Knoblauch sat next to him and filled him in. Jeter was laughing.</p>
        <p>''It was just a feeling,'' Knoblauch said afterward. ''You say it and you see what happens. You look smart when it happens.''</p>
        <p>And if you were one of the Yankees, you were off and running. ''We wanted to take the crowd out of it,'' Jeter said. ''We wanted to get some runs early.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees quickly added two more, O'Neill tripling and scoring on a sacrifice fly in the second, Jeter slamming a triple and coming home on a ground ball when the Mets elected to play the infield back with nobody out.</p>
        <p>Neagle was armed with a three-run lead in a situation similar to the one he faced in Game 4 of the 1996 World Series. Pitching for the Atlanta Braves in that game, Neagle had a 6-0 lead and was knocked out in the sixth. Two innings later, Jim Leyritz hammered a three-run homer off Mark Wohlers to tie the game, and the Yankees went on to win the championship.</p>
        <p>Neagle shut out the Mets in the first two innings last night, but not flawlessly -- he walked a couple of batters, and in the first inning, he threw a 78-mile-an-hour changeup over the middle of the plate that Mike Piazza launched about 420 feet, and foul.</p>
        <p>Timo Perez singled through the middle to start the third for the Mets, Neagle dropping to the ground to avoid the line drive, and took second as Edgardo Alfonzo grounded to third. Then Piazza extended his arms and slammed a two-run homer, cutting the Yankees' lead to 3-2.</p>
        <p>Piazza's monstrous foul ball and his home run off Neagle apparently weighed heavily on Torre, and as the Mets prepared to hit in the top of the fifth, a call went down to the Yankees' bullpen. Cone was told to warm up, to prepare to pitch to Piazza. Neagle retired the first two batters with easy fly balls.</p>
        <p>One out away from qualifying for a victory, Neagle stood behind the mound rubbing up a baseball, preparing to pitch to Piazza, and that was when he saw Torre stepping out of the Yankees' dugout and pointing his right hand toward the Yankees' bullpen, summoning Cone. Neagle was stunned, and he turned and glanced toward the scoreboard: Yes, the Yankees led, 3-2, and yes, he was one out away from finishing his fifth inning. He was finished for the night, and he was furious, handing the ball to Torre without looking at him.</p>
        <p>Cone, 37, jogged and then walked in from the visitors' bullpen for his first appearance in Shea Stadium since the Mets traded him to the Toronto Blue Jays in August 1992, curious at the response he would receive. ''It was pretty firm boos,'' Cone said. ''I know where I stand now.''</p>
        <p>Pitching from the stretch, Cone threw Piazza sharp sliders, and Piazza popped out to second. It was the beginning and the end for Cone, who was removed for a pinch-hitter in the top of the sixth, but the Yankees couldn't score in that inning, or any other. By the end of the night they would extend their streak of hitless at-bats with runners in scoring position to 14, and they would strand nine more runners, giving them 46 for the first four games.</p>
        <p>But Nelson relieved in the sixth, shutting out the Mets in that inning and striking out the leadoff batter in the seventh. After he walked a pinch-hitter, Lenny Harris, the left-hander Mike Stanton came on and pitched to Bubba Trammell, another pinch-hitter, and struck him out on a high fastball. Kurt Abbott was inserted as a pinch-hitter for Perez -- Valentine was doing all he could to score in that inning, knowing that the nearly unhittable Rivera loomed in the bullpen -- and Stanton struck him out, as well.</p>
        <p>Rivera came on to pitch the eighth, holding the Mets scoreless as O'Neill made a sliding catch on Alfonzo to open the inning. To start the ninth, Rivera buzzed a fastball over the inside corner to Benny Agbayani for a strikeout, rather than throwing his cutter outside, as right-handed hitters now expect him to do. He then retired Jay Payton on a fly ball.</p>
        <p>Matt Franco walked to the plate to pinch-hit. In July 1999, Franco had beaten Rivera with a two-run, two-out single in the bottom of the ninth at Shea, sending the stadium into a frenzy. But Rivera was in control here, throwing his hardest fastball of his two innings for the first strike before zipping a fastball to finish off Franco on a called third strike. Rivera pumped a fist.</p>
        <p>Sometime in the middle of the game, a pipe broke in the Yankees' clubhouse and flooded it, and as Torre headed back to the clubhouse, he had no idea of what he would find, whether there would be inches of standing water.</p>
        <p>''But right now,'' he said, smiling, ''I don't care.''</p>
