        <p>At last, after weeks of political sparring, backroom maneuvering and last-minute policy reversals by both Democrats and Republicans, the Nassau County Legislature expects to vote Thursday on a four-year fiscal rescue plan.</p>
        <p>But the result will probably be just what a state board monitoring the county's financial crisis had sought to avoid when it persuaded legislators to put off a vote one week ago: a vast disagreement over how much to raise county property taxes.</p>
        <p>''Between the Democrats and Republicans, there is no consensus,'' said David H. Peirez, a lawyer and a member of the state board. ''It is likely we will see a 10-to-9 vote, with the Democrats passing their proposal.''</p>
        <p>The Democrats, who have a one-vote majority in the County Legislature, have called for raising the county portion of local property tax bills by 16.3 percent next year, an average of $165 per household. Republican lawmakers have proposed a 5 percent increase, and Thomas S. Gulotta, the Republican county executive, has asked for a 3.8 percent rise in the county tax, which makes up 19 percent of property tax bills.</p>
        <p>Today, Democratic leaders said they had agreed to scale back their proposed increase to around 15 percent -- a figure that could change as budget talks continue until the vote, scheduled for 1 p.m. on Thursday.</p>
        <p>''Nobody wants to raise taxes 15 or 16 percent,'' said Darren S. Bloch, chief of staff to Judith A. Jacobs, a Democrat and the presiding officer of the County Legislature. ''But our philosophy was to propose an honest and balanced budget and to back into a tax increase after all the expenses were cut and after all the reforms were made. With that done, we are left with the 15 or 16 percent number.''</p>
        <p>The question now is whether a tax increase of that size will pass muster first with Mr. Gulotta, who has power to veto any legislative changes in his budget plans, and later with Frank G. Zarb, the man handpicked by Gov. George E. Pataki to head the seven-member state board, the Nassau Interim Finance Authority.</p>
        <p>In May, Mr. Pataki proposed a $100 million bailout of Nassau, one of the nation's wealthiest counties, but he has said he opposes tax increases as a way to help bridge a deficit estimated to reach nearly $400 million by 2004. Members of the state board, which has the power to seize day-to-day control of the county's finances, have said that a large tax increase without deep spending cuts would be unacceptable.</p>
        <p>Last week, Democrats in the County Legislature stood poised to pass a 2001 budget and spending plans for the following three years. In addition to tax increases, those plans included a wage freeze next year for unionized county workers whose contracts have expired, the merging of some governmental departments and millions of dollars in savings from the early retirement of about 10 percent of the county work force.</p>
        <p>But in the face of strong opposition from Republicans, Mr. Zarb negotiated a week's delay in the vote so his board could try to broker a consensus among the three county leaders: Mr. Gulotta, Ms. Jacobs and Peter J. Schmitt, the Republican minority leader. Despite hours of closed-door meetings with the state board in the last week, those involved in the talks said today that they had failed to bridge the huge gap between their competing plans.</p>
        <p>In those talks, the state overseers suggested that lawmakers be more optimistic in their budgeting -- an unusual stance for a board created to impose fiscal discipline, many said.</p>
        <p>They suggested, for instance, that lawmakers add $5 million to $10 million to the $776 million projected in sales tax receipts this year, which would also affect future years. But both Republicans and Democrats refused, saying that in past years Mr. Gulotta had contributed to the fiscal crisis by overestimating revenues.</p>
        <p>The state board also questioned whether the county needed the entire $13 million reserve fund that Democrats have budgeted for next year, or the entire $18.9 million surplus that the Democrats project. The Democrats say they insisted that those funds were needed to cover unexpected costs or deal with an economic downturn.</p>
        <p>The Democrats did, however, accept the board's estimate that next year the county will owe $6.6 million less than expected to the new Public Benefit Corporation, which provides health services to county residents.</p>
        <p>That one-time savings is one factor that would allow the Democrats to lower their proposed tax increase by about 1 percentage point, Ms. Jacobs said.</p>
        <p>The Democrats spent much of the last week increasing some of their spending proposals, both for next year and beyond. They withdrew their support for Mr. Gulotta's plan to eliminate about $50 million in aid to the county's three towns and two cities, and retracted their proposal to cut $500,000 from an agency that trains volunteer firefighters.</p>
        <p>Once passed, the four-year plan will be sent to Mr. Gulotta, who has 10 days to approve it or veto any change to his plans. The Legislature has another week to try to override any vetoes. Then the state board will rule on the final package.</p>
        <p>''I would say that after tomorrow, even though Gulotta has to look at it and even though he can stand everything on its head, at least we will have something in place,'' said Mr. Peirez. ''There's all kinds of scenarios, so a final product could be several weeks away.''</p>
