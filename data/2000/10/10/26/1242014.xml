        <p>Technology stocks plunged yesterday, pulling the broader stock market with them. The Nasdaq composite index fell 5.6 percent, its biggest daily decline since May, while the Dow Jones industrial average ended down just 0.6 percent.</p>
        <p>The selloff was spurred by the announcement on Tuesday by Nortel Networks, the Canadian maker of telecommunications equipment, that its the third-quarter sales, although very strong, rose less than analysts had expected.</p>
        <p>The fact that such a sales shortfall with otherwise strong growth sent investors scrambling to sell stocks is a sign of how uncertain many investors feel about the outlook for the economy. High oil prices, the continued weakness in the euro --  which is undermining the earnings of American multinationals -- and the turmoil in the Middle East are all keeping investors unnerved and with their fingers on the sell button.</p>
        <p>Nortel dropped 29 percent, to $45, on the New York Stock Exchange and led the Toronto Stock Exchange, where it is also traded, sharply lower. The flood of sell orders forced a halt in the trading of Nortel because the Toronto computers could not handle them. The Toronto Stock Exchange index of 300 stocks dropped 840.26 points, or 8.1 percent, to 9,511.84.</p>
        <p>Other fiber optic stocks also plunged. JDS Uniphase, which is scheduled to announce its quarterly earnings today and is a supplier to Nortel, fell 25.3 percent, to $71. SDL, which JDS Uniphase is acquiring, dropped 25.9 percent, to $234.19. Ciena, which makes optical networking equipment, fell 19.9 percent, to $108.38. These stocks had been holding up rather well, until now, compared with other technology stocks, which have helped push the Nasdaq index down 20.6 percent for the year.</p>
        <p>Lucent, which is Nortel's competitor, fell 6.1 percent, to $20.25. But Lucent stock had already dropped nearly 70 percent this year as its earnings eroded. The Lucent board fired Richard A. McGinn, its chief executive, on Monday. Some analysts had pointed to Nortel as an example of how Lucent should have been run.</p>
        <p>The fiber optic sell-off spread quickly throughout the technology sector, where many companies have cautioned about the near-term outlook for sales and earnings. Hewlett-Packard and I.B.M. helped lead the Dow lower, while Cisco, Sun Microsystems and Applied Micro Circuits joined JDS Uniphase in pulling the Nasdaq lower. These stocks and Corning, the fiber optic cable maker, worked with Nortel to bring the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index down 2.4 percent.</p>
        <p>At the end of the day, the Nasdaq was down 190.22 points, to 3,229.57, while the S.&amp; P. 500 fell 33.23 points,  to 1,364.90. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 66.59 points, to 10,326.48. The Nasdaq and the S.&amp; P. 500 are still above the 2000 lows they fell to two weeks ago, and the Dow is still above 10,000, below which it broke last week.</p>
        <p>Douglas R. Cliggott, United States equity strategist at J. P. Morgan Securities, said that it was clear that there was still a big gulf between the earnings expectations in the market and the actual numbers that companies are reporting. ''We've got a 1,300 target for the S.&amp; P. 500 for the year- end, and it is my sense that the Nasdaq could find a bottom in the 2,500 to 2,700 range,'' he said. ''But I have no idea if we are going to get there in the next few weeks or the next few months.''</p>
        <p>While Nortel sales jumped 42 percent, to $7.31 billion, they were about $300 million below expectations. That shortfall, said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at the First Albany Corporation, is fueling investor worries that the United States and world economies are slowing more than expected. And if that is the case, future earnings and sales growth for fiber optic and other technology companies will be less than expected, making their stocks overpriced.</p>
        <p>He said that many investors were  concerned that the American economy may have a hard landing, instead of the soft landing they have hoped for. ''The fear is that the Federal Reserve will be seduced into to keeping interest rates too high too long,'' he said, because of concerns about inflationary pressures, in part because of the sharp rise in oil prices.</p>
        <p>''The stock market is telling us that there should be a soft-landing but don't count on it,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But he said that investors are also struggling with another disappointment. That is that many of the favored technology companies, like Nortel, are proving unable to produce a steady stream of quarterly increases in the growth rates of both earnings and revenues. The high prices that many of these stocks had reached were a bet, he said, that this fantastic growth would continue.</p>
        <p>''Now, we don't believe that any more,'' he said.</p>
