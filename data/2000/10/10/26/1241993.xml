        <p>It seemed yesterday as if the last person C. Michael Armstrong wanted to credit for AT&amp;T's breakup plan was John C. Malone, the cable television entrepreneur who has been the most vocal proponent for change among AT&amp;T's board members.</p>

        <p>It seemed yesterday as if the last person C. Michael Armstrong wanted to credit for AT&amp;T's breakup plan was John C. Malone, the cable television entrepreneur who has been the most vocal proponent for change among AT&amp;T's board members.</p>
        <p>''He participated just like all the other terrific board members,'' Mr. Armstrong said of Mr. Malone during a news briefing yesterday. ''No more, no less.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Malone is not just any board member. After agreeing to sell his cable company, Tele-Communications Inc., to AT&amp;T in 1998, he became one of AT&amp;T's biggest owners, with nearly 28 million shares. His deft orchestration of that deal left him in control of Liberty Media Corporation, AT&amp;T's cable programming unit.</p>
        <p>And so many Wall Street onlookers yesterday noted that AT&amp;T's radical transformation plan -- which among other things restores the cable properties to independence and introduces a new tracking stock for the company's consumer long-distance business -- has all the hallmarks of Mr. Malone's brand of financial engineering.</p>
        <p>Mr. Malone has acknowledged his penchant for complexity. In a 1998 interview with a trade publication, he said that he needed ''a corner somewhere where I can just sit and scheme. Come up with creative, structural ideas, technical or financial -- that's me, that's my personality.'' Yesterday, however, he was not returning phone calls seeking comment on AT&amp;T's machinations. Analysts said the market, for its part, was signaling its displeasure with those arrangements by driving AT&amp;T's stock down 14 percent yesterday.</p>
        <p>Equally intriguing for Wall Street was handicapping another question that Mr. Malone would not answer -- what he will do next. It was a sign of Mr. Malone's unpredictability that even market veterans had wildly varied takes on his likely moves.</p>
        <p>One investor who has followed Mr. Malone for a number of years said he believed that ultimately Mr. Malone would like to see Liberty merged into AT&amp;T's cable businesses. In the early 1990's, Mr. Malone had split Liberty's programming holdings from Tele-Communications's cable systems, only to merge them back together and then a year later create a separate Liberty tracking stock.</p>
        <p>This investor, speaking on condition of anonymity, noted that though Mr. Malone had sold Tele-Communications, he has not lost his enthusiasm for cable systems -- and, indeed, has been increasing his cable holdings outside the United States.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, Chris Dixon, who follows media for PaineWebber, said he thought it more likely that Mr. Malone would instead guide Liberty in a different direction -- toward increasing its stake in a company that does not exist quite yet, the soon-to-be merged AOL-Time Warner.</p>
        <p>That, Mr. Dixon said, would require a different, but equally complex, series of transactions.</p>
        <p>In AT&amp;T's planned break up, the cable unit, now called AT&amp;T Broadband, will retain ownership of a 25 percent interest in Time Warner Entertainment. That is the portion of the current Time Warner that holds the company's cable systems, Warner Brothers movie studio and Home Box Office cable programming operation.</p>
        <p>If AT&amp;T wanted to create additional value from those holdings, it could sell its stake back to Time Warner. But that would trigger tax consequences.</p>
        <p>Instead, Mr. Dixon suggested, AT&amp;T might exchange its Time Warner Entertainment holdings for Liberty stock. In turn, Liberty could swap the Time Warner Entertainment stake for shares in the new AOL-Time Warner.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the most obvious unanswered question is whether Mr. Malone will cut Liberty's tether to AT&amp;T in the wake of the latter's break-up plans.</p>
        <p>Neither Liberty nor AT&amp;T can seriously consider such a step until next year, because of how AT&amp;T accounted for its acquisition of Tele-Communications.</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Malone, an assiduous negotiator, saw to it that Liberty would retain the tax benefits of $2 billion in net operating losses that were carried on the books of Tele-Communications when he sold it to AT&amp;T.</p>
        <p>If Liberty were spun off, AT&amp;T would have to pay it the cash value of those losses -- a sum that could run to hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>
