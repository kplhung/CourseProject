        <p>Two subway trains with no passengers aboard collided on the elevated No. 4 tracks in the Bronx last night, injuring both motormen, one of them seriously, the authorities said.</p>
        <p>The accident, which happened just south of the Fordham Road station about 6:40 p.m., shut down the No. 4 line for 12 stops, from the Yankee Stadium stop to the north end of the line at Woodlawn Avenue. But Joseph E. Hofmann, the head of New York City Transit's subway division, said that he expected service to return to normal by this morning's rush. In the meantime, passengers were taking shuttle buses.</p>
        <p>The empty trains were being driven from the car wash at the Mosholu Parkway trainyard to another yard on 239th Street. They were both southbound on the middle or express track when one ran into the back of the other, said Deirdre Parker, a transit spokeswoman.</p>
        <p>People who live near the Fordham Road station, at Jerome Avenue in the Fordham section, described hearing what sounded like a huge explosion and seeing a flash of light that illuminated their living rooms.</p>
        <p>Both motormen, who were the only people on the trains, were alert and conscious and did not appear to have broken any bones, said Firefighter Robert Calise, a Fire Department spokesman.</p>
        <p>But one was in serious condition and the other in stable condition at Jacobi Medical Center last night, hospital officials said. Neither the motormen's names nor the details of their injuries were released.</p>
        <p>Ms. Parker said that both motormen had been on the job for less than a year but had clean records. Mr. Hofmann said he had been told that there were skid marks leading up to the accident, indicating that the motorman in the train that hit the other one had tried to brake.</p>
        <p>The accident damaged the train that was struck and partly derailed it, Ms. Parker said, and workers were trying last night to hoist the train back onto the tracks so that it could be towed out. Service would be restored soon after that happened, she said.</p>
