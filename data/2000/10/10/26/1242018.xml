        <p>One man rented a wheelchair and coasted into the handicapped section at Yankee Stadium -- with nothing more serious than a broken foot. A roofing contractor guzzled a bottle of hot sauce and nearly threw up to score a ticket to Game 3 at Shea Stadium. A 13-year-old, open-mouthed and in the dental chair, made a bet with his orthodontist and won a pair of tickets to a Subway Series matchup.</p>
        <p>Savvy and shamelessness -- both proud New York qualities and, of course, not always mutually exclusive -- have been in full force over the last week as the first all-city World Series in 44 years has fueled a mania for tickets.</p>
        <p>And as the Series unfolds, nearly every person without season tickets or celebrity status who has managed to get a seat at a game has a story to tell about how he or she did it.</p>
        <p>''It was a miracle -- divine intervention,'' said the Rev. John Michalczack, a Catholic priest in Midland Park, N.J., who was drafting a sermon when an old friend called to offer him a ticket to Game 1.</p>
        <p>With roughly half the tickets at Shea and Yankee Stadiums sold to season ticket holders, and thousands more doled out to corporate sponsors and celebrities, the remaining few have inspired frantic searches and desperate phone calls.</p>
        <p>In a city full of people who are used to getting their way, even the well-connected are finding it difficult to get a ticket.</p>
        <p>''We don't have them, and we're not going to get them, I don't care how much we pay,'' said Rachel Levy, who gets tickets to Broadway shows and other events for guests at the Plaza Hotel. ''I'm telling people to sit in their rooms, order a cold beer and enjoy the game on TV.''</p>
        <p>Anyone suspected of sitting on tickets is besieged. And while the personal connection might be faint, the pitch is often baldly direct.</p>
        <p>''A guy I haven't spoken to since 1946 looked me up in the junior high yearbook and asked me if I could get him tickets,'' said Howard J. Rubenstein, whose New York public relations firm represents the Yankees. ''I've gotten 200, maybe 250 calls. I do have a handful of tickets, but only a handful.''</p>
        <p>The scramble for World Series seats is driven by a love for the game -- and the tight mathematics of allotments. Yankee Stadium holds 57,746 people; Shea Stadium, 56,521. Season ticket holders have the opportunity to buy varying numbers of World Series tickets -- generally, one ticket per Series game at their team's stadium for every season ticket they hold. About 30,000 people have Yankee season tickets, and about 34,000 have them for the Mets.</p>
        <p>What happens to the rest of the tickets is something of a mystery. Officials with Major League Baseball and the Yankees proved unhelpful. But a Mets spokesman said that about 11,000 tickets per game are set aside for the 28 other major-league teams and about 5,000 are reserved for corporate sponsors, team employees and a roster of celebrities ranging from television and film stars to musicians and politicians.</p>
        <p>At Shea Stadium, that leaves around 5,000 tickets per game. As the two teams head into their fifth game, neither the Yankees nor the Mets had any tickets left for the public, although in recent days a handful of cancellations had led to surprisingly good seats for the persistent.</p>
        <p>Jay Horwitz, a spokesman for the Mets, said celebrities receive special treatment because team officials like it when these notables are seen at the game by the millions watching on television. Last week, a representative for Charles Barkley, the former N.B.A. star, called and got a ticket for the athlete, Mr. Horwitz said. Carl Bernstein, the journalist, also got a pair, he added. Late last week, the Mets still had a handful of celebrity tickets.</p>
        <p>''I'm sure there will be room for Madonna,'' Mr. Horwitz said.</p>
        <p>There's also room for anyone willing to pay a steep price. Despite the city's efforts to ban scalping, well-heeled fans have been able to buy tickets by shelling out hundreds of dollars, or even thousands.</p>
        <p>''Come hell or high water, I was going to this game,'' said Steve Baldridge, a Long Island man who paid $5,200 for four tickets to Game 1.</p>
        <p>For most others this week, the dearth of seats has created the impression of a kind of ticket netherworld, where the best spots in the stadium pass from the wealthy to the influential but rarely to the typical fan.</p>
        <p>Yet the boasts of many fans striding into the stadiums suggest that fate still rewards those who have chutzpah and flair.</p>
        <p>Jason Cohen, a 20-year-old student at Brandeis University in Massachusetts, got inside Yankee Stadium by capitalizing on a foot that he had broken in a basketball game. When Cohen told Yankee officials that he could not walk, they sold him a pair of Game 1 tickets. He rented a wheelchair and headed inside with a friend toward a section reserved for the disabled.</p>
        <p>''God broke my leg for me,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Richie Devos, a roofer in Middletown, N.Y., was listening to a World Series ticket giveaway on WSPK-FM in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., last week as he drove to work. When the disc jockey mentioned a fiery sauce he had concocted, Mr. Devos called and offered to drink it for a World Series ticket. The hot sauce was unrelated to the contest, but the disc jockey told him to come to the station.</p>
        <p>''My mouth was so hot, I ran out of the station and started eating grass,'' Mr. Devos recalled as he made his way into Shea Stadium for Game 3. ''It was worth every swallow.''</p>
        <p>Tom Hammerschmitt Jr., 13, of Massapequa, N.Y., bet his orthodontist, a Yankee fan, that the Mets would qualify for the Series. When it happened, the orthodontist offered him two tickets to Game 1.</p>
        <p>''Our orthodontist is a sweetheart,'' said Tom Hammerschmitt, the boy's father. ''Of course, I've got four kids, and three of them have braces.''</p>
