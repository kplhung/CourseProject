        <p>Amani Toomer today called Philadelphia Eagles tackle Jon Runyan, with whom Toomer played at the University of Michigan, ''one mean guy.''</p>
        <p>''He's a good guy,'' Toomer said. ''But on the field, he's a tough guy.''</p>
        <p>Eagles Coach Andy Reid earlier this season of the 6-foot-7-inch, 330-pound Runyan, said, ''He's got everything you want in a tackle -- youth, size and he's very mean.''</p>
        <p>After going head-to-head with Runyan in the Giants' 33-18 victory over Philadelphia last month, Michael Strahan said: ''He got outplayed today. What can I say?''</p>
        <p>The Runyan-Strahan duel will once again be a central subplot on Sunday when the Eagles, who have won four of their last five games, play at Giants Stadium. With Jason Sehorn out because of a cracked rib, Strahan's ability to distract or pressure quarterback Donovan McNabb is more pivotal than ever.</p>
        <p>A former Tennessee Titan, Runyan was the Eagles' primary free-agent acquisition in the off-season, a player acquired to protect McNabb and to open holes for running back Duce Staley. Strahan did not have a sack against Runyan last month, but his three tackles were part of an overall dominating defensive effort by the Giants. The Eagles had just 56 yards rushing and only 13 first downs.</p>
        <p>Since Staley is injured, the focus on Sunday will be on McNabb, and while Strahan has just 3.5 sacks this season, it would not be surprising if the Eagles consider controlling the Giants' three-time Pro Bowler their chief priority. Strahan has had some of the best games of his career against the Eagles.</p>
        <p>Last season, he had three sacks and a 44-yard interception return for the game-winning touchdown in overtime at Philadelphia. In 1998, he had two sacks in another game against the Eagles, and in 1997, 2.5 sacks and a fumble recovery. In 1995, Strahan blocked an Eagles' punt for a safety. Strahan's first sack of his National Football League career came against the Eagles in 1993.</p>
        <p>Reid said he thought Strahan had the upper hand against Runyan early in last month's game but that Runyan settled down after that.</p>
        <p>''They got after each other and it was a nice battle to watch,'' Reid said today.</p>
        <p>Interestingly, the key matchup when the Giants have the football will take place in essentially the same part of the line of scrimmage, when 37-year-old Giants tackle Lomas Brown faces Hugh Douglas.</p>
        <p>Douglas has 11 sacks, and that ties him for the N.F.L. lead with New Orleans' La'Roi Glover. Douglas, the 29-year-old former Jet, beat Brown for an early sack when the teams played in the second game of the season last month. But then the wily Brown kept Douglas away from Giants quarterback Kerry Collins for the rest of the game.</p>
        <p>''He's a pearl,'' Douglas said today of Brown in a conference call. ''I know everybody says he's a little bit older, but Lomas played good against me the last time I met up with him.''</p>
        <p>Brown said he was still studying video tapes of Douglas, trying to get an edge.</p>
        <p>''I know it will be a dogfight,'' Brown said. ''He's added 20 pounds that have made him stronger.''</p>
        <p>After playing in just four games last season, Douglas added the weight during the off-season because he believed it would help ward off injury. He now weighs 270 pounds. Douglas also believes the Eagles will be a little more mentally prepared to face the Giants on Sunday than they were last month.</p>
        <p>''Because we were coming off that big win in Dallas, we had our heads in the clouds,'' Douglas said of the Eagles' season-opening rout against the Cowboys. ''We underestimated the Giants. This week, we'll have a little more respect for the Giants, or a lot more.''</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>Thousands of grass trays in the center of the Giants Stadium experimental grass field are being replaced this week. Most of the renovating, scheduled to be done well before Sunday's game, is aimed at improving the grass between the yard-line numbers on the field. It is the third significant refurbishing of the new grass-tray field installed just before the season began. ''They're going through some growing pains, but our players would still rather play on this than artificial turf,'' Giants Coach JIM FASSEL said. ''We've been playing on a field that hadn't matured. Now they are putting back the more mature field that we were playing on in the preseason. It's not perfect yet, but this is still the right thing for us in this stadium. At least they can keep changing it until things get better. That's the good thing.''</p>
