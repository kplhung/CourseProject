        <p>Eight months after he was hired to bring a streamlined, corporate approach to the volunteer-based United States Olympic Committee, Norm Blake, its chief executive officer, resigned yesterday, saying that he lacked internal support to remake the organization.</p>
        <p>Armed with a three-year contract, Blake cut the U.S.O.C. staff by 40 positions and the number of operating committees from 40 to 4, and told various sports' governing bodies that funding would be based on performance in the Winter and Summer Games. He encountered much resistance, however.</p>
        <p>The U.S.O.C. has a constituency of 28 Olympic sports and a dozen affiliated sports, along with a volunteer base that is often slow and reluctant to make change, that is consumed by internal politics and is prone to self-serving behavior. The U.S.O.C. was criticized for its lack of oversight as the Salt Lake City bribery scandal unfurled, and its drug-testing program has been largely discredited.</p>
        <p>''This was a far more political organization than I could possibly have imagined,'' Blake said. His plan to transform the U.S.O.C., he said, could not be put into use because of ''the absence of sufficient organizational resolve and commitment.''</p>
        <p>His critics, primarily those who represent athletes on the U.S.O.C.'s board, contended that Blake's autocratic, inflexible management style made it impossible to develop a consensus.</p>
        <p>Problems with the U.S.O.C. have also been overstated, they said.</p>
        <p>''I think he didn't understand the complexity of the organization in terms of its constituency,'' said Bill Stapleton, chairman of the U.S.O.C.'s athletes advisory council. ''And he never earned political capital with the athletes or the national governing bodies, and those people make up 75 percent of the board of directors.''</p>
        <p>As a successor is sought, Blake said he might stay on until the 2002 Winter Games in Salt Lake City. But Stapleton said he should stay no longer than a month.</p>
