        <p>The Devils visited the Florida Panthers tonight hoping to more closely resemble the offensive juggernaut they have been at home.</p>
        <p>''It's like we're two teams,'' goalie Martin Brodeur said after the Devils edged the Panthers, 2-1, in a fight-punctuated game here before 13,791 at the National Car Rental Center.</p>
        <p>The Devils looked more like the lambs they have been on the road than the wolves they have been at home until left wing Patrik Elias provided the game winner 1 minute 33 seconds from the end of regulation. He loomed on the left as center Bobby Holik shot from 20 feet. The puck bounced away from Panthers goalie Roberto Luongo, and Elias was there to lift the puck over Luongo's fallen body.</p>
        <p>In the friendly environs of Continental Arena, the Devils have played like defending Stanley Cup champions, scoring 19 goals in three rollicking victories. Their road performance has been far more suspect: now 1-2-1, with only 8 goals scored.</p>
        <p>Still, Brodeur stopped 20 shots as the Devils registered their first road victory this season. ''We got that one off our shoulders,'' he said with a big smile.</p>
        <p>The veteran defenseman Ken Daneyko said that the Devils are only now starting to get into this season, after winning the Stanley Cup last season.</p>
        <p>''No matter what anybody says, we went through a long year,'' Daneyko said. ''It's tough to get your intensity going this early in the season. Here we are, 4-2-1, and we really haven't played well.''</p>
        <p>Before the game, right wing Randy McKay said that the Devils felt it was imperative to get off to a strong start tonight.</p>
        <p>But Devils defenseman Ken Sutton was whistled for cross-checking 3:57 into the game, setting up a fortuitous power-play goal by Florida defenseman Jaroslav Spacek four seconds before the power play was to end.</p>
        <p>Spacek's shot first bounced off Peter Sykora's stick and then Daneyko's before bounding unpredictably over Brodeur's right shoulder. ''At least none of the Panthers scored on me,'' Brodeur said.</p>
        <p>It was a potentially unnerving start for Brodeur, who was pulled for the first time in two and a half years in his last game, Thursday against Washington. He had given up four goals in less than 34 minutes.</p>
        <p>Brodeur came into the game with an uncharacteristic 3.24 goals-against average and an .857 save percentage that was third-worst in the league.</p>
        <p>Perhaps, though, the Panthers were the cure for his slump. He arrived here 9-0-3 in his past 12 starts against Florida.</p>
        <p>As Brodeur settled into a comfortable zone, despite a five-minute boarding penalty against Holik in the second period that allowed Florida to be on the power play for three minutes, the Devils began to improve their play on the offensive end.</p>
        <p>It finally paid off at 12:55 of the second period. The Panthers had just been denied an apparent goal when left wing Pete Worrell was charged with goaltender interference, and the Devils went on a power play.</p>
        <p>Defenseman Scott Stevens's shot was blocked. So was a shot by right wing Alexander Mogilny. But the puck bounded to center Sergei Brylin in the left corner, and he spotted Mogilny free in the middle. After a quick pass, Mogilny had his third goal of the season.</p>
        <p>Early in the third period, Brodeur found himself looking down the barrel of a Pavel Bure breakaway. But the Panthers' right wing, whose 58 goals last season led the league, decided to shoot from 20 feet, and Brodeur smothered it.</p>
        <p>''The bounces tended to go my way tonight,'' Brodeur said.</p>
