        <p>Without missing a day, New York racing moved yesterday from Belmont Park to Aqueduct, where the meet will be conducted for the next six and a half months. Opening day belonged to a short favorite, Left Bank, who led all the way against only three rivals to capture the $100,000 Discovery Handicap for the fifth victory in his last six starts.</p>
        <p>Left Bank, a 3-year-old son of French Deputy owned by Michael Tabor and trained by Todd Pletcher, took the lead early and held it against some strong stalking from Open Sesame. At the finish, Left Bank had widened his lead to 2i lengths over Perfect Cat, who outdueled Open Sesame for second place by the length of his head.</p>

Opening day belonged to a short favorite, Left Bank, who led all the way against only three rivals to capture the $100,000 Discovery Handicap for the fifth victory in his last six starts.</p>
        <p>Left Bank, a 3-year-old son of French Deputy owned by Michael Tabor and trained by Todd Pletcher, took the lead early and held it against some strong stalking from Open Sesame. At the finish, Left Bank had widened his lead to 2i lengths over Perfect Cat, who outdueled Open Sesame for second place by the length of his head.</p>
        <p>Left Bank, ridden by John Velazquez, ran the mile and one-eighth in 1:471/5, paid $2.60 for a $2 bet to win, and earned $64,020.</p>
        <p>At Churchill Downs in Louisville, Ky., where many horses aiming for the Breeders' Cup have already arrived, Fusaichi Pegasus was reported healthy after a six-furlong workout Monday in 1:164/5. His trainer, Neil Drysdale, said the Kentucky Derby winner, who sustained a minor foot injury after winning the Jerome Handicap at Belmont last month, would have a more serious workout this weekend or early next week.</p>
        <p>Pegasus led a list of 135 horses who were pre-entered in the eight Breeders' Cup races on Nov. 4, along with Lemon Drop Kid, Albert the Great, Tiznow and Captain Steve, his chief rivals in the $4 million Classic.</p>
