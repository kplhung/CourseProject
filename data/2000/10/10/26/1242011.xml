        <p>Based on a few tips and heavy thumbsucking, here is a way to compare possible Bush and Gore administrations.</p>
        <p>For secretary of state, Al Gore is expected to choose Richard Holbrooke, the current U.N. delegate.  George W. Bush has hinted that Colin Powell would be his choice.</p>
        <p>But what if Powell prefers Health and Human Services, where his current interest lies? Then the Bush SecState would probably be Condoleezza Rice, now provost at Stanford. If Bush thought Rice better suited to be his national security adviser, he might pick Senator Richard Lugar. Meanwhile, Gore would back up Holbrooke at State with his national security adviser, Leon Fuerth.</p>
        <p>At Defense, President Gore might well sound out the Republican John McCain; he would probably decline, looking toward a presidential race in 2004. Gore might then turn to Representative John Murtha of Pennsylvania or former Senator Sam Nunn. President Bush might also choose Nunn, a Democrat, or turn to Paul Wolfowitz or Paul O'Neil.</p>
        <p>If Gore chose the former Texas governor Ann Richards for H.H.S., he could then break Clinton tradition and choose a male attorney general: Jack (Tell 'Em Nuthin') Quinn, a former White House counsel. George W.'s first choice to head Bush Justice would be John Danforth, the former Missouri senator.</p>
        <p>Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, hoping to be a Gore holdover, may think his competition is the current Fannie Mae chief, James Johnson. But a more intriguing Gore choice would be Bill Bradley, who demonstrated loyalty and has Senate Finance credentials. For Treasury in a Bush administration, PaineWebber's Don Marron has the inside track, though Representative Jennifer Dunn of Washington is in the running. Gore's chief economic adviser would be Alan Blinder, and Bush's is Lawrence Lindsey; both are former Federal Reservists.</p>
        <p>At Agriculture, Gore could fend off a possible conservative Democratic  revolt in the choice of House speaker, if Democrats win a majority, by picking the Texas ''blue dog'' leader, Representative Charles Stenholm. Bush will look toward Gov. Frank Keating of Oklahoma (a hawk on regulating hogs and poultry) and Senator Pat Roberts of Kansas.</p>
        <p>At Education, Gore would be torn between North Carolina's governor, Jim Hunt, and Representative Jesse Jackson Jr. of Illinois, whose father leads the liberal charge against Ralph Nader's surprising uprising. Bush could reach across party lines to pick the Democrat Gerhard Casper, Stanford's ex-president, or stick with Lynne Cheney, his vice president's better campaign half.</p>
        <p>Dick Cheney would have a cabinet pick, probably former Senator Alan Simpson of Wyoming, for Interior. Gore's Interior choice to tiptoe between development and environmental interests could be the New Mexico Representative Tom Udall (Stew's son and Mo's nephew) or Washington's governor, Gary Locke, a Chinese-American.</p>
        <p>At Labor, Gore entries are Donna Brazile, his campaign manager, and Representative Harold Ford Jr. of Tennessee. Some Bush people have their eye on the outgoing New Jersey governor, Christie Whitman.</p>
        <p>Commerce (or Trade Representative) for Bush: former Gov. Carroll Campbell of South Carolina, and Robert Hormats. For Gore: Tom Downey.</p>
        <p>Energy might see a Clinton holdover in Bill Richardson, a Hispanic.  Bush's energy secretary may be Representative J. C. Watts of Oklahoma, unless the G.O.P. holds the House and this black Republican moves up in the leadership.</p>
        <p>HUD: Gore would look at California's Norman Mineta, recently appointed to Commerce, while a Bush cabinet post will go to Stephen Goldsmith, ex-mayor of Indianapolis and a close adviser.</p>
        <p>At the C.I.A., with George Tenet becoming a diplomat, Gore could go for Warren Rudman; Bush could switch the F.B.I. director, Louis Freeh, to C.I.A. and replace him with the prosecutor Charles La Bella.</p>
        <p>Bush's White House chief of staff would be Dan Evans and his Counselor, Karen Hughes, with Karl Rove to the R.N.C. and manager Joe Allbaugh set free to earn a living. Gore's chief would be William Daley and his Counselor Frank Hunger, with Fred Meyer to the D.N.C.</p>
        <p>Bush's Mike Gerson or Gore's Eli Attey will draft the Inaugural Address. The other guy will go home and write a book.</p>
