        <p>Vice President Al Gore is showing considerable strength in Florida among elderly and independent voters and is seen as more likely than his opponent to reduce the cost of health care and prescription drugs and protect the environment, a New York Times/CBS News poll shows.</p>
        <p>This strength has enabled Mr. Gore to overcome the advantages Gov. George W. Bush was believed to have had here at the start of the campaign, and it has made the presidential race in this, the fourth largest state with 25 crucial electoral votes, breathtakingly close.</p>
        <p>The statewide poll of 637 registered voters taken by telephone Sunday through Tuesday found that Mr. Bush is seen as more likely than his opponent to lower taxes. But a large number of Florida voters doubted that either candidate would really cut taxes. And when the voters were asked what should be done with the federal budget surplus, cutting taxes lagged way behind strengthening Social Security and Medicare.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Bush embarked on his presidential campaign, he and his staff had high hopes of winning Florida, in part because his brother Jeb is a popular governor here. But through the summer, as Mr. Bush concentrated his time and advertising money on swing states in the Midwest, Mr. Gore made steady gains here with his emphasis on a broad plan for prescription drug coverage and his selection of Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut as a running mate.</p>
        <p>The poll also found that Mr. Bush was getting less of a lift than he had hoped from his brother.</p>
        <p>Among registered voters in Florida, the poll found Mr. Gore favored by 44 percent, Mr. Bush by 42 percent, Ralph Nader by 3 percent and Patrick J. Buchanan by 1 percent. Among those expected to vote, Mr. Gore was ahead of Mr. Bush 46 percent to 42 percent, with 3 percent for Mr. Nader and 1 percent for Mr. Buchanan.</p>
        <p>The margin of sampling error is plus or minus four percentage points, meaning that the race is essentially a dead heat.</p>
        <p>Recognizing the closeness of the race here, Mr. Bush has visited Florida about once a week since Labor Day and was here again today, campaigning with Senator John McCain of Arizona and Jeb Bush.</p>
        <p>In the race for Florida's open Senate seat, the poll found that the Democrat, Bill Nelson, the state insurance commissioner, had a seven-point advantage over his Republican opponent, Representative Bill McCollum, 40 percent to 33 percent. Willie Logan, an independent, had 7 percent. The winner will succeed Senator Connie Mack, a Republican, who is retiring after two terms.</p>
        <p>In the presidential contest here, ''the people who are really going to decide the outcome are the independents and the elderly,'' said Richard K. Scher, a political science professor at the University of Florida.</p>
        <p>About one-quarter of Florida's registered voters are 65 or older, but they are more apt than others to go to the polls. In typical Florida elections, a third of the voters are at least 65, and in the last election, 42 percent were 60 and older.</p>
        <p>The poll found that among likely voters in Florida 65 and over, Mr. Gore had a 10-point advantage. The two candidates are running basically even among likely voters who are under 65.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's strength among the elderly could be particularly important if the overall turnout is low on Nov. 7. Unlike most other states, Democrats benefit in Florida in presidential elections when the turnout is low, said Susan MacManus, a political scientist at the University of South Florida, because the elderly are more likely than others to vote Democratic and are such reliable voters.</p>
        <p>The Gore advantage among voters who think of themselves as independents was also striking. Nationally, polls show, Mr. Bush is about 10 points ahead among voters without strong party affiliation, but in Florida, Mr. Gore is more than 10 points ahead.</p>
        <p>The importance of independents in elections here can be seen in how Bill Clinton managed in 1996 to pick up many votes that had gone to Ross Perot in 1992.</p>
        <p>In 1992, President George Bush carried Florida. In 1996, Mr. Clinton won the state. The Republican candidate got essentially the same proportion of the vote, 41 percent for Mr. Bush in 1992 and 42 percent for Bob Dole in 1996. But Mr. Clinton's vote rose to 48 percent in 1996 from 39 percent in 1992. Mr. Clinton was able to accomplish that because he picked up the biggest share of the Perot vote, which was 20 percent in 1992 but only 9 percent in 1996.</p>
        <p>Not surprisingly, the poll found Mr. Gore strongest on the Gold Coast, the area along the southeastern shore from Miami north to Palm Beach. Many people in this area moved from the Northeast, especially from New York and New Jersey, and brought their liberal, Democratic politics with them. Democrats nearly always do well there.</p>
        <p>The voters are closely divided between Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush in the Tampa-St. Petersburg area, and Mr. Bush has a good lead in the rest of the state, the poll indicated.</p>
        <p>One source of Mr. Gore's strength is that a solid majority of voters said he could be expected to make health care affordable, protect the environment and reduce the price of prescription medicine. A majority of voters said Mr. Bush was not likely to accomplish each of these.</p>
        <p>Both candidates are viewed favorably by most Florida voters. What sets Mr. Bush apart from many other Republicans is that he is seen by as large a majority of voters as Mr. Gore as being someone who cares about the needs and problems of people like themselves.</p>
        <p>''I like the way Bush presents himself,'' said Bill Griffin, 37, a criminal investigator who lives in the West Palm Beach area, one of the poll's respondents who was interviewed after the poll was completed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's plan to allow workers to invest a portion of their Social Security taxes to create private retirement accounts received mixed reviews. Basically, most voters 44 and younger thought it was a good idea, and most older voters were uncomfortable with it.</p>
        <p>But there was little disagreement on a related point. About 9 of 10 voters said the government should have no responsibility to bail people out if they invested their Social Security money in the stock market and then lost it.</p>
        <p>When they were asked whether they would be influenced by the candidates' position on Social Security, about three-quarters of those questioned answered, ''It is important, but so are other issues.''</p>
        <p>As for Gov. Jeb Bush, about three-fifths of the voters said they approved of how he was handling his job, and twice as many said they held a positive view of him personally as said they had a negative opinion.</p>
        <p>But his popularity seems unlikely to help his brother much. More than fourth-fifths of the voters said their view of Jeb Bush would not affect how they voted for president.</p>
        <p>Roslyn Glatz, 65, a retired convenience store manager in Ocala, said she voted for Jeb Bush for governor but planned to vote for Mr. Gore for president. Jeb Bush ''was the best candidate at the time,'' she said, ''but I'm not going to judge Bush on his brother.''</p>
        <p>How the Poll Was Conducted</p>
        <p>The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll of Florida is based on telephone interviews conducted Oct. 22 through 24 with 816 adults throughout the state. Of those, 637 said they were registered to vote.</p>
        <p>The sample of telephone exchanges called was selected by a computer from a complete list of exchanges across the state. For each exchange, the telephone numbers were formed by random digits, thus permitting access to both listed and unlisted numbers. Within each household, one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the survey.</p>
        <p>The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines into the residence, and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to geographic region of the state, race, sex and age.</p>
        <p>In addition, the questions about voting preferences in the 2000 election for president and United States senator are based on the responses of ''likely voters,'' defined as a probable electorate in terms of intention to vote, interest in the campaign and past voting behavior.</p>
        <p>In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such samples will differ by no more than four percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all registered voters in Florida. For smaller subgroups, the potential sampling error is larger.</p>
        <p>In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll. Differences in the wording and order of questions, for instance, can lead to somewhat varying results.</p>
