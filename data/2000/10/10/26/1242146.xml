        <p>They tried to be patient, but yesterday, one day after losing for the fourthtime in five games, the Rangers decided they could afford to wait no longer. So they recalled the 22-year-old defenseman Mike Mottau from Hartford.</p>
        <p>Mottau is expected to make his National Hockey League debut tonight in Philadelphia against a Flyers team that defeated the Rangers, 5-4, Tuesday night, snapping a streak of seven games without a victory.</p>
        <p>Mottau won the Hobey Baker Award, hockey's equivalent of the Heisman Trophy, at Boston College last season. After sitting out the first two weeks of training camp in a contract dispute, he impressed the Rangers during the preseason.</p>
        <p>The Rangers wanted Mottau to serve an apprenticeship at Hartford. But after Vladimir Malakhov suffered a partly torn anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee in the Rangers' second game of the regular season, it was only a matter of time before Mottau got the call.</p>
        <p>''We were looking for somebody who can move the puck better than anybody else and we think Mike may be the guy,'' Coach Ron Low said yesterday.</p>
        <p>In seven games with Hartford, Mottau had a goal and seven returned to Hartford to open a roster spot for Mottau.</p>
