        <p>When Nelson Doubleday, a Mets co-owner, looks around Shea Stadium, he sees two decades of warm memories that he would like to preserve. To do this, Doubleday said last night, he would raise the field, change the seats, reconfigure the third tier and create a ring of bleachers beyond the outfield fence.</p>
        <p>''I don't think we should build a stadium,'' Doubleday said. ''I think we should just rebuild this. I don't see why the taxpayers should help us or buy us a new home. They did it once; let's fix it.''</p>

        <p>When Nelson Doubleday, a Mets co-owner, looks around Shea Stadium, he sees two decades of warm memories that he would like to preserve. To do this, Doubleday said last night, he would raise the field, change the seats, reconfigure the third tier and create a ring of bleachers beyond the outfield fence.</p>
        <p>''I don't think we should build a stadium,'' Doubleday said. ''I think we should just rebuild this. I don't see why the taxpayers should help us or buy us a new home. They did it once; let's fix it.''</p>
        <p>This is a drastically different view of the Mets' future from the one held by the team's other owner, Fred Wilpon. He has been working for years on a plan to build a 45,000-seat, retractable-roof ballpark in the Shea parking lot, and said he hoped a Subway Series could build momentum for that project.</p>
        <p>Doubleday, however, has no plans to support Wilpon, and last night he issued his strongest statements yet against using public money to finance a new park for the Mets. Wilpon has said public money is necessary for the project, which Doubleday suspects could cost $1 billion.</p>
        <p>''Before I go and cast my vote to build a new stadium, I would have to explore rebuilding this one from the ground up, using the existing pilings,'' Doubleday said. ''That's not an added expense, and that's solid as a rock.''</p>
        <p>Doubleday estimated that the Mets could renovate Shea for about $300 million, although he said there had been no formal study. He said that he has not discussed the idea with Wilpon, but that they will.</p>
        <p>''People think we don't talk,'' he said. ''That's not true at all.''</p>
