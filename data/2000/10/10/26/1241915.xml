        <p>FANS and foes of the Microsoft Corporation can certainly agree on one thing: Microsoft hates to lose. Whether competing for market share in Web browsers, handheld computers or corporate servers, Microsoft spends whatever years and dollars are necessary to produce the dominant product -- or at least the one with the most features.</p>
        <p>So it is easy to imagine the company's frustration when its Microsoft Network, the MSN online service, scarcely made a dent in the popularity of America Online, despite several revisions and years of marketing.</p>
        <p>Now Microsoft has changed its MSN strategy yet again, and this time it may have a winner. The company's MSN Explorer software for Windows, released today, packs all of the most interesting Internet features into a single, colorful, button-lined window: Web browsing, e-mail, chat rooms, instant messaging, a calendar, Web-site building, weather information, stock quotations and so on. Having a dashboard for the Internet spares you the trouble of setting up and learning individual programs for each of those functions.</p>
        <p>The concept is nothing new. In fact, for 23 million people, all-in-one Internet software is precisely the appeal of America Online. The twist is that MSN Explorer is free, and you can use it over any Internet connection. Of course, Microsoft would love for you to sign up for its MSN Internet Access service, but the software works no matter what service provider you're using.</p>
        <p>In fact, you can even use MSN Explorer with an America Online account. That is probably no coincidence; it's clear that the new program's designers worked by the motto ''Just like AOL, only better.'' For example, AOL lets you create accounts for seven family members, but MSN permits nine. The recording of AOL's Mr. Cheerful always says, ''Welcome!'' but MSN's perky female voice wishes you ''Good morning,'' ''Good afternoon'' or ''Good evening,'' as appropriate.</p>
        <p>Guest accounts let you check your AOL mail from any AOL-equipped computer, but in MSN Explorer, your list of Web site bookmarks and your ''buddy list'' follow you from PC to PC, too. More important, MSN Explorer's colorful, Macintosh-like graphics exploit the full screen, a welcome departure from AOL's gaggle of small overlapping windows.</p>
        <p>MSN Explorer's release date would seem to be no coincidence, either, coming the day after the release of America Online 6.0 for Windows. [News Watch, Page 3.]</p>
        <p>The My Radio button and a volume slider on MSN Explorer make it simple to switch on the Internet station of your choice. When you enter a chat room, you don't even have to bother; a music station called MSN Chat Radio automatically plays music geared to the room's topic. (A banner even identifies the song and artist.) As with movie soundtracks, Internet music makes a world of difference; once you have browsed to the strains of Bach, the Beatles or Britney Spears, you'll never go back.</p>
        <p>If your PC has speakers and a microphone, you're equipped for an even more dazzling feature: the Make a Phone Call command, which turns your PC into a speakerphone that makes free calls to any number in the United States or Canada. This arrangement is a vast improvement over the computer-to-computer calling software of yesteryear, which required that both parties arrange to be online at a specified time. Somehow, MSN Explorer actually rings the telephone on somebody's desk or kitchen counter.</p>
        <p>Internet calling is an almost-there technology. On some calls, sonic glitches and one-second delays after each utterance make conversations resemble a cell-phone call placed to Hungary while driving through a tunnel. (Hanging up and calling again often improves the situation.)</p>
        <p>The sound quality itself, however, is very good. On the best connections, the person you're talking to might never know about your cheapskate tendencies. With only a small amount of refinement, the computer-to-phone feature could be a perfectly satisfactory replacement for ordinary long-distance calling.</p>
        <p>Phone companies, which are potential MSN Explorer advertisers, have every right to be nervous about huge audiences catching on to free-calling technology. Maybe that is why Microsoft has made the phone feature less convenient than the other MSN Explorer features, hiding the command in an ''icon menu'' and forcing you to type out every phone number (instead of integrating the dialing feature with the MSN Explorer address book).</p>
        <p>Anyone can download individual programs that perform these stunts. (The phone software, for example, is free at www.net2phone.com.)  But with MSN Explorer they're built in, preconfigured and polished with a long list of thoughtful design touches.</p>
        <p>For example, digits appear on the E-Mail and Online Buddies toolbar buttons to indicate how many messages and friends are waiting online. If an instant-message partner seems to be taking a long time to reply, you no longer have to worry that you've said something offensive because a status bar reassures you that ''SkiBunny237 is typing a response right now.''</p>
        <p>And as you address an outgoing e-mail message, green icons in your address book identify anyone who is  online. That's a great feature; if you know your correspondent is online, you can get a more immediate response by sending an instant message instead of e-mail.</p>
        <p>So MSN Explorer is elegant, convenient and free. It's enough to make you wonder just what Microsoft is up to -- this is a company not known for initiatives that don't eventually lead to staggering profits. How is this going to benefit Microsoft?</p>
        <p>The first answer is advertising. The home page, the chat rooms and even the phone-dialing pad are plastered with ads. True, AOL teems with ads, too, but on MSN, most of them blink. It's like trying to read your e-mail in a disco.</p>
        <p>The second answer is Microsoft's burning ambition to own the Internet, recently christened the Microsoft .NET initiative. At every turn, MSN Explorer steers you to another Microsoft service. All of the toolbar icons (like My Car and My Travel) take you to Microsoft Web sites (like MSN Carpoint and Expedia). Worse, MSN Explorer can handle e-mail only from one of Microsoft's free e-mail services, Hotmail or MSN.net. (The program's impressively simple sign-up process offers to create such an account for you.) If you're already known to your friends as, say, bgates@anotherisp.net, you'll get nothing out of MSN Explorer's handsome e-mail module.</p>
        <p>It's easy to see how MSN Explorer fits into Microsoft's plan to sell  broadband (high-speed) Internet access, too. For example, MSN Explorer makes Internet movies, which  generally sputter over dial-up connections, especially attractive. Thanks to the incorporation of Windows Media Player, they play right in the MSN Explorer window without the aid of a downloaded ''helper'' program like RealPlayer. And MSN Explorer takes 30 seconds to start up after you dial in, but with a cable modem or D.S.L. connection, it's instantly ready to go.</p>
        <p>You can download MSN Explorer from explorer.msn.com, or you can just wait for it to come to you. Microsoft and the MSN Explorer advertisers plan to spend $1 billion on promotion and distribution. Soon enough, you'll find MSN Explorer CD's popping out of your mailbox, your morning newspaper and probably your kitchen faucet.</p>
        <p>The software will probably be adored by computer novices, families, current Hotmail or MSN account holders, and anyone else who would rather not configure a different program for every Internet feature. Anti-Microsoft curmudgeons and Internet power users, on the other hand, will certainly regard MSN Explorer with disdain. Still, even they should be grateful -- any time Microsoft makes clean, simple, foolproof software design its top priority, there's cause for celebration.</p>
