        <p>Re ''Geeks, Proud of the Name, Start a Volunteer Corps'' (Oct. 19): The article says that ''in August the Peace Corps began to include information technology among its specialties.'' I just returned in August from having served in the Peace Corps in Morocco for three years in a program called Information Resource Management. We were all professional librarians, and a good portion of the work I did was technology training and computer literacy.</p>

        <p>The Peace Corps began this program in Morocco in 1995. The program was designed originally to assist university librarians in Morocco with their libraries. It has since expanded its scope to include smaller community libraries. There have been 12 volunteers in this program so far.</p>
