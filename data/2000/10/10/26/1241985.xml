        <p>Promising ''a 21st-century solution to a very old social problem,'' the Brooklyn district attorney's office yesterday announced a pilot project to put photographs and videotape evidence of domestic violence crimes online in hopes of garnering more accurate evidence and resolving cases faster.</p>
        <p>The $500,000 project, based on a similar system in Largo, Fla., will give police officers in two Brooklyn precincts digital cameras and video recorders to photograph victims' injuries and record defendants' statements. The videotapes and photographs, along with copies of 911 calls and police reports, will be entered into a secure Web site, where judges, police officers and prosecutors will have immediate access to it.</p>

        <p>Promising ''a 21st-century solution to a very old social problem,'' the Brooklyn district attorney's office yesterday announced a pilot project to put photographs and videotape evidence of domestic violence crimes online in hopes of garnering more accurate evidence and resolving cases faster.</p>
        <p>The $500,000 project, based on a similar system in Largo, Fla., will give police officers in two Brooklyn precincts digital cameras and video recorders to photograph victims' injuries and record defendants' statements. The videotapes and photographs, along with copies of 911 calls and police reports, will be entered into a secure Web site, where judges, police officers and prosecutors will have immediate access to it.</p>
        <p>''There can be no greater impact on a judge and no greater asset to a prosecutor than the ability to introduce into evidence at an arraignment an actual photograph and audiotape of a victim of these senseless crimes,'' said Charles J. Hynes, the Brooklyn district attorney.</p>
        <p>Currently, it can take months for prosecutors to get copies of 911 tapes, said Lisa C. Smith, a Brooklyn Law School professor who helped spearhead the project. ''They're never available at the arraignment,'' she said. ''With the technology available to us today, it doesn't have to be that way.''</p>
        <p>Joseph P. Dunne, first deputy police commissioner, said that while homicides were down and arrests were up in recent years, domestic violence cases could be difficult to prosecute.</p>
        <p>''Often, after the incident, guilt takes over the victims'' and they change their minds about pursuing the case, Mr. Dunne said, adding that defense lawyers often delay cases in hope that evidence will be harder to track down. With the new system, he said, evidence will be immediately available and harder to dispute.</p>
        <p>Money for the pilot project will come from funds obtained by Councilman Kenneth K. Fisher and from the police department, the district attorney's office and the office of court administration. The funds will pay for additional 911 operators and for the creation of a Web site, as well as for laptop computers, software, and cameras in the 72nd Precinct in Sunset Park and the 67th Precinct in Flatbush. The project is to begin in February.</p>
