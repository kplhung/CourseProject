        <p>THE television series ''Star Trek Voyager'' seems an odd choice as the basis for an action game because there is little action on the show itself. Characters endlessly discuss what they should do and make speeches about what they will do but not much is ever actually done.</p>
        <p>Thank goodness, there is a little more happening in Star Trek: Voyager -- Elite Force, an Activision game that is as lively as the series is static.</p>
        <p>The game begins with the protagonist, Alex Munro, on a Borg starship. (You can choose to be either Alexander or Alexandra.) The Borg, for those of you who have somehow managed to steer clear of the ''Star Trek'' phenomenon, are a race of cyberhumans who devote their lives to making everyone else in the universe a cyberhuman, a process known as assimilation. After playing briefly, I realized that these Borg soldiers weren't up to assimilating anyone.</p>
        <p>I had initially set the game to easy mode, as I usually do, but this was a cakewalk. I think my cat could beat this game on the easy setting. Even on the medium setting, the game was not difficult. But I was regularly assimilated at the challenging level.</p>
        <p>After exiting the Borg ship in a rather surprising manner, you are confronted with an even bigger problem. The starship Voyager becomes ensnared in The Forge, a sort of roach motel for starships created by some mysterious alien race for some mysterious purpose. Once trapped, the Voyager is invaded by a pirate force made up of crew members from other stranded vessels, and Alex must join with his or her fellow crew members to fight them off.</p>
        <p>One of the notable aspects of Elite Force is its conceit that Alex is just one among many, rather than a lone hero. Most shooters are populated with hundreds of characters cloned from three or four originals, but Elite Force presents a large number of clearly differentiated individuals. Alex leads a team, and another team often works elsewhere on a separate aspect of the same mission. This is more a matter of the story than of actually playing the game.</p>
        <p>Alex's compatriots are ineffective in battle, and monsters will push past other crew members to get to Alex. At one point, while being attacked, I fell off a walkway to the floor below and looked up to see a monster and a crew member standing side by side, unmoving, waiting for my return. For all the teamwork trappings, Alex is the center of this universe.</p>
        <p>The creators of Elite Force have been keeping up with the latest gaming trends. As in Deus Ex, there is a combination of straight-out shooting, sneaking around and solving puzzles.</p>
        <p>Elite Force has the intelligence to take many of the best features from other games. As in Half-Life, medical kits and ammunition come in futuristic, strategically placed dispensers. They aren't strewn about as if you had been preceded in battle by a militaristic Santa Claus. As in Thief, you can sometimes sneak past your enemies. Although Elite Force is not as ground-breaking as those games, it is an interesting overview of current action game fashion.</p>
        <p>Where Elite Force falls short is in the intelligence bestowed upon Alex's enemies. Half-Life's marines hide behind crates and lob grenades at you, and Thief's guards call for reinforcements. In Elite Force, your adversaries just run at you, blasting away, and if you run into another room, they will often not even bother to follow.</p>
        <p>Alex's teammates are no smarter. They use weapons on their weakest settings and take no initiative when enemies attack. They regularly shout, ''Look out behind you,'' when there is nothing there. They are also pretty unfriendly. Try speaking to them and they will snarl, ''Can't you see I'm working?'' I guess being based on a poorly rated television series puts you on edge.</p>
        <p>With better artificial intelligence, Elite Force could have been a great game, and even with its dumb-as-dirt villains, there is still much to recommend it.</p>
        <p>The few puzzles in it are simple but unusually clever for this kind of game, although the player is given more hints than necessary. Low-gravity areas allow you to make tremendous leaps, and there are minitasks in which you can succeed or fail without affecting the game as a whole. At one point, you can save a friend from being assimilated by the Borg hordes if you are fast enough. It seems a pity that the bad guys are not as intelligent and ingenious as the game's designers.</p>
        <p>There are a few places where Elite Force suddenly becomes almost impossible. You are occasionally confronted by overwhelming forces or by a particularly powerful foe. Getting past these sections is a matter either of staying alive until reinforcements arrive or of figuring out a strategy for killing the monster. I would die within 10 seconds, wait for more than three minutes while the game reloaded the level, die again and continue thus for a half- hour until I finally figured out how to survive.</p>
        <p>For the final adversary -- a giant beast that can take an extraordinary amount of damage and can kill you in one shot -- I gave up and cheated, finding a game code that shielded me from harm while I stood in front of the monster and fired at it. Even then it took a very long time to kill it. Supervillains are a normal part of game play, but one likes to have a fighting chance without having to resort to cheat codes.</p>
        <p>For the five or six people who are still watching the series on television as it plays out its final season, Elite Force does capture the feeling of the show. All the main characters appear, some voiced by the original actors, including the helium-voiced Kate Mulgrew as Captain Kathryn Janeway. The tedious dialogue that makes the series the dullest of the ''Star Trek'' franchise appears as well, with long discussions on what to do next and a less-than-rousing ''let's give our all for the cause'' speech near the end.</p>
        <p>It is a kind of bone tossed to the fans, letting them know that no matter how fast and furious the action of the game, Star Trek Voyager is still in touch with its core audience: people who are very difficult to bore.</p>
        <p>Star Trek: Voyager -- Elite Force, developed by Raven Software and published by Activision for Windows 95 and 98; $45.99; for teenagers.</p>
