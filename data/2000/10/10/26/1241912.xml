        <p>Garth Fagan Dance opened its two-week season at the Joyce Theater on Tuesday night with a retrospective of sorts. The four dances suggested that Mr. Fagan has followed a surprisingly consistent artistic trajectory over the 30 years of his company's life, years that have included his ascension to Broadway as the choreographer of ''The Lion King.''</p>
        <p>The simple, direct jagged lines and peculiar configurations of the body that Mr. Fagan created for his untrained first dancers remain a central part of his work today. His new ''Trips and Trysts'' is as much a processional of fragmentary images as his 1981 ''Discipline Is Freedom,'' the oldest piece on the program. Unlike most dance, the moves are visible, but one seldom sees the path between them.</p>

        <p>Garth Fagan Dance opened its two-week season at the Joyce Theater on Tuesday night with a retrospective of sorts. The four dances suggested that Mr. Fagan has followed a surprisingly consistent artistic trajectory over the 30 years of his company's life, years that have included his ascension to Broadway as the choreographer of ''The Lion King.''</p>
        <p>The simple, direct jagged lines and peculiar configurations of the body that Mr. Fagan created for his untrained first dancers remain a central part of his work today. His new ''Trips and Trysts'' is as much a processional of fragmentary images as his 1981 ''Discipline Is Freedom,'' the oldest piece on the program. Unlike most dance, the moves are visible, but one seldom sees the path between them.</p>
        <p>A certain self-consciousness has necessarily crept in as Mr. Fagan's ad hoc choreography became a style. But his superb dancers -- who include Steve Humphrey, a charter company member who grew into burnished stardom -- have retained the simplicity and audience-enfolding warmth of the earliest company members.</p>
        <p>''Trips and Trysts,'' a world premiere that was the centerpiece of this first of three programs to be presented during the company's Joyce season, suggests the problems and possibilities of the style. Mr. Fagan's moves, shapes and hurtling stage crosses are too distinctive not to have become familiar from the two pieces that preceded the premiere. The many climaxes that build toward the expected ending suggest choreographic fatigue. But ''Trips and Trysts'' is a beautiful-looking piece.</p>
        <p>C. T. Oakes's lighting and the lame tops of Mary Nemecek Peterson's costumes give the 12 dancers something of the matte shimmer of the score by Wynton Marsalis. The experiences of watching and listening gradually merge, as if the dancers were musical instruments. Their directness and intensity occasionally give the choreography a nicely improvised look.</p>
        <p>Embedded in Mr. Marsalis's bright and bittersweet music, at once so brassy and so intimate, are approximations of the sounds of trains and city traffic. The taped score includes musicians' murmurs of ''all aboard,'' ''freight train'' and other travel phrases. Mr. Fagan has described both the new piece and his 1999 ''Woza,'' which ended the program, as dances about voyages.</p>
        <p>''Woza'' begins with what looks like a dancer's stretch session, turned into a wry tour de force of a solo by the glittering Sharon Skepple. The piece, which is set to lilting music by Lebo M, who contributed music to ''The Lion King,'' ends by catapulting the viewer onto a sunny African plain or village square, in a group celebration of explosive energy and immense charm. As much a stand-alone piece as a rousing finale, it has the feel and effect of a ''Revelations''-style hit for the company. The lead cast was completed by Norwood Pennewell and Natalie Rogers.</p>
        <p>The program, which included the poignant, elliptically anecdotal ''Easter Freeway Processional,'' will be repeated on Saturday night and Sunday afternoon. Garth Fagan Dance appears through Nov. 5 at the Joyce.</p>
