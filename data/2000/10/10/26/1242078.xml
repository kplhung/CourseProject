        <p>Not much time has elapsed since Timo Perez and Edgardo Alfonzo auditioned for their roles as the Mets' Dynamic Duo. In Game 4 of the National League Championship Series against St. Louis, Perez and Alfonzo, the first two batters in the lineup, drilled two of the five doubles the Mets hit in the first inning. In Game 5, they stroked successive singles in the first inning, propelling the Mets to a quick 3-0 lead.</p>
        <p>In the World Series, however, Perez and Alfonzo have become the Mets' Dynamic Duds. Each is hitting .125 with 2 hits in 16 at-bats.</p>

        <p>Not much time has elapsed since Timo Perez and Edgardo Alfonzo auditioned for their roles as the Mets' Dynamic Duo. In Game 4 of the National League Championship Series against St. Louis, Perez and Alfonzo, the first two batters in the lineup, drilled two of the five doubles the Mets hit in the first inning. In Game 5, they stroked successive singles in the first inning, propelling the Mets to a quick 3-0 lead.</p>
        <p>In the World Series, however, Perez and Alfonzo have become the Mets' Dynamic Duds. Each is hitting .125 with 2 hits in 16 at-bats.</p>
        <p>The Perez who showed up in the playoff series earlier this month, the one who was the team's offensive catalyst, resurfaced briefly last night, leading off the third inning with a single and scoring on Mike Piazza's home run. Alfonzo, however, failed to get a hit in three at-bats.</p>
        <p>Alfonzo could look across the diamond and take solace in the knowledge that Bernie Williams was having a worse World Series for the Yankees. Williams did not get a hit in four attempts, raising his hitless Series total to 15 at-bats.</p>
        <p>Williams, however, can derive consolation from the knowledge that his team won the game in spite of him, edging the Mets, 3-2, and moving one victory from securing the Yankees' third successive World Series championship and fourth in five Octobers.</p>
        <p>''I can't hit the ball,'' Alfonzo said. ''I picked a bad time to get a slump. I'm a little bit down. It's hard. I picked the wrong time to let my team down. I have to find it as soon as possible. I have to be positive.''</p>
        <p>Jay Payton, the Mets' center fielder, who had as many hits last night as Alfonzo has in the series, said that Alfonzo, in effect, is a marked man.</p>
        <p>''When you get in these type of games,'' Payton said, ''other teams are going to try not to let Mike Piazza and Edgardo Alfonzo beat them. He's not getting a lot of good pitches to hit, but he's up there trying to do something with them.''</p>
        <p>The Mets, in the same way, are making life difficult for Williams. But if the Yankees can win again tonight and end the Series, they can help Williams avert the embarrassing possibility of breaking the 32-year-old World Series record for futility. Dal Maxvill, Joe Torre's old teammate, didn't get a hit in 22 at-bats for St. Louis against Detroit in 1968.</p>
        <p>Other acts of hitting futility: Gil Hodges 0 for 21 for Brooklyn in 1952 and Dave Winfield 1 for 22 for the Yankees in 1981. Williams, however, is playing for a winner. Maxvill, Hodges and Winfield contributed to their teams' losses.</p>
        <p>''Alfonzo and Bernie are the best hitters in their lineup,'' Tony Bernazard said before last night's game. Bernazard is a former second baseman, who as an official of the players association, retains an intimate knowledge of major league hitters.</p>
        <p>''The one I'm surprised about is Alfonzo,'' he said. ''The last few games he's gotten out of his game. The Yankees are not going to pitch to him unless they have to. He's swinging at bad pitches. He's swinging like 'I've got to get a hit here.' ''</p>
        <p>By swinging at bad pitches, Bernazard said, Alfonzo was making the pitcher's job easier.</p>
        <p>''They don't have to throw him anything,'' Bernazard said. ''I believe that's part of the Yankees' plans: 'Don't throw anything until we have to. The guy's such a good hitter we're not going to let him beat us because he's the key hitter in their lineup.' You have Alfonzo and then Piazza. Alfonzo is a tougher guy to pitch to. He takes pitches, makes you throw six, seven, eight, nine pitches. He'll take you deep anywhere.''</p>
        <p>Both in last year's postseason and early in this year's, Alfonzo produced critical hits for the Mets. He began the 1999 playoffs by slashing a game-winning grand slam in the ninth inning against Arizona. In the second game against the Giants this year, he hit a key two-run home run in the ninth.</p>
        <p>But against the Yankees he has driven in only one run, on an infield single in Game 1. That is the only hit he has had with runners on base. He has made outs eight other times with a total of 10 runners on.</p>
        <p>''I think he's missed his pitch almost once an at-bat,'' Manager Bobby Valentine said. ''Possibly he's gotten a little frustrated with the fact that he didn't cash in when he had the opportunity. And I think he's expanded his zone just a little.''</p>
        <p>Perez has also been guilty of expanding his swinging zone.</p>
        <p>In the last two games of the league series against the Cardinals, the Mets scored in seven different innings. Perez was the first batter to reach base in five of those innings. He led the team in runs scored with 10 in the first two series. Last night marked the first time in this series that he has ignited a scoring inning.</p>
        <p>''He's anxious,'' Bernazard said. ''They're trying to make him swing at high pitches and he has been chasing high pitches. He hasn't been comfortable. His plan is not working. He thought it was going to be the same thing. He has to make adjustments, stay off the high pitches, hit the other way. The last at-bat last night he hit a line drive to left field. That was a good at-bat, but they have to come down. They came down to him that at-bat.''</p>
        <p>Asked before Game 4 if the Yankees were pitching him differently, Perez laughed and said in Spanish, ''Yes, they are.'' How has it been different? He held his hands about a foot apart, indicating that the Yankee pitchers are throwing the ball out of the strike zone.</p>
        <p>A member of the Yankees confirmed that the plan for Perez was to make him go after bad pitches, and Perez has been cooperating.</p>
        <p>Williams has been even weaker than Alfonzo and Perez, making outs with a total of 10 runners on base.</p>
        <p>''Bernie's a guy that you don't pitch to and they haven't,'' Bernazard said. ''He's chasing pitches. He's a guy if I'm doing a plan against him, I'm going to give him all different pitches to see if he chases them.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees would like to see Williams restrict his chasing to going after fly balls.</p>
