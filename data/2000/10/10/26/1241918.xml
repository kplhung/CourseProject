        <p>THE police in Utah have a new tool for solving cases of murder, missing persons and unidentified bodies: a Web site that provides statewide crime information for investigators and the public.</p>
        <p>''It's like crime-stoppers in cyberspace,'' said Mike King, chief of the criminal support unit of the Utah Attorney General's Office and the coordinator for the Web site of the Utah Criminal Tracking and Analysis Project, a group of crime experts.</p>
        <p>The site (www.utap.org) has a twofold purpose. Anyone with information about a crime can send it anonymously via e-mail, and investigators statewide can share data about similar crimes or people who are missing by posting reports about what has occurred in their areas.</p>
        <p>''An investigator in the southern part of our state, which is much more rural, might come across an unidentified body,'' Mr. King said, ''and he can go immediately to the Web site and hopefully see all of the missing people from the state. Or they might see a similarity between two cases, maybe a serial homicide.''</p>
        <p>Mr. King pointed out that he had noticed eerie similarities in the cases of two women who disappeared on the same date, but four years apart, in different parts of the state. ''See how they look alike, and notice those dates?'' he said.</p>
        <p>One woman, Peggy Sue Case, vanished from Spanish Forks on July 9, 1988, and the other, Debra Lee Frost of Salt Lake City, was last seen on July 9, 1984.</p>
        <p>''There may not be any connection,'' Mr. King said, ''but maybe no one noticed those similarities before their photos were there on the site, side by side almost.''</p>
        <p>Although Mr. King refused to divulge details of any open cases, he said that one 12-year-old homicide was on the verge of being solved as a result of e-mail received at the site.</p>
        <p>''The officer got an e-mail saying, 'I am the girlfriend of the person who committed this murder,' and they have since spoken,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. King acknowledged that e-mail was not entirely anonymous, but he said that the police did not intend to track down e-mail tipsters. ''There is the possibility they could be tracked down,'' he said, ''but officers have not gone out of their way to find out who that person sending the e-mail is.''</p>
        <p>And investigators are counting on the comfortable feeling of anonymity people get with e-mail. ''People can develop relationships and get married after meeting online,'' Mr. King said, ''so they must feel comfortable for some reason.''</p>
        <p>The Utah Criminal Tracking and Analysis Project was formed in 1997  to encourage cooperation among various law enforcement agencies. Mr. King said investigators in the state hoped to combine their resources and expertise for some cases to increase the odds of solving them.</p>
        <p>Members of the Utah Criminal Tracking and Analysis Project also meet with convicted criminals to learn more about how they select victims and commit crimes, and the group provides training seminars for police officers and investigators. The group is not involved in solving the cases posted on the Web, but instead serves as an intermediary for sharing information.</p>
        <p>Mr. King, who is paid by the Attorney General's Office to maintain the site, created the site by himself in one long weekend. ''After about six months of trying to get Webmasters,'' he said with a laugh, ''I gave up and bought a 'Web Design for Dummies' book, went home one weekend and learned how to do it. It seems to be working O.K.''</p>
        <p>So far the site has color pictures and statistical information for about 10 percent to 15 percent of the state's missing-person and unsolved homicide cases. Individual police departments must supply the site with crime data from their areas by filling out submission forms they can obtain on the site. The site has been up for about three months and has had more than 17,000 visitors.</p>
        <p>''It's hard to tell how successful it is,'' Mr. King said. ''One of the core missions is to provide this service without becoming involved in the investigations. The e-mails go directly to the investigators.''</p>
        <p>Mr. King said that he did not know of any other state or police agencies with similar sites and that he would like to see a multistate task force working together online.</p>
        <p>While the e-mail tips are welcomed, Mr. King said, old-fashioned police work is still the key to solving crimes.</p>
        <p>''I think the benefit goes a lot further than a hopeful e-mail of remembering a guy in a blue Chevy,'' he said. ''Hopefully this will help them triage the case and get lucky and solve the crime a little sooner.''</p>
