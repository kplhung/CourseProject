        <p>As the No. 7 train from Shea Stadium pulled out after Game 3 of the World Series, a chorus of fans groused about returning home at 1 a.m. yesterday after a 3-hour-39-minute Mets victory.</p>
        <p>The culprit they chose: Fox, which they blamed for starting the game at 8:35 p.m, for its commercial breaks, its greed and, well, network control over sports television.</p>
        <p>But their anger, at least for Tuesday night, was misguided. Major League Baseball asked Fox to delay the start of the game by about 15 minutes, to show player introductions, the national anthem and the first pitch ceremony involving the United States Olympic gold-medal softball and baseball teams.</p>
        <p>''Baseball asked us to do that once at Shea and once at Yankee Stadium,'' said Lou D'Ermilio, a spokesman for Fox Sports. Last night's game was to start by 8:20 p.m., but was delayed by 10 minutes.</p>
        <p>Expecting games much earlier than that? Start wishing for flannel uniforms and no blaring music between innings. Like other networks, Fox likes the 8 to 9 p.m. prime-time window; to start earlier would mean attracting fewer viewers over all, especially on the West Coast.</p>
        <p>And day games? Catch them in your Baby Boom reveries or on ESPN Classic.</p>
        <p>''If we wanted to maximize our ratings, we'd start at 9 o'clock like the N.B.A. finals, the N.C.A.A. championship game and 'Monday Night Football,' '' D'Ermilio said. While those events usually end in three hours or so, baseball doesn't; but baseball is scorned more for starting between 8 and 9 p.m. than the N.B.A. and N.C.A.A. are for starting at 9:20.</p>
        <p>If baseball demanded that Fox, or any of its previous network partners, carry the World Series partly under the sun, it would get less cash. But be assured that baseball would not risk a cent of its new, six-year $2.5 billion deal with Fox to satisfy the autumnal needs of fans asleep by 11:30.</p>
        <p>Fox wants to win prime time during its World Series telecasts, which would be less likely if it began games at 7 or earlier. While the Subway Series is elevating Fox in prime time, the ratings for the Series are unimpressive. Game 3 generated a 12.4 Nielsen rating, down 26 percent from Game 3 last year. The three-game 12.1 average is down 21 percent from last year's 15.4. (Each rating point equals about 1.02 million television households.)</p>
        <p>The hallmark of a Fox baseball telecast is an attempt to rid a slow-moving game of dead time. Game 3 was no different. One of the fascinating things to examine is the use of the closeup. Fox speaks baseball in the language of the closeup, sometimes telling the story of a play only in faces. In Game 3, Fox showed 805 closeups, some so tight you could see Armando Benitez's mismatched frown lines or John Franco's freckles, some that showed Mets and Yankees from the waist up. At times, a viewer had to wonder if the players and managers actually had feet.</p>
        <p>Part of the Fox philosophy is to avoid long, static shot, or even the classic establishing shot of the diamond, and to relate the game story in closeups, fast-cut directions and replays (219 in Game 3).</p>
        <p>Not so long ago, the high home plate shot occasionally set up a play, to see runners move off bases or fielders get into position. Not so with Fox, even when the Mets loaded the bases in the sixth inning of Game 3. Fox used a shot of the full diamond only 11 times on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Looking back on the telecast of Game 1 of the 1988 World Series -- which a gimpy Kirk Gibson won for the Dodgers on a pinch-hit home run -- NBC used that high home-plate shot eight times in the first inning alone, including three times to show pitches thrown. ''We think that pullback shot is boring,'' D'Ermilio said. ''We want to quicken the pace.''</p>
        <p>At their best, closeups illuminate action and heighten tension, but you have to wonder if 73 closeups during the Mets' half of the sixth inning could have been reduced for more long views.</p>
        <p>Besides, a lot of the closeups are of little consequence. Yankee Manager Joe Torre, seen 37 times in closeup, rarely gets more animated than when he sips from a paper cup.</p>
        <p>It may be time to use the zoom lens less and show the diamond a little more.</p>
