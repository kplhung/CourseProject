        <p>America Online's 23 million members may now download service's new program, AOL version 6.0 for Windows (M)</p>

        <p>If this is October, there must be a new America Online. AOL 6.0 for Windows became available yesterday for downloading by the service's 23 million members. (A Macintosh version is scheduled for next year.) The new software offers a long list of tiny improvements, a reworked toolbar and progress toward the company's goal of offering its members all AOL, all the time.</p>
        <p>Many of the smaller enhancements improve the e-mail and instant-messaging features. Now, for example, you can sort your e-mail by date, sender or subject, and the program offers to complete an address that you begin typing in the To box. You can send smiley faces in instant messages now, too -- not the feeble colon-and-parenthesis affair of AOL 5.0, but an actual yellow graphic (or any of several other icons.)</p>

        <p>If this is October, there must be a new America Online. AOL 6.0 for Windows became available yesterday for downloading by the service's 23 million members. (A Macintosh version is scheduled for next year.) The new software offers a long list of tiny improvements, a reworked toolbar and progress toward the company's goal of offering its members all AOL, all the time.</p>
        <p>Many of the smaller enhancements improve the e-mail and instant-messaging features. Now, for example, you can sort your e-mail by date, sender or subject, and the program offers to complete an address that you begin typing in the To box. You can send smiley faces in instant messages now, too -- not the feeble colon-and-parenthesis affair of AOL 5.0, but an actual yellow graphic (or any of several other icons.)</p>
        <p>AOL 6.0 offers a built-in media player, too. When you click on a music or video link on the Web, a CD player-style window opens automatically, saving you the trouble of downloading and configuring plug-ins like RealPlayer and Flash. And if you have a high-speed Internet connection, a special window called AOL Plus appears automatically to offer you links to news and sports video clips.</p>
        <p>Finally, AOL 6.0 lays the groundwork for two initiatives that are very important to the company. First is AOL by Phone, a toll-free number featuring a synthesized voice that does its best to read your e-mail, stock quotations and news snippets. (This service is free until February, and $5 per month thereafter).</p>
        <p>The second service, which was introduced gradually over the past year, is AOL Anywhere, which lets you check your AOL mail from any computer (via a Web site) or any Internet-enabled cell phone or palmtop. ''We believe that the last 10 years have been a dress rehearsal for the main Internet show,'' said Jonathan Sacks, senior vice president and general manager of the AOL service. ''In the future, you're not going to think about being on or off the Internet; you're going to think about the AOL features wherever you are, as you're driving down the street, riding the bus or moving from one room to another. That's where we're headed as a company.''</p>
