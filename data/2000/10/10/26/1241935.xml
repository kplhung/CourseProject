        <p>In an expansion designed to more than triple its exhibition and teaching space, the Museum of Jewish Heritage: A Living Memorial to the Holocaust breaks ground today for a new wing at Battery Park City, across New York Harbor from the Statue of Liberty.</p>
        <p>The three-year, $60 million project provides for a curved building of 70,000 square feet to be attached to the existing structure, which is a 30,000-square-foot hexagon with a tiered roof, symbolizing the six-pointed Star of David and the six million Jews killed under the Nazis.</p>

        <p>In an expansion designed to more than triple its exhibition and teaching space, the Museum of Jewish Heritage: A Living Memorial to the Holocaust breaks ground today for a new wing at Battery Park City, across New York Harbor from the Statue of Liberty.</p>
        <p>The three-year, $60 million project provides for a curved building of 70,000 square feet to be attached to the existing structure, which is a 30,000-square-foot hexagon with a tiered roof, symbolizing the six-pointed Star of David and the six million Jews killed under the Nazis.</p>
        <p>The new east wing, designed by Kevin Roche John Dinkeloo &amp; Associates, will contain classrooms, a theater, galleries and a Family History Center with testimony from Holocaust survivors compiled by Steven Spielberg's Shoah Foundation.</p>
        <p>Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney and the chairman of the museum, said the expansion would enhance a mission of depicting Jewish life before and after the Holocaust as well as in its darkest hour. ''These were real people,'' he said, ''so when you see them later shown in rags, you know who they are.''</p>
        <p>''The people with firsthand knowledge of the concentration camps and life under the German boot are dying off so the story has to be documented and told now,'' said Mr. Morgenthau, who is to lead the 11 a.m. groundbreaking with Gov. George E. Pataki, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, Senator Charles E. Schumer and other officials.</p>
        <p>The museum opened in September 1997, lacking many of the amenities now being provided, Mr. Morgenthau said. Planned after the stock market plunge of 1987, the museum had difficulty collecting pledges from some major benefactors, he said. In addition to the new exhibit and classroom space, the new wing, to be completed in 2003, will include a memorial garden overlooking the harbor, cafe and catering facilities and offices for museum staff, who are now housed off the premises.</p>
        <p>Of the $60 million cost, at least $22 million will come from the New York City budget, with $5 million more pledged by the City Council, officials said. The State Assembly and Governor Pataki's office will provide additional amounts, with the remainder coming from private donations.</p>
        <p>In a second major expansion of a leading Jewish cultural institution to be celebrated today, the Center for Jewish History formally opens a new complex combining five institutes of scholarship, history and art at 15 West 16th Street.</p>
        <p>Six years in planning and construction at a cost of $52 million, the new center of 125,000 square feet was created from two new buildings and four existing buildings and will bring under one roof major archives of the American Jewish Historical Society, the American Sephardi Federation, the Leo Baeck Institute, the Yeshiva University Museum and the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research.</p>
        <p>In all, the collections, which began opening to the public this spring, offer access to 100 million documents, 500,000 books and tens of thousands of art objects. In addition, the Jewish Genealogy Society of New York is to move into the complex to create the Center Genealogy Institute, which organizers say will be the foremost center for Jewish family research in the United States.</p>
        <p>Lois Cronholm, vice president and director of the center and a former provost and interim president of Baruch College of the City University of New York, said that the joint enterprise ''represents a giant step forward in Judaic studies.'' She called the collections ''the largest resource in the U.S. for the study of Jewish history.''</p>
        <p>''As the Jews for a variety of reasons settled in various parts of the world,'' Dr. Cronholm said, ''each country developed its own resources.'' YIVO, founded in 1925 in Vilna, now Vilnius, Lithuania, collects the history of Eastern European Jews; the Baeck Institute, founded in 1955, preserves the history of German-speaking Jews; the Sephardi Federation, founded in 1984, documents the history of Jews from the Middle East and North Africa; the American Jewish Historical Society goes back to 1892; and the Yeshiva museum has been on the campus of Yeshiva University in Washington Heights since 1973.</p>
        <p>A central reading room offers access to open and closed book stacks. There is a kosher cafe and a 247-seat auditorium. Programs include Yiddish theater and movies and a variety of Jewish music, from avant-garde jazz and klezmer hybrids to  mystical songs.</p>
