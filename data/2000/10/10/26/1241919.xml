        <p>THE main difference between Pavlov's dog and me is that the dog did not have a customer password at Amazon.com. I, on the other hand, have been conditioned by dozens of comforting visits to Amazon, where I am reliably greeted with a familiar salutation: ''Hello, M. Slatalla. We have recommendations for you.''</p>
        <p>As Amazon.com gently, painlessly leads me through the process of filling my shopping cart with books for my daughters, I enjoy a nice guiltless sensation of accomplishing something at my computer without actually doing any work on it.</p>
        <p>Lulled into complacency by years of low prices, I usually click on the reassuring blue box that says, ''Place your order,'' usually without bothering to scroll down to view my total (or even wondering why the page design requires me to maximize the browser window if I want to see the total without scrolling).</p>
        <p>A few weeks ago, everything was going smoothly in our codependent relationship, and I had managed to make Amazon into an enabler for my procrastination scheme by lingering for nearly a half hour on some of the site's reviews. I was about to complete my order when one of the cats jumped up on the desk and hit the mouse. Inadvertently, I saw the total and was shocked: $75.78 for five titles, and one was a paperback.</p>
        <p>Although I had been dimly aware of booksellers' decisions during the past few months to end the trend of deeply discounting books, (reading the newspaper cover to cover is another valuable tool available to the dedicated procrastinator), the $75.78 shocker was the first evidence that my own pocketbook was threatened.</p>
        <p>So I hit the Back button to investigate and learned that instead of the 30 percent hardcover discounts and 20 percent trade paperback discounts that Amazon used to offer routinely, each of the books in my shopping basket had been discounted a mere 10 percent. A quick review of  previous orders confirmed my fears: Amazon was selling many of the books I had bought in previous months at higher prices.</p>
        <p>For instance, ''Skellig,'' described on the site as a novel for children about ''the man-owl-angel in the abandoned garage,'' had been a fanciful risk at $11.17 last November when I bought it. But at Amazon.com's current price of $14.35? I'd be asking the tough questions: how does a manimal eat, anyway (can he/it hold a fork with his/its wings)? I put my order on hold and decided to shop around online for a better deal.</p>
        <p>First, I tested three search engines that compare book prices. Add all.com (www.addall.com), Bestbookbuys.com (www.bestbookbuys .com) and Isbn.nu (www.isbn.nu). At each, I typed keywords from the impossibly long title (the subtitle alone has 14 words) ''The Diary of Melanie Martin or How I Survived Matt the Brat, Michelangelo, and the Leaning Tower of Pizza.'' On Amazon.com, the hardcover had a list price of $15.95 and was selling for $14.35.</p>
        <p>The three sites, which search dozens of online booksellers and offer various features that will compute add-ons like shipping costs and sales tax (if applicable), informed me that the book was available at lower prices at Ecampus.com, 1Bookstreet.com and Fatbrain.com.</p>
        <p>In some cases, the sites returned slightly different prices for a single bookseller. One site took into consideration a coupon or special offer that another didn't offer, and databases may be updated at different times, so it is best to confirm a price at a bookseller's site. The lowest price for the Melanie Martin title was $12.72 at Ecampus.com, reported by Addall.com. If I wanted a used copy, it was available in hardcover for as little as $10.92 on Half.com.</p>
        <p>Encouraged, I conducted price searches for the four other books I wanted to buy. That's when I realized there's no easy answer when it comes to finding the best deal: no single bookseller consistently offers the best deal. Depending on what you want to buy and when, you must shop around.</p>
        <p>That's because each bookseller has idiosyncratic discounting schemes and different shipping rates and taxes, which may affect the total price. For instance, although Barnesandnoble.com offers better discounts on many books than Amazon.com, I rarely order from that site because I live in New York, one of five states in which Barnesandnoble.com has either its headquarters or a distribution or technology center and therefore charges sales tax (the others are New Jersey, Tennessee, Nevada and Virginia).</p>
        <p>Also, shipping charges can be the decisive factor in determining price. If you are ordering a single paperback copy of a children's title like ''Private and Personal: Questions and Answers for Girls Only'' for $8.95 from Amazon.com, the $4.48 in shipping charges will add a surcharge of about 50 percent. But if you ordered the same book from 1Bookstreet.com, you would get free shipping. (If you are placing a larger order of $50 or more, Powells.com offers free shipping, which suddenly makes its prices seem more competitive.)</p>
        <p>None of the three book search sites allowed me to calculate prices and shipping charges for multiple titles simultaneously. The creator of Isbn.nu, Glenn Fleishman, a writer and consultant who has contributed to Circuits, said he planned to add a ''comparison basket'' feature to the site next month that should eliminate such frustrations. In the meantime, I had to make my own chart to keep track of the five titles I wanted and calculate which seller offered the best discount.</p>
        <p>After about a half-hour of searching, I ordered the books from 1Bookstreet.com, based in Ukiah, Calif., which typically discounts hardcover books by 15 percent and paperbacks by 10 percent. My total was $64.12, a savings of more than 15 percent off Amazon.com's $75.78.</p>
        <p>Within minutes I received e-mail from 1Bookstreet.com confirming the order. I felt smug. For a few days. But after about a week, I started to wonder where my books were. After all, Amazon.com had conditioned me to expect prompt arrival, usually within three days of placing an order.</p>
        <p>That's when I discovered a statement in 1Bookstreet.com's e-mail confirmation that I had overlooked: ''Transit time to the East Coast is about 14 days.''</p>
        <p>When I phoned Ray Manley, 1Bookstreet.com's vice president for marketing, he said: ''It will take longer to get books from us because we are shipping them through the U.S. mail at book rate. It's a good deal if you don't care if you start reading a book tomorrow or a week from Monday and figure why not save the money on the shipping.''</p>
        <p>In the end, I waited 17 days for my order to arrive. Even Pavlov didn't take that long to feed his dogs.</p>
        <p>Would I order from 1Bookstreet.com again? Sure. In fact, I did. Last week. But if I had an urgent hankering for a good man-owl-angel read? When it comes to shipping, I know that Amazon.com would not procrastinate.</p>
