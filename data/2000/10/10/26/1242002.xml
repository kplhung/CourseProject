        <p>If you squinted over Paul O'Neill's shoulder, past Todd Pratt and around the home plate umpire, you might have seen John W. Henry Saturday night in Yankee Stadium. Mr. Henry, a genial and soft-spoken man of 51, is a farmer's son living in a field of dreams.</p>
        <p>First, the good dreams. Mr. Henry owns one major league team, the Florida Marlins, and has a minority stake in the New York Yankees. His four seats in Yankee Stadium are next to the opposing dugout, close enough to get him a piece of the bat that shall go down in infamy, at least for Mets fans. (For the record, a bat boy actually gave a piece of the bat to a Merrill Lynch executive who was a guest of Mr. Henry. It was the middle of the bat Mike Piazza shattered in Game Two, not the top shard that Roger Clemens tossed Piazza's way.)</p>

        <p>If you squinted over Paul O'Neill's shoulder, past Todd Pratt and around the home plate umpire, you might have seen John W. Henry Saturday night in Yankee Stadium. Mr. Henry, a genial and soft-spoken man of 51, is a farmer's son living in a field of dreams.</p>
        <p>First, the good dreams. Mr. Henry owns one major league team, the Florida Marlins, and has a minority stake in the New York Yankees. His four seats in Yankee Stadium are next to the opposing dugout, close enough to get him a piece of the bat that shall go down in infamy, at least for Mets fans. (For the record, a bat boy actually gave a piece of the bat to a Merrill Lynch executive who was a guest of Mr. Henry. It was the middle of the bat Mike Piazza shattered in Game Two, not the top shard that Roger Clemens tossed Piazza's way.)</p>
        <p>Then there are the bad dreams -- the market. Since the middle of last year, it has been a nightmare for Mr. Henry, the manager of his own investment company, John W. Henry &amp; Company, based in Boca Raton, Fla. The Financial and Metals Portfolio, one of his largest and most aggressive funds, fell 18.7 percent last year and is down 17.4 percent this year. And thanks to that performance and investors' withdrawal of funds, the assets of his investment group have been sliced from $2.4 billion a year ago to about $1 billion today.</p>
        <p>Recently, Mr. Henry significantly reduced the fees he charges and announced a plan to consolidate his operations by shutting his firm's second office, in Westport, Conn.</p>
        <p>Mr. Henry and professional investors like him use complex systems and formulas to trade futures contracts, which promise the delivery of an asset like a commodity or a stock index on a future date at a set price. Futures contracts become more or less valuable when the value of the underlying asset -- for example, the stock index or the commodity -- changes.</p>
        <p>Managed futures money managers like Mr. Henry follow trends in the global market, looking for price discrepancies that they can take advantage of -- fluctuations in the euro, in the price of oil or in interest rates. But until the Middle East crisis and the spike in oil prices, there were few global upsets like the Asian crisis of 1998 for these money managers the last few years.</p>
        <p>Shifting global economic conditions and bad bets on such trends have burned many prominent money managers recently. The roster of pain includes two of the world's most prominent hedge fund managers: this year, Julian H. Robertson Jr. shuttered his Tiger Investment empire and George Soros sharply scaled back his operations.</p>
        <p>But while Mr. Soros and Mr. Robertson manage hedge funds, investment funds that cater to the wealthy, managed futures funds such as Mr. Henry's have investment minimums that can be as low as mutual funds'. One of Mr. Henry's funds has been available through Merrill Lynch, so some average investors are experiencing his troubles up close.</p>
        <p>Though Mr. Henry and other managed futures managers use a different approach from Mr. Soros and Mr. Robertson, some of the same trends have hurt them all.</p>
        <p>The managed futures industry has been ''battered almost beyond recognition in the past couple years,'' said Barry Colvin, chief operating officer of Tremont Advisers, a hedge fund consulting firm.</p>
        <p>''These kinds of fund managers need turmoil. They need global macroeconomic volatility,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Managed futures is a particularly volatile area of fund management. But in a field where money managers frequently go under, Mr. Henry is known as a survivor. Despite his firm's record this year, his Financial and Metals fund has returned 28 percent, on average, every year since its inception in October 1982, well ahead of the 17.7 percent annual gain of the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index over the same period.</p>
        <p>Still, while technology investors enjoyed unmatched gains last year,  Mr. Henry and others in the managed futures industry suffered.</p>
        <p>''Over the last three years, you could argue that this industry has no place in anyone's portfolio,'' Mr. Henry said. But that proves nothing about the future, he argued. ''Things are dynamic,'' Mr. Henry said. ''What did work for the last couple years is not necessarily where you want to be the next three years.''</p>
        <p>October has been a relatively encouraging month for his funds' performance. Surging oil prices, tensions in the Middle East and the continuing slide of technology stocks have all contributed to a rebound for Mr. Henry's funds. His Financial and Metals fund was up 11.6 percent for October, as of Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Henry's introduction to futures was something of a crash course. When he was 25, his father died, and he took over his family's 2,000-acre farm, which was mostly in  Arkansas, and taught himself hedging techniques. As he learned how to market his crops and protect against weather and price fluctuations, he had a few lucky early trades and decided to make futures his business instead of farming.</p>
        <p>His love of baseball goes back further.</p>
        <p>''I grew up listening to Harry Caray,'' the legendary announcer, he said.</p>
        <p>''My father had a brain tumor when I was 8 years old and he was taken to the hospital in St. Louis,'' he added. ''The St. Louis coach was staying at the same hotel where we were staying and heard the story and heard I was just a complete fan, knew all the statistics, so he offered me his seats.''</p>
        <p>''I sat through a doubleheader one day that week and ended up in the same hospital as my father,'' he remembered. ''I had heat stroke -- St. Louis in the summer,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''It was just magical,'' he added. ''I'd been listening on the radio but I'd never seen a game. So my ambition in life became to move to St. Louis someday and get a job that would enable me to afford season tickets so I could go to 80 games a year.''</p>
        <p>He got his season tickets -- albeit to the Yankees -- when he bought 1 percent of the team in 1991. But his ultimate dream -- to own a team -- came true when he bought the Marlins in January 1999 for $150 million.</p>
        <p>Major League Baseball rules stipulate that one cannot own one team and have a stake in another. Since he bought the Marlins, Mr. Henry has promised to sell his Yankees stake a few times, but he has yet to part with it. Is there a deadline for divesting himself of the Bronx bombers and the ringside seats?</p>
        <p>''I think I've passed that,'' he admits. ''Something will probably get done in 2001.''</p>
        <p>One thing is certain. As performance goes, the Yankees sure beat the futures market.</p>
        <p>''As long as they send me a ring every year,'' said Mr. Henry, ''I can't complain.''</p>
