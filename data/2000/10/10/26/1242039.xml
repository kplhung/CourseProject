        <p>A Westchester County doctor who has been accused of trying to abort a pregnant nurse's baby by injecting her with a labor-inducing drug plans to argue that he was mentally unbalanced at the time, a lawyer for the doctor said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The doctor, Stephen Pack of Chappaqua, N.Y., was acting in a manner that was ''obviously irrational'' when he attacked the nurse in April with two hypodermic needles, said  his lawyer, Andrew Rubin.</p>
        <p>''It was not the behavior of someone acting in his right mind,'' Mr. Rubin said.</p>
        <p>Both Dr. Pack and the nurse, Joy Schepis, worked at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx. Hospital employees told investigators that the two had been romantically involved for more than a year before the attack on April 14.</p>
        <p>Dr. Pack accosted Ms. Schepis at 8 p.m. outside the hospital and plunged the syringes once into her buttocks and five times into her thigh, the police and prosecutors said.</p>
        <p>The syringes contained methotrexate, a drug used to terminate early pregnancies. It works in a manner similar to the abortion drug known as RU-486.</p>
        <p>According to court records, Dr. Peck yelled, ''I'm going to give you an abortion'' even as he tried to stab Ms. Schepis in the stomach with two syringes containing the drug.</p>
        <p>Subsequent stab wounds to the thigh and buttocks resulted in ''bleeding and severe puncture wounds'' that caused Ms. Schepis ''substantial pain and suffering,'' the records say.</p>
        <p>Ms. Schepis later underwent treatment to counteract the drug, which can cause birth defects.</p>
        <p>After the attack, the doctor fled into nearby North Central Bronx Hospital, where he was arrested by officers from that hospital's security force. Police officers recovered the two syringes, each labeled with the Montefiore name, from a medical waste container at North Central Bronx Hospital.</p>
        <p>Dr. Pack was indicted in May on two counts of second-degree assault and one count of second-degree abortion.</p>
        <p>Dr. Pack has not denied that he stabbed Ms. Schepis, who worked in the pediatric emergency department at Montefiore. But the motivation for his actions and whether he had full command of his mental faculties are apparently in question. After the incident, the doctor underwent psychiatric treatment at a White Plains hospital.</p>
        <p>''We indicated there was a psychiatric defense in the case,'' Mr. Rubin said yesterday. ''The case is going to hinge on what was his state of mind.''</p>
        <p>Steven Reed, a spokesman for the district attorney's office, would not comment on the possibility of a psychiatric defense. ''We try cases in court,'' he said. A trial date has not been set, and Mr. Rubin has filed a motion to dismiss the indictment based on arguments that the stabbing did not cause sufficient physical injury and that the doctor did not intend to harm Ms. Schepis.</p>
        <p>The district attorney's office has contended that the doctor, who is married and has two children, became angry when Ms. Schepis told him that she was pregnant and wanted to keep the baby.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rubin did not deny that his client had been involved in a romantic relationship with Ms. Schepis. He said simply, ''The facts of the incident itself happened as they did.''</p>
