        <p>All of his nervous twitches and cartoonlike expressions aside, Al Leiter has repeatedly stood on the mound under the pressure of a postseason game, calmly reached back and thrown pitches that bent like question marks in front of one befuddled batter after another.</p>
        <p>But perhaps more baffling, he has yet to register a postseason victory in 10 starts. The 35-year-old pitcher has been teased many times, nuzzling up to victory only to be turned down in the end.</p>
        <p>Often, the situation has been out of his hands, as it was in Game 1 of the World Series. On Saturday night, he pitched seven innings, gave up two runs and five hits, and saw Mets closer Armando Benitez squander a 3-2 lead in the ninth inning. That was the third time since Benitez arrived in New York in 1999 that Leiter had lost a lead in a postseason game he could have won.</p>
        <p>Tonight, Leiter will try to repeat the kind of tunnel vision he had against the Yankees in Game 1, and everything will be on the line. If Leiter can hold the Yankees down, maybe even get that first postseason victory, then the Series will move back to Yankee Stadium for Game 6, and the Mets will get one more crack at Roger Clemens.</p>
        <p>''I couldn't care less,'' Leiter said before Game 4 when asked about his bad luck in the postseason. ''I know in my heart that I've thrown well enough to have a win next to my name, but I would far rather have a winning team and a championship than a great postseason record and no championship. It's such a selfless time of the year.''</p>
        <p>At least on the surface, Leiter  takes solace in the quality of the pitching he has displayed -- and in the law of averages.</p>
        <p>''It seems like it would work in our favor,'' Manager Bobby Valentine said after the Mets took batting practice last night. ''The odds will be with us for him to get a win. I think Al has been here. He understands the situation and the preparation. I just got through talking to him on the field. I think he's mentally and physically ready. That's all you hope for.''</p>
