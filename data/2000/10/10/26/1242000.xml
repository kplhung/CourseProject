        <p>When Kim Il Sung, the father of the current leader of North Korea, founded the Communist Party here in the 1940's, educated North Koreans say that he had an uncommon piece of wisdom. Unlike the Russians and the Chinese, they say, Mr. Kim respected intellectuals and embraced them as true members of the North Korean party.</p>
        <p>Thus, the symbol of the party here is not just a hammer and a sickle, but also a paintbrush that appears on posters and badges between the two worker's tools.</p>
        <p>Several young men who proudly described this to Western reporters called themselves ''intellectuals,'' meaning they had gone to a university. They were assigned to baby-sit the Americans so that they would not stray beyond the official program of this week's visit by Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright. Their common attribute, aside from fealty to the ''Dear Leader,'' Kim Jong Il, was their ability to speak English.</p>
        <p>One of the men, a Mr. Li, 29, was single and lived at home with his parents. ''Miss Right has not come along,'' he explained, using his very colloquial and fluent English.</p>
        <p>A university English teacher, Mr. Li, who has never set foot outside North Korea, said he used American movies and books to encourage his students to learn English as it is spoken. He knew the story lines of Dustin Hoffman's movies by heart: ''Hero,'' ''Kramer vs. Kramer,'' ''Rain Man'' were among his favorites. John Grisham and Sidney Sheldon novels were among his basic texts. Combined with this seeming flair for American culture and an ability to crack jokes at his own expense, Mr. Li became almost childlike when it came to describing the Dear Leader. Recently, he said, he had proudly joined tens of thousands of others waving a pink pompom during a mass demonstration in honor of the leader.</p>
        <p>Ghost Town of 2 Million</p>
        <p>Where are all the people? Pyongyang, the showcase of the country, is supposed to have a population of two million. But with cars the preserve of a few privileged government officers, and bicycles not common either, the streets are usually empty, giving an eerie impression of an overbuilt ghost town. The most common form of transportation is by foot and it is not unusual for workers, clad in sneakers and ankle socks, to walk several miles to their jobs. Even so, around 9 a.m. when offices open, the sidewalks are not exactly packed with people.</p>
        <p>There are some theories for the scarcity of humans. The first is that the economy is at such a low point -- the energy shortage has left factories idle -- that people stay home. Many have virtually no money and even if they did, there is nothing to spend it on. And that people have such meager diets that they are lethargic.</p>
        <p>The second theory is that the city can sustain only about 1.5 million people but as hard times have swept the countryside, many more have sought comfort here. In response, the authorities have organized campaigns to sweep nonresidents back out of the capital, to join work gangs or help with the harvest.</p>
        <p>Flown-In Feast</p>
        <p>The Albright visit was packed with luncheons and dinners. Aside from the six hours of negotiations, the Americans and North Koreans spent another six hours socializing with each other. To thank her hosts, Dr. Albright threw a dinner on the last night of her visit in honor of Mr. Kim, his close aides and officials from the Foreign Ministry.</p>
        <p>How does the State Department arrange a diplomatic dinner in North Korea, where there is little meat, few vegetables and shortages of almost everything else? And how does Dr. Albright live up to the standard she set when she invited the North Korean vice marshal, Jo Myong Rok, to a sparkling dinner at the State Department earlier this month with 150 top-drawer guests, including the French and British ambassadors?</p>
        <p>The Americans asked the North Koreans for the use of a suitable locale and were given Magnolia Hall, a grand octagonal banquet room used for state occasions and replete with a large kitchen. North Korean cooks suggested dishes, which were approved by Dr. Albright's deputy chief of staff, Suzanne A. George. Some American touches were added: broiled steak and roast turkey, which the local Korean kitchen staff cooked along with the rest of the menu.</p>
        <p>The ingredients for the dishes were the responsibility of the North Koreans (the meat was flown in from Beijing) and California wine was flown in on Dr. Albright's plane. The high point came when Dear Leader, Mr. Kim, ordered one of his most senior military officers to pour the wine for every guest at the head table. The officer did so with aplomb and drama, stopping after the pouring of each glass to make sure the recipient sampled the wine and exclaimed approval.</p>
        <p>Afterward, the Americans said the evening was most memorable for the sight of a senior North Korean man offering wine to guests who, despite the aura of good feelings this week, formally remain the enemy.</p>
