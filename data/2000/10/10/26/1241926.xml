        <p>THERE'S a noticeable lack of black widow spiders in a certain apartment building in Kips Bay. Skeletons, too.</p>
        <p>And witches' brooms.</p>
        <p>And pumpkins with scary faces.</p>
        <p>A new edict has gone out in the Kips Bay Towers Condominium, at 300 East 33rd Street: no Halloween decorations.</p>
        <p>In fact, certain angry residents point out, the only Halloween decoration to appear, posted near the elevators, is a whimsical drawing of a pumpkin -- at the bottom of an otherwise humorless notice from the managing agent that announces the new policy.</p>
        <p>The reason for the ban, it must be quickly noted, is the new paint and wallpaper job in the upstairs hallways of the 1,120-unit condominium, renovations that cost the building $2.5 million. But some residents do not understand.</p>
        <p>''Last week, the board had a special meeting -- on corn!'' said Carol Garner, who moved in 21 years ago, before the building was converted to a condominium and when it was still full of rent-paying tenants. ''All these important men and women, sitting around debating whether we could hang corn on our doors.''</p>
        <p>The board turned down corn.</p>
        <p>The board has prohibited everything except mezuzas mounted to the door frame and Christmas wreaths -- as long as they do not damage the new paint job. The hallways are classified as common areas, under the control of the board.</p>
        <p>''In the past, some people affixed decals, humorous pet decals, and Halloween decorations with tape and tacks,'' said Mark E. Zimmerman, the Kips Bay board president. ''Some people put children's drawings on the exterior of their apartments, instead of on the refrigerators.''</p>
        <p>The board made the exception for mezuzas and wreaths, as long as they are installed by the building staff, he explained, because of ''the residents' desire to put some religion on the door, and it is a requirement of some people's religion.''</p>
        <p>If there were symbols of other religions that residents wanted to put on their door, Mr. Zimmerman added, they would be encouraged to apply to the board for permission.</p>
        <p>''If they produce references, and we're sure they really are members of this other religion, we will consider it,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But that is not good enough for Ms. Garner and some of her neighbors.</p>
        <p>''So they finally redid the hallways?'' she said, her voice dripping sarcasm. ''They look like a cheap Holiday Inn!''</p>
        <p>(The hallways are, in fact, immaculately done with gray glass around the elevators and beige fabric walls. But they do look bare.)</p>
        <p>To Ms. Garner, holiday decorations are a First Amendment right. But that argument was rejected by the building's managing agent in a letter to her last spring.</p>
        <p>Then there was the sticker Ms. Garner's younger daughter applied years ago, which read, ''Top Secret Contents.'' It disappeared one day, just before the paint job.</p>
        <p>''These people should get a life,'' Ms. Garner said. ''It's my door! It's a violation of my freedom of speech.''</p>
        <p>Marc Luxemburg, a real estate lawyer and the president of the Council of New York Cooperatives and Condominiums, said that the condominium association technically has the right to prohibit any decorations in the common areas.</p>
        <p>''But they usually don't pay any attention to what people stick on their doors,'' he said, adding that he did not know any other buildings that had forbidden Halloween decorations.</p>
        <p>''I don't want to use the word unusual, but it's a minority view,'' he said. ''And condominiums, as opposed to co-operatives, are usually even more relaxed.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Zimmerman, the condo president, concedes that his building may be different. But he wants to emphasize one thing: Kips Bay Towers has nothing against children.</p>
        <p>''Any residents who welcome trick-or-treaters have put their names on a list, and beyond that, children may ring any doorbell they want,'' he said. ''There's a Halloween parade around our gardens. We love parties. We have holiday parties and spring parties. We just don't want any damage to the paint.''</p>
