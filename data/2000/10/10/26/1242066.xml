        <p>Bernie Williams emerged from the Yankees' clubhouse last night, took a sharp left turn to address a group of reporters and acted as if he had been pinned against the gray cinder-block wall when they surrounded him. For a second or two, Williams feigned as if he were helpless. It was a fitting metaphor.</p>
        <p>Williams has one of the sweetest swings on the Yankees; he might be the most dangerous hitter on the Yankees and either he or Derek Jeter is the best all-around player on the Yankees. But Williams is a frustrated soul because he is disappearing in another World Series. He looks helpless.</p>
        <p>''I feel,'' Williams said, ''like my son could get me out.''</p>
        <p>Bernie Jr. is 10 years old and throws right-handed, so his father would have to hit from the left side against him, as he did against Bobby J. Jones last night. Williams is not used to this kind of slump, but he is used to it. He is usually a dynamic player, but this is also the fourth straight World Series in which the All-Star center fielder has been almost invisible at the plate.</p>
        <p>But the Yankees keep covering for Williams. He belted two stinging line drives off Jones last night, but still went 0 for 4 as the Yankees halted the Mets, 3-2, in Game 4 of the World Series at Shea Stadium. The Yankees are one victory away from winning their fourth World Series in the last five years, and Williams has barely contributed offensively in any of them. Credit the victories to solid pitching, overall depth and good fortune. Very few teams could win 15 World Series games without a steady cleanup hitter. Somehow, the Yankees have.</p>
        <p>The Yankees can sniff about Williams being 0 for 15 in this series and 8 for 68 (.118 average) in his career in the World Series. So Williams is a .118 hitter in the World Series. ''Really?'' the Yankees can say while wiping Champagne out of their eyes tonight or over the weekend. ''We did not notice.'' The Yankees keep rolling, even without Williams.</p>
        <p>''I feel very fortunate that he's been blanked and we're sitting at three to one,'' said Joe Torre, Williams's manager. Paul O'Neill put it this way: ''One guy doesn't win it. We all do.''</p>
        <p>About 20 minutes before last night's game, Williams stood along the left-field line slowly swinging a bat, maybe visualizing that elusive first hit. He was about 40 feet from some boisterous fans, but Williams never even peeked at them and kept swinging the bat as he ambled back to the dugout.</p>
        <p>Williams ripped a hard liner to center in the first inning and flied out to center in the third. With a runner on second and two out in the fifth, Williams had a chance to give the Yankees a two-run lead with a single. He fell behind 0-2 to Jones, but took two pitches for balls, then fouled off two pitches. The at-bat kept getting more tense as Jones stepped off the mound three times. Finally, on the seventh pitch, Williams drilled a liner to shortstop. Mike Bordick never had to move.</p>
        <p>In the seventh, Glendon Rusch struck out Williams on a borderline called third strike.</p>
        <p>It was interesting to hear Williams admit that there is more pressure on him because he should have done so much more. Williams should not be influenced by the grandiose stage of the World Series, but he did not specifically say that he was comfortable with it. As someone who has a .331 average in postseason games that are not World Series games, Williams is searching at an awful time.</p>
        <p>''It's frustrating not to come through when the situation needed me to do it,'' Williams said. ''You play 162 games and two rounds of playoffs. You figure you'd be ready. I guess that's what's good about baseball. In my case, that's what's bad about baseball. You never know what's going to happen.''</p>
        <p>Williams linked his drought to being too aggressive, but it is possible that a lack of aggressiveness early in the count caused him to be too aggressive later. Williams is a patient hitter, but he is also aggressive when he needs to be. He has been puzzled in the World Series, and Torre told Williams to stop trying to ''hit it in the parking lot,'' which Williams admitted he had been doing.</p>
        <p>Williams had 19 plate appearances in the Series. He has been intentionally walked twice; in his 17 other appearances, Williams took the first pitch for a strike eight times, took it for a ball five times and fouled it off four times. That shows amazing passivity. Something is wrong when Williams only swings at the first pitch four times in 17 at-bats.</p>
        <p>But the Yankees are rumbling ahead as they wait for Williams. Williams is waiting, too. He wants to get an important hit in the World Series and not look helpless. Still, if the Yankees snatch one more victory, it will not matter.</p>
        <p>''It certainly is frustrating,'' Williams said. ''But as far as being on a team that has won three world championships in the last four years, it really doesn't matter how much I hit. If I had to trade between me having bad World Series and having the team winning, there's no question which I'd choose.''</p>
