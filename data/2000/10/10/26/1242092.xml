        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I am a seventh-grade student at Edgemont Junior-Senior High School in Westchester County, New York. I agree with those kindergarten parents who think their kids get too much work (front page, Oct. 23).  When I was in kindergarten, I didn't get any homework, and we had play time every day. From what I remember, kindergarten was fun!</p>

        <p>I am a seventh-grade student at Edgemont Junior-Senior High School in Westchester County, New York. I agree with those kindergarten parents who think their kids get too much work (front page, Oct. 23).  When I was in kindergarten, I didn't get any homework, and we had play time every day. From what I remember, kindergarten was fun!</p>
        <p>I am now getting at least three to four hours of homework each night, not to mention long-term projects that require extra work on the weekends. It's a grueling lifestyle.</p>
        <p>In my health class, we are studying about different kinds of stress. Right now, my schoolwork is my No. 1 stressor. The other day, in response to studying for our health test on stress, one of my best friends said, ''I can't believe I'm stressing out about a test on stress!''</p>
