        <p>A Pentagon intelligence analyst resigned one day after terrorists bombed the destroyer Cole in Yemen, protesting that his superiors had ignored his warnings of an imminent threat to American forces in the region, senators and defense officials said today.</p>
        <p>The resignation of the analyst -- who monitored terrorist threats in the region for the Defense Intelligence Agency -- raised new questions on Capitol Hill about whether the Pentagon and intelligence agencies could have done more to avert the attack on the Cole, which killed 17 sailors and wounded 39 on Oct. 12.</p>
        <p>The analyst, identified as Kie C. Fallis, had not warned of a specific threat against the Cole or of an attack in Yemen, defense officials said.</p>
        <p>Rather, they said, he concluded from intelligence reports that there was a strong possibility of an attack and that military commanders had not done enough to protect American forces in the region.</p>
        <p>Senior Pentagon officials testified today during House and Senate hearings that at times became contentious. And officials also disclosed that American intelligence agencies had issued two other warnings of a terrorist attack in the region -- one the day before the Cole was bombed, the second hours afterward.</p>
        <p>The Central Intelligence Agency issued a general warning on Oct. 11 that an attack on ''U.S. interests and Jewish tourists'' in the region was likely, one senior government official said. The second warning, issued by the National Security Agency, was more specific, citing the possibility of an attack based on the movement of a suspected terrorist in Yemen, according to a senior defense official.</p>
        <p>That second warning, first reported in The Washington Times today, was not distributed to military commanders until after the attack, but officials emphasized that it did not include enough detail to have called off the Cole's visit to the Yemeni port of Aden to refuel, and in any case came too late.</p>
        <p>''Neither report said there was an imminent attack on an American ship in Yemen or any place else,'' Walter B. Slocombe, the under secretary of defense for policy, told members of the House Armed Services Committee today.</p>
        <p>The latest warnings followed two others, including a vague threat of an attack on an American warship in September and another in the spring that cited the possibility of an attack by a militant Egyptian group. And they prompted sharp exchanges during the Capitol Hill hearings.</p>
        <p>At the hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator Pat Roberts, Republican of Kansas, cited the resignation of the analyst as evidence that ''red flags'' had been ignored by commanders.</p>
        <p>Although he did not identify Mr. Fallis by name, Senator Roberts read passages of his letter of resignation, in which he declared that his analysis could have played a critical role in the agency's ability to ''predict and warn of a potential terrorist attack against U.S. interests.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fallis does not have a listed telephone number in the Washington area. And attempts to reach him via the Defense Intelligence Agency were unsuccessful.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fallis, who had been working on terrorism threats for the past two years, sent a letter to the Defense Intelligence Agency's director, Vice Admiral Thomas R. Wilson, the day after the bombing, announcing his resignation. On Monday, he provided the letter to the Senate's Select Committee on Intelligence and was questioned for six hours by several senators and their aides.</p>
        <p>''There are questions about whether there was full compliance with operational orders,'' said Sen. John W. Warner of Virginia, the Republican chairman of the Senate's Armed Services Committee.</p>
        <p>He said that during a closed session of his committee, he asked officials to explain why the captain, Cmdr. Kirk S. Lippold, failed to follow all of the procedures. ''I very thoroughly went through a number of items of what the captain should have done and then, to the extent of their knowledge, what he elected not to do,'' Mr. Warner said.</p>
