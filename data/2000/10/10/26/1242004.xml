        <p>Frank R. Lautenberg is not leaving quietly or easily.</p>
        <p>''It feels lousy,'' said Mr. Lautenberg, who tells anyone who asks that, in hindsight, he regrets his decision to retire from the Senate after 18 years in office. ''I'm going to miss this place.''</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Lautenberg's final days in office have been a whirlwind of last-minute lawmaking, campaigning for Jon S. Corzine, the Democratic nominee to succeed him, and figuring out what to do with the rest of his life. As if that were not enough, he is still hoping to raise nearly $400,000 to pay off some old campaign debts.</p>
        <p>The senator's third term does not expire until Dec. 31, but his careerwill effectively end as soon as Congress adjourns, probably within the next few days.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lautenberg, 76, is leaving at the height of his influence.</p>
        <p>On Monday, President Clinton signed a bill Mr. Lautenberg had pushed for since 1997 into a law that lowers the legal threshold for drunken driving to a blood alcohol level of 0.08 percent.</p>
        <p>It was a fitting bookend to the senator's 1984 law that raised the drinking age nationally to 21; both bills made federal highway financing contingent on states changing their laws. ''He is leaving a true legacy as a champion for the children, the families and the economy of this nation,'' the president said at a Rose Garden bill-signing ceremony.</p>
        <p>And on Tuesday, after Mr. Lautenberg called his home state ''retarded'' on the issue of drunken driving in a news conference in Trenton, New Jersey officials quickly indicated they would be likely to comply with the lower blood-alcohol limit.</p>
        <p>Two weeks ago, the Senate passed Mr. Lautenberg's measure to allow victims of terrorism to collect court-awarded damages from countries that sponsor terrorist activity.</p>
        <p>He also won $500 million for construction of the New Jersey Transit's Hudson-Bergen Light Rail Line. And still awaiting approval is one bill providing $10 billion in bonds to develop high-speed passenger rail service and another promoting the cleanup and redevelopment of polluted industrial properties.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lautenberg has also played an important role in Mr. Corzine's campaign to succeed him. For instance, after the first New Jersey Senate debate, which Mr. Lautenberg attended, the senator defended Mr. Corzine, who angered some Jewish voters by saying that he supported the Clinton administration's abstention from a United Nations vote condemning Israel over its recent confrontations with Palestinians.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile Mr. Lautenberg is doing what retiring senators do. He is soaking up accolades, such as the naming of the old federal courthouse and post-office building in Newark in his honor; arranging for the transfer of his papers to a new archive at Rutgers University; and musing over what possible role he might play in a Gore administration. (Democratic headhunters, be advised: he is not interested in an ambassadorship because it would require him to spend too much time away from his eight grandchildren.)</p>
        <p>But Mr. Lautenberg's most difficult and awkward remaining chore, he said, is to hold one last campaign fund-raiser. ''I'd like to do it as soon as we can,'' he said.</p>
        <p>At a time when Mr. Corzine is under enormous criticism for spending more than $50 million of his own fortune for his Senate campaign, it seems almost quaint to recall that Mr. Lautenberg -- one of the wealthiest members of the Senate, whose own assets are worth between $11 million and $56 million, according to his Senate financial disclosures -- was criticized for trying to buy his own initial election in 1982 for $5.5 million. Mr. Lautenberg, who had made his fortune as a founder of Automatic Data Processing, contributed most of that from his own pocket. Like many wealthy candidates, he lent the money to his campaign; about $3.2 million in those loans remain on his campaign's books. But Mr. Lautenberg said that he had written off the 1982 debt in his mind.</p>
        <p>He said he still hoped to recover what he borrowed in 1994, however. That year, facing a challenge from Chuck Haytaian, then the Republican Assembly speaker, Mr. Lautenberg raised $5.5 million. But he still needed a $900,000 infusion just three weeks before the election. His campaign borrowed the money from Valley National Bank in Wayne, N.J., and has since paid off all but $390,000, records from the Federal Election Commission show.</p>
        <p>''I contributed to my race in 1982,'' he said. ''I didn't like it, and I didn't want to do it again. But I did it a lot more modestly in '94. But that's still out there, and I'd like to get it paid off.''</p>
        <p>The 1994 loans are guaranteed personally by Mr. Lautenberg -- meaning that if he is unable to raise the entire $390,000 from others, he will have to pay off the rest himself. ''If I fall short, I fall short,'' the senator said. ''I still owe it to the bank, so I've got to pay.''</p>
        <p>But he bristled at the prospect of having to do so. ''I may be fairly well off, but $400,000 is a lot of money,'' he said. ''And there's a principle involved with me. Why should I have to pay to represent people when people think I did a good job?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lautenberg's associates say he was always a reluctant fund-raiser, and often deferred his own campaign financing efforts to other Democrats with more pressing financial needs. After his 1994 re-election, he waited three years to hold a major fund-raising event, a December 1997 gala at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center in Newark. He mainly used the proceeds to retire earlier debts.</p>
        <p>After he announced in February 1999 that he would not seek re-election, Mr. Lautenberg said, he was too busy to raise money, and decided to wait until after Nov. 7 so as not to compete for contributions with Mr. Corzine and Democratic congressional candidates.</p>
        <p>Still, he said, he was confident it was not too late to put together a tribute to himself -- especially because he is counting on the help of such formidable fund-raisers as Mr. Corzine himself.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lautenberg said he had asked Mr. Corzine for help raising money to pay off his debts when the two were getting to know each other, some time before he endorsed the candidate in February. Mr. Corzine agreed to help raise money, he said. Some campaign finance experts questioned the timing of Mr. Lautenberg's request for such help, especially given that the senator's outstanding campaign debts are essentially to himself.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Lautenberg stressed that his understanding with Mr. Corzine -- which has not yet come to fruition -- had nothing to do with his endorsement. ''It was never a deal,'' he said. ''It was never a handshake. It was never, 'O.K., Frank, you do this for me, I'll do that for you.' ''</p>
        <p>The senator said he had far more important reasons for backing Mr. Corzine -- like his longstanding differences with former Gov. Jim Florio, the other Democrat running in the primary, and his belief that Mr. Corzine could be a force in the Senate on issues like fiscal policy, the environment and transportation.</p>
        <p>He added: ''Jon Corzine couldn't have bought my endorsement a hell of a lot more than $400,000.''</p>
