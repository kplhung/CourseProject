        <p>Lesson number one: Be careful what you wish for.</p>
        <p>Not too long ago Al Gore was howling that he would debate George W. Bush anytime, anywhere. The debates were supposed to nail down the election for Mr. Gore. They nearly buried him.</p>
        <p>But now that the debates are over the polls are showing some movement back toward the vice president, which should tell you something. The less he's seen, the better he does.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush has a similar problem. He's fine as long as he's shaking hands and smiling and hugging little children. He's got personality. But something weird happens when he puts aside his programmed responses and starts speaking extemporaneously.</p>
        <p>So there he was in LaCrosse, Wis.,  last week, proclaiming, ''Families is where our nation finds hope, where wings take dream.''</p>
        <p>His handlers hate when that happens.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's personality problems and voter concern over Mr. Bush's readiness to assume the presidency have muted enthusiasm for both men and drawn attention away from issues that might otherwise have been decisive.</p>
        <p>A Page 1 article in Monday's Times said: ''Even after absorbing three debates and months of campaigning, American voters are thoroughly ambivalent about their choices for president, still vexed by doubts about Vice President Al Gore's sincerity and Gov. George W. Bush's preparedness for the White House, the latest New York Times/ CBS News Poll shows.''</p>
        <p>The doubts will likely remain. But with less than two weeks to go until Election Day, and with the debates over, the media can be expected to focus less on personality and more on what should be the real issues of this campaign.</p>
        <p>That sigh of relief you just heard is coming from the Gore people. The vice president's personality has gotten in the way of his message throughout the campaign. Even at the Democratic convention, where it was generally agreed that Mr. Gore delivered a credible acceptance speech, the strongest case for continuing the policies of the Clinton administration was made by the president.</p>
        <p>Referring to his budget proposal in the first year of his first administration, Bill Clinton told the convention's roaring delegates: ''It passed by a single vote in both houses. In a deadlocked Senate, Al Gore cast the tie-breaking vote. Now, not a single Republican supported it. . . . Their leaders said our plan would increase the deficit, kill jobs, and give us a one-way ticket to a recession. Time has not been kind to their predictions.''</p>
        <p>Moments later, he added, ''You know, Harry Truman's old saying has never been more true: If you want to live like a Republican, you better vote for the Democrats.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton is itching to take that message to the American people one more time. But polls have tended to show that Bill Clinton campaigning full-blast for Al Gore would turn off substantially more voters than he would turn on. So the big dog remains leashed.</p>
        <p>If, finally, the spotlight is turned away from Al Gore's personality, the last days of this campaign are likely to focus on the differences between the two candidates on the following: the fate of Social Security and the budget surplus, tax cuts, appointments to the Supreme Court, abortion, federal aid to public education, the environment and a variety of health care issues, including the future of Medicare, proposed prescription drug benefits and the establishment of a so-called patients' bill of rights.</p>
        <p>At first it was thought these issues would get a thorough airing in the debates. But the debates became dreary popularity contests refereed by pundits obsessed with declaring an instant winner and loser. If we've learned anything from this campaign it's that the debate formats should be changed (and additional questioners added) in an effort to make them more informative for the voters.</p>
        <p>The trends to watch over the next several days are whether Al Gore can keep the personality questions behind him and get a bounce from hammering home the differences between him and Mr. Bush on specific issues, and whether Mr. Bush, in the pressurized finale of a presidential campaign, can avoid being undermined by voter unease over whether he is ready for the White House.</p>
