        <p>When Rick A. Lazio arrived here for a Monroe County Republican reception this evening, he could be forgiven for feeling that he had been in these parts before. He had. Many times.</p>
        <p>In fact, tonight's was the 22nd campaign appearance Mr. Lazio had made in upstate New York over six straight days: from Amherst to Syracuse, from Catskill to West Ghent (it's in Columbia County), and from Utica to Hornell. And he will be back next week.</p>
        <p>With two weeks to go until Election Day, Mr. Lazio is devoting a great deal of attention to a part of New York that should be easy country for a Republican. And that is stirring concern among some of his supporters as the geographic forces that have traditionally shaped New York elections appear to be shifting this year -- and not necessarily to Mr. Lazio's advantage.</p>
        <p>That this is happening is a result of Hillary Rodham Clinton's unusually aggressive effort over the last 15 months in a part of New York that Democrats have tended to neglect. It also reflects what Mr. Lazio's aides say were some miscalculations in his initial approach to upstate, in particular the assumption that Mrs. Clinton would not be received well north of Westchester County.</p>
        <p>As a result, while Mr. Lazio is being pressed to spend the final days of this campaign in a region that should be solidly in his corner, Mrs. Clinton is comfortable enough about her Democratic support to spend relatively more time in competitive regions of the state, starting with the New York City suburbs. She is even finding time to venture onto what has been the Republican base: he was in Syracuse on Tuesday and so was Mrs. Clinton, delivering a speech on the economy. It was her third trip upstate in a week; she is planning a three-day upstate bus trip starting Saturday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio's advisers said the decision to devote so much time upstate was a sign of strength, not weakness, and reflected their confidence of his support in the suburbs. Mr. Lazio's senior campaign consultant, Mike Murphy, argued that the race would be decided largely upstate, and that the region is not as Republican as it once was.</p>
        <p>''The upstate hasn't been Republican base country in 15 years,'' said Mr. Murphy. ''It's swing country -- and it's swinging our way, and we're winning.''</p>
        <p>''Upstate is coming back strong,'' Mr. Murphy said. ''We've got to watch it, but upstate is coming back.''</p>
        <p>But some senior New York Republicans sympathetic to Mr. Lazio's campaign, as well as some independent political analysts, said that Mr. Lazio should have nailed down upstate by now. They said that the need to tend to his base had emerged as a campaign-ending distraction that was pulling Mr. Lazio away from places where he might more profitably search for support.</p>
        <p>''He's constantly in upstate New York -- constantly -- and that's really killing him,'' said one Republican strategist, who insisted on anonymity. ''He's spending an inordinate time for this late in upstate New York, which prevents him from appealing to suburban voters.''</p>
        <p>Maurice Carroll, the director of the Quinnipiac University Poll, said Mr. Lazio was forced to head upstate now because he didn't do it earlier. ''He has to do it,'' Mr. Carroll said. ''She has worked her tail off upstate, and she has cut into the traditional overwhelming Republican preponderance up there.''</p>
        <p>Further, while Mr. Lazio's aides argued the candidate was keeping a presence in the suburbs through television advertisements, his relative physical absence from the metropolitan area has meant he is not getting the ''free media'' that comes with television news coverage. Most suburban voters get their news from the New York City television stations, which means that they have not been seeing much of Mr. Lazio.</p>
        <p>At the same time, Mrs. Clinton has been a more regular presence on the news, because of her time spent in the metropolitan area and, not incidentally, the frequent visits by President Clinton, including a fund-raiser in Manhattan tonight.</p>
        <p>Political analysts expect that in this election, about 45 percent of the vote will come from upstate New York, 31 percent will come from the suburban counties and 24 percent from New York City. Based on those figures, Mr. Lazio's aides said that in order to counteract the advantage Mrs. Clinton would gain in New York City, which is overwhelmingly Democratic, he needed to draw at least 55 percent of the upstate vote.</p>
        <p>But pollsters who have been following the race say that Mr. Lazio has yet to assure himself of that margin. Thus, it was no surprise that Mr. Lazio, after flying back to New York to attend the third game of the World Series on Tuesday, hopped back on his campaign jet for the Monroe County G.O.P. Annual Pre-Victory Grazing tonight. An aide said that he would spend ''the vast bulk''  of his time between now and Election Day in upstate New York.</p>
        <p>Part of what is going on reflects the change in electoral politics in New York. As Mr. Murphy noted, upstate is not as reliably Republican as it once was; Charles E. Schumer, a Democrat, won 45 percent of the vote upstate, when he defeated Alfonse M. D'Amato for a fourth term in 1998, by 8 percentage points statewide. (Mr. Schumer won 74 percent of the vote in the city, which is higher than anyone expects Mrs. Clinton to do, and 48 percent of the suburban vote.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Schumer, in an interview, argued that upstate voters no longer automatically view Democrats as loyal advocates for New York City, and thus foes of upstate, as they once did. And while Mrs. Clinton is not from New York State, as Mr. Lazio has noted with some regularity, she is not from New York City either.</p>
        <p>By contrast, Mr. Lazio assumed -- incorrectly, Mr. Schumer argued --  that a Long Island native would not be viewed as another downstate candidate, and thus would be quickly embraced in a way that Rudolph W. Giuliani was not, when he was the Republican candidate for Senate. For a long time, Mr. Lazio's television advertisements included a shot of him walking on a Long Island beach with his family. He dropped the scene at the urging of some Republicans who said that it was hurting him among upstate voters.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio also let the summer pass without nailing down his position upstate, notwithstanding advice from some New York Republicans that he should, in the words of one, have ''camped out'' upstate in August. ''Upstate has been the battleground all along: Lazio just came to the war late,'' said Lee M. Miringoff, director of the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion in Poughkeepsie.</p>
        <p>At the same time, while Mrs. Clinton was talking about the upstate economy at every opportunity -- she even gave a speech to business leaders in Manhattan asserting that it was in their interest to invest upstate -- Mr. Lazio declared at a debate that the upstate economy had ''turned the corner,'' an assertion that was questioned by some Republicans and newspaper editorial writers.</p>
        <p>For their part, Mr. Lazio's advisers argued that Mrs. Clinton would end up doing relatively poorly in New York City, because of what they asserted was a lack of enthusiasm about her among many Democrats. In particular, they are hoping that reservations about her among Jewish voters there will lead many Democrats to either skip the Senate race or vote for Mr. Lazio when they come to vote for president. And Mrs. Clinton's aides are concerned that the absence of Mr. Giuliani on the ballot will result in a lower turnout among black voters, who, they said, would have turned out in greater numbers against the mayor.</p>
        <p>''Her numbers are not quite as good as they appear on the surface,'' said Bill Dal Col, Mr. Lazio's campaign manager. Still, Mr. Lazio's aides acknowledge that the place to watch is upstate. And there, pollsters and political analysts say, voters are very familiar with Mrs. Clinton, while uncertain about Mr. Lazio, who remains something of an unknown quanity -- even to those who, by now, should be pledging their allegiance to him.</p>
        <p>''She has really worked hard to convince people that they can trust her,'' said Donna Colangelo, a 38-year-old cashier at a convenience store near Utica, who described herself as a lifelong Republican, a note of admiration in her voice. ''I don't think he's been as aggressive as she is. But he still has time.''</p>
