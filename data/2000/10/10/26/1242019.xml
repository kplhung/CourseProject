        <p>AT&amp;T's plan to break itself up offers challenges and opportunities for all four of the corporate fiefs that will be spawned from the mother company, but AT&amp;T Wireless may be the operation that has the most to gain.</p>
        <p>AT&amp;T Wireless, the nation's third-largest cellular phone carrier with nearly 12.6 million subscribers, will become an independent company. Common stock will be offered in exchange for the tracking stock now available. The transaction will provide AT&amp;T Wireless with greater autonomy and flexibility in a highly competitive industry that is adding nearly 30,000 subscribers a day in the United States.</p>
        <p>Until now, the argument goes, AT&amp;T Wireless was a prisoner of priorities set under the old Ma Bell. Its shareholders have had recent experience with this. After a record $10.62 billion public offering of tracking stock in the company in April, which may have represented the height of speculation over the potential of wireless services, its stock has declined 24 percent.</p>
        <p>After AT&amp;T announced its plans yesterday, however, shares of AT&amp;T Wireless climbed 94 cents, or 4.3 percent, to $22.56, while AT&amp;T shed $3.81, or 14 percent, to $23.38. Could it be that investors are betting AT&amp;T Wireless has the capacity to emerge from the breakup stronger than its parent? Close followers of the company think the answer may be yes.</p>
        <p>''Wireless has the best growth prospects of any of AT&amp;T's businesses,'' said Frank Marsala, an analyst with ING Barings. ''It is therefore highly positive to remove the yoke from AT&amp;T Wireless to allow it to pursue its own strategies.''</p>
        <p>To be sure, without having to succumb to AT&amp;T's wide-reaching priorities -- which in the last couple of years have mainly involved a $100 billion bet on the deployment of high-speed cable connections to the Internet -- the wireless company will be free to embark on its own path.</p>
        <p>Paradoxically, this could bring AT&amp;T Wireless into competition with its parent in an area like providing fixed wireless access, which had been considered more of a technological curiosity than a business opportunity by AT&amp;T's management.</p>
        <p>Or AT&amp;T Wireless could begin to shop around for a cheaper price for its long-distance service instead of acquiring it solely from AT&amp;T, or raise larger amounts of capital faster than it could from its parent. But most important, perhaps, is the ability to acquire other companies and expand without having to consult the powers that be at AT&amp;T.</p>
        <p>Under this assumption, a company courted by AT&amp;T Wireless would be more inclined to accept voting stock, instead of nonvoting tracking shares, as a currency in the transaction.</p>
        <p>''Getting rid of the tracking stock, which was really just a Wall Street invention, removes a huge negative,'' said Jeffrey Hines of Deutsche Bank. ''This allows AT&amp;T Wireless to wholeheartedly strike out on its own.'' According to Mr. Hines, the most positive situation for AT&amp;T Wireless would be one in which the company emerges as a ''Vodafone-ish'' enterprise, resembling the Vodafone Group, the big British wireless company that has aggressively expanded through Europe and the United States. Like Vodafone, AT&amp;T Wireless would be able to plan without having to serve a big parent company's fixed-line ambitions.</p>
        <p>If AT&amp;T's third-quarter figures, which were released yesterday, are any indication, AT&amp;T Wireless has enormous potential to grow.</p>
        <p>AT&amp;T Wireless reported a net addition of 750,000 subscribers in the quarter, surpassing most analysts' estimates by 40 percent. Average revenue per subscriber of $68.50 a month and total service revenue, which climbed 34 percent, to $2.5 billion, also exceeded expectations.</p>
        <p>''These numbers offer every indication of what's ahead,'' John D. Zeglis, chief executive of AT&amp;T Wireless, said in an interview.</p>
        <p>Still, some risks lie ahead as AT&amp;T Wireless goes its own way. For instance, AT&amp;T will still control the company's brand, allowing the wireless company to use it under a licensing agreement. ''That kind of brand hegemony is a disadvantage,'' said Thomas Lee, an analyst at Chase H&amp;Q. ''Imagine the damage that could have been done early on to the brand if each one of the Baby Bells would have kept the AT&amp;T name. It's highly unpredictable.''</p>
        <p>There is also a lingering concern that AT&amp;T Wireless will not be able to benefit from having a fixed-line partner with an extensive distribution system allowing it to bundle services together. AT&amp;T's chairman, C. Michael Armstrong, sought to ease that concern by affirming that it would maintain cross-marketing and distribution agreements that continue bundling arrangements.</p>
