        <p>THE INTEREST GROUPS</p>
        <p>RIFLE ASSOCIATION BACKS BUSH  Without fanfare, the National Rifle Association's political action committee has endorsed Gov. George W. Bush for president, posting a notice on its Web site earlier this week. Though it has been clear for months that the politically potent group would work to defeat Vice President Al Gore, there had been questions about whether it would endorse Mr. Bush because of concerns among some Republicans that the group's backing could turn off centrist voters and women. But in his monthly column in one of the rifle association's magazines, the group's president, Charlton Heston, trumpets the endorsement, saying that ''Bush has steadfastly supported gun owners' rights.'' In September, the organization also contributed $961,826 to help Mr. Bush's campaign, federal election records show. Kym Spell, a spokeswoman for the Gore campaign, said the endorsement showed that Mr. Bush ''is the candidate of the gun lobby.'' But Ray Sullivan, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, replied, ''When it comes to special interest funding and support, Al Gore knocks it out of the park.''</p>

        <p>THE DEMOCRATS</p>
        <p>THE VIDEOTAPE INCIDENT  A lawyer for Thomas J. Downey, a senior Gore adviser who six weeks ago received a videotape of Gov. George W. Bush's debate preparation, asserted yesterday that it was becoming evident that the incident was a dirty trick by people in the Bush campaign. The lawyer, Marc E. Miller, in a letter to the attorney general and the director of the F.B.I., said that the two top law enforcement officials should make a public statement on their conclusions before Election Day. Mr. Miller wrote, ''It now appears to be more likely than not that the original transmission of the material to Mr. Downey was not, in fact, a misguided act of a single person acting alone as Mr. Downey had initially assumed, but rather the concerted, intentional act by more than one person associated with the Bush campaign.'' The Bush camp has denied that it was involved in any plan to make the Gore campaign look like it was cheating in preparation for the debates. Law enforcement officials said yesterday that they had not yet completed their investigation of the incident.</p>

        <p>THE REPUBLICANS</p>
        <p>McCAIN TRUMPETS BUSH  Given the bitterness of his losing battle against Gov. George W. Bush in the Republican primaries, Senator John McCain of Arizona still endures suspicions about how much he looks forward to a Bush presidency. But yesterday, during a rare full day of campaigning at Mr. Bush's side, Mr. McCain tried to put those questions to rest. He told a crowd in Sanford, Fla., that service to causes greater than self-interest was ''what a Gore-Cheney presidency means.''</p>

        <p>THE ALIEN FACTOR</p>
        <p>AND OUT IN ROSWELL . . .  Maybe he was hoping to woo alienated voters. Or maybe he simply found himself in the position, not so unusual in this campaign, of having to win back a constituency previously thought to be solidly in his camp. Or maybe the official explanation, that New Mexico is up for grabs, is true.</p>
        <p>Whatever the reason, Dick Cheney took his vice-presidential campaign yesterday Roswell, N.M., which conspiracy theorists have long held to be the site of an alien landing and a government coverup.</p>
        <p>After his motorcade drove past the U.F.O Museum and Research Center, and plenty of shops hawking inflatable alien dolls and alien masks, Mr. Cheney was greeted by a cheering crowd that included one man with a sign.  featuring a little green man, a heart and the word ''Cheney.'' Aliens love Cheney, it appeared to say.</p>
        <p>Space aliens should already be behind Bush, if one of the more far-fetched supermarket tabloids, the Weekly World News, is to be believed. ''Space Alien Backs Bush for President!'' its front page trumpeted back in May. ''Same alien helped Clinton win top job in 1992!''</p>

        <p>THE AD COMPAIGN</p>
        <p>PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY WEIGHS IN  Citizens for Better Medicare, a group largely financed by the pharmaceutical industry, says that over the past few months it has spent more than $8.3 million on television advertisements that take aim at the Clinton-Gore administration's proposal to provide prescription drug benefits under Medicare. The advertisements, warning that the proposal would lead to government price controls and rationing of life-saving drugs, are running in many of the same television markets around the country in which Gov. George W. Bush is running commercials. Like Mr. Bush, the pharmaceutical industry favors a plan that would subsidize individual purchases of medicines. The finances of Citizens for Better Medicare had been shrouded in secrecy for months. But a few days ago it was forced to report details under provisions of a new federal law. Among other things, the first report revealed that all of the group's advertising money has gone to National Media, a firm run by Alex Castellanos, who also coordinates advertising by the Republican National Committee and the Bush campaign.</p>
