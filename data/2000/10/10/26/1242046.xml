        <p>Congressional negotiators said today that they had reached a tentative agreement that would avert threatened cuts in Medicaid payments to hospitals and other health care providers in New York, Illinois and a few other states.</p>
        <p>The agreement is a victory for the House speaker, J. Dennis Hastert, Republican of Illinois, as well as for New York's Congressional delegation, the Greater New York Hospital Association and the Health Care Association of New York State, which represents more than 250 hospitals.</p>
        <p>Senator Charles E. Schumer said: ''This is an excellent solution for New York and for those communities that have been spending Medicaid money for good purposes. It does not get us totally out of the woods, but it's much better than we ever thought we'd do.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Schumer said the Clinton administration had not seen the final legislative language, but was ''favorably disposed'' to the agreement.</p>
        <p>Earlier this year, the administration moved to stop what it described as an incipient scandal in the Medicaid program. The administration said that states were overcharging Medicaid for care provided to poor people in hospitals and nursing homes run by counties, cities and other local governments.</p>
        <p>Medicaid is jointly financed by the federal government and the states. Federal officials said states had used accounting gimmicks to reduce their contributions to far below the shares specified by law.</p>
        <p>Illinois said it would have lost $500 million a year under the rules proposed by the administration, and Mr. Hastert had strenuously opposed those cuts. New York said it would have lost at least $400 million a year.</p>
        <p>Opposition to the cuts was a bipartisan cause. Representative Rick A. Lazio, the Republican candidate for the Senate in New York, played a large role, as did New York Democrats like Mr. Schumer, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Representative Charles B. Rangel.</p>
        <p>Illinois and New York insisted that they had used federal Medicaid money only for a legitimate purpose -- to provide health care to poor people and the uninsured. But federal Medicaid officials said some states had used the money for health programs other than Medicaid and even for purposes unrelated to health care.</p>
        <p>Kenneth E. Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, said the agreement would be helpful to hospitals with large numbers of Medicaid patients, including teaching hospitals like Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx and New York Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>The financial problems of New York's teaching hospitals will not be solved, Mr. Raske said, ''but they won't be aggravated by additional cuts.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio and his opponent in the Senate race, Hillary Rodham Clinton, have both promised to protect New York's teaching hospitals. Republicans cited Mr. Lazio's work on the Medicaid bill as evidence that he could deliver on his commitment.  Hospital lobbyists said Mrs. Clinton had been helpful behind the scenes.</p>
        <p>Today's agreement grants a reprieve to New York, Illinois and a few other states, including Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. While curbing the most blatant misuses of federal money, the agreement will allow states to increase Medicaid payments to public hospitals that serve ''a disproportionate number of low-income patients.'' The limit on such payments will be 1.75 times the cost of a hospital's ''uncompensated care,'' for which no reimbursement was received.</p>
        <p>Two Republican senators, William V. Roth Jr. of Delaware and Don Nickles of Oklahoma, expressed disappointment with the agreement. They said it did not do enough to curtail states' use of creative accounting techniques in Medicaid.</p>
        <p>Gayle Osterberg, a spokeswoman for Mr. Nickles, the assistant majority leader of the Senate, said Congress was sending a message to states: ''If you find a way to abuse Medicaid, do it early, do it boldly and do it big. Your dependence on these misused funds will be protected.''</p>
        <p>In October, federal health officials said they feared that states would extract tens of billions of dollars from the treasury over the next 10 years, using Medicaid to pay for tax cuts and education programs. But  efforts to crack down on the practice provoked an outcry that caused political problems for the White House.</p>
        <p>Vice President Al Gore has repeatedly asserted that Texas, under Gov. George W. Bush, neglected the health care needs of its residents. In view of such criticism, governors said, it was paradoxical for the Clinton administration to try to slash Medicaid payments to states like Illinois and New York, which say they have used the money to expand health programs for the poor.</p>
