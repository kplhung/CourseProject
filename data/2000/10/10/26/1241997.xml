        <p>As Representative Bob Franks savored a wave of newspaper endorsements and a new poll showing the New Jersey contest for the United States Senate might be turning into more of a race after all, his Democratic opponent, Jon S. Corzine, campaigned in one of the state's most heavily Republican counties today, scouring for the independent-minded voters his advisers say could decide the outcome of the campaign.</p>
        <p>Mr. Franks received several bits of good news today, most notably a new Quinnipiac University survey showing he had reduced Mr. Corzine's lead among likely voters to 5 percentage points.

        <p>As Representative Bob Franks savored a wave of newspaper endorsements and a new poll showing the New Jersey contest for the United States Senate might be turning into more of a race after all, his Democratic opponent, Jon S. Corzine, campaigned in one of the state's most heavily Republican counties today, scouring for the independent-minded voters his advisers say could decide the outcome of the campaign.</p>
        <p>Mr. Franks received several bits of good news today, most notably a new Quinnipiac University survey showing he had reduced Mr. Corzine's lead among likely voters to 5 percentage points. Within hours, the Republican Leadership Council announced it would pour $250,000 into New York and Philadelphia television stations for ads already running that depict Mr. Corzine's proposals as excessively expensive.</p>
        <p>Both developments followed Mr. Franks's endorsement by the editorial page of The New York Times, which came after endorsements this week by The Philadelphia Inquirer and two New Jersey newspapers, The Press of Atlantic City and The Courier-Post of Cherry Hill.</p>
        <p>Mr. Franks's aides, suddenly buoyant, argued that they had at last wrested the momentum in the campaign away from Mr. Corzine. And to outward appearances, at least, the findings of the latest Quinnipiac poll seemed to bear that out. The poll found Mr. Corzine leading Mr. Franks 46 percent to 41 percent among likely voters. That compared with an Oct. 4 Quinnipiac survey that showed Mr. Corzine ahead 48 percent to 34 percent.</p>
        <p>But Scott McLean, a professor of political science at Quinnipiac, said Mr. Franks's improvement had mainly come among Republicans who had previously been undecided. Independent or unaffiliated voters, who represent as much as three-fifths of the New Jersey electorate, continue to favor Mr. Corzine, according to the survey of 909 voters, conducted Oct. 18 to 23. The poll had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.</p>
        <p>''If the surge is based on Republicans coming home to Franks, there's an upper limit to how far that can go,'' Mr. McLean said. Moreover, he said, Mr. Franks appeared unusually reliant on anti-Corzine sentiment for his own support, perhaps because Mr. Franks had mainly been on the attack, and had not yet begun to make a case for his own candidacy in paid television advertisements.</p>
        <p>As if on cue, Mr. Franks tonight began running a new campaign commercial in which he addresses the camera himself for the first time and trumpets his own role in balancing the federal budget and protecting Social Security.</p>
        <p>''Jon Corzine spent 60 million bucks to be seen and heard everywhere,'' he says, after snippets of several Corzine commercials fade to black. ''Now it's my turn to say something.''</p>
        <p>After being vastly outspent on television advertisements throughout much of the campaign, Mr. Franks appears to be addressing that imbalance in the final weeks of the race. An aide to Mr. Franks said he had reserved $900,000 in television time for each of the two weeks remaining until Election Day.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine is spending roughly twice that, but Mr. Franks's allies, like the Republican Leadership Council, are helping to make up the difference with their own ads. And Mr. Franks's aides still hold out hope that they can wring another $500,000 in money for TV commercials from the National Republican Senatorial Committee.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Corzine's commercials have become familiar to New Jersey television viewers and radio listeners, his campaign has entered the phase in which retail politicking -- personal appearances and meeting voters -- and getting out the vote are far more important.</p>
        <p>Democratic officials say Mr. Corzine will spend $3 million on Election Day alone on the get-out-the-vote effort. But first, they are laying the groundwork by spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on telephone calls to identify Mr. Corzine's supporters across the state, and by mobilizing union members and other volunteers to knock on doors even in areas frequently skipped over by Democratic candidates.</p>
        <p>Today, accompanied by Senator Robert G. Torricelli and former Senator Bill Bradley, Mr. Corzine ventured into Morris County, one of the state's strongest Republican bastions, whose 450,000 residents routinely give Republican candidates broad pluralities in statewide elections.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine pledged to fight for strict federal gun-control laws, above all a uniform federal law requiring registration and licensing of all weapons. ''This is one of the fundamental, driving reasons why I ran for the U.S. Senate,'' he told several dozen members of the Morristown chapter of the Million Mom March.</p>
        <p>''I am sick and tired of no progress on gun control in this country,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Earlier, Mr. Corzine spoke to high school students in Parsippany, the county's biggest community. He said that in past visits to the area he had stressed gun control and education, issues that he said were nonpartisan and, he hoped, appealed to Republicans and Democrats alike.</p>
        <p>With just 13 days until Election Day, Mr. Corzine admitted to some jitters. ''Candidates get pretty nervous as they start running up against the 11th hour,'' he said. ''I've never been in this sort of a crucible of tension.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Corzine's presence in such a traditional Republican stronghold -- Gov. Christine Todd Whitman carried the county by more than 50,000 votes in 1997 -- seemed to energize local Democrats.</p>
        <p>Paul M. Bangiola, the Morris County Democratic chairman, who joined Mr. Corzine at one point, said he believed that the Republicans' firm grip on the county was slipping  and that Democrats were finally equipped to exploit that weakness. The Democratic Party opened its first permanent, full-time headquarters there a month ago.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bangiola said moderate Republicans and independent voters who lean Republican in Morris County were becoming disenchanted by what he called the national party's Southern-dominated ''right-wing agenda.''</p>
        <p>''We call them the soft R's, and we're going after them,'' he said.</p>
