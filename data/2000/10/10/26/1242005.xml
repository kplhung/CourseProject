        <p>When Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright landed here this week, the Clinton administration had closely watched what it viewed as the erratic and threatening behavior of the leader, Kim Jong Il, for more than six years.</p>
        <p>A series of crises that concerned the North Korean nuclear program and its ability to build and launch long-range missiles had driven Washington to believe that the reclusive Mr. Kim was determined to destabilize the North Asian region and, possibly, attack the United States.</p>
        <p>After negotiating with Mr. Kim over two days, Dr. Albright and her team of North Korea specialists who left the country this morning said they had come away with a different impression. They found, they said, a leader who could be reasoned with and keeps up on events through the Internet and CNN and who has traveled to China, India and Russia.</p>
        <p>The assessment of Mr. Kim toward the end of this visit is vastly more positive than it was several months ago, when there was considerable disbelief in Washington, and even some quiet scoffing, at similar descriptions given by President Kim Dae Jung of South Korea after his visit to North Korea in June.</p>
        <p>In one of the many conversations with the secretary that ranged over subjects like his annual viewing of the Oscars -- presumably by videotape -- Mr. Kim said he was examining alternatives to his Communist economy. Specifically, he said he liked the Swedish model.</p>
        <p>As the Americans try to fathom what has prompted what is apparently Mr. Kim's new readiness to abandon his missile program on conditions that would be acceptable to the United States, the central theme of the talks here, they have come up with two basic reasons: the economic survival of a country that is teetering on the brink of collapse and the survival of his own dictatorship.</p>
        <p>''I think he's beginning to think about how to sustain his economy over time,'' a senior administration official said. ''He has some understanding that missile exports, although they obviously bring in hard currency, also produce problems for him.''</p>
        <p>Most significantly, the official added, Mr. Kim apparently understood that maintaining a hard-line posture on his missile program and exports prevented any possibility of a relationship with the United States.</p>
        <p>The Americans said they believed that Mr. Kim, who inherited the leadership from his father, Kim Il Sung, who died six years ago, needs to shore up his vulnerabilities. He runs a country where the 1.1 million-member military wields a disproportionate degree of authority. But as the indulged child of a powerful man, he never worked his way up through the ranks.</p>
        <p>Whether Mr. Kim, whom officials said they found smart but far from being a creative thinker, will actually put into effect any economic changes remains a question. Improving the economy would mean opening the country to foreign investors, much as China has done. But that is a move that could produce profound shocks in one of the most isolated countries in the world.</p>
        <p>Asked whether Mr. Kim understood the implications of opening his society to the Internet and a global economy, the administration official replied, ''I think that is, in part, why this will be a slow process.''</p>
        <p>In preparing for Dr. Albright's visit here, possibly the prelude to a trip by President Clinton before he leaves office, Washington has had to build on the little that it knows about Mr. Kim. At home, his life story is murky and subject to wild rumors.</p>
        <p>Despite hagiography that insists that he was born in a log cabin on a legendary mountaintop, American officials said they believed that Mr. Kim was born in a military camp in the Far East of the Soviet Union in 1942, when his father was fighting Japanese troops. Mr. Kim's father moved back to Korea at the end of World War II, heading the Korean Communist Party in the Soviet-occupied North and becoming its leader after 1948, when a Communist-led republic was proclaimed, until his death in 1994.</p>
        <p>The younger Mr. Kim was educated in Pyongyang, the capital, and graduated from university in political economy, essentially a degree in Marxism-Leninism.</p>
        <p>Kim Jong Il then began to rise through the ranks of the Communist Party and was put in charge of agitprop and then the all-important personnel department. In 1980, he was proclaimed the successor to his father, and granted the title of Dear Leader, close but not quite the same as the title of Great Leader that belongs to the senior Mr. Kim.</p>
        <p>In his rise to power, rumors abounded about his love affairs. North Korea experts said they believed that he has an official wife, Ko Yong Hui, and that he has had other wives and children with them. There was no sign of a wife at the social occasions with Dr. Albright. But he has told visitors that he has children in their 20's.</p>
        <p>Many of the anecdotes about Mr. Kim's personal life came from a South Korean actress and her former husband who were kidnapped in Hong Kong and taken to North Korea on Mr. Kim's orders. After their escape from the North, that couple publicized accounts about Mr. Kim's extravagant spending on movie productions and on his love for luxury, including Mercedes-Benzes.</p>
        <p>Those accounts, combined with intelligence reports that implicated Mr. Kim in the bombing of a South Korean airliner and other terrorist acts, encouraged the impression that Mr. Kim was somehow dissolute and, perhaps, a little unstable.</p>
        <p>The Americans were apparently relieved to find now that this was not the case. Anyway, they argue, as a senior administration official said today, that the issues of North Korea's building missiles and encouraging nuclear proliferation were too ''important to say glibly: 'This guy is kooky. He's out of this world. Who could possibly deal with him?' ''</p>
        <p>After 12 hours of dealing with him, undoubtedly on his best behavior, the Americans found that there was nothing obviously odd about him. But they also recognized that the enormous cult of personality that surrounds Mr. Kim means that he is treated as an infallible leader, who by definition finds it difficult to make change quickly.</p>
        <p>At the core of a change in North Korea's strategic posture is the start of reconciliation with South Korea, a process that began with the visit of President Kim Dae Jung of South Korea to Pyongyang in the summer.</p>
        <p>How much investment North Korea welcomes from the South will be one measure of Mr. Kim's intentions. Perhaps more important will be the  movement that the two sides make in having their militaries reduce tensions between them.</p>
        <p>The Americans said they tried to explain to Mr. Kim some basics about the American political system so that he would understand that the White House, as it considers proposals about how to finalize North Korea's missile contraction, did not act in a vacuum. He was told by Dr. Albright that the administration would consult Congress and its allies and try to build support as it considered any quid pro quo for North Korea to abandon its missiles.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kim, who does not speak English nor appear to understand it, asked Dr. Albright few political, cultural or social questions about the United States. But toward the end of their first meeting, he did ask Dr. Albright whether she had just seen coverage of their meetings on CNN. She had not. But he had, presumably with the help of an interpreter.</p>
        <p>Correction:  October 27, 2000, Friday  Because of a transmission error, an article yesterday about the scene in Pyongyang, North Korea, during Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright's visit this week misspelled the name of the country's leader. He is Kim Jong Il, not Kim Yong Il.</p>
