        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>David Halberstam remembers Joe DiMaggio kicking the dirt at second base in a rare display of emotion (Op-Ed, Oct. 21). To us kids who lived around Yankee Stadium in the 1950's, Joe DiMaggio's reputation as the best player ever was not as important as his aloofness.</p>
        <p>When we clustered at the players'  entrance, Phil Rizzuto lined us up and signed every autograph request. Whitey Ford smiled and made a pass at signing, too. Billy Martin was excited by our attention, and Mel Allen actually talked to us.</p>
        <p>DiMaggio once started his car with my young arms inside it, grubby pad of paper still extended to him, and I was bruised in more ways than one. Maybe it had to do with center fielders: Mickey Mantle, another center fielder, once kicked me. I know that locals see things differently from tourists, but although I still admire Joe DiMaggio, I've never completely forgiven him.</p>
