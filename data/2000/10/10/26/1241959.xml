        <p>A good day for a Mormon missionary is when only a third of the doors you knock on get slammed in your face. There are not many good days during a Subway Series.</p>
        <p>Nobody knows this better than Tyler McKell and Barrett Bonella, two fresh-faced young men charged with hitting the bricks of Bushwick, Brooklyn, to spread the word of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</p>
        <p>The two church elders have what is probably the toughest gig in the proselytizing business: trying to pry people away from the World Series long enough to hear a five-minute message from the Mormon Church.</p>
        <p>''We get a lot of people telling us, 'Go away. We're watching the game,' '' said Elder McKell as he stood on Wyckoff Avenue in his pressed white shirt, a dark blue knapsack slung across his back. ''Of course, the trick is using baseball to get the conversation going. When we can do that, it usually works pretty good.''</p>
        <p>Now that Bushwick and the rest of the city have been plunged into a new round of World Series psychoanalysis, it is difficult to get a rational answer to the question of why fans are rooting for their chosen teams, let alone figure out who is going to win this thing.</p>
        <p>To get at the unvarnished truth, it would be wise to turn an ear toward two men who not only mingle with the masses every day but who also have no innate team leanings.</p>
        <p>Elders McKell and Bonella, both 20, landed in Bushwick a month ago and spend from 6:30 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. every day except Wednesday walking the neighborhood for potential converts. They knock on doors. They set up appointments to visit people in their homes. They approach strangers on the street in a type of missionary cold call known as a ''fearless.''</p>
        <p>Even though the Subway Series games are largely irrelevant to the missionaries, Elders McKell and Bonella have found baseball impossible to ignore. And they have, like the ticket scalpers and merchandise hawkers, found their own, albeit much more spiritual way to capitalize on it.</p>
        <p>According to their observations, nearly two of three Bushwick residents are Yankees fans, leaving the Mets a minority in the mostly black and Hispanic neighborhood.</p>
        <p>''Pretty much, the Yankees fans say they like the tradition and history of the team,'' Elder Bonella said. ''And when people said they liked the Mets, it was because they were voting for the underdog.''</p>
        <p>A fearless works like this:</p>
        <p>''Buenos dias, senora,'' Elder McKell says to Magdelena Hermosa, 36, as she walks down Myrtle Avenue. ''Do you like the Yankees or the Mets?'' he continues in Spanish, a language he learned in two months to prepare for New York.</p>
        <p>Ms. Hermosa, confused a moment, responds, ''The Mets.''</p>
        <p>More baseball talk follows, then Elder Bonella steps in to introduce the teachings of Brigham Young and Joseph Smith.</p>
        <p>The efforts of the missionaries who preceded Elder Bonella and Elder McKell have been so successful that a Mormon church has been established at Forest Avenue and Menahan Street where, weekly, nearly 130 converts gather for prayers and English lessons.</p>
        <p>The church is a few blocks from the crash pad where Elders McKell and Bonella sleep and toy with the Foosball table they found on the street. They have no television but have listened to a game or two on the radio. Perhaps, because they are missionaries and used to facing long odds, they have felt a tug of loyalty and affection for the Mets.</p>
        <p>Elder McKell, of Valencia, Calif., and Elder Bonella, of Salt Lake City, are part of a larger team of about 150 missionaries who cover what is known as the South Mission -- Brooklyn, Long Island, Staten Island and Queens.</p>
        <p>''Southies,'' as they are called, consider their turf much cooler than the North Mission, which extends from Manhattan through the Bronx and as far north as Kingston.</p>
        <p>The separate missions get along, Elder Bonella said, but there is always good-natured ribbing. ''It's like the Yankees and the Mets,'' he added, picking up the local idiom.</p>
        <p>Both men, though, insisted that there is something special about Bushwick.</p>
        <p>''Bushwick is right on the border of Queens, so you get the best of both worlds,'' Elder Bonella said. ''From the perspective of the mission, you find the miracles of Brooklyn gradually turning into the miracles of Queens.''</p>
