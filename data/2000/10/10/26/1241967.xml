        <p>Democratic officials are voicing fears that a threatened teachers' strike in Philadelphia could hurt Vice President Al Gore's chances in Pennsylvania by suppressing voter turnout in heavily Democratic Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>On Monday, the Philadelphia Federation of Teachers announced that it planned to begin a strike tomorrow afternoon, causing Democratic officials to fear that many voters would stay away on Nov. 7 if there were still picket lines around the hundreds of schools doubling as polling places.</p>

        <p>Democratic officials are voicing fears that a threatened teachers' strike in Philadelphia could hurt Vice President Al Gore's chances in Pennsylvania by suppressing voter turnout in heavily Democratic Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>On Monday, the Philadelphia Federation of Teachers announced that it planned to begin a strike tomorrow afternoon, causing Democratic officials to fear that many voters would stay away on Nov. 7 if there were still picket lines around the hundreds of schools doubling as polling places.</p>
        <p>Pennsylvania, with 23 electoral votes, is the country's fifth-largest electoral prize and one of a half-dozen or so major battlegrounds in the 2000 campaign. Polls show Mr. Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas in a tight race in Pennsylvania, as in the rest of the country. To win the state, Mr. Gore must do well in Philadelphia to counter Mr. Bush's strength in the rest of the state.</p>
        <p>Several Democratic officials said it was odd that Philadelphia's teachers' union could hurt Mr. Gore when both the union, which represents 21,000 teachers, and its parent, the American Federation of Teachers, had endorsed the vice president.</p>
        <p>''Every vote that I don't get to the polls is a vote that I'm not able to give to Mr. Gore,'' said Jonathan A. Saidel, the city's controller and a leader of Philadelphia's Democratic Party. ''I think the turnout in Philadelphia, where we hope to bring in a 250,000-vote plurality for the Gore-Lieberman ticket, is indispensable for Gore winning Pennsylvania and the presidency.''</p>
        <p>Teachers' union officials said they in no way intended to discourage voting. But they talked as if they did not mind that the fears that a strike might hurt Mr. Gore might pressure Mayor John F. Street, a Democrat, to settle the dispute.</p>
