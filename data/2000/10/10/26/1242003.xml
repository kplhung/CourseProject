        <p>Imposing the harshest penalty ever levied by a major American professional sports league, the National Basketball Association fined the Minnesota Timberwolves $3.5 million yesterday and stripped the team of its first-round draft picks for the next five years for violating salary-cap rules.</p>
        <p>The penalties handed down by N.B.A. Commissioner David Stern follow a ruling Monday by an arbitrator that the Timberwolves had signed a secret agreement in January 1999 with Joe Smith, a star forward, that was worth as much as $86 million over seven years. At the time of the agreement, the team could not afford to pay Smith what he was worth on the open market without breaking the league's salary cap.</p>

        <p>Imposing the harshest penalty ever levied by a major American professional sports league, the National Basketball Association fined the Minnesota Timberwolves $3.5 million yesterday and stripped the team of its first-round draft picks for the next five years for violating salary-cap rules.</p>
        <p>The penalties handed down by N.B.A. Commissioner David Stern follow a ruling Monday by an arbitrator that the Timberwolves had signed a secret agreement in January 1999 with Joe Smith, a star forward, that was worth as much as $86 million over seven years. At the time of the agreement, the team could not afford to pay Smith what he was worth on the open market without breaking the league's salary cap.</p>
        <p>As a ruse, N.B.A. officials said, the Timberwolves' managers had informed league officials that they had signed Smith to only a one-year contract for $1.75 million, less than a third of what the 6-foot-10-inch player could have commanded as a free agent. The one-year contract was filed at the league offices in Manhattan, while the long-term agreement was never disclosed, they said.</p>
        <p>Stern also voided Smith's current contract with Minnesota, making him a free agent who is likely to be pursued by several teams.</p>
        <p>There was no immediate response from the Timberwolves. Ken Wipf, a team spokesman, said team officials had not been officially notified of the fine and other penalties. ''This is the first we have heard of it,'' Wipf said yesterday evening..</p>
        <p>The Timberwolves' secretive tactics reflect a widespread problem in the league, N.B.A. officials said. The stiff penalties announced yesterday were intended to send a message to team owners and player agents who attempt to undercut the salary-cap system negotiated as part of the current collective bargaining agreement, league officials said.</p>
        <p>''We have to take this stuff extremely seriously to make sure there is a competitive playing field,'' an N.B.A. official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity.</p>
        <p>For years, there have been allegations that some agents and owners were circumventing the cap, using a provision that allows a team to re-sign its own free agent after three years, even if the new contract exceeds the salary cap. The provision, known as the Larry Bird rule, was meant to enable owners to avoid having to break up a great team just to satisfy the salary restrictions.</p>
        <p>But some teams have taken advantage of the provision, signing players to three relatively inexpensive one-year contracts while promising, with a wink and a nod, a lucrative multiyear deal in the fourth year, league officials said. What are known in the league as ''Bird rights,'' or the status of a free agent after three years with one team, are considered the Holy Grail for most players.</p>
        <p>Until the Smith case, however, the league had never found a paper trail to prove the existence of a secret arrangement. In September, the league obtained copies of both Smith contracts -- the one-year deal and the secret seven-year pact. The arbitrator, Kenneth Dam, ruled Monday that the undisclosed agreement amounted to a binding contract that broke the salary-cap provisions.</p>
        <p>By voiding Smith's current contract, Stern made him a free agent. That means Smith, a power forward who was the first pick in the 1995 draft and is still considered to have immense potential, is suddenly up for grabs. The Knicks and the Miami Heat are among many teams expected to express interest in Smith.</p>
        <p>The commissioner said that he might also suspend some team officials for their role in the matter after Dam, the arbitrator who is a University of Chicago professor, determines at a second hearing who was culpable. A date for the second hearing has not been set.</p>
        <p>The Timberwolves' owner, Glen Taylor, has admitted to reporters that he signed the secret agreement, but he maintained that the team's vice president of basketball operations, Kevin McHale, and the coach, Flip Saunders, were not involved. The commissioner has the power to suspend anyone involved in the arrangement for a year.</p>
        <p>Smith's former agent, Eric Fleisher, who negotiated the secret pact, could also faces stiff penalties. Stern urged the National Basketball Player's Association, which licenses agents, to ''impose an appropriate discipline on Mr. Fleisher.'' The union could ban Fleisher from representing N.B.A. players, effectively putting him out of business.</p>
        <p>The Knicks might have a hard time persuading Smith to sign with them. New York would only be able to offer Smith $2.25 million under the team's current salary structure. The Heat may be able to offer $3.9 million, if the league agrees to a special exception to the salary cap because their center, Alonzo Mourning, is out for the season because of an illness.</p>
        <p>New York may not be able to offer Smith much playing time; he would have to compete with Kurt Thomas and Larry Johnson, both power forwards, for time on the court.</p>
        <p>The salary-cap rules have been part of the collective bargaining agreement between the league and the players' union since 1983. The cap is determined by dividing 48 percent of the league's annual revenues, less benefits for the players, among the 29 teams.</p>
        <p>There are several exceptions to the rule -- chief among them the Larry Bird provision -- that make it a very soft cap in practice. In fact, the vast majority of teams are spending more than the $35.5 million cap for this season, and some are spending as much as $75 million, union officials said.</p>
        <p>One union official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the commissioner's ruling could cripple the Minnesota franchise for years, penalizing the fans. The intent, the official said, seemed to be to deter owners from spending as much as they do now on payrolls.</p>
        <p>''He's looking to have his owners make more money by forcing them to comply with the collective bargaining agreement,'' said the union official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.</p>
