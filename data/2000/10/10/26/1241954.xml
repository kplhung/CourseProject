      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The Bush-Cheney campaign has begun showing more television commercials about education. Mindy Tucker, a campaign spokeswoman, said the advertisements were being shown in ''battleground'' states, which she would not identify. One is titled ''Expect More.''</p>
        <p>PRODUCER -- Cold Harbor Films</p>
        <p>ON THE SCREEN -- The commercial opens with a boy tossing a baseball and catching it. Then a girl is shown watching through a screened backstop. The boy reaches for the ball on the ground. Gov. George W. Bush is then shown in shirt sleeves, then with a little girl in a schoolroom, in what appears to be a campaign photo opportunity. Then children wave flags as the words ''leave no child behind'' appear on the screen. Mr. Bush then appears again, speaking, in shirt sleeves. Then a little boy in a classroom appears, followed by Mr. Bush in a suit with some adults in a classroom. Then Boy Scouts raise a flag. Finally, Mr. Bush appears again in shirt sleeves, as he finishes his comments and the words ''accountability,'' ''discipline'' and ''end social promotion'' appear on the screen. Children in half-tones wave as the commercial ends.</p>

        <p>The Bush-Cheney campaign has begun showing more television commercials about education. Mindy Tucker, a campaign spokeswoman, said the advertisements were being shown in ''battleground'' states, which she would not identify. One is titled ''Expect More.''</p>
        <p>PRODUCER -- Cold Harbor Films</p>
        <p>ON THE SCREEN -- The commercial opens with a boy tossing a baseball and catching it. Then a girl is shown watching through a screened backstop. The boy reaches for the ball on the ground. Gov. George W. Bush is then shown in shirt sleeves, then with a little girl in a schoolroom, in what appears to be a campaign photo opportunity. Then children wave flags as the words ''leave no child behind'' appear on the screen. Mr. Bush then appears again, speaking, in shirt sleeves. Then a little boy in a classroom appears, followed by Mr. Bush in a suit with some adults in a classroom. Then Boy Scouts raise a flag. Finally, Mr. Bush appears again in shirt sleeves, as he finishes his comments and the words ''accountability,'' ''discipline'' and ''end social promotion'' appear on the screen. Children in half-tones wave as the commercial ends.</p>
        <p>THE SCRIPT -- Governor Bush: ''How come the hard things don't get done? Because they're hard. If we really want to make sure no child gets left behind in America, we need the courage to do some tough things. We need to raise standards in our schools. We need more accountability and more discipline. And we need to stop promoting failing kids to the next grade because we've given up on them. It's easy just to spend more. Let's start by expecting more.''</p>
        <p>ACCURACY -- Complete. None of his simple prescriptions are remotely controversial.</p>
        <p>SCORECARD -- This advertisement was prepared and started showing before a recent study by the RAND Corporation, a California research organization, challenging the claims Mr. Bush has made about progress in education in Texas. Its pace is not as frantic as some earlier commercials. It deals with the issue that voters, regardless of whether they support Mr. Bush or Vice President Al Gore, cite more often than any other as the most important issue facing the next president and Congress. The return to this theme emphasizes the central issue that Mr. Bush has used to portray himself to voters as a different kind of Republican.</p>
