        <p>To the multitudes of everyday fans who argue that getting good seats at World Series games is all about who you know, Ron Rosenberg could be Exhibit A.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rosenberg, an executive with Merrill Lynch Investment Managers, received an unsolicited invitation to attend Game 2 with a client, and he left Yankee Stadium on Sunday night with a piece of one of Mike Piazza's shattered bats. The client happened to be John W. Henry, a hedge-fund manager who is owner of the Florida Marlins and a minority owner of the Yankees, and the seats were close enough to the action for Mr. Rosenberg to ask a batboy for a souvenir to die for.</p>
        <p>''It was totally unexpected and it was a thrill,'' said Mr. Rosenberg, a lifelong Mets fan who said he was born the same year as the team, 1962. He still sounded giddy about the experience three days later, even though he said he might accede to Piazza's suggestion that the bat be auctioned off for charity.</p>
        <p>But if Mr. Rosenberg's brush with celebrity highlighted the simple truth that it can help to have powerful friends or associates when in search of tickets to the first Subway Series in 44 years, it also illuminated a perhaps less appreciated reality.</p>
        <p>Yes, lots of tickets at these games have gone to corporate sponsors, but that doesn't mean they are easy to come by. Mr. Rosenberg, after all, had considered himself a long shot for his own company's corporate tickets and went only because a client had taken him.</p>
        <p>And so for the most part, the people with the best views of the action at Shea and Yankee Stadiums have been either the most influential employees of corporate sponsors or the guests they are splurging on in box seats and luxury suites. The corporate infighting for tickets has been intense over the last week, and the scramble at Merrill Lynch was no exception.</p>
        <p>Merrill Lynch's chairman and chief executive, David Komansky, grew up in the Bronx rooting for the Yankees and would have been a fixture near the home team's dugout at Yankee Stadium. But he and his senior management team left for Japan last Friday, and that set off an in-house tussle for the tickets.</p>
        <p>Merrill Lynch wasn't alone. Craig Masone, a sales director for Teligent, was among those who got crowded out in the fight for corporate seats. A fervent Mets fan, Mr. Masone said he attended several games at Shea this season, but he never had a shot at his employer's World Series tickets. After hearing from friends that scalpers were asking $1,000 to $3,000 for mediocre seats, he gave up hope, he said.</p>
        <p>Not surprisingly, companies, even multimillion-dollar ones, do not hand out tickets that are worth more than $1,000 to people without careful consideration and, in some cases, a bit of contention.</p>
        <p>Rod King, a vice president of Fuji Photo Film U.S.A., said the two most important criteria for deciding who got his company's tickets along the third-base line at Shea Stadium were, in order, how good a customer someone was and how serious a fan he was. But, he added, ''sometimes it comes down to who screams the loudest.''</p>
        <p>This week, Mr. King said, he has heard customers who are native New Yorkers screaming from as far away as Chicago.</p>
        <p>Fuji, which pays for an advertising sign at Shea, has box seats at Yankee Stadium and a luxury suite for some regular-season games at Shea. But for this week's games at Shea, Fuji officials had to settle for scattered seats and bought additional seats through ticket brokers to appease demanding customers, Mr. King said.</p>
        <p>And who was Mr. King, who confessed a devotion to the Cincinnati Reds, rooting for last night? In the spirit of commerce, he said, ''I'm praying for them to continue so my sign gets more exposure.''</p>
        <p>Another senior executive of a corporate sponsor of the Mets also had to make the best of seats inferior to those his company owned. But he didn't seem too inconvenienced. Frank Petrilli, the president of the online brokerage T. D. Waterhouse, found himself sitting next to the comedian Chris Rock during Game 4 last night. Both were guests of the Mets.</p>
        <p>T. D. Waterhouse pays for electronic stock tickers near the Shea Stadium foul poles and has a set of seats near first base. But the company surprised some of its most active stock traders by giving them those tickets, leaving Mr. Petrilli, the president and a Bronx native, several rows farther back. ''I can come back tomorrow night if I want,'' he said.</p>
