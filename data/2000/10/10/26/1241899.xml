        <p>THE baseball playoffs are over. Behind the veteran pitcher Charles Manson, the Psychedelphia Woodstockings defeated the Speed City Velocitors and their star second baseman, the Apollo 11 command module, in the decisive fifth game. The Woodsox are now likely to face Cyd Charisse, the Paradise Pisces' high-kicking hurler, when the Universal Series opens on Nov. 23.</p>
        <p>Hallucinations induced by New York's baseball fever? No, this is the Cosmic Baseball Association, a fantasy-baseball site for those who favor intellectual pursuits over actual baseball.</p>
        <p>Compared with typical fantasy-baseball leagues, in which a virtual team's success in the standings depends on its major league players' real-world performance, the C.B.A. (www.cosmicbaseball.com) is purely imaginary. A computer program is used to simulate games between teams of the famous and infamous), fictional characters, interesting numbers, popular songs and other thematically related rosters.</p>
        <p>The Woodstockings lineup, for example, includes Eldridge Cleaver, Betty Friedan and other heavy hitters from the 1960's. When the highly mobile Velocitors turn a double play, it involves the Columbia space shuttle at shortstop, the 1911 Wright Model B airplane at second and, anchored at first base, the Titanic. Pisces players share an astrological sign, so their current outfield is right fielder John Steinbeck, center fielder Drew Barrymore and, out in left field, Steve Jobs. The Numeral City Numbers are populated by pi, the square root of 2 and, of course, .406.</p>
        <p>The C.B.A. is the invention of Andrew Lampert, a 48-year-old Silver Spring, Md., resident who hungers more for psychic satisfaction than for peanuts and Cracker Jacks. Mr. Lampert asserts that baseball, with its vast network of people and events, fanatically kept histories and  human dramas, functions as a metaphor for the life of the mind.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lampert founded the C.B.A. during the 1981 baseball strike. In the league's early years, he mailed game reports to a few dozen associates. But after he discovered the Web and its ability to connect far-flung ideas, he put up a site in 1994.</p>
        <p>''The whole concept of the C.B.A. was perfectly designed for the Web,'' Mr. Lampert said. ''It couldn't really express itself in any other way.''</p>
        <p>He said most visitors arrived at the C.B.A. site while clicking on search-engine results. ''They get to it because they're looking up Luis Bunuel or Andy Warhol,'' he said. (Bunuel is a Pisces pitcher; Warhol is a third baseman for the Bhutan Vanguards, a team of artists.)</p>
        <p>Box scores document each game, and results can take on a deeper meaning. Is it only a coincidence that the Dharma Beats, whose members' literary offerings are no longer as fervently worshiped as before, were C.B.A. cellar dwellers this season? Isn't it true that Van Morrison's hit song ''Moondance'' is still good for the occasional grand slam?</p>
        <p>Mr. Lampert said Robert Coover's 1968 novel, ''The Universal Baseball Association, Inc., J. Henry Waugh, Prop.,'' which imbued the sport with cosmological significance, had inspired the league's birth. In the C.B.A., the book's protagonist, J. Henry Waugh, pitches for the Fictionals; he had a 3-3 record with the team in 1998.</p>
        <p>After visiting the site, Mr. Coover said he had been entertained by the C.B.A.'s ability to refract the world's weirdness ''through the sane prism of baseball.'' Like a manager opining in a postgame interview, he analyzed his fictional character's mediocre online performance: ''Henry Waugh's problem as a pitcher is that he is encumbered with so vast an overview of the game that he cannot always see home plate.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lampert said another important factor in the C.B.A.'s creation had been Strat-O-Matic, the baseball-simulation game of his youth. The game came with cards representing how players had performed in the past, and a few blanks were included. Rather than use the blanks for rookies, as intended, Mr. Lampert would instead substitute Nietzsche or other oddball choices.</p>
        <p>''Socrates played for the Red Sox,'' he recalled.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lampert used Strat-O-Matic to simulate games in the C.B.A.'s first seasons. As he became interested in computing, a friend gave him a copy of ''Basic for Baseball Buffs,'' a 1986 primer on the Basic programming language.</p>
        <p>The book led him to develop Simbat and Simpit, his own baseball simulation programs. He now uses them to generate games, incorporating variables like injuries, weather and morale.</p>
        <p>As in the majors, C.B.A. teams play 162 games per season. Over time, there have been 41 teams and nearly 2,500 players. The highest single-season batting average, .497, is held by Warren G. Harding of the Washington Presidents. The Presidents' players tend to stay on its roster for years, although President Clinton spent last season on the ''morally disabled'' list. At present, Al Gore and George W. Bush are neck and neck in a home-run derby that will earn the winner a lineup spot in 2001.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lampert, who still attends five or six real major-league baseball games every year, has created most of the C.B.A.'s teams. He recently added a Personal Cosmic Game feature to the site that lets visitors submit their own nine-player rosters and simulate games against C.B.A. teams or opponents of their own devising.</p>
        <p>The combatants might include favorite movies against favorite television shows, family members versus in-laws, stops for the No. 4 train against stops on the No. 7.</p>
        <p>As Ken Starr, a C.B.A. umpire, might bark, ''Play ball!''</p>
