        <p>German import prices soared 13.4 percent in September, compared with a year earlier, the biggest jump since 1981, the government reported. The increase was higher than most economists had expected and reflected the combined impact of high oil prices and the sinking euro. Coming just a day after the German government reported a sharp rise in producer prices, the news raised new fears about inflation throughout the 11-nation region that has adopted the euro as a common currency. The weak euro is pushing up the price of all imports from outside the euro zone. Though oil  prices were the biggest reason for higher import prices, economists noted that prices for other imports rose at a steep monthly rate of 0.9 percent.</p>
