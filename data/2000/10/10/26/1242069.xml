        <p>Verizon's decision to let people list personal e-mail addresses in the phone directory is ill conceived (''New Media Meets Old Media in the Phone Book,'' Oct. 26).

        <p>A day doesn't go by without my receiving multiple solicitations to invest in get-rich-quick schemes or to purchase these lists so I can spam others. Unlike regular junk mail, there is no cost to the sender. It would be foolhardy to invite junk e-mail by listing your address.</p>
