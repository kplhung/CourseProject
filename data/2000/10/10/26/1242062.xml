        <p>The top deputy at the city's Human Resources Administration, following the lead of his boss, has admitted that he violated the city conflict of interest laws and has agreed to pay a $8,500 fine.</p>
        <p>The deputy, Mark S. Hoover, admitted in a statement released yesterday that he violated the law by renting four Long Island City apartments that he owned to Human Resources employees, at one point taking a $500 rent payment financed by the city. Mr. Hoover also admitted that he used a staff member and city equipment to work on a private business contract.</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>The top deputy at the city's Human Resources Administration, following the lead of his boss, has admitted that he violated the city conflict of interest laws and has agreed to pay a $8,500 fine.</p>
        <p>The deputy, Mark S. Hoover, admitted in a statement released yesterday that he violated the law by renting four Long Island City apartments that he owned to Human Resources employees, at one point taking a $500 rent payment financed by the city. Mr. Hoover also admitted that he used a staff member and city equipment to work on a private business contract.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hoover's admission is the latest twist in what has been a roller coaster of a month for the city's social services agency. Its top two executives have now been separately reprimanded by the Conflicts of Interest Board for using their offices for private gain. In between these two announcements, a state appeals court on Tuesday resoundingly rejected nine-month-old allegations first raised by Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi that a company that was awarded $104 million worth of welfare-to-work contracts had been given unfair access to the city bidding process.</p>
        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani celebrated the court victory yesterday and defended Mr. Hoover and his boss, Jason A. Turner, the Human Resources Administration commissioner, for what he called a ''technical violation of the rules.''</p>
        <p>''There are conflict of interest rules that say, 'If I walk over here and I don't do it exactly this way, I have violated the rules,' '' Mr. Giuliani said at a news conference at Shea Stadium. ''That is what you have here.''</p>
        <p>Joan R. Salzman, chief of enforcement at the Conflicts of Interest board, disputed the mayor's remarks. ''If somebody is trying to add up how much money the city lost, that is not the point,'' she said. ''There is no price tag on public integrity. The point is: What is confidence in public officials worth?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hoover's fine, disclosed by city officials yesterday, is larger than the $6,500 penalty paid on Oct. 13 by Mr. Turner. It is the third largest fine set by the board since new ethics rules took effect in 1990.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hoover, the agency's first deputy commissioner, admitted in the statement that during 1998 and 1999, five of his subordinates and Mr. Turner rented rooms in his apartments at the City Lights co-op building, a high-rise on the East River in Long Island City.</p>
        <p>City law prohibits supervisors from entering into financial pacts with superiors or subordinates, a provision intended to prevent coercion or favoritism in the city workplace.</p>
        <p>A second violation occurred when Mr. Hoover accepted a $100-a-day room and board payment from one of his tenants, Paul Saeman. The money came indirectly from the city in its agreement to pay lodging and food costs. Mr. Hoover had earlier hired Mr. Saeman as a consultant to the agency, meaning the payment to Mr. Hoover, amounting to $500, ''violated the law against using official position for private gain,'' a conflict of interest board statement issued yesterday said.</p>
        <p>''He had no business taking anything for his own pocket,'' Ms. Salzman said.</p>
        <p>Finally, Mr. Hoover instructed Mr. Saeman to help him prepare a document for a private contract in Arizona that he was working on with Mr. Turner, using city office equipment to complete the task one afternoon, again a violation of city law. Mr. Turner had admitted to similar offenses, using city equipment and a staff member for private business, among other violations.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hoover did not respond yesterday to a request for comment. In his statement, he acknowledged that asking Mr. Saeman to help handle his private business matter could be seen as a ''financial gain,'' continuing that ''I acknowledge that my conduct in using city personnel and resources, even on a limited basis, violated New York City Charter'' and conflict of interest rules.</p>
        <p>The living arrangements among the Human Resources Administration staff arose after Mr. Turner had recruited a handful of colleagues from Wisconsin, where he helped run the state welfare system.</p>
        <p>Mr. Turner, appointed in early 1998 by Mr. Giuliani to bring his aggressive welfare-roll trimming to New York City, ended up sharing, at different times, three of Mr. Hoover's apartments, with at least three other Wisconsin transplants, including Mr. Saeman, Deputy Commissioner Jean Sheil and Michael O'Malley, Mr. Turner's chief of staff.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani said Mr. Hoover and Mr. Turner were singled out for intense criticism because of his administration's effort to trim the welfare rolls by nudging welfare recipients toward self-sufficiency.</p>
        <p>''The reason this thing is exaggerated,'' the mayor said, ''is purely because of the anger at Jason Turner and at Mark for what they are doing, what they are trying to accomplish, because people oppose it, people don't like it.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Hevesi, the city comptroller, said yesterday that the scrutiny  was entirely justified. He said he was ''stunned and surprised'' by the ruling on Tuesday by Appellate Division of the State Supreme Court, which found ''no evidence'' that Maximus Inc. of Virginia had been given unfair access to the bidding on welfare contracts, as Mr. Hevesi had alleged.</p>
        <p>But he noted that his office had spoken yesterday with the United States attorney's office, which confirmed that a criminal investigation of Mr. Turner and Maximus was ''active and open.''</p>
        <p>''Regardless of the court's decision, I am absolutely convinced the selection of Maximus was inappropriate,'' Mr. Hevesi said. ''We produced reams of documentation that Maximus benefited from insider information and we painted an absolutely clear picture of cronyism and favoritism.''</p>
        <p>The appeals panel agreed with Mr. Hevesi that Maximus officials had contact with top city officials before the contract was formally advertised last year, but the five justices said these discussions were of a ''general nature'' that did not give the company an advantage.</p>
        <p>Maximus executives, who said they considered Tuesday's ruling a vindication, said late yesterday that they were still unsure what would happen to the $104 million in contracts that were suspended. ''The city will have to determine what is the most beneficial role Maximus can play in the welfare-to-work effort,'' said Rachael Rowland, a Maximus spokeswoman.</p>
