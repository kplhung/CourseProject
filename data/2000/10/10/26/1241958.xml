        <p>NORTHERN IRELAND: I.R.A. ARMS INSPECTION  The Irish Republican Army said it would permit a second inspection of its secret arms dumps by two international monitors, Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa and Martti Ahtisaari of Finland. The confidence-building move came on the eve of a visit to Belfast by Prime Minister Tony Blair and days before a meeting of the largest Protestant party, the Ulster Unionists, over whether to remain in a power-sharing government with Sinn Fein, the I.R.A.'s political wing.</p>

        <p>IRELAND: EQUALITY ACT IN EFFECT  The Equal Status Act went into effect to protect citizens against discrimination based on gender, sexual orientation, disability and religion, as well as to protect Gypsies against bias. The act, applying to both the public and private sectors, creates a government position to handle complaints. The government recently faced criticism after the Supreme Court ruled it had failed to provide adequate educational facilities for an autistic child.</p>

        <p>AUSTRIA: HOLOCAUST MEMORIAL  A monument was dedicated in Vienna to the 65,000 Austrian Jews who died in the Holocaust, an event delayed for several years by disputes over location and design. Neither Chancellor Wolfgang Schussel nor his deputy, Susanne Riess-Passer, head of the far-right Freedom Party, were invited. The 12-foot-high monument, representing bookshelves with the pages facing outward, was designed by the British artist Rachel Whiteread.</p>
        <p>Victor Homola (NYT)</p>
        <p>AUSTRIA: HAIDER INVESTIGATION  Public prosecutors said they were investigating whether the far-right leader Jorg Haider received confidential police files about political foes. The allegations came to light in a book by a former police officer and Freedom Party activist, who said the police had been bribed to hand over information. Mr. Haider denied it.</p>

        <p>GREECE: APPEAL ON GERMAN ASSETS  A court began hearings on a new appeal by Germany against a decision to confiscate its assets in Greece to compensate victims of the Nazis. In October 1997 a Greek court ordered Germany to pay more than $42 million in compensation to 295 descendants of 218 residents of the village of Distomo who were slain in 1944. In July a Greek bailiff began seizing assets at the German Archeological Institute and the Goethe Institute in Athens, but stopped until the appeal is heard.</p>

        <p>FRANCE: CONCORDE INQUIRY  The head of a French technical team investigating the crash of the Air France Concorde in July said that a metal strip that is thought to have caused the disaster definitely came from a Continental DC-10 that had been on the runway minutes before. The strip is believed to have sliced a Concorde tire on takeoff, causing chunks of rubber to punch through fuel tanks. Air France said last month that it intended to sue Continental.</p>

        <p>CANADA: LIBERALS LEADING  As the five political parties campaigned toward the Nov. 27 election, the governing Liberals were heartened by a poll showing them with a 27-point lead over the largest opposition group, the conservative Canadian Alliance. The poll showed the Liberals with the support of 48 percent of voters, and the Alliance with 21 percent.</p>

        <p>EGYPT: MUBARAK PARTY GAINS  President Hosni Mubarak's National Democratic Party appeared likely to maintain its overwhelming parliamentary majority, Egyptian state television reported after vote-counting in the first stage of elections. Party supporters, running as independents or on the party list, were said to have won 118 of the 150 seats decided so far. Elections are being held in three phases, with voting for 294 more seats to be held next Sunday and Nov. 8.</p>

        <p>ZIMBABWE: IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDINGS  The opposition Movement for Democratic Change began impeachment proceedings against President Robert Mugabe, 76. The party, which poses the strongest challenge yet to Mr. Mugabe's 20-year rule, holds 57 of 150 seats in Parliament, meeting the one-third requirement to propose impeachment, but falling far short of the two-thirds needed to impeach. The party says the motion will create a platform for public debate about his presidency, which many Zimbabweans blame for the country's economic and political crisis.</p>

        <p>ASIA</p>
        <p>INDONESIA: THREAT TO U.S. EMBASSY  Waving banners and chanting ''Kill all Jews,'' hundreds of Islamic students demonstrated at the United States Embassy in Jakarta, which suspended visa and consular services because of terrorist threats. An embassy spokesman said the United States had received ''a credible threat,'' but he declined to elaborate. Suspended services are scheduled to resume on Monday. Protesters have accused the United States of favoring Israel in the recent Middle East violence.</p>

        <p>PHILIPPINES: PRESIDENT URGED TO QUIT  Tens of thousands of people marched in several cities calling on President Joseph Estrada to resign over allegations that he has been involved in gambling schemes. Vice President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, left, said the president should go to prevent the economy from collapsing, and said she was prepared to take over. ''As of now, sad to say, the solution is resignation,'' she said. ''There is no other solution.''</p>
        <p>(Reuters)</p>
        <p>SRI LANKA: MOB KILLS 24  A mob stormed a detention center, leaving 24 inmates dead. All were surrendered Tamil Tigers or suspected of belonging to the rebel group. Army officials expressed shock at the massacre, which was seen as a major blow to a government-run rehabilitation program.</p>
