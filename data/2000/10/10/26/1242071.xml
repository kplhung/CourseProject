        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''Printing Envelopes Presents a Problem for Desktop Computers'' (Oct. 19): Is it really true that Word users have to go through all those moves just to address an envelope? Once again I thank the computer deity who gave me, in my earliest word-processing days, WordPerfect -- and kept me ignorant of the fact that everyone else was using Word.</p>
        <p>In my innocence, I just kept using newer versions of WordPerfect, and the result is that with two mouse clicks, I can get an envelope addressed and feed it through a run-of-the-mill inkjet printer. With a laser printer at my office (nothing fancy, but O.K.) and the same WordPerfect, it goes even more smoothly.</p>
        <p>Until I read the article today I never knew that envelopes were a problem for all those benighted Word users. I cannot for the life of me understand why everyone puts up with Word. Just because it comes with Windows? Not reason enough. I wish people would wise up before WordPerfect goes out of production, or whatever good undervalued programs do, and I also wind up with Word.</p>
