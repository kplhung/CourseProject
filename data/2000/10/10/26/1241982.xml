        <p>Struggle to Keep Domain Namesake</p>
        <p>Now Madonna.com is taking MADONNA to court.</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Struggle to Keep Domain Namesake</p>
        <p>Now Madonna.com is taking MADONNA to court.</p>
        <p>Last week, the entertainer won an arbitration ruling against DAN PARISI, an entrepreneur who develops Web sites and who controls the domain name madonna.com.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, in an effort to keep from having to transfer madonna.com to Madonna, Mr. Parisi filed a lawsuit against her.</p>
        <p>Mr. Parisi's lawyer, MICHAEL J. CALVEY, said that Mr. Parisi wants to donate the domain name to the Madonna Rehabilitation Hospital in Lincoln, Neb., and had made arrangements to do so even before Madonna brought the arbitration case.</p>
        <p>Mr. Calvey also said that Mr. Parisi, who acquired  madonna.com in 1998, shut down the Web site in the spring. Mr. Calvey said that for a time, madonna.com had been linked to another site that displayed pornography. ''It had other things on it from time to time,'' he said. ''It never really drew that much traffic.''</p>
        <p>In the arbitration proceeding, Madonna had accused Mr. Parisi of ''cybersquatting'' and of ''unauthorized, bad faith registration and use'' of madonna.com. Mr. Calvey denied that. Madonna's spokeswoman, LIZ ROSENBERG, did not respond to a telephone call seeking comment.</p>
        <p>Putting Diplomacy To a Melody</p>
        <p>The singer JUDY COLLINS thought diplomacy when she was handed a message the other day that said the United States ambassador to the United Nations, RICHARD C. HOLBROOKE, had called. Maybe he would ask her to fly to the Middle East and help mediate.</p>
        <p>''I thought, what is this urgent message, because when Richard Holbrooke calls, you jump,'' Ms. Collins said yesterday. ''Really, I was concerned about what could have happened: is there some crisis I should know about? Maybe they are sending a delegation of the arts.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Holbrooke wanted a one-person delegation -- specifically, Ms. Collins -- but he was not looking for another negotiator. He was giving a dinner for HARRY BELAFONTE and several ambassadors at his official residence in the Waldorf Towers. He wanted her to sing ''Scarlet Ribbons,'' which became a hit after Mr. Belafonte recorded it in the 1950's.</p>
        <p>First Ms. Collins had to learn it. ''I'd never sung it before,'' she said. ''And then when I sang it, I thought, 'This is such a magical song.' It's a description of an act of faith, an act of magic, and that's what's needed in this whole negotiation, and the perfect thing that Harry had sung all those years ago.''</p>
        <p>Glimpsing 'Angels,' Moguls and Models</p>
        <p>The stars of the film ''Charlie's Angels'' -- CAMERON DIAZ, DREW BARRYMORE and LUCY LIU -- were late for the premiere on Tuesday night, leaving the crowd outside the Ziegfeld Theater on West 54th Street to cheer for anyone recognizable. HARVEY WEINSTEIN, a co-chairman of Miramax, fit the bill -- this was, after all, a crowd that knows its movie moguls. So when he arrived, the crowd began chanting, ''Har-vey, Har-vey, Har-vey.''</p>
        <p>Eventually Ms. Diaz, Ms. Barrymore and Ms. Liu arrived, not in a limousine but in a bus. Ms. Barrymore said that the movie ''was fun to make'' but had been ''hard work.'' She said that she had the bruises to prove it. There was no time to explain: The lights went down, and the screening began.</p>
        <p>When the lights came back up, the crowd went to a party at Henri Bendel, the department store a couple of blocks away, on Fifth Avenue near 56th Street. The cosmetics counters and jewelry cases had been covered with black sheets, and there was a long line at the ladies' room. So someone who was with CLAUDIA SCHIFFER blocked off the men's room without realizing that SAM TABAR, a 28-year-old Columbia University law student, was inside, at the sink. ''You know, you don't look like a guy,'' he said he told Ms. Schiffer when she walked in.</p>
