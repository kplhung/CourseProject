        <p>Stung by torrents of criticism of the giant Three Gorges Dam being built on the Yangtze River, Chinese officials announced today that construction and population resettlement were proceeding smoothly, and that costs were well within budget.</p>
        <p>The dam, which will create the world's largest hydroelectric project and a huge new lake in central China, is to begin operation in 2003. By the time the reservoir reaches maximum height in 2008, more than 1.1 million people must be moved, according to government estimates restated today. The officially projected cost is $25 billion, but officials said today it may be lower thanks to stable prices.</p>
        <p>The project has been widely criticized for threatening the environment, inundating archaeological treasures and dislocating so many people, who are mostly being resettled in an already overcrowded area.</p>
        <p>But the government has pressed ahead, linking the success of the project to China's prestige, and today officials belittled the reports of serious problems. ''The project is progressing smoothly,'' said Guo Shuyan, deputy director of the State Council Three Gorges committee.</p>
        <p>Through August, the officials said, 253,200 people had been relocated. The officials called recent reports of popular protests ''exaggerated'' and dismissed concerns about the future market for electricity.</p>
        <p>The relocation program has also been plagued by corruption. Today,  officials said misused funds through 1998 accounted for 8.8 percent of  resettlement expenditures, but said some of this was not stolen but spent in violation of procedures.</p>
