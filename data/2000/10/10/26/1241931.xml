        <p>The telecommunications dispute between the United States and Mexico that has simmered for most of this year involves pennies. But since those pennies add up to hundreds of millions of dollars a year in interconnection fees, this has become one of the thorniest trade squabbles to test relations between the two nations.</p>
        <p>American trade officials have gone so far as to threaten to drag Mexico before the World Trade Organization to force Mexican regulators to level the playing field for competitors, including some with American partners, that are seeking part of the country's $12 billion telecommunications market.</p>
        <p>There has been a bit of detente recently. Mexican officials agreed early this month to lower interconnection rates, fees charged to long-distance companies by local carriers, to 1.25 cents a minute from 3.36 cents. And last month they put new rules into effect that could force Telefonos de Mexico, the former national phone monopoly widely known as Telmex, to more strongly embrace open competition.</p>
        <p>So United States officials have decided to hold off action. A 60-day waiting period for proceeding with the W.T.O. complaint ended on Oct. 17 and the trade officials decided not to go ahead with the complaint -- at least not now.</p>
        <p>But tensions remain. ''If we don't feel that our concerns are being adequately addressed,'' said Brendan Daly, a spokesman for the United States trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky, ''we have the right to bring a case before the W.T.O. and we will not hesitate to do so.''</p>
        <p>Telmex has agreed to honor the new rates, but the company has challenged them in the Mexican courts. The rules enable regulators to treat dominant companies like Telmex differently from smaller companies to foster competition.</p>
        <p>Carrying out the new regulations ''would result in higher prices for consumers while depriving them of the benefits of Telmex's increased productivity,'' the company said in a statement. ''The only beneficiaries will be the competing companies, which will be able to increase profits because of undeserved advantages that actually harm the national interests.''</p>
        <p>United States officials think that Telmex still looks and acts too much like a monopoly. They say that in the years that the Mexican long-distance phone market has been open to competition, Telmex first lost, then began regaining market share. It now controls 81 percent of long-distance customers, up from a low around 70 percent. It also, they say, has more than 95 percent of the market for local phone service, which was opened to competition last year.</p>
        <p>As the cross-border dispute continues, one of the handful of competing local phone service start-up companies in Mexico, Axtel, has added a twist -- accusing the rival companies with United States partners of doing their best to stifle competition by using some of the tactics for which they are criticizing Telmex.</p>
        <p>''We've been caught in the middle of a battle,'' said Carlos Escalante, director of regulatory affairs for Axtel, which provides local phone service in Monterrey and Mexico City. Axtel phones are wireless and quickly installed because they are not connected to the existing copper-line grid.</p>
        <p>The two American-related long-distance companies are Alestra, in which AT&amp;T holds a 49 percent ownership stake, and Avantel which has WorldCom as a 45 percent partner. They entered the Mexican market in 1997, seven years after Telmex was first sold to private owners, and have invested heavily to build networks all over the country.</p>
        <p>They say they are struggling to become profitable in part because Telmex has used its position as the dominant local and long-distance carrier in Mexico to hinder competition and persuade government regulators to act in its favor. Specifically, they say that Telmex has occasionally refused to provide access to its network or sometimes provided lines of inferior quality. And until recently, they complained that Telmex charged excessive interconnection fees.</p>
        <p>All long-distance companies pay local carriers for the originating and terminating parts of calls they handle. Thus, under the old rates, Telmex could receive 3.36 cents a minute for a long-distance call made on its lines, and 3.36 cents a minute more if the call ended in one of its local-service areas.</p>
        <p>Alestra and Avantel had accused Telmex of ignoring international conventions, signed by Mexican officials, that are intended to keep such rates as low as possible to encourage competition. Further, they say Mexican regulators have in large part ignored the issue.</p>
        <p>Regulators in the United States and Mexico both say this is a public policy question, not just a matter of corporate interests. Despite the privatization of Telmex, the arrival of competing companies and a sharp increase in Internet use, Mexico remains one of the world's least wired nations, with about 10 lines for each 100 people, compared with 60 per 100 in the United States.</p>
        <p>AT&amp;T and WorldCom have aggressively made their cases known to Mexican and American officials, and have dogged the office of the United States trade representative.</p>
        <p>The complaint from Axtel against Alestra and Avantel has received less attention.</p>
        <p>Axtel, which competes with Telmex on the local level, contends that Alestra and Avantel are not taking into account the impact that lower interconnection fees can have on Telmex's local-service competitors. Axtel officials say they based their business plans on fees as high as 5 cents a minute -- a level needed, they say, to generate enough resources to help them grow and significantly increase the number of phone lines. They also say Alestra and Avantel have so far refused to sign interconnection contracts with their company.</p>
        <p>In a statement in March, Axtel officials accused Alestra and Avantel of trying to restrain the opening of Mexico's telecommunications market. ''Instead of encouragement, Axtel and other independent telcos now face interconnection obstacles that have been thrown up by the very carriers that have unfurled the banner of competition in Mexico,'' the statement said.</p>
        <p>Jim Talbot, a lawyer at AT&amp;T, Alestra's partner, said he found it hard to understand Axtel's argument. ''Mexico made commitments two years ago to open its market and it simply has not done so,'' he said. Mr. Talbot added that Alestra had agreed to route the calls from Axtel customers through its long-distance network even without a formal contract so service would not be disrupted.</p>
        <p>The American companies point out that Axtel has its own foreign partner, Bell Canada International, which also recently entered into a Latin American joint venture with Telmex. (The regional Bell giant SBC Communications owns 8.5 percent of Telmex.)</p>
        <p>''We don't have to speculate a lot, then, to see that there is a connection in their relationship,'' Raul Ortega, an Alestra spokesman, said of Axtel, Bell Canada and Telmex.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Escalante of Axtel said it was absurd to think that his company was shilling for Telmex. ''In this time of alliances, mergers and acquisitions, everybody has a relationship with everybody else,'' he said. ''But Telmex has no common ground with us.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  October 31, 2000, Tuesday  A chart in Business Day on Thursday tracing major acquisitions and divestitutes by AT&amp;T since its breakup in 1984 omitted two companies. In 1994 AT&amp;T acquired McCaw Cellular, which became the basis for its wireless phone business. In 1998 it bought I.B.M.'s Global Network business, which has become an important part of its business services division.</p>
