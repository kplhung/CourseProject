        <p>Shares of AstraZeneca of Britain fell after the company lowered estimates for full-year sales and said its Losec ulcer medicine was facing growing competition in the United States. AstraZeneca reported operating profit for the third quarter of $976 million, including exceptional items, compared with $949 million last year. Sales grew 3 percent, to $4.3 billion. Tom McKillop, chief financial officer, said in a statement that sales for the year would grow about 8 percent, below the 10 percent analysts had been expecting. AstraZeneca's results are in contrast to those of Sanofi-Synthelabo of France, which said third-quarter sales jumped 14 percent; and Akzo Nobel of the Netherlands, which reported a 36 percent rise in sales for the period.</p>
