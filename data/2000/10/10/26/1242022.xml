        <p>If Vice President Al Gore has failed to close the sale with some voters on policy grounds, like promising to put the Medicare surplus in a lockbox, he has now come up with a few new arguments.</p>
        <p>First, there is the notion that Mr. Gore does not care about making money and never has. Not like some oil speculators and baseball team owners he could mention. And this apparently is a good thing, even though many Americans would love to have made $15 million by selling a baseball team, as Gov. George W. Bush did when his partnership sold the Texas Rangers in 1998.</p>

        <p>If Vice President Al Gore has failed to close the sale with some voters on policy grounds, like promising to put the Medicare surplus in a lockbox, he has now come up with a few new arguments.</p>
        <p>First, there is the notion that Mr. Gore does not care about making money and never has. Not like some oil speculators and baseball team owners he could mention. And this apparently is a good thing, even though many Americans would love to have made $15 million by selling a baseball team, as Gov. George W. Bush did when his partnership sold the Texas Rangers in 1998.</p>
        <p>''I have not spent the last quarter century in pursuit of personal wealth,'' Mr. Gore told a crowd in Everett, Wash., on Monday. ''I have spent the last 24 years fighting for middle-class working families.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's aversion to wealth apparently has the approval of his wife, Tipper. ''This is a man who has spent his time not getting up every day figuring out how much money he can make for himself,'' Mrs. Gore said in introducing her husband in Little Rock, Ark., on Tuesday, ''but figuring out how he can fight for working people.''</p>
        <p>Still not persuaded? Maybe that is because you were not aware that Mr. Gore has attended all of his son's high school football games this fall, despite his rigorous campaign schedule. The Gores had kept politics and football separate until this week, when an article in The New York Times documented the vice president's devotion to the Sidwell Friends Quakers. Now they seem to have concluded that it is a story worth telling.</p>
        <p>''He has made every single one of our son's football games,'' Mrs. Gore said at a rally on Tuesday in Shreveport, La., in remarks aimed directly at women. ''I don't really want to share that with everybody. It's personal. But it matters.''</p>
        <p>Kitchen Cabinet Meetings</p>
        <p>For each of the last three mornings, Mr. Gore has gone about the task of making pretty pictures by holding ''kitchen table'' discussions with voters. None have actually taken place at a kitchen table, but that is beside the point. On Monday, he sat down at a bakery in Portland, Ore., with a small business owner; on Tuesday in Little Rock, he helped Bobbie and Mollie Goza walk their two children to elementary school; today, in Nashville, he sat down with the guys at a local firehouse.</p>
        <p>Such camera-friendly encounters with ''real people'' have become a campaign staple for Mr. Gore, who spent numerous nights at teachers' homes and took walks on a Florida beach with 13 citizen advisers to help prepare for the debates.</p>
        <p>Some moments have been so staged as to appear campy, like Mr. Gore's stroll to school with the Gozas, who typically do not walk their children the few blocks to Thomas Jefferson Elementary. And the conversation, or at least the snippets that reporters have made out from a distance, has often been less than edifying.</p>
        <p>''Ian, you're really in kindergarten?'' Mr. Gore asked the Gozas' 5-year-old son, who nodded affirmatively.</p>
        <p>Then there was Mr. Gore's reaction to discovering a rubber Halloween spider in a planter of yellow chrysanthemums on the Gozas' doorstep. ''Yikes!'' he said. ''That's scary.''</p>
        <p>But whether Mr. Gore's words make news is also beside the point. Thus far, the gimmick has worked precisely as intended. In both Portland and Little Rock, pictures of the kitchen-table moments landed on the front pages of local newspapers and were featured prominently in local television broadcasts. The national television networks have also made liberal use of the images, and a picture of Mr. Gore with the Gozas appeared today in The New York Times.</p>
        <p>Swinging for Fence-sitters</p>
        <p>After two years of campaigning -- some would say after eight years of campaigning -- it is not every day that Mr. Gore gets a question he has yet to consider.</p>
        <p>But while speaking to a few reporters on Air Force II on Tuesday, Mr. Gore was confronted with one of the great queries of our time. ''What do you think of the designated hitter?'' asked Bill Douglas of Newsday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore had already taken an expedient pass on the question of which team he likes in the World Series, saying ''I'm for New York.'' Now, said the reporters on the plane, Mr. Gore paused for 20 to 30 seconds, as if calculating the swing-state impact of his response on undecided voters in various American League and National League cities.</p>
        <p>Finally, he answered, sort of: ''I haven't really given it a lot of considered thought. I'm tempted to take the purists view that it's, you know, a dilution of the pure game. But I don't know enough about the reasons for it to make a harsh critique. Based on what I know at this point, I'm not in favor of it.''</p>
