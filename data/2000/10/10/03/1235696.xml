        <p>Maybe peace and quiet are not things to be cherished in the stock market.</p>
        <p>Stock market volatility, a matter of much hand-wringing over the last two years, has declined markedly. The trouble is that while volatility is down, so are stock prices.</p>
        <p>Both the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 and the Nasdaq composite showed declines in the third quarter of this year, just as they had in the second quarter. It was the first instance of back-to-back losing performances by those indexes since 1994.</p>
        <p>For investors in S. &amp; P. stocks, the losses were relatively slight -- 1.2 percent in the third quarter, after 2.9 percent in the second quarter.</p>
        <p>But the Nasdaq composite was down 7.4 percent after having fallen 13.3 percent in the previous quarter.</p>
        <p>The Dow Jones industrial average, less oriented to technology than the other major indexes, eked out a 1.9 percent gain in the quarter, after it had declined in each of the first two quarters.</p>
        <p>The S. &amp; P. 500 index, which is now down 2.2 percent since the end of last year, is on course to show its first election-year loss since 1960. (That was also a year when an incumbent vice president, Richard M. Nixon, sought the presidency, and he lost despite his efforts to portray John F. Kennedy as inexperienced.)</p>
        <p>One way to measure stock market volatility is to look at the number of big days, defined as days when an index ends trading up or down by at least 1 percent from the previous day.</p>
        <p>Supervolatility days are those with changes of at least 2 percent.</p>
        <p>By those standards, the last quarter, as measured by movement in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500, was less volatile in the quarter just ended than at any time since early 1998. And while the Nasdaq market continued to be much more volatile than the S. &amp;  P. 500, it was less so than it was earlier in 2000.</p>
        <p>During the third quarter, in 27 percent of market sessions, the S. &amp; P. registered high volatility, down from a record 48 percent in the first quarter of this year. It was the lowest figure since 24 percent in the second quarter of 1998. And just 3 percent of the sessions had moves of 2 percent or more, way down from 21 percent in the first three months of this year.</p>
        <p>The Nasdaq is where the action has been this year, of course. And there, too, the action has been quieter than in the recent past, although it is still notable by long-term measures. It is unusual to see a day when the Nasdaq does not move at least 1 percent -- more than two-thirds of the days in the last quarter showed moves that sharp -- but that compares with an astonishing 86 percent of the sessions in the second quarter.</p>
        <p>To find evidence that Nasdaq is quieting down, one must look at the incredibly volatile days -- days when the index rises or falls by at least 4 percent. There was just one such day in the third quarter, down from 16 in the previous quarter, when technology stocks were so volatile and such moves occurred during a quarter of the trading sessions.</p>
        <p>One way to appreciate just how extraordinary the second quarter was is to note that in the years from 1988 through 1999, there were 15 days when the Nasdaq composite moved by at least 4 percent. That is one fewer than in the three months of April through June 2000.</p>
        <p>The volatility trends continued yesterday. The S. &amp; P. 500 was barely changed for the day, but the Nasdaq composite slumped 2.83 percent as many technology stocks were hurt by fears that profits will not continue to rise at the rapid pace investors have come to expect.</p>
        <p>A few years ago, a 2.83 percent daily drop in the Nasdaq composite would have produced headlines. There were just 11 such days from 1990 through 1997, a little more than one a year on average. But this is the 32nd such day in the current year, and it takes a lot more than that to get market-watchers excited now.</p>
