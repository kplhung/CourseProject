        <p>All the worries were, in the end, needless. The New Jersey Turnpike endured its first morning rush hour with the E-ZPass toll system yesterday without an electronic or traffic calamity. Highway officials were overjoyed.</p>
        <p>''Today's rush could have been a disaster,'' said Lynn M. Fleeger, a spokeswoman for the turnpike. ''But the system performed perfectly.''</p>
        <p>Drivers did grumble about the toll increase that took effect Saturday, when the E-ZPass system began operating, Ms. Fleeger said. And there was lane-jockeying at the highway's 27 toll plazas as drivers, for the first time, had to weave in and out of traffic to get to the E-ZPass or cash lanes they required. But overall, the morning rush went fine all along the 148-mile length of one of the nation's busiest toll roads, she said.</p>
        <p>Highway officials were surprised, she added, that 43.3 percent of the 82,610 vehicles entering the turnpike from 7 to 9 a.m. were equipped with E-ZPass tags. Officials had expected only about 25 percent to have them.</p>
        <p>Some drivers interviewed at tolls near Newark International Airport seemed pleased with E-ZPass.</p>
        <p>Michael Daily of Montclair, N.J.,  who obtained his E-ZPass windshield tag two years ago, said he was happy the electronic system had come to the turnpike, though months late. ''It's a wonderful day for me because I will never have to stop to pay a toll in the state again,'' he said.</p>
        <p>John Fitzsimmons, 34, of Cranbury, N.J., who was not enrolled in E-ZPass, sat in a line of traffic outside Newark, waiting to pay his toll. ''I am jealous of the E-ZPass people,'' he said. ''Even though it is only an extra three minutes, it's three minutes I don't have to wait in traffic.''</p>
        <p>The advent of E-ZPass prompted cynicism among some turnpike workers. At a plaza near the airport, one worker said he and colleagues were betting Sunday about the precise time the system would overload during Monday's morning rush. All their choices turned out wrong. ''So far, so good,'' he said shortly after 9 a.m.</p>
        <p>For the rest of the week, extra workers will be at all plazas to hand out applications for E-ZPass, and to prevent anyone who has entered an incorrect lane from backing up to get to a correct one.</p>
        <p>The new system requires E-ZPass participants to enter and leave the turnpike in E-ZPass lanes. Those not enrolled must get a toll ticket when entering the turnpike and exit via a cash lane. If non-participants exit in an E-ZPass lane, the turnpike authority will mail them a bill for the highway's maximum toll, now $5.50 under a 20 percent increase that took effect Saturday for those not using E-ZPass, Ms. Fleeger said.</p>
        <p>E-ZPass lanes are equipped with surveillance cameras to capture images of license plates, she said.</p>
        <p>E-ZPass participants who mistakenly enter the highway in a ticket lane and leave via an E-ZPass lane will be billed $4.95 if they enter from 7 to 9 a.m. or from 4:30 to 6:30 p.m. The same amount will apply to participants who enter in an E-ZPass lane and mistakenly exit via a ticket lane during those times.</p>
        <p>At all other times, the charge will be $4.60 for E-ZPass participants who use a wrong lane to enter or exit. Bills will be lowered if the participants send the turnpike authority a copy of the toll ticket from the entry plaza they used.</p>
        <p>Using incorrect lanes also carries a $25 fine. But Ms. Fleeger said the turnpike authority would waive that penalty for an unspecified period of time while drivers become familiar with the new system.</p>
