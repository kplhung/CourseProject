        <p>While three of the four quarterfinal series in the Major League Soccer playoffs were sweeps, both semifinals will require a third and deciding game for the right to play in M.L.S. Cup 2000 on Oct. 15 in Robert F. Kennedy Stadium in Washington.</p>
        <p>The MetroStars and the Fire split their first two games, each winning at home, and will face each other Friday night at Soldier Field in Chicago to determine one of the finalists.</p>
        <p>Los Angeles and Kansas City played to a scoreless deadlock in the opening game of their semifinal, which will resume tonight at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, Calif. Regardless of tonight's result, the two teams will play their third game Friday night in Kansas City because a team needs at least 5 points to advance. Three points are awarded for a victory, one for a tie.</p>
        <p>The MetroStars, who beat Chicago by 2-0 on Saturday, took yesterday off and will practice for three days, then depart for Chicago on Thursday.</p>
        <p>In their last victory, the Metro- Stars got an excellent performance from goalkeeper MIKE AMMANN, who had been expected to miss the rest of the season after a concussion and rib injury. They are expected to have back TAB RAMOS, who missed Saturday's game with a groin pull he sustained earlier in the week.</p>
        <p>Los Angeles will have a huge disadvantage on Friday. LUIS HERNANDEZ, the league's most expensive player, will join the Mexican national team tomorrow for its World Cup qualifying game against Trinidad and Tobago on Sunday.</p>
        <p>Hernandez was called to the national team by Coach ENRIQUE MEZA, who replaced MANUEL LAPUENTE. Hernandez had a gentlemen's agreement with Lapuente that he would not be called to the national team if the Galaxy reached the playoffs.</p>
        <p>Meza apparently did not honor that agreement. He gathered the Mexicans yesterday to prepare for Trinidad and Tobago, and he almost demanded that Hernandez join the team yesterday, even though the Mexicans have clinched a spot in the six-team final qualifying round. But the Galaxy managed to keep Hernandez for tonight's game.</p>
        <p>''They're about to embark on a new era with a new coach,'' Galaxy Coach SIGI SCHMID said about the Mexican team. ''I understand that he wants to have all his horses on board to show that they're united.''</p>
        <p>The series opener between Los Angeles and Kansas City was physical, with Los Angeles getting the worst of it. The Galaxy was whistled for 22 fouls and 4 cautions, including 2 in overtime.</p>
        <p>UNITED STATES</p>
        <p>With several World Cup players involved in M.L.S. playoffs, European-based players will be the first to join the squad this week to prepare for the World Cup qualifying game against Costa Rica on Oct. 11 in Columbus, Ohio. Almost all the Europeans are expected to arrive on Thursday, and Coach BRUCE ARENA is expected to announce his roster for the game in a day or two.</p>
        <p>N.C.A.A. DIVISION I</p>
        <p>Connecticut (7-1-1) and St. John's (8-1-1) have climbed to the second and third spots, respectively, behind U.C.L.A. (8-0-0) in the coaches' poll. South Carolina (8-1-1) is fourth, and the defending champion, Indiana (7-3), jumped from 11th to fifth.</p>
        <p>In the women's poll, Notre Dame (11-0) continues to be No. 1, followed by Clemson (12-0), Nebraska (12-0), North Carolina  (11-1) and U.C.L.A. (8-1).</p>
        <p>A-LEAGUE</p>
        <p>The Rochester Rhinos captured their second championship in three years with a 3-1 triumph over the Minnesota Thunder. The crowd of 14,276 that watched the game in Rochester on Saturday would delight anyone in M.L.S., where average attendance in the playoffs has been only about 10,000.</p>
        <p>CORNER KICKS</p>
        <p>CANDINHO, the assistant coach for the national team of Brazil, will take over as caretaker after the dismissal of WANDERLEY LUXEMBURGO yesterday. In the meantime, the encounter between Goias and Sao Paulo, the leaders in the Brazilian league, ended in a 2-2 deadlock. ... The battle between Colo Colo and Universidad Catolica, the leaders in Chile, ended at  3-3. ... A few hours after Leicester City striker STAN COLLYMORE was charged yesterday with violent misconduct by the English Football Association for his action against Everton's PAUL GASCOIGNE, Leicester agreed to grant his request for a transfer. Collymore joined Leicester this year after turbulent times with Nottingham Forest, Aston Villa and Liverpool. ... Coach ALEX FERGUSON of Manchester United said Arsenal would be United's main rival for the title in the English Premier League after the Gunners' 1-0 victory. ... Juventus midfielder EDGAR DAVIDS and Barcelona left winger BOUDEWIJN ZENDEN will join the Netherlands for its next World Cup qualifying game Saturday at Cyprus.</p>
