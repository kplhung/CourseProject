        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''U.S. Approves Abortion Pill; Drug Offers More Privacy, and Could Reshape Debate'' (front page, Sept. 29):</p>
        <p>You report that the Food and Drug Administration approved mifepristone with ''relatively few restrictions on doctors' freedom to prescribe the drug,'' one restriction being that women must have ''ready access to surgical abortions'' as backup.</p>
        <p>Yet ready access is precisely what American women do not have. As of 1996, 86 percent of counties had no abortion providers. Fourteen states require women to wait up to 24 hours after receiving counseling before they can have an abortion -- which would mean at least four trips to the doctor instead of three.</p>
        <p>While the F.D.A.'s approval is certainly a welcome development, improving the availability of abortion services for all women remains a significant challenge for the  future.</p>
