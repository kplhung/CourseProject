        <p>In a withering report, a state board monitoring Nassau County's fiscal crisis said today that the county executive had failed to balance the budget in his new four-year rescue plan.

        <p>In a withering report, a state board monitoring Nassau County's fiscal crisis said today that the county executive had failed to balance the budget in his new four-year rescue plan. The report urged county officials to come up with a sound proposal by the end of the month. If they fail, they face a state takeover.</p>
        <p>It was the board's first public comment on the plan submitted two weeks ago by the county executive, Thomas S. Gulotta, and scrutinized ever since by county lawmakers who say that it lacks sufficient detail and that its numbers do not add up. The state board agreed today with many of the criticisms, estimating, for instance, that Mr. Gulotta's $2.2 billion budget proposal for next year counts on more than $80 million in spending cuts or revenues that, for one reason or another, may not come to pass.</p>
        <p>But the board firmly lobbed the job of fixing Nassau's stubborn financial problem back not only to Mr. Gulotta, but also to the County Legislature, whose members are often deeply divided. That opens the door to bigger tax increases or more severe cuts in services than Mr. Gulotta, a Republican, has proposed. Mr. Gulotta's plan calls for a property tax increase that would average $33 per household. The Democrats who control the County Legislature are considering an increase that would average $78 to $100.</p>
        <p>The 37-page report, issued today by the state board, the Nassau Interim Finance Authority, is a new chapter in a long story:  how one of the nation's wealthiest counties hurtled to the edge of bankruptcy in an otherwise soaring economic climate.</p>
        <p>''The education I have received as part of this board has been eye-opening and saddening,'' Robert Wallach, a panelist, said today at a public meeting to adopt the report, drafted by the authority's staff.</p>
        <p>''I pray to God that you will tap us and others in Nassau County,'' Mr. Wallach told public officials, ''because otherwise Nassau will look very much like the scorched earth rather than a very fruitful garden that it should be. I wish you a lot of luck.''</p>
        <p>All three sides in the divided government -- Judith A. Jacobs, a Democrat and the presiding officer of the County Legislature; Peter J. Schmitt, the Republican minority leader; and Mr. Gulotta -- said today that they could still come up with a workable budget.</p>
        <p>The task will be monumental. Time is running out, and the three leaders have yet to meet without Frank G. Zarb, the chairman of the seven-member state board, being present to referee.</p>
        <p>In its report, the board details $81.7 million worth of spending cuts and expected revenue in Mr. Gulotta's 2001 budget that Mr. Zarb called ''risky'' to count on. It also questioned items that, over four years, would add up to nearly $1 billion in savings. It said those items in Mr. Gulotta's plan lacked sufficient detail or would require the approval of state lawmakers, local municipal unions or others.</p>
        <p>Two weeks ago, for instance, the board asked Mr. Gulotta for more detail on $74.5 million worth of proposed spending cuts through 2004. The board received a response late last week, but not in time for those answers to be reflected in its report.</p>
        <p>''The county's failure to address the deficiencies discussed herein will result in budgets that will further erode the county's fiscal health and jeopardize its financial well-being,'' the report's conclusion stated.</p>
        <p>If county officials fail to address the criticisms, the board -- which is now advising the county -- is empowered to seize day-to-day control of the county's finances. For now, all sides are working to prevent that.</p>
        <p>By county law, the next year's budget must be adopted by Oct. 30, though Mr. Zarb, who was chosen by Gov. George E. Pataki to head the state board, would like one to be passed sooner. Ms. Jacobs said yesterday that the Legislature hoped to approve a budget on Oct. 19.</p>
        <p>''We're not saying it can't be fixed,'' said Richard M. Kessel, a member of the state board. ''It can be fixed; it can be repaired. But it is going to take some work. They have this month to get it done.''</p>
        <p>The report is not without some praise for Mr. Gulotta's budget. Unlike past budgets, the 2001 plan contains no so-called one-shots, one-time sources of revenue like the sale of a hospital or of the county's rights to tobacco settlement money.</p>
        <p>Still, the report is full of harsh words.</p>
        <p>The state board sternly criticized tentative agreements Mr. Gulotta had reached with three unions for county police officers, detectives and correction officers. The costs of the proposed contracts amount to nearly $200 million over seven years, including proposed 22 percent pay increases for the police officers and detectives who are already among the highest paid in the nation.</p>
        <p>One member of the state board, David H. Peirez, said he found the proposed raises ''unconscionable.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gulotta said the deals would save the county $60 million in costs in increasing law enforcement costs over five years. He said those savings would be the result of concessions the unions have made, like an agreement to replace 110 officers with lower-paid civilians.</p>
        <p>But the state board said many of the concessions had already been factored into county budgets. And it questioned whether the effort to replace officers with civilians could be accomplished in time.</p>
        <p>The board's report notes that the county's projection that it will collect $809.6 million in sales taxes next year is more conservative than projections have been in past budgets. But it said the county failed to take into account the phasing out of a  state law that allows the county to collect sales taxes on receipts from the transmission and distribution of natural gas or electricity.</p>
        <p>Because of that law, the county is expected to lose $2.6 million this year. That number would rise to a loss of $28.7 million in 2004, the report says.</p>
        <p>The state board said that because of uncertainties surrounding Mr. Gulotta's proposals for the next four  years, big budget gaps could develop: $81.7 million in 2001; $138.3 million in 2002; $275.2 million in 2003; and $379.6 million in 2004.</p>
        <p>The county has provided slim details about new revenues or spending cuts in the future, the report said.  ''The multi-year plan, as proposed by the county executive, is unacceptable because it does not contain sufficient information to allow us to determine whether budgetary balance is likely to be achieved'' between now and 2004, the report said.</p>
        <p>In next year's budget, the report said, Mr. Gulotta has underestimated the county's borrowing costs by $11 million and the cost of overtime at the county jail by $2 million. The county, it said, also failed to budget $1.7 million in costs for the state board's own administration.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gulotta pointed out that the $81.7 million the state board questioned in his 2001 plan represented just 3.7 percent of the overall $2.2 billion budget. Ms. Jacobs said many of the items the board questioned -- like a tax increase -- were less in doubt than the report indicated.</p>
        <p>When asked if a state takeover could still be avoided, Mr. Gulotta said, ''If everyone works together, which is what we have been saying from Day 1, absolutely.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Schmitt, the Republican minority leader, said that the $81.7 million was a ''scary'' figure.</p>
        <p>''It is like Halloween is coming early,'' he said. ''Stay tuned; it will all be over one way or another by Oct. 15 or 16.''</p>
        <p>Just one question remains, Mr. Schmitt said: ''Up or down.'' Success, or a state takeover.</p>
