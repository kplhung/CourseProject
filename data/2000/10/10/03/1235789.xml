        <p>On the eve of the first presidential debate here, most Americans say Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore are strong leaders, but they consider Mr. Gore far more prepared for the White House and better qualified to deal with world leaders and members of both parties in Congress, the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll shows.</p>
        <p>The survey found that as voters start to form detailed impressions of the candidates, even those who say they intend to back Mr. Bush express reservations about his preparedness.</p>
        <p>But when voters are asked to assess each man on the broader question of his potential to be ''an effective president,'' the differences largely vanish; both men receive high marks on the question.</p>
        <p>The lingering questions about Mr. Bush's preparedness do not seem to have affected his overall standing in the head-to-head competition as reflected in the poll. Not since 1960 has a presidential contest been this close on the eve of a first debate.</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Bush, the Texas governor, has been struggling with the issue of his readiness to be president since the campaign began, and it is a matter that his advisers say he will try to put to rest in the first of three encounters with Mr. Gore. The first debate will be on Tuesday night at 9 Eastern time at the Boston campus of the University of Massachusetts.</p>
        <p>Taken as a whole, the survey had much encouraging news for Mr. Gore and very little for Mr. Bush. Beyond the findings about Mr. Bush's preparedness, the poll found that the governor's personal popularity has eroded slightly as Mr. Gore's has continued to improve.</p>
        <p>A majority of Americans say they will tune in to the debate. In addition to seeing where the two candidates stand on the issues, the poll's respondents say they will be looking to determine whether the nominees seem ready to handle the responsibilities of being president.</p>
        <p>The race is so competitive, the survey found, that the difference in support between Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush is statistically insignificant. That said, no matter how the support is defined -- whether in terms of voters who have made up their minds or voters who are only now leaning toward one candidate but are still undecided -- Mr. Gore usually emerges a few points ahead.</p>
        <p>In a four-way contest, Mr. Gore was backed by 45 percent of registered voters, Mr. Bush by 39 percent, and Patrick J. Buchanan and Ralph Nader were each below 5 percent. When voters' awareness of the race and their past voting are taken into account, Mr. Gore draws 45 percent and Mr. Bush 41 percent. If the possibility of a low turnout is added to the mix, Mr. Gore's advantage would be  even more insignificant: one percentage point.</p>
        <p>The state of the contest is all the more unpredictable because voters do not seem whole-heartedly loyal to their favored candidate. More than 4 of 10 Bush or Gore supporters said they were not enthusiastic about their candidate -- and have some misgivings about voting for him.</p>
        <p>The nationwide telephone survey of 1,131 registered voters was taken Sept. 27 to Oct. 1. It has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.</p>
        <p>The most striking finding in the survey is the extent to which voters have reservations about Mr. Bush's preparedness. Their concerns may reflect their knowledge that Mr. Gore has served as vice president for eight years and, before that, was in the House and Senate for 16 years. By contrast, Mr. Bush did not hold public office until he was elected governor of Texas in 1994.</p>
        <p>Lynn Eagleeye, a poll respondent from Bay Village, Ohio, said in a follow-up interview today that she was an independent but leaning toward Mr. Gore. ''Gore has had more experience in the arena, but I think they would both make good presidents,'' said Mrs. Eagleeye, 57, a real estate agent. ''Experience comes with the job and comes with time. It's not just the president running the country, it's his team of advisers. I liked the job Bush's father did with foreign policy, and I think George W. has a good adviser in that area.''</p>
        <p>Saying the debate could sway her opinion, she added, ''Coolness under fire is one thing I'll be looking at.''</p>
        <p>But others, especially Republicans, were not daunted by Mr. Gore's longer record of public service. ''Even though Gore has been vice president, I don't feel like he's done a lot,'' said Wanda Stucky, 63, a homemaker in Bolivar, Ohio. ''I liked Bush's father and I think some of that ability and knowledge has rubbed off on him. Gore just does not impress me as a leader.''</p>
        <p>Thomas Reynolds, 64, a repairman from Somerset, Ky., said he was a Republican but was still torn between the candidates. ''Bush is probably not as prepared for the presidency as Gore,'' Mr. Reynolds said, ''but I think he could be an effective president. You learn as you go, and Bush as the experience of governing Texas.''</p>
        <p>Still, in the poll, many voters gave Mr. Gore far higher marks for being ready to take over.</p>
        <p>When respondents were asked if each candidate had prepared himself well enough for the presidency or needed more time to do more, Mr. Gore was seen by 71 percent of voters as having prepared himself well enough, while 24 percent said he needed to do more. But Mr. Bush was seen as well prepared by just under half, 49 percent, while 43 percent of voters said he needed to prepare  more.</p>
        <p>On their capacity to negotiate with world leaders, 68 percent said Mr. Gore could do that effectively, while 48 percent said that of Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore was also viewed as more capable of dealing with Congress.  Seventy-one percent of registered voters said Mr. Gore had the skills needed to work with both Democrats and Republicans in Congress; 59 percent said the same of Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>Yet for all the concerns about Mr. Bush's lack of preparedness, voters  thought that he had the potential to be an able leader. Of the poll respondents who favor Mr. Gore, for example, only 20 percent said Mr. Bush was adequately prepared for the presidency. Still, 40 percent of  Gore backers said Mr. Bush would make an effective leader.</p>
        <p>Despite the closeness of the race, there were underlying trends that appear to favor Mr. Gore. For the first time, the balance between Mr. Bush's favorable and unfavorable  ratings -- long one of his most potent advantages -- has begun to erode while Mr. Gore's has improved markedly.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush is seen favorably by 43 percent of voters and unfavorably by 30 percent, a positive balance of 13 points. But just before the national convention, Mr. Bush was seen favorably by 44 percent and unfavorably by 26 percent, a positive balance of 18 points.</p>
        <p>In the latest poll, Mr. Gore is seen favorably by 49 percent of voters and unfavorably by 28 percent, a positive balance of 21 points. Before the conventions, Mr. Gore was seen favorably by 36 percent of voters and unfavorably by 35 percent, essentially a draw.</p>
        <p>Yet for all his gains in likability, Mr. Gore said he intended to emphasize issue differences in the debate, a reflection, perhaps, of the fact that on most issues, the poll found that Americans still side with Democrats. Voters say they like the direction the country has been moving and are not eager to change course. Their concerns continue to be health care, including Medicare, followed by education, Social Security and taxes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore holds sway with voters on health care, prescription drugs and caring about the average American, while Mr. Bush does better on strengthening the military and lowering taxes.</p>
        <p>A plurality of voters said the high price of heating oil affected them personally. But while the topic has consumed a significant amount of energy on the campaign trail, neither Mr. Bush nor Mr. Gore was given an advantage by voters who were asked which one could bring about lower prices.</p>
        <p>In a finding that may be cause for concern among Republican candidates, the poll found that Mr. Bush's candidacy has not helped the overall image of his party. Forty-nine percent of voters say they hold a favorable view of the Republicans, while 44 percent hold an unfavorable view. By contrast, 58 percent of voters say they hold a favorable view of the Democratic Party, while 36 percent hold an unfavorable view.</p>
        <p>But on one important issue -- education -- Mr. Bush may have helped his party with his nonstop appearances at schools. As recently as July, voters were more likely to view the Democrats as better able than the Republicans to improve education, by a margin of 45 to 33, a 12-point Democratic advantage. In the current poll, that gap has closed to seven points.</p>
        <p>For all the back and forth over which candidate is most prepared, Sherwood Marx, 74, a retired electrical company supervisor, argued that neither is quite ready.</p>
        <p>''Bush hasn't been around that long in public office,'' said Mr. Marx, who lives in Tacoma, Wash., ''and Gore has been playing second fiddle to Clinton. Neither knows that much.''</p>
        <p>How the Poll Was Taken</p>
        <p>The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted Wednesday through Sunday with 1,462 adults throughout the United States.  Of these, 1,131 said they were registered to vote.</p>
        <p>The sample of telephone exchanges called was randomly selected by a computer from a complete list of more than 42,000 active residential exchanges across the country.</p>
        <p>Within each exchange, random digits were added to form a complete telephone number, thus permitting access to both listed and unlisted numbers. Within each household, one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the survey.</p>
        <p>The results have been weighted to take into account household size and number of telephone lines into the residence, and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to geographic region, sex, race, age and education.</p>
        <p>Some findings regarding voting are additionally weighted in terms of an overall ''probable electorate,'' which uses responses to questions dealing with voting history, attention to the campaign and likelihood of voting in 2000 as a measure of the probability of respondents' turning out in November. The method assumes approximately 50 percent turnout in November.</p>
        <p>In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all American adults.</p>
        <p>For smaller sub-groups, the margin of sampling error is larger.</p>
        <p>In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll. Variations in the wording and order of questions, for example, may lead to somewhat different results.</p>
