        <p>Confetti swirled, fireworks thundered and men with parachutes floated down from the clouds. The rally on the banks of the Ohio River here this afternoon was bolder and louder than a typical campaign event, but then it was Gov. George W. Bush's send-off for one of the most important appointments of his political career.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush used his sole public event on the day before his first debate with Vice President Al Gore to make a statement, and not merely with all the aerial pageantry.</p>
        <p>His visit to West Virginia, which has voted Democratic in most presidential elections over the last several decades, allowed him to project an image of strength by drawing attention to recent polls that showed him neck and neck with Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>It also allowed him to hone his attack against Mr. Gore on an issue -- rising fuel prices -- that he would like to hang around Mr. Gore's neck.</p>
        <p>The mountains of West Virginia are home to coal and its miners. And Mr. Bush has called for significantly more federal spending on ''clean coal'' technologies, asserting that he would expand the country's energy supply, while President Clinton and Mr. Gore had choked it with excessive regulation.</p>
        <p>''This is an administration that fears coal,'' Mr. Bush said as he stood among coal miners on a riverside barge that was serving as the stage of an outdoor theater.</p>
        <p>''They see it as a threat,'' Mr. Bush said. ''I see it as an opportunity to make us less dependent on foreign oil.''</p>
        <p>Beyond that accusation, today was mostly a day for managing expectations, finishing preparations and maneuvering in advance of the debate.</p>
        <p>To get ready, Mr. Bush was traveling with a larger entourage than usual, including his chief foreign policy adviser, Condoleezza Rice, and his campaign's policy director, Josh Bolten.</p>
        <p>His campaign chairman and best friend, Donald L. Evans, was also on the campaign trail, as he tends to be whenever the pressure intensifies.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore was sequestered in Sarasota, Fla., which suggested that the candidates were playing geographic head games with each other. Florida is a state where Mr. Bush should prevail but where Mr. Gore seems to be relatively even with him.</p>
        <p>At a marine research center there, Mr. Gore conducted mock debates with the help of his own policy advisers, other campaign officials and even two of his children, Karenna Gore Schiff and Sarah Gore.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore also met with the 13 people from across the country whom he had invited to Florida and incorporated into his practice for the debates.</p>
        <p>With the Gore campaign footing the bill, the group is staying at a beach-front hotel in Longboat Key on the Gulf of Mexico where rooms go for $250 a night. Many in the group went shopping this afternoon. On Tuesday they will fly to Boston for the debate on a plane chartered by the Gore campaign for the vice president's political advisers.</p>
        <p>Like Mr. Bush, the vice president seemed intent on an image of relaxed confidence and strength.</p>
        <p>He took the equivalent of a five-mile run on a treadmill this morning, and his advisers said that between debate practice sessions he tossed a football and would take a long break tonight to watch ''Monday Night Football.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore also had a good-luck charm on hand: a mule harness from the barn where he had prepared for his vice-presidential debate against Vice President Dan Quayle in 1992. Mr. Gore's aides had looped the harness over a stuffed shark in the research center.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore is a much more experienced debater than Mr. Bush, and Mr. Bush's aides mentioned that several times today, clearly trying to lower expectations for the Texas governor to the point where he was certain to exceed them.</p>
        <p>In an appearance this morning on the NBC-TV program ''Today,'' Mr. Evans even seemed to cast Mr. Gore's forensic prowess as a negative attribute -- proof that he had been a political insider too long.</p>
        <p>''You know, the governor has not been debating all of his life, that's for sure,'' Mr. Evans said.</p>
        <p>''I mean, I know the vice president has spent the better part of his career debating,'' Mr. Evans added. ''I mean, he's been in the halls of Congress debating, in the Senate debating.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush, by contrast, ''has been leading,'' Mr. Evans said. ''He's been leading in the private sector, building his own company, leading in his own community, running the United Way, leading the Texas Rangers, leading his own state.''</p>
        <p>But this approach was inconsistent and sometimes internally contradictory.</p>
        <p>On Mr. Bush's campaign plane today, Karen P. Hughes, his communications director, initially called Mr. Gore the best debater in modern politics but then said he was principally a geyser of memorized lines.</p>
        <p>''His debate style is almost robotic,'' Ms. Hughes said, trying to create an unflattering prism through which observers could evaluate Mr. Gore's performance on Tuesday night.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's aides said that a coin toss had already determined that Mr. Gore would field the first question, while Mr. Bush would be the first to deliver his closing remarks.</p>
        <p>During Mr. Bush's remarks at the rally, he seemed to be previewing sharpened language for the debate, disparaging Mr. Gore's claim that he was for the people, not the powerful.</p>
        <p>''The vice president,'' Mr. Bush said, ''is the powerful.''</p>
