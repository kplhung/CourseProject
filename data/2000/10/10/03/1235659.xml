        <p>Thomas L Friedman Op-Ed column on current situation in Indonesia, which he describes as 'messy' state where old authority structure that allocated resources, enforced contracts and collected taxes has broken down but has not been replaced by new authority that can play same role; says country is beset by rampant corruption and fragmentation of power, in which neither army, Parliament, executive nor remnants of old order have strength to assert their will (M)</p>

        <p>There is only one thing to say about Indonesia today: If you can't take a joke, you shouldn't have come.</p>
        <p>Where to start? How about the Finance Ministry. President Abdurrahman Wahid, Indonesia's first democratically elected leader, recently appointed one of his old pals -- Prijadi Praptosuhardjo -- to be finance minister, a critical job today. Just one problem: a few months ago Mr. Wahid had tried to appoint Mr. Prijadi as the head of a big state-owned bank but was blocked when the central bank declared him not ''fit and proper'' for such a job. Why? Because Mr. Prijadi had been head of corporate lending for the state-run bank, B.R.I., when it ran up 30 trillion Indonesian rupiah worth of bad corporate loans. Let me do the math for you: B.R.I.'s bad loans amounted to 2 percent of Indonesia's G.D.P. When the head of Indonesia's central bank protested Mr. Wahid's appointing as finance minister the man who ran up ''the mother of all corporate lending losses,'' the central banker was put under house arrest for alleged involvement in a campaign finance scandal.</p>

        <p>There is only one thing to say about Indonesia today: If you can't take a joke, you shouldn't have come.</p>
        <p>Where to start? How about the Finance Ministry. President Abdurrahman Wahid, Indonesia's first democratically elected leader, recently appointed one of his old pals -- Prijadi Praptosuhardjo -- to be finance minister, a critical job today. Just one problem: a few months ago Mr. Wahid had tried to appoint Mr. Prijadi as the head of a big state-owned bank but was blocked when the central bank declared him not ''fit and proper'' for such a job.

When the head of Indonesia's central bank protested Mr. Wahid's appointing as finance minister the man who ran up ''the mother of all corporate lending losses,'' the central banker was put under house arrest for alleged involvement in a campaign finance scandal.</p>
        <p>That's just a day in the life of Wahid's Indonesia, where, frankly, the wheels are coming loose. With turmoil in the cabinet, with Mr. Wahid constantly traveling abroad, with a bombing at the Jakarta Stock Exchange, with the corrupt former President Suharto having been declared too ill to stand trial (sure!) and with the murder of three U.N. staffers in West Timor by a mob tacitly backed by Indonesian army units, Indonesia today is a mess. In fact, Indonesia, the world's fourth most populated country, is the prime example of a new kind of state: the ''messy state.''</p>
        <p>That's right, in the cold war we had authoritarian, democratic and Communist states. Now we have authoritarian states (North Korea, Iraq), democratic states (America, France), democratizing states (Poland, Chile, Hungary), failed states (Sierra Leone, Liberia) and messy states -- namely Russia and Indonesia.</p>
        <p>In messy states the old authority structure that allocated resources, enforced contracts and collected taxes -- President Suharto in Indonesia and the Communist Party in Russia -- has broken down but has not been replaced by a new authority that can play the same role. The result, in Indonesia and Russia, is rampant corruption and a fragmentation of power in which neither the army, the Parliament, the executive nor the remnants of the old order have the strength to assert their will. Messy states: too big to fail; too messy to work.</p>
        <p>That's why in messy states you never quite know -- when arms are sold, people murdered or payoffs demanded -- whether this is by design of those ostensibly in charge or because no one is in charge. Indeed, we are going to have to retrain U.S. diplomats to deal with messy states. The first course would consist of film of a U.S. ambassador going to see a senior official of a messy state and asking him to do X. The official of the messy state agrees, gets up and pulls the lever the U.S. ambassador wants, and the lever comes right off the wall. In messy states, levers get pulled but they come off in your hand.</p>
        <p>With Indonesia, Russia and Pakistan, the world's fourth, sixth and seventh largest countries, already messy states, and with China likely to become one when Communism collapses, four of the world's seven most populated countries will be messy states. Only America, Brazil and India don't qualify. One wonders how Al Gore or George W. Bush proposes to deal with messy states, because this is not a phase. This is the future. Or as President Wahid himself joked: the Suharto era here was known as the ''New Order,'' the post-Suharto era led by B. J. Habibie was known for being ''Out of Order,'' and the Wahid period is known as ''No Order.''</p>
        <p>''In Suharto's time,'' said Wimar Witoelar, Indonesia's popular talk show host, ''things were clear -- you always knew who to pay and how long to wait. Now you never know who's in charge. Before people were being killed by the government, now they are killed because of no government. Before there were Indonesia experts, but they were really just Suharto regime experts, because his behavior explained everything. Now Indonesians don't understand Indonesia. . . . In the Suharto period my talk show was popular because I made fun of the government. Now my show isn't so popular because the government is funnier than I am.''</p>
