        <p>The police released a videotape  yesterday that they hope will lead to the people who killed a father of four with a cobblestone after following him into the lobby of his Queens apartment building.</p>
        <p>The man, Jong-Rin Lee, 46, died last Tuesday at New York Hospital Medical Center of Queens after suffering injuries that included fractures to his skull and ribs, the authorities said.</p>
        <p>The assault took place about 1:15 a.m. on Sept. 23, as Mr. Lee was returning to his home on 147th Street from his job at a Korean restaurant in Manhattan, the police said. Their investigation into the incident was first reported in The Daily News.</p>
        <p>The attack itself was not captured by the security camera in the lobby. But the black-and-white videotape from the camera does show the two assailants entering the lobby of Mr. Lee's building, then bolting less than a minute later, the police said. About 10 seconds after the first suspect is seen entering the building, his head covered with a bandanna, a second suspect wearing a dark bandanna with white polka dots enters, carrying a cobblestone that appears so heavy it must be held with two hands.</p>
        <p>The police described the assailants as Hispanic, each about 17 years old and between 5 feet 6 inches and 5 feet 8 inches tall.</p>
        <p>The police said one suspect was a male, but they were not certain of the other one's gender.</p>
        <p>''Based on the original description, we're going with male. If it turns out to be a female, I would not be surprised,'' said Inspector Joseph Reznick, the commander of detectives in Queens.</p>
        <p>The police are investigating the case as a possible bias crime. They are also looking into the possibility that the killing was part of a gang initiation or a botched robbery.</p>
        <p>''Right now we have nothing to indicate to us that it is bias,'' Inspector Reznick said. ''However, we are looking at everything.''</p>
        <p>The police said nothing appeared to be missing from Mr. Lee's pockets, which contained his keys and wallet, a MetroCard and $1.50.</p>
        <p>One avenue the police are pursuing involves the Mara Salvatrucha, or MS-13, a gang formed by Salvadorans, whose logo is scrawled on Mr. Lee's building, the police said.</p>
        <p>''These tags are very conspicuously written up on the walls of that particular building,'' Inspector Reznick said, calling the gang's activities ''one of many motives that we're looking at.''</p>
