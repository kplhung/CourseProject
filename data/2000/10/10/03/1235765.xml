        <p>Avon plans to begin selling Becoming in the second half of 2001, at 150 to 200 Avon Center ''stores within a store'' at Penney and Sears. Though billings were not disclosed, Andrea Jung, Avon's chief executive, said the company would spend $10 million to $15 million to start and market Becoming.</p>
