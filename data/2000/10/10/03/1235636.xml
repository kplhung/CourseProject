        <p>Slimy, Yes, but Clever</p>
        <p>Slime molds are people, too.</p>
        <p>Well, not exactly -- but Japanese researchers have shown that they display what seems to be a primitive kind of intelligence.</p>
        <p>To demonstrate this, the scientists conducted a new version of the classic animal-in-a-maze experiment. For a rat hunting cheese, however, they substituted a slime mold stalking ground oat flakes in a block of agar.</p>
        <p>Acellular slime molds, which grow on bacteria, fungi and decaying organic matter, exist most commonly as plasmodia, large amoebalike cells with many nuclei. They seek food by sending out tendril-like appendages called pseudopodia.</p>
        <p>The Japanese researchers, writing in the journal Nature, described setting up a maze (consisting of plastic film, which slime molds will not grow on, overlaid on a growing surface) with two agar blocks at different exit points. Without fail, a large slime mold in the maze changed its shape, shrinking in dead-end areas while, in those areas that formed the shortest distance between the blocks, re-organizing into a single, thick pseudopodium.</p>
        <p>Even the slime mold, the researchers suggest, knows how to maximize its foraging efficiency by taking the shortest line between two points.</p>
        <p>Putting Bees to Work</p>
        <p>Bees already do a lot of work around farms and gardens, pollinating as they flit from blossom to blossom. So why can't they help with pest control as well?</p>
        <p>They can, according to researchers from Ohio State and Cornell, who have discovered that bees can deliver a biological fungicide to strawberry plants. In fact, the researchers found that bee delivery is more effective than spraying in preventing mold.</p>
        <p>In their study, reported in the journal Biological Control, the researchers placed trays filled with a micro-organism commonly used to prevent gray mold in front of hives, so that the bees walked through it while leaving. Then, when the bees flew to the strawberry plants looking for food, some of the micro-organisms rubbed off on the flowers.</p>
        <p>The researchers found that bee delivery reduced mold and rot better than spraying of the same fungicide. Spraying covers both flowers and leaves, while bees bring the fungicide straight to the spot it is needed -- the flowers. The researchers also found that carrying the fungicide had no effect on the health of the hive.</p>
        <p>A Place in the Shade</p>
        <p>Shade-grown coffee delivers the usual caffeine jolt, but can also make its drinkers feel warm and fuzzy inside, knowing that they've made a small gesture for wildlife conservation. This type of coffee is grown under a canopy of trees that, the thinking goes, provides a far better habitat for birds and other creatures than the typical open-sunshine plantation.</p>
        <p>But a study by researchers from the University of Georgia and elsewhere shows that there may be limits to how efficient shade-grown coffee farms are as a bird-conservation measure.</p>
        <p>The scientists studied 126 bird species around forests and coffee farms in western Panama. These birds typically eat insects that are stirred out of the leaf litter by swarms of invading ants. The study was published in the journal Ecological Applications.</p>
        <p>The researchers found that ant swarms did not occur in open-sunshine plantations, but did in shade plots and forests in numbers that were high enough to sustain many species of birds. But they also found that shade farms that were far from forests failed to attract many birds. For one thing, many forest birds are adapted to dimmer conditions and avoid flying across bright open spaces to get to shaded areas.</p>
        <p>So while shade plots are useful as a conservation technique, the researchers note that they are not a substitute for forest and can be more effective as a sort of buffer zone near larger forested areas. In many parts of Central America, however, shade plots tend to stand alone -- and in fact are the only type of land that even resembles a forest for miles around.</p>
