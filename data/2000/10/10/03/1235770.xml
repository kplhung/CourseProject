        <p>Five days after a 3-year-old was murdered in Florida, resulting in charges against  his prospective foster father, the commissioner of Connecticut's Department of Children and Families today admitted that her agency should not have sent the boy to live with the man and his wife.</p>
        <p>Reacting to Gov. John G. Rowland's condemnation of her agency's performance, Commissioner Kristine D.

        <p>Five days after a 3-year-old was murdered in Florida, resulting in charges against  his prospective foster father, the commissioner of Connecticut's Department of Children and Families today admitted that her agency should not have sent the boy to live with the man and his wife.</p>
        <p>Reacting to Gov. John G. Rowland's condemnation of her agency's performance, Commissioner Kristine D. Ragaglia said she was leading an investigation into whether any of the hundreds of other children legally under the state's care are in homes not fully licensed to handle them. She also said the agency would immediately stop sending children to any home not licensed to serve as a foster home.</p>
        <p>Under Connecticut law, state residents temporarily caring for children who are legally under the state's care must be licensed to provide foster care. But the state law does not require that all children who are wards of the state be placed with licensed families when they are sent out of state.</p>
        <p>In the case of 3-year-old Alex Boucher, this loophole proved fatal, the authorities said.</p>
        <p>Last Wednesday, several days after Alex was sent to live for 30 days with James and Jennifer Curtis, of New Port Richey, Fla., the couple that hoped to eventually adopt him, the boy was pronounced dead.</p>
        <p>The New Port Richey Police said Mr. Curtis, 25, became angry with Alex two days before for soiling his diapers, and in anger he wrapped the boy in a blanket so tightly that Alex, immobile and unattended on a bed, later choked on his own vomit. Mr. Curtis was charged on Friday with first-degree murder.</p>
        <p>Though the couple was not licensed as foster parents, they had shown a great and caring interest in the boy, Ms. Ragaglia said, and had passed several evaluations from an agency in Florida.</p>
        <p>''Alex enjoyed being with the Curtises,'' Ms. Ragaglia said today. But she said Alex should not have been sent to a couple that, however familiar they were with him, were not licensed by Connecticut or Florida to care for foster children.</p>
        <p>Calling the Connecticut Department of Children and Families' placement policy wrong and in shambles, Gov. Rowland said today he would not allow the agency to send children under its care to unlicensed homes.</p>
        <p>Ms. Ragaglia said in a news conference today that the state's Child Fatality Review Board would begin a review of the case on Wednesday.</p>
