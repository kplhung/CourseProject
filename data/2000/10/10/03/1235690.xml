        <p>The violence that has convulsed the Middle East since late last week has given Israelis and Palestinians alike a frightening replay of the bloodshed that scarred the region for so many years. The question now is whether the fighting will prove to be a temporary setback in the drive to make peace or a terminal point in negotiations. The recent experience of Northern Ireland suggests that violent outbursts need not upend a determined effort to settle a prolonged conflict, but heroic work will be required by Israeli, Palestinian and American leaders to save the Middle East peace talks. That can begin at the planned meeting in Paris on Wednesday of Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel, Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.</p>
        <p>There must be a quick cessation of violence. Mr. Arafat and Mr. Barak should take urgent measures to halt the clashes that have left at least 48  dead and hundreds wounded. The precipitating incident was a provocative and irresponsible visit by the Likud leader, Ariel Sharon, last Thursday to Jerusalem's Temple Mount, the site of two of Islam's holiest mosques. But the fighting has now taken on a life of its own. Yesterday angry Palestinian militants attacked Israeli troops and civilians across Jerusalem, the West Bank, Gaza and Arab-inhabited areas of Israel with stones, firebombs and sniper fire. Israeli troops responded with automatic weapons and armor-piercing missiles.</p>

        <p>The violence that has convulsed the Middle East since late last week has given Israelis and Palestinians alike a frightening replay of the bloodshed that scarred the region for so many years. The question now is whether the fighting will prove to be a temporary setback in the drive to make peace or a terminal point in negotiations. The recent experience of Northern Ireland suggests that violent outbursts need not upend a determined effort to settle a prolonged conflict, but heroic work will be required by Israeli, Palestinian and American leaders to save the Middle East peace talks. That can begin at the planned meeting in Paris on Wednesday of Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel, Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.</p>
        <p>There must be a quick cessation of violence. Mr. Arafat and Mr. Barak should take urgent measures to halt the clashes that have left at least 48  dead and hundreds wounded. The precipitating incident was a provocative and irresponsible visit by the Likud leader, Ariel Sharon, last Thursday to Jerusalem's Temple Mount, the site of two of Islam's holiest mosques. But the fighting has now taken on a life of its own. Yesterday angry Palestinian militants attacked Israeli troops and civilians across Jerusalem, the West Bank, Gaza and Arab-inhabited areas of Israel with stones, firebombs and sniper fire. Israeli troops responded with automatic weapons and armor-piercing missiles.</p>
        <p>With most of the current violence being initiated by the Palestinians, Mr. Arafat bears the greater responsibility for urging restraint. But Mr. Barak must also take steps to damp down the conflict. Halting the bloodshed must take priority over apportioning blame.</p>
        <p>Mr. Arafat needs to call unambiguously on the Palestinian population to halt the violence and trust him to take its grievances to the negotiating table. Undoubtedly there is spontaneous anger among many Palestinians that Mr. Arafat will find difficult to calm. Television footage of a Palestinian fifth grader dying in his father's arms has fueled anti-Israeli sentiment. But if Mr. Arafat hopes to negotiate with Israel as the leader of Palestinian society, he must lead. In particular, he needs to enforce greater discipline on the armed Palestinian police force that has wavered between trying to hold back Palestinian crowds and exchanging fire with Israeli troops. He must also rein his youthful armed supporters, who have been at the center of the recent violence.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak must forcefully defend the lives of Israeli soldiers and civilians under attack. But he needs, as far as possible, to avoid sending troops into unnecessarily confrontational positions and should minimize the use of live ammunition. Mr. Barak and Mr. Arafat should issue a joint call for an end to the violence.</p>
        <p>President Clinton has made clear that he is ready to help restrain the violence and revive the peace talks. If the violence ends, security officials from both sides should discuss ways to avoid a recurrence of fighting. The alternative to rebuilding trust and communications is now on deadly display.</p>
