        <p>Teddy Edwards  Jazz Standard</p>
        <p>Teddy Edwards, the West Coast tenor saxophonist now in his mid-70's, has a reputation as one of jazz's unsolved mysteries, someone who should have been famous but isn't. You wouldn't know it from his presence: he's a warm, generous performer who wears light-colored suits and likes to see if the audience is following his jokes. On Wednesday he gave a charming, low-stress performance with a pickup band.</p>

        <p>Teddy Edwards  Jazz Standard</p>
        <p>Teddy Edwards, the West Coast tenor saxophonist now in his mid-70's, has a reputation as one of jazz's unsolved mysteries, someone who should have been famous but isn't. You wouldn't know it from his presence: he's a warm, generous performer who wears light-colored suits and likes to see if the audience is following his jokes. On Wednesday he gave a charming, low-stress performance with a pickup band.</p>
        <p>It was the type of loose show that made you stretch your hearing a little to get to the heart of why Mr. Edwards is such a good player, but all was revealed in time. Mr. Edwards was one of the first bebop tenor saxophonists in the mid-1940's,  but his career leveled out early because of a lack of opportunities in Los Angeles after the decline of the Central Avenue scene and some health problems. Despite the associations of bebop with speed, he doesn't hustle.</p>
        <p>Most of all he's a great blues player: when the fast, fractured lines of bebop momentarily emerged here and there, you could see how they were part of a continuum with rhythm-and-blues.</p>
        <p>He split the ballad ''Tenderly'' into two sections: he warmed it up playing only with the pianist, John Hicks, and in few introductory choruses he was a freehand, laid-back player, walking calmly through his improvisations, working in long tones and long, arpeggiated stretches. After the rhythm section kicked in, there was a release of tension, and Mr. Edwards started to work on larger, more continuous ideas, as if he were preaching through the horn.</p>
        <p>The bassist Paul Nowinsky and the drummer Alvester Garnett picked up Mr. Edwards's growing conviction; the snare-drum beats acquired a dramatic snap, and all of a sudden, the music acquired direction.</p>
