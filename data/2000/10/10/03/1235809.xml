        <p>Suddenly, with the advent of the new season, everyone is awakening to the Bach year, the 250th anniversary of the composer's death. The ''Goldberg'' Variations alone have appeared in four new recordings and had two recent performances in New York, with at least four more imminent.</p>
        <p>Not that there was any notable lack of Bach in the spring. The Mannes College, for one, was there from the beginning with its series Mannes Bach 2000 and on Wednesday evening, it picked up for the fall with a performance of the 24 preludes and fugues of the ''Well-Tempered Clavier,'' Book 1, by the pianist Vladimir Feltsman.</p>
        <p>The occasion also served to inaugurate the school's new Steinway piano, and Mr. Feltsman made the most of its powerful sonorities, carrying the F minor Fugue, for example, to a thunderous conclusion. In the end, Mr. Feltsman produced perhaps too much sonorous awe to fit comfortably in the small auditorium.</p>
        <p>Occasionally, he achieved lovely effects and a beautiful touch, as with the lightness and rare sense of play at the start of the A minor Prelude. Most of the rest was earnestly delivered in a manner that said much about the pianist's respect for Bach, less about the affection he presumably also feels.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Feltsman was working at a disadvantage during much of the second half, when a video camera that had been filming him was abandoned, its red light left to blink distractingly throughout, like an electronic metronome demanding that all the many tempos be reduced to one. Mr. Feltsman, who was once given to temperamental outbursts, could hardly have been blamed for one here, but he settled instead for a bit of mugging.</p>
        <p>The piano gets its next workout in the Bach series on Oct. 12, when Edward Aldwell offers one of those ''Goldberg'' performances.</p>
