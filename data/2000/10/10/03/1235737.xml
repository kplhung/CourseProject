        <p>A big unanswered question as the vice-presidential debate approaches is which Joe Lieberman will show up. Will it be the genial, grandfatherly lawmaker or the relentless, focused attacker?</p>
        <p>His aides are giving no indication, as Senator Joseph I. Lieberman prepares in this small city for his debate on Thursday against former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney. But the answer will help determine the tone of that encounter, and who is perceived as the winner.</p>
        <p>In 30 years in office, including 12 as a senator, Mr. Lieberman, of Connecticut, has earned a reputation as a gentleman, a bit of a moralizer but likable, someone who works easily with Republicans and Democrats.</p>
        <p>But he reached the Senate in 1988 by savaging a Republican incumbent, Lowell P. Weicker, with constant, brutally effective attacks, a tone that he carried into their three debates, when he was on the offensive from the first exchange to the last. It worked. Mr. Lieberman had trailed badly going into the final month of the campaign, but pulled even over the course of the debates, and won by a nail-thin margin.</p>
        <p>In this campaign, Mr. Lieberman has vowed not to say anything negative about Mr. Cheney or Gov. George W. Bush personally, but to limit his attacks to their records -- a promise he has kept so far. He draws an implicit contrast to Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney, who have criticized Vice President Al Gore personally, describing him as dishonest.</p>
        <p>But in the 1988 debates, Mr. Lieberman repeatedly dealt with Mr. Weicker in mocking, personal terms, questioning his commitment to the job and to his principles after 18 years in Washington.</p>
        <p>''Lowell, if this were the Olympics, you'd get a 10 in the gymnastics competition for all the flip-flops you've done,'' Mr. Lieberman said in one exchange.</p>
        <p>The centerpiece of Mr. Lieberman's campaign was an attack on Mr. Weicker's attendance record,  though Mr. Weicker argued with justification that the votes he had missed were mostly insignificant.</p>
        <p>''Your attendance record is a lousy one,'' Mr. Lieberman said in one debate. ''You do whatever you want to do, and one of the things you haven't wanted to do enough is go to work.''</p>
        <p>In their first debate, Mr. Lieberman belittled Mr. Weicker's reputation as a maverick: ''It means you're not ultimately accountable to anybody. You don't even have to make commitments, even to the voters you represent.''</p>
        <p>Characteristically, he fired those barbs not with a snarl, but in his low-key, avuncular manner, much like Ronald Reagan's famed ''There you go again'' shot at Jimmy Carter.</p>
        <p>Mr. Weicker -- nobody's idea of a pushover -- was nonplused by his opponent's frontal assault, reacting  as if unable to believe that anyone could question his sincerity. At times, he barely deigned to respond, or seemed amused by the charges.</p>
        <p>Going on the attack, of course, can backfire, making a candidate seem mean or desperate. Mr. Lieberman had the advantage in 1988 that Mr. Weicker, a grouchy iconoclast, had alienated many people.</p>
        <p>So far, the Democrats have given no hint how aggressive Mr. Lieberman will be Thursday night.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman arrived Sunday night in this city 25 miles south of Lexington, accompanied by a phalanx of aides, for four days of preparation. They holed up today at Arlington House, a manor on a swath of oak-dotted hill country, that is owned by the alumni association of nearby Eastern Kentucky University. The debate will be held at Centre College in Danville, 30 miles west of here.</p>
        <p>In keeping with the informal, talk-show-style setting the debate will use, Mr. Lieberman practiced seated with advisers at an oval table, a scene reporters were briefly allowed to view. Aides said that while some exchanges had been videotaped so they could critique the senator's style, they had not yet gotten to staging full-fledged mock debates.</p>
        <p>In the practice sessions, Mr. Cheney is being played by Bob Barnett, a Washington lawyer who helped Democrats prepare for presidential or vice-presidential debates in every campaign from 1976 to 1992.</p>
        <p>''He's being very tough,'' Mr. Lieberman said. ''He's the Cal Ripken of debate preparation.''</p>
        <p>The moderator, Bernard Shaw of CNN, is being played by Don Verrilli, another Washington lawyer. Directing the entire process is Jonathan Sallet, a longtime friend and informal adviser of the senator's.</p>
        <p>''In some ways it's therapeutic,'' Mr. Lieberman said of the preparations. ''This is the time to not only get ready for the debate, but to step back and think about the major messages that Al Gore and I are trying to convey, the differences between us and Bush and Cheney in terms of what matters to people.''</p>
