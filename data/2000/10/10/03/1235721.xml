        <p>Assembly Speaker Jack Collins, who had been a leading contender for the Republican nomination to succeed Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, abruptly quit the 2001 governor's race today, leaving his counterpart in the State Senate, Donald T. DiFrancesco, the likely front-runner.</p>
        <p>Mr. Collins announced his withdrawal in a terse statement that said nothing about his reasons. But a spokesman said that Mr. Collins had bridled at having to ''curry favor'' with party officials, fund-raisers and the leaders of constituent groups, preferring to spend more time with his family in Salem County.</p>
        <p>Mr. DiFrancesco, a moderate from Union County who has been planning a run since 1997, had been bedeviled in recent months by Mr. Collins, a skilled tactician with a former basketball star's knack for the legislative equivalent of rebounding: stalling Mr. DiFrancesco's initiatives, then enacting them on his own terms.</p>
        <p>''This increases Donnie's chances dramatically,'' said Stephen A. Salmore, a Republican political consultant. ''It gives him the opportunity to lay out an agenda he can run on, without having to worry about jousting with Collins to get it passed. The pattern always had been, Donnie laid something out, and Collins kept his counsel till the very end, then pulled the rug out and did something different.''</p>
        <p>Mr. DiFrancesco, the Senate president, is now likely to face a determined primary challenge from Bret D. Schundler, the mayor of Jersey City, a former Democrat who is a darling of the national neoconservative movement. Mr. Schundler said the departure of Mr. Collins, who like him opposes abortion rights and gun control legislation, would leave the party's conservative wing to Mr. Schundler alone.</p>
        <p>''It's a great day,'' Mr. Schundler said. ''Don has always been a little left of center, which is not where the bulk of the primary vote is. His hope was that Jack Collins and I would split the center-right portion of the Republican Party, which is like 90 percent of the party.''</p>
        <p>He added, ''I think I'll be able to knock Don out of this primary, potentially.''</p>
        <p>Still, in New Jersey, where the chairmen of the county parties wield enormous kingmaking power in primaries, ideology has rarely been a match for organizational support. Mr. DiFrancesco has already won the backing of Republicans in Burlington County, whose support was crucial to Representative Bob Franks's victory in the recent primary for the United States Senate. And he has been endorsed by the county executives in Bergen and Mercer.</p>
        <p>By contrast, Mr. Schundler's influence is limited outside Hudson County, although he has had the support of James W. Treffinger, the Essex County executive.</p>
        <p>Mr. DiFrancesco issued a brief statement today saying only that Mr. Collins ''would have been a formidable candidate.'' But Tom Wilson, a former director of the state's Republican Party who is advising Mr. DiFrancesco, said Mr. Collins's decision could make Mr. DiFrancesco's nomination all but inevitable.</p>
        <p>''This makes people's lives a lot easier in general,'' he said. ''The most difficult choice that the Republican leadership had was between Jack and Don. It wasn't between Bret and Don, or Jack and Bret.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Wilson suggested that with James E. McGreevey already the presumptive Democratic nominee, Republicans would rally around Mr. DiFrancesco and ask Mr. Schundler to withdraw. ''There'll be pressure to become unified more quickly,'' he said. ''It does not make sense to have to spend money in a primary that we could better spend to win the big prize, the governor's office.''</p>
        <p>But the field could still widen, several Republicans said. Besides Mr. DiFrancesco and Mr. Schundler, others who are expected to consider running in the wake of Mr. Collins's withdrawal are two other men from southern New Jersey: State Senator William L. Gormley, a veteran lawmaker from Atlantic County who placed a close second in the Republican primary against Mr. Franks, and Representative Frank A. LoBiondo, a three-term congressman from Cumberland County.</p>
        <p>Mr. Collins, who signaled his interest in the governor's race in January, made public his decision to abandon it in a three-sentence statement circulated to reporters after he had already left the State House. His chief of staff, Donald Sico, said Mr. Collins had left because he was expected at a tea held by a Republican women's group in Sussex County.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sico said Mr. Collins would not endorse a gubernatorial candidate until at least after the November election. He also said that Mr. Collins, who runs a farm in Pittsgrove, about an hour and a half south of Trenton in Salem County, had simply grown disenchanted with what was required of candidates for governor.</p>
        <p>''He tried it, and didn't like it,'' Mr. Sico said. ''He enjoys being home with his family, and taking care of the farm animals, a lot more than he enjoys running around the state of New Jersey.''</p>
