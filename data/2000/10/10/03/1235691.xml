        <p>The Xerox Corporation, citing lower sales at a time of rising costs, warned investors yesterday that it would report a third-quarter loss of 15 cents to 20 cents a share.</p>
        <p>Xerox made the announcement after the stock market had closed, promising to elaborate at an 8:30 a.m. conference call with analysts today. But investors were not patient. Shares of Xerox, which had closed at $15.31 -- actually up 31 cents -- plummeted in after-hours trading, to as low as $12.50, its lowest level since October 1993.</p>
        <p>While few analysts had anticipated actual red ink, most had expected Xerox to have a lackluster quarter. According to Charles L. Hill, research director of First Call/Thompson Financial, analysts rushed to lower their earnings estimates in late July, when Xerox warned that the entire second half of this year would be disappointing. Before then, analysts had predicted earnings of 38 cents for the quarter; as of yesterday, the consensus was just 12 cents.</p>
        <p>It was still unclear yesterday whether Xerox's problems were specific to the company, or a sign of a general malaise in the industry. For its part, Xerox cited a potpourri of reasons for its projected loss: weak sales in September, increased competitive pressures, European currency deteriorations, all compounded by higher bad-debt provisions and increased costs to resolve customer administration issues.</p>
        <p>But numerous office equipment and imaging companies, including Lexmark, Kodak, Apple and Intel, have issued earnings warnings for the third quarter, and most have attributed it to plunging sales. Several analysts yesterday suggested that uncertainty about the economy might have prompted consumers and businesses alike to put off buying new copiers or printers.</p>
        <p>''We've been doing channel checks for a week now, and we're seeing softness in copiers, printers, digital cameras, all kinds of equipment,'' said Gibboney Huske, an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston.</p>
        <p>Xerox, which is based in Stamford, Conn., does have a unique set of problems, though. It still suffers the after-effects of a misconceived sales force reorganization in early 1999, in which it switched from assigning sales territories by geography to a system in which sales representatives were assigned to specific industries. Confusion ensued, and many experienced representatives left.</p>
        <p>At the same time, Xerox also consolidated many back-office operations last year, causing backlogs in accounts receivables and billing problems. Thus, many Xerox invoices went unpaid, while the sales representatives had to cope with new clients even as they fielded irate calls from old ones.</p>
        <p>''An economy that's generally weaker than people thought it would be is part of the equation, but we can't deny there are problems at Xerox and that obviously some of those problems have gotten worse,'' said Jack L. Kelly, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company.</p>
        <p>Xerox's sales force woes could not have come at a worse time. Heidelberger Druckmaschinen A.G. of Germany, Canon Inc. of Japan, and most recently, I.B.M. -- with a high-speed copier that uses a Heidelberger engine -- are making deep inroads into the market for Segment Six copiers, which are extremely high-speed copiers that are Xerox's most profitable product line. And both Canon and Ricoh are cutting heavily into sales in so-called Segment 5, the next-fastest machines. Moreover, analysts say Ikon Office Solutions, Canon's main distributor, is poised to step up its marketing efforts for Canon copiers.</p>
        <p>Indeed, despite the seeming pall on the office equipment industry, Canon, which is Xerox's main competitor in copiers, --and Hewlett-Packard, which is the main rival in printers, seem to be relatively unscathed. Hewlett announced recently that it would meet earnings expectations.</p>
        <p>And Canon, seems to be going full steam. ''I get the sense that Canon's performance is on track, and it is clear that Canon continues to gain significant market share in all its segments,'' said Jonathan Rosenzweig, an analyst with Salomon Smith Barney.</p>
        <p>Xerox already is planning some belt tightening. ''Clearly, actions beyond resolving our operational issues are required, including major cost reductions, asset dispositions and a review of the dividend level,'' Paul A. Allaire, Xerox's chairman,  and Anne M. Mulcahy, its president, said in a joint statement yesterday.</p>
        <p>Some analysts suggest that the company might shed its financing businesses or its facilities management business. Still others suggested that Xerox would sell its stake in the myriad software companies it has helped start recently, or even take them public. And quite a few suggested that Xerox will have to cut back on its investments in inkjet printer technology, even though the company has often pointed to printer sales as a major part of its future revenue.</p>
        <p>''The fact is, they are losing money in inkjet, and maybe they'll have to lower their competitive intensity for now,'' Ms. Huske said.</p>
        <p>Still, most analysts shrugged off  rumors that Xerox would be taken over. Hewlett-Packard, an obvious suitor, would run into formidable antitrust objections, while Canon would risk alienating Ikon and its other major distributors. And, perhaps most telling, as one analyst put it, ''In the shape they're in, who would want them?''</p>
