        <p>This is a 30-second commercial that went on the air during the weekend promoting a law that Representative Rick A. Lazio, the Republican Senate nominee, sponsored that allows the working disabled to continue to receive government health benefits even after finding a job, under certain conditions. But New York State is not participating in the program, so its residents cannot get the benefit.</p>
        <p>PRODUCER -- Murphy, Pintak, Gautier, Hudome Agency</p>
        <p>ON THE SCREEN -- The ad opens with a shot of a woman, Jerina, moving down a sidewalk in a motorized wheelchair. It then shows a man, Brian, sitting in a wheelchair in a kitchen and being given a drink by a nurse. Jerina then speaks directly into the camera, followed by a quick shot of Mr. Lazio speaking to Gov. George E. Pataki. Jerina is next shown working in an office, followed by Brian speaking into the camera.</p>
        <p>THE SCRIPT -- Jerina: ''My lifelong goal was to go to work.''</p>
        <p>Brian: ''I've always wanted to be productive.''</p>
        <p>Announcer: ''For too long, Medicaid rules told the disabled if they took a job they'd lose their nursing care.''</p>
        <p>Jerina: ''And so there I was facing some really hard choices.''</p>
        <p>Announcer: ''Rick Lazio wrote the work incentives bill that protects disabled people from losing their benefits.''</p>
        <p>Jerina: ''Rick's bill brought me a real sense of hope.''</p>
        <p>Brian: ''For once I'll be able to go to work and be like everyone else -- a normal guy.''</p>
        <p>ACCURACY -- Mr. Lazio sponsored the legislation, the Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act, which was signed into law in December. It allows some mentally and physically impaired people to remain eligible for Medicaid while earning up to $45,000 a year, and sets aside $250 million to help states that join the program pay for it.</p>
        <p>But it is not in effect in New York, because over the summer, the Republican-controlled State Senate did not take up the bill for a vote. The people in the ad, said Dan McLagan, a spokesman for Mr. Lazio, are New Yorkers -- not actors, he said -- and were aware that the program had not been instituted in the state.</p>
        <p>SCORECARD -- The commercial gives the false impression that Mr. Lazio's bill helps disabled New Yorkers. It does not. The Democrat-led Assembly passed a measure that would have included New York in the plan, but the Senate did not support it, despite 11th-hour lobbying by Mr. Pataki after Mr. Lazio, whose candidacy the governor is promoting, entered the race in May. Mr. Pataki's administration had initially balked at the legislation's cost, at least $13 million a year, but Mr. Pataki has been quietly lobbying legislators to take it up later this year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio's aides say it is not meant to be misleading, and they say the people on camera are referring to their hopes for the future under the law, on the assumption that one day, New York will choose to participate. Viewers are unlikely to pick up on that. A spokesman for Hillary Rodham Clinton, Mr. Lazio's Democratic opponent, called the advertisement ''a cruel and cynical fraud.''</p>
