        <p>The space shuttle Discovery is set to blast off on Thursday for the embryonic International Space Station, a mission that will represent milestones for both the reusable space plane and its destination.</p>
        <p>The Discovery's 28th trip into space will also be the 100th flight for the space shuttle program, and the mission, which involves hauling up a nine-ton exterior framework for the station and a three-ton docking port, begins a new phase in expanding the orbital research outpost.</p>
        <p>The space shuttle fleet built by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, which in almost 20 years has taken about three million pounds of cargo and 250 people into space, is finally doing what its planners hoped it would: building and servicing a space station.</p>
        <p>The foundation of the space station now consists of three, pressurized modules, two built by Russia and one by the United States, weighing about 115,000 pounds. Onto this base will be attached girder-like, lattice-work metal trusses. This framework will support expansion of the station into a set of modules and structures ultimately weighing almost a million pounds and spanning an area larger than a football field with its solar power panels.</p>
        <p>The Discovery and its crew of seven are to deliver and install the first section of this framework, called the Z1 truss. The first of several giant solar panels made by the United States are to be attached to it by the end of the year.</p>
        <p>The shuttle, commanded by Col. Brian Duffy of the Air Force and with Lt. Col. Pamela A. Melroy of the Air Force serving as pilot, is to lift off from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on the 11-day mission at 9:38 p.m. on Thursday.</p>
        <p>''The foundation for the International Space Station has been laid, and this mission begins the true station buildup in orbit,'' said Ron Dittemore, NASA's space shuttle program manager. ''With multiple spacewalks planned and multiple components to attach, we're taking the level of complexity up a notch over the past few station construction flights.''</p>
        <p>The first truss structure going to the station also houses four large gyroscopes that later will help maneuver and stabilize the outpost, and  equipment that will improve voice and television transmissions from the station.</p>
        <p>During the Discovery's mission, two pairs of astronauts are to make four spacewalks to connect components of the truss and the new docking port to the station. The four, Leroy Chiao, William S. McArthur, Peter J. K. Wisoff and Michael E. Lopez-Alegria, are each to make two  six-and-a-half hour spacewalks in four days, doubling the time crews have spent working outside the station on four earlier flights to the complex. The spacewalkers will be assisted by Koichi Wakata, an astronaut from the Japanese Space Agency, who will operate the shuttle's 50-foot robot arm to move cargo from the shuttle to the station.</p>
        <p>Robert Cabana, NASA's international operations manager for the station, said this mission would be the most complex yet to the station and likened the astronauts' tasks to those of construction workers framing a tall building. ''The Z1 truss is like a backbone for the rest of the systems coming aboard,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Space station construction started in November 1998 when Russia launched its Zarya control module, followed that December by a space shuttle attaching the American Unity connecting node. Russia finally sent up the third segment, its long-delayed Zvezda command module, last July, providing what will be living quarters for the first crews assigned to the station. Beginning in early November, an American and two Russian astronauts are to begin permanent staffing of the station with a four-month tour.</p>
        <p>American shuttles have visited the complex three other times, including a mission by the Atlantis last month to bring supplies, perform maintenance and increase the station's altitude, which slowly drops because of atmospheric drag.</p>
        <p>Seven shuttle flights to the station are planned within a year. They represent a refocusing of NASA's human spaceflight initiatives from the shuttle itself to the $60 billion station being built by 16 nations, led by the United States. Much of the research and other activities once done by shuttles will shift to the station to benefit from longer periods of reduced gravity, while the shuttles take up a more supporting role.</p>
        <p>Dr. Howard E. McCurdy, a historian at American University in Washington who specializes in space issues, said that even decades ago, visionaries who thought of space stations also imagined reusable shuttle craft that would ferry crews and logistics between the outpost and the Earth. ''They were always viewed as halves of the same system,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In the period after the Apollo Moon landing, money for space projects decreased sharply, Dr. McCurdy said, and NASA decided to go for a reusable launching system first with the idea of later using it to build a station.</p>
        <p>To win support for the shuttle, NASA officials made what proved to be exaggerated claims about what a shuttle fleet would do and how it would greatly reduce the cost of sending payloads into place. To justify the shuttle economically, they said the system could be used to launch all of the nation's scientific, civilian and military payloads, he said.</p>
        <p>''There was talk of getting 25 to 50 flights a year with four or five shuttles and of operating costs of $50 million per flight in today's dollars,'' he said. The shuttle system proved more complicated than first envisioned, and the government appropriated less money for it than NASA requested, forcing extended delays between President Richard M. Nixon's approval to build the shuttles in 1972 and the first flight of the shuttle Columbia on April 12, 1981.</p>
        <p>When it became clear that the shuttles needed too much preparation to be launched every week or two, and that each flight was much costlier than first estimated -- now about $400 million each -- the military pulled out of the project and put its payloads on expendable rockets, Dr. McCurdy said.</p>
        <p>NASA realized even before the shuttle Challenger exploded in 1986 that it could not undertake even a dozen missions a year, experts said. After the Challenger accident and the loss of its seven-member crew, launching policy was changed to exclude most commercial payloads and restrict shuttles to cargoes that only it could launch or that required a human presence.</p>
        <p>In spite of its past problems, experts say the space shuttle has one of the highest reliability ratings of any space rocket and can perform missions that no other launch vehicle, with or without a crew, can.</p>
        <p>''The shuttle, despite its disappointments, is a technical marvel that can do things no other spacecraft can do,'' Dr. McCurdy said. ''It didn't meet its cost or schedule goals, but it's an amazing machine. Twenty years after it first flew, there's nothing else in the world like it.''</p>
