        <p>The police made him an example of what they called their get-tough policy on people who drove while drunk. Civil libertarians cited him as an example of a victim of a flawed city policy that was too aggressive.</p>
        <p>But for 19 months, Pavel Grinberg, who lost his car in the first criminal case resulting from the citywide crackdown on drunken driving, has simply wanted to get his Acura back from the city pound. And yesterday, Mr. Grinberg's wheels were finally returned.</p>
        <p>Not that it was easy.</p>
        <p>Even though the case against him was dismissed nearly a year ago, Mr. Grinberg, who came to be identified with the city's crackdown on drunken driving, was forced to embark on a four-borough journey in order to secure his gold-colored sedan.</p>
        <p>The case against Mr. Grinberg, a Staten Island librarian who came to this country from Russia in 1992, started on Feb. 21, 1999, when police officers at a checkpoint in Brooklyn stopped him after they saw him swerving and following other cars at close range. A Breathalyzer test showed his blood alcohol level at 0.11, a shade above the legal limit and enough for his vehicle to be confiscated under a city policy that went into effect that very day.</p>
        <p>In January, the case against Mr. Grinberg was tossed out of court after prosecutors said that one of the arresting officers had been charged with perjury in another drunken driving case and that the arrest itself had been riddled with ''sloppy mistakes.''</p>
        <p>''While every case has its inconsistencies and problems of proof,'' Charles J. Hynes, the Brooklyn district attorney, said at the time, ''the evidence in this case is so fraught with errors, misstatements, changed statements and memory failures, it is impossible to prosecute.''</p>
        <p>Even though the charges were dropped in January, Mr. Grinberg said, the first word he received from the city concerning the car was a note that arrived last week informing him that the Acura would be sold at auction if he did not reclaim it by Friday.</p>
        <p>So yesterday morning, Mr. Grinberg, 29, went from his home on Staten Island to the Manhattan office of his lawyer, Norman Siegel, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, to get his help in reclaiming the car. Together, they drove to the College Point Auto Pound in northern Queens where they assumed the car would be waiting.</p>
        <p>Instead, Mr. Grinberg said, they discovered that officials at the Queens auto pound only had the paperwork and that the car itself was in Red Hook, Brooklyn. So Mr. Grinberg and his lawyer drove to the Erie Basin Auto Pound in Red Hook, 35 or 40 minutes away.</p>
        <p>When they tried to enter the pound to examine the car, Mr. Grinberg said, they were stopped at the gate by city workers who told them that only employees could enter.</p>
        <p>They waited, Mr. Grinberg said. Mr. Grinberg called his wife on a cell phone to tell her that the car was almost back in their hands. And after they had waited more than an hour, the Acura was pulled from the lot by a tow truck. Mr. Grinberg climbed in and put the key in the ignition. He hit the switch. There was no spark, no sound -- there was nothing, he said. The engine was dead.</p>
        <p>Mr. Siegal said it took so long for Mr. Grinberg to recover his car -- it was eight months after his criminal case was dismissed and 19 months after his arrest -- because the wheels of bureaucracy turn so slowly.</p>
        <p>''Every time we thought we were on the verge of getting the car back,'' Mr. Siegel told a reporter who had followed them on their citywide trek, ''there was another hurdle to jump. Even with three lawyers from the civil liberties union, Pavel still had to go through all of this.''</p>
        <p>In the end, Mr. Grinberg had the car towed to his house on Staten Island. But he said he was smarting from his brush with bureaucracy.</p>
        <p>''Thank God I got it, finally,'' he said. ''I just wish nobody had to go through this.''</p>
        <p>''I wouldn't even expect it in Russia.''</p>
