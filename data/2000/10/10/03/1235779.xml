        <p>Ariel Sharon and Yasir Arafat both deserve blame for instigating this week's tragic events in Jerusalem (front page, Oct. 2). But primary responsibility must fall on Ehud Barak.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak campaigned for prime minister on a promise to achieve a peace treaty with the Palestinians even at the cost of concessions -- except for the concession of dividing Jerusalem. When he reneged, he lost the support of the Israeli public, and his lack of conviction encouraged Mr. Arafat to hold out for still further concessions.</p>

        <p>Ariel Sharon and Yasir Arafat both deserve blame for instigating this week's tragic events in Jerusalem (front page, Oct. 2). But primary responsibility must fall on Ehud Barak.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak campaigned for prime minister on a promise to achieve a peace treaty with the Palestinians even at the cost of concessions -- except for the concession of dividing Jerusalem. When he reneged, he lost the support of the Israeli public, and his lack of conviction encouraged Mr. Arafat to hold out for still further concessions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sharon's grandstanding visit to the Temple Mount was a foreseeable reaction by an opposition leader seeking to attract the support of disenchanted moderates who felt betrayed by Mr. Barak. And the riots and their consequences -- which were clearly orchestrated by Mr. Arafat and the Palestinian Authority -- were, in turn, a foreseeable response to Mr. Sharon.</p>
