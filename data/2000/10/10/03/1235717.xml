        <p>Seeking a greater piece of the world's largest market for automobiles, the Hyundai Motor Company plans to invest more than $1 billion to build its first production plant in the United States.</p>
        <p>The new plant will be able to produce 300,000 vehicles a year, with cars scheduled to roll out in 2003, the company's chairman, Chung Mong Koo, said at the Paris motor show last week, according to a company spokesman, Min Hyung Joon. Mr. Chung was also quoted as saying that construction would begin in the second half of 2001.</p>
        <p>A site for the United States plant has not yet been chosen, the spokesman said.</p>
        <p>Through generous after-service benefits in the last 10 years, Hyundai, South Korea's largest automaker, has tried to improve the reputation of its cars sold in the United States. The efforts included a five-year 60,000-mile warranty and a 10-year 100,000-mile after-service guarantee on engine and transmission parts.</p>
        <p>Hyundai's stake in the United States car market rose to 2.7 percent at the end of August, compared with 1.7 percent a year earlier. Hyundai and an affiliate, Kia Motors, forecast combined sales of 390,000 vehicles in the United States this year.</p>
        <p>In June, DaimlerChrysler agreed to buy a 10 percent stake in Hyundai Motor with an option to buy 5 percent more in the next three years.</p>
