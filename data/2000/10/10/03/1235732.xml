        <p>For most of the season, the Chicago White Sox have been successful but hiding in plain sight, drawing attention to themselves only occasionally and drawing far fewer fans than the struggling Cubs.</p>
        <p>In April, the White Sox battled the Detroit Tigers in a vicious fight that resulted in 25 suspensions. In June, the Sox took a seven-day road trip through Cleveland and New York and came back with seven convincing victories that put them ahead to stay in the American League Central.</p>

        <p>For most of the season, the Chicago White Sox have been successful but hiding in plain sight, drawing attention to themselves only occasionally and drawing far fewer fans than the struggling Cubs.</p>
        <p>In April, the White Sox battled the Detroit Tigers in a vicious fight that resulted in 25 suspensions. In June, the Sox took a seven-day road trip through Cleveland and New York and came back with seven convincing victories that put them ahead to stay in the American League Central.</p>
        <p>The last of them was a 17-4 triumph at Yankee Stadium. Chicago pitcher Sean Lowe, who will start Game 4, if it is necessary, of the first round of the playoffs against Seattle this week, sat that afternoon in the Bronx with his teammates and came to a conclusion.</p>
        <p>''We were looking at each other in the bullpen and saying, 'Man, we are pretty good!' '' Lowe recalled today at Comiskey Park.</p>
        <p>They may find out exactly how good beginning Tuesday when they open a three-of-five-game series against the Seattle Mariners. The winner meets the Yankees or the Oakland Athletics for the A.L. pennant.</p>
        <p>Even though the Mariners are the wild-card team and didn't clinch a postseason berth until the last game of the season on Sunday, they have more postseason experience than the White Sox. Chicago last made the playoffs in 1993, last reached the World Series in 1959 and last won the championship in 1917.</p>
        <p>The Mariners no longer have Ken Griffey Jr., but they still have more recognizable stars than Chicago's, including Alex Rodriguez and Edgar Martinez. The White Sox will have home-field advantage, but Seattle will be favored by most fans and pundits, in part because the White Sox have so many injured starting pitchers.</p>
        <p>''We're underdogs,'' said the slugger Frank Thomas, Chicago's best-known player, who finished the season with 43 home runs, 143 runs batted in and a batting average of .328. ''We've got nothing to lose, everything to gain.''</p>
        <p>Referring to the medical troubles of the starting staff, Thomas said, ''It's tough, but we're going to stick together and deal with it.''</p>
        <p>Among Chicago's injured pitchers are Mike Sirotka, Cal Eldred and James Baldwin. Sirotka, whose record of 15-10 makes him the biggest winner on the team, will not start Game 1 against Seattle's Fred Garcia, as previously planned, because he has a sore elbow and has been taking injections to kill the pain. Sirotka threw today, but his manager, Jerry Manuel, said that another day off would do him ''a world of good.''</p>
        <p>He is expected to start Game 2 on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>Starting Game 1 in place of Sirotka will be Jim Parque, who was 13-6. Eldred, who went 10-2, will not pitch in this series because he, too, has an arm problem and needed a five-inch screw surgically inserted in his elbow last month.</p>
        <p>Baldwin, scheduled to start Game 3 in Seattle on Friday, finished 14-7 and has a sore shoulder that is said to be improving. He threw 69 pitches in losing to Kansas City on Sunday in the season finale.</p>
        <p>Another dimension to this team is the perception of it inside and outside Chicago. Although the White Sox led the division most of the season, they drew only 1.95 million fans to their modern stadium on the South Side. The Cubs, who finished last in the National League Central, drew 2.73 million at old Wrigley Field on the North Side.</p>
        <p>On talk radio today, hosts and callers complained that the White Sox have to play their first two home games in the afternoon so that the television networks can show both New York teams in prime time. There are big chips on big shoulders here in the Second City, and Parque is among those taking offense.</p>
        <p>''The media has put a damper on the season, saying we're stumbling into the playoffs,'' he said, referring to Chicago's 2-6 record to close the season. He said the players resented their videotaped game highlights ''being last on SportsCenter and all that.''</p>
        <p>Thomas, who played on the 1993 team that lost in the playoffs to Toronto, implied that increased fan support and public attention in the playoffs could be a mixed blessing for a young team that does not count sure-handed fielding as one of its strengths.</p>
        <p>When asked what he advised his younger teammates, Thomas said: ''The toughest thing to deal with is the crowd being involved in every pitch. The intensity level is much different. The world is watching. Guys seem a little more tight.'' But he added: ''We've played well when this place is packed.''</p>
        <p>Manager Lou Piniella noted that the White Sox, unlike his Mariners, ended the season with no pressure. ''We've been playing playoff baseball for the last 10 days,'' he said. ''It's good coming in that way.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes, a team goes flat and it's hard to get the momentum going. I'm not saying that's the case with the White Sox or any team in the playoffs. But it's a possibility. We've won 9 of our last 10 road games, which is a pretty good accomplishment. We're starting off here in Chicago, the first two games on the road. Hopefully, we can make that 11 out of 12.''</p>
