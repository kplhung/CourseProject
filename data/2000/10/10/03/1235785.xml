        <p>Last week, Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, were having a garden party, breaking pita bread and trading jokes in the yard of Mr. Barak's private suburban home in Israel.</p>
        <p>This week, their people are killing each other. Palestinian rocks are flying, Israeli tanks are charging, and bodies are piling up at the morgue. With every day of violence, each leader is expressing greater distrust of the other side, and both sides are reverting to the negative dynamic of their old, familiar roles as enemies.</p>
        <p>There are bound to be bitter debates about what motivated Ariel Sharon, the opposition leader and veteran hawk, to enter the Islamic holy compound Haram al Sharif under a huge guard last Thursday, given the near-certainty that the Palestinians would see it as a provocation, just as there will be endless debates on whether the Palestinian reaction was spontaneous or orchestrated.</p>
        <p>But whatever the answers, the explosion showed how quickly everything can turn upside down here. How quickly, too, the language of force can take over, pushing aside the careful legalese of the many peace agreements, with all their prefaces, appendixes and coda. How quickly the peacemaking relationship can give way to the basest, barest ethnic and religious animosities, jeopardizing so much of what has been established during the last seven years.</p>
        <p>For the moment, five days and 48 deaths into the worst violence since 1996, everything is unclear: how long the conflict will last and what will be its toll on a human level, politically and diplomatically.</p>
        <p>How many days or weeks of bloodshed does it take to shut down the peace effort? How many does it take only to damage the negotiating relationship, strain the security cooperation and tax personal and economic relationships between Israelis and Palestinians?</p>
        <p>With such uncertainty, everything that was on the front pages here last week is now frozen: Mr. Barak's political machinations to reassemble a coalition, speculations about a political comeback by former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, an American bridging proposal to nudge the two sides closer to a draft peace treaty. Last week, Israelis were debating the pros and cons of allowing public buses to run to the beaches on the Sabbath; this week, needless to say, they're not.</p>
        <p>Many here believe that spasms of violence, historically, have led to peace breakthroughs -- the October War of 1973 to the Israeli-Egyptian peace of 1978, the intifada, or Palestinian uprising, that started in 1987 to the Oslo interim peace agreement of 1993. During the 15-day Camp David summit meeting last summer, several regional experts were skeptical about the chances of a final peace agreement because, they said, another round or two of bloodshed was needed.</p>
        <p>Right now, though, it is hard for many here to imagine that this violence could be a pivotal moment for peace.</p>
        <p>The Palestinians say that the Israelis provoked a confrontation in order to force on them their version of peace. They put the blame squarely on Mr. Sharon. But they maintain that Mr. Barak should never have allowed the visit, which the Palestinians warned beforehand would ''open the Pandora's box,'' as Faisal Husseini, a senior Palestine Liberation Organization official in Jerusalem, said today.</p>
        <p>Some Israeli officials, in turn, think that the Palestinians are engaging in dangerous brinkmanship in an effort to extract concessions. The Palestinians, they say, are disguising the deliberateness of their decision to use violence by depicting what they have orchestrated as a genuine grassroots uprising.</p>
        <p>Some senior Israeli officials quietly acknowledge that Mr. Sharon's trip to Haram al Sharif, accompanied by television cameras and hundreds of police officers, set things off. But they think that the Palestinians seized on it as the excuse to explode that they were awaiting, and Mr. Barak cautioned today against ''hanging this all'' on Mr. Sharon.</p>
        <p>What was Mr. Sharon's motive? Mr. Sharon maintained that it was just an ordinary visit by an Israeli to what Jews call Temple Mount, above the remains of the First and Second Temples -- among the holiest sites of Islam, the holiest of Judaism. Many Israelis applauded him for this, whatever the consequences.</p>
        <p>Political experts here, however, widely speculated that Mr. Sharon was trying to steal the spotlight from Mr. Netanyahu, his rival for leadership of the right wing, on the day after corruption charges against Mr. Netanyahu were dropped. Additionally and more significantly, Mr. Sharon, an old-time hard-liner, was seen to be making a deliberate nationalist statement, well aware of its potential both to hijack the peace efforts and to undermine Mr. Barak.</p>
        <p>Yossi Sarid, leader of the leftist Meretz Party, compared Mr. Sharon to ''a Nero who amuses himself while igniting a blaze.'' Dalia Itzik, the environment minister, called Mr. Sharon a ''serial arsonist.''</p>
        <p>With Mr. Sharon, symbol of an older generation of Israeli hawks, back in the forefront and rioting back in the streets, many Israelis and Palestinians said they felt a dizzy sensation of backsliding.</p>
        <p>But there was the possibility that things would move only so far backward because the violence was taking place in the context of a serious, if deadlocked, relationship of peacemaking. An intricate set of interim agreements already in place between the Israelis and the Palestinians governs every facet of their interconnectedness, from water to trade. So while the security relationship deteriorated this week, there is still an effort to maintain normality on other fronts. That made for some odd juxtapositions.</p>
        <p>In the midst of the rioting, for instance, the Israelis took the unusual step this week of keeping the border between Gaza and Israel open for Palestinian day laborers. In the past, a border closing would have been automatic.</p>
        <p>''We are engaged in a juggling act,'' said Col. Daniel Reisner, director of the Israeli army's international law department. ''We're using combat helicopters and tanks, yet we're trying to keep the boat afloat. We don't want the civil and economic arrangements to follow the security ones into collapse.''</p>
        <p>And peace talks in the past have survived outbreaks of violence. In 1995, when the Israelis and Palestinians were negotiating an interim peace agreement in Eilat, there was a series of terrorist bus bombings. After the first one, the negotiations broke off for a week. After the fourth, the negotiators interrupted their work for only a day.</p>
        <p>But the longer the hostilities continue, the more difficult it will be to restore the negotiating relationships, which in any case have been strained of late.</p>
        <p>The idealists hoped that the hostilities would serve to remind Israelis and Palestinians of the chaos that could await them if they abandoned the peace effort.</p>
        <p>''What we are seeing today is the glorious alternative to peace,'' said Shimon Peres, a former Israeli prime minister.</p>
        <p>But many witnessing or experiencing the violence are wondering why they should bother with this kind of peace.</p>
        <p>''With our blood, we have drawn the borders of our state, through the West Bank, Gaza and Jerusalem,'' said Bashir Barghouti, a Palestinian who wore a white patch over an eye shot when Israeli troops stormed the holy site last Friday.</p>
        <p>''On behalf of all the injured, I ask the leadership to declare the Palestinian state now.''</p>
