        <p>New York City officials are considering a temporary cut in the 4 percent local sales tax on heating oil to ease the pain on homeowners and businesses who have been hit by the continuing surge in fuel prices.</p>
        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said yesterday that the decreases would require state approval, and added that he would urge state officials to do more to lower their share of heating oil sales taxes.</p>
        <p>The tax cut was one of several steps proposed yesterday during five hours of hearings at City Hall on the best way to cope with a second winter of unusually high prices for home heating oil.</p>
        <p>''It is going to be a tough winter,'' Senator Charles E. Schumer said yesterday during his testimony before the Mayor's Task Force on Home Heating Oil. ''New York stands balanced on the knife's edge of an energy crisis.''</p>
        <p>Even after President Clinton's recent decision to release 30 million barrels of crude oil from the national  reserves, home heating oil in New York City is selling for about $1.65 per gallon, industry executives said yesterday; the price was about $1.20 at this time last year, and the price could go to $2 a gallon or higher before the winter is over.</p>
        <p>Some fuel-saving steps proposed yesterday -- lowering the minimum required nighttime temperature in apartment buildings to 52 degrees, for example, or shortening the period when heat is required to be turned on by two months -- were quickly ruled out by city officials as unlikely.</p>
        <p>But the mayor indicated that he had already conferred with City Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone about temporarily reducing or eliminating the local heating oil sales tax, which generates about $30 million a year from homeowners and businesses.</p>
        <p>If the 4 percent city sales tax were dropped, it would save about $100 in a home using 1,500 gallons of fuel this winter, assuming that the current price remains. For businesses, the mayor would like to cut or eliminate an 8.25 percent heating oil tax, which is made up of the 4 percent local share, a 4 percent state share and a 0.25 percent tax for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, officials said.</p>
        <p>Even a temporary exemption on the local heating oil tax would require state legislative approval, city officials said. But the mayor made it clear he wanted the state and perhaps even the federal government to cut some of their own heating oil taxes.</p>
        <p>''We want to see whether we can put a whole group of them together, so that we can have a real impact,'' Mr. Giuliani said yesterday. ''Just to cut the city's tax all by itself would be symbolic, but it really wouldn't help very many people.''</p>
        <p>Joseph E. Conway, a spokesman for Gov. George E. Pataki, said the governor had not received a formal request from the mayor to consider a cut in the state sales tax, but he noted that the state had already moved to reduce a separate business tax on heating oil by 33 percent over the next two years.</p>
        <p>''Governor Pataki has already cut energy taxes by a combined total of $1.3 billion,'' Mr. Conway said. ''We are always willing to take a look at additional tax-cut proposals.''</p>
        <p>Oil industry executives did give city officials assurances yesterday that the mid-Atlantic region's heating oil inventory could meet the demand. At 23.3 million barrels, the inventory is about half what it has averaged over the last three years.</p>
        <p>But the executives asked government officials to consider several steps to try to ease the supply shortage, which is a large part of the reason prices are up. For example, one oil industry official asked Senator Schumer to push the federal government to approve a waiver allowing fuel oil with slightly more sulfur to be used in the city, which would mean more air pollution.</p>
        <p>But that brought a quick protest from at least one member of the task force on heating oil.</p>
        <p>''New York City's air is already compromised,'' said Chris Meyer, executive director of the New York Public Interest Research Group, one of seven members of the panel. ''This would only further exacerbate respiratory illnesses in the city.''</p>
        <p>The Rent Stabilization Association, which represents owners and managers of over one million housing units, proposed the temporary changes in minimum heating temperatures and the so-called heating season, which now runs from Oct. 1 to May 31. By cutting a month from each end and reducing the nighttime minimum temperature from 55 degrees to 52 degrees or the daytime minimum from 68 degrees to 65 degrees, landlords would conserve oil and save money with ''no danger, or even real discomfort, to tenants,'' said Joseph Strasburg, president of the association.</p>
        <p>City officials and Mr. Meyer said such changes were unlikely. ''My jaw dropped on that one,'' Mr. Meyer said.</p>
        <p>The hearings on heating oil are set to continue this morning, and the task force will eventually prepare a report for the mayor about steps the city can take to soften the effect of the oil shortage.</p>
