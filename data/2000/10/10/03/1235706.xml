        <p>As a general strike hit much of Serbia, President Slobodan Milosevic went on national television today to implore his citizens to reject the designs of what he called a traitorous opposition and to re-elect him.</p>

        <p>As a general strike hit much of Serbia, President Slobodan Milosevic went on national television today to implore his citizens to reject the designs of what he called a traitorous opposition and to re-elect him.</p>
        <p>His challenger, Vojislav Kostunica, who says he won the presidency outright in elections on Sept. 24, made a triumphant visit to several thousand striking mine workers, promising them that Mr. Milosevic will not steal their victory from them. Mr. Kostunica vowed again that he would not participate in a second-round runoff that Mr. Milosevic has called for Oct. 8.</p>
        <p>''Thank you for what you've started, just hold on and we will finish this struggle together,'' Mr. Kostunica told the workers and their families at the Kolubara mine, 30 miles south of Belgrade. They shouted his name and called him ''president.''</p>
        <p>It was a day of high drama, with Mr. Milosevic's sudden television appearance the best indication that the opposition's efforts to organize a general strike were having an impact. The opposition is trying to force Mr. Milosevic to relinquish his office to Mr. Kostunica, but Mr. Milosevic showed little sign of going willingly.</p>
        <p>While Belgrade was relatively unaffected, other towns throughout Serbia were brought to a halt, including Nis, Novi Sad, Cacak, Pancevo and Uzice. Roads and railways were blocked, schools and businesses were shut and two major coal mines vital to Serbia's electricity continued to be idled by striking workers. Thousands of students rallied all over the country, leaving their classes.</p>
        <p>The opposition says its strike efforts will peak on Thursday, with efforts to bring hundreds of thousands of people to a large rally in Belgrade.</p>
        <p>In his first television address since the election Sept. 24, Mr. Milosevic said a victory by Mr. Kostunica and the opposition would mean the subjugation of Yugoslavia, its further disintegration and its occupation by foreign forces. He said the world ''is not attacking Serbia because of Milosevic but Milosevic because of Serbia,'' a line he used before, in the 1992 Serbian presidential campaign.</p>
        <p>Saying that ''my conscience is clear,'' Mr. Milosevic insisted that he was speaking from disinterested motives, and he seemed less to threaten than to plead with citizens not to choose the side of the same NATO countries that bombed Yugoslavia.</p>
        <p>''I believe I have a duty to caution the citizens of our country to the consequences of activities financed and supported by the governments of the NATO countries,'' he said. ''People can believe me or not. My wish is that they do not see the validity of my warnings too late, that they do not do so once it is too late to right the mistakes citizens made by themselves in their naivete, shallowness or ignorance.</p>
        <p>''By yielding their country to others, to a foreign will, they are also yielding their own lives and the lives of their children and many other people to a foreign will,'' Mr. Milosevic said.</p>
        <p>''The leadership of the democratic opposition, with the money that they have received from abroad, is buying, blackmailing and scaring citizens and organizing strikes and violence in order to stop production, work and any activity -- to stop life in Serbia,'' he said, and he vowed to protect the nation.</p>
        <p>But his attack on his opponents as traitors and NATO dupes was an echo of his failed campaign before the first round, where even by the count of his own Federal Election Commission, he lost to Mr. Kostunica by more than 10 percentage points.</p>
        <p>Many Serbs said they found Mr. Milosevic's tone much more personal than in any of his past speeches.</p>
        <p>''The speech showed a weak Milosevic in some panic,'' said Zarko Korac, an opposition leader who is also a psychologist. ''His highness came out from behind others and got down into the mud, throwing insults with the very vocabulary that voters rejected during the elections.''</p>
        <p>But unless the opposition can force Mr. Milosevic from office before then, he will hold the runoff on Sunday with Mr. Kostunica's name on the ballot -- and possibly win by default, declaring himself duly elected.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Kostunica says to take part in the runoff would be to recognize theft. And because the opposition sees Mr. Milosevic as having stolen the first round, it also sees no reason to trust that he will not try to do the same in a second round.</p>
        <p>''They've stolen everything -- our lives, history and now the elections,'' Mr. Kostunica told the miners at Kolubara, an hour from Belgrade, who have stopped producing the coal on which half of Serbia's electricity depends. ''But we will not allow them to do this. This time we have caught him with his hand in our pockets. There will be no second round. The elections are over.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kostunica seems to mean it, and he shows no signs of changing his mind despite some calls for him to alter his stance and participate in a second round regardless, to put an electoral coup to Mr. Milosevic.</p>
        <p>In an earlier news conference, Mr. Kostunica criticized both Russia and the United States for acting like ''great powers.'' President Vladimir Putin of Russia today invited both Mr. Milosevic and Mr. Kostunica to Moscow for talks on resolving their electoral dispute, but implicitly seemed to recognize the validity of the Oct. 8 runoff. It was a clear rejection of a statement by the German government on Sunday claiming that Mr. Putin recognized Mr. Kostunica as the outright winner of the election.</p>
        <p>''As president of Russia, I am prepared to receive in the next few days in Moscow both candidates who have gone through to the second round, Yugoslav President S. Milosevic and the leader of the Democratic Opposition of Serbia V. Kostunica, to discuss means of finding a way out of the current situation,'' Mr. Putin's statement said. Undermining his offer, he then left on a four-day visit to India.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kostunica attacked Russia today ''for defending the indefensible'' and carrying out ''an indecisive policy -- one step forward and then one step back.''</p>
        <p>The United States, he said, by its constant harping on the handover of Mr. Milosevic to face war-crimes charges in The Hague, was turning the election into a matter of life-and-death for Mr. Milosevic. ''The Hague has no connection with the results of this election,'' Mr. Kostunica said.</p>
        <p>''America, in each and every State Department statement, misses no chance to remind everyone of Slobodan Milosevic's Hague indictment, as if that indictment is more important at this moment than the future of the whole country, its people and stability in the region,'' Mr. Kostunica said. ''It's as if, with such statements, America wants to strengthen Milosevic in his belief that these elections are a question of life and death for him.''</p>
        <p>The Milosevic government has urged miners at Kolubara and at Kostolac, in eastern Serbia, to return to work, saying that power outages would result from their actions. As many as 10,000 coal miners are on strike, saying that they will remain idle until Mr. Milosevic recognizes Mr. Kostunica's victory.</p>
        <p>The state electric company warned that the strikes jeopardize ''big infrastructure systems, such as the water-supply system, sewage system, city transport, bakeries, health and other institutions.''</p>
        <p>State news media also showed serious signs of unrest. Journalists at the daily newspaper Vecernje Novosti threatened to strike unless the editorial policy became balanced, and its computer technicians have already struck. Journalists at the Belgrade television station Studio B, taken over by the Serbian government in May, also threatened to strike for balanced coverage.</p>
        <p>While it is unlikely to bring down the government, the Serbian Society of Composers and the Alliance of Composers' Organizations of Yugoslavia also called on their members to put down their pens.</p>
        <p>In his news conference, Mr. Kostunica rejected a suggestion floated by the ruling coalition and even Mr. Milosevic's brother, the Yugoslav ambassador in Moscow, that Mr. Milosevic could leave office and appoint himself federal prime minister. But Mr. Kostunica said the post belonged constitutionally to a Montenegrin from the largest party in Parliament, and he suggested that he would nominate Predrag Bulatovic, deputy leader of the pro-Belgrade Socialist People's Party. Mr. Bulatovic, unlike the leader, Momir Bulatovic, has distanced himself from Mr. Milosevic.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kostunica, a careful constitutional lawyer, seems to be taking his new responsibilities with seriousness and some sense of mission.</p>
        <p>''I don't like the word revolution,'' Mr. Kostunica said today. ''But what is happening in Serbia today is a revolution -- a peaceful, nonviolent, clever, civilized, democratic revolution. People are ready to start building a new country.''</p>
