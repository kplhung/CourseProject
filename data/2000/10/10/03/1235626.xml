        <p>Anyone who has ever tenderly held a young baby is familiar with the instinctive desire to protect the child's head from harm.</p>
        <p>This is in part because babies' necks are weak, of course, but also because the bones in the skull are not yet fully fused together.</p>
        <p>Now researchers have determined just how much weaker an infant's skull is than an adult one, a finding that could have ramifications for a range of child-safety devices.</p>
        <p>Scientists from the University of Pennsylvania have determined that the young skull is only an eighth as strong as an adult one.</p>
        <p>They also found that the skulls are far more easily deformed by blows to the head, making the babies' brains more vulnerable to injury.</p>
        <p>The findings, published in a recent issue of The Journal of Biomechanical Engineering, were based on a study of infant cadavers.</p>
        <p>Dr. Susan S. Margulies, an associate professor of bioengineering, found that developing skulls sustained much greater deformations when struck. But the researchers said they did not know whether this meant that brain injuries were more severe.</p>
        <p>Since children's skulls and the sutures that join their plates in the head reach full strength and thickness at early adolescence, the study may help people who design products like car seats and bicycle helmets.</p>
