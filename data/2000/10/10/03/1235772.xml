        <p>HAUPPAUGE: FIRE ISLAND SPRAYING CANCELED  Suffolk County has called off the spraying of West Nile virus pesticide over Fire Island because of unfavorable wind and other conditions, said Dominick Ninivaggi, an official at the county's Department of Public Works. The spraying also became less necessary as temperatures cooled. Environmental groups had criticized the extensive aerial spraying of the pesticide Anvil because of the possible danger to humans and animals.</p>

        <p>HEMPSTEAD: TAX CUTS FOR VETERANS' PARENTS  The Town of Hempstead is considering a bill that would offer property-tax exemptions to parents of veterans who died in military service. The proposal, from Republican Councilmen Joseph J. Kearney and Anthony J. Santino, calls for an annual reduction of about $5.57 per thousand in town property taxes for such parents. Veterans and their spouses already receive such benefits. A public hearing is scheduled on Oct. 24.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: HAMMER ATTACK  A 30-year-old man was critically injured after he was repeatedly hit in the head with a hammer about 8 p.m. Sunday in Chinatown, the authorities said. The man, Kun Lin, was able to telephone his girlfriend, who called the police. Officers found Mr. Lin slumped in a doorway in front of 69 Eldridge Street, near Hester Street. Officer Joseph Cavitolo, a police spokesman, did not describe the assault as racially motivated but said investigators believed the attack stemmed from a personal dispute. Mr. Lin was taken to Bellevue Hospital Center, where he was unconscious and listed in critical condition.</p>

        <p>BROOKLYN: TEENAGER DROWNS  A 16-year-old boy from the South Bronx drowned in the ocean off Coney Island yesterday, the police said. The boy, Benjamin Ramos of Walton Avenue, took the day off from school to go to the beach with two female friends, said Sgt. James Foley, a police spokesman. While the girls, 16 and 13, stayed on the beach, Benjamin went into the surf, but about 200 feet from shore he started screaming for help and disappeared, the girls told the police. Police divers found his body in the water three hours later, around 3:30 p.m., Sergeant Foley said.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: AGENCY CHIEF RESIGNS  Edward T. Ferguson III, chairman of the Trade Waste Commission, which regulates commercial trash rates, has resigned. Mr. Ferguson, who worked to reduce the influence of organized crime in the trash-hauling industry, is taking a job with Investigative Group International, a group based in Washington that provides investigative services to corporations, law firms and others. Raymond V. Casey, the deputy commissioner, is taking over as acting commissioner and chairman.</p>

        <p>CONNECTICUT</p>
        <p>WALLINGFORD: PAID KING HOLIDAY  An arbitration panel has ordered nonessential town offices closed for the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, giving town employees a paid day off and ending a longstanding dispute. In a decision released yesterday, the panel voted 2 to 1 to reject the town's offer to exchange another holiday for King Day, saying Wallingford could afford to give its employees 13 paid days off. Wallingford was the only Connecticut municipality that did not close its offices on the January holiday. Mayor William Dickinson Jr., who had wanted the town's six unions to make the holiday exchange, said he would not appeal the ruling.</p>

        <p>UNCASVILLE: NEW MOHEGAN CHAIRMAN  The Mohegan tribal council chose Mark F. Brown as its new chairman yesterday, to succeed the longtime leader, Roland Harris. Mr. Brown, a former Norwich police officer, said his leadership would mean a ''seamless transition'' for Mohegan Sun casino customers and state and local governments. The tribe will continue its $950 million expansion of the casino to include more gaming space, a convention center, a 1,500-room hotel and other amenities. Mr. Harris, who led the tribe for five years through the casino construction and plans for its expansion, remains a member of the council.</p>

        <p>TRENTON: SENATE APPROVES H.M.O. BILL  The Senate approved a bill yesterday that would allow lawsuits against health maintenance organizations when a denial or delay of treatment results in death or injury. Officials and consumer advocates say it will curb decisions by H.M.O.'s to deny care based on cost at the expense of the patient's health. But opponents of the measure said it would lead to frivolous lawsuits and rising legal costs that would, in turn, produce higher insurance premiums that could result in less insurance coverage. The measure must be approved by the Assembly and signed by Gov. Christine Todd Whitman to become law. The governor and Assembly Speaker Jack Collins have expressed concerns about it.</p>

        <p>SPOTSWOOD: ARMS CACHE FOUND  Firefighters arriving to put out a blaze at the home of a Vietnam War veteran found a cache of rocket launchers, grenades, assault rifles and at least two human skulls. Authorities also found more than 10,000 rounds of live ammunition, a Bronze Star for meritorious service, knife and sword collections, and Nazi flags and helmets at the home of the veteran, Richard E. Schaefle, 54, a retired radiologist. Mr. Schaefle had been granted bail of $50,000 on Sunday after being charged with weapons possession, but yesterday prosecutors filed new charges, and jailed him on 10 counts of unlawful possession of illegal machine guns.</p>

        <p>NEW BRUNSWICK: THEATER CANCELS SEASON  The Crossroads Theater, which two years ago won a Tony Award as outstanding regional theater, canceled its entire 2000-2001 season to allow the reorganization of its financial operations, the board announced yesterday. Dale Caldwell, the board president, also announced his resignation, citing his father's ill health and demands on his time at the Newark Alliance and New Brunswick School Board. Rhinold Lamar Ponder, a lawyer, will serve as interim board president of Crossroads, which has focused on African-American plays.</p>

        <p>TRENTON: GAMBLING EDUCATION  The State Senate voted yesterday to put a course on compulsive gambling in the mandatory curriculum for all public schools. Children are twice as likely to become problem gamblers than adults, said Keith Whyte, executive director of the National Council on Problem Gambling. While many local districts across the country have such programs, New Jersey could be alone in mandating one statewide, Mr. Whyte said.</p>
