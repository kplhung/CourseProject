        <p>A Brooklyn school district failed to request competitive bids for three staff conferences at hotels in the last two years and then greatly exceeded Board of Education spending limits,  according to an audit released yesterday by the city comptroller.</p>
        <p>Community School District 15, which includes the Park Slope, Carroll Gardens, Red Hook and Cobble Hill neighborhoods in western Brooklyn, spent $69,000, or nearly $43,000 more than allowed under Board of Education guidelines, on the three conferences, which took place from September 1998 through June 1999, the audit reported.</p>
        <p>The three conferences were conducted at the Marriott World Trade Center hotel, the Brooklyn Marriott and the Harrison Conference Center in Glen Cove, N.Y. Most of the expenses that exceeded limits were for food; unless special permission is obtained, Board of Education guidelines allow districts to spend $5 per person for breakfast and $8 for lunch. District 15 staff members, by contrast, spent $12.50 to $46 per person for meals at the conferences, the audit report said.</p>
        <p>The district, which is overseen by Superintendent Frank DeStefano, was unable to document a request for permission to exceed the spending limits and failed to win approval to sidestep normal competitive bidding rules, according to the report, which was issued by the office of Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi.</p>
        <p>Mr. DeStefano was out of the office and unavailable for comment yesterday afternoon. The report said the district and the central Board of Education had agreed with the findings and the recommendation that the district adhere to the spending limits in the future.</p>
        <p>Guy Carlsen, the assistant deputy comptroller for audits, said no evidence of fraud had been uncovered in the examination of District 15 spending.</p>
        <p>District 15 and Mr. DeStefano have come under fire recently from parents' groups in Brooklyn that are unhappy with the superintendent's management and the district's financial condition. Board of Education budget reports indicate that the district has exceeded its budget in each of the last two fiscal years, including an overrun estimated at $1.2 million in the fiscal year that ended in June.</p>
        <p>Mr. Carlsen said the audit, which was conducted during April and May 1999 and updated after the June 1999 conference, was being released now because it had undergone revisions and was only recently completed after the comptroller's office received responses from the district and the central board.</p>
