        <p>When Mike Bordick joined the Mets in late July, an old teammate who had spotted him had something to tell him. ''You're going to like it over here,'' Armando Benitez said. ''The guys are great.''</p>
        <p>Bordick did not take that as a comparison to the Baltimore Orioles, the last team for both. To Bordick, it was simply an expression of enthusiasm from a pitcher who has grown comfortable with his ability and with his surroundings.</p>
        <p>''That right away told me he was happy with the team,'' said Bordick, the Mets' shortstop. ''That feeling has carried over into his performance.''</p>
        <p>Benitez saved 41 games this year, a personal and franchise record. Manager Bobby Valentine emphasizes relief pitching, and the success of Benitez and John Franco, Benitez's setup man and mentor, are major reasons the Mets reached the playoffs two seasons in a row.</p>
        <p>The Mets open their National League division series Wednesday at Pacific Bell Park against the San Francisco Giants, who had the best record in baseball this season. The last time Benitez pitched here, on May 4, he gave up a bases-loaded triple to Bill Mueller and a two-run homer to Jeff Kent, the decisive hits in a Giants victory that completed a four-game sweep of the Mets.</p>
        <p>Benitez was slumping then, tired after a busy first month after a spring training in which he reported at 260 pounds, 25 more than his ideal weight. In his next game, at Florida, he allowed a grand slam. But since then, Benitez has 33 saves and a 1.37 earned run average.</p>
        <p>He can even take a joke about his girth. A few weeks ago in Montreal, as Benitez gave an interview, the rookie outfielder Timo Perez interrupted and pointed to a magazine. The cover photo was of Refrigerator Perry, the massive former Chicago Bear. ''Benitez,'' Perez said.</p>
        <p>Benitez simply shook his head and laughed. ''People here are funny,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Yes, Benitez said, this is the happiest he has been in his major league career, which began with the Orioles in 1994. In his first six years, he was an apprentice to Lee Smith, Doug Jones, Randy Myers and Franco, a collection of closers with 1,548 career saves. This was the first full season Benitez alone had the job.</p>
        <p>''It was just a matter of timing,'' Bordick said. ''He had to get the mind-set and understand the closer role. He's taken it and he's running with it.''</p>
        <p>Benitez, 27, took it from Franco, the 40-year-old left-hander who lost the job after injuring a finger in July 1999. The Mets would have traded Franco last winter if he had wanted to pursue Smith's career saves record elsewhere. But Franco stayed and Benitez's new four-year, $22 million contract stamped him as the closer. Both developments pleased Benitez.</p>
        <p>''Nobody can do what Franco does, and I appreciate how he is,'' Benitez said. ''Every time, he showed me. Every time, he helped me do my job. I don't want to disappoint him. I don't want to make him feel down. If not for him explaining a lot of stuff to me, I don't understand. Now, I understand.''</p>
        <p>The education started last year, when Benitez arrived with a reputation as something of a temperamental showoff. In 1998, he had stood defiantly on the Yankee Stadium mound after drilling the Yankees' Tino Martinez in the back, inciting a brawl. Early in his Mets career, he still could come across as immature, in love with his fastball.</p>
        <p>Last April in Montreal, Benitez rolled up his sleeves like the Expos' closer, Ugueth Urbina. It was a foolish challenge, Franco thought, and he told Benitez so.</p>
        <p>''You're so good, you don't need to do that,'' Franco said he told him. ''You don't want to give that team any extra incentive to beat you. You want to keep them down.''</p>
        <p>The lesson took immediately. Benitez has been ''a different guy'' since, said reliever Pat Mahomes. He is still flamboyant, Mahomes said, but it is only to motivate himself, not to show up the other team.</p>
        <p>''Johnny's the ultimate warrior, and he's been through everything,'' Mahomes said. ''Armando has to try to be a leech and ask Johnny what he's thinking in certain situations. Not, 'What would you do?', because their stuff is so much different that you can't watch what he does and do it. But you can still get a feeling of the mind-set, of what he wants to do.''</p>
        <p>Benitez gets help from several teammates, he said, but he speaks most reverentially of Franco, who could have made his succession awkward. ''When I want to ask him a question, I go to him and I don't have to be scared,'' Benitez said. ''He never says no.''</p>
        <p>Franco, who had a 3.40 E.R.A. this year and allowed no earned runs in 52 of his 62 appearances, holds no grudges. A free agent this past winter, Franco returned to the Mets for the chance to win the World Series. Helping Benitez can only help Franco.</p>
        <p>''We're all in this together, to win,'' Franco said. ''If I have anything that can help a young pitcher, that's great.</p>
        <p>''Basically, he's done it all himself. All I do is talk to him when he asks questions. It's good to see a young guy who's not afraid to ask questions, and who's willing to listen and respect my role.''</p>
        <p>That role encompasses more than the eighth inning, when Franco usually appears. Benitez is the closer, but Franco is considered the anchor because of his experience. He has 420 career saves, and the scores of defeats that go with them. Dealing with defeat is one way Franco has helped Benitez.</p>
        <p>When Benitez loses a game or blows a save, he often sits on the bench afterward, seething. The storm is usually over when he returns to the clubhouse, and Benitez is accountable, crediting the other team. ''He beat me; what can I do?'' is his refrain. Believing it did not come easily.</p>
        <p>''It took a little while, but it's better,'' Benitez said. ''I saw Johnny last year in a couple of situations that were real tough. I saw his expression, I saw his face -- I don't see him down every time. I try to be like him.''</p>
        <p>To Benitez's teammates, the most impressive thing about him is his pitch selection. He can blow away hitters -- he had 106 strikeouts in 76 innings -- but his slider and changeup have become more effective.</p>
        <p>Now, when Benitez looks at the scoreboard, he is checking the ball-strike count, not admiring his radar-gun readings as he did in Baltimore. Now, when catchers Mike Piazza and Todd Pratt handle Benitez, they know his mind is working.</p>
        <p>''Last year, it was almost like he wanted to throw everything Mike and I called, and he never shook off a pitch,'' Pratt said. ''Now, he's shaking us off and throwing his pitch. That shows maturity right there, because he's thinking about what he wants to do on the mound. He's become a pitcher, not just a power guy.''</p>
        <p>Benitez gave up home runs to Pat Burrell of the Phillies on consecutive nights in June. Over his next 31 appearances through early September, he allowed only one earned run.</p>
        <p>Pratt links that success to Benitez's reliance on his slider -- and his resistance to pumping a fastball thrown so hard, it has torn through the webbing in three of Mahomes's gloves during routine pregame throwing.</p>
        <p>Benitez does not often miss his mark in games, either. This seems to be his formula: If you're happy and you know it, throw strikes.</p>
        <p>''He's consistently throwing strikes,'' Bordick said. ''When you have that overpowering fastball combined with that hard slider, if you can throw strikes and get ahead of guys, they're going to have to be more aggressive and they're going to swing at bad balls.</p>
        <p>''The good thing now is that he's gotten to the point where his confidence level has skyrocketed. That's the No. 1 thing -- he knows he's got it, and he's just letting his talents go.''</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>The Mets gathered at Shea Stadium Monday but did not practice. They traveled to San Francisco, arriving shortly before 5 p.m. Pacific time. Twenty-nine players were on the flight, with ROBIN VENTURA and TODD ZEILE given permission to fly to Southern California to spend the day with their families. The rookies ERIC CAMMACK, GRANT ROBERTS and JORGE TOCA did not accompany the club.</p>
