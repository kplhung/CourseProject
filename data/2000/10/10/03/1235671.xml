        <p>Maybe it was a blessing in disguise that viewership of the Olympics on NBC never reached the high levels the network had anticipated. That shortfall kept consumers from being more fully exposed to the generally dull and disappointing commercials that ran constantly during the broadcasts.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the estimated $900 million worth of spots appearing from Sept. 15 through Sunday were contaminated by the canned and claustrophobic nature of NBC's overedited, taped-delayed coverage of the Games. It could also be that steps taken by advertisers and agencies to counteract a strike by actors -- for instance, casting more employees who never previously worked in commercials -- made the spots less entertaining.</p>

        <p>Maybe it was a blessing in disguise that viewership of the Olympics on NBC never reached the high levels the network had anticipated. That shortfall kept consumers from being more fully exposed to the generally dull and disappointing commercials that ran constantly during the broadcasts.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the estimated $900 million worth of spots appearing from Sept. 15 through Sunday were contaminated by the canned and claustrophobic nature of NBC's overedited, taped-delayed coverage of the Games. It could also be that steps taken by advertisers and agencies to counteract a strike by actors -- for instance, casting more employees who never previously worked in commercials -- made the spots less entertaining.</p>
        <p>The strike may also be why so many pitches were delivered by announcers with British accents who all sounded so similar.</p>
        <p>Another problem with the spots was their wildly uneven tone. Some served up heaping portions of traditional Olympic cheer or schmaltz, like commercials for McDonald's by the DDB Worldwide unit of the Omnicom Group, which presented grinning athletes to illustrate the theme ''We love to see you smile,'' or commercials for Home Depot by the Richards Group, which celebrated the ''joy'' of competition.</p>
        <p>Then suddenly, along would come depressing, downbeat spots, like those about divorce and nursing homes from the John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company, by Hill, Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulos, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies.</p>
        <p>Or along would come spots dripping with hard-edged humor, like those about a bitter grandmother and an angry exchange student from Coca-Cola, by Cliff Freeman &amp; Partners. Or along would come smirky, sophomoric spots, like those for marketers too numerous to mention. The most egregious offender was Bud Light beer, brewed by Anheuser-Busch.</p>
        <p>Isn't it heartwarming to realize that the 2002 Winter Olympics are less than 500 days away?</p>
        <p>Now it's time to present make-believe medals in this columnist's post-Olympics advertising review. Some of the awful commercials received the dreaded lead medal for base, and debased, performance. Some of the many spots that rang falsely or fell short were presented tin medals. And the tiny handful of commercials worth watching qualified for gold.</p>
        <p>Here are examples of how advertisers and agencies fared:</p>
        <p>AMERICAN LEGACY FOUNDATION -- A national antismoking campaign aimed at teenagers, which carries the theme ''Truth,'' offered some powerfully persuasive commercials that deftly mocked the conventions of cigarette advertising. The impact of the spots was enlarged by the fact that issue advertising is rarely found during so-called big TV events. Gold. Agencies: Arnold Communications, part of Havas Advertising, and Crispin Porter &amp; Bogusky.</p>
        <p>GMC -- Some commercials, centered on actual employees of the GMC truck division of the General Motors Corporation, were workmanlike in their appeal. Others, though, introducing a 2002 model called the Envoy, dragged out every hokey device known to Detroit, including fireworks. Tin. Agency: Lowe Lintas &amp; Partners, part of the Lowe Group unit of Interpublic.</p>
        <p>I.B.M. -- Spots for the International Business Machines Corporation, promoting use of a Web site to track the Olympic performances of ''ten thousand local heroes,'' kept running in their original form throughout the Games. Why weren't they updated to describe how the athlete featured in each spot fared? Tin. Agency: Ogilvy &amp; Mather Worldwide, part of the WPP Group.</p>
        <p>MERCEDES-BENZ -- These light-hearted commercials for the new C-Class line of cars sold by a division of DaimlerChrysler effectively blended whimsy with copious ''beauty shots,'' satisfying consumers as well as dealers. One energetic spot, centered on the song ''Enjoy Yourself,'' served as a fitting tribute to the writer of the lyrics, Carl Sigman, who coincidentally died last week. Gold. Agency: Merkley Newman Harty, part of Omnicom.</p>
        <p>NBCi -- Gratingly chirpy spots for a revamped NBC Web site (www.nbci.com) seemed to appear as often as the NBC cameras showed the Sydney Harbor Bridge or a kangaroo -- that is to say, about every seven minutes. Lead. Agency: in-house.</p>
        <p>NIKE -- A fanciful commercial showing the cyclist Lance Armstrong using his ''healthy lungs'' to resuscitate an elephant was delightful, as was a spot in which a skateboarder eluded an inept Roman gladiator. Gold. They almost made up for an awful commercial, meant to spoof horror movies, that backfired when viewers complained it treated violence toward women too cavalierly and NBC pulled it off the air. Lead. Agency: Wieden &amp; Kennedy.</p>
        <p>J. C. PENNEY -- A commercial about a white couple adopting a baby from Asia was cluttered and hard to follow. And was it wise to run such a spot during an Olympics from Australia, whose racial policies sometimes upset its Asian neighbors? Lead. Agency: DDB.</p>
        <p>SATURN -- Spots for the Saturn division of General Motors were refreshingly and confidently candid as they sought to reclaim its image as a a scrappy, nontraditional automaker. Gold. Agency: Publicis &amp; Hal Riney, part of the Publicis Groupe S.A.</p>
        <p>CHARLES SCHWAB -- A delightful commercial for Charles Schwab &amp; Company, promoting a Web site for novice investors, showed a boy actor portraying a young Charles Schwab, circa 1951, who was already wise to the ways of Wall Street. Gold. Agency: BBDO New York, part of the BBDO Worldwide unit of Omnicom.</p>
        <p>SUBWAY -- This commercial for the Subway restaurant chain was messier than a hundred hero sandwiches. The plot was incomprehensible and the new spokescharacter was impossible to identify. It seemed to be the shadow of a clenched fist, or a hand puppet with a thyroid condition. Lead. Agency: Messner Vetere Berger McNamee Schmetterer/ Euro RSCG, part of the Euro RSCG Worldwide unit of Havas.</p>
        <p>TEXACO -- Several spots for Texaco, part of a long-running campaign carrying the theme ''A World of Energy,'' were good of their kind. But the regular voiceover announcer, the actor Paul Newman, was missing because he is honoring the actors' strike -- and the commercials clearly suffered for his absence. Tin. Agency: BBDO New York. (Similarly, the American Honda Motor Company spots by Rubin Postaer &amp; Associates were diminished by the absence of their regular voiceover announcer, the actor Richard Dreyfuss.)</p>
        <p>XEROX -- A commercial promoting a low-priced Xerox copier, featuring the ''blue dog'' paintings of the artist George Rodrigue, ends with a cheap bathroom joke unworthy of such a blue-chip brand. Lead. Agency: Young &amp; Rubicam Advertising, part of WPP.</p>
