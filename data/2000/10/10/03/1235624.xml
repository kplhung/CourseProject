        <p>Cheerleading is not what it used to be. While in the past, cheerleaders were little more than overcaffeinated dancers in itty-bitty skirts, these days they are athletes, real athletes. The head cheerleader is no longer the woman with the cutest smile and shapeliest legs, but the one with the best executed X-out double full twist. (Hint: don't try this at home.)</p>
        <p>With widespread competitive events, cheerleading has moved from the sidelines tp center court. Last year, more than 75,000 high school participants took part in cheerleading competitions, and the National Federation of State High School Associations  says that ''competitive cheer'' is the fastest growing sport for girls.</p>
        <p>ESPN and others televise cheerleading tournaments, which showcase the strength, agility and rhythm of the participants and feature heart-stopping action. (The new movie ''Bring It On'' offers a glimpse of cheerleading at its liveliest.) There is even talk of making cheerleading an Olympic sport in 2004.</p>
        <p>But some experts worry that cheerleading has become nearly as dangerous as the sports the cheerleaders root for. The National Electronic Injury Surveillance System pointed to 4,954 emergency room visits by cheerleaders in 1980, and over the past 20 years that number has increased steadily. Though cheerleading has become more popular over the years, injuries are growing faster than participation. The most recent estimate showed 21,096 injuries associated with cheerleading last year.</p>
        <p>''Cheerleaders put themselves in stunt positions virtually unlike any other sport,'' said Dr. Mark R. Hutchinson, associate professor of orthopedics and sports medicine at the University of Illinois at Chicago. ''When a girl is standing on someone's shoulders five feet in the air, she puts herself at a lot of risk.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Hutchinson also notes that cheerleaders, the vast majority of whom are girls or women, tend to incur more severe injuries than other athletes. His data show that the average cheerleader loses 28 to 35 days per injury, more than for any other sport.</p>
        <p>''Time lost from the sport may be related to the demands of cheerleading,'' said Dr. Hutchinson. ''Cheerleading requires that all extremities be functional for stunts and tumbling. Football players, on the other hand, can play with a cast on or put tape on a knee strain and go back on the field. Cheerleaders must be at full strength or sit out.''</p>
        <p>Cheerleading advocates believe the danger is exaggerated. ''We are all concerned about safety, but the fact is, the injury rate for cheerleading just isn't that high,'' said Greg Webb, senior vice president of the Universal Cheerleaders Association, an organization in Memphis that sponsors camps and competitions. He worries that naysayers are being patronizing and overprotective.</p>
        <p>''Yes, it's difficult for someone to see a cheerleader down, hurt on the sidelines. But no one is trying to ban football even as a guy is dragged off the field with his knee blown out,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Some experts, though, think cheerleading is more hazardous than football and other sports, especially when looking at very serious injuries. In its most recent report, the National Center for Catastrophic Sport Injury Research, which has looked mainly at  head and neck injuries from 1982 to 1999, noted that high school cheerleading accounted for 46.3 percent of all direct catastrophic injuries to female athletes and 76.2 percent at the college level. The overall number of fatalities in girls' and women's sports over the study period were few, but about half were related to cheerleading.</p>
        <p>''Cheerleading is the most dangerous of all sports women participate in,'' said Dr. Robert C. Cantu, medical director of the sports injury research center. ''And if you take away the broad base of cheerleaders and limit it to only those who are on top of a pyramid, then it is semi-suicidal.''</p>
        <p>Injury for injury, cheerleading does seem to be, in fact, more dangerous than football. Using data from the injury center and the National Federation of State High School Associations, the rate of direct catastrophic injuries for high school cheerleaders during the 1998-99 season was six times as high as it was for high school football players.</p>
        <p>''The absolute incidence of catastrophic head and spine injury is higher in football than in cheerleading, because so many more participants are involved in football,'' he said. ''But when you take the relatively small number of girls involved in cheerleading, the chance of catastrophic injury is higher than in any other sport, including football.''</p>
        <p>Experts agree that part of the problem hinges on whether cheerleading is classified as a sport or an activity. ''In a school, the athletes have the best practice spaces, access to the weight room and trainers and sports medicine staff at their disposal,'' said Dr. Hutchinson. ''But because cheerleaders get less respect, they are stuck with the last practice space, they work out on concrete and in many cases don't have a trainer to look after them when they get injured. Even though a cheerleader jumps off levels higher than a basketball player, people are more willing to accept a ballerina as an athlete than a cheerleader.''</p>
        <p>Even athletic governing bodies are not sure where cheerleading stands. At the high school level, 14 states consider cheerleading a sport and organize state championship competitions. The American Association of Cheerleading Coaches and Advisors, though, sees cheerleading in a gray area: while the organization agrees that cheerleaders are athletes, its leaders don't believe cheerleading is actually a sport.</p>
        <p>''We see it as an athletic activity,'' said Jim Lord, executive director of the coaches and advisers group, based in Memphis. ''Only about 25 to 30 percent of cheerleaders take part in some kind of competition. The primary purpose is to support the athletics at the school.''</p>
        <p>But, adds, Greg Webb of U.C.A., ''Cheerleading is strenuous. Dancing for 30 minutes and lifting a 130-pound person over your head are difficult. These are not out-of-shape kids, but committed athletes.</p>
        <p>To reduce injuries, the organizations that govern cheerleading have instituted new rules since the mid-1990's. In high schools, for example, pyramids can be no more than two people high, flips greater than one roll are not permitted and minitrampolines and springboards are not allowed. (Experts criticize ''Bring It On,'' since many of the stunts in the movie are prohibited in high school competition.)</p>
        <p>''We had to make some changes, because girls were no longer just doing sideline cheers,'' said Cynthia Doyle, assistant director of the National Federation of State High School Associations in Indianapolis. ''Stunts became very advanced in competition, and the skill levels were advancing much faster than the rules.''</p>
        <p>The coaches and advisers group administers a safety certification program and more and more coaches are supervising practices. The association also recommends that cheerleaders receive proper training before attempting any kind of gymnastics and that practice sessions be held in proper and safe settings.</p>
        <p>With the new rules and priority on safety, experts hope to see fewer injuries. ''Cheerleading has been made much safer, and there are now many people diligently working on the problem,'' said Dr. Cantu. ''But we constantly need to be aware of sports at highest risk and directing our attention toward making them safer.''</p>
