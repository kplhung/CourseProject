        <p>As a criminal investigation into financial irregularities at a large Roman Catholic church in Queens gained momentum, law enforcement officials said yesterday that some questions might never be answered, including precisely how much money was missing, where it had gone and how many people were culpable.</p>
        <p>A team of investigators for the Queens district attorney, Richard A. Brown, began examining the finances at Our Lady Queen of Martyrs Church in Forest Hills about two weeks ago, after the Diocese of Brooklyn reported that as much as $2 million was missing from the church's many accounts.</p>
        <p>The investigation has focused on the actions of Msgr. Thomas J. Gradilone, 75, who retired as the parish's pastor in January after nearly 20 years at the church. Bishop Thomas V. Daily, the head of the diocese, who addressed the congregation at five Masses on Sunday, said Monsignor Gradilone had told him he gave significant sums to people in need, an explanation, the bishop said, that has ''limited credibility.''</p>
        <p>The bishop said the diocese and the church were cooperating with the authorities. But a senior law enforcement official said yesterday that even with cooperation, the embezzlement investigation would be difficult for many reasons, not the least of which was that much of the missing money was believed to have been taken from the church's weekly cash collections, and would be difficult if not impossible to trace.</p>
        <p>The official said that no immediate answers were expected, and that the investigation would probably continue through the end of the year. To date, the investigators, who include prosecutors and an accountant, have not presented evidence to a grand jury, the official said, and no criminal charges have been filed.</p>
        <p>Frank DeRosa, a spokesman for the diocese, acknowledged yesterday that the parish might have had inadequate financial controls, but that the diocese had been working to improve accounting procedures at its many churches.</p>
        <p>''We have been very, very attentive to the needs of strengthening internal controls over recent years,'' Mr. DeRosa said. ''We're satisfied as to how that has developed. But in a diocese with 217 parishes, 156 schools and 20 programs or agencies, sometimes things fall through the cracks. That may have been the case here.''</p>
        <p>Mr. DeRosa also said that in late summer, the diocese hired auditors from Grassi &amp; Company, a Nassau County accounting firm, to review the parish's books, and that their results would be shared with prosecutors.</p>
        <p>Church officials declined to release the names of the parish's trustees yesterday.</p>
        <p>Our Lady Queen of Martyrs is one of the most prominent Roman Catholic parishes in the borough, with as many as 4,000 or 5,000 worshipers attending the seven Masses each weekend. It owns a stately church on Queens Boulevard and operates an elementary school.</p>
        <p>Bishop Daily and law enforcement officials said they were looking into many possible theories, including reports from parishioners that Monsignor Gradilone was exceedingly generous to questionable causes, or that he might have been duped into transferring church money to friends or parishioners who took advantage of his charity.</p>
        <p>Mr. DeRosa said the diocese had a list of about six names or partial names of people to whom Monsignor Gradilone said he gave money. He declined to disclose the names, but said they would be turned over to the district attorney. Another law enforcement official said that one woman had come forward to say that she was concerned that the monsignor held sway over one of her relatives and may have taken money from her.</p>
        <p>Mr. DeRosa also said that the bishop's statement on Sunday that he was seeking a possible medical explanation for Monsignor Gradilone's activities was not meant as an indication that the retired pastor was ill, but rather was a reflection of the bishop's desire to leave no angle unexplored. He said the diocese expected to receive the results of a recent physical examination of Monsignor Gradilone.</p>
        <p>One longtime parishioner said yesterday that the monsignor had a reputation for frugality, in part because he had labored to keep down the tuition at the church's school, and because he was opposed to casinos and bingo as church fund-raising devices. Other people who know him said he lived modestly.</p>
        <p>Property records show that he owned a single-family house in Mastic Beach in Suffolk County, which he sold late last year for an estimated $85,000.</p>
        <p>Another person said the monsignor had invested money through a local stockbroker. A law enforcement official declined to comment on whether the monsignor's investments were an element of the case.</p>
        <p>Church officials said that Monsignor Gradilone left his home at the Immaculate Conception Center in Douglaston, Queens, on Saturday, and had been staying at an undisclosed location outside the diocese. An official at the center, which has a residence for about two dozen retired priests, declined to comment.</p>
