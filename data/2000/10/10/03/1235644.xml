        <p>Forget what I was, here's who I am, I need attention, I don't give a damn</p>
        <p>Me and my show, we just want to be loved</p>
        <p>Will people forget me after all I've been through?</p>
        <p>My poor little ego, what can I do?</p>
        <p>Watching Isaac Mizrahi belt out this new version of a Sondheim song from ''Anyone Can Whistle,'' you cannot help feeling a little uncomfortable: ''Isn't he wearing his heart on his sleeve? Doesn't this cut too close to the bone?'' And when the former fashion designer sits on a stool to deliver a melancholy rendition of ''Baubles, Bangles and Beads,'' you may find yourself feeling downright sad.</p>
        <p>But then, as Mr. Mizrahi proceeds to tell the story of how he got interested in fashion while standing with his mother in the ladies' communal dressing room at Loehmann's looking at all that ''huge'' underwear; as he effortlessly creates an elegant coat out of muslin before your very eyes on the sewing machine his father bought him when he was 11; as he sketches the gown he made for Helen Hunt for the Oscars, you are charmed, engrossed, won over. And you realize that, as is his wont, Mr. Mizrahi is defusing the tension, taking the questions on everyone's mind -- Is Isaac O.K? Has he survived the abrupt closing of his fashion business two years ago? What's he been up to lately? -- and confronting them head on with humor, seizing the subtext and singing about it.</p>
        <p>I was a mess, so discontent. Sometimes you just need to self-reinvent</p>
        <p>Clothes you outgrow and anybody can sew</p>
        <p>Love me love my show</p>
        <p>''That's a good way to give it to them if they want it,'' he said, ''in a song.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mizrahi is giving it to them in a one-man show he wrote, ''Les MIZrahi,'' which is produced by the Drama Dept., a nonprofit theater company, and starts previews on Thursday at the Greenwich House Theater at 27 Barrow Street in the Village. And holding forth at his airy Village apartment -- although it's a little cloudy from the American Spirits he constantly smokes -- Mr. Mizrahi, 38, said that contrary to what people might expect, he was doing just fine.</p>
        <p>''I'm feeling great about things,'' he said, wearing khakis and a tight gray T-shirt that showed off his newly slim body. ''I feel like I'm where I belong. I always felt I was where I belong, and now I feel this is absolutely right.''</p>
        <p>''It seems so simple to me, this chapter,'' he continued. ''I work, I get paid -- no losses and gains. It's just me, which is a nice feeling. And everything I have I own.''</p>
        <p>Though the stage may seem like a departure for a fashion designer, performing has been Mr. Mizrahi's path from the beginning. As a boy growing up in Brooklyn he took acting lessons and then attended the High School of Performing Arts in Manhattan. He also took piano lessons for 12 years. And of course, the 1995 documentary movie about Mr. Mizrahi, ''Unzipped,'' directed by his ex-boyfriend, Douglas Keeve, demonstrated clearly that Mr. Mizrahi was meant to be the main attraction, not just to make others look good on the runway. ''I dreamt of this my whole life,'' he said. ''When I was backstage at my fashion shows, I was ready to go out there and walk.''</p>
        <p>So when in 1998 his financial backer, Chanel, pulled the plug on his business after losses, Mr. Mizrahi said he viewed it less as a failure than as a fait accompli.</p>
        <p>Besides, the performing arts were always lurking in the background of his clothing lines, the designer said. ''It was my intention all those years, not just to predict lengths and colors that were going to be cute,'' Mr. Mizrahi said. ''I was trying to create a woman.''</p>
        <p>''I should have been Pedro Almodovar making movies about women,'' he added, ''instead of doing these big fictions.''</p>
        <p>He would see a ballet and do a collection about it, hear a piece of music and do another. ''Music runs my life, it runs my life,'' he said. ''Even when I was a fashion designer, I couldn't work unless I was deeply involved in some piece. Something was always nourishing me, giving me all this information about solving problems or putting puzzles together.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, people in the fashion world say that Mr. Mizrahi's theatrical side was apparent in his designing days. ''He has a camp sensibility,'' said Anna Wintour, the editor of Vogue. ''Even the way he would run down the runway at the end of a show, it was so vaudeville. He loves to show off.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mizrahi's 10-year stint in fashion was a heady time. He said that looking back at his appointment journals makes his head spin: meetings, photo shoots, fashion shows. But the designer-turned-actor said he hasn't looked back. ''I miss clothes a bit, textiles and women standing there and breasts and women's bodies,'' he said. ''I think women's bodies are so gorgeous, I don't know how men are tolerated.''</p>
        <p>''I got out of it what I needed to get out of it: the recognition of the clothes being divine and influential,'' he added. ''I was ready.''</p>
        <p>Even though he was unsure what form his stage career would take, Mr. Mizrahi said, he went forward unafraid. ''What would be the worst-case scenario? If I am waiting tables, waiting for an acting job?'' he said. ''Where do I sign up for that? That sounds like a dream.''</p>
        <p>While he does not think of himself as an expert singer, Mr. Mizrahi suggested that there were other ways to deliver a song effectively. That's why his show includes musical numbers like ''When You're Smiling,'' and ''Tea for Two'' accompanied by the Ben Waltzer Trio.</p>
        <p>''There are singers who are perfectly trained singers, and then there are singers who are like musical raconteurs,'' he said. ''I prefer to hear singing that isn't too pear-shaped because it seems smarter to me.''</p>
        <p>Douglas Carter Beane, the artistic director of the Drama Dept., said that Mr. Mizrahi's piece seemed like an appropriate kickoff to his company's new cabaret series. But he also said the show was more than just light entertainment. ''It could actually say something about someone who was at the top of their career,'' he said. ''Where do you go? What happens next? Through all that, you kind of do find what's important.''</p>
        <p>To write the piece, Mr. Mizrahi said, he started talking into a tape recorder, then wrote essays about various chapters of his life. An earlier version of the show produced by Susan Gallen and directed by Joe Mantello failed to get off the ground. The current incarnation, which was directed by Richard Move, was performed as a workshop in June.</p>
        <p>''The workshop was a real trial because I didn't know if I could do it -- selling, sketching, singing, performing,'' he said. ''Now that I know that I can, it's a matter of making a good show. But that's easier than whether I can or not.''</p>
        <p>So is this it? Show biz? Is the former wunderkind of fashion through with fur cuffs and satin ball gowns? ''Fashion is for me better when come at from a different perspective,'' he said. ''If clothes are in the future for me, this will be my main business and shows will come out of it.''</p>
        <p>''When I'm onstage, I feel like I am really slaying the dragon,'' Mr. Mizrahi added. (He has been reading the Harry Potter books of late.) ''Getting out in front of those people and engaging -- I find it so enriching, enriching, enriching, enriching.''</p>
