        <p>How times have changed. Forty years ago CBS, NBC and ABC broadcast the first-ever televised presidential debate, and that tense contest between Richard Nixon and John Kennedy was seen as not only the pivotal moment of the election, but a harbinger of how television would enhance democracy.</p>
        <p>Yet now, in the heat of the tightest presidential race since 1960, two of the four major networks -- NBC and Fox -- are offering viewers sports and entertainment in lieu of the first presidential debate. NBC originally planned to broadcast a baseball playoff game exclusively tonight, but now it has passed the buck to its affiliates to decide whether to air the game or the debate. Worse, Fox doesn't intend to show any of this year's debates as they are happening and will air the premiere of its series ''Dark Angel'' while tonight's is going on.</p>

        <p>How times have changed. Forty years ago CBS, NBC and ABC broadcast the first-ever televised presidential debate, and that tense contest between Richard Nixon and John Kennedy was seen as not only the pivotal moment of the election, but a harbinger of how television would enhance democracy.</p>
        <p>Yet now, in the heat of the tightest presidential race since 1960, two of the four major networks -- NBC and Fox -- are offering viewers sports and entertainment in lieu of the first presidential debate. NBC originally planned to broadcast a baseball playoff game exclusively tonight, but now it has passed the buck to its affiliates to decide whether to air the game or the debate. Worse, Fox doesn't intend to show any of this year's debates as they are happening and will air the premiere of its series ''Dark Angel'' while tonight's is going on.</p>
        <p>The decisions by NBC and Fox are particularly galling in light of the fact that in 1996 Congress gave the television industry the space on the broadcast spectrum needed to offer digital television -- valued by some industry experts as worth more than $70 billion.  This generous gift came with a caveat: As the broadcasters reap billions from use of the airwaves, they must also serve the public interest.</p>
        <p>There is no underestimating the importance of televised debates in our political system. In 1992, for example, 97 million people watched the third and final presidential debate, the largest audience ever for a political event.</p>
        <p>To their credit, the networks have usually delivered on their responsibility. From 1960 until this year, they all reserved programming slots for every debate with both major-party candidates. But in 1992 CBS refused to break away from a baseball game that had gone into extra innings to the first Clinton-Bush-Perot debate. Like NBC and Fox this year, CBS cited its contract with Major League Baseball.</p>
        <p>Some argue that the networks are right to respond to the viewers who would much prefer watching almost anything other than the first presidential debate. After all, as the broadcasters often remind us, they are in the entertainment business. But as the trustees of the public airwaves, the networks must do more than just entertain: they must also serve the needs of citizens by facilitating an informed democratic process. It is unacceptable that some networks carry the load for others.</p>
        <p>Not that the political campaign is such a burden to the industry: broadcasters pocketed $500 million from political ads in 1998 and may make twice that this year. Is it really too much to ask that the major networks televise three 90-minute presidential debates every four years?</p>
        <p>And the networks have already proved that they are willing to pre-empt sports for ''news.'' If NBC was able to cut away from the crucial fifth game in the 1994 N.B.A. finals to follow O.J. Simpson's white Bronco around Los Angeles, surely the networks can find a way to justify pre-empting a baseball game or a TV show so that Americans can more wisely choose their next president.</p>
        <p>One hopes that NBC affiliates will atone for their network's timidity and show the debate tonight. And in the future, the networks should remember that the public interest is far more important than their financial interest.</p>
