        <p>By many political calculations, Silicon Valley should be Al Gore country. After all, the vice president has championed high-technology issues, and eight years of a strong economy has created an unimaginable level of wealth here. Moreover, this academic region is a magnet for young college graduates who often gravitate to Democrats.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Gore leads the race in California, Gov. George W. Bush is giving him a run for his money in Silicon Valley. Mr. Bush is outpacing the vice president in contributions here by a 2-to-1 margin, raising $2.1 million to Mr. Gore's $1 million, while remaining neck and neck with him in soft-dollar contributions. And Mr. Bush's list of supporters in the computer-related industry is as gold-plated as Mr. Gore's.</p>
        <p>This heated race represents a new twist on traditional politics. As Silicon Valley emerges as a political factor in the presidential race for the first time, both candidates are investing time and energy here not only to win votes and dollars, but to win something more intangible but equally valuable: being identified as a candidate of the future and being linked with the forward thinking of the high-technology world.</p>
        <p>''Silicon Valley represents the crosscurrent of money and cool,'' said Gregory W. Slayton, chief executive of ClickAction Inc., an Internet marketing firm, and chairman of Silicon Valley Bush-2000. ''And that's where all politicians want to be.''</p>
        <p>And they are. Late last month, for instance, Mr. Bush came to Silicon Valley to campaign at a local school and attend a $1 million fund-raiser at the home of Carol A. Bartz, chief executive of Autodesk Inc., a software company.</p>
        <p>A week earlier, Mr. Gore was here for a $3 million fund-raiser at the house in Atherton of Eric Schmidt, chairman and chief executive of Novell Inc. Elton John flew in from London to entertain the 300 guests.</p>
        <p>The same day Mr. Gore was here, an advertisement in a local newspaper, The San Jose Mercury News, listed 300 high-technology executives backing Mr. Bush, including officials at Cisco Systems, Dell Computer, Texas Instruments, Microsoft, Intel -- many of whom also participated in a telephone conference call that day with reporters to extol Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>What is remarkable about this flurry of activity is that it comes as polls show Mr. Gore comfortably ahead of Mr. Bush in California -- especially in the San Francisco area, including Silicon Valley.</p>
        <p>A poll in mid-September by the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California had Mr. Gore leading by eight percentage points. It also showed Mr. Gore with 57 percent in the Bay Area, which combines heavily Democratic San Francisco and more-divided Silicon Valley, to Mr. Bush's 28 percent.</p>
        <p>With numbers as lopsided as this, conventional wisdom would dictate that neither candidates should waste time here. But conventional wisdom does not apply in Silicon Valley, which many see as a harbinger of American politics -- more about issues than parties and more sensitive to the endorsements of corporate ''opinion makers'' than the words of ward bosses and party leaders.</p>
        <p>Even more importantly, Silicon Valley is seen as the spot where trends begin.</p>
        <p>''We don't have to have 100 percent of the high-tech leaders,'' said Joe Andrew, chairman of the Democratic National Committee. ''This is not a numbers game, but an image game. High-tech leaders are like celebrities. They are validators, and that validation is important.''</p>
        <p>The Bush camp agreed. ''Everyone wants to associate with the future,'' said Margita Thompson, the Bush campaign's adviser on high technology. ''Silicon Valley is a way of thinking, a way of challenging things and a forward-looking mentality. Governor Bush wants to capture that.''</p>
        <p>While this effort may not be evident from Mr. Bush's national advertising, it is taking place in a more subtle effort. The Bush campaign set up a office in Redwood City, Calif., and has an e-mail campaign directed at high-technology leaders, especially chief executives.</p>
        <p>Many trace the area's new political involvement to the government's case against the Microsoft Corporation. But others say the political wake-up call here really came in 1996, when California voters took up Proposition 211, a ballot initiative that would have made it easier to bring class-action lawsuits against corporations -- especially Internet companies, whose share prices can fluctuate wildly, causing angry shareholders to sue.</p>
        <p>Silicon Valley companies and executives raised $40 million to defeat the measure, and later founded TechNet, a bipartisan political action committee made up of more 190 executives. The 2000 election is the first to feel the impact: Silicon Valley has raised $22.1 million for the current campaign, giving $11.9 million to Republicans and $10 million to Democrats, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a Washington nonprofit group that monitors campaign finance.</p>
        <p>These donations put the high technology industry on par with such other big donors as the energy, insurance, pharmaceutical and banking industries. But this money, remarkably, came on the scene almost overnight and is more than double the $9 million the industry gave in 1996 and in 1998.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Bush leads in direct donations, overall donations to both parties and candidates -- soft and hard dollars -- split evenly in the Bay Area. San Jose and San Francisco residents contributed $19.3 million overall, giving $10.5 million to Democrats and $8.6 million to Republicans. Moreover, executives of computer-related companies are writing six-digit campaign checks, and one Zip code alone, 94027 in Atherton, accounted for $2.1 million, $1 million to Republicans, $877,025 to Democrats and the rest to political action committees.</p>
        <p>''For years we stuck our head in the sand,'' said Kim Polese, chairwoman of Marimba, a software company, and a Gore supporter. ''But we've changed. People in the Valley have clicked into politics.''</p>
        <p>As the valley clicks into politics, it is doing so consistent with its highly competitive culture.</p>
        <p>Silicon Valley is the bastion of fierce entrepreneurship -- a place where thousands of entrepreneurs have escaped the rigidities of big corporations and struck out alone. And this creates opportunities for Mr. Bush and obstacles for Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>For all of his well-known forays into Silicon Valley through the years, Mr. Gore is seen by Republican executives as being close to two institutions despised by Silicon Valley, unions and trial lawyers, and as being emblematic of the type of big government involvement in business the valley abhors. Mr. Gore's troubles contrast with the success President Clinton had attracting Silicon Valley Republicans in 1996.</p>
        <p>''The underlying interest in Silicon Valley is in leaving business alone,'' said Tom Riley, president of WebState Inc., an online training company, and a Bush supporter.</p>
        <p>''For the most part,'' Mr. Riley said, ''the success of Silicon Valley has been because people are left on their own with a minimum of interference, red tape and bureaucracy. People here look at Gore and see a bureaucrat, a politician and someone from Washington.''</p>
        <p>Gore supporters disagreed. Silicon Valley's boom, they said, relied heavily on government investment, policies and on federal research grants that helped many of today's best-known corporate names.</p>
        <p>They said Mr. Gore has a demonstrated record of backing issues important to Silicon Valley: From programs that helped to create Web browsers and the Internet to backing overhaul of the telecommunications industry, from supporting more government funds for education and research to aiding small businesses market new technologies.</p>
        <p>''Silicon Valley has abandoned the myth of the lone entrepreneur in the garage able to change the world,'' said John Doerr, a chairman of TechNet and a partner at Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers, a venture capital firm.</p>
        <p>''We live in a highly networked and connected global economy and public policy matters,'' Mr. Doerr said. ''Al Gore is really a leader in understanding how government should engage with technology.''</p>
        <p>On paper, the candidates are pretty similar. Both support free trade, increased funding for basic research, efforts to improve education, expanding the H1-B visa program to allow more high-tech foreign workers to emigrate here and Internet privacy protections.</p>
        <p>But in offices and coffee cafes here, when talk turns to presidential politics, it is rarely about such specifics but rather about government -- friend or foe. The Bush campaign's involvement in this talk came from early groundwork by executives here who felt Mr. Gore was getting too much attention and made pilgrimages to Austin, Tex.</p>
        <p>''There was a tremendous amount of frustration among Republicans here that all the gold and glory was going to the Democrats and the area was being portrayed as locked up for Gore,'' said Lezlee Westine, head of TechNet's Republican politics section. As early as 1999, Ms. Westine took executives to Austin, set up a Bush advisory board on technology and put advertisements in California newspapers urging him to run.</p>
        <p>It didn't hurt, of course, that Texas has it's own high-tech area in Austin. ''Every semiconductor company has an operation in Texas,'' said Floyd Kvamme, also a partner at the venture capital firm of Kleiner Perkins.</p>
        <p>One refrain repeated by Bush supporters is government policies had little to do with eight years of economic well-being -- or even the creation of Silicon Valley. ''I've worked in the valley since 1963,'' Mr. Kvamme said, ''and I don't think government ever had a role in it.''</p>
        <p>James L. Barksdale, former president and chief executive of Netscape Communications and now head of Barksdale Group agreed. ''One of the main drivers of the new economy has been the enormous explosion of tech companies,'' he said. ''I don't know that the administration had any role in the good run in the economy.''</p>
        <p>To Democrats and Gore supporters, this is all collective amnesia.</p>
        <p>Much of Silicon Valley's growth resulted from defense spending that paid for the development of computers, the semiconductor, high-performance transistors, the microprocessor, high-performance networks, the mouse and the Internet and which provided research dollars that turned Stanford University into a magnet.</p>
        <p>''It's easy to get caught up with being successful here,'' said Justin Kitch, chief executive of Homestead.com, an Internet content company, and Gore backer. ''It's hard to step back and say, 'Why am I so lucky?' Many don't want to attribute their success to any external factors. That's part of being an entrepreneur.''</p>
