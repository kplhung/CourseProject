        <p>There are billions of dollars in government contracts out there. But before the ambulette company that Ingrid Sevieux works for could get some of that business, she had to learn a foreign language:</p>
        <p>C.B.D. has information about I.F.B.'s and R.F.P.'s, and S.P.P.'s are spelled out in FAR, which also requires DUNS.</p>
        <p>Which is government contractese for:</p>
        <p>The Commerce Business Daily lists invitations for bids and requests for proposals issued by public agencies seeking goods or services, and small purchase procedures are spelled out in federal acquisition regulations, which require a company's identification number under the Data Universal Numbering System.</p>
        <p>Ms. Sevieux learned to translate, as well as get a contract, through the efforts of another acronym, PREP, or Preparing for Profit, a program sponsored by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority with La Guardia Community College and PricewaterhouseCoopers, the accounting firm.</p>
        <p>The program, a four-day course now in its 10th year, was created to train small businesses, and businesses owned by women or minority-group members, to compete for contracts awarded by federal, state and local governments.</p>
        <p>PREP tries to clarify an arcane, argot-filled arena of dense rules, tight specifications and profuse paperwork in which a single wrong figure or a slightly unresponsive answer can mean long delays in payment or even denials of contracts. It also provides general guidance on how to start and run a small company.</p>
        <p>According to Kenneth A. Neal, director of the M.T.A.'s civil rights office, more than 900 owners or other representatives from small companies have gone through PREP.</p>
        <p>Ms. Sevieux, the contract manager for the Coling Ambulette Service in Brooklyn, took the course in June. The results were immediate, she said: a slice of a $3.5 million contract from New York City Transit, a subsidiary of the M.T.A., to carry disabled people under its Access-a-Ride program. (Just how much of the contract Coling will have is still to be determined, Ms. Sevieux said.)</p>
        <p>Because Coling's previous attempt to win a similar contract failed, Ms. Sevieux felt that PREP made the difference. ''It taught us how to write proposals,'' she said. ''When we gave them a proposal last time, we gave them unnecessary information, a lot of background history. This time we pinpointed our strength, what we're able to offer.''</p>
        <p>Government is a big customer for business. It buys many goods and services, from paper clips to software instruction, from school lunches to subway parts.</p>
        <p>But many small businesses cannot seem to get a piece of the public procurement pie no matter how hard they try. Others never try because they find the process baffling.</p>
        <p>''The idea of bidding on state, federal and city contracts has a certain mystique to it,'' Annette De Lavallade, a management consultant in Albany and a PREP instructor, said, referring to the seeming impenetrability of the language and procedures.</p>
        <p>PREP is intended to teach small-business people Government Contracts 101. But in some cases, the teachers find that the students need even more basics.</p>
        <p>''We had people who came into the class with no business cards,'' Mr. Neal of the M.T.A. said.</p>
        <p>He has also found that some who enroll are not clear what their business is.</p>
        <p>''We had a young lady who said she was a graphic designer, but that's not what she was doing,'' he recalled. ''The bulk of her business was reproducing documents, not creating graphic art. She had to go back and redefine herself.''</p>
        <p>Ms. De Lavallade, who teaches how to make effective presentations and navigate contract language, said she found that some people did not ''know how to market themselves or how to join an organization and make contacts.''</p>
        <p>The course also includes estimating costs, understanding a balance sheet and selling on the Internet.</p>
        <p>Although it has been seven years since the last formal assessment of PREP's impact, anecdotal evidence indicates that the findings of that survey remain valid, said Benjamin Hunt, coordinator of special programs at La Guardia Community College, a branch of the City University of New York in Long Island City, Queens.</p>
        <p>The survey showed that about one-quarter of the companies sending someone to the classes eventually won a government contract, whereas just 10 percent of those companies had won such a contract before the owner or an employee attended.</p>
        <p>Georgia Ellis, an assistant director in the New York district office of the Federal Small Business Administration, said that PREP was a good  comprehensive program for small businesses seeking government contracts.</p>
        <p>She said similar efforts by other public agencies and nonprofit groups were usually limited to one business sector, like construction, or did not deal with as many aspects of running a small company.</p>
        <p>Interviews with people who have gone through PREP, which costs $110 and involves all-day sessions on four consecutive Saturdays each October, April and June, leave no doubt that the program has helped some of them win government contracts, but did not help others.</p>
        <p>One graduate who said that the program contributed to his success, Percy Brice III, recalled that before he attended PREP in 1991, his computer systems consulting company, Percon Computer Corporation of Hempstead, N.Y., had failed to obtain government contracts.</p>
        <p>But afterward, ''we've won $5 to $10 million worth of contracts with all levels of government,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brice said that he could not attribute it all to the program, but tips he picked up at the sessions, especially in presenting proposals,  ''definitely accelerated'' the success of his 30-person company.</p>
        <p>''You had to learn the government mind-set, the things they look for,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But Errol W. Johnson, a computer systems consultant who took the course in the early 1990's, said that PREP did not help him win a government contract.</p>
        <p>''I'd attribute it to the smallness of my firms,'' Mr. Johnson said, noting that he was a one-person operation until 1993, when he merged with another company to form a three-person business. ''There was a trend at the time for government agencies to hire large companies they felt would be better prepared, better insured and perhaps more capable.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Johnson's company folded in 1997, but he said the course had still been worthwhile. ''It provided all the information on aspects of starting a small business,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Another businessman who failed to win a government contract after PREP had a different view.</p>
        <p>''They gave basic instruction, like common-sense things, but nothing that will give you an inside track,'' said Stanley Fine, who took the course two years ago. His advertising, marketing and design firm in Manhattan has since bid unsuccessfully for six contracts.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fine, who is white, also held that ''the course was really geared toward minorities.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hunt of La Guardia Community College said that non-Hispanic whites were usually about 20 to 25 percent of those attending. But he  said that fewer than 3 of the course's 32 hours were geared toward members of minority groups, with the rest of the time devoted to points any small-business person could find useful.</p>
        <p>Ann Hannwacker, a white woman who took the course in 1993 as a sales manager for the Detex Corporation, which produces security equipment, also disagreed with Mr. Fine's criticism.</p>
        <p>''I knew nothing about the bidding process,'' she said. ''They opened a world of knowledge to me.'' She said she had since bid successfully for more than a dozen government contracts ranging from under $10,000 to $70,000.</p>
        <p>That, said E. Virgil Conway, chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, is the kind of result the course aims for.</p>
        <p>''I think we have an obligation because we're a public agency to help people,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The added competition for M.T.A. business doesn't hurt either. With more bidders, Mr. Conway said, ''you're going to get the widest possible choice when you're letting contracts.''</p>
