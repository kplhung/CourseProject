        <p>As far as campaign speeches go, the one on breast cancer delivered here today by Hillary Rodham Clinton was tame. No name calling. No partisan exaggerations. No whipping up the crowd. Apart from a couple of personal references to the Senate, it was the kind of responsible talk you would expect from any first lady.</p>
        <p>But Mrs. Clinton is not any first lady. Although the luncheon organizers from Highland Hospital who invited her to speak said she had been invited as the wife of the president and not as the Democratic candidate for Senate, her appearance at the event promoting breast cancer education created a stir among some in the audience of 1,200.</p>
        <p>State Senator James S. Alesi, a Republican who was in attendance, complained bitterly to reporters that Mrs. Clinton used an emotional venue, where people talked about surviving breast cancer, to promote her political ambitions. And some of the women who listened to Mrs. Clinton's 20-minute speech, while perhaps not as upset as Mr. Alesi, said her presence was rigorously debated over their chicken Caesar salads.</p>
        <p>''There was a discussion made pro and against at our table,'' said Debbie Pierce, 47, a medical secretary at Genesee Surgical Associates. ''In my opinion, because the main talk was so emotional -- there probably wasn't a dry eye around -- it perhaps was not the right place for Mrs. Clinton, and the timing was off.''</p>
        <p>The speech at the convention center here came as both Mrs. Clinton and Representative Rick A. Lazio were looking more to upstate voters to win next month's election. Mrs. Clinton's campaign said yesterday that President Clinton would make his first solo fund-raising trip to the region on his wife's behalf on Oct. 22, an indication that Mrs. Clinton needs hard cash (she is trailing Mr. Lazio, according to the most recent filings) but also an acknowledgment that the president's continuing popularity in the state could rub off on his wife in a region more inclined toward Republicans than Democrats.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's aides said that details were still being worked out, but that President Clinton was expected to make appearances in Jefferson and Broome Counties. Mrs. Clinton told reporters she hoped his visit would generate interest in the area among the national press.</p>
        <p>''I think it is terrific because as you know, I am being considerably outraised and outspent in this campaign, and I am delighted that the president could find time in his schedule to attend some very large low-dollar fund-raisers,'' Mrs. Clinton said.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's appearance at Highland Hospital's annual luncheon came after Chris Spielman, a former Buffalo Bills player, and his wife, Stefanie, spoke emotionally about how their family had dealt with Mrs. Spielman's breast cancer over the last three years. The couple were the keynote speakers for the event, but Mrs. Clinton was added late last week after Representative Louise Slaughter made the suggestion, according to campaign and hospital officials.</p>
        <p>David Irwin, a spokesman for the hospital, said the organizers believed Mrs. Clinton would help bring attention to the issue of breast cancer education. She was introduced as the first lady, not as a Senate candidate, and the issue was not politics, he said.</p>
        <p>''We were honored to have the first lady attend the event,'' Mr. Irwin said.</p>
        <p>But officially, Mrs. Clinton was not attending the event as first lady. Her campaign staff, not her White House staff, accompanied her, and her press aides distributed campaign materials to reporters after her speech. Her aides said any suggestion that this was not a campaign stop was the result of a misunderstanding. Mrs. Clinton, nonetheless, made an effort to keep her remarks nonpartisan. The only Republican that she mentioned was Betty Ford, and that was in a flattering reference.</p>
        <p>''She is here playing the role of first lady, which is a convenient act of duplicity,'' said Mr. Alesi. Mr. Alesi's complaints were more about politics than about principle, said Sandra L. Frankel, the town supervisor in Brighton, who received Mrs. Clinton at her home in January. Mrs. Frankel, who ran for lieutenant governor in 1998, said most people at the luncheon ''were thrilled'' that Mrs. Clinton was helping draw attention to the problem of breast cancer.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio appeared yesterday at the Coyne Park Senior Center in Yonkers with promises to maintain Social Security and to find a way to enact a prescription drug plan for the elderly poor. He said he would support a transitional program to provide prescription drug benefits until a permanent one was in place, an idea endorsed by Gov. George W. Bush and Congressional Republicans, who have proposed such legislation.</p>
        <p>''We want to make sure, until we get a program phased in, we get those dollars out right away,'' Mr. Lazio told the gathering. ''We can get that money out within the next few weeks if we can get partisan politics put aside and get the right thing done for our seniors.''</p>
        <p>In response to a shouted request from the crowd, Mr. Lazio also said he would fight any attempts to tamper with the level of Social Security funds. ''There will be no cuts in Social Security, no reduction in benefits,'' Mr. Lazio said.</p>
