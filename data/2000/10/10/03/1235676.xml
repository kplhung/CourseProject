        <p>With its rediscovered national symbols, its gracious statuary and grim wastelands, its crumbling Communist apartment blocks and chic cafes, this city on the Elbe provides a fitting emblem of the ambiguities of Germany on the 10th anniversary of its unification.</p>
        <p>The renowned Frauenkirche (Church of Our Lady) soars skyward, already close to 100 feet high, after lying flattened by Allied bombs for almost 50 years. The restoration of the Baroque wonder, to be completed by 2006, will cost $110 million. For the respected daily Frankfurter Allgemeine, it expresses ''a longing to put right the barbarity of the past.''</p>
        <p>While Dresden is a universal symbol of the horror of civilian bombardment, the frankness of this reference to Allied ''barbarity'' is indicative of a Germany more ready to speak its mind. It's a country that talks of ''national interests'' and ''patriotism'' -- and is ready to rebuild a church expressive of wounded German pride.</p>
        <p>But a large banner hangs from the church scaffolding, saying, ''Build bridges, live reconciliation.'' This new, more assertive Germany that sends troops to Bosnia and Kosovo and ringingly demands a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council also remains mindful of its past.</p>
        <p>In this city where German wounds and contradictions are still writ large, politicians including Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright will gather Tuesday to celebrate 10 years of German unity. Dresden was chosen because it was one of the centers of unrest that led to the collapse of the East German state. But the mere fact that the chancellor who unified the country, Helmut Kohl, will not be here is testimony enough to the bittersweet nature of this celebration.</p>
        <p>''From now on, the day of German unity should be renamed the day of mixed feelings,'' commented Sonja Margolina in the Berlin daily Der Tagesspiegel. Without doubt -- and perhaps inevitably -- the euphoria that accompanied the disappearance of the the Communist East German state a decade ago has evaporated.</p>
        <p>Indeed, a documentary film dwelling on the fireworks and tearful joy of a decade ago that is being shown at a government pavilion erected for the celebrations seems the work of a long lost era. Eerily bloodless, this German upheaval was also touchingly naive.</p>
        <p>In place of the joy, there is much rancor -- most recently an unseemly political feud over who should take credit for unifying Germany. Mr. Kohl, a Christian Democrat, has lashed out at Chancellor Gerhard Schroder, a Social Democrat, quoting him as deriding the idea of unification in 1989 and calling on him to ''admit his mistakes.''</p>
        <p>Clearly enraged, Mr. Schroder belittled Mr. Kohl's decisive role, saying the East German people, not politicians, deserve praise for bringing down the Berlin Wall.</p>
        <p>The scuffle would be titillating, but banal, if it did not reflect a deeper unease. Mr. Kohl will be missed in Dresden, but the ''blooming landscapes'' he confidently predicted in 1990 are missed by many of his citizens.</p>
        <p>Despite the net transfer of about $540 billion to the east, unemployment, at 17 percent, remains at double the level in the west. Wages for easterners are often at least 10 percent lower than those of western Germans in comparable jobs; pensions also lag. These differences feed resentments that occasionally find expression in far-right violence.</p>
        <p>At a deeper level, the wholesale western takeover of the east, at a time of the triumph of global capitalism, has left some in the east with the sense that they are second-class citizens.</p>
        <p>''Materially, we east Germans have advanced much further than our neighbors in Central Europe, but spiritually we are miserable,'' Ms. Margolina wrote in Tagesspiegel.</p>
        <p>If the roads and phones are better in eastern Germany than in Poland, the boisterous give-and-take of Polish democracy is expressive of a vitality and confidence that often seem lacking in the German east. The reason seems evident: Poles made their own post-Communist society; east Germans had theirs imposed on them.</p>
        <p>But the western imposition has also brought enormous fruits. Productivity is rising fast in the east, manufacturing industry is booming, pollution is receding rapidly, and several cities, including Dresden, have thriving high-tech centers of e-business on their outskirts.</p>
        <p>In a survey in the weekly magazine Der Spiegel this week, 70 percent of easterners polled took a positive view of the last decade. Fifty percent of the ''Ossis,'' as people from the east are still known, said that within ten years there will be no further economic difference between east and west.</p>
        <p>In general, the fears -- particularly British and French -- that accompanied unification have been allayed. A united Germany remains a faithful NATO ally, deeply committed to the European Union, surrounded, for the first time in its modern history, by allies. The German question -- the fact that, in the old dictum, Germany was ''too big for Europe, too small for the world'' -- has come a very long way toward resolution.</p>
        <p>But deep internal scars remain whose healing is uncertain. Ingmar Meinecke, a doctoral student in mathematics at the University of Dresden, was 16 when East Germany began to crumble. He joined the protest rallies and was gripped by the extraordinary feeling that ''we are important and can change something.''</p>
        <p>That conviction proved ephemeral. The idealism of revolution was overtaken by the pragmatism of the rush to join the West German state and acquire its money, the mark. By 1991, as he finished high school in the eastern city of Erfurt, Mr. Meinecke was gripped by what he called a ''deep depression'' and a sense of powerlessness. He said that when the first neo-Nazi racist attacks occurred in the east, he felt outraged.</p>
        <p>Mr. Meinecke, now 27, a gifted mathematician, became active in youth movements against racism. He did his military service in the western city of Kassel and then started university studies in Dresden.</p>
        <p>Many people of his generation from the east, he said, had a sense that they could live in this new society, but also needed to ''stand a little beside it and do something against its worst consequences.''</p>
        <p>Those consequences were evident in the fate of his mother, Ingeborg, a teacher who had clashed with the former Communist authorities, losing her job. She expected that the new Germany would bring her better things. But at 55, when unification occurred, Mrs. Meinecke was deemed too old for the new system -- and has remained jobless.</p>
        <p>The last decade, over all, has left Mr. Meinecke with the conviction that ''some new idea of socialism'' drawing on the lessons of the past is needed. In his country, he sees troubling signs of a new nationalism and fears that the restored Frauenkirche in Dresden could ''become a national symbol, a sort of hall of glory, of the new Germany.''</p>
        <p>It is certain that nationalist currents exist. German identity, a decade after unification, remains a not altogether secure thing. But this country treads carefully, with half an eye always fixed on its image in the world. Just a few steps from the Frauenkirche, the foundation stone was laid in June for an imposing new synagogue to replace the one destroyed in 1938. It will serve Dresden's 300 Jews.</p>
