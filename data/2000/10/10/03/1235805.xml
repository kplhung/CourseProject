        <p>The Devils defeated the Islanders, 2-1, before a crowd of 8,198 last night at Continental Arena in the last preseason game for both teams.</p>
        <p>The Devils, who finished with a record of 4-2-2, appeared to be better prepared for their regular-season opener Friday night against visiting Montreal.</p>
        <p>The Islanders went without a victory (0-5-1) in the preseason. They will open at Tampa Bay on Friday having scored seven goals in their six preseason games; every other team in the division scored at least 23. The Islanders' only goal last night came from Taylor Pyatt on the power play.</p>
        <p>Petr Sykora played his first game for the Devils after undergoing surgery to have his tonsils removed, and he looked very effective as the right wing on a line with Bobby Holik and left wing Steve Kelly.</p>
        <p>Turner Stevenson, one of the six newcomers who will be on the roster when the Devils raise the Stanley Cup banner, scored the only goal in the opening period. Alexander Mogilny scored his fifth of the preseason, a power-play goal, in the second period. Both goals came against John Vanbiesbrouck, who yielded to Wade Flaherty midway through the game after facing 13 shots.</p>
        <p>Martin Brodeur made 24 saves and was extremely sharp for the Devils, especially against a breakaway by Dave Satchard with 5 minutes 32 seconds left in the second period.</p>
