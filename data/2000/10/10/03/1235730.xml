        <p>First thing first. If the Yankees had any class, they would withdraw from the playoffs and not foist an embarrassing team on Major League Baseball's brightest time of the year. Where is George Steinbrenner when an apology is really needed, not just to the people of New York (see 1981 World Series) but to all of baseball?</p>
        <p>None of the previous 37 teams in the Yankees' glorious history that won pennants or division championships (except for the 1981 strike season) finished with as few victories as this team's 87. Certainly none lost its last 7 games or 15 of its last 18. If a fisherman catches 37 fish, each weighing 15 to 25 pounds, then catches a two-pounder, he throws the two-pounder back.</p>

        <p>First thing first. If the Yankees had any class, they would withdraw from the playoffs and not foist an embarrassing team on Major League Baseball's brightest time of the year. Where is George Steinbrenner when an apology is really needed, not just to the people of New York (see 1981 World Series) but to all of baseball?</p>
        <p>None of the previous 37 teams in the Yankees' glorious history that won pennants or division championships (except for the 1981 strike season) finished with as few victories as this team's 87. Certainly none lost its last 7 games or 15 of its last 18. If a fisherman catches 37 fish, each weighing 15 to 25 pounds, then catches a two-pounder, he throws the two-pounder back.</p>
        <p>But operating under the hope and the prayer, not to mention the baseball cliche, that anything can happen in a short series, the Yankees are at Oakland poised to fake it as well as they can. They were joined there yesterday by the Mets in a two-pronged New York assault of the Bay Area.</p>
        <p>New York vs. Oakland, New York vs. San Francisco. Baseball has never had such a geographical and philosophical encounter.</p>
        <p>If not for the Yankees' humiliating collapse, the metropolitan areas would have traded home spotlights: the Athletics playing the first two games at Yankee Stadium, then taking the Yankees to their home, while the Giants returned to New York for two games against the Mets at Shea Stadium after two at the spanking new Pacific Bell Park.</p>
        <p>But both series are in the Bay Area for the first two games, then switch to New York for Nos. 3 and 4, including a potential doubleheader Saturday with the Yankees playing in the afternoon, the Mets at night.</p>
        <p>Subway Series? Before the first pitch of the first playoff game is thrown, a BART Battle seems more likely.</p>
        <p>Eleven years ago, the Giants and the Athletics played a World Series by BART, as the Bay Area Rapid Transit is known, and no one has played a more memorable World Series. When the Yankees used to play the Giants or the Dodgers -- that was the New York Giants and the Brooklyn Dodgers -- the rivalries and game developments produced the excitement. The thrills in the 1989 BART Battle came courtesy of an earthquake, 7.1 on the Richter scale.</p>
        <p>But the Giants and the Athletics reached that World Series by defeating the Chicago Cubs and the Toronto Blue Jays, respectively. Those pairings didn't have the glamour and the pizazz created by two New York teams simultaneously invading the Bay Area. At the same time, the New York teams hope their visits don't suffer the interruption the 1989 World Series did, a 12-day hiatus between Game 2 in Oakland and Game 3 in San Francisco, while the area struggled to rebound from the devastation.</p>
        <p>Play two games and get to New York, where highways don't collapse but teams do.</p>
        <p>The difference is that the way the Yankees spend money, they can make repairs far faster than a highway crew. They did that just before and just after midseason and very likely would not even have returned to the playoffs had they not fixed the team. But the September Swoon (no, the Mets did not copyright that phrase) came too late for external repairs. Whatever aid the Yankees generate will have to come from within.</p>
        <p>That they have the richest roster in baseball history from which to seek help can serve as some consolation. The Mets, too, have one of the wealthiest rosters this season. The other half of the dual duel, on the other hand, are among the bottom half of the salary standing, though with differences in payroll level nearly as great as the differences in their home parks.</p>
        <p>The Giants ($54 million payroll) and the Athletics ($32 million) combined pay their players less than the Yankees pay theirs ($102 million or $112 million, take your pick). But these Bay Area contestants should not be confused with each other just because of their geographic proximity. They aren't even distant cousins.</p>
        <p>The Giants played this season in a new $319 million park they financed and built. They attracted 3.3 million fans, an increase of 1.2 million over last year. The Athletics play in an unappetizing Coliseum that is as old as they are. They drew 1.7 million fans, their most in seven years, but still in the bottom third of major league attendance.</p>
        <p>Just as the Mets have struggled and, more recently, spent to gain an equal share of New York, the Athletics have had to scrap in search of equal status in the Bay Area despite their greater success on the field. Their owners would like to move the team 40 miles south to San Jose, the heart of Silicon Valley, but the Giants claim that territory and say they will block the Athletics from usurping it.</p>
        <p>With that potentially damaging difference between them, the Bay Area teams could hardly be expected to mount a united front against the invaders from New York. Damn civic pride, full speed ahead. Win our series and let them lose theirs.</p>
        <p>Now, nothing like that attitude could separate the Mets and the Yankees, could it?</p>
