        <p>IF Barry Bonds is voted the Most Valuable Player in the National League this year, he will be the first major leaguer to win it four times. And with career totals of 494 homers and 471 stolen bases, Bonds, the San Francisco Giants' left fielder, is the only player in baseball history with more than 400 in each category.</p>
        <p>But if Reggie Jackson was Mr. October for his postseason performances, Barry Bonds is Mr. 0 for October.</p>
        <p>When the Giants open their division series against the Mets in San Francisco tomorrow, Bonds will be desperate to do what he has never done in his various postseason appearances: hit for average, hit for power and help his team win. More than anyone else, he knows he has to disprove the rap that he can't hit in the big one.</p>
        <p>He's tried to laugh it off. ''Call me Mr. July,'' he once said. Or feel free to call him Mr. August or Mr. September.</p>
        <p>When the season ended Sunday, Bonds had batted .306, crashed a career-high 49 home runs and driven in 106 runs.</p>
        <p>But over 23 postseason games in his career -- 20 with the Pirates nearly a decade ago in three losing National League Championship Series and 3 with the Giants in a 1997 division series sweep by the Florida Marlins -- Bonds has batted only .200 (16 for 80) with only 1 home run, only 4 doubles, only 5 runs batted in and 16 strikeouts.</p>
        <p>In those three N.L. Championship Series, two against the Atlanta Braves (in which he batted .148 in 1991 and .261 in '92) and one against the Cincinnati Reds (.167 in '90), his overall average was .191.</p>
        <p>Even with his overall .200 postseason average, Bonds has not even hit his weight, 210. And his team, whether the Pirates or the Giants, has lost 15 of those 23 postseason games.</p>
        <p>Over a short postseason series, even the best hitters sometimes wallow through a slump as their team loses. Babe Ruth batted .118 (2 for 17) in the five-game 1922 World Series that the Yankees lost to the New York Giants. But over 23 postseason games, the cream is supposed to rise to the top. Bonds's cream has only curdled. To his dismay.</p>
        <p>''I want people to say,'' he has often proclaimed, ''that Barry Bonds is the best baseball player there is.''</p>
        <p>If you just assess his career regular-season stats, you can argue that he is the best baseball player there is.</p>
        <p>He was named The Sporting News player of the decade for the 1990's over Ken Griffey Jr. and Mark McGwire, joining such prestigious names as Stan Musial (40's), Ted Williams (50's), Willie Mays (60's), Pete Rose (70's) and Mike Schmidt (80's). In 10 years of M.V.P. voting in the 90's, he received the most points -- 1,895, nearly 500 more than the next highest vote-getter, Frank Thomas of the Chicago White Sox.</p>
        <p>By rule, the M.V.P. votes must be cast in the brief interlude between the end of the regular season and the start of the playoffs. So Bonds's postseason flops never counted against his M.V.P. credentials.</p>
        <p>Those M.V.P. votes were a tribute to the integrity of baseball writers who cast those votes; few, if any, find Bonds to be endearing or charming. For that matter, few of his teammates have enjoyed his arrogant, haughty personality.</p>
        <p>''I'd rather lose without him,'' one of his Pirate teammates said, requesting anonymity, ''than win with him.''</p>
        <p>Bonds hasn't changed. Many of his Giant teammates hardly talk to him. Or want to. In the Giants' spacious clubhouse at their new Pacific Bell Park in San Francisco, he prefers to be alone. He spreads out across four lockers. He sprawls in a recliner and watches his own television set or listens to his stereo.</p>
        <p>''Some people accuse me of having a chip on my shoulder,'' he once said, ''but that's part of what makes me tick.''</p>
        <p>But more than anyone else, Bonds knows he has not ticked in the postseason. He's due to break out with a barrage against the Mets; then again, the Mets' pitchers know that, in his desperation to show that he really is the ''best player there is,'' he might be willing to swing at pitches he might ignore during the regular season. If he does swing at those pitches, that should be to the Mets' advantage, not his.</p>
        <p>''If you know me,'' Barry Bonds once said, ''I always find something that I have to prove.''</p>
        <p>In this postseason, he has to prove that he's much more than a .200 hitter.</p>
