        <p>Buck Showalter, gone. Jack McKeon, gone. Gene Lamont, gone. Larry Rothschild . . . staying.</p>
        <p>Those were the official returns yesterday on the first day after the end of the first season since 1942 in which no teams changed managers. The Arizona Diamondbacks fired Showalter, the Cincinnati Reds fired McKeon, and the Pittsburgh Pirates fired Lamont, bringing to four the number of jettisoned managers. The Philadelphia Phillies didn't wait until the day after; on Sunday they made Terry Francona the first manager fired this year.</p>
        <p>Even though Showalter's dismissal was not unexpected, it was stunning because only last year he took the second-year Diamondbacks to the National League West championship, making them the most successful expansion franchise in baseball history. But this season the expensive team won 15 fewer games (85-77) and skidded to third place.</p>
        <p>In the final six weeks, after speculation about Showalter's status surfaced, the Diamondbacks won 15 games and lost 24, plunging from half a game from first to 12 behind.</p>
        <p>''We think that it's time to move in another direction,'' Jerry Colangelo, the team's managing partner, said in Phoenix. ''Kind of time to work on what we need to do to move on.''</p>
        <p>Colangelo picked Showalter himself for the job, calling him minutes after his Yankees contract expired in 1995, recruiting him aggressively and signing him to a seven-year contract, which has two years left.</p>
        <p>The dismissals of McKeon and Lamont were even more expected than Showalter's. Not so certain was the status of Rothschild, manager of the three-year-old Tampa Bay Devil Rays. A newspaper Web site reported that he was being let go, but the report was premature. The Devil Rays dismissed three of his coaches, including Bill Russell, former manager of the Los Angeles Dodgers, but retained Rothschild.</p>
        <p>''I think one of the best decisions I ever made is hiring Larry Rothschild,'' General Manager Chuck LaMar said. ''I felt in my heart he was the right choice, and I feel that way today.''</p>
        <p>Yet in the final weeks of the season, as Rothschild's future was being debated publicly and his dismissal speculated on, LaMar remained silent. Rothschild's uncertain status did not stop the Devil Rays from embarrassing the Yankees with a three-game sweep and knocking the Boston Red Sox out of the American League East race when the Yankees couldn't.</p>
        <p>McKeon, at 69 the oldest manager working in the major leagues this year, would most likely have been fired a year ago had he not taken the Reds to a playoff for the playoffs. The Mets beat the Reds in a one-game playoff for the National League wild card. When the Reds offered McKeon, the manager of the year, only a one-year contract with a slight raise despite the unexpectedly good team he produced, it was evident that his tenure in Cincinnati would not last much longer.</p>
        <p>Unlike the situation last season, this was supposed to be the year the Reds would win the division championship. That role was given them when they acquired Ken Griffey Jr. from Seattle. But Griffey struggled for much of the season, and the Reds were in first place only briefly. They plummeted from the top spot early in June and quickly fell to a distant second. They were no closer to first than nine games in the last month.</p>
        <p>Jim Bowden, the Cincinnati general manager, did not give any reasons for firing McKeon, other than saying the club wanted to go in a different direction.</p>
        <p>As happy as the players seemed to be with McKeon in 1999, they were unhappy with him this year.</p>
        <p>''Any time you have success like we did and you get one year,'' McKeon said in Cincinnati, ''they know you're a lame-duck manager so they can shoot daggers at you and see if they can undermine you and get somebody that they want in there.''</p>
        <p>The Pirates, overrated by some at the start of the season, were never in that N.L. Central race. They never even had a .500 record after they split their first four games in Lamont's fourth season as manager. They finished in fifth, 26 games out.</p>
        <p>''I wish I could have gotten it done,'' Lamont said at his own news conference in Pittsburgh. ''Maybe it's time for someone else to manage this team and maybe it's time for me to move on.'' Referring to Kevin McClatchy, the owner, Lamont said: ''Kevin saved the team here and got a new park here. I don't want to make him out to be a bad guy. We did not win enough games.''</p>
