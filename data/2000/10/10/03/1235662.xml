        <p>John Espey, a writer and teacher whose first books were devoted to his childhood in China, died on Sept. 26 in Los Angeles. He was 87.</p>
        <p>Mr. Espey, the son of a Presbyterian missionary, was born and raised in Shanghai. He began writing about his youthful experiences in ''Minor Heresies'' (1945), a collection of essays in which he described his trials in a tough neighborhood and his first visit to the United States.</p>
        <p>In ''Tales Out of School'' (1947) he wrote about his education at the Kuling American School and his experiences as a member of the Pine Tree Patrol in its version of a Boy Scout troop. More reminiscences followed in ''The Other City'' (1950).</p>
        <p>Mr. Espey, a Rhodes scholar, taught English at Occidental College in Los Angeles before joining the faculty at the University of California at Los Angeles, where he was a professor emeritus.</p>
        <p>In 1991 he revisited the Far East in ''Strong Drink, Strong Language,'' which was nominated for a National Book Critics Circle Award. His other books include the novels ''An Observer'' and ''Winter Return.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Espey also collaborated with his companion, the novelist Carolyn See, and her daughter Lisa See on a series of books. Published under the pseudonym Monica Highland, they include the novels ''Lotus Land'' and ''110 Shanghai Road.''</p>
