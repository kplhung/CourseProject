        <p>Editorial considers possibility of a New York or California 'subway series' as New York Yankees face Oakland Athletics and New York Mets face San Francisco Giants in playoffs</p>

        <p>There is some unusual geographical symmetry attached to the baseball playoffs that begin today. Both New York teams open their quest for a world championship in northern California. The Yankees play the Athletics tonight in Oakland. Tomorrow afternoon the Mets play the Giants in San Francisco. If the Yankees and Mets prevail in these best-of-five matchups, they will keep alive the idea of an all-New York subway series. If Oakland and San Francisco prevail, they will keep alive the idea of an all-BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) series. There are four other playoff teams with World Series ambitions -- St. Louis and Atlanta in the National League, Seattle and Chicago in the American -- but right now people on both coasts are dreaming big.</p>
        <p>The most serious obstacle to an all-New York series could well be the Yankees, who finished the season in dismal fashion. As the Mets were winning their last five games, the Yankees were losing their last seven. The Yankees in fact dropped 15 of their last 18, but the most discouraging statistic is this one. Since a 22-9 start last spring that seemed to launch them toward a fourth world championship in five years, the Yankees have been a .500 ball club, going 65-65. That is usually a good definition of baseball mediocrity. The Yankees have only two reliable starters, Andy Pettitte and Roger Clemens. In those last seven losses, their pitchers gave up 68 runs, while their hitters produced only 15.</p>

        <p>There is some unusual geographical symmetry attached to the baseball playoffs that begin today. Both New York teams open their quest for a world championship in northern California.

        <p>The most serious obstacle to an all-New York series could well be the Yankees, who finished the season in dismal fashion. As the Mets were winning their last five games, the Yankees were losing their last seven. The Yankees in fact dropped 15 of their last 18, but the most discouraging statistic is this one. Since a 22-9 start last spring that seemed to launch them toward a fourth world championship in five years, the Yankees have been a .500 ball club, going 65-65. That is usually a good definition of baseball mediocrity. The Yankees have only two reliable starters, Andy Pettitte and Roger Clemens. In those last seven losses, their pitchers gave up 68 runs, while their hitters produced only 15.</p>
        <p>The Mets' pitching staff, by contrast, is deep and talented, and that gives them a solid chance against a San Francisco team that compiled the best record in the National League. Meanwhile, the Mets have to be rooting for the Cardinals against the Braves. Not only has the Cards' Mark McGwire been reduced by injury to a pinch-hitting role, St. Louis also presents an easier psychological challenge than the Braves. Though the two teams were nearly even this year, Atlanta seems to have the Mets' number when the teams compete for the pennant.</p>
