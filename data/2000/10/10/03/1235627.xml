        <p>People who constantly diet but give in to temptation at the first sight of some rich food learn the hard way that this is a singularly ineffective way to control weight.</p>
        <p>Now, researchers believe it may also contribute to obesity in their children.</p>
        <p>Writing in The International Journal of Obesity, Boston University researchers said they had linked serious weight problems in young children with parents who dieted constantly but also binged.</p>
        <p>Indeed, said Maggie Y. Hood, the lead author of the report, it appears children may be better off with parents who pay little attention to their diets than with those who combine constant dieting with giving in to urges. The best approach is to watch one's diet consistently, she said.</p>
        <p>''Children often model what they see parents do,'' Mrs. Hood said.</p>
        <p>The study was based on data from the Framingham Children's Study, an offshoot of the study that has followed the health of several thousand Boston-area residents for about 50 years.</p>
        <p>Over an 11-year period, researchers screened parents about their eating habits and then focused on 92 families with children from 3 to 7 years old. The parents were periodically given new questionnaires to see if their eating habits had changed, while the children were given regular physical examinations to assess their weight.</p>
        <p>In general, said Mrs. Hood, a coordinator with the Children's Study, parents should avoid overregulating their children's diets, other than making sure there is healthful food available, since it may teach them to ignore their own bodies' cues about what they need to eat.</p>
        <p>And when it comes to families where parents and children alike are overweight, she acknowledged, eating patterns alone do not offer the entire explanation.</p>
        <p>''Genetics may have some role in it,'' she said, ''but very often it's environmental, in that a lot of behaviors are taught to the children.''</p>
