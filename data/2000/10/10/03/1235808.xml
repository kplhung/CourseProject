        <p>Viviane Hagner, violinist  Young Concert Artists Series  92nd Street Y</p>
        <p>The musician chosen for the prestigious moment of opening the 40th Young Concert Artists Series last Tuesday evening was the German violinist Viviane Hagner. She came with excellent credentials. Ten years ago, when she was 13, she was a soloist with the Israel Philharmonic in Tel Aviv. Since then she has been taken up by Pinchas Zukerman for further training and has played with the Berlin Philharmonic under Claudio Abbado.</p>
        <p>Some reasons for such youthful laurels were in evidence at her recital. Her sound is robust, with a fine tinge of earthiness. She is an upright, physical player, actively engaged with her music and projecting it with strength. Some of that strength comes from her firm grasp of rhythm at the basic level of beat and measure.</p>
        <p>Some of it comes too, perhaps, from her confidence. Here, in two hours, she covered pretty much the range of the violin repertory from the 18th century to the 20th, ending both halves of her program with virtuoso showpieces: the Saint-Saens D minor Sonata and Wieniawski's ''Polonaise de Concert'' in D.</p>
        <p>But the evening would have been hugely more impressive if everything had been decisively in place. As it was, Ms. Hagner's fastest and most daring playing was thrilling only up to a point, the occasional skids of stray tone spoiling the effect. Also damaging was an incomplete control of tuning, intermittent but needing attention.</p>
        <p>Ms. Hagner was at her best in Mozart's Sonata in B flat, especially in the rich color of her playing and in how she would have a phrase pick up rhythmic energy at each point in a run of short notes. Her pianist, Avner Arad, was rather thrust into the background, which was a pity when he was so eloquent and graceful, here and in the Saint-Saens, Wieniawski and Brahms (the ''F.A.E.'' Scherzo).</p>
        <p>Playing alone, Ms. Hagner was disappointing in the Bach B minor Partita, where her vigorous command of rhythm within the measure or the short phrase was not matched over larger expanses, and so the movements lacked line. In six of George Rochberg's ''Caprice'' Variations she played with a sense of character.</p>
