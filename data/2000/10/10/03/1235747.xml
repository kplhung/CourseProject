        <p>The House of Burgundy, a fine wine importer and distributor since 1934, spun off the distribution side of its business yesterday and sold it to Eber Brothers/Paramount Brands, a wholesaler in Port Chester, N.Y.</p>
        <p>Robert F. Fairchild, president of the House of Burgundy in Manhattan, said he would continue to own and manage the import portfolio.</p>
        <p>Both companies are privately held, and both presidents declined to comment on the sale price or on revenue. Impact, a newsletter that covers the alcoholic beverage industry, said Eber Brothers/Paramount Brands was the 14th largest wholesaler in the United States, with estimated 1999 revenue of $300 million.</p>
        <p>Mr. Eber said he would convert the distributorship into an independent fine wine division in the New York City area and in Rochester, Syracuse, Albany and Buffalo.</p>
        <p>The House of Burgundy opened a month after Prohibition was repealed. It gained national attention when its wines were served in the French Pavilion at the 1939 World's Fair in New York, which attracted leading French chefs and led to the founding in 1941 of Le Pavillon, a Manhattan restaurant that largely redefined French cuisine in America.</p>
        <p>Among the House of Burgundy's leading vendors are Domaines Ott, a prestigious Provencal estate, and Maison Prosper Maufoux, a wine shipper that Mr. Fairchild bought in 1994.</p>
