        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The denial of death is alive and well as evidenced by ''Searching for Genes to Slow the Hands of Biological Time'' (Sept. 26) on extending human life. Has anyone even questioned the underlying assumption that this would be a good thing? Ultimately, of course, these endeavors will fail, even if they succeed. Sure, we may live longer (as we do now compared with 100 years ago). But we'll never reach what we're trying to in our technological Tower of Babel. And with that will come even more apathy and disappointment, and more compensatory risk-taking. The final irony will come when we all die from suffocating overpopulation.</p>
