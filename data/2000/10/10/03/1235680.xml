        <p>Gov. George W. Bush of Texas will make a return appearance on the ''Late Show with David Letterman,'' but it will not be for a debate with Vice President Al Gore.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's last appearance on the CBS Letterman program, in March via satellite, was widely considered a disaster.

        <p>Gov. George W. Bush of Texas will make a return appearance on the ''Late Show with David Letterman,'' but it will not be for a debate with Vice President Al Gore.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's last appearance on the CBS Letterman program, in March via satellite, was widely considered a disaster. A split-second delay in the satellite feed threw the governor's timing off and his jokes were ill received by the studio audience, especially one about Mr. Letterman's recent heart surgery.</p>
        <p>More recently, Mr. Letterman invited Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore to a debate on his program. The Gore campaign quickly accepted, but the Bush campaign made no commitment, prompting a taunt from Mr. Letterman: ''If you turn it down, see, it makes you look like you're scared, like you're a little girl. Nobody wants a little girl in the White House.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's campaign said yesterday that Mr. Bush would appear on the program on Oct. 19.</p>
        <p>Mr. Letterman's executive producer, Maria Pope, said the debate invitation stands. ''Call me a cockeyed optimist,'' Ms. Pope said, ''but I'm still hoping when they get those annoying little prime-time debates out of the way, they'll reconsider.''</p>
