        <p>The  three oddly named species  two birds and a fish -- are unfamiliar to most people. But the piping plover, the least tern and the pallid sturgeon have emerged as central players in the drama surrounding passage by Congress of a $23.6 billion spending bill for energy and water projects.</p>
        <p>The fate of the three species, all of which live on the upper reaches of the Missouri River, is, according to the environmentalists and Clinton administration officials, tied to increasing the river's spring flows every three years and reducing water levels by about one-third for 8 to 10 weeks in the summer.</p>
        <p>That idea, however, has led to a major water fight between environmentalists and the recreation industry in up-river states like South Dakota on one side and farmers and the barge industry in downriver states like Missouri on the other.</p>
        <p>Senator Christopher S. Bond, Republican of Missouri, has attached a provision to the spending measure blocking the Army Corps of Engineers from implementing its plan to change the river flows.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bond has argued that the plan increases the risk of catastrophic springtime floods in his state and that keeping the water levels low in the summer will harm barge operators on the Missouri.</p>
        <p>The Senate approved the energy and water projects measure today despite a threat issued last week by the White House chief of staff, John D. Podesta, who wrote Congressional leaders that if Mr. Bond's amendment remained, President Clinton would veto the bill.</p>
        <p>Today's vote, largely along party lines, was 57 to 37, less than the two-thirds necessary to override a veto.</p>
        <p>Yet in the calculus that often surrounds spending bills where state political interests often clash with national ones, the fight over the flow of the Missouri River presented the administration with a difficult choice.</p>
        <p>Should it side with environmentalists, an important constituency, and the Senate minority leader, Tom Daschle of South Dakota, a key ally? Mr. Daschle is trying to protect the $85 billion recreation industry in up-river states, where lakes, streams and reservoirs favored by anglers are often drained to maintain high river flows for barges on the lower stretches of the river.</p>
        <p>But choosing to support the environmentalists and Mr. Daschle, who favor the Corps plan, may exact a political toll.</p>
        <p>The Army proposal is opposed by Missouri Democrats, like the House minority leader, Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the mayors of St. Louis and Kansas City and Gov. Mel Carnahan, whose close race for the Senate could be affected by the veto.</p>
        <p>And, some Republicans warn that if Mr. Clinton carries through with his veto threat, he might alienate enough Missouri voters to cost Vice President Al Gore that state in the presidential election.</p>
        <p>''People in Missouri know about this,'' Mr. Bond said, ''and if the Gore campaign believes it is in their interest to have Clinton veto this, I guarantee you this will have political ramifications.''</p>
        <p>Much of this fight is over one small, stocky, insect-eating bird, the piping plover; another forked-tail member of the gull family, the least tern, and the pallid sturgeon, a fish whose ancestors date back 150 million years, according to fossil records.</p>
        <p>''Certainly they have been on this planet a lot longer than the politicians who are currently debating this issue,'' said Mike Olson, the Missouri River Coordinator at the United States Fish and Wildlife's office in Bismarck, N.D.</p>
        <p>Once abundant in the Missouri and on its banks and sand bars, the three species are all threatened, and the pallid sturgeon is approaching extinction.</p>
        <p>Fish and Wildlife biologists and environmentalists blame management of the Missouri for the species' problems.</p>
        <p>Dredged to create a deep, fast-moving channel and with upstream dams releasing water at constant and high rate -- all to accommodate barge traffic -- the Missouri has become increasingly unfriendly for the species. Biologists say that the sturgeons' spawning behavior is set off by a rise in water flow in the spring.</p>
        <p>''The spring rise helps give them the urge to do the right thing,'' Mr. Olson said.</p>
        <p>The fast-flowing spring river also washes organic material into the Missouri, which helps increase the number of insects that the piping plover feeds on, and helps create sand bars that are nesting areas for the plovers and the terns.</p>
        <p>Reducing water flows creates small pools where the baby sturgeon can grow without fear of larger predatory fish or being buried by sediment.</p>
        <p>Environmentalists and the Fish and Wildlife Service argue that for years the Army Corps of Engineers has operated the Missouri River primarily for the benefit of the barge industry, spending $7 million to $8 million for an industry whose Missouri River operations only generate $6.8 million in economic benefits.</p>
        <p>But a coalition of farmers, grain companies and barge operators say they worry that lowering the water levels and in essence creating two shipping seasons would mean the demise of the barge industry on the Missouri, leaving railroads with a virtual monopoly on transporting bulk cargo. They also argue that the increase in the spring flows will make down-river states more vulnerable to floods like the record 1993 deluge that devastated the region.</p>
        <p>''The reason we manage the waterway system was to provide a low cost transportation system on the river and prevent these flooding events. What Fish and Wildlife wants to do is reverse that trend,'' said  Christopher Brescia, president of the Midwest Area River Coalition 2000, a group of agricultural and industrial producers, shippers and barge operators that oppose the Corps plan.</p>
