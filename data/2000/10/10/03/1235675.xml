        <p>The execution of a Texas death row inmate was postponed today by a state judge who granted the delay because the prisoner's court-appointed lawyer had missed the deadline for filing a clemency petition on his behalf.</p>
        <p>The execution of Stacey Lawton, convicted of murdering a man on Christmas Eve 1992 and scheduled to die on Wednesday, was reset for Nov. 14. In an afternoon hearing in Tyler, Tex., Judge Cynthia Stevens Kent of Circuit Court ordered the new execution date so that Mr. Lawton's lawyer, Jeff Haas, could file a new petition seeking clemency before the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles and, ultimately, Gov. George W. Bush.</p>
        <p>Under guidelines established by the parole board, lawyers for death row inmates must file clemency petitions 21 days before a scheduled execution. But Mr. Haas said he miscalculated the dates and submitted Mr. Lawton's petition a day late.</p>
        <p>''I calculated it one way, they calculated it a different way,'' Mr. Haas said of the parole board. He added: ''Do you count the day of execution, or do you count the day it was filed, or don't you? There are lots of different ways it can be calculated.''</p>
        <p>Judge Kent's ruling defused another potential capital punishment controversy in Texas, which leads the nation in executions, at a time when Mr. Bush is entering the final weeks of the presidential race. The state has come under criticism for its death penalty system, including what critics regard as inadequate representation for many indigent defendants.</p>
        <p>''We are very pleased that the court has recognized the need for the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles and the governor to independently review the criminal conviction and sentence of Stacey Lawton,'' said the Rev. Melodee Smith, a death penalty opponent from Florida serving as Mr. Lawton's spiritual adviser.</p>
        <p>Mr. Haas, who said he had handled capital cases but never a clemency appeal, said he had sought a 30-day reprieve from Mr. Bush after the parole board informed him that it would not consider the late clemency petition. Mr. Haas said he had not received an answer from the governor's office by this afternoon's hearing. Linda Edwards, a spokeswoman for Mr. Bush, said the governor did not decide on requests for reprieves until an inmate had exhausted all legal appeals.</p>
        <p>Ed Marty, the Smith County assistant district attorney prosecuting the case, said he was ''incredulous'' at the possibility that Mr. Haas had actually miscalculated the date and questioned whether he was simply seeking a delay. But Mr. Marty said Judge Kent had concluded that Mr. Haas's error was apparently genuine.</p>
        <p>''I think that she wanted to preserve the system even in the face of that,'' Mr. Marty said. ''She did not want anyone to be executed when his attorney couldn't count.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Marty said Mr. Lawton and two other men went on a robbery spree on Christmas Eve 1992. Mr. Lawton was convicted of shooting to death Dennis Price, who had come out of his Smith County home in East Texas as Mr. Lawton and two others were trying to steal his truck, Mr. Marty said.</p>
