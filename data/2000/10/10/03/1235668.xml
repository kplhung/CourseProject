        <p>''The moment you start being in love with what you're doing, and thinking it's beautiful or rich, then you're in danger,'' Miuccia Prada said before her doleful spring show today. ''You have to always work against what you did before, and even against your taste.''</p>
        <p>So Ms. Prada has fallen out of love with those bourgeois-chic blouses and mothering rich tweeds that had the fashion sisters roaring through her stores here over the weekend like a pack of seniors late for a matinee. It was something to be sitting in her modern new show space here, with its arty white walls and polished concrete floor, and witness a woman who is not a natural designer, yet who has become a seer, struggling so hard within herself. One retailer, perhaps sensing a sudden frost at the cash register in the spring, described Ms. Prada's many chaste dirndl skirts and sweaters in dour mixes of navy and black as befitting ''a Plain Jane who stays home at night to feed the cat.''</p>
        <p>There are a lot of ways to look at what Ms. Prada showed, but only one really matters. It's true that in wanting to have a go at the trendy 1980's -- a decade, she admitted, that gave her little personal pleasure -- she picked perhaps the ugliest part. In the mid-80's, the Japanese avant-garde in Paris was showing a lot of black and navy (or gray) together, often in the faded cottons of service-worker uniforms. And indeed, in some of Ms. Prada's madness -- slightly oversize jackets tucked into knee-length skirts, woolly cummerbunds worn over tailored pieces -- one could detect the methods of Rei Kawakubo and Yohji Yamamoto.</p>
        <p>Ms. Prada is also a person whose moods swing as abruptly as a child's. Give her too many pretty sequins, and she is bawling for dull cloth. After the show, some people read into the clothes a sinister degree of manipulation, as if by proposing something as banal as a polo shirt with a slim jersey skirt, and showing only one style of shoe (a black pump with a conical heel), she was jerking everyone's chain.</p>
        <p>It should come as news to no one in the fashion industry that Miuccia Prada is jerking everyone's chain. But don't look for complex motives. Ms. Prada did an about-face because she has always clicked between rich- and poor-looking clothes, and because she was bored.</p>
        <p>And boredom is what the collection perversely and eloquently conveyed -- the boredom of fashion and shopping, but, mostly, the boredom of a blank generation that has almost nothing to rail against and sees no stigma in being absorbed by the superficial. That is not the hallmark of Ms. Prada's politicized generation, but for her to have taken even a stab at expressing this contemporary reality through clothes is remarkable.</p>
        <p>The rest of the opening days of the Milan spring 2001 collections were mainly devoted to diffusion lines that have the effect of diffusing much interest in them. Stefano Gabbana and Domenico Dolce opened their D&amp;G show on Sunday with the sultry Gisele Bundchen wearing some combination of black leather and houndstooth that just covered her fore and aft, but either way wasn't enough to comment upon. Sex and money were the trusty themes, and that translated literally but lightly into coin and funny-money prints. The designers long ago sided with the she-devil, so there's nothing shocking about tops emblazoned with peep-show queens or ultrasuggestive hot pants with candy-colored stones. But their clothes at times seemed to have been designed on autopilot.</p>
        <p>An hour later, at Alberta Ferretti's Philosophy show, the fashion crowd was gazing up politely at fresh-faced models in puffball skirts and shirtdresses with rickrack belts. The last time I saw anyone wear rickrack was in 1968, when Marianne Faithfull, then a teenager, appeared on the British television show ''Ready Steady Go,'' lip-synching ''As Tears Go By.'' But the collection was sweet, if slightly off track in its hopeful reprise of smocked blouses and harem hems.</p>
        <p>George Clooney, in the front row at Donatella Versace's Versus show on Sunday night, wore a dark suit and a big hully-gully smile that said, ''Jeepers, where have I been all my life?'' The clothes . . . the girls!</p>
        <p>The show was not quite heaven -- after all, there's a limit to what one can say about gauzy jersey tops and slick satin pants -- but Ms. Versace had all the parts arranged in the right place. Chiefly what she did was stick to a plain, sexy silhouette: off-the-shoulder dresses in body-hugging jersey, pretty knit dresses in lacy yarns and louche tops that were based on the no-brainer appeal of a T-shirt. There were abstract floral prints and cool colors like toffee and jade, but the story was in the unforced attitude of the clothes.</p>
        <p>Giorgio Armani's Emporio show today featured male and female models doing pantomimes of coziness that were occasionally embarrassing to watch. Mr. Armani played out the his-and-her thing to a fault, with matching pantsuits in gray linen and muddy plaids, but the women eventually got the upper hand with some nicely done suede tops with crisscrossing on the back and some unabashedly feminine dresses of opal chiffon scissored in wisps.</p>
        <p>The title of Josephus Thimister's collection for Genny was ''Nouvelle Vague, Surrealistically Speaking,'' which is nothing more than a clever way of saying ''classic clothes with a twist.'' There were sashed pantsuits in a Silly Putty shade of pink leather, with unmanageably wide cropped trousers, but there were also well-cut tops and dresses in suede and jersey, and he seems finally to be bringing more of his hard, younger edge to Genny.</p>
        <p>Tonight after the Prada show, Mr. Thimister happened to be in the lobby of the Hotel Principe di Savoia, and he smiled when told the news of Prada's grim threads.</p>
        <p>''That's good,'' he said, ''because that's what everybody's wearing.''</p>
