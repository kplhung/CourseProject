        <p>Dee Dee Bridgewater  Feinstein's at the Regency</p>
        <p>Real jazz singing, as opposed to a glossy pop-jazz hybrid is something rarely heard in a cabaret like Feinstein's at the Regency (Park Avenue and 61st Street), where Dee Dee Bridgewater is appearing with her excellent trio through Saturday. This extroverted Mississippi-born singer, who since the 1980's has spent much of her time in Paris, where she is a big star, carries forward the vital tradition of Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughan and Betty Carter with an astonishing vitality, zest and good humor.</p>

        <p>Dee Dee Bridgewater  Feinstein's at the Regency</p>
        <p>Real jazz singing, as opposed to a glossy pop-jazz hybrid is something rarely heard in a cabaret like Feinstein's at the Regency (Park Avenue and 61st Street), where Dee Dee Bridgewater is appearing with her excellent trio through Saturday. This extroverted Mississippi-born singer, who since the 1980's has spent much of her time in Paris, where she is a big star, carries forward the vital tradition of Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughan and Betty Carter with an astonishing vitality, zest and good humor.</p>
        <p>Ms. Bridgewater's signature is an aggressively playful style of scat improvisation that is the farthest thing from the kind of frilly athletic exhibitionism that often passes for scat. Her extended improvisations are radical reinventions of her material in which she reconceives a song emotionally from the inside out.</p>
        <p>Almost everything she does is energized by a bright, sassy humor reminiscent in spirit of that original Sassy (Sarah Vaughan) who often delighted audiences by upending a serious ballad with a humorous interpolation.</p>
        <p>In the 1970's Ms. Bridgewater made a detour into rhythm-and-blues singing. And her performances also incorporate the declamatory pop-soul shouting popularized by Chaka Khan. This exciting dynamic boldness helps make Ms. Bridgewater much more than a custodian of past traditions.</p>
        <p>Ms. Bridgewater's set on Thursday was a well-chosen mixture of jazz and pop standards, including two of Cole Porter's sexiest (''Let's Do It'' and ''Love for Sale''), Horace Silver's ''Cookin' at the Continental,'' Louis Armstrong's ''Basin Street Blues'' and Kenny Burrell's Fitzgerald tribute, ''Dear Ella.''</p>
        <p>Although the set included ballads that showed off the singer's appealingly smoky crooning, power-packed rhythm rather than introspection was the order of the evening, as Ms. Bridgewater and her trio conveyed the pure pleasure of making music together.</p>
