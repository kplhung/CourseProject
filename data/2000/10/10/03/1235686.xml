        <p>The European Union today rebuffed an American request to have Washington's dues to the United Nations lowered, as a crucial review of how much each country should contribute to the organization's budget began.</p>
        <p>The European message, delivered by Ambassador Jean-David Levitte of France, which now holds the union's rotating presidency, echoes voices of opposition from Japan, other Asian countries and a number of developing nations that reject a reduction in dues for the United States, the country with the world's largest and arguably strongest economy.</p>
        <p>The United States, still the United Nations' largest debtor, has been arguing that a restructuring of assessments is overdue, and Ambassador Richard C. Holbrooke, the American envoy who is under an ultimatum from Congress to cut American contributions, has been casting a revision of the payment scale as a broader reform measure here.</p>
        <p>''The roots of this issue run deep,'' he said, ''and they don't relate solely to the United States failure to pay all of its dues on time.''</p>
        <p>Many other nations agree that the scale needs reworking, but only to reflect real changes in the world economy. Budget assessments are based on a nation's share of the world gross national product and on currency movements.</p>
        <p>By that standard, some countries in financial trouble should pay less and a number of newly affluent countries should pay more, but the United States -- with about 27 percent to 29 percent of the total world gross national product and an assessment rate of 25 percent -- would not qualify for a reduction. Europe's collective share of the world G.N.P. is also about 29 percent.</p>
        <p>''The European Union nonetheless contributes 36.6 percent of the regular budget,'' Mr. Levitte said today. ''That is a distortion, and means in stark terms that each of the Union's member states pays considerably more than its national wealth.''</p>
        <p>In addition to the bill for 25 percent of the United Nations regular annual $1 billion budget, the United States is charged for 30 percent of the separate, fluctuating peacekeeping budget, which in the coming year is likely to total more than $2.5 billion. Congress has already lowered peacekeeping payments to 25 percent -- a move seen here as a violation of treaty obligations -- and is now demanding that the regular budget share be reduced to 22 percent.</p>
        <p>Americans have couched this as a request for a general lowering of the ceiling on any regular budget contribution. The Europeans rejected that today in their opening position in a debate that is likely to go on into December. The review of assessments for both budgets is conducted every three years.</p>
        <p>''We consider that the ceiling of 25 percent is already a great privilege because the United States represents 29 percent of the world G.N.P.,'' Mr. Levitte said in an interview after his speech. ''Already the U.S. is paying 4 percent less than its share in world GNP.''</p>
        <p>''Our growth in the E.U. has been, unfortunately, less impressive than the growth in the United States, and the euro is going down while the dollar is going up,'' he said. ''The E.U. contribution should go down and the U.S. contribution should go up. What we cannot accept is the ceiling going down from 25 percent to 22. It is too unfair. The principle for everybody is the capacity to pay.''</p>
        <p>Japan is also opposed to a lowering of American dues when the Japanese, with just below 15 percent of world G.N.P. is assessed 20.6 percent of the regular United Nations budget.</p>
