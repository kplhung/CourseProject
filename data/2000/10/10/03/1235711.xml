        <p>THE SENATE</p>
        <p>THE NUMBERS IN MICHIGAN -- Several recent polls in the closely watched Michigan Senate race show the incumbent, Spencer Abraham, ahead of his Democratic challenger, Representative Debbie Stabenow. But Mr. Abraham's lead varies widely.</p>
        <p>In a poll conducted Sept. 26-28 by EPIC/MRA for The Detroit Free-Press, the senator held a 9-point lead, 43 percent to 34 percent. That is smaller than Mr. Abraham's 12-point lead in two polls earlier in September. Still another poll, conducted Sept. 23-24 by Survey USA for Detroit's NBC affiliate, WDIV, showed Mr. Abraham ahead by only 1 percentage point.</p>

        <p>Mr. Abraham maintains that he has a strong lead because voters are becoming more familiar with his record. Ms. Stabenow says her opponent's lead is disappearing now that she has begun running television advertisements.</p>

        <p>POLITICS ON TV</p>
        <p>FOX OFFERS A FORUM -- The Fox television network announced yesterday that it would offer Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush a shared hour of free time in which to tell viewers why they think they should be president.</p>
        <p>It was unclear whether anything would come of Fox's offer to the candidates, who were invited to appear on Oct. 27 for the proposed prime-time program.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for Mr. Gore, Jano Cabrera, said the campaign's focus at this point was completing the debates already scheduled. And, Mr. Cabrera said, ''our understanding, from having held debate negotiations with the Bush campaign, is that we're leaving it at that.''</p>
        <p>The Bush campaign had no immediate response.</p>
        <p>Fox made its offer days after heavy criticism for deciding to show the first episode of a new series, ''Dark Angel,'' instead of tonight's debate. But it said yesterday that it would show all three of the presidential debates and the vice-presidential debate on the 22 stations it owns, but on a ''tape-delay'' basis after the late local news. The network said the debates would be shown live on the Fox News Channel on cable.</p>

        <p>THE POLLS</p>
        <p>GORE STILL LEADS IN NEW JERSEY -- Vice President Al Gore holds a double-digit lead over Gov. George W. Bush in New Jersey even though most voters favor Mr. Bush's plan for a partially privatized Social Security, a poll released yesterday shows. Mr. Gore led 49 percent to 35 percent among 820 likely voters surveyed from Sept. 26 to Oct. 1 by Quinnipiac University. The poll, which has a three percentage point margin of error, gave Ralph Nader, the Green Party presidential candidate, 6 percent and Patrick J. Buchanan of the Reform Party 1 percent.</p>

        <p>THE REFORM PARTY</p>
        <p>BUCHANAN WINS A ROUND -- Patrick J. Buchanan, the Reform Party candidate, won a spot on the ballot yesterday in Florida, a hotly contested state where polls show Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush about even.</p>
        <p>Polls among likely Florida voters have shown only 1 percent to 3 percent supporting Mr. Buchanan. But with Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush tied in the race for Florida's 25 electoral votes, Mr. Buchanan could affect the outcome if he draws more heavily from one of the main parties than the other.</p>
        <p>After a brief hearing in Tallahassee yesterday, Judge Terry Lewis of Circuit Court signed off on an agreement in which Mr. Buchanan, rather than John Hagelin, a nuclear physicist, would be listed on the Florida ballot as the Reform presidential nominee. Mr. Hagelin, who had also claimed to be the party's nominee, will appear on the Natural Law Party line.</p>

        <p>THE STATES</p>
        <p>A SPOKESMAN STEPS DOWN -- The spokesman for the Missouri Republican Party resigned yesterday after being criticized for saying that Democrats had paraded the state auditor, Claire McCaskill, around ''like a cheap hooker.''</p>
        <p>The spokesman, Daryl Duwe, said he had asked that his contract with the party be terminated immediately.</p>
        <p>''I believe this election to be too important to be distracted by me,'' Mr. Duwe said.</p>
        <p>Democrats called for Mr. Duwe's ouster last week after his comments about the state auditor appeared on Mr. Duwe's private Web site. Mr. Duwe sent an apology to Ms. McCaskill and removed the remark from the Web site, but Democrats insisted on his removal.</p>
