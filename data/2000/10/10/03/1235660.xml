        <p>Meet Jaime Troche, fast-food devotee. The native New Yorker eats from one chain or another at least once a day. He has recently been laid off from his job, and worries about money. He is 19 years old, and likes big piles of food. By all accounts, he is the model Taco Bell customer.</p>
        <p>Last week, Mr. Troche heard that Kraft had sold a supermarket version of Taco Bell shells that contained genetically engineered corn not approved for human consumption. He also read that the Taco Bell chain had bought shells from the same factory. But it fazed him not, and, without any second thoughts, he headed in for his usual taco within days of the recall by both companies.  ''I've eaten at Taco Bell for years, and I'm still here,'' Mr. Troche said. ''If no one's getting sick, and no one's dead, I'm O.K. with it.''</p>

        <p>Meet Jaime Troche, fast-food devotee. The native New Yorker eats from one chain or another at least once a day. He has recently been laid off from his job, and worries about money. He is 19 years old, and likes big piles of food. By all accounts, he is the model Taco Bell customer.</p>
        <p>Last week, Mr. Troche heard that Kraft had sold a supermarket version of Taco Bell shells that contained genetically engineered corn not approved for human consumption. He also read that the Taco Bell chain had bought shells from the same factory. But it fazed him not, and, without any second thoughts, he headed in for his usual taco within days of the recall by both companies.  ''I've eaten at Taco Bell for years, and I'm still here,'' Mr. Troche said. ''If no one's getting sick, and no one's dead, I'm O.K. with it.''</p>
        <p>If it seems curious that the stock of Taco Bell's parent company, Tricon Global Restaurants Inc., is actually higher than it was in the days before the shell scare last week, consider this: securities analysts who follow the company are so confident that Taco Bell's core customers are unconcerned about genetically engineered foods that few expect the episode to have any measurable effect on the restaurant's sales. The company says sales figures for recent weeks have not yet been compiled, but it also does not expect the recall to have much impact.</p>
        <p>Of course, unlike Kraft's product, the Taco Bell shells did not test positive for the genetically altered corn known as StarLink, which has only been approved for animals. But that may be beside the point. Analysts say the restaurant's clientele, overwhelmingly male and usually between the ages of 16 and 29, is primarily worried about what the industry refers to as ''the deep discount'' -- and little else.</p>
        <p>''If you're eating at Taco Bell, health consciousness is not high on your list of concerns,'' said John Ivankoe, an analyst for J. P. Morgan. ''I don't think this is going to change the eating habits of its customers.''</p>
        <p>Even Tricon, which also owns KFC (the former Kentucky Fried Chicken) and Pizza Hut, admits that its customers generally come to Taco Bell for the array of ''indulgent craving foods,'' and has learned that tampering with the menu can be costly.</p>
        <p>While the rest of the industry is growing at roughly 3 percent, sales at Taco Bell have been particularly flat this year, and at times have dipped as much as 8 percent. Mitchell J. Speiser, a Lehman Brothers analyst, attributes the chain's sub-par performance to the introduction of higher-end foods, priced ''north of a dollar,'' that have alienated some of its cost-conscious constituency.</p>
        <p>''Genetically modified products do increase yields and lower costs,'' Mr. Speiser said. ''So, if it were to lower prices, I think Taco Bell customers would be all for it.''</p>
        <p>Many believe Taco Bell is somewhat insulated from any serious fallout because it has very little presence abroad, where consumers have heightened concerns about genetically engineered food. KFC is popular in Asia and Pizza Hut is prevalent in Europe, where the debate rages hottest, but fewer than 300 of Taco Bell's 7,000 restaurants are outside the United States.</p>
        <p>Environmental groups in this country worry about consumer apathy, and stress that as many as one in four people have food allergies and could have a reaction to proteins like the one found in StarLink. Yet, they say the F.D.A. has no process for testing ingredients before they come to market, leaving that responsibility to the food companies.</p>
        <p>''The big concern is that this illegal corn is in the food supply,'' said Matt Rand, biotechnology campign manager for the National Environmental Trust. ''We're expecting that we're going to find more of it in other food products.''</p>
