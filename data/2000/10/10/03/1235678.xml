        <p>His face still red, his scowl still in place, Jim Fassel had not lost today any of his anger about the Giants' game on Sunday.</p>
        <p>Fassel, the Giants' coach, usually decompresses within 24 hours of a game, but  he was still steamed a day after the team's 28-14 loss to Tennessee. Still, he offered two suggestions in his weekly address to players: don't look back or lose faith.</p>
        <p>''What concerns me most is we come out of this thing with the loss of a game rather than do anything as far as losing our confidence, losing our determination to win a football game and to get back on track,'' Fassel told reporters today. ''If we lose that, then we've lost. We've lost a lot. Personally, I don't think we have and I don't think we will.''</p>
        <p>Saying he was determined to win, Fassel also added an unsolicited remark about himself, which served as a reminder of his uncertain status. Last January, the Giants gave Fassel a one-year contract extension through next season with the understanding that he needed to win this year. After a 3-0 start, his team has lost two straight.</p>
        <p>''If they need to follow somebody, they can get behind me,'' Fassel said of his players. ''I'm more determined than ever, and I'll stay that way.''</p>
        <p>Fassel has become increasingly edgy over the last week. Last Thursday, he yelled at his players after a lackadaisical practice. Today, he said he realized such tantrums do not guarantee intensity in games, and the Giants surely lacked fervor on Sunday. Fassel demanded the team be ''gunpowder ready'' for its next game, Sunday against the Falcons in Atlanta.</p>
        <p>Fassel appeared startled by comments from quarterback Kerry Collins on Sunday that the team's confidence had wavered entering the games against Washington and Tennessee the last two weeks, both losses.</p>
        <p>Fassel's response was firm. ''Well, then somebody is going to have to pat each other on the back and build themselves some confidence, because I don't see why we should,'' he said. ''We won three games. We got the best start we've had around here for a long time. Why are we lacking confidence?''</p>
        <p>Collins amended his remarks somewhat today, saying that the team does not lack confidence, but no longer feels ''we're going to take it to people.''</p>
        <p>Ten days ago, the Giants were one of five undefeated teams in the National Football League and led the National Football Conference East. Today, they have a 3-2 record and are tied with the Eagles and Redskins in the division.</p>
        <p>''In this league, people are going to get better and separate themselves,'' safety Sam Garnes said. ''Right now, we need to turn it around or things are going to get a lot worse. A lot of teams, Philadelphia and Washington, are getting better. We're not. It has to start today.''</p>
        <p>Fassel has not ruled out making personnel changes, but his choices are restricted by one of the league's thinnest rosters.</p>
        <p>The new, improved offense this season has begun to resemble last year's stagnating attack. The running combination of Tiki Barber and Ron Dayne, which had led the league in rushing, combined for a total of 1 yard against the Titans. The passing game in recent weeks has been incapable of the big play. The Giants have also been unable to sustain drives long enough to score.</p>
        <p>Amani Toomer did catch Collins's longest pass of the season, a 40-yarder that led to the Giants' final score in the fourth quarter on Sunday. But Toomer let the first pass from Collins go through his hands at the Titans' 30-yard line in the first quarter, a humbling play for a receiver who suggested last week that the team throw him more deep passes.</p>
        <p>The Giants played one of their worst defensive games in recent history. They allowed the Titans' offense to control the ball for a remarkable 42 minutes 46 seconds. The Giants had the ball for only 17:14, their lowest time of possession since the N.F.L. began tracking the statistic in 1977. Tennessee converted an amazing 70 percent of its third downs. Both John Fox, the defensive coordinator, and Fassel said the team had not gotten a pass rush from its defensive line, once one of the most feared in the league. Michael Strahan and Keith Hamilton have only 2.5 sacks apiece this season.</p>
        <p>The Giants, possibly fearful of making a shaky secondary more vulnerable, have not blitzed much. The few blitzes on Sunday quickly backfired. Cornerback Jason Sehorn rushed Titans' quarterback Steve McNair late in the third quarter, but McNair simply dodged him and ran 10 yards for a first down.</p>
        <p>The losses have coincided with improved competition. Still, many Giants refuse to concede that the Redskins or the Titans are better. Not all their confidence is gone, but the Giants clearly need a turnaround.</p>
        <p>''After 3-0, the only thing you've guaranteed yourself is 3-13,'' Garnes said.</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>Coach JIM FASSEL said he would not mind carrying two kickers on his roster. The team signed JARET HOLMES on Saturday to replace the injured Brad Daluiso. Holmes's strong kickoffs nullified the Titans' standout return unit. Daluiso said his stiff back was at its worst Saturday; he might have aggravated it by kicking in practice on Friday. He hopes to resume kicking on Wednesday.</p>
