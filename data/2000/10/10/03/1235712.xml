        <p>Investors continued to sell technology stocks yesterday, sending the Nasdaq composite index down for the seventh time in the last eight sessions. Broader gauges were narrowly mixed.</p>
        <p>''People spent most of the year leaning hard on the cyclical, old- economy stocks,'' said Jonathan Olesky, head of block trading at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. ''Now there is a risk in the new-economy stocks.''</p>
        <p>By the close, the Nasdaq composite index was down 103.92 points, or 2.8 percent, to 3,568.90. High-profile names like Microsoft, Sun Microsystems, JDS Uniphase and Juniper Networks led the decline.</p>
        <p>Gains in I.B.M., J. P. Morgan and Exxon Mobil helped lift the Dow Jones industrial average, which closed at 10,700.13, by 49.21 points, or 0.5 percent.</p>
        <p>But the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index was essentially unchanged. The index closed at 1,436.23, down 0.28 point.</p>
        <p>Gains in telephone equipment makers like Lucent Technologies and Nortel Networks offset losses in higher-priced technology names.</p>
        <p>Worries about technology stocks have grown stronger over the last two weeks as several high-profile companies have warned that third-quarter earnings would not meet Wall Street estimates.</p>
        <p>Investors have tended to thrash the stocks that have said they would not meet expectations. But yesterday, they chose to treat Caterpillar somewhat differently. Caterpillar said it would fall short of third-quarter estimates but would meet analysts' full-year estimates.</p>
        <p>The shares rose 44 cents yesterday, to $34.25. Despite the gain, Caterpillar shares are down more than 25 percent this year.</p>
        <p>By contrast, Sun Microsystems, a technology favorite that has given no guidance on third-quarter earnings, fell $3.19, to $113.56. Sun shares are up more than 45 percent this year.</p>
        <p>''There is a feeling out there that there needs to be a dramatic re-evaluation of technology stock valuations,'' said William Meehan, chief market analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald. ''And there is concern about how strong the growth for technology is going to be.''</p>
        <p>A report yesterday from the National Association of Purchasing Managers, which showed a decline in manufacturing last month, had little effect on stocks, Mr. Meehan and others said.</p>
        <p>And most analysts said the report, coupled with other small signs that the economy was slowing, would probably persuade Federal Reserve policy makers, who meet today in Washington, to maintain their current stance on interest rates.</p>
        <p>''If the Fed went to a neutral bias, it would be an important positive development for the market,'' Mr. Olesky said, ''because I don't think there is a high expectation for that. The expectation is that they will leave interest rates unchanged and maintain their bias to tighten.''</p>
        <p>Nortel and Lucent, two telecommunications stocks that fell in the third quarter, had a good day.</p>
        <p>Nortel gained $2.25, to $62.38. And Lucent rose $2.44, to $31.</p>
        <p>Elsewhere, Summit Bancorp gained $3.63, to $38.13, after news that FleetBoston Financial, the nation's eighth-largest bank, had agreed to buy Summit for $39.78 a share.</p>
