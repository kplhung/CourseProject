        <p>''L'Etourdi'' or ''The Bungler,'' an early Moliere comedy, his first in verse, is a hoot, a nutty 17th-century sitcom about a manservant, proud of his gift for dissembling and manipulation, trying to help his dimwitted master win the girl of his dreams away from the rich old man to whom she is indentured, as well as a variety of other suitors.</p>
        <p>Derived from the improvisatory commedia dell'arte form practiced by the Italian acting troupes of the day, the play is profoundly unprofound, without the artful plot turns or thematic complexities of later plays like ''The Misanthrope'' or ''Tartuffe.'' But as a tour de force of cleverness and wit, it was nonetheless Moliere's first recognizably great work. Initially performed in Lyon in 1655, it was the play that three years later established the renown of the playwright and his company, the Illustrious Theater, in Paris. Curiously, ''The Bungler'' has a scant history in English translation, and until now it has never been performed in verse in English in the United States.</p>
        <p>Using a mischievous new translation by the poet Richard Wilbur, the premiere production at the Long Wharf Theater here, directed by the company's artistic director, Doug Hughes, is great good fun and should open the gate for the play to be presented with the regularity it deserves.</p>
        <p>''The Bungler,'' which is self-consciously theatrical, posits the manservant, Mascarille, almost as a director, his fabrications and stories meant to manipulate the characters to serve his ends. Of course they don't always go along -- in fact, they rarely do -- which calls forth greater and greater reserves of his imagination. His skills include pickpocketing and elaborate off-the-cuff tale-telling; his ruses involve a fake corpse and disguising himself as a Swiss boarding house owner. Mascarille, played with ebullient cheek by Jeff Weiss, thinks of himself as an artist rapscallion and his current project as the pinnacle of his career.</p>
        <p>The main obstacle to his success is the very fellow he's seeking to help, the title character, his master, Lelie, who wouldn't recognize a deception if it bit him, and whose innocent revelations and unconscious ineptitude foil one after another of Mascarille's schemes, often reclaiming ignominious defeat from glorious triumph at the very last moment. In one scene staged with sardonic hilarity by Mr. Hughes, Mascarille is reduced to using a pointer, a map of the Mediterranean and the manner of an exasperated pedant to instruct Lelie in the details of his latest contrivance. Lelie blows it.  And in the end Mascarille is a failure. It takes the most preposterous of coincidences, in the face of which he is rendered helplessly, almost religiously awestruck by the forces of fate, to achieve the play's inevitably happy ending. Mr. Wilbur, a translator of several verse plays by Moliere, has supplied a winking modern idiom for the play that gives the couplets the giddiness of a satisfying limerick.</p>
        <p>Mascarille declares at one point:</p>
        <p>T'will be a brilliant coup, believe you me.</p>
        <p>The Lord endowed me with rascality</p>
        <p>And I am not the thankless sort of knave</p>
        <p>Who hides beneath a bushel what Heaven gave.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hughes has wisely staged the play to allow the language to resonate and his actors the room to roam and pontificate with glee. His ideas -- from the strolling four-man band (a violin, a saxophone, an accordion and a percussionist) that punctuates the action with clever klezmer-esque original music by Louis Rosen, to the actors' Keaton-ish bits of comic business -- are generally delicious and self-contained. A couple of leitmotifs grow thin toward the end, but over all Mr. Hughes has added an order of magnitude of amusement to the play and steered clear of the pitfall of cloying, cartoonish slapstick. And he's also overseen an uncommonly handsome production.</p>
        <p>The stage is a bleached wooden platform with a matching faux proscenium and a backdrop with two doors, occasionally obscured with beautifully painted curtains depicting a cloud-covered sky or the Sicilian village where the play is set. It's lovely work by Neil Patel. The lighting, by Pat Collins, bathes it all in a deep blond glow and the rich costumes by Linda Fisher -- in browns, deep reds and the occasional, offsetting aqua -- complete a color scheme of notably satisfying sonorousness.</p>
        <p>The cast, too, is fine; all are remarkably comfortable and seemingly delighted with the singsong of the play's verse. Of particular note in the supporting cast are Frank Raiter, who, as the old Trufaldin, the rich man holding Lelie's love (her name is Celie) in his service, does a remarkably shrewd and cranky turn behind a very long and very funny false beard; Christopher Wynkoop, as Lelie's father, Pandolfe, who plays his stern and humorless character with the generous understatement of a foil, and Tari Signor, who, in spite of a raft of overflowing curls and a startlingly pink gown that highlights a heaving bosom, brings a tasteful poise to the part of Hippolyte, the young woman who has been promised by Pandolfe to Lelie but is just as happy to see him look elsewhere.</p>
        <p>As Lelie, Jeremy Shamos has just the right eagerness for a young man who has a servant but no discernible responsibility. Mr. Shamos presents Lelie's lovesick randiness with an interesting galaxy of leg twitches and shoulder slouches; he has a vocal quality that, with its braying, both presumes authority and betrays a lack of it. His Lelie is sweetly pathetic; it's no wonder he wears Mascarille out. The wonder is that Celie (Heidi Dippold) wants anything to do with him.</p>
        <p>But that, as the play would have you believe, is love's irrefutable whimsy, and it is in the service of that principle that Mascarille labors. Even he, at the end, is pleading for a woman, any woman. And the performance here by Jeff Weiss makes you wish him nothing but happiness.</p>
        <p>It's a grand turn for the veteran actor, who, especially with a skullcap hiding a bald pate, has the beaky and shrewd mien of a lifelong rascal, one for whom scheming is a self-defining creative act but who has, in the end, no real stomach to cause harm. Moliere has Mascarille walk a perilous line between mere mischief and dangerous self-aggrandizement. And indeed it's almost a shame that this marvelous character -- the longest part Moliere ever wrote -- has to yield up his relentless plot-devising to the human ache in his lonely heart.</p>
        <p>But throughout Mr. Weiss is drawn to Mascarille's sprightly side; in his performance it's always invention and creativity that motivate the character, never self-enrichment. Slim and agile, verbally deft, subtly expansive in gesture and facial expression -- he's particularly amusing at the moment things go wrong -- he's cheery as mischief-maker, puckishly frustrated when he has to clean up a mess. He's never a threat, only the embodiment of a man too smart for his own good. It's an ingratiating, welcoming performance, which should be welcomed, like ''The Bungler,'' in return.</p>
