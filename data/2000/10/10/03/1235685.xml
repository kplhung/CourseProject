        <p>While the music file-sharing service Napster fights a battle over the legality of its software in a courtroom in San Francisco, MusicMatch, a San Diego company that makes software for storing and playing music on home computers, is waging a different kind of battle over market share. The company is releasing a new version of its jukebox software today that gives users the ability to customize their selections. MusicMatch, which claims 10 million users, is fighting to gain market share from RealNetworks, whose RealJukebox software has 45 million users, as well as from Microsoft, whose Windows Media Player comes installed on many new PC's.</p>
