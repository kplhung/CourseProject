        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani partly blamed low salaries yesterday for the shortage of recruits in a Police Academy class that is more than 350 people shy of the number the department had planned.</p>
        <p>''I'm sure that's one part of it,''  Mr. Giuliani said of the salaries after he presided over a police hiring ceremony for 1,223 recruits at Queens College. Police officers in the city with five years' experience earn $54,000 annually, while officers in Nassau and Suffolk with similar experience earn $76,000 and $78,000 a year. The city is negotiating with the police union over wage increases.</p>
        <p>Although there is little danger in the short term that the city will have too few officers -- the 40,000-member force is the largest in history -- police officials say long-term prospects are gloomier.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani spent some time yesterday blaming the news media for an ''unrelenting attack'' on the department over a series of police shootings of unarmed black men, and implied that subsequent public uproars had scared off recruits. But he did say that he was pleased that more than half the new class, 52 percent, was made up of nonwhites.</p>
        <p>''I think it's the largest percentage of minorities the Police Department has been able to recruit,'' he said, adding that 28 percent of the class was Hispanic, 19 percent African-American and 5 percent Asian. ''On a percentage basis, it probably reflects the diversity of the city more completely than just about any other police class in the past,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Police Commissioner Bernard B. Kerik emphasized the need to build up trust for the police in the community: his theme since taking over the commissioner's job in August. ''When you get out there, it's O.K. to say 'Yes, sir, no, sir, yes, ma'am and no, ma'am,' '' Mr. Kerik said. ''I've done it my entire life. I do it today. I've done it when I arrested someone. You know what? People take a step back. And they have a tendency to respect you more.''</p>
        <p>He added that ''someone in here, one of your colleagues, is going to be involved in a circumstance where there may be a gray area. There may be a question about what happened.''</p>
        <p>In those cases, he said, ''It's then going to be up to me and up to the mayor to reach out to the communities to ask for their support, their understanding, to ask that they look at objectively what really happened. If the public and the communities don't trust you, that's going to be extremely difficult for us to do.''</p>
