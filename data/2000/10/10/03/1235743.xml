        <p>Editorial says Congress, which plans to adjourn in two weeks, should take action on variety of important legislation that should not be allowed to spill over into a new administration and a new Congress next year; notes several pending bills</p>

        <p>Congress is planning to adjourn in two weeks so that members can do some last-minute campaigning before Election Day in November. Before it leaves, it ought to pass some important legislation that should not be allowed to spill over into a new administration and a new Congress next year, thus robbing the bills of legislative momentum. At the same time, Congress should refrain from its traditional end-of-session mischief. Here is an abbreviated list of good legislation that should be enacted, followed by some bad legislation that should be made to vanish.</p>
        <p>Land Conservation. The White House and Congressional negotiators reached agreement last Friday on a plan to set aside some $12 billion over six years for a range of federal and state land conservation programs. It is the most important land conservation bill in many years, and deserves prompt approval on the House and Senate floors. Budget purists are annoyed that the money will be fenced off in a special conservation account similar to the Highway Trust Fund. But open space has been shortchanged for years, and this is a way to make restitution.</p>

        <p>Congress is planning to adjourn in two weeks so that members can do some last-minute campaigning before Election Day in November. Before it leaves, it ought to pass some important legislation that should not be allowed to spill over into a new administration and a new Congress next year, thus robbing the bills of legislative momentum. At the same time, Congress should refrain from its traditional end-of-session mischief. Here is an abbreviated list of good legislation that should be enacted, followed by some bad legislation that should be made to vanish.</p>
        <p>Land Conservation. The White House and Congressional negotiators reached agreement last Friday on a plan to set aside some $12 billion over six years for a range of federal and state land conservation programs. It is the most important land conservation bill in many years, and deserves prompt approval on the House and Senate floors. Budget purists are annoyed that the money will be fenced off in a special conservation account similar to the Highway Trust Fund. But open space has been shortchanged for years, and this is a way to make restitution.</p>
        <p>The Everglades. A bill authorizing a 20-year, $7.8 billion program to rescue the South Florida ecosystem was approved last week by the Senate with only one dissenting vote. The only remaining obstacle is the House, where a similar measure is attached to a water resources bill that is bogged down in unrelated partisan disputes. If necessary, the House should pass a free-standing bill that could then be melded with the Senate's. The Everglades restoration measure is the result of seven years of work by the administration, conservationists and other stakeholders, and it would be unthinkable to lose it this late in the game.</p>
        <p>Domestic Violence. By a 415-to-3 vote last week, the House reauthorized the Violence Against Women Act, a 1994 law that helps states and localities combat domestic violence. A companion measure in the Senate, sponsored by Joseph Biden, a Democrat, and Orrin Hatch, a Republican, has more than 70 co-sponsors. But Trent Lott, the majority leader, has not scheduled a vote. Failure to move forward would jeopardize financial assistance that has helped pay for the prosecution of domestic violence cases and provided safe havens and other services for victims of abuse.</p>
        <p>Education. A bill that would enable the federal government to pay the interest on $25 billion in school construction bonds -- a cost usually borne by states and localities -- is bottled up in both the House and Senate. The bill would help the country's school districts, including New York City, rebuild crumbling schools. President Clinton will need help from a reluctant Republican leadership.</p>
        <p>Welfare. The Senate needs to approve a measure overwhelmingly passed by the House allowing welfare mothers to keep more child support payments from noncustodial fathers. Under current law, some of these payments are used to repay state and federal governments for welfare payments made to the same mothers. The bill would put an extra $1 billion in their hands.</p>
        <p>Here are several provisions the president should veto if Congress does not withdraw them.</p>
        <p>Family Planning. The House is again seeking, in its foreign aid bill, to impose a pernicious ''gag rule'' on international groups receiving American aid for family planning programs. Any group that provides for abortions abroad or lobbies foreign governments on abortions -- even if it uses its own money for those purposes -- could not get American money for its other programs. President Clinton should veto any foreign aid package that contains this provision.</p>
        <p>Honorariums. A mischievous provision quietly slipped into the Justice Department spending bill by Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, would repeal the 11-year-old ban that prevents federal judges from collecting fees for public appearances. If this provision, which raises the threat that judges might receive money from sources whose interests would be affected by judicial rulings, is not removed on the floor or in conference, a presidential veto is in order.</p>
        <p>Endangered Species. For once the Army Corps of Engineers, often at odds with environmental needs, wants to do something right. But Congress won't let it. The corps is willing to change the operation of its dams to increase summertime river flows in the Missouri River in order to save three endangered species -- two bird species and one fish species -- that depend on the river. An amendment to the House energy bill by Senator Christopher Bond, a Missouri Republican, would prevent the corps from doing this because, Mr. Bond says, higher flows would endanger barge traffic. Barge traffic is negligible during the summer. The bill containing the amendment passed the Senate yesterday. When it reaches Mr. Clinton's desk, he should veto it.</p>
