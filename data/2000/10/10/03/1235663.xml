        <p>Standing on toasted earth where the wheat crop failed this summer and no seeds are left for planting this fall, Hokim Ulimov pointed to the scattered piles of stones that are all that remains of his family home and said, ''I don't remember a time in my life when it was this bad.''</p>
        <p>In the Soviet era, Mr. Ulimov and thousands of other poor Tajiks were transplanted from mountainous zones of the country to pick cotton in the verdant valleys here near the border with Afghanistan. Their output fed the empire's spinning mills.</p>
        <p>In nearby Tursunzade, Soviet Socialist labor built the largest aluminum smelter in Central Asia. And in the north near Khudjand, uranium mines supplied a secret complex whose cascades of machinery produced nuclear fuel for Soviet power plants and bombs.</p>
        <p>But there has been a decade of nearly total industrial collapse. And after five years of brutal civil war between Islamic militants and former Communist Party bosses that destroyed Mr. Ulimov's village and killed tens of thousands of Tajiks, many in Tajikistan thought the country had hit bottom.</p>
        <p>Now, the worst drought in a half-century, stretching from Syria to Mongolia, is threatening half of Tajikistan's population of six million with famine this fall. Wells have gone dry, rivers have ceased to flow and food supplies are disappearing.</p>
        <p>''All I can say is that I am alive,'' said Mr. Ulimov, 70, who stays nearby with relatives, his white beard radiant in the midday sun. ''I worked for the government for 45 years, my hands are ruined from picking cotton, I don't get a pension and our houses were destroyed in the war. We have nothing, and I cannot see any future.''</p>
        <p>Tajikistan, the poorest of the newly independent states of the former Soviet Union, is living a fragile peace that is threatened by Islamic extremism and relentless drug trafficking coursing out of Afghanistan, rampant corruption at home and now a scourge of drought.</p>
        <p>In September the United Nations urgently appealed to donor nations to provide $77 million in food aid and seeds to farmers, as a series of declining harvests in recent years has left the country with nearly depleted stocks of grain.</p>
        <p>But a similar appeal last year for $35 million in aid drew only $4.2 million in pledges. Officials from international aid organizations here, whose budgets now provide more direct assistance to the population than the Tajik government does, said in late September that they feared a catastrophe if help was not mobilized within two months.</p>
        <p>The world just does not care about Tajikistan, said Ross Mountain, the assistant emergency relief coordinator for the United Nations who accompanied journalists on a recent tour of the country.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mountain explained in an interview that donor fatigue was part of the problem, along with the reticence of Western governments to assist Tajikistan's authoritarian government, whose security forces carried out brutal ethnic purges during the civil war. But that does not alleviate the need to respond to a crisis for the people here, he asserts.</p>
        <p>''Drought does not automatically equal famine, but we think we are very close here,'' Mr. Mountain said. ''The people have virtually nothing left to eat, just tea and bread. They just had a failed harvest, and in a very short time they will have nothing to eat.''</p>
        <p>Last May, when the spring rains failed to materialize after a largely snowless winter, President Emomali Rakhmonov appealed to the United States, Canada, Japan, the European Union and the United Nations for several hundred thousand tons of grain to prevent famine from developing by the end of the year.</p>
        <p>Only the United States responded immediately, with a pledge of 65,000 tons of wheat, but delivery has been held up as American and Tajik officials haggle over how much will be an outright gift and how much will be sold off to pay for transport and distribution costs.</p>
        <p>Tajikistan also wants to tax the profits on any grain sold here, a United Nations official familiar with the negotiations said.</p>
        <p>The impact of the drought has been the worst for Afghanistan so far, but the second-hardest-hit country is Tajikistan. A $67 million appeal for Afghanistan already has drawn $41 million in pledges, largely from the Arab world, United Nations officials said. Iran, also hard hit by drought, has allocated $300 million of its own resources to meet emergency food requirements.</p>
        <p>In Soviet times Moscow would have been responsible for rescuing the Tajiks. And though Russia still is Tajikistan's closest security partner, with its troops guarding Tajikistan's border with Afghanistan, helping the people here is the least of Russia's priorities as it struggles with its own economic woes.</p>
        <p>''Tajikistan is kind of a forgotten country, and it is difficult to find donors,'' said Charlotta Relander, director of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. Speaking to reporters in Dushanbe, the capital, in late September, she said the failed harvest this year had been preceded by two years of bad harvests, compounded by ''an incredible rise in the level of poverty in the last 10 years.''</p>
        <p>''The situation was bad anyway, but the drought has made it even worse,'' she said, adding that as many as two million people will face starvation in two to three months as the last stocks of grain and the summer fruit harvest run out.</p>
        <p>In a town call Sovetski, 120 miles northwest of here, Mamlakat Allamnova is the principal of Middle School No. 3, a three-story building whose windows were all blown out or broken during the civil war, which raged from 1992 to 1997. When winter winds sweep into the classrooms later this year, the school will close.</p>
        <p>Ms. Allamnova said the school had lost half of its students in the last decade. Of those who attended at the beginning of this year, she said, a quarter dropped out as their families fled villages scorched by drought.</p>
        <p>In Soviet times Tajikistan boasted of a literacy rate of more than 90 percent, but today the educational system has followed all other institutions into a state of collapse.</p>
        <p>''The children cannot sit for classes all day, because of malnutrition,'' Ms. Allamnova said. ''After the war everything fell apart, and some children don't come to school because not all of the children in the family have clothes, especially in winter.''</p>
        <p>Even some of her teachers are deserting the filthy classrooms, because they receive no salaries and must forage for food on their own tiny plots of land.</p>
        <p>''If our government doesn't help us and we don't get anything from international organizations, I don't see how we will survive,'' she said.</p>
        <p>On the high slopes outside Sovetski, about 100 people a month have been moving away from the village of Jorubkul, where 3,000 acres of wheat planted by the collective this spring came out of the ground and then died because there has been no rain since March.</p>
        <p>Under Communism, Tajikistan was a lattice work of irrigation canals, aqueducts and pumping stations that supported collectivized cotton production and other agriculture, but what the war did not destroy has fallen into disrepair.</p>
        <p>The irrigation pipes and pumping station that used to supply water to Jorubkul for small-scale crops and drinking water also broke down this summer, and the 9,000 farmers and their families now share the drinking water from two pipes that operate for an hour a day.</p>
        <p>''Agriculture is the only thing we have, and if there is no rain, there is no life,'' said Amon Salimov, 72, who put the last of his money into five acres of wheat seed in the spring only to see it wither and die.</p>
        <p>He has two sons, one of them unemployed and the other an unpaid teacher, and seven daughters. But Mr. Salimov said he would stay in the village rather than flee. ''We are out of everything,'' he said. ''We have no wheat. We have no money. We have no fertilizer or food. I don't have any options.</p>
        <p>''If there is no rain, I am just going to stay here and die.''</p>
