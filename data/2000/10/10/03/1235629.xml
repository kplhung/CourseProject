        <p>Delays in the production of flu vaccine have led federal health officials to recommend that the drug first go to people at greatest risk, like the elderly.</p>
        <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said last week that flu vaccine supplies would probably reach last year's level of about 75 million doses. But it issued a series of recommendations to help make sure that if shortages occurred, the vaccine would go to people most in need.</p>
        <p>''Although the vaccine supply this year should be sufficient to meet the usual demand,'' the centers said, ''the situation remains fluid and some questions about supply and demand will remain unanswered until much later into the flu season.''</p>
        <p>Vaccine makers alerted federal officials in June that there would be delays and possibly shortages. Last week, federal officials recommended that healthy people put off getting their shots, and that through December and later, health care workers should focus on the at-risk populations.</p>
        <p>These include about 35 million people 65 or older, up to 39 million people with medical conditions that put them at risk, and about 2 million pregnant women.</p>
