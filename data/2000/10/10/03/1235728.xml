        <p>Bridgestone/ Firestone Inc., a unit of the Bridgestone Corporation of Japan, said tonight that it had made 27.5 million Firestone Steeltex tires, the brand that federal regulators began investigating last Friday after receiving 169 complaints of tire failure. The tires were made from 1991 to 2000 in Aiken, S.C.; Decatur, Ill.; Joliette, Quebec; Lavergne, Tenn.; and Wilson, N.C.</p>
        <p>General Motors said today that it had put the tires on some of its 1994 to 2001 Chevrolet and GMC full-size sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks and some of its 1996 to 2001 Chevrolet and GMC full-size and one-ton passenger and cargo vans. Ford Motor had said on Friday that at least since last year, it had been putting the tires on all of its Excursion full-size sport utility vehicles and 40 percent of its Super Duty pickup trucks and Econoline vans.</p>
