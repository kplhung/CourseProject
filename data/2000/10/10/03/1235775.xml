        <p>AS a gay rights lawyer, she has argued -- in baggy trousers -- a workplace discrimination case during which one judge swiveled in his chair and turned his back on her, and another took notes on her summation only to reveal a page of doodling he balled up and lofted toward the wastebasket as if shooting hoops. Lost the case? Yes. Lost her temper? Not in court.</p>

        <p>AS a gay rights lawyer, she has argued -- in baggy trousers -- a workplace discrimination case during which one judge swiveled in his chair and turned his back on her, and another took notes on her summation only to reveal a page of doodling he balled up and lofted toward the wastebasket as if shooting hoops. Lost the case? Yes. Lost her temper? Not in court.</p>
        <p>Leave it to Beatrice Dohrn, a petite, pugilistic lesbian with an up-front agenda who has exposed numerous antigay policies, to help make the United States military and the Boy Scouts of America squirm in court. She couldn't be happier to see the Scouts, their image now in flux, continue squirming well beyond court.</p>
        <p>The way romantics say they'll always have Paris, Ms. Dohrn, stepping down next month after nearly a decade spent refining litigation for the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, will always have this: she made the opponent flinch. Even if neither of those landmark cases cemented gay rights, others did.</p>
        <p>No, the famous ''don't ask, don't tell'' epic was not resolved in favor of gays who accused the military of discriminating against them, nor did James Dale, a gay Eagle Scout from Monmouth County, N.J., persuade nine Supreme Court justices that the Scouts were wrong to throw him out. (They supported the Scouts, 5-4.)</p>
        <p>But Ms. Dohrn remains buoyed that Lambda's arguments found their way onto the Supreme Court's radar screen and, by extension, into the public consciousness. On her watch, Lambda, a gay rights advocacy group, became ''an institution,'' she said, so she feels it's safe to leave.</p>
        <p>As for how she views those big court battles, don't expect Ms. Dohrn, who describes herself as ''a fighting kind of girl,'' to mince words. It was the Boy Scouts who emerged the losers from litigation, she said.</p>
        <p>''They won the case in that they won the right to be that nasty a discriminator, but I think they're losing the war out here. They won the right, but we're way ahead on the question of 'Is it right?' '' She sees a big-picture victory in the court of public opinion.</p>
        <p>Not so her bout with the military.</p>
        <p>''It's such a bunch of double-speak, dishonesty and gobbledygook,'' she sputters, referring to ''don't ask, don't tell,'' the very name of which ''was a public relations coup to begin with.''</p>
        <p>'' 'Don't be,' that's really what the policy is,'' she said. ''It's the biggest exercise in disingenuous and discriminatory intent and action. It makes me nuts that it continues to exist.''</p>
        <p>Not quite nuts, maybe, but angry. Ms. Dohrn despises artifice in public policy and private life.</p>
        <p>SHE was just 7, a tomboyish, lawn-mowing sort of girl in West Paterson, N.J., when she swore off skirts because they made her feel like a fraud. As for those assurances she'd grow up and get married like everybody else in suburbia, forget it. Her nonconformity was no phase.</p>
        <p>''I was 7 years old and writing this tortured, never-see-the-light-of-day love poetry to my camp counselor, a woman,'' says Ms. Dohrn, who says she metamorphosed from a stand-offish youngster into ''the most out-of-closet, in-your-face'' woman on Bennington College's campus in the late 1970's. The place was artsy, not radical, but it didn't take long for her to realize she was more enthusiastic about arguing sexual politics than pocketing her degree.</p>
        <p>After graduation, she moved to New York City, and was earning $8,660 a year as a paralegal when it dawned on her that there might be a way to become a lawyer without selling out to ''the establishment.''</p>
        <p>What she wanted to do was inject society with a dose of the gay pride she'd felt since childhood. Ms. Dohrn has taken on every gay rights issue on the docket -- same-sex marriage, civil rights of gay students, custody rights for gay parents -- since landing her dream job as the legal director for Lambda in 1993 after a stint with the Legal Aid Society. Her advice to gays is, don't ask to be treated better, demand to be treated equally.</p>
        <p>''I have never not been out as a lesbian, never been able to be in the closet about anything,'' remarks Ms. Dohrn, whose day of reckoning with her parents, who fled Germany during the Nazi period, was less than catastrophic. She came home from college and told them she was a lesbian. They said, ''We thought so.''</p>
        <p>Even as a penny-pinched Rutgers University law student, when she interviewed with a corporate firm, she showed up in trousers that fairly shouted, ''I'm gay and proud of it.''</p>
        <p>To her surprise, she not only got the summer job that financed her third year of law school (her motive in briefly going mainstream), but a full-time offer that she politely rejected because Wall Street was not her career destination. Funny that Lambda's office is at 120 Wall Street.</p>
        <p>At 42, she's still wearing the pants, and beyond a splatter of gray in her modified crew cut, she hardly looks ready for retirement. But she is taking a step back from ''the movement'' to rethink her role.</p>
        <p>In Manhattan, she's helping a friend from her Legal Aid days who is a single mother raise 6-year-old Benjamin, and lives across the street from them on West 108th. She's drawn a blank on her next career commitment, sure only that she can't plot it until she extricates herself from the job that's been her ''whole life.''</p>
        <p>''When I'm not having an anxiety attack about it,'' she said, ''it's clear to me I need to move on.''</p>
