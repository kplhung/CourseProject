        <p>A two-year effort that organizers said would bring new voices and ideas to the campaign for tighter gun control began today at 300 colleges and universities.</p>
        <p>The events were coordinated by the Alliance for Justice, a liberal group here that monitors judicial selections, and Physicians for Social Responsibility, a doctors' group that advocates stricter gun laws.</p>
        <p>The campaign seeks measures like mandatory gun licensing, safety locks and registration for gun owners.</p>
        <p>Nan Aron, president of the Alliance for Justice, said the group hoped to put a ''human face on the tragedy of gun violence,'' which claims the lives of more than 3,500 children each year.</p>
        <p>Attorney General Janet Reno appeared at an event in Baltimore. The television talk show host Rosie O'Donnell and Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, participated in New York, and Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Andrew M. Cuomo spoke in Washington.</p>
        <p>A short film featuring Martin Sheen, who portrays the president on the television series ''The West Wing,'' was shown at many of the events. It focuses on three victims of gun violence: Songha Willis of Philadelphia, 28, who was robbed and killed outside a nightclub; Kenzo Dix of California, 15, who died when a gun he and a classmate were playing with accidentally fired; and Sean Woods of Texas, who, at 19, committed suicide using a handgun.</p>
