        <p>INDONESIA: SUHARTO SON A NO-SHOW -- Former President Suharto's youngest son, Hutomo Mandala Putra, failed to obey a summons to appear in court where prosecutors planned to arrest him to begin serving an 18-month prison sentence for corruption handed down on Sept. 22. Lawyers for Mr. Hutomo, left, who is known as Tommy, said he did not show up because he had not received a copy of the conviction order. With a court ruling last week that Mr. Suharto was too sick to stand trial on corruption charges, the country is watching to see if the Government will jail Mr. Hutomo.</p>

        <p>INDONESIA: EAST TIMOR SUSPECT -- The Government identified the militia leader Eurico Guterres as a leading suspect in its investigation of the murderous rampage in East Timor last year after the territory voted to secede from Indonesia. Prosecutors said Mr. Guterres and three other suspects, including an officer, would be summoned for questioning on Friday. Mr. Guterres warned that if he is arrested his supporters would take over a district of East Timor.</p>

        <p>PHILIPPINES: 12 HOSTAGES FREED -- In the first major success of a 17-day rescue assault, Philippine troops freed 12 Christian evangelists after one escaped and alerted the military. The escaped evangelist was taken in a military helicopter and pointed out the rebels' camp. The rebels fled after a brief clash, said the military chief of staff, Gen. Angelo Reyes. The recovery of the evangelists, held by Abu Sayyaf rebels for three months, leaves five hostages in guerrilla hands: an American, three Malaysians and a Filipino.</p>

        <p>INDIA: BOY, 13, CONVICTED IN BURNING -- A 13-year-old boy has been convicted in the mob killing of an Australian missionary and his two sons. The teenager was sentenced to 14 years in prison. Graham Staines, 58, and his sons, Philip, 10, and Timothy, 8, were burned alive inside the vehicle where they were sleeping after a Bible study meeting in the village of Manoharpur in the eastern state of Orissa in January 1999. Fifteen people have been arrested in connection with the attack.</p>

        <p>CANADA: LIBERAL LEAD -- With Prime Minister Jean Chretien hinting at calling a November election, two polls taken last week indicate that the governing Liberal Party enjoys wide support. In an Ipsos Reid poll of 1,841 adults, 44 percent backed the Liberals, compared with 25 percent for the Canadian Alliance. A Compas poll of 500 people gave the Liberals 47 percent support, compared with 24 percent for the alliance, the largest conservative opposition party.</p>

        <p>CANADA: TRUDEAU TRIBUTE -- In a tribute to the late Pierre Trudeau, Canadians turned out alongside railway tracks to wave goodbye as a train carrying his coffin traveled slowly from Ottawa to his native Montreal. His two surviving sons, Justin and Sacha, accompanied their father's coffin to Montreal's City Hall, where mourners waited for hours to pay their respects. Jimmy Carter and Fidel Castro are among those expected to attend the funeral in Montreal today.</p>

        <p>PARAGUAY: FINANCE CHIEF FIRED -- In the latest phase of a cabinet shake-up that has seen the replacement of the head of the central bank, President Luis Gonzalez Macchi has fired Minister of Finance Federico Zayas after he refused a request to resign. Mr. Gonzalez Macchi took office in March 1999 when his predecessor fled after being implicated in the assassination of his vice president.</p>

        <p>IRAQ: AEROFLOT SERVICE -- Iraq's minister of transport said scheduled flights between Russia and Iraq would begin in two weeks and asked for Tehran's permission to use Iranian airspace, Iran's official news agency said. The Russian airline Aeroflot said it had signed a memorandum with an Iraqi Airways delegation on restoring air service, although no dates had been set. All regular services to Iraq have been suspended since the 1990-91 gulf war.</p>

        <p>IVORY COAST: NIGERIA REJECTS PLEA -- President Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria rejected a call by Gen. Robert Guei, Ivory Coast's military leader, to hand over two former government members reported to have sought refuge in the Nigerian Embassy in Abidjan. ''They need more than ordinary assurance before they can be handed over to anybody,'' Mr. Obasanjo said. General Guei has described a foiled Sept. 18 assault on his home as a bid to assassinate him.</p>

        <p>BRITAIN: TORIES 'READY TO GOVERN' -- Exultant after recent opinion polls gave them their first lead over the Labor Party in eight years, the opposition Tories opened their annual conference declaring they were ready to return to power. The party's leader, William Hague, said he planned to introduce a new social agenda. ''We are ready to be a government because we are ready to govern for all the people,'' he said.</p>

        <p>SWITZERLAND: LEGALIZING MARIJUANA -- The Swiss cabinet has proposed making it legal to smoke marijuana, but said other drugs should remain illegal for now. The proposed revisions of the country's drug laws must now be submitted to Parliament. In 1998 the Swiss voted down legalizing all drug consumption, but cannabis is widely used in the country.</p>

        <p>SPAIN: FORMER BASQUE LEADER JAILED -- A judge sentenced a former leader of the armed Basque separatist group E.T.A. to 12 years in jail for a car-bomb attack on the headquarters of the Spanish Navy in 1987 in which a sailor was wounded. Interior Ministry officials said Francisco Mugika Garmendia, who was extradited from France this year, was the E.T.A.'s military chief in the 1980's and masterminded attacks on Spain's security services.</p>
