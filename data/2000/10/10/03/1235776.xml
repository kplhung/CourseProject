        <p>In a withering report, a state board monitoring Nassau County's fiscal crisis said yesterday that the county executive had failed to balance the budget in his new rescue plan.</p>
        <p>The report, which urged county officials to come up with a sound proposal by the end of the month or face a state takeover, is a new chapter in the story of how one of the nation's wealthiest counties has moved to the edge of bankruptcy in a soaring economic climate.</p>

        <p>In a withering report, a state board monitoring Nassau County's fiscal crisis said yesterday that the county executive had failed to balance the budget in his new rescue plan.</p>
        <p>The report, which urged county officials to come up with a sound proposal by the end of the month or face a state takeover, is a new chapter in the story of how one of the nation's wealthiest counties has moved to the edge of bankruptcy in a soaring economic climate.</p>
        <p>Yesterday's report from the Nassau Interim Finance Authority contained the panel's first public comment on a plan submitted by the county executive, Thomas S. Gulotta, and criticized by county lawmakers who say that it lacks detail and that its numbers do not add up.</p>
        <p>Although the state board agreed with many of the budget's critics, it gave the job of fixing Nassau's financial troubles not only to Mr. Gulotta, but also to the County Legislature, opening the door to higher tax increases or more severe cuts in services than the county executive has proposed.</p>
