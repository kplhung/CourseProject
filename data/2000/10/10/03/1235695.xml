        <p>Maria Isabel Urrutia made the most of her gold medal moment as she tried to address the armed guerrillas in her homeland.</p>
        <p>''I'm sending a special message to them,'' she said from Sydney, Australia, after winning the women's 75-kilogram (165 1/3-pound) Olympic weight-lifting event, ''hoping they take pity on the families of all the people they have in captivity.''</p>

        <p>Maria Isabel Urrutia made the most of her gold medal moment as she tried to address the armed guerrillas in her homeland.</p>
        <p>''I'm sending a special message to them,'' she said from Sydney, Australia, after winning the women's 75-kilogram (165 1/3-pound) Olympic weight-lifting event, ''hoping they take pity on the families of all the people they have in captivity.''</p>
        <p>The message couldn't have been more timely. Two nights before, here in Urrutia's home city, 50 armed men from the second of two guerrilla armies fighting the state for nearly 40 years kidnapped an estimated 80 people from roadside restaurants on the outskirts of town.</p>
        <p>After Urrutia became Colombia's first Olympic gold medalist, her achievement was best understood in the context of this troubled country's chaos. In less than two weeks, countrymen have converted her into a symbol for everything from the value of hard work to a symbol of peace amid civil war.</p>
        <p>In the crowded, work-in-progress house where 9 of her 13 brothers and sisters died before her athletic career ever began, well-wishers came and went upon her return. There were local police and ''lifelong friends'' whom, Urrutia's mother, Nelly, insisted were no more than Johnny-come-latelies.</p>
        <p>Before her daughter's arrival, Nelly had gotten on her first plane ride and found herself in the capital city of Bogota, on national television, standing beside Colombia President Andres Pastrana.</p>
        <p>''Don't get mad or anything,'' she said to Pastrana, ''but I really think my daughter's medal should make you think about giving more support to our country's athletes, since most of them are pretty poor.''</p>
        <p>Her mother knows. Twenty-two years ago, when Maria Isabel was just 13, the teenager walked an hour to and from Cali's track and field stadium every day, lacking coins for the bus. Soon after taking a job serving coffee in a local company, she was fired two months later when she asked for permission to compete at a meet in Chile.</p>
        <p>At 20, Urrutia began training in the morning and working as a telephone operator in the afternoon, a routine she continued until recently. In 1988, a Bulgarian trainer, Gantcho Mitco Karouchrov, felt Urrutia had the physique of a champion in another sport. Women's weight lifting had just held its first world championship in Daytona Beach, Fla., the year before.</p>
        <p>For a decade, under the same trainer, Urrutia won nine gold medals in world championships. But the hardships didn't cease.</p>
        <p>Several years ago, Karouchrov lamented: ''We can't work with the state's promises. We need results. We have no equipment, no medicine, nothing.''</p>
        <p>In 1999, at the age of 34, Urrutia thought of retiring. But the International Olympic Committee decided to include women's weight lifting as a medal sport in Sydney for the first time, and she was encouraged. However in August 1999 at the Pan-American Games in Winnipeg, Canada, she tore cartilage in her knee.</p>
        <p>Her coach and surgeon said she would have to lose 40 pounds to recover.</p>
        <p>She did, with the help of acupuncture, ''to control the mental side of eating habits.''</p>
        <p>Colombia's Olympic Committee then announced it would halve her support for this year from $20,000. ''They didn't think I was going to make it, so they didn't want to invest in me,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Andres Botero, the president of Colombia's Olympic Committee, denied her charge, calling the dispute ''the sort of contract negotiation all athletes go through.'' In March, while the issue was still boiling, Botero told El Espectador, a leading daily, that he had more confidence in a younger member of the women's weight-lifting team.</p>
        <p>The conflict was resolved in June while Urrutia trained for Sydney with her own savings. She holds no bitterness and dedicated her triumph ''to those who believed in me and those who didn't.''</p>
        <p>On the day after winning her historic medal, a cartoon appeared in Bogota's newspaper, El Tiempo. It showed President Pastrana struggling to lift a pair of barbells, with the words ''guerrillas,'' ''kidnapping,'' ''narcotics trafficking,'' and ''unemployment'' written on the weights. In the cartoon, he screams: ''Maria Isabel!''</p>
        <p>When Urrutia arrived home late last week, Pastrana was not at the airport to greet her.</p>
        <p>Asked about his absence, Urrutia said ''someone said it was because he was busy seeing David Copperfield,'' the magician who was in Bogota. Then she laughed and smiled.</p>
