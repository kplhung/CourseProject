        <p>For months now, Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore have been arguing on the campaign trail over whose tax plan would help particular families more. Often the candidates actually introduce families they say would do better under their plan.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush would give almost everyone a tax cut, while Mr. Gore would give tax relief only to low-income families and those with modest incomes and special expenses like children in day care or college or those with elderly dependents.</p>
        <p>To help sort out the winners and losers, The New York Times asked Deloitte &amp; Touche, the accounting firm, to examine how a dozen hypothetical individuals and families in various financial circumstances would fare under the competing plans.</p>
        <p>The examination found that the Bush plan would be much more generous to the wealthy.</p>
        <p>For example, a couple earning $450,000 would have their income taxes reduced by more than $12,000 a year. The Gore plan would be of no benefit to this family.</p>
        <p>The Gore proposal would also give no tax relief to single people and childless couples, including retirees, even those with modest incomes who would save some taxes under the Bush plan.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, Mr. Gore would give a much larger rebate than Mr. Bush to low-income single-parent families, like a mother with two or three children and an income of $29,000.</p>
        <p>Since Mr. Bush's plan is twice as costly as Mr. Gore's -- slightly more than $1 trillion over 10 years, not counting his proposed repeal of the estate tax, as against about $500 billion for the Gore plan -- it is not surprising that Mr. Bush would give bigger tax savings to more families than Mr. Gore would.</p>
        <p>That reflects their contrasting philosophies.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore would spend the difference on the national debt and on popular government programs like education, universal health insurance for children and prescription drug coverage for those on Medicare. Mr. Bush holds that the tax cut would allow people and not the government to decide the best way to allocate resources.</p>
        <p>The main element in the Bush plan is an across-the-board reduction in tax rates that would be enjoyed by all taxpayers. In addition, he would double the existing tax credit for each child to $1,000 from $500, and for two-earner couples, he would give an additional deduction of up to $3,000.</p>
        <p>The principal aspects of the Gore plan are an expansion of the existing earned-income tax credit for low-income workers, an increase in the maximum child-care credit to $2,400 from $960, an additional credit for after-school expenses for children 13 through 16, a higher standard deduction for working couples who do not itemize deductions, a $3,000 credit to families who care for ill or disabled relatives, a tax credit to people without employer-paid health insurance to help offset the cost of buying insurance and a tax break of up to $2,800 to help offset the cost of college tuition.</p>
        <p>There were some unexpected findings.</p>
        <p>For example, a couple with three children in day care and an income of $39,000 would be better off in terms of taxes under the Bush proposals. The doubling of the tax credit for children under the Bush plan would save more in taxes at that income level than Mr. Gore's child credit.</p>
        <p>And a rather affluent self-employed couple with an income of $78,000 and a child in college would save more under the Gore plan because of Mr. Gore's tax break to help offset the cost of tuition.</p>
        <p>The accountants at Deloitte &amp; Touche assumed that the taxpayers studied with incomes of $39,000 and below would take the standard deduction and that those with higher incomes would itemize their deductions and take deductions typical at their income level. They also assumed that in families with two wage-earners, one earned 60 percent of the income and the other 40 percent.</p>
        <p>All the income was assumed to come from wages, dividends and interest except in the case of the family with an income of $450,000. In that case, it was assumed that $50,000 came from long-term capital gains.</p>
        <p>The Bush plan was treated as if it were fully in effect, although that would not be the case until 2006. The Gore plan would all go into effect at once.</p>
        <p>The accountants did not count Mr. Gore's proposal to give a tax credit of up to $3,000 to taxpayers with incomes below $170,000 who pay more than half the cost of care of an elderly relative. The accountants decided that to include it would have skewed the results in a study that examined so few families.</p>
        <p>But it is worth noting, for example, that under the Gore plan, the working couple in the study with an income of $78,000 would have had almost its entire tax liability eliminated if it had an ill grandparent living in the house.</p>
        <p>For the purposes of the study, the accountants at Deloitte &amp; Touche did not consider Mr. Bush's proposal to abolish the estate tax, since it would not affect anyone's annual income tax. Nor did they include proposals by both candidates for tax-free retirement and savings accounts.</p>
        <p>The computer model used by the accountants in examining the Bush proposals did not make adjustments for the effect of the alternative minimum tax. This is a provision of the existing law originally intended to make sure wealthy people paid taxes even if they had large deductions and exemptions. Increasingly in recent years, taxpayers with more modest incomes and smaller deductions have found they owed additional taxes under the provision.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's economic advisers have acknowledged that the alternative minimum tax would mean somewhat smaller tax savings under his plan than would otherwise be the case for many affluent taxpayers. There would be little if any effect on taxpayers under the Gore plan.</p>
        <p>Citizens for Tax Justice, a labor-backed research organization, included the alternative minimum tax in its model and found that under the Bush plan, the tax savings would be reduced by 44 percent for a family earning $125,000, by 79 percent for a family with an income of $185,000 and by 41 percent for a family with an income of $400,000. The effect on most families with incomes below $80,000 would be inconsequential.</p>
        <p>THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE TAX PLANS  Correction:  October 4, 2000, Wednesday  A chart yesterday showing the effect of the presidential candidates' tax plans on 12 hypothetical individuals and families misstated the taxes for one case -- a single parent with three children and an annual income of $29,000. That family would be due a rebate of $1,210 under current law, $2,218 under the Bush plan and $3,462 under the Gore plan; it would not owe those amounts.</p>
        <p>The chart also labeled one case incorrectly. The family that would save $2,322 under the Bush plan and $1,038 under the Gore plan was a working couple with three children and an annual income of $39,000 -- not two children and an income of $39,000.</p>
