        <p>It lasts just a moent, no longer than a mayfly hatch on a remote Montana river. The Discovery Channel hasn't documented the phenomenon yet, but it should, because, for three or four days each fall, a circuit of small and sinuous streets in Milan is suddenly overrun not with the usual tourists slogging from one luxury store to another, but with a herd of unbelievably beautiful beings.</p>
        <p>Long-legged, impossibly young and improbably thin, they teeter along the cobblestones of the Via Gesu, the Via della Spiga and the Via Montenapoleone, wearing hip-slung jeans and stilettos. Their faces are creased with looks of near-Darwinian intensity. They carry big portfolios, tiny purses and cell phones. And they move fast, because their schedules are frenetic, time is short, and beauty, as is well known, is fleeting.</p>
        <p>It is casting season for the spring 2001 collections, and the models are in migration. The famous girls (and in the modeling business, women are always called girls) don't arrive until the last moment. The Rayder sisters, Missy and Frankie, say, or Gisele Bundchen or Mini Anden can come to Milan in leisurely fashion, since their bookings are already secured. They breeze in late and spend whatever time isn't given over to fittings darting from the lobby of the Four Seasons or the Hotel Principe di Savoia, where the fashion pack prefers to be billeted, into chauffeured cars for dinners at Le Langhe or risotto con funghi (and a Marlboro Light) at Bice, where everyone goes to see and be seen.</p>
        <p>For novices, the end of September and the first days of October in Milan are an entirely different and less heady experience, a window for survival, and the briefest period during which to be cast for one of the at least 100 shows listed by the Italian fashion trade group, the Camera Nazionale della Moda Italiana, and then possibly noticed by designers, editors and photographers and plucked from the runway for a real career.</p>
        <p>Milan's shows follow those in London and precede the ones in Paris. Both these other cities are more expensive places for introducing a new model or, as agents say, ''starting a girl.'' For new girls, then, Milan has traditionally been the city in which to assemble a photographic portfolio, make business contacts and shed baby fat and the trappings of small-town girlhood, whether from Whittier, Calif., or some backwater in Brazil or Byelorussia.</p>
        <p>''I've got 10 castings today,'' Laura Goulet, 20, said last Thursday, as she stood on the Via Montenapoleone, reading a street map. Ms. Goulet had so far been hired for Genny's show. Her agency had booked another 15 appointments for her.</p>
        <p>The lucky ones are provided with cars and drivers. Most are forced to hoof it between the casting calls at the designers' showrooms. It's because of this that the crooked pedestrians-only streets -- where yellow chrysanthemums are mounded in urns, and where virtually every 19th-century building and 18th-century palazzo has a luxury shop at street level -- are thronged for three days with a gorgeous herd.</p>
        <p>''You need to conquer Europe before you can seriously hit New York,'' said Ana Marie Burk, as she stood outside the Prada women's store on Via Sant'Andrea. Inside, window dressers were installing a $9,000 silver sequin dress of the sort that women like Ms. Burk help render irresistible.</p>
        <p>A 21-year-old with a pre-Raphaelite face and a mane of crimped blond hair, Ms. Burk was until a year ago an architecture student at the University of Virginia. She dropped out, she said, ''because I couldn't be stuck in Virginia anymore, and I wanted to see the architecture of the world, not in a book.''</p>
        <p>After joining Milan's Beatrice agency, Ms. Burk had been sent to New York to walk the runway for Yeohlee and Miguel Adrover. She then hopped a plane to work in Alexander McQueen's show in London. Now, she was racing between appointments, on a schedule that had her visiting 17 designer studios in two days. ''So far, it looks pretty good,'' Ms. Burk said, adding with a laugh: ''The Italians all say I look like a Botticelli. I can be Venus on the half shell if it helps get jobs.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Burk ducked into an atelier off a courtyard on the Via della Spiga, where 40 or so models were lined up for a casting call for the Ruffo runway show. Haidee Findlay-Nevin, a freelance stylist for Ruffo, was at a folding table, where she had been interviewing a model every three minutes for the last six hours. There were 16 openings for the Ruffo show; at 2 p.m., the appointment list showed 200 names.</p>
        <p>''You're essentially looking for something individual,'' in a model, Ms. Findlay-Nevin said. ''It's a bit of a nightmare, though, because you might like a girl, and hold out as long as you can to see if you can get her, and then lose her to Gucci,'' which is showing on the same day. As a line of young Russian hopefuls -- who seem to have supplanted last year's Brazilians as the girls of the moment -- trooped through, Ms. Findlay-Nevin took a photo card from each and asked her to demonstrate her walk. ''Very natural, direct, you don't have to pose,'' she said.</p>
        <p>After Katerina Hamplova, a nearly six-foot blonde from Ukraine exited, a visitor remarked how amazing it was that there could be so many beautiful people, not just in the world, but in one place at one time. ''And still they get rejected,'' Ms. Findlay-Nevin said with a weary smile.</p>
