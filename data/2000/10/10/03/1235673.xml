        <p>View From Behind A Trademark</p>
        <p>SALLY JESSY RAPHAEL says she no longer needs glasses but cannot stop wearing them on television. ''The company won't let me take them off,'' she said yesterday, apparently referring to Studios USA, which produces and distributes her show.</p>
        <p>A recent eye test confirmed that her vision had improved, she said. ''The guy said, 'You don't really need these.' And I said, 'What do you mean, I built a career on them?' ''</p>
        <p>So her glasses have become the trademark she loves to hate.</p>
        <p>''You go to school, you get a master's degree, you study Shakespeare and wind up being famous for plastic glasses,'' she said. ''It's the only thing anyone wants to talk to me about. I can walk through an airport and think someone's going to ask me an intelligent question and they'll go, 'You're not wearing your red glasses.' At parties with relatively sophisticated people? 'You're Sally Jessy? I thought she wore red glasses.' Not always, babe, not always.''</p>
        <p>Yesterday was the beginning of her 18th season, so she was asked the obvious question about how the talk-show world had changed in all those years. She mentioned the rise of sound-bite culture -- ''You cannot interview one person in daytime. You can't even interview two or three -- the public just gets bored. I don't care how big a star.''</p>
        <p>But what about JERRY SPRINGER, the former mayor of Cincinnati who began his television career in the same year she went on the air? She said that she had been ''tarred with the same brush,'' adding that she receives fewer invitations to give speeches than she once did.</p>
        <p>''The minute Jerry came in, that kind of thing dried up,'' she said. ''You're not even asked to speak at a friend's child's bar mitzvah anymore.''</p>
        <p>Withdrawal Is Called Wise</p>
        <p>MAYOR RUDOLPH W. GIULIANI sounded gleeful yesterday when asked about WILLIAM J. BRATTON'S decision not to run for mayor next year as a Republican.</p>
        <p>''I think that was a very wise decision,'' the mayor said happily at a news conference in Queens, adding for good measure that he did not consider Mr. Bratton -- the former police commissioner with whom he began feuding over credit for the drop in the crime rate in New York City -- qualified for the job. ''Not even close to it,'' Mr. Giuliani said. But the mayor demurred when asked if he thought his threats to do anything possible to keep Mr. Bratton out of the race had had the desired effect.</p>
        <p>''Nobody ever knows what the real reasons are that anybody makes a decision like that,'' Mr. Giuliani said, conjuring up memories of his own withdrawal from the race for the United States Senate in May.</p>
        <p>All Rodman, All the Time</p>
        <p>DENNIS RODMAN -- shirtless, in a sparkling black jacket, red-brimmed black cowboy hat, blond hair, silver rings shining through pierced ears, nostrils and lips -- gyrated from the bar to the dance floor to the stage at The World, the nightclub at W.W.F. New York, the World Wrestling Federation's restaurant on West 43rd Street near Broadway.</p>
        <p>Since he was celebrating the start of his own Web site, www.RodmanTV.com, he was being followed around by a camera crew that was filming every twist and jump. ''It will be all Dennis all the time,'' Mr. Rodman said of the Web site.</p>
        <p>''We're going to show parties I'll be going to, all around the country. Everyone will be on, from movie stars to midgets. Anything anyone would want to be entertained will be on.''</p>
        <p>In a corner of the V.I.P. room was JOE FRAZIER, the former heavyweight champion, with his son, MARVIS, also a retired boxer. They were toasting the 25th anniversary of the Thrilla in Manila, Joe Frazier's third and final fight with Muhammad Ali. Mr. Frazier lost, and said that now he and Mr. Ali had become friendly. ''We don't talk about our fights,'' he said. ''That's all behind us. We have children about the same age. We talk about them.''</p>
