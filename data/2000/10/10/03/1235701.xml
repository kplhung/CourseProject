        <p>Acting on the basis of DNA evidence, Gov. James S. Gilmore III of Virginia granted an ''absolute pardon'' yesterday to Earl Washington Jr., 17 years after Mr. Washington was convicted for the rape and homicide of a Culpeper County woman.</p>
        <p>At the same time, the governor declined to set Mr. Washington free, choosing to have him continue serving a 30-year sentence for a separate burglary and battery conviction, with that issue to be left to the state parole process.</p>
        <p>The 7 p.m. announcement in Richmond enraged Mr. Washington's lawyers, who accused the governor of being punitive in keeping Mr. Washington in prison for the lesser charge that he otherwise would have been paroled for eight years ago, by their estimate.</p>
        <p>''It is punitive, it is cruel, it is insensitive,'' said Barry C. Scheck, a professor at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law at Yeshiva University who is co-director of the Innocence Project, a pro bono defense program that has used DNA evidence to free convicted murderers.</p>
        <p>Mark A. Miner, Governor Gilmore's press spokesman, responded that Mr. Washington, who is mentally retarded, ''is not a pillar of the community,'' considering the secondary conviction involved the ''brutal beating'' of a 73-year-old woman and the gunshot wounding of a second victim.</p>
        <p>''There's no room for politics in this important criminal justice issue,'' Mr. Miner commented to the accusation by Peter Neufeld, co-director of the Innocence Project, that Governor Gilmore, a Republican, had tempered his decision in the hope of being chosen United States attorney general if Gov. George W. Bush is elected president.</p>
        <p>Mr. Washington was days from execution in 1994 when his death sentence was commuted to life by Gov. L. Douglas Wilder, a Democrat, after an initial DNA test raised the possibility that someone else might have been involved in the death of Rebecca Williams, a mother of three.</p>
        <p>Governor Gilmore's announcement disclosed that the new DNA test identified a known convicted rapist as involved in the crime and said that he had ordered a new state police investigation. His announcement added: ''It is important for the public to understand that absence of DNA evidence does not necessarily mean an individual is absent from the crime scene -- just that he has not left any DNA markers.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Washington's lawyers complained that the governor, in his language, had declined to admit Mr. Washington ''is stone cold innocent'' of the murder-rape and had offered him no compassionate credit for the decade he already served on death row for the erroneous conviction.</p>
        <p>In his statement, Governor Gilmore said that a jury afforded modern DNA evidence ''would have reached a different conclusion'' in the case. ''I have decided it is just and appropriate to intervene in the judicial process by granting Earl Washington an absolute pardon for the capital murder and rape of Rebecca Williams,'' he declared.</p>
