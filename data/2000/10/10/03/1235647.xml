        <p>Margo Jefferson comments on cultural-artistic scene in France in 1925, where black American artists were often more welcome than they were at home; recalls of Josephine Baker's 1925 Paris revue La Revue Negre, which had triumphant three-month run; photographs, posters and drawings related to show are on view in exhibit at Chez Josephine, Manhattan restaurant on West 42d Street owned by Baker's biographer and unofficial son, Jean-Claude Baker; photos (L)</p>

        <p>Nineteen twenty-five was a vintage year for American art on both sides of the color line.

        <p>Nineteen twenty-five was a vintage year for American art on both sides of the color line.

        <p>The lively arts held up their end with ease. The Gershwins, Rodgers and Hart and Vincent Youmans all had shows on Broadway; the Marx Brothers starred in their first musical, ''The Cocoanuts,'' with a book by George S. Kaufman and a score by Irving Berlin. You could see Chaplin in ''The Gold Rush'' and Keaton in ''Go West,'' and Al Jolson and Fanny Brice were among Vanity Fair's nominees for its annual Hall of Fame.</p>
        <p>Black artists were learning that they were often more welcome on the other side of the Atlantic, as a new show starring Josephine Baker would soon prove. Still, black writers had been given America's cultural imprimatur with the publication of ''The New Negro: Voices of the Harlem Renaissance,'' an anthology edited by Alain Locke with contributions from Langston Hughes, Claude McKay, Zora Neale Hurston and Countee Cullen. James Weldon Johnson and his brother J. Rosamund published the first volume of ''The Book of American Negro Spirituals.'' Oscar Micheaux's last silent film, ''Body and Soul,'' starred Paul Robeson, doubling as hero and villain.</p>
        <p>A Negro Hall of Fame would have included the Fletcher Henderson and King Oliver bands, Louis Armstrong (who played with both, then made the first of his groundbreaking ''Hot Five'' recordings as a leader), Bessie Smith, Ethel Waters and the musical theater stars Florence Mills and John W. Bubbles.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless Americans were rushing to Europe, buying Old World culture with new money and spreading New World culture around. With the franc at a pitifully low rate -- 24 to the dollar -- Paris was home to 43,000 pleasure-seeking Americans. And it had plenty to offer: artists like Matisse, Leger and Picasso; writers like Proust, Colette and Cocteau; distinguished modern composers and a venerable music hall tradition. Paris had a history of recognizing radical art from elsewhere: Stravinsky's ''Rite of Spring,'' Diaghilev's Ballets Russes; the dancing of Loie Fuller and Isadora Duncan. Call it transnational modernism.</p>
        <p>And so when a musical called ''La Revue Negre'' arrived there in late September, thanks to an American woman, Caroline Dudley Reagan, determined to show black American music and dance unhindered by fake crudity or fake gentility, Paris was ready.</p>
        <p>Avant-garde artists were already smitten with African masks and sculpture. Ordinary citizens were smitten or appalled, but rarely indifferent to jazz. (Small groups of black musicians had been in and out of the city since the war years; there were jazz recordings, there were enthusiastic if derivative French jazz bands, and ''le Charleston'' had made its appearance. But Paris had seen nothing that brought all these elements together: that synthesized art, music, movement, American urbanism and tropic exoticism, from the deep South to the Sahara.</p>
        <p>Then ''La Revue Negre,'' starring Baker, opened on Oct. 2. No one filmed the show during its triumphant three-month run. Photographs, posters and drawings will have to do (as with so much theater and dance), and gorgeous ones can be seen now in a compact, well-designed exhibit at Chez Josephine, the Manhattan restaurant at 414 West 42nd Street owned by Baker's biographer and unofficial son, Jean-Claude Baker.</p>
        <p>The exhibition opens today, as if to commemorate the reviews that proclaimed jazz, Josephine Baker and other cast members, and black American culture to be thrilling, disorienting, horrible, but impossible to escape or ignore. Critics spoke of assaults, hallucinations, machines and frenetic speed. Louis Douglas, the show's choreographer and lead male dancer, was said to have legs of uncanny intelligence; Baker was a sex symbol, a caricaturist and an ingenious ''ultra-modern mannequin.'' One critic wrote, ''We haven't had this much feeling of a bursting forth since the Ballets Russes.''</p>
        <p>French and American audiences saw their erotic visions of Africa and the black South. (One photo in the show shows the handsome African dancer Joe Alex with Baker on his back, her legs in a cartwheel; their skin gleams, and both are nude except for his loincloth, her feathered skirt and feathers circling their wrists and ankles. Audiences saw their racial terrors there as well; 1925 was the year that a Frenchman, Maurice Muret, published one of the more popular pseudo-scientific laments about the decline of the West, ''Le Crepuscule des Nations Blanches'' (translated in America as ''The Twilight of The White Races'').</p>
        <p>The revue -- the real, not the mythic show -- was the result of fine instincts, good luck and perfect timing. Reagan was a Chicago aristocrat married to a diplomat and bored with the diplomatic life. She had no profession, but she had intelligence and spirit. And she loved modern art. Gertrude Stein, Picasso and Leger were friends, and her passion for black culture had started in childhood under the tutelage of her progressive physician father. (She remembered sitting on the knee of the blues singer Clara Smith.)</p>
        <p>A nice example of synchchronicity: Baker had begun her career in a vaudeville company that starred Smith. And the dance that would make Baker famous -- that infamous Charleston, all angled limbs and shimmies, legs, arms and torso keeping separate but equal time -- had first given Dudley the idea for her show. A few years before moving to Paris she had watched eight black dancers, all women, rehearse the dance in a Washington theater. She later recalled that, overwhelmed, she vowed to ''show such artists, to amaze, flabbergast, dumbfound Paris . . . the elite, the masses, the artists from Picasso to the hippie painters of the streets.''</p>
        <p>Once the owner of the Champs-Elysees Music Hall gave the go-ahead (Leger had urged her on), Dudley began her talent search in New York. She couldn't afford the salaries demanded by Florence Mills and Ethel Waters; she chose Baker only after seeing her step in for a sick Waters one night at the Plantation, a nightspot above the Winter Garden theater that, like the Cotton Club, featured snazzy all-black shows for tony all-white audiences.</p>
        <p>''La Revue Negre'' had its own cultural pedigree. Will Marion Cook, who had composed Broadway's first black musical, ''Clorindy, or The Origin of the Cakewalk'' in 1898, supervised her choices. His son-in-law, Louis Douglas, the leading man, was a black expatriate, a superb dancer who had lived in Paris since he was 6. There was a suave, experienced singer, Maude de Forest, who would be upstaged by Baker, and 10 chorus girls, the Charleston Babies. When Cook and Dudley quarreled, the songwriter Clarence Williams, whose ''I Ain't Got Nobody'' was a standard of the day, took over the music.</p>
        <p>The orchestra was led by Claude Hopkins with his fine piano playing and his matinee-idol charm. The featured soloist was the great clarinetist and soprano saxophonist Sidney Bechet. (The Swiss conductor Ernst Ansermet had already written about Bechet in 1919.)</p>
        <p>With nine days to rehearse, an inexperienced producer, a newly assembled cast and scant funds, a miracle of technique, talent, revision and improvisation was required. And it took place. Picasso wanted to design the sets. (So, astonishingly, did the novelist John Dos Passos.)</p>
        <p>Reagan decided on the more commercial Miguel Covarrubias, well known for his pungent illustrations and caricatures in The New Yorker and Vanity Fair and for being as comfortable with black as with white artists. He devised extravagant sets: huge ripe fruits and vegetables; city lights, jungles, Memphis steamboats, improbably angled New York skyscrapers with Lucky Strike and Arrow Collar billboards for a jazz Pierrot and Columbine to dance before.</p>
        <p>''Where are we?'' wrote the painter Jacques-Emile Blanche in a brilliant essay called ''From Gaughin to La Revue Negre.'' ''In the Far West? In Havana? In the Salon of the Independents? In Florida? . . . The details will seem exquisite or frightful, but they blend in an unexpectedly harmonious ensemble. . . . The unity of style, which is lacking in our revues, exists in this one.''</p>
        <p>You can see the poster copied from the curtain that rose on ''La Revue.'' Made of tablecloth plastic (it sounds daring now, it was a money-saver then), it showed a jazz band and a dancer, with limbs, bodies and faces all rendered in bright, bold, shameless lines and planes: exuberant and alert, not in the least brutish or demeaning. You can see the musicians in impeccable black tie, blending Jazz Age poses of abandon with grave dignity. You can see Baker's passport application on which she was already reinventing herself: first saying she was married, then divorced, the single, then widowed.</p>
        <p>Nineteen twenty-five was also the year of Paris's spectacular Exposition Internationale des Arts Decoratifs et Industriels Modernes. Art Deco took its name from this exhibition, and two women danced at its grand closing dinner: Anna Pavlova during the appetizer and Baker during the main course.</p>
        <p>Cultural history is full of surprises, but it can have a certain classical balance as well. In 1900, when Paris opened its grand Exposition Coloniale Internationale, the Eiffel Tower was the wonder of the city. When Baker died in 1975, the French christened her ''the Eiffel Tower of the Music Hall.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  October 5, 2000, Thursday  An article on Monday about the cultural impact of ''La Revue Negre,'' in which Josephine Baker made her debut in Paris 75 years ago, misidentified the composer of both the show's music and a standard of the day, ''I Ain't Got Nobody.'' He was Spencer Williams, not Clarence Williams. The two composers and pianists worked together sometimes but were not related.</p>
