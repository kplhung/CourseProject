        <p>Small wonder the American Society of Civil Engineers has endorsed ''Building Big,'' PBS's five-part documentary series about bridges, domes, skyscrapers, dams and tunnels. These terrific programs trumpet the scientific derring-do of the creators without ignoring their equally compelling quixotic foolhardiness. There's even more bravado and pathos here than in the just-finished Olympics.</p>
        <p>While this series, which begins tonight, is largely a testament to engineering and architectural ingenuity and ambition, the producers don't ignore monumental disasters or the practical and ethical issues raised by our penchant for always building bigger. They dutifully observe that workers, not designers, generally paid the highest costs, and that for many people progress has meant displacement, like the ancient Nubian village that had to make way for the Aswan Dam in Egypt.</p>

        <p>Small wonder the American Society of Civil Engineers has endorsed ''Building Big,'' PBS's five-part documentary series about bridges, domes, skyscrapers, dams and tunnels. These terrific programs trumpet the scientific derring-do of the creators without ignoring their equally compelling quixotic foolhardiness. There's even more bravado and pathos here than in the just-finished Olympics.</p>
        <p>While this series, which begins tonight, is largely a testament to engineering and architectural ingenuity and ambition, the producers don't ignore monumental disasters or the practical and ethical issues raised by our penchant for always building bigger. They dutifully observe that workers, not designers, generally paid the highest costs, and that for many people progress has meant displacement, like the ancient Nubian village that had to make way for the Aswan Dam in Egypt.</p>
        <p>The many interviews include a conversation with the author and environmentalist Marc Reisner, who died in July. He declares: ''I would say that next to nuclear power, dams are the biggest Faustian bargain that mankind has struck with nature. They have allowed us to settle places that couldn't be settled otherwise. They've created an outstanding amount of wealth, of economic wealth. On the other hand they've had terrible environmental impacts.''</p>
        <p>''Building Big'' treats civilization's giant manmade structures ancient and modern as wellsprings of history, politics, religion and psychology. The programs are full of grand themes and exciting images of awesome edifices above and below ground, like the Hoover Dam, the Channel Tunnel connecting Britain and France, the Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur. Yet it shows equal respect for the nuts and bolts, as well as stone and iron and suspension cables.</p>
        <p>In the third episode, about skyscrapers, we learn that by initially bolting together critical parts of the Citicorp Center instead of welding them, to save money, the builders put the 900-foot-tall structure in danger of being blown over by a strong storm. (Scarily, this was remedied at the architect's urging only after construction was completed.) On tonight's program, about bridges, we see the evolution from the stone arches built by the Romans to the thousands of pencil-thin wires wrapped together that hold up the Golden Gate Bridge.</p>
        <p>Don't worry if you can't define ''cantilever'' or distinguish a pylon from a pier. The series has the perfect guide, David Macaulay, author of ''The Way Things Work,'' whose calm voice and deceptively simple drawings can seduce vehement technophobes into minimal understanding of engineering concepts without insulting people who actually know about them. He has taught junior high and high school students and speaks slowly and carefully, as if he's still hoping someone is taking notes.</p>
        <p>When he decides to illustrate something, Mr. Macaulay simply whips out a sketch pad; sometimes he explains while we watch cleverly animated diagrams. These visual aids help viewers begin to comprehend the competing tensions pushing and pulling on apparently inanimate objects and the ways that engineers compensate, so the structures they build won't collapse or blow apart. Looking at drawings of arches with stress arrows coming from all directions, you may find yourself identifying with a bridge or a tunnel.</p>
        <p>Mr. Macaulay's lessons are easy to digest in part because he's usually giving them while perched by some exotic location, having traveled to four continents while making this series. This teacher may look a little fusty, with his bushy mustache and carefully tucked-in shirts, but he is a brave fellow, lugging his sketch pad wherever he thinks he has to go to clarify a point, even to a window-washing platform balanced outside a high floor of the World Trade Center.</p>
        <p>In Episode 2, about domes, we learn that Hadrian, emperor of ancient Rome, rebuilt the Pantheon in the shape of a dome to prove Rome's transcendent authority with the gods. Similarly, in Texas in 1965, Judge Roy Hofheinz (former part owner of the Ringling Brothers and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus) tried the same trick to establish Houston's elevation to the highest spheres of baseball by unveiling the Astrodome, the first indoor stadium. But the skylights in the Astrodome's roof blinded players when they looked up to catch fly balls, so the skylights were painted. With no natural light, the grass inside wilted, and soon Astroturf was born, for better or worse.</p>
        <p>Most engineering disasters have far graver consequences, like the failure of Thomas Bouch to predict accurately how much wind the Tay Bridge could withstand. When it was built across the Firth of Tay north of Edinburgh in 1890, the bridge was the longest in the world. One night a storm blew it over as well as the train that was crossing at the time, killing about 75 people.</p>
        <p>''Building Big'' uses this accident to lure viewers into tonight's program, which also contains the saga of the Brooklyn Bridge, told in 1972 in ''The Great Bridge,'' David McCullough's epic account of an engineering family's obsession. As recounted here with help from Mr. McCullough, the story of the Roeblings remains mesmerizing. In the 14-year course of overseeing the building of this exquisitely beautiful suspension bridge, the father died and the son was overcome with physical and mental illness, so his wife took over supervising fieldwork on the project.</p>
        <p>The series is filled with stories like this, but the human tragedy is always linked to an engineering problem that had to be overcome. Washington Roebling, the son, contracted the bends, or caisson's disease, an unanticipated side effect of the otherwise ingenious system that allowed workers to dig down into the riverbed. The builders needed a hollow airtight structure that would keep the water out while they moved lower.</p>
        <p>Borrowing an idea used in Europe on smaller projects, the Roeblings designed large caissons to be filled with compressed air to counterbalance the pressure of the river's water. As the caissons sank deeper and the air pressure inside them was increased, workers -- including Washington Roebling -- discovered that moving out of compressed air too quickly could lead to excruciating pain in the joints.</p>
        <p>Success and failure are often difficult to distinguish from each other in these remarkable tales of hubris and passion, and concrete and girders. In the tunnels segment, last in the series, Mr. Macaulay tells about Marc Brunel, a 19th-century French inventor and engineer who found inspiration while in debtor's prison, where he passed the time by thinking about a helmet-headed shipworm. The worm was interesting from an engineering standpoint because it tunneled into wood and then secreted a substance that formed a rigid lining behind it, a useful tactic for burrowing into watery mud.</p>
        <p>Brunel mimicked the worm with an invention he called the tunneling shield and won a contract to dig under the Thames in London. After 18 years and much disaster his tunnel was completed, and though the Brunel method was abandoned, it helped lead to the development of urban subway systems.</p>
        <p>That's part of the point here, that one thing does lead to another, often in most unexpected ways. Gustave Eiffel's experiments with wrought iron transformed bridges and then skyscrapers. The arches under Roman aqueducts and bridges would show up later in domes and tunnels. While the mechanics of construction and natural disasters have become staples on cable television, ''Building Big'' has reached for something, well, bigger, and found surprising connections -- like the link between the Pantheon and Astroturf -- in the nuts and bolts of civilization.</p>

        <p>TELEVISION REVIEW  Correction:  October 28, 2000, Saturday  A television review on Oct. 3 about ''Building Big,'' a five-part PBS documentary about feats of architecture and engineering, misstated the year in which an ill-fated bridge, then the world's longest, was built across the Firth of Tay in Scotland. It was completed in 1877, not 1890. A picture caption with the review misidentified the bridge shown and the date of the scene. It was a recent photograph of the Firth of Forth bridge, also discussed in the documentary, not an 1890 view of the Firth of Tay bridge. A correction prepared on Oct. 3 went astray at The Times.</p>
