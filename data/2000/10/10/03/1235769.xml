        <p>Brookhaven National Laboratory is slated to receive $170 million in federal money, including $5 million for an accelerated cleanup of environmental hazards, under a bill approved by the Senate today. The money is expected to allow the lab to take on additional projects.</p>
        <p>The federal laboratory, in Upton, is to receive $100 million for projects using its relativistic heavy-ion collider, which smashes together the nuclei of very heavy atoms at nearly the speed of light. An additional $35 million would support the spallation neutron source, which generates neutrons without using nuclear reactors. The national synchrotron light source, a powerful X-ray used to examine molecules, is to receive $3 million and an additional 12 employees. The remaining money would go toward other projects.</p>

        <p>Brookhaven National Laboratory is slated to receive $170 million in federal money, including $5 million for an accelerated cleanup of environmental hazards, under a bill approved by the Senate today. The money is expected to allow the lab to take on additional projects.</p>
        <p>The federal laboratory, in Upton, is to receive $100 million for projects using its relativistic heavy-ion collider, which smashes together the nuclei of very heavy atoms at nearly the speed of light. An additional $35 million would support the spallation neutron source, which generates neutrons without using nuclear reactors. The national synchrotron light source, a powerful X-ray used to examine molecules, is to receive $3 million and an additional 12 employees. The remaining money would go toward other projects.</p>
        <p>The lab has come under fire in recent years for contaminating soil and ground water on the 5,300-acre property, which has been a federal Superfund site since 1989. In 1996, lab officials announced that radioactive tritium had been leaking from the lab's high-flux beam reactor into the ground water. The government later dismissed the contractor that had run the lab for 50 years.</p>
        <p>Senator Charles E. Schumer, the Brooklyn Democrat, sponsored the bill in the Senate. ''I see bringing Brookhaven back as one of my high priorities,'' Mr. Schumer said in a phone interview, ''not only for Long Island but for all of New York, and I think this year's budget really begins us on that track.</p>
        <p>''As Long Island's economy moves into a high-tech mode, there's an understanding of the huge ancillary benefit that scientific research brings. Look, there are still some people who are opposed to one thing or another, but overall the tone between town and gown, if you will, is much, much improved.''</p>
        <p>But one group opposed to nuclear research has raised concerns about the new money for the cleanup. Scott Cullen, a lawyer for the Standing for Truth About Radiation Foundation, based in East Hampton, said he was worried about how the money would be allocated.</p>
        <p>The group is also concerned about the company handling the cleanup, the Bechtel Corporation. ''At other places where they did it quicker, they also did it dirtier,'' Mr. Cullen said.</p>
        <p>The director of the lab, John Marburger, said Bechtel was responsible for managing the cleanup and would subcontract some of the work. ''It is not the case that this money will simply go to Bechtel,'' he said. ''This money actually will pay for cleanup activities that will accelerate the cleanup. We are not giving up our responsibility or our control with this arrangement.''</p>
        <p>The House passed the bill on Friday, and President Clinton is expected to sign it.</p>
