        <p>The Mets and Yankees may both be playing playoff games this Saturday in New York City, something that's never happened before in the same city on the same day in major league baseball. The only problem is that at this point, it's not clear whether the Yankees would be playing early in the afternoon or in the evening or if the Mets would be playing early in the afternoon, late in the afternoon or in the evening.</p>
        <p>And it's not much better on Sunday, when the Yankees would be playing a deciding Game 5, if necessary, at 8 p.m. Eastern time in Oakland, but Mets fans don't yet know if their team would be playing a Game 4 at 4:07 p.m. or 8 p.m.</p>

        <p>The Mets and Yankees may both be playing playoff games this Saturday in New York City, something that's never happened before in the same city on the same day in major league baseball. The only problem is that at this point, it's not clear whether the Yankees would be playing early in the afternoon or in the evening or if the Mets would be playing early in the afternoon, late in the afternoon or in the evening.</p>
        <p>And it's not much better on Sunday, when the Yankees would be playing a deciding Game 5, if necessary, at 8 p.m. Eastern time in Oakland, but Mets fans don't yet know if their team would be playing a Game 4 at 4:07 p.m. or 8 p.m.</p>
        <p>The reason for all the hedging is the desires of the three networks showing the division series -- ESPN, NBC and Fox -- to get a preferable TV lineup and not get caught short if some of the series end in three-game sweeps.</p>
        <p>So under a revised first-round schedule released last night, Mets fans are being informed that Game 3 against the San Francisco Giants -- which will be the Mets' first, and only guaranteed, home game in the postseason -- will begin at either 1:07 p.m. or 4:18 p.m. or 7:38 p.m.</p>
        <p>It will be a 1:07 game if the Yankees and Oakland A's, and Chicago White Sox and Seattle Mariners, are all tied, 1-1, after the first two games of their respective division series. It will be a 4:18 game if the A's and Yanks are tied, 1-1, but the White Sox-Mariners series has ended in a three-game sweep on Friday evening. And it will be a 7:38 game if either the A's or the Yankees win the first two games of their matchup. Got that?</p>
        <p>Sunday at Shea is not guaranteed, because if either the Giants or the Mets sweep, there won't be a Game 4. But if there is, it will be at 4:07 if the A's-Yankees series is over, and 8 p.m. if it's not.</p>
        <p>It's not as confusing for Yankee fans. Their team is locked in for Game 3 -- 8:08 p.m. Friday at Yankee Stadium. Game 4, if necessary, will be 1:07 p.m. if either the A's or the Yanks jump out to a 2-0 lead in the series, and 7:38 p.m. if neither team does.</p>
        <p>Play ball -- but don't make any plans yet.</p>
