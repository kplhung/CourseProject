        <p>Last year, Gov. George E. Pataki announced that an $85 million retail, office and hotel complex called Harlem Center would be built on state-owned land at Harlem's crossroads, 125th Street between Malcolm X and Adam Clayton Powell Boulevards.</p>
        <p>Construction of the first phase of the project, the retail component, may begin before the end of the year. Last week, state officials approved plans for 130,000 square feet of space that will include several national tenants: a Gap, a Bally's Total Fitness Center, a CVS drugstore and a Circuit City electronics store.</p>

        <p>Last year, Gov. George E. Pataki announced that an $85 million retail, office and hotel complex called Harlem Center would be built on state-owned land at Harlem's crossroads, 125th Street between Malcolm X and Adam Clayton Powell Boulevards.</p>
        <p>Construction of the first phase of the project, the retail component, may begin before the end of the year. Last week, state officials approved plans for 130,000 square feet of space that will include several national tenants: a Gap, a Bally's Total Fitness Center, a CVS drugstore and a Circuit City electronics store.</p>
        <p>The $37.4 million first-phase plan also includes $3 million to build the infrastructure for a 10-story tower that could contain office space, a hotel or both. Sandeep Mathrani, the executive vice president of Forest City Ratner, a developer of Harlem Center, said that two private companies had recently expressed interest in leasing office space at the site.</p>
        <p>But several other people involved in the project said that the commercial market in Harlem was lagging behind the retail boom in other parts of Manhattan.</p>
        <p>So far, these sources say, private companies have been unwilling to lease new space in Harlem for what the developers intend to charge: an annual rent of $35 to $40 a square foot. In August, the asking rent for office space downtown was $42.73.</p>
