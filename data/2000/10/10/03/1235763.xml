        <p>ASM Lithography Holding a Netherlands-based company that makes equipment used to fabricate integrated circuits, agreed to buy the Silicon Valley Group, a rival based in San Jose, Calif., in a stock deal valued at 1.8 billion euros, or $1.6 billion, the companies said yesterday. Silicon Valley's stock rose $7.38, or 28 percent, to close at $33.69. The acquisition will create the largest maker of lithography equipment used by semiconductor manufacturers in the world, the companies said. ASM had sales of $1.3 billion in 1999 and said the acquisition would immediately increase its earnings per share, but its stock fell $2.44, or 7.5 percent, to $29.88.</p>
