        <p>The Microsoft Corporation asked a federal appeals court today to allow more than five months for the filing of documents in the appeal of the antitrust ruling against the company, and to permit a brief four times as long as usual.</p>

        <p>The Microsoft Corporation asked a federal appeals court today to allow more than five months for the filing of documents in the appeal of the antitrust ruling against the company, and to permit a brief four times as long as usual.</p>
        <p>Microsoft's appeal would run 56,000 words -- half the length of an average book, or the equivalent of a dozen or more newspaper pages without headlines or pictures. All of this is needed, the company's lawyers told the court, because ''the scope of the case is monumental.''</p>
        <p>Their legal brief noted that the Justice Department opposed both ideas, and the appeals court has made plain that it wants to hear the case on an accelerated basis. In a statement tonight, the Justice Department said, ''Microsoft's proposal would unnecessarily delay proceedings and postpone resolution of the appeal.''</p>
        <p>The Justice Department has until Thursday to file its own scheduling proposal, and Microsoft will be given a chance to reply to it next Tuesday. After that, the appeals court will set a schedule.</p>
        <p>In the spring, United States District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson found Microsoft in violation of the nation's antitrust laws, and he certified the government's request to send the case directly to the Supreme Court, bypassing the appeals court. But last Tuesday, the Supreme Court declined to accept the case, sending it back to the appeals court, which asked both sides to propose a briefing schedule.</p>
        <p>In June, the appeals court said that ''in view of its exceptional importance,'' the matter would be heard by the full 10-member court, except for three judges who had recused themselves. Usually, appeals are heard, at least initially, by a three-judge panel.</p>
        <p>In its filing today, Microsoft said the normal limit on appeals briefs, 14,000 words, was ''insufficient for a case of this magnitude and complexity, in which Microsoft's very corporate survival is at stake.'' Under the company's proposal, the Justice Department would also be allowed to file 56,000 words.</p>
        <p>The brief reiterated many of the assertions that Microsoft offered earlier this year.</p>
        <p>''The district court's decision was infected by a multitude of serious substantive and procedural errors,'' the company said. And it quoted Judge Jackson saying at an antitrust conference in Washington last week, ''Virtually everything I did may be vulnerable on appeal.''</p>
        <p>For Microsoft, a protracted appeal is a two-edged sword. A lengthy process would delay any move to break up the company, should Judge Jackson's order in June be upheld. But the company's stock price may languish as long as there is uncertainty. Today, Microsoft touched a 52-week low of $58.25 in intraday trading, and closed at $59.13, down $1.19.</p>
