        <p>Prosecutors argued yesterday that a miserable marriage, ending in a flashpoint of rage, led a plastic surgeon to kill his wife 15 years ago and dump her body from an airplane.  Defense lawyers called this just a theory -- no better or worse than any other -- to explain the disappearance of the doctor's wife, whose body has never been found.</p>
        <p>The murder trial of the surgeon, Dr. Robert Bierenbaum, began yesterday in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, with both sides recounting in brief opening statements the turbulent marriage of Dr. Bierenbaum and Gail Katz-Bierenbaum. The defense and prosecutors also gave their explanations for the doctor's apparent omissions in July 1985, when he reported his wife's disappearance to the police, and conflicting statements that he made in the years after.</p>
        <p>The case, which languished until Dr. Bierenbaum's arrest last year, has developed through remarkable new leads and has led to legal controversy. In 1983, three psychiatrists  warned Ms. Katz-Bierenbaum that her husband was homicidal, but a judge ruled last month that they cannot testify because of patient confidentiality. Dr. Bierenbaum flew his small airplane over the Atlantic Ocean on the day his wife disappeared, but failed to tell the police. Past acts of domestic violence, including when he tried to drown her cat in the toilet, according to court papers, will be part of the trial. Cat lovers were excluded from the jury.</p>
        <p>But there is little traditional crime-scene evidence, as Steven Saracco, an assistant district attorney, told the jury yesterday -- ''no body, no forensics, no murder weapon, no bloody clothes, no fingerprints, no brain matter, no body parts.''</p>
        <p>There was a motive though, he said. The weekend Ms. Katz-Bierenbaum, 29, disappeared, conditions in the nearly three-year marriage had become ''explosive,'' and she was going to tell her husband that she was leaving for good. That was a terrible affront, Mr. Saracco said, particularly given the doctor's ''controlling nature.'' While it was her intention ''to leave her husband,'' Mr. Saracco told jurors quietly, ''it was not her intention to drop off the face of the earth.'' He repeated the last part of this phrase four times in the course of his opening statement.</p>
        <p>Dr. Bierenbaum, 45, sat quietly, scribbling on a legal pad as his second wife, Dr. Janet Chollet, an obstetrician, sat in the front row of the courtroom. The couple live in North Dakota and have a young daughter.</p>
        <p>In his 15-minute opening statement, a defense lawyer, David Lewis, argued that Ms. Katz-Bierenbaum was probably dead, but not at Dr. Bierenbaum's hands. Mr. Lewis said it was her ''risky behavior'' with a bad crowd -- including extramarital affairs with lovers who used drugs -- that led her to wander off from the couple's Upper East Side apartment  to Central Park on the morning of July 7, 1985, never to return home.</p>
        <p>''This was a lousy marriage,'' Mr. Lewis said. ''He has a temper; she was not a loyal, wonderful person.''  But he said there was no flash point; she threatened to leave all the time, he said, and on the day in question, she left the apartment alive.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lewis said that a man named Joel Davis, who had never met her, would testify that he saw her alive in an Upper East Side bagel store between 1 and 3 p.m. that day, and went to the police with this information after learning of her disappearance.</p>
        <p>Dr. Bierenbaum did not tell the police of his two-hour flight on the day she vanished, Mr. Lewis explained, because after learning of the police's suspicions, he stopped sharing information with them.</p>
        <p>Two witnesses testified about past violence in the marriage and Dr. Bierenbaum's failure to disclose the flight. But in Mr. Saracco's opening statement, he asked why Ms. Katz-Bierenbaum would have left home without her wallet, keys, checkbook or medications.</p>
        <p>The prosecutor said Dr. Bierenbaum killed his wife, carried her body from the apartment in a duffel bag, put it in the trunk of his father's Cadillac and drove to the Essex County Airport in Fairfield, N.J.  From there, he flew his Cessna 172 airplane over the Atlantic and tossed  his wife's body into the sea, ''where it remains to this day,'' he said.</p>
        <p>While Dr. Bierenbaum had also reported to the police that his wife had been suicidal, her psychiatrist will testify that she had no desire to harm herself, Mr. Saracco said.  Rather, she was ''looking forward to a life without him,'' he said.</p>
