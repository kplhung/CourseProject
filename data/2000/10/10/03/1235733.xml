        <p>The Yankees' distinct tradition is strangely blurred as they prepare for the first two games of the American League division series, where they will reveal themselves as fading champions caught in a horrible and irreversible slump, or as a team with extraordinary mental toughness.</p>
        <p>The Yankees were beaten in their last seven games of the regular season, the longest losing streak for any team entering the playoffs, and they will either break out or be broken in a three-of-five-game series with the dynamic, talented and inexperienced Oakland Athletics. ''You've got to wipe it away,'' Chuck Knoblauch said, referring to the late-season collapse, before adding, ''This is not something you can just flip on.''</p>
        <p>Knoblauch will start at designated hitter, rather than at second base, in Game 1 Tuesday, and the Yankees' Roger Clemens will pitch against Oakland's Gil Heredia, with the first pitch scheduled for 8:08 p.m. Eastern time.</p>
        <p>The Yankees lost 15 of their last 18 regular-season games, and they are the first team in major league history to enter the postseason with fewer than 5 victories in their last 15 games of the regular season. But their roster is stacked with veterans who have coped with and conquered adversity. The right-handed pitcher David Cone, who went 4-14 with a 6.91 earned run average during a miserable regular season, walked into the Yankees' clubhouse after Sunday's finale in Baltimore and said aloud, ''I don't have a 6 E.R.A. anymore.''</p>
        <p>The message in Cone's words was apparent to all who heard. ''I hope everybody heard it,'' Knoblauch said. ''That was perfect.''</p>
        <p>The postseason gives all of them a chance to start anew. Paul O'Neill might have struggled for hits in late September after hurting his hip, but all of that will be forgotten if he contributes to victories in the days ahead. Cone can find some redemption if he helps in middle relief. If Clemens and Andy Pettitte -- the latter will start Game 2 on Wednesday -- throw well and the Yankees win, all the bad feelings built up in the late season will go away.</p>
        <p>But the Yankees are not under the illusion that this will automatically happen, just because they have won three championships in four years. The losing streak shook them as nothing else has in Joe Torre's tenure as the manager. ''With the experience of postseason, guys will know what it takes to win and that will help,'' Knoblauch said. ''But you can't just turn it on, like a switch. I don't think so, at least not for me. That scares me a bit. If we could've, we would've done it in the middle of last week.''</p>
        <p>Luis Sojo will start at second base and bat eighth, and Knoblauch will be the designated hitter. Torre had hoped that one of his offensive-minded players -- Jose Canseco, Glenallen Hill or Luis Polonia -- would get hot and seize the designated hitter's job going into the playoffs. But that didn't happen, and given Knoblauch's throwing jitters, the second-best option for Torre was to insert Sojo, a contact hitter who always puts the ball in play, to avoid some of the strikeouts and double-play grounders that occur when Canseco starts.</p>
        <p>The other part of Torre's decision, he acknowledged, was Knoblauch's defensive problems. The second baseman's throwing jitters appear to have had an effect on almost everything he does, from fielding grounders up the middle to turning double plays. This afternoon, Torre told Knoblauch of his decision. ''It's not a shock or anything,'' Knoblauch said.</p>
        <p>Torre said, ''I'm thinking in terms of contact, making things happen offensively, and hopefully we can do that.''</p>
        <p>Sojo gets the start, but with a deep bench that includes the sluggers and at least two other utilitymen, Torre could make many changes in that one spot in the lineup during the game. Suppose Sojo were due to hit with the bases loaded in the third inning, and Torre felt he had a chance to break the game open; he might want to use Hill as a pinch-hitter, and replace Sojo with Jose Vizcaino.</p>
        <p>The Yankees and Athletics share the same business, and beyond that, they are completely different. The Yankees are big market, big money, big star, big success, a world championship flag flapping over their park. The Athletics are small market, too little money, their stars mostly known locally, and an award from a baseball magazine is prominently displayed on their right-field wall: Organization of the Year 1998 1999. The Yankees are the giant studio that wins Oscars; the Athletics are the independent company with an understated excellence.</p>
        <p>And the Athletics, unlike the Yankees, go into the playoffs full of good thoughts. They won 8 of their last 10 games of the regular season, overtook the Seattle Mariners and won the American League West for the first time since 1992. After beating Texas to clinch the division Sunday, the Athletics enjoyed a raucous celebration that lasted well into the evening -- certainly longer than the 15 minutes of handshakes and sips of Champagne shared by the Yankees after they clinched the A.L. East in the middle of their losing streak.</p>
        <p>The Athletics' adrenaline could work for them, or their adrenaline could work against them. Jason Isringhausen, the Oakland closer, could be overpowering, or overwhelmed by his nerves.</p>
        <p>The 24-year-old shortstop Miguel Tejada, who bats behind the slugger Jason Giambi in the Oakland lineup, will probably have many chances to hit with runners in scoring position in this series; will he be calm and swing steadily at pitches in the strike zone, or will the Yankees' veteran starters entice him to hack wildly at bad pitches -- the way they were able to do with the Rangers' Juan Gonzalez and Ivan Rodriguez the last two years?</p>
        <p>There's no way to tell, no way to know how Tejada or the Athletics' other youngsters will react to pressure, just as the Yankees did not know, in 1996, how Pettitte or Derek Jeter or Mariano Rivera would respond. ''If experience was a big factor,'' Oakland Manager Art Howe said, ''then we wouldn't be here.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees' players have 46 World Series championship rings among them, the Athletics none. But Oakland goes into the playoffs as one of the hottest teams in baseball, and the Yankees, in spite of their storied history, enter as a club deeply flawed in the last days of the season.</p>
