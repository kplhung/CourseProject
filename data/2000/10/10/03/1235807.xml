        <p>Boubacar Traore  Joe's Pub</p>
        <p>Boubacar Traore, the Malian singer and guitarist who performed on Thursday night, could give austerity lessons to Minimalists. Mr. Traore played an entire set of songs in the same key, each built around just two or three vocal phrases and a handful of guitar licks.

        <p>Boubacar Traore  Joe's Pub</p>
        <p>Boubacar Traore, the Malian singer and guitarist who performed on Thursday night, could give austerity lessons to Minimalists. Mr. Traore played an entire set of songs in the same key, each built around just two or three vocal phrases and a handful of guitar licks. The only accompaniment came from Sidibi Camara tapping a calabash with sticks and thumping it with the heel of his hand.</p>
        <p>But the songs conveyed neither renunciation nor scarcity. Mr. Traore made their self-imposed limits into a universe: a place to dance, to lament, to make his guitar tickle and bite. His voice had a kindly tone with a mournful undercurrent as he sang about a lost love or friends he left behind. And his intricate guitar parts, mostly played with thumb and forefinger, could turn a two-chord vamp into a three-dimensional matrix of bass lines, upper-register replies, melodies shared with the voice, obstinate trills and high, light offbeats, with the calabash clicking along.</p>
        <p>Most songs ended with long fade-outs, achieved without a volume knob, in which rhythms, vocal lines and guitar parts let their inner workings glimmer before disappearing into silence.</p>
        <p>It's not naive music. In the 1960's  Mr. Traore had a rock hit in Mali,  ''The Mali Twist,'' then turned to day jobs and an expatriate's life in Paris. When he was rediscovered in the late 1980's he had created a different hybrid music. He reached back to traditional music from Kayes, in the Khassonke region of northwestern Mali, where he was born; he was also aware of the blues, another style that makes bare-bones structures eloquent.</p>
        <p>At Joe's Pub, a few of Mr. Traore's songs used spiky blues licks and tempos as deliberate as slow Delta blues; one from his new album, ''Macire'' (Harmonia Mundi), toyed with flamenco guitar lines and quasi-Moorish modal scales. The others, with sharp, staccato picking, made the guitar sound closer to traditional West African harps and balafons (marimbas). The music was swinging and hypnotic, doleful and soothing, rooted and personal, as it transmuted basic elements into profound incantations.</p>
