        <p>Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel said on Monday that peace talks were now ''on the shelf'' and Yasir Arafat called for an emergency Arab summit meeting as violence tore through Israel and the Palestinian territories for the fifth straight day.</p>
        <p>As President Clinton and other foreign leaders called for a halt to the violence, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright announced that she would meet with Mr. Barak and Mr. Arafat in Paris on Wednesday to search for a way out of the bloodletting.</p>
        <p>''The two sides must find a way to end the current psychology of confrontation and begin to restore the psychology of peacemaking,'' Dr. Albright said in a statement.</p>
        <p>After fighting continued into the night on Monday, Israeli and Palestinian radio both reported early today that an agreement had been reached by Israel and the Palestinian Authority to halt the violence. Earlier reported cease-fire agreements between the two have failed to check the confrontations, however.</p>
        <p>The Israeli Army pledged on Monday to show restraint, and Mr. Arafat, the Palestinian leader, is reported to have ordered his security chiefs to end the confrontations.</p>
        <p>But the explosive street fighting raged on throughout the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and Arab towns within Israel on Monday, leaving at least 15 more people dead and scores severely wounded.</p>
        <p>''What we are seeing today is the glorious alternative to peace,'' said Shimon Peres, the Israeli minister of regional cooperation and former prime minister from the Labor Party.</p>
        <p>Since Thursday, when a defiant visit by Israel's right-wing opposition leader to the most sacred Islamic site in Jerusalem ignited Palestinian protests throughout the territories and in Israel itself, at least 48 people have been killed.</p>
        <p>Most have died in rock-throwing skirmishes with Israeli soldiers, who on Monday used anti-tank missiles and helicopter gunships on Palestinian rioters.</p>
        <p>The Clinton administration proposed a joint inquest into the disturbances, an initiative that Palestinian and Israeli leaders tentatively embraced.</p>
        <p>''This process is designed to understand what went wrong and to see how both parties can ensure that the Palestinian and Israeli people not relive the terrible events of the last few days,'' said a statement on Monday from the White House.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Barak, asserting that Palestinian police attacks on Israeli troops were a ''gross violation'' of earlier peace accords, said he would not renew substantive negotiations with the Palestinians until the violence ceased.</p>
        <p>''This effort, which began before the intifada and continued with Madrid, and then Oslo and Wye and the discussions of the past year, is currently placed on the shelf until this confrontation is over,'' he said, referring to the Palestinian uprising against the Israelis and the sites of peace negotiations.</p>
        <p>On Monday the confrontation showed no signs of abating. Five Arabs were killed in clashes with the police inside Israel, the Israeli authorities said, and another three Israeli Arabs died from injuries they suffered in confrontations on Sunday.</p>
        <p>And Palestinian officials said five people were killed in scattered clashes in the West Bank. Their tally did not include an Israeli motorist who was killed by a sniper near a Jewish settlement on the West Bank. Nor did it include an Israeli soldier who was killed by another West Bank sniper.</p>
        <p>The Israeli police ordered settlers to stay home on Monday after many reports of Palestinian attacks on Israeli travelers in the area.</p>
        <p>The fighting also claimed another three Palestinian lives at the Netzarim junction, the same Gaza Strip crossroads where two people were killed on Saturday, including a 12-year-old boy who has been embraced by Palestinians as a symbol of the conflict.</p>
        <p>In one of the fiercest battles to date, hundreds of youths attacked the Israeli Army outpost there with rocks and gasoline bombs, prompting a counterattack of automatic weapons fire and armor-piercing missiles launched from a hovering Israeli helicopter.</p>
        <p>Palestinian policemen who at first tried to restrain the rioters later joined in the fighting, witnesses said, firing rifles in an exchange with Israeli sharpshooters that left one of the Palestinian officers dead.</p>
        <p>The Israeli opposition leader Ariel Sharon, who is accused of igniting the latest violence by leading a delegation from his Likud Party onto the plaza outside the Dome of the Rock, a major Muslim monument, has been roundly criticized by opponents at home and abroad. But the controversy may have solidified his hold on the hard right here.</p>
        <p>In one of the milder comments by foreign diplomats, Dr. Albright on Monday termed the visit ''definitely counterproductive.''</p>
        <p>A Likud member of Parliament, Limor Livnat, criticized Dr. Albright's critique as an example of ''gross chutzpah on her part, and on the part of the American administration,'' and Mr. Sharon sent Dr. Albright a formal letter of complaint.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak, pointedly dissociating himself from the criticism of Mr. Sharon, said the riots and clashes of the last five days were not a result of his visit but rather an orchestrated negotiation ploy by Palestinian leaders.</p>
        <p>Israeli diplomats and security officials assert that Mr. Arafat's lieutenants were stockpiling ammunition and planning for violent clashes for weeks beforehand, in part as a release for internal frustration at the continued postponement of long-promised Palestinian statehood.</p>
        <p>Yet if that were true, several Israeli commentators asked on Monday, why did the Israeli government permit a visit that would provide a perfect pretext for ostensibly spontaneous violence?</p>
        <p>Internationally, Israel seemed suddenly on the defensive. European leaders blamed not only Mr. Sharon for the violence, but also what they considered to be excessive military force in response to the rioting.</p>
        <p>Israeli diplomats acknowledged that they were concerned over the abrupt turnaround in how they were being viewed after what they say was two months of sustained international pressure on Mr. Arafat to strike a compromise based on Mr. Barak's far-reaching concessions at the Camp David summit meeting in July.</p>
        <p>''Arafat has tried for some months to regain the support of world public opinion, including that of the United States and the European states,'' Ron Ben Yishai wrote on Monday in Yediot Ahronot, Israel's largest-circulation newspaper. ''Ariel Sharon provided him with the opportunity, and he, Arafat, will exploit it to the hilt.''</p>
        <p>Condemnation of Mr. Sharon's visit and the Israeli military's storming of the packed plaza during prayers there on Friday has also united and energized the Arab world.</p>
        <p>President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, making his first official trip abroad as head of state, met in Cairo on Monday with President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, and the two men demanded an immediate Israeli withdrawal from the conflict zones.</p>
        <p>They called on their fellow Arab leaders to convene a regional summit conference to address the crisis, a proposal quickly seconded by Mr. Arafat and King Abdullah II of Jordan, who were conferring in Amman, and by the United Arab Emirates. It would be the first such gathering in four years.</p>
        <p>The Persian Gulf countries in the six-member Gulf Cooperation Council condemned what they called ''Israeli massacres against the Palestinian people.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Arafat and King Abdullah also called on Israel ''to pull out its forces to lines determined by previous agreements'' -- a reference to the final Israeli troop redeployments envisioned by earlier provisional peace pacts.</p>
        <p>A huge Israeli security presence in Jerusalem's Old City on Monday, combined with a protest strike by Palestinian shopkeepers there, kept the site of the center of the dispute unusually calm. At the great cubic stone structure that Muslims call Haram al Sharif and Jews know as the Temple Mount, heavily armed police officers in riot gear stopped tourists and other visitors from ascending to the plaza of the ancient mosques.</p>
        <p>At noon, as Orthodox Jews prayed at the Western Wall at the base of the mount, a minaret directly above broadcast mournful prayers from the Koran for the dead of the last five days.</p>
        <p>''I would like there to be peace,'' said an Israeli Arab museum guard taking in the scene from a distance, ''but I am worried that we are going to have war.''</p>
