        <p>George W. Bush is really psyched for tonight. ''I view this as a chance for people to get an impression of me on a stage debating my opponent,'' said the Republican nominee, summarizing the situation as only he can. His advisers have been very busy lowering expectations, and have pretty much convinced the nation that Mr. Bush will be the winner if he avoids referring to tariffs and barriers as ''terriers'' again.</p>
        <p>Al Gore spent the weekend at a shark research station in Florida, where he was holed up with a heroic firefighter, a spunky senior citizen, a sturdy steelworker and 10 other ordinary Americans. Debate prep was briefly interrupted when the group tried to vote Mr. Gore off the island.</p>
        <p>This is big, people, very big. Tonight we get answers to important questions regarding taxes, health care and whether a genetically enhanced human prototype can find happiness in a post-apocalyptic America.</p>
        <p>Correction. The prototype issue will be addressed only on the Fox Network, which has refused to pre-empt its new series ''Dark Angel'' to make way for the debate. Fox apparently felt that the show's debut could not be postponed because young viewers, well known for their inflexible adherence to routine, had already put it down on their calendars.</p>
        <p>The network has, however, decided to make amends by offering Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore an hour of free air time to respond to the question ''Why should Americans vote for you?'' Extra credit will be given for originality, creative use of props and any reference to the critical problems facing genetically enhanced prototypes.</p>
        <p>Those of you not planning to be distracted by ''Dark Angel'' or the baseball thing may be interested to know that some experts believe the debate preparation has actually been too intense. ''If I had to do it again, I would not go through as much of that rehearsal stuff. I think it kind of took away my spontaneity,'' said Michael Dukakis, the 1988 Democratic nominee, whose innate effervescence is legendary.</p>
        <p>Despite assurances that the public is finally getting really, really interested in this race, we are a little worried that your attention has faltered since the conventions, what with all those synchronized swimmers and beach volleyball playoffs. This is what's been going on:</p>
        <p>Aug. 19 -- The new, improved, populist Al Gore rockets out of the convention promising to fight for ''working families.''</p>
        <p>Aug. 24 -- Acknowledging that she claimed to be suffering a mental condition when she applied for workman's compensation in 1996, Pat Buchanan's Reform ticket running mate, Ezola Foster, announces, ''I am perfectly sane.''</p>
        <p>Aug. 31 -- In an attempt to support Mr. Bush's assaults on the ''Washington one-size-fits-all mentality,'' Dick Cheney loyally begins decrying the mentality of ''Washington knows all, one size fits best.''</p>
        <p>Sept. 6 -- Having done all he could for the working class, Mr. Gore announces he's fighting for ''middle class families.''</p>
        <p>Sept. 12 -- Green Party presidential candidate Ralph Nader visits the Jay Leno show. When Mr. Leno asks what Mr. Nader does for fun, he answers, ''Strawberries.''</p>
        <p>Sept. 7 -- Mr. Bush, the ex-Compassionate Conservative formerly known as the Reformer With Results, reintroduces himself as the man with ''Real Plans for Real People.''</p>
        <p>Sept. 18 -- Arguing that Mr. Gore had gotten a ''pass'' from the media, Karen Hughes, a Bush spokeswoman, cites instances in which her man would have gotten criticized ''had the shoes been reversed.''</p>
        <p>Sept. 26 -- In a glimpse of presidential races past, Bob Dole is inducted into the Department of Agriculture Hall of Fame, along with Smokey Bear and George Washington Carver. Extolled Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman: ''Bob, you are the only one of these inductees who is alive and not a bear.''</p>
        <p>Sept. 27 -- In a TV interview, Bill Bradley is asked if Al Gore is ''trustworthy'' and responds, ''I think that there is no question that he would be a better president.''</p>
        <p>Oct. 1 -- Goth rocker Marilyn Manson announces he is leaning toward supporting George W. Bush. Republicans attempt to determine if they can coax Eminem to come out for Mr. Gore.</p>
