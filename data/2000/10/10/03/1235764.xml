Project Software, which is based in Bedford, Mass., and whose clients include companies like General Motors and Eli Lilly, said it expected earnings to be less than the 16 cents a share forecast by financial analysts, and substantially less than the 22 cents a share the company earned in the period a year earlier. The company said reduced demand for its products in Asia had hurt sales.</p>
