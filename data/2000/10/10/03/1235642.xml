        <p>A 4,300-year-old tomb excavated this summer at the site of an ancient city in Syria has the discovering archaeologists excited but deeply puzzled. The arrangement of the bodies, accompanied by gold, bronze and ceramic grave goods, seems to defy ready explanation.</p>
        <p>The archaeologists found the bodies laid out on three levels. On the top were the skeletons of two young women, each with a baby at her side. The women were richly adorned head to toe in pendants, bracelets and other jewelry of gold, silver and lapis lazuli.</p>
        <p>Below were two adult men, the older one crowned with a silver diadem, among other accouterments, and the young one holding a bronze dagger; the remains of another baby were off to their side.</p>
        <p>The lowest level held a man, probably 60 years old at death, with a silver cup and silver pins.</p>
        <p>The discoverers, from Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore and the University of Amsterdam, said they could only speculate on who the occupants of the tomb were and the significance of their burial in the society of one of the world's earliest urban civilizations. They said in interviews last week that the find was remarkable as the oldest unplundered elite tomb to be found in Syria.</p>
        <p>The tomb promises to provide new insights into a little-known urban culture that prospered at the same time Sargon of Akkad was creating the world's first empire, based in Mesopotamia (modern Iraq) and the pharaohs were in the later stages of their pyramid building boom in Egypt.</p>
        <p>In a report to be published in the December issue of the British journal Antiquity, the American-Dutch discovery team said that given the rich grave goods and the tomb's central location in the city ruins, ''it seems likely that some or all of the individuals were of high social status, perhaps even members of the local ruling family.''</p>
        <p>But why were the richest ornaments reserved for the two women who died in their 20's? Could they have been princesses, or human sacrifices? Is it significant, or a coincidence, that each was accompanied by a baby at her knee?</p>
        <p>''This pattern,'' the archaeologists said, ''may hint at ritual peculiarities rather than a tomb simply reserved for elite individuals.''</p>
        <p>The leader of the archaeological team, Dr. Glenn M. Schwartz of Johns Hopkins, speculated in an interview that the women could have been members of the elite and the men their attendants sacrificed as part of the funeral ritual, a practice known to have existed in contemporary Mesopotamia. He also wondered if the similar ages of the women and the presence of infants could explain the circumstances of their deaths.</p>
        <p>The tomb was excavated at a site known as Umm el-Marra, 30 miles east of the modern city of Aleppo and 200 miles northeast of Damascus. The ruins are thought to be those of the ancient city of Tuba, one of Syria's first urban centers, where Dr. Schwartz and Dr. Hans H. Curvers, a University of Amsterdam archaeologist, have been working since 1994. Another author of the discovery report is Barbara Stuart, a researcher associated with the Beirut Archaeological Center in Lebanon, who analyzed the skeletons.</p>
        <p>Although scholars have long known of Mesopotamia and Egypt as places where city-dwelling, craft specialization and writing first developed, Syria's contributions were not suspected until Italian archaeologists discovered an ancient royal archive in the ruins of Ebla, also near Aleppo. Their excavations in the 1970's uncovered a library with 17,000 clay tablets inscribed with texts of a large, literate society in the middle of the third millennium B.C.</p>
        <p>Subsequent research has determined that this early civilization, a collection of city-states apparently more or less under Ebla's dominance, emerged between 2600 and 2500 and collapsed between 2200 and 2000. Then the culture somehow revived itself and flourished until about 1600 B.C. In recent explorations, archaeologists have reached beyond Ebla in search of the civilization's lesser cities, like Tuba. They have also gathered and examined artifacts from all social strata, not just the rulers at Ebla.</p>
        <p>By studying the early Syrian civilization and comparing it with the better-know Egyptian and Mesopotamian ones, Dr. Schwartz said, ''we can learn more about the different ways urban societies developed, why they developed when and how they did and how they differed from each other.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Harvey Weiss, a Yale archaeologist who works in Syria but is not involved in the discovery, said the new findings and other research at Umm el-Marra ''contributed emphatically to the perception and body of data indicating that in the late third millennium B.C., the accumulation of agricultural wealth had spread into northern and western Syria, and these regions were independently generating very wealthy and highly stratified societies.''</p>
        <p>Research at Tell Leilan in northern Syria has convinced Dr. Weiss that a long, harsh drought caused the collapse of once-vibrant urban cultures in Mesopotamia and Syria, beginning about 2200 B.C.</p>
        <p>For several years, excavations at Umm el-Marra had concentrated on the more accessible upper layers, ruins of a city that existed around 1800 B.C. One day, Alice Petty, a Johns Hopkins graduate student, came across an unbroken pot, then another and another. Since archaeologists usually find only fragments, not intact pots, the discovery led the team to believe they had dug into an undisturbed structure. The style of the ceramics told them that the age of the structure and its contents was about 2300 B.C., approximately contemporary with the Ebla royal palace and archive.</p>
        <p>After more digging, the archaeologists realized they were looking at a tomb. The structure, about 12 feet long and 8 feet wide, probably with a vaulted ceiling, was built above the ground with a stone foundation and walls of mud bricks. The bodies were apparently buried in wooden coffins, now long decayed but with distinct traces remaining. The coffins were lined with bitumen and some kind of whitish material. Outside the tomb were two skulls of horselike animals and a jar containing the remains of another baby.</p>
        <p>Walls extended away from the tomb in almost every direction, suggesting that the structure was part of a larger complex on the acropolis, the elevated central section of the city.</p>
        <p>Whether the tomb was part of a palace or a more elaborate cemetery remains to be learned in future expeditions, Dr. Schwartz and Dr. Curvers said. But they count themselves lucky that the tomb was still there and undisturbed. They cannot imagine why a tomb in such a conspicuous place on the mound containing the ruins should have remained untouched over the centuries.</p>
        <p>In any case, the archaeologists concluded, the tomb at Umm el-Marra ''provides further evidence of the trend toward conspicuous and wealthy mortuary monuments in Syria's earliest urban civilization.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  October 4, 2000, Wednesday  Because of an editing error, a picture caption in Science Times yesterday with an article about a newly excavated tomb in Syria referred incorrectly to a lapis lazuli artifact found there. It represents an ibex, not an ibis.</p>
