        <p>Ferrying wounded from the rubble-strewn battleground at the entrance to this Israeli Arab town today, honking cars sped up a road to a clinic besieged by an angry crowd.</p>
        <p>Frantic youths shouted for people to make way as the casualties, arriving by the minute, were rushed inside. As word spread that one of the wounded had died, a man said, ''The state has declared war on its citizens.''</p>
        <p>In scenes that seemed taken from the Palestinian uprising in the West Bank and Gaza Strip more than a decade ago, a wave of rioting swept Arab communities inside Israel today, pitting Arab citizens against their state's security forces and shaking the foundations of Jewish-Arab coexistence in Israel.</p>
        <p>Pent-up feelings of discrimination, sympathy for their Palestinian brothers and outrage over a visit to Muslim sites by Ariel Sharon, the rightist Israeli opposition leader, brought thousands into the streets.</p>
        <p>The unrest shut roads and reached the heart of Israel, into the mixed Jewish-Arab towns of Acre and Jaffa, where Jewish-owned stores were smashed on Sunday night. Hundreds of stone-throwing protesters confronted officers in Nazareth, where a man was killed.</p>
        <p>A major north-south highway running by Umm al Fahm was closed today after crowds of youths, some shouting ''Death to the Jews!'' stoned passing cars and battled policemen here and in neighboring villages. Officers responded with volleys of rubber-coated bullets and tear gas.</p>
        <p>Signs of rage were everywhere. Burnt hulks of cars and street lights toppled by rioters lined the side of the road. Inside Umm al Fahm, a bank was vandalized and the local post office, a symbol of government authority, was ripped apart, its equipment destroyed and mail trucks smashed.</p>
        <p>Hashem Mahameed, a local member of the Israeli Parliament, said outrage over the dozens of Palestinian deaths in clashes with Israeli forces in recent days had been heightened by widely broadcast television images of a Palestinian boy killed as his father tried to shelter him during exchanges of gunfire in the Gaza Strip.</p>
        <p>Those feelings, coupled with a deep sense among Israel's one million Arabs that they are treated as second-class citizens, has finally boiled over, Mr. Mahameed said. Israeli Arabs have long chafed at inadequate state budgets for their communities, land confiscations, inferior schools and lack of housing and of industrial development plans for their towns.</p>
        <p>''There's a feeling of alienation, that the State of Israel put us a long time ago outside the fence,'' Mr. Mahameed said. ''Our people feel that they don't belong, that it's not their state.''</p>
        <p>Several townspeople noted that gunfire was being used to quell Arab civil disturbances, while such means were not used against Jewish Israelis. ''We feel that the police are behaving toward us as if they were occupying our towns and villages,'' Mr. Mahameed said.</p>
        <p>The outburst today was a sign of the emergence of ''a new generation that never knew defeat, that can look straight into the eyes of the Jewish majority in Israel,'' Mr. Mahameed added. ''They feel that it's enough and they cannot go on anymore.''</p>
        <p>Prime Minister Ehud Barak, denounced here as the man behind the police response to the riots,  reached out to Israeli Arabs in an attempt to calm the violence.</p>
        <p>A government statement said the cabinet would meet soon to approve plans for Israeli Arab communities, and in a televised appeal for restraint, Mr. Barak sounded a conciliatory tone.</p>
        <p>''We are aware of the great frustration among the Arab citizens of the state,'' Mr. Barak said. ''I know that an overwhelming majority of them are law-abiding citizens, and I call on them and the leaders of the Arab community in Israel not to be dragged after extreme elements who are trying to agitate and cause damage to the delicate fabric of coexistence in the State of Israel.''</p>
