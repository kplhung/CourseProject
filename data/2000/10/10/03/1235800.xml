        <p>The two-time defending World Series champions took batting practice at Oakland Coliseum yesterday and should have felt like a team on parole.

        <p>The two-time defending World Series champions took batting practice at Oakland Coliseum yesterday and should have felt like a team on parole. The Yankees were pensive and showed little swagger, which is typical for them and which should be routine behavior for a team that switched between being invisible and inferior for the last three dreadful weeks.</p>
        <p>Paul O'Neill spoke about the colorful people he always sees when the Yankees stay in downtown San Francisco. Jorge Posada practiced blocking pitches in the right-field bullpen. Chuck Knoblauch jumped around as he heard the lyrics ''jump around'' by House of Pain over the public-address system.</p>
        <p>And of course, Joe Torre presided over the workout from his perch behind the batting cage. Sipping a cup of green tea, Torre looked as he always does: relaxed. But no matter how calm Torre looked or how stoic the Yankees seemed, this is a different setting for them because they are not the obvious favorites to win a third straight World Series title. Not when they have lost their last seven games of the regular season and 15 of their last 18. Not when they need to prove themselves again.</p>
        <p>''I don't think they feel that way,'' Torre said. ''Even with what we've gone through, I don't think they feel that way about themselves. I don't see that.''</p>
        <p>Who knows what might have happened to the Yankees if the torturous regular season had lasted one more week? Or even three more days? How much more damage might the Yankees have caused themselves if their unprecedented trudging to the finish line was not graciously ended by the calendar on Sunday?</p>
        <p>''The regular season is over,'' Luis Sojo said. ''The players couldn't wait for it to end.''</p>
        <p>But now the Yankees have dumped themselves into a postseason position they have never been mired in before under Torre, forced to deal with persistent doubts about their abilities. The Yankees are no longer invincible, and in some ways they are considered fortunate to be here. Are they ready for this challenge?</p>
        <p>''I guess,'' Knoblauch said. ''Whether we are or not, at 5 o'clock tomorrow, it's going to start.''</p>
        <p>Sojo smiled while acknowledging that the Yankees are probably not favored to win it all but continued smiling as he said, ''The teams that play us, in their minds, they know they have to beat a good team.''</p>
        <p>Fresh start. Clean slate. Zero and zero. The Yankees uttered these cliches so often that they sounded like 25 parolees.</p>
        <p>Torre has rightfully said that the Yankees will prevail if their pitching is dependable. If Roger Clemens is sturdy in Game 1 and the Yankees take a lead over the Athletics in the division series, the Yankees think they will start cruising. This is what the Yankees have to say and have to believe, although Torre emphasized, ''I really believe it.''</p>
        <p>The script could unfold that way. Clemens, who has been bruised for 5 homers and 13 earned runs in his last 9 innings, could throttle the A's and steal the momentum.</p>
        <p>But what if Clemens falters? Or what if Andy Pettitte loses Game 2? The finish will not vanish. Even if the Yankees sweep the A's, if they endure problems this October, there will be more questions about that 3-15 crawl to the postseason. Watch for it. They are not your twin brother's Yankees. They are your little brother's Yankees.</p>
        <p>''I don't think it's going to bother us,'' Torre said. ''I can't explain it other than it was different. It had nothing to do with the effort, other than the tension of having a big lead and not handling it.''</p>
        <p>In 1996, the Yankees were talented but definitely not favored to win the World Series, and they won. The next year, the Yankees were favored, and they lost in the division series. In 1998 and 1999, the Yankees were favored and won the Series both times, in sweeps. In 2000, the Yankees are more 87-victory underachievers than feared defending champions, until they prove otherwise.</p>
        <p>''We won 114 games in '98 and we won 87 this year and we're starting out 0-0 both times,'' Derek Jeter said. ''There are 22 teams out there who wish they could be where we are.''</p>
        <p>Simply getting here is what matters, the Yankees said, after scooping up grounders and ripping liners yesterday. But the Yankees know their season will be a waste if they do not win it all. It is how they have been constructed (see George Steinbrenner's $112 million payroll) and how they have been conditioned (see George Steinbrenner's reactions to postseason losses).</p>
        <p>Eleven more victories. That is what the Yankees need to brand themselves as a dynasty. But the parole board has one final question. After managing three victories in the last three weeks, should anyone envision the Yankees winning 11 games in October?</p>
        <p>Only if they play like a much improved team.</p>
        <p>''In 24 hours, we'll know,'' Torre said. ''If we play well, it'll be a thing of the past. If not, they'll blame it on that.''</p>
