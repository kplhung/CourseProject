        <p>The Nets' Kenyon Martin, the top overall pick of the 2000 draft, did not think about the sharp teeth digging into his shooting hand today.</p>
        <p>Instead, being the dutiful rookie, he fed bananas to the whiskered bearcat, the mascot of his alma mater, the University of Cincinnati, and posed for a photo. Meanwhile, a Hall of Famer from Cincinnati, Oscar Robertson, looked on in amusement. The Nets brought Robertson in, too, to lend a festive, if not circus-like, atmosphere to an afternoon infused with optimism.</p>
        <p>By the end, the bearcat was eating grapes out of Martin's hand. Store that image for the future, if Martin's bold goals come true in his rookie season.</p>
        <p>''The only goal I set for myself is to make the all-N.B.A. defensive first team,'' said the 6-foot-9 Martin, who will switch with Keith Van Horn at small and power forward this season.</p>
        <p>Martin wants that honor more than rookie of the year ''because it's never happened before,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''I strive for defense,'' said Martin, who was Conference USA defensive player of the year three times. ''That's what separates me from a lot of people.''</p>
        <p>His soft-spoken words resonated on the eve of training camp at the Champion Center. His veteran teammates, returning from years of injury and coaching changes, were optimistic.</p>
        <p>Point guard Stephon Marbury thought Martin's goal best typified the new Nets philosophy.</p>
        <p>''He gets big stars for that, because the mentality from everyone here is defense,'' Marbury said.</p>
        <p>But if Martin was the somewhat embarrassed focus today, he was certainly not the show.</p>
        <p>Unequivocally, the new head coach, Byron Scott, winner of three National Basketball Association titles with the Lakers and a protege of Pat Riley and Larry Brown, will run the show. Because of Scott, the veterans expect immediate improvement over last season's 31-51 finish under Don Casey.</p>
        <p>''Success comes from the No. 1 position, and that's the head coach,'' Van Horn said. ''Last year I think at a lot of times we lacked direction at that position.''</p>
        <p>''He seems very disciplined, comes from a long line of discipline coaches,'' Van Horn said of Scott. ''He's been on disciplined teams that have won, and I hope that will transfer to our court. If you put that with our talent level, within a great structure, a great system and a great coach, you can win.''</p>
        <p>Marbury, having fine-tuned his shot with Scott this summer, preached the new feeling.</p>
        <p>''It's totally different, not even close,'' Marbury said. ''You're playing for someone who has won championships, practiced like a champion. You have that person leading you, good things are going to happen.''</p>
        <p>After Scott, Martin is the key. His right leg, which he fractured in March, has completely healed, and he has impressed both Marbury and Van Horn in pickup games.</p>
        <p>''I never saw him wince, I never saw him flinch,'' Van Horn said. ''Out of all the games, I've never seen Kenyon quit once. We lacked energy without Jayson Williams last year. Kenyon is not Jayson, but they have the same type of energy. His presence is going to be able to help the team.''</p>
        <p>One player was not present today. Shooting guard Kendall Gill, who signed a $7 million, one-year contract this summer, missed media day but arrived in time for tonight's team meeting, a last-minute arrangement.</p>
        <p>Other free-agent acquisitions, the 6-9 forward Aaron Williams and a re-signed Johnny Newman, seemed comfortable with their key reserve roles. Jim McIlvaine, Evan Eschmeyer and Jamie Feick, fitter than ever, are prepared to split time at center.</p>
        <p>About the only player not happy to be in uniform today was a limping shooting guard, Kerry Kittles, who is out indefinitely.</p>
        <p>''It's a tease,'' he said. ''It's a bummer I can't get ready to play with them tomorrow because this system would really fit me.''</p>
        <p>Instead, Kittles will spend some or all of the season rehabilitating from a rare surgery that took bone pieces from his knee and filled holes in the bones of his femur.</p>
        <p>Still, he might be pleased to be on the sideline tomorrow. ''They're going to be sore; they're going to be dying,'' Scott promised. ''I want to be the best-conditioned team in the league.''</p>
        <p>He has another goal.</p>
        <p>''I know we only won 31 games last year, and if we win 40 this year, it will probably be considered a success,'' he said. ''Still, to me, we make the playoffs and we'll be successful.''</p>
        <p>Martin's team-first attitude is the hallmark of that success, Scott said, adding, ''It makes me feel very good that he wants to be a great defensive player because that's where we're heading anyway.''</p>
