        <p>Russia is laying antipersonnel mines and reinforcing its defensive positions along the border between Tajikistan and Afghanistan, as Taliban fighters have moved their forces within artillery range of the Russian Army, which protects the gateway to Central Asia.</p>
        <p>A senior Russian official said on Sunday night that Moscow did not believe that the Taliban army was preparing an attack across the border.</p>
        <p>The Taliban military campaign has scored a series of victories in recent weeks, prompting a strong expression of concern from Central Asia governments, whose national security advisers met in Moscow over the weekend.</p>
        <p>The secretary of Russia's National Security Council, Sergei B. Ivanov, said that ''from the point of view of the national security of Russia,'' the Taliban offensive in northern Afghanistan was of greater concern to Moscow than the postelection instability in Yugoslavia.</p>
        <p>Speaking on Russian television, Mr. Ivanov said that ''according to our assessments,'' more than 30,000 troops were fighting under the Taliban command, including regular army troops from Pakistan, ''as well as mercenaries from the Arab countries and Chechnya.'' As Afghan refugees flee the fighting, Mr. Ivanov warned of the possibility of a ''large-scale human disaster that is comparable with everything that took place in Kosovo and other major human disasters throughout the world over the last years.''</p>
        <p>''And, of course,'' he added, ''they will seek refuge on the territory of Tajikistan. So it is a threat that we consider to be very serious.''</p>
        <p>Russian concern about Pakistan's role in the campaign apparently prompted President Vladimir V. Putin to dispatch a senior envoy to Islamabad last week to discuss regional security. The envoy, Sergei Yastrzhembsky, was said to have met senior Pakistani military and intelligence officials, but Moscow has not commented on the results of the talks.</p>
        <p>Taliban forces undertook an offensive in the summer against the ''northern alliance'' forces under the command of Gen. Ahmed Shah Masoud, whose army defends a swath of mountainous enclaves in parts of northern Afghanistan not under Taliban control. General Masoud's fighters were overrun last month and lost control of Taliqan, the northern Afghan city that controls access to the Pyanj River border region with Tajikistan. Last week, General Masoud reportedly began a counteroffensive.</p>
