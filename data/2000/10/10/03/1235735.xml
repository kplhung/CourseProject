        <p>Down a wooden sidewalk and behind a pressed-tin facade, the Jackson Hole Playhouse -- with an adjoining saloon that has stuffed elk heads on the walls and leather saddles for bar stools -- looks like the kind of place John Ford might have chosen to film a gunslingers' brawl.</p>
        <p>This weekend, though, the theater was the scene of another kind of tussling and wrangling: Dick Cheney rented it out on Saturday night for a dry run of his coming vice-presidential debate.</p>
        <p>''When we walked in,'' recalled Rob Portman, the Ohio congressman who plays Mr. Cheney's Democratic rival, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, in the practice debates, ''they were playing the theme song from 'Bonanza.' ''</p>
        <p>The two men, aides reported, went at each other on a raft of issues for a full 90-minute session as they sought to replicate the conditions Mr. Cheney will face on Thursday night at his one and only debate, in Danville, Ky. Mr. Cheney, who has not had to debate in a dozen years, when he last ran for re-election as Wyoming's lone congressman, spent a long weekend here getting himself ready.</p>
        <p>Facing off against Mr. Lieberman will be no easy task. Ever since the two men were picked as running mates, Mr. Cheney has been dogged by criticisms that he is not as good a campaigner as Mr. Lieberman, not as charismatic as Mr. Lieberman, not as funny as Mr. Lieberman. But Mr. Cheney's staff is predicting that the candidate will be able to show off a mastery of policy and politics that comes from his 25 years in government as a White House chief of staff,  congressman and President George Bush's secretary of defense during the Persian Gulf war.</p>
        <p>And unlike other campaign staffs, which routinely seek to diminish the expectations of their candidates before debates so that they can later spin anything short of a disastrous outing as an unqualified success, Mr. Cheney's aides have been quite upbeat about their candidate's prospects. Asked how Mr. Cheney did in the practice sessions, Mr. Portman, the Lieberman stand-in, said simply, ''He cleaned my clock.''</p>
        <p>While aides were reluctant to give away many details of Mr. Cheney's preparations, they conceded that many likely areas of debate were fairly obvious.</p>
        <p>Playing defense, they said, Mr. Cheney steeled himself for an assault on his conservative voting record in Congress, where he voted against the Head Start program, banning plastic guns and a House resolution calling for the freeing of Nelson Mandela from a South African prison. On offense, they said, Mr. Cheney prepared to question Mr. Lieberman about why he abandoned some of the more conservative causes that he once supported -- like school voucher programs and the partial privatization of Social Security -- when he signed on as Vice President Al Gore's running mate.</p>
        <p>For his part, Mr. Cheney said he was not seeking to soften his image on Thursday. ''Most of the advice I get is be yourself,'' Mr. Cheney said in an interview last week. ''You've got to come across as straight.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney's personal debating experience may be somewhat limited. He has been a frequent guest over the years on Sunday morning talk shows, discussing policy with a professorial mein, but sometimes bristling under harsh questioning.</p>
        <p>He knows as well as anyone the stakes involved in a formal debate. As President Gerald R. Ford's chief of staff, Mr. Cheney had a front-row seat on two of the most memorable debates of the past 25 years, debates whose outcomes turned on a single misstatement or miscalculation.</p>
        <p>There was Mr. Ford's much-ridiculed claim in his 1976 debate with Jimmy Carter that ''there is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe.'' And in the vice-presidential debate that year, Mr. Ford's running mate, Senator Bob Dole, complained that all the wars in the 20th century were ''Democrat wars.'' Both lines became defining sound bites of the campaign, and may have cost the Ford-Dole ticket some votes in what was a very close election.</p>
        <p>This weekend Mr. Cheney prepared extensively. Stuart Stevens, a media adviser with the Bush campaign, flew here to help. And Mr. Cheney called in many others from his 25 years in government and his five years heading the Halliburton Company, an energy services company based in Texas, for their advice.</p>
        <p>The Cheney family helped out as well. His older daughter, Liz Cheney-Perry, has been in charge of debate preparation. His younger daughter, Mary Cheney, helped him keep his answers on time. And his son-in-law, Phil Perry, stood in as the debate's moderator, Bernard Shaw of CNN. ''He was tough,'' Mr. Portman said of Mr. Perry. ''Much tougher than I would have been on my father-in-law.''</p>
