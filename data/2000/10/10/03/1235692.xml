        <p>Americans are increasingly alienated from their own democracy because they believe their votes and money can never match the power of special interests or personal fortunes. Those who participate do so keenly aware of the way the process is distorted by the need to raise huge sums just to run for office.</p>
        <p>From a combined Democrat-Republican expenditure of $45 million in 1988, the total spent in House and Senate campaigns soared to an extraordinary $262 million in 1996 and this year will go higher. Soft money, the corporate and personal contribution loophole, is in addition to this and has destroyed any semblance of decency or restraint. It also became a prominent issue in the attention-getting Senate contest between Hillary Clinton and Rick Lazio in New York when the two sides tried with limited success to agree to ban it.</p>
        <p>In our Senate race against each other in 1996, we established a voluntary model of a way candidates in any state might run for office while limiting the influence of money on the outcome. We offer our experience as an example of how candidates themselves can encourage voters to see the system differently and can prove their sincerity without waiting for reluctant political institutions to embrace real reform.</p>
        <p>We were two candidates -- each with strong favorability ratings, national fund-raising ability and high name recognition -- battling it out in the nation's most-watched Senate race, a magnet for thousands of donors, myriad interest groups and both national parties. Added into the equation were a presidential race and expenditures by interest groups independent of campaigns spiraling out of control around the country.</p>
        <p>It was in that crucible that we forged an unprecedented agreement to cap campaign spending, ban independent expenditures and conduct an issues-oriented campaign centered on substantive Lincoln-Douglas style debates. The model worked well enough for us to complete a bruising Senate race, adhere to the spending pact with only minor disagreements and even hoist a beer in celebration together only a few nights after the election.</p>
        <p>One of us an incumbent governor, the other an incumbent senator, we met secretly at a private home during the heat of the campaign to hammer out an agreement. We had committed to a series of hourlong debates that we both knew would provide enormous coverage of our proposals and disagreements. We also limited overall spending on each of our campaigns to $6.9 million, and made that cap retroactive to early in the summer.</p>
        <p>We agreed to spend no more than $5 million each on television and newspaper advertising. Most important, our pact banned us from using independent or ''third party'' money to aid our campaigns. We asked the press to refuse to carry campaign ads on our behalf from outside groups, and we agreed to deduct the cost of any independently financed negative ads about each other from our own advertising budgets, a compelling incentive to keep our friends at bay so they couldn't detract from our own message strategy.</p>
        <p>Our agreement was not perfect. But notwithstanding a flurry of charges and countercharges in the  final days of our campaign -- because we had failed to define some kinds of spending well enough -- we were completely successful in banning soft money and independent spending, and limiting party money to specific amounts and sources. Most important, we limited the overall amount spent on the campaign and, specifically, on broadcast and newspaper ads. In the end, our agreement was adhered to.</p>
        <p>We believe we succeeded in creating a model that other candidates might improve upon. Rather than exchange pie-in-the sky proposals for unilateral disarmament or subject voters to an arms race where money is funneled through anonymous and unaccountable interest groups, willing candidates can continue to elevate the practice of politics this election cycle. They need not wait for a reluctant Congress to pass campaign finance reform; its members can practice what they preach through voluntary agreements, restoring faith in the process, and providing local models for national reform.</p>
