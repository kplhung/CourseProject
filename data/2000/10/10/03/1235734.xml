        <p>When Bradley McCallum, a former artist in residence of the New York Civil Liberties Union, conceived of a public art project focusing on police violence, he anticipated trouble getting the city's permission to display the project.</p>
        <p>Instead, it was the federal government that prevented him from setting up the piece yesterday outside the United States Courthouse at 500 Pearl Street in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>The project, titled ''Witness: Perspectives on Police Violence'' and created in collaboration with Jacqueline Tarry, consists of five emergency call boxes with speakers in place of the buttons normally used to call the police or the Fire Department. The speakers play the recorded voices of victims, families, lawyers and police officers whose lives have been affected by police violence.</p>
        <p>On Sunday, Mr. McCallum and Ms. Tarry had begun a citywide tour with the call boxes. They had permits allowing them to set up at sites of police violence as well as courthouses where such cases were tried.</p>
        <p>The first stop was the Bronx street corner where Anthony Baez was choked to death in 1994. Francis X. Livoti, a police officer, was acquitted in state court of criminally negligent homicide, but later  convicted, in a trial at the courthouse on Pearl Street, of violating Mr. Baez's civil rights.</p>
        <p>Although the federal government is sometimes perceived as the only recourse for victims of police violence, federal employees -- the marshals responsible for courthouse security -- refused to honor Mr. McCallum's city permit.</p>
        <p>The artists set up the call boxes in a public plaza nearby. As a curious man studied one of the boxes, which are cast from an original 1910 mold but painted black instead of the customary red, Mr. McCallum said he was not sure that the content of the piece had been the problem. ''What's more frustrating is that there wasn't really the effort to even look at the permit,'' he said. He said security officers had received written notice last week.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCallum said he would try to get permission from the federal marshals to return.</p>
        <p>The federal government, not the city, has jurisdiction over that block of Pearl Street, said Anthony Moritz, a deputy marshal on duty last night. The officials who issued the permit could not be reached, nor could the Marshals Service.</p>
        <p>Although the piece is openly critical of the city, with one recorded interview of an officer saying, ''The police department itself must be dissected, taken apart and put back correctly,'' Ms. Tarry said the Mayor's Office for Film, Theater and Broadcasting had cooperated.</p>
        <p>Sidestepping the city's public art guidelines, the artists applied for permission to use the call boxes as props in a film documenting the project. The only hesitation by the city, Ms. Tarry said, had come when they wanted to go to the sites of violence. ''They don't want to retraumatize neighborhoods for the sake of a film,'' Ms. Tarry said. ''It was striking that their concern was for the community.''</p>
