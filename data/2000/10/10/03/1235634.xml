      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Ben Harper does not suffer from generational anxiety. The 30-year-old guitarist and singer-songwriter is famous for channeling the wisdom of his elders, particularly baby boom stars from Jimi Hendrix to Cat Stevens. His Thursday show at Roseland, the second of a two-night run, blended many influences without pointing too strongly at any one. Its main focus was the category-leaping that makes Mr. Harper his own man.</p>
        <p>Certainly the lanky artist, who spent the night folded into a chair as he played a variety of stringed instruments, sees himself as an inheritor. Opening the show, he mixed his own ''Oppression'' with ''Get Up Stand Up'' by Bob Marley, doing a spot-on vocal imitation of the late reggae star.</p>

        <p>Ben Harper does not suffer from generational anxiety. The 30-year-old guitarist and singer-songwriter is famous for channeling the wisdom of his elders, particularly baby boom stars from Jimi Hendrix to Cat Stevens. His Thursday show at Roseland, the second of a two-night run, blended many influences without pointing too strongly at any one. Its main focus was the category-leaping that makes Mr. Harper his own man.</p>
        <p>Certainly the lanky artist, who spent the night folded into a chair as he played a variety of stringed instruments, sees himself as an inheritor. Opening the show, he mixed his own ''Oppression'' with ''Get Up Stand Up'' by Bob Marley, doing a spot-on vocal imitation of the late reggae star.</p>
        <p>Instead of staying on point with the revolutionary talk, however, Mr. Harper and his backing trio, the Innocent Criminals, then sped into a raunchy blues that recalled the Black Crowes. The next turn was toward Led Zeppelin-style heavy metal, with Mr. Harper pulling feedback from his vintage Weissenborn acoustic slide guitar. The band later elaborated on that allusion with a set-closing rendition of ''Whole Lotta Love.''</p>
        <p>These quick referential leaps gave Mr. Harper his own identity as a free agent crossing lines of genre, culture and race.</p>
        <p>As a biracial star in the neohippie jam band scene, which is largely white, Mr. Harper could play up his difference as a sign of authenticity. Instead he explores miscegenation on all levels. His band is mixed-race, and his songs borrow equally from folk, blues and psychedelic hard rock.</p>
        <p>Even his way of rapidly switching from electric to acoustic to slide guitar kept his set loose -- unfocused at times -- and playful. Despite a lyrical tendency toward premature world-weariness, Mr. Harper's music is mainly a celebration of the way music can free people from their daily burdens and bring them together in joy.</p>
        <p>One big motor behind Mr. Harper's gear-shifting music is the percussionist David Leach. He stepped out for several exciting solos and otherwise added dimension to the more direct rhythms determined by Dean Butterworth on drums. Juan Nelson was more reticent on bass, although he stepped out for a funky solo during ''Steal My Kisses.''</p>
        <p>Also featured on that song was Rahzel, the human beat box from the hip-hop band the Roots, whose vocal interplay with the part-time Innocent Criminal Nick Rich (also a human beat box) lifted Mr. Harper's sound firmly into the present. Rahzel can produce as many variations on the blues formula in his mouth as Mr. Harper can by pressing fingers to fingerboard. These two relaxed reference blenders were well matched.</p>
