        <p>Xerox Is Predicting a Loss; Shares Tumble After Hours  Xerox, citing lower sales at a time of rising costs, warned that it would report a third-quarter loss of 15 cents to 20 cents a share. Analysts had expected a lackluster quarter, but few expected actual red ink.</p>
        <p>Xerox made the announcement after the market closed, and its shares fell as low as $12.50 after hours from $15.31. [Page C2.]</p>
        <p>Nasdaq Slides, but Dow Edges Up  Investors continued to shed technology stocks, sending the Nasdaq composite index down for the seventh time in eight sessions. The Nasdaq fell 103.92 points, or 2.8 percent, to 3,568.90. Broader gauges were mixed. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 49.21 points, or 0.5 percent, to 10,700.13. But the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index was essentially unchanged, slipping 0.28 point, to 1,436.23. [C20.]</p>
        <p>U.S. Picks Encryption Technology  After a three-year worldwide search for a new encryption technique powerful enough to earn the endorsement of the United States government, the Commerce Department named a winner: Rijndael, a play on the names of its two Belgian creators. [C12.]</p>
        <p>Quorum Health in Fraud Settlement  The Quorum Health Group, the nation's largest hospital management company, agreed in principle to pay $95.5 million in civil penalties to settle two lawsuits that accused it of defrauding federal health care programs. [A21.]</p>
        <p>Interest Revived in Frozen Oil Fields  With huge reserves of oil and natural gas beneath frigid seas, the Russian Arctic is one of the last untapped treasure-troves of fuel. And rising energy prices have made the industry more confident that the risk and expense of getting it are justified, for Russia's needs and for export. [World Business, Section W.]</p>
