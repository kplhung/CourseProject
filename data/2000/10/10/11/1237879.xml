        <p>Of course, Christian Dior would be rolling in his grave. Of course, all the former clients are feeling old and rejected. Of course, of course, of course.</p>
        <p>But let's not talk about any of that. Let's talk about why John Galliano's cold, shallow, lurid, brutal, hysterical show for Dior today was absolutely dead on. And for the first time.</p>
        <p>Mr. Galliano has been hacking away at the Dior myth the way Spider Ligon, a hero among demolition derby fans, used to take apart a Chevy. But he would hardly make a dent. Every season, for the past several, he would start ripping the seams, pulling out the linings, turning jackets into skirts and so on. But to a lot of the editors and writers, including this one, who go to both the haute couture and ready-to-wear shows, what he was doing seemed without authenticity. It looked fake. He would do a collection based on the frenetic street style of, say, Lauryn Hill, yet what you were really looking at was a luxury label whose image had been perverted. But it was still a luxury label.</p>
        <p>This collection was the real thing. It had the raw authenticity, the lubricity, of garage couture. When the first models started trampling out -- to Slim Whitman on the ''Mars Attacks!'' soundtrack and Lynyrd Skynyrd doing ''Sweet Home Alabama'' -- you could barely take it all in: the fishnets and banana clips, the beaten brown leather of a wrap skirt, the stiletto biker boots, the tops covered with patches for engine products -- from a distance, the whole thing blurred together like some hallucinogenic Lesage embroidery from Saint Laurent in the 1970's.</p>
        <p>And that was the thing that set this collection apart. It had irony, which Mr. Galliano had never before completely pulled off, but also a pop sense of composition, of taking things apart and rearranging them in a new form.</p>
        <p>Though the show started to lose vitality in the second half, it had a wonderfully impudent spirit of creativity as Mr. Galliano sent out shoulder bags blazing with fender chrome, vinyl leopard hot pants with denim waistbands, leather-and-nylon track pants with the word Diorella running down a side, flower prints in the cheesy hues of a suburban teenage bedroom and sashes of fraying chiffon with zippers.</p>
        <p>Those zippers were interesting but almost overlooked. After the show, in the backstage madness that included Naomi Campbell, Azzedine Alaia and the actress Leelee Sobieski, Mr. Galliano said that each piece in the collection could be attached to another by means of a zipper ''so you can create your own look.'' That's virtuoso fashion.</p>
        <p>The Paris spring 2001 shows, which end Friday with Jeremy Scott and Tom Ford's first ready-to-wear presentation for Saint Laurent, have been exceptionally strong. Valentino had a great collection today, his best in several seasons, with a cool palette of white and taupe mixed in with graphic stripes and polka dots. For an evening skirt, he revived a jade and black panther print from his 1960's-era archives and brought back chunky silver eagles for belt buckles and bag fasteners. Day clothes included chic ponchos in taupe linen, crisp white blouses with tuxedo fronts speckled with black French knots, and easy mixes of leather-trimmed ivory hot pants and leather or suede blousons. There were Shantung and linen suits, in brown and beige bias stripes, for women who haven't a clue about magical zips and, anyway, don't care. The collection looked light and young and revealed just enough skin. Though Valentino showed a few embellished dresses, the most modern evening looks were tight black Shantung pants with soft, ruffled blouses. He showed plenty of them.</p>
        <p>It's always interesting to watch Dries van Noten calmly move fashion's marker, and see copycats jump. One of the first to show fuller skirts, he now shifted the volume to shoulders and gave a longer line to fluttery, knee-length skirts in almost mousy garden prints and wide linen trousers sashed with dangling suede belts. The clothes, shown on Monday, gave a hint of the 1920's, especially in the drowsy hues and loose, jazz age wrappers. Here and there were bold Henley stripes -- in a boyish blazer over an orange-and-violet print skirt, and as bias stripes on the pleated skirt of a cotton middy dress. Because of their banal shapes, the clothes seemed to be for someone in retreat not so much from fashion but from obvious expressions of status or sexuality.</p>
        <p>Another designer, Bernhard Willhelm, who, like Mr. van Noten, lives in Belgium, also seemed to be using arcane styles, like smocking on muslin or crewelwork on linen dirndl skirts, to convey a private, more complex view of female charm. And it's intriguing that both drew upon mundane images of domesticity. Guests arriving for Mr. Willhelm's show on Sunday night were greeted by a video, projected on a large screen, of a matronly woman busily baking a cake in her modern, apartment-block kitchen. For Mr. van Noten, the reference was the everyday intimacy depicted by the Flemish impressionist Rik Wouters in paintings of his wife. A sleeveless white dress with chaste pleats and a stern black necktie slyly caught the public/private thing. The back was all nude veiling.</p>
        <p>''For me,'' Mr. van Noten said after the show, ''the question was how to make everything look feminine without the aggressiveness that's going around in fashion.''</p>
        <p>In a sense, all fashion shows are a meditation of what it means to be a woman, but Mr. Willhelm, who has been in business only a few seasons, did a masterful job of combining feminine cliches like puffed sleeves and granny crocheting, with newer, more chaotic forms of style that can engage his generation. With their teased manes captured eccentrically in hairnets, the models came out in embroidered skirts that depicted the sort of quaint rural scenes you would see on a sampler. To this naive style, Mr. Willhelm added blouses with petals of muslin bunched around the neck or sleeveless T-shirts covered with fabric rosettes and scrolls that evoked military decorations.</p>
        <p>And yet, all the while, Mr. Willhelm kept up a running monologue with the insolent present -- now a common sweatshirt cut off at the sleeves, now a pair of Nikes perversely posing as golf shoes. Like contemporary artists who see lunacy everywhere, especially in a consumer culture, Mr. Willhelm knows how to work the contradictions. Its most ingenious expression was a plain cotton skirt with images of Mickey Mouse grinning against a Mondrian grid pattern.</p>
        <p>It was great to see both Dirk Bikkembergs and Romeo Gigli back on track with collections drawn from their signature styles. Mr. Gigli showed pretty cotton and organdy blouses that wrapped around the body and were worn with softly gathered skirts in stripes or prints that recalled Florentine endpapers. Mr. Bikkembergs cuts some of the best wide-leg, low-slung trousers around. They looked chic with silk shirts in Mediterranean shades of navy and red. And as masculine as his pantsuits were, they had a softness that has eluded other designers attempting the same look.</p>
        <p>Anyone who grew up in the 1970's will remember Cacharel, especially its sweet prints. On Monday Suzanne Clements and Inacio Ribeiro did a terrific job of infusing the label with new vitality. The show opened with tight capri pants and asymmetrical dresses in toile prints, and included new floral prints, cute Western shirts and patent-leather stilettos that sent the right trashy note. ''I think the collection is as good as Cacharel was before,'' said Jean Bousquet, the company's owner and founder.</p>
        <p>Earlier in the day, Naoki Takizawa was off in his own fashion orbit at Issey Miyake, sending out dresses that wafted like sails and others that were indeed marvels of technique (trapping gobs of confettilike tulle between two layers of sheer fabric), but they would invite too many raised eyebrows anywhere.</p>
        <p>Why do designers need to follow someone else's style? And do they actually think the fashion crowd won't notice? Ennio Capasa of Costume National opened with some modern mixes of black leather and satin, giving shoulders more shrug, and giving leather trousers deep front pleats that puckered weirdly in front. But one had to wonder if Mr. Capasa was looking over his shoulder at the 1980's style of Alexander McQueen and Nicolas Ghesquiere, especially for those skinny pegged trousers that were meant to be different but, with a drooping crotch and gaping pleats, just looked like a self-conscious attempt to flee from the obvious.</p>
