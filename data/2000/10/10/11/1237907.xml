        <p>During three months this summer, the Republican National Committee raised $100 million, or more than $1 million every day, Republican officials said today. The $100 million total represents the largest sum raised in a single quarter by a national party in American history and leaves the party with a significant cash advantage over the Democrats in the final weeks of the campaign.</p>
        <p>Even so, the Democratic National Committee set its own record for the quarter, raising $55 million from July 1 to Sept. 30, party officials said today.</p>
        <p>While Republicans are ahead with just 28 days until Election Day, both parties have built enormous war chests for the homestretch, enabling each side to continue to spend $1 million a week on advertising in several key battleground states, like Florida and Michigan.</p>
        <p>The Republicans, and Gov. George W. Bush, have a 2 to 1 advantage in cash on hand over the Democrats and Vice President Al Gore. Party officials said today that the Republicans had about $50 million in the bank and the Democrats had $25 million. The money will go to issue advertising and get-out-the-vote efforts between now and the Nov. 7 election.</p>
        <p>Even in this election year of toppled records and ever-rising campaign costs, the two major national political parties' enormous donor revenues seemed to surprise and even confound many campaign fund-raisers and campaign finance experts.</p>
        <p>''It is an extraordinary development,'' said Fred Wertheimer, the president of Democracy 21, a Washington group that supports changes in the campaign finance law. ''In a very close presidential election, the Republicans are going to have a huge financial advantage over the Democrats in the presidential race. We have not seen this kind of financial advantage for a presidential campaign since the 1972 election.''</p>
        <p>Republican Party officials attributed their fund-raising success to appealing to a broad base of more than 900,000 donors with a conservative message. They also acknowledged that the $50 million in the bank gave them a decided advantage over the Democrats.</p>
        <p>''Obviously, the electoral map has never been more wide open,'' said Terry Holt, the communications director of the Republican National Committee. ''We feel like we are going to be in a good competitive position going into the last 27 days of the campaign.''</p>
        <p>For their part, Democratic Party officials, who in the past have criticized the $100 million raised by Governor Bush's campaign, said they had actually narrowed the wide financial gap enjoyed in past election years by the Republicans.</p>
        <p>And they seized the differences in the third-quarter statistics as an opportunity to portray the Republicans as the party of big money interests.</p>
        <p>''We would never enter, or win, a money race with the Republican Party because that is not what our party is all about,'' said Jenny Backus, press secretary for the Democratic National Committee. ''However, we have enjoyed tremendous success and momentum, thanks to the excitement surrounding the Gore-Lieberman ticket and our positive, substantive vision for the future.''</p>
        <p>In this election cycle, both national political parties have raised enormous sums of ''soft money,'' the unlimited contributions given by wealthy individuals, corporations and labor unions.</p>
        <p>In the past two months, however, both parties have aggressively sought the smaller checks of ''hard money,'' which can be no larger than $20,000.</p>
        <p>Federal election rules require that the parties pay for ''issue advertising'' with a complicated mixture of hard and soft money. For each $2 of soft money spent, the party must spend $1 in hard money. It is traditionally more difficult to raise the hard money, and Republicans have always found it easier than the Democrats to raise the smaller checks. But the Democrats are catching up.</p>
        <p>Indeed, both parties have enjoyed enormous windfalls of the smaller, hard-money donations since holding their national conventions in August.</p>
        <p>In a single day in August, the Democratic Party raised $500,000 in response to a direct-mail letter that was sent out the day after its convention ended in Los Angeles. But that single-day record was shattered today when the party took in a total of $700,000 of small-donor checks, party officials said.</p>
        <p>The Democrats have also aggressively sought smaller donations by holding concerts featuring performances by James Taylor in Boston and Jimmy Buffett in Miami. Last month, the Democratic National Committee raised $6.5 million, mostly in small hard-money checks, at a star-studded concert at Radio City Music Hall in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>The party has also sought more creative ways to raise smaller donations. It introduced an online art auction; Internet donors traded campaign checks for an original Andy Warhol print, signed Robert Rauschenberg prints and an original Chuck Close photograph.</p>
        <p>The Democratic National Committee has also worked hard at treating its most active fund-raisers to special perks this month. Each fund-raiser was invited to attend one of the presidential debates.</p>
        <p>Last week in Boston, more than 150 fund-raisers attended a dinner at the Palm restaurant and then headed to the auditorium to watch the first debate between Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>The Republicans attribute their record-shattering success to building a donor base that now numbers more than 900,000 contributors. Of that group, more than 300,000 are new donors who gave to the party for the first time, party officials said.</p>
        <p>''One of our sources of strength is our ability to energize our base of small donors,'' Mr. Holt said. ''It has been the key ingredient to these record-breaking numbers.''</p>
        <p>In October 1996, a month before the election, the Republicans had $25 million in the bank and the Democrats had $13 million. In the third quarter of that year, the Republicans raised $64 million and the Democrats raised $43 million.</p>
