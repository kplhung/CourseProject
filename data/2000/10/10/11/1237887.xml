        <p>The new leaders who hope to salvage Yugoslavia's shattered economy said today that the country would need substantial aid from abroad to survive the winter.</p>
        <p>Miroljub Labus, an economic adviser to President Vojislav Kostunica, said a future government would support worker groups that have begun taking over factories and would use ''all legal means'' to reverse the dubious sales of dozens of state companies to backers of the ex-president, Slobodan Milosovic.</p>

        <p>The new leaders who hope to salvage Yugoslavia's shattered economy said today that the country would need substantial aid from abroad to survive the winter.</p>
        <p>Miroljub Labus, an economic adviser to President Vojislav Kostunica, said a future government would support worker groups that have begun taking over factories and would use ''all legal means'' to reverse the dubious sales of dozens of state companies to backers of the ex-president, Slobodan Milosovic.</p>
        <p>Officials of the parties supporting Mr. Kostunica said at a news conference today that they would welcome foreign investors, including Americans. Many Yugoslavs see the United States as their enemy after the NATO bombing campaign last year.</p>
        <p>''We are trying as fast as possible to connect our economy to the international economy,'' said Zoran Djindjic, president of the Democratic Party and one of Mr. Kostunica major policy makers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Djindjic said the Yugoslav government had only $410 million in foreign reserves, and was earning only $40 million to $50 million a month.</p>
        <p>Almost no companies or citizens pay income taxes; the chief source of revenue is income from state-owned firms and customs duties.</p>
