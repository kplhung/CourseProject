        <p>Worried that most public high schools are not good enough for their children, middle-class and affluent parents across New York City have begun campaigning for a return to the traditional neighborhood high school.</p>
        <p>The movement, based in affluent enclaves from the Upper East Side to Park Slope in Brooklyn and Riverdale in the Bronx, is led by parents who have been pioneers in rejuvenating elementary and middle schools that had been declining since the 1970's. These parents turned mediocre and even failing neighborhood schools into popular ones, where test scores are rising and students feel safe.</p>
        <p>Now, these parents and their children are looking toward high school and concluding that the system just does not measure up. New York City once had a system of zoned high schools, reserved for students who lived in the immediate neighborhood, from John Jay in Brooklyn to John F. Kennedy in the Bronx. But in the late 1960's, the boundaries of many of the zones were redrawn to promote racial integration, and the schools lost their distinct neighborhood character. The ties slackened more over the last 15 years, as the city moved to a system of choice, which allows students to apply to any high school regardless of where they live.</p>
        <p>But to create new high schools, the well-organized parent groups, backed by local lawmakers, are asking to exclude thousands of poor black and Hispanic students who travel long distances to attend schools now housed in the same buildings the wealthier parents covet. Even though the proposed schools would have substantial proportions of minority students, the parents fighting for new high schools, most of whom are white, face a quintessentially urban problem: their efforts have left them open to charges of elitism complicated by race, even though they say they are only trying to help their children.</p>
        <p>Similar movements are taking hold in other cities, like Cleveland and Omaha, as parents push for a return to neighborhood schools after three decades of court-ordered desegregation and busing, said Michael Casserly, executive director of the Council of Great City Schools, a coalition of the nation's biggest urban school systems, based in Washington. In response to parental pressure, Chicago has gone a somewhat different route, setting up a network of schools with screened admissions, like Stuyvesant High in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>''I think elementary school is wonderful,'' said Dr. Jeanne Kassler, a physician and the mother of two sons at Public School 6 on East 81st Street, the second-highest-scoring elementary school in New York City. ''The middle schools seem doable. Then it drops off a cliff.''</p>
        <p>New York has always had a few elite schools, which admit students on the basis of competitive examinations, as required by state law.</p>
        <p>But with New York City in the middle of a baby boom that has been barreling through the schools grade by grade, these parents say there are few high school options for ordinary middle-class children, especially those who cannot get into the exam-based schools, like Stuyvesant or the Bronx High School of Science.</p>
        <p>Not long ago, these families would have fled to the suburbs, or borrowed and saved to pay for private school. But now, the increased desirability of city life and the admissions squeeze in many private schools has spawned a demand for the return of the zoned neighborhood high school, a movement that would have been surprising just a few years ago.</p>
        <p>As depicted at meetings attended by hundreds of parents -- who say they represent thousands more -- and in glossy volumes studded with statistics and testimonials, the proposed new schools are intended to give the children of these residents an education on par with the best suburban high schools.</p>
        <p>Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy has met with some parents and lawmakers who are advocating new schools, but has made no public commitment to them. Other school officials said the proposals were ''potentially explosive'' and had to be considered carefully.</p>
        <p>Many of the neighborhood schools whose boundaries were expanded during the 1970's produced lackluster academic results, and the Board of Education began breaking them up into clusters of small schools with imaginative themes, known as magnet schools. By creating choices, officials hoped that middle-class families would return to the public schools and the schools would get better. But parents say that while the magnet schools may be better than what they replaced, they are still not good enough.</p>
        <p>The Partnership for an Upper East Side High School, as a group of parents based at P.S. 6 call themselves, has developed a 41-page proposal calling for a ''rigorously academic, college preparatory high school in our community.''</p>
        <p>''Despite paying the highest tax rates in New York City, we don't have a school that will prepare our children to go to the superior colleges they are qualified to attend,'' the document says.</p>
        <p>Anticipating the charge that parents are espousing an elitist school, the document goes on to say, ''Diversity comes in many guises.'' As examples of diversity, the document says that children on the Upper East Side come from a wide range of countries; that their parents include building superintendents, struggling artists and professionals; and that some families have been ''traumatized by divorce, illness and unemployment.''</p>
        <p>On Sept. 25, about 50 parents turned out for a meeting in a Hunter College auditorium to lobby for a new East Side high school. In an indication of the potential clout of these parents, most of the lawmakers who represent the neighborhood -- an assemblyman, a state senator and two Council members -- spoke at the meeting, offering at least rhetorical support for the school.</p>
        <p>''We want to help you keep your children within a 20- to 30-block radius of your home,'' said Assemblyman John Ravitz, urging the Board of Education to consider using the Julia Richman Educational Complex, at East 67th Street and Second Avenue, as a location.</p>
        <p>Once a failing traditional school, Julia Richman has been broken up into four small high schools and an elementary school, all in one building. Parents say it draws almost all of its students from the Lower East Side and East Harlem, and statistics published by the Board of Education show the most recent combined reading and math SAT scores for three of the high schools averaging 800 or less out of a possible 1,600. The fourth high school, the Urban Academy, does not disclose the SAT scores of its students.</p>
        <p>''In good conscience, I just couldn't send my kids to schools where they're averaging 800 combined'' on SAT scores, said Melanie Cissone, who has a fifth grader and a third grader at P.S. 6.</p>
        <p>Small-school advocates say that if parents are dissatisfied, the moral and responsible thing to do is to send their children to existing schools and try to improve them. Ann Cook, co-director of the Urban Academy, said,  ''Would you go to Dalton and say, 'Well, gee, you're serving kids from outside the neighborhood, we'd like you to stop'?''</p>
        <p>The first victory in the campaign was won this year by parents in Riverdale, an affluent section of the Bronx. For several years, parents had sought an alternative to the local high school, John F. Kennedy, with more than 4,000 students, abysmal test scores and a reputation for chaos. The Board of Education agreed to expand Middle School 141, a sixth- through eighth-grade school, to include grades through the 12th grade, beginning this fall. The change, to be phased in grade by grade, is expected to nearly double the proportion of white students, to at least 30 percent from 17 percent, but also exclude 200 students from nearby Marble Hill, a largely minority neighborhood.</p>
        <p>In Brooklyn, parents in the middle-class neighborhoods of Park Slope, Carroll Gardens and Cobble Hill are trying to reclaim John Jay High School. Last year, according to the community school district, only 220 of the district's 1,346 eighth graders enrolled in John Jay, on Seventh Avenue. Under a plan supported by the district and the teachers' union, John Jay would become a sixth- to 12th- grade school and eventually restrict students from outside the neighborhoods.</p>
        <p>In turning their back on the small magnet schools, parents partly  blame a decade-old admissions quota, now under review by the Board of Education. The quota was intended to promote equity, but parents say that instead it rewards students who do poorly and punishes the high achievers.</p>
        <p>The quota governs the city's magnet schools, which are often the only alternative to neighborhood high schools and which admit students by application. It requires these schools to select as many students -- 16 percent -- from the ranks of the lowest achievers as they do from the highest.</p>
        <p>On the Upper East Side, students who are rejected by the magnet schools they apply to, often because the quota has been filled, are automatically placed in the Bayard Rustin High School for the Humanities, on West 18th Street. It has average combined SAT scores of 861, out of a possible 1,600.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, competition to get into the specialized schools is ferocious. Last year, 23,339 students citywide took the test for Stuyvesant, and 846 were accepted.</p>
        <p>The report by the Partnership for an Upper East Side High School meticulously documents the failings of neighborhood high schools, using test scores from the Board of Education's annual school report cards. But it omits the pages of those report cards that detail the racial composition of the schools. A closer look hints at the complicated racial, political and educational questions that the movement to reclaim neighborhood schools raises citywide.</p>
        <p>Enrollments at the elementary schools that the East Side children attend are largely white -- 77 percent at P.S. 6, 67 percent at the Manhattan New School on East 82nd Street, and 58 percent at P.S. 158 on York Avenue. Even the hot middle schools, which draw from a much wider radius, have more white students than the citywide average of 17 percent: 58 percent at the Lab School for Collaborative Studies on Third Avenue, 51 percent at East Side Middle on York Avenue and 43 percent at Robert Wagner School on East 76th Street. The racial balance in the high schools is almost reversed, ranging from 19 percent white at Bayard Rustin to 3.7 percent white at the Richard Green High School of Teaching on East 88th Street.</p>
        <p>Parents bristle at the notion that they are being exclusionary.</p>
        <p>''Nobody's talking about opening up a school that will only be for anybody whose name is Schuyler or Buffy,'' said Jordan Bobby Brown, a writer and producer at ABC Radio who is African-American. He is the father of Sean, a seventh grader at the East Side Middle School. ''We're talking about people on the East Side who have middle incomes and need a neighborhood school.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  October 20, 2000, Friday  Because of an editing error, a front-page article on Oct. 11 about a campaign by New York parents for a return to traditional neighborhood high schools misstated the address of the Lab School for Collaborative Studies, a magnet school that draws students from all over the city. It is at 333 West 17th Street. Another Lab School, at 1700 Third Avenue, is an elementary school.</p>
