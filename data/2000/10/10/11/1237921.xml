        <p>Eighteen months after Sotheby's announced that it was joining forces with Amazon.com to run two separate online ventures, Sothebys.com and Sothebys.amazon.com, the beleaguered auction house said it would combine the two sites into one -- Sothebys.com.</p>
        <p>The online business was the brainchild of Diana D. Brooks, Sotheby's former chief executive, who on Thursday pleaded guilty to conspiracy to violate antitrust laws in collusion with Sotheby's archrival, Christie's. Ms. Brooks resigned from the auction house in February.</p>
        <p>Sotheby's also pleaded guilty on Thursday to violations of antitrust law and was fined $45 million. The fine came on top of another steep bill: its $50 million portion of a $512 million payment to settle claims that Sotheby's and Christie's had cheated buyers and sellers in a price-fixing scheme dating back to 1992.</p>
        <p>''The timing is unfortunate,'' said Craig Moffett, president of Sothebys .com. ''This has nothing to do with the Justice Department case.''</p>
        <p>Under the original agreement, Amazon invested $35 million in Sotheby's. It also agreed to buy one million shares of Class A common stock at about $35 each and purchased a warrant for $10 million to buy one million more shares of Sotheby's Class A shares for $100 each.</p>
        <p>Victoria Treyger, general manager of Sothebys.amazon.com, said Amazon's financial investment ''stays the same.'' But along with the consolidated sites has come a new financial structure. Sotheby's will now begin making what Ms. Treyger would only describe as ''multimillion-dollar cash payments'' to have the one site, sothebys.com, available on Amazon's home page. Amazon will also receive payments based on the site's performance.</p>
        <p>Sotheby's said that by the end of the year it would have spent $80 million on its Internet venture.</p>
        <p>Originally, Sothebys.amazon.com was conceived as the cheaper of the two sites, with lower-priced memorabilia and collectibles. Sothebys .com was to sell more expensive works, including works authenticated by its network of 5,000 dealers from around the world. Instead, Sothebys.com will sell everything from inexpensive memorabilia to fine art and antiques. The site will be accessible at www.sothebys.com and through www.amazon.com, where it will be featured on an auctions home page with Amazon's own auction site, which sells goods ranging from washing machines to baseball cards.</p>
        <p>The joining of the two sites is expected to take 30 days.</p>
