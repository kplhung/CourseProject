        <p>Kings and Gods</p>
        <p>From the South Asian courts of the 16th through 19th centuries come more than 70 paintings by artists supported by the rulers of premodern kingdoms. Elegant and detailed, these depictions tell of kings in their palaces or on the hunt, the many faces of love, and mythic gods. All are to be seen beginning tomorrow at the Asia Society in Manhattan in what is described as the first tour in more than 25 years of one of the most important collections of South Asian painting in the United States.

        <p>Different Harvest</p>
        <p>A time known as the Potato Holiday seems an unlikely occasion for a feast of culture, but that is precisely what is on the menu on Friday in Copenhagen. The Potato Holiday is said to have acquired its name in the days when children were freed from school to help with the harvest. Now on this first evening of an autumn vacation, they can reap culture. From 6 p.m. to midnight in the Danish capital, the doors of some 270 museums, galleries, exhibition halls, theaters and even Rosenborg Palace will be thrown open. Armed with a culture badge and traveling on special buses, adults and children will be able to hear live music, meet authors and savor the city's cultural riches.</p>
        <p>Age of Opulence</p>
        <p>From 1644 to 1912 China was ruled by the Qing Dynasty from the Imperial Palace in the heart of Beijing. Built in the early 15th century and known as the Forbidden City, this residence of emperors was a complex of palaces containing 9,999 rooms. Beginning on Saturday the throne and screen from the Hall of Supreme Harmony, a site of major ceremonies of state, will be among 350 Qing objects on loan from China through Jan. 24 at the Oakland Museum of California. Included in ''Secret World of the Forbidden City: Splendors From China's Imperial Palace'' are gold, silver, gems, silks,  paintings, ceramics and embroidered robes.</p>
        <p>Keys to the Future</p>
        <p>What's new? In contemporary music, one place to find out is at ''Solo Flights 2000,'' the four nights of piano concerts by five classical pianists starting at 7 tonight at the Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, between Dominick and Spring Streets in the South Village. Presented by the Composers Collaborative, the series, featuring Anthony de Mare, Jed Distler, Sara Laimon, Frederic Rzewski and Kathleen Supove, spans the years from 1910 to the 21st-century piano.  Tonight Ms. Laimon performs Ives and Copland at 7, and at 9 Mr. Rzewski's program includes his own ''De Profundis'' and the American premiere of ''Les Litanies d'Icare'' by Henri Pousseur.</p>
