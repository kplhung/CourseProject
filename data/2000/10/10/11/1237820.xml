        <p>As odd couples go, the new double feature of documentaries at the Film Forum is a reward and a delight created out of the sublime and the ridiculous.</p>
        <p>One half is ''The Red Stuff,'' a Dutch film that revisits the early years of the Soviet space program.</p>
        <p>The other is ''Total Balalaika Show,'' the Finnish filmmaker Aki Kaurismaki's record of the night of June 12, 1993, in Senate Square in Helsinki, where 70,000 people turned out to hear a concert that combined the talents of the Alexandrov Red Army Chorus and Dance Ensemble and the rock group known as the Leningrad Cowboys.</p>
        <p>Sublime in its involvement with the yearning of mankind to explore the heavens, Leo de Boer's ''Red Stuff,'' which draws upon the recollections of survivors among the 20 original cosmonauts and their families, constitutes a valuable record of the achievements, failures and political importance of the Soviet space program.</p>
        <p>At the same time, looking in the dawn of a new century at the elderly heroes whose exploits heightened international tensions and prompted parades, postage stamps, statuary, medals and heroic songs serves as a sharp reminder that little more than a generation has passed since the launching of Sputnik on Oct. 4, 1957, ushered in the space age.</p>
        <p>Mixing archival film with interviews, ''The Red Stuff'' tells the stories of the first cosmonauts, near-nerveless top-notch pilots like Yuri A. Gagarin and Gherman S. Titov chosen for a secret project. Shown in black-and-white film as young men and again in color as they appeared more than 40 years later, the survivors recount their training, their exploits and their reflections.</p>
        <p>There is film of great parades and receptions and there are accounts, oral and on film, of disasters: a cosmonaut and his redesigned space capsule reduced on re-entry to smoking rubble because the size of the parachute container was not increased when the parachute size was; the parachute never deployed. Or the vain efforts to resuscitate three cosmonauts whose air supply escaped on re-entry at 150 kilometers above earth rather than the intended, pressure-equalizing 5.</p>
        <p>Though lighter in tone, international politics also underlie ''Total Balalaika Show,'' in which Russia and Finland, once bitter enemies, are shown in a harmonious relationship.</p>
        <p>Dealing with the patently comic contrast between the stalwart Red Army Chorus with its massed 100 singers and 40 musicians in their heavy military uniforms and the clownish Leningrad Cowboys in hairdos and shoes that look like the battering rams of ancient triremes, Mr. Kaurismaki wisely lets the camera do his talking.</p>
        <p>The film has no narration, just an introductory segment detailing the signing of the contract for the performance and the performance itself.</p>
        <p>So here are songs like ''Happy Together,'' ''Delilah,'' ''Knockin' on Heaven's Door,'' ''Oh, Field,'' ''Kalinka,'' ''Dark Eyes'' and ''Gimme All Your Lovin' '' sung sometimes by the Cowboys, sometimes by the Army and its soloists and sometimes by both ensembles together.</p>
        <p>''Total Balalaika Show'' is something to hear -- and see.</p>
