        <p>Playful to the point of decadent, charming in their detail, sleek and bold -- the posters, brochures and magazine advertisements shown here represent some of the best of automotive art. Financed by big corporate budgets, these designs, spanning the years 1912 to 1958, were selling not just cars but also glamour, romance, modernity, success, happiness and the good life.</p>
        <p>They did so with an eye -- and sometimes more than an eye -- to the design and graphic trends of their times: the nod to Aubrey Beardsley, the use of white to create geometries of space, the formidable influence of the Bauhaus, the pervasiveness of all that was Art Deco in motifs writ large (and in poster primary colors).</p>

        <p>Playful to the point of decadent, charming in their detail, sleek and bold -- the posters, brochures and magazine advertisements shown here represent some of the best of automotive art. Financed by big corporate budgets, these designs, spanning the years 1912 to 1958, were selling not just cars but also glamour, romance, modernity, success, happiness and the good life.</p>
        <p>They did so with an eye -- and sometimes more than an eye -- to the design and graphic trends of their times: the nod to Aubrey Beardsley, the use of white to create geometries of space, the formidable influence of the Bauhaus, the pervasiveness of all that was Art Deco in motifs writ large (and in poster primary colors).</p>
        <p>These materials come from the collection of John Cohoe, a New York graphic designer who is also a founder of the Manhattan Studebaker Club. Mr. Cohoe grew up in Detroit, where his father was an automotive designer and his mother was an art teacher. He inherited his father's sizable collection of automotive advertising and literature, which spans the industry's first 60 years.</p>
        <p>The car was a relatively new phenomenon when many of these images appeared, and graphic designers of the time knew precisely how to capture the imagination of a public enthralled with the endless possibilities of individual motorized transport. What is surprising is the contemporary feeling of some of these materials, especially in their typography; the painterly look of others; and the overall quality of draftsmanship. You can feel yourself taking a spin through landscapes that never existed, except in someone's imagination. These artists, many of whom worked in anonymity for big corporations, understood the essence of timeless appeal.</p>
