        <p>The following is an arbitrary selection of 10 cars -- one from each decade of the 20th century -- that may appeal to potential car collectors. Current prices are for cars that are well restored or in good condition. Optional equipment, as well as the region where it is being sold, can affect prices, too. In each case, a current or previous owner has been asked to describe what's so special about the car. The owners' organizations listed with each car can provide more information.</p>
