        <p>The Giants had roughed up Atlanta Falcons quarterback Chris Chandler when he called a timeout midway through the second quarter. He jogged back onto the field, and his reward on the next play was seven Giants charging through the Falcons' offensive line. Chandler was slammed to the ground and sidelined for the rest of the game.</p>
        <p>It was the benchmark play in the Giants' 13-6 victory over the Falcons on Sunday, perhaps signifying a return to the aggressive, attacking style the defensive unit has exhibited in the past. But on this play, the defense got a little bit carried away.</p>
        <p>''The quarterback got hit so hard one time, I was like, 'I'm just so glad that's not me,' '' Giants linebacker Jessie Armstead said. ''I know he didn't want to get up, too. He didn't want to get up off the ground.''</p>
        <p>When Coach Jim Fassel was asked about the number of players sent in to blitz, he said: ''One time we had one too many. This is not an exact science.''</p>
        <p>Still, the Giants had the equation correct for most of the game. They sacked the Falcons quarterbacks -- Chandler and the former Giant Danny Kanell -- four times, after accumulating a total of five sacks through the first five games of the season. The Giants also limited Atlanta to only 13 yards on the ground, impressing themselves with their ferocity.</p>
        <p>''I'm quite sure that, win or lose, either way it went, if they would have won the game, they still would have said it was some hard hitting going on in that game,'' Armstead said of the Falcons. ''And they felt it and they would have remembered it all this week.''</p>
        <p>Getting to the passer was a necessity for the Giants, who rank 27th in the National Football League in pass defense, allowing 244.3 yards a game (225 yards to the Falcons). The Giants got sacks from the linemen Michael Strahan, Keith Hamilton and Cornelius Griffin, as well as from linebacker Pete Monty. But tackle Shaun Williams and linebacker Ryan Phillips also applied pressure.</p>
        <p>''We felt like that was a key thing,'' Fassel said. ''If we could get some pressure on the quarterback and do some things, we needed to stop the run game and not let them get going that way. I'm concerned about our pass defense. I don't think we're playing solid there. We made some plays. It was good to see a couple of picks. We needed that.''</p>
        <p>Armstead added: ''We had guys coming from everywhere making hard hits, and that gets respect. Any time you put pressure on the quarterback, it causes a lot of problems for the whole unit on the offensive side of the ball, and we caused a lot of problems. The quarterback, he got hit a lot of times. I mean hard hits, not just hits. It might have been better for him to take some sacks rather than the licks he took.''</p>
        <p>Not all the Giants were convinced that they had accomplished much against Atlanta, which had two rookie starters on its offensive line.</p>
        <p>''Yeah, against a team that hasn't scored a touchdown in two games,'' cornerback Jason Sehorn said of the Falcons. ''Perspective is needed.''</p>
        <p>Referring to the Giants' losses to Washington and Tennessee, Sehorn said: ''We've got to keep things in check and realize that our two big challenges, we failed. The teams that we should have beaten, we beat. The teams we needed to step up against, we didn't. You've got to keep that in the back of your mind.''</p>
        <p>But it was refreshing to see the defense carry the offense, which continued to struggle.</p>
        <p>''It makes no difference to me as long as at the end of the game we come out and we're winners,'' Sehorn said. ''I don't care if we win, 42-40. We won. I don't care who the dominant person is on this team. That's really splitting hairs at this point in time. The last time I checked, it's a team. The final outcome is a victory. That's the goal. Whether you're the side that's dominant or not makes no difference.</p>
        <p>''I don't concern myself with that,'' he said of the offense's troubles. ''The last couple years we concerned ourselves far more than we needed to concern ourselves and it didn't get us anywhere. So we'll let everybody take care of what they have to take care of. We'll let the people who need to be concerned be concerned. Right now, in our dictionary of how to be a football player on this team, it doesn't say to be concerned, especially not with somebody else's job.''</p>
