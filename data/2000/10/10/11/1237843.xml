        <p>THE name of the small sushi bar in Chelsea should have been a tip-off: Monster Sushi. But I was still surprised by what was put before me there.</p>
        <p>The sushi was huge, dwarfing the cylinder of rice under each piece. As I lifted a piece of fluke to dip it in soy sauce, one tapered end flopped away from the rice. Whatever this was, it was not sushi. It really was monstrous. I made notches on a chopstick to gauge just how big it was, then went home and laid the chopstick against a ruler.</p>

        <p>THE name of the small sushi bar in Chelsea should have been a tip-off: Monster Sushi. But I was still surprised by what was put before me there.</p>
        <p>The sushi was huge, dwarfing the cylinder of rice under each piece. As I lifted a piece of fluke to dip it in soy sauce, one tapered end flopped away from the rice. Whatever this was, it was not sushi. It really was monstrous. I made notches on a chopstick to gauge just how big it was, then went home and laid the chopstick against a ruler.</p>
        <p>The fluke was five inches long, twice as big as its two-and-a-half-inch roll of rice. The yellowtail was also five inches; the bonito was a full six inches. At four inches, the maguro was the shrimp of the bunch, except, of course, for the shrimp, which was only three inches but really couldn't help it.</p>
        <p>Monster Sushi is not unique these days. It doesn't even serve the biggest sushi in town. That honor most likely goes to Yama, a sushi bar with three locations in Greenwich Village and Gramercy Park, where everything I ordered was six to six and a half inches long, by my chopstick calculations.</p>
        <p>Such mammoth dimensions would seem to violate all the rules that characterize the Japanese art of sushi-making. Particularly with nigiri-zushi, the unit of fish and vinegared rice that is most familiar to Americans, the balance among vinegar, fish, rice and wasabi is considered crucial. Sawing through oversized raw fish with your teeth is virtually impossible. Unless you get out a knife and fork.</p>
        <p>''It's supposed to be a one-bite food,'' said Eisaburo Ishikawa, the owner of Salon Ishi on East 55th Street, voicing the traditional Japanese position. ''The top-quality places never serve you the big pieces.''</p>
        <p>Yet, more and more, you can find big sushi all over the city. It's big at Tomoe in Greenwich Village, at Iso and Sandobe in the East Village and at Haru, which has branches on the Upper East and West Sides. These are all mid-priced sushi bars, catering mostly to Americans, who have expressed their approval of big sushi over the last few years in the Zagat Surveys.</p>
        <p>The sushi at Yama, which received a 25 on the Zagat scale of 30, has been progressively described as ''mega-sized,'' ''whale-sized,'' ''Jurassic-size'' and ''orca-sized'' in Zagat Surveys. The sushi at Tomoe, which earned a 27 in the most recent survey, was once described as ''thick, mouthwatering slabs,'' and more prosaically, ''the largest proportioned.'' (Nobu, which ranks highest for Japanese food in Zagat, has a 28 rating but deals in classic proportions.)</p>
        <p>''It's the Americanization of sushi,'' said Wayne Nish, a co-owner and chef of March on East 58th Street, who has offered variations on sashimi on his menu. ''There is a phenomenon here.''</p>
        <p>I confess that in the past I've liked the sushi at Yama and Tomoe. I thought that these restaurants offered good value, but I've learned that delicacy, lightness and proportion are as necessary to good sushi as fine fish is. Otherwise, you might as well be eating one of those footlong hot dogs with a four-inch roll.</p>
        <p>The difference is apparent at sushi bars popular with Japanese patrons, like Sushihatsu on the Upper East Side, where every piece of fish was two to three inches long when I visited. The proportions of fish to rice were balanced and I could eat each piece in one delicate bite. At Sushi Rose on East 52nd Street, which also has a large Japanese clientele, the sushi is a little bit bigger, with some pieces more than three inches long. But again, it's one-bite sushi.</p>
        <p>Both places, which earn 23's in Zagat, are much more expensive than sushi bars that specialize in big. You could spend $125 at Sushihatsu and probably ingest considerably less protein than you would after paying  a third of that price at Yama.</p>
        <p>Clearly, there's a link between popularity and perceived value with big sushi. Yama's owner, Katsuyuki Kurosu, says his sushi is so big that he makes a very small profit. ''We have to serve a lot of customers,'' he said through an interpreter.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kurosu, who opened Yama in 1989 and began serving big sushi in 1991, acknowledges that he has adapted his style to suit Americans. ''The traditional Japanese style is very small, but I wanted Americans to be happy with the portions,'' he said. ''Americans want big, like hamburgers.''</p>
        <p>By its nature, sushi is a luxury item, and efforts to democratize it are bound to result in compromises. Yama does not serve big pieces of toro, the ultra-expensive, fatty portion from the tuna's belly.</p>
        <p>When it comes to eating habits and desires, of course, Americans are an easy target. Italians snicker at how Americans demand more sauce than pasta, just as Chinese laugh at how Americans order one huge dish per person and skimp on the rice that is actually the basis of the cuisine.  Clearly, Americans are having sushi their way as well.</p>
        <p>''I still see them dropping the fish in the soy, or using lots of wasabi, and I'm sorry to say we laugh at that,'' said Reiko Akehi, a Japanese food journalist based in New York. She also sees bigger problems than big sushi. ''Americans think that sushi is very, very healthy,'' she added. ''Maybe compared to hamburgers and pizza, but the soy has tons of salt and sugar.''</p>
        <p>As American as big sushi may seem to be, though, it is an issue in Japan, too, she said.</p>
        <p>''Even in Japan some places do serve that kind of sushi, but they're very cheap places, maybe for college students or people who don't care and just want a lot of fish,'' Ms. Akehi said. ''But if you go to nicer places, it's still served at its real traditional size.''</p>
