        <p>SURVEY any good-size newsstand and you will be struck by the amount of real estate taken up by ''niche'' automotive magazines. I'm not talking about Car and Driver or Road and Track; those are generalist books, uniting car enthusiasts across boundaries of time, category and brand. Nor am I concerned with hot-rod or classic-car magazines (too mainstream) or, for that matter, the many periodicals devoted to well-known single marques (Vette Vues, Hot VW's).</p>
        <p>No, if you want to grasp the full spectrum of choice open to the budding auto obsessive, you will need to follow me into the obscurer corners of automobilia, where the likes of Full Pull, Minutia, This Old Truck, Antique Power, ''Check the Oil!,'' PL8's and hundreds of other recondite journals thrive.</p>

        <p>SURVEY any good-size newsstand and you will be struck by the amount of real estate taken up by ''niche'' automotive magazines. I'm not talking about Car and Driver or Road and Track; those are generalist books, uniting car enthusiasts across boundaries of time, category and brand. Nor am I concerned with hot-rod or classic-car magazines (too mainstream) or, for that matter, the many periodicals devoted to well-known single marques (Vette Vues, Hot VW's).</p>
        <p>No, if you want to grasp the full spectrum of choice open to the budding auto obsessive, you will need to follow me into the obscurer corners of automobilia, where the likes of Full Pull, Minutia, This Old Truck, Antique Power, ''Check the Oil!,'' PL8's and hundreds of other recondite journals thrive.</p>
        <p>We define ourselves by the things we like. Today, with more and more things cluttering the world, the opportunities for passionate thing-bonding have multiplied almost out of hand. As subcultures proliferate, so do the magazines that are their glue, their lifeblood. Nowhere is this truer than in automobilia, where, according to Dave Brownell, the former editor of the car collector's bible Hemmings Motor News, the number of special-interest magazines is way up from a decade ago. ''And I'm amazed at how finely they're getting chopped up into smaller and smaller categories,'' he said.</p>
        <p>It's a matter of staking out a territory you can own. ''Some people collect pin-back buttons,'' he added. ''It's all the same urge.''</p>
        <p>So here are a few of the tools that help Americans shore up their fragile identities: magazines that give their readers the latest, hotly awaited intelligence on the Stassen for President buttons of the automotive world.</p>
        <p>Admittedly, Lowrider Magazine may not meet a strict criterion for obscurity -- its circulation is a healthy 250,000. But its subject, lowriding, remains little known to Northeasterners. More to the point, lowriding is outrageous. Anybody who has ever seen a classic lowrider glide past will not forget the sight.</p>
        <p>Lowriding was born in post-World War II Los Angeles, when young Mexican-Americans lowered their cars almost to the ground and painted spectacular murals on hoods, doors and roofs. Today it has become a cohesive force in working-class Chicano life. Lowriders are built either for performance -- outfitted with monster hydraulic systems that make them hop like kangaroos -- or built for display, exquisitely customized. (Ever seen an engine with gold-plated valve covers?)</p>
        <p>Reviled and suppressed early on, lowriding now supports a half-billion-dollar industry. Lowrider has more advertisements than it has half-clad women draped over '64 Impalas -- that is, a lot. And with its coverage of Mexican-American history and culture, it is more than just a car magazine, just as lowriding is far more than a hobby.</p>
        <p>I guess I would not be surprised if my effete East Coast friends were to find tractor-pulling absurd. But to its heartland enthusiasts, pulling is a great sport and outgrowth of honest rural life. The object, pure and simple, is to see how far a tractor can drag a really heavy weight -- if you want to call the things tractors. With their souped-up engines and candy-colored paint jobs, they look more like giant dragsters. Rear wheels shrieking, front wheels pawing air, they haul immense, weighted sleds down a dirt track as long as a football field. Now and then one of their engines explodes, spraying hot shrapnel into the stands. Just part of the sport, Bubba. You win if you go the distance. That's a ''full pull.''</p>
        <p>Which is actually the name of the self-proclaimed ''#1 Tractor Pulling Magazine in the USA.'' Full Pull is a family affair. The editor in chief, Photo Joe Egli, takes the pictures and writes the articles; his wife, Carol, handles the advertisements. Mr. Egli leaves no aspect of his beloved sport uncovered. In a recent issue, he profiled Mike Wolk, owner-operator of the 16-ton Busch Beer sled. Mr. Wolk explained how he got Busch to sponsor him: ''They said they were doing a study on family-oriented, grass-roots, high-beer-consumption events and thought tractor-pulling might just fit right in there!'' They got that right.</p>
        <p>Minutia is a tiny magazine for a tiny group of devotees of tiny cars: Isettas, Zundapps, Messerschmitts, Heinkels, Goggomobils and other micro- and minicars. (Micros have sub-500-cubic-centimeter engines; minis' engines are 500 to 1,000 cubic centimeters.) The best-known micro is probably the Isetta (liftable by four healthy teenagers). Some 10,000 Isettas were imported from Europe from 1955 to 1962; only 500 to 800 remain. Until size-happy American motorists change their ways, tiny cars will be a tiny minority.</p>
        <p>That's why Minutia, the quarterly magazine of the 900-plus-member Microcar and Minicar Club, is indispensable to its readers. It's where they come for parts, advice and consolation. (It's never easy loving an object of ridicule.) It also has an attractive whimsicality -- microcar enthuasists, unlike many car fanciers, have a sense of humor. (They need one.)</p>
        <p>Several leitmotifs emerge from the many personal accounts in Minutia, that the wee car obsession, for instance, strikes early in life. The editor, John Luttropp, was 6 when he acquired his first Isetta, a handsome red-and-white plastic model. As a teenager he pinned up a photograph of an Isetta and the attractive woman driving it. ''I think I had a crush both on the car and her all through my teen years,'' he confessed.</p>
        <p>THE magazines ''Check the Oil!'' and Petroleum Collectibles Monthly, published in Powell and LaGrange, Ohio, respectively, are frankly nostalgic, dedicated to ''petroliana'': the old-time filling station and its appurtenances.</p>
        <p>I prefer ''Check the Oil!'' for its folkloric, less exclusively thing-centered, bent, although things -- collectibles -- are, of course, its stock in trade. The October 1999 ''Check the Oil!'' has an article about Craig Landon, who began life pointedly uninterested in petroliana -- his father was in the oil business. Almost in spite of himself, Mr. Landon began stockpiling gas-station ephemera, and not just from anywhere --  no, from Associated, his father's old outfit.</p>
        <p>Today, Mr. Landon's home is bursting with objects bearing the famous Flying A: signs, gas pumps (which can easily cost four figures), gas-pump globes (ditto), display racks, oil cans, maps and a big, round, nicely crafted stained-glass Flying A window from a station that once stood at Market and Sanchez Streets in San Francisco.</p>
        <p>Mr. Landon is remodeling a '31 Model AA Ford into an Associated oil truck. In fact, he is remodeling his house -- someday his rec room will be a Flying A station. Success story or cautionary tale? Depends on whether you're a petroliana guy.</p>
