        <p>THE gentle rains still fall and the torrents of words still flow. Ireland is still Ireland. But the harshest winds of poverty and isolation blow no more; a new prosperity has utterly transformed the place in the last decade.</p>
        <p>You see the changes everywhere. Thousands of trim white weekend cottages, second houses for the well-to-do from Dublin and Cork, have sprung up along the coastline here in the southwest corner of the island. Temple Bar, once one of the scruffiest parts of Dublin, has been reborn as a Gaelic SoHo, full of bars, cafes and bistros thronged by exuberant young people flush with success.</p>
        <p>''When I was growing up in County Kerry,'' said Seamus Hogan, who cooks at Glin Castle in County Limerick, ''you heated up the pan for a couple of hours, then put the fish in and boiled it for a couple of hours. We hated it. But now you can eat as well in this country as almost anywhere in Europe.''</p>
        <p>Ireland no longer seems a nation of ''great hatred, little room,'' as it did to Yeats, and it is no longer an ''outcast from life's feast,'' in James Joyce's phrase. Its population is young and well educated, the windows of its economy have been opened to the world by membership in the European Union and a fragile peace has embraced Ulster.</p>
        <p>Tens of thousands of Irish men and women have returned from exile, lured by the prospect of good jobs. Home from London and Sydney and Toronto and Boston, where they or their parents or grandparents went in search of work, they have brought cosmopolitan tastes in food and drink with them. And so the global gastronomic revolution has come to the land of Guinness and Irish stew.</p>
        <p>Ireland's pastures, farms and seas produce sumptuous raw materials -- butter to challenge Normandy's best, lambs raised on grass as emerald in January as in July, boldly flavored (though disturbingly scarce) wild salmon, mussels from Bantry Bay and lobsters that taste like their Kennebunkport cousins.</p>
        <p>On a vacation trip to Ireland recently, Nancy Oakes, the chef at the much-admired San Francisco restaurant Boulevard, asked her host in southwestern County Cork whether she could sample some local cheeses at dinner. He produced several and said that all had been made within a mile of his house. Now that, Ms. Oakes said afterward, ''is what I call local.''</p>
        <p>A hip, handsome journal, Food &amp; Wine Magazine, caters to Ireland's hordes of hip, handsome trenchermen, as do the comprehensive guides to restaurants and to producers and purveyors of food turned out by the country's leading food critics, John and Sally McKenna.</p>
        <p>The wise traveler pays close heed to their recommendations. Rhapsodic reports to the contrary notwithstanding, stodge has not vanished from Ireland overnight. For every restaurant whose chef takes his cues from France or Italy, there are thousands where corned beef and cabbage reign alongside potatoes and bacon and where fish swim straight from the sea into oceans of white sauce. For every chef who succeeds in introducing fresh flavors and techniques, there are hundreds who come up with bizarre offerings like ''panini with blue cheese and blood sausage,'' which I spotted (but did not order) in a cafe in Dingle.</p>
        <p>No such nonsense for Willie Moran, one of Ireland's living national treasures, who raises plump, pearly hued gigas oysters right behind the thatched cottage where he shucks and serves them, dozen after dozen, with pint after pint of perfectly drawn Guinness. Naturally, the world beats a path to  Moran's Oyster Cottage, in Kilcolgan, a dozen miles southeast of Galway. But after the oysters and the stout and a few slices of homemade soda bread, only the brave tackle the seafood chowder. So work on your bravery before you go; the chowder is aces.</p>
        <p>Likewise, the pheasant and wood pigeon at the Mustard Seed at Ballingarry in County Limerick are shot in the surrounding fields, not farmed, and the beans and parsnips come straight from Daniel Mullane's big, bountiful kitchen garden.</p>
        <p>TALENTED chefs at Kenmare's two five-star hotels -- the very Victorian Park and the plenty-glossy-for-Vogue Sheen Falls -- have put it on Europe's culinary map. But my wife, Betsey, and I, alerted by knowing Irish friends, put ourselves in the hands of the O'Connell sisters when we and our appetites pulled into town during a 10-day Irish expedition last summer. It was a wise move.</p>
        <p>For lunch we ducked into the Purple Heather, a gussied-up pub where I ate the chicken liver pate of my dreams -- satin-smooth, a bit peppery, perfectly matched to the Cumberland sauce that came with it. Obviously homemade, like the whole-meal bread, also a paragon of its kind, and the shellfish soup. The place was jammed with tourists, businessmen, shoppers and a few toothless old-timers nursing pints of Cork-brewed Beamish Stout, the preferred tipple in southwest Ireland. All were made most welcome by the graceful Grainne O'Connell.</p>
        <p>The pate alone -- that and the noble headlands of the nearby Beara Peninsula, and Macgillycuddy's Reeks, Ireland's highest mountains, and Harold Peto's enchanted garden on Garinish Island, where plants brought from all over the world flourish under the benign influence of the Gulf Stream -- would have eventually lured me back to Kenmare, remote as it is. But that evening we discovered a snug bistro called Packie's, run by Grainne's sister, Maura Foley, that makes me long to head back next month, if not next week.</p>
        <p>A tiny, energetic woman, she took refuge there from grander places that she had made famous among serious eaters in western Ireland. Plain wood tables, candles, stone and rough plaster walls, a low ceiling and a winning waitress named Siobhan help to define Packie's, along with Ms. Foley's faithful adherence to the gospel of freshness and seasonality.</p>
        <p>''It's just a very simple menu,'' she cautioned as we sat down.</p>
        <p>Quite so, but the half-dozen dishes we sampled were all letter-perfect, with not a single detail left to chance, and not a single superfluous ingredient.</p>
        <p>Bite by bite, we were captivated. I started with pasta dressed with chanterelles, gathered in the adjacent countryside in the morning, and that incredible golden Irish butter. Having ordered an artichoke, Betsey was served something much more open and flowerlike than usual, with no metallic taste at all and a heart the size of a tennis ball.  Turned out that it had been grown by a white-haired gent who was having dinner over in the corner, and he told us proudly, when we said how good it was, that he had cut it just an hour or so before.</p>
        <p>Then came a darne of poached wild salmon with a bracing lemon hollandaise for me and a lobster for Betsey, both unmistakably fresh, manifestly from icy waters. We marveled at the technique (none of the sogginess that often mars poached fish) and the raw materials. (The lobster, which cost $26, put to shame the pallid creatures that cost twice as much in Paris and London restaurants.)</p>
        <p>There were French fries, twice cooked and crisp, of course, and a creamy puree of organic spring turnips with nutmeg. Betsey finished with some cheeses from County Tipperary, and I, ever gluttonous, tore into a scrumptious bread-and-butter pudding made with a locally baked loaf studded with dried fruit.</p>
        <p>Afterward, I mentioned to Ms. Foley that her approach reminded me of Alice Waters's. ''I've read every one of her books,'' she replied. I also asked her what she thought of the gilded hotel dining rooms in town. ''They put truffles on everything,'' she answered, and she didn't mean it as a compliment.</p>
        <p>The fountainhead of that kind of thinking in Ireland is of course Myrtle Allen, who for years has been building tradition with classical methods applied to prime local ingredients at Ballymaloe House in Shanagarry, east of Cork.</p>
        <p>In a gray Georgian manor house as low-key as a waltz, as old-fashioned as the dotted Swiss curtains on the windows and the Irish linen on the tables, she and her family continue to serve meticulous, timeless food: Bismarck herring and smoked eel, Cloyne beef with horseradish cream and French-fried onions, grilled cod with beurre blanc and buttered cucumbers, roast lamb with carrots Vichy.</p>
        <p>It is not easy to capture the spell that Ballymaloe casts. But it has a lot to do with the illusion -- and it is an illusion, of course -- that you are a guest in a house with an unusually accomplished cook. In a world of artifice, everything here is genuine. There is nothing at all commercial or institutional about the bouquets of sweet peas and lady's mantle on the tables, and the fisherman from Ballycotton who delivers the turbot and the prawns many days is the genuine article.</p>
        <p>But there are also other, newer directions in modern Irish cooking.</p>
        <p>In the seaside village of Dungarvan in County Waterford, not far from New Ross, where John F. Kennedy's family originated, Paul Flynn and his wife, Maire, have created a little corner of California. California-like in its blond wood, yellow walls and bright paintings, California-like in its eclectic cooking, their restaurant, the Tannery, is a laboratory of disciplined innovation.</p>
        <p>Born in Dungarvan, Mr. Flynn cooked in London for eight years for Nico Ladenis, a chef as tempestuous as he is talented. As Ireland prospered, with the help of grants from the European Union and investments from the United States, he came home and developed dishes like tempura sardines served with a warm mango, ginger and rocket salad. His macaroni of mushrooms incorporates oregano, chorizo cubes and pine nuts; he pairs the earthy flavors of scrapplelike blood sausage and confit of duck with crunchy undercooked green cabbage. Cloves are the secret ingredient that gives a surprising kick to his beets.</p>
        <p>In Cork, whose Covered Market displays all the local goodies alongside olive oils from Italy and cheeses from France, we stumbled across a little corner of bohemia called Cafe Paradiso. Like Greens in San Francisco, it is a vegetarian restaurant where only a churl would resent the absence of meat.</p>
        <p>Cafe Paradiso is not about virtue but about taste. Bright and buzzy, filled with boxes of books and toys, it has no travel posters, no sitar music and no brown rice. The menu ranges from roasted tomato soup with basil pesto to oyster mushrooms pan-fried in ginger butter by way of fritters, risottos, pastas, gratins, tarts, charlottes, salads and, to finish, a criminally rich fudge cake with ethereal orange sauce.</p>
        <p>DUBLIN, Ireland's only metropolis, offers the hungry wanderer a broad choice of restaurants along with a wealth of Georgian architecture and literary tradition. The most elegant is Restaurant Patrick Guilbaud, newly installed in an old town house next to the Merrion Hotel, and Michelin gives it two stars -- its only such accolade in Ireland. But Michelin would, wouldn't it? Guilbaud is a French restaurant, with a French chef. Most Dublin foodies give higher marks to Thornton's, which is locally famous for its roast suckling pig with stuffed trotter. Alas, we will have to take their word for it until next time; the weekend we were there, Kevin Thornton's establishment was fully booked.</p>
        <p>Not that we went hungry. One night we went to L'Ecrivain (what other city except Joyce's would name a restaurant ''The Writer''?), a chic two-level loft with waiters and waitresses in handsome gray and black. The service was overstressed and a little distracted, but the excellent Macon-Vire '96 from Thevenin was fairly priced and several dishes were first-class, including sweet, fat Bere Island scallops, with a kind of Oriental ratatouille. Clonakilty black pudding, a traditional blood sausage made with oatmeal, is inventively combined here with an apple compote and a cider and blue cheese sorbet, the acid in the apples and the cider balancing the richness of the pudding and the cheese.</p>
        <p>IT was June, high season for red fruits like strawberries, currants and raspberries, and Derry Clarke, the man in the kitchen at L'Ecrivain, combined several of them in a memorably summery-tasting dessert in a cup: a shortcake wafer on the bottom, topped by the fruits in a jelly that was barely set and capped with a little pool of cream. Very more-ish, as the British say.</p>
        <p>Another night we walked across the River Liffey from our hotel to the Ian Schrager esque Hotel Morrison, for dinner at its Halo restaurant. This is the hot-hot-hot playground of Dublin's young smart set, but we loved it anyway, despite the near anorexic ladies in black. We loved it most because Jean-Michel Poulot's fusion cooking is so painstaking and so versatile. His flavors are sometimes vivid, sometimes restrained, almost always satisfying.</p>
        <p>A coconut-chili-cucumber-prawn soup was fearlessly fiery. Light, skillfully formed dumplings filled with greens and mushrooms floated in a subtle gingery broth. And a dish of very French red mullet, served with a pistou made with purple Thai basil instead of green Genoese basil, was a model of intelligent crossover cooking.</p>
        <p>But our Dublin favorite, I am bound to admit, was a homely storefront cafe called the Mermaid opposite City Hall, with plain wood tables and floors, high-tech lighting and whitewashed siding. Sneak chic, you might call it. We went for brunch, and all the London and Dublin Sunday newspapers were spread out invitingly on the windowsills. The food was no less inviting, just the kind of imaginative but unpretentious stuff you're hungry for -- comfort food updated.</p>
        <p>Everything came in big, handsome white bowls. I had moist, tender smoked haddock from Frank Hederman, Ireland's top smoker, with creamed horseradish and mashed potatoes, a perfect mixture of smoky, sharp and bland flavors. Betsey had eggs Benedict, made not with the usual Canadian bacon but with a thick slice of five-spice ham, cured by Ed Hick, whom the McKennas' guides call Ireland's best pork butcher, and a tart rocket salad.</p>
        <p>We could not resist just a bite (five or six, to be honest) of the day's special, a notably silky slab of pan-fried wild Irish salmon, with pepper hash and sorrel mayonnaise. As a matter of fact, that could have been the theme song of our sojourn: we found it hard to resist wild Irish salmon any day, any way. But better that, I suppose, than another Guinness.</p>
