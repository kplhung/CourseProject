        <p>JOHN SONEFF'S first Hudson was a 1940 convertible in sea-foam green. He bought it almost new, for $1,055, from a Hudson dealer near his boyhood home whose address he can still rattle off as if it were right down the street.</p>

        <p>JOHN SONEFF'S first Hudson was a 1940 convertible in sea-foam green. He bought it almost new, for $1,055, from a Hudson dealer near his boyhood home whose address he can still rattle off as if it were right down the street.</p>
        <p>In 1949 he traded in that beauty for a new one, a Hudson Commodore 8 convertible. Now 73, a lifelong mechanic, car restorer and jack-of-all- trades, he says he spent 20 years looking for that first Hudson, hoping to restore it.</p>
        <p>Although he finally abandoned his search, he developed a passion for Hudsons, which were made from 1909 to 1957, and once he started buying them he didn't stop. Right now his collection stands at 18 -- half of them in his nine-car garage at home, the rest at a downtown garage where he restores them.</p>
        <p>''Nobody knows these held the stock-car record in races for over 20 years,'' Mr. Soneff said as he patted a shiny aquamarine 1954 Hudson Hornet. ''The reason was they could corner better.'' He lifted the hood and pointed out the six-cylinder engine. Even at 3,800 pounds, he said, it could go ''as fast as you want it to, maybe 110 miles per hour.''</p>
        <p>He pulled back a dust cloth to reveal a 1934 Hudson Terraplane coupe with suicide doors (so-called because they opened from the front, and you could fall right out as you pushed them open) and the original mohair interior. Under another cloth was a black 1938 Touring 8 Sedan with a fold-out table in the back seat -- a ''Mafia car,'' he called it.</p>
        <p>Many of these cars have a story: a glossy navy blue '51 Hornet that was his family's ''highway car'' because it came with air-conditioning and cruise control; his children having picnics on the oversize armrest of a chocolate-brown '52 Hornet; his wife squeezing up to eight children into similar models to ferry them to school.</p>
        <p>In the 40's and 50's, he remembered, if you had a Hudson you were king of the hill. ''These were good road cars,'' he said, inviting a visitor to climb inside and sink into the deep back seat. ''It's like sitting on a sofa. Not like these tin-can cars everybody has now.'' Nowadays, when he drives one home from the garage downtown, people ask, ''What is it?''</p>
        <p>The Hudsons he bought for $1,000 or so would now fetch as much as $40,000 fully restored, he said. But that is not what attracts him to them. ''If you've got paintings, you just hang them on a wall and you've got to look at them,'' Mr. Soneff said. ''What good is having them if you can't drive them?''</p>
