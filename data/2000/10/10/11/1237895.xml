        <p>In the battle for vote-rich Florida, the state's Republican Party has mailed pamphlets to older Floridians that accuse Vice President Al Gore of planning to force elderly people into a ''government-run drug H.M.O.''</p>
        <p>An official with the state Democratic Party said the pamphlet, with a cover showing an elderly person's hands gripping a prescription drug bottle, is misleading and is intended to frighten elderly voters.</p>
        <p>An official with the state Republican Party said the pamphlet, which was paid for and circulated by the party in the state, accurately portrays the vice president's drug plan.</p>
        <p>Both sides agree that the state's elderly are crucial in what has become a close contest for Florida's 25 electoral votes and that the pamphlet, and campaign tactics like it, highlight their importance in the general election.</p>
        <p>But Democrats say it is also a sign of what they called desperation on the part of Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican candidate for president.</p>
        <p>''It's a shame that they've gotten to the point of desperation, and gone beyond distortion in what they're saying,'' said Bob Poe, state chairman of the Democratic Party. ''If we win Florida, they can't win the White House. It's that simple. And they need the state worse than we do.''</p>
        <p>The pamphlet's cover says ''Open Al Gore's proposal, and you'll find . . .'' It opens to the words: ''Two bitter pills to swallow.''</p>
        <p>The pamphlet says that not only would Mr. Gore implement a plan that forces the elderly to join a drug H.M.O. that is ''selected by Washington,'' but also that he ''ignores Social Security.''</p>
        <p>The brochures were mailed over the last two weeks to voters in Tampa Bay, South Florida and other parts of the state.</p>
        <p>''It's absolutely on the mark,'' Jamie Wilson, executive director of the state Republican Party, said of the pamphlet. ''He would limit seniors' choices. And they should not be told by the government which plan they should use.''</p>
        <p>The pamphlet mirrors the message that Mr. Bush has delivered in Tampa Bay and other enclaves of the elderly, and the same message was the focus of a recent television advertisement shown in the state.</p>
        <p>But Democrats said the pamphlet was designed to frighten the elderly.</p>
        <p>Under Mr. Gore's plan, Medicare would add a voluntary prescription drug benefit, for which the elderly would pay a $25 monthly premium; lower income elderly would pay nothing, or a portion of the $25.</p>
        <p>Half of prescription drug costs, up to $5,000 a year, would be covered by the $25 premium, which would not have to be paid until 2002.</p>
        <p>By contrast, Mr. Bush's plan would allow elderly people to choose among several plans offered by H.M.O.'s or private insurance companies.</p>
        <p>The pamphlet distorts the truth in several places, Mr. Poe said.</p>
        <p>It reads that ''under Gore, you have only one chance to join -- at age 64 1/2 -- or you are left out forever.''</p>
        <p>Under Mr. Gore's proposal, people would have to choose to sign onto the  drug plan, just as they now must choose, at age 64 1/2, whether to sign up for Medicare Part B.</p>
        <p>Medicare Part A is a hospital insurance program for retirees and their dependents that covers most in-patient hospital costs. Part B is a supplementary insurance that covers outpatient services.</p>
        <p>The advertisement makes one strategic mistake, said Amadeo Trinchitella, a lifelong Democrat and political advocate in Broward County: it assumes that the elderly are politically unsophisticated, and easily fooled.</p>
        <p>''It's a sham, and the people will not be fooled,'' said Mr. Trinchitella, 82, a retired bar and restaurant owner from New York who now lives in Deerfield Beach.</p>
        <p>''These people lived through the Depression and the Holocaust,'' said Mr. Trinchitella of his condominium neighbors in Deerfield Beach. ''We know what gives.''</p>
