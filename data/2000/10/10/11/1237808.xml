        <p>MANY people are afraid to cook duck, and not entirely without reason. Roasting the whole bird long enough to release most or all of the fat dries out the meat, but undercooking leaves the leg meat tough.</p>
        <p>A common tactic is to roast the duck until the legs are tender, then make a sauce to compensate for the dried-out breast. But there is a simple two-step procedure that not only keeps the breast meat moist, but also makes the legs ultratender. First roast the duck, then braise it briefly. Add juicy sauerkraut to the pan for the braising, and the result will be a moist bird with a sauce that doubles as a side dish.</p>

        <p>MANY people are afraid to cook duck, and not entirely without reason. Roasting the whole bird long enough to release most or all of the fat dries out the meat, but undercooking leaves the leg meat tough.</p>
        <p>A common tactic is to roast the duck until the legs are tender, then make a sauce to compensate for the dried-out breast. But there is a simple two-step procedure that not only keeps the breast meat moist, but also makes the legs ultratender. First roast the duck, then braise it briefly. Add juicy sauerkraut to the pan for the braising, and the result will be a moist bird with a sauce that doubles as a side dish.</p>
        <p>Although the cooking takes some time, you can practically ignore the duck as it roasts. At a moderate oven temperature, it will brown more or less automatically while rendering its fat. You can make the process even easier by roasting the bird in the same pan you plan to braise it in; a Dutch oven or a deep 12-inch skillet will work perfectly.</p>
        <p>Once the duck is almost done, after about an hour, pour off most of the fat (or all of it, if you insist), and add the sauerkraut and some seasonings. Simmer everything gently for about another half-hour, until the sauerkraut is hot and the duck is cooked through. The skin will not stay perfectly crisp, but it will be nicely browned and not mushy.</p>
        <p>With the sauerkraut, seasoned with paprika and bay leaves, the duck has a relatively traditional Central European essence.</p>
        <p>The sauerkraut is important. The best kind is sold in bulk at shops like Schaller &amp; Weber in Yorkville in Manhattan, but there is perfectly good sauerkraut also available in jars or plastic bags in the supermarket. Just make sure the only ingredients are cabbage and salt; inferior sauerkraut contains preservatives, and the kind sold in cans tastes like tin. Even the best sauerkraut, though, should be rinsed before it is added it to the pan.</p>
        <p>The paprika, though it plays a minor role, does make a difference. There was a time when paprika was essentially red food coloring, but good paprika combines the flavor of roasted peppers without much heat.</p>
        <p>The duck itself is more of an issue. As everyone knows from sad experience, a single duck is too much for two people but provides only skimpy servings for four. If you want to make a meal for four, you can add side dishes, but there are a few one-pot solutions.</p>
        <p>One is to braise a piece of slab bacon or a pork chop or two along with the duck, adding the meat to the pan after the sauerkraut; the result will be a kind of choucroute garnie that is quite appealing. You can also peel and cut up some potatoes and cook them along with the duck and sauerkraut. With either of those, increase the cooking time a little.</p>
        <p>Or you can simply cook more duck -- start with two birds, or add a couple of duck legs. And if you are really feeling ambitious, sear a duck breast and serve the slices separately.</p>
        <p>ROASTED AND BRAISED DUCK WITH SAUERKRAUT  Time: 2 hours, largely unattended</p>
        <p>1 duck, about 4 pounds</p>
        <p>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
        <p>1 quart sauerkraut, rinsed</p>
        <p>2 teaspoons paprika</p>
        <p>1/2 cup dry white wine or water</p>
        <p>2 bay leaves.</p>
        <p>1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Prick the duck all over with a fork, then sprinkle it with salt and pepper and place it in a large, deep, ovenproof skillet or Dutch oven. Roast the duck for about 1 1/2 hours, checking occasionally to make sure it is browning steadily. (If the duck is barely browning, increase the heat by 50 degrees; if it seems to be browning too quickly, reduce the heat slightly.) When it is nicely browned and has rendered a great deal of fat, pour off all but a few tablespoons of the fat and transfer the pan to the top of the stove.</p>
        <p>2. Scatter the sauerkraut around the duck, then sprinkle it with paprika, moisten it with the wine, and tuck the bay leaves in. Turn the heat to low, and cover the pan. Simmer for about 15 minutes, then stir and put some of the sauerkraut on top of the duck.</p>
        <p>3. Cook another 15 minutes or so, until the duck is quite tender. Carve and serve.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
