        <p>IF Deutsche Bank's $1-billion-plus offer yesterday to acquire National Discount Brokers Group is any indication, there is a hot market for market makers.</p>
        <p>While National Discount Brokers' public face is that of an online brokerage firm, what makes it attractive as a takeover target is its profitable market-making unit, NDB Capital Markets. And banks seem to have a voracious appetite for buying up market makers of late, exemplified by Goldman Sachs' recent acquisition of Spear Leeds &amp; Kellogg and Merrill Lynch's takeover of Herzog Heine Geduld.</p>
        <p>Deutsche Bank is so interested in getting in on the market-making business in the United States that it is willing to pay $49 a share, a 94 percent premium, for the firm. While Deutsche Bank already owns about 16 percent of National Discount, yesterday's bid constitutes an offer for the entire company. The firm said it had not yet accepted Deutsche Bank's offer and was reviewing other offers, though it declined to cite where the other offers had come from.</p>
        <p>''Market making is increasingly becoming a game of large-scale players where second- and third-tier players will likely find it difficult to compete,'' wrote Mathew L. Veto, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, in a note to clients. ''These transactions highlight a trend among broker-dealers to try to internalize their order flow. Returns on capital in the market-making business are attractive, generally speaking, and to the extent broker-dealers can find a way to capitalize on the order flow they are already generating, all the better.''</p>
        <p>Shares of National Discount nearly doubled after the announcement, rising $22.44, to $47.69, in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares of Deutsche Bank slipped 2.74 euros, to 92.10.</p>
        <p>National Discount generates about three-quarters of its revenues from its market-making arm, making its online brokerage business just a tiny slice of its overall business. Analysts said the price tag was fair, especially considering that the firm is one of the last major market makers available. ''Based on recent acquisitions in the market-making area, Deutsche Bank's acquisition of N.D.B. appears reasonably priced in our view,'' said Richard H. Repetto, senior vice president at Putnam Lovell Securities.</p>
        <p>For Deutsche Bank, one impetus for the acquisition may also be competitive pressure in Europe from the likes of Merrill Lynch's electronic trading alliance with HSBC and the Charles Schwab effort to make a name in Europe as well. While National Discount's online brokerage business is not considered particularly strong by most analysts, it could serve as the basis for a more ambitious push into electronic retail trading in both in the United States and Europe.</p>
        <p>A possible acquisition could kick off even more deal-making in the market-making sector. The other still-to-be-acquired market maker that analysts speculate is available is the Knight Trading Group. Shares of Knight Trading, the biggest Nasdaq market maker and the one considered to have some of the most advanced technology, rose 63 cents, to $25.69, yesterday.</p>
        <p>Yesterday's offer could also jump-start a wave of consolidation among online brokers, which have generally languished recently because most of their earnings are tied to volume on the Nasdaq market, which is down markedly.</p>
        <p>Analysts speculate that ''pure play'' online brokers like the E*Trade Group and Ameritrade Holdings could be next in line to be swallowed up. Mr. Veto puts Ameritrade at the top of his list. Shares of E*Trade fell 69 cents, to $13.38, while shares of Ameritrade rose 50 cents, to $14.63.</p>
        <p>Deutsche Bank's interest in National Discount also further illustrates European banks' desire to gain a foothold in the United States. Deutsche Bank, which already owns Bankers Trust, has said it wants to capture a larger portion of the American banking pie. UBS, the Swiss bank, recently acquired PaineWebber, giving it a nationwide network of brokers to sell the stocks and mutual funds created by its investment bankers. Credit Suisse Group acquired Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, strengthening its United States investment banking practice.</p>
        <p>Whatever the impetus for these deals really is, it is clear that to banks across the Atlantic, Wall Street is still the most important market maker.</p>
