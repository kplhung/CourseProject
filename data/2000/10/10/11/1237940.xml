        <p>Representative Rick A. Lazio has mounted a nationwide television advertising campaign, running commercials on cable stations that ask people to call a toll-free number or go to his Web site to make donations.</p>
        <p>In what some experts called a rare if not unprecedented advertising push linking national ads to Web sites, Mr. Lazio, the Republican nominee for the New York Senate seat, has broadcast commercials on MSNBC, CNBC, the Weather Channel and Fox News Channel seeking donors in his bid to defeat Hillary Rodham Clinton, the Democratic candidate.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio's advisers would not say how much the national ad campaign had yielded, but said that they had paid about $140,000 for the campaign and that it has netted about $117 per contributor.</p>
        <p>While other campaigns have Web sites that allow people to charge their donations on a credit card, analysts say they believe this is the first that marries that strategy with a national advertising campaign.</p>
        <p>The ads have been broadcast sporadically during major political events like the Republican National Convention and, most recently, the debates between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Lazio. ''We produced what we believe to be revolutionary spots,'' said Mike Murphy, Mr. Lazio's media strategist. ''And it's been quite successful.''</p>
        <p>Darrell M. West, a professor of political science at Brown University who studies campaign advertising, called it ''a rare tactic,'' adding, ''I don't think any campaign has ever used it.''</p>
        <p>But he predicted that similar strategies would be limited to high-profile, big-money campaigns that can afford to spend a lot of money up front to cover the cost of television advertising.</p>
        <p>And having a candidate who incites emotions is key as well.</p>
        <p>''It's a strategy that would work for a Jesse Helms or a Ted Kennedy or, in this case, Hillary Clinton,'' Dr. West said.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the advertisement focuses on Mrs. Clinton. ''Hillary Clinton is raising millions of dollars in soft money,'' the announcer says in a reference to the largely unregulated, unlimited donations to political parties. ''From Hollywood liberals and big special interests to buy a U.S. Senate seat in New York.''</p>
        <p>After a campaign stop in Rochester today, Mr. Lazio did not appear to know any details about the ads. But he suggested that access to the Internet could serve as an equalizer.  ''We're asking people to donate to the Web site,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Later, Mr. Lazio elaborated: ''We should be looking for ways for the ordinary citizen to participate, not stuffing $500,000 checks in our pockets from West Coast concerns,'' he  said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio has held fund-raisers in other states and sent out solicitation letters to woo donors outside of New York. But this is the first time he has taken to the airwaves to search for funds across state lines, his campaign staff said. Mrs. Clinton is not running similar television ads.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio's associates said today that the campaign was paid for and took in hard money only.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio and Mrs. Clinton have agreed to ban the use of soft money for advertising and have asked independent groups not to advertise on their behalf or against their opponent. Mr. Murphy said the latest airing of the advertisement was not related to the soft money deal but rather was intended to feed off the attention on the race that was expected for the candidates' second debate, last Sunday.</p>
        <p>The campaign did not release this ad, as it had other ads, until today when reporters asked about it. Mr. Murphy said the campaign did not announce the commercials out of fear that other campaigns, particularly Mrs. Clinton's, would copy the tactic. ''Just like McDonald's doesn't give away the secret of its special sauce,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But Mrs. Clinton's staff sought to make an issue out of the advertisements, accusing the Lazio camp of a pattern of secrecy around fund-raising. Howard Wolfson, Mrs. Clinton's chief spokesman, said the advertisement was in line with a fund-raising letter in July, critical of Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Lazio said at first that he did not write the letter, but later he took responsibility for it.</p>
        <p>''It's time for Rick Lazio to come clean about his secret fund-raising  strategy and release all of his fund-raising ads and letters immediately,'' Mr. Wolfson said. ''In the summer Rick Lazio said he didn't write a negative fund-raising letter that he signed. Now he claims that he doesn't know about a negative fund-raising ad that has been running for nearly two months. How can New Yorkers trust Rick Lazio when he won't own up to his negative campaign?''</p>
        <p>Earlier today, Mrs. Clinton appeared on ''The Rosie O'Donnell Show,'' and then headed to a preschool in Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>She said that she had done what she could to push for the United States to veto a resolution in the United Nations Security Council censuring Israel for the violence in the Middle East. Mr. Lazio's campaign argued that Mrs. Clinton was trying to have it both ways in criticizing a policy that was being aggressively pursued by President Clinton.</p>
        <p>''I just have a disagreement about the best way to proceed -- both to secure Israeli security and get the parties back to the bargaining table,'' Mrs. Clinton told a jostling crowd of photographers and reporters. ''I've expressed my views on that.''</p>
        <p>She added, ''Sometimes the administration agrees with my views and sometimes it does not.''</p>
        <p>''That has been the case for eight years now,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio's campaign, meanwhile, moved to highlight the difference on the policy between the first lady and her husband. Toward that end, the campaign issued a news release citing a quotation by former Mayor Edward I. Koch that appeared in an article in The Washington Times. Mr. Koch, perhaps Mrs. Clinton's most prominent Jewish supporter, was quoted as criticizing the Clinton administration for its abstention and saying that Mrs. Clinton should have fought harder to change the president's mind.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Koch said yesterday that after studying the situation, and talking to some Middle East experts, he had changed his mind, and now believed that the administration had done the correct thing in abstaining. A veto, Mr. Koch said, echoing what has been the dominant argument of the United States, could have undercut the United States' bargaining position and encouraged a new spasm of violence.</p>
        <p>Which is not to say that Mr. Koch was now prepared to attack Mrs. Clinton for urging a veto of the resolution. ''I don't condemn either Hillary or Lazio, because I might be wrong,'' Mr. Koch said in an interview. ''But based on what I know, I've concluded that the president is right.''</p>
