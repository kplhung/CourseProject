        <p>Garry Kasparov cracked under pressure and lost Game 2 of the Brain Games Network World Chess Championship to Vladimir Kramnik in London yesterday. That gives Kramnik the lead by 1 1/2- 1/2.</p>
        <p>Kasparov flamboyantly sacrificed a pawn for active counterplay, but the resultant complications were more than he bargained for. Kramnik took it and gave it back, but parlayed it into superior piece play. Perhaps Kasparov had a way out, but didn't trust it.</p>

        <p>Garry Kasparov cracked under pressure and lost Game 2 of the Brain Games Network World Chess Championship to Vladimir Kramnik in London yesterday. That gives Kramnik the lead by 1 1/2- 1/2.</p>
        <p>Kasparov flamboyantly sacrificed a pawn for active counterplay, but the resultant complications were more than he bargained for. Kramnik took it and gave it back, but parlayed it into superior piece play. Perhaps Kasparov had a way out, but didn't trust it.</p>
        <p>Instead, he tried to take refuge in the drawish possibilities inherent in  bishops of opposite color, but Kramnik showed fine technique and refused to let him off the hook. At the end, a flustered Kasparov made a terrible mistake and aborted whatever defensive chances he might have had.</p>
        <p>There is a total of 16 games, so there is time for Kasparov to recoup. In these first two games, however, Kramnik has given no indication that there are any chinks in his armor.</p>
        <p>Game 3 is scheduled for tomorrow.</p>
        <p>In the early years of the Gruenfeld Defense in the 1920's, its key move, 3  . . . d5, was considered heretical in leaving the pawn center in White's hands after 4 cd Nd5 5 e4 Nc3 6 bc, but this mode of play is lively and aggressive. It aims to make the point that attack by pieces can reveal difficulties in White's maintenance of his pawn front.</p>
        <p>After 9 Qd2, the endgame that Black can get with 9 . . . cd 10 cd Qd2 11 Nd2 may be slightly in White's favor. Kasparov preferred 9 . . .  Bg4!? 10 Rb1 a6 (the threat was 11 Rb5), sacrificing a pawn to 11 Rb7.</p>
        <p>Kasparov got his pawn back with 15 . . . Bd4, but he still had difficult problems to solve. After 16 Bd5 Bc3 17 Qc1, he might have tried 17 . . .  Rac8 18 Bb6 Qb4 19 a3 Qb2 20 Qb2 Bb2 21 Rb1 Ba3 22 Ra1 Bd6 23 Ra6 Nb4, when the pawns are even and all on the same side of the board. He would also have been able to exchange off one of the strong white bishops.</p>
        <p>Instead, he put his faith in the drawing chances of bishops of opposite color that arose after 17 . . . Nd4 18 Bd4 Bd4, even though he was down a pawn again after 19 Re7.</p>
        <p>The clever point of Kramnik's 25 Re1! was that after 25 . . . Qf4 26 Qf4 gf, he had the powerful thrust 27 e6! fe 28 Re6, attacking the a6 pawn. It had to fall because 28 . . . a5 is vulnerable to a discovered check with 29 Ra6.</p>
        <p>Kasparov blundered with 39 . . . Ke7? and after 40 Bd5, he could not avoid losing a piece to 40 . . . Re2 41 Re6 Kd7 42 a6 Re3 43 a7 Ra3 44 Re5 and so, gave up.</p>
        <p>But if he had played the correct 39 . . . Kg7, he would still have been under the hammer from Kramnik's powerful passed a pawn, and if could have barricaded it with his rook and bishop, it is doubtful that he could have defended against an invasion by Kramnik's king on the other flank.</p>
        <p>In the list of moves accompanying Monday's article on the first match game, White's third and seventh moves were given incorrectly. The third move was Bb5, not Bg5, and the seventh move was de, not dc.</p>
