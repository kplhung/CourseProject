        <p>AS far as restaurants go, Park Slope has been an easy target for derision, the Upper West Side of Brooklyn, to cite another deprived area. But now, things are looking up.</p>
        <p>Rose Water, a petite restaurant just off Sixth Avenue, has provided a jolt of excitement to its residential neighborhood since opening about a month ago. Its innovative cooking, moderate prices and relaxed ambience would be exciting anywhere.</p>
        <p>The owners, John Tucker and Neil O'Malley, met at Savoy, the SoHo restaurant that helped lead New York in the exaltation of fresh, seasonal ingredients. Mr. Tucker was general manager there while Mr. O'Malley worked as a sous-chef.</p>
        <p>Mr. O'Malley ranges through the Mediterranean and sometimes beyond to achieve his flavors, which are always intriguing, though they occasionally miss. Even the basket of house-made bread is unusual, with corn bread flavored with bittersweet fenugreek; a flat, unleavened bread stuffed with cheese like an Italian piadina; and my favorite, pita dusted on the inside with a fine reddish substance that I was told was paprika and powdered cherry pits. Who knew?</p>
        <p>Lovers of esoterica will find much to ponder. Tatsoi, a delicate Asian green, appears in a fine frisee salad ($5.50) with fingerling potatoes and grapes so black I took them for olives. In another excellent salad, tender greens are arrayed over sweet Chioggia beets accented with feta cheese and crisp shallot strands ($5). A brik ($5.50) is a crisp North African turnover that Mr. O'Malley fills with ground lamb, caraway and mint and surrounds with a pungent parsley sauce.</p>
        <p>Fattoush ($6), a Middle Eastern bread salad, is not nearly so exotic, unless you add chanterelles, as Mr. O'Malley does, with black-eyed peas, watercress and a light, lemony lavender dressing. I almost loved the appetizer of flavorful scallops ($6.50), but they were set on sweet roasted butternut squash, which didn't meld so much as intrude.</p>
        <p>Rose Water offers a pork chop with a fabulous flavor ($16.50), crusted on the outside and served with sweet, lemony apple chutney and broccoli rape. I didn't know what to expect of a thin-sliced rump steak flavored with cloves and served over roasted hot and sweet peppers ($14.50), but it worked, the robust flavors of the peppers and the beef paving the way for the cooling finish of the cloves.</p>
        <p>Striped bass ($15.50) goes beautifully with charmoula, a Moroccan blend of coriander, garlic, lemon and other spices. Braised oxtails ($13.50) are tender enough, but play second-string to their partner of fried yucca in a bright and spicy sauce of tomatillo and jalapeno.</p>
        <p>I've always found vanilla to be too powerful for savory dishes, and even though Mr. O'Malley tries to balance it with a juicy grilled chicken breast, lovage and corn ($14), it was still too obtrusive for me.</p>
        <p>The brief wine list includes some intelligent, moderately priced choices, but desserts ($5.50 each) need work. Yellow cake with icing flavored with rose water was exceedingly dry, as was a chocolate cake. A special of plum crisp was delicious, except for the basil-flavored whipped cream, which provoked expressions of disbelief at my table. Sounder choices would be house-made yogurt with sweet-as-honey rose hip preserves, or a plate of artisanal cheeses ($6.50).</p>
        <p>Except for the desserts, I was impressed by the execution at Rose Water. Almost everything was beautifully prepared, and even the dishes I didn't like were, at the least, lively, a quality Park Slope restaurants can use in abundance.</p>
