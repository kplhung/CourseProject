        <p>When he died in 1995, Seymour B. Durst owned so many books, maps, postcards, pamphlets, newspaper clippings and brochures about New York City that his five-story town house on East 61st Street was bursting at the seams. Just eight years earlier, he and his books had outgrown a four-story brownstone on East 48th Street.</p>
        <p>Visitors to both houses described finding books on the stairs, in the refrigerator and even in the bathtub, lovingly arranged by topic and by room according to a quirky system that came to be dubbed the Durst Quintessimal System.</p>
        <p>Last month, Mr. Durst's wide but idiosyncratic collection, known as the Old York Library, took up residence at the City University of New York's Graduate Center at the old B. Altman department store at 34th Street and Fifth Avenue. It was the gift of a family foundation that wanted above all to honor the late Mr. Durst's wish to keep his 10,000 books, 20,000 postcards, 3,000 photographs and stacks of other New Yorkiana together under one roof.</p>
        <p>In his professional life, Mr. Durst, president of the Durst Organization and a patriarch of one of New York's famous real estate dynasties, was known as an assembler who packaged blocks and lots for future development, mostly in Midtown Manhattan. The family firm changed the face of the East 40's on Third Avenue and stretches of Avenue of the Americas and Seventh Avenue. His daughter, Wendy Durst Kreeger, said he assembled his collection, which came to include everything from monographs to lithographs, in much the same way.</p>
        <p>''My father used to say, 'I don't love New York: I have a strong interest in New York because I am a developer here,' '' she recalled. ''He was interested in the city's infrastructure because it impacted him as a developer. It was the city where he lived and where he worked.''</p>
        <p>It all began in the 1960's, when Mr. Durst found a book in Paris about New York City by a German photographer that made him realize that the city where he had grown up, that he and his brothers and their father before them had helped build, was a subject of worldwide fascination.</p>
        <p>Mr. Durst had a way of making his voice heard in New York. When he began to fret about the size of the national debt, he put up a national debt clock at Avenue of the Americas and 43rd Street. When he found that his letters to the editors were not getting printed with any regularity, he took out paid advertising space at the bottom of the front page of The New York Times in which he would air quips and gripes. He cut his own hair, wore comfortable old clothes and walked to most places, including  the city's secondhand bookstores,  which he would leave laden down with bags of books.</p>
        <p>''He had answers,'' Ms. Kreeger said, ''and he was frustrated when he was not being listened to. He was quirky, and the collection reflects that, which is one of the things that makes it great.''</p>
        <p>For the consummate assembler of properties, Mr. Durst nonetheless kept a warm spot for the developer's nemesis: in 1984 he wrote a book called ''Holdouts!'' with Andrew Alpern.</p>
        <p>''He appreciated these quirky people,'' Ms. Kreeger said.</p>
        <p>Scholars who used to go to the town house to do their research came to appreciate the purpose behind Durst's unusual cataloging system, which distributed material according to topic, leaving visitors to wend their way from the Biography Room to the Architecture Closet. Madelyn Kent, curator of the collection, described it as a ''reader's and researcher's dream, and a librarian's nightmare.'' The collection is especially strong in the history of New York zoning, real estate and infrastructure.</p>
        <p>Carol Willis, founding director of the Skyscraper Museum on Maiden Lane in Lower Manhattan, used the Durst collection extensively when she was preparing her museum's first exhibition. ''It was a very entertaining intellectual exercise for academics like myself,'' said Ms. Willis, who spent hours in the 61st Street town house in the summer of 1996. ''It was a great delight to be able to have the luxury to explore somebody's collection, and the inside of somebody's head, to see how someone who knew and loved his subject would collect material.''</p>
        <p>His daughter said: ''He didn't see himself as a collector. He thought of collectors as people who collected books and left the pages uncut. He assembled the books for the information within their pages. He wanted them used.''</p>
        <p>Putting the collection to wider use was the main reason that the Old York Foundation, with its $2 million endowment, chose to bequeath the Old York Library to CUNY's Graduate Center, where it has been given a place of honor and is open to the public by appointment. A reading room, a tidy approximation of a room in the old Durst town house, has been created on the first floor, where Mr. Durst's favorite books are  displayed in glass-enclosed bookcases. Among the many prizes are a 1776 edition of Thomas Paine's ''Common Sense'' with notes written by Paine in the margins; a six-volume first edition of I. N. Phelps  Stokes's pre-World War I ''Iconography of Manhattan Island'' with its definitive maps and cityscapes; a collection of Jacob Riis's landmark books on poverty in New York; biographies; novels; social surveys; even books like ''The Witches of New York'' and ''Bicycles for Ladies.''</p>
        <p>Downstairs in the basement, another room has been set aside to house the rest of the collection, which includes the photo morgue of the old New York Herald, bound editions of Harper's Weekly, boxes of rare political pamphlets and theater playbills,  municipal documents and directories, and those 20,000 postcards, of which about one-third have messages scrawled on the back, providing a century's worth of fleeting impressions of the city.</p>
        <p>Now, the library also has a second life in the Graduate Center's New Media Lab's Web site (www.oldyork  library.org). Later this fall there is to be a special exhibition called ''Disaster!'' that will bring some of the city's worst crises -- from the draft riots of 1863 to the blizzard of 1888 -- back to life with period drawings and firsthand accounts, animated by computer designs.</p>
        <p>The effort ties into the Gotham Center for New York City, another new initiative at the Graduate Center that focuses on the city's history, through a lecture series and other programs. ''There is a whole set of things happening here,'' said Stephen Brier, associate provost at the Graduate Center. ''I hate to use the word, but there is an enormous synergy in terms of being able to make more material more widely available.''</p>
        <p>Scholars and students say they especially treasure the hands-on possibilities of the Durst collection, where they can poke through stacks of primary sources, and make unexpected discoveries.</p>
        <p>When she first began research on ''Art and the Empire City,'' the Metropolitan Museum of Art's current  show on New York City during the mid-19th century, Medill Harvey stopped first at the Durst collection at the suggestion of Kenneth T. Jackson, the Columbia University historian and editor of the ''Encyclopedia of New York City.''</p>
        <p>''What was most useful about it was that it had material relating to New York all in one place,'' said Ms. Harvey, an assistant researcher in the department of American decorative arts. ''And it gave me chance to sit in a dining room and go from a biography of De Witt Clinton to census material on New York in 1850 without having to call up books from different divisions from different libraries. I spent many hours sitting at that dining room table. It was a great opportunity.''</p>
