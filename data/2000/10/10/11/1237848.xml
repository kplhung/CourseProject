        <p>FRANCE: ULTIMATUM TO MONACO -- France has issued an ultimatum to Monaco: the Riviera principality famous as a tax haven for the world's super rich must either quickly agree to clean up shady banking practices or France will enact legislation forcing it to do so. The threat came as the Finance Ministry issued yet another report accusing Monaco of concealing vital information about secret bank accounts and suspected money laundering. Monaco uses the French franc and its banks come under the supervision of the French banking system.</p>

        <p>ITALY: CARDINAL FACES NEW CHARGES -- Prosecutors are investigating new charges of real estate fraud against Cardinal Michele Giordano, archbishop of Naples, who two years ago was indicted along with his brother and nephew on charges of loan-sharking and graft. Cardinal Giordano, who remains in office, has denied any wrongdoing. The Vatican did not comment on the new allegations.</p>

        <p>RUSSIA: SOLDIER'S DEATH CONFIRMED -- A Russian border guard was killed and five other soldiers were wounded in a firefight on Tajikistan's border with Afghanistan over the weekend, the Russian military confirmed. About 20,000 Russian Army and border troops, along with Tajikistan Army forces, patrol the border, near where the Taliban made military gains this fall. It was not immediately clear whether the skirmish involved Taliban fighters or Afghan drug traffickers, who operate in the region.</p>

        <p>RUSSIA: NAVAL EXERCISE CALLED OFF -- Russia's navy commander said he had indefinitely postponed a major exercise that would have sent a Russian aircraft carrier task force to the Mediterranean for the first time in years. Adm. Vladimir Kuroyedov did not cite a specific reason, but the navy has been overwhelmed by investigations and inspections in the wake of the sinking of the nuclear submarine Kursk.</p>

        <p>SPAIN: NATIONAL PROTEST -- Thousands of people gathered at midday outside city halls and courthouses across the country in a five-minute silent protest against the killing of a senior prosecutor, gunned down by suspected members of the Basque separatist group E.T.A. Authorities said Luis Portero, 59, was the 14th person killed by E.T.A. since the group abandoned its unilateral cease-fire at the end of last year.</p>

        <p>INDIA: PREMIER GETS NEW KNEE -- The worn-out left knee of Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee, an arthritic joint that has received enormous attention in recent weeks, was successfully removed and replaced with a substitute of metal and plastic. Mr. Vajpayee, 75, was given a local anesthetic and came out of the hourlong surgery in good shape, said Dr. Chittaranjan Ranawat, the New York surgeon who performed the operation.</p>

        <p>INDONESIA: SUHARTO SON MUST STAY -- Fearing that former President Suharto's convicted son may flee the country, the attorney general has banned Hutomo Mandala Putra, known as Tommy Suharto, from leaving Indonesia for a year. Mr. Hutomo, who was sentenced to 18 months in jail for corruption, remains free while his plea for clemency is being processed, although President Abdurrahman Wahid has ruled out a pardon. Mr. Hutomo's many corporate planes and helicopters have already been seized.</p>

        <p>LIBYA: ENVOYS TELL OF ATTACKS ON BLACKS -- Gangs of Libyans beat up young black Africans, with at least six confirmed dead, when authorities called last week for a crackdown on employment of foreigners, diplomats said. ''All black Africans were singled out whether they were law-abiding immigrants, illegal or legal workers, honest or dishonest people,'' a senior Western diplomat said. In the first official reaction to the attacks, on Monday, the Libyan leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, blamed ''hidden hostile hands'' for the violence.</p>

        <p>IRAN: DEADLY PROTEST -- A 17-year-old boy has died in three days of demonstrations in Ajabshir, northwest Iran, over demands for better public services, the daily Qods reported. The paper quoted the top cleric in Ajabshir as saying the protests broke out over demands for a better telephone service.</p>

        <p>PERU: NATIONAL STRIKE -- Starting a two-day national farm strike, hundreds of peasants carrying corn plants marched in Lima and Arequipa to protest government agricultural policies. There were reports that other protesters blocked the main coastal highway north and south of the capital to stop commerce. In a move to head off the strike, Economy Minister Carlos Bolon disclosed a plan to issue more than $300 million in bonds to compensate farmers whose land was seized in the late 1960's under a leftist government led by Gen. Juan Velasco Alvarado.</p>

        <p>ETHIOPIA, ERITREA: CLEARING MINES -- The United Nations began clearing mines from the Ethiopia-Eritrea border to ensure the safe deployment of its peacekeeping force, the United Nations Mission for Eritrea and Ethiopia said. The Halo Trust, a charity registered in Britain and the United States, began surveying Ethiopia's Tigray region this month in cooperation with the Ethiopian authorities. They found cluster ammunition, aerial bombs as well as unexploded ordnance and minefields, the mission said.</p>
