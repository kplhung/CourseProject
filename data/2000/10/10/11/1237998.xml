        <p>Seattle Manager Lou Piniella walked to the mound. Freddy Garcia was waiting there for him. Joe Oliver, too. Arthur Rhodes was out in the bullpen behind the left-field fence warming up. He was ready.</p>
        <p>The Yankees' Chuck Knoblauch was at second base after drilling a double to left field. Derek Jeter was at first. He got there by walking, after Garcia had struck him out the first two times they tangled.</p>
        <p>Paul O'Neill waited in the on-deck circle, but Manager Joe Torre called him to the dugout.</p>
        <p>''I didn't know if Lou was going to bring in the left-hander,'' Torre said later, explaining his brief chat with O'Neill. ''So I called Paul back and just gave him some scenarios that I was thinking about. Paul has bunted before. We talked about several things.''</p>
        <p>It was the sixth inning of the first game of the American League Championship Series between the Yankees and the Seattle Mariners, and the Mariners were leading, 2-0. The Yankees had only three hits against Garcia, but they were threatening and Piniella had a decision to make.</p>
        <p>''Lou wanted to find out how I thought Freddy was throwing,'' Joe Oliver, the team's veteran catcher, said. ''He asked Freddy how he felt. Freddy was fine. I thought he still had a lot of movement left on his pitches.''</p>
        <p>So did the pitcher. ''I was feeling pretty good and I had a lot of confidence,'' Garcia said.</p>
        <p>So did the manager. ''I felt that he still had really good stuff,'' Piniella said. ''His pitch count was low. He's got that good hard sinker that can get a double-play ball.''</p>
        <p>If he had seen something when he reached the mound, Piniella added, he might have considered bringing in Rhodes.</p>
        <p>''He was in the bullpen ready to come in,'' Piniella said. But, he added of his visit to Garcia, ''I felt all along that when I went out there that I'd get the response that I got.''</p>
        <p>Rhodes is the Mariners' top left-handed reliever, and the Yankees had, among the next three batters, two left-handed hitters and a switch-hitter who is more successful batting left-handed than right-handed. But Piniella returned to the dugout, leaving the right-handed Garcia on the mound and the left-hander in the bullpen.</p>
        <p>''Lou just said, 'Go after them and locate your pitches down,' '' Oliver related. ''I emphasized to Freddy when Lou walked off to locate his sinker down and let everything fall into place.''</p>
        <p>With everyone back in place, O'Neill went to the plate and struck out on a 1-2 changeup. Bernie Williams, batting left-handed, was next, and he struck out on a 1-2 changeup.</p>
        <p>''He really had a lot of confidence going,'' Oliver said. ''His sinker was really moving everywhere. He was locating it. Some guys were taking some changeups down in the zone. Suddenly he started elevating it a little bit.''</p>
        <p>With two out now, Garcia prepared to face David Justice, as dangerous a hitter as the Yankees have had since they acquired him from Cleveland on June 29. Garcia's first two pitches were balls. The next one was in the strike zone, and Justice took a mighty swing. The ball rocketed into the air, soaring higher and higher and farther and farther. It was headed toward center field, the deepest part of the park</p>
        <p>''That was the first pitch he threw all inning that didn't move,'' Oliver said.</p>
        <p>Mike Cameron, the Ken Griffey Jr. replacement in center field, raced back toward the fence. ''When I first took off,'' he said, ''I thought it had a pretty good chance.'' He meant a chance of leaving the park for a three-run home run and a 3-2 lead.</p>
        <p>''I was kind of measuring the wall a little bit to see if I could get up and make a good play,'' Cameron continued, ''but it didn't carry enough. The wind was blowing in a little bit and I got a chance to get behind the ball and made the catch.''</p>
        <p>He was only two steps in front of the fence when he caught it. ''Two steps,'' he added for emphasis and, at the same time, relief.</p>
        <p>Oliver, also relieved, went back to the dugout.</p>
        <p>''I was talking to some guys,'' he recounted, ''saying that was the only ball that didn't move. It kind of scared me. Stan Javier walked up and said: 'Well it was a great pitch. He made an out with it.' I didn't think of it that way at the time.''</p>
        <p>Praising Garcia some more, the catcher said, ''He responded, made some incredible pitches and used his breaking ball when he needed to, and threw some great changeups and got out of a tough inning that looked like these guys were coming back.''</p>
        <p>But the Yankees didn't come back that inning or in the ninth inning, when they had two runners on and one out. Now the Mariners have a one-game lead in the four-of-seven series and a 4-0 record as the wild-card team in this year's A.L. playoffs. They defeated the Chicago White Sox, the team with the league's best won-lost record, in both games they played in Chicago, and they have begun this series with a victory in New York.</p>
        <p>If they should win in New York again today, the next time they leave Seattle could be for Games 3 and 4 of the World Series in the National League team's city.</p>
