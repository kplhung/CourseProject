        <p>Halama, a Brooklyn native, will be the starting pitcher for Seattle this afternoon in Game 2. He said he never went to a game at Yankee Stadium as a youngster and only one Mets game. When he was asked before last night's game where he lived in Brooklyn, Halama said, ''I grew up in Brooklyn.''</p>
        <p>''Where?'' he was asked.</p>
        <p>''It's irrelevant,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''I'm not really a big baseball fan,'' he said later. ''I've played it. I love playing the game. I don't watch baseball at all. I don't read the sports sections. I don't watch ESPN. It's not me.''</p>
