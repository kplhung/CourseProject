        <p>Under close scrutiny from jittery technology investors, Yahoo posted quarterly earnings today that narrowly beat expectations, but the company also suggested that failures and scaling back among dot-com advertisers had limited growth and might continue to do so.</p>
        <p>The company reported earnings of $82 million, or 13 cents a share, one penny more than analysts' projections, and just more than double the company's earnings of 6 cents a share for the period a year earlier.</p>
        <p>The company reported revenue of $295.5 million, exceeding by roughly $15 million the projections by industry analysts. The revenue figure represented a rise of 9.4 percent from the second quarter, which ended in June.</p>
        <p>Industry analysts characterized the returns as respectable but not extraordinary. And they said Yahoo  and other Internet companies that rely heavily on advertising by dot-com concerns were clearly not out of the woods yet.</p>
        <p>''Yahoo should be commended for keeping its business fundamentals in order in a very hectic market,'' said Jordan E. Rohan, an analyst with Wit Soundview, a New York-based brokerage firm. But he said some basic questions remained, noting that ''a lot of the revenue we expect for next year is not very predictable.''</p>
        <p>In a conference call with industry analysts, Yahoo officials today expressed acute awareness of investors' concern over the slide of advertising by dot-coms. For the first time in its history, the company disclosed the composition of its advertising base, saying that 40 percent of its advertisers were pure Internet companies. The company said that figure was down from 47 percent in the second quarter.</p>
        <p>Yahoo officials also said that the number of advertisers declined to 3,450 from 3,675 in the second quarter.</p>
        <p>Susan Decker, the company's chief financial officer, described the results as ''another strong quarter for Yahoo.'' But she said the company had felt the ''drag'' of reduced spending from struggling dot-com companies that have cut back on advertising. ''We assume the drag from the dot-com issue will continue,'' she said. ''We don't know how long it will continue -- we're grappling with that.''</p>
        <p>But analysts said there were clear points of strength for Yahoo in the period. The company reported that its average daily page views were 780 million in September, up from 680 million in June. The company said its number of unique users rose to 166 million in the quarter, up 6 percent from the quarter before.</p>
        <p>And Yahoo reported that its number of registered users -- visitors who log onto one or more Yahoo services, such as its auction site -- rose to 185 million, up from 155 last quarter.</p>
        <p>''The global Yahoo franchise is stronger today than ever before,'' said Tim Koogle, Yahoo's chairman and chief executive.</p>
        <p>But industry analysts said the company was cagey about its projections for the next several quarters -- particularly the first quarter of 2001 -- when the pullback in dot-com advertising is expected to take a continued toll.</p>
        <p>Andrea W. Rice, managing director at Deutsche Bank Alex. Brown, said that Yahoo's returns provided ''confirmation that even the best-established companies are struggling to generate significant growth.'' And she added that that boded poorly for less-established players.</p>
        <p>''If companies like Yahoo are feeling effects of a pullback in online spending, then second-  and third-tier companies must really be struggling,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Yahoo's earnings announcement, which came after the market closed today, kicked off a spate of quarterly earnings, with such companies as Microsoft and America Online announcing returns next week. Investors have been jittery not just because consumer-based Internet companies have struggled, but also because Intel, Dell Computer and Apple Computer have warned that quarterly earnings, to be announced in the coming weeks, will not meet earlier expectations.</p>
        <p>Yahoo's stock has plummeted from a 52-week high of about $250, reached in January. Shares of Yahoo closed down $3.06, at $82.69, in regular trading today. In after-hours trading, shares tumbled as low as $77.</p>
        <p>Several industry analysts said the earnings were not so powerful -- nor glaringly bad -- to suggest how investors might react. Ms. Rice said it was unclear whether investors would support Yahoo's valuation -- roughly 135 times 2001 earnings.</p>
        <p>''Yahoo fell through its floor'' last month, she said, referring to the stock's consistent slide since it dipped below 100. ''Now that it's fallen through the floor, we don't know where the new floor is.''</p>
