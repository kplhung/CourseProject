        <p>It was 21 years ago and she was only 9 years old, but Sabrina Yaw says she remembers it all.</p>
        <p>She remembers watching her mother and older brother beat her baby sister to death. She remembers watching them place the body in a garbage bag, the garbage bag in a wooden trunk and the trunk in a bedroom closet. She remembers keeping the corpse a secret for nearly 20 years. She remembers that, once, the family moved to another apartment, taking with them everything they had, ''Beds, lamps, tables and the trunk that contained my sister's remains.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Yaw's riveting testimony came yesterday in State Supreme Court in Brooklyn on the opening day of the murder trial of her mother and brother, Madeline and Gregory Carmichael. The Carmichaels, who were arrested in November, have been charged with second-degree murder in the death of 3-year-old Latanisha Carmichael.</p>
        <p>''They showed no sign of sympathy, no compassion, no sense of decency when they buried her in a closet,'' Barry Schreiber, the lead prosecutor in the case, said in his opening statement. He contended that Mrs. Carmichael, now 61, and her son, now 38, killed Latanisha after she enraged them by vomiting in front of visitors to their home.</p>
        <p>In their own opening statements, the Carmichaels' lawyers argued that there was no conclusive medical evidence that the child had been fatally beaten, and that Latanisha's death was an accident.</p>
        <p>''She may be guilty of a cover-up,'' Joshua Horowitz, one of the lawyers, said of his client, Mrs. Carmichael. ''But she is not guilty of murder.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Yaw's testimony was the climax of a dramatic day in what promises to be a trial filled with family intrigue and macabre moments. In an emotionless voice, Ms. Yaw recalled sitting on her living room floor in November 1979 with Latanisha's twin brother, Andre, as her mother and Gregory hit the little girl over and over, as if they were swatting a fly.</p>
        <p>''Latanisha started screaming,'' Ms. Yaw told Justice Anne G. Feldman, who is hearing the trial in lieu of a jury. ''She was just screaming in pain like a child hurting real bad.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Yaw testified that she kept her sister's death a secret because she feared for her life. But last fall, Andre Carmichael approached her with vague suspicions that he had a twin sister who had disappeared years ago when he was too young to remember her.</p>
        <p>At first, Ms. Yaw said, she ignored her brother's questions, but he was determined to find out about his twin. After three attempts to brush him off, she said, she forced her brother to sign a contract swearing that he would never reveal what she was about to say.</p>
        <p>Once he heard the story, Andre Carmichael went to the police. And when the authorities searched the Carmichaels' apartment in Brownsville, Brooklyn, last November, they found the remains of Ms. Yaw's sister swaddled in a baby blanket,  wrapped in yellowing newspaper from Nov. 4, 1979, and hidden in a cedar-lined footlocker.</p>
        <p>That footlocker was inside a steamer trunk that had been wrapped in cellophane and left in the closet, surrounded by piles of air fresheners, camphor cakes, incense sticks and boxes of baking soda.</p>
        <p>Latanisha's death, Ms. Yaw testified, was not an aberration. She claimed it was the worst episode in a home life of constant abuse. She said that she was frequently beaten as a child and still bore the emotional and physical scars. When she was asked by the prosecution whether her mother or brother hit her more often, she answered, ''Whichever one got to you first.''</p>
        <p>However, Ms. Yaw also testified that when she was 16, she named her first child after her mother. She said that as recently as August 1999, her mother stayed with her for nearly a month and the two got along well.  And she said that when her mother was at Rikers Island after her arrest, she sent gifts: money orders, clothing, even the pair of black Reebok sneakers that her mother wore yesterday in court.</p>
        <p>The defense seized on this ambiguous relationship to suggest that Mrs. Carmichael was a good mother at times. Under questioning by Mr. Horowitz, Ms. Yaw acknowledged that she never went hungry, that the apartment on Rockaway Parkway was always neat and that her clothes were always clean.</p>
        <p>The cross-examination by Jeff Adler, Gregory Carmichael's lawyer, was somewhat more fierce. He tried to suggest that Ms. Yaw was exaggerating the pain she suffered as a child. He pointed out that although child welfare officials investigated her complaints of abuse, she was never taken from the family home.</p>
        <p>The most heated exchange came when Mr. Adler suggested that Ms. Yaw had not actually witnessed her sister being assaulted.</p>
        <p>''The truth is, you don't know what happened, do you?'' he asked.</p>
        <p>''I know what happened,'' Ms. Yaw responded, raising her voice. ''And I'm not going to sit here and have you tell me otherwise.''</p>
