        <p>ORWELL  Wintry Conscience of a Generation  By Jeffrey Meyers  Illustrated. 380 pages. W. W. Norton. $29.95.</p>
        <p>A kind of impassioned clarity governed the life and work of the great George Orwell, whose writings, as a critic once observed, are so fluidly presented, so unobtrusive, so transparent that you almost feel you could have tossed them off yourself.</p>
        <p>Ideally a biography of Orwell would be consistent with its subject's unassuming intelligence, and Jeffrey Meyers's admirable ''Orwell: Wintry Conscience of a Generation'' is that. It illuminates the ruggedly individualistic Orwell without calling attention to the illuminator. It is comparatively slim as literary biographies go these days; it steadfastly refuses to pile on the detail, so what remains seems, in the spirit of its subject, to be the common-sense essentials.</p>
        <p>Mr. Meyers, who has written biographies of such writers as D. H. Lawrence and F. Scott Fitzgerald, sensibly stresses the rigorous honesty of Orwell, his stubborn and brave willingness to contradict what passed for the decent opinion of the Western intelligentsia. He attributes these characteristics to a powerful and ineradicable sense of guilt that arose from Orwell's circumstances as the offspring of emotionally distant, mediocre, colonial-era parents, especially his father, a minor official in British India who oversaw the production of opium destined for the China market.</p>
        <p>''His family,'' Mr. Meyers writes of the young Orwell (whose name, until he changed it in his early 30's, was Eric Blair), ''inspired his most striking characteristic: a deep sense of guilt that pervaded his personality and his writing. He felt guilty about his colonial heritage, his bourgeois background, his inbred snobbery and his elite education.''</p>
        <p>To attribute one of the most refined political and literary sensibilities to guilt seems too simple, yet Mr. Meyers may well be right. Much of what Orwell did in his extraordinary life rang with a kind of attempted expiation, an effort not so much to transcend his circumstances as to tunnel beneath them. He attended fancy private boarding schools, including Eton, but rather than go on to Oxford, he became a policeman in Burma, collecting the material that he later used in his novel ''Burmese Days'' and his classic essay ''Shooting an Elephant.''</p>
        <p>When he went home to England after two unhappy years serving British colonial interests, he took to the roads as a tramp, purposefully living a life of poverty, going native in his own country, as he put it himself. He was sick with congenital lung disease, but even after achieving fame and wealth he chose to live on a dank island in Scotland, a choice that seemed to confirm what one friend years before had called a ''suicidal perversity.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Meyers relates the life crisply and judiciously, with Orwell emerging as a darkly enlightened sort of character whose vision of the world came out of real experience. He was a lifelong anti-Communist -- one of his many penetrating phrases was about ''the new kind of men from eastern Europe, the streamlined men who talk in slogans and think in bullets'' -- because he saw the corruption of Stalinism in Spain, where he went in 1937 to fight for the republican cause. His book ''Homage to Catalonia'' ran so counter to prevailing opinion that in its first 12 years it sold only 600 copies; yet it was perhaps the most rigorously clear view of the Spanish reality in the English language.</p>
        <p>There have of course been other biographies of Orwell, the fact-rich one by Bernard Crick, published two decades ago, and a more recent work by Michael Sheldon. Mr. Meyers does not claim to have produced a great deal of new information, but his focus on Orwell's inner life and on the connection between the unsparing lucidity of his work and the gritty self-destructiveness of his personality add up to an altered vision. Mr. Meyers's Orwell is still a hero, but he is a hero whose need for love could make him slightly pathetic and whose drive to place himself in the path of danger endangered those close to him.</p>
        <p>V. S. Pritchett called Orwell ''a kind of saint,'' and he seems to have had his habit of self-punishment in mind. Strangely, Mr. Meyers does not make any reference in this connection to Orwell's famous essay on Gandhi, which begins, ''Saints should always be judged guilty until they are proved innocent.'' Orwell's point was that it takes political shrewdness, manipulation and coercion, not just goodness, to succeed, though he also in the end seems to have found Gandhi innocent. Orwell's remarkable impact on the 20th-century consciousness, in which his judgment was almost always right, would seem to make him innocent, too, but, judging from some of the evidence in  Mr. Meyers's ''Orwell,'' only barely.</p>
        <p>One of the pleasures of this book is the space it gives to walk-on roles for others of the midcentury thinking class, from Arthur Koestler, with whom Orwell had a good deal in common, to the critic Cyril Connolly, who was a kind of friendly opposite to Orwell. These others -- who also include Lawrence, Stephen Spender and T. S. Eliot -- not only give a sense of the intellectual climate, they also demonstrate how different Orwell was. And Mr. Meyers shows that he was different almost from the beginning, from his school days at St. Cyprian's (immortalized in his sour essay ''Such, Such Were the Joys'') to his months on the Scottish island of Jura, writing ''1984'' and dying of tuberculosis.</p>
        <p>It is possible, now that the 20th-century struggle with totalitarianism is over and ideological passions have waned, that Orwell could fade from awareness. One wonders in fact how frequently he appears on college reading lists these days. Mr. Meyers's fine biography is a reminder of the uniqueness of the man who titled one of his essays ''Revenge Is Sour,'' of just how much he lived, and of how morally and intellectually cauterizing was his thought.</p>
