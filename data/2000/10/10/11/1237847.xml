        <p>Given the recent and ongoing demonstration of the Israeli and Palestinian penchant for mutually assured destruction, it is worth asking whether the ''peace process'' is dead or only breathing hard. Whatever the answer, it is clear that we have come to this sorry state thanks to a dearth of effective leadership on both sides.</p>
        <p>First, there is General Ariel Sharon. He must have known that his visit to the Temple Mount would trigger a violent reaction, particularly in the atmosphere of the time. And so it did, but Mr. Sharon succeeded in upstaging his archrival, former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whom the Israeli attorney general decided not to prosecute on charges of corruption.  Israel has paid a high price for Mr. Sharon's little game, but . . . politics is politics.</p>

        <p>Given the recent and ongoing demonstration of the Israeli and Palestinian penchant for mutually assured destruction, it is worth asking whether the ''peace process'' is dead or only breathing hard. Whatever the answer, it is clear that we have come to this sorry state thanks to a dearth of effective leadership on both sides.</p>
        <p>First, there is General Ariel Sharon. He must have known that his visit to the Temple Mount would trigger a violent reaction, particularly in the atmosphere of the time. And so it did, but Mr. Sharon succeeded in upstaging his archrival, former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whom the Israeli attorney general decided not to prosecute on charges of corruption.  Israel has paid a high price for Mr. Sharon's little game, but . . . politics is politics.</p>
        <p>And what can be said for the Palestinians? To put it mildly, the punishment hardly fits the crime. The rampage that ensued showed how little influence Mr. Arafat has over his minions. It also showed just how unprepared his police were to prevent the destruction of holy places when Palestinians run amok. Nor should we ignore the game that apparently is afoot along Israel's northern border. Hezbollah, Lebanon and Syria all seem intent on taking advantage of Israel's troubles, should the opportunity present itself.</p>
        <p>A heady brew, indeed. Now add Ehud Barak's paper-thin control of the Knesset, due in part to mistakes he has made since taking office, and a bleak picture becomes bleaker still. Israel's ability to mount an effective and coherent campaign, either of peace or war, given the weakness of its government, is well-nigh nonexistent.</p>
        <p>But I should not be too hasty in condemning the Barak administration. The prime minister apparently offered significant concessions that were never enough to satisfy the Palestinians. Under the best of circumstances it might have been possible, with the help of President Clinton, to continue to narrow the differences over the coming months, arriving at a compromise that both sides could -- if reluctantly -- have accepted.</p>
        <p>But now? I, for one, am increasingly pessimistic. Mr. Arafat may or may not want a settlement, but can he control his people? Doubtful, particularly in the present climate. Mr. Barak may be faced with the need to call new elections soon. Even if he can hang on for a time, it is doubtful (again, particularly in the present climate) that he can generate the support necessary to resolve the really tough issues, like Jersualem.</p>
        <p>That leaves the United States and President Clinton. I am no admirer of the president's foreign policy, but he does seem to have gained the trust of both Israelis and Palestinians, and he deserves credit for trying over the past several years to reach a settlement. But he has probably, by now, run out the string. He is fast becoming a lame duck; a month from now that is what he will be, no matter who his successor. It is highly unlikely that either gentleman would be ready to let the president continue his role as intermediary.</p>
        <p>So there we are. Perhaps the peace process isn't dead, but it certainly is likely to be in hibernation until sometime after January 20. Whoever moves into the White House next year will want to take some time to get his mind around the subject before he involves himself or his administration in so complex and explosive an issue.</p>
        <p>I very much hope this analysis is wrong. If it is correct, we face the likelihood of increasing Palestinian violence and Israeli response, with potential unpleasant consequences throughout the Middle East. I seriously doubt that the Palestinians will be prepared to forgo substantial violence, or the declaration of a Palestinian state, for so long a time. The new president may well face a major foreign-policy challenge before he is ready.</p>
