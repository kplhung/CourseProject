        <p>Luis Sojo was due to bat for the Yankees in the ninth inning last night, two outs, two runners on base, Seattle winning by two runs. But Yankees Manager Joe Torre had no intention of inserting a pinch-hitter for Sojo, a career utilityman, because two weeks into October, Sojo is the Yankees' most productive hitter.</p>
        <p>The Yankees got by with that in the first round of the playoffs. But now it is the second round, and Derek Jeter is not hitting, David Justice is not hitting, and Paul O'Neill is swinging so badly that he was removed for a pinch-hitter last night.</p>
        <p>Seattle's Freddy Garcia and the three relievers who followed him shackled the Yankees, 2-0, at Yankee Stadium in Game 1 of the American League Championship Series, except for the one brief moment in the ninth inning when it seemed Sojo might win the game.</p>
        <p>But it is hard to know exactly if Garcia, who pitched exceptionally for six and two-thirds innings, was just overwhelming, or if this was just the latest chapter in a Yankees slump that has lasted for about a month.</p>
        <p>''I don't want to take any of the credit away from Garcia,'' Torre said, ''but we have not been hitting the ball. We have not been scoring runs.''</p>
        <p>The Mariners' John Halama starts Game 2 of the four-of-seven-game series today against Orlando Hernandez, who will pitch on his birthday, either his 35th or 31st, depending on the document. But the only record that concerns the Yankees at this point is that they are a perfect 8-0 in the games Hernandez has pitched in during postseason play.</p>
        <p>Long after last night's game ended, most of the Yankees were still hidden in unseen rooms in their clubhouse. The door to the trainer's room, usually open, was closed, players on the other side, alone with their meals and their thoughts.</p>
        <p>Justice went 0 for 4, striking out twice. Jeter whiffed three times, looking as bad as he ever has in one game, swinging wildly. The Yankees compiled 6 hits and 13 strikeouts, and it would be easy to attribute this to Garcia and his brethren. ''I'm not making any excuses for our guys,'' Torre said. ''It is frustrating.''</p>
        <p>Denny Neagle started for the Yankees last night and gave them a chance to win. He talks as if his fast-forward button has jammed, words rushing out of his mouth rapidly; he spoke 1,050 words in answering the first six questions posed to him by the news media Monday, or 932 more than Garcia used to answer six questions. Neagle's challenge last night was in controlling that runaway energy, to work calmly.</p>
        <p>Before the game, Torre said he would know very early how Neagle would pitch, based on his command against the few hitters. Neagle was behind the count constantly, but he battled, stayed in the game.</p>
        <p>Neagle retired the first two batters in the fifth, his pitch count climbing toward 100, the score 0-0. But Mark McLemore pulled a line drive that bounced just inside the left-field line, a double. Rickey Henderson was next to bat and when the count reached two balls and two strikes, the Yankees' outfield coach, Lee Mazzilli, stood on the top step of the dugout and beckoned for right fielder Paul O'Neill to move in a few steps, waving his arms, trying desperately to get his attention.</p>
        <p>O'Neill finally saw Mazzilli and moved toward the infield about 10 feet, just before Henderson singled to right. O'Neill was in a perfect position, shallow right field, to throw out McLemore. But his throw was off-line -- like a number of his throws against Oakland in the division series -- and Seattle had a 1-0 lead. Alex Rodriguez opened the top of the sixth for the Mariners and again, Neagle worked into a deep pitch count, three balls and two strikes, and flipped a changeup to the outside corner. Rodriguez leaned over the plate, his weight shifted on his front foot, and bashed the ball; undoubtedly, it was going to go far enough to be a home run.</p>
        <p>The only question was whether it would be foul or fair, and it rippled the screen attached to the yellow foul pole, for a home run. Rodriguez and Jeter are close friends, but after the ball landed, Jeter turned his head and stared toward the third-base stands, and when Rodriguez passed on his jog around the bases, Jeter turned and looked to the other side of the field.</p>
        <p>Jeter had already struck out twice by then, baffled, like many of his teammates, by Garcia. The right-handed Garcia, one of the little-known minor leaguers acquired from Houston a couple of years ago for Randy Johnson, missed most of this year with a leg injury. The Yankees had not seen him pitch this season, which was one of the reasons Seattle Manager Lou Piniella opted to pitch him in Game 1.</p>
        <p>He was throwing hard, mixing his fastball with a curve, a slider, a forkball. ''Everything,'' Jeter said. ''He had everything.''</p>
        <p>O'Neill said: ''When a guy throws that hard, you have to make a decision quick. He's got some kind of movement on the ball. I think we helped him by swinging at a lot of bad pitches.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees had runners at first and second and nobody out in the sixth, but Piniella chose to keep Garcia in the game, and he whiffed O'Neill and Bernie Williams, and retired Justice on a fly to deep center.</p>
        <p>When Garcia's pitch count climbed over 100 in the seventh, Piniella went to his bullpen. The Yankees had a runner at first base and two out in the eighth, and O'Neill was due to bat, and Torre replaced him with Glenallen Hill, looking for a home run that could tie the game.  ''You've got a guy with tremendous power on the bench,'' O'Neill said. ''You've got to give your team a chance to tie up the game.''</p>
        <p>Hill whiffed, however, one of 22 strikeouts by the two teams, an A.L.C.S. record. Kazuhiro Sasaki relieved for Seattle in the ninth, and Williams and Martinez singled around Justice's strikeout. After Jorge Posada flied out, Sojo came to the plate; he led the Yankees with four runs batted in against Oakland.</p>
        <p>With two strikes, Sojo popped a long fly down the right-field line, and he waved with his left hand, trying to guide the ball past the foul pole with body English. But it fell foul, to the right of the pole by 10 feet, and he then flied out to end the game.</p>
