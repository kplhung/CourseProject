        <p>AFTER years of double-digit growth, sales of herbal supplements have slowed down. Maybe it's because there has been so much negative publicity about their safety and effectiveness. Maybe it's because, despite all the promises from the manufacturers, the supplements don't provide a quick fix. Or maybe it's because there are so many of them that most people are completely bewildered.</p>
        <p>The confusion can be traced to the 1994 Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act. The law, passed after intensive lobbying by the supplement industry, created a new product category for supplements, treating them as neither foods nor drugs. It gives manufacturers almost carte blanche to sell products with virtually no government oversight.</p>

        <p>AFTER years of double-digit growth, sales of herbal supplements have slowed down. Maybe it's because there has been so much negative publicity about their safety and effectiveness. Maybe it's because, despite all the promises from the manufacturers, the supplements don't provide a quick fix. Or maybe it's because there are so many of them that most people are completely bewildered.</p>
        <p>The confusion can be traced to the 1994 Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act. The law, passed after intensive lobbying by the supplement industry, created a new product category for supplements, treating them as neither foods nor drugs. It gives manufacturers almost carte blanche to sell products with virtually no government oversight.</p>
        <p>The leveling off of sales could also be a protest against the idea that companies can manufacture products without any quality control and make false promises. Now, a new quarterly publication, The Dietary Supplement, could prove to be of help to the bewildered consumer as well as to health professionals looking for an unbiased overview of what is  available.</p>
        <p>Those who want unequivocal answers will be disappointed, though. The newsletter expects readers to balance the information themselves and make informed decisions instead of relying on what manufacturers promise.</p>
        <p>Describing itself as an ''independent source for the sensible, informed use of vitamins, minerals, botanicals and related products,'' the newsletter in its first three issues seems to be living up to the description. What it has to say about Vitamin E, echinacea, glucosamine and chondroitin is both thorough and sensible.</p>
        <p>The newsletter is the brainchild of Paul R. Thomas, who has a bachelor's degree in biology and a doctorate in nutrition education and has worked for the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Academy of Sciences. He says he takes no money from the supplement industry, and the newsletter accepts no advertising. The 16-page quarterly provides an in-depth discussion of a different supplement in each issue along with  other information about the industry.</p>
        <p>Each discussion asks two questions: What is the scientific evidence and expert opinion for and against the use of the supplement? What is the best advice on how to choose a supplement to gain the benefits and minimize the risks?</p>
        <p>About Vitamin E the newsletter says: ''Heart disease is best prevented by eating right, getting regular exercise'' -- the usual advice. But it goes on to say, ''It is not clear whether supplements of vitamin E add much to a heart-protective lifestyle, but for those who believe extra vitamin E may be of benefit to the heart, 200 to 400 International Units (I.U.) a day divided into two doses appears reasonable.''</p>
        <p>And it adds that for those who want to take Vitamin E, the natural form is better than synthetic, even though it is more expensive, because it stays in the body longer. Synthetic Vitamin E is labeled dl-alpha tocopherol; natural is labeled d-alpha tocopherol.</p>
        <p>The newsletter advises using products with an expiration date, as well as some evidence of quality assurance, like a statement on the label that it meets quality and purity standards set by U.S. Pharmacopeia, a professional organization.</p>
        <p>Echinacea, also reviewed by the newsletter, is the best-selling herbal remedy in this country, marketed to prevent or alleviate the symptoms of colds. The newsletter says it appears to be safe ''when used by basically healthy people on an occasional, short-term basis.'' But it goes on to say that it is difficult to know whether echinacea works, because the clinical trials, many of which were financed by the industry, had deficiencies, and because each echinacea product contains different properties, making it impossible to recommend one brand over another.</p>
        <p>''If you're going to try an echinacea supplement, and it's not at all clear that you should, simply pick one the next time you're coming down with a cold or flu,'' the newsletter advises. ''If it doesn't work and you're determined to give echinacea another try with your next respiratory infection, choose a different brand.''</p>
        <p>The newsletter costs $28 a year from 11905 Bristol Manor Court, Rockville, Md. 20852, (301) 881-7008, or www.thedietarysupplement.com.</p>
        <p>Besides U.S. Pharmacopeia, other professional organizations are trying to improve the reliability of dietary supplements. ConsumerLab is a commercial testing company that has begun to assess the quality of dietary supplements; its evaluations are posted on its Web site, www.consumerlab.com. The National Nutritional Foods Association, a trade organization for manufacturers and retailers of herbal remedies, requires members to be part of its certification program, which provides ''reasonable assurance'' that the products meet certain quality standards.</p>
        <p>At the University of the Sciences in Philadelphia, a group of pharmacists  is undertaking clinical evaluations of herbal supplements. Good Housekeeping magazine has announced that advertisers will be required to provide evidence that the ingredients claimed on the label are actually in the product in the amounts specified. And the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine at the National Institutes of Health is providing $6 million to develop standardized versions of the pills of four botanicals, including echinacea, for use in future clinical trials.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, The Dietary Supplement may be your best bet.</p>
