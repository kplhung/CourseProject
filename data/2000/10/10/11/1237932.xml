        <p>THE HOUSE</p>
        <p>PRESCRIPTION DRUG DEBATE -- Representative E. Clay Shaw, Republican of Florida, is trying to turn the prescription drug issue around on State Representative Elaine Bloom, his Democratic challenger in a South Florida congressional race considered one of the most important in the struggle for control of the House.</p>
        <p>For weeks, Ms. Bloom has been using the issue, one of the year's hottest, against Mr. Shaw, charging that he has failed to help the thousands of elderly voters in his Fort Lauderdale district obtain reasonably priced drugs. Yesterday, Mr. Shaw countered with a tough television ad that ties Ms. Bloom to Andrx, a drug maker recently found guilty of accepting $89 million from another drug company to keep cheaper heart medication off the market.</p>

        <p>PRESCRIPTION DRUG DEBATE -- Representative E.

        <p>For weeks, Ms. Bloom has been using the issue, one of the year's hottest, against Mr. Shaw, charging that he has failed to help the thousands of elderly voters in his Fort Lauderdale district obtain reasonably priced drugs. Yesterday, Mr. Shaw countered with a tough television ad that ties Ms. Bloom to Andrx, a drug maker recently found guilty of accepting $89 million from another drug company to keep cheaper heart medication off the market.</p>
        <p>Ms. Bloom served on the board of Andrx from 1993 to 2000. In response to the Shaw ad, which concludes, ''Elaine Bloom: Millions in drug company profits while seniors paid higher drug prices,'' she said that her sole goal at Andrx was to help the company develop ''an alternative to higher prices.''</p>

        <p>THE STATES</p>
        <p>FROM THOMAS TO 'TOMAS' -- Change happens in politics, both in substance and style. Some candidates change on the issues. Some change their hair style. Thomas Wesson, a Republican candidate for constable in Dallas County, Tex., has changed his name, to Tomas Eduardo Wesson.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wesson, who is listed on county records as Thomas Edwin Wesson and who ran as Thomas Edwin Wesson in two unsuccessful bids for city council, is not Hispanic. But he hails from a heavily Hispanic precinct. Still, he insists he's not trying to deceive Hispanic voters by showing up on this year's ballot as Tomas Eduardo. ''That's my name,'' he says.</p>
        <p>His Democratic opponent, Mike Dupree, thinks otherwise and has filed a complaint with the local district attorney. ''Someone said I should change my name to Miguel,'' Mr. Dupree told The Dallas Morning News recently.</p>

        <p>THE GREEN PARTY</p>
        <p>A GAUNTLET THROWN -- One of the stations along the presidential campaign trail is the luncheon speech to the Detroit Economic Club, and yesterday Ralph Nader made his stop, taking a big bite out of the hand that had just fed him.</p>
        <p>Looking out over an audience laden with auto industry executives, Mr. Nader said they had been ''craven and myopic,'' opposing tougher vehicle safety and fuel economy standards in order to make bigger profits. Then he asked: ''What is it about this industry, which has such talent and such an obligation to the global environment and to highway safety, that it is constantly putting the brakes on itself unless it is dragged kicking and screaming by government regulators or lawsuits?''</p>
        <p>Silence.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Nader, whose landmark 1965 book ''Unsafe at Any Speed'' led to many tougher federal auto standards, was not deterred and for the next 50 minutes stayed on the attack, challenging the auto officials to ''set an example for the rest of the world by acting as if people mattered.''</p>
        <p>''The next time you get a presidential candidate to speak here and he panders to you,'' Mr. Nader concluded, ''you should feel insulted.''</p>

        <p>THE ISSUES</p>
        <p>GUN CONTROL MEASURE ON BALLOT -- The Colorado Supreme Court cleared the way yesterday for a ballot question that will allow voters to decide whether background checks should be mandatory for all buyers at gun shows.</p>
        <p>Opponents of the initiative had asked the court to keep it off the Nov. 7 ballot because efforts to get it on were begun before its wording could be approved by the court. The court rejected that reasoning.</p>
        <p>Gun control advocates began pushing for the measure after authorities said some of the guns used in the shootings last year at Columbine High School near Denver were bought at a gun show. When the state legislature refused to act, the gun control forces decided to try the initiative route.</p>

        <p>THE DEMOCRATS</p>
        <p>AN EYE ON THE OVAL OFFICE -- The guy who once thought it would be fun to have a 24-hour camera in outer space to beam back pictures of Earth says he would consider having a 24-hour camera in the Oval Office. That's Vice President Al Gore, who said ''maybe so'' when Yahoo's Internet Life, a magazine published by the Web site, asked him if he would consider a Web cam in the Oval Office. He expressed some concern that a 24-hour camera could give away security secrets, but said me might approve of ''episodic'' glimpses (audio and video) into the heart of the White House.</p>
        <p>As for his proposal for an all-Earth, all-the-time satellite, that is seeming less far-fetched than when Mr. Gore first raised it in March 1998. The proposal, part of the NASA authorization bill, passed the House last month and is pending in the Senate. The so-called Tirana Satellite would cost $35 million.</p>

        <p>THE REPUBLICANS</p>
        <p>BUSH STUMBLES ON 'I.R.A.' -- Gov. George W. Bush has no trouble articulating the broad differences between his tax-cut plan and Vice President Al Gore's. It's the little details that keep dragging him down.</p>
        <p>On Saturday, he sank into a quicksand of numbers and decimal points. Then yesterday he misstated what he said would be one of the impacts of all the complications in Mr. Gore's proposal.</p>
        <p>Speaking at a rally in Greensboro, N.C., he said, ''It's going to require numerous I.R.A. agents'' to decipher Mr. Gore's formulas. He meant I.R.S. agents, and although it was an isolated flub, it was an example of the kind of small verbal spasm that could cause a big tremor in a debate.</p>

        <p>THE RUNNING MATES</p>
        <p>LIEBERMAN GETS 'A' IN VOCABULARY -- Senator Joseph I. Lieberman can go to the head of the class. Of the four candidates in last week's presidential and vice presidential debates, he used the brainiest language, speaking on a grade level of 9.2, according to calculations by the Princeton Review, the test preparation company. His verbiage included words like rhetoric and aspirations.</p>
        <p>George W. Bush, the Review figured, spoke at a grade level of 6.7, showing a fondness for the the word fuzzy, whereas Al Gore, who liked the word squander, spoke at the 7.9 grade level. Because Dick Cheney tossed around words like convene and decimated, he came in at the 8.5 grade level.</p>
        <p>The Review graded the debates using a Defense Department test that measures the level of education required to understand various reading material.</p>
