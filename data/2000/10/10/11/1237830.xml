        <p>Dyed-to-match toe shoes, folding chairs and cigarette-puffing performers were once among the signs in dance that the audience was in for a disappointing evening. The surest sign today is an onstage videographer prowling solemnly through a piece.</p>
        <p>Hope Clark's ''Raw.Seeds.Need,'' performed on Saturday night at Dance Theater Workshop as part of the theater's Splitstream series, was no exception.</p>
        <p>In addition to the videographer (Audrey Kindred), the three-part work featured live-action video and slide projections of Ms. Clark and her dancers moving, in choreography that also had them chanting words and a cappella harmonizing. Program notes suggested that Ms. Clark, a longtime performer with Elizabeth Streb, was fascinated by the interdependence of movements and words in addition to the large amorphous themes that many newish choreographers dash toward like lemmings.</p>
        <p>But there was so much going on in the dance's solo, duet and trio -- and so little sense of some strong central impetus or idea -- that there was little discernible evidence of what Ms. Clark wanted to say about that connectedness.</p>
        <p>Some of the projected imagery of intersection and overlaid bodies was beautiful. There were some equally compelling images of moving bodies toward the end when Ms. Clark and her handmaidens, Nam Holtz and Megan Brunsvold, became a collection of hunched, rounded bodies and stark verticals. And their three voices harmonized exquisitely.</p>
        <p>But only the second section, a duet for Ms. Clark and Edith Stephen, had a sense of some overriding artistic truth. Ms. Stephen, older and more experienced than Ms. Clark, contented herself with being fully present in the piece. She moved her moves and articulated her words -- most delightfully in an ''Oh, my!'' series -- with a bracing lack of self-involvement.</p>
        <p>It would have been interesting to see Ms. Clark trust the instincts that led her to see what a satisfying match she and Ms. Stephen would make.</p>
        <p>The percussion score was by composed and performed by Christine Bard. Charles McKenna designed the pretty velour jumpsuits. The lighting was by Philip Sandstrom.</p>
        <p>The evening opened with ''Royal Madness,'' a work in progress for Yasuko Yokoshi and Gonnie Heggen that is to be performed in full in February at the Kitchen; it was not open for review. That was a pity. The two women are inspired lunatics who work well together and who leave few of today's icons unassaulted.</p>
