        <p>Throw in the Local Cuisine, and It Adds Up</p>
        <p>When MATTHEW GOLDSTEIN, chancellor of the City University of New York, was lining up people to serve on the new mathematics commission he is heading for Schools Chancellor HAROLD O. LEVY, one of those he wanted most was PHILIP URI TREISMAN, a math professor at the University of Texas at Austin. Dr. Treisman, a former MacArthur fellow who grew up in Brooklyn, is famous for developing inventive ways to teach math to minority students. Because he is in huge demand, he told Dr. Goldstein he was too busy. But Dr. Goldstein asked Dr. Treisman a simple question: When was the last time you had a good corned beef sandwich in Austin? There was a pause. Dr. Treisman agreed to join Dr. Goldstein's commission.</p>

        <p>Theologian Named Provost at St. John's</p>
        <p>Dr. JULIA UPTON, a theologian specializing in liturgical studies and church worship, has been appointed provost of St. John's University. Dr. Upton, a member of the Religious Sisters of Mercy and a full professor at St. John's, hopes to reincorporate teaching into her duties as provost, the chief academic officer of the Roman Catholic university.</p>
        <p>Hunter Students Celebrate Legislative Success</p>
        <p>Students in the Hunter College Welfare Rights Initiative celebrated last week after Gov. GEORGE E. PATAKI signed legislation allowing work-study programs and internships to count as work activity for college students on welfare. Led by MAUREEN LANE, a Hunter honors student and philosophy major, the students worked with a legal aid attorney, RICHARD BLUM, and a CUNY law professor, STEPHEN LOFFREDO, to draft the bill, which was then sponsored by Assemblyman ROBERTO RAMIREZ of the Bronx and Senator RAYMOND A. MEIER of Utica.</p>
        <p>A Big Bang for N.Y.U.'s Astrophysics Program</p>
        <p>New York University has lured four astrophysicists from the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., to be professors in its department of physics. For the four -- ANDREI GRUZINOV, DAVID HOGG, ROMAN SCOCCIMARRO and MATIAS ZALDARRIAGA -- the move is something of a gamble, as N.Y.U. is not known for astrophysics, but the department is trying to raise its profile. Hiring the professors, said Peter Lennie, N.Y.U.'s dean of science, will allow N.Y.U. to establish its cosmology and astrophysics program ''with a bang.''</p>
        <p>John Jay Students to Enter Honor Society</p>
        <p>The John Jay College SEEK program is establishing a chapter in Chi Alpha Epsilon, an honor society for students admitted to colleges through special programs for disadvantaged students. Tomorrow, at the society's first induction ceremony at John Jay, 20 students will become members.</p>
