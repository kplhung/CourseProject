        <p>City officials have decided to settle a federal civil rights case filed by a 19-year-old Brooklyn student who was arrested two years ago for jumping a turnstile when he had, in fact, paid his fare using a MetroCard.</p>
        <p>The case was one of thousands of fare-beating arrests that have been pursued by the police over the last six years as they have focused on minor offenses as a way to catch criminals wanted for more serious crimes.</p>
        <p>But the incident involving the student, Omar Lovell, now 19, demonstrated how the MetroCard system, besides providing discounts, can also provide evidence to help exonerate or, in other cases, prosecute those arrested.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lovell, then a student at the Metropolitan Corporate Academy high school, was arrested and accused of fare evasion on Dec. 30, 1998, after he passed through the turnstile at the Nevins Street station in downtown Brooklyn. He was on his way to a library to research a science project for school. But Mr. Lovell, who had no criminal record, instead spent the next 19 hours in custody and was charged with theft of services, which carries a prison term of up to a year.</p>
        <p>Last summer, at the request of the Brooklyn district attorney's office, a Criminal Court judge in Brooklyn dismissed the charge against Mr. Lovell after computerized MetroCard records obtained by his lawyers showed that he had swiped the school-issued transit card he was carrying through the turnstile at about the same time as he was arrested.</p>
        <p>The federal civil rights case, which Mr. Lovell filed last January, claimed that he had been singled out for arrest because he was black and that he had been falsely arrested and imprisoned.</p>
        <p>The city's lawyers recently signed an agreement saying the city would make no admission of wrongdoing in the arrest, but it would pay Mr. Lovell $40,000, including his court fees and lawyers' costs, to settle the case.</p>
        <p>One of Mr. Lovell's lawyers, Ronald L. Kuby, said yesterday that he considered the settlement a victory not just for Mr. Lovell but for other minority riders who he says are being falsely arrested.</p>
        <p>Kevin Davitt, a spokesman for the Brooklyn district attorney's office, declined yesterday to comment on Mr. Kuby's assertions that the arrest was motivated by race.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kuby said that Mr. Lovell was out of town and not available to comment about the settlement, but that he was happy with it and would put the money toward college. ''This man spent close to six months looking at his whole world collapsing,'' Mr. Kuby added. ''What Omar lost here ultimately was trust in law enforcement.''</p>
