        <p>The Nickelodeon cable network has been the top-rated cable channel on a daily basis for the last five years.</p>
        <p>It seems as if the same magic that has kept it on the top of the cable heap is working in the broadcast world.</p>
        <p>After its parent company, Viacom, bought CBS, Nickelodeon began packaging the broadcast network's Saturday morning cartoon lineup. The lineup, which includes ''Blues Clues,'' ''Dora the Explorer,'' and ''Little Bill,'' is called Nick Jr. on CBS and it is shown from 7 a.m. to noon. It replaced shows like ''Flying Rhinos'' and ''Anatole.''</p>
        <p>Drawing an average of 643,000 viewers ages 2 to 11, the new programming block has so far more than doubled CBS's figures from last fall for Saturday morning children's programming. On Sept. 30, the last Saturday for which ratings were available, it drew an audience of 866,000, three times as large as the one it drew during the same weekend last year.</p>
        <p>But CBS's gain has not been Nickelodeon's loss. Even though its programming is also now available on the broadcast network, Nickelodeon saw its own children's ratings rise by nearly a quarter during the same Saturday morning time period.</p>
