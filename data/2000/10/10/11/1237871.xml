        <p>Governors Are People, Too</p>
        <p>We, as they might say at The New Yorker, wondered what ROGER ANGELL had to say about GOV. GEORGE E. PATAKI'S gaffe about the author E. B. White. We knew that Mr. Angell was White's stepson. We were still cogitating about how, after HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON referred to White in her debate with RICK A. LAZIO on Sunday, Mr. Pataki had disparaged her for mentioning someone the governor said he had never heard of -- ''Wyatt or somebody,'' Mr. Pataki said.</p>
        <p>We found Mr. Angell chuckling yesterday as he answered his telephone at The New Yorker, where he is a writer and editor. When we asked what White would have thought, Mr. Angell told us: ''He'd be tickled pink. This is the only kind of fame he'd appreciate, being taken down by a ninny.''</p>

        <p>Governors Are People, Too</p>
        <p>We, as they might say at The New Yorker, wondered what ROGER ANGELL had to say about GOV. GEORGE E. PATAKI'S gaffe about the author E. B. White. We knew that Mr. Angell was White's stepson. We were still cogitating about how, after HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON referred to White in her debate with RICK A. LAZIO on Sunday, Mr. Pataki had disparaged her for mentioning someone the governor said he had never heard of -- ''Wyatt or somebody,'' Mr. Pataki said.</p>
        <p>We found Mr. Angell chuckling yesterday as he answered his telephone at The New Yorker, where he is a writer and editor. When we asked what White would have thought, Mr. Angell told us: ''He'd be tickled pink. This is the only kind of fame he'd appreciate, being taken down by a ninny.''</p>
        <p>We said something -- we do not remember what, because that last word caught us by surprise -- and Mr. Angell continued: ''I can almost see his expression coming out of his study with something that really tickled him, an impish look on his face, absolute delight. He had an ego like everybody else, but he was very private. This is the kind of un-privacy that would make his day.''</p>
        <p>Later we called Mr. Pataki's office in Albany and told MICHAEL McKEON, a spokesman for the governor, what Mr. Angell had told us. Mr. McKeon's reaction to the word ''ninny'' was another word beginning with the letter N: ''Nasty.''</p>
        <p>Then Mr. McKeon told us the same kinds of things he told other reporters on Monday. ''When the governor got home on Sunday, he got an earful from his daughter EMILY, who I believe is a senior at Yale,'' he said. ''She reminded her father that they read 'Charlotte's Web' together often when she was growing up and that he enjoyed the book with all four kids. So, you know, he made a mistake. Even governors are human.''</p>
        <p>Hors d'oeuvre? Broach? Earring?</p>
        <p>After the artichoke hearts and before the fish, the waiters brought out the jewelry, trays of diamonds and pearls and emeralds. The idea was that the guests at a lunch given by the philanthropist CARROLL PETRIE would try on the three B's (think ''Kismet'' -- baubles, bangles and beads) and decide to bid on them at an auction for Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center on Oct. 23.</p>
        <p>PATRICIA BUCKLEY tried on a sapphire ring and pronounced it too small.</p>
        <p>Then JOANNE DE GUARDIOLA, an interior designer, lifted an emerald-and-diamond necklace from the tray. She discarded that in favor of a tanzanite-and-diamond brooch that looked like two flowers; each flower can be detached and worn as an earring. Phillips, the auction house that is handling the sale for Sloan-Kettering, estimates that the brooch-or-earring combination will sell for $150,000 to $200,000. (Phillips is also co-sponsoring the opening night gala of the International Fine Arts and Antique Dealers Show next week, which will benefit Sloan-Kettering.)</p>
        <p>Mrs. de Guardiola said she liked the convenience of its convertability. ''It makes it so much easier to explain to one's husband,'' she said. ''It's almost two for the price of one. And Christmas is coming.''</p>
        <p>She left the pin on during the meal, and was still wearing it when the waiters took the rest of the jewelry away.</p>
        <p>In a few minutes, a waiter handed a note to JOSEPH CIFARELLI, the director of Phillips's jewelry department. He chuckled and told the waiter not to worry about the pin, which Mrs. de Guardiola was still wearing. ''She's a good model,'' he said. She gave it back before dessert.</p>
        <p>Later, CHRISTOPHER THOMSON, the chief executive of Phillips, was asked about Phillips's search for new quarters -- it is looking to move from East 79th Street near First Avenue -- and how much space it needs.  ''Someone has said Phillips is only the third-largest auction house in the world,'' he said, ''but in fact we are the largest auction house in the world not to be under criminal investigation.''</p>
