        <p>Adding an important campaign finance case to the docket for its new term, the Supreme Court agreed today to decide whether current limits on the amount parties can spend in coordination with their Congressional candidates are constitutionally valid.</p>
        <p>A federal appeals court in Denver ruled in May that the spending limits, a part of federal campaign law for the past 26 years, violated the parties' right to free speech. The ruling came in a 15-year-old dispute about a United States Senate race in Colorado that had reached the Supreme Court once before, in 1996, when a divided court cast doubt on the limits' constitutionality without resolving the issue. Since then, the court's solicitude for the First Amendment rights of political parties has, if anything, increased.</p>

        <p>Adding an important campaign finance case to the docket for its new term, the Supreme Court agreed today to decide whether current limits on the amount parties can spend in coordination with their Congressional candidates are constitutionally valid.</p>
        <p>A federal appeals court in Denver ruled in May that the spending limits, a part of federal campaign law for the past 26 years, violated the parties' right to free speech. The ruling came in a 15-year-old dispute about a United States Senate race in Colorado that had reached the Supreme Court once before, in 1996, when a divided court cast doubt on the limits' constitutionality without resolving the issue. Since then, the court's solicitude for the First Amendment rights of political parties has, if anything, increased.</p>
        <p>The spending limits apply to the use of ''hard'' money by political parties in the general election -- contributions that must meet strict federal restrictions concerning the amounts that can be donated. The limits on expenditures are based on the voting-age population of each state and, applying a formula of roughly seven cents a person, range this year from a low of $67,560 for Senate races in the 12 smallest states to $1.6 million in California. For elections to the House of Representatives, the limit is $33,780.</p>
        <p>As a practical matter, the permissible expenditures are double those amounts, because the limits apply both to state party committees and the national parties, and the state committees usually assign their expenditures to the national party.</p>
        <p>In its Supreme Court appeal, the Federal Election Commission said the appellate decision ''underestimates the potential for abuse inherent in large-scale spending by political parties'' and ''significantly undermines'' the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1974.</p>
        <p>But the Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee told the justices that the decision was simply an overdue recognition that parties have a ''special interdependent relationship'' and share a common purpose with their own nominees.</p>
        <p>Because the party-expenditure provision is a singular feature of campaign law, the case, Federal Election Commission v. Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee, No. 00-191, may not be one to draw the court into a broad review of campaign finance in general.</p>
        <p>But in deciding it, the court may still have to examine more generally the constitutional rationale for limits on the use of money in politics.</p>
        <p>In a case last term from Missouri, the court reaffirmed the validity of the $1,000 limit on contributions to candidates for federal office. While that decision had a narrow focus, several justices indicated dissatisfaction with the law in this area and suggested that the time for a broader look might be approaching.</p>
        <p>The Federal Election Campaign Act is the same complex statute the court reviewed in its landmark 1976 decision, Buckley v. Valeo.</p>
        <p>In that ruling, which did not decide the constitutionality of the party expenditure provision, the court set up what many see as an increasingly awkward dichotomy between political contributions and expenditures. The court said that contributions could be limited, to prevent corruption, but that candidates' own spending, or independent, uncoordinated spending on their behalf, could not.</p>
        <p>The party-expenditure provision at issue in the new case is a hybrid, dealing with what the statute calls an expenditure but that the commission has always treated as the functional equivalent of a contribution.</p>
        <p>The case began in 1986, when the Federal Election Commission charged the Colorado Republican committee with exceeding its state limit by buying radio time to run an advertisement critical of Timothy E. Wirth, then the likely Democratic Senate nominee. Mr. Wirth went on to be elected.</p>
        <p>In response, the party argued that the limits were unconstitutional and that, in any event, the expenditure was ''independent'' of any candidate and should be exempt from limits.</p>
        <p>In its 1996 decision, the Supreme Court accepted the characterization of the expenditure as an independent one and so did not rule on whether a coordinated expenditure could constitutionally be limited. The Colorado Republicans then continued their challenge to the provision as a whole.</p>
        <p>In an interview today, Jan Witold Baran, a lawyer representing the Colorado Republicans, said the state of the law was ''bizarre'' because ''everyone in the country knows that political parties and their candidates work together all the time.''</p>
