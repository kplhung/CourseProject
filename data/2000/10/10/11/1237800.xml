        <p>IN this, the Internet era, when ''instant'' is too slow for some people, millions of Americans still want to go fast the old-fashioned way -- with lots of chrome, authentic hubcaps and engines that evoke a mechanical age, not a technological one. Some crave power, some chase status, all seek to be one with their car of yesteryear.</p>
        <p>But not just any car. It must be the right car. A car that says, ''This is who I really am.''</p>

        <p>IN this, the Internet era, when ''instant'' is too slow for some people, millions of Americans still want to go fast the old-fashioned way -- with lots of chrome, authentic hubcaps and engines that evoke a mechanical age, not a technological one. Some crave power, some chase status, all seek to be one with their car of yesteryear.</p>
        <p>But not just any car. It must be the right car. A car that says, ''This is who I really am.''</p>
        <p>Sheathed in metal, literally wearing the thing they love, drivers of vintage and collectible cars exist in a comforting and contemporaneous past, transcending time. If motoring can be romantic, a 1958 Oldsmobile Rocket 88 is Freud on overdrive.</p>
        <p>Day to day, of course, we drive minivans to take the children to soccer. We drive aging Corollas to the train station. But some of us also drive ancient MG's or Thunderbirds or Coupe DeVilles to get to places even MapQuest cannot pinpoint.</p>
        <p>The conventional wisdom goes like this: Baby boomers, with empty nests and expendable income, are prepared to indulge their automotive fantasies, and you can always tell who owns what. New-economy entrepreneurs demand investment-grade European cars; middle-aged former denizens of high school auto shop covet muscle cars like the Plymouth Barracuda and Dodge Challenger. Losers end up with the A.M.C. Gremlin.</p>
        <p>Yes and no. Most car people are tinkerers. Many have been enamored of intake manifolds since adolescence. Some want to make a statement. Some want a link with their childhood. Some just like the car. And some, like Chip Miller, like the car a lot.</p>
        <p>At 57, he has been wiping greasy hands on overalls since junior high school. He owns 40 vintage Corvettes. ''I have insane amounts of garage space,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''I was in the car culture when it was really happening,'' added Mr. Miller, who, with his partner, Bill Miller (no relation), owns the Carlisle, Pa., fairgrounds, home to two big car meets, Spring Carlisle and Fall Carlisle.</p>
        <p>''I was 13 1/2 years old, and I had a one-mile walk home from school,'' he said. ''I found this tiny car magazine in the gutter, about half the size of a regular magazine. I must have read that thing 10 times. I didn't know anything about cars. My parents hated cars except to drive them. My dad would never check the oil. He'd wait for steam to come out before checking the water level in the radiator.''</p>
        <p>AT 15, a year before he could get a driver's license, Chip Miller bought his first car, a 1951 Ford coupe. Price: $100. It needed work.</p>
        <p>While his classmates at Jenkintown High School, near Philadelphia, were playing baseball, he was scouring junkyards for transmission bolts.</p>
        <p>One car led to another, even as life intervened. He graduated from the two-year engineering program at the State University of New York at Farmingdale. He married. He bought another old Ford. Eventually, Fords gave way to Corvettes, and the passion intensified.</p>
        <p>In the early 70's, the two Mr. Millers met at a car auction. Chip Miller owned a '54 Corvette at the time. He had planned to take it to the big meet at Hershey, Pa., but exhibitors were limited to models from 1940 and earlier. Feeling left out, the two men started their own show, in Carlisle. The first, Prewar '74, attracted cars from the 40's, 50's and 60's. There were 800 stalls at the first show. Now, on 81 acres, there are 8,200 stalls and a car corral with 1,800 classic cars.</p>
        <p>Among them is one of Chip Miller's Corvettes, with the lowest mileage of any car at the show from the first production year.</p>
        <p>''They only made 300 in 1953,'' he said. ''I paid $5,000 for it in 1972. It's the centerpiece of my collection. The only one I ever borrowed money for. Today it's worth $250,000, and the odometer reads 8,788. I'm committed never to turning it to five digits.''</p>
        <p>Chip Miller's story begins to sound familiar once you start talking to other owners of old cars. Some, like Mr. Miller, have made careers out of their passion. Others simply enjoy weekend drives, or going to a car show and preening. They are, or have become, what they drive.</p>
        <p>No one who knows the vintage-car field can quantify the obsession. Hemmings Motor News, the car traders' bible, won't even guess, although it lists more than 9,000 car clubs on its Web site. The Antique Automobile Club of America, in Hershey, says it has no idea how many collectors exist or how much they spend on restorations each year.</p>
        <p>But Ty Bennett, a spokesman for Kruse International of Auburn, Ind., an auction house that sells cars nationwide, provided a hint. Kruse, the largest auctioneer of its kind, says it has sold 350,000 vintage or collectible cars in the last 30 years for $3.5 billion. The size of the huge secondary market in accessories and auto parts is anybody's guess. If all these buyers voted in a bloc, American politics might be changed forever.</p>
        <p>RICHARD BEABOUT bought his first DeSoto in 1986. It was a 1947 sedan that had been in a barn for 20 years.  He had never owned a DeSoto, but had driven Chryslers for years. He and his wife, Betty, needed an older car to enter an antiques-auto hill climb -- timed like a drag race -- near their home in Marshall, Ill., a town near the Indiana border about 90 miles west of Indianapolis. So they trucked the car home and went to work.</p>
        <p>''Well,'' said Mr. Beabout (pronounced BEE-bout), 64, a retired machinist for Caterpillar Tractor, ''just before we got the '47 ready for the hill climb, a friend of mine in town said he had a '54 DeSoto. And I bought it.'' He paused. ''Then I had two DeSotos.''</p>
        <p>In the hill climb, Mrs. Beabout drove the '47 and the '54. His wife won the competition.</p>
        <p>''She's now known as the racing grandmother in the national DeSoto Club,'' Mr. Beabout said.</p>
        <p>After the DeSotos came a '36 Chrysler Airflow and then more DeSotos. ''I have six cars in a two-car garage,'' he said, laughing. ''But we've expanded several times.''</p>
        <p>If Mr. Beabout is an accidental DeSoto owner (''It could have been a Hudson or a Packard, I guess''), Joel Cooper, a 46-year-old mail carrier in Hartford, is the man with a mission: the 1970 Dodge Dart. No other year will do.</p>
        <p>''I've probably stripped 25 of them, to get parts for the ones I'm working on,'' Mr. Cooper said.</p>
        <p>There was a time when he could barely change transmission oil. ''I knew nothing,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But the big Dodge engines available in the early 70's, and the lure of street racing, sold him on the Dart, a car that started as a compact family sedan and grew to be part of a Dodge-Plymouth cohort with names like Demon, Duster and Barracuda.</p>
        <p>Mr. Beabout is a DeSoto guy. Mr. Cooper is a Dodge guy.</p>
        <p>Until recently, it had never occurred to me that I, too, could be a car guy. I drove a 1992 Mercury Topaz, a car I did not wish to be, and a car decidedly not of pedigreed vintage.</p>
        <p>My Topaz was too much like the cars I grew up with: anonymous, unreliable, uncool. And certainly not collectible. At the end, it was barely functioning as a station car, with 130,000 miles on the odometer, no air-conditioning (I gave up after it failed for the third time) and a $900 brake job on the horizon. Its book value, if perfect, was less than $500.</p>
        <p>Which made it worthy of inclusion in the pantheon of clunkers that my father had owned: a sinister black 1948 Mercury sedan, a used '54 DeSoto convertible with the transmission that caught fire and a '63 Dodge Dart with turquoise, grease-absorbing upholstery.</p>
        <p>Only one of Dad's cars ever worked well -- the bilious green 1955 Plymouth Plaza. But like the Topaz, it began to show its age. Same problem with the old Mercury. Brand new in '48, it looked a lot like a '39, the year Ford first brought out the Mercury line.</p>
        <p>By the early 50's, once war shortages ended and design studios cranked up, American cars started to look more like bullets than homburgs. Sitting in the driveway, hearselike, five years after my father  drove it off the lot, the Mercury was a brooding, humpback thing, compared with the flashy two-tone Pontiacs and Chevys that gleamed outside neighbors' garages. By 1960, I was the only kid on the block whose family car did not have dual headlights and tail fins.</p>
        <p>But now I want that '48 Mercury back, or maybe the DeSoto. Or a 1957 Chevy Bel Air, the Doris Day of automobiles.</p>
        <p>''It's adolescence,'' said John Heitmann, a professor of history at the University of Dayton who teaches a course on the automobile and American life. ''They are the cars that were around you and wanted. Or maybe the cars you couldn't have.''</p>
        <p>''My dad had a '48 Chevy,'' Dr. Heitmann, who is 52, added. ''That was the car I grew up with. A couple of weeks ago, I came across a '48 Chevy convertible at a cruise-in in nearby Kettering. I couldn't take my eyes off it. All those knobs on the dashboard, those little nuances of the interior.''</p>
        <p>Professor Heitmann drives a 1971 Porsche 911.</p>
        <p>''Well, I don't think there's one pattern to collecting,'' he said. ''But there are parallel kinds of motives. The overall pattern I see far more is with people who really know how to appreciate a technological past that puts the person in touch with the machine. The man-and-machine relationship emerges. People who drive old cars are like people who choose a Swiss mechanical watch over a quartz movement, or the fountain pen over an inkjet printer. The difference between my Porsche and the newer ones is like night and day. There is a phenomenal feel to an older auto.''</p>
        <p>Professor Heitmann is on to something. A combination of aesthetics and performance, something an owner-tinkerer can control.</p>
        <p>This dovetails nicely with the thesis of John Armstrong, a research fellow in philosophy and the director of the aesthetics program at the School of Advanced Study, University of London.</p>
        <p>''When we get really passionate about a particular kind of car,'' Dr. Armstrong said, ''it is often because it taps into a deep longing we have. But for what? In a beautiful car, everything is 'just right.' The shape of the headlamps complements the lines of the radiator grille; the bonnet relates perfectly to the boot. If the chassis were an inch higher off the ground the car would lose its appearance of power; an inch lower and it would seem to drag.</p>
        <p>''You can actually possess and drive a car -- you can get within this beauty and be part of it -- the better you handle the car, the more fully its qualities are revealed,'' said Dr. Armstrong, whose book ''An Intimate Philosophy of Art,'' was published last month. ''This enacts an ideal of what life ought to be like but almost never is.''</p>
        <p>That leaves nostalgia partly unaddressed. In the century that made them not only popular but also indispensable, cars have become part of the family story. You can trace family mishaps, milestones and personalties through them.</p>
        <p>MY father's old Mercury let us down on several occasions, including in a snowstorm on the way to my grandmother's house. We sat in the cold for hours, and I got the measles. The used '54 DeSoto, which Dad insisted on taking to Vermont for a vacation one summer, caught fire as we pulled into a gas station on the New York State Thruway. The '63 Dart was totaled by a school bus that my mother did not see. Is that part of the reason those cars appeal to me?</p>
        <p>Joseph J. Tecce, a 66-year-old psychology professor at Boston College, has spent years examining the collector in American society. He said people collect things -- cars, for instance -- for the satisfaction of being known and being knowledgeable, or to protect memories of the good old days. What we collect can make us feel good about ourselves, he said. In particular, cars can function as ''social midwife or automotive alter ego.''</p>
        <p>And while Professor Tecce (the name rhymes with fetch) has graduated from the Volkswagens of the 60's and 70's (''I guess I was saying, 'Look at me, I am a humble college professor' '') to the security of a Toyota Camry, he cannot forget his 1948 Plymouth. ''Inside it was comfortable and roomy, economical to run,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''You know, wanting an old car like that Plymouth,'' he went on, ''is kind of like  wanting to go back and reverse the clock and get away from the Teflon, automatic, fast-paced jet age that we live in. To go back via the car, when there were fewer cars, less road rage, less road stress.</p>
        <p>''It's two things,'' he said. ''We can turn back the clock automotively, and we can turn back the clock psychologically. Some will want to do one, and not the other. Some will do both.''</p>
        <p>So the old Mercury beckons. And the Topaz? The Topaz, a discontinued model, is gone, given to charity for a tax deduction. I do not miss it. But surprisingly, my 14-year-old son was sorry to see it go.</p>
        <p>He said he had hoped to fix it up, cover the seats with fake leopard skin and apply flame decals to the front doors.</p>
        <p>He had hoped, he said, to get his license in that old car.</p>
