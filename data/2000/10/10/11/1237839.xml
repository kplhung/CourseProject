        <p>If American companies have any lingering doubts about Mario Monti's toughness, they are likely to be dispelled on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Monti, the European Union's chief antitrust regulator, is expected to approve the proposed $165 billion merger between Time Warner Inc. and America Online Inc. -- but not without extracting a heavy price.</p>
        <p>Already, after weeks of sparring with Mr. Monti and his merger task force, Time Warner reluctantly agreed last Thursday to abandon a separate $20 billion deal to combine the operations of Warner Music with the EMI Group of Britain.</p>
        <p>America Online and Time Warner, meanwhile, have promised, among other things, to open their online networks to competing providers of entertainment.</p>
        <p>This is the latest but hardly the only case in which European and American corporations have had their mergers thwarted or at least modified by Mr. Monti, a soft-spoken, silver-haired Italian economist.</p>
        <p>Since he became the commissioner in charge of competition affairs last year, Mr. Monti has become feared and respected as a man with the power to derail some of the world's biggest mergers if he is convinced they would restrict competition.</p>
        <p>Last spring, he blocked WorldCom's planned $115 billion combination with Sprint. Shortly before that, his objections forced Sweden's two big truck manufacturers, Volvo and Scania, to abandon their plans for a $7 billion merger. Also this year, Mr. Monti effectively blocked a $17 billion merger of three of the world's biggest aluminum companies, Alcan Aluminium of Canada, Pechiney of France and the Alusuisse Lonza Group of Switzerland.</p>
        <p>This toughness is not entirely new. Mr. Monti's predecessor, Karel Van Miert, almost blocked the merger of Boeing and McDonnell-Douglas in 1997. Boeing salvaged the deal by capitulating to demands that it abandon its exclusive long-term sales contracts with several airlines.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Monti has stepped up the pace. With a staff of only 47 investigators on his Merger Task Force, he has picked his shots carefully but plunged ferociously into many of the world's biggest and most complex deals.</p>
        <p>''People say he is much tougher,'' said Christopher Norall, an antitrust lawyer at the firm of Morrison &amp; Foerster here. ''But, to be fair, these cases present new issues where each wave of mergers brings successive waves of concentration.''</p>
        <p>Over the last decade, the European Commission has rejected only 13 mergers outright. Three of those rejections have come in the year since Mr. Monti took office, and two other companies rescinded their plans before they were officially rejected. But the number of mergers has escalated rapidly, and the vast majority are still approved without controversy. This year, commission officials predict that they will review 340 mergers, up from 292 in 1999.</p>
        <p>Indeed, American antitrust officials have reached many of the same conclusions as Mr. Monti. Within days of the European Commission's decision to block the WorldCom-Sprint merger, for example, the United States Justice Department went to court to block the deal as well.</p>
        <p>American officials did not appear as worried as the Europeans about the deal between Warner Music and EMI. But they may well be much tougher about Time Warner's merger with America Online, because Time Warner can use its vast cable television operations in the United States to provide high-speed online services.</p>
        <p>In Europe, by contrast, Time Warner has no cable television systems and America Online is smaller than local online services in every European country.</p>
        <p>Mr. Monti, a methodical man who measures his words carefully, often speaks like an academic and was in fact a professor of economics and adviser to the Italian government earlier in his career. Though Mr. Monti professes loyalty to the ''social market economy,'' he has long been a champion of deregulation and free trade.</p>
        <p>Before taking his current job, he spent four years as the European Union's commissioner in charge of harmonizing the various countries' conflicting rules. In essence, Mr. Monti led the effort to dismantle the legal barriers among the 15 members of the European Union.</p>
        <p>He pushed for years to persuade European governments to adopt common tax practices, a Sisyphean task that remains mostly unfinished.</p>
        <p>But he also showed himself ready to disregard relentless pressure from both governments and corporations. His biggest political battle and success was in rescinding the tax-free status of duty-free shops at airports and harbors.</p>
        <p>Trivial as it sounded, the issue provoked furious protests and even street demonstrations by workers in various industries, including duty-free retailers, airlines and liquor companies.</p>
        <p>Mr. Monti argued that duty-free shops merely allowed affluent travelers to avoid sales taxes because duties between European Union countries had already been eliminated. After a long battle, he finally won.</p>
        <p>He replaced Mr. Van Miert as the competition regulator last year, after accusations of corruption led to a complete overhaul of all the top posts. Neither man was among those accused of any impropriety, but both joined all the other commissioners in voluntarily resigning. Mr. Monti was among a handful of people reappointed to a commission post by Romano Prodi, the European Commission's new president.</p>
        <p>Mr. Monti differs sharply from Mr. Van Miert in both style and substance. Mr. Van Miert, a former leader of the Flemish Socialist party in Belgium, routinely made off-the-cuff remarks in public well in advance of final decisions. He also liked to bargain with companies, extracting as many concessions as possible without having to wage a full-court battle.</p>
        <p>The current antitrust chief keeps his opinions to himself and he has been much more distant in dealing with the companies. Rather than starting with aggressive demands and backing down, Mr. Monti has picked his targets carefully and then has held firm.</p>
        <p>Time Warner and EMI may have learned this a bit late. Mr. Monti objected that their deal would severely reduce the number of worldwide rivals in music distribution, and he was not satisfied when EMI offered to spin off some of its smaller European labels.</p>
        <p>Under the rules, the companies were supposed to offer any proposed remedies by Sept. 18. But it was only two weeks ago, after the companies realized that Mr. Monti was ready to block the deal, that they offered to sell Virgin records, one of EMI's major record labels.</p>
        <p>It remains unclear whether Time Warner and EMI simply miscalculated by waiting so long.  But Mark Powell, an antitrust expert in Brussels with the law firm of White &amp; Case, said the commission had been much stricter about deadlines precisely because it wanted to limit last-minute bargaining.</p>
        <p>''There is much less room for maneuver,'' Mr. Powell said. ''At the least, companies going into these deals should have thought through all their fallback positions in case the going gets tough.''</p>
