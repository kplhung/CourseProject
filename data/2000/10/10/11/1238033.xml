        <p>LIEBERMAN-Hillel Eliyahu. Yeshiva University and its affiliated Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary mourn with profound sorrow the tragic death of a devoted Yeshiva College alumnus murdered by an enraged and incited Palestinian mob near Joseph's Tomb-thus becoming the latest martyr for Eretz Israel. His sacrifice will not be forgotten, and the memory of his courage and conviction will always inspire us. Our hearts go out to his wife, Yael; his seven children; parents, Rabbi Zevulun (and Joyce Bracha) Lieberman, rosh yeshiva and holder of the Maxwell R. Maybaum Memorial Chair in Talmud and Sephardic Codes (Halakhah), RIETS; sisters, Tehilla and Elyora Chaya; and the entire family. May the Almighty comfort them among all who mourn for Zion and Jerusalem. Dr. Norman Lamm, President Yeshiva University Robert M. Beren, Chairman Board of Trustees</p>
