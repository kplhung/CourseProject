        <p>Argentina's president, Fernando de la Rua, would appear to have some problems.</p>
        <p>In the last few days, his vice president has resigned over a corruption scandal, his poll numbers have tumbled and the country's stock market has plunged. Members of his governing alliance's congressional delegation are publicly bickering with his intelligence chief, putting his legislative agenda in jeopardy. And a leading political magazine published his photograph this week under the title ''Joke of the Year.''</p>
        <p>But according to Mr. de la Rua this is merely a blip of turbulence that will soon pass.</p>
        <p>''Things are O.K.,'' he said in his office at the presidential palace today, smiling tightly. ''There is no crisis. The president is functioning.''</p>
        <p>''These are days of some conflict but everyone is attempting to strengthen the Alianza,'' he said, referring to the governing coalition.</p>
        <p>More substantively, only four days after Vice President Carlos Alvarez resigned protesting that the administration was not doing enough to fight corruption, Mr. de la Rua denied that any officials in his government bribed opposition senators to enact a new labor code. He said the government's anticorruption office had examined the secret accounts of his intelligence chief and found nothing askew.</p>
        <p>''There is no concrete evidence,'' Mr. de la Rua said of the allegations that his government had paid up to 11 opposition senators to approve the  new labor code, which makes it easier for businesses to fire newly hired workers and lower business costs.</p>
        <p>In a swipe at Mr. Alvarez, the president said, ''The episode was in the Senate, not the government, and the vice president was president of the Senate.''</p>
        <p>Mr. de la Rua also insisted that a cabinet shake-up last week would make his economic policies more effective. He promised not to change his emphasis on reducing budget deficits through spending cuts and higher taxes as a means of bringing down interest rates, and said he hoped that better commodity prices next year would increase economic growth.  Growth this year is projected at 1.5 to 2 percent after a 3 percent decline in 1999.</p>
        <p>Anxiety over the economy among  investors grew last week when Mr. Alvarez resigned, threatening to splinter the governing coalition at a time when speculation is growing that Argentina may have trouble paying the interest on its debt next year.</p>
        <p>''The political crisis could not come at a worse moment,'' wrote Walter Molano, head of research for BCP Securities, a brokerage firm in Greenwich, Conn., in a report to investors today. ''Attempts to trim back pork-barrel spending, subsidies and special initiatives in the provinces are generating a great deal of political infighting.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Alvarez said he had decided he could no longer serve in the government when two officials -- the intelligence chief, Fernando de Santibanes, and Labor Minister Alberto Flamarique -- survived the cabinet shake-up last week though both had been implicated in the bribery scandal. Mr. Flamarique was promoted to become the president's chief of staff last Thursday, but resigned the next day after Mr. Alvarez stepped down.</p>
        <p>Now Mr. de la Rua is in damage control mode. Normally reluctant to give interviews, he has become suddenly talkative with the press. Appearing Monday night on Argentina's most popular talk show with his wife, daughter and two grandchildren, he denied four times that there was any crisis.</p>
        <p>Mr. Santibanes, the second most powerful man in the government, is working hard to clear his name, surprising reporters by calling them at home to grant them exclusive interviews they never asked for.</p>
        <p>''The people who are calling for my resignation cannot claim corruption,'' Mr. Santibanes said in an interview. ''It's politics. There are people who do not like me.''</p>
        <p>He identified his political enemies as Mr. Alvarez and several congressmen aligned with Frepaso, a social democratic party in the governing coalition.</p>
        <p>Asked if any bribes had been paid to senators to approve the new labor code, Mr. Santibanes responded: ''We have no evidence of that. I'd rather not give my personal opinion on this. We are looking.''</p>
        <p>Since resigning from the vice presidency, Mr. Alvarez has repeatedly attacked Mr. Santibanes, saying he had conspired against him and others in the Frepaso party, and has demanded the intelligence chief's resignation.</p>
        <p>But today Mr. de la Rua stood by Mr. Santibanes and said the conflict would soon be resolved.</p>
        <p>''The fight against corruption is basic for this government,'' he said. And he predicted that his coalition would wrest control of the Senate from the opposition next year ''if we overcome these problems in the coming days.''</p>
