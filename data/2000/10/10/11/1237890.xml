        <p>In a battle between Calvin and Linda, strike up one for Warnaco and its chief executive, Linda Wachner.</p>
        <p>A federal judge denied a motion yesterday to dismiss all but one and part of another of the nine counts in a counterclaim lawsuit that Warnaco had filed against Calvin Klein Inc.</p>
        <p>The decision in United States District Court in Manhattan moves Warnaco closer to presenting its case for who breached the Klein jeanswear license.</p>
        <p>The dispute began this spring, when Calvin Klein failed to find a buyer for his company and withdrew it from the market. In June, the company filed suit to break a licensing pact with Warnaco. Warnaco filed counterclaims, asserting that Mr. Klein had hurt the jeanswear business by providing unsaleable designs, failing to advertise effectively and engaging in a smear campaign.</p>
