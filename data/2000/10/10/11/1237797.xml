        <p>CAR crashes are the primary cause of death among children ages 6 to 14 in the United States, killing more than 1,800 of them a year. And though the numbers of deaths of children 5 and under has been falling with the widespread use of safety seats, experts say the use of proper restraints among older children is the best way to reduce fatalities further.</p>
        <p>The first step is choosing a child-safe car, one that can accommodate the proper number of appropriate safety seats, in their correct positions, for young passengers of every age and size.</p>
        <p>The back seats of some small cars and pickup trucks, for example, are not big enough for safety seats, especially infant seats in the rear-facing position, which is recommended for babies through age 1 and weighing up to about 20 pounds. Deep bucket seats in some cars can be a problem. So can a hump in the middle of the back seat. Side-facing jump seats in some pickup trucks are not a safe option.</p>
        <p>Cars that have only lap belts in the rear seat are fine for infant seats, but not for some models of booster seats, which are designed so that shoulder belts can be positioned properly across a child's body. Owners of such cars would want the manufacturer to install shoulder belts.</p>
        <p>Once a car is chosen, the next step in ensuring children's safety involves the proper installation and use of all safety equipment -- whether built in, like belts, air bags and locks, or added on, like booster seats for older youngsters.</p>
        <p>Safety experts agree on certain basics:</p>
        <p>* Built-in child safety seats are an attractive option for children between 1 and 4, because they do not need to be secured to the car by a seat belt.</p>
        <p>* For those who prefer removable safety seats for this age group, the most secure system involves attachments that should be standard in the back seats of most newer cars. In older cars where only the seat belts hold the safety seat in place, correct installation is critical.</p>
        <p>* For children weighing 40 to 80 pounds, booster seats are recommended; they position children so that an adult seat belt fits correctly across the shoulder and lap.</p>
        <p>* Seat-belt adjusters -- attachments that force a seat belt to cross a child's body at chest level -- are an acceptable alternative to booster seats for older children. They are generally not recommended by safety agencies partly because parents often fail to read the labels, using the devices on children who are not the correct age.</p>
        <p>* No child younger than 12 should be allowed to ride in the front seat of a car, where a rapidly inflating air bag could become a deadly weapon. But if it cannot be avoided, because the car is too small or there are too many children to be secured in the back seat, it is best to have an on-off switch to control air bags so that they cannot inflate. Side air bags may not be desirable next to seats that will hold an infant in a car seat.</p>
        <p>* New cars have safety locks that form part of the back-door latch system on the side of the door. They allow doors to be locked so that they cannot be opened from the inside.</p>
        <p>The principal means for saving children's lives on the road is the use of car seats or booster seats, safety experts say. But children outgrow car seats and must graduate from a rear-facing infant seat to a midsize one and into a booster seat before they are big enough to use adult-size seat belts.</p>
        <p>State laws require all infants and toddlers to travel in car safety seats. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that infants weighing less than 20 pounds and younger than 1 year old ride in rear-facing safety seats in the back seat.</p>
        <p>Children who reach 20 pounds before their first birthday should also ride facing the rear in a ''convertible'' seat; after the first birthday, that seat can be turned around. Front-facing child seats should be used until the child is about 40 pounds or 40 inches tall, usually around age 4.</p>
        <p>Safety ground rules change slightly for children ages 4 through 8. Safety experts say that these children should sit in specially designed booster seats. Based on several studies, safety authorities estimate that only 6 percent of children who are the right size for booster seats actually use them.</p>
        <p>In general, booster seats are not attached to the vehicle but are held in place by the child's body weight and a seat belt. But in safety seats for younger children, the systems for attaching them to the car have been much improved. Those child seats used to be held solely by the car's seat belt. But in recent years, manufacturers have been building attachment points into cars and light trucks to accommodate the special tether straps on many child safety seats.</p>
        <p>THE tether straps attach the top rear of the safety seat (just behind the child's head) to the shelf behind the rear seat of a passenger car, or to the floor of a van or sport utility vehicle. Many new seats have the tether, but the attachment hardware is not always included in cars or with the seats.</p>
        <p>Under new federal rules, 80 percent of cars produced this year will have the tether attachment points. By next year, all passenger vehicles must have them. All new seats are required to meet tough new safety requirements ensuring that they are held securely in place, and most manufacturers are expected to equip them with tether attachments to meet those requirements.</p>
        <p>But safety-conscious parents should also know that under the new rules, an improved anchoring system for child seats has been developed: the system is called Latch, an acronym for lower-anchorage tether for children. It has not only the upper tether, but also two lower anchor points, each a rigid, round rod or bar onto which a hook or other connector can be snapped. The bars will be located where the vehicle's seat cushion meets the back of the child seat.</p>
        <p>A few new models have this system in place. By September 2001, 20 percent of all new vehicles will have it, as will half of all 2002 models and every vehicle made after Sept. 1, 2002. All new child seats made by then will be equipped for the lower anchorages. Among the cars already equipped with the Latch system, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, are the Ford Focus, Volkswagen's five compact models, the BMW 3 series midsize and X5 sport utility vehicles and the Ford Windstar van.</p>
        <p>STUDIES show that child safety seats are 70 percent effective in preventing death and serious injury in crashes if they are properly installed. But 85 percent of all seats are installed incorrectly, safety authorities have found -- one reason that  safety experts like James E. Hall, the chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, advocate integrated child safety seats that are built into the vehicle.</p>
        <p>Typically, an integrated seat is hidden in the back of a rear passenger seat. Folded down, it forms a child-size seat with a recessed seat-back and harnesses.</p>
        <p>The option, which typically costs a couple of hundred dollars, is available mostly in vans, like the Chevrolet Venture, Chrysler Town &amp; Country LX, Dodge Caravan and Grand Caravan, Mercury Villager, Nissan Quest, Plymouth Voyager and Grand Voyager and Pontiac Montana.</p>
        <p>But as children grow to about 40 pounds, they can outgrow both integrated and removable child safety seats. That is when it is critically important to buy a booster seat, safety agencies urge.</p>
        <p>No child should sit on a car's normal seat, which is designed for an adult, unless his or her legs are long enough to allow the knees to bend comfortably over the edge of the seat, without slouching the hips forward to reach. Otherwise the child is too small to wear an adult seat belt properly. Typically, a child who weighs about 80 pounds is old enough to give up a booster seat.</p>
        <p>For families whose vehicles do not have built-in car seats, DaimlerChrysler dealers are offering free inspection services: those who ask -- customers or not, regardless of the car they drive -- can have their child safety seats inspected for proper installation. Trained inspectors check not only whether the seat has been installed correctly, but also whether it is damaged or subject to a recall. They also ensure that the seat is appropriate for the child's size. Parents may make appointments for inspections by telephoning (877) FIT-4-A-KID (877-348-4254) or by logging onto www.fitforakid.org, to find a participating dealer. Police departments, first-aid squads, hospitals and civic groups offer similar inspections.</p>
        <p>Car owners can obtain authorization from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to have an air bag on-off switch installed by a dealer or repair shop if they cannot avoid situations, like a car pool, that require a child 12 or younger to ride in the front seat, or if they cannot avoid placing a rear-facing infant seat up front.</p>
        <p>Information about choosing a car seat is available in ''Buying a Safer Car for Child Passengers,'' a brochure from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. To ensure that a seat has not been recalled because of design defects, you can call the safety agency at (800) 424-9393. A brochure about air bag switches is also available, as are applications for permission to have them installed and information about where they can be obtained. Telephone: N.H.T.S.A. Auto Safety Hot Line, 888-DASH-2-DOT (888-327-4236). Or write to: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 400 Seventh Street SW, NTS-21, Washington, D.C. 20590 (fax: 202-493-2062).</p>
        <p>The brochures, forms and other resources are also available at the agency's Web site: www.nhtsa.dot.gov.</p>
