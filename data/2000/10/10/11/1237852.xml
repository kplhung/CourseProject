        <p>The authorities questioned Zimbabwe's main opposition leader for two hours today at police headquarters but delayed a decision about whether to arrest him, sidestepping a showdown that many feared would touch off violent protests.</p>
        <p>The police insisted that they still had enough evidence to arrest the opposition leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, for making a speech in which he told President Robert Mugabe, ''If you don't want to go peacefully, we will remove you violently.''</p>
        <p>But the authorities were clearly backing away from the kind of confrontation that erupted outside the courthouse on Monday after the arrests of three opposition members of Parliament. There, hundreds of chanting opposition supporters were sprayed with tear gas and three police officers were assaulted.</p>
        <p>Today, the authorities released the three legislators after declining to prosecute them on charges of inciting violence. The police said they would continue to investigate, but officials refrained from assailing the party members as criminals, as they have in recent days.</p>
        <p>Political analysts say the shift in tactics reflects differences of opinion within the governing party about how to handle the increasingly outspoken opposition party, which sharply limited Mr. Mugabe's dominance of Parliament in the June elections despite widespread intimidation and political violence.</p>
        <p>One startling tactic, which became public today, was a new amnesty in which Mr. Mugabe pardoned all but the most serious perpetrators of violence during the political campaign, whose victims were mostly supporters of the opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change.</p>
        <p>The amnesty plan, which would apply to criminals in all parties, would not cover those suspected of murder, rape, theft, weapons possession or fraud. People accused of those charges will be prosecuted in court. At least 30 people were killed in the pre-election violence.</p>
        <p>Government officials seem to remain divided among those who want to continue to crack down on the opposition and those who fear that arrests will only enhance the group's popularity.</p>
        <p>The opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change, described the sudden change of heart as a victory. On Monday, government officials sent teams of police officers to meet Mr. Tsvangirai as he landed at the airport from a trip to South Africa.</p>
        <p>The police officers did not even discuss treason, a charge that was bandied about by many government officials. Instead, the officers said they believed that he was guilty of engaging in speech likely to cause hostility to a sitting president, a charge the opposition denied.</p>
        <p>''The M.D.C. has been vindicated,'' Mr. Tsvangirai said this afternoon. ''You cannot go about concocting charges, trumping up charges against people who are innocent. The government is panicking, groping in the dark.'' But he assailed the amnesty plan, saying it would undermine any hope for justice for the hundreds of victims of attempted murder, assault and arson and much of the election violence.</p>
        <p>Some opposition members would also benefit from the amnesty, although election observers have attributed most of the pre-election violence to government supporters.</p>
        <p>In a statement, the Legal Resources Foundation, an advocacy group, said Mr. Mugabe was sending a ''clear message that such crimes committed in support of the ruling party will go unpunished.''</p>
