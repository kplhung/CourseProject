        <p>The suspensions of the coach and three midfielders, and injuries to two key players have left the United States men's soccer team with a depleted roster for its important World Cup qualifying game against Costa Rica here Wednesday night.</p>
        <p>Coach Bruce Arena, suspended for three games, can enter the stadium, but is not allowed to go near the players. FIFA, the sport's world governing body, suspended Arena for his actions after the Americans' 2-1 loss in Costa Rica on July 13. Dave Sarachan, his assistant, will be on the bench as the acting head coach.</p>
        <p>''With the development of information technology, we'll find a way to communicate,'' Sarachan said about Arena, who will be in the stands. ''Bruce will be relaying his decisions to the bench.''</p>
        <p>The United States Soccer Federation said it would meet with FIFA officials before the match to clarify matters.</p>
        <p>''Our official statement is, once we get to the stadium Bruce will not be allowed to be in contact with the team on the sideline or in the locker room,'' said Jim Moorhouse, director of communications for the federation. ''Our understanding is there can be no electronic contact or hand signals.''</p>
        <p>Arena and Sarachan will have limited options against Costa Rica, which leads the qualifying group with 9 points. The United States and Guatemala are tied for second with 7 points. A victory would enable the Americans to clinch a spot in the next round, which will involve six teams in the regional finals for the three spots to represent the region in the 2002 World Cup tournament in Japan and South Korea. Mexico, Trinidad and Tobago, Honduras and Jamaica have already qualified for the regional finals.</p>
        <p>The Americans will also be without Claudio Reyna, the team captain, who drew a two-game suspension for his actions in the Costa Rica game. Two other midfielders, Earnie Stewart and Eddie Lewis, will miss the match. Lewis was shown a red card against Guatemala and Stewart has accumulated too many yellow cards. Striker Brian McBride and midfielder Tab Ramos are out with injuries.</p>
        <p>The biggest adjustment the Americans will have to make is organizing the midfield and finding a playmaker to replace Reyna and Ramos. Ramos suffered a groin injury in practice with the MetroStars 13 days ago and played only 16 minutes in the MetroStars' loss against the Chicago last Friday night in the Major League Soccer semifinals.</p>
        <p>One option for Arena and Sarachan is to make John O'Brien or Chad Deering the midfield playmaker.</p>
        <p>Ante Ravov will take McBride's place on attack alongside Joe-Max Moore and Kasey Keller will be the goalkeeper. His backup will most likely be Tony Meola, who has been called on emergency from Kansas City because Brad Friedel, who played every minute in the Olympics, injured his hand in Monday's practice.</p>
