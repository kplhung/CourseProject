        <p>Moments before the taping tonight of a special ABC News ''Nightline'' town meeting in the Holy Land, the audience was in an uproar befitting the Israeli-Palestinian crisis: the moderator, Ted Koppel, and his producers were forced to broker a kind of arms agreement before the show could go on, and it took hours.</p>
        <p>The site of the taping, the Y.M.C.A. in East Jerusalem, has a longstanding policy forbidding weapons to pass through its doors. But two of the three Israeli officials on the panel travel with armed secret service agents. The Y's Palestinian bishop, the evening's host, refused to let them in. Negotiations began while the audience, informed of the reason for the delay, exploded in arguments that reflected the degenerated state of the Israeli-Palestinian relationship.</p>
        <p>Eventually, Mr. Koppel announced that the entire house, himself and the bishop included, would be made to leave the building and re-enter through a second security check because the Israelis feared that there might be guns inside.</p>
        <p>In a fury, Palestinian audience members protested that they were being treated like terrorists, and Israelis denounced them for not respecting Israeli security concerns.</p>
        <p>''We had a prime minister assassinated!'' one Israeli man exclaimed.</p>
        <p>''Poor you!'' a Palestinian yelled back.</p>
        <p>Mr. Koppel volunteered to cancel the evening.</p>
        <p>Eventually, some left for good, some exited and re-entered, and the Israeli agents were made to swear to the bishop that they weren't armed, although they probably were.</p>
        <p>Jerry Springer himself could not have dreamed of a better audience warm-up, but the fights ahead -- all verbal -- were deep-seated and not contrived.</p>
        <p>Twelve years ago, Mr. Koppel made his first foray into the minefield of Israeli-Palestinian relations for a town meeting at the Jerusalem Theater, considered locally to have been a kind of watershed. It was during the Palestinian uprising known as the intifada, before the Oslo peace pact, before Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization had recognized each other.</p>
        <p>The Palestinians. that time, insisted that a symbolic wall be built in the middle of the stage.</p>
        <p>Now, the peace effort is seven years old, and the two sides know each other well. The wall is history. But the images that began the show, which was being broadcast this evening in the United States, were not: Palestinian youths throwing stones, Israeli soldiers shooting back, flaming tires, dead bodies, utter chaos, just like the images in 1988.</p>
        <p>''I would ask you please to show courtesy to each other,'' Mr. Koppel said. But the situation on the ground defies manners, and it was not long before the officials on each side were all yelling at the same time, and Mr. Koppel was sitting back and letting it wash over him.</p>
        <p>''I surrender,'' he said, at one point.</p>
        <p>On the Israeli side were Naomi Chazan, a leftist lawmaker; Ephraim Sneh, the deputy defense minister; and Ehud Olmert, the rightist Jerusalem mayor and a veteran of the 1988 town meeting.</p>
        <p>On the Palestinian side were Hanan Ashrawi, whose impassioned arguments on the first show helped persuade the P.L.O. to make her its spokeswoman; Saeb Erekat, a senior negotiator; and Azmi Bishara, an Israeli Arab and a member of Parliament.</p>
        <p>''Why is Azmi sitting over there?'' Ms. Chazan asked before the show. ''Are we divided ethnically?''</p>
        <p>Bristling with antagonism toward the Palestinians, Mr. Olmert got into it with them quickly, until Ms. Ashrawi pleaded, ''Ted, can you please get him to be quiet?''</p>
        <p>''I am the mayor of Jerusalem,'' Mr. Olmert asserted.</p>
        <p>''You are not the mayor here,'' Ms. Ashrawi retorted, while the Palestinians in the audience hooted. ''You are our guest in East Jerusalem.''</p>
        <p>An Israeli teenager, a member of a youth peace group that is mourning this week the death of an Israeli Arab member, asked Mr. Sneh to justify the police shooting of her friend. ''I am wondering how can a 17-year-old child be a threat to the state of Israel?'' she asked in a heartfelt speech.</p>
        <p>The Palestinians all wore black ribbons.</p>
        <p>''You cannot shoot our children and get away with it,'' Ms. Ashrawi said.</p>
        <p>''You are to blame,'' Mr. Sneh retorted, accusing the Palestinians of sending their children out into the streets to be killed as well as exploiting the deaths in a move for international empathy.</p>
        <p>The impassioned exchanges continued through commercial breaks. Ms. Chazan, who delivered a choked-up appeal for peace at the Y and peace in the land, said: ''I think what is happening here is a microcosm of what's going on in the area. Trust has broken down terribly and horrifically.''</p>
        <p>Diplomatic solutions, Mr. Koppel asserted, cannot be negotiated on television.But he was the only American to have succeeded this week in engineering any kind of talks between the two sides.</p>
