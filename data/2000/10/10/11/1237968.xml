        <p>Mideast Violence Subsides As Diplomats Confer  Israelis and Palestinians haltingly backed away from confrontation as armed clashes subsided for the first time in 12 days, and a parade of diplomatic visitors urged both sides to rein in violence. There was one life-threatening casualty, a 12-year-old Palestinian boy in Gaza who was critically wounded.</p>

        <p>Eight years of dealing with Yasir Arafat has left White House officials feeling exasperated, bewildered, even betrayed, as the Palestinian leader ignores their entreaties for the restoration of calm in the Mideast, officials said.</p>

        <p>Zimbabwe Detains an Opponent  The authorities questioned Zimbabwe's main opposition leader for two hours at police headquarters but delayed a decision about whether to arrest him.
