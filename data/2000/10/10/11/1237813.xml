        <p>HAVE you ever met an ophthalmologist at a bar and asked if you were a candidate for laser surgery? If not, then you've never been out drinking with Dr. Sandra C. Belmont.</p>
        <p>''As soon as I tell anyone what I do, that's all they want to talk about,'' said Dr. Belmont, who is the director of the Weill-Cornell Laser Vision Correction Center in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Have you ever cornered a real estate broker at a cocktail party and started describing your home? ''They all want to know how much their apartments are worth,'' said Marilyn Harra Kaye, president of Prudential MLB Kaye International Realty in Manhattan. At a recent conference about Buddism in California, she says, amid the meditating and the tai chi, a stranger came over to Ms. Kaye to chat about her place on East 90th Street.</p>
        <p>In this 24/7, market-manic world, there is a lot of talk about workaholics who won't let go of their work. But what about people who would like to, but can't because the rest of us won't let them?</p>
        <p>''I have no fun at parties,'' said Bonnie Russell, an Internet strategist in Southern California, ''because complete strangers think nothing of asking me how I do what I do. I realize that the Internet is sexy. But if I'm standing around in a sexy outfit, I certainly don't want to be appreciated for my brains.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Marty Becker has resigned himself to the fact that he can't work on an airplane. He is a veterinarian (and a regular guest on ''Good Morning America'') and on a flight from New York to Boston last week his seatmate spent the hour telling stories about Holly, his collie. ''I've been in the dentist chair having a root canal and the dentist started asking about how to litter-box train his cat,'' Dr. Becker said. And this is not, he insists, because he's on television, it's because he's a vet.</p>
        <p>''A friend of mine was at death's door,'' he said, ''with tubes going everywhere, fearing he might not make it. A cute red-headed nurse comes in and says, 'You probably don't remember me, but I brought my cat to you. Now I'm having a problem with hairballs.' ''</p>
        <p>Marc Malkin has come to understand that he can't expect a work-free dinner. ''Everyone wants to know the dirt,'' said Mr. Malkin, who writes a gossip column for Us Weekly magazine. And they have a lot of other questions, too, most of which he can't answer. Questions like ''When is 'Mission: Impossible 2' coming out on video?'' Or ''When is Bette Midler's show premiering.''</p>
        <p>Amy Potozkin tried to avoid the talk-about-work trap on first dates by signing up with a dating service. As a casting director with the Berkeley Repertory Theater, actors have approached her at funerals looking for work, so she told the agency that she did not want to meet any actors.</p>
        <p>Her first match was a businessman. What he didn't mention on his application was that he acts in local community theater. ''We spent the rest of the date talking about whether or not he should quit his job and take his acting career to the next level,'' Ms. Potozkin said.</p>
        <p>The after-work requests for stock tips became so intrusive for Cody Acree, a securities analyst for Frost Securities in Dallas, that he now lies. ''My wife and I went to a B &amp; B to get away from the stress but when I sat down at breakfast I was inundated with questions from the other guests,'' he explains. ''So now I tell people I'm a janitor, and they don't seem to want to talk.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Acree is not the only one who lies. Dr. Becker has told strangers he is an ''award-winning insurance salesman.'' Ms. Potozkin has said she is a waitress. Ms. Russell plans to introduce herself at parties as a librarian, unless the man doing the asking is particularly attractive, in which case she will say she is a masseuse.</p>
        <p>Yet even as they lie, they understand. Many of them turn these conversations into business contacts, and even those who don't say they know that the pull of what they do is irresistible, and that there are some questions that have to be asked.</p>
        <p>That said, I won't bore you with the advice Dr. Becker gave me about housebreaking our new puppy, nor the reasons Dr. Belmont thinks I should wait to get laser surgery. But I will share this: Gwyneth and Ben are ''apparently dating'' again. I got that gossip straight from Mr. Malkin's mouth.</p>
