        <p>The chairman and chief executive of Bridgestone/Firestone Inc., Masatoshi Ono, resigned from those jobs today, and was promptly succeeded by John Lampe, the executive vice president of the American subsidiary of the Japanese company. The House of Representatives, meanwhile, prepared to take up a bill that would require auto companies that replace motor vehicle parts in a foreign country for safety reasons to notify American regulators and would require tire manufacturers to give regulators data on warranty claims. Ford replaced Firestone tires for owners of its Explorer sport utility vehicles in Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, but did not tell American regulators.</p>
        <p>The bill would also raise penalties for failing to report defects. But the fate of a Senate bill on the same subject is uncertain.</p>
        <p>Bridgestone/Firestone, a unit of Bridgestone Corporation of Japan, is in crisis, having recalled 6.5 million tires on Aug. 9 and having been linked by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to scores of deaths in the rollovers of Ford Explorers, caused by tire failures. But Mr. Ono said in a deposition taken in Nashville Monday in a court case that the reason for his resignation was poor health.</p>
        <p>''I don't feel too good in my stomach and my blood sugar is also high,'' he said. He added that he had been on the job for seven years, and that ''as a periodical rotation of positions, I thought it's about time for me to retire.'' Vice presidents of Bridgestone, the Japanese parent, commonly retire at 63 or 64, he said; Mr. Ono is 63.</p>
        <p>The head of the Japanese parent company, Yoichioro Kaizaki, said in a statement that Mr. Ono ''leaves with the fond respect of everyone.''</p>
        <p>But others were skeptical. The main sponsor of the House bill, Representative Fred Upton, Republican of Michigan, said, ''I'm surprised it took that long.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lampe, a 27-year veteran of Firestone, was already the company's public face, because of Mr. Ono's limited ability to communicate in English. Mr. Ono used a translator when appearing before Congressional committees, and even then asked that questions be referred to Mr. Lampe.</p>
        <p>An executive from Japan, Isao Togashi, now senior vice president for tire production and production technology, will join Mr. Lampe as vice chairman of the board of the American subsidiary, Mr. Lampe said.</p>
        <p>At a news conference where the announcement was made, Mr. Lampe said that the recall of tires would be completed by the end of November, with 3.7 million already replaced, and would not stretch into next year, as had originally been expected. He added that the company had already taken a charge to earnings of $350 million this year but would add $100 million to that.</p>
        <p>He added that his company still could not tell from looking at the failed tires what the cause of the failure was.</p>
        <p>''I'm not saying that there isn't a problem with those tires,'' he said. But he added, ''if you look at your shoe and you've got a hole in it, you say, there's a defect.'' In the case of the tires, he said, there was no hole or other obvious problem that was causing them to shed their treads.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Lampe, continuing a combative tone now that he is in charge, said, ''I'm tired of hearing that the whole blame rests upon the tire.'' He said that of the reported tire failures on Explorers, approximately half involved the left rear tire, for reasons he said were unexplained.</p>
