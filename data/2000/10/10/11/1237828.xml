        <p>The megaband stadium rock concert has returned to Beijing after an absence of more than a decade, with several veteran acts making up for lost time by performing for the hometown crowd they never knew.</p>
        <p>''Beijing is the place where Chinese rock was born: today is our holiday!'' shouted Dai Qin, the lead vocalist for Thin Man, which is more widely heard in Tokyo than in Beijing but is nonetheless the hottest rock group in China this year. Then his band began its set, diving into a storm of rapping and stomping backed up by pumping bass lines, fulsome guitar grunge and drumming by Wang Lan, who is viewed as the best drummer in China.</p>
        <p>In a political environment where rock seldom gets by the radio censors and would be hard pressed to challenge the popularity of canto-pop for air time anyway, Thin Man was one of 10 bands introducing Beijing's masses to the music for the first time. Others included alternative teenage superstars like Flower (China's equivalent of Hanson) and funk iconoclasts Yao Shi, formerly known as Confucius Says. The explosion was balanced by so-called first-generation legends with an 80's-style testosterone-packed presence like Tang Dynasty and Black Panther.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dai of Thin Man said he hoped that the exposure would open a new musical era in Beijing. ''To us, playing here was very important, especially for people to see that our positioning has changed,'' he said. ''Now they know we're top-flight.''</p>
        <p>Thin Man, which has drummed up attention with a nationwide album release and a live appearance on state-sponsored television, has been influenced by American bands like Rage Against the Machine, Jane's Addiction and Led Zeppelin and is still better known in Tokyo than in Beijing. This summer it became China's first band to be invited to the Fuji Music Festival in Tokyo, and  this fall it is to return to Japan for a full tour. ''But in Beijing, we're more feared than X-rated movies,'' said Mr. Dai.</p>
        <p>Before the show he was taken in for a three-hour chat with the authorities about the content of Thin Man's performance, though it apparently had little effect on what the band played. As the band let loose its  theme song, ''Thin Man,'' pockets of fans flashed red banners with white Chinese characters proclaiming things lik, ''Love My Thin Man,'' although the crowd remained mostly sedate.</p>
        <p>The authorities had taken precautions. Impromptu speeches by performers were not permitted. Clusters of police officers in green uniforms stood in every aisle and at each exit. Drinking and smoking were forbidden, and the concert ended promptly at the appointed time,  10:30 p.m.</p>
        <p>The rock bash, held in a dilapidated stadium in a sports village built on the north side of the city for the 1992 Asian Games, was attended by 22,000 people, 15,000 of whom paid. It was financed by a local music Web  site and produced by a concert company that is informally under the wing of the city's cultural bureau.</p>
        <p>The authorities in Beijing clamped down on stadium permits for rock music in the early 90's after the country's rock patriarch Cui Jian played in Tiananmen Square in support of student demonstrations in 1989. To officials, rock came to symbolize rebellion, so in the 90's Beijing rock's most explosive sounds were confined to cramped bars and discos unless they hit the road.</p>
        <p>''For a band suited to a large open-air setting, it was really difficult,'' said Ding Wu, lead singer of Tang Dynasty, who waited 11 years for the return to an outdoor venue in Beijing.</p>
        <p>The rock scene has bustled the last few months. In July a week of underground rock shows were staged outdoors at a busy shopping square minutes from Tiananmen. VH-1's regional music channel is sponsoring an independent film series this fall at a popular club. A huge concert this month is to feature 40 pop and rock acts joining to protest sales of counterfeit CD's in China.</p>
        <p>There is speculation that political winds have shifted in favor of rock music. Still, those hoping for a more accepting environment are leery of the sweeping political struggles championed by artists like Cui Jian. ''Our music is fed on a different diet than the older generation's,'' Mr. Dai  said. ''There are a lot of everyday problems here.''</p>
        <p>ARTS ABROAD  Correction:  October 30, 2000, Monday  Because of an editing error, an Arts Abroad article on Oct. 11 about the return of the stadium rock concert to Beijing misstated the type of series that is being sponsored at a popular club there by VH-1's regional music channel. It is an independent music concert series, not a film series.</p>
