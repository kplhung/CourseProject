        <p>I'M here with the DNA,'' Michael Cessna McVey said, introducing himself at the National Business Aviation Association's annual convention and trade show, which opened here yesterday.</p>
        <p>Oh swell, I'm thinking. Here's another guy touting me another new business airplane with code letters that I'm supposed to recognize, like BBJ, Boeing's hot airliner-sized business jet, or GV-SP, the new-generation General Dynamics' Gulfstream that will fly nine passengers from New York to Tokyo nonstop at Mach 0.83, or Cessna's seven-passenger Citation X, newly enhanced with boosted-thrust Rolls-Royce AE3007C-1 engines to fly at nearly the speed of sound, or Mach 0.92.</p>

        <p>I'M here with the DNA,'' Michael Cessna McVey said, introducing himself at the National Business Aviation Association's annual convention and trade show, which opened here yesterday.</p>
        <p>Oh swell, I'm thinking. Here's another guy touting me another new business airplane with code letters that I'm supposed to recognize, like BBJ, Boeing's hot airliner-sized business jet, or GV-SP, the new-generation General Dynamics' Gulfstream that will fly nine passengers from New York to Tokyo nonstop at Mach 0.83, or Cessna's seven-passenger Citation X, newly enhanced with boosted-thrust Rolls-Royce AE3007C-1 engines to fly at nearly the speed of sound, or Mach 0.92.</p>
        <p>Turns out, though, that Mr. McVey wasn't alluding to an airplane model. He was referring instead to the genetic fact that he is a great grandson of Clyde Cessna, an early airplane manufacturer and one of the founders of the private aviation industry that ultimately spawned today's rapidly growing business-aircraft market.</p>
        <p>Unlike most of the 30,000 people who attended the annual convention, Mr. McVey doesn't sell, buy, design, fly, supply, manage, charter, maintain, or even fly in business aircraft. Rather, he came to the convention, he said, to pick up information for a Web site he is designing to promote the pioneering aviation spirit of his great-grandfather, whom he described as ''a dirt farmer from Kansas who was an excellent mechanic and who one day got the hankering to fly instead of riding around on his tractor.''</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, it was obvious that we were a long way from Kansas as this aviation extravaganza unfolded with more than 900 exhibitors on the vast acreage of the Ernest N. Morial Convention Center downtown, and several hundred more at New Orleans Lakefront Airport, where visitors crawled through dozens of the most popular models of today's business aircraft.</p>
        <p>The business aviation industry has fully recovered from a slump after the 1980's that was partly caused by public and shareholder outrage about abuses of corporate aircraft by highflying wheeler-dealers who didn't hesitate to dispatch the Gulfstream, for example, to deliver a pet poodle to a summer house in Nantucket.</p>
        <p>With more companies clamoring to own, lease or buy fractional shares of corporate aircraft, and with manufacturers and suppliers scrambling to dish up new luxury products like corporate jets with the size and luxury appointments of executive suites, the only question is how long the good times will roll.</p>
        <p>Although some analysts warn that the industry is unlikely to see much more of the kind of growth it enjoyed in recent years, and is subject to a big fall if the economy sours, the numbers appear to be holding up. According to an annual Honeywell Aerospace forecast quoted in Aviation Week, manufacturers will deliver 6,800 new business jets valued at $90 billion in the next 10 years. And already this year, said Ed Bolen, the president of the General Aviation Manufacturers Association, overall business-aviation billings and shipments are running 18 percent higher than all of last year.</p>
        <p>''Ten years ago, hardly anyone got to fly on the corporate plane except the senior executives,'' said Marilyn Richwine, the vice president for corporate communications at Cessna Aircraft, which is now a Kansas-based subsidiary of Textron. ''Today, companies are using their aircraft to transport middle management teams, and even mechanics and hourly employees. Companies have become so diverse and are located in so many different places, that they're using their airplanes almost like a company airline, sometimes even with regular shuttle schedules.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Richwine echoed a familiar theme in today's business aviation industry.</p>
        <p>The theme is that a business aircraft is a tool, not a perk. Jack Olcott, the president of the National Business Aviation Association, said that the industry had assiduously sought to ''change stubborn public perceptions'' of luxury corporate jets and their fat-car passengers by promoting the company plane as a cost-efficient, if sometimes expensive, way to increase productivity.</p>
        <p>This summer's record commercial airline delays, which still have some business travelers seething about days wasted in airports, have bolstered his case. He pointed out that business aircraft have access to 5,400 airports in the United States, and not just the 580 airports that are served by commercial airlines. At the same time, the business-aviation industry is lobbying hard to try to thwart growing community-based opposition to increased business-aircraft activity, and attendant noise, at smaller and regional airports, most prominently in Van Nuys and Burbank, Calif., and in White Plains.</p>
        <p>But for now, business aviation remains on a roll. The number of United States companies with their own flight departments grew to 8,778 last year from 6,584 in 1990. Worldwide, the number of business jets in use has more than doubled since 1980 to more than 10,000.</p>
        <p>Mr. Olcott pointed out that turnout for this year's convention was a record at more than 30,000. That's up from 16,000 10 years earlier, when the convention was also in New Orleans.</p>
        <p>But perceptions are tenuous. There is still a small frisson of nervousness when exhibitors are asked questions having to do with cost and luxury on the vast convention floor. Among the exhibitors are purveyors of New Zealand sheepskin aircraft recliner seats and custom hardwood cabinets. They share space with sellers of the latest big-ticket items in the ''heavy metal'' segment of the industry, the truly big corporate jets, which now come outfitted with lushly appointed executive suites and even private bedrooms.</p>
        <p>''It's what these people are accustomed to in their offices, in the hotels they stay in on the road, even in their automobiles,'' said J. Mac McClellan, the editor in chief of Flying, an aviation trade publication. ''We don't criticize that level of comfort in those circumstances, so why should we in a plane, when they're conducting business?''</p>
        <p>Still, a pilot who asked that his name not be used, said that while ostentatious nonbusiness use of the company jet might have become muted, it had not disappeared.</p>
        <p>''Just recently, I was talking to a flight crew for a corporate jet in Dartmouth, N.H.,'' he said. ''They'd just made a trip to drop off an executive's daughter at college. She was the only passenger.''</p>
