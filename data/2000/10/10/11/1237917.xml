        <p>In Boston, the state police pull over a batboy who had borrowed the car of a Red Sox infielder and discover a vial containing anabolic steroids in the glove compartment. In San Diego, the Padres randomly test minor leaguers for steroids at spring training and find that about one in five test positive. In Miami, a veteran outfielder says he believes as many as 40 percent of major leaguers have used the muscle-building drugs.</p>
        <p>No one knows for certain how many professional ballplayers are using testosterone-based drugs, but there is a growing suspicion among many people in baseball that the national pastime has become tainted with steroid abuse.</p>
        <p>Unlike the National Football League, college athletics and sports overseen by the International Olympic Committee, Major League Baseball does not randomly test players for steroids or other drugs that may improve performance.</p>
        <p>But suspicions abound, especially in recent years, as more and more players have put on muscle during off-season training and hitters have begun slugging home runs at a record pace.</p>
        <p>These days, some major league players said, it is not uncommon to hear players speculating in dugouts that an ordinary hitter who has metamorphosed over a few months into a muscled slugger is ''juiced.'' With millions of dollars in future salary riding on offensive numbers, the temptation to find a chemical edge is great, current and former players said.</p>
        <p>''Some guys don't want to wait to build up the natural way,'' said Andre Dawson, the retired All-Star outfielder who is a special assistant with the Florida Marlins. ''When you see how quickly some of them develop from one year to the next, you know they're using something.''</p>
        <p>Interviews with more than 25 major league strength coaches, general managers, league officials and players indicated a general view that steroid abuse has become a problem in baseball, perhaps even widespread, and that the sport must address it.</p>
        <p>Other people in baseball contend, though, that steroid abuse is limited and that players are bigger and stronger than they used to be because of better training and diet.</p>
        <p>Anabolic steroids stimulate muscle growth and help athletes recover from injuries more quickly, but research has also linked steroid abuse with heart disease, stroke and liver disease.</p>
        <p>It is against federal law to use steroids without a prescription, and in theory, baseball's policy mirrors the law. But in practice baseball's policy is rarely enforced. Testing is not allowed under the current collective bargaining agreement, so most of the evidence of illicit use has been anecdotal: tales of players putting on 30 pounds of muscle in a year, doubling the number of home runs they hit one year to the next and showing the symptoms of steroid use, such as violent mood swings and acne on the back.</p>
        <p>One tantalizing hint about the scope of the steroid abuse has come from the San Diego Padres. For the last three years, the team has randomly tested 25 of its minor league players -- they are not represented by a union -- during spring training.</p>
        <p>Each year about one out of five has tested positive, team officials said.</p>
        <p>Brad Andress, the strength coach for the Colorado Rockies, in an interview estimated that about 30 percent of professional baseball players have used steroids at some point in their career. A general manager on the West Coast, who, like many people, agreed to be interviewed about steroids on the condition of anonymity, said he believed at least a third of major leaguers are steroid users.</p>
        <p>''I think it's very prevalent,'' the general manager said. ''You look at some of these massive bodies you see these days. It's like middle linebackers are playing baseball.''</p>
        <p>Other coaches and players say that without testing these estimates are entirely speculative. Even these people acknowledge, however, that the weight gains some players have made in a short time would be improbable without the help of steroids.</p>
        <p>''It's out there,'' a strength coach in the American League said. ''That's what I can tell you.''</p>
        <p>The concern about steroids has grown large enough that baseball officials are pressing the Major League Players' Association to accept a testing program in the next round of bargaining.</p>
        <p>''There have been a number of observations made by people who are somewhat knowledgeable in this area and they believe strongly that there is usage,'' Sandy Alderson, vice president for baseball operations, said. ''I think at this point it is safe to say Major League Baseball and the players association are reviewing this situation.''</p>
        <p>But officials of the players' union say there are many details to work out before the players would accept testing. For instance, union leaders first want a scientific study to determine if steroids actually improve performances in baseball.</p>
        <p>''The question of whether or not steroid use is performance enhancing has to be treated on a sport by sport basis,'' Gene Orza, the union's associate general counsel, said.</p>
        <p>Chiseling Away at the Truth</p>
        <p>Among many of the players, the perception is that steroid use is rampant. Cliff Floyd, an outfielder with the Marlins, for instance, says he does not use steroids himself, but estimates that about 4 of 10 major leaguers have used the drugs.</p>
        <p>''That's off the top of my head, but I come up with that number from talking to a lot of players,'' he said. ''Players nowadays feel if it looks like it can help you, they'll try it. That's how the game is and that's probably how it's going to be for a long time.''</p>
        <p>A veteran infielder in the National League, who requested anonymity, said he knew at least four players who have used steroids, three of whom are still playing. He said many players resort to the drugs to help them recover from injuries.</p>
        <p>''They were trying to get through the season or get back in the lineup quicker,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The infielder said he often heard players muttering that an opponent is ''juiced'' after a home run. ''I've heard it a bunch of times,'' he said. ''It's the first thing that comes to mind when someone hits one really deep. Oh, he's on steroids.''</p>
        <p>Darrin Jackson, an outfielder who retired from the Chicago White Sox last year, said he sometimes found it difficult to resist the suspicion that other players were using muscle-building drugs.</p>
        <p>''I've even heard myself say that,'' Jackson said. ''I go home and all winter long I work out five days a week with a personal trainer and I come back maybe 10 pounds heavier. You say, 'How did this guy put on 30 pounds over the winter?' ''</p>
        <p>Anabolic steroids are derivatives or precursors of testosterone, the body's main muscle builder. They allow an athlete to gain more muscle mass in less time by helping the body recover faster from workouts.</p>
        <p>Strength coaches say an average man  between the ages of 18 and 24 working hard in the weight room can gain about 10 pounds of lean muscle in a year. The older an athlete becomes, however, the less muscle he can put on, especially if he is already near peak condition. An older athlete who has been lifting weights for several years can expect at most to gain 2 or 3 pounds of muscle in a year.</p>
        <p>Steroids stretch those natural limits, but not without consequences. Though medical researchers have yet to study the long-term effects of steroid abuse, several short-term studies have shown that taking high doses can wreak havoc on the body's cholesterol levels. That makes steroid users five times more likely to have a heart attack or a stroke, the researchers said.</p>
        <p>Oral steroids have also been linked to liver disease. Trainers said that some steroid users also have a higher risk of torn tendons and muscle strains, because the skeleton is supporting more muscle than nature had intended.</p>
        <p>Another veteran All-Star outfielder said he believes two-thirds of the top players in the National League are using some kind of steroid. He said the main advantage of steroids is not that they increase strength, but that they help the body recover from injuries quickly, keeping players healthy late in the season. He said he had often seen the tell-tale signs of steroid abuse in locker rooms -- acne on the back, for instance -- even at All-Star Games.</p>
        <p>''You see these guys taking off their clothes, and it's hard not to see certain things,'' said the outfielder, who insisted on anonymity. ''Sores on their backs, or their thighs and calves, and you wonder how they got there.''</p>
        <p>He blames the steroid use on the growing pressure to hit more home runs and extra-base hits in today's game. Minor leaguers trying to make their way into the big leagues and major leaguers who are not natural power hitters feel tempted to try the drugs, he said.</p>
        <p>''Twenty-five home runs and 85 R.B.I.'s used to be a great year,'' he said. ''Nowadays that barely gets you in the starting lineup. There's pressure on kids coming up today that didn't used to be there. There's pressure on guys in the big leagues right now. You see a guy who hits only 15 home runs and has 75 R.B.I.'s and he's not getting the respect he should.''</p>
        <p>Andress, the Rockies' strength coach, said he had grown tired of receiving calls from minor league players each year about the drugs. More and more minor leaguers have been telling him that they are seeing other players take steroids, bulk up and get promoted to the major leagues, he said.</p>
        <p>''They are forced just because of the competitive nature of sport to think about that course themselves,'' Andress said. ''I just don't think its fair.''</p>
        <p>Not everyone in baseball agrees that steroids are a major problem. Some coaches and players argue that the perception of widespread abuse may stem from the general increase in weight training in baseball.</p>
        <p>Players are bigger, stronger and better conditioned than in the past, these coaches and players argue. In the last five years, year-round weight lifting has become standard for most ballplayers. Every team now has weight rooms and strength coaches. The athletes take all sorts of legal dietary supplements, from amino acids to proteins, to help gain strength. Even these coaches and players, however, acknowledge that a few players are using steroids.</p>
        <p>''I don't want to say it was widespread, but I think the number of guys that try or use steroids has decreased over the years,'' Fred Hina, the Mets' strength coach, said. ''There are so many things out there today that are much safer over the long haul than steroids, and I think they've found that out.''</p>
        <p>Many athletes, for instance, are taking creatine, an amino acid found in muscle that provides fuel during short bursts of work. In theory, flooding the body with extra creatine enables athletes to lift more before tiring, leading to bigger gains of muscle mass. But creatine is not a hormone, and researchers say it does not stimulate growth or prevent muscles from breaking down under extreme training as anabolic steroids do.</p>
        <p>Some baseball players are also still using androstenedione, a hormone the liver converts to testosterone. Mark McGwire stirred controversy in 1998 when he acknowledged using ''andro'' as he set the home run record. Although many scientists consider androstenedione an anabolic steroid and many sports have banned it, the government currently classifies it as a natural supplement. McGwire said he stopped using andro last year.</p>
        <p>Before Testing, Proof</p>
        <p>Under pressure from the White House, the Drug Enforcement Administration has begun a nine-month study to determine if androstenedione builds muscle and thus should be considered a controlled substance.</p>
        <p>Baseball officials maintain that the whispering in the dugouts about steroid use has become persistent enough to warrant random testing. While the explosion in offense has delighted fans and owners, rumors about drug abuse could damage the game's image in the long run, they said.</p>
        <p>''We are clearly interested in getting some sort of steroid testing program in place,'' Robert Manfred, baseball's top labor relations official, said. ''We would rather have it for steroids and performance-enhancing drugs. At the end of the day, the guy who's smoking marijuana at home has less impact on the integrity of the game.''</p>
        <p>But leaders in the players association contend that it is unclear whether steroids do enhance performance in baseball. The union has proposed a scientific study to settle the question. ''The players reserve the right to distinguish between the random testing of baseball players for drugs that are not performance enhancing and those that are performance enhancing,'' Orza said. ''The question of whether they are performance enhancing is debatable.''</p>
        <p>Union leaders have also said that because some nutritional supplements sold over the counter are laced illegally with steroids, some athletes might unwittingly take a banned drug while consuming a harmless looking supplement.</p>
        <p>The current collective bargaining agreement says nothing about drug testing, and federal labor law mandates that employers bargain the issue with unions. A series of arbitrators' decisions dating back to the mid-1980's have held that clubs are not permitted to test unionized players for drugs without the union's consent.</p>
        <p>Major League Baseball did test minor league players last year to see if steroid use was widespread, but baseball officials and the union declined to reveal the tests' results. A baseball official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the tests did reveal usage, but he declined to quantify the results, other than to say that the prevalence was less than 30 percent.</p>
        <p>A steroid testing program would not be without risks for team owners as well as players. If tests showed major stars were using drugs, it might deflate the sport's soaring popularity or cast doubt on recent hitting records. Some players see testing as a Pandora's box that could give clubs another tool to control their careers. ''Once you open that door, it makes other doors open up,'' said Eric Karros, a veteran first baseman with the Los Angeles Dodgers.</p>
        <p>Karros said he worried that clubs might begin framing players they want to get rid of on steroid-use charges. ''It just has tentacles that could go everywhere,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But other players think testing is the only way to ensure that the sport remains fair.</p>
        <p>''It's definitely needed,'' a 12-year veteran outfielder said. ''When you start involving kids and promoting guys hitting home runs who were 170 pounds when they first came up and now they're 230, 240 pounds, that's not what baseball should be doing. I'm for the union 100 percent, but we need to do this the right way and the legal way. I'd volunteer for it right now.''</p>
        <p>Latin American Connections</p>
        <p>Officials of the federal D.E.A. said that the vast majority of anabolic steroids on the black market in the United States are smuggled from countries where the drugs are available at pharmacies without a prescription.</p>
        <p>Mexico and other Latin American countries are major sources of the drugs. For instance, a reporter checked a dozen pharmacies in Santo Domingo and San Pedro de Macoris in the Dominican Republic, and found that 10 of them were willing to sell various versions of testosterone without a prescription.</p>
        <p>Strength coaches in the major leagues say players often obtain steroids while playing winter ball in Latin America.</p>
        <p>Young ballplayers at San Pedro de Macoris, a town that has produced many major league players, said it was common to find aspiring baseball players shooting up steroids. Some Dominican players said their colleagues who used steroids have often resorted to veterinary drugs, which are even easier to obtain.</p>
        <p>''Personally, I have never taken any of these drugs; my mother is a nurse and tells me it is dangerous,'' said Reynaldo Mansanillo, a 16-year-old player for with the Universidad Central del Este. ''But yes, I know young ballplayers who take them. Most often they take diamino, caballin or millan, drugs used for horses.''</p>
        <p>An undercover federal customs official in San Diego, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that bodybuilders are among those who regularly smuggle anabolic steroids, including veterinary drugs.</p>
        <p>There are 800 pharmacies in Tijuana, the agent said, many of which will give out steroids without a prescription or send a client to a friendly doctor who will write a prescription without asking questions.</p>
        <p>''It's kind of wide open for getting steroids in Mexico,'' the agent said.</p>
        <p>There is also a brisk business in mail-order drugs, customs officials said. Some steroid sellers in Mexico take orders over the telephone or on the Internet, then cross the border and mail the drugs by courier service, the agents said. In other cases, the drugs are mailed in parcels from foreign countries with a misleading customs label.</p>
        <p>D.E.A. officials acknowledge that stopping the flow of steroids is not their top priority when illicit drugs such as cocaine and heroin are flowing across the border.</p>
        <p>A small brown vial containing a steroid intended for animals, along with two hypodermic needles, was found last summer in the glove compartment of a Mercedes-Benz owned by the backup shortstop for the Red Sox, Manny Alexander.</p>
        <p>The drug was Dimetabol, a mix of vitamins and the steroid nandrolone, manufactured in Mexico by Lapisa S.A., a veterinary company. A spokesman for the company, Dr. Ernesto Mudespacher, said the drug was not registered in the United States and cannot legally be sold there. But the drug can easily be bought in Mexico at any veterinary pharmacy without a prescription, he said.</p>
        <p>Dimetabol is intended to be used for sheep, horses and cattle during periods of stress or after a birth to help them recover and gain weight, Mudespacher said.</p>
        <p>Solving the Maze</p>
        <p>Alexander, through his lawyer Mike Powers, declined to comment. The state police said they are seeking drug possession charges against Alexander, even though he was not in the car when the vial was found. He was traveling with the Red Sox.</p>
        <p>Alexander, 29, had lent the car to the team's batboy, Carlos Cowart, 20, who was wanted by the police on a previous warrant for driving without a license and failing to stop for the police. On June 30, at 3:30 p.m., a state trooper spotted Alexander's Mercedes illegally parked outside Cowart's apartment building in the Dorchester section of Boston.</p>
        <p>A friend of Cowart's, Charles Lagoa, 19, was behind the wheel, and Cowart was coming out of the building, the police said. The trooper checked the license plate number and learned the car was registered to Manny Alexander. Suspecting the car had been stolen, the trooper stopped the young men, arrested Cowart on the outstanding warrant and impounded the car. The envelope of steroids, addressed to Alexander, was discovered during a routine search before the car was towed, the police said.</p>
        <p>Powers said that Alexander can explain how the vial got there, but he declined to give details. A magistrate has been scheduled to hear arguments in the case for several months, but a hearing has twice been postponed. It is now scheduled to be held Oct. 31.</p>
        <p>Whatever the outcome in court, the case is yet another brick in the wall of anecdotal evidence of steroid use in baseball, many experts said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Charles E. Yesalis, an epidemiologist at Penn State University who is an authority on steroid abuse in sports, said the trend should come as no surprise to sports fans. Using steroids and playing cat and mouse with testers have been part of life for athletes in football and track and field for more than 12 years.</p>
        <p>''Clearly you see a pattern that is troubling,'' Yesalis said of baseball. ''Why would baseball players be more ethical and moral than other athletes?''</p>
