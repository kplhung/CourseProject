        <p>TRENTON: LANDMARK CUSTODY RULING STANDS -- A lesbian who won the right to visit her former partner's children praised a move by the United States Supreme Court that lets the New Jersey ruling stand, the woman's lawyer said yesterday. The woman will continue to see the 6-year-old twins every other weekend, a custody arrangement approved by the State Supreme Court in April. The biological mother appealed and hoped to have the nation's high court hear her case, but the justices refused yesterday.</p>

        <p>JERSEY CITY: CRASH SITE MAY BE REVAMPED -- The State Department of Transportation said it was reviewing whether a center divider or a lowering of the 45 mile-per-hour speed limit would improve safety at the Wittpenn Bridge, where five people were killed in two crashes on Monday. The state intends to replace the bridge and its Route 7 approach at a cost of $300 million in five years. The Jersey City police identified the victim of the first crash as Catarina Luz, 19, of Kearny, and the later crash victims as Rahul Patel, 18; Daval Patel, whose age was unavailable; Chirag M. Patel, 17; and Ankit S. Pandya, 18. A survivor of the second crash, Pallavi Zalawadia, 18, was in critical condition yesterday at University Hospital in Newark.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: PRIVATE-PRISON CIVIL RIGHTS -- A panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has reversed a lower court decision and ruled that a federal contractor, a private-prison company, may be sued for civil rights violations committed by its employees. The decision came in a lawsuit filed by a prisoner who claimed his rights were violated in 1994 while he was being held in a Manhattan halfway house run by a private company, Correctional Services Corporation. The ruling, dated Friday, is the latest of a series of  conflicting court decisions that raise questions about the liability of federal contractors in civil rights suits. A lawyer for Correctional Services said the company was considering an appeal to the Supreme Court. Benjamin Weiser (NYT)</p>
        <p>BRONX: WOMAN KILLED BY CAR -- A 61-year-old woman died after she was struck by a car while crossing the street at 11:30 a.m. yesterday, the police said. The woman, whose name was not immediately available,  was struck on Grand Concourse near the intersection with East Mount Eden Avenue, and then dragged about a  block to East 173rd Street, the police said. The car, a 1988 Honda Civic, stopped, and its two occupants fled on foot, the authorities said. The police were searching for two men, both dark-skinned Hispanic men in their 20's. One man was described as 5 feet 11 inches tall, 185 pounds and wearing a baseball cap. The other was wearing a sweater or multicolored vest, the authorities said, and was about 5 feet 7 inches and 165 pounds.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: ARGUMENT ENDS IN SLASHINGS -- Five young men were slashed in the face in an argument that began on a subway platform on the Upper West Side yesterday afternoon, the police said. Two groups of youths, both from Louis D. Brandeis High School, got into a fight at the West 103rd Street Station on the uptown train platform around 3:20 p.m., said Detective Edward Reuss, a police spokesman. The melee continued up onto the street. Four people, ranging in age from 15 to 20, were charged with assault, and two knives were recovered, Detective Reuss said. The victims were not seriously injured and were in stable condition at hospitals, the detective said.</p>

        <p>BROOKLYN: RESIDENTS PLAN PROTEST -- Residents of Boerum Hill, angry over traffic accidents and near-collisions at the intersection of Hoyt and Wyckoff Streets, plan to demonstrate at the intersection today, calling for the city to put a stop sign there. Citing at least four accidents this year, residents say they have long asked the Department of Transportation for such a sign. But city reviews in 1998 and 1999 did not justify the installation, they were told.</p>

        <p>BRONX: TEENAGER DEAD OF HEART AILMENT -- An intermediate school student died yesterday after complaining of chest pains in a stairwell at Intermediate School 162, the authorities said. The police said the boy, Alberto Velazquez, 14, was taken to the school nurse's office and then to Lincoln Hospital, where he was pronounced dead on arrival about noon. A spokeswoman for the Board of Education, Margie Feinberg, said the boy was severely handicapped and had a history of heart problems. The death is being investigated.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: TOP VALLONE AIDE RESIGNS -- Bruce Bender, the chief of staff to the City Council speaker, Peter F. Vallone, resigned yesterday to turn his attention to next year's city government elections. Mr. Bender served as the speaker's top aide since 1998. Several of Mr. Vallone's advisers said yesterday that Mr. Bender was leaving because his attention was divided between the Council speaker, who is preparing to run for mayor, and Councilman Herbert E. Berman of Brooklyn, who is preparing to run for comptroller. Mr. Bender worked for Mr. Berman before joining Mr. Vallone's staff. Mr. Bender called his departure voluntary and rejected suggestions that it was related to questions about his loyalty.</p>
