        <p>IN the world of collectible automobiles, no other marque possesses the mystique, and commands the high prices, of the Ferrari. In 1990, a 1963 Ferrari GTO, one of 39 built, sold for $17 million, the highest known price paid for an automobile.</p>
        <p>Just as a van Gogh has a value that far exceeds the sum of its canvas and paint, the amount that collectors are willing to pay for a Ferrari is much more than the cost of its aluminum, steel and leather.</p>
        <p>What sets Ferraris apart? Why is a Ferrari worth more than a Maserati or a vintage Rolls-Royce? And what determines which Ferrari is worth more than another?</p>
        <p>''Ferraris were always raced,'' said Sam Mann, a retired industrial designer and manufacturer who has four vintage Ferraris in his collection. ''Unlike, say, Lamborghinis, which really have no competition heritage, Ferrari has consistently accepted the challenge of proving its product on the track. They also have exceptional styling and were produced in very low numbers.''</p>
        <p>Ferraris have always been performance cars, fast and sexy. Unlike Porsche, for instance, which has occasionally diluted its prestige with entry-level models, perhaps most egregiously with its four-cylinder 914 from 1970-76, which used Volkswagen components. Or Maserati's offerings, which have included ponderous four-door sedans that weighed nearly two tons.</p>
        <p>''Ferraris have always been incredibly expensive,'' said Ron Tonkin of Portland, Ore., who owns 21 vintage Ferraris and holds the United States' oldest Ferrari franchise, established in 1966. ''They've always been a symbol of status, and when you purchased one, you were making a statement that you had really arrived.''</p>
        <p>In 1962, the list price of the least expensive Ferrari, the 250 GTE, was over $12,000: a 1962 Corvette had a base price of $4,038.</p>
        <p>As expensive as the rarest old Ferraris are, that's not to say that all Ferraris command six-digit prices. Some, like the 1975-85 eight-cylinder 308 series, which was seen regularly on ''Magnum P.I.,'' can be bought for $25,000. But they are hardly rare, because slightly more than 12,000 were built.</p>
        <p>Two years ago, I paid $22,000 for a 1963 Ferrari with a V-12 engine, a 330 America, which I found stored in a decrepit garage in Missoula, Mont. But the 330 America, a four-seat model with no competition history, will never be the favorite of high-end Ferrari collectors.</p>
        <p>Ferrari has had a continuous involvement with Formula One racing since 1947, a record no other manufacturer can match. Ferrari's first Formula One world championship came in 1952, and it has claimed the series crown 10 more times since then.</p>
        <p>Ferrari has also won some of the most hotly contested races in the world, including the 12 Hours of Sebring, the 24 Hours of Le Mans, the Italian Mille Miglia and in Germany, the Nurburgring 1,000 Kilometers.</p>
        <p>Ferrari owes much of its exclusivity to the man who built the first one, Enzo Ferrari, who was born on Feb. 18, 1898, on the outskirts of Modena, Italy. Ferrari, who died in 1988, began his racing career in 1920, when he started driving for Alfa Romeo. He went on to become head of Alfa's factory racing department.</p>
        <p>In 1947, Ferrari built the first car to carry his name, the Type 125 Sport, a two-seat racer. Although the engines in the 125 Sport were tiny, with a displacement of only 1,500 cubic centimeters (about 90 cubic inches), they had 12 cylinders in a V configuration, a layout that became synonymous with the name Ferrari over the years.</p>
        <p>Ferraris have always been produced in small numbers. It wasn't until 1963 that a single model saw more than 500 cars produced: the 250 GTE series, with a total production run of 955. Most models had far lower totals -- fewer than 100 cars was usual -- and the most valuable cars are consistently those produced in the lowest numbers coupled with the most illustrious racing histories.</p>
        <p>For instance, a Ferrari that has been gaining rapidly in value is the 1956-59 250 GT ''Tour de France,'' so called because one was driven to victory in the grueling five-day race of the same name in 1956. Just 77 were built, but nearly all survive, and practically all have been used in competition.</p>
        <p>A Tour de France that had sat gathering dust in a European museum for 32 years was sold last May at a Brooks auction in Monaco for $758,523. The restoration of the car will cost another $200,000.</p>
        <p>That means a total investment of almost $1 million. Is it worth the money?</p>
        <p>''TdF's are popular because they can be driven in vintage events in Europe and the U.S., and this particular car was in extremely original condition,'' said Michael Sheehan, a Ferrari broker in Newport Beach, Calif.</p>
        <p>''Sophisticated collectors will often pay much more for a car that has a patina of originality, as opposed to one that has been restored over and over again,'' he said. ''They want to be the first ones to completely redo a car, and do it to their tastes and standards.''</p>
        <p>Some of the appeal of Ferraris is purely visceral. Nearly every collector talks about the sound the Ferrari engine makes.</p>
        <p>''Ferraris sound great,'' said Nick Soprano, the managing consultant at Motor Classic and Competition, a collector-car dealership in White Plains. ''The engines make all the right noises. And with the older cars, when they were new, they represented a real race car thinly disguised for use on the highway.</p>
        <p>When people buy a Ferrari, they're buying a car that has a true thoroughbred automotive history,'' he said. ''Ferrari has never built an ordinary car, has never built a production four-door, and never will.''</p>
        <p>THAT said, it should also be noted that the Ferrari market peaked in 1990  and then suffered a dot-com-type crash the same year. The 250 GTO that brought $17 million in 1990 was sold in 1998 to a collector in Switzerland for $3.5 million, Mr. Sheehan said.</p>
        <p>But the market has been recovering in the last three years, and the same car would be worth ''around $7 million today,'' he said.</p>
        <p>When a rare Ferrari comes to market, buyers take note. ''Ferraris will always be collectible,'' said Mr. Tonkin, the Portland dealer. ''The number of people who want to own them keeps increasing. Because my three sons grew up riding in my Ferraris, they've all ended up wanting vintage Ferraris of their own, but the number of vintage Ferraris hasn't increased any. When it comes to driving a fantasy, nothing will ever beat being behind the wheel of a Ferrari.''</p>
