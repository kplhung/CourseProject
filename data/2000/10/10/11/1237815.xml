        <p>FOR more than 35 years, on a sleepy stretch of 52nd Street that terminates in a dead end, Le Perigord has been a dignified presence on the dining scene. Like an elderly couple doing the fox trot as the young folk thrash and flail on the dance floor around them, it has maintained a serene indifference to almost every current in culinary fashion.</p>
        <p>It's a French restaurant the way French restaurants used to be, the way no one makes them anymore. The waiters, well on in years, wear white jackets. The even more senior captains wear tuxedos. There is a dessert trolley, and on that dessert trolley you know with dead certainty that you will find floating island, chocolate mousse and tarte Tatin.</p>

        <p>FOR more than 35 years, on a sleepy stretch of 52nd Street that terminates in a dead end, Le Perigord has been a dignified presence on the dining scene. Like an elderly couple doing the fox trot as the young folk thrash and flail on the dance floor around them, it has maintained a serene indifference to almost every current in culinary fashion.</p>
        <p>It's a French restaurant the way French restaurants used to be, the way no one makes them anymore. The waiters, well on in years, wear white jackets. The even more senior captains wear tuxedos. There is a dessert trolley, and on that dessert trolley you know with dead certainty that you will find floating island, chocolate mousse and tarte Tatin.</p>
        <p>On a recent afternoon, an elderly woman, wearing a hair bow that looked like the ribbon from a large Christmas package, stopped in and looked around the restaurant. She sensed something amiss. It was, in some way, different. A half-dozen waiters clustered around her, assuring her that, no, she was not mistaken, this was indeed Le Perigord, and yes, Georges Briguet, the owner, was still firmly in charge.</p>
        <p>The visitor was right, though. Something is different about the place. Last summer, Le Perigord closed for a face-lift. The notoriously low ceilings were raised half a foot, the banquettes were reupholstered in tomato-red fabric, and the walls, after being outfitted with tasteful culinary framed prints, took on a gentle yellowy peach blush. More important, the restaurant hired a new chef, Jacques Qualin, 34, who for the last several years has been cooking at JoJo and Jean Georges. He has brought a new spark to the kitchen, which has sagged in recent years, and freshened up a tired formula. Only the Dover sole remains.</p>
        <p>Despite the dreamy-looking castle and the big swan depicted on the menu, the ancient region known as the Perigord (more or less the modern Dordogne) never actually found its way to the table. It was a romantic image rather than a culinary fact. Mr. Qualin, who grew up in the Jura region, has moved the cuisine even further away from southwestern France. He has sprinkled ingredients from his home region here and there, most notably in a stunning turbot with a crust of bread crumbs and Comte cheese, so thin it scarcely seems to exist, except for an unmistakable crunch with each bite, and a glorious overlay of pungent, hazel-nutty flavor sharpened with the faintest possible touch of mustard. A light Champagne sauce enfolds the fish like a sheet of silk.</p>
        <p>The turbot is a hard act to equal. Impossible, actually. But Mr. Qualin makes a very good showing with his lush, velvety watercress soup, enriched with a quenelle-like dollop of creme fraiche and sevruga caviar. Soup seems to be one of his strong suits. Shreds of peekytoe crab somehow managed to assert their flavor against an intense, concentrated chilled broth surrounding a small island of pureed avocado. The avocado seemed superfluous, but it held a rare prize: two of the chickpea-flour crackers known as panisses, each the size of a half dollar.</p>
        <p>Mr. Qualin has a showy side, and it turns up in his terrine of arctic char, the fish ingeniously wrapped in a fish-stock-and-herb gelee so that each slice, flavored with coconut emulsion and ginger oil, comes out in a pattern of four pink squares defined by a thick green border.</p>
        <p>A gelee made with vin de paille, a Jura wine a little like Italy's vin santo, makes an intriguing contribution to a foie gras terrine marbled with celeriac, an unexpected, brightening ingredient. Sauteed foie gras reflects Mr. Qualin's interest in Middle Eastern and Asian cooking. It comes with mission figs macerated in port, and chutney spiced with cardamom. A thick, hefty veal chop, expertly seared, also takes an exotic detour. Coated in a tangy lemon yogurt sauce, it absorbs a smoky licorice flavor from little tufts of anise hyssop poked into the meat.</p>
        <p>Some dishes are merely respectable, like the fricassee of escargots in hazelnut butter, and frogs' legs in a sauce made with Savagnin wine from the Jura. The antipasto spread, laid out on a handsome sideboard near the entrance, is a hit-or-miss affair. But on balance, Mr. Qualin must be given high marks for shaking things up at one of New York's most torpid restaurants. If only he could remake the staff.</p>
        <p>There is a part of me that wants Le Perigord to stay in its peculiar time warp. The spectacle is simply too delicious. One evening, my wife and I entered and waited for someone, anyone, to greet us and check us in. That someone never appeared. A member of our party signaled frantically from across the room, , and we found our way to the table unassisted. Our elderly captain, conveniently provided by central casting, spent half his time complimenting me on my sage choice of wines and dazzling command of the French tongue, the other half hissing at his underlings, who, as far as I could gather, got on his nerves by moving too fast. When it came time to leave, we were on our own again. We left undisturbed by a single thank you or farewell. On another evening, we were the object of much attention. Our waiter, convinced that I had underpaid the bill, dashed across the room with an impressive display of speed.</p>
        <p>Some nights, the restaurant can seem like a cross between Fawlty Towers and Katz's Delicatessen. Waiters try to remove your plate, even as you grip it tightly, fighting for a last bite. The dessert trolley gets stuck in narrow passages, causing the floating islands to bob furiously. The staff swarms, then disappears. Is there a dormitory upstairs?</p>
        <p>The diners, many of them longtime patrons from the United Nations and the neighborhood, do not seem to mind, and I think I understand why. Inside Le Perigord, they can swaddle themselves in a quietly civilized atmosphere, a million miles removed from the tumult of the city outside. If the waiters can be a little cranky, so what? They also can be charming and solicitous. The equation seems to balance out by meal's end.</p>
        <p>And if a certain someone should greet you at the door, why, that's a special evening indeed.</p>
