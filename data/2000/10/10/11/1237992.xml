        <p>Singapore's economy grew 10.2 percent in the third quarter compared with the period a year earlier, its fastest pace in three years, according to preliminary estimates released by the Minister of Trade and Industry. Fueling growth were orders for computer chips and other computer-related goods, which drove exports to a record. The numbers appeared to defy predictions that slowing growth in United States demand would hobble Asia's export-dependent economies, especially Singapore's. The numbers prompted the government to raise its prediction for full-year economic growth to 9 percent from a range of 7.5 percent to 8.5 percent.</p>
