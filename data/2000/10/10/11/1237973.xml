        <p>In a Silicon Valley rendering of ''The Empire Strikes Back,'' Intel Corporation executives took the stage at an industry gathering today to deflect the first inroads of a tiny but highly visible competitor in the lucrative chip market for portable computers.</p>
        <p>The Intel officials were careful not to mention the name of the upstart, the Transmeta Corporation, either during a technical presentation at the Microprocessor Forum, a technical conference that began today, or at a press lunch that followed. But the message was clear.</p>
        <p>Intel, the world's largest semiconductor maker, said that its current generation of mobile Pentium processors already consumed less power on average than Transmeta's, and that a set of technologies on the horizon for 2002 or 2003 would keep Intel comfortably in the lead.</p>
        <p>But some analysts said Intel's decision to promote a generation of products two years away suggested the pressure it is feeling at the low end of its product line.</p>
        <p>The company is responding to assertions by Transmeta that its Intelcompatible products would run just as fast as Intel's chips, but consume substantially less power and give off less heat.</p>
        <p>The dispute is seen as becoming a crucial one, as portable computers are introduced in the United States that can run four hours or longer on a single battery charge.</p>
        <p>Transmeta, founded six years ago by a former Sun Microsystems technologist, David R. Ditzel, has taken a software-intensive approach to chip design to allow variable consumption of power depending on the demands of the program in use. Since the company introduced its chip in January, three Japanese consumer giants, Sony, Fujitsu and Hitachi, have announced new low-power machines based on the Transmeta design.</p>
        <p>But the Transmeta-powered computers will not reach dealers' shelves until Oct. 25, and computer experts have not yet been able to assess the validity of the company's claims.</p>
        <p>Today, while acknowledging that they had not had access to the Transmeta machines, Intel officials said they believed their existing processors already were more energy-efficient. ''We think we're better in what we deliver to the end user,'' said Frank Spindler, a vice president who heads the mobile platform group.</p>
        <p>He said a version of the company's Pentium III processor for portable computers, to be introduced in the first half of 2001, would use less than one watt of power on average -- comparable to Transmetas claim -- and less than three watts in DVD playback.</p>
        <p>But the model that Intel showed today to demonstrate its contentions offers processing power of only 500 megahertz on house current or 300 megahertz on battery power. The Transmeta processor in the Sony Vaio scheduled to go on sale in the United States this month is rated at 600 megahertz in both cases.</p>
        <p>In addition to the competing claims about their chips energy efficiency, the two companies, both based in Santa Clara, Calif., have been quarreling over how to measure power savings. The Transmeta processor makes extensive use of an approach it calls Long Run, software that continually adjusts the power consumption of the chip based on the type of work the processor is doing.</p>
        <p>Intel officials emphasized their Speed Step technology, which continually turns the processor on and off as power is needed. They said they believed that on average, the Transmeta approach yields no advantage over Intel's in power savings.</p>
        <p>In any case, Richard Doherty, a computer industry consultant who is president of Envisioneering, a research firm in Seaford, N.Y., said Transmeta had put Intel on the defensive. ''Until they have manufacturing process improvements,'' he said, ''they are going to have to redefine the terms of the argument.''</p>
        <p>He said I.B.M.s announcement of a huge semiconductor manufacturing expansion plan today was attributable in part to anticipated demand for Transmeta's chips. I.B.M. is one of two subcontractors actually producing Transmeta's chips, though it has made no commitment to use them in its computers.</p>
        <p>Transmeta officials said today that their company, which recently filed for an initial public offering, is in a quiet period under Securities and Exchange Commission rules and therefore could not respond extensively to Intel's statements. But they pointed to financial documents that detail the company's product directions, indicating that it plans to match other future capabilities outlined by Intel today, including microprocessors capable of one-gigahertz speeds for portable computers, or roughly twice the processing power of the chip it demonstrated today.</p>
        <p>''Intel is clearly playing catch-up,'' said Mr. Ditzel, who was present at the Intel speech and was carrying an early-release version of the 2.2pound Transmeta-powered Sony Vaio. ''And Transmeta is not going to stand still.''</p>
        <p>Not everyone was consumed by this war of words. One analyst, Nathan Brookwood of Insight 64, a market research firm in Saratoga, Calif., said he was skeptical that microprocessor design could have so great an impact on the energy consumption of a complete system, compared with other power demands. ''The biggest power consumer is the LCD display,'' he said. ''It has an entire light bulb behind it.''</p>
