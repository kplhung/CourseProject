        <p>Motorola Inc., the big telecommunications and semiconductor company, said yesterday that its third-quarter profit rose 66 percent, in line with Wall Street estimates, on strong sales of broadband equipment and computer chips.</p>
        <p>The company, based in Schaumburg, Ill., said profit from operations rose to $598 million, or 26 cents a share, compared with $361 million, or 16 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. Sales increased to $9.5 billion from $8.1 billion but were less than the $10 billion Wall Street analysts had been expecting, according to First Call/Thomson Financial.</p>

        <p>Motorola Inc., the big telecommunications and semiconductor company, said yesterday that its third-quarter profit rose 66 percent, in line with Wall Street estimates, on strong sales of broadband equipment and computer chips.</p>
        <p>The company, based in Schaumburg, Ill., said profit from operations rose to $598 million, or 26 cents a share, compared with $361 million, or 16 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. Sales increased to $9.5 billion from $8.1 billion but were less than the $10 billion Wall Street analysts had been expecting, according to First Call/Thomson Financial.</p>
        <p>Including charges and gains, net income totaled $531 million, or 23 cents a share, compared with $114 million, or 5 cents a share, in the period a year earlier.</p>
        <p>The most-recent quarter's charges totaled $95 million, or 3 cents a share. Motorola said it incurred most of these charges by discontinuing older wireless products, closing two semiconductor wafer fabrication plants and departing from unprofitable businesses. The charges also included a lawsuit settlement. Motorola added that the charges were ''largely offset'' by the sale of securities.</p>
        <p>Net income in the quarter a year earlier included charges related to Motorola's investment in the Iridium satellite system and gains from the sale of businesses.</p>
        <p>Before Motorola announced its results, its shares fell 38 cents, to $26.63. After hours, they slipped to $26.25.</p>
        <p>In the most recent quarter, Motorola said its broadband communications and semiconductor products segments reported strong sales growth compared with figures in the period a year earlier. But its closely watched wireless handset segment reported sales growth of just 4 percent as the company continued to pull back from Europe, where it had been in a money-losing battle for market share with Nokia.</p>
        <p>Motorola also reported that its operating margin on wireless telephones had increased to 6 percent of sales from 4 percent in the second quarter and 2 percent in the first quarter. Earlier, Motorola had told analysts it hoped to achieve a 10 percent margin on handsets by the end of this year.</p>
        <p>''It will be interesting to see how bullish they are'' on whether that target can still be met, said Peter Firstbrook, a research analyst at META Group.</p>
        <p>Motorola also reported that orders for its wireless phones fell 23 percent, but it attributed much of the decline to unusual market conditions.</p>
        <p>Handset orders soared in the third quarter of 1999, Motorola said, when customers were worried about a wireless-phone components shortage. Their fears have since abated, but the customers still have so many orders on backlog that they substantially reduced new orders in the just-ended third quarter, Motorola said.</p>
        <p>''The company expects that order growth during the fourth quarter of 2000 will return to a more normal relationship with sales growth,'' Motorola said in a prepared statement.</p>
        <p>Wall Street analysts, who had been expecting Motorola's third-quarter results to send a signal about the general strength of technology stocks, and particularly about the global semiconductor market, found little to criticize in the new data.</p>
        <p>''I think that the market has been so jittery that just having them make their numbers is a positive,'' said Mr. Firstbrook, adding that he was surprised that Motorola had not reported earnings per share of a penny above the analysts' consensus, as it has in the previous two quarters. He said he assumed the company was trying to avoid creating a pattern it would not be able to fulfill in the future.</p>
        <p>''I think they know they're going to be struggling to make their numbers for the next couple of quarters, so they don't want to set up a problem,'' Mr. Firstbrook said.</p>
