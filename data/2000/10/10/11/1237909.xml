        <p>Faced with a Republican assault on Vice President Al Gore's truthfulness and credibility, the Gore campaign has mounted a counterattack, accusing Gov. George W. Bush and his running mate, Dick Cheney, of being the ones with credibility problems.</p>
        <p>In a series of statements in the last two days, Mr. Gore's aides have used language that almost exactly echoes the Bush campaign's daily challenges to Mr. Gore's trustworthiness. They accused Mr. Cheney of telling ''a real whopper'' in the vice-presidential debate when he said that his wealth had nothing to do with government and of ''distortions'' in describing Mr. Bush's tax cut proposals.</p>
        <p>And Ron Klain, a Gore adviser, said today in a conference call with reporters that Mr. Bush ''is being misleading to the American people'' in how he describes his Social Security proposal.</p>
        <p>The Gore counteroffensive comes as strategists in both parties acknowledge that perceptions that Mr. Gore embellishes stories have gained traction on the eve of the second presidential debate.</p>
        <p>The race is now in a statistical dead heat and The Pew Research Center for the People and the Press has found in a new voter survey that recent events, including the first presidential debate, have taken a toll on Mr. Gore when voters are asked about the candidates' likability and honesty.</p>
        <p>At the same time, the Bush campaign has begun using the charges  about exaggerating and embellishing to try to discredit Mr. Gore's policy proposals and fend off new Democratic television ads that criticize the governor's record in Texas.</p>
        <p>The Bush campaign today, for example, charged that Mr. Gore ''continued to exaggerate his proposal'' for universal preschool. It said Mr. Gore fails to say his proposal would not apply to 3-year-olds.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush has long sought to make character a major issue in this campaign and to link Mr. Gore to the flaws of President Clinton. But Mr. Gore shook off questions about his personality and Mr. Clinton at the Democratic National Convention, by pronouncing himself his ''own man.''</p>
        <p>But in the last few weeks and the first debate, Mr. Gore gave the Republicans new openings. At one point in the debate he tried to one-up Mr. Bush by saying he had visited Texas fire victims along with James Lee Witt, the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. He later said he had made a mistake and had traveled to Texas but not with Mr. Witt.</p>
        <p>''The grass has always been very dry under Al Gore when it comes to his habit of embellishing and exaggerating,'' said Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for Mr. Bush. ''He himself lit the fire when he did it before 35 million Americans.''</p>
        <p>Democrats say that the Republicans are magnifying trivial misstatements. But they also admit such statements take on added weight this year because voters remember Mr. Clinton's finger pointing denial that he had had sex with a White House intern and are putting a premium on honesty.</p>
        <p>Mark Mellman, a Democratic pollster, said he thought the focus on Mr. Gore's misstatements was overblown and would ''fade into the ether.'' But he also said Mr. Gore and his aides needed to ''create a situation where they can move on to something else.'' Another Democrat who did not want to be identified said that in a case like this. it was useful to ''muddy the waters'' by echoing the charges of the opposition.</p>
        <p>The Gore campaign is trying simultaneously to nullify the Bush attacks on credibility and focus on issues that they think favor the Democrats. ''Our focus is on their distortions of major issues that actually impact people's lives,'' said Douglas Hattaway, a spokesman for Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>Today the Gore campaign put forward Mr. Klain and Alicia Munnell, a former member of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, to argue that Mr. Bush is being misleading on Social Security. They said he was not telling the public that most experts believe a plan like his to put some Social Security payroll taxes into individual investment accounts would have to be accompanied either by cuts in the guaranteed benefit or huge infusions of new money into the program.</p>
        <p>The Gore camp also said that Mr. Cheney had overlooked many of Mr. Bush's own proposed new tax credits for things like health insurance when he said in the vice-presidential debate ''they like tax credits -- we like tax reform and tax cuts.''</p>
        <p>And one line of attack was personal. Two days in a row, citing news and opinion pieces, the Gore campaign said Mr. Cheney was ''not being fully honest'' when he joked in the vice-presidential debate that government had nothing to do with his financial gains after leaving Washington.</p>
        <p>The Gore camp said Mr. Cheney's contacts from his years in government made him attractive to the Halliburton Company, and they said Halliburton had benefited from financial guarantees from federal  agencies.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's aides and some Republican pollsters said that any Gore attack would not take hold because it does not play into the perceived vulnerabilities of th Republicans. Mr. Fleischer dismissed the charges, saying ''the worse they are doing in the polls the more they exaggerate and make things up.''</p>
        <p>White Ayres, a Republican pollster, said the Gore campaign should have tried another tack. ''The accusation isn't going to fly,'' he said. ''They would have been better off counterattacking on anything which voters already suspect is true.''</p>
