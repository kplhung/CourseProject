        <p>Israelis and Palestinians backed haltingly away from confrontation today as armed clashes subsided and a parade of diplomatic visitors urged both sides to rein in violence.</p>
        <p>For the first time in 12 days the violence began to subside. The most serious casualty today was a 12-year-old Palestinian boy in Gaza, who was critically wounded. Street battles between Israeli troops and rock-throwing Palestinian protesters were confined largely to Gaza and the West Bank city of Ramallah, where volleys of Israeli rubber bullets wounded dozens of Palestinians.</p>
        <p>Israeli commanders said they were limiting the use of live ammunition in an effort to avoid fatalities, and Israeli officials said there were indications that some Palestinian officials were actively discouraging mob clashes with Israeli troops.</p>
        <p>In Washington, a senior administration official said President Clinton had abandoned the idea of a broad summit meeting and was considering holding separate meetings with Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel and Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader. But the president first wanted to evaluate whether the reduced violence was a trend or just a respite, the official said.</p>
        <p>In the space of a few hours this afternoon, Mr. Barak held successive closed-door sessions with the secretary general of the United Nations, the foreign policy chief of the European Union and the foreign minister of Russia, all of whom were coming from or heading to meetings with Mr. Arafat. Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright spoke repeatedly to officials on both sides by phone today, while Robin Cook, the British foreign secretary, was scheduled to arrive on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>Also joining in the intensive diplomatic effort was Martin Indyk, the United States ambassador to Israel, who was back in his office after his security clearance was restored on Monday. The State Department revoked the clearance last month after discovering a supposed mishandling of classified computer files.</p>
        <p>After a marathon cabinet meeting that ended early this morning, Mr. Barak acceded to international pressure to extend the Monday night deadline he had declared for the Palestinians to cease their violence or face stern Israeli retaliation.</p>
        <p>After the cabinet meeting, Mr. Barak said Israel would wait another three or four days before deciding whether to end peace talks and respond to street violence with greater military force than it has displayed so far.</p>
        <p>''I am very grateful that the prime minister and the cabinet yesterday decided not to stick to the deadline,'' said Kofi Annan, the United Nations secretary general, following his meeting with Mr. Barak. ''I think it helps.''</p>
        <p>The Palestinians, meanwhile, invited observers to their hasty restoration work at Joseph's Tomb, a Jewish shrine in Nablus that was burned and ransacked by Arab rioters on Saturday after Israeli forces withdrew and turned the protection of the site over to Palestinian security forces.</p>
        <p>Despite such gestures, the hostility between Israeli and Palestinian leaders remained on display today, as Mr. Arafat taunted Mr. Barak for ''giving one warning after another'' and Mr. Barak's aides questioned Mr. Arafat's trustworthiness as a negotiating partner.</p>
        <p>''Some of the diplomats who have visited us in recent days have said maybe Mr. Arafat wants to control the violence, but he is incapable,''  said Shlomo Ben-Ami, the dovish academic who is Israel's acting foreign minister. ''The only answer one can give to this is, if he is incapable of controlling violence in his territory, what kind of a partner is he? We have a problem with Arafat if willingly he does not control violence, but also if unwillingly he does not control it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak, meanwhile, came under renewed attack from the Israeli right, which publicly spurned his earlier tentative offer to bring the opposition into a new national unity government. Ariel Sharon, the leader of the Likud Party, denounced Mr. Barak's decision to extend the deadline  for the Palestinians, and vowed to push for early elections rather than enter a new coalition government.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak justified his decision to extend the deadline by citing the insistent appeals from Mr. Annan, President Clinton and other world leaders to give both Mr. Arafat and the situation on the street more time.</p>
        <p>But he said that unless the confrontations are brought under control by the weekend, Israel will respond to rioting and attacks on Israeli posts and settlements with greater force.</p>
        <p>''If we find ourselves in a long, painful, difficult confrontation of many long months, there'll be no importance to our having held on for another 72 or 96 hours,'' Mr. Barak said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Annan, who met three times in the last 24 hours with Mr. Arafat, is also working to obtain the release of three Israeli soldiers who were captured by Hezbollah guerrillas on Sunday on the Israeli-Lebanese border. The soldiers are reliably reported to be alive, said Mr. Annan, who goes  from here to Beirut in an effort to arrange a visit to the hostages by Red Cross or United Nations representatives.</p>
        <p>Immediately after his meeting with Mr. Annan, Mr. Barak received the Russian foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, who arrived in Israel late Monday following his own discussions in Beirut and Damascus about the captured Israeli soldiers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak said he would accept an American invitation to resume talks with Mr. Arafat, but only if the violence remained in check and Mr. Arafat displayed a willingness to compromise.</p>
        <p>An earlier proposal by Washington to hold a meeting in Egypt in the next few days was squelched today by Egypt's foreign minister, who said his government's diplomatic focus now is on the Arab League meeting scheduled to open in 10 days in Cairo. American diplomats said they were concerned that this first full meeting of the pan-Arab organization in a decade -- with Iraq and Libya expected to play roles -- could further harden sentiment in the region against a territorial compromise between the Palestinians and Israel.</p>
        <p>Palestinian officials continue to insist on an international investigatory commission into the past 12 days of violence as a prerequisite for the resumption of negotiations. They have rejected a proposed tripartite American-Israeli-Palestinian inquiry as insufficient.</p>
        <p>''There can be no peace talks without an international investigation,'' Hassan Asfour, a senior Palestinian negotiator, said in an interview today. ''Our people did not die for nothing.''</p>
        <p>Over Israel's objections, the United Nations Human Rights Commission may be ready to embark on such an investigation, however. In Geneva, the commission voted to approve an Arab League request today to examine the violence in an unusual special session, the kind used in the past to investigate human rights atrocities in Rwanda and Bosnia.</p>
