        <p>Gov. George W. Bush landed on his opponent's doorstep today, at least politically speaking, to portray Vice President Al Gore as someone who had spent so much time in Washington that he had lost touch with voters even in his home state.</p>
        <p>Bolstered by a recent poll that showed Mr. Bush with a slight but statistically insignificant advantage here, he made a barbed joke about the fact that Mr. Gore might not be able to count on a victory in Tennessee, which he represented for 16 years in Congress.</p>
        <p>''I know I'm not supposed to carry it,'' Mr. Bush told several thousand cheering people at a rally in an airport hangar here. ''They tell me, 'You know, Tennessee's all wrapped up. After all, the man used to live here.' ''</p>
        <p>''He used to call this state home,'' Mr. Bush said. ''But it seems like it was so long in the distant past, he forgot to trust the people of Tennessee. He forgot what it's like to be out here with the hard-working people.''</p>
        <p>The Texas governor was making his way east for the second presidential debate, in Winston-Salem, N.C., on Wednesday night, and his brief stop in Tennessee seemed to fall into the category of a head game, a pointed tweaking of his opponent.</p>
        <p>As he did last week, when he traveled to West Virginia on the day before the first debate, Mr. Bush was again drawing attention to a state where the vice president seems to be performing below expectations. It was a way to cast Mr. Gore as an unappealing contender, even though polls suggest that the two candidates are running neck and neck.</p>
        <p>To further rib Mr. Gore, Mr. Bush alluded to a June news report about tenants of Mr. Gore's in Carthage, Tenn., who said that their frequent complaints about overflowing toilets and clogged sinks had been ignored. Mr. Gore subsequently promised to have the necessary repairs made.</p>
        <p>''Tennessee is a fine place to live,'' Mr. Bush told the crowd today. ''I guess it, though, depends who your landlord is.''</p>
        <p>The audience's laughter filled the hangar, which sported signs that read, ''No More Gore'' and ''A Gore-Free Tennessee.''</p>
        <p>The Bush campaign's communications director, Karen P. Hughes, also roasted Mr. Gore as she talked about the debate, clearly seeking to direct voters' attention to some of the foibles and quirks that he exhibited in the candidates' previous face-off.</p>
        <p>''I've read that the vice president has brought in a debate coach, I guess trying to teach him how not to sigh or roll his eyes or act condescending,'' Ms. Hughes said, alluding to a Newsweek report. But ''over the course of 90 minutes, the real personality tends to come out.''</p>
        <p>Chris Lehane, a spokesman for the Gore campaign, said that the coach had been with Mr. Gore since the primaries. He added that Mr. Bush ''should bring in a magician'' to help him sell his claim that his policies would benefit Americans more.</p>
        <p>At the Tennessee rally, Mr. Bush offered his first public response to the newly aggressive Democratic campaign to dissect and disparage his record in Texas.</p>
        <p>''I understand that my opponent is fixing to go down to Texas, or somebody on his team is, and kind of try to tear down our state,'' Mr. Bush said in a genial, what-else-would-you-expect voice. ''Come on down! We welcome the talk about the Texas record, because it's a state where both Republicans and Democrats have worked together.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush returned again and again to the promise that he would be able to find common ground for Republicans and Democrats. His campaign released a long list of Democrats from around the country who were supporting Mr. Bush, and several of them -- including Griffin B. Bell, who served as the United States attorney general under President Jimmy Carter -- appeared with Mr. Bush today.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Bush hammered hardest at his sustained assertion that Mr. Gore's proposals favored federal mandates over individual autonomy, which he said reflected the fact that Mr. Gore was ''of Washington, for Washington and by Washington.''</p>
        <p>By contrast, Mr. Bush said: ''We want to free the people of this great country. And that's why things are going well in Tennessee, because we stand on the side of the people of this great state, whether they be Republican or Democrat or open-minded independent.''</p>
