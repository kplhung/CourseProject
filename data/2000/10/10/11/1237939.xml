        <p>Perhaps the most honest assessment of the Jets' horrific performance against the Pittsburgh Steelers on Sunday came courtesy of Marcus Coleman, one of the team's starting cornerbacks.</p>
        <p>''I think we were ready to play for a minute,'' he said. ''After that, I don't know what happened.''</p>
        <p>What happened in the 20-3 loss was a nearly complete meltdown by the Jets. With three straight games, and five of their next six, against division opponents, the Jets can ill afford to let such a woeful combination of events persist -- especially this Sunday against the resurgent New England Patriots, against whom the Jets needed a dramatic fourth-quarter comeback to beat, 20-19, on Sept. 11.</p>
        <p>Against the Steelers, the running game had to be abandoned once the Jets fell behind, and Curtis Martin's third-quarter fumble added to the pain. The offensive line was dreadful for the first time all season. Guard Randy Thomas missed a block that allowed quarterback Vinny Testaverde to be hit. Tackle Jason Fabini gave up a sack and a fumble; he, guard Kerry Jenkins and tackle Ryan Young all had penalties. The receivers combined for just seven catches. The defensive line and linebackers could not stop Jerome Bettis, who rushed for 107 yards. Although the secondary did not give up a pass longer than 15 yards, Steelers quarterback Kordell Stewart was able to complete critical throws, including 11 passes for first downs.</p>
        <p>''After a performance like that, there will probably be a few positions under scrutiny,'' Jets Coach Al Groh said. ''It doesn't necessarily mean I'm going to change anything, but certain spots I'll have the binoculars on.''</p>
        <p>Of course, no position will be more closely scrutinized than quarterback.</p>
        <p>The Jets gave no update on Testaverde's condition yesterday, but it is hard to imagine that he could, or would, play on Sunday. Testaverde's injury, a pinched nerve, affects his left arm and hand, not his throwing arm. But the injury causes him pain when he turns to look over his left shoulder as he drops back. The former Miami quarterback Dan Marino missed five games last year with a bone spur on the right side of his neck, which pinched a nerve and caused weakness in his shoulder. That injury affected Marino's throwing arm, and he lost velocity on his throws as a result.</p>
        <p>Testaverde conceded that he had lost some zip on his passes because of the injury, and he is concerned that the injury will linger, just as Marino's did last season. After the devastating Achilles' tendon injury last season and a turf toe in the preseason, Testaverde, who turns 37 next month, is sure to face questions about whether he is becoming too brittle to be consistent.</p>
        <p>Ray Lucas's performance this season has lacked the spark he provided when he took over for Testaverde last season. When Groh benched Testaverde for one drive against Tampa Bay earlier this season, Lucas failed to ignite the dormant offense, which went three and out. Against the Steelers, the Jets veteran receiver Dwight Stone said, Lucas was trying to make too much happen too quickly. Lucas had one of the worst statistical days of his career: 99 yards passing, 2 interceptions and a fumble.</p>
        <p>But Lucas's history indicates that he is more effective as a starter than as a long reliever. In his first start last season, the Jets, then 1-4, lost to the Colts by just 3 points, after Lucas was intercepted in the Indianapolis end zone in the fourth quarter with the score tied. But in his second start, the Jets beat the Patriots in Foxboro, Mass.</p>
        <p>In that game, Lucas outplayed New England's Drew Bledsoe, throwing two touchdown passes. Later in the season, Lucas beat Dallas's Troy Aikman and Marino, twice, to finish 6-3 as a starter. By the end of the season, the Jets believed they were the best team in the league and that Lucas could have led them into the playoffs.</p>
        <p>Lucas is now looking to regain his 1999 form. He vowed to change his preparation drastically this week because whatever he did last week clearly didn't work.</p>
        <p>''My confidence is still there,'' Lucas said. ''There is no excuse for the way I played. But am I going to get in the tank all week? We're still 4-1. I can't be saying, 'You lost one game, now you'll lose 11.' It's not always going to be roses and chocolates. It was a bunch of dead roses and stale chocolates Sunday.''</p>
