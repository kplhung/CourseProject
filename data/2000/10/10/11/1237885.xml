        <p>Senator Joseph I. Lieberman said today that Republicans were attacking Vice President Al Gore's character because they were ''out of touch with the majority of Americans'' and could not win on the issues.</p>
        <p>''Maybe folks on the other side know that Al and I are really where America wants to be on the issues,'' he told 400 people here at a forum on higher education, ''so that forces them to resort to the kind of personal attacks that they have on Al Gore.''</p>

        <p>Senator Joseph I. Lieberman said today that Republicans were attacking Vice President Al Gore's character because they were ''out of touch with the majority of Americans'' and could not win on the issues.</p>
        <p>''Maybe folks on the other side know that Al and I are really where America wants to be on the issues,'' he told 400 people here at a forum on higher education, ''so that forces them to resort to the kind of personal attacks that they have on Al Gore.''</p>
        <p>But as the Democrats' own counterpunches turn increasingly personal and harsh -- the Gore campaign mocked Gov. George W. Bush's malapropisms in recent days as ''babbling incoherently'' -- Mr. Lieberman said he would not make such attacks himself.</p>
        <p>''I haven't said such things, and I don't intend to say such things,'' Mr. Lieberman, the Democratic vice-presidential nominee, told reporters on his campaign plane, putting some distance between himself and his own campaign's newest offensive.</p>
        <p>Gore campaign officials have said that the toughest remarks will come from surrogates, allowing the candidates themselves to refrain from the kind of slashing attacks that can sully the attacker as well as the target.</p>
        <p>When asked if Mr. Bush's command of the issues -- and particularly his occasional difficulty articulating his own positions -- was a legitimate issue, Mr. Lieberman said, ''My feeling is, matters of that kind, the American people should reach their own judgment.''</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Lieberman took a backhanded swipe at the Texas governor in praising Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>''You know, he doesn't have to cram to know who different world leaders are, or the details of our history in the Balkans or Asia or the Middle East or anywhere else,'' he said of Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman campaigned today in Minnesota and Washington, states that Democrats have dominated in recent elections, but where polls show Mr. Gore barely ahead.</p>
