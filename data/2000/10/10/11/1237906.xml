        <p>Technology stock prices fell sharply again yesterday as fears spread that a slowing economy would drag down corporate earnings through the end of the year.</p>
        <p>Concerns that there may be more bad news in coming earnings reports intensified after the market closed, when Lucent Technologies said that its fourth-quarter profit would be even less than estimated and that it would lower its revenue and profit estimates for the new fiscal year. Its shares were punished after hours.</p>
        <p>Two other prominent technology companies, Yahoo and Motorola, reported third-quarter earnings that respectively exceeded and met Wall Street expectations, but investors sold those stocks after hours as well.</p>
        <p>Analysts and traders said it would take a string of good earnings reports to restore confidence in technology shares.</p>
        <p>''At this point, it looks like a runaway freight train,'' said Kenneth M. Sheinberg, head of listed trading at SG Cowen.</p>
        <p>''It will take a lot of good earnings to stop the bleeding in technology,'' Mr. Sheinberg said.</p>
        <p>Semiconductor stocks led the slide in technology shares yesterday after analysts at a number of brokerage firms downgraded two chip makers, Altera and Xilinx, saying increasing supplies of chips could slow growth.</p>
        <p>The Nasdaq composite index fell 115.02 points, or 3.4 percent, to 3,240.54. It was the fourth consecutive decline for the Nasdaq and its steepest one-day drop in percentage terms since July 28, when it fell 4.7 percent. So far this year, the Nasdaq is down more than 20 percent, and the index is down 36 percent from its high of 5,048.62, set on March 10. The Nasdaq is just 75.99 points away from its low of the year, 3,164.55, reached on May 23.</p>
        <p>The other main gauges declined as well, but not as much as the Nasdaq.</p>
        <p>The Dow Jones industrial average fell 44.03 points, or 0.4 percent, to 10,524.40. Gains in drug and oil company stocks offset some of the declines in bank and technology shares.</p>
        <p>Drug and oil stocks also limited the slide in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index, which fell 15.01 points, or 1.1 percent, to 1387.02.</p>
        <p>''This is a very treacherous market right now,'' said Bill Allyn, head of listed trading at Jefferies &amp; Company.</p>
        <p>''People talked about extended valuations for some time, and many investors paid no heed. Now they are,'' he said.</p>
        <p>On the Big Board yesterday, Lucent fell $1, to $31.38, which means it has lost more than 55 percent of its value this year. But it sank even more after its earnings warning. In after-hours trading, the stock fell as low as $24.</p>
        <p>''Just because Lucent looked cheap at the close doesn't mean it can't get cheaper,'' said Steven D. Levy, a Lehman Brothers analyst.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levy said that while investors were likely to punish Lucent the most when trading begins today, ''almost all the telecommunications equipment companies and some of the component companies who supply Lucent'' will be under pressure.</p>
        <p>The downgrade of Altera and Xilinx sent many semiconductor stocks lower. Altera fell $11.06, to $29.81, and was the most actively traded stock yesterday. Xilinx fell $16.69, to $62.44. Among other chip stocks, PMC-Sierra lost $19.06, to $171. Micron Technology fell $2.88 to $36.88. And Applied Materials fell $6.69, to $49.06.</p>
        <p>The Philadelphia semiconductor index fell for the 10th time in 14 sessions, losing 10 percent of its value. Over the last three months, the index has declined 39 percent on concern about slowing demand and rising supplies of chips.</p>
        <p>After the market closed, Yahoo reported third-quarter earnings that beat expectations but also suggested that failures and scaling back among dot-com advertisers had limited growth and might continue to do so. Its shares, which closed at $82.69, down $3.06, fell as low as $77 after hours.</p>
        <p>Investors were kinder to Motorola, which slipped slightly after hours. While the company met earnings expectations, third-quarter revenue was somewhat weaker than forecast.</p>
        <p>The stock edged down to $26.25 in late trading after ending the regular session at $26.63, down 38 cents.</p>
        <p>Financial stocks were generally weak, but the selling of brokerage stocks was particularly heavy.</p>
        <p>Morgan Stanley Dean Witter suffered the most. Its shares sank $8.75, to $74.50, on renewed speculation that it faces losses from exposure to high-yield telecommunications company debt.</p>
        <p>But Merrill Lynch fell $1.31, to $58. Goldman Sachs was down $2.56, to $102.69. And Citigroup, the parent of Salomon Smith Barney, shed $1.63, to $51.</p>
        <p>Drug stocks did well. And a third consecutive daily increase in the price of crude oil lifted oil stocks.</p>
        <p>Among drug companies, Pfizer gained $1.38, to $44.50. Merck rose $1.56, to $76.88. Johnson &amp; Johnson closed at $94.63, up $3.31. And Abbott Laboratories gained $1.38, to $49.06.</p>
        <p>Gainers in oil included Exxon Mobil, which increased $2.19, to $93.31. Royal Dutch Petroleum rose $1.06, to $62.75. And Texaco gained $1.69, to $54.63.</p>

        <p>Treasury Prices Rise</p>
        <p>By Reuters</p>
        <p>Bond prices moved slightly higher yesterday, reversing their lackluster downward course as weakness in technology stocks produced some safe-haven buying.</p>
        <p>The price of the 10-year Treasury note rose 10/32, to 99 26/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.77 percent from 5.82 percent on Friday.</p>
        <p>The price of the 30-year bond rose 15/32, to 106 4/32. Its yield fell to 5.81 percent from 5.85 percent on Friday.</p>
        <p>The bond market was closed Monday for Columbus Day.</p>

        <p>THE MARKETS: STOCKS &amp; BONDS  Correction:  October 14, 2000, Saturday  A table in the World Business section on Wednesday showing the previous day's closing prices for United States stock indexes misstated the figure for the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index.
