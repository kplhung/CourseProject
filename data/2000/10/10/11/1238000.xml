        <p>When Sante and Kenneth Kimes -- the hand-holding, mother-and-son grifter team -- were sentenced to 125 years in June, it seemed like the end of a surreal string of crimes that culminated in the murder of an elderly Upper East Side socialite. But yesterday, during a prison interview, Mr. Kimes took a Court TV reporter hostage for four hours, holding a pen to her neck.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kimes, 25, was being interviewed by Maria Zone, 35, a freelance producer for the documentary series ''Crime Stories,'' at the Clinton Correctional Facility in upstate New York.</p>

        <p>When Sante and Kenneth Kimes -- the hand-holding, mother-and-son grifter team -- were sentenced to 125 years in June, it seemed like the end of a surreal string of crimes that culminated in the murder of an elderly Upper East Side socialite. But yesterday, during a prison interview, Mr. Kimes took a Court TV reporter hostage for four hours, holding a pen to her neck.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kimes, 25, was being interviewed by Maria Zone, 35, a freelance producer for the documentary series ''Crime Stories,'' at the Clinton Correctional Facility in upstate New York.</p>
        <p>The interview began at about 10 a.m., officials at the State Department of Correctional Services said. During a break at 2:15, the officials said, Mr. Kimes went across the visiting room to use the bathroom while Ms. Zone headed in the opposite direction to a vending machine.</p>
        <p>When she returned, he ''pushed a pen against her neck, wrapped his other arm around her shoulder and pulled them both to the floor,'' according to a statement from the department.</p>
        <p>He ordered the only other people in the room -- a correction officer, the cameraman and the sound operator -- to ''back off.''</p>
        <p>The officer pulled an alarm, and other officers, accompanied by hostage negotiators, arrived and escorted the film crew, Drew Harty and Jeremy Drowne, out of the room, said Jim Flateau, a correctional services spokesman.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kimes's main demand was that his mother not be extradited to California, where the two face the death penalty on charges that they killed a former business associate.</p>
        <p>During the negotiation, Mr. Kimes removed the pen from Ms. Zone's throat, officials said. Eventually, the negotiators distracted him long enough for other officials to wrestle him to the ground, Mr. Flateau told Court TV.</p>
        <p>Ms. Zone escaped the incident with minor injuries, and Mr. Kimes was moved to the prison's disciplinary housing unit, the authorities said. He now faces criminal charges in the incident. Ms. Zone had interviewed Mr. Kimes before, said Carolyn Kresky, the executive producer of ''Crime Stories,'' and found him mild-mannered and intelligent.</p>
        <p>''You kind of wondered, how did he end up in this situation, in prison for the rest of his life?'' Ms. Kresky said.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Kimes was under pressure, with his extradition to California imminent.</p>
        <p>''I just got off the phone with one of his mother's lawyers, who said to me, maybe he realizes now he's never going to be free, and reality has set in,'' said Jeanne King, a reporter whose book about the Kimeses, ''Dead End,'' will be published by M. Evans &amp; Company next year.</p>
        <p>In August, Mr. Kimes was interviewed for an article in the November issue of Details magazine. In mid-September, he sent two letters to the editor in chief, asking for the writer, Kevin Gray, to interview him again, said a spokeswoman for the magazine.</p>
        <p>''I truly must see Kevin again and soon,'' he wrote, promising new evidence, including a tape that ''absolutely proves me and my mother's innocence.'' Mr. Gray said that although he had interviewed Mr. Kimes in person three times, the inmate refused to tell him the new information over the phone and insisted that he come again in person to the prison, in Dannemora.</p>
        <p>But he said that Mr. Kimes was not intimidating. ''It's not unlike talking to a manipulative teenager,'' Mr. Gray said. ''He's a conniver. He wants you to believe his story.''</p>
        <p>Correction Officer Tyler Smith, the acting chief steward for the union representing officers, called the hostage incident ''very, very unusual.''</p>
        <p>Still, he said that officers had long felt that the visiting room procedure was unsafe and allowed drugs and contraband to enter the jail.</p>
        <p>Inmates are permitted to have pens in the jail, Officer Smith said, but not in the visiting room.</p>
        <p>''That's the weapon of choice,'' he said. It was unclear whether the pen Mr. Kimes used belonged to him or the reporter.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Kimes, 65, and her son were convicted of conspiring to steal the town house of Irene Silverman, an 82-year-old woman whom they had first met at an anti-aging conference, and of murdering her in the process.</p>
        <p>Though Ms. Silverman's body was never found, prosecutors presented 14 notebooks full of detailed plotting, including Ms. Silverman's schedule and a list of items to gather, including leg irons.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kimes and his mother maintained their innocence, even as they were found guilty on 118 counts, including murder, burglary and robbery.</p>
        <p>At the sentencing hearing, Mr. Kimes gave a long, venomous speech. Among his complaints: Court TV had been allowed to videotape the proceedings.</p>
        <p>Correction:  October 12, 2000, Thursday  An article yesterday about Kenneth Kimes, a convicted murderer who took a Court TV reporter hostage for four hours at an upstate New York prison, referred incompletely to those who were in the visiting room at the time. In addition to two members of the television crew, a correction officer was there.</p>
        <p>The article also misstated an objection made by Mr. Kimes at his sentencing hearing. He complained because Court TV was barred from videotaping the proceedings, not because Court TV cameras were allowed (they were not).</p>
