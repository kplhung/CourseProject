        <p>This is a new 30-second commercial, titled ''Education,'' that the Lazio campaign began broadcasting this week.</p>
        <p>PRODUCER -- The Murphy Pintak Gautier Hudome Agency.</p>
        <p>ON THE SCREEN -- The commercial opens with a shot of Representative Rick A. Lazio, the Republican Senate candidate in New York, surrounded by a multiracial group of children who are scampering about a classroom set, complete with powder-blue cinder block walls, a poster with numbers and the alphabet, a globe and student artwork. He is seated, talking and gesturing, and at one point the children raise their hands, seemingly in response to a question from him. He is then shown speaking to the camera in the same room. The commercial ends with a scene of Mr. Lazio at a table with his wife, Patricia, and their two young daughters, Molly and Kelsey, as if he were helping them with homework.</p>
        <p>THE SCRIPT -- The announcer says: ''Rick Lazio. In Congress he voted for the largest federal investment in public education in history.'' Facing the camera, Mr. Lazio says: ''I think 95 percent of federal education money should go right here to the classroom, instead of being wasted on bureaucrats. Let's put our kids first. And I support testing teachers every five years, with lots of training and support. With two daughters in New York public schools, I care about education as a parent. In the Senate, you can count on me to vote like one.'' Text appears on the screen during the commercial, echoing the words of the announcer and Mr. Lazio.</p>
        <p>ACCURACY -- Mr. Lazio voted for the most recent federal budget, which allocates a record amount of assistance for public education. He also supported a nonbinding House resolution calling for 95 percent of federal financing to go directly to the classroom and has proposed a plan to encourage school districts to test teacher competency. The campaign of his opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton, responds that Mr. Lazio opposed an effort by Democrats to approve even more money for education in the recent budget, and he also favored proposals by the House Republican leadership in 1995 that would have sharply cut education financing. Mr. Lazio does send his children to public school in Suffolk County.</p>
        <p>SCORECARD -- Education policy and financing are largely the province of state and local government, but Mr. Lazio, like many candidates for federal office from both major parties, is trying to demonstrate his concern on an issue that is a priority for voters. With its images of children and of the candidate as a doting parent, the commercial reflects Mr. Lazio's new strategy of focusing on burnishing his own candidacy, rather than on attacking Mrs. Clinton, a shift that was also on display at the Senate debate on Sunday. The mention of his daughters going to public school may be a subtle dig at Mrs. Clinton, who sent her daughter, Chelsea, to private school after the family moved to Washington.</p>
