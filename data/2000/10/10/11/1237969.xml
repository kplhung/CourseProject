        <p>Even while growing up in Southern California, Jim Edmonds couldn't help being a Yankees fan as they won back-to-back World Series in the late 1970's.

Still, he has one reminder in case the Mets are looking ahead now that the Braves have been eliminated.</p>
        <p>''People said the World Series goes through Atlanta,'' Edmonds said today after the Cardinals' off-day workout at Busch Stadium. ''People have to realize they have to come to us.

        <p>Even while growing up in Southern California, Jim Edmonds couldn't help being a Yankees fan as they won back-to-back World Series in the late 1970's. So Edmonds can understand the excitement building in New York over the possibility of a Subway Series. Still, he has one reminder in case the Mets are looking ahead now that the Braves have been eliminated.</p>
        <p>''People said the World Series goes through Atlanta,'' Edmonds said today after the Cardinals' off-day workout at Busch Stadium. ''People have to realize they have to come to us. We don't have to go to anybody. If they want to overlook us and look forward to the Yankees, fine. We'll take another easy series.''</p>
        <p>Edmonds's remarks were echoed by his teammates, who obviously felt the Cardinals were being overlooked in the National League Championship Series. Players sounded slighted because of the attention reserved for the two New York teams. Doesn't this sound familiar?</p>
        <p>St. Louis, for all its rich baseball history even before Mark McGwire wore a pair of cardinals on his chest, seems to relish being the Other Team. The main story on the front page of The St. Louis Post-Dispatch today had the headline, ''Disdain for Mets: Memories of past battles stir passions of Cardinals fans.''</p>
        <p>Today's Cardinals sounded eerily like their predecessors 15 years ago. In 1985, as the Mets and Cardinals battled each other for the N.L. East title to the season's final days, St. Louis players openly resented what they perceived as the undue national attention paid their rivals. When the Cardinals finally clinched the division, shortstop Ozzie Smith and Manager Whitey Herzog led the charge. They were, or wanted to be portrayed as, the little team from mid-America that knocked off the big boys.</p>
        <p>Cardinals Manager Tony La Russa took a page from that book today. ''I guarantee you St. Louis has been there before,'' La Russa said without referring to the 1985 team. ''There are glamour cities people are talking about and a little team from the Midwest has come in there a bunch of times. This is our chance.''</p>
        <p>Eric Davis, who will bat cleanup between the left-handed hitters Edmonds and Will Clark, said the Cardinals were an afterthought all season.</p>
        <p>''Nobody's talked about us all year,'' said Davis, who will play right field. ''They haven't talked about us in the postseason. Nobody gave us a chance to be here.''</p>
        <p>The Mets should not underestimate the Cardinals. They should recall the three-game sweep by St. Louis here to begin September and start the Mets' annual slide.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the Cardinals clinched the Central Division without their most feared hitter, Mark McGwire, who had 30 homers when he landed on the disabled list in July with right knee tendinitis. He didn't return until September, when he became a bench player. McGwire may be the most intimidating pinch-hitter in postseason history.</p>
        <p>McGwire's injury forced the Cardinals to obtain Clark from the salary-dumping Orioles. Clark, who hit .345 with 12 homers, almost instantly became a clubhouse leader.</p>
        <p>''I don't want to say we're going to walk over anybody, but we're definitely a club that needs to be taken seriously,'' Edmonds said. ''We had a lot of respect for Atlanta and we have a lot of respect for the New York club.''</p>
        <p>But that hasn't stopped the Cardinals from reminding observers that a Subway Series is not a foregone conclusion.</p>
        <p>''We don't want to rain on anybody's parade in New York, but we have to do our job,'' Edmonds said. ''I think the Cardinals and Yankees wouldn't be a bad World Series, either. But there is a team out there called the Seattle Mariners, and I don't think they want to go home yet, either.''</p>
        <p>So the Mets' left-handed starting combination of Mike Hampton and Al Leiter should nullify Edmonds and Clark in the lineup? The two hitters are a combined 7 for 30 (.233) with two homers and five runs batted in against the pitchers.</p>
        <p>''How good is Glavine?'' Edmonds responded. He didn't need to mention the seven runs the Cardinals scored against Atlanta off Tom Glavine in Game 2 of the division series.</p>
        <p>Before they met in September, the Mets had won 26 of 33 games against the Cardinals, another statistic St. Louis dismissed. The Cardinals are confident they can beat the Mets and want people to know it. Ray Lankford even noted the Mets were intimidated by the Braves while the Cardinals swept Atlanta in three games.</p>
