        <p>On one front, at least, Kadiatou Diallo is moving forward. Tomorrow, she will announce the formation of the Amadou Diallo Foundation, named for the son killed by four New York City police officers in 1999.</p>
        <p>The foundation's missions are to ''promote racial healing,'' through activities in the public schools and elsewhere, and to provide scholarship support for African college or graduate students who want to study in the United States. It will also finance programs ''seeking to enhance police-community relations.''</p>
        <p>But on another front, both Mrs. Diallo and the officers acquitted last winter of killing her son, an immigrant from Guinea, are stuck in limbo, still awaiting a decision from the federal government on whether it will undertake a prosecution of the officers on civil rights charges.</p>

        <p>On one front, at least, Kadiatou Diallo is moving forward. Tomorrow, she will announce the formation of the Amadou Diallo Foundation, named for the son killed by four New York City police officers in 1999.</p>
        <p>The foundation's missions are to ''promote racial healing,'' through activities in the public schools and elsewhere, and to provide scholarship support for African college or graduate students who want to study in the United States. It will also finance programs ''seeking to enhance police-community relations.''</p>
        <p>But on another front, both Mrs. Diallo and the officers acquitted last winter of killing her son, an immigrant from Guinea, are stuck in limbo, still awaiting a decision from the federal government on whether it will undertake a prosecution of the officers on civil rights charges.</p>
        <p>Until that decision, the Diallos' suit against the officers and the city has been stayed in State Supreme Court in the Bronx. In addition, the city police will not determine what, if any, disciplinary action should be taken against the officers, who remain on modified duty.</p>
        <p>In a meeting with police union officials in March, Deputy Attorney General Eric H. Holder had promised that a federal review of the case would take weeks, not months, yet more than six months later no decision has been made. A Justice Department spokeswoman, Kara Peterman, said a review of the shooting and the trial was ongoing.</p>
        <p>''Nothing has happened,'' Mrs. Diallo said. ''I do not know why.''</p>
        <p>Still, she said, with the foundation's formation, ''I begin to feel more positive, because at least if this thing is successful people will remember Amadou in a positive manner -- not the one who was killed by the police and that's it.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Diallo is president of the foundation, and former Mayor David N. Dinkins is the chairman of its board of directors. The other board members are Norman Siegel, the executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union; Alma Rangel, the wife of Congressman Charles B. Rangel; John D. Feerick, the dean of Fordham Law School; Peter Norton, the software entrepreneur and philanthropist; Dr. Roscoe Brown, the director of the City University's Center for Urban Education Policy; Kathy Jordan-Sharpton, the wife of the Rev. Al Sharpton; and Mrs. Diallo's brother Bobo Diallo. Amadou Diallo's father, Saikou Amad Diallo, from whom Mrs. Diallo is divorced, is not involved with the foundation.</p>
        <p>On the legal front, Anthony Gair, a lawyer for Mrs. Diallo, said he planned to argue in State Supreme Court later this month that the early stages of the civil case should proceed and that the officers should have to answer the Diallos' complaint, even though federal prosecutors have not made a decision.</p>
