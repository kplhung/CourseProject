        <p>The South Korean government began trying to assign blame today for the recent failures of two large business deals that have raised questions about the country's commitment to economic reform.</p>
        <p>Last month, the Ford Motor Company abandoned a $6.9 billion bid to buy Daewoo Motors, and a week ago, a group of investors led by Nabors Capital, a Houston-based firm, walked away from a proposed $480 million purchase of the Hanbo Steel Company. Both Korean companies are insolvent.</p>
        <p>The Financial Supervisory Service criticized the Korea First Bank and the state-run Korea Asset Management Corporation, major creditors of Hanbo, for failing to shape a contract that would have penalized the Nabors group for pulling out of the deal.</p>
        <p>And it faulted the Daewoo Restructuring Committee and its head, Oh Hogen, for failing to prepare for an event like the Firestone tire recall and the impact that might have on Ford's bid for Daewoo Motors. The government has insisted that Ford's decision to walk away was based solely on Ford's own problems and had nothing to do with Daewoo Motors itself.</p>
        <p>''Daewoo's creditors failed to arrange a contingency plan for the deal against a possible pull-out in relation to the Firestone tire recall,'' the Financial Supervisory Service said in a statement. Ford has said its decision to abandon the Daewoo deal had nothing to do with Ford's Bridgestone/Firestone problems.</p>
        <p>The government seemed to time its criticism especially to embarrass Mr. Oh, an aggressive advocate of painful corporate change. He was already scheduled to leave his job as head of the Daewoo Restructuring Committee on Wednesday, when his contract expired, but the government forced him to pack up today.</p>
        <p>''It's funny, really,'' he said in a telephone interview this evening. ''They had to have someone to pin the responsibility on, and I was that person. That's it.''</p>
        <p>In an interview on Aug. 10 in Seoul, Mr. Oh said that his last day in charge of Daewoo's restructuring would be Oct. 11, when his contract expired. ''I have no intention of extending it,'' he said at that time, speaking of his contract.</p>
        <p>He foreshadowed some of what transpired today in that August interview. ''It's been a tough job,'' he said, speaking not only of his time at Daewoo but also his previous role as head of the Corporate Restructuring Committee, which supervised the overhaul of many Korean conglomerates in the aftermath of the financial crisis in 1997. ''When you've done well, you hardly get any thanks for it, and very often, the people who are supposed to be on your side don't recognize the problems and want only quick solutions, not fundamental fixes.''</p>
        <p>The government is not his only critic. He left behind a string of angry foreign bankers, who were irked when Mr. Oh forced them to accept a deal under which they would receive on average only 40 percent of their loans to Daewoo.</p>
        <p>''It's not just the government that wants to blame me,'' he said today.</p>
        <p>He said he did not expect the government's criticism to hurt his prospects for work in the future. ''I'll find something to do,'' he said.</p>
