        <p>There may a good story to be told onstage in the life of Tallulah Bankhead, the Alabama beauty who became one of the more notoriously dissolute divas of stage and screen. Let's hope so; this season will give us three different shows that purport to tell it, but the first of them, ''Tallulah Hallelujah!'', which opened at the Douglas Fairbanks Theater on West 42nd Street yesterday, is little more than an extended cabaret skit.</p>
        <p>The show serves as a vehicle for Tovah Feldshuh, who in addition to playing the title role wrote the script (with Larry Amoros and Linda Selman). Ms. Feldshuh, with her strong singing voice and aggressive stage manner, can be a commanding performer, and as Bankhead, a strong-willed star with a delicious larger-than-life self-regard, she would seem to be an apt casting match. But she hasn't given herself much to work with here. The script is long on smutty shtick meant to illustrate the naughty hedonism that made Bankhead, who died in 1968, a shocking character in a more uptight age, and short on anything deeper than the most pedestrian revelations about the sadness lurking beneath the celebrated facade.</p>

        <p>There may a good story to be told onstage in the life of Tallulah Bankhead, the Alabama beauty who became one of the more notoriously dissolute divas of stage and screen. Let's hope so; this season will give us three different shows that purport to tell it, but the first of them, ''Tallulah Hallelujah!'', which opened at the Douglas Fairbanks Theater on West 42nd Street yesterday, is little more than an extended cabaret skit.</p>
        <p>The show serves as a vehicle for Tovah Feldshuh, who in addition to playing the title role wrote the script (with Larry Amoros and Linda Selman). Ms. Feldshuh, with her strong singing voice and aggressive stage manner, can be a commanding performer, and as Bankhead, a strong-willed star with a delicious larger-than-life self-regard, she would seem to be an apt casting match. But she hasn't given herself much to work with here. The script is long on smutty shtick meant to illustrate the naughty hedonism that made Bankhead, who died in 1968, a shocking character in a more uptight age, and short on anything deeper than the most pedestrian revelations about the sadness lurking beneath the celebrated facade.</p>
        <p>The show is set in February 1956 in New York City, on the night of a benefit for the U.S.O. at which Bankhead is to introduce the evening's  main entertainment, Ella Fitzgerald. The great singer, however, has been stymied on her way to the city by flash flooding in New Haven, and Bankhead is left to entertain the troops on her own.</p>
        <p>It's a fictional setup, but the timing was chosen for its historical accuracy. The night before the purported U.S.O. show, Bankhead, then 54, opened on Broadway -- disastrously -- as Blanche in a revival of ''A Streetcar Named Desire,'' and the dreadful reviews figure in the meandering monologue that makes up the evening. Her other subjects include her adoring fans, her affection for Alfred Hitchcock (who directed her in ''Lifeboat'') and her resentment at not being taken seriously as an actress, though she's never too focused on anything to pass up an innuendo. (She admires the shape of the microphone; that's the cleverness level.) Most of the significant biographical detail -- Ah, Mom and Dad! Ah, innocence! -- is crammed into a maudlin reminiscence near the end. By that time, she's good and drunk.</p>
        <p>Wearing a full-length fur and too much lipstick, descending into the audience for flirtations -- front-row patrons are seated at tables with drinks on them -- Ms. Feldshuh is quite persuasive with Bankhead's sashaying bravado. As the evening proceeds, and the star, calling for bourbon, gets not-so-slowly pickled, the sashaying gets more pronounced; there's a fair amount of garter-flashing and at one point Ms. Feldshuh, impressively, does a cartwheel. She also does a nice job mimicking Bankhead's low-pitched tobacco-laced drawl -- ''Dahling!'' -- with its signature tinge of English accent. (Bankhead was a star in London before her breakthrough Broadway performance in 1939 in ''The Children's Hour.'') But without a substantive story, the appeal of the act has the longevity of television sketch. Bankhead's self-abasement isn't moving. It makes you squirm and tries your patience.</p>
        <p>On stage, Ms. Feldshuh is joined by Fitzgerald's pianist, Meredith Willson, represented here as a pleasantly blank accompanist by Bob Goldstone (yes, the songs from Willson's yet-to-open opus, ''The Music Man,'' figure in the show), who plays nicely behind the snippets of classic songs Ms. Feldshuh undertakes. But the music is an odd fit. Sometimes Ms. Feldshuh sings beautifully, sometimes with purposeful ineptitude, and though she sings badly very well, the effect is that she is flitting in and out of character. The only other character is a handsome soldier (Mark Deklin) who functions as a cocktail waiter and is the object of none-too-decent proposals.</p>
        <p>Willson utters one of his few lines in the show when a note is passed to Bankhead informing her that Fitzgerald has been delayed but still hopes to arrive. What to do in the meantime?</p>
        <p>''Vamp for five,'' Willson suggests.</p>
        <p>''Vamp for five?'' she says. ''I guess we could vamp for five. Though clothed and sober, it might be a stretch.''</p>
        <p>Be forewarned, in other words.</p>
        <p>TALLULAH HALLELUJAH!</p>
