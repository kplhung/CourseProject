        <p>New York State will receive $25 million out of the $255 million that six leading vitamin producers will pay to most states in the latest settlement of cases stemming from a decade-long international price-fixing scheme, the state's attorney general said yesterday.</p>

        <p>New York State will receive $25 million out of the $255 million that six leading vitamin producers will pay to most states in the latest settlement of cases stemming from a decade-long international price-fixing scheme, the state's attorney general said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The total settlement is divided into three parts: $118 million to 21 states for higher costs to consumers as a result of the price-fixing; $30 million to 47 states for higher charges the states themselves paid for vitamin products; and $107 million to businesses, like farms and retail stores, that were penalized by higher wholesale prices for products containing vitamins, a spokesman for Eliot Spitzer, the New York attorney general, said.</p>
        <p>The vitamins in the case ranged from pills to the vitamin blends used in products like milk, breakfast cereal and animal feed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Spitzer said that it was impossible to determine how much the antitrust activity cost consumers, indirectly through purchases of vitamin-fortified food and animal feed and directly through pill purchases. As a result, he said, New York will return $19 million of its share to the public through nonprofit groups and municipalities for programs dealing with prenatal care, child nutrition and hunger. The state will keep $6 million as compensation for the higher prices it paid for vitamin-containing products.</p>
        <p>Farmers and retail stores claiming damages are to file compensation claims with courts under procedures still to be announced.</p>
        <p>New Jersey was among the states not participating in the case, said Emily J. Hornaday, a spokeswoman for the antitrust unit of the state's Division of Criminal Justice. She declined to say why, other than that ''it was a decision we made after reviewing the matter.''</p>
        <p>Connecticut will receive $45,000 out of the $30 million pot for compensating states for their direct purchases of vitamin products, but will not receive any of the money that states are to distribute to the public for consumer overcharges. Connecticut law permits recovery by the state only for claims where the state itself was the purchaser, said Richard Blumenthal, that state's attorney general. But he added, ''We're continuing to explore other legal options.''</p>
        <p>Officials said that the six companies agreeing to make the payments were Hoffmann-La Roche, a unit of the Roche Group of Switzerland; BASF, based in Germany; Aventis of France; and three Japanese companies, Takeda, Eisai and Daiichi.</p>
        <p>Most of these companies settled a criminal antitrust case brought by the United States Justice Department by agreeing last year to pay a total of nearly $1 billion in fines, an amount the department said at the time represented the largest criminal fines in American history. And in another settlement that a federal judge approved in March, all the companies agreed to pay a total of $242 million to purchasers of bulk vitamins, including makers of food, beverages and animal feed.</p>
        <p>But in those settlements ''not one penny was to go to consumers,'' said the former Ohio senator, Howard Metzenbaum, now the chairman of the Consumer Federation of America, who appeared yesterday at a news conference in Mr. Spitzer's Manhattan office.</p>
