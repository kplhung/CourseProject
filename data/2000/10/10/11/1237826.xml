        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In his Oct. 4 column about price fairness and Amazon.com's charging different customers different amounts for the same products, Paul Krugman raises an interesting issue that is at the heart of all transactions in our new economy. The idea is to charge the maximum price that the individual or the market at large can bear without any regard to the cost of production or ''fairness.''</p>
        <p>The dictum is in evidence from health care (different prices for different patients for the same procedures and drugs, depending on who is paying for it) to automobiles to open bidding for public and private contracts. Further, even if cost was a consideration for pricing, the relevant cost is debatable -- should it be based on full cost, marginal cost or life-cycle cost?</p>

        <p>Finally, fairness is arbitrary as well: Fair to the buyer, the seller or society?</p>
