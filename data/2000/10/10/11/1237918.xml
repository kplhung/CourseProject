        <p>President Clinton sent his top trade negotiator to Beijing today to warn China that its efforts to back away from crucial trade concessions threatened the trading rights that it won after a prolonged fight in Congress.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton sent Charlene Barshefsky, the United States trade representative, on her mission on the same day that he signed into law the legislation to grant China permanent normal trade relations, the culmination of 14 years of negotiations and a protracted struggle on Capitol Hill.</p>
        <p>But even as administration officials and bipartisan Congressional leaders gathered on the White House lawn to hail what they called China's integration into the world economy, American officials acknowledged that China was slipping on pledges to open its markets that it had made as part of its efforts to join the World Trade Organization.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton -- or his successor, if the negotiations drag into next year -- has to certify to Congress that China joins the trade organization on the terms that the United States negotiated before the new legislation goes into effect.</p>
        <p>The negotiating battleground for the final terms of W.T.O. admission is the organization headquarters in Geneva. But as they worked through the final details with American, European and other trade officials, China has balked at several of the most politically sensitive concessions that it made in negotiations with Ms. Barshefsky last year, people involved with the talks said.</p>
        <p>In particular, China is now insisting that it should be treated like other poor nations when it comes to overhauling the way it manages its industries, meaning that it would have more time to eliminate subsidies and trade barriers that it uses to support its farmers and to protect sensitive state-run industries like automobiles.</p>
        <p>The United States has long insisted -- and has repeatedly stressed that Beijing has agreed -- that China, because of its size and trading power, will not be allowed to join the organization under the preferential terms given to some developing countries.</p>
        <p>In recent weeks, China has also announced new rules to limit foreign investment in the Internet and telecommunications industries, restrictions that some officials say contradict pledges to the United States and other countries.</p>
        <p>The impasse poses a particularly acute problem for Vice President Al Gore, who supported granting China permanent normal trading rights over vociferous objections from unions, environmentalists and other core political supporters. Signs that China is backtracking means that ensuring compliance with the trade accord could become a problem for the next administration, keeping alive an issue that Mr. Gore had hoped was behind him.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's campaign chairman, William M. Daley, stood behind Mr. Clinton as he signed the legislation. Mr. Daley played a central role in winning passage of the bill before he resigned as commerce secretary to become Mr. Gore's chief strategist.</p>
        <p>As he often did while pressing Congress to approve the accord, Mr. Clinton hailed passage of permanent normal trade relations as vital for a ''safer, more integrated world.'' But he also warned that China had to adhere to its promises if it is to receive normal trade status, ending the often contentious annual reviews that it has faced since the early 80's.</p>
        <p>''I guess I ought to point out that our work is not over when I sign this bill,'' Mr. Clinton said in a veiled acknowledgement that parts of the accord remained unsettled. ''For China still must complete its W.T.O. accession negotiations and live up to the agreements it has negotiated with us and our partners.''</p>
        <p>Final negotiations paving the way for China to join the trade group have been bogging down in Geneva for weeks. European negotiators complain that China is retreating from the pace and the details of some market-opening commitments. Chinese officials also say negotiations have stalled, but fault Western officials for changing the rules to pry 11th-hour concessions from Beijing.</p>
        <p>Officials here said barring a major shift in China's negotiating strategy, it now appears unlikely to complete the process of joining the World Trade Organization this year. That means that the crowning achievement of Mr. Clinton's drive to transform China into a full trading partner would not occur in his term in office.</p>
        <p>Some supporters of bringing China into the trade group said they worried that Chinese bureaucrats and business leaders were fighting some liberalization measures that Chinese leaders had pledged to institute.</p>
        <p>''The reality seems to be sinking in in China of what it is they agreed to,'' said Senator Max Baucus, a Montana Democrat who was one of the bill's strongest supporters. ''This will be a test of their leadership, to go the next step and persuade the powers that be there to implement this.''</p>
        <p>China's bid has taken so long in part because its negotiators often seek to reopen issues that American officials consider settled, hoping to extract advantages at each stage of the process. One American official said Beijing's backtracking amounts to a similar tactic, not a rethinking of its willingness to open its markets.</p>
        <p>The Geneva talks will dictate the pace and extent of the voluminous but sometimes vague concessions China made to the United States, the European Union and other nations. The bilateral accords that Beijing reached with those countries are being merged into a single agreement on China's entry to the W.T.O.</p>
        <p>The issues include a detailed regimen for reducing tariffs, removing trade barriers, rewriting regulations and adjudicating disputes, in effect translating China's paper promises into reality before it receives the prize of membership.</p>
        <p>Shortly after the White House signing ceremony, Ms. Barshefsky left for Beijing to meet Prime Minister Zhu Rongji. Her mission is aimed at breaking a stalemate in the Geneva talks.</p>
        <p>''China now has to demonstrate commercially meaningful implementation of this agreement,'' Ms. Barshefsky said. ''The speed of this is largely up to China.''</p>
