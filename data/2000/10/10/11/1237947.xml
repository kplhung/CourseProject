        <p>The cost of natural gas will increase at least $200 to $225 a year for more than two million New Jersey customers under new emergency rates approved today by the state's regulatory agency.</p>
        <p>The agency, the Board of Public Utilities, granted immediate increases of 16 percent to Public Service Electric and Gas, the state's largest natural gas supplier, with 1.6 million customers, and the New Jersey Natural Gas Company, which has about 400,000 customers. A third company, the Elizabethtown Gas Company, which has 250,000 customers, was granted an increase of 17.3 percent.</p>
        <p>A fourth company, South Jersey Gas Company, had also sought an increase, but the board did not address the request because the company had not yet held public hearings on the proposal.</p>
        <p>If the sharp rise in wholesale natural gas prices throughout the country  continues, the three companies that were granted increases will be allowed to raise their charges by an extra 2 percent each month from December to April.</p>
        <p>If the three companies tack on the monthly increments, customers will see increases of at least 25 percent in their gas bills by the spring. The three companies had sought increases of roughly that amount in their emergency requests on Oct. 3.</p>
        <p>Natural gas customers in New York City and surrounding counties face similar increases this winter, utility officials said today. Both Keyspan Energy, which serves 1.6 million customers in Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island and Long Island, and Con Edison, which has about 220,000 residential gas customers in Manhattan, the Bronx and Westchester County, said they expected 25 percent rate increases unless the winter was milder than anticipated or wholesale prices dropped.</p>
        <p>At the moment, only Connecticut's natural gas customers seem spared from steep rate increases, apparently because the state's utilities have stored abundant supplies of gas that were purchased before wholesale prices spiked upward.</p>
        <p>New Jersey's new rate increases were negotiated in a series of meetings by officials of the utilities board, the three companies and New Jersey's consumer watchdog agency, the Division of Ratepayer Advocate.</p>
        <p>After the three-member regulatory board voted unanimously today to approve the increases, all the parties seemed pleased. The board president, Herbert H. Tate, said the three sides had decided to make the increases incremental to prevent  ''rate shock'' for consumers.</p>
        <p>Blossom A. Peretz, New Jersey's ratepayer advocate, said: ''I'm never happy to see rates go up. But in light of what's happening nationwide and worldwide with gas prices, I'm pleased.''</p>
        <p>Before the vote, Mr. Tate said wholesale prices for New Jersey's gas utilities had increased by as much as 150 percent since last winter, prompting their petitions for emergency relief.</p>
        <p>The board based its increases on the typical residential gas customer, which it defined as a household using an average of 100 therms of natural gas a month, or 1,200 over a year.</p>
        <p>P.S.E.&amp; G. said its a monthly bill for 100 therms would rise to $81.20 from $70. New Jersey Natural Gas said its monthly bill would jump to $95.87 from $82.87. And Elizabethtown Gas said its bill would go to $95.35 from $82.80.</p>
        <p>None of those new rates include the 2 percent monthly increments. The assistant director of the board's energy division, George Riepe, said that a 100-therm-a-month customer would pay $200 to $225 more a year under the overall increases.</p>
        <p>In the requests filed on Oct. 3, P.S.E.&amp; G. had sought an increase of 24 percent; New Jersey Natural Gas, 16 percent; and Elizabethtown, from 17.3 to 29.9 percent, the board said.</p>
        <p>Both board officials and Ms. Peretz urged gas customers to take steps to conserve energy, including installing insulation in attics and weather-stripping around windows.</p>
        <p>New Jersey law allows utility companies to pass along their wholesale gas costs to customers on a dollar-for-dollar basis, without any markup. But the state's utility board must approve the increase.</p>
        <p>As part of today's decision, the 2 percent increments for December and January were approved outright. But the increments for February, March and April could be eliminated or reduced if the utilities fail in January hearings to show a continued increase in wholesale costs.</p>
        <p>New York's regulatory agency, the Public Service Commission, also allows gas utilities to pass along wholesale costs. The commission monitors any monthly increases, and can order rate reductions if there are unjustified increases, said a spokesman, Edward Collins. Unlike New Jersey's utility board, New York's does not approve increases before gas companies institute them.</p>
        <p>Like New Jersey, Connecticut requires preapproval of emergency increases to pass along higher wholesale costs. But sharply higher gas prices do not seem to be on the horizon in Connecticut.</p>
        <p>Connecticut gas companies have not asked for rate increases, and prices for residential customers are expected to rise only slightly as a result of the expected increases in wholesale gas prices later in the winter, said Beryl Lyons, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Public Utility Control.</p>
        <p>Although the natural gas industry has been deregulated for commercial customers in Connecticut, rates for residential gas service are still controlled by the state. At a meeting in August, the state's three gas companies all reported that they had sufficient stocks to supply a normal winter.</p>
        <p>''They have their storage tanks pretty well full,'' Ms. Lyons said. ''So assuming a normal winter, they would only be buying a small percentage of gas on what is known as the spot market.''</p>
        <p>Under state law, any increase in spot market prices, or prices for short-term purchases, would be passed on to customers as an adjustment to their monthly bills.</p>
        <p>In the event of price spikes on the spot market, the state's three gas companies -- The Southern Connecticut Gas Company, Connecticut Natural Gas Corporation and Yankee Gas Service Company -- would have to document their increased costs to the state for permission to adjust customers' bills.</p>
        <p>Changes in the actual residential gas rates require state approval and  a lengthy application process that often takes more than six months, Ms. Lyons said. The process involves hearings and testimony by energy industry experts to document the need for a rate change.</p>
