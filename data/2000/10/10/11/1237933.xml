        <p>Blatantly deceptive corporate front groups like the ones described in your article are the worst examples, but the work of other, seemingly independent organizations may be influenced by corporate contributors as well.</p>
        <p>Your article reminds consumers, reporters and policy makers to ask these groups: Where does your financing come from, and what financial stake do your supporters have in the positions that you take?</p>
