        <p>When Vice President Al Gore talks about what he would like to do for Americans who have no medical insurance if he is elected president, he more or less suggests that the nation become just like New York State.</p>
        <p>New York created a program called Child Health Plus, to insure children whose families made too much to qualify for Medicaid but could not afford private insurance, long before the federal government devised just such a plan in 1997. New York has also already taken steps to extend that program to the parents of many of these children, something else Mr. Gore proposes. And the state does something with its program that most states have avoided: it insures children of illegal immigrants with a special pool of nonfederal cash.</p>
        <p>Most states, in fact, have failed to insure many children at all -- 40 states are in danger of having to forfeit the money the federal government gave them in 1997 under the Children's Health Insurance Program.</p>
        <p>But being on the cutting edge has brought difficulties as well. New York is now being forced to move hundreds of thousands of the 550,000 children enrolled in its much-promoted program into Medicaid to comply with federal standards that it managed to skirt for the last several years. The state insists it has a plan to make this transition seamless, yet there are fears among children's advocates that some children will fall through the cracks.</p>
        <p>The growing pains of New York's program and the failures of other states to get one off the ground demonstrate the difficulties states face when the federal government writes broad policy about health care, provides the money and then tells the the states to carry it out as they wish. This incremental, federalist approach, which some children's advocates resisted, was in part born out of the political failure of the federal health plan proposed by Hillary Rodham Clinton in the early 1990's.</p>
        <p>''I think this way was politically necessary, even if it may not have been the best way to go about it,'' said Robert I. Field, the director of the graduate program on health policy at the University of the Sciences in Philadelphia, speaking of the state-by-state approach. Under this approach, he said, ''states that were not serious about children's health insurance will not have a program and those that were will.''</p>
        <p>''From a national perspective it doesn't do us much good,'' Professor Field added, ''especially with California and Texas having so many uninsured. But there is the expression, 'Politics is the art of the possible,' and it had to be done this way to show that this wasn't just another federal intrusion.''</p>
        <p>Differences in state programs abound. While 26 states simply decided to expand their Medicaid programs with the added federal aid, others came up with totally new concepts for children. Still others settled on a combination.</p>
        <p>States are also critical of some of the federal government's rules, like putting a 10 percent cap on how much of the federal money could be used for administrative costs, which include all-important outreach through schools and community organizations. Many also question how Washington came up with its formulas for how much each state got.</p>
        <p>Under New York's original program, which started in 1991, families who qualified for Medicaid and Child Health Plus were allowed to choose which one they would enroll their children in. Given the option, many went for Child Health Plus, even though they would have to pay a modest premium, and though the benefits could sometimes be less generous.</p>
        <p>The reasons were fairly straightforward: Medicaid, while free, had a cumbersome enrollment process that required a face-to-face interview and reams of paperwork; Child Health Plus did not. Medicaid also carried a stigma that Child Health Plus seems not to.</p>
        <p>But when New York began to receive federal matching money for its program, the rules became abundantly clear: no child who qualified for Medicaid could be enrolled in the Child Health Plus program.</p>
        <p>This presented a problem: Tell families who wanted to be in the new program that they would have to go to Medicaid and risk losing them, or enroll them in the program anyway and shuttle them into Medicaid once they had created a process to do so in a way that would keep children from losing coverage.</p>
        <p>New York opted for the latter, and is now forced to transfer children into Medicaid for Child Health Plus. ''Looking back, this was the dilemma we all knew would happen,'' said Melinda Dutton, a senior policy specialist at the Children's Defense Fund in New York. ''We had to have a unified system, but things never happen as quickly as you want. But we knew if we stopped enrolling them in Child Health Plus right then, they would not get any coverage.''</p>
        <p>Many health policy experts contend that other states would be lucky to have New York's problem. Almost every state in the country has failed to spend its federal allotment, because, among myriad issues, they have local governments that are hostile to the program or have simply been unable to get their programs together. Most states lack the community outreach needed to let families know about the program; New York marketed Child Health Plus vigorously.</p>
        <p>''I think the New York State department did the right thing,'' said Dr. Michael A. Stocker, president and chief executive of Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield, even though his company will now lose roughly half the 96,000 children it enrolled into Child Health Plus to Medicaid. The unknown fact, he conceded, ''is what is going to happen in the migration.''</p>
        <p>The State Department of Health is critical of companies like Empire that do not participate in Medicaid, and some policy experts have suggested that any insurance company that wants to insure children should be forced by state law to participate in both Child Health Plus and Medicaid. ''They are putting profits before the needs of children,'' said John F. Signor, a department spokesman.</p>
        <p>New York says it finally has its system in place to transfer children seamlessly, a claim some advocates and policy experts question. It now has a single application to enroll children in Medicaid or Child Health Plus; indeed, both programs are now called Child Health Plus, in part to remove the Medicaid stigma. Further, the state's Department of Health has hired community organizations and other groups to help people enroll or make the transition.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, health care policy experts argue, some people will still refuse Medicaid. Other plans, like Empire, will not participate in Medicaid, no matter what New York wants to call the program.</p>
        <p>While insurance companies can market a Child Health Plus program, Medicaid insurance programs are not allowed to contact recipients directly. And often children in the same family belong in different plans, because some benefits are tied to age.</p>
        <p>''This is a very fragmented process,'' said Dr. Irwin Redlener, president of Children's Hospital at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx. ''It should not be up to the family to figure out who the payer is. What New York is doing is very good, but the problem is children already enrolled may suffer a gap.''</p>
        <p>David Sandman, a program officer at the Commonwealth Fund, a private philanthropic organization, sees a silver lining: ''For every child that leaves Child Health Plus and goes to Medicaid, it opens up a new spot for a new child.''</p>
