        <p>THE shelves of software stores are crowded with programs that put you in command of an F-15 fighter, a submarine or a tank. But how about a Taurus or a Camry?</p>
        <p>Leaving aside mow-'em-down, smash-'em-up race games, there are only a small number of training programs for that most common of activities, driving. The computer has not emerged as a teaching tool, even as more states toughen the requirements for young people obtaining a license, with extended periods of ''provisional'' licensing or rules that require people with learner permits to log 20 or 30 hours with an older driver before they can take a road test.</p>
        <p>But three serious programs are on the market, two produced by the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety, an affiliate of the American Automobile Association. The AAA programs, called Driver-ZED (the last three letters stand for zero errors driving), include one for teenagers and another for experienced drivers. Driver-ZED is geared toward improving the ability to spot hazards and think ahead.</p>
        <p>The third program is a commercial project, Driver's Education '99, sold by Sierra Online, a producer of dozens of popular game programs among young people. The Sierra offering is far more comprehensive than the AAA programs, with practical hints like how many forms of identification are generally required by a motor vehicle department to get a license.</p>
        <p>Somehow, I turned all three into smash-'em-up games, although at the end I scored well on the AAA program. My two teenage children, in the target market, did no better, a result that left my ego satisfied but hardly calmed my fears as they inch closer to driving themselves.</p>
        <p>But can such programs help?</p>
        <p>Expert opinion is divided. At the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the insurance-industry-financed group in Arlington, Va., which is known for its tough crash tests and ''five-star ratings'' for cars that do well, Julie Rochman, a spokeswoman, was emphatic about whether the programs prevent crashes.</p>
        <p>''Purely from a safety perspective, no, they don't,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Such programs could ''probably help you learn something about the driving environment,'' she said; even for adults, ''it doesn't hurt to have a refresher.''</p>
        <p>The Insurance Institute thinks even flesh-and-blood driver education programs do not have a safety benefit.</p>
        <p>''There has never been a study in this country or any other country that shows there is a reduction in crashes as a result of taking driver training,'' Ms. Rochman said. The way to learn to drive, she said, is to drive.</p>
        <p>But the nonprofit AAA foundation, itself an authority on traffic safety, put $750,000 into developing its programs, and reports that they are selling briskly. The Sierra program carries an endorsement from a Utah state trooper, and was developed with the assistance of Mothers Against Drunk Driving.</p>
        <p>The two AAA Driver-ZED programs are described as ''interactive risk-management training.'' Both use full-motion video, making the computer screen resemble a television set. The teenage version includes a hip crew of young actors, with fashionably baggy clothes and the appropriate body piercings, but the content is the same, with three sessions of about 45 minutes each.</p>
        <p>''Driver-ZED is designed to be tough, even for experienced drivers like yourself,'' says a narrator with a soothing voice in the adult version. The authors apparently thought, probably correctly, that adults would be  interested in the scoring system.</p>
        <p>The program is controlled with a mouse, and involves scanning a scene for crucial details or making quick decisions. For example, as the computer screen shows a scene through the window, the rearview mirror and the side-view mirror, a car suddenly backs out of a driveway up ahead. The user clicks to freeze the action, and is given three choices: slow down and get ready to stop, swerve left or give it gas.</p>
        <p>I chose to stop. ''That's pretty risky,'' says the narrator. ''You made a smart decision a little too late.''</p>
        <p>IN another scene, the action freezes and the narrator asks how fast the car was going. I guessed 30 miles an hour; it was 20. In a third sequence, a car is turning left ahead of the car ''driven'' by the program user. But the first car stops when a pedestrian, crossing the street, has dropped papers and stooped to retrieve them. The program user's car, stuck in midlane, is then creamed by oncoming traffic.</p>
        <p>The AAA program is a lot to keep track of, even if the only control is the mouse. Sometimes the action abruptly disappears and you are asked to recall the color of a traffic light up ahead or the speed shown on the virtual speedometer. I got the color right but lost a point for having no idea of my speed: I'd been fixated on a traffic signal. Driving is what psychologists call a ''divided attention task,'' and the program proves it.</p>
        <p>The teenage version congratulates the user for making decisions that avoid crashes, but then, just for fun, plays the sound of squealing tires, smashing glass and crunching metal and shattering glass, and shows the crackup that would have happened. The idea is not to give young players the incentive to do the wrong thing just to see the crash.</p>
        <p>I am partial to the AAA program because I earned  bonus points and finished with a perfect score, despite some errors. I had little trouble with the written sections of the Sierra program, which asked questions like, what fraction of fatal accidents are caused by driver error, as opposed to bad weather or mechanical problems? (The tutorial says it is 85 percent.) But I tried the first road test eight times, failing all, once by putting the car into ''park'' while it was moving, and once, in my most spectacular screw-up, hitting an ambulance. ''I hope your parents have insurance,'' intoned the narrator, a Max Headroom character named Driver Ed. I may be unlicensable. (Please don't tell the State of Maryland, which issued me a license, or my insurance company.)</p>
        <p>DRIVER'S EDUCATION '99 is a true simulation, with computer-generated cars and trucks and street scenes. Seat-belt buckling, engine start, turn signals, acceleration, braking and control of the steering wheel are all handled through a keyboard. So is releasing the parking brake and shifting gears. Do them in the wrong order and the computer marks you down. Combined with the difficulty in remembering which key does what, it left me flustered. Even my 14-year-old son, a veteran of every space invaders' program ever written, took awhile to master this one.</p>
        <p>Driver Ed, the narrator, gives feedback that runs from encouraging to sarcastic. Turn the starter key while the car is already running, and Mr. Ed says sharply, ''Hey, this is a new car.'' Keep the car in the proper lane at a reasonable speed and he says warmly, ''You've done this before, haven't you?'' Stop short, and the tires squeal while the nose of the car dips, just as in a real car. Take a corner too slowly, and you get rear-ended.</p>
        <p>I suffered several crackups in ''Virtual City,'' the lesson track. Impressively, the road map stays the same each time you run the course, but the traffic changes. The ambulance that I hit on my second try, by making a turn too wide, appeared on a different street on my third attempt.</p>
        <p>Driver's Education '99, about $30, is available in software stores, through www.sierra.com or by calling (800) 757-7707. The AAA Driver-ZED teenage program is $27.95 plus shipping, from www.driverzed.org; the adult version is $95 and can be ordered through the foundation's Web site, www.aaafts.org. Both AAA programs can also be ordered by calling (800) 305-7233. The three programs will keep separate scores for multiple users.</p>
        <p>Are they worth the price?</p>
        <p>I compared notes with another adult who had spent a few hours on Driver's Education '99.</p>
        <p>''I smashed into just about every darn thing,'' she said. ''It seems to have as much relationship to driving as Pac-Man does to eating.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps. But while Pac-Man will never improve anyone's eating, Driver's Education and Driver-ZED at least have the potential to help with driving. And in their own way, they are much more interesting.</p>
