      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial on responses by Rick Lazio and Hillary Rodham Clinton in recent debate challenge to define a New Yorker; says Mrs Clinton's reference to author E B White could trouble some important constituents if they read White closely; says that although White wrote eloquently about how newcomers give New York its energy and incomparable achievements, he also spoke scathingly about suburbs, which are home to thousands of swing voters</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>One of the better moments in Sunday's debate between Hillary Rodham Clinton and Rick Lazio has somehow been lost in a small furor over whether Gov. George Pataki had ever heard of E. B. White. Mr. Pataki's clumsy effort to mock Mrs. Clinton, who mentioned the essayist and children's book writer in the debate, has landed him in a great deal of well-deserved trouble with lovers of Mr. White's work, ranging from ''Charlotte's Web'' to ''The Elements of Style'' to ''Here Is New York,'' his 1949 ode to New York City.</p>
        <p>The stir about Mr. White, or ''Mr. Wyatt,'' as the governor referred to him dismissively, has somewhat obscured the reason this revered writer's name came up in the first place. The candidates had been challenged at that point with a most burdensome task -- to define a New Yorker. The responses by Mrs. Clinton, who moved to the state a year ago to run for the Senate, and Mr. Lazio, who was born on Long Island in 1958, served less to define all New Yorkers than to define these two particular New Yorkers. The newcomer and the native stood at opposite ends of the range in this state, two separate designs in what Mrs. Clinton called ''this wonderful patchwork quilt of a place.''</p>

        <p>One of the better moments in Sunday's debate between Hillary Rodham Clinton and Rick Lazio has somehow been lost in a small furor over whether Gov. George Pataki had ever heard of E. B. White. Mr. Pataki's clumsy effort to mock Mrs. Clinton, who mentioned the essayist and children's book writer in the debate, has landed him in a great deal of well-deserved trouble with lovers of Mr. White's work, ranging from ''Charlotte's Web'' to ''The Elements of Style'' to ''Here Is New York,'' his 1949 ode to New York City.</p>
        <p>The stir about Mr. White, or ''Mr. Wyatt,'' as the governor referred to him dismissively, has somewhat obscured the reason this revered writer's name came up in the first place. The candidates had been challenged at that point with a most burdensome task -- to define a New Yorker. The responses by Mrs. Clinton, who moved to the state a year ago to run for the Senate, and Mr. Lazio, who was born on Long Island in 1958, served less to define all New Yorkers than to define these two particular New Yorkers. The newcomer and the native stood at opposite ends of the range in this state, two separate designs in what Mrs. Clinton called ''this wonderful patchwork quilt of a place.''</p>
        <p>While there was some overlap -- both paid dutiful heed to New York's diversity, for example -- Mrs. Clinton generally tried to soar into the lyrical while Mr. Lazio aimed for solid ground. She talked about being drawn as if by a magnet to New York, being challenged ''to do the best with your life you can do. . . .'' Mr. Lazio went the bricks-and-mortar route, praising the building of the Empire State Building and adding that New Yorkers are no-nonsense people who ''don't want to hear a lot of stories and talk.'' She spoke like one of Mr. White's new immigrants, the gamblers who are ''willing to be lucky,'' as he wrote. Mr. Lazio was in the odd position of praising New York as a melting pot even as he and Mr. Pataki challenged Mrs. Clinton's right to jump into it.</p>
        <p>On the whole, the first lady's answer bolstered her reason for coming to New York, but her literary reference could trouble some important constituents if they read Mr. White closely. Although he wrote eloquently about how newcomers give New York its energy and incomparable achievements, the author did not look so kindly on commuters, comparing them to locusts swarming into the city, each escaping a suburb with ''no essential vitality of its own.'' As both the old and new New Yorkers now realize, particularly if they are questing for higher office, today's suburbs contain at least one political essential -- thousands of swing votes.</p>
