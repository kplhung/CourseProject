        <p>When NBC's ''Today'' announced that it was expanding to three hours from two, it looked like potential trouble for Regis Philbin, whose morning talk show already seemed to be in jeopardy because it would have to meet the fall without its perky co-host, Kathie Lee Gifford (who left the program in July).</p>
        <p>But ''Live With Regis'' seems to be doing just fine in the face of the new competition from Matt Lauer and Katie Couric of ''Today'' on NBC, which has ruled morning television for the last six years (at least from 7 a.m. to 9 a.m.)</p>
        <p>Last week, the first week in which it was shown against the expanded ''Today,'' ''Live With Regis'' beat its NBC competitor in the ratings by 37 percent in the 36 cities where they now go head to head from 9 a.m. to 10 a.m.</p>
        <p>Even Mr. Philbin, who is also the host of ABC's runaway smash hit game show, ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,'' sounded impressed.</p>
        <p>''We're like a runaway beer truck, running downhill,'' he said in an interview.</p>
        <p>Still, NBC pointed out, its third hour of ''Today'' is up 41 percent in the ratings compared with the show it replaced, ''Later Today.'' And, a spokeswoman said that ''Today'' did not extend its hours with the intent of stealing viewers from ''Live With Regis.''</p>
        <p>Of course, it is still early and things have plenty of time to change.</p>
        <p>While there is no indication of who will ultimately replace Ms. Gifford at Mr. Philbin's side -- since she left there has been a parade of guest hosts -- maybe this all proves he does not need a regular co-host anyway.</p>
