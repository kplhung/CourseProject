        <p>SOME people think that when they buy a collectible car, they're making an investment, that the car will appreciate over time like a first-growth Bordeaux. Don't count on it.</p>
        <p>Ten years ago, I bought a 1972 Buick Riviera, one of the boat tails, a two-door hardtop with a rear end tapering to a point. Mine was a one-owner California car with 69,000 miles, tired paint but a good interior. I paid $5,000 and drove it back to New York.</p>

        <p>SOME people think that when they buy a collectible car, they're making an investment, that the car will appreciate over time like a first-growth Bordeaux. Don't count on it.</p>
        <p>Ten years ago, I bought a 1972 Buick Riviera, one of the boat tails, a two-door hardtop with a rear end tapering to a point. Mine was a one-owner California car with 69,000 miles, tired paint but a good interior. I paid $5,000 and drove it back to New York.</p>
        <p>Since then, I have spent $26,381.74. That includes the car's cost, transportation to the East Coast, garage rent, repairs, a paint job, new tires, dues to old-car clubs and subscriptions to magazines for collectors.</p>
        <p>The car is now in reasonable shape, not perfect, but good enough to win a bronze award -- third place -- in its class at the Buick Club of America's national show in Richmond, Va., in July. So what's the Riviera worth now? Between $6,000 and $7,000, by some estimates. Or less, by others.</p>
        <p>Whatever the case, this obviously hasn't been a great investment if measured by conventional standards. But if measured in fun and camaraderie, it compares favorably with the best of the blue chips.</p>
        <p>Happy motoring.</p>
