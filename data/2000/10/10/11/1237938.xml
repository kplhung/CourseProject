        <p>As Chinese provinces go, Hunan has few natural advantages. A landlocked square, it lacks the cosmopolitan muscle of the coast, the prosperity of its southern neighbors, the exotic minority cultures of China's west.</p>
        <p>True, Mao came from Hunan, but that does not gain you much capital in the year 2000. Today this sleepy provincial capital's most famous product is chou dofu, or ''stinking soybean curd,'' an aptly named fermented and fried specialty. Hunan has not had much to crow about in recent years.</p>
        <p>And that is probably why officials here did not interfere too much when a snappy, risque television station rose like an improbable phoenix three years ago amid the dilapidated buildings of the Hunan Broadcast Bureau.</p>
        <p>And today Hunan Satellite TV is by almost all measures the most successful television station in China, popular for its chatty, straightforward news and talk shows, its dating games and its riotous Saturday night variety program that encourages distinguished movie stars to get in touch with their inner child.</p>
        <p>Although Hunan Satellite TV is government-owned, like all stations in China, it has broken out of the state television mold. And stations across China are scrambling to follow.</p>
        <p>''Twenty years ago, China was a planned economy and we were just a propaganda mouthpiece,'' said Wei Wenbin, who founded the station and was recently promoted to director of the Hunan Provincial Broadcast and Television Bureau. ''If the government said pay attention to this or that, we did. But China has been reforming for 20 years, and now, finally, the media are starting to reform too.''</p>
        <p>Even though it is received by subscription only, Hunan Satellite TV boasts 200 million viewers in China. Its Saturday evening prime time advertising rates, which have more than doubled this year, are now the highest for any television station in China, surpassing even the main national network, CCTV-1. In faraway Beijing, hotel billboards now brag, ''We have Hunan Satellite TV.''</p>
        <p>It is in many ways the triumph of the market over propaganda: as government financing of the media has dwindled during China's move toward a market economy, stations have had to learn to entertain audiences to attract advertisers. And government regulators have had to bend rules to allow them to compete.</p>
        <p>''We came to see that even in an inland province, we could get a national response so long as we were willing to break with the past, to change our ideas and to be brave -- even taking things to extremes,'' said Liu Yiping, the head of the station's Communist Party committee, wearing a trendy dark collarless shirt and jeans.</p>
        <p>Hunan Satellite TV has certainly gone about as far as the media can go in today's China, a country where all newspapers, magazines and radio and television stations still ultimately belong to the government and formally operate under the Communist Party's propaganda department.</p>
        <p>The station's nightly news generally bypasses the endless trips by China's leaders to inspect factories or farms -- the fodder of most state broadcasts -- and instead features investigative pieces on aggrieved peasants, for example, or quirky human interest stories, like the recent three-part series on the search for U.F.O.'s in the western deserts of Qinghai Province.</p>
        <p>''I can't stand traditional news broadcasts, where there can be a lot of empty words and even falsehoods,'' said Pan Liping, the producer who masterminded the change. ''So I've always believed that good news has to be true and credible, even if it shows problems and flaws.</p>
        <p>''And it has to be lively, too. It has to make you sit up and notice.''</p>
        <p>The station's teen programs discuss the trials of adolescence. On the station's popular Saturday night variety show, ''Fun Camp,'' the 20-something hosts banter like hip reincarnations of Regis and Kathie Lee. They play practical jokes and force celebrity guests to compete in silly games.</p>
        <p>''Most traditional variety shows try to be artistic, but on our show we try to be more relaxed and intimate,'' said Yi Hua, 29, the producer of ''Fun Camp.''</p>
        <p>''People get to make fools of themselves,'' he said. The program includes celebrity interviews, ''Candid Camera'' type segments, singing and games.</p>
        <p>In honor of the Sydney Olympics, for example, the show invited four pop stars to the studio to jog on treadmills that were hooked up to a Rube Goldberg-like gizmo that blew up balloons.</p>
        <p>It's a far cry from the conventional state television variety program, which typically features booming announcers, staged songs and hundreds of synchronized dancers. If ''Survivor'' ever comes to China, it will most likely land here.</p>
        <p>Because Hunan Satellite TV has acquired a certain mystique, pop stars are willing to fly here to the hinterland and producers reject job offers in bigger cities.</p>
        <p>''Our leaders at every rung are different,'' said Ms. Yi, dressed in black jeans, T-shirt and silver earrings. ''There are no limits on breaking the mold. And I've often thought about why it happened in this closed-off, not very developed place. I think the cultural tradition of Hunan has always encouraged innovation and testing limits. Remember, Mao's from here.''</p>
        <p>At first, national and local officials alike criticized the station's renegade style. Ms. Yi said she got angry glares when she attended national meetings from officials who thought she was too young to be there.</p>
        <p>And a certain official testiness remains. Earlier this year, in a article about the declining income of CCTV-1, China Business Times noted that the main government television station's revenues were ''under attack from the Hunan warlord army.''</p>
        <p>But in today's China, nothing succeeds like financial success. And Hunan Satellite TV's annual revenues, in the tens of millions of dollars, have helped bring naysayers around.</p>
        <p>''In the beginning there was lots of controversy about this news style, but because of the strong audience reaction across the country, because of the letters and phone calls, because we are in demand, the more traditional thinkers around here have begun to change their minds,'' Mr. Pan said.</p>
        <p>Indeed, income from Hunan Satellite TV now accounts for more than 60 percent of the Provincial Broadcast Bureau's earnings. And with those earnings it has paid for a glistening new headquarters (shaped like an H for Hunan) filled with the latest digital equipment, new apartments for employees, a luxury resort hotel, an aquarium and a Disneyland-like amusement park.</p>
        <p>Still, Hunan Satellite TV must live with certain limits, especially regarding its news programs, which address issues like corruption and pollution but cannot report freely on sensitive topics that touch the top leaders.</p>
        <p>Producers insist that there is no need for active outside censorship -- after years of experience they know where the boundaries lie. And Mr. Wei said that despite government ownership, his station had attained a good measure of independence.</p>
        <p>''In a sense we're already separate in that these days the government rarely intervenes in television and controls it in that way,'' he said. ''In the past, television was part of a government bureaucracy, but now it's more of a commercial endeavor.''</p>
        <p>Still, it is certainly a strange hybrid -- a company of the party's propaganda department with shares on the stock market, obsessed with ratings and audience response.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wei says he does not foresee -- or want to see -- private stations in China for a long time and he is comfortable with the current amalgam. And investors seem to be as well. M. H. Jiang, the son of President Jiang Zemin, has been buying stakes in satellite television stations, most of them Hunan Satellite TV wannabes -- a sure sign that they have a lucrative future.</p>
