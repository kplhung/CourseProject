        <p>Lorenza Oliva gave a simple reason for being on strike along with 250 other Fairfield County janitors: she cannot make ends meet earning $6.15 an hour and working 20 hours a week.</p>
        <p>''The reason we're on strike is we need more money,'' said Ms. Oliva, an immigrant from Guatemala who said she was able to pay her $1,350-a-month rent only with the help of her brother.</p>
        <p>Last Wednesday about 50 janitors in Stamford and nearby communities began a walkout against their employers, the contractors that clean commercial buildings. The strike has since quintupled in size and, union officials said, will expand to 500 workers by this weekend and to almost 1,000 by the end of next week.</p>
        <p>Officials with the union that has organized the strike, the Service Employees International Union, said strikers might resort to civil disobedience, including blocking streets, if no agreement is reached soon.</p>
        <p>''We're in one of the wealthiest counties of America,'' Stephen Lerner, a union official, said at a news conference at the Stamford train station. ''In this time of incredible wealth, the people who keep these buildings clean for the rich and powerful should earn enough that they can pay their rent and feed their families.''</p>
        <p>But cleaning company officials said they did not have the money for large raises, which would keep them from bidding competitively.</p>
        <p>The union has called the strike as a first step toward reaching its goal of getting all the cleaning companies in the county to sign a uniform contract providing health benefits and $9-an-hour wages. The union said most of the janitors made $6.15 an hour, the state minimum wage.</p>
        <p>The strike, part of the union's Justice for Janitors campaign, aims to prepare the way to unionize the more than 2,500 janitors who clean dozens of commercial buildings throughout Fairfield County. At the moment, about 250 janitors in the county are covered by union contracts.</p>
        <p>Maintaining that it is hard to survive in the expensive county on part-time jobs, the strikers said they also hoped to pressure the cleaning companies to turn all the part-time jobs into full-time ones.</p>
        <p>But Harry Cohn, president of Service Management Group of Bridgeport, one of the companies the strikers have focused on, said it was up to the building owners, not the cleaning companies, to find the money for higher wages.</p>
        <p>''The Justice for Janitors campaign hopes to turn wages around,'' said Mr. Cohn, one of the few cleaning company executives willing to comment on the strike. ''It's a wonderful concept and we'd love to be able to pay people more money and give them the benefits. Unfortunately, we deal with what we're dealing with. It's up to them, the building owners and corporate America.''</p>
        <p>Officials from several other cleaning companies that have been struck, including Temco Building Maintenance and Melillo Maintenance Inc., declined to comment on the walkout.</p>
        <p>Thus far, the strikers have stopped work at 19 office buildings in Stamford, Greenwich, Bridgeport, Shelton and Norwalk, but the strike could eventually expand to more than 40 buildings, union officials said.</p>
        <p>They also said strikers have received $500,000 from other union members around the country to help sustain the walkout.</p>
        <p>The union has a two-step strategy. First, it hopes the strike will pressure the 10 major cleaning contractors in the county to agree to recognize the union as soon as a majority of a building's janitors sign cards saying they want union representation. Second, the union is pressuring each cleaning company to sign a countywide agreement, which is still to be negotiated.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lerner, the director of the Justice for Janitors campaign, said the goal of a countywide contract was to have the cleaning companies compete in bids not by pushing down wages and eliminating benefits but with better service, and keeping costs down by efficiency.</p>
        <p>The strike is part of a nationwide push by the service employees' union. It conducted long, emotional janitors' strikes earlier this year in Chicago, Los Angeles and San Diego.</p>
        <p>As a model, the union is pointing to a contract it reached last week in Denver where almost all the janitors worked part time. That agreement provides more than 2,000 janitors with health insurance and calls for converting half the part-time jobs to full-time jobs.</p>
        <p>The Fairfield County strike has won considerable backing from local clergy members. The Rev. Tommie Jackson, pastor of the Faith Tabernacle Missionary Baptist Church in Stamford, said: ''We will stand with these brothers and sisters until full justice is received. It strains credulity that these workers are working for just $6.15 an hour.''</p>
