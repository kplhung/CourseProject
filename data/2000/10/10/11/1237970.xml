        <p>The Seattle Mariners defeated the punchless Yankees, 2-0, last night in the opening game of the American League Championship Series.</p>
        <p>On a cold night in the Bronx, Freddy Garcia held the dormant Yankee offense to three hits in six and two-thirds innings. Besides a six-run outburst in the first inning against Oakland -- leading to a victory in the decisive game of the division series -- the Yankees have scored only 13 runs in the other 52 innings of the playoffs.</p>
        <p>The Mariners, the league's wild-card entrant, were held hitless for four and two-thirds innings. But  Rickey Henderson, a former Yankee and Met, hit a run-scoring single in the fifth inning, and Alex Rodriguez led off the sixth with a home run.</p>
        <p>Game 2 of the four-of-seven series is today at Yankee Stadium. The National League Championship Series begins tonight in St. Louis, where the Cardinals play host to the Mets.</p>
