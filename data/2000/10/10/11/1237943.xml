        <p>It was not just for fun that aides to Al Gore sat him down yesterday and showed him a parody of last week's presidential debate on ''Saturday Night Live,'' in which the vice president is depicted as an overbearing know-it-all who tried to deliver two closing statements.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's aides said they wanted the message to sink in that he had better watch his performance in the debate tonight and not come on too strong, as many of his advisers said he did the first time.</p>
        <p>The vice president seemed to get the message. In a round of network television interviews yesterday, Mr. Gore took the unusual step of acknowledging that he made factual errors in the debate and pledged to control his reactions to Gov. George W. Bush.</p>
        <p>''I've learned from the first one, I guarantee you,'' Mr. Gore said in one of the interviews, with the Fox News Channel. He added, lightheartedly, ''I think I'll sigh a little bit less in this debate.''</p>
        <p>Acknowledging his misstatements, Mr. Gore said he would ''take responsibility for getting some of the details wrong.'' And he pledged, ''I'll try to do better.''</p>
        <p>Only a week ago, advisers to Mr. Bush were showering their boss with tips about how to conduct himself against one of the most vaunted debaters in politics. They fretted about Mr. Bush's potential to foster a goofball image of himself, and his coaches let it be known that one meaningless but dangerous gaffe could cause his campaign to unravel.</p>
        <p>Now, the tables have turned. As the nominees prepare for their encounter in Winston-Salem, N.C., it is Mr. Gore who faces the most scrutiny as he tries not to say or do anything that will cement an image that he puffs up stories and is not to be trusted.</p>
        <p>Although the polls remain largely as they have been for weeks --  with the race a statistical dead heat -- the numbers have tilted ever so slightly in Mr. Bush's favor since the Boston debate. And while Mr. Gore preferred the traditional style of the debate last week, with two lecterns, the format tonight is one that Mr. Bush fought for: the two candidates and the moderator sitting around a table.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's aides, gathered at a resort in Longboat Key, Fla., for debate rehearsals, acknowledged yesterday to feeling considerable frustration about the news coverage and the polls. They say Mr. Gore demonstrated himself to be superior to Mr. Bush on policy in that first debate. And they complained that the press set a higher standard for Mr. Gore's performance.</p>
        <p>As a result, they said the news media seized upon and inflated the significance of the exasperation he showed at Mr. Bush's comments and Mr. Gore's acknowledged misstatement about the details of a disaster inspection trip to Texas.</p>
        <p>The vice president's aides said they were taking steps, large and small, to improve his performance. They even said that more care would be taken with Mr. Gore's makeup, which made him appear coated with rouge.</p>
        <p>While a week ago Mr. Gore went out of his way to portray himself as relaxed and confident before the first debate, yesterday the Bush campaign assumed that role.</p>
        <p>''No new makeup, no new clothes, no new nothing,'' said Mark McKinnon, Mr. Bush's top media adviser. ''We're dancing with who brung us.''</p>
        <p>That does not mean all is smooth for Mr. Bush: Because he performed better than many expected in last week's encounter, now the expectations are higher for the Texas governor. And Mr. Bush still has to worry about a nagging sense among many voters found in polls that he is not as swift as Mr. Gore and not as steeped in policy.</p>
        <p>Some Republicans said they were nervous because the debate was likely to delve into raging foreign policy matters like Yugoslavia and the Middle East in which Mr. Bush is less agile than Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>In a mock debate at Mr. Bush's Texas ranch on Sunday, there was a particular emphasis on foreign policy. The advisers who attended the prep session included three of his top foreign policy advisers, Paul D. Wolfowitz, Robert B. Zoellick and Condoleezza Rice. On Monday night, Mr. Bush held a session in the governor's mansion in Austin on foreign policy alone.</p>
        <p>Gore aides said they hoped that just as Mr. Bush had benefited from low expectations last week, Mr. Gore's shortcomings in the first debate may lower the bar for him on the remaining two. They maintained that it would be easier for Mr. Gore to correct his problems, which primarily concern personality, than for Mr. Bush to demonstrate a presidential command of the issues.</p>
        <p>''I think it's easier to stop sighing than to understand domestic and foreign policy,'' said one Gore aide, who added that the vice president ''is relaxed and knows what he needs to fix.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's advisers said they were optimistic that the round-table format, though requested by the Bush campaign, would work to Mr. Gore's benefit by discouraging the candidates from attacking and thus keeping the focus more on issues. ''Format does affect demeanor,'' one aide said. ''It's much harder to rip someone's lungs out when you're that close to them.''</p>
        <p>The aides said Mr. Gore was well aware of his weaknesses. They emphasized that their understanding from the producers of the first debate was that there would be no cutaway camera shots of the candidate who was not speaking at the moment.</p>
        <p>''That doesn't excuse the breathing, but that's what we were told,'' said one aide. Indeed, some Gore aides have humorously taken to greeting reporters and each other with exaggerated sighs.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes it's hard to see yourself as others see you,'' one senior adviser said, ''so I'm sure that as it was happening he didn't think of it in the way that it was magnified on television.''</p>
        <p>To reinforce the point, Mr. Gore's aides have shown him selected excerpts of his performance in the first debate. And they showed him a tape of the ''Saturday Night Live'' skit, which surgically mocked Mr. Bush as well as the vice president. In the parody, Mr. Bush, asked to sum up his campaign with a single word, blurts, ''Strategary.'' Mr. Gore's character repeatedly used the word ''lockbox.''</p>
        <p>''He thought it was hilarious,'' one Gore aide said. But the aide said Mr. Gore also recognized that the skit demonstrated that the image of his exasperation had taken root in the popular culture.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's aides said the governor did not watch the skit but that his aides joked about it with him.</p>
        <p>Since neither side declared outright victory after the first debate, both Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore may feel pressure tonight to be more aggressive. In the third debate there will be even less opportunity to point to each other's weaknesses because the format will include questions from citizens. The risk of attacking, of course, is that the candidates could appear mean-spirited.</p>
        <p>''This is really the last opportunity they will have face to face to draw sharp comparisons,'' said Alan Schroeder, a journalism professor at Northeastern University who is an authority on presidential debates. ''They could go either way.'' Noting that Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush will be sitting close to each other, he added, ''They could go negative or they might find themselves intimidated by their proximity into backing off in the way the vice-presidential candidates found themselves doing.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's advisers, acknowledging that there were points in the first debate when the governor could have responded more cogently to Mr. Gore's criticism of his proposals, said the governor was sharpening his rebuttals.</p>
        <p>They made clear that Mr. Bush was not about to shrink from taking on Mr. Gore, if need be.</p>
        <p>''The governor will set the record straight,'' said Karl Rove, Mr. Bush's chief strategist. ''But he'll handle it in an appropriate way.'' He added, ''the Gore campaign is clearly panicking here.''</p>
        <p>Richard Greene, a speech coach who works for Republicans and Democrats and whose clients included Diana, princess of Wales, said both contenders needed to learn from their missteps last week.</p>
        <p>''Gore needs to come from his heart and not his head, and stay away from stretching the truth even one inch,'' he said. ''Bush has got to dig down and search his soul to focus on what he truly believes in about issues he doesn't have experience with. He can't only talk about education.''</p>
