        <p>Re ''With Quiet, Unseen Ties, Drug Makers Sway Debate'' (front page, Oct. 5):</p>
        <p>Those of us at the state and national levels who advocate better health care for ordinary people have to deal with low salaries, indifferent legislators, well-financed opponents in tasseled loafers and seemingly intractable problems that rarely have easy solutions. Now our grass-roots groups have the additional roadblock of these biased ''Astroturf'' advocacy groups that are set up with drug industry financing.</p>
        <p>By making legislators suspicious of all health advocacy organizations, these efforts make it harder for real patients and real people to be heard on the high cost of drugs and a variety of other health issues.</p>
