        <p>LAST impressions can be lasting. And the image of Mike Hampton flummoxed on the mound, his Mets cap pulled tightly around his ears and steam rising from them, is memorable. It may be painful for Mets fans to recall, but it may have pertinence to tonight's opening game against the Cardinals in the National League Championship Series. Hampton, after all, is the starting pitcher, the left-hander the Mets are hoping can put them on the freeway to victory. The scene in question occurred in the third inning of Game 1 of the National League division series last Wednesday in Pacific Bell Park in San Francisco.</p>
        <p>Hampton had thrown what he believed to be Strike 3 to the Giants' most menacing batter, one Barry Bonds. The umpire had a different angle -- Hampton thought it was from behind a post -- and called it a ball. A strike would have resulted in the third out of the inning. Hampton was clearly distracted, his mouth agape within his goatee.</p>

        <p>LAST impressions can be lasting. And the image of Mike Hampton flummoxed on the mound, his Mets cap pulled tightly around his ears and steam rising from them, is memorable. It may be painful for Mets fans to recall, but it may have pertinence to tonight's opening game against the Cardinals in the National League Championship Series. Hampton, after all, is the starting pitcher, the left-hander the Mets are hoping can put them on the freeway to victory. The scene in question occurred in the third inning of Game 1 of the National League division series last Wednesday in Pacific Bell Park in San Francisco.</p>
        <p>Hampton had thrown what he believed to be Strike 3 to the Giants' most menacing batter, one Barry Bonds. The umpire had a different angle -- Hampton thought it was from behind a post -- and called it a ball. A strike would have resulted in the third out of the inning. Hampton was clearly distracted, his mouth agape within his goatee.</p>
        <p>On the next pitch, Bonds whacked a run-scoring triple to put the Giants ahead, 2-1. Two batters later, Ellis Burks hit the foul pole with a drive that scored three runs. And it was curtains for the Mets, at least for the evening.</p>
        <p>But they endeavored to come back to win the series and send themselves off to Missouri, with well-pitched games from the other starting pitchers, Al Leiter, Rick Reed and Bobby J. Jones.</p>
        <p>Hampton has been a superb pitcher in his eight seasons in the major leagues, his best being 1999 when he led the National League in victories, with 22, against just 4 losses, for Houston. He won 15 this season, one short of the team leader, Leiter.</p>
        <p>But even fine, experienced athletes can sustain a moment when they suffer dejection, when their minds begin to wander, when they rant at the gods and an official or two for injustices rendered. Then someone triples and someone else parks one into the outfield night.</p>
        <p>Had he revisited that inning in his mind over the last week?</p>
        <p>''No,'' Hampton said yesterday. ''I thought I made quality pitches to Bonds on the 2-2 pitch and on the 3-2 pitch. Then, you know, it snowballed from there.''</p>
        <p>Had he learned anything?</p>
        <p>''You just try to put it out of your mind,'' he said. But it would be surprising if he reacted the same way in a similar situation.</p>
        <p>Hampton, after all, has a very good memory. He doesn't keep a written file on batters, as some pitchers do. ''I don't know if it's ignorance on my part or not, but I basically know every hitter I face. I remember the at-bats they had, when I faced them earlier in the year, the year previous. I really can remember things like that.</p>
        <p>''So I use stuff that is stored up a little more than some guys on our team. I know they like to watch videotapes of hitters,  study what pitchers are getting them out. But I go on memory.''</p>
        <p>Bobby Valentine, the Mets' manager, has a memory as well. He was asked if he had considered changing the pitching rotation to throw Leiter first. Leiter, who pitched well despite getting no decision in Game 2, which the Mets won in extra innings, has been regarded as the best and most experienced postseason pitcher the Mets have. ''It was the way we opened the season -- Hampton first, then Leiter,'' Valentine said, ''and it was the way we opened the playoffs. And all that went pretty well. So I factored all that in and stayed the course.''</p>
        <p>Was it a big deal to Hampton, for ego or otherwise? ''Not really,'' he said. ''I've never put much stock in that kind of thing. The important thing is that I'll get a chance to pitch and show what I can do. These are big games. These are things that we dream about as kids, to be in situations like this, with a legitimate chance to go to the World Series.''</p>
        <p>Hampton also didn't think that being a lefty necessarily had a great advantage against a Cardinals lineup loaded with left-handers. In the mind-boggling mind games that baseball people play, the strategy would seem to favor the opponents' left-handed thrower.</p>
        <p>''It boils down to if you are on that day, regardless if you are right- or left-handed, you got to like your chances,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Of course, there are quality pitches and quality pitches. And there's the reaction to quality pitches when the significant observer behind the plate considers the pitch less than quality. It then becomes imperative to keep one's concentration intact.</p>
