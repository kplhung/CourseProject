        <p>A former vice president of the failed Sogo department store chain was found dead in his home after hanging himself, the police said. Yukio Nakazawa, 74, the second executive at the company to commit suicide, was one of the managers at Sogo sued by the current management for mismanaging the company, leading it into bankruptcy in July with $17 billion in debts, one of Japan's biggest corporate failures. Sogo sought protection from creditors when public pressure forced the government to cancel a debt relief plan for Sogo that would have used taxpayer money.</p>
