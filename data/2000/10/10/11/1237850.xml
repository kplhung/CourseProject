        <p>ONE of the best-known companies in New York is undergoing the first substantial makeover of its brand identity since John V. Lindsay was mayor, Nelson A. Rockefeller was governor and a subway token still cost 15 cents.</p>
        <p>Can you dig it? For those of you with memories of New York of the 1950's and 1960's, that is a hint about which company is changing its public face.</p>
        <p>Yes, nostalgia buffs, it is Consolidated Edison, the electric and gas utility once known for the signs decorating its construction projects that read ''Dig we must.'' Con Edison, as the company is popularly known, is introducing the identity overhaul this week, along with a logo -- the stylized letters ''c'' and ''e'' nested together -- meant to symbolize its business operations.</p>
        <p>The changes are emblematic of the substantive shifts in the once-staid world of utilities as deregulation and competition require suppliers of natural gas, electricity and telephone service to vie for the attention of fickle consumers along with the purveyors of products like soft drinks, automobiles and fast food.</p>
        <p>''The energy business is changing,'' said Frances Resheske, vice president for public affairs at Con Edison in New York, who is responsible for tasks like advertising, public relations and employee communications. ''It's important we educate customers as to what's going on.''</p>
        <p>For instance, Con Edison is ''now the transportation part of the business instead of the generation part,'' she added, ''because we sold our generating plants as part of deregulation.''</p>
        <p>This is the first such overhaul for the Con Ed identity since 1968, according to Ms. Resheske. About the only element left unchanged is the corporate color scheme, which remains blue and white, evocative of Columbia University (at least to a columnist who was admitted there but attended Northwestern University instead.)</p>
        <p>The rebranding is being brought to the attention of current and potential Con Ed customers with an elaborate advertising campaign by AG Worldwide in New York, which also developed the new identity program. The ads carry the theme ''On it'' -- sort of a cross between ''Just do it,'' the longtime Nike slogan, and ''Bring it on,'' the phrase now tripping off the tongues of the youth of America.</p>
        <p>Con Ed plans to spend more than $3 million for the ads, which will be centered on employees at work around the five boroughs and Westchester County. The campaign was planned, Ms. Resheske said, before the actors' strike against advertisers and agencies that began in May, which has led to the substitution of workers for strikers in many ads.</p>
        <p>The new logo presents the name Con Edison as conEdison. The ''E'' is meant to suggest words like energy, experienced, economic, equipped and experienced as well as to salute the company's founder, Thomas A. Edison. The logo will be emblazoned on everything from trucks to hardhats to bills.</p>
        <p>Speaking of which, the revamping is undoubtedly likely to raise the hackles of those who reflexively condemn promotional campaigns for public utilities as unnecessary and extravagant every time they sit down to pay their electric, gas or telephone bills.</p>
        <p>''If a company is evolving, that message has to be sent directly to the consumer,'' said Peter Arnell, chairman and executive creative director at AG, which since March has been part of the Draft Worldwide unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies.</p>
        <p>''It's not ethereal in this case,'' he added of the rebranding, ''because it's important for Con Edison to be seen in a new and different way.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Resheske agreed, saying: ''This is not an image campaign. We are focusing on important nuts and bolts. It's about who we really are and what we really stand for, our commitment to our customers 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and our 14,000 men and women.''</p>
        <p>The choice of AG to modify the Con Edison identity is surprising because the agency is far more practiced in developing and polishing brands for fashion and apparel marketers than for prosaic purveyors of power and heat. Con Edison is no Banana Republic, Hanes hosiery, Tommy Hilfiger or Donna Karan, to name just a few of the most familiar AG clients.</p>
        <p>''Con Edison spent more than four months interviewing us,'' Mr. Arnell said, ''and they really did dig'' -- that a purposeful echo of the old Con Edison slogan, which he correctly recalled in a pop quiz.</p>
        <p>''What we know in fashion and style applies to any industry,'' Mr. Arnell said, ''how to distill the essence of a brand and how to represent it in a clear, simple way.''</p>
        <p>Besides, he added, ''they loved the fact I grew up in Brooklyn.''</p>
