        <p>Joan Rovy, 75, a retired secretary here, usually votes for Democrats. But she said she just could not commit herself to Vice President Al Gore.</p>
        <p>''He doesn't stick with what he says,'' she said. ''He's told some lies about several things, like about contributions. I'm a Christian and that bothers me very much.''</p>
        <p>Joseph Ewing, 34, a firefighter, usually votes for Republicans. But after watching Gov. George W. Bush of Texas tackling a foreign policy question in the debate last week, he said he was not sure what to do. ''He's inexperienced,'' Mr. Ewing said. ''He was having trouble even in the debate when they were asking him the Yugoslavia question.''</p>
        <p>Conversations with more than two dozen voters like these from this town in the middle of one of the most competitive states in the presidential race shed some light on why the electorate is still so divided, and ambivalent, only four weeks before the vote. Voters expressed the same considerable doubts about the two candidates that they had when the campaign began -- and the candidates were less known to Americans.</p>
        <p>The theme that emerged was that Mr. Bush had yet to inspire great confidence, while Mr. Gore was still fighting the impression that he cannot be trusted.</p>
        <p>With the plastics, chemical and light bulb factories here humming along, many voters interviewed said there were no burning issues in their minds; no one seemed to be particularly interested in foreign affairs, even the overthrow of Slobodan Milosevic. Instead, they often mentioned personal characteristics in each candidate that, more often than not, they found wanting.</p>
        <p>The uncertainty is not unique to Circleville, a working-class community that is roughly split between Republicans and Democrats and is known far and wide for its annual pumpkin festival and the gigantic pumpkin-shaped water tower that looms over the roughly 12,000 residents. Even among the voters nationwide who support Mr. Bush or Mr. Gore, 4 in 10 have reservations about their candidate, according to a New York Times/CBS News poll. Four years ago, only 3 in 10 expressed reservations about the nominees.</p>
        <p>In their second debate, in Winston-Salem, N.C., on Wednesday, the contenders will seek to allay the voters' lingering doubts. But judging from the interviews in this town about 30 miles south of Columbus, Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush have a tough sell.</p>
        <p>When asked about Mr. Gore, the first response of voter after voter -- even some supporters -- was that he has trouble telling the truth. Voters raised the matter themselves with no prompting. They seemed to be reacting to the instances in last week's debate, or the news coverage of it, in which Mr. Gore embellished events.</p>
        <p>''He acts like Opie sometimes --  'I'm a good ole Southern boy,' '' said Don Gose, 42, recalling the little boy on the old ''Andy Griffith Show.'' ''He gets caught and there's a goofy grin and a laugh,'' Mr. Gose said. ''But you've got to bring some integrity here. We're dealing with world governments.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gose, who owns the Pumpkin Patch Farm Market, said he planned to vote for Mr. Bush. But he is hardly thrilled with the Republicans. ''You don't see Bush signs around here,'' he noted.</p>
        <p>Toni Lewis, 44, a bus driver, said she would probably vote for Mr. Gore because as vice president ''he's already in the spot where he can take over.'' But she was deeply troubled by how Mr. Gore presented himself.</p>
        <p>''He doesn't tell the truth,'' Ms. Lewis said. ''If you ask him a question, he goes with something else.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Lewis's friend John Peele, 46, a prison worker, piped in, saying Mr. Gore would be more acceptable than Mr. Bush, who he said was ''not capable of taking over the country.''</p>
        <p>Fred Brown, 65, a retired minister who backed Ross Perot four years ago, said he was so put off by Mr. Gore that he would probably back Mr. Bush. ''He's got his dad to lean back on,'' Mr. Brown said. ''I can't stand the lying man. I embellish, but I can get away with it. I'm not running for president.''</p>
        <p>Unlike the sentiments expressed about the vice president, not one overriding concern about Mr. Bush  stood out with voters. Still, many expressed reservations about him, the most common being whether he had sufficient depth of knowledge or experience to be president.</p>
        <p>''Gore seemed a lot more intelligent to me than Bush,'' Jason Overly, 24, an electrician, said of the debate. ''Gore seems superior. That's very important. You have to be smart to be president.''</p>
        <p>Rob Dolby, 24, who owns a collectibles business, said he was torn over whom to vote for, and may even end up with Mr. Bush, but was distressed by the governor's use of vulgar language to describe a reporter.</p>
        <p>''Bush made those comments off the cuff,'' he said. ''It was a slip-up. But you want a kind of godly guy in office.''</p>
        <p>Many of the voters acknowledged that they were not versed in the issues. Several said they had not watched the presidential or vice-presidential debates. Yet they said they had formed impressions of the candidates from their friends and families and from hearing about them on television.</p>
        <p>Even voters who had settled on a candidate often said they were basing their backing on party loyalty, not enthusiasm. Several Democrats suggested that they wished they could for President Clinton again.</p>
        <p>''I'll probably vote for Gore because Bush won't raise the minimum wage,'' said Walt Seymour, a warehouse worker in his 40's. ''But Clinton has more backbone. Gore has never impressed me as being as firm as Clinton. I didn't vote for him because he had sex. I don't care if he's gay. I voted for him because he's a good president.''</p>
        <p>Republicans are not enamored of Mr. Bush, either. Many said after watching the vice-presidential debate that they would favor Mr. Bush's running mate, Dick Cheney, over Mr. Bush himself.</p>
        <p>''I watched the debate and I thought Gore was more comfortable than Bush,'' said Robert Alphin, 48, a highway equipment operator, who is not sure whom to vote for. ''They're both about the same.''</p>
        <p>The politician who impressed Mr. Alphin most -- and seemed far more in command of issues than Mr. Bush -- was Mr. Cheney.</p>
        <p>Mr. Alphin said he liked Mr. Cheney's delivering his answers in the vice-presidential debate by looking directly at the moderator ''instead of talking to the TV screen.'' Like many interviewed, he did not remember the name of Mr. Gore's running mate, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut.</p>
        <p>Mr. Alphin's suggestion: ''There should be a Gore-Cheney ticket. They'd probably win in a landslide!''</p>
        <p>Bob Lutz, 74, who sells coins as a hobby in retirement, said, ''I probably won't make up my mind'' until Election Day. ''I don't care much for either one,'' he said.</p>
        <p>If he ends up voting for Mr. Bush, Mr. Lutz said, ''it's not that I like Bush so much'' but that Mr. Gore is not genuine. ''My problem with Gore is I don't know which Gore he is today,'' he said. ''Each time he appears he's somebody a little different.''</p>
        <p>Ned R. Young, 80, a retired electrical engineer, said he was backing Mr. Bush because he was tired of paying high taxes. ''I've watched my taxes go from $340 a year to $1,400 a year,'' Mr. Young said. ''Bush will do a better job on leadership. Bush said in the debate he would be better able to work with Democrats and Republicans in Congress. I never heard Gore make that statement.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Young said he was deeply troubled by what he described as the vice president's lack of credibility. ''He handles the truth a little recklessly,'' he said. ''It's like my wife telling me she's never burned anything on the stove. We've been married 62 years!''</p>
        <p>Without prompting, Mr. Young mentioned how Mr. Bush often mangled words. ''I'm not worried about how people speak,'' he said. ''That's a picky, picky thing.''</p>
        <p>Down the street, Mary K. May, 84, a retired geography teacher, who has lived in a white brick house at Franklin and Washington Streets for 76 years, sounded more lukewarm about Mr. Bush. Both candidates, she complained, were obsessed with soliciting voters for donations.</p>
        <p>''They're just running around spending money,'' Miss May said. ''It makes me sick. They are begging me for money all the time. I tell them, 'You young whippersnappers, leave me alone!' ''</p>
        <p>Miss May said she would vote Republican, not for the candidate but because of what the party stands for. Explaining that she had worked hard for her money, she said, ''I don't feel it's my duty to give it to everyone else. Some people are freeloaders. You might as well know that.''</p>
        <p>For some voters, the alternatives were not appealing: a candidate they think is not quite ready for the job versus a candidate they cannot quite trust.</p>
        <p>''Bush is more honest, more reasonable, even though he doesn't have the experience Gore has had the last eight years,'' Michael Smith, 32, an engineer, said over lunch at Goodwin's Family Restaurant. But sounding hardly thrilled by the prospects, Mr. Smith added, ''It seems like I can't say I'm proud of my government.''</p>
