        <p>I DRIVE a minivan, and until just the other day I was quite happy with that. Then I had an opportunity to borrow a red Toyota Solara convertible for an afternoon. I had seen an advertisement for it in a women's magazine, promising a certain glamour missing from my humdrum suburban mom existence. ''The wind in your hair. The sun on your face. The bugs in your teeth,'' the copy read. (No kidding.) ''With its 200-horsepower, V-6 engine and power top, it will blow your skirt up. And then some.''</p>
        <p>I decided to take an actress friend with me who insisted we wear scarves and big sunglasses, pretend we were Sophia Loren and Gina Lollobrigida, and yell ''Buongiorno!'' to passers-by. Then, this being a four-seater, we took turns thrilling our children with a ride in the convertible. We had to settle for riding along the Passaic River, rather than the Riviera, but I must say the experience delivered. Who knew that I was really a convertible driver at heart?</p>

        <p>I DRIVE a minivan, and until just the other day I was quite happy with that. Then I had an opportunity to borrow a red Toyota Solara convertible for an afternoon. I had seen an advertisement for it in a women's magazine, promising a certain glamour missing from my humdrum suburban mom existence. ''The wind in your hair. The sun on your face. The bugs in your teeth,'' the copy read. (No kidding.) ''With its 200-horsepower, V-6 engine and power top, it will blow your skirt up. And then some.''</p>
        <p>I decided to take an actress friend with me who insisted we wear scarves and big sunglasses, pretend we were Sophia Loren and Gina Lollobrigida, and yell ''Buongiorno!'' to passers-by. Then, this being a four-seater, we took turns thrilling our children with a ride in the convertible. We had to settle for riding along the Passaic River, rather than the Riviera, but I must say the experience delivered. Who knew that I was really a convertible driver at heart?</p>
        <p>Obviously, Toyota did. And other car manufacturers are getting beyond what Sylvia Marino of the consumer-oriented automotive Web site Edmunds.com calls ''the old minivan and soccer mom myth.'' In fact, some marketing experts think that women driving hot, sexy, stylish cars -- ones often associated with the midlife crises of men -- may be the answer to the car industry's biggest question, ''What's the next sport utility vehicle?''</p>
        <p>Of course, the question ''What do women want?'' stumped even Freud. Reams of market research generated by the auto industry every year cannot answer the question definitively either. An early Detroit effort at designing a car with women in mind was the 1956 Dodge Custom Royal La Femme hardtop coupe, which was painted pink and came with a folding umbrella. It was a flop.</p>
        <p>Conventional wisdom has it that women are most concerned about reliability and safety. ''You don't want to be caught on a dark road with a car that has things happen to it,'' said Barbara Stern, a marketing professor at Rutgers University in Newark. While Dr. Stern, who lives in New York City, does not own a car herself, she has a clear picture of what she would drive. ''I would definitely drive some very safe but low-slung snappy car,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Doug Berdie, the manager of the strategic brand research division of Total Research, a market research company, sees a new cohort of car buyers emerging: women in their 40's who like looks, styling, driving safely at high speeds and driving often just for fun, and for whom money is no object. ''It may be the husband that ends up in the S.U.V. and the wife that ends up in the Maserati,'' Dr. Berdie said.</p>
        <p>Karen Piurkowski, an executive at the Polk Company, an auto market research firm in Southfield, Mich., agrees that while women tend to look for value and reliability, a growing number are starting to buy -- or at least ogle -- roadsters. But here is the catch: It's not the ''Baywatch'' types who are buying them but women of baby boom age or older, who have ''a little more disposable income,'' Ms. Piurkowski said. ''The empty nester moving into something a little bit more appealing,'' she added.</p>
        <p>Although she drives a minivan, and her husband drives a Mazda Miata, she has her eye on an Audi TT convertible. ''It's just really cute,'' she said. As for toting around their two children, ages 9 and 11, Ms. Piurkowski said with a laugh, ''I think next time he's going to have the family car.''</p>
        <p>Car manufacturers are following these trends carefully, and many are focusing on  women. Legend has it that male designers of Cadillac's Catera model, introduced in '96 as a '97 model, put paper clips on their fingernails to simulate a woman's hands. More recently, Cadillac conducted numerous all-women focus groups on the Escalade, its full-size S.U.V., and plans to unveil several female-friendly features in its 2002 model, which goes on sale in January. Among them is a liftgate designed for women who are no more than five feet tall, a third-row seat that weighs only 38 pounds so that women can remove it easily and security lights to help women see under their cars  at night. And, of course, fingernail-friendly door handles.</p>
        <p>The paper-clip trick was not necessary this time, said Susan Docherty, an Escalade brand manager, ''because we had a number of women on the design team.''</p>
        <p>JAGUAR is also looking for women drivers.</p>
        <p>''It's one of our key strategies,'' said Sue Rhodes, who handles Jaguar advertising in the United States. The company sponsored a breast cancer awareness event in conjunction with Golf for Women, a magazine in which it advertises, as well as  seminars for the National Association of Women Business Owners.</p>
        <p>Jaguar also has a women's product and marketing committee in Coventry, England, which studies everything from women's perception of the dealer experience to how shorter people can reach the controls.</p>
        <p>But Cathy Ellico, the committee's co-chairwoman, makes it clear that Jaguar does not want to woo women by putting on frills. ''Nobody really wants a women's car,'' she said. ''It's not a matter of putting out pink cars, with clearance for fingernails, and you're going to make women happy.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Ellico has put her finger on the nub of the matter. Although manufacturers know that women make most buying decisions, when it comes to cars they have to be careful of the sensitive male ego.</p>
        <p>''You have to do it in a way that doesn't alienate men,'' said Rob Dewar, a senior account supervisor in the Troy, Mich., office of the Carlson Marketing Group. ''The more you position yourself female,'' Mr. Dewar added, the more you risk turning a model or a brand into a ''chick car.'' That's Detroit-speak, he explained, for ''a vehicle that girls would drive, and therefore is detrimental to attracting men.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, Saturn, which has one of the highest percentages of women owners thanks to its ''no haggle'' dealer policy, is trying to backpedal from its ''chick car'' image. Saturn never set out to design a car for women, said Anne Santori, a Saturn spokeswoman, adding, ''Our intent was always to treat people with honesty and respect.'' The company is, in fact, trying to attract more men with midsize models, Ms. Santori added.</p>
        <p>TOYOTA also wants it known that the Solara convertible is intended for both sexes -- despite the ''blow your skirt up'' advertisements. ''Females are not our primary marketing target,'' said Ming-Jou Chen, a company spokeswoman, who pointed out that another Solara convertible advertisement featured ''images of a toupee and a staple gun.''</p>
        <p>But Ms. Dochery of Cadillac thinks that other carmakers are foolhardy if they back off from embracing female customers. Even when men buy cars, she pointed out, women influence their decisions 70 percent of the time. ''I don't think they can afford to be afraid to target women,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The question of ''chick cars'' is like the subject of bratty children: everyone has an opinion. Tom Spencer, an automotive expert for Claritas, a market research firm, said that he sees women driving mostly S.U.V.'s and minivans in Atlanta, where he lives, but Steve Moore, a Claritas public relations executive who lives in California, has other views. (Everybody in California is an expert on cars.) To him, classic ''chick cars'' include the Volkswagen Cabriolet (now the Cabrio), the New Beetle and the Mazda Miata.</p>
        <p>The Miata?</p>
        <p>''They're tiny and they're four cylinder,'' he said. ''Guys typically want power.''</p>
        <p>When he heard that, Christian Wardlaw, the editor in chief of Edmunds.com and a Miata owner himself, let out a long chuckle. ''I, too, thought that it was a 'chick car,' '' he said. ''And then I drove one. And one drive is all it takes. If anybody who calls it a 'chick car' has driven it, then they have an ego problem.''</p>
