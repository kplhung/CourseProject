        <p>It happens every Wednesday around 2 p.m. with the precision of a theatrical scene change. Crowds of children in neat plaid uniforms exit St. Kevin's School in Flushing, Queens. Minutes later, about 100 pupils, clad in jeans and T-shirts, flood in through another door.</p>
        <p>The casually dressed pupils are from nearby public elementary schools, mainly Public Schools 107 and 162.

        <p>It happens every Wednesday around 2 p.m. with the precision of a theatrical scene change. Crowds of children in neat plaid uniforms exit St. Kevin's School in Flushing, Queens. Minutes later, about 100 pupils, clad in jeans and T-shirts, flood in through another door.</p>
        <p>The casually dressed pupils are from nearby public elementary schools, mainly Public Schools 107 and 162. Under a long-running program that is available to school districts nationwide, they have been excused from school an hour early to study at St. Kevin's, a school affiliated with St. Kevin's Roman Catholic Church at 45-21 194th Street.</p>
        <p>To New Yorkers who attended the city's public schools decades ago, the  scene in Flushing may seem familiar, if greatly diminished. Enrollment in these ''released time'' programs has fallen steeply from its levels in the 1940's through the 1960's, when 100,000 pupils, more than 1 in 10 public school students,  left classes for religious instruction.  In those days, many city classrooms virtually emptied out on Wednesday afternoons, igniting religious frictions and court battles.</p>
        <p>The program was begun in 1940, after the New York State Legislature passed legislation allowing children to be absent from school for religious education. After it was upheld by the United States Supreme Court, the law was adopted by many states</p>
        <p>Now, 60 years after its inception and 48 years after the Supreme Court ruled it constitutional, New York City's released-time program has shrunk to one-tenth of its size at its peak. Even as similar programs gain ground in a few other parts of the nation, where Muslim and evangelical Christians have asked school districts to institute them, the New York City program is declining.</p>
        <p>These days, two buses discharge public school children at St. Kevin's School on Wednesdays. But there used to be more, said Laura Stroligo,  coordinator of religious education for  St. Kevin's parish. Enrollment has dropped, she said, in part because there are more working parents, who often want their children to stay in public school buildings for after  school programs.</p>
        <p>Others cite the difficulty of finding teachers for the programs, which are  mostly taught by volunteers, and the flight of middle-class Jews from the city's public schools.</p>
        <p>According to Margie Feinberg, a spokeswoman for the New York City Board of Education, 9,211 students, nearly all in elementary school, took part in the religious program in the 1999-2000 school year. Figures from the principal religious organizations  running the programs put the number higher, at more than 12,000 for the past school year, with 8,000 in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York alone.</p>
        <p>Though the program has slipped from view in some pockets of the city, it is vigorous in others, notably on Staten Island. There, more than 1 in 10 elementary school pupils -- 3,249 out of 28,000 -- took part in the program in the 1999-2000 school year, said Scott Miller, deputy superintendent of Community School District 31, which encompasses the entire borough of Staten Island.</p>
        <p>While students at St. Kevin's are released early to accommodate the public school children, the public schools do not close early, and even in classrooms where only one pupil is released for catechism, the program can shape the instructional day for those remaining. Board of Education regulations say that no new material is to be taught during release time, so that no students will be handicapped. A 1979 chancellor's memo suggested filling the hour with remedial work or exercises with reference books.</p>
        <p>''It became a scheduling nightmare sometimes,'' said Mr. Miller, ''to make sure there was not a significant amount of material being taught.''</p>
        <p>Religious leaders say that with  mounting pressures to meet higher standards, the board regulations have not always been strictly observed.</p>
        <p>''Ninety-nine percent of the time, we've had good cooperation,'' said  Sister Joan Curtin, director of the catechism programs for public school students at the Office of Catechetics of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York.</p>
        <p>Still, she said, a few years ago, when new standardized tests were introduced, she heard that students in her programs were missing reading instruction. The matter was resolved, she said, after she met with district superintendents on Staten Island and in upper Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Similarly, Rabbi Sholem Hecht, chairman of the Committee for the Furtherance of Jewish Education, a branch of the Lubavitch movement, said he had recently written to William C. Thompson Jr., the president of the Board of Education, after discovering that some schools were scheduling computer lab during released time.</p>
        <p>Rabbi Hecht acknowledged that his committee faced bigger challenges than computer labs. Enrollment in his program, one of several Jewish released-time programs in the city, has dropped to fewer than 1,000 students last year from 10,000 in the 1950's, he said. As Jews have dispersed around the city, it has been hard to arrange classes for handfuls of students near their schools. And many Jewish participants are immigrants from countries where religious expression was not tolerated, so they know little about Judaism and are not affiliated with any synagogue.</p>
        <p>Social changes in the city seem to have weakened the program that two  Brooklyn mothers, Tessim Zorach and Esta Gluck, unsuccessfully challenged in a case that reached the United States Supreme Court in 1952,  Zorach v. Clauson. The two women, Episcopalian and Jewish, respectively, sent their own children to religious school outside of school hours. They contended that the New York program violated the constitutional requirement of separation of church and state.</p>
        <p>Even after the high court ruled, the issue was hotly discussed for years. And in some parishes, released time still has a big impact on religious life, said Denise Enright, religious education coordinator for St. Teresa's parish on Staten Island, which serves 200 public school students.</p>
        <p>Children new to Staten Island public schools, she said, cannot help but notice that some children leave on Wednesday afternoons.</p>
        <p>''The child goes home and says, 'Mommy, why are the other kids going across the street to St. Teresa's parish?' '' Mrs. Enright said.</p>
        <p>This sometimes gets the parents involved in church and catechism, she said: after explaining to their children that the other pupils are leaving for instruction in their faith, the parents think, ''We're Catholic, too.''</p>
