        <p>What took so long? Astounding as it seems, Joan Allen, one of the country's most respected actresses for the better part of two decades, is only now seeing the release of an American film in which she plays the lead character.</p>
        <p>In ''The Contender,'' a political thriller set to open on Friday, Ms. Allen, a 44-year-old Tony winner and two-time Oscar nominee who has earned awards from national and regional film critics associations, plays a highly principled United States senator whose nomination for vice president stirs up a long-buried sex scandal.</p>
        <p>''At least this time, instead of being married to the politician, I get to be the politician,'' said Ms. Allen, referring to her Oscar-nominated performance as the wife of the embattled president in Oliver Stone's ''Nixon'' (1995).</p>
        <p>''I've let it roll, to a degree, as far as my career is concerned,'' Ms. Allen said over lunch recently at the Four Seasons Hotel in Los Angeles. ''I suppose I could try to make myself more visible, go to more events in Los Angeles, things like that. I don't know if it would make any difference. The truth is, I would rather be at home in New York or with my friends. You could make an argument that it's bad for my career, but I don't care. I'm happy with the way things are going.''</p>
        <p>She ran her slender fingers through close-cropped curly hair, still damp from a shower that morning after a workout in the hotel's health club. Perhaps because she looked so lanky and long limbed in her well-worn blue jeans and yellow tank top, this actress with strikingly blue eyes seemed taller than her 5 feet 10 inches. She sipped slowly on her iced tea. (''It's not one of those fruit mixtures, is it?'') But she dug in heartily when a bowl of fragrant chicken stew arrived.</p>
        <p>Yes, she said, she would like to play more leading roles in films. And yes, it's not a bad thing that the Oscar talk is buzzing around her again. As Hollywood shifts into the awards season, her performance in ''The Contender,'' which had its first public screening at the Toronto International Film Festival last month, is frequently mentioned among those that might draw an Academy Award nomination in February. She's been there before, nominated and not winning for ''Nixon'' and for ''The Crucible'' in 1997. But this time the role is not a supporting one.</p>
        <p>''I try very hard not to think too much about it,'' Ms. Allen said. ''I am sure that the morning that the nominations are announced, I'll be paying attention, and I'll be disappointed if my name doesn't come up. Devastated, no.''</p>
        <p>It was at another awards ceremony -- in 1998, when she was judged the best supporting actress by the Los Angeles critics for her performance in ''Pleasantville'' -- that the saga of ''The Contender'' began.</p>
        <p>Rod Lurie, at the time a somewhat ferocious and feared film critic and longtime Joan Allen admirer, asked his fellow critics to allow him to present the award to her, which meant he would be seated at Ms. Allen's table during the banquet. Mr. Lurie was already plotting his transition from critic to filmmaker, and he had, as he put it, ''a real creative crush on Joan.'' So during his presentation Mr. Lurie told the audience that if he ever made a film, he would write a role for her because a simple perusal of her credits showed that having her in a movie was almost a guarantee of quality.</p>
        <p>''After I presented the award and sat back down at the table, she leaned over and said, 'You know, if you write that screenplay, I would definitely read it,' '' he said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Allen said she had been curious about meeting Mr. Lurie because she had been told by her publicist that Mr. Lurie, who had a Los Angeles radio show at the time, frequently praised her work on the air, sometimes even when he was reviewing films he knew she wasn't in. Still, she had no idea whether Mr. Lurie's offer was just so much awards-show bluster.</p>
        <p>It wasn't. Mr. Lurie said he began very quickly to tailor a role for her. ''I thought, first off she needs a lead role,'' he said. ''She needed to be in a story where everything swirled around her, instead of her swirling around everybody else.''</p>
        <p>Since Mr. Lurie's interests were in politics -- he is the son of the political cartoonist Ranan Lurie, and his first directing effort, ''Deterrence,'' released last spring, was also a presidential thriller -- he set the story in the world of high-stakes politics.</p>
        <p>After the script arrived in Ireland, where she was shooting a film, Ms. Allen said, he told her that he wanted to make her a decidedly active character and to emphasize her sexuality and athleticism. ''He said he wanted to write things that it would be fun to see me get the opportunity to do,'' she said. (The film she was making in Ireland, ''When the Sky Falls,'' was her first starring screen vehicle. It was released this year in Britain and Ireland but has not been seen in the United States.)</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, Mr. Lurie said, when he finished the script and began to shop it around to the major studios and production houses, others were not quite so enthusiastic about Joan Allen as the star. ''Several places said, yeah, they might do it, but only if we agreed to have someone else play the lead role,'' he said. ''I refused. I just really felt that the role had been written very specifically for her, and not to do it with her would have been a creative betrayal.''</p>
        <p>But he and his partners were able to find the financing, and Ms. Allen's presence in the cast provided the final push to get all the other major actors (Jeff Bridges, Gary Oldman, Christian Slater, William Petersen, Sam Elliott) to sign on at well below their standard asking prices. ''Her presence is like a magnet,'' Mr. Lurie said. ''She cleanses any film she is associated with.''</p>
        <p>The movie is the first already-finished film that six-year-old DreamWorks has purchased to distribute.</p>
        <p>For those who remember her astonishing back-to-back performances on Broadway in the mid-1980's in Lanford Wilson's ''Burn This'' and Wendy Wasserstein's ''Heidi Chronicles,'' it is something of a shock to be reminded that Joan Allen has not performed on the stage for more than 10 years. ''I just burned out, I think,'' she said.</p>
        <p>But she also sees her changing career as part of a natural evolution from the shy, somewhat fearful small-town girl (Rochelle, Ill., 80 miles west of Chicago) who embraced theater as a means of unleashing bottled-up emotions to the happily married (to the actor Peter Friedman) mother of a Manhattan first-grader (Sadie) who feels more at ease these days connecting ''directly with the world,'' as she put it.</p>
        <p>''I was the good girl, no question about it,'' Ms. Allen said. ''Voted most likely to succeed, always on the A honor list.'' She got hooked on performing, she said, as a cheerleader in junior high school.</p>
        <p>''When you're a cheerleader in a small town like that, you are guaranteed popularity,'' she said. ''I saw it as a way to get to perform and, hopefully, meet boys.'' But the high school cheering squad was smaller, and she didn't make the cut. So she turned to theater. She competed on the school's speech team, which performed dramatic recitations and one-act plays, and she played the mother in a high school production of ''The Effect of Gamma Rays on Man-in-the-Moon Marigolds.''</p>
        <p>She followed her sister to Eastern Illinois University. ''I wanted to be near her,'' Ms. Allen said. ''She's always been kind of like my protector.'' Almost as soon as she arrived there, Ms. Allen was chosen for the lead female role, Nurse Ratched, in a production of ''One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.'' She also played Linda Loman in ''Death of a Salesman.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Allen raised her fist in the air over her chicken stew. ''None dast blame this man!'' she recited, grandly. ''I think that back then I must have lacked something in life experience to play Willy Loman's wife. But I don't know, there's also something about throwing your heart and soul into a role. The role is always teaching you something.''</p>
        <p>It was at Eastern Illinois that Ms. Allen met a fellow acting student, John Malkovich, who later went to Chicago to help found the now legendary Steppenwolf Theater. When, after two years, Ms. Allen transferred to Northern Illinois University, nearer Chicago, Mr. Malkovich persuaded her to come into the city one summer and do a play with Steppenwolf, ''Our Late Night'' by Wallace Shawn.</p>
        <p>''I was really scared about going into the big city by myself,'' she said. ''If it hadn't been for Steppenwolf, I don't know if I ever would have done it.''</p>
        <p>Like the others in the company, Ms. Allen made no money from her acting and was forced to take jobs as a secretary to pay her meager bills. Unlike others in the troupe, she refused to be a waitress. ''I knew I couldn't do it,'' she said. ''I was never good with the public. I was too frightened.''</p>
        <p>In 1983 she went to New York and has since never lived anywhere else, nor does she wish to. The big city doesn't scare her so much anymore, she said. Nor does she feel the burning need to act out on the stage night after night.</p>
        <p>''Back in those days, the more tortured the character, the happier I was,'' she said.</p>
        <p>But the intense stress of those back-to-back roles in ''Burn This'' (opposite Mr. Malkovich) and ''The Heidi Chronicles'' were, in a way, too much. She appeared in one more stage production after that, with Steppenwolf, but that was the last.</p>
        <p>''I think I just prefer not to do it at this point,'' she said. ''I used to be interested in doing the same thing every night, finding ways to do the role differently, having fun with it. But I stopped being interested in it.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Allen was in Southern California to attend the premiere of ''The Contender''; do some interviews; visit her sister, who lives in San Diego; and then travel up to the Mill Valley Film Festival north of San Francisco, where she was honored with a retrospective of her work.</p>
        <p>She recently finished shooting a role, the villain, in a mini-series based on ''The Mists of Avalon,'' a novel by Marion Zimmer Bradley in which the King Arthur legend is told from the point of view of its women. ''I get to be pretty mean in this,'' she said, ''It was fun to do.''</p>
        <p>But after that she is wide open. Perhaps, if ''The Contender'' is well received and if there are more accolades and awards, she will be able to do more leading roles, to have the stories continue to swirl around her. Certainly, she said, all of this early Oscar talk is a good sign.</p>
        <p>''It's an indication that people are responding positively,'' she said. ''I hope people go see this movie. But really, it's a little too early to tell how it will all come out.''</p>
