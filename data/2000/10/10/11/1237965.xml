        <p>Negotiations for Kozmo.com to buy Urbanfetch.com have officially ended after more than three months of discussions, officials said yesterday. A tentative deal had been reached last week. But on Monday, officials said that Gerry Burdo, Kozmo's president and acting chief executive, had raised concerns as early as last Thursday, after reviewing Urbanfetch's books in London. One senior Urbanfetch executive disputed that account, saying that Kozmo officials had had access to most of those records for three months. The two companies, both based in New York, deliver goods ordered online.</p>
