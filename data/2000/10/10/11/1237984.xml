        <p>If there is a most important factor in winning a postseason series, Mets Manager Bobby Valentine said he has not seen it. Just after he said that, though, Valentine offered insight into what could be a crucial matchup in the National League Championship Series, which begins Wednesday night between the Mets and the Cardinals.</p>
        <p>''I think the bullpen often helps,'' Valentine said. ''But there's nothing to take the place of three-run home runs.''</p>
        <p>That is precisely what the world's most fearsome pinch-hitter will try to deliver this series, probably against the Mets' bullpen. Mark McGwire is limited to a pinch-hitting role because of patellar tendinitis in his right knee, and his presence will loom over this series.</p>
        <p>''It's a whole X-factor,'' Valentine said. ''I suspect that he will be used for that one at-bat in any situation during the game that could give them an advantage offensively. He is, without a doubt, a force. It is a lot less predictable having him on the bench.</p>
        <p>''I don't think he is just a guy in the right-hand column for pinch-hitters here that you can define their role.''</p>
        <p>Valentine has the right weapons to combat McGwire, at least if history is a guide. Armando Benitez, Dennis Cook, John Franco and Turk Wendell have combined to hold McGwire to one single in 25 career at-bats, and the Mets' bullpen is coming together at the right time. ''The one thing I've learned in my playoff experience is, as a pitcher, if you get on a roll, you can sustain that roll,'' said Cook, who has not allowed a run in 15 innings over 15 career postseason games. ''Wendell's on a good roll, Johnny, Armando. Those are the things that can propel you through a whole playoff.''</p>
        <p>Of course, good pitching does not guarantee postseason success. No team came into the playoffs with a hotter late-inning relief combination than the San Francisco Giants. But Felix Rodriguez faltered in Game 2 of the division series, Robb Nen blew a save for the first time in four months in Game 3, and the Mets dumped the Giants in four games.</p>
        <p>In 1998 and '99, the Texas Rangers got outstanding efforts from their pitchers in the first playoff round, but their offense was futile and the Yankees swept them both years.</p>
        <p>Mets first baseman Todd Zeile, who was on those Rangers teams, said teams enter the postseason expecting to have good pitching.</p>
        <p>''Our pitching should be solid, and the key in these games is going to be whether we're able to get the hits,'' Zeile said. ''They had great pitching, and they kept us down the last series.''</p>
        <p>Zeile was referring to the Mets' three-game series at Busch Stadium last month, when the Cardinals swept them with three victories in their final at-bat. After Garrett Stephenson, who is out for this series with elbow tendinitis, gave up five runs in five innings of the first game, seven Cardinals pitchers held the Mets to four runs over the final 24 innings of the series.</p>
        <p>Darryl Kile was particularly stingy, giving up one run, five hits and no walks in a complete-game victory. Kile has stymied many of the Mets throughout his career, and when he starts Wednesday, he will have an admirer in his counterpart, his former teammate on the Houston Astros and the Mets' Game 1 starter, Mike Hampton.</p>
        <p>''When he was struggling,'' Hampton said, alluding to Kile's miserable two-year stint in Colorado in 1998 and '99, ''I told him, 'Man, I will trade stuff with you in a second.' He's that good.</p>
        <p>''Being in Coors Field, I think it was a little more mental than physical. But as long as he is mentally strong, he is one of the toughest pitchers in the game. It's a tough test for our hitters, and it's going to be a tough test for me as well, because I know the chances are that there won't be a whole lot of runs scored.''</p>
        <p>In the end, Valentine said, starting Hampton on Wednesday was an easy choice; there was no need to discuss other options, he said. Al Leiter will start Game 2, Rick Reed Game 3 and Bobby J. Jones Game 4, Valentine said. That arrangement leaves Glendon Rusch in the bullpen, despite his fine performance against the Cardinals this year (two earned runs in 14 innings). Rusch and Cook will be interchangeable in this series, which Valentine likes.</p>
        <p>''If I use one a lot in one game, you have the same opportunity the next day to use a left-hander a lot, for two innings,'' Valentine said.</p>
        <p>The Mets held off on announcing their other decisions, like the formation of their N.L.C.S. roster, which must be submitted by 10 a.m. Wednesday. Either the long reliever Pat Mahomes or the utilityman Matt Franco will take the spot of the injured outfielder Derek Bell, with Mahomes more likely to be selected.</p>
        <p>The other matter is the Mets' starting lineup, which Valentine has apparently decided on but would not announce. He did say, however, that the same starters from the last three playoff games would be used Wednesday, and that Zeile would not bat seventh. Zeile has hit .300 (15 for 50) in his career against Kile, with three home runs.</p>
        <p>Then again, matchups might not mean much, even the Cardinals' supposed disadvantage against left-handed starters. After all, Mets outfielder Darryl Hamilton said, ''these guys beat the mighty Braves three straight.''</p>
        <p>His point is that if St. Louis can do that to Atlanta, the Mets' most feared rival, anything can happen.</p>
        <p>''It basically boils down to, if you are on that day, regardless if you are right- or left-handed, you've got to like your chances,'' Hampton said. ''But any pitcher can get hit, proven in the last series they had against the Braves.''</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>Cardinals center fielder JIM EDMONDS has not forgotten the avalanche of rumors this spring that had him going to the Yankees. ''I got to the point where I was wondering if I was going to live in the city or out of the city,'' Edmonds said.</p>
