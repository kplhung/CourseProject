        <p>Re ''Israelis Extend Deadline for Arafat to Quell Violence'' (front page, Oct. 10):</p>
        <p>I urge President Clinton to call for a six-month recess in the negotiations. I suggest that Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel could accept that recess, and announce that Israel is taking all of its proposals off the table so that his government might review them in the light of the present impasse and violence.</p>
        <p>Israel should also use this recess to begin to recognize and correct its failure adequately to incorporate its Arab citizens into its political, economic and social democratic fabric. It is time for all the parties, including our own government, to pause, consider and re-evaluate how best to achieve peace and stability in the area.</p>
        <p>I would further suggest that President Clinton announce his decision to transfer our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, Israel's capital. This step would be timely and clear-cut.</p>
