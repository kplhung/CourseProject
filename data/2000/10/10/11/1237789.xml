        <p>WHEN I was a car salesman, I wore cowboy boots to work. I did not wear a gun. The retired police officer in the cubicle next to mine did wear a gun. He never took it out, but you could see the bump the Glock made under his suit jacket when he leaned forward.</p>

        <p>WHEN I was a car salesman, I wore cowboy boots to work. I did not wear a gun. The retired police officer in the cubicle next to mine did wear a gun. He never took it out, but you could see the bump the Glock made under his suit jacket when he leaned forward.</p>
        <p>We were cowboys, and it felt good, although one of the facts lost in the mists of time was how little cash cowboys actually earned. In any case, we were supposed to be in control. Just for starters, we wanted to be there. Most customers did not. They didn't want to be wrangled. They just wanted to buy a car cheaply and painlessly and then escape.</p>
        <p>Haggling for transport is an ancient tradition, handed down from horse traders to the automotive sales counselors of today. The tradition will certainly be altered, and perhaps even done away with, as the pricing information once closely held by dealers becomes available to everybody with Internet access.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, buying a car can still involve some highly adversarial negotiations. Here are some tips from a former cowpoke.</p>
        <p>DO THE HOMEWORK -- As salesmen we were taught never to mention price until we had gotten our particular head of cattle corralled, and the customer was in love with the vehicle. We memorized four bypasses. ''I can appreciate your concern for price. It is certainly an important consideration. However. . . . '' And three more like that.</p>
        <p>Today, the prepared customer can turn this process upside down. Consumer Reports magazine advises readers to use its New Car Price Service, spending $9.95 to get the dealer's price or the invoice on the car they want. Here is where you're supposed to start negotiating, instead of trying to come down from the sticker or ''manufacturer's suggested retail price.''</p>
        <p>A $12 report -- faxed, e-mailed or sent by regular mail to the consumer -- will also include information on dealer holdbacks and incentives. These figures let the buyer know when the dealer begins to make a profit, the amount of profit taken being the subject of negotiation. This service, which became available through the mail 18 years ago, can be activated by phoning (800) 205-2445 or by visiting www.consumerreports.org.</p>
        <p>I remember seeing a colleague spend time with a woman who was toting a manila envelope bulging with research. When I grilled him later about the ''up'' -- prospects were called ''ups'' because of the ''up'' sheet we filled out -- he said: ''I'd like to put her through the window. She knows more about the car than I do. How you going to sell a person like that?''</p>
        <p>As Michael Morrissey, the director of public relations for the National Automobile Dealers Association, said: ''More and more customers are better informed as to the pricing structure of the vehicle. The Internet is a big driver of that.''</p>
        <p>Consumer Reports was a pioneer in this area, but now you can use almost any search engine. Type in a phrase like ''new car invoice prices,'' and follow your nose. ''In a very quick count we found that there are at least 50 places online where you can get the invoice price,'' Mr. Morrissey said.</p>
        <p>DO THE MATH -- As a former salesman, I can't stress enough the importance of performing your own calculations. You may agree on what seems like a reasonable price for the car, but then be presented with a monthly payment that actually represents a much higher price. I have seen it done.</p>
        <p>Most salesmen are eager to write down the charges included in the purchase and also your monthly payment. The packet sent out by Consumer Reports will help you determine which charges are legitimate. I have seen managers think up an additional item, name it and then bill the consumer.</p>
        <p>But even after you have assayed your expenses, you should multiply that monthly payment out over the length of the contract, and see what the total is.</p>
        <p>One young couple came in to buy a Pontiac Grand Prix, which we had advertised at a sharp discount, but it was gone when they reached the showroom. ''We can give you a comparable value on another vehicle,'' the manager assured them. It wasn't until they had left the building that I did the math and discovered that the second vehicle was going to cost thousands of dollars more than the customers thought they were paying.</p>
        <p>''I told them it was a comparable value,'' the manager said. ''Comparable.''</p>
        <p>So I would advise anybody considering the purchase of a new car to come to the showroom equipped with many grains of salt. And don't be afraid to walk out. They will take you back. If they don't, somebody else will.</p>
        <p>IT'S A FREE-FOR-ALL -- It's also important to keep in mind, however, that this is an ancient game, and that the salesmen don't always win. ''Buyers are liars,'' we used to say, and I certainly got bamboozled more than once.</p>
        <p>I spent tiresome afternoons with people who were simply fishing for a low quote that they could then take to a dealership nearer their home, where they had always intended to make the purchase. Three different car buyers hinted noisily that they would offer me another, better job, after the sale. They all bought cars, but no jobs materialized.</p>
        <p>Most of the people I meet at cocktail parties grow choleric at the mention of a car showroom, but there are consumers who love it, and eat your average salesman for breakfast. Remember this the next time you grow pale with indignation about the salesman whom you caught in a lie.</p>
        <p>Remember also that like cowboys, most car salesmen are not rich. The dealership that I worked at calculated my wages based on a percentage of the markup. The percentage of profits to which the salesman is entitled goes up as the profit does, but in many dealerships, the salesman's entire salary is a portion of the markup. So if you bought a car from me at dealer invoice, I would be entitled to a percentage of nothing.</p>
        <p>This never happened, although one pleasant couple who had been talking about hiring me for their antiques business became furious when their new Oldsmobile's engine light came on unnecessarily. I saw them waiting in the lounge while the car was being serviced and sat with them. ''You made your money,'' the woman said, practically trembling with rage.</p>
        <p>It would have been more appropriate if I had been the indignant one. They'd bargained us down to a price just $151 over the invoice. They had done it the old-fashioned way -- pushed. Fortunately, Oldsmobile was offering a $1,000 incentive, which they did not know about, and which we discreetly had not mentioned. So we were anticipating a profit of $1,151. Still, they got us, because when they closed the deal, they took the G.M.A.C. 3 percent financing. You can't get the special financing and also the $1,000, so our gross profit plummeted to $151, of which I would earn 20 percent, or a shade more than $30. ''You got a good price on that car,'' I told them. They didn't believe me.</p>
        <p>FIND A PERSONAL SHOPPER -- Consumers Automotive, in Fairfax, Va., is a service for people who would just as soon not get messy in the showroom. Its founder, James A. Boerger, worked for a leasing company for three years before starting his business 13 years ago. Unlike many auto-buying services, he does not take any money from dealers. He shops all over the country, using only the phone, and does the haggling for you. This service costs $295 for cars worth up to $30,000 and $395 for those costing more. ''WE keep you OUT of the dealership because that KEEPS YOU OUT OF HARM'S WAY!'' its flier reads.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, the figures provided on the Web are ''just another place to start,'' Mr. Boerger said. Even buyers who have done their homework are often worn down by trained salesmen; knowledge may be power, but it doesn't make you an hombre. ''I am convinced,'' he said, ''that most consumers buy a new car from the dealership they happen to be at when their patience has finally run out.''</p>
        <p>Both Consumers Automotive (800-937-4674) and Consumer Reports magazine provide valuable services for customers who do not relish the battle of the showroom. And both say they have saved people thousands of dollars on the average car purchase.</p>
        <p>Even those who fight the battle of the showroom are often doing it on different terms today. ''Because of the added transparency many dealers are willing to share the invoice pricing in a very upfront fashion with consumers,'' said Mr. Morrissey, of the dealers' association. While the industry remains profitable, he told me, generally speaking the dealer margins have shrunk. ''There isn't as much room to negotiate as there has been.''</p>
        <p>So is this the end of an era? Are car salesmen, with their cowboy boots and billowing double-breasted jackets going to vanish over the horizon in a cloud of cologne? And if so, how much will we miss them? Who knows? Maybe cowboys weren't much fun to be around, either.</p>
