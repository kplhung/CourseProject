        <p>Lucent Technologies warned investors yesterday that earnings would fall short of already lowered expectations as competitors gnaw away at the company's business in several areas.</p>
        <p>The manufacturer of telecommunications equipment, which is based in Murray Hill, N.

        <p>Lucent Technologies warned investors yesterday that earnings would fall short of already lowered expectations as competitors gnaw away at the company's business in several areas.</p>
        <p>The manufacturer of telecommunications equipment, which is based in Murray Hill, N. J., said it expected to report earnings of 17 to 18 cents a share for its fiscal fourth quarter, which ended Sept. 30. For the quarter a year earlier, the company posted per-share earnings of 24 cents.</p>
        <p>The warning was the latest disappointment from Lucent, which has revised earnings estimates downward three times in the last year.</p>
        <p>Analysts had expected the company to earn 27 cents a share in the quarter, according to a survey by First Call/Thomson Financial, which tracks corporate earnings.</p>
        <p>Shares of Lucent had closed at $31.38 in regular trading, down $1, but plummeted after the warning was issued to as low as $24 in unusually heavy after-hours trading. Shares of Lucent have declined more than 55 percent so far this year.</p>
        <p>Once the shining star of the telecommunications equipment industry after AT&amp;T spun it off in 1996, Lucent has recently been struggling to compete in two of the hottest areas of the industry, the markets for big router boxes that handle Internet traffic and optical networking systems.</p>
        <p>In the router business, companies like Cisco Systems and Juniper Networks have emerged as leaders, while Nortel Networks, the fast-growing Canadian infrastructure company, and numerous newly public companies dominate optical networking.</p>
        <p>''It is clear that Lucent must undertake a major retooling of the business,'' Richard A. McGinn, the company's chairman and chief executive, said in a conference call with investors.</p>
        <p>Lucent largely attributed the profit warning to shrinking revenue at its fiberoptic equipment and Internet-switching operations, in addition to larger provisions for questionable debts from companies that have received financing from Lucent to purchase its equipment.</p>
        <p>''Lucent's undergoing a dramatic erosion of its market dominance,'' said Michael Neiberg, an analyst covering telecommunications infrastructure companies at Chase H &amp; Q. ''There's the perception that they need to react a lot more quickly to recoup these losses.''</p>
        <p>Lucent is already seeking to restructure its operations by focusing on fast-growing areas like fiber optic equipment and network systems. As part of its restructuring plans the company spun off its enterprise networks group, which began trading independently last week under the name Avaya.</p>
        <p>Lucent also plans to spin off its microelectronics division into a separate company, even though it was one of its fastest-growing units in the three-month period ending in September.</p>
        <p>According to a company statement, revenue at its microelectronics and communications technologies group climbed more than 50 percent, compared with the year-earlier quarter.</p>
        <p>''If Lucent would have restructured a year ago it would have dodged the bullet,'' said Jeffrey Kagan, an independent telecommunications analyst. ''Instead, they got caught in the trap of focusing on the orders of today instead of preparing for the orders of tomorrow.''</p>
        <p>In a telecommunications world that seems to have been turned upside down in recent months, small companies that are seeking to supply the technology needed to handle huge amounts of voice and data traffic as networks increasingly become Web-and wireless-centric have become the darlings of investors.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, telecommunications giants like AT&amp;T, in the long-distance business; Nokia, the highflying Finnish wireless communications company; and Lucent, in the equipment industry, have come under pressure.</p>
        <p>Illustrating Lucent's woes, the company's market share of the optical networking industry fell to 15 percent from 19 percent from the first to second quarters of the year. Figures from the Dell'Oro Group show Nortel Network's share of the optical networking industry grew to 43 percent from 37 percent, in the same period.</p>
        <p>Shares in Lucent have declined by nearly two-thirds from a record high of $84.19 last December, shaving more than $160 billion from the company's market value.</p>
        <p>''It's downright painful,'' said Brian Hayward, who manages the $3.6 billion Invesco Telecommunications Fund in Denver. ''Management gets on the horn and we hear all this restructuring blah-blah-blah. The company leadership is providing very little substance on what's behind their problems.''</p>
        <p>Under Mr. McGinn, who was named Lucent's chief executive in 1997, the company has issued three profit warnings this year and expects to trim targets for sales and earnings next year. Perhaps not surprisingly, speculation has grown on Wall Street that Lucent is searching for a replacement for Mr. McGinn. The company declined to comment on such a move, while Mr. McGinn was not available for comment.</p>
