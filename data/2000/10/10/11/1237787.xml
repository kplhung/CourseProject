        <p>I HAVE heard people speak of America's love affair with the automobile, and I have never understood. Over the years, I have suffered house envy and income envy, but never car envy.</p>
        <p>Porsche or Pontiac, BMW or Beetle, cars are not our friends. They are expensive. They pollute. They break down. I think of cars as a necessary evil, foisted on me by the isolation of quasi-rural living and the lack of public transportation.</p>
        <p>So I amazed myself recently by falling in love with a car.</p>
        <p>It was a 1910 Buick Surrey, cream-colored, with a mahogany dashboard and brass fittings, a Harpo-style horn and an open cab. It had a hand crank, huge wheels with painted wooden spokes, skinny tires, black quilted-leather seats and an enormous steering column on the right (as in the wrong) side.</p>
        <p>I encountered this stunner here in Bennington, at the headquarters of Hemmings Motor News (''The 'bible' of the old car hobby since 1954''), where a summer press event offered journalists an opportunity to drive vintage cars. I tried out half a dozen from various decades -- including a 1999 Sparrow electric car -- and found out something I had forgotten since I was 17 and the proud new holder of a license: driving can be a ton of fun.</p>
        <p>Of course, it is a lot more fun on a glorious Vermont day, with a nicely catered breakfast under one's belt and a personal driving teacher -- in the form of Justus Taylor, a former motorcycle racer and consultant to Hemmings -- at one's side. Mr. Taylor, an unflappable 60-year-old who exudes competence, helped me put each car through its paces on a picturesque stretch of macadam just next to Hemmings's headquarters.</p>
        <p>With his help, I figured out the trick to driving the Surrey: its ''planetary transmission'' (don't ask, it's complicated) requires the driver to depress the clutch and leave it depressed to get it into first gear or reverse, a counterintuitive move for anyone who drives a standard today. Second gear is engaged by using a long, thin brass lever on the driver's side. It has no third gear.</p>
        <p>After Mr. Taylor cranked the engine to life, I bucked into first gear, muscled the steering wheel into submission, and we were off. The ride? Like roller-skating down a rock-lined track. Handling? A prior course in weight lifting would have helped. Speed and acceleration? Zero to 40 in, maybe, 5 or 10 minutes. (Mr. Taylor said 25 seconds. It seemed longer.) Brakes? Ha! (Or, as Mr. Taylor diplomatically described them,  ''Marginally effective.'')</p>
        <p>And yet it was thrilling. A car like the Surrey keeps the driver totally engaged. Feet pumping on the gas and clutch, arms straining at the steering wheel and gear levers, all of me -- mind and body -- was involved in the machine. Cars today -- with their compact disc players and cell phones, adjustable seats and climate control -- seem designed to keep us a step removed from what we're actually doing: that is, driving.</p>
        <p>Behind the wheel of the Surrey, I felt that I was going somewhere, and like a cross-country runner, I was aware of every mile covered. Not since I was 17, when terror, inexperience and the thrill of liberation informed my driving, has going somewhere seemed so appealing.</p>
        <p>As I worked my way through the decades, the cars became more comfortable and more technologically advanced: a 1928 Model AR Ford roadster pickup had brake lights, a light switch on the steering column, a horn button and a primitive temperature gauge (actually, a thermometer placed on the radiator cap). A 1934 Brewster town car with a teardrop grille and an enclosed rear-passenger cab had a V-8 engine and could reach 70 miles an hour. The passenger compartment offered a little button to buzz the driver. It had been owned, I was told, by a Rockefeller, who sold it to a Vanderbilt.</p>
        <p>A '56 Ford Fairlane Sunliner, in two tones of blue, had an AM radio, heater, cigarette lighter, glove compartment and a clock on the dashboard, which replicated the sleek, futuristic look of a 50's diner. It had an automatic two-speed transmission and a power top.</p>
        <p>But when it came to a luxury car, the 1958 Dual-Ghia 400 won my vote.</p>
        <p>A prototype built by the Dual Motors Company of Detroit and designed by Carrozzeria Ghia of Turin, Italy, this beauty commanded everyone's attention. Long and sleek, black and yellow, it is owned by Fred Kanter, the president of Kanter Auto Products of Boonton, N.J., who drove it to Hemmings for the event and allowed strangers like me behind the wheel.</p>
        <p>IT featured a push-button automatic transmission, four bucket seats, a record player (the Hi-Way Hi-Fi) and enough room to hold the College of Cardinals. I was told that it could reach 140 miles per hour. The ride was so smooth I could imagine a glass of Campari and soda balanced perfectly on the console.</p>
        <p>I finished my day in the Sparrow, made by CorbinMotors.com in Hollister, Calif. It was a spunky, three-wheel, candy-apple-red electric car with a shape reminiscent of a baby shoe. Buzzing down the road was like driving inside a large motorcycle helmet.</p>
        <p>With each vehicle, I felt as if I were donning a new costume and persona. In the '28 pickup, I was a migrant truck farmer in dust-covered overalls. In the Brewster -- a drab black vehicle with a vaguely threatening look, like the cars Nazis drive in World War II movies -- I was Marlene Dietrich, cracking a riding crop impatiently on the leather seats. In the Fairlane: Annette Funicello, post-Mickey Mouse Club. In the Dual-Ghia, Sophia Loren, senz'altro, on my way to a film opening. The electric Sparrow? Ralph Nader, of course.</p>
        <p>At the end of the day, heading home in my 1996 Subaru Outback, I felt only like myself: a middle-aged mother with groceries to buy and teenagers to take to music lessons and hockey games. But for many days afterward, I kept returning to my 20 minutes in that 1910 Buick Surrey. Behind that oversize wheel, working that impossible clutch, I was 17 again, alive to all challenges and focused only on the road ahead. What better fantasy than that?</p>
