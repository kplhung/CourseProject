        <p>After an eight-day strike, maintenance workers at 532 apartment buildings in Westchester County reached an agreement yesterday with building owners, the lawyer for the owners said.</p>
        <p>The workers, from Local 32E of the Service Employees International Union, will receive a 4 percent increase in compensation per year for the three years that began Oct. 1, said Matthew Persanis, the lawyer for the owners' group, the Building and Realty Institute of Westchester and the Mid-Hudson Region.</p>
        <p>Under the contract, wages will increase 3.2 percent per year, while fringe benefits will increase 8 percent per year, Mr. Persanis said.</p>
