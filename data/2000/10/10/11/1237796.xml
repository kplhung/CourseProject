        <p>THE first Thunderbird was inspired by a visit to the 1951 Paris auto show by Lewis Crusoe, a Ford Motor Company executive, and the designer George Walker.</p>
        <p>Time magazine once called Mr. Walker ''the Cellini of chrome.'' At Ford, he created a clean and classic European sports car, a low-slung two-seater that combined a Ferrari-style grille with tail fins and rocket-thruster taillights. The Thunderbird could hardly have looked more different from the bulbous, bourgeois postwar sedans that people associated with Ford.</p>
        <p>The car went on sale in the 1955 model year. What it meant to Ford could be seen in a magazine advertisement not for the Thunderbird, but for a conventional family sedan, the Fairlane.</p>
        <p>The Thunderbird's ''long low lines have caused a sensation on the highways as has no car styling before it,'' the advertisement read. But if you need a family car, it went on, buy a Fairlane: ''it features the same sleek silhouette . . . the same beautiful design, front and rear.''</p>
        <p>Thunderbird was one of the first examples of a phenomenon that automakers have used regularly, often with stunning success, to pull themselves from lethargy: the halo car. The halo is the excitement that the new car creates for the company and its entire line of models. Lure buyers into the showroom with a sexy car, then sell them other models. Drawn by the car they want, they  buy the car they need.</p>
        <p>The first Thunderbird evoked European savoir-faire and jet age streamlining. Other halo cars have evoked nostalgia: Volkswagen's New Beetle, introduced in 1998, updated the look of its old one. The Audi TT, introduced last year, includes elements of the Auto Union racing cars of the 1930's and the first Porsches. Chrysler's PT Cruiser, new this year, combines elements of a woody wagon with a gangster car.</p>
        <p>So it is fitting that the newest halo car is a Thunderbird. To J. Mays, Ford's vice president for design, the 2002 T-Bird, a V-8 convertible to be sold next spring, is nothing less than ''the first car pertinent to the rebirth and redefinition of the Ford brand.''</p>
        <p>The new T-Bird looks like the 1955 model, with softer, more rounded lines. And while Fords of the future may not resemble it as closely as the 1955 Fairlane resembled the 1955 T-Bird, Mr. Mays said, ''if you fast-forward to what a Ford showroom will look like in three years, it will be a good fit; there will be a little Thunderbird in every Ford.''</p>
        <p>No amount of stylistic polishing, of course, can make up for functional failures. Halo cars can go only so far to improve a company image, said James Hall, the vice president for industry analysis at AutoPacific, a consulting group. It took many years  before Audi, for example, could put behind the ''sudden acceleration'' controversy sparked by a segment on CBS's ''60 Minutes'' regarding the company's 5000 model. (In 1989, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration concluded that driver error was the main source of the problem.)</p>
        <p>But images of the new Thunderbird can burnish the Ford oval only so much as the company tries to confront problems with a computerized ignition system that has caused some cars to stall or the tire failure associated with the Explorer.</p>
        <p>Halos exist in other industries; consider Apple Computer's iMac. ''We call them silver-bullet products,'' said Barry Shepherd, a founder of SHR Perceptual Management, which advises companies on design and brand image, or ''visual positioning.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mays once worked at SHR, which provided research and other advice to Volkswagen regarding its New Beetle, the most successful halo car in recent years. Along with the much-praised ''Drivers Wanted'' advertising campaign, the New Beetle turned Volkswagen into a hot company: although other Volkswagens -- Golfs, Jettas, Passats -- did not resemble the New Beetle, their sales began to pick up.</p>
        <p>As American cars have caught up to Japanese and European cars in performance and quality, assets like appearance and personality have become important to buyers. This is where Ford needs a lift. After the well-received ''aero'' Taurus of the mid-1980's, since redesigned along more conventional lines, Ford has struggled to find a consistent design philosophy.</p>
        <p>What other new models will share with the T-Bird, Mr. Mays said, are cues more subtle than the tail fins or taillights of the 50's. ''The cars will share a confident, relaxed, optimistic look,'' he said. ''Think back to Henry Ford and you see a theme: a democratic, populist and accessible automobile as opposed, for instance, to a colder, elitist type of European vehicle.''</p>
        <p>Despite the sensation it stirred up in 1955, the Thunderbird evolved swiftly, and not for the better. The sports-car market was small, and the two-seater was soon enlarged. Over the years, it grew into a full-sized ''personal luxury'' coupe. But its sales slipped, and it was discontinued in 1997.</p>
        <p>Ford executives, however, knew the car would make a comeback. Designers were already working on a model that would share the basic structure of the Lincoln LS, Jaguar S-type and Mercury Cougar models. Advising them was Mr. Mays, who had left Volkswagen, where he designed the New Beetle, to work for SHR. He said he helped edit the work of four design teams into a common approach for the new T-Bird. In 1997, he accepted the top design job at Ford.</p>
        <p>THE new Thunderbird is intended to offer a spiritual summary of the car's history, an anthology of its most noted features. From different model years, Mr. Mays and the design team have chosen different features: the air vents along the side, the porthole window, the round taillights, the grille.</p>
        <p>But the most direct expression of the car's attitude, Mr. Mays said, is its stance -- how the shape is poised on its wheels. ''It's a reverse wedge, with the tail lower than the front, a falling-backwards stance,'' he said. ''It's like flopping into a La-Z-Boy recliner or settling back on the saddle of a Fat Boy Harley-Davidson motorcycle.'' The goal is to evoke the optimism of the 1950's through what he calls ''upbeat, smooth, uncluttered and warm'' shapes. This overt appeal to buyers' psychology is not new. In the 50's, Dr. Ernest Dichter, the founder of the Institute for Motivational Research, advised carmakers to apply Freudian psychology to motivate buyers by tuning into their needs and insecurities. Today, psychologizing is again in demand. Chrysler consulted Dr. Clotaire Rapaille, a French-born anthropologist, in designing the PT Cruiser. His job was to identify what he has called ''the reptilian hot buttons'' of car design that evoke primal buyer reactions.</p>
        <p>On Jan. 3, 1999, with many members of the intended audience stranded in airports by a snowstorm, Mr. Mays and Jacques Nasser, Ford's chief executive, drove the bright yellow Thunderbird concept car onto a stage at the Detroit Auto Show. Those who did not make it to the display could not miss the television and print coverage, or a publicity campaign that included distribution of thousands of thick press kits.</p>
        <p>By summer, Ford was ferrying the concept cars -- one red, one yellow -- to the audience most sensitive to its past: Thunderbird owner clubs.</p>
        <p>At one event, near Suffern, N.Y., in July 1999, Thunderbirds of all years gathered, small white '56 models and long burgundy 67's, chunky 63's and aerodynamic 83's. Thunderbird souvenirs were sold. One family had carved a totem pole of Thunderbird logos. Many owners had their old T-Birds photographed beside the new one, which is expected to start at $35,000.</p>
        <p>But the potential buyer of the new Thunderbird is not the owner of the old. Ford used the car clubs to raise interest in the new Thunderbird, but it hopes the car can attract young, more affluent drivers. This summer, Ford sent three vintage T-Birds on a tour of 144 cities. A Web site offered the public a chance to win the cars in a drawing.</p>
        <p>In August, to further attach the Thunderbird to history and build cachet, Ford rolled out a Neiman Marcus catalog special edition model at the Concours d'Elegance in Pebble Beach, Calif. Scarcity is also a proven marketing technique: only 200 of the black-and-silver special edition T-Birds will be made. (Neiman Marcus has a long association with the Thunderbird. In 1971, it offered matching his-and-hers models, each with an eight-track cassette player.)</p>
        <p>Whether all this will make the T-Bird a successful halo car remains to be seen. For every New Beetle, there is a failure: Cadillac's Allante, Subaru's SVX. The PT Cruiser is selling well, but its appeal does not seem to extend to other Chrysler models. The retro hot-rod Plymouth Prowler has actually outlived the brand it was supposed make shine and will likely end up simply as a Chrysler.</p>
        <p>In the end, the mark of success is when a halo car seeps out into the wider culture, becoming a marker in films, videos, advertising and illustrations.</p>
        <p>The persistent romance of the 1955 Thunderbird was recently illustrated by a pink one on the cover of a best-selling romantic novel by Anne Rivers Siddon.</p>
        <p>But the new T-Bird may already be making its mark. Over the summer, The New York Observer commissioned the satiric artist Drew Friedman to caricature Vice President Al Gore and United States Senator Joseph I. Lieberman at the Democratic National Convention. He showed them both wearing sunglasses and in a red Thunderbird with the top down, the giant Hollywood sign in the background.</p>
        <p>''That's the Thunderbird?'' Mr. Friedman replied recently when asked why he chose the car. He had simply pulled the image from a reference file. ''I didn't' know what it was,'' he said. ''I just chose it because it looked cool and Hollywood.''</p>
