        <p>NANCY C. GOULD has an obsession that has become a family affair.</p>
        <p>Every week, she and her husband, Charles, a lawyer, tinker on the engines of her 30 postwar microcars and minicars, which are essentially enclosed scooters. They pile their daughters Monique, 4, and Tiana, 2, into the three- and four-wheel European vehicles for errands, preschool events and car club rallies.</p>
        <p>''The kids love them and my husband was the crazy person who introduced me to this addiction,'' said Ms. Gould, a 42-year-old accountant. Among the smallest production cars ever made, some can hit 100 miles per hour, but most average 50 m.p.h. at top speed. ''Micro- and minicars multiply spontaneously because once you have one, you have to have more,'' Ms. Gould added. ''But they're not about polishing and trophies, they're about fun and meeting new people.''</p>
        <p>In 1988, Ms. Gould, also a motorcyclist, saw her first microcar at a vintage car festival. ''I fell in love with the silly looking, egg-shaped BMW Isetta 300,'' she recalled. ''It was the cuteness factor.''</p>
        <p>But it was the war-recovery effort that led British, French, Italian and German manufacturers to produce them, mostly from 1954 through 1964. ''They helped Europe get back on wheels,'' Ms. Gould said.</p>
        <p>Microcars, less than eight feet long, and minicars, less than 13 feet long, have one- or two-cylinder scooter or motorcycle engines. At the time they were made, they were fuel efficient, kept out the weather and were very affordable -- about $600, which was around half the price of a new Volkswagen Beetle. They also helped German aircraft makers -- barred from military work -- keep factories operating. Aviation engineers, meanwhile, came up with bodies, parts and technology that enabled teensy engines to transport two to four people at reasonable speeds.</p>
        <p>Among Ms. Gould's favorites are the 1955 Messerschmitt Kabinenroller KR 200 with its aircraft steering bar, acrylic dome top and, she gleefully added, ''nine pounding horsepower.'' She is also smitten with the Invacar, which has hand controls and was initially issued by the British government for disabled people.</p>
        <p>From Nov. 16 through April 23, an exhibition at the Larz Anderson Museum in Brookline, Mass., will feature several of Ms. Gould's cars.</p>
        <p>With sensible price tags of $2,000 to $5,000, Ms. Gould said, ''Micro- and minicars offer more smiles per dollar.''</p>
