        <p>A Serbian journalist, Miroslav Filipovic, walked free from a military prison here today, the first political prisoner to be released since the democratic opposition wrested power from Slobodan Milosevic last week.</p>
        <p>The Supreme Military Court in Belgrade ordered his release pending a retrial, ruling that his trial had serious violations of legal procedure. The new leadership of Yugoslavia under President Vojislav Kostunica appears to have influenced the decision, because it released news that Mr. Filipovic would be freed the day before the ruling.</p>
        <p>Sentenced to seven years and imprisoned five months ago for reporting on Yugoslav Army war crimes in Kosovo, Mr. Filipovic was one of three Serbian political prisoners who rights groups and democratic leaders said were victims of Mr. Milosevic's increasingly vindictive government.</p>
        <p>Some 700 ethnic Albanians from Kosovo are also in Serbian jails, a majority considered political prisoners because they were arbitrarily detained in the conflict last year in Kosovo. In perhaps the most serious case, the whereabouts of former President Ivan Stambolic of Yugoslavia, who was abducted a month ago, remain unknown. His wife and his lawyer have said Mr. Milosevic is behind his disappearance.</p>
        <p>Since Oct. 5, when Mr. Milosevic's power crumbled in the face of public outrage, Barbara Davis, the representative of the United Nations high commissioner for human rights, and other rights advocates have appealed to the new leaders to focus on victims of rights abuses.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kostunica has not issued an amnesty but has said he wants politics out of the courtroom, a European diplomat said.</p>
        <p>The appeals have resulted in the releases without charges of seven European foreigners who were held in recent months without visas and accused, in the state news media, of spying. Dozens of protesters arrested at demonstrations on Thursday in Serbia were also released.</p>
        <p>Mr. Filipovic's release gives hope to remaining political prisoners, some of whom face sentences as long as 20 years. It is a sign that the military is moving with the new democratic changes.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Stambolic's case looks particularly desperate. Rights advocates fear that he has been killed, the last of a group of murder victims of the Milosevic era.</p>
        <p>He was kidnapped on Aug. 25 while jogging. It took five days for the state news media to mention his disappearance. His lawyer, Nikola Barovic, said that fact led him to suspect state involvement. The abduction occurred in the presidential election campaign, a period of increased repression, police surveillance and attacks on Mr. Milosevic's critics.</p>
        <p>The police have failed to announce any leads, and the justice minister has denied that Mr. Stambolic is being detained in any jail in Serbia. When the United Nations inquired about his whereabouts, another minister accused a United Nations envoy, Jiri Dienstbier, of complicity in the abduction.</p>
        <p>At least Mr. Filipovic can celebrate. He hugged his wife, Slavica, in front of the military prison in Nis, home to the Third Army, which did the bulk of the fighting in Kosovo. ''The hardest time of my life was spent in Nis,'' he said. ''For much of the time, I did not know what was going on outside. I did not know how much time I would spend without my family.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Filipovic, 49, had been reporting from the southern town of Kraljevo for a national daily, Danas, and Agence France-Presse. He was seized after an article he wrote in April for the Institute for War and Peace Reporting on the Yugoslav Army's participation in atrocities in Kosovo.</p>
        <p>He interviewed unidentified army officers who described comrades who committed atrocities, and he referred to an internal army report that revealed a morale crisis at the prospect of another war in neighboring Montenegro.</p>
        <p>The interview was published in English. Although it did not appear in Serbia, it was available on the Internet.</p>
        <p>Mr. Filipovic said he thought that it was the reference to the plans for war in Montenegro that caused his arrest. But fellow journalists ascribed it to his reporting witnesses' accounts of war crimes and linking them to Mr. Milosevic's government.</p>
        <p>''I spent five months inside for no reason,'' Mr. Filipovic said. ''But that is the fate of journalists in our country, although that time is past now.''</p>
        <p>He said that a radio had helped him follow the protests that ended Mr. Milosevic's tenure and that he had swung from desperation to hope in recent weeks, some of them in solitary confinement.</p>
        <p>''Suddenly,'' he said, ''I had a feeling of hope, and there is no place with less hope than prison.''</p>
