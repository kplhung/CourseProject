      <abstract>
        <p>Correction of Oct 5 article about new sexual misconduct policy at Columbia University; reference was made to student who is son of Harvey A Silverglate</p>
      </abstract>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Because of an editing error, an article on Thursday about a new sexual misconduct policy at Columbia University referred incorrectly to a senior there whose father is Harvey A. Silverglate, a co-founder of a group critical of the policy. The student is his son, not his daughter. Because of an editing error, the article also misstated Mr. Silverglate's title and affiliation. He is a board member and a former president of the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts, not a past board member of the national A.C.L.U.</p>
