        <p>AMERICANS are drinking more good wine than ever before, and regardless of what happens to the economy, they could, by 2015, be drinking a whole lot more.</p>
        <p>At least that's the way a respected California consulting firm sees things, and it backs up those rosy predictions with some fascinating figures. Since 1994, according to Motto Kryla &amp; Fisher, wine industry analysts and consultants based in St. Helena, Calif., adult Americans' per capita spending on wine has increased 83 percent, to $64 a year from $35, while their yearly consumption has risen 22 percent, to 8.4 bottles from 6.9.</p>

        <p>AMERICANS are drinking more good wine than ever before, and regardless of what happens to the economy, they could, by 2015, be drinking a whole lot more.</p>
        <p>At least that's the way a respected California consulting firm sees things, and it backs up those rosy predictions with some fascinating figures. Since 1994, according to Motto Kryla &amp; Fisher, wine industry analysts and consultants based in St. Helena, Calif., adult Americans' per capita spending on wine has increased 83 percent, to $64 a year from $35, while their yearly consumption has risen 22 percent, to 8.4 bottles from 6.9.</p>
        <p>During the same period, premium wine sales among the same group have grown 77 percent, to 4.6 bottles a year from 2.6. ''Premium'' is a wide category; it includes all wine selling for $3 or more a bottle.</p>
        <p>What is more, the consultants say, ''if current consumption in key areas is projected to their future populations, total wine sales could increase 80 percent by 2015.'' Which is another way of saying that if, for example, the good people of Cleveland, a city noted neither for its profligacy nor its abstemiousness, continue to drink wine at their current rate, while their numbers increase at officially projected rates, wine sales in Cleveland will be 80 percent higher than now.</p>
        <p>Heady stuff for Clevelanders, especially their wine merchants.</p>
        <p>''We've never seen a period like this in the history of the wine industry,'' Vic Motto said. ''The outlook is not only positive, it's euphoric.''</p>
        <p>In its euphoria, Motto Kryla &amp; Fisher brushes aside the impact that an economic downturn might have on the wine industry. A cooler economy would be unlikely to ''significantly reduce overall wine consumption,'' the firm contends, because it is ''driven more by marketing and cultural factors than economic ones.''</p>
        <p>Maybe so, but is ours really ''a wine culture''? There are probably Americans who have adopted wine as an integral part of their lives, but not all that many. Any astute wine merchant will agree that much of his income derives from other people's discretionary income. And as for being part of the culture, why have the French and Italians been drinking less wine every year since the end of World War II? Cheap wine may have been part of their lives for centuries, but they dropped some or all of it when cold beer and soft drinks became widely available.</p>
        <p>As for marketing, most of it is concentrated on fighting over market share. Wine sales may be booming, but the domestic market is still unimpressive by world standards, and recent consumption is actually less than it was 15 years ago. Figures from the Wine Institute, a trade group, showed that in 1999 consumption came to about 2.02 gallons per capita, substantially less than the 2.43 gallons in both 1985 and 1986 and well below the 16.2 gallons consumed in the same year by Italians and the 15.8 gallons consumed by the French.</p>
        <p>Worth noting, too, is the domestic per capita consumption of soft drinks (54 gallons) and coffee (30 gallons).</p>
        <p>And not all the wine industry is getting in on the fun. In the Central Valley of California, where the grapes for most nonpremium wines grow, prices this year are at all-time lows. While cabernet sauvignon in the Napa Valley is selling for $3,000 a ton or more, Central Valley growers with long-term contracts are getting about $500, and growers with no contracts with wineries are being offered $100 a ton. A big grape crop was cited for the lower prices.</p>
        <p>The 2000 grape harvest in California is expected to be 10 to 30 percent larger than the 2.6 million tons brought in last year. Wine exports, while still growing, were up only about 2 percent last year, compared with 26 percent in 1998. Analysts cite increasing competition from other wine-producing countries, the Wine Institute said.</p>
        <p>While the wine boom is not confined to the high end of the market, overall figures, like those for per capita consumption, are more modest. All wines entering United States distribution channels last year set a record, 551 million gallons, but the increase was just 5 percent. Wine sales in supermarkets were up about 3 percent.</p>
        <p>Still, the action in the expensive end of the market was fast and furious. According to the Motto Kryla &amp;  Fisher report, the more expensive the wine is, the faster the market grows. In luxury wines, those $25 or more a bottle, the market grew 30 percent last year and is expected to extend even further as baby boomers grow older and more affluent. Farther down the scale, consumers were moving up to better wines, or at least to more expensive wines.</p>
        <p>In 1994, when adults drank 6.9 bottles of wine each, 4.3 of those were generic wines, a nice way of saying jug wines, and 2.6 were ''premium'' wines costing $3 or more. By last year, with adult consumption up to 8.4 bottles, the categories were reversed: 4.6 bottles were premium and 3.8 generic.</p>
        <p>Taste was growing more sophisticated in other ways. White wines were still the most popular, accounting for 39 percent of all purchases, but red wines, at 35 percent, were the fastest-growing category. Roses,  blush wines and others were off 3 percent, to 26 percent of purchases. Chardonnay was, yet again, the most popular varietal, with 18 percent of sales; white zinfandel was second,  with 15 percent; merlot third, with 9 percent; and cabernet sauvignon fourth, with 8 percent. Merlot's performance was impressive -- its sales increased 26 percent to beat cabernet sauvignon for the first time.</p>
