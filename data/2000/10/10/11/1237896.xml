        <p>DENISE RICH needed to find a room for her interview. It had to be perfect. Her photograph would be taken. She had already spent the morning picking out just the right jewelry.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the study in the penthouse with the Chagall and a view looking north over Central Park? Or the adjoining living area with the Schnabel and views both north and west?</p>
        <p>After all, that was the room where Ms. Rich had given a Democratic fund-raiser last week that was attended by, among others, President Clinton and Donald J. Trump.</p>
        <p>But no, one of her assistants had a better idea. The recording studio.</p>
        <p>''I'm glad to hear that,'' Ms. Rich said as she breezed through her Upper East Side apartment. ''That makes it more relaxing, because that's what I'm really all about.''</p>
        <p>Well, not quite. Certainly part of Ms. Rich is about her songwriting. Three pieces that she worked on have been nominated for Grammy Awards, the latest being a 1999 duet by Aretha Franklin and Mary J. Blige. But Ms. Rich is also about living down her past as the wife of Marc Rich, the fugitive commodities trader, who is in hiding in Switzerland. And she is about giving parties in her penthouse. ''Small and private'' parties, to quote from an invitation for one such occasion that proved to be an intimate gathering for at least 250. Parties attended by celebrities like Cyndi Lauper, Placido Domingo and Kelsey Grammer.</p>
        <p>Not to mention dinners like the one attended by the president, which was closer to what might be considered small and private. Only 35 or so people were at the candlelit table last week when President Clinton stood up and praised Ms. Rich as one of his closest friends. That dinner -- which raised $250,000 for Gov. Thomas R. Carper of Delaware, who is running for the Senate -- was one of a half-dozen fund-raisers for Democratic candidates that she has given.</p>
        <p>But Ms. Rich leaves politics to the politicians. ''I think the issues are very, very important,'' she said, ''but I don't want to get into specifics.''</p>
        <p>What she does get into are more personal details, like the death of her eldest daughter, which led to the founding of the G&amp;P Charitable Foundation for Cancer Research four years ago.</p>
        <p>The G stands for Gabrielle Rich Aouad, the daughter who died of leukemia in 1996, at 27. The P is for the son-in-law, Philip Aouad. On her deathbed, Mrs. Aouad made her mother promise to do two things: start a foundation for cancer research and produce a movie script that Mrs. Aouad had been writing.</p>
        <p>The foundation raised $2.5 million at its first fund-raising party in 1998. The second gala is scheduled for Nov. 30 at the Marriott Marquis. As a prelude, Ms. Rich plans to honor Mikhail S. Gorbachev tonight at another of her smallish dinners.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gorbachev lost his wife, Raisa, last year to leukemia. Ms. Rich said she knew his suffering, and not just because her daughter had died from the same disease: Her best friend in high school died of leukemia. Then, in 1985, Ms. Rich lost her only sister to breast cancer.</p>
        <p>THE two grew up together in Worcester, Mass., the children of a Jewish couple who left Europe after World War II. (When asked exactly when she was born, Ms. Rich only laughed.) Their father started a shoemaking company. Ms. Rich attended Boston University, then went to Europe. In Madrid, she met Mr. Rich, an oil trader. He was indicted in the United States on charges of tax evasion, fraud and racketeering in 1983. The two married and settled in Switzerland.</p>
        <p>Her husband played the markets; she played the guitar. ''I found it easier to communicate my feelings through song than talking to someone,'' Ms. Rich said.</p>
        <p>But she had a hard time starting her songwriting career. Then her sister, Monique Dokton, fell ill. It was on one of the last hospital visits that her sister gave her the gift of musical success, Ms. Rich said.</p>
        <p>This is how the story goes: Ms. Rich was flying back home after seeing her sister. Lyrics came to her in a dream. She wrote down the song and sent it to Paul Marshall, a music lawyer. Sister Sledge recorded the tune and released it in 1986 under the title ''Frankie.''</p>
        <p>Sitting in her studio, surrounded by CD's that include songs she has written for artists like Natalie Cole and Celine Dion, Ms. Rich was quick to point out the name of the group that ignited her career: ''Sister Sledge.''</p>
        <p>''I've gotten all sorts of signs, and I channel them now,'' Ms. Rich said. ''I have the angels helping me write.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Rich divorced her husband almost 10 years ago and moved to New York with her three daughters. She refused to talk in depth about the marriage or exactly how much of her wealth comes from Mr. Rich.</p>
        <p>Her 75-year-old mother died of cancer about the same time she came to New York. It seemed then that the disease had wreaked such havoc in Ms. Rich's life that it could do no more harm.</p>
        <p>But in 1993, her eldest daughter, Gabrielle, was found to have Hodgkin's disease. Chemotherapy followed. The illness receded, and the daughter married Mr. Aouad. Then came the diagnosis of leukemia in 1996. This time, chemotherapy failed.</p>
        <p>Out of that came the foundation and the millions for cancer research.</p>
        <p>As for the second promise she made to her daughter, the one about getting the screenplay produced, Ms. Rich was still working on that. She believes in its worth. It is about a family and its pains and dramas and loves. It is like real life.</p>
