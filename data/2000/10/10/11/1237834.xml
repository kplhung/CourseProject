        <p>As Bette Midler prepares to go onstage, her sitcom husband asks her how she feels: ''Supremely overconfident or riddled with anxiety?''</p>
        <p>The answer, of course, is yes.</p>
        <p>Ms. Midler's good-natured narcissism animates ''Bette,'' a weekly fictionalized account of her life that makes self-involvement seem funny and endearing. This isn't a big departure for the mischievous diva. Throughout her career, in movies and concerts, Ms. Midler has thrived on contradiction, easily moving from crass to class.</p>
        <p>In the course of a single live performance, she can catapult herself -- dressed as a mermaid -- around a stage in a wheelchair, stop to tell some bawdy jokes  and then go on to break your heart with a wrenching ballad. When she's playing opposite others, this high-voltage performer also knows how to dim her own lights.</p>
        <p>Like Ms. Midler, her television show ricochets from self-mockery to sincerity and beyond. Agonizing about whether to appear with Danny DeVito on a television show (he shows up on hers), she says, ''Pretty soon, if I keep doing these guest spots I'll have my own series and then I'll have to kill myself.''</p>
        <p>In the first episode she drops many joking references to her own films and then grins at her own jokes. The self-referential humor also takes aim at Ms. Midler's overeating, plastic surgery and breasts (she still calls hers ''these girls'').</p>
        <p>The pilot episode of ''Bette'' operates around a familiar sitcom ploy of mismatched expectations. Her retinue, which includes her family, her musical director and her manager, thinks she's upset about one thing when she's actually upset about something else.</p>
        <p>The situation is simple and predictable, but the comedy is only deceptively so. In playing out the farcical plot, Ms. Midler becomes the commentator on her own life and then comments on the comments. It's sort of a Talmudic approach to sitcom.</p>
        <p>The star talks about herself in the royal ''we'' but also in the more fragile ''I,'' and is convincing in both modes. Sometimes she seems larger than life and sometimes she seems to be her actual size, which is tiny.</p>
        <p>The show's creator, Jeffrey Lane, has lots of smart credits, including ''Mad About You,'' and he seems to have figured out how to corral Ms. Midler's outsize personality without diminishing it. The trick will be to keep the surrounding players from being overwhelmed.</p>
        <p>Kevin Dunn plays Roy, the Ricky to her Lucy (though the show has a very long way to go before it's embossed on a postal stamp, as ''I Love Lucy'' recently was). Mr. Dunn manages to hold his own, even in a bit of slapstick that requires him to make a romantic speech while Bette furiously contorts on an exercise machine. Joanna Gleason is the loyal sidekick, Connie, who's also Bette's manager. No one should become too attached to Lindsay Lohan, star of the remade ''Parent Trap,'' as Bette's daughter, Rose. Through the alchemy of television, in future episodes Rose will become the actress Marina Malota, and vice versa.</p>
        <p>The most promising secondary part belongs to James Dreyfus, as Oscar, Bette's supercilious musical director. He's the British comic actor who played the shop assistant in ''Notting Hill,'' the movie starring  Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant. The musical director role is important because Ms. Midler doesn't disappoint her fans. She not only mugs on her show, she sings.</p>
        <p>The plot in the first episode requires Ms. Midler to despair of middle age and begin imitating youth. She brings hip-hop music to a rehearsal with Oscar, who is dismayed. What about the Gershwin, he asks.</p>
        <p>''Gershwin! Feh!'' she replies, and then begins trying to yammer out the nonlyrics to the rap piece. That's amusing, but then Ms. Midler reveals the real promise in this show. She drops the shtick and starts feeling her way around the music. In short order she has transformed disharmony into a melodic riff and her face projects pure happiness. As always with Ms. Midler, you get more than you might have expected.</p>
        <p>BETTE  CBS, tonight at 8  (Channel 2 in New York)</p>
        <p>Created by Jeffrey Lane; Mr. Lane, Bonnie Bruckheimer, Bette Midler and Andrew D. Weyman executive producers; produced by CBS Productions in association with Columbia TriStar Television.</p>
        <p>WITH: Bette Midler (Bette), Joanna Gleason (Connie), Kevin Dunn (Roy), James Dreyfus (Oscar) and Lindsay Lohan (Rose).</p>
