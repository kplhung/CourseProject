        <p>Sri Lankans turned out heavily today to vote in parliamentary elections that will serve as a referendum on the governing coalition's strategy for ending the country's 17-year war with separatist Tamil rebels.</p>
        <p>The race between the governing People's Alliance, headed by President Chandrika Kumaratunga, and the opposition United National Party is expected to be very close.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Kumaratunga has pursued a carrot-and-stick approach to the ethnic conflict. She tried to push through a new Constitution that would have given Tamils greater political autonomy, but it was defeated in Parliament by the opposition. At the same time, her government has spent more than $350 million in recent months on new military hardware for its war on the rebels, who have refused offers to negotiate.</p>
        <p>The opposition leader, Ranil Wickremesinghe, has said that he, too, favors a political solution to the ethnic conflict. But he says the government must first have more extensive consultations with the country's two most intransigent forces -- the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, who have been fighting for a separate Tamil homeland since 1983, and the Sinhalese Buddhist monks, who have vociferously opposed any grant of autonomy to the Tamils.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Kumaratunga, leader of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, and Mr. Wickremesinghe have clashed repeatedly. Although they are not very far apart on the ethnic question, they have proved unable to work together.</p>
        <p>The larger political issues were overshadowed today by charges of violence and vote rigging in parts of the country and by the death of Sirimavo Bandaranaike, President Kumaratunga's mother, who was the first woman to hold the post of prime minister. Mrs. Bandaranaike was a dominant figure in the country's political life in the 1960's and 70's. [Obituary, Page C31.]</p>
        <p>An estimated 70 percent of the 12 million eligible voters in this island nation off the southern tip of India went to the polls today at the end of a violent election season. They were choosing from a record 5,477 candidates from 29 political parties and 99 other groups for 225 seats in the Parliament. Fearing more thuggery, the government imposed an 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew tonight.</p>
        <p>Sri Lanka, a country plagued for decades by political violence, has seen more of it in recent weeks. At least 60 people have died in suicide-bomb attacks by Tiger rebels, as well as in incidents involving partisans of the major political parties.</p>
        <p>The violence continued on Election Day. The Center for Monitoring Election Violence, an independent group, said in a statement that voting in 210 of the country's 9,500 polling places had been so seriously compromised that ''the final outcome in these areas would be rendered utterly meaningless.'' It cited incidents of vote rigging, ballot box stuffing, bombing, intimidation and killings, with the worst offenses in the center of the country.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Kumaratunga said in a statement today that she would support the election commissioner if he decides that the results of the voting in some areas should be set aside because of vote fraud. She dispatched an elite commando unit to a central district after receiving reports of widespread violence there.</p>
        <p>None of the possible outcomes of the voting today offer a strong hope for political consensus on the war, which has claimed more than 60,000 lives. Mrs. Kumaratunga's alliance -- which had promised to bring peace six years ago -- had only a narrow majority in the last Parliament. After failing to deliver peace, it seems unlikely to win a bigger majority this time and may well see its position erode.</p>
        <p>It could still eke out a bare victory. Alternatively, both main political forces could wind up without a majority, forcing them to turn to smaller parties to seek a majority. Or the opposition could win outright.</p>
        <p>If the governing party does not win, one result might well be a worsening of the already discouraging political gridlock. Even with a hung Parliament or the defeat of the governing alliance, Mrs. Kumaratunga, who was re-elected president last year, will remain in office -- able to pick all the cabinet ministers and to chose whom from the opposition to call on to be prime minister. This curious hybrid, a cross between a presidential and a parliamentary system, was set up in Sri Lanka's 1978 Constitution.</p>
