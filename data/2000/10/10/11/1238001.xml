        <p>Bloomberg Television officials announced an agreement with Time Warner Cable yesterday that will open the door for the cable company's regional systems to carry Bloomberg programming.</p>
        <p>Bloomberg Television, a five-year-old operation providing 24-hour financial news, reaches more than 200 million viewers worldwide but has had difficulty entering American cable television markets.

        <p>Bloomberg Television officials announced an agreement with Time Warner Cable yesterday that will open the door for the cable company's regional systems to carry Bloomberg programming.</p>
        <p>Bloomberg Television, a five-year-old operation providing 24-hour financial news, reaches more than 200 million viewers worldwide but has had difficulty entering American cable television markets. Edward Skyler, a spokesman for Bloomberg, said that the television division would gain access to 12.6 million new households, but declined to discuss other details of the deal.</p>
        <p>Bloomberg Television would be made available in Time Warner's digital packages, which would allow for interactive capabilities in the future.</p>
        <p>''Bloomberg Television is designed for the digital era,'' said Mike Morrison, a Bloomberg executive who oversees television ventures. ''Bloomberg was the first network to see the potential of digital and interactive programming and tailor its product to meet the needs of this dynamic new medium.''</p>
        <p>Earlier this year, Bloomberg secured distribution on Time Warner's digital package in New York City, Time Warner's largest system at 1.2 million subscribers. All told, Bloomberg has added 2.6 million digital and satellite subscribers this year, bringing its total to almost 11 million subscribers.</p>
        <p>Time Warner joins AT&amp;T, MediaOne and Cox among other cable providers that are carrying Bloomberg Television.</p>
