        <p>The Democratic Party this week released a television advertisement that attacks Gov. George W. Bush's record on the environment.</p>
        <p>The commercial, which is running in Seattle, is one of three new attack advertisements; the other two, running in Iowa and West Virginia, respectively, warn about dipping school test scores in Texas and Texas' resistance to increasing the minimum wage.</p>
        <p>Party officials said the three commercials would run for more than a week at a cost of more than $1 million.</p>
        <p>Bush campaign officials said the advertisements were part of a ''troubling pattern'' of distortion by Vice President Al Gore. With respect to the environment, the officials said, Governor Bush has strengthened enforcement of the Clean Air Act and helped reduce industrial emissions by 11 percent since 1994.</p>
        <p>PRODUCER -- Democratic Victory 2000.</p>
        <p>ON THE SCREEN -- The Houston skyline shrouded in smog. An image of Mr. Bush signing papers gives way to smokestacks churning out white clouds, and children's empty swing sets. The Seattle skyline appears and grows hazy.</p>
        <p>THE SCRIPT -- Announcer: ''There's nothing wrong with your screen. What you're seeing is the worst smog in America. The city: Houston, Tex.</p>
        <p>''As governor, George W. Bush made key air pollution rules in Texas voluntary. Even for some plants near schools.</p>
        <p>''Last year, Houston overtook Los Angeles as America's smoggiest city. Now take a deep breath and imagine Seattle with Bush's Texas-style environmental regulation.</p>
        <p>''George Bush. Before he talks about cleaning up Washington, maybe he should clean up Texas.''</p>
        <p>ACCURACY -- The commercial accurately reports that Houston last year surpassed Los Angeles as the city with the most federal ozone health standard violations in the country. It alludes to the fact that Mr. Bush worked with industry leaders -- and not environmental groups -- to draft an anti-pollution law last year that allowed companies long out of compliance with state standards to pursue licenses voluntarily under relaxed terms.</p>
        <p>SCORE CARD -- Conservationists say Mr. Bush left himself open to attack by showing little interest in environmental issues until he became a presidential candidate. Mr. Bush, a former oil executive, is hard-pressed to distance himself from some of the state's heaviest polluters, but his supporters insist he has used his ties to reduce certain toxic emissions in a state that is largely skeptical of environmental regulations.</p>
