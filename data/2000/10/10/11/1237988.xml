        <p>IN only three seasons with the Yankees, Orlando Hernandez, the Cuban right-hander known as El Duque, has emerged as the pride of their postseason. And now that the Seattle Mariners have knocked the Subway Series slightly off the track, at least for the moment, that pride will be on display again in today's second game of the American League Championship Series.</p>
        <p>''We need El Duque to take us late into the game,'' Manager Joe Torre said after last night's 2-0 loss in the opener. ''He's had a habit of picking us up, and hopefully he'll do that again.''</p>

        <p>IN only three seasons with the Yankees, Orlando Hernandez, the Cuban right-hander known as El Duque, has emerged as the pride of their postseason. And now that the Seattle Mariners have knocked the Subway Series slightly off the track, at least for the moment, that pride will be on display again in today's second game of the American League Championship Series.</p>
        <p>''We need El Duque to take us late into the game,'' Manager Joe Torre said after last night's 2-0 loss in the opener. ''He's had a habit of picking us up, and hopefully he'll do that again.''</p>
        <p>Over his postseason career with the Yankees, Hernandez is 6-0, including his victory in last Friday night's pivotal third game of the division series with the Oakland Athletics. He has won one other division series game, two league championship games and two World Series games. But he minimized his ability to pitch so well in the postseason pressure cooker.</p>
        <p>''I don't consider myself a big-game pitcher,'' Hernandez said before last night's game. ''I consider myself someone who works hard and tries to do his job and help his team. It's a game like any other game. You have to get 27 outs or else you don't win.''</p>
        <p>Hernandez even pitched briefly in relief Sunday night to help secure the Yankees' 7-5 victory at Oakland in the decisive fifth game of the division series. And now he'll be starting with only two days' rest. But when he was asked if he had a rubber arm that enabled him to pitch so often and yet so well, he shook his head.</p>
        <p>''I'm not Superman,'' he said. ''I'm human. But if the need arises, I'm capable of pitching.''</p>
        <p>Even though the Yankees had only six hits last night, Torre found another staring pitcher. Going into the fifth inning, Denny Neagle had a no-hitter.</p>
        <p>''I thought Denny was terrific,'' Torre said. ''He was shaky at the start, but he obviously pitched well enough to win. It gives us something to look forward to.''</p>
        <p>Neagle is a jokester. He can create strange sounds, like that of a train whistle. He can contort his face to resemble the comic actor Jim Carrey.</p>
        <p>But ever since the Yankees acquired Neagle from the Cincinnati Reds last July, they hoped that this lanky 32-year-old left-hander would not look like Jim Carrey so much as he would look like Andy Pettitte or David Wells.</p>
        <p>Or Ron Guidry or Whitey Ford or Ed Lopat or Lefty Gomez or Herb Pennock.</p>
        <p>And into the fifth inning last night, Neagle indeed looked like those other winning left-handers in other Yankee eras.</p>
        <p>But with two out, the Mariners scratched out a run on Mark McLemore's double and Rickey Henderson's single. In the sixth Alex Rodriguez lofted a towering home run off the left-field foul screen. And the Yankees never got a run off Freddy Garcia, Jose Paniagua and the Japanese import closer, Kazuhiro Sasaki.</p>
        <p>What the Yankees didn't want to see was the Neagle they remembered from the last few weeks of this season, as he lost his last three starts.</p>
        <p>Their previous postseason memories of Neagle came from the 1996 World Series, when he was with the Atlanta Braves. He wasted a 6-0 lead in the fourth game as the Yankees rallied to win that game and eventually the championship.</p>
        <p>''I would like to think,'' Neagle said Monday, ''this is what the Yankees had in mind for me, to pitch some big games for them, especially in the postseason. I look forward to that. I relish that. This is why they got me. I had in mind that I was hopefully going to get a chance to pitch in a game like this.''</p>
        <p>In the division series, Torre sidetracked Neagle, preferring to start both Roger Clemens and Pettitte on only three days' rest in the fourth and fifth games, respectively. But Neagle wasn't intimidated by the thought of being on the mound in Yankee Stadium in the dazzle of the League Championship Series.</p>
        <p>''This is obviously the perfect stage in baseball,'' he had said. ''There's no better theater stage than New York and Yankee Stadium. Getting out there and having the juices flowing and feeling all the energy that the crowd is going to have. I'm hoping I can feed off all that adrenaline, all that emotion with the crowd.''</p>
        <p>All that adrenaline and all that emotion didn't make him look like Jim Carrey on the mound, and he wasn't quite Andy Pettitte or Ron Guidry or Whitey Ford.</p>
        <p>But with nearly six good innings, Denny Neagle earned another start.</p>
