        <p>Richard M. Crain had a sound business reason for teaching himself Japanese. ''I looked around, and I said to myself, who has money?'' said Dr. Crain, a dentist in Larchmont, N.Y. So he hired a Japanese dental assistant and, with her help, began learning basic phrases. He also installed a phone line with an answering message in Japanese, had his dental forms translated into Japanese and posted notices in convenience stores frequented by the growing Japanese community in Westchester County.</p>
        <p>The plan worked. So far, he has treated some 500 Japanese patients.</p>
        <p>There were a few bumps along the way. Once, Dr. Crain meant to say ''please spit'' but used the word for sushi instead. The patient just stared at him. Today, though, with an arsenal of Japanese words and phrases at his command, and an English-Japanese dictionary nearby, he said, he can ''pretty much handle the whole thing.''</p>
        <p>Eric Ploumis, an orthodontist whose office is a few doors away from Dr. Crain's, has also given his business a linguistic boost. Dr. Ploumis treats many of the children who attend the local French American school, and about a year and a half ago, he hired a tutor to teach him French.</p>
        <p>He did so, not to communicate more clearly with his young patients, who are mostly conversant in English. No, Dr. Ploumis also wanted to be able to connect with their mothers. ''Whether it's how to write a thank-you note to a mother in French, or how to say, 'Your child needs four teeth removed,' '' mastering French ''certainly enhances my business,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Ploumis and Dr. Crain are just the tip of a linguistic iceberg that has barged rather suddenly into the American workplace. As more immigrants pour into the country and as more Americans do deals with foreign companies, learning a foreign language has increasingly become a career plus, and sometimes a career must.</p>
        <p>While nobody seems to track the number of Americans who are studying a foreign language, private language school enrollments reflect the trend. Karen Decker, president of the International Center for Language Studies, a school in Washington that teaches over 80 languages, says about 90 percent of the students attend for work purposes. Cheryl Gordon, founder of Language Plus, in El Paso, says the number at her school is closer to 98 percent.</p>
        <p>And Helen Hamlyn, an official with Language Testing International in White Plains, an arm of the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages, says the number of language-proficiency exams administered by companies to employees has soared by nearly 1,000 percent in 12 years.</p>
        <p>It is not foreign-bound executives who are leading the trend, either, Ms. Hamlyn says. Rather, languages are being spoken more and more by rank-and-file workers at banks, telephone companies and other service providers that have lots of foreign-born customers. Demand is highest for proficiency in Spanish, but is also growing for Mandarin Chinese, Cantonese, Korean, Vietnamese, Russian and Hindi.</p>
        <p>Sometimes, the goal is more to familiarize people with a foreign culture than to make them fluent in a foreign tongue. After entering into a business liaison with Nikon of Japan recently, for example, the microelectronics division of I.B.M. in East Fishkill, N.Y., put a group of its employees through a two-day immersion course in Japanese. The idea was to teach them a few common greetings and also a little bit about Japanese customs.</p>
        <p>Margaret Cogswell kicked off the course with a briefing on the formality of Japanese culture and the complexities of exchanging meeshi, or business cards, with Japanese executives. ''Japan is a society of manners,'' she said. The group paired off to tackle words like konnichiwa, hajimemashite and dozo yoroshiku (''Hello, How do you do? Pleased to meet you'') and to practice the arts of handing out business cards and bowing.</p>
        <p>Carl Bohnenkamp, a senior laboratory specialist, said the class made him realize he probably came on too strong in previous dealings with the Japanese. ''I'm going to try to be a little bit more open and sensitive to their culture'' in the future, he said.</p>
        <p>The classes were conducted by the Language Immersion Institute of the State University of New York at New Paltz, which says it is getting more and more requests for such specialized training. The institute has taught Spanish to personnel at a New York area hospital and even given lessons in ''party French'' to executives of a New York media company who wanted to take Parisian clients out for a night on the town.</p>
        <p>English, of course, is the lingua franca of the global economy, so American executives can travel abroad without uttering the native language. But such ignorance can put them at a disadvantage, while just a little effort can pay big dividends, educators say.</p>
        <p>''Even though they hold the meetings in English, you miss the asides,'' said Harriet Barnett, a consultant at the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages in Yonkers. Just making an effort to say a few words in the native tongue can make a good impression, she said, and ''it sends a subliminal message that 'we are equal.' ''</p>
        <p>The movement has spread to some blue-collar workplaces, especially construction sites, where failure to communicate can result in accidents. John Dusch, the 54-year-old safety director of MKB Construction Inc. in Phoenix, said its safety record had improved since English-speaking workers took Spanish lessons this summer so they could converse with Spanish-speaking colleagues. And for the first time, ''the entire crew eat lunch together,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The linguistic demands of work can take some surprising turns. Police officers in El Paso once acquired drug-sniffing dogs from Czechoslovakia, and were unable to communicate with them. So they went to Ms. Gordon of Language Plus, who had taught some of them Spanish. Should they learn Czech, they asked, or should they teach the dogs English? Given how hard it is to retrain dogs, and that Ms. Gordon's expertise was with humans, they learned Czech.</p>
