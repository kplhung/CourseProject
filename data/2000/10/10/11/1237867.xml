        <p>The country's first impeachment trial of a state supreme court's chief justice ended today in a full acquittal. The New Hampshire Senate found Chief Justice David Brock not guilty on four charges -- including two of improperly allowing disqualified justices to comment on cases -- and sent him, chastened but unbowed, back to his bench.</p>
        <p>Chief Justice Brock, 64, maintained a poker face until the last and closest vote, 14 to 8, was done, and then heaved a sigh and hugged his tearful wife.</p>
        <p>Speaking after the vote, in the lobby of the legislative office building in Concord, N.H., where his trial had been under way since Sept. 18, the chief justice thanked all his supporters in an uncharacteristically shaky voice and thanked the Legislature for the ''fair and thorough process that culminated today.''</p>
        <p>The vote ended months of political hubbub around the state Supreme Court and three weeks of testimony that aired many of the court's internal dynamics. More broadly, the impeachment process raised the issue of when a Legislature should properly intervene in a court's workings and when intervention constitutes a violation of the separation of powers.</p>
        <p>Critics of the court had said it needed a housecleaning that only the Legislature could give; defenders accused the Legislature of wanting payback for unpopular court decisions, particularly one requiring the state to revamp its method of financing schools.</p>
        <p>Chief Justice Brock had faced four articles of impeachment: that he had made a phone call to a Superior Court judge 13 years ago seeking to influence a case; that he had allowed a fellow Supreme Court justice to influence the selection of judges for his own divorce panel; that he had generally allowed judges to comment on cases from which they had recused themselves; and that he had repeatedly lied under oath when asked about all of this.</p>
        <p>Among the 22 senators who voted today -- two senators had recused themselves -- there was no sign of adherence to party lines; they acquitted Chief Justice Brock by votes of 18 to 4, 17 to 5 and 18 to 4 on the first three articles of impeachment.</p>
        <p>Some said they were not convinced of the accuracy of the accusations; others said that even if Chief Justice Brock had made mistakes of judgment and committed improprieties they did not rise to the level of impeachable crimes.</p>
        <p>''I will not be part of any lynch mob mentality,'' said Senator Patricia Krueger, a Republican who noted that she knew some conservatives would consider her a traitor for her decision. ''I can't do it.</p>
        <p>''In plain English, the facts presented to us do not support the conviction of Chief Justice Brock by my standard: clear and convincing evidence.''</p>
        <p>Furthermore, Ms. Krueger said a bit later, ''I'm not convinced the judicial system has not worked, that it has been injured.''</p>
        <p>Among the minority who voted to convict Chief Justice Brock, some said he deserved impeachment for the damage the scandal had done to the public's trust in the judicial system.</p>
        <p>Chief Justice Brock ''was the keeper of the public confidence'' in the Supreme Court, said Senator Mary E. Brown, another Republican. But the court appeared to foster too much secrecy, Ms. Brown said, ''and I think the notion that secrecy is somehow necessary has led to a lot of the public distrust and suspicion, and I think the chief is primarily responsible for that.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Brown said she believed that Chief Justice Brock should be held responsible for the overall damage to the system.</p>
        <p>The chief justice expects to begin hearing cases again when the next court session begins in November, his lawyer, Michael Madigan, said today.</p>
        <p>Had the Senate convicted him, Chief Justice Brock, who was appointed for life, could have been removed from office and stripped of his pension.</p>
        <p>Mr. Madigan, a trial lawyer in Washington, said today that he thought ''New Hampshire should hold its head high,'' and that it ''handled this better than any other state in the union.''</p>
        <p>It also, he said, probably set important precedents for impeachment cases in other states, particularly in its decision to require a two-thirds majority for a conviction.</p>
        <p>Still, Chief Justice Brock's ordeal is not completely over. The state's Judicial Conduct Committee is pursuing its own inquiry into most of the same accusations that the impeachment trial addressed.</p>
        <p>Also, the Legislature is expected to focus on judicial reform when it reconvenes in January, and there has been talk that lawmakers who are particularly hostile to Chief Justice Brock and the court may try to remove him through a ''bill of address,'' a procedure simpler than impeachment. Representative Donna P. Sytek, the speaker of the House, said that one bill of address had already been filed this afternoon.</p>
        <p>''I think a lot needs to be done to restore confidence and I'll let the court decide after the dust settles what will be the appropriate course of action,'' said Ms. Sytek, who acknowledged that she was disappointed that the Senate failed to go along with the House's conclusions on impeachment.</p>
        <p>The bottom line politically, she said, with elections just around the corner, is that ''it's going to be up to the people of New Hampshire to decide if justice was done today.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  October 12, 2000, Thursday  An article yesterday about the acquittal of Chief Justice David Brock of the New Hampshire Supreme Court on impeachment charges misstated the length of a court term. Justices must retire at 70; they do not serve for life.</p>
