        <p>IN the two decades since the original Beetle was last sold in the United States, the car that was a paisley-powered rite of passage for millions of driving Americans has faded from memory. Whatever lingering and unrequited affection there was for the old dumpling, it might be fair to assume, was satisfied by the introduction two years ago of the New Beetle, a glossy, postmodern rendition of the adorable Bug that beyond appearances has almost nothing in common with the original.</p>
        <p>New Beetles are built in a gigantic factory in Puebla, Mexico, emerging from its robotic gantlet at a rate of 150,000 cars a year. Nearly all these cars are dispatched to international markets, in particular the United States.</p>
        <p>But in another, much smaller part of the factory, Volkswagen employees still build, mostly by hand, the old-style Beetle, the air-cooled, rear-engine icon, to satisfy demand in Mexico's domestic market. The best-selling car in history is still popular more than 60 years after it was rolled out by the Third Reich as the Kraft durch Freude Wagen -- the KdF-Wagen -- or the Strength Through Joy car. Twenty-two million copies, and counting.</p>
        <p>It has been a long, strange trip for the Beetle, but it has a certain symmetry. It began life as a car for the statist everyman, mobility being part of a program of rewards for allegiance to a grander Nazi state. It rose from the ashes of the Wolfsburg factory -- fortunately, the body stampings were not destroyed when the plant was bombed -- to become the first true world car, rugged, simple to repair and affordable.</p>
        <p>In the 1960's, when VW built hundreds of thousands of Beetles, the car achieved a sort of classless ubiquity. Rich kids drove them to college because they were cute and fashionably anti-establishment; poor people drove them because they had to.</p>
        <p>By the late 70's, the Beetle could no longer keep up with American crash test and emissions standards, and VW stopped United States imports. By that time, Beetle production had been moved from Wolfsburg, Germany, and farmed out to places like Brazil, Nigeria and Mexico.</p>
        <p>Today, only the Mexico plant continues to build the Beetle, at a steady rate of 40,000 a year, selling for around $7,000 each. It has come full circle as a car for the proletariat, though it is hard to imagine a society more different from Nazi Germany than the struggling and rowdy Mexico.</p>
        <p>Stand on a busy street corner in Juarez and close your eyes. The Beetle's familiar exhaust note -- a muttering, chuffing sound, like an overly gregarious lawn mower --  comes at you from every direction. On any given day, about a third of all vehicles on the street are Beetles, new ones and old ones discernible only if you keep up with subtle changes among model years.</p>
        <p>And they are subtle. At the Juarez airport last month, I picked up a forest-green Beetle with 43 kilometers on the odometer, and the car was almost exactly the same as the one I drove 20 years ago. Some detailing had  changed -- seat materials, various trim bits -- but in profile the car was identical.</p>
        <p>A Mexican Beetle is an automotive madeleine, summoning up waves of hazy grooviness. Unlike a vintage car, which has the wear of years on it, this is a new Bug.</p>
        <p>From the outside, the biggest difference is the use of body-colored trim around the headlights and on the bumpers. VW offers an optional molded cover that gives the bumper an integrated look, but it doesn't much conceal the original contours.</p>
        <p>Four-lug steel wheels are standard, though brilliant aluminum rims are a $900 accessory. Mexican streets, however, would make short work of alloy rims.</p>
        <p>In some ways the new Beetle is much diminished from the cars of old. The door handles, once chromed-steel push-button levers, have been supplanted by dull and cheap black-matte-finish aluminum ones. The chromed turn indicators that were once  on the front fenders have been replaced with amber plastic lenses in the bumper. The tilt-out rear windows, with the ivory-colored knobs, have gone the way of the dodo.</p>
        <p>The textured-rubber running boards are still in place, as are the tilt-out front quarter windows (smokers rejoice). Above the left front fender a deposit-box-style lock has been installed; it activates the car's built-in alarm.</p>
        <p>Lift up the rear hood and you find an engine not much changed from the one that Ferdinand Porsche designed in the first prototypes. The displacement has gone up; the Beetle now displaces 1,584 cc's with its horizontally opposed four-cylinder engine,  and electronic fuel injection has replaced the carburetors. For the most part, though, people who owned a Beetle in its heyday (''Herbie, the Love Bug'' era) would know their way around the engine compartment.</p>
        <p>Horsepower is up to 44, a fair bump from the original car's 25. Meanwhile, the VW four-speed gearbox, which has seen service in everything from race cars to dune buggies, remains unchanged. The foot-long gearshift still wiggles in its boot.</p>
        <p>AT one time, VW offered Super Beetles, high-content versions notable for their MacPherson strut-front suspension. But in the interests of low costs, the current Beetle uses the less complicated torsion-bar suspension of old. This clever and compact suspension works well over the highway and becomes a problem only when you try to horse the Beetle through a corner.</p>
        <p>Even so, without power steering or power brakes to deaden the sensations coming from the wheels, the Beetle feels wonderfully alive and controllable in a way modern cars often do not. If its not-particularly-fast top speed is around 82 miles per hour, it is fun in a basely mechanical, go-cart way.</p>
        <p>Even by Beetle standards, the Mexican-market Bug is spartan, with no air-conditioning or heater. The dashboard is textured vinyl over a blank vertical panel coated in wrinkle-finish black paint. One instrument  occupies the dash: a black-face speedometer with an integrated fuel gauge. There are a total of two toggle switches on the central dash, one for headlights and one for hazard lights.</p>
        <p>As for the New Beetle -- designed in America and based on a Golf chassis, front engine and front drive -- it is so thoroughly unlike the old that it seems less a homage than a repudiation of the old Bug. This suits the Germans fine. There was very little enthusiasm in Wolfsburg for a redactive Beetle when the concept was unveiled in 1994. To many Germans, the Beetle seemed loaded with Volkswagen's psychic baggage -- its Nazi origins, its postwar penury. It was only the Americans' boisterous affection for the New Beetle, and their gauzy memory of the old, that obliged VW to proceed with the project.</p>
        <p>If Germans desired to distance themselves from the thing called Beetle, they never lost sight of its effective design. Dr. Porsche realized that front-engine, rear-drive cars were inherently inefficient in packaging. By putting the motor in the rear, over the driven wheels, he freed up the cabin for passengers and cargo and put much of the car's weight where it would enhance traction. Dr. Porsche also favored a horizontally opposed ''boxer'' engine, which lowers the engine's, and car's, center of gravity, creating better stability. These insights eventually evolved into the magnificent Porsche 911 sports car.</p>
        <p>Besides representing the ultimate in factory tooling, the Beetle has outlasted every car in history, and continues its service with blithe directness and simplicity. It is adorable and is adored. Never has a car done so much for so many for so little, for so long.</p>
