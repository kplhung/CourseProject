        <p>In June, police officers and detectives scoured the basement of a Lower East Side tenement hoping to find evidence that might lead to a breakthrough in the case of Etan Patz, whose disappearance as a 6-year-old in 1979 has haunted New York City for two decades.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, investigators acknowledged that their mid-June excavation had proved fruitless, and that the case of the child's disappearance remained unsolved. DNA and other forensic tests on material taken from the tenement found no evidence that Etan's body had been there, investigators said.</p>

        <p>In June, police officers and detectives scoured the basement of a Lower East Side tenement hoping to find evidence that might lead to a breakthrough in the case of Etan Patz, whose disappearance as a 6-year-old in 1979 has haunted New York City for two decades.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, investigators acknowledged that their mid-June excavation had proved fruitless, and that the case of the child's disappearance remained unsolved. DNA and other forensic tests on material taken from the tenement found no evidence that Etan's body had been there, investigators said.</p>
        <p>''All the bone fragments that were recovered turned out to be those of domestic animals,'' said Sgt. Brian Burke, a police spokesman.</p>
        <p>In the years since Etan Patz left his family's loft at 113 Prince Street in SoHo on May 25, 1979, to walk to his school bus alone for the first time, never to be seen again, his case has stumped investigators, who have searched in vain for the blond, blue-eyed child's body.</p>
        <p>Investigators say the prime suspect in Etan's disappearance is Jose A. Ramos, a friend of a baby sitter who worked for the Patz family, and they believe he abducted and murdered the child. While Mr. Ramos is said to have made admissions about Etan, no proof has ever been found.</p>
        <p>In June, a dozen police officers and detectives spent eight hours in the basement of 234 East Fourth Street, where Mr. Ramos lived when Etan disappeared. Mr. Ramos, 57, is a former mental patient now imprisoned for molesting a boy in Pennsylvania.</p>
        <p>In June, the Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole denied Mr. Ramos's request for parole.</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman for the Manhattan district attorney, Robert M. Morgenthau, said that investigators would continue searching for leads on the case.</p>
