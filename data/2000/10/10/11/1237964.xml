        <p>China clarified what value-added telecommunications services would be opened to foreign investors after the country joins the World Trade Organization. An article in the government's Peoples Daily said the value-added sector includes Internet services and content, e-mail and voice-mail services, databases, fax services and videoconferencing. The sector also includes the reselling of basic services like mobile and fixed-line telecommunications and wireless paging and online handling of data and transactions. Upon its entry to the W.T.O., China has promised to allow 30 percent foreign ownership of ventures providing such value-added services, rising to 49 percent after one year and 50 percent after two years. It had not previously said what those services included.</p>
