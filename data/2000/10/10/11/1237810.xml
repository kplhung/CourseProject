        <p>SALADS can be divided into two main types. The first, and more improvisational, makes imaginative use of whatever ingredients happen to be in the refrigerator, cobbled together more by experience and instinct than by design. At best, these salads can be joyous cornucopias, bright and delightful.</p>
        <p>The second group consists of precise compositions, constructed almost geometrically with ingredients chosen carefully to emphasize balance and contrast.</p>
        <p>The cold beef salad ($7.50) at Nem, the Vietnamese takeout kiosk in the dining concourse of Grand Central Terminal, falls squarely into this second category. You can watch the counter person toss it, combining thin slices of grilled rare beef with cabbage, basil, marinated onions and carrots, roasted peanuts and lime dressing. The result is almost perfect, with the savory char of the beef underscored precisely by the basil's deep anise flavor, which almost approaches chocolate. The onions and carrots add sweetness, the peanuts add crunch and the dressing provides cool but tart refreshment, with a well-considered chili component contributing more than a touch of heat.</p>
        <p>Such deliberate compositions are characteristic of the Southeast Asian kitchen, a quality also evident in Nem's other specialty, Vietnamese sandwiches. The Vietnamese love sandwiches, a remnant of French colonial days, and they are masters of their construction. The sandwich maker begins with a rectangle of firm bread spread with soft, earthy pate and layered with cilantro and vegetables marinated in nuoc cham, the Vietnamese condiment made of fish sauce, garlic, lime and sugar. You can then choose from grilled pork, marinated chicken breast or grilled shrimp ($5.50 each). The result is a sandwich whose ingredients sing out in harmony.</p>
        <p>One reason the salads and sandwiches are so good is that they are freshly made. Other selections, like bo cuon ($3.95), soft rolls stuffed with beef, herbs and jicama, are prefabricated and taste as if they've been sitting around.</p>
        <p>House-made lemonade ($2), on ice in a plastic cup, is tart and not too sweet.</p>
        <p>Nem, Grand Central Terminal, (212) 338-6810. Delivery: Second Avenue to Fifth Avenue, 34th Street to 57th Street.</p>
