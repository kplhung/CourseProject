        <p>Neither Gov. George W. Bush nor Vice President Al Gore has yet been able to pull ahead in the presidential campaign, with each man's weaknesses becoming magnified in the minds of voters, according to five national polls out this week. Mr. Bush has the edge in three of the surveys, Mr. Gore in two, but they are well within each poll's sampling error.</p>
        <p>In general, according to the polls, Mr. Bush, the Republican candidate, is seen as more affable than Mr. Gore, while Mr. Gore, the Democratic nominee, is seen as more capable than Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>When the polls are averaged, Mr. Bush's support is 45 percent, Mr. Gore's 44 percent, with Ralph Nader and Patrick J. Buchanan at less than 5 percent each.</p>
        <p>One survey, a CBS News poll, found Mr. Bush's voters to be somewhat more enthusiastic than Mr. Gore's, though each man's supporters express reservations about their chosen candidate.</p>
        <p>In that nationwide telephone poll taken Friday through Monday, with 687 likely voters, Mr. Bush is backed by 42 percent, Mr. Gore by 43 percent, Mr. Nader, the Green Party candidate, by 4 percent and Mr. Buchanan, the Reform party nominee, by 2 percent.</p>
        <p>The effect of the first presidential debate between Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore is unclear. While the polls indicate that a plurality of voters said Mr. Gore won the debate, which was held on Oct. 3, that does not appear to have translated into any appreciable new support for Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>The Pew Research Center began its poll on Oct. 4, the day between the presidential and vice presidential debates, and ended it on Sunday. In that poll of 722 likely voters, Mr. Bush had the support of 45 percent of the voters, Mr. Gore 44 percent, Mr. Nader 5 percent and Mr. Buchanan less than 1 percent. The poll was conducted by Princeton Survey Research Associates, which also conducted a poll for Newsweek.</p>
        <p>The Newsweek poll was also begun between the debates but ended before the weekend. The poll of 636 likely voters, taken Wednesday through Friday, put Mr. Bush at 43 percent, Mr. Gore at 44 percent, Mr. Nader at 6 percent and Mr. Buchanan at 1 percent.</p>
        <p>CNN participated in two surveys, one a tracking poll with three separate samples over three days, and the other a standard poll, using one sample over several days.</p>
        <p>The standard poll was conducted by Yankelovich Partners for Time Magazine and CNN, on Wednesday and Thursday, with 636 likely voters. Mr. Bush was the choice of 47 percent of the respondents, Mr. Gore, 45 percent, Mr. Nader, 4 percent and Mr. Buchanan, 1 percent.</p>
        <p>The tracking poll was more recent. It was conducted Saturday through Monday by Gallup for CNN/USA Today with 790 likely voters.</p>
        <p>That poll, which had shown a lead of nine percentage points for Mr. Gore before the debates, showed an eight-point lead for Mr. Bush earlier this week. Now, the poll shows Mr. Bush with a three-point edge over Mr. Gore, 47 percent to 44 percent, with Mr. Nader and Mr. Buchanan, respectively, garnering 3 percent and 1 percent.</p>
        <p>All the polls were nationwide telephone polls, and each has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.</p>
