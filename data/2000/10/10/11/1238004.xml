        <p>MR. POOLE pulled the red 1956 MG down a tight slot between the rows of cars, inches from a 1973 Jaguar V-12 convertible, a red 1957 Porsche 356-A coupe and a 1981 silver Rolls-Royce Corniche -- about $100,000 worth of vintage chrome and steel, whose value would be instantly and sharply depreciated by the smallest scratch.</p>
        <p>With a tap of the brake he stopped the MG a finger's width shy of a concrete column.</p>
        <p>''It ain't touching, is it?'' Mr. Poole asked, as an onlooker winced.  ''That's plenty of room.''</p>
        <p>Plenty of room to Mr. Poole is a near accident for most of us. That is why he is in charge of the showroom at the Vintage Car Store here, a warehouse space packed tight with collectible cars. He cares for and moves the cars, but he is more curator than custodian of the collection.</p>
        <p>His first name is Charlie, but everyone calls him Mr. Poole, including the store's owner, Gary Blankfort. His name conjures the image of an Old World butler, and Mr. Poole handles the cars with that sort of elegance.</p>
        <p>Mr. Poole, 69, spent 43 years parking cars in garages on Manhattan's Upper East Side, where the cars were expensive and so was the garage space.</p>
        <p>So he learned to maximize the close quarters by parking the cars within inches of each other. He would memorize the car positions and form cognitive maps.</p>
        <p>After retiring a few years ago, he began to miss caring for cars and went back to work.</p>
        <p>The showroom here holds only about 40 cars, but memorizing the layout helps when calculating how to extricate a Rolls-Royce ''in the hole,'' or hemmed into the rear corner. Mr. Poole thinks several moves ahead, like a chess player.</p>
        <p>Mr. Poole moved to New York City from his native Arkansas and became a prizefighter. He washed cars and then worked garages, and in 1964 he bought a two-family house in Spring Valley, N.Y., about 25 miles north of New York City. He raised four children there, and he says the tips from customers helped put his youngest daughter through Bryn Mawr. Recently, dressed neatly in an Oxford shirt with the cuffs buttoned, he waxed a red Ferrari.</p>
        <p>Mr. Poole is still at his fighting weight, fit and trim and ready to prove it. Shadow-boxing in the showroom, he snapped his left jab out over the hood of a brown Rolls and then, to display his agility around the cars, hopped nimbly over its door and slipped into the black leather bucket seat.</p>
        <p>In all his close encounters, he says, he has never so much as scratched a car. And after more than a year of watching him, Mr. Blankfort still isn't sure how he does it.</p>
        <p>''I'll ask him in the evening to get a car out from the back and come back in the morning, and it's out,'' he said. ''It's like magic dust.''</p>
        <p>Nor is he quite sure how his customers would manage without Mr. Poole. ''If they're ready to put down $50,000 for a car and Mr. Poole's not around, they have to wait for him,'' he said. ''There are cars back there I don't think I could ever get out.''</p>
