        <p>WHEN General Motors, the world's largest automaker, recently announced a joint venture with its dealers to establish a Web site offering cars online, it was following in the footsteps of dealers in classic cars.</p>
        <p>''The Internet has been absolutely overwhelming for us,'' said Roy Sayles, the owner of VIP Classics, a classic car dealer in San Diego. ''We get 4,000 hits a day.'' The Web site, www.vipclassics.com, which started about five years ago, Mr. Sayles said, ''has probably tripled our sales.''</p>
        <p>In fact, dealers and classic car enthusiasts have created a vast collection of Internet options. With ''classic cars'' as a search term, Google's Webometer clocks 75,900 matches in 0.5 seconds. So how is a true lover of the glorious fins of the '59 Chevy, the comforting bulges of a '67 Volkswagen Beetle or the majesty of the '62 Rolls-Royce Silver Cloud expected to maneuver through all that traffic?</p>
        <p>Take heart. First, there are a few landmarks. You cannot miss the site created by Hemmings Motor News, the huge and definitive magazine on the subject, based in Bennington, Vt.</p>
        <p>The site, www.hemmings.com, lists more than 9,000 car clubs, has a price checker, classified advertisements and a legislative alert along with appropriate lobbying groups. (Lobbying for what? Well, classic cars often cannot meet current emission standards, for one thing.)  There is also a slightly cumbersome search engine for event listings, and a list of stolen cars, searchable by vehicle identification number, state of registration, or make and model.</p>
        <p>ClassicNet at www.motorlit.com/classicnet, another landmark, collects links to groups dedicated to specific makes or models of cars, from Corvettes to microcars. And one option at Deja.com, www.deja.com/usenet, allows users to type in key words and search for matches through recent postings.</p>
        <p>Another possible route through the Internet, one that offers some fascinating detours, is to rev up a search engine and scan for matches.</p>
        <p>A photo gallery of wrecks called Junkyards of North Georgia, www.autohobbydigest.com/salvage.html, showed up on a Yahoo search, as does a guide to buying and protecting classic cars, www.kennish.com /securecar, created by a security consultant, John W. Kennish. (Other pages on his paranoia-provoking site include Preparing for Bomb Threats and The ATM.)</p>
        <p>There is yet one more way to navigate the otherwise undifferentiated mass of Web offerings. Caution: This method is said to be most unpleasant for 49 percent of the population. It's called asking directions.</p>
        <p>If this drastic action must be taken, the right source would be someone who knows classic cars and the Internet. Someone like Mike Lascualo, a Colorado resident who keeps a gallery of his classic cars at www.mrdos.com/cars.htm and who owns a 1959 Impala, a 1961 Impala and a 1962 Bel Air station wagon. ''And I almost have a 1960 Pontiac Bonneville,'' Mr. Lascualo said. He described his day job as ''an S.Q.L. server D.B.A.,'' which he translated as ''computer geek.''</p>
        <p>One of his favorite sites, he said, is The Gold Book at  www.manheimgold.com/index</p>
