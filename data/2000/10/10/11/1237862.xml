        <p>A Sudanese bid to win a two-year term on the Security Council was defeated today after four rounds of voting. The contested African seat finally went to the Indian Ocean island nation of Mauritius.</p>
        <p>Colombia, Ireland, Norway and Singapore also won seats on the 15-member Council for 2001-2002. Five of the 10 nonpermanent seats are rotated every year.</p>
        <p>The United States, led by Ambassador Richard C. Holbrooke and Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, had lobbied vigorously with foreign governments against the candidacy of Sudan, which the Clinton administration has accused of sponsoring terrorism.</p>
        <p>Human rights groups also campaigned against the Arab-led Islamic Sudanese government, accusing it of genocide because of its brutal repression of black African Sudanese southerners, who are Christians or followers of traditional religions.</p>
        <p>In an interview after the vote, Mr. Holbrooke called his lobbying effort ''the A.B.S. strategy -- Anybody but Sudan.''</p>
        <p>''What a disaster it would have been for the United Nations if Sudan had gotten on the Security Council!'' he exclaimed. ''This is a big win for the United Nations and for Africa and for Mauritius.''</p>
        <p>Mauritius gained strong support from several dozen other small island nations, as well as the southern African countries and Uganda, none of which accepted the Organization of African Unity's decision to back Sudan.</p>
        <p>A number of Latin American nations, protesting abuses against Sudanese Christians, also decided to back Mauritius. Most Europeans followed suit, diplomats said. And India, with ethnic ties to Mauritius, lobbied for it.</p>
        <p>Mauritius has always resented being portrayed as the ''American candidate.'' Anund P. Neewoor, Mauritius's ambassador to the United Nations, said in an interview last week that his government had been at least two months ahead of Sudan in deciding to run for the seat being vacated by Namibia.</p>
        <p>Mali and Tunisia also hold African seats among the five places set aside for African and Asian nations in an antiquated division of the world. Their two-year terms expire at the end of 2001.</p>
        <p>''Mauritius did not decide to be a candidate at the behest of the United States,'' Mr. Neewoor said. ''But if the U.S. opposition to Sudan by implication means that they campaign for Mauritius, then there is not much we can do about that.''</p>
        <p>In the only other contested council race, Ireland and Norway defeated Italy to take two seats assigned to the Western Europe and Others Group.</p>
        <p>The terms of three other nonpermanent members besides Mali and Tunisia will expire at the end of next year: Bangladesh, Jamaica and Ukraine. The five permanent members, all of whom have veto power, are Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States.</p>
