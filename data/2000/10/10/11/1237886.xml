        <p>The Mashantucket Pequot Indian tribe, which operates the Foxwoods casino in southeastern Connecticut, has illegally distributed $5.8 million in prescription drugs obtained under two federal discount drug programs to non-Indian employees, according to a recent audit by the federal Department of Health and Human Services.</p>
        <p>The audit, conducted by the department's Office of Inspector General, found that about 82 percent of the $7.1 million in prescription drugs obtained under two federal discount programs by the tribe during 1998 and 1999 were provided illegally to non-Indian employees covered by the tribe's health insurance plan.</p>

        <p>The Mashantucket Pequot Indian tribe, which operates the Foxwoods casino in southeastern Connecticut, has illegally distributed $5.8 million in prescription drugs obtained under two federal discount drug programs to non-Indian employees, according to a recent audit by the federal Department of Health and Human Services.</p>
        <p>The audit, conducted by the department's Office of Inspector General, found that about 82 percent of the $7.1 million in prescription drugs obtained under two federal discount programs by the tribe during 1998 and 1999 were provided illegally to non-Indian employees covered by the tribe's health insurance plan.</p>
        <p>According to the audit, federal law intends the discount programs solely to benefit Indians unless the tribe determines that ''reasonable alternative'' prescription drug services are not available to its non-Indian employees. The audit found that non-discounted drugs were readily available at numerous local stores, including the tribe's own pharmacy on its reservation near Ledyard, Conn.</p>
        <p>While there are only about 650 registered members of the Mashantucket Pequot tribe, Foxwoods has grown into the largest casino in the world, generating more than $1 million in revenue a day and employing about 11,500 people. Among the benefits it advertises to prospective full-time employees is a ''no-cost prescription program with on-site delivery.''</p>
        <p>In a statement, the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation said it had a different interpretation of the laws governing the discount programs. ''The tribal government considers tribal employees and their families to be members of the tribal community for purposes of health care,'' the tribal nation said.</p>
        <p>''Employees have been included as participants in the tribe's Indian Health Service contracts -- as authorized by federal law -- so that they might enjoy the benefits of obtaining pharmaceuticals at the lowest possible price,'' the statement added.</p>
        <p>The Mashantucket Pequot tribe has owned its own pharmaceutical distribution system, called PRxN, since 1991, even before it opened Foxwoods. Originally a small health service for tribal members, PRxN is now a huge business that generates more than $15 million in revenue and distributes drugs to fill more than 250,000 prescriptions each year.</p>
        <p>PRxN supplies the reservation pharmacy, its own tribal health plan and other Indian tribes and several non-Indian groups that provide prescription drug benefits, according to the audit. A spokesman for the tribe, Arthur Henik, said those groups include the American Automobile Association and the faculty of Connecticut College in New London.</p>
        <p>The tribal nation said more than 35,000 pharmacies across the country use PRxN and members and employees of 25 Native American tribes have health insurance with a PRxN plan. The nation describes the business as a ''pharmacy benefit manager.'' It charges a handling fee for the drugs it distributes rather than marking up the sales price.</p>
        <p>The non-Indian groups supplied by PRxN receive drugs purchased at regular wholesale rates negotiated for health maintenance organizations, according to the audit. Mr. Henik said the tribe does not disclose whether PRxN makes a profit.</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman for the Health Department said officials in the Office of Inspector General could not be reached last night to comment on the audit. The discount drug programs for Indians are generally administered by the Indian Health Service, an agency within the federal Health Department. But tribes can administer the programs themselves, which the Mashantucket Pequots have done since 1996.</p>
        <p>Mr. Henik, the tribal spokesman, said the Health Department had not yet taken any action against the tribe. But in a memorandum that accompanied the audit, the Health Department's inspector general, June Gibbs Brown, warned that the wrongful distribution of discounted drugs could endanger the entire program.</p>
        <p>''Evidence of program abuse could prompt Congress to reconsider the future of discounted drug programs, which would ultimately affect the millions of federal beneficiaries who now depend upon them for their health care,'' Ms. Brown wrote in a memo to the director of the Indian Health Service, Michael H. Trujillo. The memo was quoted by The Associated Press, which first reported on the audit yesterday.</p>
        <p>In its statement, the tribal nation questioned the findings in the audit. ''Despite the fact that the Indian Health Service has permitted this practice in the past, the Office of the Inspector General has made a determination that these employees are no longer eligible to participate in this program,'' the nation said. ''We question the legal basis for the Inspector General's report.''</p>
