        <p>TEN years ago, the wines of the Priorato region of Spain were considered primitive and rustic.

        <p>TEN years ago, the wines of the Priorato region of Spain were considered primitive and rustic. This area, high in the country's northeastern hills, clung to its old-fashioned methods for making highly alcoholic oxidized wines even as nearby regions like Penedes were gaining worldwide attention for exciting, innovative blends.</p>
        <p>It's amazing how quickly and completely things have changed. Today, the powerful Priorato reds are considered among the most exciting wines in Spain, and though many are expensive, the wines on the low end can offer extraordinary values.</p>
        <p>Priorato's ascent is a story that has played out in many other unfamiliar wine regions. New investment, and more modern methods of growing grapes and making wines, combined with an artisanal emphasis on quality over mass production, sets a new standard. Once the acclaim (and the money) starts rolling in, other producers clamber aboard.</p>
        <p>But in Priorato (Priorat in the local Catalon language), innovation has not meant a complete break from the past. Winemakers still use the traditional grapes, garnacha and carinena, better known by their French names, grenache and carignan, sometimes blended with other grapes like cabernet sauvignon. The wines are inky and dense, rich enough to stand up to the new oak barrels in which they are often aged, but less tannic than you might expect for wines of such power. The best show remarkable depth, yet are easy to enjoy.</p>
        <p>The more expensive Priorato wines, selling for $50 to $100 a bottle, are often described as cult wines, yet I've always managed to find one or two in good wine shops. Similarly, because the region is so small, even the inexpensive wines are in short supply, yet they are still fairly easy to find -- for now.</p>
        <p>J. M. FUENTES --, GRAN -- CLOS -- 1996: $40  Rich, powerful, round and delicious, with great depth.</p>
        <p>CELLERS -- VILELLA DE LA -- CARTOIXA --, FRA -- FULCO -- 1996: $40  Complex and intense, with both sweetness and power.</p>
        <p>CELLER -- CECILIO --, L'ESPILL -- 1997: $38  Deeply fruity, with well-knit flavors smoothed by cabernet sauvignon.</p>
        <p>MAS -- IGNEUS --, BARRANC -- DELS -- CLOSOS -- 1998: $13  Fruity, ripe and delicious with a light layer of tannins.</p>
        <p>ALVARO -- PALACIOS --, LES -- TERRASSES -- 1997: $25  Round and smooth flavors, with potent cherry and berry aromas.</p>
        <p>VINICOLA -- DEL -- PRIORAT --, ONIX -- 1998: $12  Bright, fruity, smooth and stylish.</p>
        <p>Listed in order of preference. Prices are those paid in various wine shops in the New York region.</p>
