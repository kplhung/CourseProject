        <p>Denny Neagle got an early start on running a lot of three-ball counts last night, and the capacity crowd at Yankee Stadium started to groan.</p>
        <p>Even though Neagle was not giving up a lot of hits, he rolled up his pitch count like the numbers on a pinball machine.</p>
        <p>That meant the Yankees had to go to their bullpen early, giving the crowd another reason to groan.</p>
        <p>As every Yankees fan knows, Joe Torre has not had a lot of faith in his long relievers lately.</p>
        <p>But a new trend has developed. Although the Yankees lost to Seattle last night, 2-0, the Yankees' long relievers have pitched two strong games in a row.</p>
        <p>''It was a well-pitched game on both sides,'' Yankees reliever Jeff Nelson said.</p>
        <p>Last Sunday, Mike Stanton and Nelson pitched three and a third innings of shutout ball in a 7-5 victory over Oakland, helping the Yankees reach the next round of the playoffs.</p>
        <p>Nelson was superb when the Yankees really needed him to stay in the game last night.</p>
        <p>He entered the game at the moment that the Mariners were about to break it open, and the tall right-hander with the herky-jerky motion held firm.</p>
        <p>Then Randy Choate and Jason Grimsley pitched a scoreless ninth inning.</p>
        <p>''It was 2-0,'' Nelson said. ''I had to hold them down to see if we could come back.''</p>
        <p>Seattle had taken a two-run lead on a towering leadoff home run by Alex Rodriguez in the sixth inning.</p>
        <p>Neagle got Edgar Martinez and John Olerud to ground out, but Torre needed a right-hander to get the dangerous Jay Buhner. He chose Nelson.</p>
        <p>''It wasn't very cold once you got the adrenaline going,'' Nelson said.</p>
        <p>Nelson struck out Buhner with a beautiful pitch that nicked a corner of the strike zone. Nelson allowed David Bell to reach base with one out in the seventh, but he got Mark McLemore to ground into a fielder's choice and Raul Ibanez to lift a little pop fly in foul territory to Jorge Posada.</p>
        <p>Nelson bought the Yankees a little more time in the eighth inning. He struck out Mike Cameron and Rodriguez, no small order. Then he got Martinez to make his fourth out of the game by popping out to Luis Sojo.</p>
        <p>He finished with four strikeouts and allowed only one hit in two and a third innings. Better for the Yankees, the game stayed close.</p>
        <p>''He's the guy to go to in that situation,'' Neagle said of Nelson. ''He was at the right place at the right time.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees' offense scuffled all night, especially the heart of the order. The Yankees gave up enough runs to lose, but now they have their best postseason pitcher ready for Game 2 of the four-of-seven-game series today.</p>
        <p>That would be Orlando Hernandez.</p>
        <p>He said through an intepreter before last night's game that he was preparing for today's big game as if it were another regular-season game. That, he said, was not necessarily a bad thing. He puts everything he has into getting ready for every game.</p>
        <p>Then Hernandez smiled and tacked on a postscript. He does not know much more English than ''I play for the Yankees in New York,'' but he knew he had been misunderstood.</p>
        <p>''Excuse me if you don't understand some of my responses,'' he said, smiling again. ''I'm not the brightest guy.''</p>
        <p>He and Mariano Rivera have been the Yankees' toughest pitchers in October.</p>
        <p>Two days after an excellent start in a Yankees' victory, Hernandez got an out in relief in Sunday's Yankees' victory, not that the unusual bullpen appearance made any difference to him by last night. He said he felt good.</p>
        <p>''Tomorrow is another day,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''All we have to do is keep holding them down,'' Nelson said, ''and, hopefully, we can score more than they do.''</p>
