        <p>BORGE-Sanna Sarabel. Beloved wife of entertainer, Victor Borge, died at their home in Greenwich, CT, on September 19th. Born in Otwell, Indiana, the former Sarabel Scraper started her own business representing commercial artists in Chicago, Illinois. There she met Victor Borge, at which point she gave up her clients to devote her energies to his burgeoning worldwide career. In 1953 they married. Mrs. Borge, an avid reader and gardening enthusiast, traveled extensively with her husband and, with him, created homes for their family in Denmark, Southbury, CT, St. Croix (U.S. Virgin Islands), Greenwich, CT and Portugal. She is survived by her husband, a sister (Bettye Downey of Dayton, Ohio), five children (three daughters: Sanna Feirstein of New York City, Janet Crowle of St. Michaels, MD, Frederikke Borge of North Egremont, MA; and two sons: Ronald Borge of Rowayton, CT, and Victor Bernhard (Vebe) Borge of New York City) and nine grandchildren. A private service was held on September 22nd. Donations may be made in her name to The Greenwich Hospital.</p>
