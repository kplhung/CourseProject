        <p>HOW many home cooks have the time or inclination on a busy weeknight to create a velvety leek puree, prepare a glossy lamb jus and coat perfectly trimmed lamb loins with a crust of fine black trumpet mushroom crumbs? Not many, even if they are sophisticated cooks.</p>
        <p>But starting next week, the ingredients for seven restaurant-quality dinners for two, created by seven top chefs, will be available in kits. All the home cook has to do is follow simple cooking directions and serve.</p>
        <p>No matter how elaborate the dishes sound, Impromptu Gourmet, in Valley Cottage, N.Y., promises that they will take less than 30 minutes from when the box is opened to when the food is served. Based on the three dinners that I tried, the estimate is on target. No special equipment is needed to heat the sauces and vegetables or to cook the fish or meat.</p>
        <p>And no special skills. The explicit, easily followed instructions usually involve no more than a quick saute or putting meat on a grill. If you have never seared raw tuna or lamb, you will learn how. Nothing is put in a microwave oven.</p>
        <p>Take the lamb dish above, which was created by Jean-Georges Vongerichten, the chef and owner of Jean Georges and other restaurants. The kit includes raw crusted lamb loins, ready to sear; finely minced chives; and leek puree, lamb jus, precooked mushrooms and wild rice, all to be reheated. The ingredients are fresh, not frozen, and are packed mostly in Cryovac. They have a shelf life of three days in the refrigerator.</p>
        <p>At $35, the kits are not inexpensive, but I think they are worth the money.</p>
        <p>Impromptu Gourmet is not the only company to jump on what may be a trend. Cookbox in Long Island City, Queens, offers similar dinner kits, also taking 30 minutes to prepare, but on a more modest level (more ethnic dishes, less expensive ingredients, no top chefs). Cookbox's meals run $15.95 to $26.95 for two servings and are available for delivery in parts of Manhattan from (800) 266-5269 or www.cookbox.com.</p>
        <p>Kits like these save you hours of shopping for ingredients, like the microgreens that David Burke, the chef at Park Avenue Cafe, uses with his marinated grilled filet mignon with grilled tomatoes and asparagus on a bed of polenta.</p>
        <p>And even more important, the quality of the ingredients is, by and large, vastly superior to what a consumer will find, even in high-end markets. The two nine-ounce slabs of tuna in the kit designed by Peter Kelly, the owner of Xaviar's in Piermont and Garrison, N.Y., are strictly restaurant caliber. Mr. Kelly, whose  easy and delicious tuna with wasabi crust goes on a seaweed salad, is a  founder of Impromptu Gourmet.</p>
        <p>Gray Kunz, the former chef at Lespinasse, created seared red snapper with a tamarind and lime-leaf reduction. Eric Ripert of Le Bernardin made shrimp with bok choy and soy-ginger vinaigrette. Charlie Palmer of Aureole created duck with pomegranate molasses, and Michael Romano, of Union Square Cafe, offers lamb chops with a casserole of Italian white beans and salad.</p>
        <p>The chefs said they became involved in the project because of the quality Impromptu Gourmet guaranteed. ''The chefs insisted that we go to their suppliers for the ingredients, and we did,'' Mr. Kelly said.</p>
        <p>Impromptu Gourmet kits will be sold at Zabar's, Balducci's and Citarella in Manhattan; Citarella on Long Island; and at Kings Super Markets in New Jersey. Delivery will be available from urbanfetch .com in New York City, and overnight by Federal Express from www.impromptugourmet.com or by calling (877) 346-7766.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kelly said the company plans to introduce desserts by the end of the year. What's next, flowers for the table? It's working on that, too.</p>
