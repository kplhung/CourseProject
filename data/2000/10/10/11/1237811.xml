        <p>THE heirloom tomato stew at Quince in Midtown has a haunting undertone, mysterious but somehow familiar. So does the toasted brioche with the foie gras at Beacon nearby.</p>
        <p>Both dishes get that subtle floral note from some of the most assertive perfumes known to cooks: orange blossom water in the tomato stew, rose water in the brioche.</p>
        <p>More and more New York chefs appear to be experimenting with these ancient essences, which have traditionally been used in Middle Eastern and Indian desserts and in cocktails like the Ramos gin fizz. Both are made from essential oils of the flowers and actually hint at the flavor of the blossoms in their names. When used with discretion, just a few drops at a time, they can elevate plain-vanilla dishes or temper the harsher notes of other ingredients.</p>
        <p>Floyd Cardoz, the chef of Tabla on Madison Square, who grew up with rose-scented Indian food, says rose water rounds out the flavor of lamb and desserts. But he advises using it ''not as the primary flavor, but as the second, third or fourth note in a dish.''</p>
        <p>He adds it to orange segments with rosemary and serves the mixture over kulfi, a traditional ice milk. The rose water enlivens the bland creaminess of the kulfi, while taming the assertive pininess of the rosemary.</p>
        <p>At Quince, Morgen Jacobson borrows from a Sicilian combination of orange and tomato in his vegetable stew with olives; the water evokes orange without citrus. The stew is used as a base for other dishes, particularly with clams and scallops.</p>
        <p>''Rose water is like vanilla or almond extract,'' said Jim Botsacos, the chef at Molyvos in Midtown. ''If you taste it on its own, you don't get the full effect of it. You need something to carry the whole flavor and let it blossom and bloom.''</p>
        <p>Desserts at Molyvos include roasted figs with rose water syrup and yogurt and phyllo rolls called bourekia that are filled with a fresh Greek cheese and served with a citrus syrup scented with rose water.</p>
        <p>Katy Sparks of Quilty's in SoHo blends orange blossom honey with orange blossom water as a syrup for buckwheat pancakes, with a dab of acidic creme fraiche to keep it from becoming too cloying.</p>
        <p>Bar Six in Greenwich Village is serving a Rozie Petal martini, with vodka, creme de framboise and rose water.</p>
        <p>Orange blossom is usually more intensely perfumed than rose water, although different brands will be more or less delicate. Some may be sweeter, or more floral. Taste them first to determine their strength.</p>
        <p>Both can be bought in specialty markets and in some supermarkets. A three-ounce bottle will keep for years.</p>
        <p>BUCKWHEAT PANCAKES WITH ORANGE BLOSSOM WATER  Adapted from Quilty's  Time: 1 1/2 hours</p>
        <p>1 cup milk</p>
        <p>2 packages active dry yeast</p>
        <p>1/2 teaspoon sugar</p>
        <p>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</p>
        <p>1/2 cup buckwheat flour</p>
        <p>1/4 teaspoon salt</p>
        <p>1/4 cup melted butter; more for frying</p>
        <p>3 large eggs, separated</p>
        <p>2 tablespoons orange blossom water</p>
        <p>1/2 cup orange blossom honey</p>
        <p>1/2 cup creme fraiche</p>
        <p>1 pint fresh berries.</p>
        <p>1. In a saucepan, heat milk until lukewarm. Stir in yeast and sugar. In a large bowl, whisk together flours and salt. Whisk in yeast mixture,  1/2 cup warm water and  1/4 cup melted butter. Whisk in egg yolks, and cover bowl with plastic wrap. Let batter rest in a warm place until it doubles in bulk, 45 to 60 minutes. In a small bowl, stir together orange blossom water and honey.</p>
        <p>2. When batter has risen, beat egg whites into stiff peaks. Fold whites into batter.</p>
        <p>3. In a large skillet over medium heat, melt enough butter to coat surface. Drop 2 tablespoons batter onto skillet for each pancake, leaving space for pancakes to spread, and fry about a minute on each side, until golden. Repeat until all batter has been used.</p>
        <p>4. To serve, drizzle orange blossom water and honey mixture over pancakes. Top with creme fraiche and berries.</p>
        <p>Yield: 8 to 10 servings.</p>
        <p>VANILLA BEAN KULFI WITH ROSE WATER ORANGES  Adapted from Tabla  Time: 2 1/2 hours, plus 4 hours' freezing</p>
        <p>5 1/2  cups heavy cream</p>
        <p>2  cups milk</p>
        <p>1 1/2  cups sugar</p>
        <p>1  vanilla bean, split lengthwise</p>
        <p>Pinch of salt</p>
        <p>3  sprigs fresh rosemary</p>
        <p>1/2  teaspoon rosewater, or to taste</p>
        <p>6  small oranges, preferably blood oranges.</p>
        <p>1. In a large wide pot, bring cream, milk, 3/4 cup sugar and vanilla bean to a simmer. Let simmer over low heat, stirring often, until  mixture is reduced by one half, about 2 1/2 hours. Stir in salt.</p>
        <p>2. Strain mixture, then pour it into a 1-quart loaf pan or souffle dish. Cover with plastic and freeze until solid, about 4 hours.</p>
        <p>3. Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, combine  remaining 3/4 cup sugar with 1/2 cup water and rosemary. Bring mixture to a simmer and stir until sugar dissolves. Turn off heat and let infuse until syrup cools. Remove  rosemary, then stir in rosewater.</p>
        <p>4. Peel oranges and cut them into segments, removing white membranes. Toss them with rose water syrup.</p>
        <p>5. To serve, unmold kulfi and slice it into 8 portions. Top with oranges and syrup.</p>
        <p>Yield: 8 servings.</p>
