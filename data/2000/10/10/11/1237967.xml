        <p>The giant consumer products company Procter &amp; Gamble expects to take half of its orders from major retailers like Wal-Mart over the Internet within 12 months, A. G. Lafley, P.&amp; G.'s chief executive, said. Mr. Lafley said the company would also begin buying its raw materials through online auctions. The move is part of P.&amp; G.'s plan to cut costs and cast off ancillary brands after 17 disappointing quarters. Analysts characterized the company's targets for Internet sales as aggressive, but necessary. ''You usually don't break out of a slump by setting timid goals,'' said Edward Keon of Prudential Securities.</p>
