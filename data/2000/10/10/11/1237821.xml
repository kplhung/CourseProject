        <p>Strauss's somberly beautiful late work for 23 strings, ''Metamorphosen,'' is usually performed at orchestra concerts. So James Levine could have included it on one of the programs that the Met Orchestra will perform at Carnegie Hall this season. Instead, and much more interestingly, Mr. Levine conducted this thick-textured, ruminative 35-minute work at Sunday afternoon's concert by the Met Chamber Ensemble upstairs in Weill Recital Hall. The chance to hear ''Metamorphosen'' as a chamber work in a chamber hall was just one of the pleasures of this engrossing concert.</p>
        <p>Strauss finished ''Metamorphosen'' in the spring of 1945 as World War II was coming to its cataclysmic end. It is an elegy by an old man for the German cultural life that he had revered and flourished in. One could say that Strauss might have sorrowed instead over the systematic destruction of human life by the Nazi regime. Still, Strauss's music touches on universal feelings of loss, despair and pointless tragedy.</p>
        <p>''Metamorphosen'' presents a specific technical challenge that has long made it a problematic piece to perform. The score is subtitled  ''Study for 23 Solo Strings,'' and Strauss indeed writes music for multiple, overlapping string parts of 6, 12 and more at a time. In places it can sound like all 23 players, oblivious of one another, are busy with their own lines of counterpoint. In many performances, ''Metamorphosen'' seems an indistinct mass of lushly poignant string writing.</p>
        <p>By treating the work like chamber music, Mr. Levine and his players strove for clarity in the playing, not just in individual lines but also direction and structure. The rhetoric of the music never seemed so clear. Though the performance plumbed the work's emotional depths, Mr. Levine and his players had decided, it seemed, that if they attended to matters of articulation and phrasing the expression would take care of itself. In a way, this made the music even more moving.</p>
        <p>The second half offered Schoenberg's seldom-heard Serenade, Op. 24, first performed in 1923, and Stravinsky's often-heard concert suite from ''L'Histoire du Soldat,'' first performed in 1920. Hearing them in succession as performed here, you were struck by the similarities between composers thought to be at odds during this period.</p>
        <p>Imaginatively scored for clarinet, bass clarinet, guitar, mandolin and string trio, the Serenade was one of several pieces Schoenberg worked on simultaneously during the early 1920's while devising his system of 12-tone composition. By applying his radical new language in its tryout stage to time-tested Neo-Classical genres and dance forms, Schoenberg created a work in which there is a bracing reciprocity between old and new. The bass-baritone Richard Paul Fink brought his stentorian voice to the work's one vocal movement, a setting of a Petrarch sonnet in German translation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levine and his players approached ''L'Histoire,'' also scored for seven instruments including trombone, trumpet and percussion, not as simply the incidental music to a dramatic narrative but as a modern and complex score. The result was riveting, and served to introduce the orchestra's splendid new concertmaster, Nick Eanet, who played the tricky violin solos with brilliance and elan.</p>
