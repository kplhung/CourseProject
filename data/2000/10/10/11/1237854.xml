      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial says that Congress in 1966 gave away billions of dollars in new spectrum rights to big broadcasters without demanding anything meaningful in return; supports proposals by Federal Commmunications Commission chairman William Kennard that would pressure these broadcasters to speed up their promised conversion to digital television</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Chairman William Kennard of the Federal Communications Commission called on Congress yesterday to force broadcasters to speed up their promised conversion to digital television. That is a polite way of asking Congress to reverse its craven decision four years ago to give the politically powerful broadcasters spectrum rights worth perhaps $70 billion without demanding anything meaningful in return. The broadcasters were supposed to use the new spectrum to provide high-resolution pictures or new interactive data and information services. But they have little financial incentive to roll out these expensive new services anytime soon. Yesterday Mr. Kennard blew the whistle.</p>
        <p>In 1996 Congress gave broadcasters enough new spectrum to broadcast either one channel of super-high-resolution digital programs or several channels that could be used for digital interactive services or TV programs of high, but not super-high, resolution. Existing broadcasters were also allowed to keep the spectrum they now use to broadcast analog programs until at least 2006 -- or until 85 percent of American homes are converted to digital television, which could be decades from now.</p>

        <p>Chairman William Kennard of the Federal Communications Commission called on Congress yesterday to force broadcasters to speed up their promised conversion to digital television. That is a polite way of asking Congress to reverse its craven decision four years ago to give the politically powerful broadcasters spectrum rights worth perhaps $70 billion without demanding anything meaningful in return. The broadcasters were supposed to use the new spectrum to provide high-resolution pictures or new interactive data and information services. But they have little financial incentive to roll out these expensive new services anytime soon. Yesterday Mr. Kennard blew the whistle.</p>
        <p>In 1996 Congress gave broadcasters enough new spectrum to broadcast either one channel of super-high-resolution digital programs or several channels that could be used for digital interactive services or TV programs of high, but not super-high, resolution. Existing broadcasters were also allowed to keep the spectrum they now use to broadcast analog programs until at least 2006 -- or until 85 percent of American homes are converted to digital television, which could be decades from now.</p>
        <p>By giving the new spectrum away instead of auctioning it off to the highest bidders, Congress deprived the treasury, and thus taxpayers, of tens of billions of dollars. The giveaway also kept the new spectrum out of the hands of bidders eager to sell digital services. The new spectrum went instead to incumbent broadcasters, who have dawdled.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kennard proposes three fixes. He wants Congress to eliminate the 85 percent threshold. He wants to impose a tax on broadcasters that fail to convert to digital broadcasting by 2006. He also wants to require that TV sets sold after 2002 come with a chip capable of receiving digital signals, guaranteeing broadcasters and manufacturers a large audience. The chip would cost about $100 today, but a fraction of that once it is mass produced.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kennard's three-pronged approach is designed to propel the market from a nearly all-analog world to an all-digital world. But if the approach fails and broadcasters refuse to go along, they would at least have to pay a tax for their recalcitrance.</p>
