      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The Starrett-Lehigh Building was constructed in the early 1930's for a world that no longer exists, when the West Side of Manhattan was crowded with rail lines and docks that brought raw materials to the thriving manufacturing sector of the city and then shipped finished products out. The building's floors were built to handle heavy loads, and elevators were capable of lifting entire trucks to upper floors.</p>
        <p>Today, the huge industrial structure, which occupies the block bounded by the West Side Highway and 11th Avenue and West 26th and 27th Streets, is undergoing a renaissance as an office building, presenting architects and designers with the challenge of converting the old warehouse and manufacturing spaces into attractive workplaces. To link the two eras, some are using the same materials, and in some cases the same manufacturers, that were used in the original building.</p>

        <p>The Starrett-Lehigh Building was constructed in the early 1930's for a world that no longer exists, when the West Side of Manhattan was crowded with rail lines and docks that brought raw materials to the thriving manufacturing sector of the city and then shipped finished products out. The building's floors were built to handle heavy loads, and elevators were capable of lifting entire trucks to upper floors.</p>
        <p>Today, the huge industrial structure, which occupies the block bounded by the West Side Highway and 11th Avenue and West 26th and 27th Streets, is undergoing a renaissance as an office building, presenting architects and designers with the challenge of converting the old warehouse and manufacturing spaces into attractive workplaces. To link the two eras, some are using the same materials, and in some cases the same manufacturers, that were used in the original building.</p>
        <p>Despite its industrial origins, the building, with its bands of horizontal windows and curving walls at setbacks, was always noted for its design, which was by Russell G. and Walter M. Cory with Yasuo Matsui.  It was designated a landmark in 1986 and was the site of the office of the  designer and architect R. Buckminster Fuller.</p>
        <p>The railroad tracks serving the building have long since been removed, and all that remains of that era is a floating dock at the edge of the Hudson River at 26th Street, where railroad boxcars were once loaded onto barges bound for New Jersey.</p>
        <p>The building is attracting a different sort of tenant these days, as are many of the onetime factories and warehouses on the West Side. Office users are flooding into them to take advantage of expansive floors, and to escape rents that have risen above $60 a square foot in Midtown. Rents in the area are half those in Midtown, though they, too, are rising.</p>
        <p>One of the new tenants is Concrete,  an Internet consulting company that is leasing 40,000 square feet on the eighth floor of the 19-story structure. The challenge of designing the interior of the space for a company that helps others to design and operate Web businesses was to accommodate high-tech needs without losing the original muscular feel of the building.</p>
        <p>''We signed our lease just after Christmas last year,'' said Aaron Cohen, Concrete's chief executive. ''There we were at the end of the millennium, moving into the center of the Industrial Revolution.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cohen chose space on the north side of the building, giving up views of the New Jersey Palisades available on the west side of the structure. On its west side, he said, ''There is a hum from the West Side Highway. You have to be pretty high up not to hear it.''</p>
        <p>Making use of the building's celebrated windows and bringing light deep into the interior was a major design goal, said Louise Harpman, one of the founders of Specht Harpman, the architects for the project. The result was an open space plan with work stations around the periphery of the space and conference rooms and other closed spaces grouped in the middle.</p>
        <p>The air-conditioning ducts are mounted as closely as possible to the ceiling to allow exterior light to penetrate with little obstruction, and electric lights are clamped to support columns rather than hung from above for the same reason.</p>
        <p>The result is a space suffused with natural light. ''Every work station has a desk lamp, but you notice that none of them are turned on,'' Mr. Cohen said. ''They don't get turned on until nightfall.''</p>
        <p>The interior entrance of the Concrete space is also largely glass, evoking the design role of the exterior windows. And the windows to the main conference room were made by the same company that made the windows for the original building, Bliss Cashier Steel Products. ''They started in 1922 and they are still in business,'' said Scott Specht, the other founder of the architectural firm.</p>
        <p>The entrance overlooks the internal loading docks served by the truck-carrying elevators, although they are usually used today to move the vans of overnight delivery services from floor to floor. ''We do not have a FedEx box,'' said Mr. Cohen  ''The FedEx truck is our box.''</p>
        <p>One feature of the building is the large number of round water tanks on the roof. That image had been brought inside, where the conference rooms have semicircular fiberglass shells at one end. The notion is that the conference rooms are think tanks, Mr. Specht said.</p>
        <p>Most of the furniture in the space, which Concrete has occupied for about a month, was designed by Specht Harpman for this office. In keeping with the industrial tone,  steel and Douglas fir are the main materials. Not surprisingly, given the company name, the floors are not carpeted. Instead, the raw concrete  has been cleaned and polished.</p>
        <p>One design problem was the need for employees to have access to corkboards to hang renderings and diagrams of works in progress. In a space without walls, finding a place to hang the boards was difficult.</p>
        <p>The solution was to attach the boards to sliding steel frames. When needed, they can be pulled out near  work stations for as long as necessary, and then slid back parallel to one another to minimize their impact on the space.</p>
