        <p>The violence in Israel and the Palestinian territories has left American Jews feeling agonized, confused, angry and, in the case of many, more doubtful than ever that Yasir Arafat and his people truly want peace.</p>
        <p>Probably no group is more shocked and numbed by recent events than those Jews who strongly supported the Oslo peace agreements and who believed that Israel and a Palestinian state could exist in harmony.</p>
        <p>The fierceness of the rioting, the inability or unwillingness of Mr. Arafat to stop it and the desecration of a Jewish shrine in Nablus -- these and other factors have combined to make many of these people ask themselves if they were wrong. A conviction is growing that Mr. Arafat in particular betrayed their trust.</p>
        <p>''There is deep and depressed pessimism,'' said Letty Cottin Pogrebin, a New York writer and a former president of Americans for Peace Now. ''It's worse than if we were starting from scratch, because there's a sense of high expectations being dashed.''</p>
        <p>Shulamith Bahat, acting executive director of the American Jewish Committee, talked yesterday about ''a sense of asymmetry.''</p>
        <p>''There is a huge, huge gap,'' she said, ''in the approach to peace between Israel and the Palestinians.''</p>
        <p>Among American Jews who thought from the start that the Oslo agreements were Israel's big mistake, a common reaction to the violence and Mr. Arafat's performance has been on the order of: What did you expect?</p>
        <p>''It was never a peace process -- it was a war process,'' said Ruth R. Wisse, a professor of Yiddish and comparative literature at Harvard University and a critic of the accords since they were signed in 1993. ''Nothing could be clearer today,'' she said, ''and nothing was clearer even in 1993.''</p>
        <p>Whether politically left or right, or clinging to the center, Jews in this country have rallied round the Israelis. Even those American Jews who believe that the Israeli Army may have been too quick to fire on rock-throwing Palestinians are not about to say so publicly right now. Some are also reluctant to express their anger at Ariel Sharon, the Israeli opposition leader, even if they believe that his visit two weeks ago to a site in Jerusalem sacred to Muslims and Jews with a group of armed bodyguards set off the riots.</p>
        <p>Instead, American Jewish groups have described the violence as an extreme overreaction to Mr. Sharon's perceived offense. They are furious at the United Nations for yet another Security Council resolution condemning Israel, and unhappy with the Clinton administration for not vetoing it. Some denounce the news media, whose coverage they feel has been reflexively pro-Palestinian. ''The onus is put strictly on Israel,'' said Malcolm Hoenlein, executive vice chairman of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations. ''If soldiers were facing a riot anywhere else in the world, what would they do?''</p>
        <p>And many Jews, pro-Oslo or not, felt horror at the desecration of the Jewish shrine known as Joseph's Tomb, in Nablus, and the brutal killing of an American-born rabbi who went there to save Torah scrolls from destruction.</p>
        <p>That violent act, and the fact that Mr. Arafat's armed militias did nothing to protect the site, brought out the worst fears among Jews who are unconvinced that Jewish holy places will be safe under Palestinian sovereignty. They recalled the widespread destruction of synagogues and other Jewish sites when the Old City of Jerusalem was under Arab control, before Israel's victory in the 1967 Middle East war.</p>
        <p>To some Jews, such desecrations are a sign that the Palestinians regard all Jews as the enemy. ''They're not fighting for a state,'' said Morton A. Klein, national president of the Zionist Organization of America. ''They're fighting for an end to the Jewish state.''</p>
        <p>Still, others are not prepared to give up on peace talks entirely.</p>
        <p>Lewis Roth, a spokesman for Americans for Peace Now, summed up, ''The two sides are still going to have to figure out how they will live with each other.''</p>
