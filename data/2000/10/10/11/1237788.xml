        <p>FOR most of human history, the closest vehicles got to rear-wheel drive was the wheelbarrow. Then, for about 50 years, the standard was set by the Model T: engine up front, drivetrain in the back. In the late 1970's, front-wheel drive gained adherents and threatened to dominate the market. But now, rear-wheel drive is coming back, especially in luxury cars.</p>
        <p>Why? Which is better?</p>
        <p>For that last question, experts say, the only answer is another question: What do you want?</p>
        <p>Paul Giltinan, a veteran Ford engineer who has designed steering and suspension systems for everything from rear-drive Mustangs to front-drive Windstar minivans and Nascar-racing Thunderbirds, said the differences reflected shifts in weight and force.</p>
        <p>The Model T's layout lasted long, he said, because it represented a generally efficient and simple balance. ''With rear drive and a typical weight distribution of 55 percent on the front wheels and 45 percent on the rear wheels, handling is very neutral,'' which means the car goes where it is pointed without ''pushing.'' ''Pushing'' describes the vehicle's tendency to steer straight instead of turning.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giltinan said front-drive vehicles, with about 65 percent of the weight over the front tires and only 35 percent on the rear tires, are inherently good designs because they pull the vehicle's center of gravity down the road from the front. They also provide excellent traction.</p>
        <p>Front-wheel-drive cars have dominated the American market since the early 80's. The top three sellers -- Toyota Camry, Honda Accord and Ford Taurus -- are all front-wheel-drive cars, as are the Chrysler, Ford, General Motors, Toyota and Honda minivans.</p>
        <p>They provide a roomier interior because there is no hump in the floor to accommodate the transmission and no driveshaft tunnel down the floor's center. Most front-wheel-drive cars have transverse or sideway 4-cylinder and V-6 engines with transaxles (a combination of a transmission and an axle assembly) mounted to them to save space. This means the front and rear seats are roomier and floors are flat.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, most of the traditional luxury cars, the large Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Lexus and Infiniti models, are rear-wheel drive; Cadillac, now offering only front-drive cars, is switching to rear drive soon.</p>
        <p>Experts cite two main reasons. First, the cars are roomy enough to accommodate a drive-shaft hump comfortably. And second, in the words of Frank Markus, the technical director of Car and Driver magazine, who has tested hundreds of cars at the limits of their handling abilities: ''Most of the time, a rear-drive car is more fun to drive.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Giltinan said that most high-performance cars, like the BMW 3 Series, the Chevrolet Corvette, Ford Mustang, Chevrolet Camaro and Pontiac Firebird, are rear-drive because they can steer through corners with the throttle pedal as well as the steering wheel, the driver adding or reducing throttle when necessary.</p>
        <p>Mr. Markus agreed. ''If the front tires are dedicated to doing nothing but turning,'' he said, ''they can apply more force to the job of turning. When they are also pulling the car along, some of the available force is dedicated to fore and aft, and there's less available for side-to-side work. That's the main physical thing that changes from front-wheel drive to rear-wheel drive.''</p>
        <p>Another change occurs with rear-wheel drive if a driver punches in enough power during a turn to overload the wheels' gripping capacity. The wheels will slide in the direction of the turn, rather than against it -- making a kind of controlled skid.</p>
        <p>Mr. Markus added that either kind of car's suspension can be adjusted to make it handle more like the other. And the new crop of rear-wheel-drive luxury cars and high-performance cars are equipped with traction control systems and electronic stability control systems that let them perform like front-drive cars on ice and snow and mud, and handle better than front-drive cars on dry roads.</p>
        <p>Mercedes-Benz designers strive to put half the car's total weight on the front tires and half on the rear tires, said Steve Potter, a spokesman. ''It's much easier to do with a rear-wheel-drive car,'' Mr. Potter said, ''because you have the entire rear axle assembly, and rear suspension back there offsetting the weight of the engine up front. One of the benefits you get from this arrangement, besides good handling, is a good, solid, quiet ride.''</p>
        <p>Still, there are some cars that detour the issue, like the Audi Quattro all-wheel-drive models or the Porsche 911.</p>
        <p>The Audi A4, A6 and A8 Quattro models drive all four tires all the time, with 50 percent of the drive going to both front and rear wheels, providing excellent traction under any condition. The Porsches are rear-engine, rear-wheel-drive cars with huge rear tires and lots of power, and, while they handle like purebred racing cars right up to the limit,  they can spin out very quickly when they go beyond the limit. That is why the 911 is now equipped with an electronic management system that can prevent such spinouts.</p>
        <p>But if ultimate performance is your goal, then it has to be rear-wheel drive.</p>
        <p>Mr. Potter of Mercedes-Benz, who is familiar with the company's Formula One and CART racing operations, pointed out that, in the end, all the really fast race cars are rear-engine cars with rear-wheel drive. They put the weight over the drive tires and separate the steering function from the drive function.</p>
        <p>''If you want to go fast and have excellent traction,'' he said, ''you want the steering tires doing the steering and the driving tires doing the driving. It's as simple as that.''</p>
