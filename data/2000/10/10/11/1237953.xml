        <p>Women who took birth control pills before 1975 and whose mothers or sisters had breast cancer have a substantially increased risk of developing the disease and should take special care to have regular mammograms and breast exams, researchers are reporting.</p>
        <p>The warning applies only to women with a family history of breast cancer. Fewer than 10 percent of the 180,000 cases of breast cancer in the United States each year are thought to be familial, or inherited. The warning does not apply to the general population, where studies have shown a slight increase in breast cancer risk from birth control pills, which disappears 10 years after use of the pills is stopped.</p>
        <p>It is not known whether the findings apply to women who took birth control pills after 1975, because earlier pills contained far higher  levels of estrogen, which is believed to spur the growth of some breast cancers. Newer pills contain lower doses of the hormone.</p>
        <p>The authors of the study say it is the first to look for a link between birth control pills and breast cancer risk in families with inherited breast cancer. The researchers followed more than 6,000 sisters, daughters, nieces, granddaughters and other female relatives of 426 women who were found to have breast cancer from 1944 to 1952. The relatives were interviewed from 1991 to 1996. The study, by doctors at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., and the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, is being published today in The Journal of the American Medical Association.</p>
        <p>The researchers found that in women who already had a higher than average risk of breast cancer because of family history, early versions of the pill made the risk even worse. Those who took the pill before 1975 and whose mothers or sisters had breast cancer had triple the risk of women with the same family history who did not take the pill. If five or more relatives, including a mother or sister, had breast or ovarian cancer, women who took the pill had 11 times the risk of those who did not.</p>
        <p>Earlier studies of pill use in women with family histories of breast cancer had conflicting results, with some showing an increased risk and others finding no effect.</p>
        <p>The new study does not suggest that all women with breast cancer in the family should necessarily avoid taking the pill. Many are also at high risk for ovarian cancer, and studies suggest that the pill can lower the risk of ovarian cancer by about 50 percent. That disease is more deadly than breast cancer.</p>
        <p>The study did not find an increase in breast cancer in women who took the pill after 1975. One of the authors, Dr. Lynn Hartmann, a medical oncologist at the Mayo Clinic, said it was possible that women who took the pills after 1975 were still too young for breast cancer to show up.</p>
        <p>''There is a potential relationship,'' Dr. Hartmann said.</p>
        <p>In counseling high-risk patients, Dr. Hartmann said she would ask them to consider birth control options other than the pill, unless they felt strongly that it was the best choice.</p>
        <p>Dr. Alexandra Heerdt, a breast surgeon at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan and director of special surveillance for high-risk women, said she had encouraged patients to take birth control pills to protect against ovarian cancer and that the new study had not changed her mind.</p>
        <p>''I will say there was one study suggesting that in women with a family history it may increase the risk, but that was with the earlier pills, and there is not enough data for me to tell you definitively that you should not be on birth control pills,'' Dr. Heerdt said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Wylie Burke, an associate professor of medicine at the University of Washington, said doctors and high-risk patients would need to have long discussions to weigh the pros and cons for each woman.  ''We have to go through what we know and trying to explain the uncertainties and allow people to make their own choices,'' Dr. Burke said.</p>
