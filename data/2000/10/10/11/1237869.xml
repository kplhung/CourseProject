        <p>The Supreme Court agreed today to decide whether the government can keep a deportable alien behind bars indefinitely for lack of a country willing to accept him.</p>
        <p>Urged by the Immigration and Naturalization Service to resolve a growing dispute over its detention policy, the justices agreed to review two cases that illustrate the scope of the problem in both its personal and legal dimensions.</p>
        <p>In one, the federal appeals court in San Francisco ordered a 22-year-old Cambodian man released after two years in the custody of the immigration service. The court ruled that detention so much longer than the 90-day ''removal'' period set by federal law was so unreasonable as to be unauthorized by the statute. The United States has no repatriation agreement with Cambodia, and the appeals court said the man, Kim Ho Ma, who had already served a two-year state sentence for a gang-related killing, now faced the prospect of being kept in immigration custody ''perhaps for the remainder of his life.''</p>
        <p>The second case presents directly the constitutional question that the first only alludes to: beyond the framework of immigration law, does indefinite detention beyond the 90-day period violate the constitutional guarantee of due process?</p>
        <p>Since first ordering Kestutis Zadvydas deported in 1994 for a narcotics offense, the immigration service has been unable to find a country willing to accept Mr. Zadvydas, whose birth in 1948 in a displaced-persons' camp in United States-occupied Germany evidently left him a citizen of nowhere. Germany does not consider him a citizen, and so will not accept him. His parents, who brought him to the United States in 1956 under a refugee resettlement program, were Lithuanian, but Lithuania told the immigration service it did not consider Mr. Zadvydas to be its responsibility. His wife is a citizen of the Dominican Republic, which also has refused to take him.</p>
        <p>Held in an immigration detention center in New Orleans for much of the last six years, Mr. Zadvydas was briefly released in 1997 after the Federal District Court in New Orleans granted his petition for a writ of habeas corpus on the ground that ''the probability of permanent confinement'' was ''an excessive means'' of accomplishing the law's otherwise valid purpose of protecting the community from aliens with  criminal records who are awaiting deportation.</p>
        <p>But the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, also in New Orleans, overturned that ruling in a 1999 decision that found his detention to be both authorized by law and permissible under the Constitution. The appeals court's decision noted that Congress had made immigration questions ''largely immune from judicial control'' and that once an alien was deemed ''excludable,'' the constitutional rights he had enjoyed as a legal resident were substantially constricted.</p>
        <p>The appeals court said that while Mr. Zadvydas ''may in a sense be stateless,'' he would not necessarily be confined forever because the immigration service would review his case periodically and would continue through diplomatic channels to find a country that would accept him.</p>
        <p>His appeal, Zadvydas v. Underdown, No. 99-7791, argues that as someone who entered the United States legally, he still has ''due process rights including a fundamental liberty interest in personal freedom under the Fifth Amendment.''</p>
        <p>In its appeal in the Ma case, Reno v. Ma, No. 00-38, the Clinton administration is arguing that the decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ordering the Cambodian's release ''cannot be reconciled'' with Supreme Court precedents requiring deference to the executive branch on immigration matters. As a result of the decision, the administration said, hundreds of similar cases have been filed within the nine states of the Ninth Circuit by deportable aliens facing extended detention.</p>
        <p>Under federal law, the immigration service is required to detain aliens whose convictions for ''aggravated felonies'' have rendered them deportable. In June, the immigration service announced new procedures for handling such cases when deportation cannot be carried out within 90 days. A ''post-order detention unit'' has been set up in Washington to centralize authority over such cases and to review continued custody on an annual basis.</p>
        <p>On an unusually busy day at the court, the justices added nine cases to their docket for the new term, filling their argument calendar through February. These are some of the others.</p>
        <p>School Bible Club</p>
        <p>The justices accepted a case on the perennial subject of religion in public schools. The case is an appeal by a Christian missionary organization that supports Good News Clubs across the country and seeks permission for the clubs to hold meetings in public elementary schools immediately after the close of the school day. The children who attend study biblical verses and learn religious songs.</p>
        <p>The Milford Central School District in upstate New York denied permission to a local minister and his wife to hold meetings at an elementary school, although the school was open to ''social and civic meetings'' by community groups that did not have a religious purpose. The Good News Club sued, on the ground that the rejection amounted to unconstitutional discrimination on the basis of religious viewpoint.</p>
        <p>The club lost both in Federal District Court in Binghamton and, by a 2-to-1 vote, in the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in Manhattan. The appeals court said the school district was not discriminating between viewpoints but rather had decided to exclude the program based on its content of ''religious instruction and prayer.'' This was a permissible ''viewpoint-neutral'' reason, the court said.</p>
        <p>The Supreme Court agreed to hear the case, Good News Club v. Milford Central School, No. 99-2036, because the federal appeals court in St. Louis had reached the opposite conclusion in a similar case brought by another Good News Club chapter. The case also poses an important question about the scope of a 1993 Supreme Court precedent that required a Long Island school district to open a school auditorium to the showing of films with a religious viewpoint on issues concerning family life. To reconcile the cases, the justices may have to explore the sometimes fine line that separates distinctions on the basis of content from those made on the basis of viewpoint.</p>
        <p>Property Rights</p>
        <p>The court accepted a property rights case that could lead it to revisit the question of when a land-use regulation becomes so burdensome that it amounts to a ''taking'' of private property that must be compensated by the taxpayers.</p>
        <p>In this case, a developer of waterfront property in Westerly, R.I., was barred from building 74 houses on an 18-acre salt marsh that had been designated a protected area by state agencies beginning in the 1960's. The Rhode Island Supreme Court rejected the argument by the developer, Anthony Palazzolo, that the refusal amounted to a taking.</p>
        <p>In his Supreme Court appeal, Palazzolo v. Rhode Island, No. 99-2047, the developer takes issue with various aspects of the state court's ruling. Most significantly, Mr. Palazzolo, who took title to the property in 1978, is arguing that the fact that the limits predated his acquisition should not categorically bar him from claiming that the restrictions on his desired use were a taking.</p>
        <p>Prior Custody</p>
        <p>The court agreed to resolve a longstanding dispute in the lower courts over whether a state prison inmate whose sentence has been increased due to a prior conviction can use a petition for a writ of habeas corpus to challenge the validity of the earlier conviction. The habeas corpus statute is limited to those who are ''in custody,'' and inmates in this situation are no longer in custody on the earlier conviction.</p>
        <p>This case, Lackawanna County v. Cross, No. 99-1884, is an appeal by a Pennsylvania district attorney from a ruling by the federal appeals court in Philadelphia. The appeals court granted a writ of habeas corpus to an inmate, in custody for a 1990 assault conviction, whose sentence had been increased by an earlier conviction that he said was tainted by his lawyer's faulty performance.</p>
