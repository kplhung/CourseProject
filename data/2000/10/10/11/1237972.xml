        <p>Two very smart managers presided over two mundane workouts at Busch Stadium on the eve of the National League Championship Series yesterday. One is a baseball genius. So is the other.

        <p>Two very smart managers presided over two mundane workouts at Busch Stadium on the eve of the National League Championship Series yesterday. One is a baseball genius. So is the other. One talks confidently like the lawyer he was. One speaks like the champion debater that he was. One manages the Mets and one manages the Cardinals and both do not like each other.</p>
        <p>Bobby Valentine, the Mets' savant and the former debater, and Tony La Russa, the Cardinals' sage and the former lawyer, played nice and complimented each other several times yesterday. La Russa talked in the morning and Valentine talked in the afternoon, so some skepticism followed their answers all day long.</p>
        <p>Flashback to an incident from 12 years ago, one that Valentine has never forgotten. Valentine does not forget much, especially an unnecessary scolding from one of his managerial colleagues and someone whom he respects. That memory still lingers.</p>
        <p>In 1988, Valentine was the manager of the Texas Rangers and La Russa was managing the Oakland Athletics. The awesome A's opposed the Los Angeles Dodgers in the World Series, and Valentine was openly rooting for Tommy Lasorda. He was clapping when Kirk Gibson began stealing the series with a homer in Game 1, and he was roaring when the Dodgers won the series in five games. Tommy and Bobby are so close that it would have been shocking if Valentine did not support him.</p>
        <p>La Russa confronted Valentine and told him that he should not be rooting for a National League team because he was an American League manager. He should want the A's to win. An incredulous Valentine recalled this incident before the 1999 season. At the time, he leaned forward in a booth at his sports cafe in Stamford, Conn., as he spoke, still exasperated more than a decade later.</p>
        <p>''I told him that I wasn't going to ignore 20 years of loyalty because I was supposed to show allegiance to the league,'' Valentine said then. ''I was going to cheer for who I wanted to cheer for.''</p>
        <p>Remember this story as the Mets play the Cardinals in Game 1 tonight. Every time Valentine and La Russa make choices, they will be doing what they feel will help their team win. That is their first concern and their only concern, but there will be a modest, yet satisfying, reward attached to outwitting the other genius.</p>
        <p>''I'm totally respectful of the job he's done and his ability,'' said La Russa, when asked about his relationship with Valentine. ''I think he's a very good manager. This series will not be decided because Bobby Valentine has done anything wrong.''</p>
        <p>Valentine, who managed his first game against La Russa when La Russa was managing the Chicago White Sox in 1985, proudly said they have had a ''combative relationship'' on the field and a ''cordial and not social'' relationship off the field. They have never had dinner together and never will.</p>
        <p>''He's a guy that when I talk about a guy who can manage, I always mention he's a guy who can manage,'' Valentine said. ''He has my utmost respect. I think I earned and gained his respect over the years.''</p>
        <p>The voice on the other end of the telephone was almost screaming. Lasorda was talking about the majesty of winning a gold medal with the Olympic baseball team and he kept on screeching as he discussed Valentine. Never seen a brighter baseball mind, he said. But when the topic shifted to La Russa's condemnation of Valentine, the booming voice flattened.</p>
        <p>''I remember that,'' Lasorda said. ''That's the way it goes. I have seven guys who played for me who are now managing. Believe me, it's tough when they play against each other. Bobby just outmanaged Dusty Baker and I love Dusty. But Bobby has been the most loyal of all of them. With us, it's like a father and son thing.''</p>
        <p>The spotlight will find Valentine and La Russa in the N.L.C.S. It found managers in the opening round. Baker failed by letting a pitcher bat with the bases loaded and two outs in Game 4 against the Mets; Art Howe fizzled when he allowed Gil Heredia to get hammered for six huge runs in the first inning of a decisive game with the Yankees. La Russa's team destroyed Atlanta so he looked shrewd, and Valentine excelled as the Mets advanced after he picked Bobby Jones to start Game 4. The players will obviously determine who wins this series, but the managers matter, too.</p>
        <p>''I just know that Bobby is one of those managers you can count on to have his players in the right spot at the right time,'' La Russa said. ''That's why the concern is their players. It's not their manager.''</p>
        <p>They are at the top of their professions, Valentine and La Russa. They are similar, these two baseball geniuses. With Valentine ordering his infielders to rush forward in some bunt situations and with La Russa often batting pitchers eighth in the order last season. With La Russa displaying little patience for inept questions and Valentine showing less. With Valentine believing he is smarter than the guy in the other dugout and La Russa believing the same. With both geniuses feeling their team will prevail.</p>
        <p>''I think there's a lot of similarities, actually, yeah,'' Valentine said. ''Of all the guys who manage, I think there's a lot of similarities.''</p>
        <p>Similar? Yes. But friendly? Absolutely not.</p>
