        <p>Two years ago the legendary Concord Hotel closed its doors in what local residents and summer visitors regarded as the last gasp for the once-thriving Catskill resorts.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, a developer began demolishing the old buildings on the property along Kiamesha Lake for what he said would be a $150 million resort and conference center that would hark back to the area's golden days.</p>
        <p>Louis R. Cappelli, who heads the group that owns the 1,600-acre property, said that he would build a four-star, 525-room hotel as well as a ballroom, meeting rooms and a spa.</p>
        <p>Amid snow flurries and fireworks at the groundbreaking for the project, Mr. Cappelli said he would also rebuild the Concord's Imperial Theater, which opened in 1958 with the singer Harry Belafonte. The Concord was the largest of the 400 hotels scattered across Sullivan County and the Catskills, 90 miles northwest of New York City.</p>
        <p>''We intend not only to keep this sense of history alive,'' Mr. Cappelli said, ''but to create a new, full-service luxury hotel.''</p>
        <p>The Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, who owns a summer house in Sullivan County, said that he hoped the project would be the ''launching pad for an economic renaissance'' in the Catskills.</p>
        <p>The county's beleaguered economy received a boost in August when Alan Gerry, a cable television tycoon and local resident, unveiled plans to build a $40 million performing arts and music center on the site of the original Woodstock music festival in nearby Bethel, N.Y.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cappelli and Reckson Strategic Venture Partners bought the property in bankruptcy court in January 1999 for $10.25 million, a seemingly paltry sum for so much land.</p>
        <p>But the Catskill resorts had fallen on hard times, beginning in the late 1960's when relatively cheap air fares to Europe lured away many patrons. Over time, many of the hotels and bungalow colonies fell into disrepair.</p>
