        <p>IN 1956, a Newsweek cover depicted a car of the 21st century. It had a fighter plane's plastic bubble-roofed cockpit with a little spire antenna, three tail fins and wheels that were tucked well out of sight, perhaps because the designers were embarrassed that it did not fly. Half a century ago, cars dreamed of being airplanes.</p>
        <p>But progress is not what it used to be. While we still expect automobiles to improve, their appearance need not dramatize their prowess. As long as they work well and are safe to drive, cars are free to be vehicles of pure emotion. Thus, the phenomenon of the ''halo'' car -- the PT Cruiser, the New Beetle, the reinvented Thunderbird -- which creates new audiences for designs that are decades old.</p>
        <p>Newsweek's car of the future was based on the Nash Metropolitan, a cute, chubby two-seat Anglo-American economy car that, as it turned out, barely made it to 1960, let alone 2000. The hard-bodied futurism predicted for the car seemed at odds with the cuddly, eccentric Toontown character of that vehicle. In the unlikely event that designers decided to reinvent the Metropolitan as a halo car, it would be one in which Betty Boop would feel more at home than George Jetson.</p>
        <p>Best, though, to leave it alone. The Metropolitan was perfect, in its perfectly ridiculous way. All the designs of the automotive past -- old favorites, youthful enthusiasms, false starts, dead ends and failed masterpieces -- are up for grabs in this age of automotive design. Here are five candidates I have chosen for reinterpretation.</p>
        <p>1954 CADILLAC ELDORADO -- If ever a car marque needed a halo, it is the Cadillac, which has been trying to rediscover its identity for decades. The mid-50's models, with their tail fins and what Harley Earl, the General Motors styling chief, termed ''graceful bulk,'' epitomized American excess. Now that American excess is very much back in style, it may be time to revisit your grandfather's Cadillac.</p>
        <p>Compared with, say, a Lincoln Navigator sport utility vehicle, these outrageously luxurious cars of nearly half a century ago seem almost sensible. Sensible, though, is beside the point. These cars represent a high point in vulgarity, the triumph of nouveaux riches. Today, one would drive the car with a touch of irony about its nouveau riche appearance, while secretly reveling in its triumphant vulgarity.</p>
        <p>1936-37 CORD -- This is a luxury car that is the opposite of the mid-50's Caddy, a consensus classic of elegant, subtle design. The Museum of Modern Art featured it in a 1951 exhibition, 14 years after it went off the market,  terming it ''a most solemn expression of streamlining.'' This pioneering front-wheel-drive car was designed by Gordon Miller Buehrig to be a smaller, more affordable version of the legendary Duesenberg, which he also  designed. The company was going broke. Most of the cars produced had mechanical problems. But the Cord remains an iconic car.</p>
        <p>The front fenders were monumental, separated from the engine compartment so that you could see the horizontal louvers of the grille reach down the sides, all the way to the front door. This exaggerated the apparent length of the car, which was almost imperceptibly tipped upward toward the rear to give it a look of power barely under control.</p>
        <p>1932-34 FORD V-8 B-400 CONVERTIBLE -- With the popularity of the PT Cruiser, which looks as if it ought to be carrying Edward G. Robinson and a bunch of thugs with machine guns, how about a real getaway car? These are the ''dandy cars'' that Clyde Barrow, of Bonnie and Clyde fame, always stole ''when I could get away with one,'' during his Dust Bowl-era bank-robbing spree, as he noted in a fan letter to Henry Ford himself. ''For sustained speed and freedom from trouble, the Ford has got every other car skinned,'' he wrote. Barrow was ultimately gunned down in one.</p>
        <p>As a design, the Ford is admirably direct, a no-frills machine that delivered horsepower at a good price.</p>
        <p>1950 STUDEBAKER CHAMPION STARLITE COUPE -- Because of its distinctive wraparound rear windshield, jokers used to say that this car didn't know whether it was coming or going. But its distinctive bullet nose really left no doubt. This was another aspiring airplane.</p>
        <p>Like most other post-World War II Studebakers, this was designed under the supervision of Raymond Loewy, whose exploration of unornamented, fast-looking but unstreamlined forms reached something close to perfection in the classic, though commercially unsuccessful, Loewy coupe of 1953. The 1950 model, by contrast, was odd yet quite popular. Perhaps its strangeness could give a designer some clues about how to add excitement to the mainstream family car.</p>
        <p>BUCKMINSTER FULLER DYMAXION TRANSPORT -- What the world needs now is a three-wheel lightweight car that holds 11 passengers, goes 120 miles an hour, gets 30 miles a gallon, can do a U-turn in less than its length, and looks as if it came from the Planet Mongo.</p>
        <p>Actually, the Dymaxion looked more like an Airstream trailer with nothing pulling it, or like an airplane without wings, which was essentially what it was. Fuller, the visionary-tinkerer best remembered for the geodesic dome, produced several prototype cars over a decade, beginning in 1933. I am particularly taken with a later five-passenger model whose wheels could all turn when you wanted to park in a space exactly the size of the car. (Each wheel had its own small motor, too, though you didn't have to run them all.)</p>
        <p>These were strange cars, and obviously required getting used to. The conductor Leopold Stokowski, who was one of the few people to actually own a Dymaxion, apparently found driving it terrifying and kept it only a few months. The day may come when we have to worry once again about the air we pollute and the oil we deplete when we drive. Fuller's characteristically American response to the challenge was not self-denial but invention. He liked to drive, and nobody thought ''outside of the box'' quite the way Bucky did.</p>
