        <p>Dr. Laura Schlessinger, the conservative radio and television talk show host who has provoked the ire of gay groups for calling homosexuality deviant and derivative of ''biological error,'' will issue a public apology today to those she might have offended.</p>
        <p>In a letter that was to run on the back cover of today's edition of Variety, the Hollywood trade paper, Dr. Schlessinger said, ''In talking about gays and lesbians, some of my words were poorly chosen.''</p>
        <p>''I deeply regret the hurt this situation has caused the gay and lesbian community,'' she continues.</p>
        <p>Dr. Schlessinger, who is an Orthodox Jew, said in the letter that she was seeking forgiveness in keeping with the tradition of Yom Kippur, the Jewish Day of Atonement, which was observed on Monday.</p>
        <p>The apology comes at a specifically trying time for Dr. Schlessinger, when the appeasement of gay groups could do her some good.</p>
        <p>Under heavy pressure from protesters, dozens of advertisers have suspended their support of her radio and television programs.</p>
        <p>Kraig T. Kitchin, president and chief operating officer of Premiere Radio Networks, which syndicates her highly rated radio program, said nearly 25 percent of its sponsors had ceased advertising, at least temporarily, in the past few months.</p>
        <p>Paramount Television Group, which syndicates Dr. Schlessinger's new television program, would not comment on advertiser support of the program.</p>
        <p>The program has failed to draw a significant audience, despite a recent break in production during which Dr. Schlessinger and Paramount executives sought ways to make it more appealing.</p>
        <p>Because of the trouble, the ''Dr. Laura Show'' was recently dropped from the programming schedules of the four Canadian TV stations that were showing it in Ontario, Montreal, British Columbia and Alberta.</p>
        <p>No station in the United States has dropped the program.</p>
        <p>Dr. Schlessinger's television show had provoked the ire of gay groups from its inception.</p>
        <p>Gay advocacy groups began pressuring her sponsors with telephone and letter campaigns in April, after it became apparent that they would not be able to persuade Paramount to drop its plans for the show.</p>
        <p>In May, one of the first advertisers that signed on with the TV program, Procter &amp; Gamble, dropped its sponsorship, leading various radio advertisers to pull their sponsorship of her radio program.</p>
        <p>In Dr. Schlessinger's letter, which was to run in today's special ''Gay Hollywood'' issue of Variety, she said that as an Orthodox Jew she remained a ''staunch defender of the traditional family.'' But, she said, some of her words about gays were ''poorly chosen'' and ''many people perceive them as hate speech.''</p>
        <p>''This fact has been personally and professionally devastating to me as well as to many others,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Representatives with the two gay groups that have been leading the campaign against Dr. Schlessinger, StopDrLaura.com and the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, said they did not foresee relenting in their pressure on her advertisers.</p>
        <p>''For us, it has been about stopping her defamation, and there is nothing in her statement that says she intends to do that,'' said Joan M. Garry, executive director of the alliance.</p>
        <p>Ms. Garry and John Aravosis, a founder of StopDrLaura.com, said they did not put too much stock in the apology because Dr. Schlessinger had made similar comments in March, when she released a statement saying she regretted that some words she had used might have ''hurt some people.'' But later, she told The Boston Herald that was not meant as an apology, only as a clarification.</p>
        <p>Of their critique, a spokeswoman for Dr. Schlessinger said that ''they're going to say what they're going to say'' and that the letter should speak for itself.</p>
