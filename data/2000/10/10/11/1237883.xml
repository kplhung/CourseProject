        <p>As practice wore down into the fourth hour, the Nets had to run extra sprints today, making the players even more eager for Wednesday's first preseason game.</p>
        <p>''One of the goals in camp was to make everything else seem easy,'' center Jim McIlvaine said. ''Now you look forward to knocking around other people instead of your own guys.''</p>
        <p>The knocking has had repercussions. Forward Keith Van Horn will most likely miss Wednesday night's game against the Miami Heat in Continental Arena with a strained left knee. Van Horn bumped his knee in Friday night's practice, and after playing over the weekend he left this morning's practice after an hour for a magnetic resonance imaging because his knee was bothering him.</p>
        <p>The examination showed nothing wrong, and he is listed as doubtful for the game, his condition to be evaluated daily.</p>
        <p>While Coach Byron Scott was concerned about Van Horn, he and his players spoke soberly today of an unexpected illness that has stricken Alonzo Mourning.</p>
        <p>Mourning, one of the game's more stalwart competitors, has a rare kidney disorder and has not practiced with the Heat since training camp began last week. He visited practice for the first time in Miami today and rode a stationary bike but did not travel to New Jersey. He is consulting doctors in Miami about possible treatments, and Heat officials said they did not know the seriousness of his illness.</p>
        <p>The Heat has released little information about Mourning's condition or prognosis; officials describe it as a ''kidney ailment.''</p>
        <p>Patrick Ewing, the former Knick, who is a friend and fellow former Georgetown player, said Mourning would play this season. But The Palm Beach Post reported that Mourning's foster mother, Fannie Threet, had said doctors had not ruled out a transplant.</p>
        <p>''He just said: 'Oh, it is bad, Mom. It is bad,' '' she was quoted as saying.</p>
        <p>The uncertainty has shaken the Nets veterans and put their arduous running and preseason scrimmages into perspective.</p>
        <p>''Somebody who works that hard, you never would think he would have a problem because he is so fit and so strong,'' said Kendall Gill, 32, who played with Mourning on the Charlotte Hornets in the 1992-93 season. ''You can't take anything for granted. You feel like you're going to live forever. We're not immune to anything.''</p>
        <p>Mourning is 30 years old. Nets forward Johnny Newman turns 37 next month.</p>
        <p>''We have to understand we're human,'' Newman said. ''We go hard with our bodies. You take care of yourself and then something still can happen. I know in any way possible, he's going to want to play again, this year. That's just the type of guy he is.''</p>
        <p>Miami's future had looked electrifying because of the aggressive off-season acquisitions by Pat Riley, the team's coach and president. Riley brought in power forward Brian Grant, guard Eddie Jones and forward Anthony Mason to surround Mourning and point guard Tim Hardaway. Duane Causwell, a 7-foot reserve, will take Mourning's place for now, with the 6-9 Grant and the 6-7 Mason helping.</p>
        <p>Gill said: ''I think it changes the whole scope of everything. Alonzo is the biggest part of what they do, because he can score. He is intimidating inside. I'm not exactly afraid of Duane Causwell.''</p>
        <p>Scott, nonetheless, is ready for a tough night, as he prepares to face his former coach on the opposite sideline. ''It's not a rivalry,'' Scott said. ''For me, it's a great challenge to go against my mentor.''</p>
