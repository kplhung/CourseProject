        <p>With the work on the human genome essentially complete, the National Institutes of Health and others said today that they would spend $58 million to decode the genome of the mouse by February.</p>
        <p>While this may seem a large sum to drop on a mouse, experts regard the mouse genome as an invaluable guide for interpreting the human genome sequence that is now in hand.</p>
        <p>The initiative represents a continuation of the tussle between the public consortium that decoded the human genome and its competitor, the Celera Corporation.</p>
        <p>The consortium's members say the genome and the tools to interpret it are of such importance that they should be freely available to all researchers. Celera supplies all this data for a fee.</p>
        <p>For the mouse genome, two sponsors of the public human genome project -- the National Institutes of Health and the Wellcome Trust, a large research charity in London -- are teaming up with three corporations, the pharmaceutical companies of SmithKline Beecham and Merck, and Affymetrix, a maker of chips that analyze DNA.</p>
        <p>The decoding work will be done by the three leading members of the public consortium that cracked the human genome, the centers at Washington University in St. Louis, the Whitehead Institute in Cambridge, Mass., and the Sanger Center near Cambridge, England.</p>
        <p>The new alliance is called the Mouse Sequencing Consortium. It is the third such venture after the consortium that worked on the human genome and the SNP Consortium, a group that is cataloging genetic variations in human DNA that may help pinpoint the gene variants that contribute to many diseases.</p>
        <p>Dr. Francis S. Collins, director of the genome institute at the National Institutes of Health, said yesterday that the initiative for the Mouse Sequencing Consortium came from SmithKline Beecham.</p>
        <p>The extra money has enabled the DNA sequencing centers supported by his institute to accelerate their work on the mouse genome even as they worked to complete the human genome, Dr. Collins said. Although President Clinton announced in June that a draft of the human genome had been complete, much work on it remains to be done.</p>
        <p>Dr. J. Craig Venter, the president of Celera, said his company had already sequenced the genomes of three different strains of mice, two of them to 90 percent completion. It would have been more valuable for the National Institutes of Health to have sequenced the genome of a different species, ''instead of duplicating efforts again and wasting public money, so I am disappointed,'' Dr. Venter said, referring to the parallel efforts to decode the human genome.</p>
        <p>He also expressed concern that the mouse work would divert Dr. Collins's team from completing its version of the human genome. ''The worry we always had was they would not finish it,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Celera's version of the genome was more complete than than the public consortium's was in June, but still contained many small gaps.</p>
        <p>Dr. Collins said that completing the human genome was his highest priority. The new consortium will sequence the genome of a strain of mouse known as Black 6, which is different from the three strains analyzed by Celera.</p>
        <p>It is clear that the mouse genome is likely to emerge as a vital guide for interpreting the human genome. Dr. Venter said it had become ''our main annotation tool for the human genome,'' and that 67 percent of human exons, subunits of genes, had matched those in a two-thirds complete mouse genome.</p>
        <p>The importance of having the mouse genome publicly available was a driving factor in SmithKline Beecham's proposal to set up the consortium, said Rick Koenig, a spokesman.</p>
        <p>Mr. Koenig said that Dr. Tadataka Yamada, the company's research director, felt that ''we as well as others will benefit if these sequence data are widely disseminated, because there will be more discoveries this way and drug companies and others will benefit.''</p>
        <p>He quoted the research director as saying, ''We all stand on one another's shoulders.''</p>
