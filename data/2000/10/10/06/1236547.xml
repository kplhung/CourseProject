        <p>The crack of J. T. Snow's bat in the ninth inning tonight was as chilling and eerie to the Mets as the fog that had rolled into Pacific Bell Park and enveloped them.

        <p>Snow delivered a three-run pinch-hit homer that barely cleared the 29-foot-high right-field wall.

        <p>The crack of J. T. Snow's bat in the ninth inning tonight was as chilling and eerie to the Mets as the fog that had rolled into Pacific Bell Park and enveloped them. Trailing by 4-1 and sensing their home-field advantage slipping away, the Giants rallied to force Game 2 of the National League division series into extra innings.</p>
        <p>Snow delivered a three-run pinch-hit homer that barely cleared the 29-foot-high right-field wall. The ball bounced off a fan's hands and back onto the field where it came to rest at the feet of Timo Perez. Snow, who had been pulled from first base as Manager Dusty Baker cleared his lineup of left-handed hitters against Al Leiter, joined Barry Bonds and Jeff Kent in a gleeful dance around the bases.</p>
        <p>Losing at Pacific Bell Park, where they had dominated the Mets for five consecutive victories? The thought never entered the minds of the Giants, who had compiled the best record in baseball this season, but could not manufacture enough offense or drama to deny the Mets a split in the first two games of their three-of-five-game series.</p>
        <p>Baker's pregame move of replacing Snow at first base and saving him for pinch-hitting duty appeared ready to pay off, but reliever Felix Rodriguez allowed Jay Payton's single that drove in Darryl Hamilton with the winning run in the 10th to give the Mets a stirring 5-4 victory and all the momentum heading to Shea Stadium for Games 3 and 4 this weekend.</p>
        <p>''It's tough, when you battle back like that, but the bottom line is we lost the game,'' said Snow, who connected with a fastball at the knees from Armando Benitez. ''We just need to pick ourselves up and try to win two in New York. Now, we've got to try and come back.</p>
        <p>''But it doesn't really mean anything right now,'' Snow said. ''I'd trade all that emotion for a win.''</p>
        <p>Leiter's beguiling performance and an early 2-0 Mets lead were not the only adversity the Giants faced. Before the Mets had a chance to really hurt him, Giants starter Shawn Estes injured himself with an awkward lunge into second base on Bill Mueller's infield hit in the third inning. Racing to beat the throw from shortstop Mike Bordick, Estes chose not to slide and jammed his left ankle into the bag. He was called safe, but hobbled away and was tagged out.</p>
        <p>With his rotation suddenly in flux, Baker turned to Kirk Rueter, who quickly established that he would be tougher to hit than Estes. Rueter kept the Mets off balance and off the scoreboard, allowing three hits while striking out two and walking one in four and a third innings.</p>
        <p>Still, none of the Giants pitchers received any support from their offense until Snow's home run.</p>
        <p>''We're frustrated right now, but we'll turn the page, fly to New York and not worry about it,'' said Kent, who was 2 for 4 with two runs scored. ''The key is to just let go all the emotion from this one and keep on an even keel.''</p>
