        <p>The decision by the EMI Group and Time Warner to withdraw a plan to merge their music businesses may open the door to a new partner for EMI.</p>
        <p>While Time Warner and EMI said today that they would continue to explore ways to combine their huge music units, any new deal would have to be approved by EMI shareholders. That creates an opportunity for several companies interested in acquiring music content, people close to the companies said yesterday.</p>

        <p>The decision by the EMI Group and Time Warner to withdraw a plan to merge their music businesses may open the door to a new partner for EMI.</p>
        <p>While Time Warner and EMI said today that they would continue to explore ways to combine their huge music units, any new deal would have to be approved by EMI shareholders. That creates an opportunity for several companies interested in acquiring music content, people close to the companies said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Pacific Century CyberWorks of Hong Kong, which had taken a strong interest in EMI before Time Warner proposed merging the company with its Warner Music Group, is back for another look, two people close to the company said. And BMG Entertainment, a unit of Bertelsmann, the closely held German media giant, is understood to be watching the situation with renewed interest.</p>
        <p>EMI, the world's third-largest music company, has a current market value of more than $6 billion.</p>
        <p>Executives from EMI of London, Pacific Century CyberWorks and BMG did not return calls seeking comment.</p>
        <p>Most of these would-be partners, however, come with their own baggage. As a telecommunications operator, Pacific Century would presumably be unable to wring as much in cost savings and efficiency from such a deal as would a company in the music or entertainment business.</p>
        <p>Moreover, Pacific Century lacks the cash to complete a merger of this size on its own, people close to the company said.</p>
        <p>That may apply with Bertelsmann, too. ''Everyone and their brother tried to structure a deal for Bertelsmann and it wasn't happening,'' a person close to the company said. ''They lack the equity currency and would have to raise a lot of cash.''</p>
        <p>Some of that cash will come as Bertelsmann gives up its 50 percent stake in America Online Europe. But the company would still face antitrust issues similar to those that EMI and Time Warner confronted.</p>
        <p>In the end, EMI, home to such labels as Virgin, Capitol and EMI Classics, could well remain independent as antitrust uncertainties and questions related to piracy and downloadable music cloud the industry's future.</p>
        <p>The News Corporation, for instance, has in the past looked at EMI and Universal Music, part of Seagram, which is merging with Vivendi, but would now be reluctant to enter the music business given these mounting concerns, an executive said.</p>
