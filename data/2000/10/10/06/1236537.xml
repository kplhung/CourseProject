        <p>Leading off and playing right field for the Mets tonight was Timo Perez, the 23-year-old September call-up whose energetic play and background have drawn comparisons to last year's October hero, Melvin Mora.</p>
        <p>Those comparisons grew after Perez's performance in Game 2. Perez got three hits in the Mets' 5-4 victory in 10 innings over the Giants. He drove in the team's first two runs with a bases-loaded single in the second. After hitting a two-out, ninth-inning single, he scored on Edgardo Alfonzo's two-run homer.</p>

        <p>Leading off and playing right field for the Mets tonight was Timo Perez, the 23-year-old September call-up whose energetic play and background have drawn comparisons to last year's October hero, Melvin Mora.</p>
        <p>Those comparisons grew after Perez's performance in Game 2. Perez got three hits in the Mets' 5-4 victory in 10 innings over the Giants. He drove in the team's first two runs with a bases-loaded single in the second. After hitting a two-out, ninth-inning single, he scored on Edgardo Alfonzo's two-run homer.</p>
        <p>The series could be something of an audition for Perez. Derek Bell will be a free agent after this season, and after hitting .187 in the second half with only 16 runs batted in, the Mets might not bring him back. For the Mets, Perez is a less-expensive outfield option. He signed in spring training for about $85,000. He was largely unknown then, but Omar Minaya, the Mets' assistant general manager, compared him to the veteran outfielder Luis Polonia -- and Minaya had seen enough of him to know.</p>
        <p>Minaya, who is responsible for the Mets' international operations, first noticed Perez when the outfielder was 17 years old and playing at home in the Dominican Summer League. He followed his career as Perez played for the Hiroshima Carp in Japan and in the Caribbean World Series last winter.</p>
        <p>When Perez asked for his release from the Carp and eventually got it, Minaya signed him. Perez had talent, and his experience in Japan instilled the fundamentals that have made him more polished than most players his age.</p>
        <p>''I have a lot of respect for the developmental process in Japan,'' Minaya said.</p>
        <p>Valentine, who managed in Japan, suggested that Perez responds well to the postseason because he is already so experienced.</p>
        <p>''I don't discount that pressure that he's already been through,'' said Valentine, who is giving Perez the chance to prove himself under pressure again.</p>
