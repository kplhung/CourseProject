        <p>A selective listing of new or noteworthy cabaret shows in Manhattan this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended show.</p>
        <p>CHRISTINE ANDREAS, Cafe Carlyle, at the Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, (212) 744-1600. With her high sweet soprano and eager intensity, Ms. Andreas embodies an eternal ingenue who is just waking up to the realization that life doesn't have a fairy-tale ending. Although the smart Brazilian-flavored arrangements for a pop-jazz quartet led by Lee Musiker don't always match her floating Broadway lyricism, Ms. Andreas leaves her romantic imprint on songs like ''He Loves Me,'' ''How Insensitive,'' ''And So It Goes'' and Dave Frishberg's wonderful, little-known ballad ''Listen Here.'' Through Oct. 14. Tuesday through Saturday nights at 8:45 and 10:45. Cover: $60 at tables, no minimum; dinner available but not required, 6 p.m. to midnight (Stephen Holden).</p>

        <p>A selective listing of new or noteworthy cabaret shows in Manhattan this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended show.</p>
        <p>CHRISTINE ANDREAS, Cafe Carlyle, at the Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, (212) 744-1600. With her high sweet soprano and eager intensity, Ms. Andreas embodies an eternal ingenue who is just waking up to the realization that life doesn't have a fairy-tale ending.

Through Oct. 14. Tuesday through Saturday nights at 8:45 and 10:45. Cover: $60 at tables, no minimum; dinner available but not required, 6 p.m. to midnight (Stephen Holden).</p>
        <p>''BERLIN TO BROADWAY WITH KURT WEILL,'' Triad, 158 West 72nd Street, (212) 239-6200. If this is not a flawless revue, it is nevertheless an ingratiating tribute to Kurt Weill's achievement. Fridays at 10:30 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 4:30 and 7:30 p.m.; Mondays and Tuesdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays at 3 p.m.; no performance Thursdays. Tickets: $45 (Lawrence Van Gelder).</p>
        <p>* DEE DEE BRIDGEWATER, Feinstein's, at the Regency, 540 Park Avenue, at 61st Street, (212) 339-4095. This jazz singer, who is a much bigger star in Paris than she is here, is one of the most vital inheritors of the tradition of Ella Fitzgerald and Sarah Vaughan (especially Vaughan in a playful mode). Her impish sense of humor also incorporates echoes of Chaka Khan's exuberant pop-soul shout. Ms. Bridgewater is no introvert. With her excellent jazz trio, she rifles through a hot jazz set that runs from Louis Armstrong to Horace Silver to Cole Porter. Her signature is a visceral scat style that finds levels within levels of exuberant fun. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:30 and 11. Cover: $75 for the early show tonight and both shows tomorrow; $50 for the late show tonight. Food and beverage minimum: $50 for early shows; $25 for late shows. Beginning Tuesday, Polly Bergen (Holden).</p>
        <p>* HOWARD FISHMAN QUARTET, Sardi's, 234 West 44th Street, (212) 221-8440. Powerful echoes of Stephane Grappelli and Bix Beiderbecke are among the influences rippling through the Howard Fishman Quartet's seamless swing. The group -- Mr. Fishman on guitar, banjo and vocals; Russell Farhang playing virtuosic Grappelli-style violin; Erik Jekabson on trumpet; and Jonathan Flaugher on bass -- folds elements of vintage jazz, swing and early bluegrass into rhythmically animated, richly allusive jazz chamber music. Whether the music is Stephen Foster (a bubbly ''Old Folks at Home''), Gershwin (''Soon'') or Romberg (''When I Grow Too Old to Dream''), it is all translated into lilting, fine-tuned ensemble music that transcends time and idiom. Friday nights at 10:30. No cover charge, but $15 minimum at tables (Holden). Howard Fishman Quartet also performs Sunday nights at 8:30 (through Oct. 22) at Joe's Pub, Joseph Papp Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 539-8778 or (212) 239-6200. Tickets: $12.</p>
        <p>KAREN MASON, Arci's Place, 450 Park Avenue South, at 30th Street, (212) 532-4370. The high-strung, likable performer from Chicago still exudes the effervescent eagerness of a hometown drama student who has just arrived in New York bursting with starry-eyed ambition. Her new cabaret show concentrates on popular standards. High points include zany 60's cabaret numbers like Cy Coleman and Carolyn Leigh's ''When in Rome'' and Stephen Sondheim's and Mary Rodgers's bossa nova spoof ''The Boy From . . .'' But her big ballads are undermined by a tendency to overbelt. Friday and Saturday nights at 8:30 and 11; Sunday nights at 8; Wednesday and Thursday nights at 9. Through Oct. 15. Cover: $30; $15 minimum. Also at Arci's Place, jazz brunch Sundays at noon, with Bill Wurtzel and Howard Morgen. Cover: $19.95, prix fixe or $15 minimum at the table; Monday at 8 p.m., David Raleigh, singer. Cover: $25; $15 minimum. (Holden).</p>
        <p>* MAUREEN McGOVERN, Oak Room, Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, (212) 840-6800. Ms. McGovern's gorgeous voice and the melodies of Richard Rodgers were meant for each other. This singer's demureness and sense of proportion prevent Rodgers and Hammerstein ballads like ''Climb Ev'ry Mountain'' and ''You'll Never Walk Alone'' from turning to mush. She brings a fine mixture of wit and precision to Rodgers and Hart standards like ''To Keep My Love Alive.'' Not only is the singer the closest American equivalent to Julie Andrews in her vocal prime, but she also adds a jazzy, coloratura panache. Through Oct. 14. Fridays and Saturdays at 9 and 11:30 p.m.; Tuesdays through Thursdays at 9 p.m. Cover: $50, with dinner required for early shows on Fridays and Saturdays; $15 minimum for other shows; suggested dinner arrival for early show is 7. Also at the Algonquin, Sunday jazz brunch at 2 p.m. (seating begins at 12:30), Judy Barnett, singer. Cover: $50, includes brunch. International Festival of Cabaret: At 9 p.m: Sunday, Natalie Gamsu, singer; Monday, Michel Hermon, singer; $40 cover and $15 minimum; Sundays and Mondays through October (Holden).</p>
        <p>* ''OUR SINATRA,'' Reprise Room at Dillon's, 245 West 54th Street, (212) 239-6200. The rising young cabaret star Eric Comstock is the mastermind behind this utterly winning tribute to Ol' Blue Eyes. He focuses on what he calls the hidden gems and orphan songs that Sinatra made popular. Joined by Christopher Gines, whose creamy baritone echoes Dick Haymes and Steve Lawrence in their prime, and Hilary Kole, a perky swinger, Mr. Comstock conducts a witty and knowledgeable survey of the Sinatra canon. Mr. Comstock concentrates on the mature Sinatra and Mr. Gines on the dreamy 1940's balladeer, with Ms. Kole bridging the gap. The memorable show proves that there are still young singers good enough to keep the tradition alive. Tonight and Monday through Wednesday nights at 8; tomorrow at 2:30 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7:30 p.m. Tickets: $50 and $55; ringside seating, $75 and $80 (Holden).</p>
        <p>BEMELMANS BAR, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, (212) 744-1600. Michael Devine, Tuesdays through Saturdays at 5 p.m., through Dec. 30. Peter Mintun, pianist, beginning at 9:30 p.m., Tuesdays through Saturdays, through Oct. 14. Cover: $15 at table and $5 at the bar; no minimum.</p>
        <p>CAFE PIERRE, Fifth Avenue at 61st Street, (212) 940-8195. Friday and Saturday nights from 8:30 to 12:30; Tuesday through Thursday nights from 8:30 to 11:30, Kathleen Landis, singer and pianist, in ''Fascinating Rhythms: 50 Years of American Popular Song and Jazz, 1900-1950.'' Sunday and Monday nights from 8:30 to 11:30, Nancy Winston. No cover; $20 minimum.</p>
        <p>CARNEGIE CLUB, 156 West 56th Street, (212) 957-9676. ''Weekends With Sinatra,'' with Cary Hoffman and the 11-piece Carnegie Club Orchestra, music made famous by Frank Sinatra in the 1950's, featuring the original arrangements by Nelson Riddle. Friday and Saturday nights at 9:30 and 11. Cover, $20; two-drink ($15) minimum.</p>
