        <p>In Robert Altman's ''Player,'' a filmmaker played by Richard E. Grant is repeatedly seen pitching a death-row drama called ''Habeas Corpus,'' which he promises will be raw and real, with ''no stars'' and no happy ending. ''Because that's the reality,'' he insists. ''Innocent people die.'' When ''Habeas Corpus'' finally sees the light of day, its ending features Bruce Willis breaking into the gas chamber to save a fainting Julia Roberts, whom he carries to safety through the fumes as the audience cheers.</p>
        <p>Nothing quite so phony happens in Joel Schumacher's ''Tigerland,'' a boot-camp drama that is ostentatiously raw and real and without the stars who have decorated Mr. Schumacher's other pictures. The look of the film -- shot in grainy, bleached-out 16-millimeter with enough jumpy hand-held camera work to win the Dogma 95 seal of approval -- promises toughness and grit. But looks deceive: beneath the rough verite exterior beats the same slick, corny heart that has pumped blood (and money) through Mr. Schumacher's ''Batman'' and John Grisham pictures, his revanchist provocation ''Falling Down,'' and, most unforgettably, ''St. Elmo's Fire.''</p>

        <p>In Robert Altman's ''Player,'' a filmmaker played by Richard E. Grant is repeatedly seen pitching a death-row drama called ''Habeas Corpus,'' which he promises will be raw and real, with ''no stars'' and no happy ending. ''Because that's the reality,'' he insists. ''Innocent people die.'' When ''Habeas Corpus'' finally sees the light of day, its ending features Bruce Willis breaking into the gas chamber to save a fainting Julia Roberts, whom he carries to safety through the fumes as the audience cheers.</p>
        <p>Nothing quite so phony happens in Joel Schumacher's ''Tigerland,'' a boot-camp drama that is ostentatiously raw and real and without the stars who have decorated Mr. Schumacher's other pictures. The look of the film -- shot in grainy, bleached-out 16-millimeter with enough jumpy hand-held camera work to win the Dogma 95 seal of approval -- promises toughness and grit. But looks deceive: beneath the rough verite exterior beats the same slick, corny heart that has pumped blood (and money) through Mr. Schumacher's ''Batman'' and John Grisham pictures, his revanchist provocation ''Falling Down,'' and, most unforgettably, ''St. Elmo's Fire.''</p>
        <p>Which is too bad, because ''Tigerland,'' like a few of those earlier pictures, has some good things going for it. Mr. Schumacher has assembled a hard-working young cast led by the Irish actor Colin Farrell, who manages to sound credibly Texan and to capture his character's tricky mix of goodheartedness and bad attitude.</p>
        <p>Mr. Farrell plays Raymond Bozz, a rebellious private chafing under the brutal discipline of a Louisiana Army base in 1971. He and his comrades are on their way to Tigerland, a special training center that the officers refer to as ''the stateside province of Vietnam.'' From there they will be shipped to the real war.</p>
        <p>Bozz is the one man who sees through the hypocrisy of the system, and he uses his knowledge of its bureaucratic procedures to help some especially vulnerable and unhappy soldiers find ways to escape. ''I heard that if you want out, you have to either pray to Jesus or talk to Raymond Bozz,'' says one scared young fellow.</p>
        <p>The officers hate him, but the draftees and enlisted men, with a few stiff-necked exceptions, come to depend on his irreverent humor and his hipster honesty. He goes AWOL at will and reads Dalton Trumbo's antiwar classic ''Johnny Got His Gun'' (or pretends to) on the back of the transport truck.</p>
        <p>Thirty years ago Bozz's anti-establishment posturing might have seemed fresh and dangerous. His character is basically Randle Patrick McMurphy from ''One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,'' a movie much admired in the mid-70's that  now seems dated and naive. In contrast, ''Tigerland'' just feels disingenuous. All the profanity and sadism of military training can't disguise its secondhand sentimentality. Every time it starts to find a jagged, naturalistic rhythm it pauses for a big stagy scene of speechmaking and choked-up emotion.</p>
        <p>Early in the movie, for instance, Bozz and Paxton (Matthew Davis) -- an opponent of the war who enlisted for the experience, like Charlie Sheen's character in ''Platoon'' -- pick up a couple of women in a topless bar and take them to a sleazy hotel for some sweaty, neon-lit sex. As soon as they're done, the G.I.'s start to philosophize and Paxton confesses his desire to write a great war novel, like James Jones or Hemingway. The women slip out in search of something to eat, which is not a bad idea.</p>
        <p>In fact, if you make frequent, carefully timed trips to the bathroom and the concession stand you may be able to enjoy the modest, visually gripping war movie ''Tigerland'' stubbornly prevents itself from becoming. The script, by Ross Klavan and Michael McGruther, has moments of idiomatic brilliance (none of them quotable here), but it also includes some cringe-worthy moments, like a homesick, semiliterate G.I.'s speech about how the same  moon that shines on him peeling potatoes in the mess hall also shines on his purty little wife back home, and on Vietnam too.</p>
        <p>The film is also full of liberal cop-outs on the matter of race. In the Deep South in 1971, in a unit full of Southerners, there seems to be exactly one white racist, who also happens to be a coward and a murderous sociopath. As in ''The Hurricane'' and ''The Green Mile,'' bigotry is presented as an individual pathology rather than a social disorder. The black characters are all consigned to the background until they're called upon to lend Bozz hipster credibility or sing a cappella harmony.</p>
        <p>The last third of the movie, which follows the company into Tigerland itself, is jarring in good ways and bad. The camerawork is especially effective, communicating palpable uncertainty and dread. But the narrative resolution seems forced, as Bozz is pushed unconvincingly toward sainthood and, as he heads off to war from which he has saved so many of his friends, toward implicit martyrdom. All he needs is a pair of wings.</p>
        <p>''Tigerland'' is rated R. It includes nonstop profanity, an explicit sex scene and a number of brutal fistfights.</p>
