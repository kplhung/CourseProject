        <p>''Distant Voices IV: Images of the Other America,'' at the Puffin Room in SoHo, is a show that wears its heart on its sleeve. The subjects of these photographs are the Macuxi Indians in the Serra do Sol, a remote grassland of the Amazon basin in northern Brazil, and the Mayans in Guatemala and in the state of Chiapas in southern Mexico.</p>
        <p>Two of the three groupings of pictures were taken by American photographers, Vince Heptig and Robyn Kapp. Mr. Heptig's accompanying book, ''A Mayan Struggle: Portrait of a Guatemalan People in Danger,'' and Ms. Kapp's wall text with her photographs of the Macuxi Indians make the plea that the ordinary people shown in their photographs be allowed to lead a life free of tyranny and violence.</p>

        <p>''Distant Voices IV: Images of the Other America,'' at the Puffin Room in SoHo, is a show that wears its heart on its sleeve. The subjects of these photographs are the Macuxi Indians in the Serra do Sol, a remote grassland of the Amazon basin in northern Brazil, and the Mayans in Guatemala and in the state of Chiapas in southern Mexico.</p>
        <p>Two of the three groupings of pictures were taken by American photographers, Vince Heptig and Robyn Kapp. Mr. Heptig's accompanying book, ''A Mayan Struggle: Portrait of a Guatemalan People in Danger,'' and Ms. Kapp's wall text with her photographs of the Macuxi Indians make the plea that the ordinary people shown in their photographs be allowed to lead a life free of tyranny and violence.</p>
        <p>The third grouping consists of photographs taken by Mayan women in Chiapas, who are part of the Chiapas Photography Project started in 1992 by Sister Carlota Duarte, a Mexican-American Catholic nun, artist and director of the Indigenous Photography Archive. The no-frills but unexpectedly sophisticated pictures by these amateur photographers eloquently say that even under straitened circumstances life is precious.</p>
        <p>At first encounter, though, the Chiapas pictures are eclipsed by the more practiced work of the American photographers. Some of Ms. Kapp's black-and-white images of the Macuxi Indians recall Gertrude Blom's darkly elegiac photographs of the indigenous people in the Lacandon jungle in Chiapas. But while Ms. Kapp's wall text makes her sympathies clear, she does not indulge in ideologically slanted photography. She shows Macuxi Indians going about their daily routine: women carrying buckets on their heads, boys kicking around a ball in a sandy yard, a man playing an accordion, a boy standing in tall grass.</p>
        <p>Beyond taking in the area's obvious poverty, the images give little hint of the inhabitants' tragic history since Sir Walter Raleigh arrived four centuries ago looking for the mythical city of gold, El Dorado. Today the Macuxi Indians number about 15,000, and many other Brazilians view the Serra do Sol as a place to raise cattle and prospect for gold, strongly resisting the Indians' claim to a 6,500-square-mile reserve, about the size of Connecticut.</p>
        <p>Most of Guatemala's population of 10 million are Mayan, and they have had to endure a 36-year civil war that ended in 1996.  Mr. Heptig shows the two sides in that conflict -- the Guatemalan Army and the rebels -- and the Mayans caught in the middle.</p>
        <p>A photojournalist from Utah who has lived and worked in Guatemala for six years, Mr. Heptig brings to his pictures a superb and compassionate eye. In a striking image of five Guatemalan generals saluting the flag, the men's faces are cast in shadow against a white sky, the triangles of their saluting arms echoed in three triangular overhangs looming above their heads. But it is in his photograph of two children of Guatemalan soldiers, in full military attire and standing in front of an old cannon, that Mr. Heptig subtly alludes to the recent history of a country where life and war went together.</p>
        <p>This poignancy extends to pictures of the rebels. They may be shown playing a guitar in between skirmishes or posing heroically with their assault rifles, but the viewer knows that music and heroism are also casualties in a brutally intractable civil war. How brutal is suggested by Mr. Heptig's straightforward images of death.</p>
        <p>A mother cries out in grief as her young son lies dead on the ground, his wounds covered by a large green leaf. The bright colors in an over-the-shoulder baby carrier known in Mexico as a rebozo and the bright eyes of the child it holds almost divert attention from the sorrow of the woman carrying the child; the caption explains that she was forced to leave her home because of death threats from a paramilitary group. Other reminders of a terrible time include a Mayan with a plastic colander that holds a human skull exhumed at a site where the ''disappeared'' were buried.</p>
        <p>As powerful as these images are, they are not as memorable as the guilelessly affectionate pictures taken by the Mayan women of Chiapas, who in the name of community exhibit anonymously. The Puffin Room shows a small selection of their work, with more images included in ''Camaristas,'' a book available at the gallery.</p>
        <p>Along one gallery wall are pictures of women making clay pots, firing griddles, embroidering vests, carding wool, carrying flowers to market, preparing bean tamales, filling jugs of water, weaving a skirt. The image of a Mrs. Soyla, preparing a meal at a table, with sunlight hitting the surfaces of two big jugs and two small bowls, and turning her apron into a pool of liquid light, is a lovely rustic Vermeer. A color triptych of a bunch of corn, a woman making tamales and a pair of hands grinding corn on stone evokes the modernist work of Tina Modotti.</p>
        <p>Just as Walker Evans saw beauty in simple tools, so the Mayan women of Chiapas see beauty in the commonplace. A wonderfully spare black-and-white triptych, each photograph accompanied by a whimsical explanatory caption, shows a ball of yarn, a pig and bejao leaves cut to make tamales. ''If the pigs dance,'' goes one caption, ''it will rain that day.''</p>
        <p>Although the photographer is not identified on the wall, an out-of-print book ''Creencias'' (the Mayan word for ''belief'') reveals that the work is by Maruch Santiz Gomez. She is a natural whose work, like that of her fellow photographers, shows the infinite human capacity for wonder.</p>
        <p>''Distant Voices IV: Images of the Other America'' is at the Puffin Room, 435 Broome Street, near Broadway, SoHo, (212) 343-2881, through Oct. 15.</p>
        <p>PHOTOGRAPHY REVIEW  Correction:  October 28, 2000, Saturday  A photography review in Weekend on Oct. 6 about ''Distant Voices IV: Images of the Other America,'' an exhibition that was at the Puffin Room in SoHo through Oct. 15, misstated the language of a photo book title, ''Creencias'' (''Beliefs''). It is Spanish, not Mayan.</p>
