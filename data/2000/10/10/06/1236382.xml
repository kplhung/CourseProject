        <p>After weeks of watching the Olympics, it's easy to forget that one of the most endearing (and enduring) heroes of American popular culture is a perennial loser. Impossible? Then you're overlooking Charlie Brown.</p>
        <p>The Children's Museum of Manhattan has not overlooked him, making Charlie Brown and his creator, Charles M. Schulz, the stars of ''Good Grief!'' The exhibition, opening tomorrow, invites families to inhabit a life-size version of the ''Peanuts'' comic strip, which always offered lessons as well as laughs.</p>
        <p>''Even though Charlie has won only one baseball game in his life, there's always hope,'' said Andrew S. Ackerman, the museum's executive director. The exhibition was developed to foster children's own optimism, he added, and to teach them to cope with difficulties that seemed to crop up in ''Peanuts'' as often as in life: frustration and conflict.</p>
        <p>Right away, for instance, children find themselves and the ''Peanuts'' gang on a baseball diamond, where they try to throw balls into holes in a wall. They can also play a video game in which they take on Charlie Brown's nemesis, the kite-eating trees. And if all this becomes stressful, they can unload at -- where else? -- Lucy's booth, the only place where psychotherapy costs a nickel.</p>
        <p>The smallest ''Peanuts'' fans can crawl through the Great Pumpkin Patch, inhabit Snoopy's doghouse and even sit at the controls of his dashing Sopwith Camel.</p>
        <p>Several areas highlight cooperation. For instance, all the parts of Beethoven's ''Rage Over a Lost Penny'' can be heard if three children work together in a musical section dominated by Schroeder's piano.</p>
        <p>In other displays computers allow visitors to choose among several proposed endings for comic strips and to select resolutions to problems presented in videos featuring New York City schoolchildren.</p>
        <p>''The kids offer different perspectives; it's not all 'Peanuts,' '' Mr. Ackerman said.</p>
        <p>Will there ever be another talent like Schulz's? Beginning this weekend, the museum will offer cartooning workshops in which members of the next generation can also try to make others laugh -- and think.</p>
        <p>''Good Grief!,'' sponsored by Target, at the Children's Museum of Manhattan, the Tisch Building, 212 West 83rd Street, (212) 721-1234. Hours: Wednesday through Sunday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission: $6; the elderly, $3; under 1, free.</p>
        <p>From Geology to Goop</p>
        <p>It's sometimes hard to persuade children that learning can be an earthshaking experience. But it will  be tomorrow when the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University has its annual open house.</p>
        <p>One of the highlights of the free event at this research institution in Palisades, N.Y., will be a ''make-your-own-earthquake demonstration,'' said Arthur Lerner-Lam, the observatory's associate director. Families will make tremors with jackhammer-type devices.</p>
        <p>Outdoor tents and indoor displays will illustrate subjects from the ecology of the Hudson River to the prehistoric life of New York and New Jersey, which were ''really rich with medium-size and smaller dinosaurs,'' Mr. Lerner-Lam said. The event will also celebrate the Tree Ring Lab's 25th anniversary ''with exhibits on the stories embedded in tree rings,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''Critter tents,'' Mr. Lerner-Lam added, will feature live snakes and birds. Children can also play with something much like primordial ooze: 500 pounds of a cornstarch-based mixture. ''As far as we know,'' Mr. Lerner-Lam said, ''it's the world's largest collection of goop.''</p>
        <p>Open House, tomorrow from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, Route 9W, Palisades, N.Y., (845) 359-2900. Parking available at the I.B.M. Executive Conference Center, 1.4 miles north of Lamont on Route 9W; a shuttle bus will take visitors to the observatory.</p>
        <p>Class Acts</p>
        <p>Young students are notorious for neglecting to take things to school: homework, lunches, texts. But Schmoozy leaves behind something far more critical: her imagination.</p>
        <p>Her quest to get it back is the subject of ''Schmoozy Togetherness,'' a musical from Manhattan Theater Source. Schmoozy, who woke up to find her imagination gone, is in trouble: she must write a story for class.</p>
        <p>At recess she wanders into the Meta-forest, where she meets Phineas, a former bully who has been sent into the woods until he can learn to make a friend. He tells Schmoozy he is looking for ''the double-edged sword,'' and they hunt for it in places like Popsickalia, where the folks are always freezing; Univer-City, full of snobs; and Intellectualifornia, where even the furniture sounds erudite.</p>
        <p>Although theatergoers younger than 10 may not understand the puns in Sam Forman's book and lyrics, they will enjoy seeing grown-ups act silly. Directed by Peter Russo, the young actors play every role with brio, from paste-eating grade-schoolers to a table and a chair that are desolate because they can't find a rhyming way to express their love.</p>
        <p>Eli Bolin's rollicking score helps propel the action, which finally sends Schmoozy (Kristen Schaal) and Phineas (Robin Taylor) back to class, their quests fulfilled. And just in case your own children lose their imaginations, the theater will help with a seven-week story-making workshop, to begin on Oct. 22.</p>
        <p>''Schmoozy Togetherness,'' Sundays at 1 p.m. through Oct. 22 at Manhattan Theater Source, 177 Macdougal Street, Greenwich Village. Tickets: $7. Reservations: (212) 501-4751. Workshop: (212) 260-4698.</p>
