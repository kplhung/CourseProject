        <p>Madison Square Garden pres Dave Checketts says he will not hesitate to make changes if New York Knicks fail to mesh and produce victories after Patrick Ewing was traded to Seattle SuperSonics (M)</p>

        <p>The president of Madison Square Garden, Dave Checketts, pulled up a chair today and watched the unorthodox team he had assembled go through practice. He saw three evenly matched point guards vying for one starting spot; three high-scoring swingmen shooting for the limited minutes at two other positions; and a collection of injury-plagued centers with no legitimate starter among them.</p>
        <p>While the Knicks players looked at the team's makeup and considered the possibility of another trade, Checketts admitted that the imbalance and the potential for disharmony over playing time were a bit disturbing. That being the case, Checketts said he would not hesitate to make changes if his talented but unconventional group failed to mesh and produce victories.</p>

        <p>The president of Madison Square Garden, Dave Checketts, pulled up a chair today and watched the unorthodox team he had assembled go through practice. He saw three evenly matched point guards vying for one starting spot; three high-scoring swingmen shooting for the limited minutes at two other positions; and a collection of injury-plagued centers with no legitimate starter among them.</p>
        <p>While the Knicks players looked at the team's makeup and considered the possibility of another trade, Checketts admitted that the imbalance and the potential for disharmony over playing time were a bit disturbing. That being the case, Checketts said he would not hesitate to make changes if his talented but unconventional group failed to mesh and produce victories.</p>
        <p>''It makes all of us uncomfortable,'' Checketts said of the Knicks' lopsided roster. ''But I'm comfortable with the discomfort because I think we all have to work harder to figure it out and I don't mind the organization being on edge a little bit about that because we're committed to winning. Our team is going to have to learn to play with the parts that we have or we'll have to make adjustments, and I don't mind being on edge about that, not at all.''</p>
        <p>Six practices in three days have done nothing but help complicate the picture. The situation at center is even worse than it was the day after Patrick Ewing was traded to Seattle two weeks ago. Luc Longley, obtained in the multi-club Ewing deal, is out for three to six weeks with a bruised right knee he sustained at the Summer Olympics. Kurt Thomas, a 6-foot-9-inch power forward, does not want to play center, and Marcus Camby is still hampered by soreness in his right knee.</p>
        <p>The problem is different on the perimeter, where the Knicks seem to have too many bodies and too few minutes to avoid eventual controversy and discontent. Not only must Glen Rice, a three-time All-Star, accept coming off the bench behind Latrell Sprewell and Allan Houston, but the rookie Erick Strickland has shown that he deserves a good portion of the playing time that is reserved for Charlie Ward and Chris Childs at point guard.</p>
        <p>Sprewell, surprised at how strong Strickland has looked, said Coach Jeff Van Gundy could have difficulty keeping his players happy and said a trade might be the only way to keep the peace.</p>
        <p>''Minutes could be a problem,'' Sprewell said. ''As a coach, that's a headache you have to deal with. I think it's highly likely that we might make a trade. Strickland's really good, and I can't see him just being on this team. He's such a competitor that he's going to want to play.''</p>
        <p>The abundance of trade talks during the off-season has already left some Knicks unsettled, said Larry Johnson, who added that all the speculation may be adversely affecting the performance of some players.</p>
        <p>''All these trade rumors about Marcus, Spree, myself, Allan has got us not as excited as we should be,'' said Johnson, whom the Knicks reportedly offered to the Washington Wizards. ''But as time goes along and we realize that we will be here and everything is settled down, guys will get to be where they want to be.''</p>
        <p>Checketts did nothing yesterday to dispel the notion that the Knicks were looking to make another trade. When reminded that there appeared to be few workable deals the Knicks could make, he said that would not stop them from searching.</p>
        <p>''That doesn't mean that you don't make every effort, scouting, looking to the future, using your available picks and resources,'' Checketts said.</p>
        <p>Camby was the Knick offered the most during trade talks this summer, and he is having trouble freeing his mind of the idea that he is unwanted. Still, Checketts, who visited Houston in Australia during the Olympics to tell him that the Knicks were committed to him, said Camby would receive no such vote of confidence.</p>
        <p>''That's not my job,'' Checketts said. ''The best thing for Marcus would be to average 15 points and 12 rebounds and then he doesn't have to worry about those things.''</p>
        <p>REBOUNDS</p>
        <p>After negotiating a buyout with his agent, the Knicks waived the veteran guard VERNON MAXWELL on Thursday.</p>
