        <p>GALLOUSIS-Lou. The Faculty and Staff of Mt. Sinai School of Medicine and The Mt. Sinai Hospital of Mt. Sinai NYU Health are profoundly saddened by the sudden passing of Lou Gallousis, Founder and President of the Louis Green, Evelyn Green Davis Childcare Center which serves the children of Mt. Sinai employees. ''Papa Lou'' as he was fondly called, joined the Mt. Sinai family as President of Innovative Learning Centers, Inc.-a childcare project in 1984. Opening in 1989 with less than 20 children, the Center now provides quality care for a capacity of 90 children. Thru his 20 year career in hospital personnel services, Lou recognized the increasing need for childcare. His company proudly provides a nurturing environment at 10 early childhood centers in the tri-state area. A caring, generous man who led by example, Lou will be sorely missed. We extend our sympathy to his wife, Virginia, and his children Christopher and Dina. Helene L. Kaplan, Chair, Mt. Sinai School of Medicine Arthur H. Rubenstein, MBBCh, Dean Mt. Sinai School of Medicine Barry R. Freedman, President, The Mt. Sinai Hospital and Acting President, Mt. Sinai NYU Health</p>
