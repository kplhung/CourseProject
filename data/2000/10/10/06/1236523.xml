        <p>In an encounter characterized by polite, almost amiable disagreements, Senator Joseph Lieberman and former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney defended the men at the top of their tickets, while carefully avoiding the personal attacks of the presidential debate earlier this week. In substance, the candidates echoed the disagreements of Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush, but with a muted tone that seemed aimed at reassuring the public about their respective commitments to civility. Mr. Lieberman sounded almost sorrowful in criticizing the Republican tax cut proposal, while Mr. Cheney hammered calmly at the vice president's alleged love of big government. Although almost refreshingly low key, the debate seemed unlikely to have an immediate impact on the polls.</p>
        <p>In fact, vice-presidential debates rarely have much of an effect on presidential contests, except in cases of memorable gaffes. As a vice-presidential candidate in 1976, Bob Dole embarrassed President Gerald Ford by referring to ''Democrat wars.'' In 1988, Dan Quayle's hunted look as Lloyd Bentsen ridiculed his attempt to compare himself to John F. Kennedy ended his effectiveness as a campaigner.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney's goal last night was to do no harm to Mr. Bush's candidacy and to reinforce, in somber tones, the Republican attack on Mr. Gore's approach to government. In recent weeks the former defense secretary has seized on the vice president's habit of stretching the record, but last night he dwelled mainly on Mr. Gore's links to the ''old ways of governing'' in Washington. On abortion rights, he seemed to go out of his way to say that although he and Mr. Bush were pro-life, they would work on incremental steps to reduce abortions. Mr. Lieberman countered that the Republican ticket simply did not believe in a woman's right to choose whether to have an abortion, and that he and Mr. Gore did.</p>
        <p>One of the sharpest exchanges of the evening involved military readiness and defense spending. Mr. Cheney accused the Clinton administration of producing a military that is ''overcommitted but under-resourced.'' Mr. Lieberman fired back that such charges undermined morale for the purposes of partisan advantage, adding that Mr. Gore's budget allotted more money for new weapons than Mr. Bush's did.</p>
        <p>Despite such fencing, the most striking aspects of the debate were its friendly atmosphere and yet its delineation of two sharply divergent philosophies of government. The candidates referred to each other as ''Joe'' and ''Dick,'' a reminder that they are both seasoned professionals and veterans of many political wars in Washington. One of their few vivacious exchanges was both barbed and friendly, when Mr. Cheney charged that the Clinton administration had been one of ''talk and no action.'' With a mischievous smile, Mr. Lieberman commented dryly that Mr. Gore and President Clinton had made promises and delivered on them ''big time, if I may put it that way'' -- a jab at Mr. Cheney's overheard comment after a verbal indiscretion by Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>The philosophical contrast that ran as a theme throughout the discussion was over the role of government and the apportioning of the federal surplus. ''We like tax reform and tax cuts,'' Mr. Cheney said at one point, after Mr. Lieberman had outlined the Democrats' preference for limited tax credits and spending on education, health and environmental protection. They ended with fervent endorsements of the abilities of the two men at the top of the ticket whose more combative performances on Tuesday are still being digested by the voters.</p>
        <p>Despite the traditional ''hatchet man'' role of vice-presidential candidates, these two sounded more like moot-court lawyers arguing their briefs. For this reason, it was a debate in which anyone keeping a scorecard would have a hard time finding a winner or a loser. It was almost a textbook example of reasoned exchange, rather than a contest of killer lines, competing egos and replayable stumbles. At the end of the evening, both the contestants and the commentators seemed impressed by the civics lesson that had been broadcast on national television. But the election is certain to be decided less on what the running mates say than on how the voters view Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush as leaders and whether, by Nov. 7, the electorate sees the Republicans' sweeping tax cut proposal as sound policy or a giveaway for the wealthy.</p>
