        <hl1>Bush vs. Gore: Debate Aftermath; 'Fuzzy Math'</hl1>

      <abstract>
        <p>Prof William Thurston letter says that as mathematician he was puzzled by George W Bush's remark that opponent Al Gore uses 'fuzzy math'; finds expression dismaying in man who claims to lead educational reform</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As a mathematician, I was interested when, in the debate, George W. Bush described Al Gore's economic figures as ''fuzzy math'' (front page, Oct. 4). But I was chagrined when Mr. Bush left it at that. Although he repeated the phrase several times, he never discussed specific problems with Mr. Gore's reasoning or his figures, nor did he offer any alternatives. I gradually came to understand that by ''fuzzy math'' Mr. Bush meant, ''Math is confusing and fuzzy, so ignore it.''</p>

        <p>This is dismaying to see in a man who says he will be a leader of educational reform. We can at least be thankful that if elected, Mr. Bush intends to assemble panels of experts that will presumably know how to work out numbers when economic crises arise.</p>
