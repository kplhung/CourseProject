        <p>A snarl at a Barnes &amp; Noble distribution center set off a wave of anxiety in the book business this week. The company says the problem has been resolved, but some publishers are not so sure.</p>
        <p>Barnes &amp; Noble, the nation's biggest book chain, accounts for about 20 percent of the country's book sales. Even a small problem in its distribution network seriously rattles publishers, authors and agents.</p>
        <p>In September, logistical problems at a Barnes &amp; Noble distribution center in Jamesburg, N.J., delayed many publishers' books by as much as three or four weeks. Such unexpected delays annoy publishers, who work hard to coordinate reviews, tours, talk show appearances and advertising campaigns around their most promising titles. If too few copies of the books are in stores at the right time, publishers worry that consumers' urge to buy may pass.</p>
        <p>This week, word swept through the industry that the problem had delayed shipment of some copies of at least two heavily promoted titles: ''The Devil's Code'' by John Sandford and ''Perish Twice'' by Robert B. Parker, both published by Putnam. Mounting anxiety among publisher and agents spilled over into angry calls to reporters -- usually speaking on the condition of anonymity for fear of alienating their biggest customer.</p>
        <p>But Mary Ellen Keating, a spokeswoman for Barnes &amp; Noble, said the publishers had the facts wrong. She said all the copies of those titles were delivered to stores on their designated publication date and had not run out. A spot check of a Barnes &amp; Noble store in Manhattan showed plenty of both titles in stock.</p>
        <p>''We find it ironic that publishers would call the media to complain,'' Ms. Keating said. ''We have acknowledged some distribution problems this year, but we met every strict on-sale date.'' Strict on-sale dates are used for blockbusters -- usually with print runs of more than 100,000 copies -- to manage their marketing like the premiere of a movie.</p>
        <p>Alan Kahn, Barnes &amp; Noble's chief operating officer, said the publishers were suffering from ''mass hysteria.'' He said that the problems occurred last month but that all books were now moving in and out of the warehouse smoothly.</p>
        <p>Still, several publishers said they had seen recent delays, and some are taking steps to remedy them. Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux pushed the official publication date of all of its fall titles back by two to three weeks to adjust for the delays and moved its publicity and advertising back as well.</p>
        <p>''There are significant problems,'' said Jane Friedman, chief executive of HarperCollins Publishers. ''We are working together with Barnes &amp; Noble to take action and get the books in stores, and we feel that this will be resolved.''</p>
        <p>Some said the reaction reflected a tense time because of congestion at printers nationwide. Small publishers in particular have had difficulty reprinting fast-selling books.</p>
        <p>''It just gets everybody a little nervy,'' said Charles Winton, chief executive of Publishers Group West, a marketing and distribution company. '' 'Shoot, I have this demand, I can't get any new books made, now Barnes &amp; Noble's distribution center doesn't work,' and it seems like the sky is falling.''</p>
