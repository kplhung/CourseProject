        <p>To stuff and exhibit a dead human, one taxidermist advised in a practical guide published in the 1830's, ''it is necessary to make a circular incision around the fingertips and peel back the skin as if it were a glove.''</p>
        <p>The Verreaux brothers stuffed their specimen with vegetable fibers. They inserted glass eyes. And some 50 years later, in 1888, the anonymous African, who was stolen from his grave here in southern Africa, was mounted in a Spanish museum in a display that was triumphantly described as ''unique in the world.''</p>
        <p>For decades he was known simply as El Negro, dressed in feathers and skins and ogled by generations of white children at the Darder Museum of Natural History in Banyoles, Spain.</p>
        <p>But to Africans he was a symbol of racism lingering from the turn of the century, when blacks were paraded as freaks in the vaudeville shows and natural history museums of Europe and America.</p>
        <p>And that is why a celebration here today was so sweet for so many. After eight years of diplomatic wrangling and international protests, the unknown African was finally buried here in a state funeral attended by cabinet ministers, diplomats and other dignitaries.</p>
        <p>His belated return to the continent was front-page news. And on Wednesday, as the blazing afternoon faded into moonlit night, hundreds of  people waited for hours to view the remains and to try, somehow, to right the wrongs of history by paying respect to a stolen ancestor and a wandering soul.</p>
        <p>Construction workers stood in line with drills in their hands. Mothers carried groceries and babies. There were businessmen in suits, students in baseball caps and old women leaning on canes. Some sang the national anthem and waved flowers. But when it came time to see him, most people walked solemnly in single file and peered quietly through a tiny glass window in the polished coffin.</p>
        <p>There lay his remains, though all that could be seen through the glass was a skull with empty eye sockets and broken teeth.</p>
        <p>But Didimalang Keakopa Bukha, a nurse, did not flinch. Instead, she struggled to recognize the lines of his cheekbones and the breadth of his brow. ''He has got a small forehead like me,'' said Mrs. Bukha, 44, her voice breaking. ''This part of southern Africa where they say he is from, I have kin there. And when I saw him, I saw a person. Not a skull -- a human being.</p>
        <p>''I felt like crying because of the belief that he might be related to me. And it makes you wonder, how many people have been stolen like this?''</p>
        <p>No one knows exactly how many skeletons and other human remains still lie in the cupboards and warehouses of the world's museums, but anthropologists say there are thousands. And the debate over how to handle this inheritance is roiling the academic world.</p>
        <p>South Africa, for instance, is still hoping for the return of the remains of Saartjie Baartman, known as the Venus Hottentot, who was paraded through Europe when she was alive and whose preserved skeleton and genitals remain in France. And Tickey Pule, the director of the Botswana National Museum, says she hopes the return of El Negro will focus attention on the importance of returning art and artifacts to Africa and other parts of the world.</p>
        <p>''For me, he's an African and a human being, first and foremost, who deserves a decent burial,'' Ms. Pule said. ''But I also think it's a steppingstone toward the repatriation of remains back to Africa. This is our past. These remains and artifacts are part of Africa. Our history is incomplete when it is there.''</p>
        <p>This was definitely not the view of the people of Banyoles. The museum staff and city council there refused repeated pleas for the return of the body, an idea that was first broached in 1992 by a Haitian-born medical doctor outraged by the display.</p>
        <p>In June, the town finally agreed after being pressed by the Spanish government and the Organization of African Unity. But a sense of bitterness remains, particularly because town officials and members of the museum staff resent being described as racist.</p>
        <p>''It was exhibited with respect,'' Georgina Gratacos, the curator of the Darder Museum, said in an interview from Banyoles. ''There wasn't any racism. This is a part of history and this interest that Europeans had largely remains unknown. It was a time when to see exotic things you had to bring them to Europe, whether they were animals or human beings.''</p>
        <p>The Verreaux brothers, French naturalists, are believed to have stolen the body from a grave near the confluence of the Orange and Vaal Rivers in what is now northern South Africa. Neil Parsons, a professor of history at the University of Botswana, believes the man was Tswana because the earliest documents describing him refer to him as a Betchuana.</p>
        <p>Medical examinations suggest that El Negro was 27 when he died of some sort of a lung infection around 1830. A brochure from the 1888 exhibition describes him as a chief, and says the Verreaux brothers attended his funeral and returned that night to steal his body.</p>
        <p>This is deeply disturbing to many Africans, who believe the dead join a spirit world of ancestors who continue to support their relatives in the land of the living. In Botswana, the names of those who have recently died are still read regularly on national radio.</p>
        <p>One caller to a radio talk show expressed concern that the dead man's spirit, angry at his treatment, might bring the country bad luck. ''Will he not chase away rains and good harvests?'' the caller asked. Another caller dismissed those worries as ridiculous, saying, ''We don't even know if he is one of us.''</p>
        <p>But at the ceremony today, the speakers dismissed questions about the man's origins, choosing instead to welcome him home as a son of Africa. Soldiers in white gloves carried the coffin and serenaded it with their bugles. And the crowd sang mournful hymns, their voices rising and falling in the morning still.</p>
        <p>In a speech, the foreign minister, Lt. Gen. Mompati Merafhe, summed up a continent's sentiments: ''Today, 170 years later, we are gathered here not only to re-enter the body in African soil where it likely belongs, but also to cleanse that act of desecration, restore the dignity of a common ancestor, to appease the spirits of Africa and, above all, to correct a wrong which has no statute of limitations.''</p>
