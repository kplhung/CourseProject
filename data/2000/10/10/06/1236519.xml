        <p>SBC Communications agreed to buy more than $1 billion in equipment, software and services from Lucent Technologies in a five-year deal that makes Lucent SBC's main supplier. SBC will use Lucent equipment as it moves into 30 new markets, including Atlanta, Baltimore, Boston, Philadelphia and Seattle. SBC is the nation's second-largest local telephone company and has been aggressively adding long-distance and high-speed Internet connections to increase its customer base. Besides the SBC contract, Lucent said yesterday that it had signed a $180 million contract with Eletronet, a Brazilian company, to provide optical networking systems in several states in Brazil.</p>
