        <p>Fights over the huge federal spending bills often reflect deep ideological divisions or sharp partisan differences. In the case of James R. Lyons, they seem to reflect personal pique.</p>
        <p>Tucked away in the fine print of the roughly $79 billion agriculture spending bill is a provision that removes the ability of Mr. Lyons, the under secretary of agriculture for natural resources and the environment, to do his job. Under the provision, he would be stripped of authority to supervise the Forest Service and the Natural Resources Conservation Service, two of the largest parts of the Agriculture Department.</p>
        <p>Instead, employees in those two agencies would report directly to the secretary of agriculture.</p>
        <p>Put another way, the day before the amendment would go into effect, the under secretary would be supervising more than 50,000 people. The following day he would be the boss of nine, just those who are part of his inner circle. And, in a clear sign that the restrictions are aimed squarely at Mr. Lyons, the limitations would last only until Jan. 20, 2001, the date he said he will leave office to take a teaching job at Yale.</p>
        <p>''It's kind of a slap in the face,'' Mr. Lyons said in an interview, ''or maybe just a kick in the pants as I head out the door.''</p>
        <p>Veteran Congress watchers cannot readily remember a case when lawmakers have stripped an official of the executive branch of his or her responsibilities, leaving the official with little more to do than show up at work late, take long lunches and leave early. There have been times when such action has been threatened against some officials -- including Mr. Lyons -- who have angered members of Congress. But generally a truce has been called, and the official, suffused with a clear-eyed knowledge that it is best now to tred lightly with Congress, goes back to work.</p>
        <p>This time, there does not seem to be any backing down. ''The majority party in the conference, especially on the House side, seems adamant in their determination to punish Mr. Lyons for some perceived offense he apparently gave to someone,'' said Representative Maurice D. Hinchey, a New York Democrat who sought to have the provision removed.</p>
        <p>What is striking is that the move against Mr. Lyons was initially led  not by the Republicans who control the committee, but by a conservative Democrat, Representative Marion Berry of Arkansas. Equally striking is that Mr. Berry's anger at Mr. Lyons seems to be based as much on personal animosity as policy differences.</p>
        <p>The House Agriculture Committee has been well known for trumpeting the interests of the nation's farmers. And, in Mr. Berry's view, Mr. Lyons has not been sufficiently vigorous in defending farmers in negotiations with the Environmental Protection Agency on new rules intended to reduce polluted runoff from farm land. Indeed, some agriculture officials say Mr. Berry was displeased that Mr. Lyons tried to negotiate with the agency at all on the rules.</p>
        <p>''The main deal here and what we have heard consistently from the agriculture community is that the E.P.A. is the enemy, and you don't sit down with the enemy,'' said an Agriculture Department official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.</p>
        <p>There are few things that get Mr. Berry's blood flowing more than the E.P.A., an agency that he has on occasion said has been taken over by communists and ''environmental extremists.''</p>
        <p>''I have no respect at all for the E.P.A. under the leadership they have today,'' Mr. Berry said. ''I think they are an out-of-control political agency.''</p>
        <p>Some Congressional staffers and agriculture officials also note that before he ran for Congress, Mr. Berry worked under Mr. Lyons at the Agriculture Department and was passed over for a job. And last June, Mr. Lyons angered Mr. Berry in a committee hearing by whispering into the ear of a senior E.P.A. official while Mr. Berry was speaking.</p>
        <p>''Marion and Jim have a little bit of history,'' said a senior Agriculture Department official, who spoke only after being promised anonymity. ''So I think this was the icing on the cake.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Berry denied that either of the two incidents had anything to do with the legislative moves against Mr. Lyons. He contended that he was motivated by Mr. Lyons's failure to stand up adequately to the E.P.A. on the issue of agricultural pollution.</p>
        <p>It is clear, however, that he is still smarting over Mr. Lyons's behavior at the hearing last June.</p>
        <p>''Both conducted themselves in a manner that was absolutely unacceptable,'' Mr. Berry said, referring to Mr. Lyons and the official from the environmental agency. ''They ridiculed the chairman, the ranking member and the whole committee. It was not just an isolated incident; it was throughout the whole hearing.''</p>
        <p>Agriculture officials and senior Democratic staffers involved in the appropriations process say they doubt that much can be done to save Mr. Lyons if Mr. Berry and Republicans carry through with their threat.</p>
        <p>With major issues like reducing trade sanctions against Cuba or allowing people to import prescription drugs from foreign countries taking  the attention on the agriculture spending measure, few of Mr. Lyons's allies expect the Clinton administration to put up much of a fight to save his job.</p>
        <p>''The White House is in the process of cutting its own deals with appropriators,'' a senior Democratic Congressional staffer said, ''and it doesn't want to spend political capital on something like this.''</p>
        <p>A White House official noted that, so far, they had had little input in the agriculture bill, which was agreed to by House and Senate negotiators this evening.</p>
        <p>''We are making every effort we can to defeat this rider,'' said this official, who spoke only after being promised not to be named. ''But based on the way they've decided to conduct business on this bill, we are not at the table, and are not in the room. That obviously is a handicap in getting this done.''</p>
