        <p>A selective listing by critics of The New York Times of new or noteworthy art, design and photography exhibitions at New York museums and art galleries this weekend. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most galleries are closed on Sundays and Mondays, but hours vary and should be checked by telephone. Gallery admission is free.  * denotes a highly recommended show.</p>
        <p>Museums</p>
        <p>''AMAZONS OF THE AVANAT-GARDE,'' Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212)423-3500 (through Jan. 7). A concise exercise, monographically arranged, this show focuses on six Russian women who painted around the time of the revolution. Several continued to work much later and do more than paint, but this is a tendentious affair, plausibly so. If only a couple of the women, Natalia Goncharova and Liubov Popova, were truly great painters, the exhibtion still isn't a case of special pleading. The Russian avant-garde wouldn't have been what it was without them collectively. The story as it unfolds here seems, if anything, more remarkable, not less, for having as little to do with sex as it does and almost everything to do with painting. Many of the works have a surprising fortitude. Revolution. A brave new art world. The dream persists even though the form it takes keeps changing. Hours: Sundays through Wednesdays, 9 a.m. til 6 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays, 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission: $12; $8 for students and the elderly (Michael Kimmelman).</p>
        <p>* ''ART AND THE EMPIRE CITY: NEW YORK, 1825-1861,'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212)535-7710 (through Jan. 7). The point is that during the antebellum years New York began to become, well, New York, America's megalopolis and an international crossroads. The great metaphor was the plan to grid Manhattan: unsentimental, open-ended, utilitarian and democratic, it created the blank sheet on which the city could draw its future. Amusing, gigantic, only marginally an art exhibition, the show is really an ostentatious illustrated history lesson via hundreds of pieces of old crockery, etchings, paintings, rosewood fire-screens, daguerreotypes and other-of-pearl folding fans. Custom-made for today's acquisitive age, the exhibition is probably the only occasion on which a 19th-century brown ceramic water cooler and a six-sided pitcher with pictures of the presidential candidate William Henry Harrison have been presented like the treasures of the pharaoh's palace in ''The Ten Commandments.'' Hours: Sundays and Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:15 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 8:45 p.m. Admission: $10; $5 for students and the elderly (Kimmelman).</p>
        <p>''A BRUSH WITH NATURE: THE GERE COLLECTION OF LANDSCAPE OIL SKETCHES,'' Frick Collection, 1 East 70th Street, (212)288-0700 (through Nov. 12). Most of the artists in this show - English, French, Italian, German, Belgian and Scandinavian, from the 17th to the 19th centuries - are barely known today. In their own age they did something quite offbeat: they left studios to paint outdoors, registering transient moments of light and atmosphere by sketching quickly in oil from nature. Until recently it was assumed that this plein air approach, used to tain had and eye for more ambitious compositions, began with the Impressionists. These canvases today are sought-after prizes. The 68 on view here were assembled by a pioneering scholar and collector in the field, John Gere (1921-1995), former keeper of prints and drawings at the British Museum, and his wife, Charlotte. Mostly painted in Rome and its surrounding countryside, they capture such painterly events as the seamed face of a rock, the rush of water through a valley, the play of sunlight on a ruin, the quirky architecture of a building or a wall. Tune your eye to small when you look at this show, and you'll find it a treasure. Hours: Tuesdays through Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Sundays, 1 to 6 p.m. Admission: $7; $5 for students and the elderly (Kimmelman).</p>

Hours: Tuesdays through Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Sundays, 1 to 6 p.m. Admission: $7; $5 for students (over 10) and the elderly (Grace Glueck).</p>
        <p>* ''THE CHINESE PAINTER AS POET,'' China Institute Gallery, 125 East 65th Street, (212)744-8181 (through dec. 10.) In China, painting, poetry and calligraphy were the dream team of art: the ''three perfections,'' they were alled. Any truly evolved person was adept at each, and discussion about any of them was framed in the same terms: rhythm, touch, tone, spiritual energy. This eloquent exhibition examines the three-way partnership through some four dozen paintings, several of them of the first rank, ranging in date from the Song dynasty (960-1279) through the 20th century. In many cases the artist has inscribed his own poem on the surface of his painting in what amounts to a virtuoso, multi-media solo performance. Hours: Mondays through Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Tuesdays and Thursdays until 8 p.m.; Sundays, 1 to 5 p.m. Admission: $3; $2 for students and the elderly (Holland Cotter).</p>
        <p>*''THE EMBODIED IMAGE: CHINESE CALLIGRAPHY FROM THEJOHN B. ELLIOTT COLLECTION,'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212)535-7710 (through Jan. 7). In China the written word has traditionally been the highest art form and a source of political and emotional power. To see that power in action, check out this grandly scaled exhibition, which brings together two superb calligraphy collections - from Princeton University and the Met - in the most comprehensive survey yet seen in these parts. The dozens of scrolls covered with hand-written words collectively radiate a kind of conversational buzz and suggest a richly varied cast of personalities: fastidious court functionaries, impulsive social agitators, unworldly monks, visionary poets. Together they offer an ice-breaking introduction to an art that can all too easily seem, to non-Chinese speakers, unapproachable. Hours and admision: See above (Cotter).</p>
        <p>''HIP-HOP NATION: ROOTS, RHYMES AND RAGE,'' Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718)638-5000 (through Dec. 31). The complex cultural amalgam of music, poetry, break-dancing, art and fashion that is hip-hop poses a serious challenge to any art museum, but with the proper resources and curatorial expertise, it could have been done. Instead, this show offers a partial outline of hip-hop history, conveyed by photographs, posters, magazine and album covers, memorabilia and monotonous exapnese of clothes that make the show nearly indistinguishable from the gift shop. Garnished with graffiti art, it bypasses many other equally interesting connections to contemporary art. Because the show omits music videos, it manages to be virtually devoid of the sounds, words and moving bodies that are the essence of hip-hop. The results are a cross between a mall and a mausoleum. Hours: Wednesday through Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. (until 11 p.m. on the first Saturday of each month); Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $4; $2 for students and the elderly (Roberta Smith).</p>
        <p>BARBARA KRUGER, Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212)570-3600 (through Oct. 22). A lot has changed about the art world in the 20 years or so since Barbara Kruger came on the scene with her snappy photomontages, but a lot has not changed about her work. Her trademark red, white and black text-and-photograph montage is a brand product of the immediate past. Dense and noisy, this retrospective, including audio embellishments, has an intended carnival atmosphere without frivolity. Your reaction will necessarily depend on a blend of genrational sympathy, political concord, aesthetic expectation and tolerance for sarcasm. Ms. Kruger was one of the 80's artists adapting Conceptualism via mass-media forms for political ends, thereby helping to broaden the purview of contemporary art and make the art world more gender-balanced. Young artists reacting against her sort of political stridency now explore subtler, more aesthetically varied routes toward expressions of selfhood. Ms. Kruger in a sense helped pave the way for her own diminished currency, which for a political artist like her may be viewed as a kind of success. Hours: Tuesdays through Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, 1 to 9 p.m. Admission: $12.50; $10.50 for students and the elderly (Kimmelman).</p>
        <p>''OPEN ENDS,'' Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53rd Street, (212)708-9400 (through Jan. 2). The third and final cycle of ''MOMA 2000,'' the year-and-half-long, millenium-marking rethinking of the Modern's permanent collection, is off and running, with the first of three staggered floor-through sections in place. The dates covered are 1960 to the present, so there's some sense of how a bastion of modernism is dealing with a postmodern world. Pretty well, judging by recent acquisitions of work by Pipilotti Rist, Matthew Barney and Cai Guo-Qiang. The real interest, though, is in smart theme shows that play with such contemporary fixations as childhood innocence and adult experience, and the blend of art, abjection and design. (The fourth-floor galleries open Oct. 19 and the third-floor galleries on Nov. 5.) Hours: Saturdays through Tuesdays and Thursdays, 10:30 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Fridays, 10:30 a.m. to 8:15 p.m. Admission: $10; $6.50, students and the elderly (Cotter).</p>
        <p>''THE OPULENT EYE OF ALEXANDER GIRARD,'' Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, 2 East 91st Street, (212)849-8400 (through March 18). The first comprehensive look at the multifaceted work of the architect and designer. Girard's contribution to contemporary design was a free approach that incorporated all sorts of visual stimuli, from Italian stage sets to Mexican folk art to motifs from modern technology, making exurberant use of color, pattern, texture and ornament. In photographs, models and objects, the exhibition displays his fabrics, graphics, interiors, furniture, tableware, radio cabinets and much else. A whole room is devoted to the more than 300 fabric and wallpaper designs he created for the herman Miller Furniture Company from the 1950's to the early 1970's, with fresh patterns and colors that pushed the limits of middle-class taste. While Girard may not have been a heavyweight in American design, he was one of its liveliest figures. Hours: Tuesdays through saturdays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Tuesdays until 9 p.m.; Sundays, noon to 5 p.m. Admission: $8; $3 for students adn the elderly (Glueck).</p>
        <p>''PIERRE ET GILLES,'' New Museum of Contemporary Art, 583 Broadway, near Prince Street, SoHo, (212)219-1222 (through Jan. 7). No history of postmodern photography, fashion photography, celebrity portraiture, record album covers or the high-brow beefcake tradition would be complete without the work of the French photo team known as Pierre et Gilles, who have collabroated on over-the-top, tightly styled, hand-finished photographs since 1976 and become wildly famous in Europe in the process. In their first American museum retrospective, their work feels more than a little embalmed, existing behind a not-so-invisible sheild of artistic conservatism. Certain images come to life as art objects - most notably, one fo a beautiful yougn sailor up to his chest in water with an iridescentnight sky behind him - but there are few of them. Hours: Wednesdays through Sundays, noon to 6 p.m.; Thursdays through Saturdays, until 8 p.m. Admission: $6; $3 for students, artists and the elderly (Smith).</p>
        <p>* BRIDGET RILEY, ''Reconnaissance,'' Dia Center for the Arts, 548 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212)989-5566 (through June 17). Once overly identified with Op Art, this British abstract painter never got her due in anti-Op New York, but this beautifully installed show of 40 paintings from 1961 to 1984 should change things. Concentrating on the early black-and-white paintings that made Ms. Riley famous, it presents stringently pure yet accessible works that have, at their best, extended the optical potential implicit in the work of Mondrian, Josef Albers and Ad Reinhardt. At their weakest, their meticulously caliberated patterns can be so aggressive that they virtually kidnap the eye, take it on a joy ride and leave it in a crumpled heap. Either way, the overall effect is of an artist of unusual dedication who has remained loyal to the original premises of her art and yet stead-fastly refused to repeat herself Hours; Wednesdays through Sundays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $6; $3, students and the elderly (Smith).</p>
        <p>''RUSKIN'S ITALY, RUSKIN'S ENGLAND,'' Pierpoint Morgan Library, 29 East 36th Street, (212)685-0610 (through Jan. 7). This show commemorates the 100th anniversary of the death of John Ruskin (1819-1900), artist, art and architectural critic, social reformer, educator and the first official professor of art in England. From its own collections, the Morgan has mined a biographical medley of letters, manuscripts, photographs, drawings, paintings and artifacts relating to the life of this Victorian giant whose published writings run to 39 volumes. Although not really an art show, it cinludes paintings and drawings by Ruskin and artists he admired, among them J.M.W. Turner and the Pre-Raphaelites John Everett Millais, William Holman Hunt, Edward Burne-Jones and Dante Gabriel Rossetti. It touches on his widely influential books of criticism, his beautifully finished sketches of architectural structures, his teaching and his monographs on proposed social reforms. Not omitted are his 1877 attack on James McNeill Whistler, his failed marriage and attraction to young girls and his sad end after a long siege of mental illness. But there is much to celebrate in his life, and this show doesn't stint. Hours: Tuesdays through Thursdays, 10:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Fridays, 10:30 a.m.m to 8 p.m.; Saturdays, 10:30 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Sundays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $8; $6 for students and the elderly; free for children under 13 with an adult (Glueck).</p>
        <p>Galleries: Uptown</p>
        <p>XENOBIA BAILEY, ''Paradise Under Reconstruction in the Aesthetic of Funk, Phase 2,'' Stefan Stux, 529 West 20th Street, (212)352-1600 (through Oct. 14). Ms. Bailey takes the homely craft of crocheting colored yard to eye-dazzling extremes. She creates expansive abstract compositions of overlapping circles that float in Kandinsky-like cosmic space and has knitted a fabulous walk-in tent in the form of a funky, totemic hat called ''Sistah Paradise Great Wall of Fire Revival Tent.'' The mystical exuberance and decorative opulence are irresistible (Johnson).</p>
        <p>STEPHANIE BROOKS, Ten in One, 526 West 26th Street, (212)604-9660 (through Oct. 14). In her funny and inventively designed works, this young Chicagoan conflates ordinarily unrelated systems of verbal or visual signification. A pair of illuminated star charts have constellations labeled by the names of fancy chocolates: ''Black Forest truffle,'' ''pecan cluster,'' ''apricot cream,'' and so on, bringing together celestial and terrestrial versions of the sublime (Johnson).</p>
        <p>WIJNANDA DEROO, Richard Anderson, 453 West 17th Street, (212)463-0970 (through Oct. 14). This Dutch photographer roams the world, taking pictures of rooms without people. Her color prints are formally persuasive, but there is also a curious, searching quality to Ms. Deroo's project, as if she were a detective. A room in Curacao is carefully decorated in a funky retro style with green-and-white striped walls and a shiny, biomorphic sofa; empty mobile-home rooms in upstate New York are grungy, desolate and vaguely menacing (Johnson).</p>
        <p>DAMIEN HIRST, Gagosian Gallery, 555 West 24th Street, (212)741-1111 (through Dec. 16). Welcome to the Damien Hirst Universe. It's a big shiny place with mathematical grid paper printed on the walls, pale pristine dot paintings and many large vitrine sculptures, including two outfitted as gynecological examining rooms and filled with water and fish. It shows the artist moving beyond the dead animals and putrefying flesh that catapulted him to fame while clarifying and enriching the grandiose themes of art: life and death and their complex, sometimes oppressive relationship to science and commerce. It contains some undeniable duds, but if it doesn't win over those who have resisted the work of this notorious young British artist, it won't be for lack of trying (Smith).</p>
        <p>TERESA HUBBARD AND ALEXANDER BIRCHLER, Bonakdar Jancou, 521 West 21st Street, (212) 414-4144 (throug Oct. 14). This husband-and-wife team (he is Swiss, she American) is known for photographs of constructed, fictional situations. Here they present a set of large color pictures shot in an empty movie theater in which a solitary woman plays various roles: snack bar attendant, usher, projectionist and so on. The stilted, carefully staged images call to mind Edward Hopper, Jeff Wall and Gregory Crewdson, but they are curiously lacking in narractive resonance (Johnson).</p>
        <p>JULIE MOOS, ''Friends and Enemies,''Fredericks Freiser, 504 West 22nd Street, (212)633-6555 (throug Oct. 14). These large double portraits of teenagers are interesting just to look at, but they become truly riveting when you find out the concept behind them. In consultation with teachers and counselors at an Alabama high school, Ms Moos deliberately paired some students who were friends and some who were not. Not knowing which are which, you look closely for clues and, more generally, ponder what photography hids and what it reveals (Johnson).</p>
        <p>RUTH PASTINE, Margaret Thatcher Projects, 529 West 20th Street, (212)675-0222 (through Oct. 14). Using small brushes and just two colors, yellow and magenta, Ms. Pastine paints stainy, monochrome pictures on square canvases. Different works vary in color from candy purple to salmon orange to taxicab yellow. Each brightens slightly toward the center, so that its seems to glow from within (Johnson).</p>
        <p>ALBERT RENGER-PATZSCH, Tatintsian, 526 West 26th Street, (212)633-0110 (through Oct. 28). If the German photographer Renger-Patzsch (1897-1966) were working today, he would probably make his formally perfect, subtly poetic pictures of industrialized landscapes, medieval church interiors and close-up plant studies into glossy, sofa-size Ciba-chromes. These small black-and-white vintage prints from the 1920's and 30's offer a welcome, intimately evocative respite from today's overly-showy photoaesthetics (Johnson).</p>
        <p>CYNTHIA SISSON, Audiello, 526 West 26th Street, (212)675-9082 (through Oct. 14). For her first New York solo show, this young painter produced akind of abstract eroticism. Flat, biomorphic shapes evoking the body are layered over diaphanous fields and entangled by carefully painted areas of floral or lacy patterning. With their delicately muted pastel colors and satiny surfaces, they seem an amalgam of Color Field painting, Indian miniature ornamentation and Victoria's Secret fantasy (Johnson).</p>
        <p>CHARLES SPURRIER, Feigen Contemporary, 535 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212)929-0500 (throug Oct. 14). Resplendent with beads, Christmas tree lights, collaged images, wood grain paper and, in one case, car fresheners, the 10 paintings here argue noisily that Mr. Spurrier's idiosyncratic painting technique, which uses surfaces made of tautly stretched Scotch tape, is as limitless in its possibilities as more traditional materials. But in the end itis the quieter works that win the point (Smith).</p>
        <p>NINE STEIN-KNUDSEN, ''The Landscape Later,'' DCA Gallery, 525 West 22nd Street, (212)255-5511 (through Oct. 14). In these almost walk-in-size canvases, Ms. Stein-Knudsen does not so much paint the romantic landscape as she paints aobutit, revisiting in post-past fashion questions of space, perspective, figuration and other approaches taken for granted in pre-19th-century work. Although the questions she poses lie on the surfaces like questions rather than solutions, the paintings are interesting in terms of scale and ambition, and her ideas of landscape as theater are worth examing (Glueck).</p>
        <p>SHIRLEY TSE, Murray Guy, 453 West 17th Street, (212)463-7372 (throug Oct. 14). An impressive 80-foot blue polystyrene foam shelf wraps around the four sides of the gallery, its surface intricately sculptured by Ms. Tse into a series of abstract topographical descapes, ancient and futuristic.The shelf sections also resemble the cushioning used for packaging electronics. This Los Angeles artist's telescoping of space, time, illusion and form is exhilarating (Johnson).</p>
        <p>Last Chance</p>
        <p>SLATER BRADLEY, ''Charlatan,'' Team Gallery, 527 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212)279-9219 (through tomorrow). This impressive show presents four brief video projections by an artist completely at ease with his medium, attuned to its various roles in contemporary life and willing to try something different every time he picks up the camera. Each of the works here has its own look, intensity and revelation. Together they form a mesmerizing meditation on obsession, death and the possibilities of art (Smith).</p>
        <p>'AN INTIMATE WORLD,'' China 2000 Fine Art, 5 East 57th Street, (212)588-1198 (through tomorrow). China 2000 has long specialized in evoking the rarefied world of the Chinese scholar-artist in a gallery contest, and it does so with particular success in this pieces. They include paintings on paper fans (a radiant scene of a mountaintop pavilion by the 17th-century artist Zheng Zhong, a 1920's painting of wisteria by Qi Baishi) and exquisite tabletop objects. The visual standout is a brush holder carved from a single piece of bamboo, with patterns of concentric rings that produce in off-kilter, sumped-cake effect (Cotter).</p>
        <p>''PORTRAITS OF LEO,'' Leo Castelli, 59 East 79th Street, (212)249-4470 (through tomorrow). This tasteful memorial show presents an assortment of affectionate protraits by artists who were supported and promoted by the gallery's founder, Leo Castelli, wo died a year ago. It cinludes a candy-colored pictur by Andy Warhol; a small, rumpled photograph of the dealer in a hal of light by Mike and Doug Starn; an amusingly kitschy ceramic head by Meyer Vaisman; the dealer's name ghostly image seen through a jigsaw puzzle screen by Jasper Johns; and an Abstract Expressionist likeness made by Elaine de Kooning in 1954 (Johnson).</p>
        <p>ALAN SHIELDS, Paula Cooper, 534 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212)255-1105 (through tomorrow) and Nicholas Davies, 23 Commerce Street, West Village, (212)243-6840 (through Oct. 14). Intricate constructions of chicken wire, dipped in paper pulp and brightly painted with watercolors, fill these two galleries with a playful, exotic festivity that is grounded in formalist materialism. Mr. Shields has long worked at mixing abstraction and decorative patterning; with his pop-out mandalas, suspended cages, space wheels and other Constructivist contraptions, he looks to be at the top of his game (Johnson).</p>
