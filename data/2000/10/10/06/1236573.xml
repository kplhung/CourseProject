        <p>Jack Tilton  49 Greene Street, SoHo  Through Oct. 14</p>
        <p>Since making her mark as a hilariously provocative cartoonist and installation artist, Nicole Eisenman has mutated into a would-be fine painter. This show, her first in New York in four years, includes some of Ms. Eisenman's comically perverse works on paper and a messy mock-thrift shop installation, but it is mainly devoted to her paintings, which, though made with earnest care, are technically rudimentary and not very funny.</p>

        <p>Jack Tilton  49 Greene Street, SoHo  Through Oct. 14</p>
        <p>Since making her mark as a hilariously provocative cartoonist and installation artist, Nicole Eisenman has mutated into a would-be fine painter. This show, her first in New York in four years, includes some of Ms. Eisenman's comically perverse works on paper and a messy mock-thrift shop installation, but it is mainly devoted to her paintings, which, though made with earnest care, are technically rudimentary and not very funny.</p>
        <p>Inspired by Renaissance models, the paintings include portraits -- notably an oversize pair of women with glowing green faces -- and narrative pictures that envision extremes of man-eating, lesbian sisterhood. A huge mural depicts half-naked amazon cannibals dining on stew made from the limbs of dead men in a neo-Classical-style ice cave. Two easel-scale works on canvas, smoothly painted in saturated colors, Early Italian Renaissance style, show spear-wielding Arctic amazons stalking men and lowering a hogtied man into an ice hole as fish bait.</p>
        <p>These pictures are formally stifled and satirically one-dimensional; they lack the Freudian weirdness of Ms. Eisenman's best drawings or watercolors, like the one depicting a family scene of exhibitionism, drug taking and genital mutilation. Ms. Eisenman's desire to do what comes less naturally may be praiseworthy, but in her studentlike attempt to paint like the old masters she risks disconnection from her own darker and more wildly idiosyncratic impulses.</p>
