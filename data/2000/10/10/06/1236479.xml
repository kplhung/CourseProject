        <p>Since the Civil War, this state, this county and this small northwest Tennessee town have been evenly split between Republicans and Democrats, swinging unpredictably from candidate to candidate. And in the last few weeks, it has become increasingly clear that Vice President Al Gore's presence on the ballot as a native son is not going to change that division much, if at all.</p>
        <p>Tennessee is as much a swing state this year as ever, and there is a serious possibility that Mr. Gore, who along with his father represented this state for 48 years in Congress, could be embarrassed here.</p>
        <p>The signs are evident on the town square here in the seat of Carroll County, which has uncannily voted for the winning president in every election since 1964. Shopkeepers and customers are evenly split between Mr. Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, and even old-timers will not venture a confident prediction of who will win the county or the state.</p>
        <p>Outside the local branch of the Edward Jones investment brokerage, Lewis Carter, a retired welder, said he had never voted for a Democratic president in his 73 years. His friend Marvin Edwards, 74, said he had never voted for a Republican. Neither is particularly moved by the fact that Mr. Gore's family farm is seven counties away.</p>
        <p>''I don't care if Al Gore's from Tennessee or anywhere else,'' said Mr. Carter, spitting tobacco juice on the street. ''His daddy was an old liberal Democrat for years and years, and I don't vote for Democrats no matter where they come from.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Edwards, a retired farmer whose family has voted Democratic since the Civil War, said he doubted that Mr. Gore's residency would make much difference among fellow Democrats.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore may be doing well in the Northeast and on the West Coast, but he is struggling for a clear lead in his home state. A poll conducted last week for two major state newspapers showed Governor Bush slightly ahead here, though his lead was within the margin of sampling error. Even though most politicians and analysts still expect Mr. Gore to carry the state, if narrowly, he may well do so despite his roots.</p>
        <p>Tennesseans simply do not seem impressed by the fact that Mr. Gore's family is from Carthage. Having grown up mostly in Washington during his father's terms in office, Mr. Gore has been an accepted if never particularly beloved figure in this state, and voters say they expect to make their final calculation the way they always have.</p>
        <p>''Decisions here are pretty much driven by party identification, and I don't think this year will be any different,'' said Bruce Oppenheimer, a political science professor at Vanderbilt University in Nashville. ''He may get a few Republicans to vote for him because he's from Tennessee, but it won't be many.''</p>
        <p>As many residents enjoy pointing out, one president from Tennessee, James K. Polk, did not carry his home state in 1844. Since the Civil War, party loyalties have been handed down like family Bibles, with Republicans in the east and Democrats dominating the west and middle. (Republicans now rule the growing suburbs of Memphis and Nashville.) The state has long been the South's most evenly divided, voting for Democrats, Lyndon B. Johnson and Jimmy Carter, in 1964, 1976 and 1980, and for Republicans, Richard M. Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George Bush, in 1968, 1972, 1984 and 1988.</p>
        <p>Tennessee did vote for Bill Clinton in the last two presidential elections -- by margins of five percentage points in 1992 and two points in 1996 -- and Mr. Gore's presence on the ticket is generally given some credit for that. But Ross Perot may be equally responsible, because Mr. Clinton never won a majority here. In the same period, voters elected Republicans to both United States Senate seats and to the governor's office.</p>
        <p>The Republican National Committee, eager to embarrass Mr. Gore at home, has gleefully seized on the latest poll numbers and is beginning a small television advertising campaign in the state's major markets. The Gore campaign has been able to avoid spending money in the state but may be forced to divert some resources here to prevent a humiliation, and even supporters sound less than fully confident.</p>
        <p>''It's no surprise that it's a close race here,'' said Greg Wanderman, executive director of the Tennessee Democratic Party. ''It's been an increasingly Republican state for the last 10 years, mostly in the suburbs. But I think Gore will win if the base turns out.''</p>
        <p>The party's base is in the urban areas of Memphis and Nashville, and in the former pro-Confederate counties of western and middle Tennessee that have always been Democratic. At best, Mr. Wanderman said, he hopes that Mr. Gore will do a few points better than Mr. Clinton did in his two elections.</p>
        <p>Other Democrats have complained that the poll, conducted by Mason-Dixon Polling and Research for The Chattanooga Times and Free Press and The Tennessean in Nashville, understated Mr. Gore's support because it relied too heavily on voters in local and state elections.</p>
        <p>But many Republicans say that next month's vote, even if Mr. Gore barely wins, could consolidate a trend away from partisan balance and toward a domination by the kind of moderate Republicans who do well here. Tennesseans remember that Mr. Gore's positions were notably more conservative when he was representing the state, said Dale R. Kelley, Huntingdon's Republican mayor.</p>
        <p>''My sense is that Gore enjoyed a good deal more support in Tennessee when he was in Congress,'' said Mr. Kelley, a former state legislator who also served in former Gov. Lamar Alexander's cabinet. ''The changes that he made to run on the national ticket have changed the attitudes of this state.''</p>
