        <p>Directed by David Maquiling  Not rated; 86 minutes</p>
        <p>The central New Jersey suburb of David Maquiling's ''Too Much Sleep'' is a curiously indistinct, spatially indefinite environment made up of white frame houses, strip malls and bland office blocks.</p>
        <p>Making his first feature film, Mr. Maquiling has removed every trace of sociological specificity; this little town could be anywhere, from the Long Island of Hal Hartley to the Pacific Northwest of David Lynch, and in the end it seems to reside primarily in the filmmaker's imagination.</p>
        <p>In outline a nightmare comedy on the order of Martin Scorsese's ''After Hours'' or David O. Russell's ''Spanking the Monkey,'' ''Too Much Sleep'' -- which opens today at Anthology Film Archives (32 Second Avenue, at Second Street, East Village) -- turns out to be a fable of initiation, grounded in the folk tales of Mr. Maquiling's Filipino ancestors.</p>
        <p>The hero, who ought to be a young warrior, is instead a 24-year-old security guard, Jack Crawford (Marc Palmieri), who lives with his mother and can never quite seem to get enough sleep, possibly because he is still trying to fit his grown-up body into the narrow bed he occupied as a child.</p>
        <p>Jack is dozing on the bus one day, on his way back home from the night shift, when a pretty girl (Nicol Zanzarella) and an older woman (Judy Sabo Podinker) pull an ancient scam on him: asking him to give up his seat, they use the moment of confusion to spirit away the paper bag he is carrying. Inside the bag is the sole tool of Jack's trade and the symbol of his as yet unearned manhood: an unregistered handgun he inherited from his father.</p>
        <p>When Jack realizes what he has lost, he consults the local shaman -- tiny, volatile Eddie (Pasquale Gaeta), a retired fixer with vague connections to the police and the underworld -- who sends him on a quest. Bouncing from place to place and test to test, Jack plays out the stages of a journey that will allow him to reclaim his stolen weapon and, with his newfound maturity, truly own it for the first time.</p>
        <p>Mr. Maquiling creates an unusual and intriguing tone somewhere between sharp, deadpan comedy and a soft, dreamy surrealism. Jack spends the initial stages of his quest listening with slack-jawed astonishment to the obsessive, self-centered monologues of the eccentric adults he encounters, giving Mr. Maquiling the opportunity to create some memorably bizarre character sketches. But his journey leads Jack through increasingly strange territory, including a gay bar the size of an airplane hangar and a curiously underpopulated Chinese restaurant.</p>
        <p>Mr. Maquiling and his cinematographer, Robert Mowen, give these scenes an overbright, otherworldly quality without quite tipping over into obvious unreality. It's as if Jack, who keeps dozing off at inopportune moments, never quite manages to snap himself awake. Perhaps too modestly for his own good, Mr. Maquiling doesn't proclaim his originality in the capital letters of a Lars von Trier or a Paul Thomas Anderson. But it is clearly there, and it marks him as a young filmmaker to watch.</p>
