        <p>LAST Sunday, Manager Bobby Valentine announced that Mike Hampton, and not Al Leiter, would be his starting pitcher when the Mets opened their division series against the Giants on Wednesday. They had similar strong records for the Mets over the course of the season, but Leiter had pitched in league championship and World Series games before. Hampton did not have that experience. Shouldn't Leiter be the guy to start the series, to get the Mets off on the right track to withstand the pressure?</p>
        <p>Valentine had his reasons, including Hampton's 9-0 lifetime record against the Giants. But Leiter is older -- 34 to Hampton's 28 -- is in his third season with the Mets and a team leader; Hampton arrived only this season. And egos in sports -- and beyond, for that matter -- being what they are, would not Leiter be in a state?</p>

        <p>LAST Sunday, Manager Bobby Valentine announced that Mike Hampton, and not Al Leiter, would be his starting pitcher when the Mets opened their division series against the Giants on Wednesday. They had similar strong records for the Mets over the course of the season, but Leiter had pitched in league championship and World Series games before. Hampton did not have that experience. Shouldn't Leiter be the guy to start the series, to get the Mets off on the right track to withstand the pressure?</p>
        <p>Valentine had his reasons, including Hampton's 9-0 lifetime record against the Giants. But Leiter is older -- 34 to Hampton's 28 -- is in his third season with the Mets and a team leader; Hampton arrived only this season. And egos in sports -- and beyond, for that matter -- being what they are, would not Leiter be in a state?</p>
        <p>Soon after word was out, Leiter appeared in Valentine's office. ''People think I'm supposed to be upset,'' Leiter said to his boss. ''I'm gonna pitch in a lot of games before this year is out. It doesn't matter to me who pitches first.''</p>
        <p>And so Leiter set a tone -- a tone that transcends the mound. It is establishing a sense of selflessness, of team comes first, that Leiter has traditionally shown.</p>
        <p>As ''must'' games go, last night's was way up there. Hampton and the Mets lost the first game. A loss in Game 2 would be sticky. After all, 2-0 deficits in three-of-five-game series are hard to counter. Leiter, though, was all the Mets could have hoped for last night as they won in 10 innings, 5-4.</p>
        <p>Entering the game, Leiter was looking at the same situation that Andy Pettitte found himself in on Wednesday after the Yankees, across the bay in Oakland, had lost the first game of their playoff series to the A's.</p>
        <p>It was up to Pettitte, a tall left-hander like Leiter, who was called on to keep his team from falling behind two games to none. And Pettitte, like Leiter, was superb, pitching seven and two-thirds innings as the Yankees won, 4-0, to tie the series at one victory apiece.</p>
        <p>Going into the ninth inning, Leiter held a 4-1 lead. But Barry Bonds smacked a double to right-center field and Valentine decided that Leiter had better let Armando Benitez handle the rest of this thing. When he headed to the bench, Leiter was given a generous round of applause by the San Francisco partisans. He tipped his cap politely, with his right hand, his left arm getting a well-deserved rest. But it wasn't curtains for the Giants quite yet. With two on, the pinch-hitter J.T. Snow slammed a Benitez fastball into the right-field stands to tie it.</p>
        <p>But the Mets pulled it out with a run in the 10th, and John Franco, replacing Benitez, halted the Giants' attack, as the Mets tied the series at 1-1 with play resuming tomorrow at Shea Stadium.</p>
        <p>Previously, two of Leiter's biggest pressure performances were the seventh game of the 1997 World Series, when he pitched six strong innings in one of the Florida Marlins' victories, and last season, when he beat Cincinnati in the one-game playoff to decide the wild-card entry in the National League playoffs.</p>
        <p>But it is Leiter's attitude and composure that are striking.</p>
        <p>Behind the batting cage before Game 2, he was joking with teammates. This is unusual in a pitcher about to start a major league game, let alone a playoff game. Most pitchers wear a game face that resembles the grim mask depicting Drama.</p>
        <p>But Leiter, who can get tight-lipped on the mound, can also be loose there, too. ''When he's in a problem out there,'' Ventura said, ''I'll walk over to calm him down and he'll start talking about food.</p>
        <p>''He'll ask about where we should go for dinner later. I'll say, 'Uh, Al, we have a situation here.' He'll say, 'If I get out of it, you buy. If I don't -- well, I'll get out of it.' ''</p>
        <p>The question for the sages after this game is, could Leiter have gotten out of it himself? He gave up hits in earlier innings and worked his way out of jams. He had thrown about 120 pitches, which these days is considered a lot. Should Leiter have been given a chance to pitch to one more batter? Yes, in hindsight, which inevitably proves the spectator's brilliance.</p>
        <p>About getting ready to pitch a ballgame, Leiter said: ''There's nerves, there's the feeling of excitement of the unknown, of going out there wondering how things are going to go.''</p>
        <p>Either way, as Leiter more or less told Valentine, the end of the world doesn't start at the pitcher's mound. Although for the Giants last night, in trying to solve Leiter, it might have seemed that way. Benitez is another story.</p>
