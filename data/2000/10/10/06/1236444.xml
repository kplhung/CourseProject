        <p>Editorial urges State Legislature to support New York City Board of Education proposal to run some of its high schools on year-round schedule because of drastic overcrowding</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>New York City's public high schools have responded to drastic overcrowding by doing away with the double instructional periods that poorly prepared students and new immigrants commonly require to become fluent readers and writers. The system is also offering abbreviated course schedules that provide six classes per day, one short of the state-mandated minimum. With the crowding getting steadily worse, the Board of Education has had little choice but to propose that it run some of its high schools on a year-round schedule, with some students attending school while others are on vacation. This sensible plan deserves prompt support in the State Legislature, which must first act to make year-round schooling fundable under state law.</p>
        <p>Year-round schooling is not a new idea. But in New York and elsewhere it has been scuttled by unions, which prefer a traditional work schedule, and parents, many of whom balked at having part of the family in school and part of it on vacation. The objections were especially strong among parents of students in the early grades, who feared that the children would be alienated from their friends and neighbors or set apart from siblings who attend school on a different schedule.</p>

        <p>New York City's public high schools have responded to drastic overcrowding by doing away with the double instructional periods that poorly prepared students and new immigrants commonly require to become fluent readers and writers. The system is also offering abbreviated course schedules that provide six classes per day, one short of the state-mandated minimum.

This sensible plan deserves prompt support in the State Legislature, which must first act to make year-round schooling fundable under state law.</p>
        <p>Year-round schooling is not a new idea. But in New York and elsewhere it has been scuttled by unions, which prefer a traditional work schedule, and parents, many of whom balked at having part of the family in school and part of it on vacation. The objections were especially strong among parents of students in the early grades, who feared that the children would be alienated from their friends and neighbors or set apart from siblings who attend school on a different schedule.</p>
        <p>But a Board of Education task force seems to have met these objections. The year-round plan would be limited to high school students at about a dozen newly built schools, thus exempting students who are too young to stay at home while their parents work. In addition, students who attended year-round schools would do so voluntarily -- and would know their schedules well in advance of the school year. The new schedule would allow students to take full course loads, with remedial work if needed, by scattering vacations throughout the school year.</p>
        <p>Before the new scheduling can be instituted, the Legislature needs to change state funding laws to define July and August as regular instructional months that are eligible for state reimbursement. This simple act will ease the crowding that is  making it increasingly difficult for students to get the instruction they are entitled to under state law.</p>
