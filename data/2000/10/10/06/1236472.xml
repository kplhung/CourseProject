        <p>THE HOUSE</p>
        <p>CLINTON IN HIS CORNER  Three weeks ago, President Clinton declared himself ''quite troubled'' by the government's treatment of Wen Ho Lee, the nuclear scientist accused of mishandling classified material. But on Wednesday night, Mr. Clinton was the most prominent speaker at a fund-raiser in Washington for John J. Kelly, the former United States attorney in New Mexico who brought the charges against Dr. Lee last December, and then quit several weeks later to run for Congress.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton and Mr. Kelly attended Georgetown University together in the 1960's and dozens of their classmates gathered in the capital to raise an estimated $100,000 for Mr. Kelly's race in New Mexico's First Congressional District against the Republican incumbent, Representative Heather A. Wilson.</p>

Wilson.</p>
        <p>Gregory Green, Mr. Kelly's campaign manager, said that Mr. Kelly ''had nothing to do'' with the treatment of Dr. Lee that troubled the president, notably the holding of the scientist in solitary confinement for nine months.</p>

        <p>CRIMINAL RECORD  Shades of Willie Horton, the rapist and murderer who became a presidential campaign issue in 1988.</p>
        <p>Another rapist is an issue in this year's Congressional race in New Hampshire's Second District, where Barney Brannen, a Democrat, is trying to unseat the Republican incumbent, Representative Charles Bass.</p>
        <p>This time the name is Hazard Campbell, convicted in a New Hampshire court of a series of sexual assaults and serving a sentence of 25 years to life. His lawyer: Barney Brannen.</p>
        <p>Early in the campaign, Mr. Bass had said that he would never have represented a heinous criminal like Mr. Campbell. Now, in the same vein, an anonymous mailing is under way in which Mr. Brannen is being denounced as a hired-gun criminal defense lawyer.</p>

        <p>THE TRAVEL LOG</p>
        <p>BY THE NUMBERS  Back on the trail yesterday, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and Vice President Al Gore each hit the Midwestern swing states, reaching out to voters still undecided after Tuesday night's presidential debate. Each candidate stopped in Michigan, only miles apart, and continued to hammer away at the other's positions. Here are the stats:</p>
        <p>Length of the Official Day: Gore, 12 hours; Bush 15 1/2</p>
        <p>States Visited: Gore, 1; Bush, 3</p>
        <p>Towns and Cities Visited: Gore, 1; Bush, 4</p>
        <p>Events: Gore, 1; Bush, 5</p>
        <p>Media interviews: Gore, 13; Bush, 10</p>
        <p>Diners visited/unscheduled drop-bys: Gore, 1; Bush, 0</p>
        <p>Vice Presidential Debate Watch: Gore, Orlando, Fla.; Bush, Cedar Rapids, Iowa</p>
        <p>Main message: Gore, tax cuts tailored for the middle class; Bush, ''tools for parents.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  October 9, 2000, Monday  A report in the Campaign Briefing column on Friday about travel by the presidential candidates misstated the number of states visited by Vice President Al Gore the previous day. It was two, not one.</p>
