        <p>Cheim &amp; Read  521 West 23rd Street, Chelsea  Through Oct. 21</p>
        <p>After a visit to Eastern Europe and the Nazi death camps in 1988, Louise Fishman's Abstract Expressionist-style painting took on a harsh, grayed-down sobriety, as if painting had become a process of mourning or penance for her. Looking at her new works, you wonder if some other significant experience -- a visit, say, to Giverny -- had awakened Ms. Fishman to new possibilities of pleasure.</p>
        <p>Her painting is still tough and gritty in its bluntly gestural, grid-based physicality, but now it has a lusciousness of color that verges on the hedonistic. ''A Stranger,'' with its web of impulsively made, wide slate gray lines over a radiant salmon pink field, is an unabashedly voluptuous yet still excitingly raw picture.</p>
        <p>Ms. Fishman's works are not what you would call serene. Each heavily layered, extensively reworked picture feels like a hard-fought standoff between forces of order and chaos. In ''That Iron String,'' thick gray swatches are troweled on in a grid formation over a swirling space of incandescent green and black, into which lines have been randomly scrawled with the wooden end of the brush: harmony is animated by a bracing dissonance.</p>
        <p>Some paintings, like ''Flying Solo,'' with its soft allover patchwork of Impressionistic color, lack the feeling of conflicted urgency that activates the most arresting works, but this show as a whole brings an exhilarating restlessness and openness to the traditional practice of modernist abstraction.</p>
