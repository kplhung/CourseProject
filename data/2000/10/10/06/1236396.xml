        <p>Did Lee Krasner (1908-1984) never find her true calling as a painter? Or was she a postmodernist before the fact? That is to say, did she reject the Abstract Expressionist myth of natural genius and deep authenticity and by working in a variety of styles over the course of her five-decade career realize the self as a field of socially constructed possibilities?</p>
        <p>In his catalog essay for the Krasner retrospective that opens today at the Brooklyn Museum of Art, the show's curator, Robert Hobbs, argues at length and often ingeniously for the latter view.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hobbs positions Krasner -- who was, depending on how you look at it, blessed or cursed by marriage to Jackson Pollock -- as an anti-Abstract Expressionist. ''Her reluctance (or inability) to settle on a single defining image serves in retrospect as a cogent critique of Abstract Expressionism,'' Mr. Hobbs asserts. ''In refusing to settle for long on such a limiting tactic, she presents an understanding of the problematics of a contingent self that is particularly germane today.''</p>
        <p>It is a canny approach. What might be seen as the central weakness of Krasner's art, its apparent lack of originality or consistent development, Mr. Hobbs turns into a strength, an embrace of complexity and unpredictability.</p>
        <p>Looking at the show's 60 works, dating from 1930 to 1981, however, it is hard to deny that despite its restless, searching energy and sporadic moments of formal power or elegance, Krasner's career looks more like one of tantalizing frustration than of real fulfillment.</p>
        <p>Born in Brooklyn, Krasner began her art career in high school. She found her way early into bohemian art circles, befriending the poet and later critic Harold Rosenberg, embracing Trotskyist politics and joining the avant-garde American Abstract Artists in the late 1930's. After meeting Pollock and moving in with him in 1941 (they married in 1945), she devoted herself wholeheartedly to promoting his career and caring for his fragile psyche.</p>
        <p>Fairly or not, Krasner has been known mainly for being Pollock's wife. Her own painting, which almost always looks heavily influenced by other artists, was never memorable enough to secure her own niche in the Abstract Expressionist pantheon until forces of feminism began working to upgrade her reputation.</p>
        <p>As economically presented in this show, organized by Independent Curators International, Krasner's career looks like that of an ambitious perennial student. It begins with a routine, academic self-portrait, followed by an exercise in de Chirico-like Surrealism. In the late 1930's, she made handsome abstractions under the tutelage of Hans Hofmann and, a little later, a couple of abstracted, strongly linear still lifes resembling Arshile Gorky's early imitations of Picasso.</p>
        <p>Krasner's ''Little Image'' series from the late 40's includes grids of hieroglyphic signs that call to mind the pictographic works of Adolph Gottlieb, and small-scale allover webs of spidery white lines on black that echo Pollock's ground-breaking cultivation of the allover field. Original or not, these paintings have a fine material and optical concentration, suggesting that Krasner's talent may have been best suited for more intimate ways of working. But she had bigger aspirations.</p>
        <p>After her husband's death in 1956, Krasner burst out with a series of large-scale Abstract Expressionist paintings called the ''Earth Green'' series: loopy, raw and splattery pictures with mythic titles like ''Birth'' and ''Sun Woman'' that look heavily indebted to Matisse, Pollock and de Kooning. The climactic ''Seasons'' packs a roiling, primitivistic frieze of harsh pink, biomorphic fertility forms (breasts, buttocks, leaves and other bulging shapes) clumsily outlined in a fat black line and set off against drab green negative spaces on a 17-foot-wide canvas.</p>
        <p>In the early 1960's, in another burst of energy after the death of her mother, Krasner produced a series of all-brown paintings with dense, allover compositions of swirly lines and hectic spattered texture that critics at the time saw as throwbacks to the glory days of Abstract Expressionism. But later in that decade, in tune with abstract painting of the time generally, Krasner turned to a more colorful, even gaudy palette, as in the garishly pink and purple ''Gaea'' (1966), and to more boldly defined forms, as in ''Green Fuse'' (1968), with its white egg shapes and wide arcing bands set off against a deep blue background and accented by vehement splashes of red and green.</p>
        <p>Finally, in the 1970's, Krasner responded to the emergence of Color Field painting and Minimalism by simplifying her compositions and replacing areas of gestural texture with flat planes of saturated color, transforming her expressionism into a bland, emblematic design with vaguely exotic (Native American or Far Eastern) overtones.</p>
        <p>Two episodes that stand out from this history of generic painting hint at a more personal road that Krasner might have taken. One day in the early 1950's, in a fit of dissatisfaction, Krasner tore up all the paintings and drawings in her studio. Returning two weeks later, she became interested in the chance arrangements of torn shapes on the floor and she began gluing fragments of painted or raw canvas and paper onto large canvases, creating jumbled Cubist compositions.</p>
        <p>Some, like ''City Verticals'' (1953), are dense, wall-like accumulations of vertical strips; others, like ''Bird Talk'' (1955), have an airy, animated feeling. There are precedents for the collages, from Kurt Schwitters to Robert Motherwell, but they have their own exuberantly playful vitality and raw sensuousness. Krasner's exhibition of these works in 1955 was a critical success; Clement Greenberg called it one of the most important shows of the decade.</p>
        <p>Twenty years later, Krasner started another series of collages, this time carefully cutting up her own 40-year-old charcoal studies from Hofmann's life drawing classes and neatly gluing to stretched canvases. These beautiful works are surely the most distinctive of Krasner's career.</p>
        <p>Within rectilinear formats, razor-sharp diagonals and sweeping curves cut this way and that, the internal soft grays and blacks of the original drawings adding ambiguous atmospheric depths and a patina of antiquity. In ''Imperative'' (1976), the interplay of the grid and the central triangle create a classical stability, while dislodged, knifelike shards and the angular, faceted drawing of Krasner's early studies create a kaleidoscopic effect.</p>
        <p>These works hark back to early-20th-century Cubism and Futurism yet have an expansive openness that belongs to the 1970's. One senses that Krasner was in sync with the collage process in a way that she never was with painting.</p>
        <p>Her painting had a kind of impatient, even desperate urgency; she seemed to throw herself at painting, as if she thought she could make a painting through sheer force of will. Almost always there is a turbulent excitement, but you miss the painterly sensuality of de Kooning or the perfect rhythm of Pollock or the color and light in Joan Mitchell's work. Perhaps Krasner was intimidated by the importance of painting and had too clear an idea of what major painting was supposed to look like: like Picasso, Matisse, Pollock or de Kooning. To collage, it seems, she brought fewer preconceptions, allowing the process to be one of discovery rather than imitation.</p>
        <p>Taking Mr. Hobbs's hint, it might also be that collage enabled the realization of a more complicated and contradictory self. If the singular Abstract Expressionist image comes from the achievement of a wholly unified creative persona, a unity that Krasner could never achieve, then collage could be a way to reflect the experience of a disjunctive, multiple self, a self at once new and old, orderly and dynamic, delicate and aggressive, impulsive and controlled, intellectual and intuitive.</p>
        <p>Krasner was not a postmodernist; she wanted all too obviously to be a great Modernist painter. But she had her moments of exhilarating freedom from that oppressive ambition.</p>
        <p>''Lee Krasner'' is at the Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, through Jan. 7.</p>
