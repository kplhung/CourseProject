        <p>REBECCA LIEBERMAN, the famous man's daughter and the newest $75,000-a-year employee at the New York City Board of Education, had been thinking about doing a book about fathers and daughters. This is the kind of concept that could become a best-seller when you're the eldest daughter of the first Jewish candidate for vice president from a major party.</p>
        <p>But Ms. Lieberman, devoted daughter though she is, gave up the idea after two interviews with potential subjects. ''Part of it was, I thought it would be hard to make it interesting,'' she confided in her bubbly, girl-next-door manner. ''People really only said positive things: 'Daddy was so great. He had incredible integrity. Such a sweet man.' ''</p>
        <p>So much for other people's daddies. As for her own, she explained between gooey bites of Rice Krispies Treats the other day at a Starbucks in Greenwich Village that she did not dish any dirt on him, either. He is, of course, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, Vice President Al Gore's running mate.</p>
        <p>Mostly, she gently poked fun at herself while waiting for her boyfriend -- an English teacher on leave from St. Ann's, a private school in Brooklyn Heights -- to whisk her away for the Jewish holidays.</p>
        <p>Like an updated Carole Lombard, she exuded a charm so seemingly guileless that it was hard to believe considerable guile didn't go into creating it. After all, this is a woman, now 31, who was just 1 when her father first ran for public office. ''I've never been involved in politics'' before, she said, adding that she did work the photocopier in one of her father's Senate campaigns, in 1988, ''but only because I couldn't get a summer job as a waitress.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Lieberman, a rangy 5-feet-8 with pea-soup eyes and her father's mobile mouth, strode up to Starbucks in tight jeans and a gray crewneck sweater, dragging a large black suitcase on wheels like a symbol of her transitory life at the moment. She has been touring the country representing the Gore-Lieberman ticket on college campuses. Despite a description of her in The New York Observer as a ''bleached blonde,'' she does not look the least bit artificial. (''I spent a lot of money on this,'' she protested.)</p>
        <p>Ms. Lieberman grew up in New Haven, where she remembers an idyllic childhood in which ''everybody used to play running bases in the street.'' She adds: ''Not me. I was very prissy.'' Her best friend, she says, ''always teases me that I was wearing pantyhose and nail polish at the age of 2.''</p>
        <p>HER mother, Mr. Lieberman's first wife, Elizabeth Haas, a clinical social worker, and her father separated when she was in sixth grade. The custody agreement for her and her older brother, Matthew, was equitable to the point of being arduous: half a week with each parent. By high school, she was spending a fair number of what her mother charitably called ''mental health days,'' watching Phil Donahue on TV (only at her mother's house) when she should have been in class.</p>
        <p>''Donahue'' paid off, though, when she applied to Barnard. The interviewer was writing a dissertation on misogyny in ''Paradise Lost.'' ''The only reason I knew what misogyny meant was that Phil Donahue had done an episode on it,'' Ms. Lieberman said. ''And I had read 'Paradise Lost.' So I was able to at least nod at the right places. I don't get to do that too much these days. I don't get a lot of nodding.''</p>
        <p>She graduated from Barnard in 1991 and the University of Pennsylvania Law School in 1997, doing nonprofit work before and after.</p>
        <p>But she remained comfortably anonymous in her home in Murray Hill in Manhattan, until it was disclosed on Sept. 15 in Newsday that she had been hired by Harold O. Levy, the New York City schools chancellor, as a fund-raiser for the public schools.</p>
        <p>Some papers immediately identified the $75,000-a-year job as a way for the politically astute chancellor to ''get the attention of the Washington elite,'' as Newsday put it.</p>
        <p>To Ms. Lieberman, it was the result of a chance encounter and lucky break, about a month before her father got his lucky break, too.</p>
        <p>She had already decided to leave her previous job, promoting health insurance for children at the Children's Aid Society, and was considering trying her hand in business.</p>
        <p>''In the midst of that, a dear family friend on the board of Children's Aid said: 'You absolutely should stay in public interest. You should go talk to Harold Levy,' '' she recalled.</p>
        <p>The friend, Alan R. McFarland Jr., a Republican investment banker, had known her father since they were classmates at Yale; his wife, Kathleen Troia McFarland, a former speechwriter in the Reagan administration, knew Mr. Levy from the time they were students at Oxford.</p>
        <p>After an initial interview with David Klasfeld, the deputy chancellor, at 5 p.m. on July 6, Ms. Lieberman was invited back for a brief conversation with Mr. Levy in his office at 110 Livingston Street.</p>
        <p>''What can I do for you?'' she recalls him saying.</p>
        <p>She told him how much she would like to work for him.</p>
        <p>''How can I refuse?'' she recalls his replying in what might have struck some other job-seeker as an unsettling echo of something out of ''The Godfather.'' But Ms. Lieberman, ever the screwball comedienne, saw it in her own dizzy way.</p>
        <p>''I was like, great!'' she says, with only-in-the-movies innocence.</p>
