        <p>Memo from: President Bill Clinton  To: Yasir Arafat</p>
        <p>It's been a tragic week in your neighborhood, and I'm sure you're wondering what I'm thinking, so let me tell you. Yasir, as I was watching the TV news of all the fighting between Palestinians and Israelis the thought occurred to me: ''Wow, this looks just like the intifada back in the 1980's.'' But then I realized that there's one big difference between then and now: Yitzhak Shamir is no longer prime minister of Israel, offering Palestinians a high-school student-council form of autonomous self-rule. No, no, no.</p>

        <p>Memo from: President Bill Clinton  To: Yasir Arafat</p>
        <p>It's been a tragic week in your neighborhood, and I'm sure you're wondering what I'm thinking, so let me tell you. Yasir, as I was watching the TV news of all the fighting between Palestinians and Israelis the thought occurred to me: ''Wow, this looks just like the intifada back in the 1980's.'' But then I realized that there's one big difference between then and now: Yitzhak Shamir is no longer prime minister of Israel, offering Palestinians a high-school student-council form of autonomous self-rule. No, no, no.</p>
        <p>The prime minister today is Ehud Barak, and he's offered you a deal that even I never imagined six months ago. He has put on the table a proposal for turning 92 percent of the West Bank into a Palestinian state. He has offered a legitimate proposal for dealing with the Palestinian refugees, with both compensation and some right of return. He has offered, and this really blew me away, Palestinian sovereignty over the Muslim and Christian quarters of the Old City of Jerusalem, and even some form of U.N. administration over what the Jews call the Temple Mount and Muslims call the Haram esh-Sharif.</p>
        <p>Yasir, that's what's on the table! Is it perfect from your point of view? No. But is it a serious Israeli opening bid that a serious Palestinian counteroffer could improve? Absolutely. And what's been your response? First you went on a worldwide magical mystery tour to avoid having to make a serious counteroffer, and you found out that the world thinks you should get busy and do a deal with Prime Minister Barak. And now your people are rioting against a provocative visit by Ariel Sharon to the Temple Mount. My God, man, can't you keep your eye on the prize? You have an opportunity to deliver a Palestinian state, and to end the misery of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, and you're out there throwing stones and demanding an international investigation into the latest shootout. Are you nuts?</p>
        <p>Of course Sharon provoked you. That's because he's always depended upon mutual fear and hatred to propel his career. Do I need to remind you that an Israeli commission of inquiry found him indirectly responsible for the massacre of innocent Palestinian men, women and children in the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps in 1982? That's who he is, but he's not the prime minister of Israel! And when you block him from visiting the Temple Mount, even as a provocation, you send a message to Israelis that if that area is under your control you will decide which ''good'' Israelis can visit and which ''bad'' Israelis can't. Nothing could be more damaging to your cause.</p>
        <p>Sharon thrives politically when you all behave like a mob. But Sharon shrinks when you're engaged in building a real peace with a moderate like Barak, and living up to your security responsibilities, which you had been doing. So, Yasir, we know who Sharon is. We also know who  Barak is. The question I have is: Who are you? Are you Sharon's partner or Barak's partner? Both men need you to succeed politically.</p>
        <p>If you're Sharon's partner, well, you're finished. The last time you tangled with him in Beirut, you ended up in Tunis. This time, God knows what sort of exile you'll end up in. Because if Israelis feel that this whole Oslo deal was just a ruse, and that it only produced better-armed Palestinians closer to them, they will crush you -- even at a huge cost to themselves.</p>
        <p>If you're Barak's partner you can end up in Jerusalem, but only if you make a serious counteroffer of your own. I know, you keep looking to the Arab leaders to give you political cover for the tough compromises, especially on Jerusalem. But I told you at Camp David: The only thing the Arab leaders are good for is applauding you when you do something really stupid.</p>
        <p>Are you just like them? Are you just another Hafez al-Assad or Haj Amin el-Husseini, who sold their people fantasies about defeating the Jews and delivered nothing? Or are you an Anwar el-Sadat, who understood how to make peace with dignity? I thought I knew, but I don't know anymore. Because you keep saying yes to the future -- without ever closing the door on the past. Time to choose, Yasir. If you make up your mind, give me a call at the White House: 202-456-1414. But it better be soon -- because once I'm gone you'll just get a busy signal -- and it better be with an answer: Who are you?</p>
