        <p>Broadway</p>
        <p>* ''CONTACT'' (Tony winner for best musical, choreography and featured actor and actress). The most potent antidepressant available in New York. Advertising has it that this show from the director and choreographer Susan Stroman is a ''dance play,'' but that hardly captures how it makes you feel. Aided by the dramatist John Weidman and a dream ensemble, Ms. Stroman has created the unthinkable: a sexy, polished work that restores the pleasure principle to the American musical. A theatrical portfolio of three seemingly un related vignettes set in different time periods, with top-drawer leading performances from Deborah Yates and the Tony winners Boyd Gaines and Karen Ziemba, ''Contact'' uses an ingeniously selected medley of recordings ranging from Bizet to the Beach Boys. But like a classic Rodgers and Hart musical, it converts the messy daily ingredients of sexual attraction and conflict into something as smoothly sweet and tart as Key lime pie. Both the intoxication of love and the hangover of loneliness are given idealized, elegant form (2:00). Beaumont, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $55 and $85 (Ben Brantley).</p>
        <p>*+ ''COPENHAGEN'' (Tony winner for best play, director and featured actress). Who would ever have thought it: that three dead, long-winded people talking about atomic physics would be such electrifying companions? Michael Frayn's endlessly fascinating speculation on the ambiguity of human motives and the limits of scientific knowledge takes on a subject that would seem to have the sex appeal of a frozen flounder: a meeting in 1941 between the Danish physicist Niels Bohr (Philip Bosco) and Werner Heisenberg (Michael Cumpsty), his former protege and a German, during which no one, to this day, knows exactly what happened. Mr. Frayn turns the encounter among the men and Bohr's wife, Margrethe (the Tony-winning Blair Brown), into a wide-ranging, intensely emotional consideration of everything from quantum mechanics to the loss of a child, from the fate of the world in the atomic age to the nature of friendship. Under the meticulous direction of Michael Blakemore, with three fiercely passionate performances, the result is a most invigorating and ingenious play of ideas (2:20). Royale, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $40 to $65; $25 student rush at box office on day of performance (Brantley).</p>
        <p>+ ''GORE VIDAL'S 'THE BEST MAN.' '' Whatever the weaknesses of this unsteady revival, it makes you wish Mr. Vidal were writing the dialogue for the presidential debates. Despite the notoriously short shelf life of satire in the theater, this 1960 morality tale of a national political convention still rings with the whip cracks of abiding worldly wisdom dispensed in quips. At its best the play brings to the back-stabbing world of campaigning some of the fiery verbal artifice that the movies ''All About Eve'' and ''The Sweet Smell of Success'' brought to the back-stabbing worlds of show business and journalism. Unfortunately, what those movies have that this production does not is a rousing, melodramatic vigor. Led by Charles Durning, Spalding Gray and Christopher Noth, under the direction of Ethan McSweeney, the starry ensemble often feels frustratingly tentative. Despite fine work from Mr. Gray, Mr. Durning and Michael Learned, the show lacks the necessary conviction to be big (2:20). Virginia, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $45 to $75 (Brantley).</p>
        <p>*+ ''KISS ME, KATE'' (Tony winner for best musical revival, director of a musical, musical actor, costumes and orchestration). A mouthwatering revival, with ham as the plat du jour, of Cole Porter's sybarite's delight of a musical about battling egos in show business. As presented by a preening cast led by the wonderful Marin Mazzie and the Tony-winning Brian Stokes Mitchell, who wear a spotlight as if it were a dressing gown and vice versa, this ''Kate'' proves that ham can indeed make a banquet if the spices are zesty enough. Avoiding the attitudes that are anathema to lively revivals of vintage musicals -- reverence and condescension -- the director Michael Blakemore and the choreographer Kathleen Marshall have shaped a show that is broad, brazen and finally irresistible. The production, which doesn't seem to have a thought in its giddy head beyond entertaining us as much as it is entertaining itself, feels like one long ear-to-ear grin. The top-drawer Porter score has been beautifully orchestrated by Don Sebesky (2:20). Beck, 302 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $29 to $85 (Brantley).</p>
        <p>Off Broadway</p>
        <p>+ ''THE CRUMPLE ZONE.'' This uneven new play by Buddy Thomas has a nicely structured plot about a gay household with a love triangle coming to crisis at Christmastime,  sequences of physical comedy that are antic without being overblown into slapstick and an effective set that evokes a pleasantly chintzy apartment on Staten Island. Most of all, though, it has a bristling, funny performance by Mario Cantone, who plays the squeaky wheel, a clamorously lonely man on the outside of the triangle looking in. Mr. Cantone is known for his high-pitched stand-up comedy work, and he knows how to take over a room. In this case the room is a tiny apartment, but he works it as a diva would. He is the kind of actor who seems most in control when he's in a tizzy, with a voice that easily and naturally runs up to shrill. But this is not a shrill performance. Even in high dudgeon there's no tension in Mr. Cantone's face or his body language, just the wicked glee of a man who loves to seize the spotlight. The magnitude of his neurotic charisma in such a small space gives his character the hilariously keening pathos that makes the play work (2:00). Rattlestick, 224 Waverly Place, near West 11th Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 206-1515. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $39 and $45 (Bruce Weber).</p>
        <p>''IT AIN'T NOTHIN' BUT THE BLUES.'' This slick musical revue, a Tony nominee in 1999, has been slimmed down to a supper-club-brisk 80 minutes in its new cabaret home, but its strength remains in its high spirits and the marvelous voices on display. The six performers are the happiest blues singers you'll ever see -- it's thematic that the show begins and ends with ''Let the Good Times Roll'' -- and each brings a full throat and a flawless sense of pitch to standards like ''I'm Your Hoochie Coochie Man,'' ''I Put a Spell on You'' and ''I Can't Stop Lovin' You.'' Showbiz values keep things cheerful and the performers on a strict leash, and as a result longtime blues fans may miss the music's mordant spirit, its down and dirty heart. There's a blues-lite feel to the evening that wouldn't suit a roadhouse, but it's perfectly apt here: the blues for the new Times Square (1:20). B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200. Mondays and Tuesdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $50 (Bruce Weber).</p>
        <p>*+ ''JITNEY.'' ''Don't put your business in the street,'' advises a character in this splendidly acted production of August Wilson's early comic drama about a gypsy-cab company in Pittsburgh. As if that were remotely possible in the Hill District, the setting of Mr. Wilson's cycle of plays about the black American experience in the 20th century and a place where private business is always on parade: real life is always the best show in town. ''Jitney,'' which has been extensively revised since its first production in 1982, could be described as just a lot of men sitting around talking. But the talk has such varied range and musicality and is rendered with such stylish detail that a complete urban symphony emerges. There are occasional whiffs of standard-issue melodrama. But under Marion McClinton's sensitive direction, every performer shines as a soloist and as a member of the chorus. It's the finest ensemble work of last season (2:35). Union Square, 100 East 17th Street, (212) 307-4100. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $20 to $55 (Brantley).</p>
        <p>''LIFEGAME.'' The Improbable Theater, the inventive young British troupe that turned Scotch tape into ectoplasm in the haunted house play ''70 Hill Lane,'' is now turning instant biography into instant, multiform theater. This appealing show is based riskily on the classic premises that everyone has a story to tell and that no examined life is truly boring. Each evening a pre-selected volunteer is brought onstage and asked basic biographical questions. The answers are quickly turned into vignettes by the company's seven-member ensemble. The result is less Jerry Springer than Federico Fellini -- that is, as in the later, warmer memory films of Fellini, like ''Amarcord,'' in which childhood recollections are recreated with both comic flourish and deep wistfulness. The overall effect is of a glowing gentleness, of curiosity coupled with respect. Any dry or awkward spots are easily overridden by your feelings of suspense and good will for the people onstage. (2:00). Jane Street Theater, 113 Jane Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 239-6200. Tuesday , Wednesday, Thursday and Friday at 8 p.m.; Saturday at 5 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 3 and 7 p.m. Tickets, $25 to $37.50 (Brantley).</p>
        <p>++ ''THE SYRINGA TREE.'' Because Pamela Gien plays most of the show in the persona of a little girl, she may try your patience. But it's a risk she takes willfully, and the payoff is a thoroughly persuasive transport to a time and a place. Most in the audience will be as innocent of the experience of living under apartheid as young Elizabeth is; that, of course, is the idea behind Ms. Gien's narrative strategy. And as we witness the evocation of a society where cruelty is both legislated and psychologically ingrained, the effect is deeply shocking. The indignities perpetrated on the blacks in Elizabeth's world, not to mention the genuine terrors that apartheid brings about -- among other things, a baby mysteriously and carelessly disappears from a hospital, and Elizabeth's grandparents are murdered -- may be disclosed obliquely, through the uncomprehending vision of a child, but they stun with the power of a gut punch. (1:30). Playhouse 91, 316 East 91st Street, (212) 307-4100. Tuesdays Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets, $47.50 (Weber).</p>
        <p>Last Chance</p>
        <p>''THE MAN WHO CAME TO DINNER.'' This revival of George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart's 1939 farce, starring Nathan Lane in a role famously modeled on Alexander Woollcott, feels busy without being lively. Under the direction of Jerry Zaks, the production seems to exist in neither the then nor the now. Much of the acting is a series of flourishes that sell individual jokes without being anchored to character or context. And Mr. Lane, looking like a cuddly Mattel-made Sigmund Freud doll in his beard and spectacles, never quite comes up with a coherent performance; it's as if he is still experimenting with his options. Tony Walton's richly colored set is a showroom-perfect evocation of period style. But the evening's most authentic glimpses into a vanished era of madcap celebrities are provided by Lewis J. Stadlen, in a character inspired by Harpo Marx, and Byron Jennings, as a charming Noel Cowardesque narcissist. Unfortunately, their appearances onstage feel as brief and brilliant as lightning. Tomorrow night's performance is to be broadcast live on PBS (2:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 2 p.m. Tickets: $40 to $70, half-price for children 18 and under; very limited (Brantley).</p>
        <p>Long-Running: Broadway</p>
        <p>Summaries of reviews by Ben Brantley and Peter Marks:</p>
        <p>*+ ''CABARET.'' This wildly popular if at times preachy incarnation of the Kander and Ebb musical is ensconced at Studio 54, where it remains a lurid, deliberately grim presentation of Weimar decadence as a prelude to the Holocaust (2:30). 254 West 54th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8; Sundays at 2 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $40 to $90; $25 rush except on Friday and Saturday nights.</p>
        <p>* ''CHICAGO.'' This hit remains far and away the best musical for grown-ups on Broadway (2:30). Shubert, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. Mondays, Tuesdays. Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $37.50 to $85; $20 rush at box office.</p>
