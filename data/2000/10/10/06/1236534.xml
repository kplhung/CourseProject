        <p>Tim Hudson has never pitched in Yankee Stadium or in the postseason, so the only questions about the 25-year-old ace of the Oakland Athletics' pitching staff were how he would respond to the pressure-filled assignment.

        <p>Tim Hudson has never pitched in Yankee Stadium or in the postseason, so the only questions about the 25-year-old ace of the Oakland Athletics' pitching staff were how he would respond to the pressure-filled assignment. But if part of the pressure comes from the craziness of New York, where the glare of the news media is larger than it is in Oakland, or just about anywhere, Hudson missed that last night.</p>
        <p>Hudson and his teammates were able to skip the media session at the Stadium because the Athletics' flight was delayed by weather. A planned nonstop flight made an unscheduled landing in Kansas City. The Athletics then headed straight to the team hotel after arriving late last night.</p>
        <p>The Yankees were not counting on nerves affecting Hudson, who was 20-6 this season after debuting in the majors last season with an 11-2 mark. Little has seemed to bother him, not since he started last season in Midland, Tex., the Athletics' Class AA affiliate. After a 3-0 record there, Hudson was moved up to Class AAA Vancouver, where he was 4-0. He made his first major league start on June 8, 1999, striking out 11 San Diego Padres in just five innings.</p>
        <p>In his only appearance against the Yankees, he shut them out for four innings last year and before he was touched for four runs, three on a Chuck Knoblauch home run, in the fifth inning. Hudson left the game with a no-decision.</p>
        <p>''I thought we were very fortunate,'' Yankees Manager Joe Torre said about not facing Hudson this season. ''Watching him pitch on TV, and he pitched for me in the All-Star Game, he has that look in his eye. He has that look of a lot of confidence, like, 'Yeah, I know I'm young, but I can get you out.' He certainly is a throwback type of guy. He doesn't give in. He's a very tough competitor.''</p>
        <p>While much has been made of the experience of the Yankees and the youthful innocence of the Athletics, Torre knows better than to mistake inexperience for inability.</p>
        <p>Torre reflected on sending Orlando Hernandez to the mound in Cleveland two years ago for his first playoff start.</p>
        <p>While Hernandez takes the mound for the Yankees tonight as an excellent postseason pitcher, compiling a 5-0 record with a 1.02 earned run average, on that day in Cleveland Torre was unsure of what to expect, at least until he happened upon Hernandez in a coffee shop.</p>
        <p>''He was serving all the people at his table, you know, getting extra spoons and cups, and he's pitching that night,'' Torre said. ''I said, 'He may not win, but I know he's not scared.' ''</p>
        <p>Now there is as much uncertainty surrounding Hernandez as there is Hudson. Hernandez struggled through a 12-13 season, hampered by elbow troubles and finishing with a loss in the season finale, when he was roughed up for five runs in six innings. His last victory came on Sept. 16 against Cleveland.</p>
        <p>''I sense that he's going to go out there with a great deal of determination,'' Torre said. ''Just because you have that determination doesn't mean you're going to be effective. Hudson's going to have that same kind of determination. Again, it's going to be based on -- our people can scream their heads off -- but if El Duque doesn't go pitch for pitch and inning for inning with Hudson and vice versa, then it's not going to be the game we anticipated.''</p>
