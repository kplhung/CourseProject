        <p>Benjamin Madigan, the sitcom character played by the Irish actor Gabriel Byrne, is that rare commodity: a handsome man who is oblivious to his own good looks. ''You have a gift and you're wasting it,'' says a colleague with disgust, when Madigan ignores an attractive women who is ogling him.</p>
        <p>The real-life question is whether Mr. Byrne, who recently won kudos for his Broadway performance in Eugene O'Neill's ''Moon for the Misbegotten,'' is wasting his other gift -- as an actor -- on a regular television series.</p>
        <p>Not at all, especially when you consider the alternatives. Playing the moodily charming Madigan may be a comedown from O'Neill, but it has  to be more fun than the supernatural Sturm und Drang of overwrought nonsense like ''Stigmata'' and ''End of Days,'' two of Mr. Byrne's recent movie gigs.</p>
        <p>''Madigan Men'' is hardly groundbreaking television, with its focus on three generations of a family -- all men -- who alternately sass and sentimentalize one another. But it's smartly written and pleasurably played by actors who prefer to tease the comedy from a line rather than punching it.</p>
        <p>Mr. Byrne's Ben Madigan, the middle generation, is a recently divorced Manhattan architect trying to find common ground with his teenage son, Luke, who lives with him three days a week. Luke is more interested in girls. Just as Ben sternly asks the boy if it would hurt him to spend time with his father, a voice emerges from his answering machine: ''Hello, Benjy.'' Seamus Madigan, Ben's father, has arrived in New York from Ireland to ask his son that very same question.</p>
        <p>Though the show is called ''Madigan Men,'' and there are three of them, there's actually a fourth character, and that's Ireland. Even the music leading in and out of commercials has been given an Irish kick.</p>
        <p>As Seamus, the wonderful actor Roy Dotrice pours affection and life into the stereotype of the canny Irish conniver. He bores his grandson with hardscrabble tales, embarrasses his son by hanging his wash on the terrace and spouts indecipherable Celtic proverbs. When Ben's son asks his father to translate one of them, Ben says, ''It's Celtic for guilt, guilt guilt.''</p>
        <p>It all could collapse into a heap of blarney, except that even in this first episode the chuckles are so amiable and the interactions so comfortable. This sureness stands out when the pilots of many new shows have the uncertain pacing of a theatrical production still in workshop. The Madigans already seem to have a friendly familiarity. That may be because Mr. Dotrice and Mr. Byrne just spent a few months onstage together in ''A Moon for the Misbegotten,'' for which Mr. Dotrice won a Tony Award.</p>
        <p>It helps that the writing, credited to the executive producer Cindy Chupack, shrewdly negotiates the sticky line between affectionate and syrupy, clearing the way with verbal shots of vinegary humor. When Ben expresses dismay at his father's decision to take his underage grandson to a bar, Seamus is unperturbed. ''Don't you remember I took you to pubs in Dublin when you were 6?''</p>
        <p>Without hesitation, Ben comments, ''The Irish Head Start program.''</p>
        <p>When Ben tells Seamus that he has to cancel plans with Luke because of a conflict, and the conflict is a date with a woman, Seamus snorts, ''What's been going on in Ireland for the past 300 years is a conflict.''</p>
        <p>It's the sort of cozy crowd-pleasing comedy that in the theater you might dismiss as too much like a television sitcom. But as a television sitcom, it's mighty easy to watch.</p>
        <p>MADIGAN MEN  ABC, tonight at 9:30  (Channel 7 in New York)</p>
        <p>Cindy Chupack, creator and executive producer; Gabriel Byrne, co-executive producer;  produced by Touchstone Television Productions in association with ATG.</p>
        <p>WITH: Gabriel Byrne (Ben Madigan), Roy Dotrice (Seamus Madigan), John C. Hensley (Luke Madigan), Grant Shaud (Alex Rosetti), and Sabrina Lloyd (Wendy).</p>
