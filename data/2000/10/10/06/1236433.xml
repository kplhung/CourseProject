        <p>The State Department expressed concern today about the fate of Pedro Riera Escalante, a former Cuban intelligence official who sought political asylum here but was forcibly repatriated to Havana on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>The United States Embassy here called on the Mexican government to take responsibility for Mr. Riera's fate. The Mexican government, after sending armed immigration agents to seize Mr. Riera from a sidewalk in this capital and putting him on a plane to Havana, said it had instructed its embassy in Havana to try to monitor what was happening to him.</p>
        <p>''We are very concerned about the human rights implications raised by this action and have asked for a full explanation'' from the Mexican government, said a spokesman for the United States Embassy, Stephen B. Morisseau. He said Ambassador Jeffrey Davidow had asked the Mexican Foreign Ministry to take responsibility for Mr. Riera.</p>
        <p>''Given the involvement of the Mexican government in this matter,'' Mr. Morisseau said, ''we believe they have a special responsibility to ensure the safety of this individual in Cuba.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Riera landed in Havana on a commercial flight in the custody of a Mexican immigration agent, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said. He is ''under the Cuban government's jurisdiction,'' the spokesman added.</p>
        <p>Mr. Riera's fate is uncertain, but conceivably dire. He worked here in the post of consul in the Cuban Embassy from 1986 to 1991, he told human-rights advocates here who had been trying to help him gain asylum for four weeks. But in reality, he told them, he was a major in the Cuban spy service, the General Directorate of Intelligence, and had for 20 years run operations aimed at disrupting the Central Intelligence Agency.</p>
        <p>He said he had broken with the agency and wanted to leave Cuba. The service does not look kindly on dissenters, and former United States intelligence officials said Mr. Riera would most likely face a secret trial and, at best, a long prison sentence.</p>
        <p>Diplomats here said they could only speculate on why the government had seized and deported Mr. Riera. One said because Mr. Riera's work here included recruiting Mexican officials, it was possible that Mexico wanted to avoid a potential spy scandal in the government.</p>
