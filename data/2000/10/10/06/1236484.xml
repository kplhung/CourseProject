        <p>American Indians constitute such a small voting bloc in national elections, about one million people, that the Census Bureau does not track their participation rates as it does for whites, blacks and Hispanics.</p>
        <p>In addition, neither Vice President Al Gore nor Gov. George W. Bush of Texas has spent much time addressing tribal issues, underscoring for many Indians a disconnection they feel from mainstream America.</p>
        <p>But in Montana, where Indians make up about 8 percent of the population and some 33,000 are eligible to vote this year, efforts have never been stronger to draw more of them into the political system by recruiting new candidates, registering voters and preaching the importance of showing up at the polls -- as if their votes, alone, could sway an election.</p>
        <p>This year, they well could.</p>
        <p>Montana has as full an electoral slate as any state this year. Voters will elect a governor, senator, representative (Montana has only one), chief justice of the State Supreme Court, state attorney general, secretary of state, superintendent of public education and state auditor, as well as all 100 members of the State House and 26 of 50 members of the State Senate.</p>
        <p>Most of the races are so close that a small number of voters could make the difference.</p>
        <p>''People are saying this is the most important election in Montana in the last 50 years,'' said Pat Smith, a member of the Assiniboine tribe and a lawyer who represents the Inter-Tribal Bison Cooperative Agency, a group that stimulates political participation by fighting to protect bison, a sacred animal to Indians.</p>
        <p>Montana's political profile is decidedly Republican, with Mr. Bush expected to carry the state and Senator Conrad Burns a slight favorite to win a third term over his Democratic challenger, Brian Schweitzer. In other races, including those for governor and the House -- both open seats currently held by Republicans -- political experts say Democrats are holding a slight lead.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Smith, as well as Democratic and Green Party activists in the state, said they would feel a lot more comfortable if they knew that more Indians, who generally vote Democratic, would show up on Nov. 7. The Indian vote could also have a large impact in Arizona, Nevada and New Mexico.</p>
        <p>''We weren't involved to a big degree 10 or 15 years ago,'' said State Representative Carol C. Juneau, a member of the Blackfeet tribe, a Democrat and one of four Indians in the Montana Legislature. ''Since then, here and throughout the United States, we have stressed to Indian groups the importance of registering as a voter and participating by running for office. But there needs to be more work done.''</p>
        <p>As one measure of progress in Montana, Ms. Juneau said, she and six other Indians are running for seats in the State House this year, all as Democrats but a record for the overall number, nonetheless.</p>
        <p>The efforts to spur greater participation by Indians have been bolstered by a three-week benefit concert tour featuring well-known artists with long traditions of political and environmental activism: Bonnie Raitt, Joan Baez, the Indigo Girls and Jackson Browne. Recognizing the political landscape in Montana, the tour began last Saturday on the Northern Cheyenne Reservation in Billings and was scheduled to include six other stops in Montana, before moving onto seven other states with large Indian populations.</p>
        <p>As they did here on Monday night to a sold-out audience of 1,300 at the Great Falls Civic Center, the artists took time between songs to preach this year's dual message: the need to register and vote and to elect candidates sympathetic to the protection of bison.</p>
        <p>Amy Ray, one of the Indigo Girls, kidded with the crowd, saying: ''Imagine the historical turn of events if Sitting Bull and all his warriors had registered to vote. Who would have been on all those faces in the Black Hills?''</p>
        <p>Ms. Ray and her partner, Emily Saliers, are the driving force behind the tour, their fourth since 1993, as chief recruiters of other artists. In an interview before the Monday concert, they said this year's tour was expecting to register several thousand new voters and raise as much as $350,000, which a nonprofit group, Honor the Earth, distributes to Indian communities through grants.</p>
        <p>The artists are waiving their usual concert fees, taking only $25 a day for meals. ''For me, it's a passion to do this,'' Ms. Raitt said, sitting in her dressing room after the concert. By her count, she has performed 275 benefit concerts, many of them for environmental and Indian causes.</p>
        <p>''I love balance and respect for the natural environment and for Mother Earth,'' she said. ''I don't think that's corny. Native Americans have always recognized the way the earth works. That's something we can all learn from.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Smith said Indians in Montana demonstrated their electoral heft as recently as 1992, when an unusually large turnout helped Bill Clinton win the state -- just the second time for a Democrat since 1948, after Lyndon B. Johnson -- and another Democrat, Pat Williams, win the House seat.</p>
        <p>But four years later, Mr. Smith said, Indians in Montana grew disillusioned when Republicans poured money into the state to help Rick Hill defeat Montana's first Indian candidate for the House, Bill Yellowtail, a Democrat who had a 15-point lead with three weeks left in the campaign. Mr. Clinton lost the state to Bob Dole.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hill is retiring this year, and Gov. Marc Racicot, a popular Republican, is barred by law from seeking a third term.</p>
        <p>''We experienced a sea change in 1992,'' Mr. Smith said, reflecting the role Indians played in the elections. ''But this year is more important. There is more at stake. If the Indian community votes, they could have a real impact.''</p>
