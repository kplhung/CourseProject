        <p>Until now the prospect of the 21st century and third millennium had not evoked much comment at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The Whitney Museum of American Art and the Museum of Modern Art have gone all out, with two- and three-part exhibitions of the last 100 years or so of modern art. In its own all-museum effort, ''1900: Art at the Crossroads,'' the Guggenheim looked back to the preceding fin de siecle, showing a cross section of academic and advanced art of that moment.</p>
        <p>The Met, meanwhile, seemed to be sitting on its hands, perhaps understandably. After all, what's a new century or even a new millennium to a museum that covers five or six thousand years of art from around the world? But apparently it's not over until the fat museum sings. The Met seems to have felt that some gesture was in order, a suitably understated yet distinctive event that only a museum of its stature and girth could pull off.</p>
        <p>A result is ''The Year One: Art of the Ancient World East and West,'' a little show with a catchy title and a big reach. Forget about 1900 or the 1900's or anything so gauche as a museumwide celebration. ''The Year One'' puts the fleeting convention of the millennial-marking art exhibition in a new perspective.</p>
        <p>Occupying a handful of galleries and containing a mere 150 objects,  many of them quite small, this show simply looks back 2,000 years to the start of what historians sometimes call the ''modern era,'' marked by the birth of Jesus. It takes a core sample of the nearly two dozen cultures flourishing at the beginning of the first millennium that are represented in the Met's collection and comes up with an array that includes coins and seals, jewelry and other accessories, glass, silver utensils, portrait busts, carved reliefs and sculptures, votive objects, architectural fragments, ceremonial vessels of ceramic and bronze and one stunning example of the so-called third style Roman wall painting.</p>
        <p>The exhibition, which is the work of a team of curators coordinated by Elizabeth J. Milleker, associate curator in the museum's Greek and Roman department, has an ambitious goal. It sets out to demonstrate that in the several centuries around the year 1, the disparate cultures of the world began to have a new awareness of one another, stimulated by the expansion of stable empires and of trade, which moved people and objects across the vast Eurasian land mass. With them traveled ideas and religious beliefs as well as stylistic conventions, materials and artistic techniques.</p>
        <p>The installation travels from west to east, from the several cultures encompassed by the Roman Empire under Augustus through the Parthian Empire of present-day Iran and Iraq, the Kushan Empire of northwestern India, the seminomadic Xiongnu Empire of Inner Mongolia, and finally to the Han Dynasty of China and the other Asian cultures clustered around it.</p>
        <p>The exhibition as art-historical time slice can seem arbitrary and capricious, especially when the slice tends toward spongy: the objects  here date from the fourth century B.C. to the third century A.D. Korea is represented by a single ceramic funerary urn in the shape of a bird; Thailand by six bronze objects, most outstandingly an eight-inch-high container covered with spirals that suggest both waves and basketry. The Xiongnu Empire, one of the show's big five, seems to be represented by almost nothing except some wonderful silver and bronze plaques with animal motifs that were made by Northern Chinese artisans and prized by the Xiongnu for use on harnesses or belts. And for some reason the show steps outside its premise at the last minute, concluding with four pre-Columbian objects, among them a small Mayan jar of carved stone, its surface enlivened by animal motifs.</p>
        <p>The show begins in galleries adjacent to the new Greek and Roman galleries, and at first it feels like an extension of them. The first works reflect the expansion and revitalization of the Roman Empire under Augustus, the first Roman emperor, who ruled from 27 B.C. to A.D. 14. Augustus started and mostly completed the building of imperial Rome, tripling the city's size. He continued to import and emulate Greek culture and secured Egypt, whose Red Sea ports gave Roman sailors access to the Arabian Sea for the first time. The first object in the exhibition is a full-length, life-size bronze sculpture of a Roman boy made in Egypt; the second gallery has a large carved stone urn made in Greece for export to Rome.</p>
        <p>It is as unusual for the Met to mix its cultures as it has been until recently for the Modern to mix its mediums, and it should happen more often. Here objects that are usually spread throughout the museum's building -- ''four blocks apart,'' in the words of one staff member -- are seen out of context, in the company of relative strangers. And the viewing conditions are outstanding: the lighting is good and objects can be looked at closely and in the round.</p>
        <p>In the show's center in particular one can follow the progress of certain influences, like the give and take between Hellenistic and Asian traits, through different cultures. They compete openly in a vitrine of small Parthian figures. They are united in two carved gravestones from the great Mediterranean trading center Palmyra, which show a man and a woman in tautly-wrapped drapery with star-struck Byzantine eyes. And they go their separate ways in Gandhara, a part of the Kushan Empire: represented here by a small relief (a stair riser) depicting maritime deities whose bulging muscles echo a Greek ideal, and an early stone carving of a Bodhisattva that even without its head is as imposing as it is otherworldly.</p>
        <p>Objects that may previously have blended into permanent collection displays can suddenly stop you in your tracks, like a small terra-cotta relief from the Shunga Dynasty of India that depicts an unusually loving royal family in finely textured garments or a Han Dynasty mortuary pillar stamped with the relatively refined patterns of serpents and topped by a fierce gnomelike guardian detailed with incisions at once brusque and deft.</p>
        <p>One certain showstopper is a large bronze ceremonial vessel from Indonesia (500 B.C. to A.D. 300) shaped like an ax head standing on its blade. This tall, slim, oddly flattened volume is accented along its gracefully curving edges with tear-shaped ribs thought to have been inspired by water buffalo horns and down its center with a starred diamond pattern. It is startlingly figural, like a regal torso, abstracted yet corseted.</p>
        <p>But at least one transformation involves more than a change of scene. One of the most stunning inclusions is a re-creation of the black and dark red frescoes originally made for bedrooms in the summer villa of Agrippa, friend and son-in-law of Augustus. The fresco panels, embellished with trompe l'oeil images of ornate yet attenuated architectural supports and horizontal cornices that mingle Greek and Egyptian influences, were staples of the old Greek and Roman galleries. But to see them in situ, relatively speaking, is to see as never before their deliciously sophisticated mixture of decorative illusion (suggestions of gilded and painted bronze, carved wood, inlaid stone), natural detail and spatial inconsistency. The black simultaneously reads as shallowly niched wall surface and infinite nocturnal space, its doubleness compounded by dark-red dado and the presence of small, free-floating landscapes whose bits of architecture are as ephemeral as the structure that hovers around us.</p>
        <p>Often the cultural, political and economic forces that this show tries to reflect are more complex than the objects can sustain; it begins to feel sketchy to the point of skeletal, more like an outline than a full exhibition. But even as the high concept evaporates and a more traditional form of connoisseurship prevails, one comes away with a succinct perception of culture as eternally in flux, driven by the incessant human desires for beauty, power and comfort and the need to know what's over the horizon.</p>
        <p>''The Year One: Art of the Ancient World East and West'' is at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 879-5500, through Jan. 14.</p>
