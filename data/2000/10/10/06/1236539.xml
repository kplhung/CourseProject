        <p>As the federal Parliament burned and tear gas wafted through chaotic streets, vast throngs of Serbs wrested their capital and key levers of power away from Slobodan Milosevic today, bringing his 13-year reign to the edge of collapse.</p>
        <p>Vojislav Kostunica, the opposition leader who claimed victory in the presidential election on Sept. 24, moved through an ecstatic crowd of several hundred thousand and proclaimed, ''Good evening, dear liberated Serbia!''</p>
        <p>The crowd shouted his name, and he shouted back: ''Big, beautiful Serbia has risen up just so one man, Slobodan Milosevic, will leave.''</p>
        <p>Behind the crowds, smoke from the burning Parliament building mingled with the blacker smoke from the burning state television and radio center -- bombed by NATO during last year's war over Kosovo -- and tear gas, all set loose as hundreds of thousands of Serbs roamed through the city to demand the exit of a leader who had brought them years of ethnic conflict, isolation and international contempt.</p>
        <p>The whereabouts of Mr. Milosevic and his family was unknown, though he was believed to be in Serbia. Two main pillars of his regime, the state news media and many of his police, were gone. But though the army stayed out of the fray, the chiefs of the security forces had yet to formally shift their allegiance to Mr. Kostunica, and Mr. Milosevic had not relinquished power.</p>
        <p>While the Belgrade police did not take serious action against the protesters and many joined them, Mr. Milosevic's interior minister, Vlajko Stoiljkovic, refused to meet Mr. Kostunica's representatives, instead asking them, ''What have you done to Belgrade?''</p>
        <p>Opposition leaders, including Momcilo Perisic, the chief of staff whom Mr. Milosevic fired in October 1998, were reportedly talking to the army to persuade them to recognize  Mr. Kostunica as president.</p>
        <p>For the time being, there were no contacts between Mr. Milosevic and Mr. Kostunica. The opposition leader told the crowd not to march on Mr. Milosevic's home and office in Dedinje, a suburb, saying: ''Answer their violence with nonviolence. Answer their lies with the truth.''</p>
        <p>As Mr. Kostunica tried to call the new federal Parliament and city government into session, the mood was boisterous, ecstatic and proud. ''All of us have simply had enough,'' said Petr Radosavljevic, a mechanical engineer. ''All we want is a normal country, where there is a future for young people.''</p>
        <p>Damir Strahinjic, 25, waving his arm over the crowd, said: ''This should be enough to see the end of him. But you never know in this country, with this guy.'' His fears were echoed by a senior member of Mr. Kostunica's staff tonight, who said, ''I'm thinking Milosevic has one more trick up his sleeve.''</p>
        <p>Earlier, Mr. Milosevic's ruling Socialist Party attacked the opposition for causing unrest and violence and vowed to fight back with ''all means to secure peaceful life.'' But faced with an uprising that has spread throughout much of Serbia, Mr. Milosevic may have run out of moves. Party members were talking to opposition leaders and even human rights lawyers.</p>
        <p>The United States and European governments threw their support behind Mr. Kostunica. In Washington, President Clinton declared: ''The people of Serbia have made their opinion clear. They did it when they voted peacefully and quietly, and now they're doing it in the streets.''</p>
        <p>With the massive outpouring in the streets, major bastions of state power defected to Mr. Kostunica. The state news agency Tanjug began referring to him as ''the elected president of Yugoslavia'' in a report signed, ''Journalists of Liberated Tanjug.'' The state newspaper Politika, founded in 1904 and deeply degraded under the Milosevic regime, went over to the opposition. And on state television, a new slide appeared: ''This is the new Radio Television Serbia broadcasting.''</p>
        <p>At 11:30 tonight, Mr. Kostunica appeared on the ''liberated'' state television, urging reconciliation on a nation used to a steady diet of government propaganda.</p>
        <p>Speaking of the burning buildings and clashes, Mr. Kostunica said: ''We hope that these sad incidents are behind us. My first hours started with pleasure, that a vision of Serbia I had all these years has started to be fulfilled.'' He promised that state television would remain ''open to all views and all voices,'' including those of the coalition that has run this country.</p>
        <p>He called for the lifting of international sanctions against Yugoslavia, which he said the European Union tonight promised him it would do as early as Monday. While he said ''we cannot forget what some countries did to us last year during the NATO bombing, we can't live against the grain,'' and he promised normal relations with the world.</p>
        <p>As thousands of people pressed into Belgrade from opposition strongholds, some were spoiling for a fight. They pushed aside police barricades on the roads to Belgrade, and some stripped police officers of their shields and weapons. Some were equipped with sticks and rocks, and they led the taking of the federal Parliament building, which was heavily guarded by police.</p>
        <p>The building was soon on fire, its windows broken, and some demonstrators began to loot it for souvenirs, including chairs, hatracks and leather briefcases used by Parliament members. Portraits of Mr. Milosevic and ballot papers for the Sept. 24 elections were dumped from the second floor, all of them already circled to vote for Mr. Milosevic.</p>
        <p>The police were lavish with their use of tear gas, which filled downtown Belgrade, but they did not charge the crowd. They used batons and stun grenades, but those who did were overwhelmed by the crowd, and some young men marched happily with their trophies: plastic police riot shields and helmets.</p>
        <p>When crowds approached the back entrance of Radio Television Serbia, the police started to come out with their hands raised. The crowd greeted them with ''plavi, plavi,'' or blue, the color of their uniforms, and gave them opposition badges.</p>
        <p>As people entered the building, some workers came out the side, including television anchors and personalities like Staka Novakovic, Simo Gajin and Tanja Lenard, who is a senior member of the Yugoslav United Left party of Mr. Milosevic's wife. The crowd began to spit on them, and Ms. Lenard found refuge behind some garbage containers.</p>
        <p>The crowd then looted the building.</p>
        <p>There was a similar scene at a police station in nearby Majke Jevrosime Street. When the police left the building, some in the crowd gave them civilian clothes. But the building was then looted -- with weapons taken -- and was set afire with gasoline bombs.</p>
        <p>In the skirmishing, at least one person died and 100 were injured today, according to independent radio B2-92, which also returned to its old frequency in Belgrade when its own headquarters were taken. The station had been seized by the government twice, and had been broadcasting by satellite. Belgrade Studio B television was also taken back from political control, and private stations affiliated with the Milosevic regime, like TV Palma and TV Pink, stopped broadcasting and put up slides that read, ''This program is canceled because of the current situation in the country.''</p>
        <p>The day's vast uprising was the culmination of a campaign to defend Mr. Kostunica's victory in the presidential elections that Mr. Milosevic called in an effort to restore his own tattered legitimacy. It was a tactical mistake of the first order, because Serbs took the election as a referendum on Mr. Milosevic's 13 years of rule and misrule.</p>
        <p>According to the opposition, Mr. Kostunica won at least 51.33 percent of the vote against four other candidates, an outright victory. But with electoral fraud, the Federal Election Commission reduced his percentage to just under 50 percent and called a runoff.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kostunica called it theft and vowed that he would not accept a runoff for an election he had won. Strikes and protests on his behalf began to spread through Serbia this week.</p>
        <p>The key moment may have come on Wednesday, when Mr. Milosevic's police failed to break a strike at a key coal mine in Kolubara. The workers, who had struck Friday to support Mr. Kostunica, refused to leave and called for help. Some 20,000 relatives and ordinary citizens from surrounding towns came to their aid, and the police let them go through, refusing to attack. Tonight, the police withdrew entirely from the mine.</p>
        <p>Later Wednesday night, Tanjug reported that the highest court had ruled that the presidential election was invalid because of irregularities. But the court's judgment, supposed to be published today, did not come, and Mr. Kostunica made it clear tonight that it was simply too late to think about any compromise over the election with the authorities.</p>
