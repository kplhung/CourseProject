        <p>When Glen Sather was hired as Rangers president and general manager last summer, he inherited a team overstocked with so many highly paid veterans, Broadway looked more gray than blue.</p>
        <p>Sather's first moves to rebuild the club -- bringing back Mark Messier, the most popular player in franchise history, signing the defenseman Vladimir Malakhov from the Stanley Cup champion Devils and trading for the tough wing Sandy McCarthy -- improved the team but did not make it younger. And when the organization's top three prospects failed to make the squad this fall, it looked as though the new boss was the same as the old boss.</p>
        <p>Sather disagreed, predicting the team would get younger before Saturday night's season opener in Atlanta. Sather moved in that direction yesterday when he engineered a deal: the Chicago Blackhawks claimed the unpopular 32-year-old defenseman Stephane Quintal, who was put on waivers Tuesday, and then sent the Rangers Michal Grosek, the 25-year-old enigmatic Czech left wing, and the physical 24-year-old defenseman Brad Brown for future considerations.</p>
        <p>''What we're trying to do is get this team better and younger,'' Sather said earlier this week.</p>
        <p>But to the impatient legions of Ranger fans who have not seen a playoff game at Madison Square Garden for the past three seasons, Sather cautioned that refashioning the team will take time.</p>
        <p>''You can't undo some of the things that have been done here in three weeks,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Many feel the Rangers could have started by keeping the precocious 19-year-old wing Pavel Brendl for at least a 10-game tryout. But Sather and Coach Ron Low decided to send him back to the minors. They made the same evaluations about Jamie Lundmark, 19, and Manny Malhotra, 20.</p>
        <p>So that leaves the Rangers with a prospective 20-man starting lineup that by early December will have 4 players under 25, 3 ages 25-29 and 13 over 30.</p>
        <p>With so many skaters over 30, why should this team be any different than the last three, which underachieved so badly that Neil Smith and John Muckler lost their jobs?</p>
        <p>''Mark Messier,'' said Tim Taylor, the checking-line center who was one of the few players to meet expectations last season. ''Vladimir Malakhov. More team unity. Good coaching staff. And a whole lot of determination to fill that void from last year.''</p>
        <p>Theo Fleury, last season's biggest bust, vowed: ''Things will be different.''</p>
        <p>Goaltending is another question mark. The former All-Star Mike Richter underwent reconstructive knee surgery last April and hopes to return in mid-October. Kirk McLean, who played well in Richter's absence last season, will start.</p>
        <p>''Everybody thought this team was better than its record last season,'' said Low, referring to the dismal 29-41-12 mark. ''Now, we'll find out.''</p>
        <p>Every team exudes confidence on the eve of a new season following an extremely wretched one. But not every team has a Messier, considered one of the great leaders in professional sports.</p>
        <p>''You bring a Mark Messier into the fold,'' Low said, ''it's likely you clean up a lot of the problems they had in the dressing room.''</p>
        <p>In his first tour with the Rangers, Messier helped to erase the ''1940! 1940!'' curse. This time, the organization is relying on him to turn around its worse three-year stretch in 30 years.</p>
        <p>Messier, who turns 40 in January, bristled at the suggestion that the Rangers are over the hill.</p>
        <p>''Thirty years old isn't old,'' Messier said. ''Being a 30-year-old hockey player in 1950 or 1960 might have been considered old. But 27 to 32 is the prime of your career now. Chronological age is not a factor if a guy has a willingness to be successful and driven.''</p>
        <p>So what happened last season?</p>
        <p>''When a team is having a year like the Rangers did last season, you get in a downward spiral,'' Messier said. ''And when you are having problems between management and the coach, and the whole organization is in turmoil, the result on the ice is what everyone sees. There's a better team here than what it showed last year.''</p>
        <p>Brian Leetch, who relinquished the team captaincy to Messier, his mentor and close friend, said, ''You still have to go out and prove it.''</p>
        <p>When asked about the status of so-called fat-cat players, Sather said: ''I think that was part of the message I delivered today. That absolutely won't be tolerated here anymore.''</p>
