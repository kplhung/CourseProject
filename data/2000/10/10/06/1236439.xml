        <p>FRANCE: GIRLS, 12, TO GET THE PILL  The National Assembly voted to allow school nurses to dispense morning-after contraceptive pills to girls as young as 12, with or without parental approval. The measure was part of a larger bill that would also allow pharmacists to sell the contraceptive without a prescription, even to minors. Officials hope the easy availability of the pills, which must be taken within 72 hours after intercourse, will help reduce the abortion rate among teens.</p>

        <p>HUNGARY: DNA TESTS IDENTIFY EX-PRISONER  Genetic tests have established the identity of a former prisoner of war who returned to Hungary this summer after spending 53 years in a Russian mental hospital. DNA tests prove he is Andras Toma, left, from Sulyanbokor, eastern Hungary, said Dr. Andras Veer, director of the National Psychiatric and Neurological Institute in Budapest. ''For Andras Toma, World War II ended today,'' Dr. Veer said.</p>

        <p>SPAIN: NEW IMMIGRATION LAW DEBATED  Parliamentary deputies began debate on new immigration legislation as the country becomes an ever more popular entry point into Europe for illegal aliens from the Middle East, Africa and South America. Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar's center-right government wants to tighten existing laws and make them more in line with European Union rules. The debate opened two days after the police apprehended 477 foreigners trying to gain entry on Spain's south coast.</p>

        <p>SPAIN: POLICE SEIZE 9 TIED TO BASQUES  In a continuing crackdown on Basque radicals, the police arrested nine suspected members of a group considered the underground political structure of the armed separatist group E.T.A., which is blamed for 13 killings so far this year. One of those detained was a San Sebastian city councilman who is a member of a legitimate political party closely linked to the E.T.A.</p>

        <p>NIGERIA: COMPULSORY PRAYERS  The government of northern Nigeria's most populous state, Kano, has made Islamic prayers legally compulsory for all Muslims, an official said. Muslims in the private and public sectors who fail to pray five times a day will be punished, State Information Commissioner Wura Muhammad Dankadai said, though he did not say what form the punishment would take. Kano announced plans in June to introduce strict Islamic law, known as Shariah, on the first day of Ramadan this year, Nov. 26.</p>

        <p>PHILIPPINES: 600 REBELS SURRENDER  More than 600 Muslim rebels, including a commander, surrendered in a ceremony led by President Joseph Estrada. Mr. Estrada urged the remaining guerrillas of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front to resume peace talks with the government.

        <p>THE AMERICAS</p>
        <p>PERU: FUJIMORI TO STAY ON  In a sign that the current political crisis is easing, the opposition and President Alberto K. Fujimori agreed that he would continue serving as president until a new head of state is inaugurated on July 28, 2001. The opposition dropped its demand that Mr. Fujimori resign sooner, but leaders say they will continue to push the president to make cabinet changes and shuffle the armed forces' leadership. Talks between the two sides are being mediated by the Organization of American States.</p>

        <p>CANADA: PEAK RENAMED FOR TRUDEAU  Canada has renamed its highest peak after Pierre Trudeau, its former prime minister, who was a rugged hiker, skier and canoeist. Mount Logan, a 19,550-foot peak in the Yukon, will now be known as Mount Pierre Elliott Trudeau, Prime Minister Jean Chretien announced Wednesday, a day after Mr. Trudeau's funeral. The mountain, the highest peak in North America after Mount Denali in Alaska (also known as Mount McKinley), is in Kluane National Park, created in 1972 when Mr. Trudeau was prime minister.</p>

        <p>CANADA: LIBERAL BACKING GROWS  Warm memories of the Trudeau years appear to have increased the electoral chances of his old party, the Liberals, according to a poll that was being conducted when the former prime minister died Sept. 28. Backing for the Liberals rose to 48 percent from 44 percent in the Leger Marketing Poll of 1,507 voters. With the government expected to call an election Nov. 27, Jean-Marc Leger, president of the polling company, said, ''The Trudeau effect is magic.''</p>
