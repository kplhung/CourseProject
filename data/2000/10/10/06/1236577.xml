        <p>'Polaroids'  Andrea Rosen Gallery  525 West 24th Street, Chelsea  Through Oct. 12</p>
        <p>After the majestic array of Walker Evans's influential black-and-white photographs, which dominated the Metropolitan Museum of Art's recent retrospective, it wasn't surprising that his color Polaroids  from 1973-74, sequestered in a final gallery, felt like an afterthought. But this selection of 72 Polaroids, most of them never exhibited before, corrects the impression.</p>
        <p>Culled from the hundreds Evans made, they show an artist as he turned 70 suddenly in love with the possibilities of color film, which he had long considered vulgar. But he was equally enamored of the direct, intimate nature of the Polaroid process, which eliminated the darkroom and yielded images nearly as small as those he made in the late 1920's, when he first took up the camera.</p>
        <p>In many of these lush little images, he revisits favorite subjects, especially weathered signs, shop windows, walls of graffiti and small-town facades. Often he moves in very close to his subject, with results that remind us that painting was a lifelong hobby for Evans. In others he works in a looser, less concentrated fashion, making casual portraits of friends, of stray hands or feet or even of himself.</p>
        <p>Another reason to visit the gallery is an elegantly spare group show of one work each by three realist sculptors: Keith Edmier, Ricky Swallow and Erick Swenson.</p>
