        <p>ART history, including recent American art history, has its share of stars who dropped from the radar screen. Edward Steichen, for decades the most celebrated photographer in the country, who died only 27 years ago at 85, has suffered a surprising decline in public recognition considering his onetime exalted fame. People these days confuse him with Alfred Stieglitz.</p>
        <p>The Whitney's present retrospective, the first major Steichen survey in New York in nearly 40 years, is a plea for resuscitation. It's a big exhibition, a little too big and skewed toward gloss, but thorough. And it comes when aspects of Steichen's eclectic career, or so the museum seems to hope, may spark interest in him among young artists who now unconsciously follow his lead and among that segment of the Whitney's clientele that shares his dedication to style, glamour, money and liberal politics. (You know who you are.)</p>
        <p>Steichen's connections to current art include his manipulating his early photographs, fooling around with the prints, making montages, adding colors and such things; his working simultaneously in multiple mediums (paintings, textiles, film); his mixing high art with commercial art unapologetically; and his adopting the role of socially committed citizen. These are different, not necessarily overlapping themes, potentially canceling one another out as impressions to be gleaned from the exhibition.</p>
        <p>The real question is how people will respond to an artist whose work, a landmark in photographic history, can seem almost too elegant, technically flawless, multifarious and essentially self-regarding. You may come away feeling a peculiar paradoxical sameness to the work despite its unusual diversity. And this has to do, I suspect, with how Steichen ultimately seemed to treat everything and everyone (from Gary Cooper to the poor children in a publicity shot for a hospital clinic during the Depression) as props to demonstrate his refined and stage-savvy sensibility.</p>
        <p>Refinement and savvy naturally made him the greatest fashion-celebrity photographer ever. Celebrity portraiture, after all, has to do with the collaboration of subject and artist for the purpose of public spectacle and mythical enhancement, not private revelation.</p>
        <p>With the possible exception of the early portrait of J. P. Morgan glowering at the camera, Steichen's icons of Chaplin, Garbo, Dietrich -- the list goes on -- betray little or nothing about these famous people beyond their images. When brought together by the dozen (here is where the show seems too big) they blur into a single impression of Steichen's manipulative skill. They are masterstrokes of surface effect reflecting, above all, him.</p>
        <p>The same might even be said of the very different photographs he selected from various sources for ''The Family of Man,'' which he organized in 1955 at the Museum of Modern Art around a series of popular, feel-good ideas about global humanity, well meaning but platitudinous. Walker Evans's phrase about Steichen's spiritual nonexistence is too unkind a cut from an aesthetically antithetical competitor, but it's not altogether off the mark.</p>
        <p>So the show, which Barbara Haskell of the Whitney has organized, both reminds us of an inadequately remembered American genius and also reopens the door to a few doubts about the work, although on several scores there shouldn't be debate.</p>
        <p>The early landscapes and city scenes, like the famous views of the Flatiron Building, are hazy, mesmeric equivalents of the paintings of Whistler or writings of Maeterlinck. The photographs are introspective poems about nature and the city wherein light is a mystical emanation and sculptural device.</p>
        <p>If any formal device links the different compartments of Steichen's work, it is this use of light to shape volume sculpturally, as in an early portrait of Stieglitz and his daughter, in which light picks out the oval picture frame, round hat and sleeve of the girl, whose arm, a flash of white at the photograph's center, locks the image in place and defines the dark area around it.</p>
        <p>Light was also at the root of the technical innovation of the fashion and advertising photographs, for which he made unprecedented use of electric lamps for theatrical effect. Steichen expertly signaled transitions of volume and texture by unmistakable light shifts, ensuring crisp translation of his images into the poor reproductive medium of the magazine. Hence his work stood out that much more on the page. His fashion shot of Norma Shearer is a good example, her profile in silhouette, light on dark, the viewer's gaze also drawn to the shimmer of her dress, which Steichen juxtaposed for various sensuous tonal effects against a matte wall and polished bureau.</p>
        <p>Extreme finesse of this sort can have a powerful appeal, and Steichen's bordered on the erotic. But it isn't fair to leave the discussion at that. At least four times during his life he embarked on fresh paths, abandoning a course when he had reached its peak of success. He was at the beginning a gifted painter, not just a photographer, in Whistlerian mode (gauzy moonlit lakes, shadowy trees under darkling skies), and also a talent scout, a kind of brilliant roving eye, who, as much as Stieglitz if not more, was responsible for introducing European modernism to America at the start of the century.</p>
        <p>Influenced by younger photographers like Paul Strand and Charles Sheeler, and no doubt by an awareness that Symbolism had been replaced by Cubism at the cutting edge of art, he then, in the 1910's, started making sharp-focus, tightly cropped close-ups of flowers and still lifes, an about-face from his previous work but no less distinguished.</p>
        <p>He next became a supervisor of aerial photography missions in the First World War. But that still wasn't it. He was a horticulturist. His first one-man show at the Modern, in 1936, was an exhibition of his delphiniums. After Pearl Harbor he commanded a group of photographers on the aircraft carrier Lexington in the Pacific, making naval propaganda and organizing photographic exhibitions. He was Captain Steichen.</p>
        <p>And as a curator in the 1950's he organized not only ''The Family of Man,'' the most popular exhibition in the history of photography, but also shows of young avant-garde photographers, the flip side of that populism.</p>
        <p>So what is he in the end? It's interesting that the last photographs he took, like the first, were of nature. Starting in the mid-50's he snapped photographs and even made a film, a private venture, of a single shad blow tree on his farm in Connecticut, where he spent his last 18 years. Nature became the tonic note to which he returned repeatedly; and notwithstanding the celebrity and fashion work, his deepest, most enduring curiosity clearly involved the basic underlying structures of organic life.</p>
        <p>In a sense he extended this fascination with the roots of things, with the essence of the natural world, to humanity when he put together ''The Family of Man.'' Its generalities expressed the same notion of a unified system and of that system's essential beauty.</p>
        <p>Maybe this explains his work's simultaneous superficiality and decency. Steichen saw everything from his Olympian perch, the master of all he surveyed, high and low, oddly and episodically unreflective, a restless, benign, flawed perfectionist.</p>
        <p>''Edward Steichen'' is at the Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676, through Feb. 4.</p>
