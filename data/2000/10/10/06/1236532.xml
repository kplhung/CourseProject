        <p>A hurricane that has lashed four nations for a week struck Mexico's gulf coast with 90-mile-an-hour winds today, after killing at least a dozen people, driving tens of thousands from their homes and causing close to a quarter of a billion dollars in damage, the National Hurricane Center in Miami said.</p>
        <p>In and around the city of Tampico, where the hurricane made landfall this afternoon, the wind raged at 94 miles an hour, and officials evacuated more than 3,000 people before the time the storm hit, Mexico's civil-defense agency said.</p>
        <p>But late today, the hurricane was downgraded to a tropical storm and was reported to be rapidly weakening as it continued inland, although flash floods and mudslides still threatened dozens of towns.</p>
        <p>No more deaths or injuries were reported.</p>
        <p>Over the past week, the storm pounded Mexico and three Central American nations, hitting hardest in Nicaragua and Belize.</p>
        <p>In Belize, the government issued an international appeal for help today, saying that 25,000 people, about one in 10 citizens, had been evacuated after the storm hit on Sunday. The damage in Belize was estimated at $200 million, a figure equal to roughly 45 percent of the nation's annual gross domestic product, said Patrick Jones, the government's chief communications officer.</p>
        <p>In Nicaragua, the storm led to at least 11 drownings and drove at least 4,000 people from their homes. And from Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula down to Panama, homes were destroyed, bridges knocked out and roads swept away.</p>
