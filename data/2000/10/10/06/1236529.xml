        <p>The opening scene of a new commercial promoting Representative Rick A. Lazio's record displays the standard text saying that it was paid by Mr. Lazio's campaign. Or at least, that is the commercial that the campaign released to reporters.</p>
        <p>Without notice, the commercial has also appeared this week on prime-time television with slightly different wording: ''Paid for by Lazio 2000/The Republican National Committee.''</p>

        <p>The opening scene of a new commercial promoting Representative Rick A. Lazio's record displays the standard text saying that it was paid by Mr. Lazio's campaign. Or at least, that is the commercial that the campaign released to reporters.</p>
        <p>Without notice, the commercial has also appeared this week on prime-time television with slightly different wording: ''Paid for by Lazio 2000/The Republican National Committee.''</p>
        <p>The chieftains in Washington had sent help, but weren't they supposed to stay away? Under an agreement championed by Mr. Lazio and approved less than two weeks ago by his opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton, the political parties and other outside groups are not to buy television and radio commercials in the New York Senate race.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio's campaign acknowledged that the Republican National Committee had paid for the commercial, and said that in all, the committee was spending $1.8 million on Lazio commercials. The campaign asserted that the commercials were appropriate under an obscure exception to the agreement between Mr. Lazio and Mrs. Clinton.</p>
        <p>Questioned about the commercial, the Clinton campaign said it was not aware of such an exception. It accused the Lazio campaign of blatantly violating the agreement, saying that it was weighing how to respond. To retaliate, it could ask national Democrats to buy advertisements on Mrs. Clinton's behalf.</p>
        <p>The discord over the Republican National Committee's spending seemed to leave the deal increasingly fragile, especially since at least two advocacy groups have already signaled that they plan to defy the campaigns and buy commercials. And it underscored how efforts to curb the role of money in elections often become weakened by loopholes.</p>
        <p>The Lazio commercial praises him for sponsoring federal legislation that allows disabled people to enter the work force without endangering their federal health-care coverage. ''Rick Lazio wrote the work incentives bill that protects disabled people from losing their benefits,'' the announcer says, before and after testimonials from disabled people.</p>
        <p>Both versions of the commercial have appeared this week. The one bought with money from the Republican National Committee was shown most prominently in the New York City market on Wednesday night during the season premiere of ''The West Wing'' on WNBC. The program, which is about a fictional White House, has become popular for political advertising.</p>
        <p>The agreement between Mr. Lazio and Mrs. Clinton is often described as a ban on commercials bought with so-called soft money, the unlimited contributions collected by the political parties. In fact, as envisioned by Mr. Lazio and authorized by Mrs. Clinton, the agreement was intended to bar any spending on commercials by entities other than the two campaigns, including those using so-called hard money, like political parties.</p>
        <p>Hard-money donations cannot exceed certain ceilings, but the money can be spent on commercials advocating the election or defeat of candidates. The parties can spend soft money only on so-called issue advertisements, which promote or attack candidates without invoking elections. The Republican National Committee, for example, can accept a maximum of $20,000 per person annually in hard money, and an unlimited amount of soft money.</p>
        <p>A Senate campaign can collect up to $1,000 per person for a primary and another $1,000 for a general election.</p>
        <p>Bill Dal Col, Mr. Lazio's campaign manager, defended the spending by the national party on the Lazio ads, saying that in negotiations with the Clinton campaign, both sides had agreed to make an exception for so-called coordinated expenditures between the political parties and the campaigns.</p>
        <p>In a typical Senate race, the national and state parties are allowed to spend a set amount of hard money on commercials in coordination with the campaigns of their candidates. In New York this year, the total amount is $1.8 million. Any other spending by the national and state parties, whether in hard or soft money, must be made independently of the campaigns, though in practice this rule is routinely violated.</p>
        <p>''At the start of the negotiations, we both agreed that the coordinateds are fine,'' Mr. Dal Col said. ''There wasn't any question ever that we weren't going to use the coordinateds.''</p>
        <p>But in an interview on Sept. 20 during the negotiations, Mr. Dal Col did not mention such an exception. Asked explicitly at the time whether the ban included spending of both hard and soft money by the political parties, he said: ''We've been absolutely clear about it: nobody can spend outside dollars on this race. Period. The campaigns should raise and expend all dollars that are spent in this race.''</p>
        <p>And in a draft of the agreement drawn up by the Lazio campaign, the coordinated expenditures are not discussed. The draft was never signed because Mrs. Clinton would endorse the agreement only with a public statement.</p>
        <p>When the Lazio campaign previewed the commercial this week for reporters, the Clinton campaign pointed out that the federal program that Mr. Lazio wrote does not exist in New York because Republicans in the State Senate would not approve financing for it.</p>
        <p>The Clinton campaign did not seem to realize at the time that there were two versions of the commercial.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Howard Wolfson, a spokesman for the campaign, criticized Mr. Lazio, though he declined to say how the campaign would respond to the new spending.</p>
        <p>''Rick Lazio repeatedly looked New Yorkers in the eye and promised he would not run Republican Party ads in this race,'' Mr. Wolfson said. ''Congressman Lazio has violated this agreement and made a mockery of this good faith deal.''</p>
