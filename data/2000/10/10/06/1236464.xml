        <p>Leaders of the Senate Finance Committee proposed tough new laws yesterday to crack down on abusive corporate tax shelters and to impose hefty penalties on those who promote sham transactions to evade taxes.</p>
        <p>The leaders, in a bipartisan move, called for tough new fines, which in some cases could not be waived, and for a drastic increase in penalties on the promoters of sham transactions.</p>
        <p>The proposals show that the campaign by Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers to combat what he says is the most serious tax enforcement problem facing the government, costing it billions of dollars each year, is gaining currency among lawmakers.</p>
        <p>Senator William V. Roth Jr., the Delaware Republican who is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, and the panel's ranking Democrat, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, adopted most of the recommendations of Treasury tax policy officials and of leading tax lawyers.</p>
        <p>The proposal would create a new class of tax shelters, called highly abusive devices, in which a strict penalty of 40 percent of the tax evaded would be imposed. Highly abusive devices are defined as those that rely on techniques that the courts have already found to be shams and which lack economic substance or a business purpose other than evading taxes.</p>
        <p>The proposal would increase a fine on promoters who fail to give the Internal Revenue Service a list of customers for a tax shelter from $50 to 50 percent of the fees they collected. Many of the most egregious abuses uncovered in recent years were sold by promoters whose fee was one-third of the tax savings, according to Treasury and Internal Revenue Service officials.</p>
        <p>The proposal also seeks to curb the use of dubious legal and accounting opinions on tax shelters and to let corporations escape penalties only if they had truly independent advice on the merits of a deal.</p>
        <p>The I.R.S. can impose a 20 percent penalty on companies with failed tax shelters. To escape this penalty under the proposal, a company would need to have obtained in advance an opinion that it was more likely than not to prevail in an audit. The opinion would have to come from an expert with no financial or other ties to the promoters that would compromise his independence, and the tax shelter would have to be disclosed when a tax return was filed.</p>
        <p>The 20 percent penalty would be required unless all of these conditions were met.</p>
        <p>Peter L. Faber, a New York tax lawyer who has been in the forefront of calling on the government to rein in abusive tax shelters, said that over all he was very pleased but that the proposal left one significant issue open.</p>
        <p>The proposal takes aim at tax shelters that lack economic substance without defining that term, which he said could result in legitimate deals being disallowed.</p>
        <p>''What happens if a transaction produces an economic gain to a company of $10 million, and a tax deduction of $500 million?'' Mr. Faber said. ''Clearly the tax benefits outweigh the economic gain, but $10 million is a lot of money.''</p>
        <p>The idea of enacting new legislation to curb shelters has concerned large corporations. Harvey Golub, the chief executive of American Express, wrote to the Treasury Department last month that the main concern of the Business Roundtable, which represents the country's largest corporations, ''is to ensure that any action aimed at abusive corporate tax shelters does not impede ordinary business transactions.''</p>
