        <p>Ice Theater of New York, which seeks to make ice-skating look choreographically imaginative as well as virtuosic, was charming and elegant and occasionally mysterious in the program it presented on Tuesday night in the Sky Rink at Chelsea Piers.</p>

        <p>Ice Theater of New York, which seeks to make ice-skating look choreographically imaginative as well as virtuosic, was charming and elegant and occasionally mysterious in the program it presented on Tuesday night in the Sky Rink at Chelsea Piers.</p>
        <p>The troupe, directed by Moira North, glided smoothly through several ensemble works. Nine skaters looked playful in ''Sweet Spring,'' choreographed by Douglas Webster, Ice Theater's associate artistic director.</p>
        <p>Six skaters also swept across the space with ease in ''Appalachia Waltz,'' choreographed by Mr. Webster and JoAnna Mendl Shaw. At times the six performers divided into smaller groups at the sides of the rink, then united again in the center. Their patterned comings and goings looked like a square dance on ice.</p>
        <p>The elaborate costumes for Elisa Monte's ''Draughtsman's Contract'' made the cast of eight resemble guests at a fancy masked ball. At this festivity, in addition to having men support the women they partnered, Ms. Monte also had the women support the men.</p>
        <p>''Rituals in 7's,'' a solo choreographed by Ms. Shaw in association with David Liu, served as a mysterious contrast to the pleasant revels. Wearing a dark suit and red gloves, Mr. Liu moved with great urgency, often twisting about and waving his arms. The choreography included  sudden falls in which he slid across the ice on his chest or back, as if he were dodging bullets. Seeming to be skating his way through a chapter of a suspense novel, he finally fled from the rink, clutching a briefcase.</p>
        <p>Several guest skaters displayed their techniques in little works reminiscent of the brilliant divertissements that often add glitter to ballet programs. Lucinda Ruh whirled so rapidly that her body became a spinning blur. Yuka Sato and Jason Dungjen jumped as well as glided, yet never made an abrupt transition.</p>
        <p>Later, in a solo, Ms. Sato skated with steadily exhilarating momentum. Constantly changing directions, Donald Jackson was nonchalant in a solo of his own.</p>
