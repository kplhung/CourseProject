        <p>Trick-or-treating is still weeks away, but a realistic-looking prison costume has already tricked the New Jersey Department of Corrections and prompted the store chain selling the outfit to issue a warning to those who buy it.</p>
        <p>The incident began on Sept. 23, when an off-duty correction officer, walking through the Cumberland Mall in Vineland, N.J., thought he spotted an escaped convict at the food court.</p>
        <p>Catching a glimpse of a man in an orange jumpsuit with the words Department of Corrections printed on the back, the officer, who has not been identified, had his girlfriend call 911. When the Vineland police arrived, it took almost 40 minutes for the man in the jumpsuit to persuade them that he was the manager of the Spencer Gifts store, part of an international chain that makes its employees dress up in costumes between Labor Day and Halloween.</p>
        <p>Chris Carden, a spokesman for the Department of Corrections, said the costume, which comes complete with a set of handcuffs,  posed a ''risk to the public safety,'' because it looked much like the outfit worn by some prisoners on work detail in New Jersey.</p>
        <p>Correction officials were so concerned about the possibility of mistaken identity that they sent a telex to local and national law enforcement officials warning them not to be fooled.</p>
        <p>''They have every right to sell it,'' Mr. Carden said, but officials wanted people to know it looked like a state prison jumpsuit. ''There is a certain amount of risk in wearing it -- not much, but some.''</p>
        <p>By yesterday, after Mr. Carden had talked with the corporate lawyer for Spencer Gifts, the retailer had agreed to take precautions as it continues to sell the costume at its 600 stores and Web site.</p>
        <p>Tracy Wain, a marketing research and strategy analyst for Spencer Gifts, which is based in Egg Harbor, N.J., said the chain had agreed to send a letter to all of its stores, instructing employees to wear the prison costume only in the store. The chain also agreed to warn customers who bought the costume, which sells for $27.99, that they ran some risk in wearing it.</p>
        <p>''We are sending out a communication to our employees in our stores, to advise customers that the costume could pose a risk and that they should wear a jacket or cover up when wearing it,'' Ms. Wain said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Wain said the costume had been selling well. A survey of several stores in the area showed that there were costumes in stock.</p>
        <p>Ms. Wain was asked if she thought the correction officer at the mall had overreacted. ''All I can say is that it's a little unlikely that an escaped convict would be sitting at a mall eating lunch,'' she said.</p>
