        <p>Chuck Knoblauch spoke in a whisper, his voice a faint mixture of sadness, bitterness and rebellion as he wondered how he fits in with the Yankees anymore. Actually, Knoblauch's words had a tinge of resolution, too, because he realizes he might not fit in at all this October.</p>
        <p>Knoblauch tucked in his shirt and adjusted his belt, his actions moving faster than his words late on Wednesday night at Oakland. Knoblauch does those routine things daily, but he does not discuss being banished from the lineup every day, so it was confusing. It, too, could become routine.</p>
        <p>''I don't expect to play on Friday,'' Knoblauch said. ''What can I do about it? I'm not going to complain.''</p>
        <p>It was a curious development when Manager Joe Torre benched Knoblauch, his best leadoff hitter, as part of a revised lineup that tamed the Athletics, 4-0, in Game 2 of the division series on Wednesday. Knoblauch is probably right about his immediate future. He is not likely to start in Game 3 tonight at Yankee Stadium and, if the Yankees win, he will probably be a cheerleader tomorrow, too.</p>
        <p>''I guess I might not play in the postseason again,'' Knoblauch said.</p>
        <p>Torre likes to ride hot players or, in this case, hot lineups. The Yankees won for the first time in nine games, so expect Torre to keep the new look intact with Derek Jeter leading off, David Justice batting third in the order, Paul O'Neill sixth, Luis Sojo at second base and Glenallen Hill as the designated hitter.</p>
        <p>What Torre should do is write Knoblauch's name at the top of the lineup card, then send it to Kinko's and order enough copies to last the month.</p>
        <p>While Torre has made bold moves before, like benching Tino Martinez, , his top run producer, in favor of Cecil Fielder in the 1996 World Series, abandoning Knoblauch is questionable. Hill punched a run-scoring single and Sojo had a two-run double in Game 2, but the Yankees must try to pester Tim Hudson tonight and Barry Zito tomorrow. No one annoys pitchers as deftly as Knoblauch.</p>
        <p>Knoblauch extends at-bats, he drains pitchers and he gives every Yankee a better clue about what they might see. Sojo belongs at second, despite crumbling like a sandcastle on one grounder Wednesday, but Knoblauch should be the D.H. Knoblauch, who finished the season with 12 hits in 29 at-bats, is wasted on the bench, while Hill can be a solid weapon coming off the bench. Torre lamented Knoblauch's absence from the lineup in August, so the manager should realize that his absence could still hurt the team, despite one inspiring game.</p>
        <p>When someone mentioned to Knoblauch that his three years with the Yankees have been surreal, he nodded. The Yankees acquired him from Minnesota in 1998 to be a catalyst, and he delivered, helping them to two World Series titles. But Knoblauch has turned throwing to first base into a daily adventure, he has been criticized by George Steinbrenner for not recuperating from an elbow injury fast enough and he has been bruised by Torre's reluctance to start him at second.</p>
        <p>''I can't get mad at Joe,'' Knoblauch said. ''The one thing that bothers me is he doesn't have confidence in me defensively.''</p>
        <p>One Yankee asked a reporter what the team planned to do at second base next season. Knoblauch is signed for another year at $6 million, and the Yankees have agreed to a two-year, $18 million extension that has never been made public.</p>
        <p>Knoblauch shrugged when he was asked about the future, but he would not want to stay with the Yankees as a part-time second baseman and he obviously is not going to give up $24 million. The only solution for Knoblauch is to overcome his throwing problem, which first erupted more than two years ago.</p>
        <p>After Torre told Knoblauch that he was not starting in Game 2, Knoblauch did not seek an explanation. During the game, Knoblauch sat in a corner of the dugout, but he was the first player to congratulate Sojo after a nifty play.</p>
        <p>''It's not Luis's fault,'' he said. ''I'm going to be a professional. I don't want to start a controversy. I want us to win.''</p>
        <p>The affable Sojo admitted that he felt awkward and called Knoblauch ''our second baseman.'' But when Sojo was asked if he expected Torre to use the Game 2 lineup tonight, he grinned and said, ''I hope so.''</p>
        <p>Sometime during the postseason, the Yankees will need Knoblauch to boost their offense. He is too valuable to ignore. For the first time in his career, Knoblauch is waiting for a chance to play. But the man who had started 26 straight postseason games for the Yankees before Wednesday did not sound like he had much hope.</p>
        <p>''It's frustrating,'' Knoblauch said, ''but all I can do is deal with it.''</p>
