        <p>Mixing harsh words with leniency, the House ethics committee has criticized Representative Bud Shuster, the chairman of the House Transportation Committee, for improper links with a lobbyist who once worked for him and for other misbehavior.</p>
        <p>The committee voted unanimously on Wednesday to issue Mr. Shuster, a Pennsylvania Republican whose committee oversees construction of highways and other public works, a critical letter, called a letter of reproval.</p>
        <p>''By your actions you have brought discredit to the House of Representatives,'' the committee said.</p>
        <p>Such a letter is the mildest form of sanction the committee (formally, the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct) can mete out, and it ends the case against Mr. Shuster. Unlike a reprimand or more severe sanction, the letter does not require action by the full House and so does not subject Mr. Shuster to wider embarrassment or further punishment.</p>
        <p>The panel, ending a three-year investigation, not only condemned Mr. Shuster's behavior but also his responses to the accusations. The wrongdoing ''cannot be described accurately either as technical or de minimis, as you attempt to do,'' the lawmakers said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Shuster had been accused of being too close to a former top aide who became a transportation industry lobbyist; of improperly accepting gifts; of encouraging his Congressional employees to blur the line between Capitol Hill duties and re-election campaign work, and of keeping sloppy campaign-expense records.</p>
        <p>Mr. Shuster said that the committee's findings constituted ''overkill'' and that he had tried to comply with the laws as he understood them. His lawyer, Reid Weingarten, defended him today as a devoted public servant and said Mr. Shuster had accepted the committee's findings to put the episode behind him and as ''an act of devotion to the institution he loves.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Shuster, 68, was first elected to the House from south-central Pennsylvania in 1972. He became chairman of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure after Republicans won control of the House in 1994. As chairman, he has enormous influence in determining which regions (and therefore which congressmen) benefit from federal transportation funds.</p>
        <p>He won re-election without opposition in 1998 and has no challenger again this year. But Mr. Shuster's tenure as transportation chairman will expire at the end of the year, under House rules limiting a chairman to three terms. The lobbyist at the center of the inquiry is Ann M. Eppard of Alexandria, Va., who worked for Mr. Shuster from 1972 until just after the election of 1994. She then formed a lobbying firm, which prospered by representing transportation interests. Ms. Eppard continued to raise money for Mr. Shuster's campaigns, partly by soliciting contributions from clients.</p>
        <p>In 1998, Ms. Eppard was indicted on charges of receiving more than $200,000 from 1989 to 1995 from a lobbyist, while she was chief of staff to Mr. Shuster, to secure favorable settlements for two businessmen whose property lay in the path of a huge Boston construction project. On Nov. 1, 1999, she pleaded guilty in federal court to a misdemeanor and was fined $5,000. Her lawyer said her violations were technical and devoid of intentional wrongdoing.</p>
        <p>Mr. Shuster was widely reported to have been under investigation in the Boston case, but he was never charged.</p>
        <p>Mr. Weingarten said that the punishment inflicted on Mr. Shuster was very mild and that ''to call it a slap on the wrist overstates its severity.''</p>
        <p>Gary Ruskin, whose Congressional Accountability Project filed the complaint that led to the inquiry, agreed that the punishment was mild.</p>
        <p>''They call it serious official misconduct, but they won't punish it,'' Mr. Ruskin said of members of the ethics committee.</p>
        <p>He called the leniency shown Mr. Shuster ''liberal permissiveness and coddling of wrongdoers.''</p>
