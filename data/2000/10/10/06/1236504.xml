        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani angrily defended the New York Police Department yesterday against a federal finding of racial profiling, saying a Justice Department investigation into police tactics was politically motivated and based on flawed analysis of stop-and-search statistics.</p>
        <p>In a blistering attack on what he said was the methodology used in the inquiry that  federal prosecutors began after the shooting of Amadou Diallo in 1999, the mayor insisted that the police generally arrested people identified by victims of the crimes -- and that a majority of those would be minority residents. The inquiry was made by the Southern District of New York, which includes Manhattan and the Bronx.</p>
        <p>Despite his emphatic defense of the department in a news conference at City Hall, Mr. Giuliani conceded for the first time that he would consider appointing someone to oversee the process of handling civilian complaints against the police. And he acknowledged that some procedures of the Civilian Complaint Review Board, many of whose members are appointed by the mayor, might need to be revamped. He allowed for those changes in response to a separate investigation under way by the Eastern District of New York, the federal district encompassing Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island.</p>
        <p>But he rejected the possibility of a federal monitor to oversee the Police Department, saying any changes he made would not be dictated by the federal government.</p>
        <p>''We would like to work with them on a voluntary basis to correct that and do an appointment of someone who would be selected by the mayor instead of someone who is imposed on the Police Department,'' Mr. Giuliani said. His office declined to elaborate on any possible changes the mayor is considering in how the board handles complaints of police brutality or mistreatment.</p>
        <p>The mayor was responding to findings by federal prosecutors that officers in the Street Crime Unit had engaged in racial profiling in recent years as they moved aggressively across the city to combat crime. If the mayor does not make concessions acceptable to the United States attorney's office, prosecutors could seek authorization from Attorney General Janet Reno to file a federal lawsuit against the city, charging it with civil rights violations and demanding broad changes, including federal oversight.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani challenged the prosecutors' findings, which were based on a statistical analysis of the crime unit's searches of people the officers had stopped because they were suspected of committing crimes or carrying guns, an official said. Prosecutors had informed the city that they had concluded that blacks and Hispanics were disproportionately singled out, and not just because the city's minority neighborhoods had higher crime rates.</p>
        <p>The mayor said he would love to personally defend the city in court against any lawsuit based on the findings, and chastised the Justice Department for ''living in some kind of unreal, politically correct world.''</p>
        <p>''I think the Justice Department, and particularly the Southern District of New York, is using criteria that make no sense at all,'' Mr. Giuliani said. ''To use population as a basis for determining police practice makes no sense.'' The mayor charged that the Justice Department's allegations were politically inspired by the Clinton administration.</p>
        <p>He warned that buckling to federal pressure could result in less effective policing, and ''probably a doubling of the crime rate in New York.''</p>
        <p>''This is about honestly trying to figure out how you can reduce the number of victims, the numbers of deaths, the number of muggings and the number of rapes that occur in the community,'' he said. He said the department's record of searching and arresting more black and Hispanic men than whites was guided by the high number of crimes committed against blacks and Hispanics, and the disproportionate number of people in those groups who are identified as suspects by the victims of violent crime.</p>
        <p>''The Justice Department is saying that the New York Police Department must be discriminating because, let's say, 25 percent of the population is African-American but 40 or 50 or 60 percent of those searched are African-American, therefore it must mean racial profiling,'' the mayor said. ''This is totally unrealistic and living in an absurd world.''</p>
        <p>Armed with charts and statistics, Mr. Giuliani continued: ''If you follow the Justice Department's theory to any kind of logical conclusion it would mean that 16.6 percent of the people we search in New York City should be 60 years or older in order to be not discriminating against the elderly. Or 52 percent of the time we should be searching women, because women make up 52 percent of the population.  However, women do not make up 52 percent of the people who commit crimes in New York City. Men disproportionately do commit crimes.</p>
        <p>''One of the years they are looking at is 1998. The percentages remain almost virtually the same for the last 3 or 4 years, and probably for the last 10 or 15. Eighty-five point two percent of the people we searched that we have records of were black or Hispanic in 1998,'' he noted. ''However, 89.2 percent of the suspects identified to us by victims were black or Hispanic. So there is no disproportion against the population you would expect the Police Department to be searching.''</p>
        <p>The Police Department has been under assault on several fronts in the last few years. The Street Crime Unit came under scrutiny after Mr. Diallo, an African immigrant, was shot and killed by four police officers from the unit. The officers were acquitted of criminal charges and the unit was overhauled. A separate Justice Department investigation into whether Mr. Diallo's civil rights were violated is still under way.</p>
        <p>The Southern District's finding of racial profiling could provide fodder for the federal investigation in the Eastern District into the practices of the department. Federal prosecutors would not comment yesterday.</p>
        <p>The mayor's comments provoked immediate criticism yesterday, in part because the statistics he used to counter allegations of racial profiling did not take into account the discretion used by officers on the street in approaching suspects. Some studies have shown that less than a third of suspects stopped and searched in New York City are approached because they have been identified by crime victims.</p>
        <p>''He is ignoring the problem,'' said Andrew G. Celli Jr., chief of the civil rights bureau of the New York State attorney general's office, which released its own report on racial profiling by New York City police in December. ''There is a reality in the streets. This needs to be addressed.''</p>
        <p>Several black and Hispanic civil rights leaders, including some who at times have been supportive of Mr. Giuliani, said yesterday that the mayor was being too defensive about charges of police misconduct, and suggested that he work more aggressively to address the problem.</p>
        <p>''This might not be as broad as it is portrayed, but it is a real issue,'' said Dennis M. Walcott, president of the New York Urban League. ''A lot of officers that are out there are not stopping people based on specific descriptions, but are just responding to general categories, such as a black male teenager.''</p>
