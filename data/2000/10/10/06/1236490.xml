        <p>Challenging an incumbent in times of peace and prosperity is not easy. And as Gov. George W. Bush of Texas campaigned across the Midwest today, he showed just how difficult it can be.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush was asked by a woman what she could tell a Democratic friend who did not like Vice President Al Gore but feared upsetting the economy through a change in administrations.</p>
        <p>The governor tried several times for an answer.</p>
        <p>''Tell her to keep an open mind,'' he said first.</p>
        <p>''No. Tell her governments don't create wealth,'' he said to some applause from an audience at the McKinley Elementary School here. ''You know, as I said, the economy's done more for this administration than the administration's done for the economy. I really believe that.''</p>
        <p>He took another tack, saying, ''Here's what I'd tell her -- fellow's got a pretty good record and he's done in office what he said he would.'' He started to argue that the administration must be changed in order to bail out Social Security and Medicare, then said, ''I'm groping for the right answer, you can tell.''</p>
        <p>Finally he began a story of how he had built a working relationship and friendship with his first lieutenant governor, Bob Bullock, a Democrat. ''You tell your friend that I think I have the capacity to reach across the partisan line,'' Mr. Bush said, ''to elevate the spirit of America, to call upon the best of this nation, not to play partisan politics with every issue, but to focus on what's good for our citizens. Just tell her that and see if that doesn't work.''</p>
