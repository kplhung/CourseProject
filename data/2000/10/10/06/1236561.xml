        <p>Considering that the Yankees have won the last two World Series and three of the last four, the Mets could pick a worse example to copy. So copy the Yankees the Mets did last night. Up to a point, that is. The plan broke down somewhere in the ninth inning, and from then on, they had to improvise.</p>
        <p>As their 10-inning, 5-4 victory over the Giants demonstrated, the Mets were good at both efforts. First, Bobby Valentine did what Joe Torre had done the day before, shuffling his lineup after the team lost the first game of a first-round playoff series to a Bay Area team.</p>

        <p>Considering that the Yankees have won the last two World Series and three of the last four, the Mets could pick a worse example to copy. So copy the Yankees the Mets did last night. Up to a point, that is. The plan broke down somewhere in the ninth inning, and from then on, they had to improvise.</p>
        <p>As their 10-inning, 5-4 victory over the Giants demonstrated, the Mets were good at both efforts. First, Bobby Valentine did what Joe Torre had done the day before, shuffling his lineup after the team lost the first game of a first-round playoff series to a Bay Area team.</p>
        <p>Now no one would dare suggest that Valentine would copy another manager's idea; perish the thought.</p>
        <p>Managers don't get to be the smartest in baseball by being copycats. But it was only 12 miles from Pacific Bell Park that Torre did his shuffle, and word didn't take long to cross the bay.</p>
        <p>The lineup shuffle worked for Torre, so why not? Of course, it helped that Andy Pettitte didn't allow the Oakland Athletics a run. But Valentine pretty much duplicated that move, too. Al Leiter gave up only one run in eight innings.</p>
        <p>What wasn't copied was the relief pitching that followed the effort by the starter. Whereas Mariano Rivera allowed the Athletics nothing, Armando Benitez gave up a game-tying, three-run home run to the pinch-hitter J. T. Snow in the ninth.</p>
        <p>The stunning blow that ignited a prolonged Pacific Bell Park roar that probably could be heard across the bay was what forced the Mets to improvise.</p>
        <p>Darryl Hamilton and Jay Payton performed the first phase of the improvisation with two-out hits in the 10th inning that produced the tie-breaking run.</p>
        <p>Then John Franco did his part, relieving Benitez with a runner at first base and no one out and securing three successive outs, the last on a call of strike three on Barry Bonds that the Mets had not got in a critical situation in the first game.</p>
        <p>Hamilton had not been so fortunate in a critical situation in the first game. Batting with the bases loaded and two out in the eighth inning and the Giants leading, 5-1, Hamilton struck out against Felix Rodriguez, a hard-throwing right-handed relief pitcher.</p>
        <p>As Hamilton prepared to bat against Rodriguez as a pinch-hitter with two out in the 10th last night, he thought of that at-bat.</p>
        <p>''He struck me out on a good pitch on the outside corner,'' Hamilton said, ''and then he did a little dance. He just jumped off the mound and gave a little dance.</p>
        <p>''I know guys on his team had talked to him about it. I didn't think it was cool doing it. Nobody on this team is going to show up anybody on their ball club. I took offense to it. I didn't think it was cool at all.''</p>
        <p>So when he knew he would be batting in the 10th, Hamilton sat by himself thinking about what he wanted to do.</p>
        <p>''I really wanted to get a hit this at-bat,'' he said. ''Tonight was the most intense I've ever been going to the plate. I sat on the side and said, 'C'mon, you gotta get this guy after what he did yesterday. You gotta find a way to get a hit off this guy.' ''</p>
        <p>And when he went to the plate, Hamilton said, ''I was trying to swing as hard as I can.''</p>
        <p>His hard swing against another good fastball sent the baseball on a line into the right-center field gap for a double.</p>
        <p>Payton, whom Valentine had dropped from second to seventh in his lineup shuffle, was the next batter, and he had not hit a ball out of the infield in four previous times at bat. In his last at-bat he had even grounded into a double play.</p>
        <p>''I was taking a lot of pitches today,'' Payton said later. ''That last time I just wanted to go up and be aggressive. He threw something over the middle of the plate, I took a good hack at it and got a good piece of it.''</p>
        <p>Payton's line drive also went to right-center, for a single that sent Hamilton scampering home.</p>
        <p>The Mets were now three outs away from tying the three-of-five-game series at one game each. But they still had that last bit of improvisation to do.</p>
        <p>Benitez was still pitching when the Giants began their half of the 10th, and Armando Rios began it with a single. Franco relieved Benitez, and Rios was sacrificed to second.</p>
        <p>Then Rios sacrificed himself to the Mets' chances for a victory. When Bill Mueller hit a grounder to Mike Bordick at shortstop, Rios took off for third.</p>
        <p>''What was he doing?'' a still-incredulous Bordick said to Edgardo Alfonzo, the Mets' second baseman, minutes after the game ended.</p>
        <p>Asked the same question by reporters, Bordick said, ''I think he wanted to score, and I think he thought the ball was going through. He was so anxious to score that run. He was just overaggressive.</p>
        <p>''The ball was hit pretty much right at me. I saw him out of the corner of my eye break. He kind of stopped about three-quarters of the way. It looked like he was contemplating getting in a rundown. That's when I threw the ball.</p>
        <p>''If he had kept going, it might have been closer.''</p>
        <p>The game was close enough, certainly closer than the Yankees' game against the Athletics 24 hours earlier. Next time, the Mets will try to copy the Yankees down to the last out.</p>
