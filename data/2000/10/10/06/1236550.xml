        <p>For two games, the Atlanta Braves have been ambushed at Busch Stadium, outplayed and overwhelmed by a team that looks intent on dethroning the defending National League champions.</p>
        <p>Today, the St. Louis Cardinals pounded Tom Glavine, the Braves' left-handed Cy Young award candidate, as if he were a last-minute call-up from the minor leagues. And in rolling to a 10-4 victory behind the steady pitching of Darryl Kile, the Cardinals took a commanding 2-0 lead in the three-of-five-game series.</p>
        <p>Will Clark set the tone, rocketing a three-run homer in the first inning. Carlos Hernandez continued the barrage with a home run in the second, and Glavine never made it through the third inning.</p>
        <p>The veteran left-hander surrendered three more runs on a single by Edgar Renteria, a double by Jim Edmonds, a sacrifice fly by Eric Davis, and a two-run double to right-center field by Ray Lankford. Just like that, St. Louis had a 7-2 lead, the rout was on, and the Cardinals never let up.</p>
        <p>Mark McGwire and Edmonds provided the finishing touches in the eighth inning with McGwire blasting a pinch-homer over the center-field fence, and Edmonds making a brilliant over-the-shoulder catch in front of the center-field fence. When it was over, the Cardinals had put themselves within a victory of moving on to the National League Championship Series. Pick an adjective to describe the Braves: stunned, subdued, baffled, beleaguered. They all fit. In deep trouble, the Braves must win three consecutive games to keep their season alive, starting with Game 3 on Saturday afternoon at Turner Field.</p>
        <p>Atlanta must hope that a change of scenery changes the momentum because here on their home field, the Cardinals have been relentless. In successive games, St. Louis has rocked Greg Maddux, a 19-game winner, and Glavine, the top winner in the majors this season with 21 victories.</p>
        <p>Maddux was hurt by Atlanta's shaky fielding while giving up six first-inning runs in Game 1. In Game 2, Glavine could only blame himself and the Cardinals hitters. The Cardinals did not fool around with checked-swing singles and seeing-eye hits. They smacked line drives into the gap. They hit majestic drives over the fence. The crowd of 52,389, mostly wearing Cardinal red, was sent into a frenzy.</p>
        <p>''We're going to find out a lot about ourselves in the next few days,'' said Glavine, whose usual pinpoint control vanished, leaving many pitches over the plate for the Cards to attack.</p>
        <p>Chipper Jones said: ''Sometimes it snowballs and you can't stop it. But we had better find a way.''</p>
        <p>While many players have contributed for St. Louis, Edmonds has been the star. He went 3 for 4 today, with three doubles and two runs batted in, making him 6 for 9 in the series, with four runs batted in. But Edmonds's defensive gem may have left the biggest impression.</p>
        <p>Playing his typically shallow center field, Edmonds turned his back on a ball hit by Rafael Furcal, streaked toward the fence, drifted toward his right, and made a turning over-the-shoulder grab with his back to the infield as the ball dropped.</p>
        <p>The crowd erupted, and began chanting ''M.V.P., M.V.P.''</p>
        <p>The Braves looked good for about 20 minutes, taking a 2-0 lead in the first inning on a run-scoring single by Chipper Jones and a run-scoring groundout by Brian Jordan. But the Cardinals answered immediately in their half when Clark slammed a three-run homer over the right-field fence to put St. Louis ahead to stay.</p>
        <p>Clark has been a major cog in the St. Louis attack since being acquired in a July 31 trade with the Baltimore Orioles. While hitting .345 with 12 homers in 51 games with St. Louis, Clark filled the sizeable void left when McGwire's knee injury reduced him to part-time service.</p>
        <p>Clark's home run off a Glavine changeup today erased the Braves' lead and ignited the rout.</p>
        <p>Hernandez homered in the second inning, then in the third, four of the first five Cardinals reached base, forcing Braves Manager Bobby Cox to remove Glavine. It was Glavine's earliest exit in a postseason start since 1992, when he was knocked out in the second inning by Pittsburgh.</p>
        <p>The game never got close thereafter, as Kile, the National League's only other 20-game winner this year, settled down and held the Braves to four hits in seven innings.</p>
        <p>Edmonds hit run-scoring doubles in the fifth and seventh to make the score 9-2, before Atlanta put up two runs in the eighth on a homer by Andruw Jones and a run-scoring single by Jordan. But McGwire had the last word with his rocket shot to center field in the eighth inning.</p>
        <p>So the Braves have two choices. Either they win Saturday, or their season will end.</p>
