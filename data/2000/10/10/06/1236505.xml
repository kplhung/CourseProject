        <p>Opening a Princeton University conference today on the Progressive Era, President Clinton likened his presidency to the far-reaching reforms enacted under Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson.</p>
        <p>The president's 45-minute talk also served as a vehicle to pitch his own brand of activist government to historians. Mr. Clinton compared his accomplishments in office to Roosevelt's and Wilson's efforts to reduce the power of entrenched special interests, strengthen the presidency and force an often reluctant nation to become engaged with the world. And while he included Theodore Roosevelt, a Republican and one of his favorite presidents, in his speech, only Democrats were on his list of progressive presidents who had succeeded Roosevelt.</p>

        <p>Opening a Princeton University conference today on the Progressive Era, President Clinton likened his presidency to the far-reaching reforms enacted under Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson.</p>
        <p>The president's 45-minute talk also served as a vehicle to pitch his own brand of activist government to historians. Mr. Clinton compared his accomplishments in office to Roosevelt's and Wilson's efforts to reduce the power of entrenched special interests, strengthen the presidency and force an often reluctant nation to become engaged with the world. And while he included Theodore Roosevelt, a Republican and one of his favorite presidents, in his speech, only Democrats were on his list of progressive presidents who had succeeded Roosevelt.</p>
        <p>''History has taught Americans not to stand passively by in the face of change,'' Mr. Clinton told a friendly crowd of students and campus luminaries in a turn-of-the-century lecture hall. ''What the progressive presidents understood so clearly, from Teddy Roosevelt to Wilson to F.D.R. and Truman, Kennedy and Johnson, is the understanding that America will either shape change or be shaped by it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton made it plain that the previous two Republican presidents, Ronald Reagan and George Bush, were specifically excluded from this tradition.</p>
        <p>''When I ran for president in 1992, the government was discredited,'' Mr. Clinton said. ''In fact, you could hardly run for president unless you had something bad to say about the government.</p>
        <p>''Indeed, part of the political genius of President Reagan and his associates was to obtain power by discrediting the very idea of government. They were able to say things like: 'The government cannot run a bake sale. The government would mess up a two-car parade.' And they found a huge majority of Americans nodding their heads.''</p>
        <p>But the president also criticized liberals who had helped the conservatives ''by clinging to old programs and old bureaucracies and approaches that no longer worked.'' And, he went on, ''conservatives used these failures as an excuse to do nothing on the domestic front.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton said he and Vice President Al Gore had found a ''third way'' to restore confidence in progressivism. With the challenges of record deficits and mounting national debt now behind the country, Mr. Clinton said, the country's next test will be to expand opportunity for people like the Navajo girl he met last week in New Mexico, who had won a computer but had no phone line; conquer diseases like AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis overseas; and bring the same success America has in business to the problems of families.</p>
        <p>''We're the best country in the world at keeping the hassles of starting a business down, providing capital to start with, providing an environment where people can flourish,'' the president said.</p>
        <p>''But we lag way behind a lot of other nations in the progressive traditions in simply saying that the most important work in this society is raising children, and that working will be more productive when people who are working and who have kids don't have to worry about the welfare of their children.''</p>
        <p>The United States must also resolve its ambivalence about international involvement, Mr. Clinton concluded. On the one hand, he said, Congress was willing to enact the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1993 and grant permanent normal trading status to China last month. On the other hand, last October, the Senate defeated the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which would have restricted nuclear weapons testing worldwide. Mr. Clinton called that vote ''breathtaking'' and ''horribly shortsighted.''</p>
        <p>It was, Mr. Clinton said, the first major treaty to be defeated since the Senate voted against United States membership in the League of Nations in 1920.</p>
