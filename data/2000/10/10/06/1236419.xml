        <p>A selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy opera, classical music and dance events this weekend in the Northeast.</p>
        <p>Opera</p>
        <p>''DON GIOVANNI.'' The Met's production of Mozart's ''Don Giovanni'' has been spruced up, restaged and admirably cast. Bryn Terfel makes the title role particularly sinister but he sings like an angel. Likewise Renee Fleming as Donna Anna. James Levine conducts with his customary effect. Not to be missed if you can manage to get a ticket. Metropolitan Opera House.

        <p>A selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy opera, classical music and dance events this weekend in the Northeast.</p>
        <p>Opera</p>
        <p>''DON GIOVANNI.'' The Met's production of Mozart's ''Don Giovanni'' has been spruced up, restaged and admirably cast. Bryn Terfel makes the title role particularly sinister but he sings like an angel. Likewise Renee Fleming as Donna Anna. James Levine conducts with his customary effect.

        <p>''LUCIA DI LAMMERMOOR.'' Amato Opera's new season opened last month and, sadly, for the first time in nearly 50 years the fans of this family-run opera company were not greeted in the theater lobby by the co-founder Sally Amato, who died in August at 82. But the company, still run by Ms. Amato's husband, Anthony, goes on. Its first offering is a revival of its production of Donizetti's ''Lucia di Lammermoor,'' with performances tonight, tomorrow night and Sunday afternoon. Mr. Amato conducts. Amato Opera Theater, 319 Bowery, at Second Street, East Village; tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30 and Sunday at 2:30 p.m. Tickets: $25; $20 for the elderly and children under 12; information and reservations, (212) 228-8200 (Anthony Tommasini).</p>
        <p>''MADAMA BUTTERFLY,'' New York City Opera. Mark Lamos's production of Puccini's  great work, introduced at the Glimmerglass Opera in 1997 and at the City Opera the next year, holds up well, offering a clean canvas for the compelling lighting design of Robert Wierzel. The performance mostly does justice to the production, with Andrew Richards a strong Pinkerton and Jake Gardner a worthy foil as Sharpless. The whole thing may be even better by now if Susan Bullock, effective in her middle range in the title role, has toned down the shrillness of her high notes on opening night, and Jorge Mester, the conductor, has arrived at a considerate balance for the singers. Tonight at 8, New York State Theater.  Tickets: $25 to $98; (212) 870-5570. (James R. Oestreich).</p>
        <p>''ROBERTO DEVEREUX.'' Donizetti's rip-roarer through English history is a vehicle for its Queen Elizabeth. Lauren Flanigan works assiduously to wrap her considerable talents around the part, with mixed success. The cast is otherwise competent, though not always wisely matched to the roles. But ''Roberto Devereux'' is not that often put on. Mark Lamos's production is worth a listen and a look for bel canto fans. New York City Opera. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., New York State Theater.  Tickets: $25 to $98; (212) 870-5570 (Holland).</p>
        <p>''SAMSON ET DALILA.'' Placido Domingo is the main draw of the Metropolitan Opera revival of its 1998 production of Saint-Saens's ''Samson et Dalila.'' Mr. Domingo, who is approaching 60, is singing better than opera buffs have any right to expect. His sound retains its poignant timbre and charisma. And he takes the high notes fearlessly. The mezzo-soprano Denyce Graves, one of the most lovely Dalilas ever, sings with dusky, rich tone and affecting expressivity, though on opening night her work was somewhat tentative. The production offers hanging scrims brush-stroked with lurid shades of red, orange and black, not to mention a stage full of gyrating, scantily clad men and women in the bacchanal scene. But the theatrics do not compensate for the long stretches of tepid music in this flawed score. Mark Elder conducts. Metropolitan Opera House, Saturday night at 8. Tickets: $26 to $180; (212) 362-6000 (Tommasini).</p>
        <p>''TOSCA.'' The scrappy Dicapo Opera Theater, which opens its season this weekend with Puccini's ''Tosca,'' usually performs in a wonderfully intimate theater on the lower level of the Church of St. Jean Baptiste at Lexington Avenue and 76th Street. But the director, Michael Capasso, has had the interesting idea to move upstairs to the sanctuary for the opera's first act, which is set in the Church of Sant'Andrea della Valle. Acts II and III will be performed downstairs in the theater. With this performance, in the original Italian, the company will also inaugurate its Dicapo titles system, designed especially for the space. Michael Recchiuti conducts. Allison Charney and Susan Foster alternate in the title role. Dicapo Opera Theater, 184 East 76th Street, Manhattan; tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday at 4 p.m. Tickets: $40; (212) 288-9438  (Tommasini).</p>
        <p>''LA TRAVIATA,'' New York City Opera. Here is something increasingly rare at the City Opera: a work from the center of the repertory in a fully conventional production, this one, tackling Verdi's opera, by Renata Scotto. The sets, offering a certain Zeffirellian sumptuousness on a small scale, require singers with a strong stage presence, and Mary Dunleavy, in the title role, certainly fills the bill  with a lovely voice put at the service of an all-around dramatic intensity. Stephen Powell, as Giorgio Germont, stood up to her on opening night; Bruce Fowler, as Alfredo, fared less well in a colorless performance. Joseph Rescigno conducted loosely. Sunday at 1:30 p.m., New York State Theater. Tickets: $25 to $98;  (212) 870-5570 (Oestreich).</p>
        <p>''TURN OF THE SCREW.'' Mark Lamos's psychologically astute production of this Britten classic -- a setting of the Henry James story -- is back at the New York City Opera and is worth catching. The cast includes Amy Burton as the Governess, Maire O'Brien as Miss Jessel, Eugenie Grunewald as Mrs. Grose, Sandra Joseph as Flora, Jacob Ashforth as Miles and Jeffrey Lentz as the Prologue and Quint. Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., the New York State Theater. Tickets: $25 to $98; (212) 870-5570 (Allan Kozinn).</p>
        <p>Classical Music</p>
        <p>BARGEMUSIC. Most of the time, Romanticism reigns at this floating concert hall on the East River, but periodically the musicians turn their eyes to older and newer music. Bach has been well served there: his ''Art of Fugue'' and ''Brandenburg'' Concertos are regularly scheduled, and the program tonight and on Sunday afternoon is devoted fully to the ''Goldberg'' Variations, played by William Wolfram, a pianist with a brilliant technique and fine interpretive instincts. Between the two ''Goldberg'' performances is a contemporary program with Milton Babbitt's ''Composition for Four Instruments'' and two works by John Zorn, ''Amour Fou'' and ''Le Momo.'' The musicians are Stephen Drury, pianist; Jennifer Choi, violinist; and Erik Friedlander and Fred Sherry, cellists. Paul Zukofsky is conducting the Babbitt. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30 and Sunday at 4 p.m. Bargemusic, Fulton Ferry Landing, Brooklyn. Tickets, $27; $25 for the elderly; $15 for students;  (718) 624-4061 or 624-2083 (Kozinn).</p>
        <p>CHANTICLEER. The lively male singing group offers a program with Spanish motets and Italian madrigals from the Renaissance period, Cuban folk music, gospel and new pieces written for the group. Temple of Dendur, Metropolitan Museum of Art, tonight at 7.  Tickets: $50; (212) 570-3949 (Paul Griffiths).</p>
        <p>EL CIMARRON. Scenes from the diary of a runaway Cuban slave, as set to music by Hans Werner Henze, will be performed by the baritone Gregory Rahming with three instrumentalist colleagues. Mr. Henze will be there to discuss his vivid score, which he composed three decades ago, at the height of his admiration for the Cuban revolution. Weill Hall, tomorrow night at 8. Tickets: $26; (212) 247-7800 (Griffiths).</p>
        <p>DEBUSSY AND RAVEL IN FIN-DE-SIECLE PARIS. Here is a remnant of what used to be a series tied to exhibitions at the museum. In connection with ''Painters in Paris, 1895-1950,'' the Sequoia String Quartet plays the quartets of Debussy and Ravel, a lone one each. A panel discussion is also included, with Robert Martin, the cellist of the quartet; Leon Botstein, the conductor; and others. Tomorrow at 7 p.m., Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street. Tickets: $30; (212) 570-3949 (Oestreich).</p>
        <p>IAN FOUNTAIN. To open a new concert series called ''Young Europe,'' the 92nd Street Y is presenting Ian Fountain, an English pianist who won the Arthur Rubinstein International Piano Competition in 1989, when he was 19. He is offering a hefty program that includes the Mendelssohn ''Variations Serieuses,'' Schoenberg's ''Drei Klavierstuke,'' Beethoven's Sonata No. 30 (Op. 109), Rachmaninoff's Sonata No. 2 and the ''Evocation'' from Albeniz's ''Iberia.'' Tomorrow at 8 p.m., the 92nd Street Y, 1395 Lexington Avenue. Tickets: $20;  (212) 996-1000 (Kozinn).</p>
        <p>''MET CHAMBER ENSEMBLE.'' One of James Levine's best ideas was to present the superb players of the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra in chamber concerts. The musicians relish the chance to play chamber music with one another in the intimate Weill Recital Hall, and their involvement is palpable in their performances. The well-conceived programs are challenging for players and audiences alike. This Sunday afternoon the players, with Mr. Levine conducting, offer Strauss's ''Metamorphosen'' for 23 individual strings, Schoenberg's Serenade, and the suite from Stravinsky's ''Histoire du Soldat.'' Weill Recital Hall, Sunday at 5 p.m. Tickets: $81; sold out, but returns may be available. CarnegieCharge: (212) 247-7800 (Tommasini).</p>
        <p>NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC. To conclude a welcome three-week festival of music by Mendelssohn, Kurt Masur leads the orchestra and the American Boychoir in the most distinctive entry: the wonderful early oratorio ''St. Paul,'' also with the Westminster Symphonic Choir and vocal soloists including Christopher Maltman, in the title role, and Stuart Neill. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Avery Fisher Hall, (212) 721-6500. Remaining tickets: $40 to $86. Mr. Masur is also to take part in a Mendelssohn symposium today: a reading of orchestral works with the Manhattan School of Music Symphony at 10 a.m. and a panel discussion at 2 p.m. Manhattan School of Music, Broadway at 122nd Street, Morningside Heights. Tickets: free but required and available only at the Avery Fisher Hall box office; (212) 875-5656 (Oestreich).</p>
        <p>ORPHEUS CHAMBER ORCHESTRA. Orpheus was formed 27 years ago with the idea of performing as a kind of player's collective, without the authoritarian hand of a conductor. It has succeeded admirably, largely because its players are among the best New York freelancers, but also because these musicians have developed a working method that is essentially democratic but doesn't preclude a cohesive interpretive vision for each of the works it plays. Its first concert of the season includes Stravinsky's ''Apollon Musagete''; Richard Strauss's Duet Concertino for clarinet, bassoon and orchestra; Aaron Copland's ''Midday Thoughts'' in an arrangement by David Del Tredici; and the Beethoven Symphony No. 8. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall. Tickets: $19 to $79; (212) 247-7800 (Kozinn).</p>
        <p>VIRGIL FOX MEMORIAL RECITAL. Virgil Fox, a flamboyant organ virtuoso who died almost 20 years ago, carried the instrument from its traditional precincts into clubs like the Fillmore East in the 1970's, much to the chagrin of purists. From 1946 to 1965, he was the organist at the eminently respectable Riverside Church, where nine organists, including Frederick Swann, a successor of Fox's there, now convene to celebrate his memory. Michael Barone, of the syndicated radio program ''Pipe Dreams,'' will be the host. Sunday at 4 p.m., Riverside Church, Riverside Drive at 122nd Street, Morningside Heights.  Tickets: $20 to $100; (212) 239-6200 (Oestreich).</p>
        <p>Dance</p>
        <p>EUN ME AHN DANCE. A wacky avant-gardist with a terrific sense of visuals and theater, Eun Me Ahn will present her new male solo, ''Period II, Dying Swan'' on a program that also features a premiere by Mark Haim. Tonight through Sunday at 8 p.m. Tickets: $20; $12 for students and the elderly. Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street; (212) 334-7479 (Jennifer Dunning).</p>
        <p>D. CHASE ANGIER. Formerly with the company of Senta Driver, D. Chase Angier will present ''An Evening of Beauty and Madness,'' which includes her ''Lemons for Loveliness,'' an examination of our culture's standards of beauty. Tomorrow (and Oct. 21) at 8 p.m. Tickets: $12 with reservation; $15 at door. Williamsburg Art Nexus, 205 North Seventh Street, Brooklyn; (718) 599-7997 (Dunning).</p>
        <p>EMERGENCY FUND FOR STUDENT DANCERS. Professional and student performers will dance works by Alvin Ailey, Merce Cunningham, Arthur Aviles and choreographers associated with Dance Theater of Harlem and the companies of Martha Graham and Jose Limon. The object is to raise money to benefit the students of the Martha Graham School, who were left without a place to study when the Graham company suspended operations. Foreign students, in particular, were left in the lurch. Every dollar raised at the box office will be matched by the fund, to go toward tuition fees for Graham students who cannot afford to enroll in another school. Tonight at 9; tomorrow at 8 p.m. Tickets: $15; $25 for reserved seats. Merce Cunningham Studio, 55 Bethune Street, SoHo; (212) 924-0077 (Dunning).</p>
        <p>FULL CIRCLE HIP-HOP DANCE COMPANY. Kwikstep and Rocafella, directors of the Full Circle Hip-Hop Dance Company, celebrate hip-hop life and culture in ''Soular Powered.'' Tonight and tomorrow at 8 p.m. Tickets: $10. Live from the Edge Theater, The Point, 940 Garrison Avenue, at Manida Street, Hunts Point, the Bronx; (718) 542-4139 (Dunning).</p>
        <p>JOYCE S. LIM AND NAMI YAMAMOTO. Cultures collide in ''Wan Dollah?'' as Asian dancers investigate concepts of sameness and difference in a production that makes playful use of both language and movement. Tonight at 8. Tickets: $15; $10 for students and the elderly. Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077 (Jack Anderson).</p>
        <p>JENNIFER MONSON. The downtown dance choreographer and performer Jennifer Monson has an inscrutable, inward-looking quality that immediately draws the eye, as her mind ticks on through a variety of odd but intriguing assignments. This time she explores the links between intuition and technology in ''The Pigeon Project,'' a sequel to an investigation of the migratory paths of birds and whales that she called ''Bird Brain.'' Tonight through Sunday and Wednesday through Oct. 15 at 8:30 p.m. Tickets: $15. Performance Space 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village; (212) 477-5288 (Dunning).</p>
        <p>JEREMY NELSON AND LUIS LARA. In a program of two related works, ''Pain-stake'' and ''Flats,'' two choreographers dive into the information pool created by the sophistication of today's communications systems. Tonight, Saturday and Sunday at 8:30 p.m. Tickets: $12. St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street at Second Avenue, East Village, (212) 674-8194 (Anderson).</p>
        <p>JODY OBERFELDER. Six dancers perform heroic feats in acrobatic physical exchanges in ''Slay the Dragon,'' a full-evening piece, set to music by John Zorn, that addresses triumphing over adversity. Tonight and tomorrow at 8. Tickets: $20; rush tickets, students and the elderly, $15. Flea Theater, 41 White Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 226-2407 (Dunning).</p>
        <p>SPLIT STREAM: HOPE CLARK, YASUKO YOKOSHI, GONNIE HEGGEN. A shared program features works on spiritual themes by Ms. Clark and a collaboratively choreographed fantasy in which Ms. Yokoshi and Ms. Heggen take comic peeks into the Royal and Imperial courts of Europe and Asia. Saturday at 8 p.m. and Sunday at 3 p.m. Tickets: $15; $10 for students and the elderly. Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077 (Anderson).</p>
