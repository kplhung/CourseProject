        <p>Alarmed by four consecutive months of rising inflation, South Korea's central bank raised interest rates today, breaking with a government policy of keeping the cost of borrowing low to help troubled businesses reduce their debts.</p>
        <p>It was the first time in eight months that the central bank raised rates and it illustrated the quandary confronting South Korean economic policy makers: higher rates could help suppress inflation but could also cause growth to slow and hurt the ability of the nation's highly indebted conglomerates like Daewoo and Hyundai to pay off billions in loans.</p>

        <p>Alarmed by four consecutive months of rising inflation, South Korea's central bank raised interest rates today, breaking with a government policy of keeping the cost of borrowing low to help troubled businesses reduce their debts.</p>
        <p>It was the first time in eight months that the central bank raised rates and it illustrated the quandary confronting South Korean economic policy makers: higher rates could help suppress inflation but could also cause growth to slow and hurt the ability of the nation's highly indebted conglomerates like Daewoo and Hyundai to pay off billions in loans.</p>
        <p>The central bank raised a benchmark rate known as the call rate, or the interest on one-day loans among financial institutions, from 5 percent to 5.25 percent.</p>
        <p>With outside influences like surging oil prices driving up consumer prices, which have risen for four consecutive months, the central bank decided that addressing inflationary concerns was more urgent than speeding up the overhaul of banks and business conglomerates.</p>
        <p>''Concerns over rising prices have become more realistic,'' said Chon Chol Hwan, the governor of the Bank of Korea. ''If the central bank decided not to raise the rate, it would have created more uncertainty in the market.''</p>
        <p>Investors seemed to favor the action, viewing it as a sign of fiscal responsibility. The Korea Composite Stock Price Index, a barometer of the nation's economic mood, gained 1.4 percent after having strengthened as much as 3 percent following the news.</p>
        <p>The rate increase followed news that the nation's consumer price index had risen a higher-than-expected 1.5 percent in September from the previous month. It was the largest monthly jump since February 1998, when the index rose 1.7 percent. Inflation rose to 1.5 percent in September from 0.8 percent in August and 0.3 percent in July.</p>
        <p>H. Jin Lee, a bank industry analyst at the Samsung Economic Research Institute, said the quarter-point rate increase was manageable.</p>
        <p>As its own measure to quell market jitters, the government announced earlier that it would accelerate corporate changes by setting up guidelines for near-failing businesses. The government watchdog agency, the Financial Supervisory Service, said such companies would be liquidated, easing fears of further potential losses in the banking sector from troubled corporations.</p>
        <p>The government said recently that it would have to spend another 50 trillion won, or about $44 billion, in taxpayer money to support troubled banks after a much-publicized sale of the Daewoo Motor Company to the Ford Motor Company fell through last month. With the additional money, the government will have spent a total of 149.3 trillion won, about $131.3 billion, in cleaning up banks in the last three years.</p>
        <p>Ford's withdrawal from the Daewoo Motor deal was viewed as a vote of no confidence and made it much more difficult for banks and other lenders to reduce their exposure to the ailing carmaker.</p>
