        <p>Peter Hujar stamped his photographs with an uncommon sensibility that has not shown up often or consistently in photography. It was a sensibility both emotionally removed and tender, respectful of the compromised dignity of the least of his acquaintances, a trifle solemn, alert to signs of death and ruin, and constantly mindful of the delicate sorrows of the human condition.</p>
        <p>He died in 1987 at the age of 53, one year after the first show that covered the range of his work. He had been a fashion photographer in the 1950's and 1960's, then gave it up to pursue his art. Naturally he ended up poor and little known except to friends, photographers (many of whom he influenced) and a small group of staunch admirers. He deserved more than the crumbs from fame's table.</p>

        <p>Peter Hujar stamped his photographs with an uncommon sensibility that has not shown up often or consistently in photography. It was a sensibility both emotionally removed and tender, respectful of the compromised dignity of the least of his acquaintances, a trifle solemn, alert to signs of death and ruin, and constantly mindful of the delicate sorrows of the human condition.</p>
        <p>He died in 1987 at the age of 53, one year after the first show that covered the range of his work. He had been a fashion photographer in the 1950's and 1960's, then gave it up to pursue his art. Naturally he ended up poor and little known except to friends, photographers (many of whom he influenced) and a small group of staunch admirers. He deserved more than the crumbs from fame's table.</p>
        <p>A wider renown came to Hujar after he died, curious enough for a man whose work was so conscious of the end of things. In the 1960's he took pictures of the catacombs in Palermo, Sicily, where skeletons with sad faces or terrified skulls were fully dressed in garments and gloves. Later he paid homage to ruin and decay mostly via inanimate things, but mortality still haunted his pictures of the living, hovering just outside the frame.</p>
        <p>''Peter Hujar: Photographs, 1980 to 1987'' at the Matthew Marks Gallery in Chelsea is a show of 98 photographs from Hujar's estate, some never shown before. The gallery says that in most cases Hujar made only two or three prints and according to his wishes no posthumous prints will be produced. The prints, on a particularly warm paper that is no longer made, are quite beautiful.</p>
        <p>One would not use that adjective for the images, which are powerful and quietly, deeply disturbing, full of pain but resolutely refusing to dramatize it, now and again touching, now and again amusing in an elegiac sort of way. They are portraits of friends, some nude, some in costume, some engaged in odd enterprises like biting into a strawberry with excessive care or posing naked with a boa constrictor. They are portraits -- they cannot be called anything else -- of animals. They are images of destruction: collapsed houses, the flayed carcasses of slain cows, a dead dog on a heap of trash. They are intense and reticent at the same time. They are memorable.</p>
        <p>In the 1950's, when he was in his early 20's, Hujar took photographs of retarded and handicapped children; they were not published until 1998. These preceded Diane Arbus's and Richard Avedon's images in similar hospitals by years and seem to have set a tone for his later work. His  mature imagery deals at least peripherally, subliminally, with the large and small ploys that human beings devise to keep afloat under the rain of damage that life spreads around so liberally.</p>
        <p>He grew up in a time when the love that dared not speak its name kept mum; when camp, not yet having been defined, was considered a low-life taste; when cross-dressers stayed in the closet or under cover and female impersonators did not dream that uptown financiers would consider it hip to come downtown and watch them perform. And he lived into a time when all that changed.</p>
        <p>He was part of a camp entourage of performers, artists and writers in the 1970's and he photographed it from inside, not as if he were a tabloid reporter getting the scoop on bohemia but more like a philosopher in closed quarters contemplating the way things were, with a sense that if they were seen clearly enough, maybe even he might understand.</p>
        <p>How large and serious the life in these pictures is. The atmosphere is not morbid exactly, for bravado breaks through, and dignity and at least in a couple of the dogs, nobility. A tenderness comes across, hard to define in the midst of Hujar's strictly controlled dispassion, but there nonetheless, expressed mostly as an acceptance of inherent human frailty and an unwillingness to take advantage of those who trust enough to let their vulnerabilities slip out.</p>
        <p>Still, these pictures come trailing melancholy, the melancholy of being alive in the face of eventual death. Beneath the disguises is the body, heir to mortal ills, ineffectively protected by the taffeta dresses and high heels that either gender can put on for display. Everyone is alone, isolated, without the support of backdrops or props other than costumes, plus an occasional snake. Some make direct contact with the camera, but most are off in an interior world that no one will ever quite penetrate.</p>
        <p>Even John Heys in Lana Turner's gown, dressed for a role he is not playing, forgoing the pleasure of vamping in favor of solemn concentration, looks not so much at us as inward. And when, naked and daintily holding out a shawl while assuming the pose of a slightly awkward ballerina, he stares at the camera with the look of a man thinking hard about something deep, he seems impervious to the moment, his body performing while his mind roams abroad.</p>
        <p>And what is Jerry Rothlein doing, naked in a chair with his robe about his feet, puffing out his torso on display, raising his elbows to shoulder height and dangling his hands down before his armpits? What is he thinking, gazing off to the side, doubtless at nothing in particular unless it's an idea hanging out there in the air, his face all the while manifesting a sweet, vague self-satisfaction? And what about the fellow with one boot on and one off who bends down and studiously touches his bare foot as if he were doing something far too portentous to allow him to bother with the photographer or the camera?</p>
        <p>Hujar photographed transvestites, female impersonators and transsexuals late in Diane Arbus's career and early in Nan Goldin's. Like Arbus, he photographed in black-and-white, in a square format and a basically old-fashioned style, the subjects usually alone and centered in the frame. Unlike Arbus, he did not think his sitters any more peculiar than the rest of the world and made no efforts to make them seem so. He respected their dilemma, which was, in effect, the human condition.</p>
        <p>Unlike Goldin, Hujar worked neither in color nor as a snapshooter but slowly and contemplatively, as if every picture were a meditation, and he did not chronicle the lurching progress of the days or the knots and tangles of relationships except as those things were incorporated into personality.</p>
        <p>If his languorous naked men and occasional masturbators were outre in subject (but not style) when they were taken, Robert Mapplethorpe soon made them look tame. Today Hujar's most startling image is of Jackie Curtis, the female impersonator, almost unrecognizable in his coffin in a man's suit and haircut but without lipstick or eye makeup. Almost no one knew him that way.</p>
        <p>The animal portraits are quite simply wonderful. The dogs have personalities as individual as any of the human beings: a calm and regal Great Dane, a fluffy lap dog as convinced of its own glamour as any starlet in a bikini, a Shar-Pei both distinguished and a tad disdainful. Horses and cows perk up their ears and thrust their faces close, quizzing us as if to say: ''You're an unusual creature. Just who are you, and why, exactly, are we here together?''</p>
        <p>For about half the show at Matthew Marks, the gallery used Hujar's notes and a checklist to recreate the photographer's 1986 exhibition as he laid it out himself, the pictures hung two deep, with his own choices of what was above and next to each photograph along the wall. The result is a mournful blend of youth and death, trash and glamour, sex and ruin. The dead Jackie Curtis lies beneath leafless trees and next to the performance artist Ethyl Eichelberger in dangerously high heels, exaggerated eye makeup and a ton of bracelets.</p>
        <p>A photograph of a ''Communion Cloth in Ruins,'' stained and hanging on a devastated wall, is placed above a mental outpatient who is also ruined; next to these is a self-portrait of Hujar above the severed head of a cow.</p>
        <p>Everything ends: animals, cloth, trees, people. In the meantime, and until then, everything perseveres, whatever is alive looking for safety and pleasure and comfort, the people among them maybe even looking for beauty, seeking answers, and thinking of now in order to stave off then.</p>
        <p>''Peter Hujar: Photographs, 1980 to 1987'' is at the Matthew Marks Gallery, 523 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 243-0200, through Oct. 28.</p>
