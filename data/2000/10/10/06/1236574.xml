        <p>Edward Thorp  210 11th Avenue, near 24th Street, Chelsea  Through Oct. 14</p>
        <p>April Gornik continues to combine 19th-century Transcendentalism and 20th-century Modernism in the production of expansive, dreamlike landscapes. Ms. Gornik paints in a simplifying, almost primitive way, giving her canvases a flattened immediacy that marks them as modern. At the same time, archetypal, often symmetrical images of unpeopled nature evoke the pantheistic mysticism of Emerson or the Luminist vision of Martin Johnson Heade.</p>

        <p>Edward Thorp  210 11th Avenue, near 24th Street, Chelsea  Through Oct. 14</p>
        <p>April Gornik continues to combine 19th-century Transcendentalism and 20th-century Modernism in the production of expansive, dreamlike landscapes. Ms. Gornik paints in a simplifying, almost primitive way, giving her canvases a flattened immediacy that marks them as modern. At the same time, archetypal, often symmetrical images of unpeopled nature evoke the pantheistic mysticism of Emerson or the Luminist vision of Martin Johnson Heade.</p>
        <p>At best modernist optical intensity goes hand in hand with divine immanence, as in ''Mirror Forest,'' in which greenish sunlight pours meltingly through a grove of young trees, the parallel trunks of which spread out evenly across the eight-foot-wide canvas. Other pictures lack such radiance but still project moods of lonesome euphoria. In ''The Wave'' a distant burst of foam on the seam between Color Field-like stretches of blue sky and aqua green water is like an oracular sign to the solitary wanderer. In ''Cloud Lake'' a heavy gray cloud is mirrored in dark, tree-rimmed water below, reflecting, perhaps, the viewer's own spiritual division between surface and depth.</p>
        <p>Not all Ms. Gornik's pictures are equally captivating. ''Underwater'' looks like a scuba diving photograph from a travel magazine, and her charcoal drawings are thin. Nevertheless, this show as a whole casts a soulful spell.</p>
