        <p>''Cyberworld'' offers 55 minutes of unabashed, and often quite diverting, technological overkill. It combines the skull-rattling, eyeball-straining gigantism of the Imax format with the latest in computer animation: 3-D computer animation. With its vertiginous free falls and swoops, and all manner of creatures popping up right in front of your face, it's as much a theme park thrill ride as a showcase for the latest technical ingenuity.</p>
        <p>The ride begins with a sprint through the neon maze of a computer processor. This may remind you of an Intel commercial from a few years back, and with good reason: that chip maker helped to produce this extravaganza. Soon you find yourself in a cavernous space that resembles a giant pinball machine -- the Galleria Animatica -- where you are greeted by an animated purple-clad supermodel named Phig, with the voice of Jenna Elfman.</p>

        <p>''Cyberworld'' offers 55 minutes of unabashed, and often quite diverting, technological overkill. It combines the skull-rattling, eyeball-straining gigantism of the Imax format with the latest in computer animation: 3-D computer animation. With its vertiginous free falls and swoops, and all manner of creatures popping up right in front of your face, it's as much a theme park thrill ride as a showcase for the latest technical ingenuity.</p>
        <p>The ride begins with a sprint through the neon maze of a computer processor. This may remind you of an Intel commercial from a few years back, and with good reason: that chip maker helped to produce this extravaganza. Soon you find yourself in a cavernous space that resembles a giant pinball machine -- the Galleria Animatica -- where you are greeted by an animated purple-clad supermodel named Phig, with the voice of Jenna Elfman.</p>
        <p>To the extent that ''Cyberworld,'' which opens today at the Sony Imax Theater Lincoln Square, has a plot, it involves Phig's battles with three cartoon bugs who are eating their way through the Galleria's code, causing all manner of havoc. (The code strings are represented by interlocking towers of flashing numbers, which topple like dominoes.) The movie's real purpose, though, is to provide a showcase of 3-D animation from various nations and companies, and it does provide a nice sampling of what teams of very smart people with big computers and a lot of money can do.</p>
        <p>For instance, Sony Pictures Imageworks can conjure a throbbing pink brain that lives in a torchlighted castle. Out of of the brain emerges some kind of dancing Brancusi sculpture-thing. (Forgive the technical jargon.) The Pet Shop Boys, the British pop group, in partnership with Eye Developments, summon a flock of flying golden heads, which undulate across the sky to the tune of the group's song ''Liberation.'' There are also some comical bugs who play basketball (thanks to Spans &amp; Partner) and dance (in an outtake from Dreamworks' ''Antz'').</p>
        <p>It's all very clever, and sometimes thrilling. The underwater world imagined by Ex Machina, a French company, is superior to Disney's ''Dinosaur.'' But the best part of ''Cyberworld'' comes at the end, when we find ourselves in a very familiar -- and two-dimensional -- pink living room belonging to America's most popular four-fingered cartoon family, the Simpsons.</p>
        <p>The episode in which Homer wanders out of the plane world of Springfield into a solid-geometry parallel universe was brilliant when it appeared on television several Halloweens ago. Viewed on an 80-foot screen with the aid of special goggles, it's mesmerizing.</p>
        <p>''This looks like a very expensive place,'' Homer says as cones and cubes zoom around him. ''I feel like I'm wasting a lot of money just standing here.'' Meanwhile Chief Wiggum, Flanders, Dr. Hibbert and the rest of the cast try to drag him back into flat old Springfield, which feels, amid the pyrotechnics of ''Cyberland,'' like home. ''Cyberland'' is full of fascinating ingenuity; ''The Simpsons'' is a work of genius.</p>
