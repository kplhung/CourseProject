        <p>An official inquiry into the infection of more than 200 Irish hemophiliacs with H.I.V. and hepatitis C has confirmed that the government's Blood Transfusion Service Board knowingly put them at risk throughout the early 1980's.</p>
        <p>According to testimony to a tribunal by former executives and medical experts in recent weeks, the organization sold infected blood products like clotting agents to Irish hospitals even when the pharmaceutical companies that made the products expressed serious concerns about whether they were safe to use.</p>
        <p>The emerging picture is one of an organization that suffered from severe mismanagement and eventually put the need to turn a profit ahead of the safety of patients.</p>
        <p>Facing a mountain of debt in the early 1980's, caused mostly by an expensive office relocation, the board repeatedly bought cheaper blood products from risky sources, the investigators reported. Such decisions contradicted warnings from the Council of Europe to avoid buying from companies that used paid donors, for example, and led to the infection of more than 200 hemophiliacs.</p>
        <p>Fifty-seven have since died of H.I.V.-related diseases and nine of hepatitis or complications resulting from it, the inquiry found.</p>
        <p>''I went in with a nosebleed, and I came out with hep-C,'' said John Berry, a 62-year-old hemophiliac, during his testimony in May, when the tribunal began its courtroom hearings with evidence from 30 victims and relatives. Mr. Berry's death of hepatitis-related liver cancer in September served as a stark reminder of the reasons for the inquiry.</p>
        <p>The most disturbing allegations that surfaced before the tribunal were that two former executives of the blood transfusion board accepted favors from pharmaceutical companies supplying the products used. Both men are now dead, making a full investigation impossible.</p>
        <p>Jack O'Riordan, the director of the Blood Transfusion Service Board until 1985, initially took a very cautious approach to imported blood products. According to lawyers for the hemophiliacs, he changed his position in 1974, when the board began buying clotting agents from Travenol, an American pharmaceutical company, despite concerns about the company's safety record.</p>
        <p>The board continued to buy Travenol clotting agents through the early 1980's, even when the company failed to implement widely accepted heat-treating procedures. Meanwhile, Travenol offered the board a 10 percent commission on sales to Irish hospitals, and sponsored Mr. O'Riordan on trips to international conferences.</p>
        <p>The Baxter Healthcare Corporation, which acquired Travenol in the late 1980's, does not accept liability for the infections, according to a spokeswoman, Patty O'Hayer. ''It's a travesty that no one understood the risk,'' she said. ''When you're in the business of saving people's lives, this is a nightmare scenario.''</p>
        <p>Aside from the allegations, testimony from the board's deputy medical director, Dr. Emer Lawlor, disclosed that 20 years' worth of official documents were destroyed by the board's chief technician, Sean Hanratty in 1993.</p>
        <p>Mr. O'Riordan left the blood board in 1985, and his successor, Ted Keyes, accepted a document indemnifying Armour Pharmaceuticals, another supplier of blood products, because the board insisted on selling profitable blood products that Armour wished to discontinue for safety reasons.</p>
        <p>When the first victims were identified, most were informed promptly, but many were not. There does not seem to have been any concerted effort to keep them ignorant of the risks found in the blood they were receiving, and the tribunal has not yet called doctors to testify about when and why their patients were finally fully informed.</p>
        <p>Once the initial damage was done, both the blood board and the Irish health care profession only seemed to aggravate the situation through their response, which has been criticized by the Irish Haemophilia Society as arrogant and insensitive. Blood tests for H.I.V. and hepatitis were implemented immediately, but still some infected victims were not told of their status for as long as several years after testing positive.</p>
        <p>And that crucial conversation, when it did happen, was sometimes far from comforting, the tribunal learned. One hemophiliac recalled being told that he had tested positive for hepatitis C in a hospital hallway, by a doctor who said simply, ''Yeah, you've got it.''</p>
        <p>At the hearings in May, most victims chose to testify anonymously.</p>
        <p>Hemophiliacs who had contracted H.I.V. received no counseling to help them face the social stigma attached to the disease. ''We discovered that it was like a plague, that people didn't want to know,'' said Brian O'Mahony, chairman of the Irish Haemophilia Society. ''They buried their heads in the sand.''</p>
