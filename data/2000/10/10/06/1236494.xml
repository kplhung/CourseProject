        <p>The Devils will open their National Hockey League season Friday with a great deal of excitement when their Stanley Cup championship banner is raised at Contintental Arena before their game against the Montreal Canadiens.</p>
        <p>But those good feelings will be somewhat muted because of the absence of two key players: Jason Arnott, who scored the deciding goal in the final game in June, and Scott Niedermayer, who led the Devils' defensemen in scoring the last five years.</p>
        <p>Both players are restricted free agents, and are still unsigned. Their contract standoffs with Lou Lamoriello, the Devils' president and general manager, could go on for a long time. But without Arnott's blistering shot from the point and without Niedermayer quarterbacking the power play with the skill and vision necessary to make a good team better, the Devils could face serious challenges.</p>
        <p>Lurking behind the concerns about the Devils' new season is a collective memory: the last time the Devils won the cup, in 1995, they failed to qualify for the playoffs in the following season.</p>
        <p>''We have to sacrifice and play hard,'' said Scott Stevens, the team captain and the most valuable player in the Stanley Cup playoffs. ''We can't be thinking we'll win automatically.''</p>
        <p>Martin Brodeur, the starting goalie and the team's franchise player, said the Devils cannot afford to be complacent and that no one wanted to experience another miserable season of missing the playoffs after winning the Stanley Cup.</p>
        <p>''I think we all have to understand that this is not going to be a cakewalk -- it'll be a tough challenge for everyone,'' Brodeur said.</p>
        <p>Even though every team is aiming for the defending champion, and even without Arnott, Niedermayer and Claude Lemieux -- whose contract requirements exceeded the team's still-modest budget -- the positives still overshadow the negatives in New Jersey. Stevens and Coach Larry Robinson have said that the Devils can replace the missing players.</p>
        <p>Patrik Elias, however, sounded a more cautious note. ''Only time will tell,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Stevens said that he had spoken with Arnott, but that Niedermayer did not return his calls. ''I am not going to speculate when they will be back,'' Stevens said. ''But it seems that it's been dragging on and they could be out for the whole year. The good thing is that we have the depth here to make up for it.''</p>
        <p>But no matter how much a number of their young players have improved, the Devils will not be the same without Arnott and Niedermayer. Without Arnott as the center of the team's primary line, it also means that Elias and Petr Sykora will most likely not be the same.</p>
        <p>''We want the team we had last year because we want to defend the cup,'' said Elias, who had his own contract squabbles with Lamoriello last year. ''You'd expect Arnie and Nieder to get a better treatment after what they've done for this team. It's just not fair. The good thing is we have some depth here, but only time will tell whether we can do just as well without them.''</p>
        <p>Robinson will use Sergei Nemchinov between Elias and Sykora on Friday night. Nemchinov has proven his efficiency as a two-way player for the last 10 years with all three teams in the New York area, but he lacks Arnott's physical presence and ferocious shot.</p>
        <p>Elias and Sykora are both from the Czech Republic, and they have developed a great rapport with Arnott. The threesome played unselfishly, which is rare for a top line.</p>
        <p>Sykora ended up in a Dallas hospital early in the last game of the Stanley Cup playoffs  after a hit by the Stars' Daren Hatcher, and it was Elias who won the puck in the right corner against the Dallas defense and passed to Arnott for the cup-clinching goal in sudden-death overtime to dethrone Dallas as champion.</p>
        <p>Defensively, Brodeur and Stevens are huge positives for the Devils. But without Arnott as the center for Elias and Sykora, the Devils' biggest threat offensively will be the line of Scott Gomez as the center for Alexander Mogilny and Sergei Bryin, two gifted Russians.</p>
        <p>''Our lines are all balanced,'' said Gomez, the league's rookie of the year last season.</p>
        <p>''Chino is a great player with skill and he'll do well between Patrik and Petr,'' Gomez said about Nemchinov. ''I think that without Arnie, we just have to pick it up a notch.''</p>
        <p>The presence of Robinson from the start of the season is another huge advantage for the Devils. Robinson, who ran a tight, no-nonsense training camp, has the respect and admiration of his players. Considered a players' coach, he knows the pulse of his team better than any coach in the history of the Devils.</p>
