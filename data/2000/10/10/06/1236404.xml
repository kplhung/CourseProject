        <p>When Frederico Spezia was a child, the men of Luis Alves traveled 20 miles over unpaved roads to buy the liquor that would warm their bellies at night. Necessity soon bred invention, though, and the first bootleg stills started dotting the secluded valley in the 1940's and 50's, brewing up a traditional liquor called cachaca (ka-SHA-sa).</p>
        <p>Soon this two-church town of about 5,000, nestled 30 miles from the sea in the southern state of Santa Catarina, was filled with the sickly sweet smell of boiling sugar.</p>
        <p>''There used to be more than a hundred stills in this area,'' said Mr. Spezia, who, despite his 73 years, has the ruddy complexion and thick, callused hands of someone who has spent a lifetime cutting sugar cane. ''But when the government came around requiring that everyone get documented and start paying taxes, it all turned into bananas'' -- which receive government incentives.</p>
        <p>Despite the crackdown, about 12 small-scale distilleries, including Mr. Spezia's, remain in Luis Alves, which, along with other towns like Piracicaba, is considered one of a handful of traditional homes of handmade Brazilian cachaca. But stiff competition in the local market, where a one-liter bottle of mass-produced cachaca sells for as little as a dollar, has forced the remaining producers in Luis Alves to search for markets overseas, where a bottle of the liquor can fetch upwards of $30. The big producers have more success exporting because of their scale, but the smaller ones have higher quality because their cachaca, which is similar to rum, is handmade.</p>
        <p>''Even with all of the import duties and shipping costs, it is still much better for us to sell abroad,'' said Almir Spezia, one of Mr. Spezia's sons, who has taken over financial management of the company. ''Brazilians don't want to know about quality. They're only interested in price.''</p>
        <p>Also called pinga, aguardente or agua que passarinho nao bebe (''water that the little birds won't drink''), cachaca is Brazil's favorite liquor. In bars here, it is usually served on ice, accompanied by crushed limes and a liberal amount of sugar, to make the traditional caipirinha.</p>
        <p>Thanks to increasing tourism, word of the caipirinha has leaked outside Brazil's borders, making it the second-most-requested alcoholic drink in Germany behind beer. In the United States, a handful of bars in New York, Miami and San Francisco are also starting to serve the caipirinha brasileira with imported cachaca.</p>
        <p>But despite growing interest abroad, exporting has not proved to be a simple matter. About 1.3 billion liters of cachaca were bottled in Brazil last year by more than 5,000 producers, but only one-third of 1 percent of those bottles, or $7.4 million worth, made it across the border. That is bad news for smaller producers, because their prices are undercut at home by large producers.</p>
        <p>''The biggest problem with the cachaca industry is that it is fragmented and a lot of producers are still informal,'' said Maria das Vitorias Cavalcanti, president of the board of the Brazilian Development Program for Cachaca at the Brazilian Association of Beverages, a private group known as Abrabe. ''To position cachaca in the international market, we need to reposition it inside Brazil by formalizing the sector and investing in the image of the product.''</p>
        <p>Following the lead of Mexico, which has succeeded in raising the international profile of tequila significantly over recent years, Abrabe is investing $4 million over the next three years to help organize the industry. The association is also focused on bringing local cachaca distillers to international beverage fairs to promote their products. Through its program, Abrabe aims to increase cachaca exports about 30 percent a year, to $100 million over the next 10 years.</p>
        <p>They have already had some success. So far this year, cachaca exports, while still small, have more than doubled, largely as a result of efforts by a handful of the country's largest producers. For the small-scale distillers, though, like those in Luis Alves, exports are still elusive.</p>
        <p>''For the last four years, we have been trying to export, but we always run into problems,'' said Ademilda Bompani, the matriarch of Bompani Ltd., which bottles and sells cachaca for a variety of producers in the region. ''The paperwork is overwhelming, and the government doesn't really help us.''</p>
        <p>To meet quality standards in the international market, many local distillers must take on the additional cost of completely revamping their production processes.</p>
        <p>''My father cobbled our factory together room by room over the past 50 years,'' said Almir Spezia, who hopes to export his first shipment to Europe in October. ''It didn't make sense to try to bring it up to international standards, so I left it for my father to make his cachaca for the locals, and wound up building another one down the road.''</p>
