        <p>With the New York City Marathon just a month away, organizers announced yesterday that two of the race's most storied competitors will give it another try.</p>
        <p>German Silva of Mexico and John Kagwe of Kenya, both two-time winners, will join about 30,000 other runners on Nov. 5 for the 31st running of the race.</p>
        <p>They were joined yesterday by Khalid Khannouchi, the world record-holder, for the dedication of the Fred Lebow Room at the Ronald McDonald House at 73rd Street near York Avenue.</p>
        <p>Khannouchi, who gained American citizenship in May and lives in Ossining, N.Y., will try to win his third Chicago Marathon on Oct. 22. For the next few weeks he will train with Silva.</p>
        <p>Silva ran his way into New York marathon folklore when he won in 1994 after overcoming a wrong turn with a quarter of a mile to go. Kagwe made his mark in 1997 when he won despite stopping several times to tie his shoelaces. He took some time off this year after a car accident in May.</p>
        <p>Grete Waitz, a nine-time New York winner, and Allan Steinfeld, the race director, cut the ribbon at the new room of the Ronald McDonald House, which houses children with cancer while they undergo treatment. Lebow, who directed the marathon and the New York Road Runners Club, died of brain cancer in 1994.</p>
