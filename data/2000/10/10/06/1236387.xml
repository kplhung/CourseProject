        <p>AT 16, boys are fascinated by a lot of things. Cars, for instance, and the birds and the bees. We had the cars and went in search of a bee -- specifically, an 800-pound fiberglass likeness described as the ''world's largest bee'' in an off-the-wall travel guide.</p>
        <p>A rather pitiful monument nestled in the grass behind a farmhouse here, the bee was nonetheless an irresistable beacon for our nephews, Christopher McInerney of Manhattan and Jonathan Steitz of Brook Park, Ohio. That is because it allowed them to make a round-trip drive of 320 miles from our house in Bethlehem, N.H.</p>

        <p>AT 16, boys are fascinated by a lot of things. Cars, for instance, and the birds and the bees. We had the cars and went in search of a bee -- specifically, an 800-pound fiberglass likeness described as the ''world's largest bee'' in an off-the-wall travel guide.</p>
        <p>A rather pitiful monument nestled in the grass behind a farmhouse here, the bee was nonetheless an irresistable beacon for our nephews, Christopher McInerney of Manhattan and Jonathan Steitz of Brook Park, Ohio. That is because it allowed them to make a round-trip drive of 320 miles from our house in Bethlehem, N.H.</p>
        <p>The drive was part of an experiment aimed at improving their driving skills. We set up a road-going boot camp, carefully supervising them as they each drove more than 1,000 miles in a week. The experience concluded with a day of intensive professional training at the Team O'Neil Car Control and Rally School near Franconia, N.H.</p>
        <p>There is reason for concern about beginning drivers. Auto crashes are the leading cause of death among teenagers. Safety researchers say young drivers are particularly vulnerable because they lack experience.</p>
        <p>Assessing our plan, Brian O'Neill, president of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety in Arlington, Va., called it ''a very good start.'' He added: ''Of course, your comfort level likely will be inversely related to the value of the experience. The more stressful it is for you, the more valuable it will be for them.''</p>
        <p>To make the experience less harrowing for Christopher and Jonathan, their exercises were conducted in two of the trendiest vehicles around, a Chrysler PT Cruiser and a Volkswagen New Beetle, both obtained from the manufacturers' fleets of test cars.</p>
        <p>The two youths had different levels of experience. Jonathan had driven a few hours a week in the summer, but Christopher was starting fresh. New York City forbids teens from learning to drive in the five boroughs unless the vehicle has dual controls.</p>
        <p>Christopher got his first lesson on a Sunday afternoon on the private roads and training area of the O'Neil school, which was closed for the day. Then there were the stressful early miles when Christopher and Jonathan worked out pesky details like how far to turn the wheel to get the vehicle to change direction. But by Thursday, having made impressive progress through daily driving, they were on their way to the giant bee, one of the odd tourist attractions featured in ''The New Roadside America'' by Mike Wilkins, Ken Smith and Doug Kirby (Simon &amp; Schuster, 1992).</p>
        <p>There were, of course, a few missteps. Christopher dropped a wheel off the pavement, but in making his correction he heeded our overarching advice: Don't panic unless we say it is time to panic. Instead, he slowly and carefully eased back onto the road, avoiding young drivers' common error of turning back onto the pavement too sharply, then shooting across the highway.</p>
        <p>Jonathan had to be reminded to keep both hands in the correct position on the wheel (at 3 and 9 o'clock) and to watch his speed.</p>
        <p>Moving down the two-lane Vermont Route 100, which has as many turns as the lower intestine, Christopher and Jonathan were knitting it all together. They practiced how car control involves managing the weight of the vehicle over the tires and how that can be controlled by the thoughtful use of the brake (the pedal on the left) and the accelerator (the pedal on the right).</p>
        <p>For example, a little more weight on the front of the car, achieved by lifting off the gas or gently applying and releasing the brake, can help a car turn better. Applying a bit of gas can transfer weight to the rear, helping to steady a car if the tail feels light or -- heaven forbid -- is fishtailing.</p>
        <p>We also imparted important bits of driving advice from our formative years. For example, there was the lesson from the 1960 Mark Dinning song ''Teen Angel'': If a car stalls on a railroad track, do not go running back to get a high school ring.</p>
        <p>Smoothly and safely, we made a beeline to our destination, and Christopher and Jonathan were unable to contain themselves. ''The -- suspense -- is -- too -- much,'' said Christopher in a slow monotone that made the Manchurian Candidate seem animated.</p>
        <p>Minutes later, we were behind the farmhouse owned by Kathie and Jerry Costello. As they had warned, the bee -- its legs had collapsed in a storm -- wasn't a pretty sight.</p>
        <p>It had originally stood outside the Honey Museum here. The Costellos had rescued it, for reasons we never fully understood and were not eager to pursue, when the museum went out of business.</p>
        <p>''It ended up temporarily in our backyard,'' said Mrs. Costello, who owns the equally quirky Deacons Den restaurant as well as Mt. Snow Properties, a group of inns and lodges. But temporary may have a different meaning in Vermont. ''It has been here 18 years,'' she conceded.</p>
        <p>''Wow,'' said Christopher as he looked at the bee, though he may have been referring to the Costellos' 22-year-old daughter, Erin.</p>
        <p>On the roller-coaster drive back to New Hampshire, the boys delighted in the cool style of the PT Cruiser, but they enjoyed driving the Beetle more, saying it felt lighter and quicker to respond.</p>
        <p>The next day, they probably learned the most as they attended the O'Neil school. In addition to teaching techniques to rally racers and high-speed driving to law enforcement officers, Tim O'Neil runs classes for teenagers and for winter driving. The teen-driving course, which includes skid control and accident-avoidance maneuvers, costs $200 if the student provides a car or $300 if he or she uses one of the school's.</p>
        <p>First, Mr. O'Neil showed them how to control a car when the front skids (understeers) and when the rear end skids and fishtails (oversteers). Then they ran a slalom between orange cones, noting how the car's shifting weight affects the handling. There was also an emergency stopping lesson with and without antilock brakes.</p>
        <p>A final crucial exercise involved learning emergency maneuvers: what to do if the road is suddenly blocked and there is no time to stop. The boys took turns driving toward Mr. O'Neil at 35 m.p.h. At the last second, he pointed for them to go left or right; they had to swerve quickly into the correct lane without knocking over a cone.</p>
        <p>Most of the time they did fine, but even when they lost control, it was a perfectly safe way to see how quickly a car can get away from a driver -- and how helpless one feels when it does.</p>
        <p>The week ended without mishap, and with a final caution. Mr. O'Neil told the boys that their learning experience was only beginning. ''Just know that you're vulnerable because you're young and fearless,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Information about the O'Neil driving school is available at www.team-oneil.com or by calling (603) 823-5558.</p>
        <p>Learning to Drive</p>
        <p>HERE is no central record of how many young people take driver's education classes or other types of driving courses, although safety experts say there seem to be fewer school programs today because of budget cuts in many districts.</p>
        <p>There are no federal requirements for driver's education programs, so programs vary considerably. If the state does not require driver's education, students can pay for a course, learn from family and friends, or wait until they are 18 to take a state driving test and obtain a license. If the state requires driver's education and the school does not offer a course, students have to pay for a course outside their schools or wait until they are 18.</p>
        <p>At high schools that offer classes, 30 hours of instruction with 6 hours behind the wheel is common. Some states have raised on-the-road instruction to 8 or 10 hours and require 50 hours of supervised practice.</p>
