        <p>Owens Corning, facing a cooling of its markets as asbestos-related litigation is heating up, said yesterday that it had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.</p>
        <p>Owens Corning is the 23rd company to file for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code because of asbestos litigation. Babcock &amp; Wilcox and Pittsburgh Corning filed for protection earlier this year. And there may be more as plaintiffs' lawyers focus future claims on the dwindling supply of solvent companies.</p>
        <p>''This will increase by a substantial factor the burden on remaining asbestos defendants,'' warned Richard Weinberg, general counsel for the GAF Corporation, a privately held company that is an asbestos litigant.</p>
        <p>Investors seem to think so. Shares of Owens Corning did not trade yesterday. But Armstrong Holdings, USG, Owens Illinois, Federal Mogul and several others involved in asbestos litigation lost more than half of their market value.</p>
        <p>Owens Corning's filing is the end to a two-year effort to stay out of bankruptcy court. In 1998, the company -- which derived only $135 million in sales from products containing asbestos -- signed a national settlement with more than 50 law firms. It called for settling claims on the basis of length of exposure to asbestos and severity of disease.</p>
        <p>The agreement was intended to enable Owens Corning to pay settlements in manageable amounts and to stanch the flow of claims from people who did not have symptoms. Partly because of the agreement, Owens Corning and other litigants stopped pressing Congress to pass legislation restraining asbestos suits.</p>
        <p>But many plaintiffs' lawyers did not join the agreement, and asbestos claims continued to pour in. To date, the company, whose annual revenue is about $5 billion, has received more than 460,000 asbestos personal injury claims amounting to more than $5 billion in payments.</p>
        <p>''I'd settle 10,000 claims in a quarter, and 10,000 more would pop up,'' said Maura Abeln Smith, Owens Corning's chief counsel. ''We just weren't making any headway.''</p>
        <p>Owens Corning is the country's top maker of fiberglass insulation for residential homes, so it still had a chance at avoiding bankruptcy while the building markets were still booming. But its markets started softening in the spring, leaving Owens Corning struggling for cash.</p>
        <p>It has sold assets, particularly in Europe. And many lawyers gave it until November to make payments that had been due over the summer.</p>
        <p>''Owens Corning did the right thing, and we've tried to help as best we could,'' said Frederick M. Baron, a senior partner with Baron &amp; Budd in Dallas and the president of the Association of Trial Lawyers of America.</p>
        <p>But the company's banks did not agree to its request for refinancing. With interest payments approaching $200 million a year -- and with $250 million in scheduled asbestos claims looming in the fourth quarter -- bankruptcy was unavoidable.</p>
        <p>''They'd borrowed as much as they could, the stock was too low to issue more equity, and you can only sell assets for so long before you start dissipating your underlying value,'' said Gary Schneider, an analyst at Bear, Stearns.</p>
        <p>Most analysts expect Owens Corning's businesses to remain unscathed. The company has a new $500 million line of credit from Bank of America. It will no longer pay dividends or interest on its nearly $3 billion in debt. And analysts have generally viewed it as well-managed.</p>
        <p>''You don't get to be No. 1 in your businesses if you have mediocre management,'' Mr. Schneider said.</p>
