        <p>Burberry, whose check-lined raincoats were once ubiquitous on fashionable city streets, recently bought the building next to its store on 57th Street and plans to expand its retail  space, the company announced yesterday.</p>
        <p>Burberry's new building, at 7 West 57th Street, has been occupied by Escada, a clothing retailer, since 1991. Escada plans to open a new store a block away, at 717 Fifth Avenue, in about a year, said a company spokeswoman, Amy Rosi. Its new space, once the home of Steuben Glass and Revillon Furs, will be smaller than the existing store but better suited for presenting the company's merchandise, she said.</p>

        <p>Burberry, a division of the Great Universal Stores, a British company, said its new store is expected to open in the fall of 2002.</p>
        <p>''This just proves that fashion is back on both Fifth Avenue and 57th Street,'' said Robert K. Futterman, a broker specializing in retail space. ''The theme and more promotional concepts are just not making it.''</p>
