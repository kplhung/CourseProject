        <p>Alexander and Bonin  132 10th Avenue, at 18th Street, Chelsea  Through Oct. 14</p>
        <p>So many ideas and themes course through Mr. Benedict's zany work that his show seems more like a group presentation than a solo. His arcane sculptures, paintings and assemblages take cues from pop culture, religion, myth, fiction and nostalgia, but occasionally his craftsmanship comes across as more compelling than his concepts.</p>
        <p>One of his inspirations is tarot, the deck of cards used for divination that dates from the mid-15th century. Its chief manifestation here is an epic procession of cleverly worked-over miniature toys and figurines, all painted white, titled ''The Trumps'' (no relation to Donald). Representing the 22 major allegorical tarot figures, they include a lobster ridden by a crescent moon topped by a dog and an old engine pulled by two sphinxes.</p>

        <p>From quite a different realm is a fictive detective named Durant who has appeared in Mr. Benedict's work before. Here he is the subject of a large, ambiguous painting -- more like an illustration from True Crime magazine -- that seems to make him the victim of foul play rather than the mystery's solver. Seen strikingly from above and behind, he sits in vest and shirt sleeves, slumped over his desk, one hand grasping the telephone receiver. Spread out before him are his coffee mug, a ''wanted'' poster and other props, but the jury is out on whether he's dead or just sniffing for clues.</p>
        <p>Religion haunts Mr. Benedict's work, too, carried out in creations like an ingeniously designed rood screen (here titled ''Rude Screen''), an artifact of the Gothic church that separates the nave from the choir. Mr. Benedict's is made from wooden crutches held together by embroidery hoops. The rubber bottoms of the upturned crutches are adorned with the figures of modernized saints, including St. Florian, patron of firemen, dressed in a rubber coat and wielding an ax.</p>
        <p>The artist's wide-ranging subjects also include a posterish painting of Army bakers in World War I, a large bowling ball bearing a sprawling figure of Lucifer and ''Looking Glass,'' a mirror paved with gray fragments of wrecked ships. He has produced a clever body of work that needs more focus.</p>
