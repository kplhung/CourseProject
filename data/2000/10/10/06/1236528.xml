        <p>In July 1999, accountants from the Diocese of Brooklyn arrived at Our Lady Queen of Martyrs Roman Catholic Church in Queens. They had heard reports from the parish that the pastor, Msgr. Thomas J. Gradilone, had been acting irrationally, and the accountants wanted to see the books. They exchanged pleasantries with the monsignor and turned their attention to the numbers.</p>
        <p>They immediately became concerned. First they saw a smudge on a ledger, underneath a number showing the total weekly collections from Mass. Then they saw another. Then more. All through one set of books they found eraser marks beneath new numbers, the work of an apparently determined hand.</p>
        <p>The investigation deepened. The ledger's entries of proceeds from collection baskets at Masses did not match the weekly collection figures published in the church bulletin. In fact, said Martin McManus, the diocese's controller and the supervisor of its auditors, as much as $1,500 a week was unaccounted for.</p>
        <p>Last Sunday, Bishop Thomas V. Daily, whose diocese comprises Brooklyn and Queens, told parishioners at five Masses that millions of dollars were missing from their prominent Forest Hills church. He said Monsignor Gradilone's explanation to the diocese for the financial discrepancy had ''limited credibility.''</p>
        <p>Long before the bishop addressed the parishioners, signs of betrayal were emerging.</p>
        <p>Two of the diocese's financial officers said this week that a forensic trail led them to documents indicating that $100,000 had been taken from a parish mutual fund. And over a five-year period, they found, $2 million had passed through an unauthorized church checking account. Perhaps most troubling, they said, hundreds of thousands of dollars from that account ended up in the hands of at least one convicted felon with whom Monsignor Gradilone shared his time.</p>
        <p>From the smudge of an eraser to the pastor's secretly managed account, the early suspicions of the diocesan auditors exposed unsettling cracks in oversight of money that parishioners generously dropped into baskets at each Mass. And, as a growing pool of investigators have begun working on the case, these early clues have forced a painful reassessment of the legacy of a long-revered man, whose private life and pastoral management have thrust a proud parish into a period of embarrassment and dismay.</p>
        <p>''Queen of Martyrs has always played a large role in the life of Forest Hills,'' said Geraldine A. Ferraro, the former vice-presidential candidate, who has been a member of the parish for decades, and whose husband, John A. Zaccaro, attended the parish elementary school more than half a century ago. ''I am really having trouble reconciling the fact that this is moving in the direction that it has.''</p>
        <p>In almost any parish, the primary source of income -- the money that finances the payroll, underwrites the youth sports leagues and keeps the lights on -- comes from collection baskets passed along the pews at Mass. At Our Lady Queen of Martyrs, the collections were tallied by a group of volunteer parishioners and recorded in documents known as count sheets. The money, typically about $10,000 a week, was then deposited in the church's operating account.</p>
        <p>But the weekly tally of collections published in the parish bulletin repeatedly had numbers higher than those recorded on the sheets, indicating that someone had altered them after the volunteers had left. Those discrepancies, Mr. McManus said, ''led us to find the fact that all of the money wasn't being deposited.''</p>
        <p>There were other indications of trouble. In two visits to the church, one in the summer of 1999 and the other early this year, the diocese's financial officers found what they now call inappropriate bookkeeping and transactions, and began questioning the church's financial secretary -- Monsignor Gradilone.</p>
        <p>Their reviews of the books, said Mr. McManus and Frank Galligan, the diocese's chief financial officer, turned up more than altered count sheets. They found that Monsignor Gradilone had liquidated a mutual fund in the church's investment portfolio, but that the money had not been used for any discernible parish purpose. They also found his signature on checks from the church's operating account that were made out to cash; there were no invoices, the officers said, to support those conversions.</p>
        <p>And not long after Monsignor Gradilone, 75, retired in January, his successor, Msgr. Joseph A. Funaro, found the most worrisome records of all, the financial officers said: documents for a long-hidden checking account at Sterling National Bank. Monsignor Gradilone was the sole authorized signer of the account, Mr. McManus and Mr. Galligan said. Two other previously unknown checking accounts were also found, they said, although the magnitude of their use seems to be much smaller.</p>
        <p>After finding these accounts, the diocese went outside its own staff and hired accountants from Grassi &amp; Company, a Nassau County firm, to conduct an audit of the unauthorized accounts. The firm issued a report in July, giving Bishop Daily grounds to set in motion the criminal inquiry.</p>
        <p>The diocese's financial officers said the report indicated that Monsignor Gradilone used the Sterling National account, which he labeled ''fund-raising'' but never disclosed on the budgets he submitted to the diocese, to give $300,000 to an ex-convict, Frank Vivona. They suspect that another man with a criminal record, George Schweigert, also received money from the account, although to date the auditors have been unable to determine the sum because many of the account's checks were made out merely to cash.</p>
        <p>The nature of the retired pastor's relationship with these men, criminal investigators and church officers say, remains unknown, and they are examining theories that range from friendship to blackmail. People who know both men also said Monsignor Gradilone lived at times with Mr. Vivona, whose most recent residence, a waterfront home in Babylon, Long Island, was searched on Tuesday night by detectives who removed documents and a small amount of cash.</p>
        <p>No one has been charged in the case, although Monsignor Gradilone has retained a lawyer, Albert Gaudelli, who would not comment. Monsignor Gradilone is in seclusion at an undisclosed location outside the diocese, where, Bishop Daily said, he has agreed to ''reflect deeply on these events that have disrupted his life and the lives of others.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Vivona would not comment in detail to a reporter, stopping the interview when asked if he had received $300,000 from the monsignor, as the diocesan accountants said. ''That much?'' he answered. ''See how you people are misinformed?'' He referred further questions to a lawyer, who would not comment.</p>
        <p>Law enforcement officials said this week that they were seeking Mr. Schweigert for questioning. They have been unable to find him, and believe that he is indigent.</p>
        <p>The auditors' findings also provided the basis for Bishop Daily's address to the church on Sunday, announcing that Richard A. Brown, the Queens district attorney, was examining the case. It was a day that shook the parish.</p>
        <p>Nearly 3,000 families are members of Our Lady Queen of Martyrs, and as many as 5,000 people attend the seven weekend Masses. And throughout his 18-year stewardship of the church, Monsignor Gradilone, a native of Ridgewood, Queens, was regarded as a gifted, professorial priest and an unflinchingly generous man. His record suggests a rich and flexible mind. He holds a doctorate in the classics; has mastered Latin, Italian, Spanish and classical Greek; and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa at Fordham University. He is also an enthusiastic violinist and singer who is said to recall the lyrics, effortlessly, to scores of popular songs.</p>
        <p>''He is a man of many parts,'' said Frank DeRosa, the spokesman for the diocese. ''It is just sad that this is surrounding him at this time.''</p>
        <p>Investigators have said their work will take months. Mr. McManus and Mr. Galligan said the accountants were still gathering the accounts' deposit slips and other records, so they can determine where the money came from, and where it went.</p>
        <p>Diocesan officials said this week that the parish was not in financial jeopardy. They said it still had a cash reserve, from past surpluses, totaling at least $176,000 and could meet all its obligations. ''The church is sound,'' Mr. Galligan said.</p>
        <p>As the auditors struggle to reconstruct the path of each errant dollar, prosecutors and detectives are trying to assemble, from a puzzle of murky details, an understanding of Monsignor Gradilone's relationship with Mr. Vivona and Mr. Schweigert.</p>
        <p>Both men are felons. Mr Vivona, 45, was convicted of grand larceny and second-degree assault in 1984, and served a prison term in the 1980's. Mr. Schweigert, 39, was convicted of burglarizing churches in Queens and served prison terms in the late 1980's and early 1990's. He was charged with possessing crack pipes in February, and received a conditional discharge.</p>
        <p>Church employees said the monsignor met Mr. Schweigert at the church in the late 1980's, when the pastor began giving him food, loans and counseling for a drug problem.</p>
        <p>At first, the pastor's interest seemed an extension of his generosity; Monsignor Gradilone, one worker said, was predisposed to helping the needy. Many parishioners, for instance, said he gave them money as well to help with rent, tuition, car payments or medical bills.</p>
        <p>But over time, the church workers said, they became troubled by the presence of Mr. Schweigert, who in recent years showed up at the church to demand money, or sent another man, who was known on the church grounds only as Hector, to pick up envelopes of cash. One worker said Mr. Schweigert was never satisfied, and became a troubling burden for the pastor.</p>
        <p>Church employees said they had also seen Mr. Vivona at times, although he was more well known by neighbors at a home in Suffolk County that Monsignor  Gradilone owned for 12 years and sold last year. Neighbors said Mr. Vivona lived at the house, in Mastic Beach, during much of the 1990's; motor vehicle records show that the men had used the same post office box since 1994.</p>
        <p>One neighbor, Gwendolyn McMillan, said she was fond of the monsignor. But she was uncomfortable with Mr. Vivona, whom she described as a brooding man, prone to outbursts and even to bullying the pastor, who is 30 years his senior. ''It seemed like he had something over Father Thomas,'' Ms. McMillan said. ''I never understood why Father Thomas kept him around.''</p>
        <p>Not long before the monsignor sold the house, Mr. Vivona rented a two-bedroom house in Babylon, on the waters of Great South Bay. The landlord there, Joseph Pacula, a retired police officer, said Mr. Vivona signed a one-year lease in September 1999, saying he was a retired restaurant owner. He used the monsignor as a reference, and told Mr. Pacula that the monsignor would be staying with him.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pacula's impressions were similar to Ms. McMillan's. He liked the monsignor, who he said stayed at the house about two nights a week. He thought Mr. Vivona was a difficult presence, a man who ostentatiously flashed rolls of cash and who frequently complained. Mr. Pacula never learned the nature of their relationship. ''I wanted to know but I never wanted to ask,'' he said. ''I didn't want to intrude on the monsignor.''</p>
        <p>With the investigations to date providing more questions than answers, Monsignor Gradilone's supporters and critics alike agree on one matter: it seemed that the monsignor did not use the missing money for himself. Diocesan officials said they had seen no apparent signs of wealth, vices or significant assets, although they also said they had not yet reviewed all the monsignor's personal accounts.</p>
        <p>One man who finds the allegations unfathomable is Brian Thomas, now a vice president at Mutual of America in Rochester. Mr. Thomas was a student at Cathedral College in Queens, where Monsignor Gradilone was president from 1972 to 1982. He said he was struck by the simplicity of the trappings of the monsignor's life, and recalled that he drove a beat-up station wagon. It was the shabbiest car in the faculty lot.</p>
