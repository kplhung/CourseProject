        <p>Julian Schnabel's film ''Before Night Falls'' belongs to what might be called the life-is-but-a-dream school of biographical cinema in the way it hovers ethereally over its subject and conjures up fragments of his consciousness in brilliant, disconnected flashes. Adapted from a memoir by the exiled Cuban poet and novelist Reinaldo Arenas, this haunting film portrays that homosexual dissident writer as a desperate unfulfilled searcher for a lost heaven on earth that he experiences only briefly as a very young man. No sooner has he tasted the ecstasies of this pagan paradise than it is snatched away by the punishing, gray-faced Communist revolution.</p>
        <p>Relentlessly persecuted for being gay and for having his manuscripts smuggled out of the country and published abroad, Arenas eventually migrated to the United States along with thousands of other Cubans during the 1980 Mariel boatlift. But if exile brought him freedom, it provided little satisfaction. After living unhappily in Miami for a time (the film omits this period) Arenas settled in New York, where he committed suicide in 1990. (He was suffering from AIDS.) In his suicide letter he bitterly blamed Fidel Castro for all his troubles, including his death.</p>
        <p>For all the pain and disappointment it encapsulates, ''Before Night Falls'' is far from a glum film. Like a deathbed dream it leapfrogs through Arenas's life, reconstructing crucial moments as a succession of bright, feverish illuminations. The movie, which the New York Film Festival is showing this evening and on Sunday at Alice Tully Hall, makes little attempt to psychoanalyze Arenas or to explain him. Instead it dips into his imagination, plumbing the sources of his art in scenes that evoke his closeness with nature and his obsession with sex.</p>
        <p>Javier Bardem, the gifted Spanish actor who portrays Arenas (and who bears a striking physical resemblance to him) narrates the film (whose screenplay incorporates swatches of Arenas's posthumously published 1993 memoir) in a thickly accented English that is occasionally difficult to follow. The portrait it paints is of a slightly mad romantic who never recovers from the dashing of his illusions.</p>
        <p>Freedom for Arenas didn't simply mean freedom of political expression; it was synonymous with his being a wild boy who claimed to have had 5,000 sexual encounters by age 25. When the Communist revolution on which he had pinned his inchoate boyhood hopes clamped down on Cuba's free-for-all sexual climate and threw homosexuals in prison camps, Arenas began to throw a lifelong tantrum. Liberation wasn't supposed to bring repression.</p>
        <p>The film's early scenes of Arenas's dirt-poor childhood in Oriente province, where he was brought up by a single mother and his grandparents, are dizzyingly gorgeous, surreal evocations of a sopping semi-jungle environment where he played in mud holes and carved his early poems into trees. Childhood memories of torrential floods rushing across the landscape have a kind of a voluptuous majesty, and as Arenas matures, the movie returns again and again to images of water.</p>
        <p>His happiest moments are his days spent lolling on the beach in male company and having indiscriminate sex everywhere and with everyone. One of his first boyfriends, Pepe (Andrea Di Stefano), a handsome bisexual stud and heartbreaker (who later betrays him), is held up as Arenas's erotic ideal, a rampantly priapic force of nature.</p>
        <p>In these scenes the film deliciously evokes pre-Castro Cuba as a sensual endless summer of hot pliable flesh and lapping turquoise waters. Later, when Arenas escapes from prison, he steals out of his cell, squeezes through a fence, and dives into the ocean. Later still, in an unsuccessful attempt to flee Cuba, he floats out to sea on an inner tube.</p>
        <p>While still a boy, the film recalls, Arenas desperately wanted to join the Communist guerrillas, and it skillfully weaves period color film clips of the revolutionary celebration with similarly grainy original scenes. No wonder then that when the revolution, which he had naively equated with personal salvation, repressed homosexuals and artists, he became its bitter, unforgiving enemy.</p>
        <p>''Before Night Falls'' skips lightly over Arenas's persecution and imprisonment. Thrown into an overcrowded jail teeming with murderers and rapists, he earns respect (and cigarettes) by writing letters for his illiterate fellow prisoners. In the most nightmarish scene he is thrown into solitary confinement in a cell, lighted with a single hissing bulb, that is so cramped he is unable to stand up straight.</p>
        <p>Johnny Depp has flashy dual cameo roles as a transvestite who smuggles Arenas's rolled-up manuscripts out of prison and as a prison guard who uses sexual manipulation to secure Arenas's signature on a statement declaring his own writing to be worthless.</p>
        <p>Once the film moves to New York, its colors dim, as though all the light had gone out of Arenas's life. As he becomes ill, he is dutifully attended by his companion Lazaro Gomes Garriles (Olivier Martinez). Long before Arenas kills himself (with pills and a plastic bag), his will to live appears to be spent. One of the movie's final and most resonant scenes intercuts images of the slums of New York with the grand but now crumbling architecture of contemporary Havana.</p>
        <p>''Before Night Falls'' is a larger, more emotionally sweeping film than Mr. Schnabel's 1996 movie debut, ''Basquiat.'' But like its predecessor it is essentially a painter's movie. Despite its copious narration, it often feels as if the words of the screenplay were scrawled onto the canvas as an afterthought.</p>
        <p>Like many of Mr. Schnabel's paintings, this cinematic canvas is consciously heroic in its scale. Yet ''Before Night Falls'' is mercifully neither hagiographic nor politically strident. And for all the brutality Arenas endured in his life, the movie is surprisingly gentle and free of jarring shocks. If ''Before Night Falls'' doesn't give us Arenas's life as he actually experienced it, it offers penetrating glimpses into his life as he may have dreamed it.</p>
