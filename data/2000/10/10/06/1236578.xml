        <p>Paula Cooper Gallery  534 West 21st Street, Chelsea  Through Oct. 14</p>
        <p>The pluses and minuses of Meg Webster's current show are blatant: one installation piece is excellent, the other isn't. Excellent is ''Warped Floor,'' a 20-foot-square, 6-foot-high undulating surface made of largish terra-cotta squares set in sand and supported by a wood infrastructure. It suggests an enormous mountain desert compressed to bonsai scale -- or a particularly huge Charles Simonds work. Even when you walk on it, which is allowed, you seem to be viewing it from a great distance.</p>

        <p>Paula Cooper Gallery  534 West 21st Street, Chelsea  Through Oct. 14</p>
        <p>The pluses and minuses of Meg Webster's current show are blatant: one installation piece is excellent, the other isn't. Excellent is ''Warped Floor,'' a 20-foot-square, 6-foot-high undulating surface made of largish terra-cotta squares set in sand and supported by a wood infrastructure. It suggests an enormous mountain desert compressed to bonsai scale -- or a particularly huge Charles Simonds work. Even when you walk on it, which is allowed, you seem to be viewing it from a great distance.</p>
        <p>The second work, which is two pieces, accomplishes no such magical atmosphere or perceptual inversion. ''Long Pool'' is a Jacuzzi-size reservoir of water surrounded by a dense array of tropical plants, including orchids, ferns, a pineapple tree and a water lily. A narrow channel connects it to a second pool, ''Interacting Falls: Plain and Shooter.'' The title explains the difference between the streams of water emptying into the pool from characteristically low-tech apparatus overhead, while also suggesting a sexual pun.</p>
        <p>With all the spritzing and greenness, these pieces have their soothing aspects; with a little polishing they would be at home in a shopping mall. But mainly they heighten the experience of the terra-cotta terrain of ''Warped Floor,'' making it seem even stranger, like a mirage encountered at the edge of a jungle.</p>
