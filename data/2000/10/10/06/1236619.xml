        <p>SCHAEFFER-Hans A. Formerly of Linden, NJ, passed away October 4, 2000 at home in Bethesda, MD., with his wife by his side. His wife, Leilo, his three children, Barbara Dagger of Woodstock, VT, Monica Gorochow of Patomic, MD and Edward Schaeffer of Wellesley, MA &amp; seven grandchildren survive him. Born in Berlin, Germany, Mr. Schaeffer began his education in chemistry at the Technical University of Berlin. He was very fortunate to escape Germany in 1939 and move to London, England where he further developed his knowledge in chemistry, pharmacology and toxicology at London University. In 1947 he moved to the U.S. where he settled in Linden, NJ working at E.R. Squibb and completing graduate courses at Rutgers University in NJ. He continued his careerworking for such well-known pharmaceutical and personal care companies as Block Drug and J.B. Williams Co. He retired in 1982 from J.B. Williams to form Hans A. Schaeffer Associates. For 18 years working with companies such as Beecham Products, Whitehall Laboratories and BectonDickinson, he dedicated himself to developing innovative and advanced technological products for the personal care industry. He held numerous patents including the original patent on Mentadent Toothpaste. He will long be remembered for his innovation and contributions in commercializing raw materials for the cosmetic industry. Mr. Schaeffer's loss will be strongly felt within the personal care and pharmaceutical industry.</p>
