        <p>Like any hyperscheduled mother of two with a full-time job, Toni Caracciolo does not have time to spend 90 minutes sitting still. So on Tuesday night she tuned in and out of the debate between Al Gore and George W. Bush while giving her young daughters a bath. Still, Ms. Caracciolo, a Republican, saw enough to consider doing something that she never has before and that would appall her husband: casting her vote for a Democrat.</p>
        <p>To her, Mr. Gore seemed to offer more for people with less.</p>
        <p>''I guess I felt more pride to actually be an American, because the proposals of his campaign take care of our neighbors,'' said Ms. Caracciolo, a 34-year-old advertising brand manager, who was having a business lunch today in Clayton, Mo., an affluent suburb of St. Louis. ''A true community takes care of all of those people.'' Mr. Gore, she added, ''came across to me last night as the one who would work the hardest.''</p>
        <p>Then Ms. Caracciolo paused. ''Maybe I am decided,'' she said, smiling. ''I just won't let my husband know.''</p>
        <p>The gender gap appears alive and well in Missouri, the swing state that has picked every president in the last century but Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1956.</p>
        <p>Conversations with a random assortment of two dozen voters in the St. Louis suburbs this week -- mothers taking their children to soccer practice, retirees at their afternoon bowling games, a chemist shopping at the local grocery chain, Schnuck's -- showed that the presidential debate did have some effect on those undecided voters interviewed. Specifically, undecided women said they were now leaning toward Mr. Gore, while undecided men said they were leaning toward Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>Undecided women, whether Republican, Democratic or independent, said Mr. Gore seemed strong, presidential and, as one woman put it, less ''wishy-washy'' than expected. But undecided men, even some who support Mr. Gore, were put off by him. Robert Fishbone, a 49-year-old painter and musician who plans to vote for Mr. Gore, called him ''Mr. Technical.''</p>
        <p>Dutt Vinjamoori, a research chemist for Monsanto, cast Mr. Gore as an annoying best student in the class who would lecture the country for the next four years.</p>
        <p>''What he has to do is quit telling me all these minute details,'' said Mr. Vinjamoori, 52, an independent who voted twice for Ronald Reagan and twice for President Clinton and who is now leaning toward Mr. Bush. ''He has to tell me how he would lead the country, without lecturing me. And he sounds like he has preprogrammed answers. He doesn't speak from his heart.''</p>
        <p>Especially irritating, Mr. Vinjamoori said, was Mr. Gore's aside that Yugoslavia is composed of ''Serbia plus Montenegro.''</p>
        <p>''I didn't like that,'' he said. ''You don't have to give that kind of lecture that you know it all.''</p>
        <p>With a Democratic governor and two Republican senators, voters here are traditionally bipartisan, although one Washington University political science professor, James W. Davis, has wondered if the state is not simply ambivalent.</p>
        <p>Either way, the solid suburbs that fan out from downtown St. Louis and the Mississippi River -- from the baronial and largely Republican Ladue to the more middle class and Democratic University City to the highly educated but less monied Olivette -- are home to some of the nation's most independent-minded voters.</p>
        <p>''A lot of us don't take party identification particularly seriously,'' Mr. Davis said.</p>
        <p>If there is anywhere that the presidential debates might sway viewers, it may well be here.</p>
        <p>A case in point is Jacqueline Taylor, a 43-year-old nurse and registered Democrat who lives with her husband, a doctor, and four children in Ladue. Ms. Taylor said she had started watching the debate with little enthusiasm for Mr. Gore, whom she thought of as ''such a wishy-washy person'' and ''a nerd.'' In fact, she said, ''I kind of in my heart wanted Bush to say something to change my mind, to swing me over.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Bush did not. In Ms. Taylor's view, he made a big mistake when he said that the Russians should intervene in the Balkans and help persuade Slobodan Milosevic to step down.</p>
        <p>''Let the Russians handle it,'' Ms. Taylor said, paraphrasing Mr. Bush with disgust. ''We're supposed to be the world leader.'' His answer, she said, was ''wimpy.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush, she said, should have been better prepared. And Mr. Gore, to her surprise, seemed commanding and forceful.</p>
        <p>''I just got the impression he knew what he was talking about,'' she said. ''I got the impression that he would be a stronger leader.'' Ultimately, she said, ''the debate helped to demystify him.''</p>
        <p>Vicki Simon, a 55-year-old independent who often votes for Democrats, had a similar reaction. She was leaning with no excitement toward Mr. Gore and was willing to consider Mr. Bush. Ms. Simon said she had been particularly interested in the debate because she had spent the last two years as a lay missionary in Nairobi, Kenya, cut off from American politics and television. She was home for a visit with her son and will vote by absentee ballot.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's performance, she said, made up her mind -- against him. She said he seemed ''on the defensive'' and not intellectually matched against Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>''When I think of the issues that the president has to deal with, I think you need someone who has as much knowledge of world issues as domestic issues,'' Ms. Simon said, over coffee with her son at the St. Louis Bread Company in the suburb Richmond Heights.</p>
        <p>''I would trust the man, but I just don't know that he has the capabilities. And that was solidified for me last night. I came away thinking, 'Oh, my God, he could be president of this country -- I'm staying in Kenya.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore surprised her, too: ''He wasn't as boring as I remember him,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Simon's 28-year-old son, Mark, of University City, saw it differently. He, too, is an independent, and he, too, was undecided before the debate. Now he still is, but he is more comfortable with Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>''I had expected him to come off looking like an idiot, and he didn't,'' said Mr. Simon, a counselor at a group home for teenagers. He added, ''He didn't swing my vote, but he made me more O.K. with the possibility of him being president.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Simon was also struck by what he described as Mr. Bush's endearing genuineness. ''I don't see him as clever enough or sophisticated enough to get away with lying,'' Mr. Simon said. ''He comes across as this simple guy who just says what he thinks. With Gore, I want to believe him, but I'm not sure I can trust all the acting stuff.''</p>
        <p>Gary Hollingsworth, 56, a coffee salesman and an independent who was picking up his two children at the Old Bonhomme School in Olivette, said that he also distrusted Mr. Gore. He was leaning toward Mr. Bush before the debate, he said, and still is, particularly after he heard on the radio that Mr. Gore had embellished anecdotes he told during the debate about a crowded school classroom in Florida and a trip he took to inspect fires and floods in Texas.</p>
        <p>''I'm just troubled by it,'' Mr. Hollingsworth said. ''It's another example of the vice president making a statement that later proves to be inaccurate or incorrect. He's got a long history of it.''</p>
        <p>A number of voters said they remain troubled by Mr. Gore's ties to the Clinton administration. Its scandals, they said, have tainted him. But Ms. Caracciolo said Mr. Gore's debate performance owed much to the more relaxed style of Mr. Clinton.</p>
        <p>''Watching Gore, I could tell that Clinton spent some time with him,'' Ms. Caracciolo said. ''He learned something from Bill.''</p>
        <p>''That's what I'm afraid of,'' responded Ms. Caracciolo's colleague, Colleen Ide, who was part of the group having lunch. ''That's why I'm not going to vote for him.''</p>
