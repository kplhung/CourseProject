        <p>The slump that started in September hung on the Yankees like an anvil, threatening to pull them over the precipice that exists in every playoff. But they got a toe-hold and dug in and won Game 2 of the division series against Oakland on Wednesday, and now that they are stabilized, the Yankees are in a much better frame of mind to attempt that long climb to a third straight World Series championship.</p>
        <p>Luis Sojo is one of the expedition leaders, incredibly, with his ugly swing and his thick body, an aging player the Yankees let go after last season and found themselves desperately needing this year. Sojo hit a two-run double and turned two double plays in Game 2, pausing from his heroics to make one goofy mistake that teammates and friends will never let him forget.</p>
        <p>Sojo will presumably be at second base for Game 3 tonight, when the Yankees' Orlando Hernandez will pitch against Tim Hudson, the ace of the Athletics' staff, with the three-of-five-game series tied at 1-1. Roger Clemens is scheduled to start Game 4 tomorrow and, if a fifth game is required, it will be played in Oakland on Sunday.</p>
        <p>There was an edginess to the Yankees after Game 2. Their clubhouse in Oakland was filled with about twice as many reporters as there had been after the Game 1 defeat. Some of the players perceived the additional reporters as bandwagon jumpers, and they had some pointed comments about how the Yankees had been characterized. Tino Martinez and Paul O'Neill and others maintained strongly there was no carryover effect from the brutal slump at the end of the Yankees' regular season, that the news media were obsessed with the losing streak.</p>
        <p>Whether that is true is irrelevant.But the players' response was noteworthy: The Yankees are feeling besieged and are digging in.</p>
        <p>They did find great humor at Sojo's expense while eating their postgame meal in Oakland on Wednesday. SportsCenter was  on the television, highlights of the Yankees' freshly minted victory came on and there were a few oohs and aahs to the run-scoring hits by Glenallen Hill and Sojo, to a play made by third baseman Scott Brosius.</p>
        <p>But then Sojo's bizarre defensive gaffe was shown, and they laughed heartily.</p>
        <p>''Oh, my God,'' Derek Jeter said.</p>
        <p>There is no player in whom other Yankees take greater delight than Sojo, who is rarely without a smile or good-natured jabs aimed at other players. Sojo, 34, is teased constantly for being too old -- the coach Lee Mazzilli joked that Sojo was the first active player to receive his pension -- or too slow, his swing too awkward and ungraceful.</p>
        <p>Sojo often hacks at pitches while his rear end and front foot are falling toward third base, and his interpretation of the strike zone extends from the nose to the toenails. ''If I were a pitcher, I would throw the ball right down the middle to Luis,'' Jeter said. ''He couldn't hit it.''</p>
        <p>Sojo served as a utilityman from 1996 to 1999, but he rarely played, with Jeter and Chuck Knoblauch at short and second, and Sojo struggled. D'Angelo Jimenez, a young infielder, was being groomed to replace Sojo as the utilityman, and after last season, the Yankees allowed Sojo to depart as a free agent.</p>
        <p>But a week after Sojo signed a minor league contract with Pittsburgh, Jimenez was involved in a car accident and broke a bone in his neck, and the Yankees immediately tried to make a deal with the Pirates for Sojo.</p>
        <p>In the end, however, it might have worked out better for the Yankees that Sojo signed with the Pirates. He played often, got a lot of at-bats and had a chance to hone his game. The Pirates, nearing the end of a disappointing season, decided to dump Sojo in August, and the Yankees picked him up.</p>
        <p>He was expected to be only a part-time player, sharing time at second with Jose Vizcaino until Knoblauch recovered from his elbow injury. But Sojo batted .330 in his first 24 games with the Yankees, adding energy to the team.</p>
        <p>With Knoblauch having defensive problems, Manager Joe Torre decided to start Sojo in this series -- to Sojo's surprise. ''Knoblauch is the second baseman of this team,'' he said. ''But when you get a chance to play, you want to do well.''</p>
        <p>He doubled home the Yankees' first run in Game 1, and with that falling-off-the-table swing of his, slapped a two-run double in the sixth inning of Game 2, pushing the Yankees' lead to 3-0.</p>
        <p>Sojo no longer has great range, but he is steady and reliable and fearless turning double plays. Andy Pettitte was generating lots of ground balls with his sinker in Game 2.</p>
        <p>Twice, Oakland batters chopped bouncers to third, and Brosius fielded them and fired to second and Sojo came across second base to make the pivot, turning and sidearming  throws to first to complete double plays.</p>
        <p>With a runner at second and two outs in the eighth, Terrence Long hit an easy roller to Sojo, Mr. Steady, Mr. Defense. Sojo fielded the ball and moved his feet to throw -- and the spikes of his right shoe caught on the laces of his left shoe, and he fell down awkwardly, like a baby trying to take his first steps.</p>
        <p>The Athletics had runners at first and third and would bring the tying run to the plate, and Sojo was mortified. When Torre went to the mound to make a pitching change, Sojo stayed at his position, too embarrassed to join the other infielders with Torre. ''I've never had anything like that happen to me,'' Sojo said.</p>
        <p>But it is not in Sojo's nature to mope for too long. As Mariano Rivera warmed up, Sojo sidled over to Jeff Schrieber, the second base umpire, who had a hand on his face. ''What are you laughing at?'' Sojo demanded, in a self-deprecating way. Later, he said, ''I guess everyone in the ballpark was laughing.''</p>
        <p>Play resumed and Randy Velarde grounded to third, the ball taking a sideways hop. But Brosius knocked it down, picked up the ball and threw out Velarde. With the crisis over, Sojo had to face his teammates, some slapping him playfully on the side of his graying head. ''What do you expect when you're 50 years old?'' one asked, and when Sojo repeated this anecdote, he laughed.</p>
