        <p>Attorney General Janet Reno has told a group of Asian-American community leaders that she would seek to make public a highly classified Justice Department report said to be critical of the investigation and prosecution of Wen Ho Lee, the former scientist at the Los Alamos National Laboratory who was accused of mishandling nuclear secrets.</p>
        <p>Many prominent Asian-Americans had sharply criticized the government's prosecution of Dr. Lee, especially because of concerns he had been singled out because he was Chinese-American and had been initially suspected of spying for China. The meeting with Ms. Reno, which was on  Wednesday, seemed part of the fence-mending process and both sides expressed satisfaction.</p>
        <p>Ms. Reno met with the group of five Asian-Americans in her office in Washington for about 90 minutes. The group had sought the meeting to explain their call for a bipartisan, independent inquiry into why Dr. Lee was investigated, whether there had been racial profiling in his case and whether his treatment while in prison was unduly harsh.</p>
        <p>The group was led by Laura Hong, head of the National Asian Pacific American Bar Association, and included leaders from the Japanese American Citizens League, the National Asian Pacific Legal Consortium, the Organization for Chinese Americans and the National Federation of Filipino American Associations.</p>
        <p>Members of the group said Ms. Reno expressed sympathy for their concerns and added that if they were able to read the internal report, their questions might be answered.</p>
        <p>They also said Ms. Reno had vowed to push for the report's declassification as soon as possible, adding that if the community leaders were still unsatisfied after reading it she might consider calls for a new investigation.</p>
        <p>Myron Marlin, the Justice Department's spokesman, confirmed Ms. Reno's comments and added, ''The attorney general felt it was a good meeting.''</p>
        <p>The report was prepared earlier this year by Randy Bellows, an assistant United States attorney. Its circulation has been tightly restricted, but people who have read it have said it is authoritative and scathing in its criticisms of all the agencies involved in Dr. Lee's case, including the F.B.I., the Justice Department and the Department of Energy.</p>
        <p>It reportedly concluded that the investigation of Dr. Lee -- who had been suspected of, though never charged with, espionage -- was understaffed; that the investigators never pushed hard enough to examine Dr. Lee's computers at Los Alamos; and that the government never seriously pursued other suspects.</p>
        <p>Dr. Lee pleaded guilty last month to one felony count of mishandling nuclear secrets after being held in solitary confinement for more than nine months. He was sentenced to the time he had already served, with no probation or fines. He agreed to cooperate with government investigators and to explain why he had downloaded a large volume of nuclear data onto an unsecure computer and made copies of the information.</p>
        <p>In negotiating the deal, the government dropped 58 other counts, and was chastised by the federal judge who heard the case, James A. Parker, for what he described as punitive jail conditions and for having misled him about the threat presented by Dr. Lee's actions.</p>
        <p>''I felt reassured that the attorney general understood why the Asian-American community was so concerned,'' said Karen Narasaki, the executive director of the National Asian Pacific Legal Consortium.</p>
        <p>In addition, the group asked Ms. Reno to obtain the release of a large volume of government documents that Judge Parker had ordered the government to produce concerning the question of whether Dr. Lee had been unfairly singled out for prosecution. Once the plea deal was completed, the judge's order was dropped.</p>
        <p>The Asian-Americans who met with Ms. Reno asked if the documents could be released anyway, because they addressed the issues of whether other people accused of similar violations were prosecuted and if law enforcement officials unfairly focused on Asian-Americans on suspicions that they were more likely to spy for China or other Asian nations.</p>

        <p>Reno Says Tobacco Suit May Die  WASHINGTON, Oct. 5</p>
        <p>The Justice Department will have to drop its lawsuit against the tobacco industry unless Congress appropriates $23 million to pay for it, Ms. Reno said today.</p>
        <p>House and Senate spending bills do not provide enough money to continue the lawsuit, Ms. Reno said.</p>
        <p>The suit, which is opposed by many Republicans and tobacco-state lawmakers, contends that the industry misled the government and the public about nicotine addiction, and marketed cigarettes to children.</p>
