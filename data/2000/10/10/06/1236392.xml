        <p>The smothering sense of solitariness gets to you from the very beginning, that feeling of being helplessly on your own within a crowd. There he stands, the leader of a nation, so confident, so brisk, so firm of purpose as he speaks to his supplicating subjects. And also, clearly, so very very alone. The saddest part is that he doesn't even seem to know how alone he is. He will before the evening is over, of course. His name is Oedipus.</p>
        <p>Few productions have so hauntingly conveyed the brutal isolation of those who would be king as the National Theater of Greece's exquisitely staged ''Oedipus Rex,'' directed by Vassilis Papavassileiou, which runs at City Center through Sunday and which this summer famously reopened the Roman Colosseum as a theatrical space for the first time in 1,500 years.</p>
        <p>This hypnotic re-creation of Sophocles's masterwork, a visually poetic staging that never sacrifices sense or feeling to style, examines the deepest wounds inflicted by the public exposure of private horrors.</p>
        <p>It is not just the humiliation of a proud man; it's the fact that, though there are many people nearby, there is no one there to grab his hand when he holds it out, a gesture repeated like a waning echo. Whether up or down in the cosmic pattern of reversing fortunes that shapes Sophocles's tragedy, this Oedipus is not to be touched.</p>
        <p>He is too godlike in his majesty; too contaminated in his sin and sorrow. It is, it turns out, lonely both at the top and at the bottom.</p>
        <p>A late word of advice to Messrs Gore and Bush: before you commit entirely to this idea of being president, you might want to take a look at the solemn spectacle at City Center, presented in a modern Greek translation by Mr. Papavassileiou with supertitles.</p>
        <p>The production expertly suggests how power makes freaks of those who wield it. And there is one more practical bit of counsel that, a few millenniums after the play was written, remains indispensable: be extremely careful about what you promise to your public.</p>
        <p>In Oedipus's case, that promise is to seek out and banish the man whose undetected crime has brought plague and famine to the city of Thebes. As any student of introductory Western literature knows, it is a boomerang of an edict.</p>
        <p>The promise is what makes ''Oedipus Rex'' the first and ultimate detective story, that of a man in simultaneous pursuit of an unknown criminal and his own identity. Our knowing already that the solution to both questions is the same doesn't necessarily dilute the tension, especially if we can be made to feel that we have something personal at stake.</p>
        <p>What Oedipus -- played by Grigoris Valtinos as a too, too human creature who physically inflates and deflates with the winds of fortune -- does is ask what he is. The answer, stripped to its baldest terms, applies to everyone: he is human, which means he is born to know suffering and to die.</p>
        <p>Mr. Papavassileiou's extraordinary achievement here is to convey the despair of a king whose destruction is particular to political circumstance, and at the same time to present a universal mirror as bleak and unsparing as Samuel Beckett's. Everything about the staging here emphasizes an impression of existence in a void. You feel those classic pangs of sorrow and pity before the production even begins.</p>
        <p>Clearly, the proscenium stage at City Center is not the Colosseum of Rome. Yet Yorgos Ziakas's set, as underscored by Antonis Panayotopoulos's lighting, still suggests claustrophobic confinement and an empty vastness. Dimitris Kamarotos's instrumental music mixes percussive anxiety with the wandering, lonely melodies of reed instruments.</p>
        <p>The audience entering the theater is greeted by a sight gag of sorts. Seven George Segal-style human statues in off-white monochromatic plaster and modern dress stand at the ready onstage. The dumb chorus prefigures the speaking one, which arrives in robes and half-masks that match the colors of the statues.</p>
        <p>This combination of the classic and the contemporary ingeniously scrambles expectations. The obvious choice would have been to put the statues in ancient costume and the actors in street clothes. Mr. Papavassileiou and Mr. Ziakas will pluck images throughout the millennia here, but never randomly. There is always method in the melange.</p>
        <p>This is evident early in the visual confusion of the living and the unmoving choruses. And when Oedipus arrives on stage, in rich colors and garb associated with by-the-book Shakespeare productions, the contrast to the pale shrouded figures around him is shocking.</p>
        <p>Mr. Valtinos stands erect, a single figure on a raked platform above the rest of the stage. The chorus is hunched, as by affliction, milling slowly with the aid of canes. The gap between man and mob is resonant. Before the end of the evening, in a sterling example of Mr. Papavassileiou's imagistic equivalents for the rhythmic patterns of the play, their postures will have been reversed.</p>
        <p>The use of the chorus throughout is inventive and eloquent, incorporating ancient traditional devices (like the ceremonial beating of poles) into a flowing movement that embodies the fluctuations of sentiment among the citizens of Thebes. Individual speakers intone lines that are taken up by others, sometimes mutating into chants and song. You know these people, fretting over the state of their nation, shifting between certainty and frightened cluelessness. Today's pollsters would also find them familiar.</p>
        <p>The chorus is the evening's most exciting aspect, a highly graceful use of an unavoidable element in classical tragedy, one most directors stumble over with arty self-consciousness. You come to feel like a member of that chorus, and you realize the safety valve this association provides. To identify too entirely with Oedipus, which Mr. Valtinos's performance makes a distinct possibility, would be too painful by half.</p>
        <p>The royal grandeur of the play's leading figures is tempered by their outsize ordinariness. Mr. Valtinos's Oedipus, Stephanos Kyriakidis's Creon and Jenny Gaitanopoulou's superb Jocasta suggest big-boned common folk, civilized barbarians, with a conquering spirit and determination that has thrust them into majesty.</p>
        <p>In the early scenes, Mr. Valtinos has the fierce and careful carriage of a man who feels he is quite up to the task of bearing the world on his shoulders. Even when he bows, as in supplication to the prophet Teiresias (Costas Galanakis), he bows like a king. He doesn't overplay the rage and arrogance; it is all implicit in his posture. He is scariest, in fact, when he radiates the feverish joy of a man on a hunt, the quarry of course being the secret that will destroy him.</p>
        <p>Oedipus and Jocasta's systematic accretion of knowledge is presented as a veering between anxiety and denial all too familiar to anyone awaiting news of a possibly grim medical diagnosis or of an accident involving a loved one. Mr. Papavassileiou mercifully leavens the tension with the arrival of the secret-solving shepherds (well played by Yannis Rozakis and Iakovos Psarras), who are cannily used in the manner of Shakespeare's comic rustics.</p>
        <p>He also knows exactly when to meld this brief, relieving flirtation with comedy into a more ominous tone, when Oedipus takes the whip to one of the messengers. The darkness is unstoppable after that, climaxing with the image of Oedipus transformed into a shrunken man (Mr. Valtinos miraculously appears to have shed many pounds backstage), now both of the masses he once ruled and a leper among them.</p>
        <p>The supertitles are, inevitably, an encumbrance, especially early in the production, when one is still in a skeptical frame of mind. There are a few laughably awkward translations, as when Teiresias ominously tells Oedipus, ''You sleep with your relatives.''</p>
        <p>But for the last quarter of the production's intermissionless two hours, this ungainliness has been erased by the emotional heat on the stage. One thinks particularly of the magnificent delivery of the description of Jocasta's suicide and Oedipus's self-blinding.</p>
        <p>The speech is performed by Themis Panou, who ascends slowly from the back of the stage in crouched posture, reluctant to give words to what he has seen. As he slowly works his way toward the audience, his back straightens and his voice acquires strength from his very revulsion.</p>
        <p>The moment I cannot shake off, however, occurs some moments earlier. At that point, Ms. Gaitanopoulou's Jocasta is center stage, looking out beyond the audience, listening to an innocent-seeming account of the discovery of an abandoned infant many years before, a story that confirms her worst apprehensions.</p>
        <p>The sequence of expressions that move across Ms. Gaitanopoulou's  face, from abrupt recognition to fear to existential nausea, is almost unbearable. It is the face of someone who realizes that life has no more comforts to offer. The truly horrifying lesson of ''Oedipus Rex,'' so disturbingly conveyed here, is that such revelations come to everyone who lives long enough.</p>
