        <p>Vojislav Kostunica had just made a rousing speech from the balcony of City Hall to several hundred thousand roaring supporters, who had just made him a revolution, and as he slouched in a leather chair, as aides and politicians rushed about, he had trouble believing that it was really his own life that was being transformed.</p>

        <p>Vojislav Kostunica had just made a rousing speech from the balcony of City Hall to several hundred thousand roaring supporters, who had just made him a revolution, and as he slouched in a leather chair, as aides and politicians rushed about, he had trouble believing that it was really his own life that was being transformed.</p>
        <p>''I could never have imagined this for myself,'' he said quietly in an interview, as those below shouted his name. ''First, to be in party politics and then suddenly elected to the highest position in the land, and also,'' he stopped, then laughed, ''to be in a way a very mild revolutionary.''</p>
        <p>Then he hardened a bit, leaning forward. ''I didn't want it this way. But there was no other way to defend democratic institutions and the people's will. There was no other possibility; we tried in every other way to get Slobodan Milosevic to recognize his defeat.''</p>
        <p>The smell of the burned and looted federal Parliament hung in the air across the park. ''At one moment, I feel sorry seeing all that is happening,'' he said. ''And on the other hand, we are coming closer to the end of our suffering.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kostunica (pronounced kosh-TOON-eet-zah), in his trademark gray suit, rumpled white shirt and simple tie, is 56 years old, a constitutional lawyer who spent much of his career in academic institutes.</p>
        <p>He was chosen by a fragile coalition of 18 opposition parties to run against Mr. Milosevic because of his polling figures: he is perceived by Serbs as one of their own -- a Serb from the heart of Serbia, unlike Mr. Milosevic, whose father hailed from Montenegro -- and he seems honest, uncorrupted and has an abiding and even mystical sense of Serbian nationhood.</p>
        <p>As important, he had never served in a Milosevic government or -- unlike other leaders of the Serbian opposition -- even talked with him.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Kostunica, who was reluctant until the very last moment to accept the opposition's nomination for the presidential elections on Sept. 24, has developed an extraordinary serenity and sense of mission over these past weeks of campaigning and quiet, but determined struggle.</p>
        <p>''What makes me calm,'' he said tonight, ''is that the people here trust in me, and those on the other side, in the Socialist Party, know I'm the safest option for them.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kostunica has pledged no revenge against those who served the old regime. He said tonight that he had no intention of arresting Mr. Milosevic, who was indicted for war crimes last year over the action of his security forces in Kosovo. When some in the crowd shouted, ''to Dedinje!'' the Belgrade suburb where Mr. Milosevic lives, he told them: ''No one is marching to Dedinje.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kostunica expected Mr. Milosevic to take one of the legal opportunities the opposition provided him to concede the momentous election held 11 days ago -- the first ballot in which Mr. Milosevic had stood for direct election since 1992.</p>
        <p>Despite some private wavering among his staff, Mr. Kostunica stuck to his principles, and refused to let Mr. Milosevic require a second-round runoff through vote stealing. But Mr. Kostunica also shied away from street confrontations, feeling grave responsibility for sending people against the police, said Zarko Korac, another opposition leader.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Korac, a psychologist, insisted in a private meeting with opposition leaders this week that the responsibility would rest with Mr. Milosevic for his election fraud, not with Mr. Kostunica. Still, Mr. Kostunica said, he did not expect today to turn into a revolt.</p>
        <p>Asked if today was a revolution, the man now broadly hailed as president of Yugoslavia hesitated. ''It's a democratic revolution,'' he finally said. ''When I always thought of what would be the revolution in this country, it was Tocqueville and his democratic revolution. That's what I had in mind. But I suppose this is a revolutionary way of defending the will of the people.''</p>
        <p>He said that he had made many efforts to establish contact with Mr. Milosevic, without success. But with the rage of the people today, the silence of the regime, its manipulation of the courts to annul the election result and the burning of the Parliament, legal compromise ran out of time, he said. ''Now too many steps have been taken to retreat, that's for sure,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''Milosevic tried his old tactics from 1996,'' when he delayed as protests built for three months, then finally gave in to the opposition's victory in local elections, saving his power. ''But now it's too late,'' Mr. Kostunica said, a touch wearily. ''He doesn't command matters here anymore.''</p>
        <p>His aides were beckoning. Other political leaders were waiting. He rose up, listening to whispers. He was told that the state media, television and the newspaper Politika, long a mouthpiece for Mr. Milosevic, now belonged to the opposition. He made arrangements to go to state television, to speak to the nation.</p>
        <p>Then he said, ''Politika is very important to us -- so go prepare the next edition of Politika.'' Aides dispersed, carrying out his orders. Only he seemed surprised.</p>
