      <abstract>
        <p>Jay W Shuffield letter on campaign debate between Al Gore and George W Bush; criticizes both for opposing use of US military force to protect lives and rights of people in oppressed countries; suggests military morale may be low because soldiers realize their role is just to protect American pocketbooks</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Watching the presidential debate on Tuesday night, I was disturbed by the way in which our prospective leaders viewed foreign policy (news article, Oct. 4). George W. Bush said the United States should intervene abroad only to protect its own interests. In other words, we should use the military if we have something to gain, but not to protect the lives and rights of those in oppressed countries.</p>
        <p>Al Gore's position leaned more toward intervening in cases of atrocities, but his stance was not firm on the point. He did not convey a willingness to argue strongly for sending troops to Yugoslavia to enforce democracy there.</p>

        <p>If morale in the military is low, it may be in part because it has come to realize that its role has become protecting American pocketbooks instead of upholding the principles of democracy on which our country prides itself.</p>
