        <p>WHILE several pinstriped employees on his $112 million payroll took batting practice or shagged balls in the outfield, George Steinbrenner wore a royal blue warm-up suit with a small white USA logo and white sneakers as he sat in the cloudy chill of the Yankee dugout.</p>
        <p>''I just came up from my workout in the hotel like this,'' the principal owner was saying. ''The older I get, the more serious I work out.''</p>
        <p>Just then, Joe Torre, in a Yankee jacket and pinstriped pants, emerged from the tunnel at the other end of the dugout. With a wide smile, the Yankee manager walked quickly toward his boss.</p>
        <p>''Seventeen-forty,'' Torre announced.</p>
        <p>One of the principal owner's racehorses, Granting, had won the ninth race at Belmont and paid $17.40.</p>
        <p>''I had $50 on him,'' Torre said, ''but Zim didn't bet him.''</p>
        <p>Don Zimmer, the Yankee coach who is never far from Torre's nearest ear during games, has been known to bet on a horse now and then. ''I can't wait,'' Steinbrenner said, laughing, ''to see the look on Zim's face when you tell him.''</p>
        <p>As the Yankees awaited tonight's pivotal third game of their American League division series with the Oakland Athletics, here was their sometimes tempestuous owner and their always outwardly calm manager talking about a race and the coach who didn't bet the winner.</p>
        <p>You would have thought the Yankees needed only two outs to advance to the American League Championship Series instead of needing two more victories.</p>
        <p>But that showed how one victory, by 4-0 on Wednesday night in Oakland, after eight consecutive losses, can alter the Yankee atmosphere.</p>
        <p>Steinbrenner, along with several other Yankee employees, had watched that game on television in the Yankee offices at the Stadium.</p>
        <p>''As soon as Luis Sojo got his feet tangled and fell down,'' he was saying now, ''I told everybody, 'That's the one thing that will be on the newsreels and the highlights.' I had never seen that happen before. And that Andy Pettitte, what heart he's developed. He's become a warrior.''</p>
        <p>Now, as Torre, out near the batting cage, was telling Zimmer about the $17.40 payoff, Steinbrenner talked about his manager.</p>
        <p>''Joe stuck his neck out,'' the principal owner recalled. ''He said, 'I take the blame,' '' meaning the blame for the 3-16 tailspin that included the 5-3 loss in the series opener. ''He's a helluva manager.''</p>
        <p>''Joe and Cash,'' he added, referring to Brian Cashman, the general manager, ''are a good combination.''</p>
        <p>Torre also stuck his neck out by juggling his lineup: benching designated-hitter Chuck Knoblauch, moving Derek Jeter to leadoff, keeping Sojo at second base and inserting Glenallen Hill into the batting order. In the sixth, Hill's run-scoring single preceded Sojo's two-run double.</p>
        <p>And when the Yankees won, snapping their slump, they were able to laugh about Sojo's pratfall. The slump had been the only continuing crisis in Torre's five seasons as manager, but outwardly he had appeared calm.</p>
        <p>''I try to be,'' he had said.</p>
        <p>To keep the players calm?</p>
        <p>''Yes. The only thing I'll do with them is go around just to let them know I support them. Let them know what they're going through. I may refer to my 1982 Braves team in Atlanta; we lost 19 out of 21 games, then what happened. Pascual Perez got lost coming to the ballpark, and we won 15 out of 20. You explain it. That's not good managing, just strange happenings.</p>
        <p>''If something like what happened to Luis had happened two weeks ago, it may have broken it right there. We needed something like that. There was a lot of tension because the guys sensed they wanted to get it over with. They were tired, and they were tense. It's something I never really went through before, because we really weren't threatened to lose the whole thing.</p>
        <p>''I remember when David Cone asked me, 'What do you want to do if Boston loses and we clinch?' I said: 'We're going to pour Champagne. We still won more games than anybody else and I think this team needs it.' In the meeting before that game, I asked the players, 'Do you want to drink this Champagne before the game or after?' It may help before more than after.</p>
        <p>''You try to lighten it up. You didn't get many smiles because everybody knew what they had to do. I was happy when the postseason got here because it was pressure, but pressure of a different kind.''</p>
        <p>And with Wednesday night's victory that tied the series and ended the losing streak, the pressure suddenly was off, at least temporarily. Out near the batting cage now, the Yankees' principal owner was smiling and laughing in his 20-minute conversation with the manager and the bench coach.</p>
        <p>''I want to go out there,'' the principal owner had said as he hopped up the dugout steps, ''and ask Zim how much he had on the horse.''</p>
