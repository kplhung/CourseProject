        <p>The National Hockey League's 2000-2001 season opened with one game Wednesday night, picked up steam last night and gets into full swing this weekend. Here's a look at how the season may go, with teams listed in the predicted order of finish.</p>
        <p>Atlantic Division</p>
        <p>Devils (103 points last season, second in conference)  The deepest organization in the league, led by the shrewdest general manager, Lou Lamoriello. The defending Stanley Cup champions, who are still without a pair of unsigned team leaders, Jason Arnott and Scott Niedermayer, remember 1996, when they failed to qualify for the playoffs the year after winning their first Cup.</p>

        <p>The National Hockey League's 2000-2001 season opened with one game Wednesday night, picked up steam last night and gets into full swing this weekend. Here's a look at how the season may go, with teams listed in the predicted order of finish.</p>
        <p>Atlantic Division</p>
        <p>Devils (103 points last season, second in conference)  The deepest organization in the league, led by the shrewdest general manager, Lou Lamoriello. The defending Stanley Cup champions, who are still without a pair of unsigned team leaders, Jason Arnott and Scott Niedermayer, remember 1996, when they failed to qualify for the playoffs the year after winning their first Cup.</p>
        <p>Philadelphia (105 points last season, first in conference)  They made it to within one game of the Stanley Cup finals last season before being overtaken by the Devils. Now, the Flyers begin an era without Eric Lindros. With goalie Brian Boucher, and tough forwards Keith Primeau and John LeClair, they are still a force to be reckoned with.</p>
        <p>Pittsburgh (88 points last season, seventh in conference)  The Penguins have the league's best player in Jaromir Jagr. They also lead the league in people of Czech heritage, including their new coach, Ivan Hlinka.</p>
        <p>Rangers (73 points last season, 11th in conference)  Mark Messier is back, but the question on Broadway is whether his presence will be enough to avert a fourth consecutive playoff-less spring at Madison Square Garden.</p>
        <p>Islanders (58 points last season, 13th in conference)  For the first time in nearly a decade, there is some genuine hope emanating out of Long Island. The Islanders are young and improving, but may be a year away from both their first postseason appearance since 1994, and from the debut of goalie Rick DiPietro, the No. 1 overall choice in this year's draft.</p>
        <p>Southeast Division</p>
        <p>Florida (98 points last season, fifth in conference)  Bill Torrey brought in Pavel Bure, the league's most exciting player, to help raise interest in hockey in Southeast Florida. Bure responded last season by leading the league in goals with 58.</p>
        <p>Washington (102 points last season, third in conference)  Peter Bondra, the team's best scoring threat, is unhappy about his contract and wants out. Nevertheless, General Manager George McPhee has built a strong organization in the nation's capital, even if Coach Ron Wilson's trapping style is about as boring as hockey can get.</p>
        <p>Tampa Bay (54 points last season, 14th in conference)  In young Vincent Lecavalier, who netted 25 goals at age 19 last season, the Lightning has a young superstar to build around.</p>
        <p>Carolina (84 points last season, ninth in conference)  Owner Peter Karmanos has his new building in Raleigh. But in this case, when you build it, no one comes. Karmanos probably wishes he never had left Hartford. Because, in Carolina thus far, hockey has not caught on.</p>
        <p>Atlanta (39 points last season, 15th in conference)  The second-year Thrashers are light years away from contention for a playoff spot. They could end up with a worse record this season than the expansion Blue Jackets.</p>
        <p>Northeast Division</p>
        <p>Toronto (100 points last season, fourth in conference)  The Leafs have come close the last two seasons, but are still looking for their first Stanley Cup since 1967. Having the brilliant Curtis Joseph in goal allows Toronto to play an appealing run-and-gun style.</p>
        <p>Ottawa (95 points last season, sixth in conference)  The Senators went nowhere in the playoffs two seasons ago with Alexei Yashin, nowhere in the playoffs last season without Alexei Yashin. Yashin now returns, to jeers across Canada, after losing a bitter holdout battle. The question is, how long will he be with Ottawa?</p>
        <p>Buffalo (85 points last season, eighth in conference)  The Sabres only go as far as goalie Dominik Hasek takes them. If this is truly Hasek's last season, he -- and Doug Gilmour, who figures to retire next summer, as well -- could ignite the Sabres on a long playoff run.</p>
        <p>Boston (73 points last season, 12th in conference)  For the first time in two decades, Raymond Bourque is not wearing a Bruins sweater. The Bruins, who were decimated by injuries last season, need a healthy Jason Allison and a happy Anson Carter, as well as a breakthrough season from Joe Thornton, to contend for a playoff berth.</p>
        <p>Montreal (83 points last season, 10th in conference)  Is nothing sacred? The Canadiens are up for sale. This season, however, they will have a hard time buying goals.</p>
        <p>Pacific Division</p>
        <p>Dallas (102 points last season, third in conference)  Like the Wings, the Stars are not getting any younger. They have represented the West in the Cup finals the last two seasons and should win their division again. But, after winning it all two seasons ago, and then making the Devils endure five overtimes in the final two games of last season's finals, the Stars could be in decline by the time spring arrives.</p>
        <p>San Jose (87 points last season, eighth in conference)  The Sharks have never finished a regular season with a winning record. But, as their first-round upset of St. Louis in last season's playoffs proved again, they are always capable of making noise in the postseason. If Owen Nolan (44 goals) ever comes to terms, the Sharks might have both their first winning season and a good playoff seeding.</p>
        <p>Los Angeles (94 points last season, fifth in conference)  One Western Conference general manager described the Kings as one of the conference's up-and-coming teams. Former Islanders star Ziggy Palffy undertook an off-season conditioning program and should improve on his 27 goals last season. Goaltending is still a question mark, however.</p>
        <p>Phoenix (90 points last season, sixth in conference)  Will Wayne Gretzky ever take the reigns of the Coyotes? Or are they a year away from moving to Paul Allen's Rose Garden rink in Portland, Ore? On goes the soap opera in Phoenix, where Gretzky is not allowed to even enter the team's building -- the made-for-basketball America West Arena -- until the sale of the team goes through.</p>
        <p>Anaheim (83 points last season, ninth in conference)  Once again, the Ducks have Paul Kariya and Teemu Selanne - and not much else. Unless Disney decides to open up the vault and brings in some players to complement the league's most exciting tandem, life will only get tougher for a team in hockey's strongest division.</p>
        <p>Central Division</p>
        <p>St. Louis (114 points last season, first in conference)  The Blues added Dallas Drake up front and Sean Hill on defense to a roster that last season produced the best regular-season record in the league. In his second year as the No. 1 goalie, Roman Turek will find a way to get the Blues past the first round of the playoffs. The definite favorite this season to win the Stanley Cup for the first time in franchise history.</p>
        <p>Detroit (108 points last season, second in conference)  Wine gets better with age, professional sports teams usually don't. The Wings are still a top-level team, but their era has probably passed. The incomparable Scotty Bowman returns at age 67 for his 29th season behind an N.H.L. bench.</p>
        <p>Chicago (78 points last season, 11th in conference)  Alpo Suhonen of Finland joins Ivan Hlinka of the Czech Republic as the first two European head coaches in league history. The Blackhawks, who are staring at a fourth consecutive spring without the playoffs, would probably have a tough time this season in the Finnish League.</p>
        <p>Nashville (70 points last season, 13th in conference)  Predators Coach Barry Trotz grew up in the same Manitoba town that Rangers Coach Ron Low and Islanders Coach Butch Goring did. The Predators have the best two-year record of any expansion team in the 1990's. But they appear to be one season away from playing in their first N.H.L. playoff game.</p>
        <p>Columbus (expansion team)  Can hockey thrive in a college football town? The Blue Jackets have already sold out their inaugural season. But the highlights could be few and far between.</p>
        <p>Northwest Division</p>
        <p>Colorado (96 points last season, fourth in conference)  Raymond Bourque again fell short in his quest for the first Stanley Cup of his career. The Avalanche lost in the Western Conference finals, with a Bourque shot ringing off the post in the waning seconds of the last game. It would have been the tying goal. Still, Bourque chose to return to the Rocky Mountains. And with Peter Forsberg healthy up front, maybe Borque will get the Cup this time.</p>
        <p>Edmonton (88 points last season, seventh in conference)  Kevin Lowe succeeds Glen Sather in the front office. Craig MacTavish succeeds Lowe behind the Oilers' bench. The talent is there to compete for the playoffs. The money is not there for the Oilers to make a serious Cup run. That has been the story in Edmonton for a decade, which is one of the main reasons why Sather is now in New York.</p>
        <p>Vancouver (83 points last season, 10th in conference)  The Canucks may have been the best team in the league after the All-Star break last season, but still couldn't make the playhoffs. And now, Mark Messier is gone, leaving no one to be a tough tutor for the highly touted Sedin twins, Henrik and Daniel.</p>
        <p>Calgary (77 points last season, 12th in conference)  General Manager Al Coates and Coach Brian Sutter took the fall last season after the Flames missed out on the playoffs for the third consecutive year. But was it their fault that the Flames have no money? Before hiring Don Hay as the new coach, the new general manager, Craig Button, actually considered rehiring Sutter.</p>
        <p>Minnesota (expansion team)  The only thing wild about the Wild this season might turn out to be the lawsuit leveled against them by the World Wildlife Federation over use of the word ''wild.'' The great Jacques Lemaire finally returns to coaching. Expect the Wild to trap.</p>
