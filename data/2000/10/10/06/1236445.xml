        <p>For the first time in eight years, Italian-Americans in the Denver area are organizing a Columbus Day parade, scheduled for downtown on Saturday. But the plans have met with such resistance from groups opposed to celebrating Columbus that Gov. Bill Owens says National Guard units will be available to assist the police if protests turn violent.</p>
        <p>After four protesters were arrested at the last such parade, in 1991, and fears of violence caused the 1992 event to be canceled minutes before it was to begin, organizers abandoned efforts to obtain permits.</p>
        <p>Now, they say, the time has come to stop bowing to threats and protests over the historical role of Columbus, denounced by American Indians, and by large numbers of Hispanics who trace their ancestry to the Indians, as an enslaver and murderer of many native people he encountered.</p>
        <p>The organizers and protest groups reached an agreement with the city last month that would have allowed a March for Italian Pride, without references to Columbus; opposition groups promised they would do nothing to interfere.</p>
        <p>But several days later, parade organizers backed out of the deal, saying they were entitled to celebrate anything they wanted, a position supported by the Denver branch of the American Civil Liberties Union.</p>
        <p>''I want to say what I want to say -- that's our legal right,'' one organizer, Carlo Mangiarcina, said in an interview.</p>
        <p>Organizers say they signed the agreement in the first place only because they feared that the city would rescind the parade permit if they did not. Municipal officials have since affirmed a right of the marchers to celebrate as they choose.</p>
        <p>The dispute has now heated up considerably, with protesters accusing organizers of insensitivity and organizers accusing protesters of planning to incite violence. The organizers say they expect 1,400 people to participate in the parade, and their opponents predict that a thousand or more protesters will line the route. City officials have vowed to have ample police officers on hand to maintain peace.</p>
        <p>Although the battle over Columbus has been joined elsewhere as well,  other cities and some states have negotiated solutions that satisfy both sides. For example, Alabama, like the country as a whole, celebrates the second Monday in October as Columbus Day, but it also makes that day American Indian Heritage Day. South Dakota celebrates Columbus Day as Native American Day, too.</p>
        <p>With no such accommodation here, leaders on both sides have hardened in their positions. Vernon Bellecourt, a leader of the American Indian Movement, calls Columbus ''a colonial pirate murderer'' responsible for vast genocide.</p>
        <p>''For Indian Americans,'' Mr. Bellecourt said, ''celebrating and glorifying Columbus with a parade would be for Jewish people as if German-Americans celebrated an Adolf Hitler Day. It would be an affront to them; it's an affront to us.''</p>
        <p>Organizers say that atrocities by the European explorers are largely overstated and that in any event Columbus should not be singled out as responsible for them. Mr. Mangiarcina called Indian leaders who are organizing protests ''architects of hatred.'' He cited remarks by another American Indian Movement leader, Russell Means, who said here this week that he intended to be at the parade with his two sons, ages 15 and 9, and that ''if they lay a hand on my children when I'm protesting, then it's war.''</p>
        <p>Cahuilla Red Elk, one of the four people arrested at the parade nine years ago, said the protesters did not intend any violence this weekend. ''But,'' she said, ''there is always that potential any time something like this comes up.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mangiarcina said he had discussed with marchers the possibility that spectators might spit or throw things at them, or curse them.</p>
        <p>''We intend to keep the matter peaceful on our side,'' he said. ''If they want to act the fool, then act the fool. We will not respond.''</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, in the latest effort to bridge differences, Mayor Wellington Webb urged the two sides to meet with spiritual leaders to try to reach a compromise. ''My hope,'' Mr. Webb said in an interview, ''is that both parties would sit down as a way to seek common ground so we don't have disruptions in the city.''</p>
        <p>In any case, beyond the sufficient personnel that police officials have vowed to make available, Governor Owens promised added support if necessary.</p>
        <p>''I think the city needs to stay between those two groups and make sure that each group's right to free speech is protected,'' he said. ''The peace needs to be maintained.''</p>
