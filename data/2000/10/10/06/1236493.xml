        <p>New Jersey state gaming officials recommended sweeping changes yesterday in the way boxers, managers and promoters are licensed in the state, in the wake of a federal investigation into bribes for boxing rankings and the death last year of a Brooklyn fighter with an unclear medical history.</p>
        <p>To underscore their determination to clean up boxing in New Jersey, the state attorney general and gambling regulators also moved to strip two major promoters -- Bob Arum and Cedric Kushner -- of their licenses to stage fights in Atlantic City casinos.</p>
        <p>Arum and Kushner testified during a federal trial in Newark last summer that they had made payoffs to officials of the International Boxing Federation, a sanctioning organization, to influence its rankings. The promoters, who were called as witnesses by federal prosecutors, were not charged with any crime.</p>
        <p>''We felt it was unconscionable to let them continue in New Jersey,'' Attorney General John J. Farmer Jr. said at a news conference yesterday at the Red Brick Gym in Newark.</p>
        <p>Gaming officials also released a 68-page report on the State Athletic Control Board that includes a raft of proposals to overhaul the board's oversight of boxing, by tightening licensing procedures and keeping injured boxers out of the ring. The board is expected to enact the changes in short order, Farmer said.</p>
        <p>The changes were prompted by the death at age 31 of Stephan Johnson, a journeyman fighter from Brooklyn, who died last December, 15 days after being knocked down late in a bout with Paul Vaden.</p>
        <p>The report revealed several new details about Johnson's death. It said, for instance, that Johnson had not disclosed on his application for a New Jersey license that he had recently been knocked out in Canada and that he had been suspended there. It also said that the boxing official who reviewed a CAT scan of Johnson's brain was not a doctor and that the ringside physician was never shown the CAT scan report, which noted some abnormalities and recommended further study.</p>
        <p>''There was a confluence of events, a number of bad circumstances, that led to someone slipping through that could have been caught,'' said John Peter Suarez, the director of the State Division of Gaming Enforcement.</p>
        <p>Part of the blame for Johnson's death stems from the athletic board's chaotic procedures for licensing fighters, the report said. It noted that boxers often waited until the weigh-in the day before a fight to complete the application and submit required medical tests.</p>
        <p>''The problem with this process is obvious: regulatory officials are required to make licensing decisions at the last minute, sometimes with incomplete information,'' the report said.</p>
        <p>Among other things, the proposed new rules would require promoters and managers to submit vital information about a fighter and his medical history to boxing regulators at least seven days before a bout and to certify that he is not under suspension in another state. Managers would also be required to sign the application, vouching that all questions had been answered accurately.</p>
        <p>On the medical side, the proposed rules would require medical tests to be submitted at least two days before a bout and turned over immediately to a doctor. The doctor would have to file a written report about the tests and report any possible problems to a medical review board. The proposed rules would also mandate that the boxing commissioner contact officials in other states in which a boxer had been knocked out to find out more about the fighter's fitness.</p>
        <p>Johnson did send his CAT scan results to New Jersey officials 45 days before his fight, but he did not complete his application form until the weigh-in, the report said. He left blank questions on whether he had been suspended elsewhere, even though Canadian officials had still not given him a clean bill of health.</p>
        <p>The CAT scan Johnson submitted had been performed in April 1999, two days after he had fainted in the ring while fighting Fitz Vanderpool in Toronto. The New Jersey official who reviewed his CAT scan report and interpreted it as normal had no medical training, the report said.</p>
        <p>''Although the CAT scan report is admittedly ambiguous, and does not expressly state that Johnson should not fight, it nonetheless provided the potential first glimpse of a more serious condition,'' the report said.</p>
        <p>The move to strip Arum and Kushner of their licenses is another prong in the push to clean up the sport, state officials said. If the Casino Control Commission decides to revoke their licenses, the promoters would be barred from staging fights at the casinos for at least five years. Gaming officials are also asking the Athletic Control Board to deny both men promoter's licenses this year.</p>
        <p>Arum, who operates Top Rank in Las Vegas, testified as a government witness in June about making a $100,000 payoff to Robert Lee Sr., the I.B.F. president, so the organization would sanction a title fight between Arum's boxer, George Foreman, and an unranked German, Axel Schulz.</p>
        <p>The jury ultimately acquitted Lee of major bribery and racketeering charges, but convicted him on lesser counts, including money laundering and tax evasion.</p>
        <p>''It seems extraordinary that they go after people who cooperate with the federal government, and people whose names are all over the record as having repeatedly done similar things are not questioned,'' Arum said yesterday of the proposal to revoke his license.</p>
        <p>Kushner told the federal jury he had made payments of $2,500 to $10,000 to I.B.F. officials several times a year between 1987 and 1994, as well as a $100,000 payoff in 1995 for the I.B.F. to order a rematch after Foreman beat Schulz, whom Kushner helped to promote. He did not return a message left at his office yesterday.</p>
