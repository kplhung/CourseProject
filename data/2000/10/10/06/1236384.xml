        <p>Two Ellen Burstyns can be seen on New York screens this week. There is the 1973 Ellen Burstyn, starring in ''The Exorcist: The Version You've Never Seen,'' a reissue of the horror classic with scenes restored by the film's screenwriter, William Peter Blatty. And then there is the Ellen Burstyn of 2000, starring in a different kind of horror movie: ''Requiem for a Dream,'' a tough-minded independent film about a Brighton Beach boy (Jared Leto) and his house-bound mother (Ms. Burstyn), who become involved with drugs in different but equally dangerous ways (review, Page 27).</p>
        <p>It is the work of Darren Aronofsky, who made an impressive debut with ''Pi'' in 1998. Unlike ''The Exorcist,'' this movie shows Ms. Burstyn becoming a monster as she grows addicted to diet pills.</p>
        <p>To provide a visual correlation to her character's initial blossoming and subsequent collapse, Ms. Burstyn brought in her longtime hairdresser, Paul LeBlanc, and had him make some sketches. ''As soon as Darren saw them, he said, 'Go, do it!' '' she said. ''He gave Paul full range to do all of those wild hairdos.  Those were very radical concepts.  Paul actually had flames coming out of my head.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Burstyn received an Oscar nomination for ''The Exorcist'' and won an Oscar for ''Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore'' in 1975. There is already talk of a nomination for ''Requiem,'' but Ms. Burstyn, who is also appearing in a CBS drama, ''That's Life,'' says she finds job satisfaction in things other than awards. ''There are moments when I'm acting -- when I'm doing my work, let's say -- onstage and on film, where 'it' happens,'' she said. ''And when 'it' happens, I'm just taking a ride. I'm not doing it. When that happens I can feel the force coming through me, and I know for sure I'm channeling it.</p>
        <p>''You know how I think of it? Van Gogh's painting 'Starry Night,' and the church is down here, about this big in the painting. And there's this little tiny spire sticking up into all of this energy up in the sky -- the stars and the cosmos and everything that's going on up there. And we're down here. It's like the church is our little teeny attempt to penetrate and call to and understand these enormous forces.''</p>
        <p>''It seems to me that any kind of artist, a skilled artist, learns the way to open so that you can be a receptor and a sender of those forces,'' Ms. Burstyn said. ''But you do feel it go through you. And when that happens, it's so humbling, it's such a blessing.  And that's what I'm always working for. Once I felt that, I wanted it to happen all the time. Sarah Bernhardt used to say when it happened to her, when she came off the stage, 'God was there tonight.' That's an intoxication.</p>
        <p>''It happened three times during this movie.''</p>
        <p>Learning on the Job</p>
        <p>If John Turturro seems a little peaked, it's understandable. It's been a busy year, even by the standards of this hard-working performer.</p>
        <p>After directing his own film in 1998, ''Illuminata,'' and spending months on the off-and-on shoot of Tim Robbins's ''Cradle Will Rock,'' Mr. Turturro said, he realized: ''I'm going to have to go back to work and support my family. I kept looking around, reading things. Usually when you want to do that, there isn't a lot. But then what happened was that all the things I was interested in were suddenly financed or mostly financed.'' And suddenly Mr. Turturro found himself committed to five films in a row.</p>
        <p>''Normally, I'll do one or two films a year if I'm acting. But five's like, too much.'' But Mr. Turturro survived the experience, even turning it to his advantage. ''The whole year I kept learning new things, going from being a strait-laced guy to a Mississippi guy to being a Russian chess player. That's how I ate lunch: learning the dialect for the next thing. In some ways, it was like being back at Yale Drama School. You would be studying Ibsen or Strindberg and then at night you would be in a cabaret.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Turturro first signed up for ''2000 and None,'' a Canadian comedy to be directed by Arto Paragamian, a first-time director, in which he would play an Armenian paleontologist dying of a rare brain disease.  While he was waiting for that script, he did a role for a director friend, Doug McGrath, in the political farce ''Company Man.''</p>
        <p>Once ''2000 and None'' wrapped in Montreal he went straight to Mississippi and had his head shaved for his part as a fugitive from a chain gang in Joel and Ethan Coen's Depression comedy, ''O Brother, Where Art Thou?''</p>
        <p>''I literally didn't know where I was for a few hours,'' Mr. Turturro said. ''Thank God I was with the Coens, who I know really well.''</p>
        <p>From Mississippi, Mr. Turturro flew to Paris, where he played an Italian tenor with Fascist leanings in ''The Man Who Cried,'' a drama by  Sally Potter (who wrote, directed and starred in ''The Tango Lesson'').  After a two-week break home in New York, he returned to Europe to shoot ''The Luzhin Defense'' for the director Marleen Gorris (''Antonia's Line''); the film is based on Nabokov's story of an eccentric chess genius.</p>
        <p>''Did you see 'The Luzhin Defense,' how tired I was by the end?''  he said. ''I wasn't acting anymore. I really was sort of a basket case.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Turturro is making the festival rounds on behalf of the lighthearted ''2000 and None,'' which is still seeking an American distributor. In spite of its subject, imminent death, Mr. Turturro said: ''This was fun. I was curious to see if you could find the right tone for something like that. It was a very elusive thing, because you couldn't underpack it or overpack it. When you're doing it, you can't think about whether or not it's going to be funny, though somewhere in the back of your brain you know it could be.''</p>
        <p>''In retrospect, it was a really good year, in terms of playing all kinds of different parts,'' Mr. Turturro concluded. But right now, he's ready for some sleep.</p>
