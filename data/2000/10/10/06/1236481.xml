        <p>For decades The Salt Lake City Tribune has been the largest newspaper in Utah without a connection to the Mormon church. Now the news of talks between a Mormon-owned newspaper company and The Tribune's corporate parent have raised fears inside The Tribune that its independent voice could be eroded.</p>
        <p>The dispute involves an unusual cast of characters, including AT&amp;T -- which owns The Tribune through one of its subsidiaries -- as well as Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, who became tangentially involved when executives of the church-owned newspaper sought advice from Mr. Hatch, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, on the antitrust implications of their plans.</p>
        <p>The Deseret News, an afternoon paper in Utah owned by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, had held discussions with AT&amp;T about buying the telecommunications company's 50 percent stake in a joint venture that manages the advertising, printing and distribution operations for both papers, according to people close to the talks.</p>
        <p>The acquisition talks have worried some executives of the Salt Lake Tribune Publishing Company, which controls the editorial operations of The Tribune under a contract with AT&amp;T, because they believe that their church-owned rival may be looking for a backdoor way to exercise editorial control over material the Mormon Church leaders may consider offensive.</p>
        <p>''They are finding any way they can to get control of the paper so they can get control of the media in the state,'' said Thomas Kearns McCarthey, a great-grandson of Thomas Kearns, who bought The Tribune in 1901. Mr. McCarthey is currently a director of the Salt Lake Tribune Publishing Company.</p>
        <p>Executives of the Deseret News Publishing Company, however, strongly deny they have any ambition to control the content of their competitor; all they seek, they say, is a chance for The News to compete head to head with The Tribune for morning readers.</p>
        <p>Whatever the point of the battle, economic or editorial, the battleground is the joint agency that runs the noneditorial functions of both newspapers.</p>
        <p>The News denies that it is now seeking control of The Tribune, but it does not deny that it once explored seeking control of the joint operational venture. L. Glen Snarr, chairman and president of the Deseret News Publishing Company, issued a statement yesterday saying, ''Contrary to some media reports, the Deseret News Publishing company is not seeking in any way to control, own or interfere with the voice and content of The Salt Lake Tribune.''</p>
        <p>He added: ''The Deseret News supports having two newspapers under separate ownership serving the community. We are not attempting to change that situation.''</p>
        <p>An executive at AT&amp;T, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the company hoped to resolve the situation soon and would probably sell its entire stake back to The Tribune's management if several financial issues could be agreed upon.</p>
        <p>If a deal is not struck, The News could win control of the joint operational agreement, this person said, though it would ultimately lower the value of The Tribune's editorial operations.</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman for AT&amp;T said The Tribune is not a core asset, but declined to comment on a pending sale, citing AT&amp;T's policy not to comment on speculation about mergers, acquisitions or divestitures.</p>
        <p>While both papers have coexisted in their joint venture for decades, longtime trends have weakened afternoon newspapers like The News and have often bred tension between newspaper partners in joint operating agreements across the country. These agreements, which first cropped up seven decades ago and were legally sanctioned by Congress in 1970, allow competing newspapers to merge advertising, printing and distribution operations while maintaining separate editorial voices. The Justice Department still approves the creation and dissolution of joint operating agreements for newspapers.</p>
        <p>As afternoon newspapers lose circulation, they have become unequal partners in joint operating agreements. Some, like The Seattle Times, shifted to morning publication; some ceased publication; and some bought out, closed and replaced their morning rivals. The News, with a circulation of 65,000 -- about half that of the morning Tribune's 135,000 -- wants to move to morning publication, its executives say, to compete on a level playing field. Changing to a morning publication is a main reason The News is interested in fully controlling the printing and distribution operations.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Snarr of The News and B. Lloyd Poelman, its lawyer, confirmed that it has been in talks --  first with Tele-Communications Inc. and subsequently with AT&amp;T after the telecommunications giant acquired control in 1997 -- about control of the assets of the Newspaper Agency Corporation, the agency that publishes the two newspapers jointly. ''We've had some discussions, yes,'' Mr. Snarr said, ''we were looking at purchase of some business assets without any effort to control the voice of The Tribune or control the editing.'' He said the assets in question ''included the N.A.C.,'' referring to the Newspaper Agency Corporation, but that those talks ended in 1999.</p>
        <p>In the course of the talks, Mr. Poelman said, he attended a meeting late in 1999 at which Utah's senior Republican senator, Mr. Hatch, was briefed on these discussions. Senator Hatch had no comment on the issue yesterday. Christopher Rosche, his communications director, said: ''Senator Hatch is not involved in any negotiations if they are taking place. He was never been involved in any negotiations that may have been taking place.''</p>
        <p>His only involvement, Mr. Rosche said, was to reply to constituents seeking advice on antitrust provisions of their plans.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCarthey, a non-Mormon, said he had economic as well as editorial interests in the fight. He and his siblings and cousins are owner-directors of the Salt Lake City Tribune Publishing Company, which has a contract to manage The Tribune's editorial operations and has an option to buy back control of the newspaper -- and its 50 percent share of the joint operating agreement -- in the summer of 2002. At current market values, he said, that would cost them $175 million.</p>
