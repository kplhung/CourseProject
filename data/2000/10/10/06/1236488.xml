        <p>New owners, new players, a new sense of optimism -- call them the renewed New York Islanders.</p>
        <p>The team has spent the past six seasons putting together the longest postseason drought in the National Hockey League, all the while bouncing from owner to owner to owner in perhaps the worst arena in the league. But the 2000-2001 Islanders are determined to be different.</p>
        <p>''The only thing more exciting than the first game of the season,'' said defenseman Kevin Haller before the team boarded a charter flight for tonight's opener in Tampa, ''is the first game of the playoffs.''</p>
        <p>Yes, the Islanders are talking playoffs. And for a change, no one is laughing.</p>
        <p>''The start of the season is always exciting,'' defenseman Garry Galley said. ''It's the start of something you hope will be special. Hopefully, we can get off to a fast start. I truly believe we are poised to do that.''</p>
        <p>The Islanders are still in the relic known as Nassau Coliseum, but the team owners, Charles Wang and Sanjay Kumar, are moving forward: redoing the locker room, chartering flights instead of going commercial, and, most important, increasing the payroll from $15.5 million to $25 million.</p>
        <p>Fan response has been significant. Season ticket sales are up from 3,500 to 6,000 -- a league low, but still, an improvement. The big question is, can the team improve? Last season, the Islanders won just 24 games. They were close in a lot of other games. They won just 3 of the 37 games in which they were trailing after the first period.</p>
        <p>But over the summer, General Manager Mike Milbury grafted a handful of veterans onto the big, fast and youthful Islanders, notably goaltender John Vanbiesbrouck, the former Ranger who spent last season with the Flyers (25-15-9 with a 2.20 goals against average).</p>
        <p>Vanbiesbrouck, 37, almost instantly stepped into a leadership role when he spoke up on behalf of the holdouts Zdeno Chara and Brad Isbister during training camp. Vanbiesbrouck, acquired after the drafting of 18-year-old Rick DiPietro and the trades of Kevin Weekes and Roberto Luongo, will be backed up by Wade Flaherty.</p>
        <p>A good portion of the increased payroll was spent on the blue line, with the acquisitions of the two-time All-Star Roman Hamrlik, 17-year veteran Galley and Haller, entering his 12th season. The three will be teamed with the captain Kenny Jonsson, who is coming off a subpar year with one power-play goal, the 6-foot-9-inch Zdeno Chara and, when he gets back in four weeks from a broken thumb, 6-6 Eric Cairns.</p>
        <p>Yevgeny Korolev and Aris Brimanis round out the defense, which may be the team's strength. That is a good thing, too, as the team's young forwards have not shown much in the way of offense through a 0-5-1 preseason. As forward Mark Parrish put it: ''We're going to have to throw up the Great Wall of China on defense if we're only scoring one goal per game.''</p>
        <p>Parrish, who had 50 goals his first two seasons but has struggled through the preseason, is joining wing Mariusz Czerkawski, who had an All-Star season last year with 35 goals, including 16 power-play goals. Czerkawski, challenged at the beginning of last season by Coach Butch Goring to become a more complete player, has skated well in exhibition.</p>
        <p>The three keys to a playoff push for the Islanders are goaltending, special teams and a quick start to the season. The Islanders face just two playoff teams in their first nine games, and need to be much better than last year's 2-6-1 record in October.</p>
        <p>But they need to score goals to do so. Last year, only Atlanta (170) scored fewer goals than the Islanders, who had 194. The most frustrating thing as the season begins has been the power play. Last season, the Islanders ranked 23rd in the league on the power play with 45 goals in 320 chances. In the preseason, the Islanders have mustered but 3 power-play goals in 43 chances.</p>
        <p>''Our forwards are young but they're capable,'' Goring said. ''We have good goaltending and a solid defense. The important thing is that we improve.''</p>
        <p>Will they improve the 30 points or so it will take to make the playoffs?</p>
        <p>''If we score 90 points and don't make the playoffs, then we've improved,'' Goring said. ''If we score 58 points, then I'll be upset because we didn't improve. But I know we're better than we were last year.''</p>
