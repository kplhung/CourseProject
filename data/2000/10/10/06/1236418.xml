        <p>''I have spent a lifetime listening to 'I don't understand,' '' Orson Welles complains as the narrator of his own life story, the deconstructed subject of ''War of the Worlds'' at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. ''It's as plain as day. It's about the frame, you see. It's all about the frame.''</p>
        <p>The production, the first offering of this season's Next Wave Festival, was created by the SITI company and conceived and directed by its artistic director, Anne Bogart, with a script by Naomi Iizuka, and it is full of frames, both literal and figurative.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the worlds of the title (taken, of course, from Welles's famous radio adaptation of the H. G. Wells novel, whose broadcast in 1938 caused panic in the streets) are those of perception. Welles -- the prodigiously gifted filmmaker who spent a lifetime chased by creative demons after his first film, ''Citizen Kane,'' marked him, for good and ill, as a genius -- was a legendary enigma, a proud dissembler who repeatedly declared the connection between his art and his life to be irrelevant. ''War of the Worlds,'' an unwieldy, often fascinating but finally uncertain examination of his life, probes that principle relentlessly. What is revealed about a situation, a story, a life, and what is outside the frame? What is partial truth and what is, well, true?</p>
        <p>Ms. Bogart has conceived a production that is complex both visually and narratively, as a story within a story within a story. The outermost frame is provided by Welles himself, played by the actor Stephen Webber. Suggestively rendering Welles's stentorian voice and his lumbering swagger, the scent of his ever-present cigar wafting out into the house, Mr. Webber appears as both narrator of this biography and its central character.</p>
        <p>His manner of storytelling is Ms. Bogart's chief gimmick, and it is a marvelous one, as she has Welles borrow from his own oeuvre, presenting the life of Welles as Welles presented the life, or so it is widely presumed, of William Randolph Hearst in ''Citizen Kane.''</p>
        <p>The bulk of the show consists of witty adaptations of many of the movie's memorable scenes. A newsmen's celebration in ''Kane,'' for example, becomes Welles's profligate trip to Rio for his failed project, ''It's All True.'' And the whole is enclosed within the same narrative frame that the film used: upon Welles's death, a journalist is dispatched to learn the meaning of Welles's final utterance. Kane's, of course, was ''Rosebud.'' Welles's, we are told, was ''Thorn.'' It turns out to be a name -- Thorne -- whose meaning, disclosed in the end (but not here) is more than clever; it is an artifice, yes, but with the thrum of credibility, adding a satisfying layer of resonance to the elusiveness-of-truth theme.</p>
        <p>In fact, familiarity with the film is more or less an audience requirement, though knowledge of Welles's life isn't. In that regard, the show freely, often pointedly, mixes fact and fiction. Characters from the life of Kane -- notably Mr. Bernstein, Kane's loyal assistant, played here by Will Bond doing a delightful impression of the actor Everett Sloane -- show up in the life of Welles.</p>
        <p>And Welles's best friend, from whom he eventually becomes estranged (an echo of Jedediah Leland, a drama critic played by Joseph Cotten in the film), is here an actor who accompanies Welles to Hollywood. The character, played by Barney O'Hanlon, is called Stephen Webber, a purposeful confusion with the real actor playing Welles. Follow?</p>
        <p>These willful meldings of life and its presentation are further tangled by the stagecraft of Ms. Bogart and her designers, who provide persistent reminders that stories can be told in different ways. In a constantly changing stage tableau, with a whole warehouse of props kept mostly onstage and ferried back and forth by the performers, the show uses stage vocabulary, often ingeniously, to recreate film clips and radio bits from Welles's work that are interspersed with the story of the journalist, Thompson (J. Ed Araiza), and his search for the meaning of Welles's last word.</p>
        <p>Tracking all this is no easy task for an audience, but it shouldn't be. The inseparability of a story's meaning from the mode and skill of its telling is the centrally illustrated point here, and particularly in the audio and visual ingenuity of ''War of the Worlds,'' it comes across with effective if unparsable resonance. Still, with nonliteral communication doing most of the work, it's a difficult balance to strike between keeping an audience on narrative track and burdening it with redundance, which is to say that the element of the show that doesn't work is the script.</p>
        <p>It's hard to know, in such a collaborative effort, where the fault lies. But when I first saw the show last spring in Louisville at the Humana Festival of New American Plays, the nonliteral elements were overpowering; Ms. Iizuka's words were nearly irrelevant, calling attention only to their insufficiency. Since then, the script has taken on bulk, and the flaw has been overcorrected. (If memory serves, the show, now 90 minutes, has taken on 15 minutes or so, and if memory doesn't serve, the work just seems longer.)</p>
        <p>Welles does an awful lot of explaining himself now, even if much of it is coy this-is-the-real-truth game-playing, and the other characters reflect a great deal on how he brought his demise upon himself. What one wanted, though, was a little more lyricism, a little less exposition. Among other things, Mr. Webber's manner, so initially suggestive of Welles without absolute mimicry, begins to wear thin with added exposure. And, more problematic, the show itself, which in the spring presented Welles with fond admiration, as a grand figure mysteriously tormented and creatively self-destructive, now yields a rather melancholy portrait of a man lost in the folly of ordinary hubris.</p>
        <p>In a telling program note, Ms. Bogart writes that she was moved to create the show by her discovery, when living in France, that Welles was revered in Europe, whereas in the United States ''he is mostly remembered as a fat man on talk shows who also appeared in advertisements for wine.'' That seems not only wrong but disingenuous, a contrivance by a storyteller unsure of her story.</p>
        <p>Still, at its best, ''War,'' which runs through Sunday, vividly frames its worlds as one. The climactic sequence refers to the scene in ''Citizen Kane'' in which Kane, left by his wife and desperately alone, tears apart a room in Xanadu, the mansion he built as a monument to himself. Mr. Webber roams about and gathers the props -- chairs, lights, microphones -- and builds a tower of detritus at center stage. It's a great visual idea, a twisted mirror held up to Welles's art, as well as a symbolic representation of his compromised life.</p>
        <p>The accompanying narration is provided by a film scholar who merely intones the names of dozens of films that Welles, as an actor and director, was a part of. A dizzying list, the great and the mediocre piled on top of one another, it echoes with the achievements and the failures that both created and undermined a legacy. No additional commentary necessary.</p>
