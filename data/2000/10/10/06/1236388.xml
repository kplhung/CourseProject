        <p>Ten percent of anything isn't much, but when it comes to DVD, the slice grows all out of proportion. Distributors say that the new format, now in about 10 percent of households and spreading fast, is becoming so popular that it has not only started to compete with VHS, it is also helping the videocassette by rekindling interest in all home video.</p>
        <p>Adams Media Research, a consulting company in Carmel, Calif., projects that consumers will spend more than $4 billion on digital video discs this year, more than half what is spent on VHS cassettes.</p>
        <p>''It's phenomenal the way these things are selling,'' said Rich Thorward, an industry consultant and publisher of The Monitor, a tipsheet that advises retailers on new releases. ''The early buyer of the player likes collecting.''</p>
        <p>Rental is also strong. ''I talk to dealers who say that people who haven't rented for years are coming back in,'' he added.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, Universal will release ''Jurassic Park'' and ''The Lost World: Jurassic Park'' on disc for the first time (and also in new VHS editions). ''Both movies will be top sellers and good renters,'' The Monitor says of the two discs. Steven Spielberg movies are just what any new format needs. This summer, ''Jaws'' sold more than a million DVD's. That should go double for the two Jurassic Park films.</p>
        <p>But as with VHS, new films are the best sellers on disc. This fall the schedule is packed with hits, from ''Toy Story 2,'' to be released by Disney on Oct. 17, to ''The Perfect Storm,'' ''Gladiator'' and ''Mission: Impossible 2,'' all coming in November. ''The month of November has a billion dollars worth of box office,'' Mr. Thorward said.</p>
        <p>Those films will do smashingly on tape, of course, but video is stressing the disc. ''Because of DVD, there will be a lot of advertising this fall,'' Mr. Thorward said. Since the same movies will be involved, VHS is also expected to benefit from the attention.</p>
        <p>On the discs themselves, the extra features grow in number and complexity. For those with computers equipped with DVD-ROM drives, the ''Jurassic Park'' DVD's will link users to a live Web cast from the set of ''Jurassic Park 3,'' now being filmed. As far as is known, that is a first for a major movie. It may include a visit with the director, although Universal hasn't announced what exactly will transpire (the director is Joe Johnston and not Mr. Spielberg).</p>
        <p>Like most special editions, these two Jurassic DVD's include fine documentaries. In ''The Making of 'The Lost World' '' the storyboards are three-dimensional and move like animated films and the animatronic dinosaurs, some of them weighing nine tons, are stuffed with great tangles of electronics that are at risk of shorting out and blowing up when it rains, as it does constantly in ''The Lost World.'' Tyrannosaurs need to be toweled down. One gets the shakes.</p>
        <p>New Video Releases</p>
        <p>Shanghai Noon</p>
        <p>In a mix of Hong Kong action film and spaghetti western, a Chinese imperial agent named Chon Wang (Jackie Chan, left) goes to Nevada in 1881 to rescue the emperor's daughter, Princess Pei Pei (Lucy Liu), who has been kidnapped. Over here, the hyperactive martial-arts man falls in with a relaxed gun for hire named Roy O'Bannon (Owen Wilson), and together the two get into a variety of scrapes. The princess proves that she can take care of herself in what is, as A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times, a ''celebration of male bonding, unabashedly juvenile, boyishly risque and disarmingly sweet.''</p>
        <p>2000. Touchstone. $107.37; DVD, $29.99. 110 minutes. Closed captioned. PG-13. Release date: Oct. 10.</p>
        <p>The Skulls</p>
        <p>Each year at an unnamed Ivy League institution (Yale), a secret society called the Skulls (modeled after Yale's Skull and Bones) initiates a fresh crop of sons of the rich and powerful into what, if the boys play the game, will become lives of privilege and influence, all bought and paid for. Now and then a commoner is allowed in, and this year it is a brash, talented offspring of the laboring classes named Luke McNamara (Joshua Jackson). But people like Luke bring baggage, in this case his nosy student journalist friend, who gets his neck broken investigating the Skulls. Some old members talk of voting in reform, but the film is ''less interested in politics than in profitably flattering the suspicions and resentments of its intended teenage audience'' (Dave Kehr).</p>
        <p>2000. Universal. $107.37; DVD, $26.98. 106 minutes. Closed captioned. PG-13.</p>
        <p>Mother and Son</p>
        <p>In an isolated landscape, a young man tends his dying mother. On the surface, little happens. He takes her for a walk. Postcards and photos allude to past friends and lovers, and he recalls his boyhood. The magic of Aleksandr Sokurov's film is in light and shadow, windswept grasses, the ever-changing sky. To perhaps the deepest and and most complex of human relationships, he ''brings the eye of a masterly painter and the sensitivity of a poet'' (Lawrence Van Gelder).</p>
        <p>1998. Winstar. $89.98; DVD, $29.98. 73 minutes. Russian with English subtitles. No rating.</p>
        <p>The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas</p>
        <p>In the interests of an alien study of human mating habits, Fred (Mark Addy) pairs with Wilma Slaghoople (Kristen Johnston) and Barney (Stephen Baldwin) mates with Betty O'Shale (Jane Krakowski). Everybody goes to Rock Vegas, which is owned by Wilma's old boyfriend, the slicked-down Chip Rockefeller (Thomas Gibson), and Betty has her head tuned by the rock singer Mick Jagged (Alan Cumming). But as directed by Brian Levant, all of this ''stumbles at its outset by setting up an adult premise inevitably undone by the film's aspirations to family entertainment'' (Van Gelder).</p>
        <p>2000. Universal. $107.37; DVD, $24.98. 90 minutes. Closed captioned. PG.</p>
