        <p>Tom Burckhardt's paintings are like certain small, crowded city apartments. They look cramped and disorderly at first.

        <p>Caren Golden Fine Arts  526 West 26th Street, Chelsea  Through Oct. 14</p>
        <p>Tom Burckhardt's paintings are like certain small, crowded city apartments. They look cramped and disorderly at first. But in fact their contents have been arranged just so, with everything purposefully wedged in and stacked, so that there is just enough room to move around and even an indoorsy kind of airiness.</p>
        <p>The items themselves are clearly if eccentrically and obsessively hand-picked. They include ancient Greek vases, a backward flag, piles of cartoon rocks, a star-filled sky that could be from an American landscape painting and monsoon clouds from an Indian miniature. They are mixed in with crazy-quilt swatches of abstract patterns: Indo-Islamic, pre-Columbian, Pop, Op and some probably invented for the occasion. All the elements are layered like stage flats or curtains, so that an illusionistic sense of depth keeps shifting, flattening then deepening. The results might fall into the all-purpose ''dreamlike'' category, except that the painting style is deliberate and wide awake, as if very particular (though unexplained) story lines were being laid out.</p>
        <p>An installation in the back gallery by Frank Gonzalez really is a packed room, filled floor to ceiling with found objects sorted out on shelves by type: sneakers, typewriters, prosthetic limbs and so forth. They occupy a limbo between being unwanted and reusable.</p>
        <p>Other artists like Arman and Haim Steinbach are, in their different ways, masters of such consumerist assemblage. Mr. Gonzalez, in his New York solo debut, doesn't make objects come to life the way they do. He seems to be after something else, using sheer scale to create a kind of catacomb of the discarded.</p>
