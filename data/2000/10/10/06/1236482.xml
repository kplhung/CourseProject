        <p>For more than a decade, 11 shuttered and abandoned buildings have stood among the neat single-family homes on Dean Street in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn. And behind them along Bergen Street and Underhill Avenue a blanket of too-tall grass hides crumbling foundations of houses once begun but never completed.</p>
        <p>The abandoned homes and home sites have been there since 1984, when a moderate-cost housing project begun two years earlier came to a halt after 11 of the planned 54 one-family houses had been sold and occupied.</p>
        <p>Another 11 were completed but never occupied before the original developer went bankrupt. Since then, the project has been mired in litigation as New York City's Department of Housing Preservation and Development worked to secure clear title to the property.</p>
        <p>Now the street scape is starting to change. In June, the city's Housing Department closed on the property with a new developer, who is moving forward to complete the project, although with higher-density housing than originally envisioned.</p>
        <p>R. Randy Lee, in partnership with Seymour Sadkin, both of Staten Island, will renovate the 11 unoccupied one-family homes, and will build 27 three-family houses on the vacant block fronts.</p>
        <p>The $13.2 million project, called Prospect Heights Homes, will take shape over the next year, said Mr. Lee, who is chief executive of the Leewood Real Estate Group.</p>
        <p>Ajao Salu, executive director of the Brooklyn Neighborhood Improvement Association, the nonprofit community sponsor for Prospect Heights Homes, said that while restarting the project was good news, ''it has been a long time coming.''</p>
        <p>A completed project, he added, will mean additional housing for which ''there always is a need,'' and the removal of an eyesore from the neighborhood, which has undergone a resurgence in the last few years.</p>
        <p>The developers received an $8 million construction loan from the Richmond County Savings Bank to build the project, which is being designed by Moss &amp; Sayad, of Brooklyn. The project's sponsors include the city's Housing Department and the nonprofit New York City Housing Partnership.</p>
        <p>City subsidies will lower the prices of the houses by $37,609 for the one-family homes and $56,500 for the three-family ones. The project is also eligible for tax abatement, which will effectively keep property taxes at a minimum for 20 years.</p>
        <p>Monthly taxes on the homes will be from $15 to $30 with the abatement; without it, they would be $125 to $300, Mr. Lee said.</p>
        <p>The three-family homes will be sold for $363,000 to people earning $65,000 to $100,000 a year, depending on family size. Each of the three-story houses will have a two-bedroom duplex with 1,800 square feet on part of the first floor and all of the second floor for the owner. The owner also gets a one-car garage, a parking space and a small backyard.</p>
        <p>There will be two rental units: A 600-square-foot studio on the rest of the first floor and a two-bedroom apartment with 1,200 square feet on the third floor. Monthly rents are expected to be $700 to $1,300.</p>
        <p>The 11 unoccupied houses to be renovated have 1,400 square feet and three or four bedrooms. Seven of them will be sold for $153,701 each to people with annual incomes of $45,000 to $70,950.</p>
        <p>In an unusual move by the city's Housing Department, the four remaining homes  have been reserved for people who put down deposits on the homes in the early 1980's but were unable to complete their purchases because the project failed. Those purchasers who qualify will be able to buy a home for the 1980's price, which the city believes to be $66,000. The public subsidy for those homes will be $125,310.</p>
        <p>''We made a commitment to the original buyers and we intend to honor it,'' said Jerilyn Perine, commissioner of the city's Housing Department. ''While some issues need to be worked out, our intention is to offer the original buyers who meet the eligibility requirements the homes at the 1982 price.''</p>
        <p>All buyers must live in the house, not own any other residences and agree to a 25-year resale restriction. Under it, owners who sell their homes within three years of the purchase must pay back the full subsidy to the city. If they sell the homes in the fourth through the 25th years, they must share half the profit from the sale with the city.</p>
        <p>Shirley I. Smith, who put down a $3,500 deposit on one of the Dean Street houses in 1982, is still hoping to be a homeowner in an  area that she said ''is up and coming.'' But over the years, Ms. Smith said, her circumstances have changed, including retiring in 1990 to South Carolina, where she bought a home. She lives there with her daughter and five grandchildren.</p>
        <p>''If I had the house in Brooklyn, I would never have moved, but I couldn't afford a house in New York,'' Ms. Smith said. ''I feel I shouldn't be penalized for that.'' But, she added: ''To be honest, I may try to sell the house in South Carolina because I want the house in Brooklyn. It's my dream home.''</p>
        <p>Renovation of the 11 single-family homes, which includes gutting the interiors, began last month and is to be finished by next January, said Mr. Lee, the developer. Construction of the three-family homes, all with brick facades, will start in four to six weeks and take until late next summer, he said.</p>
