        <p>The Month for Beer</p>
        <p>October -- with its cool, crisp days, autumn foliage and harvest celebrations -- brings thoughts of fall festivals like Oktoberfest brimming with plentiful food, good fellowship and beer. If all this puts you in the mood to quaff a glass and have a pleasant meal to boot, these 12 inviting places offer good and unusual beer lists. (These summaries are taken from dining reviews, columns and articles in The Times by William Grimes, Eric Asimov and others.)</p>
        <p>1. Belgo Nieuw York</p>
        <p>+</p>
        <p>(212) 253-2828</p>
        <p>415 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place</p>
        <p>East Village</p>
        <p>$ All major cards</p>
        <p>Belgium has been thoroughly transformed here from country to concept. Belgo's motto is ''Moules, frites et bieres'' (''Mussels, fries and beers''), and those foods are served in staggering quantities. The menu goes well beyond mussels, though, and some of the other dishes are very good, like carbonade, the famous beef stew with apples and prunes. Evenings are unpleasantly loud and crowded, but at lunch it is possible to enjoy a pleasant conversation or savor one of Belgo's 100 or so Belgian beers and ales, which range from the inconsequential mass-market Stella Artois to spicy wheat beers, unusual fruit beers, rich reddish-brown ''wine beers'' and seldom-seen regional specialties. Each beer is thoughtfully marked with its alcoholic content, which can be as high as 12 percent, twice the usual figure.</p>
        <p>2. Brasseriebit</p>
        <p>+++</p>
        <p>(212) 869-4440</p>
        <p>258 West 44th Street</p>
        <p>Manhattan</p>
        <p>$$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>Brasseriebit takes its name from Bitburger, the German brewery that is its partner and whose beers are on tap. The chef, David Ruggerio, has given the menu a light touch. Appetizers include jumbo lump crab cakes with spicy remoulade, and skewered tuna with lemon grass, and entrees include garlic-roasted pork shank with a tangle of greens and creamy polenta; and oxtail ragu with horseradish gnocchi. Brasserie classics like onion soup gratine, duck and foie gras terrine, roast chicken, steak frites and a raw bar are also available. For October the restaurant is featuring a three-course Oktoberfest menu for $45, including beer.</p>
        <p>3. Cafe de Bruxelles</p>
        <p>+++</p>
        <p>(212) 206-1830</p>
        <p>118 Greenwich Avenue, at 13th Street</p>
        <p>Greenwich Village</p>
        <p>$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>The little zinc-topped bar at this cozy Belgian cafe is a warm and welcoming stop. It is also the perfect spot for pairing metal cones of wonderful frites, served with mayonnaise, with a wide choice of exceptional Belgian brews, including fruity ales brewed by Trappist monks and tart lambic ales made with natural, airborne yeasts. The frites may be good enough to inspire dinner in the dining room, where a menu of bistro fare is served. Or you can eat at the bar.</p>
        <p>4. Ear Inn</p>
        <p>+++</p>
        <p>(212) 226-9060</p>
        <p>326 Spring Street, near Greenwich Street</p>
        <p>South Village</p>
        <p>$ All major cards</p>
        <p>Since 1817 the landmark James Brown House, named after a Revolutionary War-era tobacco trader, has housed some sort of tavern. When New York was a great commercial port, it was a sailors' dive. Since it became the Ear Inn, more than 20 years ago, it has drawn an eclectic crowd of artists, writers, bikers and construction workers for whom the air of an unpretentious neighborhood watering hole with a good selection of beers has an unending appeal. The food is basic and inexpensive: grilled shell steak, grilled salmon, chicken pot pie and spaghetti with shrimp and scallops are all under $10.</p>
        <p>5. Hallo, Berlin</p>
        <p>+</p>
        <p>(212) 541-6248</p>
        <p>402 West 51st Street, at Ninth Avenue</p>
        <p>Clinton</p>
        <p>$ Mastercard and Visa</p>
        <p>Hallo, Berlin offers a wide choice of dishes, but sausages are really the thing here. The half-dozen kinds of mildly spiced sausages, all imported from Germany, include a plump, savory bratwurst made from pork, smoky knockwurst made from pork and beef, a lighter weisswurst made from veal, and slender wieners, spicier ancestors of frankfurters. The sausages, grilled to a juicy snap, come two to the plate, served with red cabbage, sauerkraut, potatoes and two kinds of mustard-horseradish sauce. A half-dozen German beers are usually available. Hallo, Berlin now has another branch at 626 10th Avenue, at 44th Street.</p>
        <p>6. Jimmy Armstrong's Saloon</p>
        <p>+</p>
        <p>(212) 581-0606</p>
        <p>875 10th Avenue, at 57th Street</p>
        <p>Clinton</p>
        <p>$ American Express</p>
        <p>This dark and inviting corner bar looks like many other corner bars in New York, but it offers a most unusual menu and a full range of excellent beers. The owner is fascinated with Hispanic cultures, and he has gathered recipes from Cuba to Mexico to Spain. Mr. Armstrong's passion is sausages, like morcilla, a rich and earthy Spanish blood sausage served as an appetizer wrapped in a corn tortilla with chopped tomato and salsa or as a main course with rice and beans. Chorizo, mild and uncommonly tasty, is served as an appetizer with a wedge of sharp Cheddar or as a main course with rice and beans. Even the more common dishes like pork chops and steak are well prepared and satisfying.</p>
        <p>7. Markt</p>
        <p>+++</p>
        <p>(212) 727-3314</p>
        <p>401 West 14th Street</p>
        <p>Chelsea</p>
        <p>$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>Markt's look is all brasserie, with dark wood, etched glass and vintage beer posters. Belgian beers, 29 of them, are the focus. Mussels and other seafood, with frites, of course, are among the Belgian specialties by the chef, Marvin James, formerly of Gotham Bar and Grill. Other entrees include steak tartare, rabbit Flemish style with Corsendonck beer, Belgian beef stew and sauteed loin of lamb with roasted Belgian endive, wild mushrooms and thyme.</p>
        <p>8. Oznot's Dish</p>
        <p>+</p>
        <p>(718) 599-6596</p>
        <p>79 Berry Street</p>
        <p>Williamsburg, Brooklyn</p>
        <p>$ Mastercard, Visa</p>
        <p>In a neighborhood like Williamsburg, restaurants are routinely called quirky and offbeat. But Oznot's is truly unusual, with an eclectic collection of artistic influences. The blend of Mediterranean food is just as interesting, with dishes like grilled shrimp served over Asian black rice, grilled salmon with sumac butter, cumin-spiced chicken, and roasted root vegetables with coconut curry and pistachios. Just as surprising as the decor and the menu are the mammoth lists of wine and beer.</p>
        <p>9. Silver Swan</p>
        <p>+</p>
        <p>(212) 254-3611</p>
        <p>41 East 20th Street</p>
        <p>Manhattan</p>
        <p>$ All major cards</p>
        <p>The excellent selection of beers and ales is reason enough to enjoy Silver Swan's solid German fare. Rauchbier, or smoked beer, made with smoked malt, goes perfectly with kassler rippchen, smoked pork chops served with vinegary sauerkraut, while any of more than a dozen Bavarian wheat beers (dry, quenching brews made with a high proportion of wheat malt rather than barley malt) are just right with weisswurst, mild veal sausage, or bratwurst, juicy pork sausage. The menu features meat dishes, with five varieties of schnitzel, a satisfying sauerbraten and a game menu featuring wild boar, goose, duck and venison.</p>
        <p>10. Taperia Madrid</p>
        <p>+</p>
        <p>(212) 794-2923</p>
        <p>1471 Second Avenue, near 77th Street</p>
        <p>Manhattan</p>
        <p>$ All major cards</p>
        <p>As credible a tapas bar as is likely to be found on the Upper East Side, Taperia Madrid has its priorities right. It's a bar first, with noise, smoke, a lack of creature comforts and a casual attitude that is winning -- unless you expect a quiet, leisurely meal. It's got a nice list of sherries and Spanish wines and a surprisingly comprehensive selection of beers. The tapas are quite good, particularly boquerones, or marinated anchovies that taste like pickled herring; big, meaty grilled sardines; and angulas, baby eels in spicy garlic sauce.</p>
        <p>11. Tavern on Jane</p>
        <p>+</p>
        <p>(212) 675-2526</p>
        <p>31 Eighth Avenue, at Jane Street</p>
        <p>West Village</p>
        <p>$ All major cards</p>
        <p>Tavern feels as if it's been around forever, but in fact it's only five years old. The owners, Michael Stewart and Horton Foote Jr., the son of the writer, took over the Jane Street Seafood Cafe with the simple aim of creating a friendly neighborhood hangout. They've succeeded, and though the atmosphere tends to outweigh the familiar and unchallenging food, the menu is a reliable step above pub grub. Tavern offers a perfunctory wine list with a few decent bottles under $25, but it's more of a beer place, with good draft selections like Brooklyn Pennant Ale, Guinness and Boddington's Cream Ale.</p>
        <p>12. Typhoon Restaurant and Brewery</p>
        <p>** [Rating: 2 stars]</p>
        <p>(212) 754-9006</p>
        <p>22 East 54th Street</p>
        <p>Manhattan</p>
        <p>$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>Much has changed at Typhoon since it opened in 1996. The original chef, James Chew, left, and the original menu, which was divided by category into salty, sweet, sour, bitter and hot, now follows the conventional appetizer-and-main-course format. Some of Mr. Chew's best selections remain, like wok-charred squid with a sauce of roasted chilies, and hot-and-sour fruits with fried shallots and peanut salad. One thing that hasn't changed is the brewery operation. Typhoon has an extensive list of beers, including those brewed in-house, and the wine list is large and interesting.</p>
