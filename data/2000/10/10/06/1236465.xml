        <p>Jaret Holmes was greeted by strange stares at the gate at Hartsfield International Airport in Atlanta as he awaited a flight home to Jackson, Miss. Don't we know you, the commuters seemed to imply. When Holmes was finally asked what line of work required him to be a regular on the Atlanta-Jackson route, he replied, ''I'm trying to make money playing football.''</p>
        <p>Holmes was a walking ''Will Kick for Food'' advertisement for four weeks until he got a call from the Giants. On Sunday he is expected to be their place-kicker in Atlanta.</p>
        <p>After being released by the Bears a week before the season, Holmes came to Giants Stadium for a tryout. The next week, he was off to Denver and Kansas City. Then, it was Carolina and Jacksonville. And finally Washington. The Redskins told him they were a week away from making a possible offer, but Holmes was going to sign with the first team that had an opening.</p>
        <p>Last week, Holmes's luck changed when his friend, Brad Daluiso, felt his back stiffen. Holmes auditioned last Friday and signed a contract the next day. He did not attempt a field goal Sunday during a 28-14 loss to the Titans, but he did make two extra points. He had a rough debut in practice Wednesday, missing four of six field-goal attempts into the wind.</p>
        <p>Today, under the practice bubble, Holmes's routine field-goal attempts sailed through the middle of the goal posts. Coach Jim Fassel said today that Holmes would be activated for Sunday's game at Atlanta, but held off on announcing whether Daluiso would join him.</p>
        <p>After kicking for Auburn, Holmes spent the 1998 training camp with Philadelphia before being released. He gave himself until the age of 25 to earn a living in football. Now 24, he spent parts of last season with Buffalo and was also on the Giants' practice squad before finishing with Chicago. He interpreted the Bears' decision to send him to Berlin of the National Football League Europe last spring as a good sign, but was confused when Chicago cut him the week before the season began after he was 5 for 5 on field goals in the preseason.</p>
        <p>''I've always been on the bubble since I got in here,'' Holmes said. ''Everybody's told me I'm good enough. I just have to be in the right place at the right time. I've done well with the chances that people have given me. Hopefully, somewhere along the way people are going to notice that and give me a shot where I can stay.''</p>
        <p>For now, Holmes has steady work. But he is all too familiar with the lonely, nomadic life of a kicker. Holmes is currently living out of the locker of the injured cornerback Ralph Brown's locker at Giants Stadium and carries his workout clothes in a bag. There is little glamour in his position.</p>
        <p>''This is probably not where he wants to be,'' said Daluiso, who hopes to return next week. ''He'd rather be somewhere where they say, 'You're the guy for the next 10 years.' You're always looking for that job. But this is a great spot for him right now. Playing games is the best possible scenario for any kicker, whether you're kicking off or kicking field goals. You're in the league. There's no substitute.''</p>
        <p>Daluiso knows the feeling. He was on five teams in 16 months before finally joining the Giants in 1993. He began as their kickoff specialist before earning the full-time job. Oddly, kickoffs have been Daluiso's weakness this season after tearing knee ligaments last October. Not counting onside kicks, his kickoffs have ranged from 40 yards to 77 yards. That alone may keep Holmes here for a while.</p>
        <p>Holmes reached the end zone on each of his three kickoffs last Sunday, with two resulting in touchbacks. Holmes said he expected to reach the end zone on each kick in the Georgia Dome.</p>
        <p>The Giants need that to quiet the Falcons' special teams unit, which is averaging 25.4 yards on kickoff returns, seventh in the league. The rookie Darrick Vaughn had a 100-yard touchdown return against Denver Sept. 10.</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>Middle linebacker MIKE BARROW (pinched nerve) again missed practice and remained questionable. Coach JIM FASSEL said Barrow had improved and he would not keep him out of Sunday's game because he has not practiced this week. Fassel was fairly certain receiver AMANI TOOMER (sprained right big toe) will play although he also did not practice.</p>
