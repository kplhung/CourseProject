        <p>Conceding that a defendant's 1988 desk diary had probably been illegally seized, judges in the Lockerbie trial still allowed it to be entered as evidence today.</p>
        <p>The diary, found in a desk in a Malta tourist agency in 1991, is considered crucial to linking the second defendant, Al Amin Khalifa Fhimah, to the bombing plot.</p>
        <p>No witness has yet read out the relevant diary entry at the trial, which is being held at Camp Zeist, a former NATO air base in the Netherlands. But it has been reported to say ''Pick up Air Malta luggage tags'' or words to that effect on a date shortly before Dec. 21, 1988.</p>
        <p>As station manager for Libyan Arab Airlines in Malta, Mr. Fhimah might have had access to Air Malta tags.</p>
        <p>On Dec. 21, prosecutors contend, a suitcase with a bomb inside was loaded onto Air Malta flight KM180 to Frankfurt, tagged to transfer to Pan Am 103 to London and New York. Pan Am 103 exploded shortly after leaving London and crashed in Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 259 people aboard and 11 on the ground.</p>
        <p>The court's three judges conducted a three-day ''trial within a trial'' to determine whether they, in their second role as the jury, should be allowed to hear about the diary. Today, Lord Ranald Sutherland, the presiding judge, read a brief ruling saying they should.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fhimah's lawyer argued that the discovery of the diary had been illegal, so it should be excluded.</p>
        <p>Last week, the court heard two Scottish detectives testify that they had asked Mr. Fhimah's Maltese partner in the Medtours travel agency, Vincent Vassallo, to let them visit the office and talk about Mr. Fhimah. At the end of a five-hour interview with a Maltese police officer and an F.B.I. agent also present, Mr. Vassallo showed them the office, opening cupboards and drawers, the detectives testified. In or on Mr. Fhimah's desk, they said, he found the 1988 diary. They said they asked to look at it, saw it was in Arabic, then asked if they could take it to be translated, and Mr. Vassallo agreed.</p>
        <p>They conceded that they did not have a search warrant, but argued that they needed none because they did not consider Mr. Fhimah a suspect at the time. The defense cast doubt on that, pointing out that they had already asked the Maltese police for all records on him and had searched his former apartment and taken away a briefcase and some household putty to be tested for plastic explosives.</p>
        <p>This week, Mr. Vassallo testified that he had not objected when the detectives took the diary, along with his own, but had felt ''cornered'' when they asked. Who started opening drawers and cupboards was also disputed.</p>
        <p>An expert in Maltese law testified that Maltese police could conduct searches without warrants if they had been invited onto the premises.</p>
        <p>In his ruling, Lord Sutherland accepted that the seizure had probably violated Maltese law, but noted that the Maltese officer on the scene had raised no objection. The police had not used trickery or deliberately evaded the law, he said.</p>
        <p>There has been widespread speculation that the prosecution will rest in a week or two. The court will have to decide whether it presented enough facts to convict the two defendants. If the court rules that it did, the defense begins. It has notified the court that it will present evidence supporting an alternate theory: that a group of Palestinian terrorists based in Germany blew up the plane.</p>
