        <p>Re ''I Was for Peace. Now What?'', by Avraham Burg (Op-Ed, Oct. 4):</p>
        <p>I was stunned by Mr. Burg's assertion that Ariel Sharon's visit to the Temple Mount was part of the Israeli conversation about the peace process. Ariel Sharon is not a man who supports this process, and his visit was clearly intended as a provocation that would disrupt it.</p>

        <p>In this regard, his visit was a complete success. The fact that he could bring a man like Mr. Burg into his fold on this issue is an unexpected bonus.</p>
