        <p>Directed by Jose Luis Valenzuela  R; 100 minutes</p>
        <p>The tears flow like the tequila in ''Luminarias.'' But never is there a moment's fear that they will drown the bluebird of happiness that is just around the corner.</p>
        <p>Written by its star, Evelina Fernandez, based on her stage play and directed by her husband, Jose Luis Valenzuela, ''Luminarias'' is easy to like and difficult to admire.</p>
        <p>Like ''Waiting to Exhale,'' the 1995 film based on Terry McMillan's novel of the same title, ''Luminarias'' tells the story of women looking for love. The setting is Los Angeles, and here the women are not black but Hispanic. ''Luminarias'' is enjoyable for Ms. Fernandez's feisty performance, its high comic spirits and its messages of sisterhood, brotherhood and hope.</p>
        <p>But for all its liveliness, music, humor and determination to overcome ethnic and social stereotyping, the film's subsidiary characters are too often transformed into cartoons by their broad acting, and its outcome is visible far, far in advance.</p>
        <p>Foremost among its four principals is Andrea (Ms. Fernandez), a successful divorce lawyer whose philandering husband, Joe (Robert Beltran), has finally exhausted her patience.</p>
        <p>Her three best friends, who gather regularly at a night spot called Luminarias to dish and despair, are Sofia (Marta DuBois), Lilly (Angela Moya) and Irene (Dyana Ortelli).</p>
        <p>Sofia, a therapist, has spent her life trying to distance herself from her Hispanic roots. Lilly, an artist, is histrionically unlucky in love. And the steamy Irene, a clothing designer, has given up sex for Lent. That gives her a new problem, celibacy, to add to her difficulties accepting her gay brother and his penchant for women's clothes.</p>
        <p>So en route to its sunny finish, ''Luminarias'' asks Irene to come to terms with her sibling, and the Korean parents of Lilly's boyfriend, Lu (Andrew C. Lim), to come to terms with her Hispanic background. In addition, the social-climbing Sofia is required to realize that her true love is Pablo (Sal Lopez, the film's producer), an adoring little Mexican waiter at Luminarias, and Andrea must overcome her hostility to non-Hispanic men and accept the love of Joseph (Scott Bakula), who is not only Jewish but also the lawyer opposing her in a case that revolves around spousal abuse.</p>
        <p>When it comes to worthy messages, ''Luminarias,'' which opens today at the Quad Cinema, 34 West 13th Street in Greenwich Village, has its big heart in the right place, which is not always on its sleeve.</p>
