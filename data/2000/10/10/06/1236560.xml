        <p>Striking a cautious tone, President Vladimir V. Putin has refused to take a position on the leadership struggle in Yugoslavia.</p>
        <p>He took no step toward recognizing the Sept. 24 election victory of the opposition leader, Vojislav Kostunica, a step that the United States and European governments were hoping he would take.</p>
        <p>Instead, as he returned overnight from a state visit to India, Mr. Putin closeted himself with his top security advisers at Sheremetyevo Airport and then read a statement on state television saying simply that further violence must be avoided.</p>
        <p>But this morning, Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov left Moscow for Belgrade, the news agency Itar-Tass quoted his office as saying. Dmitri Rogozin, a member of Parliament, was quoted as saying that Mr. Ivanov was to try to help make sure that tensions do not escalate.</p>
        <p>In his statement, Mr. Putin identified Russia's interest in bringing an end to Yugoslavia's isolation and said Russia was ready to help this longtime ally ''firmly stand on the path to democratic development.'' His remarks emphasizing Russia's support for democratic development suggested that Moscow was adjusting its position to recognize an inevitable transfer of power.</p>
