        <p>Not long after a stay at the Cleveland Clinic, most patients receive a letter telling about the clinic's good works -- and seeking a contribution.</p>
        <p>''We wait a few months, and then we mail quarterly,'' said William Grimberg, chairman of institutional advancement at the clinic. ''If we don't get anything back, we stop the mailings after about a year and a half.''</p>

        <p>Not long after a stay at the Cleveland Clinic, most patients receive a letter telling about the clinic's good works -- and seeking a contribution.</p>
        <p>''We wait a few months, and then we mail quarterly,'' said William Grimberg, chairman of institutional advancement at the clinic. ''If we don't get anything back, we stop the mailings after about a year and a half.''</p>
        <p>The timetables may vary, but the practice of soliciting donations from former patients is common at hospitals nationwide, from giants like the Cleveland Clinic to the tiniest rural community hospitals.</p>
        <p>''It just makes sense that former patients are the ones who care the most, so they're the ones who respond most promptly and positively to appeals,'' said Rick Wade, a spokesman for the American Hospital Association. ''And with a third of hospitals now operating in the red, and getting squeezed from all sides, those contributions are more important than ever.''</p>
        <p>But at a time when the federal government is trying to safeguard the privacy of medical records, this basic hospital fund-raising strategy is running up against patients' rights to privacy.</p>
        <p>As part of a broad effort to limit the use of identifiable patient information, the Clinton administration has proposed rules that would stop  hospitals from using patients' names for such nonmedical reasons as fund-raising.</p>
        <p>The privacy regulations have been a hot topic among those in health care since they were published in the Federal Register last Nov. 3. Hospitals, insurers, former patients and groups advocating privacy have taken issue with almost every aspect of the rules in more than 50,000 comments filed with the government.</p>
        <p>The final rules, expected within the next month, will reflect some of the criticism, said administration officials, adding that the rules would strengthen patients' privacy rights.</p>
        <p>But it is unclear how the final rules, which will have the force of law, will deal with hospitals' use of patient records for fund-raising.</p>
        <p>Officials at the Department of Health and Human Services acknowledged that they had not considered how their proposals to limit the use of patient information would affect fund-raising. They said they started thinking about the question only when the hospitals' vociferous complaints poured in.</p>
        <p>The issue is a major one, hospitals say, because even though the letters to former patients rarely bring in large contributions, they are the crucial first step toward finding the people who will eventually become big donors.</p>
        <p>One of the many hospital fund-raisers to ask for changes in the  proposed rules was Jannie Fernandez, chief executive of the Carondolet Foundation in Tucson, which raises  money for three hospitals.</p>
        <p>''Practically speaking, the best way for a hospital to acquire donors is by contacting former patients,'' Ms. Fernandez told the government health agency, adding that mailings by her foundation bring in about 1,500 responses a year from patients.</p>
        <p>Ms. Fernandez is more familiar with the privacy issue than most hospital fund-raisers.</p>
        <p>One of her hospitals was among three in Arizona that were investigated by the state health department in 1994 after an unhappy former patient complained about receiving solicitations.</p>
        <p>Now, with state approval, the hospital asks every patient to sign a form authorizing solicitations. Ms. Fernandez said that only a handful of patients had declined to sign.</p>
        <p>''It's been no problem to leave out people who don't want to be contacted,'' she said. ''Like most hospitals, we also don't mail to people on Medicaid, people who got charity care, emergency room admissions, psychiatric patients, people in drug rehabilitation, or anyone under 40. Mailings are expensive. For every dollar they bring in, they cost us 75 cents to more than a dollar.</p>
        <p>''They're important, not for the revenue, but as our best way to identify people with an interest in our organization, whom we can grow, over time, into major donors.''</p>
        <p>Now that they have started thinking about the fund-raising issue, privacy experts say, it raises real concerns.</p>
        <p>''You should always get someone's permission,'' said Zoe Hudson, senior policy analyst at the Georgetown University Health Privacy Project. ''Our general position is that you should always get someone's permission before you use someone's information for marketing. The issue is that, while for most people a solicitation letter would be no problem, people go to hospitals for very sensitive reasons, and for a woman who got an abortion without telling her husband, for a psychiatric patient, for someone with H.I.V., just having someone see a letter might raise all kinds of questions.''</p>
        <p>The Privacy Rights Clearinghouse in San Diego, which runs a hot line for people with privacy complaints, receives occasional complaints from people who have felt invaded by hospital solicitations, Beth Givens, the director, said.</p>
        <p>''I remember one woman who had been in a cancer hospital here in San Diego, who was upset when she got a solicitation asking her to put the hospital in her will,'' Ms. Givens said, ''and she wondered if they had used her medical information.''</p>
        <p>Some hospitals acknowledge the privacy concerns, but say that as long as fund-raisers have access only to a patient's name and address, the intrusion is minimal.</p>
        <p>''We did a phone campaign to former patients when we were raising money to build a new hospital,'' said Lisa Hillman of the Anne Arundel Medical Center Foundation in Annapolis, Md. ''It was wonderfully successful, and we only got two or three complaints from people we called.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Hillman said it would be counterproductive and financially crippling to forbid hospitals like hers to use of the names and addresses of former patients.</p>
        <p>''That information's out there,'' she said, ''so the alternative would be to buy those same names and numbers from a mailing house, which would charge thousands of dollars for a one-time use. We could never afford it.''</p>
