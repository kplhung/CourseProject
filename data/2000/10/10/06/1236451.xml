        <p>Treading a thin line between the risks of higher inflation and stifled growth, the European Central Bank made a surprise decision today to increase interest rates, reflecting its concern over rising prices caused by the weak euro and expensive oil.</p>

        <p>Treading a thin line between the risks of higher inflation and stifled growth, the European Central Bank made a surprise decision today to increase interest rates, reflecting its concern over rising prices caused by the weak euro and expensive oil.</p>
        <p>The quarter-point increase represented the seventh time this year that the central bank had raised rates. It moved the same day that the Bank of England decided to hold British rates steady and two days after the Federal Reserve left American interest rates unchanged while noting it was still concerned about a risk of inflation.</p>
        <p>Many economists had expected the European Central Bank to take no action. But after its meeting today, the bank's president, Wim Duisenberg, made clear that rising prices were primary on its agenda. Rate increases made by the bank, he said, ''continue to aim at ensuring that upward pressure on consumer prices stemming from oil prices and the foreign exchange rate of the euro do not translate into more permanent inflationary tendencies.''</p>
        <p>The move came less than two weeks after the European Central Bank led a coordinated purchase of euros on the foreign exchange markets with the help of Britain, the United States and Japan to strengthen the currency, down more than 25 percent against the dollar since its introduction in January 1999.</p>
        <p>Apparently seeking to keep the currency markets on guard, though, Mr. Duisenberg indicated today that further surprise interventions on behalf of the euro were possible. He said that the decision to raise rates today was consistent with the central bank purchases of euros on Sept. 22 and that the European bank would continue to closely monitor the currency's value and act ''as appropriate.''</p>
        <p>But if today's move was supposed to build confidence in the euro, the effect was short-lived. The currency rose briefly against the dollar on the news, reaching 87.86 cents, then fell back late in the day in Europe to 87.43 and settled in New York at 86.92 cents, down from 87.45 cents on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>Most indicators in recent weeks suggest that the pace of economic growth in the 11 European nations that adopted the euro may have reached a peak in the second quarter of the year. Higher oil prices, and protests including work stoppages at companies relying on oil, contributed to the shift in sentiment from a fairly upbeat mood that had prevailed until recently.</p>
        <p>Many economists now expect European growth to slow to perhaps 3.2 percent in the second half of the year, against 3.8 percent in the first six months.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Duisenberg was at pains to insist that the bank's action today would not result in a slowing of the economy. ''On the contrary,'' he said, ''we believe this rate hike and this monetary policy stance create the best conditions for the robust growth which is going on.'' Business expansion in Europe, he said, had reached ''cruising altitude.''</p>
        <p>At the same time, inflation by most standards has remained subdued. The underlying rate of inflation, excluding food and energy costs, is modest -- at about 1.3 percent. Still, Mr. Duisenberg stressed that in the central bank's view, today's move put interest rates at an appropriate level to combat price pressures.</p>
        <p>The bank's governing council increased its benchmark -- the minimum rate for two-week loans to commercial banks sometimes known as the repurchase rate -- by a quarter-point to 4.75 percent. That narrowed the gap between the European benchmark rate and that of the Federal Reserve to 1.75 percentage points, from 2.5 percentage points in January.</p>
        <p>Many economists said they had expected the bank to raise rates in the last three months of the year, though some expressed surprise that the move came as early as it did. ''We expected an increase in the last quarter, but not quite so soon,'' said Ulrich Ramm, chief economist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ramm said the increase seemed part of a sustained operation by the central bank to deal with the problem of inflation as a threat to sustained growth both by dampening the pace of economic expansion and supporting the value of the euro against the dollar. That could help relieve inflationary pressures that result from European purchases of commodities like crude oil that are priced globally in dollars.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ramm said the move ''did not primarily have the euro as its cause, but because of the euro's weakness and its effect on prices.''</p>
        <p>Yet he and other economists said the bank was walking a thin line, seeking also to avoid slowing growth and the creation of jobs. European unemployment, though still high by American standards, has recently declined for the first time since the early 90's as a result of the Continent's economic upswing.</p>
        <p>J. Paul Horne, a senior economist at Salomon Smith Barney in London, warned that ''slowing the economy and job growth would be the kiss of death for the euro.''</p>
        <p>Public sentiment on the currency has recently been mixed, notably since last week's referendum in which Danes rejected an adoption of the euro by their country.</p>
