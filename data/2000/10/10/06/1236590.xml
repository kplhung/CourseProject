        <p>BECK-Theodore H. Of NYC and Nantucket Island. Age 81, in Sleepy Hollow, New York, on October 5. Ted served in the U.S. Army's spearhead division across the Rhine in WW II. His tank and crew were destroyed in a direct hit but he survived, minus one leg. Despite this disability, he lived a full and well-traveled life, once hiking deep into mountainous Rwandan jungle to visit rare silverback gorillas. Employed at Beck Engraving Co., he later taught English as a Second Language in Colombia. His great love was fishing, especially for ''blues'' off Nantucket's Great Point. As he wished, there will be no funeral service.</p>
