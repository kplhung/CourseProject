        <p>Jerome Bettis, tagged the Bus because of his build, rolls into the Jets' consciousness this week, but the team will try to put the brakes on him without its most important roadblock.</p>
        <p>Nose tackle Jason Ferguson, who sprained his left ankle against Tampa Bay, is listed as doubtful for Sunday's game with the Steelers (1-3).</p>
        <p>That means that the Jets' run defense, which has not allowed a rushing touchdown in building a 4-0 record, will face the potentially devastating Bettis and an offensive line anchored by the All-Pro center Dermontti Dawson, without its best run blocker.</p>
        <p>Many observers thought Bettis's time as a premier back had passed, especially after the Ravens' stellar defense held him to just 8 yards on nine carries in a 16-0 shutout of the Steelers in the season opener. He is eighth in the conference in rushing, but in his last three games, Bettis has gained 133, 77 and 97 yards.</p>
        <p>Last week, the 5-foot-11-inch, 250-pound Bettis led a 209-yard rushing attack and scored two touchdowns, bringing his season total to four. Jets Coach Al Groh surmised that those who said Bettis was washed up either have not tried to hit him recently or are engaging in wishful thinking.</p>
        <p>''We have to be more aware,'' defensive end Rick Lyle said. ''We have to wrap him up. We can't arm tackle him. He's an emotional player. If we can stop him early, hopefully he won't get too into it.''</p>
        <p>If Ferguson cannot play, the bulk of the Bettis workload would go to Ernie Logan, who is a regular in the defensive line rotation. Jason Wiltz and Dorian Boose, who has been inactive for the first four games, are also likely to get turns at the line. The Jets are anticipating an especially punishing game because of Bettis's importance to the Steelers' offense (Pittsburgh's running game is ranked seventh in the league) and because he prefers to barrel straight ahead, no matter who is in his way.</p>
        <p>The Jets, though, have the league's eighth-ranked run defense, a collection of largely unheralded players who, Groh said, are playing as well as they have since they have been with the Jets. This week, Groh has talked about almost everyone on the defensive line: Shane Burton, Lyle, Ferguson and Logan.</p>
        <p>''Good defenses are not about Pro Bowl players,'' Groh said. ''They are my kind of guys. They're tough. They're dependable. They are the kind of guys you win games with.''</p>
        <p>Groh said the players have quietly come to work and done their jobs to help the team win. There have been few accolades along the way, but there is a reward. This week's reward would be stalling the Bus.</p>
        <p>''We have to plug the middle up and make him bounce outside where he's not as effective,'' Logan said. ''Bettis breaks a lot of tackles. You're going to have to get a lot of guys around the ball to bring him down. We'll really have to swarm the ball. We're not going to back down and we know he's not going to back down. There's going to be a lot of guys in the cold tub after this game.''</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>Defensive end DORIAN BOOSE, the Jets' top pick in the 1998 draft, has been told that he will be active this week after spending the first four games on the inactive list. Boose has struggled with the Jets' 3-4 defense and said he has doubted himself at times. But when he was told Wednesday that he would play special teams and be part of the defensive line rotation, he said, he tried not to get too excited in front of the coaches. ''It's like when you ask your boss for a raise and he gives you a raise; you don't get all crazy about it so they don't see how excited you are,'' Boose said. ''I'm excited about it. You want to feel like you're a positive component to the winning streak we're on.'' . . . Coach AL GROH has been told that, with the plates of grass in the center of the field replaced, the condition of Giants Stadium should be better than it was when the Jets last played at home three weeks ago against Buffalo.</p>
