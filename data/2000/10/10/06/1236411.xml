        <p>In ''Requiem for a Dream,'' the director Darren Aronofsky's adaptation of Hubert Selby Jr.'s lower-depths novel, Jared Leto has lost so much weight he looks like another person altogether. As the junkie Harry, a wasted pretty boy, he seems kept aloft by his eyelashes, the only substantial thing on his frame. Superficially, it might be easy to confuse the protagonists of '''Requiem'' with the models in a Calvin Klein Jeans ad of a few years ago. But make no mistake: there is plenty of meat on its bones.</p>
        <p>The filmmaker's effrontery is effectively a personal statement, a brand of dynamism that isn't just technique for its own explosive ends but rather is integral to the storytelling. The book is unremittingly grim, and the flashes of visual wit supplied by Mr. Aronofsky, who wrote the screenplay with Mr. Selby, are offputting because he is infatuated with the rot. By the end, he has made the movie bleaker than the original material. People may find it infuriating precisely because it's so intimidating, and it may leave you shaken. Be warned: it's a downer, and a knockout.</p>
        <p>''Requiem'' interweaves the stories of four drug addicts -- Harry; his mother, Sara (Ellen Burstyn); his girlfriend, Marion (Jennifer Connelly); and his buddy, Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) -- in their pursuit of a reality-blurring high. Still, the picture holds close to the theme of the novel: the real drug we're all hooked on is the American Dream, with its promises of big cash paydays and fame and eventually happiness, which can all no doubt be found around that same corner where prosperity is said to lurk. Mr. Aronofsky starts with Mr. Selby's thesis, which in the wrong hands could be corny and grating, and vaults right past it. He is pixilated on his own fairy dust, and the trail of grace notes that verge on the hyperbolic are his shout out to sanity; he's clearing his head and his lungs.</p>
        <p>When the picture starts, Harry is dropping in on his mother for his regular appointment to steal and pawn her television set. Soon, though, he is coming by to bring her a gift: a brand new one. And in a tragic role reversal, Harry has become the adult. He recognizes his mother's involuntary teeth grinding as an amphetamine addict's behavior; she is hooked on the pills so she can get her weight down to go on her favorite television segment, a raise-the-roof weight-loss infomercial with a predatory host (Christopher McDonald). The tawdriness is another detail that Mr. Aronofsky gets right.</p>
        <p>The story involves the characters' dream-chasing. Harry wants to be rich, his mother wants him to be married and happy, and Marion wants to be a part of his life. He talks her into dating her former therapist (Sean Gullette, the star of Mr. Aronofsky's ''Pi'') so she can get some money to keep Harry's drug business going. Her revulsion is so visceral you can almost feel her nerve endings recoiling.</p>
        <p>Ms. Connelly, too, whittled herself down to a new weight class, and it's her performance that gives the movie weight, since her fall is the most precipitous. By the end, when she curls into a happy fetal ball with a furtive smile on her face, she has come to love her debasement (including an exhibitionistic sex scene that is the reason ''Requiem,'' which opens today at the U.A. Union Square 14, is being released without a rating). Her dank realization is more disturbing than anything in the novel, and Ms. Connelly has never before done anything to prepare us for how good she is here.</p>
        <p>Mr. Aronofsky draws astonishing performances from his actors. Probably the biggest surprise is Mr. Wayans, whose overstimulated comic work can border on hilarity and make you cringe at the same time. His hyperactivity conveys a desperate need for attention, which is frightening from someone who has so much presence. You can't take your eyes off him even though you can sometimes barely stand to look at him.</p>
        <p>Here, as Harry's dreamy running buddy, he lets the charisma do the work for him and lets go of all the tension that tightens his lower jaw muscle. For a moment, you may be unsure if this is Marlon Wayans. It is, though, and his face isn't slack from relaxation; the looseness born of suppression keeps him alert and wired. He is connecting with Mr. Leto, and the two of them make an incredibly real and believable pair. They're looking to score the easy money by selling heroin on the streets.</p>
        <p>After the young director's phenomenal debut with the barely budgeted ''Pi,'' which was like watching a middleweight boxer win a fight purely on reflexes, he comes back with a picture that shows maturation. He has skills, and what works both for him and against him is that he is in as much of a jittery delirium as his characters. It's obvious to say that moviemaking is his high, but it's also undeniable. He doesn't put a gloss on his characters' problems. Their drug gobbling is highlighted, accompanied by slurps, gulps and other loud noises that infantilize their appetites. For them, it's all sensation-seeking, and to a lesser extent it's the case with the movie as well.</p>
        <p>Instead of falling back on the cliche of junkies' vegetative states, Mr. Aronofsky races through their buzzes because he wants to show how quickly the time passes when they're high. And it explains why their lives are so empty when they're not consuming, which drug movies haven't made so clear before. By rushing the addicts' temporary nirvana, ''Requiem'' puts a premium on the valuable drug time.</p>
        <p>''Requiem'' also wants to make the bigger point that addicts are as hooked on the rituals of getting high as they are on the manufactured endorphin rush itself. Mr. Aronofsky has his brilliant cinematographer, Matthew Libatique, shoot these sequences so painstakingly that there is a danger some people will think the film glamorizes the awful habits. It doesn't, and the plunge into the nightmare of continued degradation is rendered as vividly as the ingesting of heroin, cocaine and coffee. And the picture itself looks diseased from the inside, externalizing the sickness of the characters. Often, there is a slightly greenish and bleached tinge that suggests spiritual gangrene.</p>
        <p>The 1970's brought a streak of loser druggie movies, like ''Born to Win,'' ''Panic in Needle Park'' and the festering pallor of ''The Night of the Following Day,'' which could be the spiritual ancestor of ''Requiem.''  These movies floated through the grimy, nothing days of their casts, who tried to hold up their nodding heads long enough to get through a normal day. ''Requiem'' goes a step further; it couldn't be less like a draggy heroin movie. Its full-on assault blazes through the central nervous system faster than any over-the-counter cold medicine, and the relief is instantaneous.</p>
        <p>''Requiem'' is like a Chuck Jones video starring Cool Herk, in which the scratch rhythms on the soundtrack are mirrored by editing so nimble and fast it's like old-school turntable scratching. Refrigerators sprout ravenous jaws, and the view through a filthy window onto a rainy, dark street suddenly becomes sun-kissed and luminous. The people in ''Requiem for a Dream'' can't see anything in front of them, and can't really trust their senses until it's far too late.</p>
        <p>Mr. Aronosfky and Mr. Selby keep snatches of old dialogue -- some of which comes right out of the book -- with its old-fashioned references to ''dope fiends,'' so we can't exactly trust our senses, either. It's never clear when the movie is set, but its Brighton Beach isn't pretty.</p>
        <p>Mr. Aronofsky's style could probably best be described as cyberpulp, a tangle of images with comic panel acuity that he is downloading from his subconscious. To paraphrase a line from a Celine Dion song that might be from the time when this movie was set, the director pushed his accelerator all the way to the Equator.</p>
