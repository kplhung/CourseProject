        <p>Following are excerpts from the vice-presidential debate last night in Danville, Ky., between Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut and Dick Cheney, as recorded by The New York Times. The moderator was Bernard Shaw of CNN.</p>
        <p>The Projected Budget Surplus</p>
        <p>MR. SHAW  Senator, few hard-working Americans would base their well-being on bonuses they hope to get five or 10 years from now. Why do you and you, Secretary Cheney, predict surpluses you cannot possibly guarantee to pay for your proposed programs?</p>
        <p>MR. LIEBERMAN  I'm going to explain tonight how we're going to do all this and remain fiscally responsible. Let me briefly get to your question. . . . We're not spending anymore than is projected by the experts. In fact, unlike our opponents, we're setting aside $300 billion in a reserve fund just in case those projections the nonpartisan experts make are not quite right. We understand that balancing the budget --</p>
        <p>MR. SHAW  Your time is up, Senator.</p>
        <p>MR. LIEBERMAN  -- keeping America out of debt is the way to keep interest rates down and the economy growing.</p>
        <p>MR. SHAW  Secretary Cheney. . . .</p>
        <p>MR. CHENEY  I think it's an extraordinarily important decision we're going to make on Nov. 7. We're really going to choose between what I consider to be an old way of governing ourselves, of high levels of spending, high taxes, an ever more intrusive bureaucracy, or a new course, a new era if you will, and Governor Bush and I want to offer that new course of action.</p>
        <p>With respect to the surplus, Bernie, we've got to make some kind of forecast. We can't make 12-month decisions in this business. We're talking about the kinds of fundamental changes in programs and government that are going to affect people's lives for the next 25 or 30 years. And while it may be a little risky in some respects from an economic standpoint to try to forecast surpluses, I think it's -- you have to make some planning assumption on which you proceed.</p>
        <p>We care a great deal about the issues that are at stake here, and one of the difficulties we have, frankly, is that for the last eight years we've ignored a lot of these problems. We haven't moved aggressively on Social Security. We haven't moved, for example, on Medicare. There are important issues out there that need to be resolved, and it's important for us to get on with our business. And that's what Governor Bush and I want to do.</p>
        <p>Public Education</p>
        <p>MR. SHAW  You alluded to problems. There's no magic bullet, Secretary Cheney, in this question to you, no magic bullets to solve the problems of public education, but what's the next best solution?</p>
        <p>MR. CHENEY  Well, I think public education is the solution. Our desire is to find ways to reform our educational system, to return it to its former glory. I'm a product of public schools, my family, my wife and daughters all went to public schools. We believe very much in the -- in the public school system.</p>
        <p>But if you look at where we are from the standpoint of the nation, recent exams, for example, the National Assessment of Education Progress, independent nonpartisan testing service shows that there's been no progress on reading scores in the last eight years, almost no progress on math. The achievement gap between minority and nonminority students is as big as it's ever been.</p>
        <p>We've had a significant increase in spending for education nationwide but it's produced almost no positive results. That's really unacceptable from our standpoint because if you look at it and think about it we now have in our most disadvantaged communities nearly 70 percent of our fourth graders can't read at basic level. We've graduated 15 million kids from high school in the last 15 years who can't read at basic level. They are permanently sentenced to a lifetime of failure.</p>
        <p>And what we want to do, what Governor Bush and I want to do, is to change that. We think we know how to do it. Governor Bush has done it in Texas. We want to emphasize local control so that the people here in Danville, Ky., decide what's best for their kids. We want to insist on high standards. One of the worst things we can do is fail to establish high standards, in effect to say to a youngster because of ethnic background or their income level, we don't have the same kind of expectations from you that we have for everybody else. And we want accountability. We have to test every child every year to know whether or not we're making progress with respect to achieving those goals and objectives.</p>
        <p>So we think it's extraordinarily important. This is probably the single most important issue in this campaign. Governor Bush has made it clear that when he's elected this will be his No. 1 priority as a legislative major to submit to the Congress.</p>
        <p>MR. SHAW  Senator.</p>
        <p>MR. LIEBERMAN  Bernie, Al Gore and I are committed to making America's public schools the best in the world. And I disagree with what my opponent has said. A lot of progress has been made in recent years. Average testing scores are up and a lot of extraordinary work is being done by tens of thousands of parents and teachers and administrators all around America. But there's more to be done. And if you'll allow me, I want to go back to your last question because it leads to this question. I think both of us agree that, leaving aside the Social Security and Medicare surpluses, there's $1.8 trillion in surplus available to spend over the next 10 years. As I said before, we're being fiscally responsible about it. We're taking $300 billion off the top to put into reserve fund. The rest of it, we're going to use for middle class tax cuts and investments in programs like education.</p>
        <p>Now, there's a big difference here between these two tickets. Our opponents are going to spend $1.6 trillion of the $1.8 trillion surplus projected on that big tax cut that Al Gore talked about the other night so effectively. We're saving money to invest in education. You cannot reform education and improve it in this country without spending some money. Al Gore and I have committed $170 billion for that purpose: to recruit 100,000 new teachers, to reduce the size of classrooms, to help local school districts build new buildings so our children are not learning in crumbling classrooms.</p>
        <p>And we're not just going to stop at high school. We're going to go on and give the middle class the ability to deduct up to $10,000 a year in the cost of college tuition. Now, that's a tremendous life-saving change, which will help people carry on their education and allow them to develop the kinds of skills that will help them succeed in the high-tech economy of today. . . .</p>
        <p>The Gender Gap in Income</p>
        <p>MR. SHAW  Time. The next question goes to you. Gentlemen, this is the 21st century. Yet on average an American working woman in our great nation earns 75 cents for each dollar earned by a working male. What do you males propose to do about it.</p>
        <p>MR. LIEBERMAN  Well, it's a good and an important question. Obviously in our time, fortunately, great advances have been made by women achieving the kind of equality that they were too long denied. But, Bernie, your question is absolutely right. Women, actually the number I have is: receive 72 cents for every dollar a man receives in a comparable job. But Al Gore and I have issued an economic plan in which we've stated specific goals for the future. And one of those goals is to eliminate the pay gap between men and women. It's unfair and it's unacceptable. And the first way we will do that is by supporting the equal pay act which has been proposed in Congress, which gives women the right to file legal actions against employers who are not treating them fairly and not paying them equally. Secondly, we're going to do everything we can using governmental support of business agencies such as the Small Business Administration to help women business owners have an opportunity to invest and begin businesses and make larger incomes themselves. And there are other civil rights and human rights laws that I think can come to play here.</p>
        <p>So, bottom line, this is an unfair and unacceptable situation. And even though as the economy has risen in the last eight years, America's women have risen with it and received more income, until women are receiving the same amount of pay for the same job they're doing as a man receives, we've not achieved genuine equality in this country. And Al Gore and I are committed to closing that gap and achieving that equality.</p>
        <p>You know, in so many families, women are a significant bread earner or the only bread earner. So this, this cause affects not only the women, but families and the children as well.</p>
        <p>MR. SHAW  Mr. Secretary.</p>
        <p>MR. CHENEY  Well, Bernie, I certainly share the view that we ought to have equal pay for equal work regardless of someone's gender and we've made major progress in recent years. I think we've still got a ways to go.</p>
        <p>But I also think it's not just about the differential with respect to women. If you look, for example, at our opponent's tax proposal, they discriminate between stay-at-home moms with children that they take care of themselves and those who go to work or who, in fact, have their kids taken care of outside the home. You, in effect, as a stay-at-home mom get no tax advantage under the Gore tax plan as contrasted with the Bush proposal which, in fact, provides tax relief for absolutely everybody who pays taxes. And it's important to understand that the things that we're trying to change and the things that we're trying to address in the course of the campaign and what our agenda is for the future, our plans are for the future, focus very much upon giving as much control as we can to individual Americans, be they men or women, be they single or married, as much control as possible over their own lives, especially in the area of taxation. We want to make certain that the American people have the ability to keep more of what they earn and then they get to decide how to spend it.</p>
        <p>The proposal we have from -- from Al Gore, basically, doesn't do that. It, in effect, lays out some 29 separate tax credits, and if you live your life the way they want you to live your life, if you do, in fact, behave in a certain way, then you qualify for a tax credit and at that point you get some relief. Bottom line, though, is 50 million American taxpayers out there get no advantages at all out of the Gore tax proposal, whereas under the Bush plan everybody who pays taxes will in fact get tax relief. . . .</p>
        <p>MR. LIEBERMAN  This is an important difference between us and I want to try to clarify briefly if I can.</p>
        <p>The first thing is that, in fact, the tax relief program that Al Gore and I have proposed, one of those many tax credits for the middle class that Dick just referred to includes a $500 tax credit for stay-at-home moms. Just as a way of saying that we understand that you are performing a service for our society, we want you to have that tax credit.</p>
        <p>Second, the number of 50 million Americans not benefiting from our tax cut program is absolutely wrong. It's an estimate done on an earlier form of our tax cut program and it's just plain wrong. And secondly, although Governor Bush says that his tax cut program, large as it is, gives a tax cut to everybody as the newspapers indicated earlier this week, the Joint Committee on Taxation, again a nonpartisan group in Congress, has said that 27 million Americans don't get what the governor said they would in their tax cut program.</p>
        <p>Again, Al Gore and I want to live within our means. We're not going to give it all away in one big tax cut and certainly not to the top one percent of the public that doesn't need it now.</p>
        <p>So we're focusing our tax cuts on the middle class in the areas where they tell us they need it. Tax credits for better and more expensive child care, tax credits for middle-class families that don't have health insurance from their employers, the tax deduction I talked about earlier, very exciting deduction. For up to $10,000 a year in the cost of a college tuition, a $3,000 tax credit for the cost -- well actually, for a family member who stays home with a parent or grandparent who's ill. And a very exciting tax credit program that I hope I'll have a chance to talk about later, Bernie, that encourages savings by people early in life, and anytime in life, by having the federal government match savings for the 75 million Americans who make $100,000 or less up to $2,000 a year. . . .</p>
        <p>MR. CHENEY  Bernie, you had to be a C.P.A. to understand what he just said. The fact of the matter is that that plan is so complex that an ordinary American is never going to be able to figure out what they even qualify for. And it is a classic example of wanting to have a program, in this case a tax program, that will in fact, direct people to live their lives in certain ways, rather than empowering them to make decisions for themselves. It is a big difference between us. They like tax credits. We like tax reform and tax cuts.</p>
        <p>Abortion Pill</p>
        <p>MR. SHAW  Mr. Secretary, this question is for you.</p>
        <p>Would you support the effort of House Republicans who want legislation to restrict distribution of the abortion drug RU486?</p>
        <p>MR. CHENEY  Bernie, the abortion issue is a very tough one, without question, and a very important one. And, Governor Bush and I have emphasized that while we clearly are both pro-life, that's what we believe, that we want to look for ways to try to reduce the incidence of abortion in our society. Many on the pro-choice side have said exactly the same thing. Even Bill Clinton, who's been a supporter of abortion rights, has advocated reducing abortion to make it as rare as possible. With respect to the question of RU486, we believe that of course that it's recently been approved by the F.D.A. That really was a question of whether or not it was safe to be used by women. They didn't address the, sort of the question of whether or not there should or should not be abortion in the society so much as evaluate that particular drug.</p>
        <p>What we'd like to be able to do is to look for ways to reach across the divide between the two points of view and find things that we can do together to reduce the incidence of abortion, we're thinking of such things as promoting adoption as an alternative, encouraging parental notification and we also think banning the horrific practice of partial-birth abortions is an area where there could be agreement. Congress has twice passed, by overwhelming margins, a significant number of votes from both parties, the ban on partial birth abortions. Twice it's been vetoed by Bill Clinton and Al Gore and we would hope that eventually they would recognize that that's not a good position for them to be in. With respect to the RU486 proposal, at this stage, I haven't looked in particular at that particular piece of legislation. Governor Bush made it clear the other night that he did not anticipate that he would be able to go in and direct the F.D.A. to reverse course on that particular issue, primarily because as I say the decision they made was on the efficacy of the drug, not the question of whether or not we supported abortion.</p>
        <p>MR. LIEBERMAN  Bernie, this is a very important question and it is one on which these two tickets have dramatically different points of view. My answer is no, I would not support legislation that is being introduced in Congress to override the Food and Drug Administration decision on RU-486. The administration, F.D.A., worked 12 years on this serious problem. They made a judgment based on what was good for women's health. A doctor has to prescribe and care for a woman using it. I think it's a decision that we ought to let stand because it was made by experts.</p>
        <p>But let me say more generally that the significant difference here on this issue is that Al Gore and I respect and will protect a woman's right to choose. And our opponents will not. We know that this is a difficult personal, moral, medical issue, but that is exactly why it ought to be left under our law to a woman, her doctor and her God. Now, one area in which we agree, Al Gore and I, is that we believe that the government ought to do everything it can to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies, and therefore the number of abortions.</p>
        <p>And incidentally, here there is good news to report. The number of abortions is actually down in America over the last eight years. In fact, over the last eight years the number of teenage pregnancies has dropped 20 percent. And the reason it has is that there are good programs out there that Al Gore and I will continue to support, such as family planning and programs that encourage abstinence. But when the health of a woman is involved, I think the government has to be respectful.</p>
        <p>I supported, in fact, a bill in the Senate that would have prohibited late-term abortions except in cases where the health or life of the mother was involved. I did not support the so-called partial-birth abortion bill because it would have prohibited abortion, that form of abortion, at any stage of the pregnancy regardless of the effect on the health and life of the woman, and that's unacceptable.</p>
        <p>The Situation in Yugoslavia</p>
        <p>MR. SHAW  This question is for you, Senator. If Yugoslavia's Slobodan Milosevic prevails, notwithstanding the election results, would you support his overthrow?</p>
        <p>MR. LIEBERMAN  Well, there is good news from Belgrade today, Bernie, as you know. But it's unconfirmed. The encouraging news is that the state news agency is reporting that Mr. Kostunica is the president-elect. And there are some press reports, but they're unconfirmed, that Milosevic has actually left Belgrade. Now, that is a very happy ending to a terrible story. And it's the end of a reign of terror.</p>
        <p>If that is not confirmed and does not happen, then I think the United States, with its European allies, ought to do everything we can to encourage the people of Serbia to do exactly what they've been doing over the last few days, to rise up and end this reign of terror by Milosevic and bring themselves back into the family of nations where they will be welcomed by the United States and others.</p>
        <p>You know, I'm very proud, on this night, as it appears that Milosevic is about to or has fallen, of the leadership role the United States played in -- in the effort to stop his aggression and genocide in Bosnia and Kosovo.</p>
        <p>I know our opponents have said that they thought that was an overreaching. It wasn't. It was a matter of principle and America's national interest and values. And the fact is that we stopped the aggression; we stopped the genocide. And therefore strengthened our relationship with our European allies in NATO and, in fact, made the United States more respected and trusted by our allies and more feared by our enemies. I think that Vice President Gore played a critical role, passionate, purposive role, in leading the administration, along with Republican supporters like Bob Dole and John McCain, to do the right thing in the Balkans. And, hopefully, tonight we are seeing the final results of that bold and brave effort.</p>
        <p>MR. SHAW  Secretary Cheney.</p>
        <p>MR. CHENEY  Well, I noted, Bernie, that like, Joe, certainly I'm pleased to see what's happened in Yugoslavia today. I hope it marks the end of Milosevic. I think probably more than anything else it's a victory for the Serbian people. They've taken to the streets to support their democracy, to support their vote. In some respects this is a continuation of a process that began 10 years ago all across Eastern Europe and has only now arrived in Serbia. We saw it Germany. We saw it in Romania. We saw it in Czechoslovakia as the people of Eastern Europe rose up and made their claim for freedom. And I think we all admire that.</p>
        <p>I think with respect to how this process has been managed most recently, we want to do everything we can to support Mr. Milosevic's departure. Certainly, though, that would not involve committing U.S. troops. I do think it's noteworthy that there appears to be an effort under way to get the Russians involved. I noted the other night, for example, Tuesday night, in the debate in Boston, Governor Bush suggested exactly that, that we ought to try to get the Russians involved to exercise some leverage over the Serbians, and Al Gore pooh-poohed it. But now it's clear from the press that, in fact, that's exactly what they were doing and that Governor Bush was correct in his assessment and his recommendation.</p>
        <p>He has supported the administration on Kosovo. He lobbied actively against passage of the Byrd-Warner provision which would have set a specific deadline, one he felt that was too soon for forcing U.S. troops out. So he's been supportive of the policy that -- that we've seen with respect to Yugoslavia and I think he deserves a lot of credit for that.</p>
        <p>I'd go beyond that. I think this is an opportunity for the United States to test President Putin of Russia. That, in fact, now is the time when we ought to find out whether or not he is indeed committed to democracy, whether or not he's willing to support the forces of freedom and democracy diplomatically in the area there of Eastern Europe, and it's a test for him, in effect, of whether he represents the old guard in the Soviet Union.</p>
        <p>One of the most important challenges we face as a nation is how we manage that process of integrating those 150 million Eastern Europeans into the security and economic framework of Europe.</p>
        <p>Military Readiness</p>
        <p>MR. SHAW  Your question, Mr. Secretary. You and Governor Bush charge that the Clinton-Gore administration have presided over the deterioration and overextension of America's armed forces. Should U.S. military personnel be deployed as warriors or peacekeepers?</p>
        <p>MR. CHENEY  My preference is to deploy them as warriors. There may be occasion when it's appropriate to use them in a peacekeeping role, but I think that role ought to be limited. I think there ought to be a time limit on it. The reason we have a military is to be able to fight and win wars and to maintain it with sufficient strength so that would-be adversaries are deterred from ever launching a war in the first place.</p>
        <p>I think that the administration has, in fact, in this area, failed in a major responsibility. We've seen a reduction in our forces, far beyond anything that was justified by the end of the cold war. The same time we've seen a rapid expansion of our commitments around the world as troops have been sent hither and yon.</p>
        <p>Testimony just last week by the Joint Chiefs of Staff before the House Armed Services Committee that pointed out a lot of these problems, that the -- for example, Gen. Mike Ryan of the Air Force -- that with 40 percent fewer aircraft he's now undertaking three times as many deployments on a regular basis as he had to previously. So we're overcommitted and we're underresourced.</p>
        <p>This has had some other unfortunate effects. I saw a letter, for example, the other day from a young captain stationed down in Fort Bragg, a graduate of West Point of '95, getting ready to get out of the service, because he's only allowed to train with his troops when fuel is available for the vehicles and, and only allowed to fire their weapons twice a year.</p>
        <p>He's concerned that if he ever had to send them into combat it would mean lives lost. That is a legitimate concern, and this is a very important area and the fact the U.S. military is worse off today than it was eight years ago, a major responsibility for us in the future and a high priority for myself and Governor Bush will be to rebuild the U.S. military to give them the resources they need to do the job we ask them to do for us and to give them good leadership.</p>
        <p>MR. SHAW  Senator, you're shaking your head in disagreement.</p>
        <p>MR. LIEBERMAN  Well, I am, Bernie. And, most important, I want to assure the American people that the American military is the best-trained, best-equipped, most powerful force in the world and that Al Gore and I will do whatever it takes to keep them that way. It's not right, and it's not good for our military, to run them down, essentially, in the midst of a partisan political debate. The fact is that you've got to judge the military by what the military leaders say. And Secretary Bill Cohen, a good Republican, General Shelton, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, both will tell you that the American military is ready to meet any threat we may face in the world today. And the fact is, judging by its results from Desert Storm to the Balkans, Bosnia and Kosovo to the operations that are still being conducted to keep Saddam Hussein in the box in Iraq, the American military has performed brilliantly. In fact, this administration had turned around the drop in spending on the military that began in the mid-80's and went right through the Bush-Cheney administration and the early years of the Clinton administration. But now that's stopped. In fact, we passed the largest pay increase in a generation for our military. And the interesting fact here, in spite of the rhetoric that my opponent has just spoken, is that the -- reality is that if you look at our projected budgets for the next 10 years, Al Gore and I actually commit more than twice as much -- $100 billion -- in additional funding for our military than Governor Bush does. And their budget allows nothing additional for acquisition of new weapons systems. And that's something that the same general, Mike Ryan of the Air Force, and all the other chiefs of the services, will not be happy about because they need the new equipment, the new systems, that Al Gore and I are committed to giving them.</p>
        <p>MR. CHENEY  Bernie, this is a special interest of mine. I'd like a chance to elaborate further if I might.</p>
        <p>The facts are dramatically different. I'm not attacking the military, Joe. I have enormous regard for the men and women of the U.S. military. I had the great privilege of working with them for the four years I was Secretary of Defense and no one has a higher regard than I do for them. But it's irresponsible to suggest that we should not have this debate in a presidential campaign, that we should somehow ignore what is a major, major concern. And if you have friends or relatives serving in the U.S. military you know there's a problem. If you look at the data that's available: 40 percent of our army helicopters that are not combat ready; combat-readiness level in the Air Force that's dropped from 85 percent to 65 percent; significant problems of retention. The important thing for us to remember is that we're a democracy and we're defended by volunteers.</p>
        <p>Everybody out there tonight wearing the uniform, standing on guard to protect the United States is there because they volunteered to put on the uniform. And when we don't give them the spare parts they need to maintain their equipment, when we don't give our pilots the flying hours they need to maintain their proficiency, when we don't give them the kind of leadership that spells out what their mission is and lets them know why they're there and what they're doing, why they're putting their lives at risk, then we undermine that morale. That is an extraordinarily valuable trust. There is no more important responsibility for a president of the United States than his role as commander in chief and the obligation that he undertakes on behalf of all of us to decide when to send our young men and women to war. When we send them without the right kind of training, when we send them poorly equipped or with equipment that's old and broken down, we put their lives at risk. We will suffer more casualties in the next conflict if we don't look to those basic fundamental problems. . . .</p>
        <p>MR. LIEBERMAN  Bernie, I think it's very important to respond to this. Yes, of course, it's an important debate to have as part of this campaign but I don't want either the military to feel uneasy or the American people to feel insecure. And what I'm saying now I am basing on service, on the Senate Armed Services Committee talking to exactly the people Dick Cheney has mentioned, the Secretary of Defense, the Chiefs of Staff. I've visited our fighting forces around the world and I'm telling you that we are ready to meet any contingency that might arise.</p>
        <p>The good news here and the interesting news is that we have met our recruitment targets in each of the services this year. In fact, in the areas where our opponents have said we are overextended, such as the Balkans, the soldiers there have the higher rate of re-enlistment than anywhere else in the service because they feel a sense of purpose, a sense of mission.</p>
        <p>In fact, this administration has begun to transform the American military. To take it away from being a cold war force. To prepare it to meet the threats of the new generation of tomorrow, of weapons of mass destruction, of ballistic missiles, of terrorism, even of cyberwarfare.</p>
        <p>And the fact is that Governor Bush recommended in his major policy statement on the military earlier this year that we skip the next generation of military equipment -- helicopters, submarines, tactical air-fighters, all the rest. That would really cripple our readiness, exactly the readiness that Dick Cheney is talking about.</p>
        <p>Al Gore and I are committed to continuing this acquisition program, transforming the military. There's fewer people in uniform today but person to person -- person by person, unit by unit, this is the most powerful and effective military not only in the world today but in the history of the world. And again, Al Gore and I will do whatever is necessary to keep it that way.</p>
        <p>Middle East Peace Prospects</p>
        <p>MR. SHAW  Senator Lieberman, this question to you. Once again in the Middle East peace talks on the one hand, deadly confrontations on the other and the flash point Jerusalem. And then there's Syria. Is United States policy what it should be?</p>
        <p>MR. LIEBERMAN  Yes, it is. It has truly pained me in the last week, Bernie, to watch the unrest and the death occurring in the Middle East between the Israelis and the Palestinians. So much work has been done by the people there with the support of this administration, so much progress has been made in the original Oslo Agreements between the Israelis and the Palestinians adopted in 1993 in the peace between Israel and Jordan thereafter.</p>
        <p>I mean, America has a national strategic interest and a principled interest in peace in the Middle East. And Al Gore has played a critical role in advancing that process over the last eight years. What pains me as I watch the unrest in recent days between the Israelis and the Palestinians is that these two peoples have come, in some senses, generations forward, centuries forward in the last seven years. They are so close to a final peace agreement.</p>
        <p>I hope and pray that the death and unrest in the last week will not create the kinds of scars that make it hard for them to go back to the peace table with American assistance, and achieve what I'm convinced the great majority of the Israeli and Palestinian people want, indeed people throughout the Middle East, which is peace.</p>
        <p>Secretary Albright has been in Paris meeting with Prime Minister Barak and Chairman Arafat. I hope and pray that her mission is successful, that there is a cease-fire and the parties return to the peace table.</p>
        <p>Now we've been on a very constructive course in the Middle East, played an unusual, unique role. And I am convinced that Al Gore and I, I commit that Al Gore and I will continue to do that. I hope I might, through my friendships in Israel and throughout the Arab world, play a unique role in bringing peace to this sacred region of the world.</p>
        <p>MR. CHENEY  Bernie, it has been a very, very difficult area to work in for a long time. Numerous administrations going back, certainly to World War II, have had to wrestle with the problem of what should happen to the Middle East. We made significant breakthroughs, I think, at the end of the Bush administration because of the Gulf War. In effect, we had joined together with Arab allies and done enormous damage to the Iraqi armed forces, and Iraq, at the time, was the biggest military threat to Israel. By virtue of the end of the cold war, the Soviets were no longer a factor. They used to fish in troubled waters whenever they had the opportunity in the Middle East. But with the end of the Soviet Union, the implosion, if you will, of the empire, that created a vacuum, if you will, and made it easier for us to operate there.</p>
        <p>We were able to, I think, reassure both Arabs and Israelis that the United States would play a major role there, that we had the ability and the will to deploy forces to the region if we had to to engage in military operations to support our friends and oppose our foes. And of course we were able to convene the Madrid conference that in effect was the first time Arabs and Israelis sat down face to face and began this process of trying to move the peace process forward.</p>
        <p>I think also a lot of credit goes to some great men like Yitzhak Rabin. His tragic passing was of major consequence, a great tragedy for everybody who cares about peace in the Middle East. He was a man who had the military stature to be able to confidently persuade the Israelis, I think, to take some risks for peace. I think Prime Minister Barak has tried the same thing. I hope that we can get this resolved as soon as possible. My guess is that the next administration is going to be the one that's going to have to come to grips with the current state of affairs there. I think it's very important that we have an administration where we have a president with firm leadership who has the kind of track record of dealing straight with people, of keeping his word so that friends and allies both respect us and our adversaries fear us.</p>
        <p>Policy Toward Iraq</p>
        <p>MR. SHAW  This question is for you, Mr. Secretary. If Iraq's President Saddam Hussein were found to be developing weapons of mass destruction, Governor Bush has said he would ''take him out.'' Would you agree with such a deadly policy?</p>
        <p>MR. CHENEY  We might have no other choice. We'll have to see if that happens. The thing about Iraq, of course, was at the end of the war we had pretty well decimated their military. We had put them back in a box, so to speak. We had a strong international coalition raid against them, effective economic sanctions and a very robust inspection regime that was in place. So that the inspection regime under U.N. auspices was able to do a good job of stripping out the capacity to build weapons of mass destruction -- the work that he'd been doing that had not been destroyed during the war on biological, chemical agents as well as a nuclear program. Unfortunately, now we find ourselves in a situation where that's started to fray on us, where the coalition now no longer is tied tightly together.</p>
        <p>Recently the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, two Gulf states, have reopened diplomatic relations with Baghdad. The Russians and the French now are flying commercial airliners back into Baghdad and sort of thumbing their nose, if you will, at the international sanctions regime. And of course the U.N. inspectors have been kicked out. And there's been absolutely no response.</p>
        <p>So we're in a situation today where I think our posture vis-s-vis Iraq is weaker than it was at the end of the war. I think that's unfortunate. I also think it's unfortunate that we find ourselves in a position where we don't know for sure what might be transpiring inside Iraq.</p>
        <p>I certainly hope he's not regenerating that kind of capability. But if he were, if in fact Saddam Hussein were taking steps to try to rebuild nuclear capability or weapons of mass destruction, you'd have to give very serious consideration to military action to stop that activity. I don't think you can afford to have a man like Saddam Hussein with nuclear weapons, say, in the Middle East.</p>
        <p>MR. SHAW  Senator.</p>
        <p>MR. LIEBERMAN  Bernie, it would, of course, be a very serious situation if we had evidence, credible evidence, that Saddam Hussein was developing weapons of mass destruction. But I must say I don't think a political campaign is the occasion to declare exactly what we would do in that case. I think that's a matter of such critical national security importance that it ought to be left to those commander in chief, the leaders of the military, the secretary of state to make that kind of decision without the heat of a political campaign.</p>
        <p>The fact is that we will not enjoy real stability in the Middle East until Saddam Hussein is gone. The gulf war was a great victory. And incidentally, Al Gore and I were two of the ten Democrats in the Senate who crossed party lines to support President Bush and Secretary Cheney in that war, and we're both very proud that we did that.</p>
        <p>But the war did not end with a total victory and Saddam Hussein remained there. And as a result we have had almost 10 years now of instability. We have continued to operate, almost all of this time, military action to enforce a no-fly zone. We have been struggling with Saddam about the inspectors. We ought to do, and we are doing everything we can, to get those inspectors back in there.</p>
        <p>But in the end, there's not going to be peace until he goes. And that's why I was proud to co-sponsor the Iraq Liberation Act with Senator Trent Lott, why I have kept in touch with the indigenous Iraqi opposition broad based to Saddam Hussein. Vice President Gore met with them earlier this year. We are supporting them in their efforts and we will continue to support them until the Iraqi people rise up and do what the people of Serbia have done in the last few days, get rid of a despot. We will welcome you back into the family of nations where you belong.</p>
        <p>Rising Oil Prices</p>
        <p>MR. SHAW  Senator Lieberman, this question is to you.</p>
        <p>Many experts are forecasting continuing chaotic oil prices in the world market. Wholesale natural gas prices here in our country are leaping. Then there are coal and electricity. Have previous Republican and Democratic congresses and administrations, including this one, done their job to protect the American people?</p>
        <p>MR. LIEBERMAN  Not enough. But this administration and Vice President Gore and I have had both a long-term strategy to develop energy independence and a short-term strategy. In fact, if this administration had been given the amount of funding that it had requested from the Republican Congress, we'd be further along in the implementation of that long-term strategy which is aimed at developing alternative cleaner sources of energy aimed at giving tax credits to individuals and businesses to conserve and use energy more efficiently, aimed at a partnership for a new generation of vehicles with the American automobile industry which is making great progress and can produce a vehicle that can get 80 miles per gallon. We also have a short-term strategy and it's a deal with exactly the kind of ups and downs of energy prices and I know it was controversial. But Al Gore and I believed that it was important in the short term to reach into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, take some of that oil that we have, put it in the market, show the big oil companies and the OPEC oil-producing countries that we've got some resources with which we can fight back. We're not just going to lay back and let them roll over our economy. And we did it also because gasoline prices were rising and home heating oil inventories were real low. And both of our tickets agree on LIHAP, Low Income Housing Assistance Program, but our opponents really offer no assistance to middle-class families who are hit by rising gas prices and a shortage of home heating oil. The fact is that since the reserve was opened the price of oil on world markets has dropped $6 a barrel. Now that's a good result and I'm proud of it.</p>
        <p>MR. SHAW  Mr. Secretary?</p>
        <p>MR. CHENEY  Bernie, this is an area where, again, I think Joe and I have fairly significant disagreements. My assessment is that there is no comprehensive energy policy today. That as a nation we are in trouble because the administration has not addressed these issues. We have the prospects of brownouts in California. We have a potential home heating oil crisis in the Northeast. We've got gasoline price rises various other places.</p>
        <p>For years now the administration's talked about reducing our dependence on foreign sources of oil but they haven't done it. In fact, we've gone exactly in the opposite direction. We've got the lowest rate of domestic production of oil now in 46 years. You have to go back to 1954 to find a time when we produced as little oil as we do today.</p>
        <p>Our imports are all-time record high. In the month of June we imported almost 12 million barrels a day. That means we're more subject to the wide fluctuations and swings in price.</p>
        <p>We have other problems. We don't have refinery capacity. We haven't built a new refinery in this country for over 10 years. And the refineries are now operating at 96 or 97 percent capacity, which means even with more crude available they're probably not going to be able to do very much by way of producing additional home heating oil for this winter. We have a long-term, serious long-term problem with our growing independence on foreign sources of energy. That will always be the case but we ought to be able to shift the trend and begin to move it in the right direction.</p>
        <p>We need to do a lot more about generating the capacity for power here at home. We need to get on with the business and we think we can do it and very safely in an environmentally sound manner.</p>
        <p>We don't think that we ought to by into this false choice that somehow we cannot develop energy resources without being cautious with the environment. We can. We've got the technology to do it and we ought to do it.</p>
        <p>We do support the low-income assistance program. We think that's very important so that senior citizens, for example, don't suffer this winter.</p>
        <p>But we need to get on with the business of having a plan to develop our domestic energy resources and producing more supplies. And this administration hasn't produced them.</p>
        <p>The Future of Social Security</p>
        <p>MR. SHAW  This question is for you, Senator. We all know Social Security is the backbone of the retirement system in our nation. Can either of you pledge, tonight, categorically, that no one will lose benefits under your plans?</p>
        <p>MR. LIEBERMAN  Ah, yes indeed. I can pledge to the American people categorically that no one will lose benefits under our plan for Social Security as far forward as 2054. And let me come back and say, Bernie, that Al Gore and I view Social Security as probably the best thing the government did in the second half of the last century. It has created a floor under which seniors cannot fall. And so many of them depend on it for their basic living, for their livelihood. It is critically important to protect it. That's why Al and I have committed to, to putting that Social Security surplus in a lock box, not touching it. And that's what allows us to keep Social Security solvent to 2054. . . .</p>
        <p>MR. CHENEY  You won't be surprised, Bernie, if I disagree with Joe's description of our program. The fact of the matter is the Social Security system's in trouble. It's been a fantastic program. It's been there for 65 years, it's provided benefits for -- for senior citizens over that period of time, for my parents. It means a great deal to -- to millions of Americans. And Governor Bush and I want to make absolutely certain that the first thing we do is guarantee the continuation of those payments, those benefits and keep those promises that were made.</p>
        <p>But if you look down the road and if you're, say, 30 years old today, and I have two daughters about that age, they seriously question whether or not there'll be any system left for them, and that's because the demographics that are work out there, and it's almost an iron law, we know how many people there are, we know when they're going to reach retirement age, we know when that baby boom generation's coming along, we know how long people are likely to live after that.</p>
        <p>That's going to drive the system into bankruptcy unless we reform it and deal with it.</p>
        <p>The reform we would like to offer is to allow our young people to begin to take a portion of the payroll tax, 2 percent of it, and invest it in a personal retirement account. That does several things. First of all, it gives them a stake in the Social Security system, that becomes their property, they own it. They can pass it on to their kids if they want. They don't have that kind of equity in Social Security today.</p>
        <p>Secondly, we can generate a higher return off that investment than you get in the existing system. Today, you get about a 2 percent return in your -- what you pay into Social Security. We can generate, we think, at least 6 percent. All the evidence shows at least three times what we're able to get now.</p>
        <p>And long term, by generating a longer -- a bigger return, we'll put additional funds into the system that will help us survive that crunch that's otherwise going to hit in the future. . . .</p>
        <p>Racial Profiling</p>
        <p>MR. SHAW  Dick Cheney, Joe Lieberman, you are black for this question. Imagine yourself an African-American. You become the target of racial profiling either while walking or driving. African-American Joseph Lieberman, what would you do about it?</p>
        <p>MR. LIEBERMAN  I'd be outraged. It is such an assault on the basic promise that America makes that the law will treat individuals as individuals regardless of their status. That is to say their race, their nationality, their gender, their sexual orientation, etc., etc. And the sad fact is that racial profiling occurs in this country.</p>
        <p>I have a few African-American friends who've gone through this horror. And, you know, it makes me want to kind of hit the wall because it is such an assault on their humanity and their citizenship. And we can't tolerate it anymore.</p>
        <p>That's why I've supported legislation in the first instance in Congress because it's the most we could get done to do hard studies to make the case of the extent to which racial profiling is occurring in our country.</p>
        <p>But it's also why I'm so proud that Al Gore has said two things. First, we would issue, if we're fortunate enough to be elected, an executive order prohibiting racial profiling. And secondly, the first civil rights act legislation we would send to Congress would be a national ban on racial profiling. It is just wrong. It is un-American. And to think that in the 21st century this kind of nonsense is still going on, we've got to stop it.</p>
        <p>And the only way to stop it is through the law. I mean the law, after all, is meant to express our values and our aspirations for our society. And our values are violently contradicted by the kind of racial profiling that I know exist.</p>
        <p>And I just had a friend a while ago, Bernie, who works in the government, works at the White House, African American, stopped, surrounded by police for -- for no other cause that anyone can determine than -- than the color of his skin. That can't be in America anymore.</p>
        <p>MR. SHAW  Mr. Secretary.</p>
        <p>MR. CHENEY  Well, Bernie, I -- I'd like to answer your question to the best of my ability but I -- I don't think I can understand fully what it would be like. Try hard to put myself in that position and imagine what it'd been like, but, of course, I've always been part of the majority and never been part of a -- of a minority group. But it has to be a horrible experience. It's the -- the sense of anger and frustration and rage that would go with going with knowing that the only reason you were stopped, the only reason you were arrested was because of your color of your skin, would make me extraordinarily angry. And I'm not sure how I would respond.</p>
        <p>I think that we have to recognize that while we've made enormous progress in the U.S. in racial relations and we have come a very long way, we still have a long way to go. That we still have not only the problems we're talking about here tonight in terms of the problems that you mentioned of profiling. But beyond that we still have achievement gap in education, income differentials, differences in life span.</p>
        <p>We still have, I think, a society where we haven't done enough yet to live up to that standard that we'd all like to live up to, I think, in terms of equality of opportunity, that we judge people as individuals, that, as Martin Luther King said, we ought to judge people on the content of their character instead of the color of their skin. I would hope that we can continue to make progress in that regard in the years ahead.</p>
