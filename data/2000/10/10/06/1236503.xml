        <p>The MetroStars have a simple formula for success going into the third and deciding game of their second-round Major League Soccer playoff matchup against the Chicago Fire tonight: repeat their performance from their last game when they played the best game in their five-year history.</p>
        <p>''I know Chicago will be a different environment than Giants Stadium, but intensity and effort from the heart will do it,'' defender Mike Petke said before the MetroStars left for Chicago yesterday afternoon.</p>

        <p>The MetroStars have a simple formula for success going into the third and deciding game of their second-round Major League Soccer playoff matchup against the Chicago Fire tonight: repeat their performance from their last game when they played the best game in their five-year history.</p>
        <p>''I know Chicago will be a different environment than Giants Stadium, but intensity and effort from the heart will do it,'' defender Mike Petke said before the MetroStars left for Chicago yesterday afternoon.</p>
        <p>Petke's marking of Chicago's Hristo Stoichkov will be a key for the MetroStars tonight. Petke was mediocre in marking Stoichkov in the first game of the series, a 3-0 victory for the Fire, but he did extremely well in the return match, a 2-0 triumph for the MetroStars at Giants Stadium.</p>
        <p>If Petke matches his success from Game 2 against Stoichkov, the world player of the year in 1992 and the European player of the year in 1994, the MetroStars will increase their chances of reaching the championship game, M.L.S. Cup 2000, which will be played Oct. 15 in R.F.K. Stadium in Washington.</p>
        <p>Mike Ammann, whose early return from injuries inspired the MetroStars to even the semifinal series last Saturday, used the same scenario as Petke, but the goalkeeper went a step further, saying that a key for the MetroStars will be the performance of Lothar Matthaus.</p>
        <p>Matthaus, 39, played his best game as a MetroStar in the victory over Chicago. He did a masterful job defensively and got involved in numerous plays on attack. He also displayed a great deal of exuberance and made several remarkable plays in Wednesday's practice.</p>
        <p>''Lothar plays with so much passion that when I see this kind of effort it pumps me up,'' Ammann said.</p>
        <p>Matthaus was even praised for his performance on Saturday by MetroStars Coach Octavio Zambrano, his  severest critic. Zambrano rarely gave credit to Matthaus for any of the team's success this season, but he went as far to use the word great to describe Matthaus after practice one day this week.</p>
        <p>''I came here to help the team win a championship,'' Matthaus said. ''If we play simple and with the heart like we did the last game, we'll be in the final.''</p>
        <p>Rather than worry about the Fire or the possibility that it will have all its players available tonight, Zambrano has been preoccupied with the way his team will play in Game 3.</p>
        <p>Chicago will present an even stronger challenge than it did in the first two games with the return from the Olympics of striker Josh Wolff and defender Evan Whitfield. Peter Nowak, Chicago's playmaker, who played in the first game of this series but missed the second because of an injury, may also return.</p>
        <p>''I never put emphasis on preparing for the other team's alignment,'' Zambrano said. ''We know what we have to do and if we take care of business, we'll be O.K.''</p>
        <p>CORNER KICKS</p>
        <p>LOTHAR MATTHAUS told the MetroStars yesterday that if anyone asked him about a report in Europe that he had applied for the vacant coaching job at Inter Milan, where he played for four years starting in 1988, he would have no comment. His contract with Major League Soccer is for one year and he said recently he would stay in soccer, but not necessarily with the MetroStars. . . . TAB RAMOS practiced with the team Thursday for the first time since pulling a muscle in his groin a week ago, but his status is uncertain.</p>
