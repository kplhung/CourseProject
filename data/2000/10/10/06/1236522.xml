        <p>Federal prosecutors in Manhattan have opened a criminal investigation into the actions of a police officer who threw his radio at a fleeing suspect who later died, according to lawyers involved with the case.</p>
        <p>The city has already agreed to settle a civil lawsuit claiming that the police used excessive force and violated the civil rights of the man, Kenneth Banks, 36, whose skull was fractured in the Oct. 29, 1998, incident. Mr. Banks died 12 days later.</p>
        <p>A letter filed in the civil case, which was settled for more than $1 million including lawyers' fees, disclosed that federal prosecutors from the office of Mary Jo White, the United States attorney for Manhattan, are presenting evidence to a grand jury. A lawyer involved in the case said the civil rights investigation focused on Officer Craig Yokemick, who threw a hand-held radio at Mr. Banks as he fled the police.</p>
        <p>Marvin Smilon, a spokesman for Ms. White, would not discuss the case yesterday.</p>
        <p>The federal investigation comes after the Manhattan district attorney's office investigated the incident for six months and presented evidence to a state grand jury in 1999. That panel found that the force Officer Yokemick used was justified, and it voted to bring no criminal charges. Despite the state panel's conclusions, federal authorities could bring charges against him if a federal grand jury finds that his actions violated Mr. Banks's civil rights.</p>
        <p>Lawyers for the Banks family had charged in their civil lawsuit that the radio caused Mr. Banks's death. But lawyers for Officer Yokemick, the city and other officers named in the civil suit contended he suffered the fractured skull when he fell from a bicycle he was riding to escape the officers, who said they witnessed him selling drugs.</p>
        <p>Mr. Banks was charged with misdemeanor drug possession when crack residue was found in a vial in his pocket after the incident at East 125th Street and Madison Avenue.</p>
        <p>Stuart London, a lawyer for Officer Yokemick, said, ''It's our position that there has been no misconduct at all on the part of Officer Yokemick.''</p>
        <p>While it was unclear last night what specifically the prosecutors investigating the criminal case were focusing on, the civil lawsuit charged that Officer Yokemick threw the radio, causing the death of Mr. Banks, and that other officers later conspired to cover up the use of force in the arrest.</p>
        <p>The lawsuit also said that the officers failed to obtain medical treatment for Mr. Banks, despite the fact that he suffered seizures in his cell at the 25th Precinct station house.</p>
        <p>''There is no question that there was a golden hour of opportunity to save Kenneth Banks's life and the Police Department deprived him of that window,'' said the Banks's family lawyer, Ilann Maazel, of Emery Cuti Brinckerhoff &amp; Abady.</p>
        <p>The Police Department has brought administrative charges against Officer Yokemick for unauthorized use of his radio and recommended that he lose 20 vacation days as punishment. A department judge has not yet issued a decision in the case.</p>
