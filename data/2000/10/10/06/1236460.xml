        <p>A Good Lesson In Improvisation</p>
        <p>The show business cliche that applies here is: The show must go on. If there were a cliche about being careful where you store your things while you are out of town, it would also apply.</p>
        <p>Three hours before curtain time on Wednesday, the cast of the high-spirited revue ''It Ain't Nothin' but the Blues'' returned to the B. B. King Blues Club and Grill after a week of performances in Grand Rapids, Mich. The stage managers discovered that most of the equipment for the show (costumes, music stands, guitar cables, electronic video equipment and the computers that run it, as well as the stage manager's prompt book) had been stolen from a storage room.</p>
        <p>The equipment had been left in a locked storage room at the club, but the lead producer, ERIC KREBS, said that workers installing a sprinkler system during the company's absence had unlocked the room.</p>
        <p>Mr. Krebs said he gave the assistant stage manager, MARK SHARP, all the cash he was carrying, about $300, and sent Mr. Sharp out to buy what he could. In the meantime, there was the matter of a rehearsal, which had been called because an understudy, KELLI RABKE, was to appear in the show for the first time.</p>
        <p>''It was just one of those things that happens,'' Mr. Krebs said. A spokeswoman for the club added, ''The club is going to cooperate with the police and do everything it can to be helpful.''</p>
        <p>Some Actors Play But Don't Watch</p>
        <p>There are stars who do not watch their onscreen performances. DAN AYKROYD said the other day that he was one of them, but that he had made an exception for his new film, ''The House of Mirth,'' based on Edith Wharton's dark novel about high-powered society in turn-of-the-last-century New York.</p>
        <p>''GILLIAN ANDERSON carries this movie, which is an arc of tragedy about growing up in society in New York,'' Mr. Aykroyd said. ''I even like it. Usually I just do my work and go home, but this I watched.''</p>
        <p>The talk show host JERRY SPRINGER said he would never watch his program. No hair-pulling brawls for him.</p>
        <p>''I'm not interested in it; it's not aimed toward me,'' he told Reuters in London, where he is presenting his show in a different format. ''This is just a silly show. I don't take it seriously. But when people argue about the show intellectually, then I'm prepared to answer about why I think it is O.K. to do it and why I think it's important that shows like that are on the air.''</p>
        <p>Reuters said that the British version of the show would concentrate on celebrities rather than on tell-all confessionals from ordinary people.</p>
        <p>Profile in Courage</p>
        <p>CHRISTIE BRINKLEY had a two-word explanation for her quick trip to Texas the other day: MICHAEL P. FORBES. Mr. Forbes is the congressman who switched party affiliation from Republican to Democrat last year, only to be defeated in the Democratic primary last month.</p>
        <p>''That was an eye opener,'' said Ms. Brinkley, a Democrat whose house in the Hamptons is in Mr. Forbes's district. ''The woman who won doesn't have a shot.''</p>
        <p>So Ms. Brinkley went to Texas to campaign for REPRESENTATIVE MAX SANDLIN, who, as a deputy whip during the House proceedings on President Clinton's impeachment, helped keep Democrats in line.</p>
        <p>''The Democrats are not going to let another man down,'' he said. ''I know people feel as though we let Congressman Forbes down. Here's a guy who had the courage to switch parties. If anybody else sees the light and wants to think again, they're going to think of Congressman Forbes and think, 'Is this really wise?' ''</p>
