        <p>Halloween may still be a few weeks in the future, but too many ghosts are hanging around ''Bootmen.''</p>
        <p>They are the ghosts of other, better movies in the same vein, and as much as ''Bootmen'' brings attractive leads and a tried and often true story to the screen, its failure to ignite its familiar materials seems likely to condemn this Australian film to an early grave.</p>
        <p>Too much soap opera colors its love story, and the industrial-strength dancing by booted men that is its centerpiece falls short of exhilaration.</p>
        <p>Combining elements seen in everything from old Andy Hardy movies to ''The Glenn Miller Story'' and even ''The Full Monty,'' ''Bootmen'' is a tale of a talented maverick with an artistic vision that culminates in a let's-put-on-a-show night of triumph.</p>
        <p>In the case of ''Bootmen,'' inspired by the early life of its director, Dein Perry, creator of the hit show ''Tap Dogs,'' the maverick is Sean Okden (Adam Garcia), a gifted but independent-minded dancer who toils unenthusiastically in the steelworks where his sullen widowed father, Gary (Richard Carter), has found professional security.</p>
        <p>When Sean has a chance to join a musical in Sydney, Dad, of course, resists. Given to swilling beer and watching rugby on television, Gary favors his comparatively sensible elder son, Mitchell (Sam Worthington), whose dream is to accumulate enough money to own first one truck and then a fleet of rigs.</p>
        <p>So Sean defies Dad and speeds off on his motorcycle to Sydney, leaving behind his lovely new girlfriend, Linda (Sophie Lee), the proprietor of a beauty salon called Curl Up 'n' Dye. And the plot is set on its course toward vigorous dance and warmed-over schmaltz.</p>
        <p>While Sean is drawing the resentment of the musical's star because he has drawn the eye of the star's girlfriend, Mitch is speeding up his ambition to own a truck by stealing cars and selling their parts.</p>
        <p>So by the time Sean has been fired from the show and returned to his hometown, Mitch has incurred the wrath of the town's major car thief and has managed to bed an inebriated Linda, a feat that requires her to step out of the go-slow character she has established with Sean.</p>
        <p>Rather than return to the steelworks, Sean has an idea: industrial-strength dancing, using boots fitted with taps, the sound of heavy metal on all manner of steel, and rock music.</p>
        <p>Dealing with his feelings toward the repentant Linda and his hell-bound brother, Sean gathers some old dance-school mates and, like Glenn Miller searching for the right sound, tries to iron out the kinks on the path to his dream. Even so, prospects of anybody turning out for a performance seem slim until the announcement that the steel factory is being shut down and major unemployment lies in store for most of the men in town.</p>
        <p>But what if they could be retrained? What if someone could raise enough money to buy computers to fit these men for employment in the information age? Why not put on a show right in the old steelworks?</p>
        <p>Emphasizing the novelty of its dance, ''Bootmen'' is actually stomping without particular distinction over very well-beaten terrain.</p>
        <p>''Bootmen'' is rated R (under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It involves coarse language and violence.</p>
