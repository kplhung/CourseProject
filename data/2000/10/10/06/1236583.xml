        <p>A Queens company that makes furniture and equipment for beauty salons and barber shops will remain in Flushing and expand, rather than move out of state, preserving 110 jobs and adding about 20 more, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani announced</p>
        <p>The mayor said on Wednesday that the company, P.S. Pibbs, would buy and renovate a 41,000-square-foot building and other property with aid from the city's Industrial Development Agency, which would provide about $2 million in tax-exempt bond financing and up to $978,000 in real estate and sales tax exemptions.</p>
        <p>The mayor said the company had been considering moving to Virginia or Florida.</p>
        <p>Four other small companies are to receive similar assistance to buy or construct building in which to expand, leading to the retention and creation of more than 150 other jobs in the city, he said.</p>
        <p>The mayor's office identified the other companies as Kaylim Supply, a Bronx wholesaler of hardware products to the construction, maintenance and electrical industries; Sarad, a Brooklyn wholesaler of auto parts for fleet vehicles; Hyde Park Fine Art of Moldings, a Queens maker of architectural ornamentation, and the combination of Alrue Import  and RENCO Manufacturing, which make jewelry in Manhattan and are planning to move to Queens.</p>
