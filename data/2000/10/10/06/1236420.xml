        <p>''Wyoming,'' a new play by Catherine Gillet, is a road story of sorts, except the map it follows consists of the twists and turns in the neurological back roads of the human mind.</p>
        <p>At the outset, the audience is introduced to three women -- one of grandmotherly years named Sheila (Marylouise Burke) and two possibly in their late 20's called Jasmine (Rosalyn Coleman) and Annie (Camilla Enders). One gathers from their conversation that they have just run away from a mental hospital. They decide to take off across country to some exotic destination. They settle on Wyoming. What follows could be a stage version of Thelma and Louise flying over the cuckoo's nest.</p>
        <p>But the women are scarcely off the Jersey Turnpike before Ms. Gillet's play begins to hit some potholes. For one thing, one begins to wonder what the trio will use for money on this cross-country odyssey, and where they got a car. Ms. Gillet inserts one-sentence explanations for these concerns, but they are not really plausible (Jasmine says she stole some money and Sheila says she sold a diamond to buy the car). But once they are on the road, further doubt sets in.</p>
        <p>With Sheila at the wheel in Lenore Doxsee's minimal set (four chairs facing the audience represent the car), Ms. Burke makes no pretense of driving. She holds her hands in her lap, crosses them across her chest and occasionally leaps from the car to wander around the stage to deliver a monologue or harangue her two passengers. Scenes with a gas station attendant, a Kansas farmer and a waiter at a Colorado diner (all acted by George R. Sheffey), are played straight. But it is soon clear that something else is going on in Ms. Gillet's play, or else her director, Eric Nightengale, has abandoned all hope of verisimilitude in the performances.</p>
        <p>One gradually realizes that Ms. Gillet is aiming for some sort of psychological thriller that only becomes fully apparent in the final scene, and even then a lot of questions are left unanswered. What emerges is more a dramatized case study of a multiple personality disorder than a play, but one never really gets to know the details of the subject's life to make it meaningful.  It's as though the playwright, in an effort to enhance the puzzle, purposely held back any information that might allow the audience get to know her and understand the purpose of the play.</p>
        <p>The attractions of the piece for an actor are clear, and what enjoyment there is comes in the performance of Ms. Burke as Sheila. The engaging actress, who won awards for her role last season in ''Fuddy Meers,'' pulls out several tricks to maintain the audience's attention in a character that is only loosely defined despite several monologues that describe her abusive husband and a lover or friend who may or may not be real.</p>
        <p>Ms. Burke has the most disarming  smile on any New York stage, and she beams it often in ''Wyoming,'' mixing it with exaggerated gestures that only she can make seem normal and abrupt pauses and switches in vocal volume to cover some of the more overblown passages in the text. Ms. Coleman, as the more rebellious of the two characters Sheila carries with her, and Ms. Enders, as the naive one, both are credible, although both act like perfectly normal young women in Mr. Nightengale's direction. Mr. Sheffey adds nice turns as the three men encountered on this odd journey.</p>
