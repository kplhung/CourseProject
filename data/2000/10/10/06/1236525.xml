        <p>Ball Park Brands in Southfield, Mich., a division of Sara Lee that sells the Ball Park line of meat products, has awarded its advertising and media planning accounts to two units of the B Com3  Group in Chicago. Billings were estimated at $20 million.</p>
        <p>Leo Burnett USA, part of Leo Burnett Worldwide, will handle advertising, and Starcom USA, part of the Starcom MediaVest Group, will handle media planning. Starcom has handled media buying for Ball Park and many other Sara Lee brands since November 1998. Advertising and media planning for Ball Park had been handled by Lowe Lintas &amp; Partners Worldwide in New York, part of the Lowe Group unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies, which resigned in June.</p>

        <p>The decision came after a review that involved Burnett, Starcom and other agencies that Ball Park declined to identify. This is the first creative general market assignment from Sara Lee for Burnett; a Burnett division, Lapiz, creates campaigns for Ball Park aimed at Spanish-speaking consumers.</p>
