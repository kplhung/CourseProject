        <p>If Armando Benitez had worked out of the ninth inning without incident, and the Mets had taken a tidy victory back with them to Shea Stadium -- well, they would not be the New York Mets.</p>
        <p>There has to be drama when the Mets meet October. So when J. T. Snow delayed the Mets two outs short of a victory tonight, with a three-run homer just inside the right-field foul pole, barely 310 feet from home plate, some of the Mets just sighed.</p>
        <p>John Franco turned to his fellow reliever, Turk Wendell. They looked at each other and Wendell said: ''Here we go again. Nothing comes easy.''</p>
        <p>At about that moment, Mets Manager Bobby Valentine went to the mound to reassure Benitez, telling him not to worry, to focus on getting two more outs. Benitez did, and the Mets had life.</p>
        <p>An old pro and the rookie who replaced him became the heroes in the 10th. The 13-year veteran Darryl Hamilton, who could not contribute much this year because of a toe injury, doubled with two outs off Felix Rodriguez. Jay Payton, who took Hamilton's starting spot during the four months Hamilton missed with the injury, singled him home to give the Mets a 5-4 lead.</p>
        <p>Franco came in with a runner on and no outs in the 10th, and he struck out Barry Bonds to end the game and preserve a 5-4 victory that evened the three-of-five-game division series at one victory apiece. The teams play Game 3 on Saturday at Shea Stadium.</p>
        <p>''This is probably the biggest moment of my career,'' said Franco, who is 40 and the oldest Met. ''It's the biggest save of my career.''</p>
        <p>The youngest Met is Timo Perez, and he also was crucial tonight. Perez had three hits, all with two outs, in his first postseason start. His two-run single in the second seemed to be enough for the veteran left-hander Al Leiter, who was brilliant into the ninth inning before the Giants' charge.</p>
        <p>Leiter gave up five hits and, from the third to the eighth innings allowed no runners into scoring position. But he gave up a leadoff double to Bonds in the ninth, and Valentine called for Benitez.</p>
        <p>Jeff Kent reached on an infield hit, and Ellis Burks flied to right. But on a 2-1 fastball, Snow, who was pinch-hitting, lifted a ball into the night. He pointed the ball fair and it responded, landing on the metal roof atop the right-field wall, only 309 feet from home plate.</p>
        <p>After Benitez set down Rich Aurilia and Bobby Estalella to get out of the inning, the first two Mets made outs in the 10th. That brought up Hamilton, a proud player who was deeply offended in Game 1, when Rodriguez danced off the mound after fanning him with the bases loaded. The moment before he faced Rodriguez tonight, he said, was the most intense he has ever been in his career.</p>
        <p>''Any time you wake guys up by doing something like that,'' Hamilton said, ''it always comes back to hurt you.''</p>
        <p>Hamilton stroked a liner to the gap off the hard-throwing Rodriguez. He chugged for second -- bad toe and all -- sliding in with a double. Hamilton knew he had to go for second.</p>
        <p>''I've got to take a chance in that situation,'' he said. ''Even if I get thrown out, it's a good chance to take.''</p>
        <p>Taking that risk put Hamilton in position to score one batter later, when Payton lashed a slider to right for a single. Payton's hit gave the Mets their lead, but the Giants threatened in the bottom of the 10th, when the pinch-hitter Armando Rios led off with a single, bringing Franco in the game. Marvin Benard sacrificed Rios to second, but Rios was running on a grounder to shortstop Mike Bordick, who threw to third to catch him.</p>
        <p>With Bill Mueller at first and Bonds batting, Franco shook off Mike Piazza, opting for his signature changeup instead of a fastball. He struck out Bonds on a called third strike.</p>
        <p>''I've been making a living for 17 years getting people out on my changeup,'' Franco said. ''What better time to throw it than that time?''</p>
        <p>Leiter struck out six and walked three, thriving in two-out situations. Although he did not win, Leiter's performance tonight is the latest in a series of October highlights for him. He pitched the Mets into the playoffs with a victory in a one-game playoff at Cincinnati last year, started Game 7 of the 1997 World Series for the victorious Florida Marlins, and won a game in relief for Toronto in the 1993 World Series, which the Blue Jays won.</p>
        <p>Perez, of all players, gave him the chance to win tonight, going 3 for 5. The 23-year-old right fielder was starting because of the ankle and Achilles injuries to Derek Bell, the veteran who is out for the series. All three of Perez's hits came with two outs, and two were pivotal.</p>
        <p>With the bases loaded in the second inning, he lined a single to center off Shawn Estes, bringing in two runs. Perez dropped a two-strike bunt single in the fourth but was stranded. With two outs in the ninth, he singled to left. Edgardo Alfonzo brought him in when he blasted a homer to left-center off Rodriguez.</p>
        <p>Leiter allowed no two-out hits. He walked pitcher Kirk Rueter with two outs in the fifth and faced Calvin Murray, a platoon player in the lineup specifically to face a left-hander.</p>
        <p>Leiter put his hands to his head after missing a 2-2 pitch low in the strike zone. But after a foul ball, he got Murray to chase a curveball for strike three. Leiter stalked off the mound, barking at himself.</p>
        <p>In the seventh, he reached the 100-pitch mark when Aurilia flied to center for the second out, with a man on first. Estalella came up next, still seeking his first career hit off Leiter. He worked the count full, then fouled off four pitches as Leiter kept coming in with his cut fastball. On the 10th pitch of the at-bat, Leiter finally won: Estalella popped out to third.</p>
        <p>''I was able to elevate my aggressiveness and concentration in those situations and execute the pitches and get out of it,'' Leiter said. ''That's the difference between a well-pitched game and one that's not.''</p>
        <p>Estes, a 15-game winner and a former All-Star, came out dominant for the Giants, striking out Perez on a called curveball for strike three and working a 1-2-3 first. But Estes sprained his left ankle on an awkward slide in the third, leaving the game for Rueter, who worked four and one-third scoreless innings, locking into a duel with Leiter.</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>Right fielder DEREK BELL (sprained ankle, strained Achilles') was unable to take batting practice Thursday and will have a magnetic resonance imaging test on Friday. After the game, Bell said he would be unable to play until the league championship series -- if the Mets get that far.</p>
