        <p>Richard Riley arrived at Kennedy International Airport two years ago a carefree college freshman, just back from a Christmas break visit with his mother in Jamaica. He left the airport 12 hours later shackled, accused of trying to enter the country with falsified documents.</p>
        <p>Mr. Riley, who was then and is now a legal resident of the United States, said immigration inspectors rejected his proof of residency, strip-searched him twice and kept him shackled to a bench in a busy airport office overnight.</p>
        <p>''They laughed and made fun of me, saying that Jamaicans only live here to mop floors,'' recalled Mr. Riley, now 21 and a senior at Syracuse University. ''It was a lot of mind games.''</p>
        <p>He was eventually freed from a detention center when the Immigration and Naturalization Service verified the validity of his documents. But others were not so lucky, according to a study made available yesterday by the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights.</p>
        <p>With sweeping personal discretion to deport illegal immigrants, I.N.S. inspectors have mistreated or turned away legal visitors as well as victims of torture who had credible claims for political asylum, the report concluded.</p>
        <p>''The bottom line is we don't think anybody ought to be sent back without access to a judge,'' said Elisa Massimino, director of the Washington office of the Lawyers Committee. ''It's not appropriate for an administrative person to be the final arbiter in this when the stakes are so high.''</p>
        <p>The power to order immediate deportations, or expedited removals, as they are called in legal terms, was granted to immigration inspectors in 1996. The power grew out of the widely held perception that waves of foreigners were entering the country illegally, and then disappearing, by taking advantage of lax border controls and generous treatment of asylum seekers.</p>
        <p>It amounted to a sharp increase in responsibility for the I.N.S. enforcement officers at airports and land borders, and to a major change for asylum seekers, who after making their escapes from their troubled homelands often arrive in the United States with false documents.</p>
        <p>Trained asylum officers or judges once determined whether applicants had credible fears of persecution or torture at home, but now immigrants must first make their case to front-line immigration inspectors. The inspectors decide who may stay to make a formal asylum claim.</p>
        <p>Those suspected of traveling on false documents, or without the proper documentation for entry to the United States, can now also be deported by an inspector without a hearing or an appeal.</p>
        <p>Critics of the expedited removal process have long complained that immigration service inspectors lack the training and resources, such as certified translators, to make such delicate, swift and final decisions.</p>
        <p>But immigration officials said they had loaded the process with safeguards like a requirement that inspectors always ask those facing deportation whether they fear returning home. ''We understand that when you've got an asylum seeker, the stakes can be immeasurably high and the cost of a mistake can be immense,'' said Bo Cooper, the general counsel for the immigration service. ''So we have tried to put in place every institutional safeguard that is practicable.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cooper said he could not comment on the specific incidents cited in the report because he had not read it through.</p>
        <p>The immigration service does not publish detailed data on the expedited removal process. What is known about the experience has generally come from immigrants and travelers who managed to remain in the country, or re-entered later, and then told their stories. In its report, the Lawyers Committee compiled the accounts of more than 100 such people -- a minuscule fraction of the 189,000 people summarily deported -- over the last three years.</p>
        <p>The accounts suggested that at least some immigration inspectors treated the people they detained callously, frequently used shackles and handcuffs to restrain them for hours, and provided no translators or sometimes hostile translators for those who did not understand what was happening to them.</p>
        <p>One incident involved a prominent Chinese dissident, Liu Nianchun, who was detained at Kennedy Airport in April 1999 as he returned with a visitor's visa after testifying at a United Nations human rights conference in Geneva.</p>
        <p>Immigration officers threatened to deport him to China, where he had once been imprisoned, because, they said, his visa was not valid. Mr. Liu, who does not speak English, spent the night chained to a bench. When he fell asleep, officers kicked him to wake him, according to his lawyer, Howard Sullivan.</p>
        <p>Mr. Liu was eventually released and won political asylum in the United States.</p>
        <p>In an incident last January, the report said, a political dissident who had been tortured and imprisoned in Guinea arrived at Kennedy to seek asylum. Lacking a visa and unable to fully explain his wishes in English, he spent 55 hours in the airport, chained to a bench.</p>
        <p>Immigration officials decided to summarily deport him, the report said. Weeping and struggling, he had to be carried toward a plane. Only after immigration officers dropped him, injuring his shoulder, was he returned to the airport and interviewed by a different inspector, who believed he had a credible fear of persecution.</p>
        <p>The man, still fearing for his family in Guinea, was not named in the report.</p>
        <p>Mark Thorn, a spokesman for the New York district of the immigration service, which oversees operations at Kennedy, said he could not discuss any specific case. But he denied that inspectors had abused travelers they were investigating or disregarded any immigrant's expressed fear of being deported.</p>
        <p>''They're incredibly civil and sensitive to these people's plight,'' Mr. Thorn said. ''Nobody wants to send somebody back where there would be fear of reprisal or even death.''</p>
        <p>As for the use of shackles, he said restraints protected the safety of immigration officers and those they detained. ''The expedited removal process,'' Mr. Thorn added, ''can be very stressful to the individual, and the individual may not know how he or she is going to react.''</p>
        <p>Reports of abuse, physical restraint and insensitivity have also emerged from other airports and border crossings. Last summer, Oregon officials accused the immigration service of mistreating many Asian business travelers at the Portland airport, including a Chinese businesswoman with a visa who was strip-searched and jailed because inspectors doubted the validity of her passport.</p>
        <p>According to the Lawyers Committee, immigration inspectors repeatedly provided Serb translators for ethnic Albanians fleeing Serb persecution in Kosovo. Women who said they had been raped in their home countries had to recount their ordeal to male translators, the report said.</p>
        <p>''The sheer volume of these accounts, and their consistency in describing certain types of conduct by I.N.S. officers, makes it clear that there are widespread miscarriages of justice in the current expedited removal process,'' Ms. Massimino said.</p>
