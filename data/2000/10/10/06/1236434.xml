        <p>The Microsoft Corporation shot back at the Justice Department today, saying that the government wanted to curtail the company's right of appeal of the antitrust ruling against it.</p>
        <p>Microsoft filed the reply in the United States Court of Appeals here this afternoon, five days ahead of its deadline. In it the company countered the government's assertion, made on Tuesday, that the case must be heard quickly because of its importance.</p>
        <p>''This is indeed an important case,'' Microsoft's brief said. ''But particularly in such an important case'' the most pressing need ''is in a proper disposition of the case, not in one reached in haste.''</p>
        <p>On Monday, the company asked the court to allow more than five months for filing documents. Microsoft also asked for the right to submit an appeal four times the length the court normally allows -- half the size of an average-length book.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, the government objected on both counts, calling for a filing period that ends Dec. 22 and a document length less than half of what Microsoft had requested.</p>
        <p>In today's filing, the last in this sequence, Microsoft said it ''has a responsibility to its employees, shareholders, business partners and customers, as well as to this court, to propose an appellate process that is adequate to resolve the many issues presented.</p>
        <p>''The proceedings Microsoft has proposed are the minimum necessary to achieve that objective,'' the company added.</p>
        <p>Now that both sides have made their cases, the appeals court will issue its schedule for filings and oral arguments in the coming days.</p>
