        <p>There is a relentless circle trod by enraged Palestinian men in the Gaza Strip. They file from concrete hovels each day to the Netzarim intersection. There they clash with Israeli soldiers. Those who are shot are taken to the hospital. Those who die return home by nightfall draped in national colors on a wooden bier.</p>
        <p>And in the morning, after the newest martyrs are buried in the large sandy cemetery at the edge of the city, the crowds of angry mourners take up the macabre flirtation with death once again.</p>
        <p>Ayman Deeb al-Loh, 22, a taxi driver, joined thousands who have  marched through the narrow, garbage-strewn streets behind the bodies each day since the violence erupted. He was not, his family said, a deeply religious man. Indeed, he supported the peace talks and hoped that the violence could be quelled through negotiations.</p>
        <p>But on Wednesday that changed. He was called to the hospital by his mother, Fatma, who told him that Israeli soldiers near the Netzarim junction had shot his older brother, Raid.</p>
        <p>''It was too much for him,'' said his brother-in-law, Yossef Turk, 30, who met him at the hospital. ''He could hardly speak. He saw his brother's wounds and turned and shook all our hands. He walked out to his taxi and left. It was, I think now, as if he was saying his final goodbye to us all.''</p>
        <p>The Netzarim junction, marked by concrete turrets and razor wire of an Israeli Army outpost, has been besieged daily by hundreds of Palestinians. The white apartment buildings next door, which housed Palestinian police officers, have been gashed open and scorched by fire after Israeli helicopter attacks. But on the rooftops, crowds of shirtless young men keep up the assault, hurling rocks and flaming bottles at the soldiers. The road has been ripped up by demonstrators who chip and smash the concrete into fist-size projectiles.</p>
        <p>Mr. Loh set out in his car to join the attack. He was, by all accounts, close to the front of the crowd when he was picked off. His body, too dangerously placed to retrieve in daylight, lay crumpled under a tree until darkness.</p>
        <p>On the morning of his burial, the street outside his boxy concrete home was covered with posters showing him squatting in front of the Dome of the Rock, one of Islam's holiest sites, holding an assault rifle. The picture, however, was created in a photo shop. He did not own a gun.</p>
        <p>To reach his home, crowds surged past the ambling donkey carts, the overflowing orange garbage bins and vehicles that belched clouds of exhaust. They let up a roar as his body, covered with a Palestinian flag, was carried out the metal door.</p>
        <p>Mr. Loh's face, exposed, was turned to one side and his mouth was open. His mother, sisters, fiancee and cousins pushed out behind the bier, crying and shouting, ''Death to the Jews!''</p>
        <p>Several bearded men in robes held them back.</p>
        <p>''No women to the cemetery,'' one man said. ''It is not allowed in Islam.''</p>
        <p>At that moment Mr. Loh's body became a prop. It was transported in a circuitous route through the city to the main mosque and carried inside.</p>
        <p>The mourners, their shoes piled up by the door, spread out in semicircular rows around the bier inside the vaulted mosque. They listened to Imam Abed al-Fatah recite verses from the Koran under the soft whir of the ceiling fans.</p>
        <p>''This bloody confrontation is God's will,'' said the cleric, dressed in a black robe with gold trim. ''It is time for all the Jews who do not belong here, who came from Europe and other countries, to go home.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Loh's grave outside the city was one of a fresh row, nearly all containing victims of the clashes. As he was lowered into the ground, his mother and sisters -- who appeared in a taxi despite the ban -- wailed. Several people fainted. Marchers with AK-47 assault rifles, many of whom wore headbands bearing Koranic verses, fired rounds into the air.</p>
        <p>''There is no peace without Jerusalem!'' they shouted. ''God is Great!'' And then came the battle cry: ''Netzarim.''</p>
        <p>Within an hour the intersection was teeming with men who braved exposed positions to assault the soldiers inside. Many had covered their faces with cloth and waved green Koranic flags.  Two ambulances, the back doors open, lay up the road waiting for the inevitable.</p>
        <p>Suddenly the crack of a sniper rifle felled a young man. His companions, carrying him by his arms and legs, lumbered up the road to the ambulance that had already begun to unleash its siren. They watched it speed off toward Gaza before reaching down to fill their hands with stones.</p>
