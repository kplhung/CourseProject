        <p>RICHARD W. STEVENSON  In Tuesday's debate, Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore threw at each other -- and viewers -- a barrage of claims and counterclaims, facts and figures and jargon. Many of the same issues came up in last night's vice-presidential debate. Here are explanations of some of the assertions.</p>
        <p>RICHARD W. STEVENSON</p>
        <p>Gov. George W. Bush</p>
        <p>''I want to take one-half of the surplus and dedicate it to Social Security, one-quarter of the surplus for important projects. And I want to send one-quarter of the surplus back to the people who pay the bills.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's figures understate the proportion of the surplus that his tax cut would use and overstate the proportion that his spending would use.</p>
        <p>The total budget surplus over the next 10 years is projected by the Congressional Budget Office to be $4.56 trillion. Mr. Bush, like Mr. Gore and the two parties in Congress, has agreed that the portion of the surplus generated by Social Security -- $2.38 trillion, or 52 percent of the total -- should go only to reducing the national debt or shoring up the retirement system.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's proposed tax cut amounts to $1.32 trillion, or 29 percent of the surplus. It is also fair to say that Mr. Bush's tax cut uses up $1.6 trillion of the surplus. That is because the surplus is calculated on the assumption that all of it will go to reducing the national debt, lowering the government's interest costs. If $1.32 trillion of the surplus goes to a tax cut, the interest bill will rise by around $300 billion. If the tax cut is valued at $1.6 trillion, that would be 35 percent of the surplus.</p>
        <p>In saying he would devote one quarter of the surplus to ''important projects,'' Mr. Bush was referring to his plans for additional spending on health, education, agriculture, the military and other needs. He values his spending package at $475 billion over 10 years, which would be 10 percent of the surplus. If interest costs of $100 billion are added to the spending proposal, it would be 13 percent of the surplus.</p>
        <p>''After my plan is in place, the wealthiest Americans will pay a higher percentage of taxes than they do today, and the poorest of Americans -- six million families, seven million people -- won't pay any tax at all.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's assertion was based on an analysis by his economic team that shows that people at lower income levels would get a bigger income tax cut in percentage terms, though not in dollar terms, than people at higher income levels.</p>
        <p>People earning $200,000 or more would pay 40.9 percent of all income taxes under the Bush plan, compared to 39.1 percent under current law. People earning between $20,000 and $30,000 would pay 1.9 percent of all income taxes under the Bush plan, compared with 2.2 percent under current law. The analysis excludes the proposed estate tax repeal.</p>
        <p>By reducing tax rates and doubling the child credit to $1,000, six million low- to middle-income families would see their federal income tax liability wiped out completely, according to the Bush campaign. But they would continue to be subject to the payroll taxes that finance Social Security and Medicare.</p>
        <p>Vice President Al Gore</p>
        <p>''Under Governor Bush's tax cut proposal, he would spend more money on tax cuts for the wealthiest 1 percent than all of the new spending that he proposes for education, health care, prescription drugs and national defense all combined.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's assertion is based on an analysis by a liberal-leaning tax research group, Citizens for Tax Justice. Its findings are similar to other studies in concluding that the wealthiest taxpayers -- those who pay the most taxes -- would get a far bigger tax cut in dollar terms from Mr. Bush than would low- and middle-income taxpayers.</p>
        <p>But the validity of the comparison to Mr. Bush's spending plans hinges on how the analysis deals with one element of Mr. Bush's plan, the repeal of the federal estate tax.</p>
        <p>Citizens for Tax Justice found that 42.6 percent of the benefits of the Bush tax cut, including the estate tax repeal, would go to the wealthiest 1 percent of taxpayers by income -- those making $319,000 or more. If that percentage were applied to the $1.3 trillion price tag that Mr. Bush puts on his tax plan, it implies that $554 billion would go to the wealthiest 1 percent. Mr. Bush's budget proposal calls for $475 billion in additional spending over the next 10 years on the areas cited by Mr. Gore, and others.</p>
        <p>The estate tax applies to estates valued at $675,000 or more, and Citizens for Tax Justice assumed that its repeal would benefit people in the top 1 percent of income almost exclusively. But there is a debate among tax analysts about that assumption, since the tax is sometimes paid by the estates of farmers and small business owners who have modest cash incomes and since the tax is in a sense paid by heirs, whose income levels are unknown.</p>
        <p>If the estate tax is taken out of the calculation, 30 percent of Mr. Bush's tax cut would go to the wealthiest 1 percent, according to Citizens for Tax Justice. Without the estate tax repeal, Mr. Bush values his tax cut at $1.06 trillion, and 30 percent of that would be $318 billion, or $157 billion less than Mr. Bush's spending plan.</p>
        <p>''I think we need to put Social Security and Medicare in a lockbox. The governor will not put Medicare in a lockbox.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore was referring to proposals to wall off excess revenues being generated by Social Security and Medicare so that they could not be used to pay for tax cuts or new spending programs.</p>
        <p>There is no disagreement when it comes to Social Security. Mr. Gore has proposed that the Medicare surplus -- $360 billion over the next 10 years -- be dedicated solely to debt reduction. The idea has considerable bipartisan support in Congress. But Mr. Bush's proposed budget relies on the Medicare surplus to pay for his tax cuts and spending plans. Using the Bush campaign's figures, Mr. Bush's budget would go $95 billion into the red over 10 years if the Medicare surplus were put off limits.</p>
