        <p>Two children were killed and four other people were injured yesterday morning when a fire tore through a two-story duplex in Brooklyn, fire officials and witnesses said.</p>
        <p>The fire broke out about 1:30 a.m. at 637 Linden Boulevard in Flatbush, said Firefighter Jerard Allas, a Fire Department spokesman. More than 120 firefighters fought the blaze, which was brought under control by 2:30 a.m. But that hour proved fatal for Dwayne Brown, 10, and his sister, Nassiah Woods, 7. Both died in their beds on the second floor, amid smoke and flames. The cause of the fire is under investigation.</p>
        <p>''They were happy children,'' said Audrey Gulston, a great-aunt. ''No worries, no problems.''</p>
        <p>The fire broke out in the basement of the duplex yesterday morning, said Oneal Haynes, the children's great-uncle, who lives on the first floor. The flames spread quickly. Smoke began pouring through the building, where 10 or so members of an extended family lived.</p>
        <p>Mr. Haynes said he did not know what was happening until his brother, Eaden Scantlebury, woke him. Mr. Haynes said he opened the basement door, only to come face to face with thick smoke. He then tried to rush up the stairs to the second floor, he said, where the children and several other relatives were sleeping.</p>
        <p>''By the time I got halfway up there, there was a big cloud of smoke,'' Mr. Haynes said. ''I only got so far before I had to turn back.''</p>
        <p>He raced outside the building and flagged down a patrol car. The police officers tried to climb the stairs but could not make it to the bedrooms, Mr. Haynes said. Then two young women, both family members, stumbled down, coughing. But the children remained upstairs.</p>
        <p>Minutes later, the first firefighters arrived.</p>
        <p>''I told them there might be two kids upstairs,'' Mr. Haynes said.</p>
        <p>Several firefighters went in as smoke continued to billow from the building. Colleagues brought out hoses. Then one of the firefighters marched down from the second floor cradling something in his arms. Mr. Haynes looked closer.</p>
        <p>''They came out with my nephew Dwayne first,'' Mr. Haynes said, tears welling in his eyes. ''Then a little while later they came out with -- they came out with Nassiah.''</p>
        <p>Efforts to revive the children failed, and they were taken to Kings County Hospital Center, where they were pronounced dead upon arrival.</p>
        <p>''I've known them since they were born,'' Mr. Haynes said. ''Everybody in this house is family. We're all family.''</p>
        <p>Four family members were taken to other nearby hospitals, where they were treated for smoke inhalation.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, the children's rooms reeked of smoke, and the walls were stained black. In Nassiah's room, which she shared with a 12-year-old relative who survived the fire, Barbie dolls lay scattered across the floor. The loft bed in which Nassiah died had a sheet with pink polka dots stretched over the mattress.</p>
        <p>The two children attended Public School 135, two blocks up the street. They liked to play outdoors, tearing out the bottom of a milk carton and tying it to the fence in the front yard to play a form of basketball, Mr. Haynes said.</p>
        <p>He would watch as they raced out onto Linden Boulevard on their bicycles or skates. But at those moments, the adults in the family warned Dwayne and Nassiah not to play in the street that so often teemed with cars. The children had to stay safe. They had years and years ahead of them.</p>
