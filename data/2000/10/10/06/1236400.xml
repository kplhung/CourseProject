        <p>At the start, 37 years ago, ''The Fugitive'' must have seemed like a ludicrous idea for a series: send a man on the lam even though viewers know he can't possibly be caught or the show would be over. Where's the suspense in that? But the old ''Fugitive'' ran for four years and its finale drew the largest audience for a series ever, until someone shot J. R. on ''Dallas.''</p>
        <p>After Harrison Ford's star turn in the 1993 film, a second television ''Fugitive'' sounds like a bad idea all over again. The movie offered such a satisfying sense of completion, with the wrongly accused Richard Kimble exonerated of his wife's murder.</p>

        <p>At the start, 37 years ago, ''The Fugitive'' must have seemed like a ludicrous idea for a series: send a man on the lam even though viewers know he can't possibly be caught or the show would be over. Where's the suspense in that? But the old ''Fugitive'' ran for four years and its finale drew the largest audience for a series ever, until someone shot J. R. on ''Dallas.''</p>
        <p>After Harrison Ford's star turn in the 1993 film, a second television ''Fugitive'' sounds like a bad idea all over again. The movie offered such a satisfying sense of completion, with the wrongly accused Richard Kimble exonerated of his wife's murder.</p>
        <p>But the old ''Fugitive'' worked because its creators knew that the chase was the thing, and CBS's is using that classic principle to try to jump-start a new wave of crime dramas with three promising, lively series beginning this weekend. Focused sharply on the cat-and-mouse essence of the genre, ''The Fugitive,'' ''C.S.I.'' and ''The District'' are sturdy and retro, despite their up-to-the-minute trappings and their reach for movie-quality action.</p>
        <p>Like all good crime stories, these are mini-morality tales about the face-off between good and evil. But the differences between their time-worn prototypes and their contemporary window dressing reveals a great deal about how television and its audience have changed.</p>
        <p>These shows won't lure anybody away from MTV, despite much hype about CBS gaining younger viewers in the wake of ''Survivor.'' Their appeal is to a group drawn to the shows' comfy nostalgic feel.</p>
        <p>'The Fugitive''</p>
        <p>''Falsely accused of murdering his wife,'' the sonorous narrator always began the old ''Fugitive,'' reminding viewers that Dr. Richard Kimble traveled the country pursuing the one-armed man who was the real killer, and was himself pursued relentlessly by Detective Gerard. In the nightmarish landscape of this story, the justice system itself has failed. The lean plot is as enduring as that of ''Les Miserables,'' with Detective Gerard playing Javert to Kimble's Jean Valjean.</p>
        <p>The story is the same in this go-round, but the tone is as different as today's colorful ''Fugitive'' is from those moody black-and-white episodes from the 60's. The new series is so intent on making the chase vivid that it is being filmed, expensively, not in studios but on location around the country.</p>
        <p>While ''The Fugitive'' is the most high-profile of the CBS crime series,  it is also the most lackluster, mostly because Tim Daly is a lightweight Kimble. Best known from the gentle sitcom ''Wings,'' he brings likability to the role. But both David Janssen in the original and Mr. Ford in the movie were brooding types, with the intensity a man on the run should have. Mr. Daly's sensitive guy is more contemporary than Janssens's, and more calculated to suit an extended television run than Mr. Ford's angry movie hero. That makes him a lot less compelling.</p>
        <p>Tonight's episode begins in Chicago, and quickly takes us through the series' premise. When Kimble arrives home just in time to find his wife dying, he is unable to save her or to catch the one-armed man. (Here he is actually the man with a prosthetic arm.) Quickly convicted of the murder, Kimble escapes, and the series settles into a familiar pattern.</p>
        <p>Kimble chases the killer to Miami, where he gets a job in construction and is drawn to a woman he will never really get to know because he is -- wouldn't you know -- the Fugitive!</p>
        <p>The sunnier look of this series, and its high-tech approach to Kimble's survival, complete with computer searches and cell phones, is no replacement for the noirish atmosphere that infused the old show. (The original ''Fugitive'' has been playing on TV Land this week, where the record-breaking two-part finale will be shown tonight at 9.)</p>
        <p>Mikelti Williamson plays Gerard, whose obsessive pursuit makes him a potentially intriguing character. Mr. Williamson has already given  him a vitality beyond anything the writers have suggested. Next week Kimble has a close encounter with the prosthetic-armed man in Savannah. In time this ''Fugitive'' may find a tone good enough to justify its extravagant budgets. So far Kimble's third go-round is a mild imitation of the others.</p>
        <p>''C.S.I.''</p>
        <p>''C.S.I.'' which stands for crime scene investigation, follows a band of police forensics specialists as they track down evidence using old-fashioned common sense and new-fangled science. ''Here comes the nerd squad,'' a detective at a crime scene says as the C.S.I. people arrive, but they are more glamorous than that. Jerry Bruckheimer (producer of high-octane movies like ''Armageddon'') is a producer of ''C.S.I.,'' whose gimmick is that this crew works the night shift in Las Vegas, with lots of vice and glittering backdrops.</p>
        <p>They are led by the always terrific William Petersen (''Manhunter'') who adds greatly to the show's allure. He plays Gil Grissom, a man who so enjoys his work that when he pulls a squirming maggot from the body of a dead man he says, ''This guy's been dead seven days,'' delighted at his discovery. The details do have a rough edge, but the series also has a wry tone. This may be the first time in television history someone looking for evidence announces, ''I have a warrant for your toenails.''</p>
        <p>This slick series would work better if it were less busy. Now there are a half-dozen investigators and at least as many cases in play. Among the too many things going on, there is a case about a killing that is either self-defense or calculated murder (an oddly tied shoelace is a giveaway), a possible suicide (voice analysis of a tape will tell) and a married man whose encounter with a prostitute literally leaves him breathless (there's a chemical analysis for that).</p>
        <p>Marg Helgenberger plays an investigator and single mother who explains to the team's hesitant newcomer why she loves her job. ''We're just a bunch of kids being paid to work on puzzles,'' she says, getting to the playful essence of the genre. The  investigators restore ''peace of mind to victims,'' she says, with a touchy-feely contemporary twist. As a bonus they get a rush that makes them feel ''like King Kong on cocaine.'' The lines are too blunt, but with its mix of crime-solving and wit, this series  could be the unexpected winner among the new crime shows.</p>
        <p>''The District''</p>
        <p>In ''The District,'' Jack Mannion (Craig T. Nelson) arrives in a crime-riddled town determined to clean up the place. Never mind that he is in today's racially volatile Washington; Mannion is really Marshal Dillon keeping order in Dodge City. There's a perfect symmetry in the fact that ''Gunsmoke'' began on CBS on Saturdays at 10, just like ''The District.''</p>
        <p>But the white man who has come to save the day creates a troubling subtext in ''The District.'' The pilot, with Giancarlo Esposito as a flamboyant, possibly coke-addicted black mayor being investigated by Congress, created a flap, and changes were made. In the new opening episode, Mannion still has to tangle with an ineffective, unhappy black deputy police chief named Noland (Roger Aaron Brown) who tries to thwart him. But the mayor (now played by John Amos) is a more reputable  black mayor. He still may or may not be corrupt, but at least he acknowledges the racial tensions around him. It will be difficult ''bringing in some white hotshot over the head of Noland,'' he tells his deputy mayor (Jayne Brooks of ''Chicago Hope.'')</p>
        <p>''The District'' grafts the good guys versus bad guys simplicity of the Old West with Manion's eccentric character. He has a tendency to burst into song and compare everything to movies. ''Did you see 'All the President's Men'?'' he asks Nancy (Elizabeth Marvel), an officer he asks to compile reams of crime figures. ''You are Dustin Hoffman.''  Somehow Mr. Nelson gets away with this hokeyness. In the opening episode, Mannion's squad also shoots a buffalo in a zoo and tracks down a rapist-murderer.</p>
        <p>But amid the action, the traces of racial condescension are still there,  most conspicuous where the series fails to see them at all. Lynne Thigpen plays a statistics clerk who becomes one of Mannion's closest advisers. But in the opening episode he literally raises her from the darkness where he finds her hidden away and unappreciated in a basement office. When he gets involved with her shattered, lonely little family, it smacks of noblesse oblige.</p>
        <p>The series is savvy enough to give Mannion a young public relations adviser (Justin Theroux). But there is no political subtlety in the series, created by the Irish filmmaker Terry George, who has specialized in writing and directing films about his country's troubles (''Some Mother's Son'').</p>
        <p>Washington, after all, is not Ireland or the Old West. ''The District'' will either have to ignore race and lapse into television fantasyland or embrace its realism and become more sophisticated. (A tiresome political correctness would be worst of all. ) Either way, it's halfway there.</p>
