        <p>Howard Greenberg Gallery  120 Wooster Street, SoHo  Through Oct. 14</p>
        <p>Like Charles Jones -- the British amateur photographer whose stunningly modernist, turn-of-the-last-century images of vegetables, fruits and flowers were discovered at a London antiques market by a photography collector -- Dr. Dain L. Tasker (1872-1964) has emerged from obscurity to join the pantheon of photography masters. His oeuvre has some of the medium's most sublimely minimalist images of flowers.</p>
        <p>All softness and no bone, flowers would seem to be unlikely candidates for X-rays. But in the 1930's, about three decades after the discovery of this penetrating form of radiation, Tasker used fine-focus X-ray tubes to produce his floral studies on X-ray film. Tasker, the chief radiologist at Wilshire Hospital in Los Angeles, was an amateur photographer with an eye for simplicity.</p>
        <p>Unlike Imogen Cunningham, who gave calla lilies and magnolias a full-blown majesty, Tasker reduced flowers like the lily, the open lotus and the iris to their bare essentials. His black-and-white prints, made from X-ray negatives, could be nature's sketchbook for flowers.</p>
        <p>''Flowers are the expression of the love life of plants,'' Tasker once wrote, and the eroticism is often veiled, sometimes overt. A calla lily is a swirl of diaphanous folds enclosing an erect stamen; a shadowy philodendron is boldly phallic. In his exploration of flowers as fragile mysteries, Tasker used petals, stamens, leaves and stalks almost as musical notes to compose his quirkily beautiful adagios.</p>
        <p>Little is known about him. He was initially guided by the California photographer Will Connell, and his work was published in U.S. Camera (October 1939) and in Popular Photography (March 1942). The California photography collector who took the work to the Howard Greenberg Gallery bought a trove of vintage Tasker prints from a dealer who declined to say how he had obtained them.</p>
        <p>A measure of the importance of this discovery is that the 20 vintage prints shown here and reproduced in the catalog are more than a match for the works of established masters in botanical photography that make up the second half of this show. Titled ''A Brief History of Botanical Photography,'' it includes Karl Blossfeldt, Edward Steichen, Harry Callahan (whose 1948 four-image ''Cat Tails Against the Sky'' comes closest to Tasker's minimalism), Andre Kertesz and Josef Sudek.</p>
