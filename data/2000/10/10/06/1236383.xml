        <p>A selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy movies and film series playing this weekend in New York City. * denotes a highly recommended film or series. Ratings and running times are in parentheses. An index of reviews of films opening today appears on Page TK.</p>
        <p>Now Playing</p>
        <p>* ''ALMOST FAMOUS,'' starring Patrick Fugit, Billy Crudup, Kate Hudson and Philip Seymour Hoffman. Written and directed by Cameron Crowe (R, 120 minutes). Mr. Crowe's loose, affectionate look back on his earlier career as a teenage rock journalist overflows with wonderful performances and memorable moments. Mr. Fugit brings the perfect balance of intelligence and innocence to the role of William Miller, a San Diego teenager who takes to the road with a scruffy band called Stillwater, on assignment for Rolling Stone. ''Almost Famous'' isn't perfect -- it lacks a necessary dimension of demonic sleaze -- but Mr. Crowe's smart, compassionate writing and performances by Mr. Crudup, Ms. Hudson, Jason Lee and Frances McDormand (among many others) make it hum (A. O. Scott).</p>
        <p>* ''BEST IN SHOW,'' starring Jennifer Coolidge, Christopher Guest, John Michael Higgins, Michael Hitchcock, Eugene Levy, Jane Lynch, Michael McKean, Catherine O'Hara and Parker Posey. Directed by Mr. Guest (PG-13, 89 minutes). In the mold of Mr. Guest's earlier cult favorites ''This Is Spinal Tap,'' and ''Waiting for Guffman,'' this semi-deadpan satire spoofs the world of dog shows. A cross section of American eccentrics gather with their prized pets at a Philadelphia competition. The humor in this largely improvised film is barbed and condescending but rarely vicious. Like most skit comedy, the whole is somewhat less than the sum of its parts. Great fun, nonetheless (Stephen Holden).</p>
        <p>''BRING IT ON,'' starring Kirsten Dunst, Jesse Bradford and Eliza Dushku. Directed by Peyton Reed (PG-13, 110 minutes). Even though it does feature young women bouncing around in skimpy outfits, this cheerleader comedy, directed with giddy, sometimes sloppy pep-rally intensity by Mr. Reed from a brisk, slangy script by Jessica Bendinger, is more than a low-minded appeal to male lechery. Though bound by the conventions of the sports movie and the teenage romantic comedy, ''Bring It On'' has a fine satirical edge and at least glances at some serious issues of race and sexuality. It's also a vehicle for the vibrant comic talents of Ms. Dunst, ably supported by Mr. Bradford as her cute, nonconformist love interest, and Ms. Dushku as his sister (Scott).</p>
        <p>''DANCER IN THE DARK,'' starring Bjork and Catherine Deneuve. Directed by Lars von Trier (R, 134 minutes). Mr. von Trier's new musical, shot in raw, jumpy digital video, is a fascinating exercise in brutality, mitigated by the otherworldy charisma (and the music) of the Icelandic pop star Bjork. As Selma, a Czech immigrant factory worker going blind in the early 1960's in Washington State (the film was shot in Sweden), Bjork seems to be inventing a whole new style of film acting, and her performance is miraculous. Mr. von Trier, continuing his campaign to rescue the art of film from complacency and convention, follows Selma's utter annihilation with sadistic relish. ''Dancer in the Dark'' is both stupefyingly bad and utterly overpowering; it can elicit, sometimes within a single scene, a gasp of rapture and a spasm of revulsion. Go to the theater prepared, with a handkerchief in one hand and a rotten tomato in the other (Scott).</p>
        <p>''DUETS'' starring Huey Lewis, Gwyneth Paltrow, Maria Bello, Andre Braugher, Scott Speedman and Paul Giamatti. Directed by Bruce Paltrow (R, 113 minutes). Mr. Paltrow's musical follows the adventures of six lost souls looking for salvation in the demimonde of competitive karaoke. The movie is a mess, lurching from dark satire to soapy melodrama and punctuated with squirmingly earnest renditions of songs like ''Bette Davis Eyes'' and ''Hit Me With Your Best Shot.'' But ''Duets'' has its moments of brilliance, and a certain reckless integrity. The ensemble cast features Mr. Lewis and Ms. Paltrow, the director's daughter, but they're overshadowed by Mr. Giamatti's over-the-top performance as an alienated businessman. This is a very bad movie, but from time to time you catch glimpses of a very good movie trapped inside, struggling to get out (Scott).</p>
        <p>* ''GIRLFIGHT,'' starring Michelle Rodriguez, Jaime Tirelli and Paul Caldron. Directed by Karen Kusama (R, 90 minutes). Ms. Kusama's debut feature is a fierce, sweet, somewhat predictable boxing picture, with a novel twist that makes all the difference: the contender is a young woman. What makes the movie something more than a smart, feminist sports movie (which is already something) is the presence of Ms. Rodriguez in the leading role, an angry Brooklyn teenager named Diana Guzman who finds dignity and discipline in the ring. Ms. Rodriguez is like a female Marlon Brando, with an overpowering, slow-burning charisma that few actresses of any era can match. Her performance is a knockout (Scott).</p>
        <p>''GOYA IN BORDEAUX,'' starring Francisco Rabal, Jose Coronado, Dafne Fernandez and Maribel Verdu. Written and directed by Carlos Saura (R, 94 minutes). There's nothing subtle about Mr. Saura's splashy, sensuous biographical montage of the great Spanish artist Francisco Goya, whom the movie portrays as an 18th-century raging bull. Crammed with surreal imagery that quotes from his paintings, the movie is a series of deathbed flashbacks, many of them recollections of his passion for the fiery Duchess of Alba. Gorgeously lighted and photographed by Vittorio Storaro (Holden).</p>
        <p>* ''NURSE BETTY,'' starring Morgan Freeman, Renee Zellweger, Chris Rock and Greg Kinnear. Directed by Neil LaBute (R, 112 minutes). Hilarious, poignant and gory, this modern fairy tale, which follows an aspiring nurse (Ms. Zellweger) with traumatic amnesia to Los Angeles to win the love of her favorite soap-opera character, is a contemporary ''Wizard of Oz.'' Hollywood is the Emerald City. Mr. Kinnear is the self-centered actor who plays her heart's desire on television. Mr. Freeman and Mr. Rock are a sadly introspective hit man and his hotheaded protege who follow her across the country with the intention to do harm. This may be the deepest and funniest American comedy since David O. Russell's ''Flirting With Disaster'' (Holden).</p>
        <p>''REMEMBER THE TITANS,'' starring Denzel Washington, Will Patton, Donald Faison and Ryan Hurst. Directed by Boaz Yakin (PG, 113 minutes). Like the action blockbusters its producer, Jerry Bruckheimer, is best known for, this story of a Virginia high school football team's painful, ultimately triumphant struggle to integrate is a relentless, pounding succession of big moments. Mr. Washington and Mr. Patton play two coaches who must overcome their own differences to build a winning team, and their passage from hostility to respect to friendship is mirrored by the young men who play for them. The film, which takes place in 1971 and is based on a true story, is at times thumpingly corny, but it also offers some genuine, solid inspiration (Scott).</p>
        <p>* ''SOLAS,'' starring Maria Galiana and Ana Fernandez. Written and directed by Benito Zambrano (not rated, 98 minutes). When a simple Spanish woman (Ms. Galiana) makes a rare journey to the city to be with her husband, who is having surgery, she stays with her embittered, alcoholic daughter (Ms. Fernandez), who works for a cleaning service. Ms. Galiana's eloquent, utterly unsentimental portrayal of a woman who expects little of life is an extraordinarily moving portrait of unconditional love gradually working its wonders (Holden).</p>
        <p>* ''SPACE COWBOYS,'' starring Clint Eastwood, Tommy Lee Jones, Donald Sutherland and James Garner. Directed by Mr. Eastwood (PG-13, 105 minutes). The second half of Mr. Eastwood's new movie is a pleasant reworking of the standard trouble-in-space movie, with Mr. Eastwood leading a heroic team of astronauts that also include Mr. Jones, Mr. Sutherland and Mr. Garner. But the first half, which consists of the comic tough-old-guy interplay among these four sublime actors, is a boisterous, easygoing tribute to manhood and maturity. Mr. Sutherland and Mr. Jones are in especially fine form, as are Marcia Gay Harden, playing a NASA engineer, and James Cromwell as (once again) the villainous bureaucrat who tries to deny the old-timers their shot at celestial glory (Scott).</p>
        <p>''WOMAN ON TOP,'' starring Penelope Cruz, Murilo Benicio and Harold Perrineau Jr. Directed by Fina Torres (R, 85 minutes). It makes sense that the delectable Ms. Cruz would play a chef. This romantic comedy uses an amusing conceit, that she needs a magic spell to so enchant men that they wouldn't bother to look down at their plates -- a case in which magic is as redundant as giving the lethal boxer Roy Jones Jr. a third fist. Ms. Cruz flees Brazil and her philandering husband to go to San Francisco. There, she becomes the host of a cooking show, where she delights the local male population and sambas waft in the background. Negligible but diverting (Mitchell).</p>
        <p>Film Series  ''LON CHANEY: MAN OF A THOUSAND FACES,'' His was the face that launched a thousand chills. He was the hunchback of Notre Dame and the phantom of the opera. And for theater owners in 1928 and 1929, he was the top male box office attraction, a better draw than even Charlie Chaplin or John Gilbert or Douglas Fairbanks. He was Lon Chaney (1883-1930), the versatile character actor who became a star. Beginning tomorrow at the American Museum of the Moving Image, Chaney will be the subject of a monthlong 17-film retrospective that includes the New York premiere of the film historian Kevin Brownlow's documentary ''Lon Chaney: A Thousand Faces'' Five of the 16 Chaney films were directed by his frequent collaborator, Tod Browning. Among the highlights are the first New York showing of a newly restored print of ''The Phantom of the Opera'' (1925), with color segments; a special screening of ''The Unknown'' (1927), with a young Joan Crawford and accompanied by a live performance of an original musical score by Phillip Johnston; a restored print of ''The Wicked Darling'' (1919), a crime melodrama that was the first Chaney vehicle directed by Browning; and the 1930 version of ''The Unholy Three,'' Chaney's only talkie and his final film. The series begins at 2 p.m. tomorrow with ''The Sun's Rays'' (1914), a two-reel western that is the earliest surviving Chaney film, and ''The Wicked Darling.'' Through Oct. 29. Admission: $8.50; $5.50 for those over 65 and students; $4.50 for children 5 to 18; free to children under 5. Information: (718) 784-0077 (Lawrence Van Gelder).</p>
