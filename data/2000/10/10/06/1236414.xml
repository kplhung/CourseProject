        <p>The European Court of Justice, Europe's highest court, today overturned a ban that would have phased out tobacco advertising across Europe.</p>
        <p>In a final decision, the court sided with the German government and four British tobacco companies, which had argued that the European Union was overstepping its jurisdiction in enacting the ban. Tobacco legislation, they argued, is a health matter, and as such should be decided by individual countries, not by the European Union, which oversees market competition among its 15 member nations. They also argued that the ban violated their freedom of speech.</p>
        <p>''Governments and the commission are not above the law,'' said John Carlisle, public affairs director for the Tobacco Manufacturers Association. ''We feel justified in our actions and hope they will result in a better and fairer mix of legislation in the future.'' British American Tobacco P.L.C., the Gallaher Group, the Imperial Tobacco Group and Rothmans Ltd. had appealed the ban.</p>
        <p>A British high court judge had approved a request by the tobacco companies to take their appeal to the European Union court. The ruling today was based on a recommendation in June from the court's advocate general, Nial Fennelly, who said the European Union did not have the legal standing to enact such a ban.</p>
        <p>But the victory is likely to be short-lived for the tobacco industry, which could be facing new restrictions. The European Parliament is considering a directive that would cut the tar content of cigarettes and require larger health warnings on packs.  And even though the current advertising ban -- which was ratified by the European Parliament in 1998 and proposed phasing out newspaper, magazine and billboard tobacco advertising across Europe by 2006 -- has been overturned, individual governments are likely to take up the issue.</p>
        <p>Britain's public health minister, Yvette Cooper, said today that the government intends to push ahead with a ban on tobacco advertising, despite the European court's ruling.</p>
        <p>''This ruling is a disappointment, but it will not deflect us from implementing our manifesto commitment to ban tobacco advertising,'' the minister said. ''We hope that the European Commission will bring forward new proposals in this area as soon as it possibly can.''</p>
        <p>In response, Mr. Carlisle of the Tobacco Manufacturers Association said, ''We would urgently ask the minister to talk to us before framing any legislation so we can help them make sure that what they're proposing is workable.''</p>
        <p>More than half a million Europeans die each year from tobacco- related illnesses, according to Action on Smoking and Health, a British-based anti-smoking lobby group.</p>
        <p>''I am disappointed,'' Clive Bates, the group's director, said of the court's decision today. ''In Britain, we'll be O.K. But we do want to do something that benefits all citizens of the E.U.''</p>
