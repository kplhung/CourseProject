        <p>Speaking in a low, controlled voice, Diana D. Brooks, the former president and chief executive of Sotheby's auction house, pleaded guilty in a federal courtroom in Manhattan yesterday to fixing commission fees with the company's archrival, Christie's, and pointed the finger at A. Alfred Taubman, Sotheby's former chairman, whose orders she said she was following.</p>
        <p>Within an hour, Mr. Taubman, the Detroit shopping center magnate who bought a controlling interest in Sotheby's in 1983, fired back with a sharp denial issued through a spokesman. ''Whatever Ms. Brooks chose to do, she did completely on her own without my knowledge or approval,'' Mr. Taubman, 75, said. ''If the need arises, I will vigorously defend myself against any charges.'' He and Ms. Brooks resigned under pressure in February as the case against them built.</p>
        <p>Ms. Brooks's statement was the dramatic high point of a day in which the $4-billion-a-year auction industry was exposed in court as a cozy duopoly that for most of a decade colluded to fix hundreds of millions of dollars in fees to the detriment of customers unable to negotiate commission prices.</p>
        <p>By pleading guilty to a single felony count after a three-year Justice Department investigation, Ms. Brooks, 50, faces up to three years in prison and a fine that could potentially soar into the hundreds of millions of dollars when she is sentenced Jan. 5. In return for her plea, the government promised to file a motion seeking a lesser sentence than that provided under sentencing guidelines. But the decision on whether to file the motion remains the government's, depending on Ms. Brooks's level of cooperation.</p>
        <p>In court papers filed yesterday, the government named Mr. Taubman as its only remaining target at Sotheby's in its continuing criminal investigation, which Ms. Brooks has now agreed to assist in an effort to reduce her sentence.</p>
        <p>In a separate but related case, Sotheby's also pleaded guilty in federal court yesterday to price-fixing and other antitrust violations and agreed to a $45 million fine payable over five years. But the judge assigned that case -- by happenstance, Judge Lewis A. Kaplan, who is presiding over a class-action civil lawsuit against Sotheby's and Christie's stemming from the criminal investigation -- deferred his approval of the plea until he reviewed additional information.</p>
        <p>Judge Kaplan said he wanted to see how far a $512 million civil settlement in the class-action case, which was agreed to last month by Sotheby's and Christie's, would go in providing restitution to victims of the antitrust schemes and whether the $45 million fine in the plea was a fair figure. Judge Kaplan set Dec. 4 for a hearing on Sotheby's financial capacity and the losses to victims.</p>
        <p>The guilty plea by Sotheby's was offered by Donaldson C. Pillsbury, its senior vice president and general counsel, accompanied by Steven A. Riess of Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges.</p>
        <p>The pleas by the company and by Ms. Brooks, and a news conference on the cases by the Justice Department's antitrust division in Washington put a strong spotlight on an industry that for all its art and glamor prefers to keep its financial practices out of public view.</p>
        <p>''Those charged today were engaged in classic cartel behavior -- price-fixing, pure and simple,'' said A. Douglas Melamed, acting assistant attorney general for the antitrust division. ''There are serious crimes, and the antitrust division will prosecute them wherever they occur.''</p>
        <p>In a statement released in Washington, the Justice Department said,  ''As a result of the conspiracy, sellers lost their principal bargaining tool.'' The government put Sotheby's revenues from sellers' commissions in the period charged, from April 1993 to December 1999, at more than $225 million in the United States.</p>
        <p>Ms. Brooks, somber in a dark gray suit, offered her guilty plea before Judge Richard N. Berman of Federal District Court in Manhattan. Ms. Brooks, asked by Judge Berman to describe her offense for the court, read a few lines written on a slip of paper: ''At the direction of a superior, I had a number of meetings and conversations with a representative of Christie's International in which, among other things, I agreed to fix prices with respect to the commissions charged to sellers during the period charged.'' And she added, ''Many of the objects sold crossed state lines and elsewhere.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Taubman was Ms. Brooks's only superior.</p>
        <p>Ms. Brooks, accompanied by her lawyers, Stephen E. Kaufman and John S. Siffert, made no effort to evade the throng of reporters in the courtroom and photographers outside, but declined to say anything about the proceeding.</p>
        <p>Government prosecutors in the case, John J. Greene and Patricia Jannaco, were far more specific and wide-ranging in their charges against Ms. Brooks, contending that she and co-conspirators also agreed which company would raise its commission rates first and which would then follow, and agreed to exchange customer information in order to monitor their illicit pact.</p>
        <p>The prosecutors also charged that Ms. Brooks and co-conspirators agreed not to make interest-free loans to sellers or to make charitable contributions to sellers like museums, libraries and family foundations as a way of soliciting business. By her plea, Ms. Brooks accepted guilt on these charges, criminal acts under the Sherman Antitrust Act.</p>
        <p>By coming forward first with evidence of the conspiracy in January, Christie's was provided conditional amnesty from prosecution and so has not been charged. It must, however, cooperate fully with the investigation.</p>
        <p>Ms. Brooks, once called the most powerful woman in the art world, must also cooperate fully -- as must Sotheby's if its plea is accepted by Judge Kaplan -- at the risk of jeopardizing the plea agreement. Ms. Brooks is specifically required to produce all documents sought by the government, to answer all questions fully and truthfully and to testify before the grand jury and at any trial.</p>
