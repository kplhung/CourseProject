        <p>The long tyranny of Slobodan Milosevic was crumbling in Belgrade yesterday. In a tumultuous day reminiscent of the anti-Communist revolutions of 1989, the leading symbols of Yugoslav government power, like the Parliament and the state television station, fell to opposition demonstrators as police resistance melted away. Hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets and, refusing to be intimidated, demanded that the recent election of Vojislav Kostunica as president be respected. Their courage and determination impressed a watching world.</p>
        <p>As the day ended, it seemed likely that Mr. Milosevic's tenure as Yugoslavia's leader would soon expire, perhaps in a matter of hours. Unless he can somehow assert command of the army and security forces for a desperate and doubtless bloody defense of his regime, his options will be few, including accepting an orderly transfer of authority to Mr. Kostunica or attempting to flee the country. After yesterday's decisive events, he can no longer count on support from the three main props of his 13-year rule: the security forces, the state-controlled media and the political and business cronies who have profited from his administration. Mr. Milosevic, who was indicted for war crimes by an international tribunal last year, should eventually be brought to trial.</p>

        <p>The long tyranny of Slobodan Milosevic was crumbling in Belgrade yesterday. In a tumultuous day reminiscent of the anti-Communist revolutions of 1989, the leading symbols of Yugoslav government power, like the Parliament and the state television station, fell to opposition demonstrators as police resistance melted away. Hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets and, refusing to be intimidated, demanded that the recent election of Vojislav Kostunica as president be respected. Their courage and determination impressed a watching world.</p>
        <p>As the day ended, it seemed likely that Mr. Milosevic's tenure as Yugoslavia's leader would soon expire, perhaps in a matter of hours. Unless he can somehow assert command of the army and security forces for a desperate and doubtless bloody defense of his regime, his options will be few, including accepting an orderly transfer of authority to Mr. Kostunica or attempting to flee the country. After yesterday's decisive events, he can no longer count on support from the three main props of his 13-year rule: the security forces, the state-controlled media and the political and business cronies who have profited from his administration. Mr. Milosevic, who was indicted for war crimes by an international tribunal last year, should eventually be brought to trial.</p>
        <p>It is appropriate that Mr. Milosevic's downfall is being engineered by his own people, not his many foreign foes. The Clinton administration and other Western governments are right to offer verbal encouragement but otherwise stand aside. President Clinton's promise to lift economic sanctions against Yugoslavia is a tangible incentive for change.</p>
        <p>Russia has much to gain, and little to lose, by using its influence in Belgrade to speed Mr. Milosevic from power. President Vladimir Putin should abandon Moscow's neutrality on the outcome of the Yugoslav election and affirm Mr. Kostunica's victory.</p>
        <p>Once they firmly gain power, Mr. Kostunica and his allies will confront the challenge of creating a democratic government and free society on the ruins of a collapsed tyranny. In some ways, they will have a simpler task than Belgrade's Central and East European neighbors faced in 1989. Yugoslavia already has a legitimately elected president and Parliament that can now assume legal authority. While a majority of the legislators elected last month ran as Milosevic allies, many may now transfer their loyalties to democratic government.</p>
        <p>A crucial step will be to depoliticize the army and police, which have been agents of repression under Mr. Milosevic. Many commanders will have to be removed, and some should be brought to trial for their role in enforcing Mr. Milosevic's brutal policies. Encouragingly, important elements of the security forces stood aside as the protesters converged on Belgrade yesterday, indicating that their loyalty is to the Serbian people, not Mr. Milosevic.</p>
        <p>The victory of democracy in Yugoslavia will have significance for all Europe. For nearly a decade, Mr. Milosevic's policies of military aggrandizement and ethnic persecution have blighted the Balkans and embroiled the United Nations and NATO. He brought war and suffering to Croatia, Bosnia and Kosovo, driving hundreds of thousands of people from their homes -- including many Serbs after these wars went badly for Belgrade and its allies. Once he has left office, Europe will at last be democratic and whole from the Atlantic to the borders of the former Soviet Union and beyond.</p>
