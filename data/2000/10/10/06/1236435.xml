        <p>Workers erected a perimeter fence of fresh-cut oak branches along the Via Manzoni, Milan's main shopping street, preparing for Wednesday's party celebrating the opening of Giorgio Armani's long-awaited new flagship store.

        <p>Workers erected a perimeter fence of fresh-cut oak branches along the Via Manzoni, Milan's main shopping street, preparing for Wednesday's party celebrating the opening of Giorgio Armani's long-awaited new flagship store. Mr. Armani himself stood on the sidewalk at 10 a.m., tearing apart a window display.</p>
        <p>The suede headboard was facing the wrong direction, he told his assistants in Italian. The folding screen was angled inelegantly. The silk pillows were stacked, not scattered. With seven assistants tailing him, and several more on alert inside, the designer -- dressed in rumpled trousers, suede loafers and a quilted silk jacket -- deconstructed the window.</p>
        <p>It was a moment of ironic symmetry in Mr. Armani's long career. Four decades ago, his first job was as a window dresser. Now, at 66, he heads a company with $850 million in reported annual sales, the most profitable fashion business in Italy. In many senses, Mr. Armani is the proprietor of a very big store.</p>
        <p>The new Armani place itself is built on a Virgin Megastore scale. At 315,000 square feet, it features separate departments for the designer's jeans, his higher-end lines, an art-book shop, a florist, an Emporio Armani boutique, an Armani Home department, a branch of the restaurant Nobu and a Sony electronics section.</p>
        <p>All told, it occupies three levels of a historic building by Enrico Griffini, a proponent of the Fascist architectural style. Mr. Armani spent $62.5 million for the building and another $10 million on a restoration, a year in the works, designed by Michael Gabbelini.</p>
        <p>If any of this caused Mr. Armani to suffer from the newly fashionable Milanese complaint, stress -- ''sono stressatissimo,'' is heard here almost as often as ''ciao'' -- you would not have guessed it from his demeanor throughout the day.</p>
        <p>''He thrives on chaos,'' someone from within his organization said. ''Chaos and control.''</p>
        <p>In the hours that followed the morning window critique, Mr. Armani showed his spring 2001 collection in several consecutive presentations to accommodate the hordes of buyers and fashion journalists, who are particularly alert to the fact that he has been preoccupied by a forthcoming 25-year-career retrospective at the Guggenheim Museum in New York, which opens later this month. He also presided over a front-row celebrity petting zoo that included Phil Collins; the mayor of Milan; a gum-chewing Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, with her new boyfriend, Count Gadda della Gherardesca; a dour Robert DeNiro; and both the ''new Sophia Loren,'' Maria Grazia Cucinotta, and the original Sophia Loren, still capable of putting imitators to shame. Then Mr. Armani slipped upstairs in his palazzo on Via Borgonuovo, casually changed into  his trademark muscle T-shirt and returned to his store to serve as host for a four-hour party for ''tutta Milano,'' all of Milan.</p>
        <p>''People think of Pucci as psychedelic prints, but my father designed not just scarves but a universe,'' said Laudomia Pucci, who has the title image director for the House of Emilio Pucci, on a muggy morning this week. A few days earlier, a new store had opened on Via Montenapoleone, showcasing designs drawn from the archive of the late Florentine marquis with an amazing eye for design and women, and with a less predictable nose for business. Emilio Pucci was invariably described by a lap dog press as a Florentine of ancient lineage, an ace skier, a dashing prototype for jet set lady-killers.</p>
        <p>It was less often remarked that he was an adroit designer (of capri pants, for one thing, adapted from island fishermen's clothes), an experimenter with fabrics (he pioneered stretch materials) and a man with an extensive and highly dubious Fascist past. Early this year, Ms. Pucci, the designer's only surviving child, entered into a deal with LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the luxury conglomerate, which acquired a 66-percent share in Pucci for the chance to resuscitate a neovintage brand and to revive the aristocratic dressmaker's design ethos.</p>
        <p>''It's not a matter of Puccis are in and colors are in,'' Ms. Pucci said, explaining that the aim is to expand the Pucci customer base beyond the socialites who are prone to flashbacks of that kooky shift Mummy wore to cocktails at the Slocums' in Newport. ''We can't look back all our lives to the 1960's.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Pucci, who came to fashion by way of degrees in politics and economics, added: ''The most precious thing my father left to me was not his archive but his spirit.</p>
        <p>''We intend to make this a durable fashion brand.''</p>
