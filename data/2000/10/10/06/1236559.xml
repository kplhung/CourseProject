        <p>Deadly clashes in Israel and the Palestinian territories slowed but did not stop today, even as the Palestinian and Israeli leaders issued orders to curb the violence and both sides continued talks on how to end the rioting that has spilled over the region for a week.</p>
        <p>After a stormy meeting in Paris with Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright failed to reach a cease-fire agreement early today, Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel and Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, promised to order their commanders to pull back and restore calm to flash points under their control.</p>
        <p>''Both sides actually gave instructions simultaneously to commanders back in the field,'' said the chief American negotiator, Dennis B. Ross, who resumed talks today with Israeli and Palestinian officials at the Red Sea resort town of Sharm el Sheik, in Egypt.</p>
        <p>But in an unusual public assessment en route to Egypt from Paris this morning, Mr. Ross expressed caution over whether the pledges would immediately quell the violence, which officials on both sides feared could yet surge with the Muslim holy day on Friday. ''Obviously this has to be translated on the ground,'' he said.</p>
        <p>As part of the effort to end the fighting, Dr. Albright flew to Egypt to meet with President Hosni Mubarak, who was host for a negotiating session with the secretary and Mr. Arafat. After initially indicating that he would join the talks, Mr. Barak stayed home, apparently to watch over events in Israel and the Palestinian territories.</p>
        <p>By midday, Israeli tanks had begun pulling away from checkpoints outside Nablus, Bethlehem, Ramallah and other West Bank cities under Palestinian control where some of the worst clashes took place this week. And despite three more Palestinian deaths reported today, the atmosphere in the Palestinian territories and Israel's Arab neighborhoods seemed notably less volatile.</p>
        <p>Israeli field commanders met with their Palestinian counterparts, and there were few reported uses of live ammunition by either Israeli soldiers or the Palestinian police.</p>
        <p>At a Gaza Strip crossroads where stone-hurling protesters have battled daily with Israeli soldiers, the Israeli Army at first withheld fire as rioters massed for a new round of fighting. But an exchange of homemade gasoline bombs and rubber-coated bullets soon escalated into another fire fight. One Palestinian was shot dead as he tried to tear down an Israeli flag. At a highway outside Bethlehem tonight, the Israeli police said they shot and killed two Palestinians preparing to firebomb passing Israeli cars.</p>
        <p>Those deaths brought the number killed since last week to at least 70, all but three of them Palestinians. Despite the continuing bloodshed, however, security chiefs on both sides appeared to be working to keep uniformed soldiers and civilians away from flash points.</p>
        <p>''We will not tire, we will not waver in our attempt to bring quiet and a cessation of violence in the field,'' Mr. Barak said tonight.</p>
        <p>Even with the pledges from Mr. Barak and Mr. Arafat, officials on both sides faced the prospect of worsening violence come Friday, when thousands of Muslim worshipers are expected to converge on Al Aksa and the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem's Old City. That was where the violence was touched off a week ago with a visit to the plaza outside the sacred sites by the rightist opposition leader, Ariel Sharon.</p>
        <p>The radical Islamic movement Hamas, which bitterly chastised Mr.  Arafat for negotiating with Mr. Barak while the violence continued, vowed today to turn the Muslim day of prayer into another ''day of rage.'' The group urged Muslim faithful to break through any lines that the Israeli police set up to limit access to the holy sites.</p>
        <p>[As it often does during the Jewish holy days, the Israeli Army closed off the West Bank and Gaza Strip from Friday morning through Monday night for Yom Kippur, which will restrict access to the mosques for Muslims in the Palestinian territories.]</p>
        <p>Palestinian doctors said today that they had gathered a team of two dozen or more medical volunteers who will be stationed at the sacred structures in the event of clashes, which senior Israeli Army officers and some Palestinian security chiefs said they were expecting.</p>
        <p>''Will it build to a climax tomorrow and then edge off?'' asked Yarden Vatikai, an Israeli Army spokesman. ''Maybe.''</p>
        <p>''But something has ruptured;  something has happened,'' he said, ''and it seems hard to imagine we could go back to the way things were before.''</p>
        <p>Still, the American failure to secure a written cease-fire agreement at the talks in Paris and Sharm el Sheik has cast a darkening shadow over the Clinton administration's labors to resume substantive peace negotiations in Washington next week. Anger over the rising Palestinian death toll and the protests it has fueled throughout the Middle East was enough for the State Department to announce that it would close American embassies and consulates in the region until after the Columbus Day holiday on Monday.</p>
        <p>Dr. Albright said in Egypt today that Mr. Barak had told Mr. Arafat in Paris that he was sorry about the  Palestinian deaths. And for her own part, the secretary said there had been ''too many funerals, too many tears and too many lives shattered.''</p>
        <p>But in her harshest assessment yet of the prospects for the peace deal that she and President Clinton have been searching for with special urgency since the Camp David summit meeting in July, Dr. Albright acknowledged that a road forward was ''clearly extremely difficult.''</p>
        <p>In addition, President Mubarak, who has been an important force in Middle East diplomacy for nearly 20 years, issued one of his starkest warnings today on the prospects for peace, telling the Egyptian Army newspaper in an interview that the settlement being urged by Washington ''would be a time bomb that would explode in the faces of all.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mubarak blamed Israel -- and by implication the United States -- for pushing a peace agreement that Palestinians regard as fundamentally unjust.</p>
        <p>''Israel has insisted on demands it knows well that Palestinians cannot accept, such as imposing Israeli sovereignty over the area of Haram al Sharif,'' Mr. Mubarak said, referring to the holy sites in Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>He added that this could lead ''vengefulness'' to be vented.</p>
        <p>At the end of the meeting in Egypt today, Mr. Mubarak's foreign minister, Amr Moussa, described the atmosphere between the Israelis and Palestinians as ''poisonous'' and reiterated the Palestinian demand for an international inquiry into why and how the fighting started.</p>
        <p>That demand remained unresolved today. The central dispute was Israel's objection to an international commission of inquiry. That plan has been pushed by President Jacques Chirac of France and backed publicly by most European nations and the Arab bloc, as well as the United Nations human rights commissioner, Mary Robinson.</p>
        <p>''There should be a fact-finding committee that looks at causes of this crisis, what has gone wrong and how we can ensure that it never happens again,'' Dr. Albright said after the talks today.</p>
        <p>But the Israelis have refused an international commission, arguing that it could prove unwieldy and unsympathetic to Israeli security interests and thus become a hindrance to the broader peace effort.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak's top adviser, Danny Yatom, today laid much of the blame  for the failure to reach a cease-fire accord in Paris on Mr. Chirac. ''The French position did not help in establishing a climate favorable to sign an accord,'' Mr. Yatom told public radio. ''France contributed to the fact that end of the day Yasir Arafat did not sign, even though he told Albright that all the accords will be respected, whether written or verbal.''</p>
        <p>As the dispute lingered, Mr. Barak sent what his office termed ''a sharply worded letter'' to a hundred world leaders today, asking them to urge Mr. Arafat to ''put an end to the violence; utilize the diplomatic channel; make the necessary decisions for changing the face of the Middle East.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Arafat, returning from Egypt to Gaza this afternoon, said he was willing to resume peace talks, but ''first we must stop the massacres against our people.''</p>
        <p>While Mr. Barak's critics at home attacked him for negotiating with Mr. Arafat while violence continued, the prime minister said it would be premature -- and dangerous -- to conclude that Mr. Arafat was uninterested in a negotiated peace.</p>
        <p>''However, it is clear that we do not have a lot of time,'' Mr. Barak added. ''We're talking about another few weeks -- another week, two weeks, a month. In the coming weeks, we will know, and we will act to the best of our judgment.''</p>
