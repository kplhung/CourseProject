        <p>Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush both courted parents and swing voters in battleground states of the Midwest today.</p>
        <p>Here in the heavily Republican hometown of former President Gerald R. Ford, Mr. Gore visited a child care center and appeared at a downtown rally. He discussed his own proposal for tax credits for day care and once again criticized Mr. Bush's plan for a tax cut worth $1.3 trillion over 10 years.</p>
        <p>''For every dollar that I propose to spend on education, my opponent, Governor Bush, proposes to spend $5 on a tax cut for the wealthiest 1 percent,'' Mr. Gore said. ''That's a fact and cannot be refuted. Those are the wrong priorities, in my opinion.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush, meanwhile, spent the day campaigning in Michigan, Wisconsin and Iowa, highlighting ideas to help with child-rearing. He said he wanted government to ''stand side by side with parents,'' and told parents he understood that ''you're battling a culture sometimes that sends a different signal.''</p>
        <p>At the Helen Keller middle school outside Detroit and the McKinley elementary school in Appleton, Wis.,  Mr. Bush spoke of a variety of proposals to help parents, touching on everything from Internet filtering technology, to compensatory time as an alternative to pay for overtime work, to tax credits for telecommuting. He also repeated his call for zero tolerance of misconduct in the schools and for teachers to be shielded from lawsuits resulting from their disciplinary steps.</p>
        <p>The governor said that as president he would encourage Hollywood to restore a nightly hour of family programming on television and to adopt a clearer rating system.</p>
        <p>And he took a swipe at the vice president, who recently appeared at a Hollywood fund-raiser only days after severely criticizing the entertainment industry for marketing explicitly violent films and video games to youths.</p>
        <p>''I want to make it clear about me,'' Mr. Bush said. ''I'm not the kind of person during the day to scold Hollywood, then at night go out there and say: 'Well, I really didn't mean it. I'd like your contribution.' ''</p>
        <p>As for Mr. Gore, he too sought to reach parents concerned about what their children watch. At his rally here in Grand Rapids, he pledged, ''I will work to help parents and strengthen families.''</p>
        <p>Part of that effort would be to block ''inappropriate entertainment'' from reaching children. ''That's not censorship, that's parenting,'' said the vice president, who has spoken of giving the industry a six-month deadline to change its marketing practices.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore also said that ''in order to respect all of our families, we have got to make sure that Social Security and Medicare are sound and reliable and not used as piggy banks for some kind of experimentation on privatizing Social Security.''</p>
        <p>''I'm opposed to diverting one out of every six dollars away from the Social Security trust fund and into the stock market,'' he said of Mr. Bush's proposal to allow workers to direct part of their payroll taxes to private retirement investment accounts.</p>
        <p>After interviews with several Michigan television stations, Mr. Gore flew to Orlando, Fla., where he planned to watch the vice-presidential debate tonight.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore arrived in Michigan late Wednesday night after attending a fund-raising concert at the home of Jon Bon Jovi in Middletown, N.J. The event raised $850,000 from people paying as much as $25,000 a couple to chat with the vice president and Mr. Bon Jovi, who lives in a chateau-like mansion where celebrities including Heather Locklear, Geraldo Rivera and Roger Penske also maintain residences.</p>
        <p>''We are going to remember this evening for a long time,'' Mr. Gore said. ''This may be the single most fun event of the campaign.''</p>
