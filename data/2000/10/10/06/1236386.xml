        <p>In 17th- and 18th-century Europe a mirror was the ultimate status symbol. Louis XIV set the example by installing the spectacular Hall of Mirrors in Versailles. After that, displaying a mirror was a mark of refinement, power, wealth and self-confidence.</p>

        <p>In 17th- and 18th-century Europe a mirror was the ultimate status symbol. Louis XIV set the example by installing the spectacular Hall of Mirrors in Versailles. After that, displaying a mirror was a mark of refinement, power, wealth and self-confidence.</p>
        <p>''At that time the mirror showed where you were in life,'' said Tony Victoria, a specialist in French 18th- and 19th-century antiques who carries mirrors in his gallery, Chez Soi, in Bridgehampton, N.Y. ''For people who had to look their best, mirrors were sort of a necessity. They were functional.''</p>
        <p>Mirrors were very expensive until the 19th century, partly, Mr. Victoria said, because of breakage during production. ''It  was horrendous,'' he explained. ''Much worse than glass. If the amount of glass that was broken during production was a factor of 10, the amount of mirror broken during fabrication was more like a factor of 100.''</p>
        <p>The looking glass provided the means for king and courtiers to measure themselves  against accepted standards of fashion and beauty. As France is still the epicenter of fashion and beauty, it is not surprising that one of the most popular exhibitions this summer in the south of France was an ambitious show of more than 100 antique mirrors organized by the dealer Gerard Guerre in Avignon.</p>
        <p>More than 10,000 people found their way to the exhibition in Mr. Guerre's shop, housed in a mansion on Plan de Lunel dating back to when the city was a Papal See (1301-1378).</p>
        <p>The appeal of the show, which closed on Saturday, surprised even its organizer. ''Visitors ranged from age 7 to 87,'' said Mr. Guerre, who has specialized in antique mirrors for 40 years. He still has 70 mirrors from the show for sale in his shop.</p>
        <p>Children were particularly intrigued by an elaborate labyrinth of mirrored walls that he constructed within his gallery as background for the antique pieces. ''Ever since Narcissus, man has never ceased to look at his own image,'' he said. ''Limpid water was the first mirror.''</p>
        <p>Mirrors have been valued since they were invented, and this fall some fine ones are turning up at auction houses and galleries in New York. They have a complicated history.</p>
        <p>What is believed to be the first known hand mirror, made of shiny obsidian, dates from the seventh century B.C. Round, polished-metal hand mirrors from China date from the Han dynasty (206 B.C. to A.D. 220).</p>
        <p>Metal mirrors lasted a long time. A new illustrated dictionary edited by Lucy Trench, ''Materials and Techniques in the Decorative Arts'' (University of Chicago Press, $60), states that until medieval times, mirrors were still usually made of polished bronze, silver and speculum metal (bronze composed of more than 20 percent tin, as well as copper and lead). In the Middle Ages Europeans began to make mirrors of precious rock crystal backed with foil.</p>
        <p>Mirrors as we know them really began in Nuremberg in the 15th century when the Germans made convex mirrors by blowing a metallic mixture into a hot glass globe. The Metropolitan Museum of Art has a fine example of a 16th-century German mirror made by the Nuremberg goldsmith Wentzel Jamnitzer. It is next to the entrance to the Lehman Wing, in the gallery of Northern Renaissance Art.</p>
        <p>Mr. Guerre has no German mirrors, but he does have early Venetian mirrors from the 1600's; Spanish and Flemish mirrors from the 1600's and 1700's; and several 18th- and 19th-century French mirrors. These mirrors, set in frames of carved and gilded wood, are extremely valuable when the mirror is original to the frame. (Mr. Guerre's son is Vincent Guerre, a Paris dealer in antique gilded French frames who is the only frame expert used by the Paris auction house Drouot.)</p>
        <p>Some of Mr. Guerre's mirrors have uses unknown to most Americans. The 17th-century sorcerer's-eye mirrors are convex, circular looking glasses, some with smaller mirrors incorporated into the surface to reflect multiple, presumably scary images of the viewer. He has a very handsome round one with a pierced zinc frame that can reflect an entire room.</p>
        <p>French bird hunters invented ''miroirs aux alouettes'': half-moon-shaped wooden discs attached to pointed poles that stick in the ground. The discs, with bits of mirror embedded in them, twirl in the wind, like a weather vane, attracting birds in the wild. Mr. Guerre has more than 100 of these, each beautifully handmade in a slightly different shape, from a private collection.</p>
        <p>He also has anamorphic mirrors, mirrored tubes that magnify and reflect along the axis. These mirrors were part of a 19th-century French parlor game. An artist would make a drawing of something that was not decipherable to the naked eye. When the drawing is laid flat on a table, the special mirror is placed on top of it and the reflection is suddenly a clear image. Because of their secretive nature, these images were often slightly naughty. Mr. Guerre has a set of ten 18th-century watercolors that depict charming commedia dell' arte figures -- once the anamorphic mirror is placed on top of them.</p>
        <p>Some of Mr. Guerre's mirrors are quite rare. One pair of round convex mirrors from the early 19th-century comes from the London firm Georges Searl &amp; Son. They are identical to the ones that the 19th-century English architect Sir John Soane commissioned for his house in London, where they still adorn the main room in what is now a house museum on Lincoln's Inn Fields.</p>
        <p>Mr. Guerre is not the only one selling mirrors this fall. This week several mirrors were in Sotheby's sale of Continental furniture in New York. Sometimes old mirrors look better when they are not in mint condition. Lot 94 was a six-foot-tall Italian Rococo giltwood mirror from the 18th century with carved foliate borders and a crest of mirrored cartouches. The glass showed fogging.</p>
        <p>''This happens when the mercury separates from the plate,'' Mary F. Cunningham, Sotheby's expert, explained. ''You can't fake the look. It's one of the best quality Italian mirrors we've had, and very gutsy.'' It sold on Wednesday for $38,125, above its high estimate of $35,000.</p>
        <p>Lot 15 in the same sale was a pair of mirrors consigned by the Art Institute of Chicago. Also Italian Rococo, these mid-18th-century mirrors had borders of carved silver gilt vines and flowers. ''When the Italians could not afford gold leaf, they would do the borders in silver with a gold wash to make it appear gold-leafed,'' Ms. Cunningham said. Though the silver gilt has been restored, the color is a fine metallic gray that makes them look almost modern. The pair sold for $30,650, above the $12,000 high estimate.</p>
        <p>Now could be a good time to buy antique mirrors. As art collecting becomes more important, people have been replacing mirrors over the fireplace with paintings. Clever buyers are taking advantage of the lull.</p>
