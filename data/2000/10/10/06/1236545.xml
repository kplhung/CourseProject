        <p>MANHATTAN: FOSTER CARE CASE SET FOR TRIAL  A federal judge in Manhattan has ruled that a trial is needed to determine whether the city and a foster care agency deprived a father of due process by failing to notify him that his missing son had been in city foster care for years. The lawsuit involves a limousine driver, Hardaway H., and his son, Daniel H., whose last name has been withheld from legal papers. The son had been placed with the agency, St. Dominic's Home, after he was taken by his mother and apparently abused. St. Dominic's contends that it could not find the father. The father, who spent six years searching for his son, said he had a listed telephone number in Queens. The judge, Victor Marrero, has ordered all the parties to appear for a pretrial conference today.</p>

        <p>QUEENS: COMPUTERS RECOVERED  Two computers that had been stolen from a Democratic National Committee office in Manhattan were found by police officers in a house in Woodhaven yesterday, the police said. The officers went to 97-39 88th Street with a search warrant yesterday afternoon and found two Toshiba laptops and a personal organizer that had been taken from the committee's finance office at 2 Penn Plaza on Sept. 13, said Alan Krawitz, a police spokesman. At the time of the burglary, the police said that they believed it had no political purpose. Three men who were in the house -- Angel Santiago, 30, who lived there; Carlos Rojas, 29, who lived nearby; and William Crespo, 26, a public school teacher in the Bronx -- were charged with possession of stolen property, Mr. Krawitz said.</p>

        <p>STONY BROOK: PLEA FOR UNIVERSAL COLLEGE EDUCATION  Shirley Strum Kenny, the president of the State University of New York at Stony Brook, urged the presidential candidates to propose extending universal education, now kindergarten through 12th grade, to include college, with the federal government guaranteeing financial assistance. Dr. Kenny said the candidates could start with two years of college and eventually move to four. She said it the expense would be ''the greatest bargain since the Louisiana Purchase.''</p>

        <p>GARDEN CITY: END TO TRANSIT DEAL URGED  The Nassau County comptroller, Fred Parola, in response to the county's troubled finances, said yesterday the county might end costly deals with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and might go to court to do so. He said taxpayers would save $160 million. Since 1996, the county has received $121 million from the authority to balance its budget, in exchange for paying for $242 million in authority capital projects. But the county arranged to pay for the projects with bond debt, leading to $134 million in interest over the 24-year life of the bonds. Tom Kelly, a spokesman for the transit authority, said it had entered the deal at the county's request.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: RAPE COMPLAINT WITHDRAWN  A 15-year-old Manhattan girl who told the police on Monday that she had been sexually assaulted by two teenage boys in a bathroom at Central Park East High School has withdrawn her complaint, the police said on Wednesday. The police said a guidance counselor reported seeing the girl on a different floor at the time that the attack was alleged to have taken place. The authorities have dropped their inquiry into the case.</p>

        <p>PERTH AMBOY: CHURCH SEES A SPLOTCH, NOT A VIRGIN  The Roman Catholic Church, according to its official newspaper, has determined that the image in a local apartment window is not that of the Virgin Mary. For the last three weeks, hundreds of pilgrims have venerated the image, in the home of Romona and Marcelino Collado, as a miracle. But in this week's issue of The Catholic Spirit, the official newspaper of the Catholic Diocese of Metuchen, Msgr. Michael J. Alliegro was quoted as saying: ''It's a rainbow-colored splotch. Anyone who has ever worked with glass knows that its appearance can change as the seasons progress or as the sun moves.''</p>

        <p>CONNECTICUT</p>
        <p>EAST HARTFORD: STADIUM CONSTRUCTION BEGINS  With the threat of an environmental lawsuit lifted, work has begun on the University of Connecticut's 40,000-seat football stadium. Crews have begun moving construction equipment onto the land, once the site of a United Technologies Corporation airstrip. Environmentalists threatened legal action to stop the stadium after rare birds were found nesting there, but the National Audubon Society has decided not to proceed. Carolyn Hughes, deputy director of the society in Connecticut, said, ''We didn't have time to react.''</p>
