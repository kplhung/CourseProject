        <p>The News Corporation said yesterday that Lachlan Murdoch, the oldest son of the company's chairman, Rupert Murdoch, had been named deputy chief operating officer, the No. 3 position at the company.</p>
        <p>Lachlan Murdoch, 29, who has long been his father's designated heir, will report to Peter Chernin, the president and chief operating officer. Lachlan Murdoch is expected to one day run the media giant, in which the Murdoch family holds 31 percent of the voting shares.</p>
        <p>Lachlan Murdoch has been responsible for the company's United States print operations, which include HarperCollins Publishers, a large insert business and The New York Post, as well as the News Corporation's print and cable businesses in Australia.</p>
        <p>In a telephone interview yesterday, Lachlan Murdoch said that ''being Peter's deputy will let me spend more time with the different global businesses and get my teeth into them.'' He added: ''I like to get my hands dirty and roll up my sleeves.''</p>
        <p>The promotion will give the younger Murdoch ''an appointment that puts me across all the companies,'' he said. ''It gives me an opportunity to spend time with people I haven't spent time with before. ''</p>
        <p>Though both Lachlan Murdoch and a younger brother, James, have prominent positions at the News Corporation -- James is chief executive of Star TV, the company's Asian satellite business -- neither has worked directly at the Fox Network or with the company's 23 television stations, which represent the largest component of the company's profits. By putting Lachlan Murdoch into his new position, his father is seeing that he has more exposure to the company's American television operations.</p>
        <p>Lachlan Murdoch will retain his current responsibilities. During his tenure in Australia, he received high marks for his management of the company's print operations and was seen as making a strong effort to be approachable even though his father controlled the company. But an attempt to start a theme park called Fox Studios Backlot in Australia has proved to be a disappointment.</p>
        <p>He spends part of his time in Australia and part in New York but said he would now be in Los Angeles and would probably get a house or an apartment there.</p>
