        <p>By 6:15 a.m. my friend Lou and I were stumbling out of the Clark Currier Inn and driving the few miles to Plum Island on the North Shore of Massachusetts. Our headlights cut through the fog as we followed the road along the Merrimack River toward the sea.

        <p>By 6:15 a.m. my friend Lou and I were stumbling out of the Clark Currier Inn and driving the few miles to Plum Island on the North Shore of Massachusetts. Our headlights cut through the fog as we followed the road along the Merrimack River toward the sea. Plum Island is a natural barrier beach, a nine-mile-long spit of sand, dune grasses, trees and tidal marsh -- and beach plums, hence its name -- that attracts huge numbers of migrating birds in the spring and fall.</p>
        <p>Its southern end is preserved as the Parker River National Wildlife Refuge. Our destination was the visitors' center, where we would meet our guide from the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, a biologist named Steve Haydock, and a small, floppy-hatted band of birders.</p>
        <p>We met in a parking lot inside the refuge  and assembled our binoculars, spotting scopes and field guides. One woman who had driven from New York City offered us her bug spray. Our first stop was a two-acre salt pond beside the park road. It was set in a prairie of marsh grasses, which showed scarlet on their feathery tips, an early sign of the turn to autumn.</p>
        <p>Steve was talking about the teeming life of the pond when he stopped in midsentence and exclaimed: ''Oh, look! Up there! There! It's a semi-palmated plover!'' The eyes of the group found the bird and followed its descent to a mud flat. There were murmurs and questions all around as we watched the bird snatch its breakfast.</p>
        <p>The bird walk had been Lou's idea. ''I love this place!'' he kept saying as he peered through his binoculars and exclaimed over the blue-winged teal, the egrets and the herons. I couldn't tell one small brown shorebird from the next. What attracted me were the wild swans lounging elegantly in the middle of the pond; they reminded me of the swans and the swan boats in the Boston Public Garden.</p>
        <p>But no one else was in the least interested in the swans, and when I asked Steve about them, he dismissed them as non-native. They were introduced from Europe many years ago as an exotic addition to the area's estates, he said. I admired Steve and Lou and the others for their early morning concentration on wildlife. I kept wishing I would look through the binoculars and see a sign that said coffee.</p>
        <p>This was our second day on the North Shore, which stretches from Boston to New Hampshire and includes the towns of Marblehead, Salem, Gloucester and Rockport as well as Newburyport. The area is rich in nature and history, but I was drawn for personal reasons. When I was a child, my family would make an annual late summer pilgrimage to the area to visit my grandfather, David Rimer, a Lithuanian immigrant who had settled in Salem.</p>
        <p>I grew up in Levittown, Pa., in the 1950's and 60's. To me, New England was everything that Levittown, a suburb without a past, was not. Everything in our house on Spicebush Road was new and modern. My grandfather lived on the first floor of an old two-story house with mahogany furniture covered with lace doilies worn soft by washing, a bathtub on claws and wooden floors that creaked. Down the street was his small tailor shop. At the other end was the bay.</p>
        <p>Year after year we followed the same routine. We spent afternoons at the beach. We ate fried clams, lobster in the rough and ice cream. We browsed through the shops and art galleries of Rockport, always stopping at the same place to buy penny candy. We watched the fishermen unload their catches in Gloucester. We drove to Marblehead, admiring the stately houses and the boats in the harbor.</p>
        <p>Now living in Philadelphia, I wanted to go back with Lou to the New England of my childhood. We flew into Boston from Philadelphia late on a Friday night and made the hour's drive north to Newburyport, at the northern end of the North Shore. Newburyport, a thriving shipping port in the 18th century, had not been on my childhood itinerary, and I had always wanted to see it. We checked into the Clark Currier Inn, a three-story house, white with black shutters, built in 1803 by Thomas March Clark, one of Newburyport's shipbuilders. With its antiques and wide staircase, it was many times grander than my grandfather's house. But still, there it was: the familiar scent of dry wood and old furniture. We took a midnight stroll through the inn's rose garden. It was late summer, but the cool air made it feel like fall.</p>
        <p>The Sea's Ships</p>
        <p>The next day we made the short walk from the inn to the cobblestone center of town, where the 18th- and 19th-century red brick buildings, some of which were once mills, have been renovated and turned into shops, cafes and restaurants. We drove the four miles to Plum Island and had breakfast at Mad Martha's, a funky, friendly place with a jar of wildflowers on the counter, purple stools and a few tables. Lou had cod cakes and Boston baked beans. I had homemade oatmeal and a fresh fruit plate that was not on the menu but that the waitress went to some trouble to prepare.</p>
        <p>We returned to the Newburyport waterfront, where we visited the Custom House, an 1835 building of granite that came from Rockport. It has been transformed into a modest museum of the town's shipbuilding and seafaring past. Newburyport's ships and merchants figured prominently in New England's trade with the Caribbean and England in the colonial period and when the nation was young. Ships from all over the world once registered their cargo -- gunpowder, molasses and sugar -- with the port surveyor at the Custom House. Newburyport's former prosperity is evident in the big houses built then, and the story is told at the Custom House.</p>
        <p>From there, we made the short drive to Amesbury to visit Lowell's Boat Shop, which dates to 1793 and is one of the country's oldest wooden boat-building operations. Perched on the Merrimack River, the boat shop is itself a living museum, filled with the pungent smells of glues and cedar and pine boards and the sight of half-formed skiffs and dories.</p>
        <p>A young man inside, working on his own skiff, showed us around. He led us to an aging beam that showed the marks left by boat builders long ago marking their production -- scores of dories bound for rich fishing banks off New England. He also pointed to the river, where we saw some of the shop's boats tugging at their lines in the river, a scene probably not much changed from a century ago.</p>
        <p>To the Beach</p>
        <p>But now it was time for the beach. We found our way back to Route 1A and then winding Route 133 through the country towns of Rowley and Ipswich, past salt marshes, muddy-banked tidal rivers, cornfields, farm stands, wood lots and tight and tidy homes, clapboard capes and New England saltboxes. We never seemed far from the salt water, catching a blue glimpse of it here, a salty whiff of it there. We stopped at Russell Orchards in Ipswich to buy a loaf of bread, goat cheese made in Massachusetts, tomatoes and homemade doughnuts. We ate the doughnuts on the spot.</p>
        <p>It was already fall at the orchard. The pumpkins and apples were piled high. Lou loves orchards and barns, and he wandered around the giant post-and-beam frame of the Russell  barn. We got back in the car and pointed east toward the beach.</p>
        <p>Crane Beach is a tucked-away quarter moon of white sand, sheltered by dunes and sandy cliffs, beneath the shoulder of nearby Castle Hill. The beach, the hill and a 59-room mansion that occupies it, as well as nearby marshland and islands, form the Crane Estate, land placed in trust by the family whose fortune traces back to Richard T. Crane Sr., the 19th-century Chicago industrialist. The land is now protected from development and open for public use. We bundled up in sweat shirts, placed our blanket on a patch of sunny sand and spread out our picnic lunch. Only a few stalwarts were braving the icy waves.</p>
        <p>It was too cold for us to swim, but late in the afternoon we got out on the water aboard an Essex River Cruise boat, in nearby Essex. Capt. Dan  Courtemanche steered the boat, a pontoon, slowly up the Essex River and into Ipswich Bay while a blue heron flew behind us. The wind rustled the spartina grasses. ''We've built more wooden ships in Essex than any other place in the world,'' Captain Dan told us.</p>
        <p>From the water we could see Castle Hill, Crane Beach and Hog Island, where the 1996 film ''The Crucible,'' based on Arthur Miller's play about the Salem witch trials, was shot. Captain Dan told us the moviemakers had paid the local clammers $200 a day not to clam so they would not detract from what was supposed to be the 17th-century scenery. Ninety minutes later, as we returned to the dock, Captain Dan, whom we had imagined as an old North Shore salt, told us that because of soaring real estate prices he had had to move inland, from Gloucester to Derry, N.H. He commutes 85 miles a day.</p>
        <p>Ode to the Fried Clam</p>
        <p>Conveniently across the way from Essex River Cruise and Charters is the culinary capital of the North Shore: Woodman's, birthplace of the fried clam. Legend has it that Lawrence Woodman, known as Chubby,  came up with the delicacy 84 years ago by plopping a bunch of clams into a boiling pot of lard on the wood stove at his roadside stand.</p>
        <p>Woodman's is now a sprawling screened-in restaurant with the festive atmosphere of a pavilion at a state fair. On many Saturday nights, a long line stretches along the roadway. We were lucky and made it to the counter within minutes.</p>
        <p>''Clams are running large,'' said a sign on the wall. Lou ordered the fried clam plate, and I picked the boiled lobster, which I supplemented with more than a few of Lou's fried clams. It is impossible for me to eat fried clams without thinking of my father, who savored them during our trips to his boyhood home and now, living in North Carolina, still boasts about the superiority of the fried clams on his native North Shore. In the past, Lou and I have enjoyed equally wonderful fried clams and other fish dishes at J. T. Farnham's, about a mile down the road from Woodman's, in Essex.</p>
        <p>What comes after fried clams and lobster in the rough in New England? Ice cream, of course. New Englanders glory in their ice cream. I once saw a man swaddled inside a thick coat eating an ice cream cone beside the Charles River in Cambridge on a frigid winter day.</p>
        <p>On the way back to Newburyport, we stopped at White Farms, a stand near the Rowley town line that makes its own ice cream. We ordered what were billed as small cones, which turned out to be three enormous scoops. Lou was thrilled to see one of his favorite flavors, the hard-to-find ginger, on the menu. I  had peppermint stick and mocha chip and, I confess, I ate it all and still had room to sample Lou's ginger. Even by New England standards, White Farms makes extraordinary ice cream.</p>
        <p>On Sunday, we wanted to pack less into the day and maybe even eat a little less. The bird walk ended prematurely when it started to rain. We headed to Gloucester, the hard-luck fishing village that had a starring role in ''The Perfect Storm,'' and happened upon a ceremony honoring the town's 5,368 fishermen who have died at sea over the years. A large crowd had gathered at the waterfront to dedicate the Gloucester Fishermen's Wall of Remembrance, where the names of the dead are inscribed in bronze. Bagpipers played a mournful tune.</p>
        <p>Afterward we sat on the deck at McT's, a seafood restaurant overlooking the harbor, with a view of the fishing fleet and jumble of docks and warehouses. We ate New England clam chowder, which is never as good anywhere else. Then we meandered along the waterfront before getting in the car. We drove to Marblehead, walked up the hill and looked down on the yacht-choked harbor where people wait years for a permanent mooring. As we took our last gulps of the sea air, we hoped this fix of New England would last a long time.</p>
