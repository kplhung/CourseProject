        <p>Last week, Matthew Bender, a leading legal publishing house, announced that it would move its headquarters from Manhattan to downtown Newark, taking offices in the National Newark Building. Gene McGovern, senior vice president of operations for Matthew Bender, said the company, a subsidiary of Lexis-Nexis Group, chose Newark for its ''dramatic cost advantage,'' and the ease with which its 250 employees, 80 percent of whom live in New Jersey and New York City, can reach Newark. He said the presence of two law schools, Seton Hall and Rutgers, also made Newark a logical choice. When Matthew Bender moves in, possibly by next spring, the National Newark Building, a 34-story neoclassical tower, will be 85 percent occupied, said Arthur Stern, chief executive of Cogswell Realty Group, the building's owner.</p>
