        <p>Trying to figure out who will become a head coach in the National Football League is sometimes about as easy as doing trigonometry. Case in point: the Jets. This past off-season, Al Groh -- the now undefeated Groh -- thought his chances of becoming a head coach were so minuscule that he strongly considered leaving professional football and coaching in college again.</p>
        <p>Then came that awkward day when Bill Belichick bolted to the New England Patriots, and -- voila -- now Groh could be coaching in the Super Bowl instead of in the Fiesta Bowl.</p>

        <p>Trying to figure out who will become a head coach in the National Football League is sometimes about as easy as doing trigonometry. Case in point: the Jets. This past off-season, Al Groh -- the now undefeated Groh -- thought his chances of becoming a head coach were so minuscule that he strongly considered leaving professional football and coaching in college again.</p>
        <p>Then came that awkward day when Bill Belichick bolted to the New England Patriots, and -- voila -- now Groh could be coaching in the Super Bowl instead of in the Fiesta Bowl.</p>
        <p>At the end of last season, Bruce Coslet, the Cincinnati Bengals' coach, considered stepping down, one of his former assistants said. But he thought that maybe the team could turn around and decided against it. And then -- voila -- he unexpectedly quit last week after the Bengals started 0-3 for an N.F.L.-record 10th time.</p>
        <p>It's about timing, and this year in New York is a good time to be a Jets or Giants assistant coach because the teams have a combined 7-1 record. Assuming the winning continues, at the end of the season when general managers of teams that just fired their head coaches are looking for replacements, their gaze will look to the New York teams.</p>
        <p>It is a yearly ritual. Losing teams often go to the winning franchises for coaching talent. Which means some Giants and Jets coaches might be changing ZIP codes and moving up in tax brackets.</p>
        <p>Coslet is the first of a possible half-dozen head-coaching changes that might occur before next season, involving such teams as Pittsburgh, Jacksonville, Cleveland, Arizona, San Francisco, Detroit and Washington.</p>
        <p>Expect to see some, if not all, of the following New York coaches mentioned as candidates once the coaching carousel begins spinning:</p>
        <p>*The Giants' defensive coordinator John Fox and the defensive backs coach Johnnie Lynn: no assistant coach in football is more ready to be a head coach than Fox. His defensive schemes are constantly smart and he is highly respected by players.</p>
        <p>Lynn is one of the game's bright young coaches, and he is liked by many in the organization. Each season Lynn patches up a secondary that has major holes, whether from injuries to its stars like Jason Sehorn, or from free-agent losses, or weak links like cornerback Dave Thomas. This season, the Giants did not give up a pass play longer than 31 yards until their fourth game.</p>
        <p>*The Giants' offensive coordinator/quarterbacks coach Sean Payton. Payton's smart playcalling has caught the attention of several general managers. He is capable of making the leap from a position coach to a head coach. It has happened before. Andy Reid was the quarterbacks coach for the Green Bay Packers before being named head coach of the Philadelphia Eagles. The same happened with Steve Mariucci before he became the San Francisco 49ers' head coach.</p>
        <p>*The Jets' assistant head coach/ running backs coach Maurice Carthon, the offensive coordinator Dan Henning and the offensive line coach Bill Muir. General Manager Bill Parcells raves about Carthon to his league buddies. ''You would think Carthon was Lombardi from the way Bill speaks about the guy sometimes,'' said one official on a competing team.</p>
        <p>A Parcells recommendation is like the Good Housekeeping seal of approval. Carthon, who has excellent people skills, a meticulous nature and solid organization skills, is young, but he could be in the mold of Oakland Coach Jon Gruden, who is only 37, just 2 years older than Carthon.</p>
        <p>Henning had two unsuccessful head coaching stints in Atlanta and San Diego, but his handling of the powerful Jets offense, as well as his close relationship with quarterback Vinny Testaverde (some in the Jets organization say it is similar to a father-son relationship) may help him get a third shot. Muir is the unsung hero of the team, especially after the excellent protection provided Testaverde by the offensive line against the fierce rush of Tampa Bay's Warren Sapp.</p>
        <p>So the phones in the two New York teams' offices will very likely ring this off-season with coaching offers. A few assistants may need to set up moving company appointments now.</p>
        <p>Aikman Wants to Return</p>
        <p>Is Dallas Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman, for perhaps the first time in his career, seriously considering retirement because of his high number of concussions?</p>
        <p>Those close to Aikman insist that they will not be surprised if, following this season, he did leave the game after a Hall of Fame career that includes three Super Bowl rings. Aikman has had at least eight concussions as a pro, 10 over all, and is said to realize he may be risking long-term damage.</p>
        <p>Still, friends of the quarterback claim Aikman does not want to retire now, refusing to abandon the 1-3 Cowboys.</p>
        <p>Aikman's agent, Leigh Steinberg, said Aikman had made no decision about his future. ''He's been cleared medically and his main goal is to get the Cowboys back on the winning track,'' Steinberg said.</p>
        <p>Feeling Half His Age</p>
        <p>This past month, one of the N.F.L.'s most valued executives quietly turned 70. ''I feel like I'm 35,'' said George Young, the former Giants general manager and now the league's senior vice president of football operations. ''I don't have an ache. I feel super.''</p>
        <p>Young has been in the league for 33 years and around football for 50. Because of his service to the league as well as two Super Bowl rings, he will most likely enter the Hall of Fame someday. Meanwhile, Young remains one of the busiest executives in the league office. Only the commissioner has a more penciled-in calendar.</p>
        <p>Young originally thought his life would be less hectic once he retired as general manager of the Giants. He is now involved in almost every aspect of the sport. He either handles directly, or is involved in, areas like the competition committee, instant replay, youth football, N.F.L. Europe and the league's attempt to reduce player concussions.</p>
        <p>He is also involved with such issues as officiating, team tampering, and disciplining players for on-field rules violations, like excessive celebration. In fact, Young was part of the N.F.L.'s decision to make any pose --like the one San Francisco wide receiver Terrell Owens did last week at midfield against Dallas -- a 15-yard taunting penalty and a fine.</p>
        <p>Young handles his league job the same way he handled his Giants gig; with a gruff demeanor that is tough yet fair, a self-deprecating sense of humor and a strong intellect.</p>
        <p>''I never take credit for being very smart,'' Young said, ''but I do take credit for being very experienced.''</p>
        <p>Bledsoe on the Block?</p>
        <p>One National Football Conference general manager said last week that the New England Patriots had put out feelers about trading quarterback Drew Bledsoe during the off-season. The team has insisted Bledsoe is in their long-term plans and it has no intention of letting him go. In fact, the owner, Robert K. Kraft, wants Bledsoe to retire as a Patriot.</p>
        <p>''We've never gotten any indication from Bob Kraft that he is anything but supportive of Drew,'' Leigh Steinberg, Bledsoe's agent, said.</p>
        <p>Besides, trading Bledsoe would be extremely difficult because few teams would be able to fit his $9.8 million salary-cap number.</p>
        <p>It is true that Bledsoe has not played well this season, but he is hardly the only reason for the Patriots' 0-4 start. The team has been hampered by the offensive line's poor play, leading to Bledsoe's being sacked six times in each of the first two games. No quarterback can play well under that kind of pass rush.</p>
        <p>The pressure on Bledsoe -- and the rumors about his future -- will only intensify as the season continues. The coming games are at Denver, home against both Indianapolis and the Jets, at Indianapolis and then home against Buffalo. That could lead to an 0-9 or a 1-8 start.</p>
