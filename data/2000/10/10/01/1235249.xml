        <p>Fine for union contracts, perhaps, but a company's books?</p>
        <p>Two top executives of the Sirena Apparel Group, a California swimwear maker, appear to have tried the technique on their financial results, resetting the company computer's clock repeatedly for 12 days to avoid closing the books on the first quarter of 1999 until revenue had met analysts' forecasts, according to federal prosecutors. The maneuver fell apart within weeks, the executives were fired, and last week they were indicted on charges of securities fraud, according to a report in The Washington Post.</p>
