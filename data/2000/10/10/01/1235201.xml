        <p>THE triple threat of big-league corporate earnings warnings, signs of an economic slowdown and elevated oil prices has made the stock market an exceedingly frustrating place of late. What's an investor to do?</p>
        <p>Play the takeover game. That's the advice of Charles LaLoggia, editor of the Superstock Investor newsletter in Rochester. ''We've reached the point where I don't think investors are going to get much help from the economy or from earnings in general,'' Mr. LaLoggia said. ''If you're going to pick stocks, you look for companies in consolidating industries, where there's a certain catalyst that can reasonably lead to a takeover bid.''</p>

        <p>THE triple threat of big-league corporate earnings warnings, signs of an economic slowdown and elevated oil prices has made the stock market an exceedingly frustrating place of late. What's an investor to do?</p>
        <p>Play the takeover game. That's the advice of Charles LaLoggia, editor of the Superstock Investor newsletter in Rochester. ''We've reached the point where I don't think investors are going to get much help from the economy or from earnings in general,'' Mr. LaLoggia said. ''If you're going to pick stocks, you look for companies in consolidating industries, where there's a certain catalyst that can reasonably lead to a takeover bid.''</p>
        <p>Mr. LaLoggia identifies stocks selling below the value of their assets and not dependent on a rising stock market. That strategy has netted him roughly one takeover a month for the last four years. Forty companies are typically on his recommended list.</p>
        <p>This year, eight of Mr. LaLoggia's recommended stocks have received buyout bids, including Advest, Dexter and Pittway.</p>
        <p>While pinpointing buyout candidates may seem chancy, the way Mr. LaLoggia does it is fairly conservative. Many companies he recommends are trading well off their highs. Two carry yields of more than 4 percent, versus the 1.1 percent dividend on the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index. Many have been dumped by the Wall Street herd. Here are some of his picks:</p>
        <p>* Houghton Mifflin, the textbook and educational publisher, has dropped in price in recent weeks after downgrades from analysts. But Mr. LaLoggia says  the company may benefit from a recent takeover wave in the publishing industry. Scholastic bought Grolier last April, and McGraw-Hill acquired the educational publishing business of the Tribune Company last month. Harcourt General put itself on the block in July. ''If there are multiple bidders, a number of them are going to be left at the altar,'' Mr. LaLoggia said. ''Is it a stretch to think they might look at Houghton Mifflin?'' The stock closed on Friday at $39.25, down from a high in August of $51.81.</p>
        <p>* Alliance Capital Management Holdings is 57 percent owned by the Axa Group of France, which recently sold its holdings in Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette and Axa Financial. Mr. LaLoggia thinks Alliance Capital will either be the next to be sold or will be bought out by Axa. ''It doesn't make sense for it to be hanging out there as a separate company,'' he said. Alliance shares closed the week at $50.13.</p>
        <p>* American States Water may benefit from consolidation in the water utility industry. European water companies have been acquiring American ones, and as Mr. LaLoggia pointed out, only a handful of public companies that sell water remain. ''Some of these water utilities are as close as you can get to a free lunch,'' he said. ''They're safe, they have high yields and they are takeover candidates.'' The stock closed at $30.25, while its takeover value is around $45, Mr. LaLoggia said.</p>
        <p>* The Performance Food Group distributes food to restaurants nationwide. The industry has been shrinking as two giants, Royal Ahold and Sysco, have battled for the No. 1 spot by buying up smaller distributors. Performance Food closed on Friday at $37.63, or 23 times its recent earnings per share.</p>
        <p>* Midway Games, a maker of video games, is a slightly more speculative play, Mr. LaLoggia said. The stock has fallen 71 percent this year (closing on Friday at $7) as consumers, awaiting the latest technology from game console makers, have held off on buying new games. Sumner N. Redstone, the Viacom chairman, owns 28 percent of Midway and has been buying its shares in the open market. With the stock down, Mr. LaLoggia said, ''If Sumner has thought about buying this company out, there's never been a better chance to buy than now.''</p>
