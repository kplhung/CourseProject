        <p>THINKING about starting a coin collection? You probably already have. Just pull the change out of your pocket.</p>
        <p>Although it may seem pretentious to think that a handful of nickels, quarters and dimes qualifies as a collection, the actuality is that just about any set of coins does.</p>
        <p>And at one time or another just about anything has been considered a coin.</p>
        <p>There are glass coins from Saudi Arabia and wooden coins from American company towns, iron coins from China and wire coins from Africa. During the Civil War, Confederate postage stamps were encased in mica and metal, and they became coins. Bracelets, cowrie shells, giant stone rings, sculptures of dolphins and small iron spades have all been used as money by someone, somewhere, at some time. And though you might not think of shell beads or stone rings as coins, they did.</p>
        <p>So with all those choices, the first step is to decide what kind of coins to collect. Most people pick a particular type or denomination of coin from a specific place or period of history. It's more manageable and lots more fun.</p>
        <p>For example, the United States Mint is issuing quarters commemorating each of the 50 states at the rate of a new quarter every 10 weeks from 1999 and 2008. Ten coins, released according to the order in which the states joined the Union, will have been issued by the end of this year. Collecting these quarters is a cheap and interesting way to start a collection.</p>
        <p>This year, the mint began striking the Sacagawea dollar coin, and collecting coins just as they are issued is always a good time.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, you may want to begin collecting older coins. They're a little more difficult to find but well worth the effort. The first time you handle an older coin, just stop for a minute and let your imagination soar. Think of all the places it's been, all the hands that have touched it, the people who have spent it, the happiness it may have bought, the sadness and misery it may have caused. For a few dollars and even less, you can buy an ancient Greek or Roman coin - they're not uncommon - and your purchase includes not just a coin but a drama.</p>
        <p>Or you can spend a lot more, into the thousands of dollars, and buy what may be the most beautiful coin ever made, the 1907 double eagle sculptured by Augustus Saint-Gaudens, a $20 gold piece. And you can read about the struggles Teddy Roosevelt had in getting it made and how the design lasted only a short time before being changed.</p>
        <p>If you're ready to start, the first step is research. As a starting point, you may want to take a look at the Web sites of two groups devoted to coins and related collections, the American Numismatic Association (www.money.org) and the American Numismatic Society (www.amnumsoc.org). The society's building is at Broadway and 155th Street in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>You can also visit local coin stores, and browse through their collections. Try not to look at prices or decide what you can afford. Just look at coins. Wait for something to jup out at you. It's better to a have a small collection of coins you love than a larger collection you have no passion for.</p>
        <p>Once you have your first coin, the two of you should get acquainted. Coin shops and libraries usually carry books that explain the history and grading of coins. Look for a description of your coin and where it was minted.</p>
        <p>Now you're ready for the business side of coin collecting. Take a look at price guidelines in the books, but don't be disheartened. Just buy the highest-quality pieces you can afford, and your collection will eventually increase in value. But don't expect overnight results.</p>
        <p>Top-quality coins are those that look as if they just came from the mint. Although the grading of coins can be confusing, most United States coins sold in coin shops come with a certificate attesting to its grade from a reputable agent. The grading scale and a description on how each grade is determined is printed in most coin guides.</p>
        <p>One word of warning: once a collection is started, it's never finished. Most collectors are continually adding to their collections and upgrading the coins in them.</p>
