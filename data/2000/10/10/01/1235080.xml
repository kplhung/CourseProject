        <p>ABOUT the time Lisa and Michael Gallo began thinking seriously about starting a family, they also thought about moving to the suburbs from their rental apartment on the Upper West Side. Since both worked for securities firms in Manhattan, they were looking not only for an affordable house in an attractive community but also for a convenient commute.</p>
        <p>They found what they were looking for in Summit, N.J., an upscale residential city 25 miles from midtown Manhattan. That was four years ago, in October 1996 -- four months after New Jersey Transit inaugurated express service from Summit directly into Penn Station, instead of ending in Hoboken, where Manhattan-bound passengers had to change to PATH trains.</p>
        <p>That new service, Midtown Direct, lopped about 20 minutes off the previous 70-minute trip from Summit. The round-trip saving, 40 minutes a day, has made a big difference to the Gallos.</p>
        <p>''I don't think we would have moved here if it wasn't for Midtown Direct,'' said Mrs. Gallo, who commuted for two years before their twin sons arrived 16 months ago.</p>
        <p>The Gallos were more or less prepared for sticker shock when they decided to move to Summit, a six-square-mile community where a single-family house costs an average of $645,000 and some houses sell for seven figures, according to Lois Schneider Realtor.</p>
        <p>''We knew they weren't giving houses away in Summit before Midtown Direct arrived,'' Mrs. Gallo said, ''so we knew we were going to have to pay extra once the service came in here.''</p>
        <p>Lois Schneider, the head of the realty firm that bears her name, said it is hard to quantify the impact of improved transportation on real estate, especially in a booming housing market. But she estimated that Midtown Direct by itself had raised housing prices 15 to 20 percent. In a town that has long been a magnet for commuters to Manhattan, ''Midtown Direct increased the pool of prospective buyers,'' she said, ''and when that happens, it pushes prices up.''</p>
        <p>It is not only upscale suburban communities that experience rises in real estate prices when commuting is made more convenient. The same phenomenon is at work in Bayonne, N.J., a working-class city of more than 60,000, where New Jersey Transit's Hudson-Bergen Light Rail service began last April.</p>
        <p>Cathy and Kevin Ryan, a couple in their 30's from Bayonne, had been commuting by car and bus the past two years -- Mrs. Ryan to her job in Jersey City as a systems administrator at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, her husband to Weehawken, where he works as a tunnel and bridge agent for the Port Authority.</p>
        <p>''But I started taking the Light Rail this spring,'' Mrs. Ryan said, ''and I was so satisfied with the commute that we bought a two-family, four-story house on the east side, a block from the station.''</p>
        <p>Between New York Bay and Newark Bay, Bayonne is only the briefest of flights from Jersey City as the gull flies. But before the Light Rail service began, Mrs. Ryan's drive would sometimes take two hours each way, depending on traffic and weather. By train it now usually takes no more than 20 minutes. And when the rail service is extended to Weehawken, as intended, Mr. Ryan will switch from commuting by car to commuting by rail.</p>
        <p>In the six months since the opening of the nine-mile Light Rail between Bayonne and Jersey City, a line that eventually will be extended 11 more miles to Ridgefield, the price of houses in Bayonne has risen at least 10 percent, said Rosemary Sugrue, a broker with Century 21 McGeehan &amp; Pineiro in Bayonne.</p>
        <p>''In the 16 years I've been doing this, I hardly ever had anybody ask to buy on the east side of town, because the west side is near the bay and the Hudson County Park,'' Ms. Sugrue said. ''But since the light rail came in, we've gotten a lot of requests to buy on the east side,'' where the station is. ''I just sold a two-family house there for $240,000,'' she added.</p>
        <p>Although Mrs. Ryan declined to give the price of the house that she and her husband are in contract to buy, she said similar houses in the neighborhood sell in the $200,000-plus range. A friend three blocks away is asking $279,000 for a one-family house with a deck, pool and sauna, and Mrs. Ryan has little doubt she will get it. ''Property prices have gone up ever since the Light Rail came in,'' she said, ''because more people are wanting to live in Bayonne.''</p>
        <p>In the last two years, real estate prices have risen throughout New Jersey, said James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University. And while it is difficult to untangle precisely the impact of transportation on real estate, Dr. Hughes said that for a year or two before Midtown Direct started, price increases for real estate in the string of suburbs served by Midtown Direct outstripped those in New Jersey communities elsewhere.</p>
        <p>Eugene Spruck, chief economist for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, said the strong job growth in recent years in the 17-county New York City metropolitan region (190,300 new jobs last year alone) had obviously had a significant impact on real estate. ''Just think what it means for the real estate market with a lot of people with newfound wealth,'' he said. ''And shortly after Midtown Direct was initiated, I'd hear all this talk about how hot the real estate market was in those towns.''</p>
        <p>The same is true along the Hudson River waterfront, where, as in Bayonne, property values are rising along the Hudson-Bergen Light Rail route. And the pattern is likely to be repeated elsewhere in the metropolitan area where rail service is being upgraded.</p>
        <p>ONE such project is the Montclair Connection, which is expected to open next year and which will link the Montclair and Boonton lines into a single line and will for the first time provide direct service to midtown Manhattan. The new service is expected to attract an estimated 1,800 new riders a day, for a total of 2,600 riders a day traveling to New York in 2005.</p>
        <p>An even bigger transformation will begin in 2002, when the $448 million Secaucus Transfer rail station will start operating. It will link 11 of New Jersey's 12 commuter rail lines, allowing passengers to transfer to trains providing service directly to Penn Station. By 2010, the transfer point is expected to serve more than 16,000 riders a day, nearly 14,000 of whom are expected to be new to the railroad, many having switched from commuting by bus or car. By bypassing Hoboken, the commuters currently bound for mid-Manhattan from northern New Jersey and from Orange and Rockland counties in New York will save an estimated 30 minutes round trip.</p>
        <p>For many people, 30 fewer minutes spent commuting is a huge plus. And for many parents of young children, that extra time is golden. When Sean and Sue Leonard, whose daughter, Megan, is 3, decided to move from Westport, Conn., they looked in New Jersey. ''We specifically looked for places where I could commute directly into Manhattan without changing trains,'' said Mr. Leonard, a partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers. ''And it's close to my family in Philadelphia.''</p>
        <p>So this June the Leonards bought a four-bedroom house on half an acre in Chatham Township, one stop west of Summit. The commute takes about 45 minutes on the express train, Mr. Leonard said, and the local train takes a few minutes more. And he is in his midtown office after a 15 minute walk from Penn Station.</p>
        <p>''If you get on a good transportation route, you know you're going to pay a premium,'' Mr. Leonard said. ''And the closer in you get, the more expensive the real estate.''</p>
        <p>It is hardly surprising that commuters who can afford it willingly pay extra to avoid traffic jams and inconvenience. Maury N. Klein, a professor of history at the University of Rhode Island and the author of a two-volume account of the Union Pacific railroad, recalled that Jay Gould, the financier and railroad titan, commuted to Wall Street by yacht from Lyndhurst, his estate in Westchester County. ''He found it a very pleasant way to get to work,'' Professor Klein said. About that time, in the late 19th century, many people, including those of modest means, were looking for convenient ways to get to work.</p>
        <p>In ''Crabgrass Frontier: The Suburbanization of the United States'' (Oxford University Press, 1985), the historian Kenneth T. Jackson writes that it was the rail lines to Westchester County in the 19th century that enabled the nation's first large suburban area to develop. Around the turn of the century, ''Hundreds of trains from northern and eastern New Jersey poured into Hoboken every morning,'' he said, ''discharging passengers who immediately embarked on the 10-minute ferry ride to Manhattan.''</p>
        <p>Professor Klein added: ''In the 1880's, cities grew around streetcar lines instead of the railroads, making it easy to commute to the city but not having to live there. Then the advent of the auto created new kinds of suburbs, especially after World War II. And that allowed you to live away from the railroad but drive to the station to commute back to the city.''</p>
        <p>The attractiveness of convenient rail service continues. Consider the recent extension of Metro-North's upper Harlem Line from Dover Plains, N.Y, to the Tenmile River and Wassaic stations in Amenia, a town of about 6,000 in eastern Dutchess County, a 90-mile drive from Manhattan.</p>
        <p>In service only since July 9, and just under six miles in length, the extension has already had an impact on commuting patterns of a few people who make the two-hour-plus trip to Manhattan several times a week. It has shortened the drive time to the railroad station for these commuters and enables them to board (and park) at a station in Amenia, rather than jockey for a parking space at the Dover Plains station farther down the line. If the past is any guide, those improvements are almost certain to make a difference in real estate values in the area, including property in nearby northwestern Connecticut. ''Two years ago raw land surrounding Amenia sold for $6,000 an acre, but as the line was extended, it's now $10,000,'' said Elyse Harney, who owns Elyse Harney Real Estate in Salisbury, a Connecticut town 15 to 20 minutes from the Wassaic railroad station.</p>
        <p>Even with its orchards, dairy farms and other wide open spaces, eastern Dutchess County's population has been growing slowly but steadily almost since 1984. That year, Metro-North completed its $75 million electrification of the railroad between North White Plains, in Westchester County, and Brewster, in Putnam County.</p>
        <p>Metro-North officials said recently that they had no plans to extend the Harlem Line beyond Amenia (which, incidentally, had passenger train service for decades until 1972, when the troubled Penn Central abruptly pulled the plug).</p>
        <p>But Arlene Iuliano, the Amenia town supervisor, is not convinced. ''That's what they used to say about Amenia,'' she said. ''It may take 10 or 20 years before they continue north, but they will.''</p>
        <p>TO build ridership, Metro-North made a decision not to stint on service. ''So we're basically running the same number of trains into and out of Amenia that we run between Dover Plains and Grand Central,'' said Margaret Anders, a Metro-North spokeswoman. That means four trains to Manhattan during peak hours each weekday and eight off-peak trains, the first train departing at 5:13 a.m., the last at 10:33 p.m. There are 13 weekday trains from Manhattan to Wassaic. The commute takes about 2 hours and 15 minutes each way.</p>
        <p>Since service started at the Wassaic and Tenmile stations, Ms. Anders said, ridership has averaged 167 passengers each weekday. That, of course, is only a tiny fraction of the total 24.3 million Harlem Line passengers that Metro-North projects for this year. But ridership on the upper Harlem Line is among the fastest growing throughout the Metro-North system.</p>
        <p>A. J. Hayes, an Amenia realtor since 1971, said the Wassaic station's parking lot has already attracted many cars from neighboring Connecticut and Massachusetts. And an economic impact study of the Wassaic and Amenia areas, released in September 1999, forecast that residential real estate values in the region will increase over time as ridership to and from Wassaic increases.</p>
        <p>The study forecast 12 percent annual growth rate in passengers using the Wassaic station, adding that ''it is only a matter of time before the sites near the train terminus are developed.'' A study of real estate by Regina Armstrong for the New York Regional Plan Association projected that the extension of the railroad to Wassaic would eventually result in a 64 percent increase in the number of residences within the hamlet of Wassaic and 17 percent outside of the hamlet.</p>
        <p>''We expect the train to Wassaic to bring in tourism dollars and raise property values,'' said Kathleen Schibanoff, executive director of the Harlem Valley Partnership, an economic and regional planning group. ''And we expect it to bring a big migration of people who said they never would have considered a long commute, but change their minds when they have kids and think more about the quality of life.''</p>
        <p>Similar impulses were probably involved in 1980 to 1990, when there was a 30 percent increase in ridership from Dutchess County to White Plains, according to the economic survey, and a 108 percent increase in commuting to Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hayes, the realtor in Amenia, said that the real estate business had been slow in the area for years. ''And since the railroad just started up, it's still a little early for customers to be lined up at the door wanting to buy,'' he said. ''But the last six to eight months, real estate activity has really jumped up.''</p>
        <p>For the real estate business to break out of its slump and stay there, Wassaic and Amenia would need to attract more people and keep them. And keeping them, realtors say, especially those from big cities, requires a certain degree of patience and understanding on the part of longtime residents and newcomers alike.</p>
        <p>Richard and Carol Papper of Manhattan, for example, bought a three-bedroom Victorian farmhouse in Salisbury, Conn., last December and consider the railroad a bonus. But one night while Mrs. Papper and the children were visiting her family out of town, Mr. Papper took the train to Wassaic, then a shuttle bus that dropped him off at a corner in Millerton, N.Y., closer to home.</p>
        <p>But at that hour, about 8 p.m., he was unable to find a taxi at the station or at the spot the shuttle bus dropped him off. So he telephoned John Harney, the son of Elyse Harney, their realtor, to ask what to do. Mr. Harney picked Mr. Papper up and drove him home.</p>
        <p>''So here was this New York boy who thought you could hail a taxi in the country like you can in New York,'' Mrs. Papper said, still amused by her husband's predicament, ''and instead he was stranded less than 20 minutes from home.''</p>
