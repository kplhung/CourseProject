        <p>LUCKY GOLD, who makes 30 or more business trips a year, says that being able to work out using a treadmill and free weights while on the road is crucial to his well-being.</p>
        <p>So when Mr. Gold's job as senior vice president for business development at the Marvin Group, an aerospace company in Inglewood, Calif., takes him to Boston, as it does at least once a month, he doesn't race out of Logan International Airport the minute he arrives.

Sometimes he even catches an earlier flight than necessary, to allow time for exercise before his meetings in the city.</p>

        <p>LUCKY GOLD, who makes 30 or more business trips a year, says that being able to work out using a treadmill and free weights while on the road is crucial to his well-being.</p>
        <p>So when Mr. Gold's job as senior vice president for business development at the Marvin Group, an aerospace company in Inglewood, Calif., takes him to Boston, as it does at least once a month, he doesn't race out of Logan International Airport the minute he arrives. Instead, he stops for an hour or so at a health club on the airport grounds, at the Hilton Boston Logan Airport hotel. Sometimes he even catches an earlier flight than necessary, to allow time for exercise before his meetings in the city.</p>
        <p>''Having this facility right at the airport is so handy,'' Mr. Gold said. ''Working out helps me stay mentally fit and better prepared for any meeting I'm going to, or any presentation that I'm making. And if I wind up getting delayed at the airport for any period of time, then the health club becomes even more important.''</p>
        <p>As the air travel system becomes ever more congested and prone to delays, airports are adding ground services to meet the needs of business travelers or to simply help them pass the extra time. These include more stores and restaurants, but also creature comforts like gyms and health clubs. Some, like the one that Mr. Gold frequents in Boston, are in airport hotels; others are in the terminal itself or in freestanding facilities on airport property.</p>
        <p>''Nobody looks forward to a three-  or four-hour layover, but it is a major stress reliever for business travelers to do a little shopping or get a quick workout while they're waiting at the airport,'' said Randy Petersen, publisher of Inside Flyer, a magazine for frequent travelers. Mr. Petersen himself expects to spend 200 days on the road this year for business.</p>
        <p>Airlines depend on business travelers -- who fly more often and pay much higher fares than tourists -- for 46 percent of their revenue, according to the National Business Travel Association, which represents corporate travel managers. Airport authorities and airlines alike have an economic stake in making airports as appealing as possible to  these road warriors.</p>
        <p>Of course, many harried business travelers, when faced with a long delay or layover, are not looking for any distractions, just a quiet spot to catch up on work or reading. ''There are those times when I just want to return a few calls and look over some materials before a meeting while waiting at the airport,'' said Ira Birns, treasurer of Arrow Electronics, a components distributor in Melville, N.Y., who travels about 25 times a year for his job.</p>
        <p>But for those who do want a break from the laptop and the cell phone, a growing number of airports are helping to soothe frazzled nerves by offering on-site gyms,  like the Airport Fitness Center at Pittsburgh International Airport. Mark Knight, regional director of BAA USA, which operates shopping and other concessions at the airport, said the center included exercise equipment, showers and sauna, and had workout clothing available for sale or rent. A single day's visit costs $9.99; a one-year membership is $420.</p>
        <p>In March, McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas added a branch of the 24-Hour Fitness health club chain, the chain's first at an airport. The club offers aerobics classes in addition to the usual exercise facilities, and employs a sports nutritionist who will pack healthy snacks for business travelers to take along on flights.</p>
        <p>Airport hotels are also trying to tap into the growing pool of the stranded, by marketing their facilities to airport passengers beyond their regular guests. Like its sister hotel in Boston, the Hilton Chicago O'Hare Airport regularly distributes fliers at information booths throughout the airport encouraging business travelers to buy $10 daily passes to its health club, which includes a pool, whirlpool, exercise machines, sauna and showers, according to the club's manager, Steven Andos. Tanning beds and a personal trainer are also available.</p>
        <p>About 100 of the 800 people who use the health club on a typical day are not hotel guests, Mr. Andos said, and roughly 15 percent of the 500 regular members are travelers who pass through O'Hare regularly without staying at the hotel. The club at the Boston hotel, which charges $9 to $15 for a day, gets about 20 percent of its traffic from nonguests.</p>
        <p>''Some of these people don't even mind that much being in the airport for a few hours between flights, since they know they can have a good workout, take a shower and leave feeling refreshed,'' Mr. Andos said.</p>
        <p>A chance to work up a sweat is not the only amenity that airports, big and small, are offering to between-planes travelers. T. F. Green Airport in Providence, R.I., has just 22 gates in its terminal, but passengers can get a 15-minute massage there for $15. Last month, the airport added express manicure and pedicure service.</p>
        <p>The massage service at Nashville International Airport proved a godsend for Jerry Daly, who owns Daly Gray, a public relations firm in Herndon, Va., and who threw out his back on a recent trip.</p>
        <p>''Seeing those massage chairs was like finding an oasis in the desert,'' said Mr. Daly, who paid $15 for a 15-minute massage just before heading home from a business trip. ''I was in so much pain, and this made me feel somewhat better. This is a great service to have at an airport.''</p>
        <p>Other airports, like Orlando International, have in-terminal salons where travelers  can get haircuts, massages or manicures.</p>
        <p>And the number and range of retail stores and restaurants in airports growing, too: In the Airmall at Pittsburgh International, many of the 105 stores are specifically aimed at business travelers, including a Staples office products outlet. ''As many as 10 percent of business travelers we've surveyed have said that they will purposely try to connect through Pittsburgh rather than somewhere else, just to use our shops and services,'' Mr. Knight said.</p>
        <p>For what ails some travelers, though, exercise or pampering or shopping may not be enough. Kennedy International in New York, for example, provides services for which there is no substitute. The airport's chapel offers a setting for quiet prayer and a chance to speak with a priest, minister or rabbi. And when the pain gets really bad, there is an on-site emergency dentist.</p>
        <p>Finding Treadmills In the Terminals</p>
        <p>IT is not always easy to know in advance if an airport you will be visiting offers a health club or other services.</p>
        <p>Most airports have Web sites, but they vary greatly in content and organization; some offer extensive details about services and concessions, while others offer little or none. Facilities at airport hotels are generally not included on airport Web sites, though many hotels have their own sites.</p>
        <p>A good source is the airport's information desk, which generally can be reached by telephone, or its administration office. Travel agents and corporate travel planners may also be familiar with specific airports; many customer-service representatives of airlines can answer questions about their hub airports, and have the advantage of being reachable most hours of the day.</p>
