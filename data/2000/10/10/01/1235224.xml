        <p>Despite eliminating its 4 percent sales tax on clothing under $110, sales tax revenues in Suffolk County have actually increased 8.2 percent so far this year, the county budget director announced last week.</p>
        <p>''We had expected to lose almost $30 million through the end of this year, but instead we're up about $31 million over last year,'' said Kenneth P. Weiss, the budget director. ''We don't know why. The state doesn't analyze the figures until next year and it's going to take some time to figure it out.''</p>
        <p>Nassau's figures were not immediately available, but Pearl Kamer, chief economist for the Long Island Association, said she believed they were only slightly below Suffolk's. Because of budget problems, Nassau officials kept the county's 4 percent sales tax on clothing.</p>
        <p>Dr. Kamer said the rosy sales figures in both counties were connected to the Island's strong economy.</p>
        <p>''One of the things that has kept the Long Island economy strong has been consumer spending,'' she said. ''Because of full employment in both counties -- in fact, there are labor shortage across the board -- consumers have money to spend and are confident that the economic prosperity will continue for some time. That spells growing sales tax revenues for both counties.''</p>
        <p>When the sales tax on clothing was eliminated in Suffolk, there was some evidence of Nassau residents going to Suffolk to shop. But Thomas Conoscenti, a Long Island regional economist in Nesconset, said most people had gone back to their old buying habits.</p>
        <p>''There was some shifting back and forth,'' he said, ''but when all is said and done, there has not been any significant change. People are creatures of habit and when it comes to buying, you get accustomed to shopping in a particular place. People don't shift their buying patterns because of a 4 percent tax.''</p>
