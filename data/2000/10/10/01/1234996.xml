        <p>Westin Hotels and Resorts' latest property is made for mixing business and pleasure. The Westin Stonebriar Resort in Frisco, Tex., which opened Sept. 5 just north of Dallas, is what the company calls an ''urban resort,'' offering modern business facilities and country club amenities -- most notably a golf course by the designer Tom Fazio, scheduled to open Nov. 1.</p>
        <p>The hotel, close to a number of major corporate headquarters, offers 11 meeting rooms and a ballroom with fiber optic wiring and T1 Internet connections. Besides golf, recreation options include a 200-foot lagoon-style pool, a fitness center and a day spa.</p>

        <p>Westin Hotels and Resorts' latest property is made for mixing business and pleasure. The Westin Stonebriar Resort in Frisco, Tex., which opened Sept. 5 just north of Dallas, is what the company calls an ''urban resort,'' offering modern business facilities and country club amenities -- most notably a golf course by the designer Tom Fazio, scheduled to open Nov. 1.</p>
        <p>The hotel, close to a number of major corporate headquarters, offers 11 meeting rooms and a ballroom with fiber optic wiring and T1 Internet connections. Besides golf, recreation options include a 200-foot lagoon-style pool, a fitness center and a day spa.</p>
        <p>The 300 rooms have high-speed Internet access, mini-refrigerators and balconies.</p>
        <p>The new golf course, the Stonebriar Fazio, will be shared with the private Stonebriar Country Club, which has a separate clubhouse and an existing course (not open to resort guests). The Fazio course measures  7,001 yards from the championship tees and is built around two lakes with native-grass border areas.</p>
        <p>The Westin Stonebriar, at Highway 121 and Legacy Drive in Frisco, (800) 937-8461, fax (972) 668-8100, is about 30 minutes from downtown Dallas. Until the end of the year, a standard room will cost $165 a night; after that, the rate will be $295. Golf packages are available.</p>
