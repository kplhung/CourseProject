        <p>SLOBODAN MILOSEVIC'S gift was an ability to persuade Serbs that someone was out to get them -- and that much of the world was in on the plot.</p>
        <p>For more than a decade, he presided over an ever-shrinking state that lost four consecutive wars, became an international pariah and chased away its educated elite. Still, even as they descended into poverty, Serbs believed Mr. Milosevic was defending their honor against enemies who included Islamic fundamentalists, the pope and President Clinton. The Serb leader, as a result, won elections that were more or less fair.</p>
        <p>Last week, though, the well of nationalist delusion ran dry.</p>
        <p>A majority of voters decided that Mr. Milosevic himself was dishonoring Serbia, according to an opposition vote count backed by the United States and the European Union. Even the official vote count, managed by his loyalists, conceded that more Serbs (though just short of 50 percent) were against him than were for him. That left only the question of how long he could survive the contempt of a proud people who knew that he tried to steal the election, or how long he could keep the backing of a long-resentful army that has borne the brunt of his lost wars.</p>
        <p>Yet, whatever the outcome of the struggle to force him to accept electoral defeat, one thing was clear: the logic of Mr. Milosevic's hold on the people of Serbia had been shattered. Much of the world had already taken to calling Mr. Milosevic a dictator, based on his manipulation of the apparatus of power. But many Serbs didn't see it that way, since he didn't terrorize them and could win elections based on the fiction that he was protecting them from the sea of enemies.</p>
        <p>Now, by doctoring the results of last Sunday's election, refusing to accept defeat and demanding a second round of voting, the populist demagogue revealed himself to his countrymen as a tyrant hiding behind the trappings of democracy.</p>
        <p>WHAT was so different about this election?</p>
        <p>For the first time, Mr. Milosevic did not have a handy aggressive nationalist neighbor he could demonize, and even lead Serbs to war against, as a diversion from their own troubles. And the opposition movement inside Serbia, after years of egotistical infighting, had finally figured out how to pull together.</p>
        <p>Mr. Milosevic's loss of legitimacy in Serbia is difficult to understand without a quick look back at how he cemented his populist base in the first place. As Communism came crashing down in Eastern Europe in the late 1980's, Mr. Milosevic, a relatively unknown party functionary, stumbled upon a survival strategy.</p>
        <p>During a spring visit in 1987 to the Serbian province of Kosovo, where Serbs had been complaining of mistreatment at the hands of Kosovar Albanians, he broke with a party policy that suppressed nationalistic conflicts. Ignoring the explosive impact of his behavior in a federal state of six republics, three religions and two alphabets, he promised Serbs that they would come first, that no one would mistreat them again.</p>
        <p>During 1989, a year in which all of Eastern Europe's other Communist leaders were being tossed out of office, jailed or shot, Mr. Milosevic was riding high as Serbia's president. Weeping Serbian women kissed his official photograph at political rallies as his police stripped Albanians in Kosovo of political rights they had been guaranteed in Tito's Yugoslavia.</p>
        <p>Mr. Milosevic plugged into long-simmering resentments among Serbs, who felt that their status as Yugoslavia's largest ethnic group had never been shown proper respect. Many Serbs, too, shared an abiding feeling of victimization, dating back through 500 years of Ottoman rule and punctuated by their murderous treatment during World War II by Nazis and Croat fascists.</p>
        <p>Mr. Milosevic and the Serbs, however, were not simply remembering or inventing enemies. The splintering of Yugoslavia in the early 1990's left about two million Serbs outside Serbia, making them, in effect, minorities in foreign countries.</p>
        <p>In Croatia, Serbs were bullied, fired from state jobs and sometimes killed. The late Croatian president Franjo Tudjman, a puffed-up nationalist eager to expand the borders of his new country, was made to order for Mr. Milosevic. The Croat's witless posturing left the Serbs itching for war. As in all of Mr. Milosevic's wars, which started off strong and ended in ignominious Serb retreat, Mr. Tudjman's side ended up winning.</p>
        <p>When there was little to inflame the Serb paranoia that Mr. Milosevic needed to remain popular, his regime used state television and radio to manufacture it. Belgrade television showcased terribly mutilated bodies during the Bosnian war, which newscasters described as Serbs butchered by Muslims. The Serb siege of Sarajevo was explained on Belgrade radio as Muslims laying siege to themselves, to win sympathy from the West.</p>
        <p>Last year's war in Kosovo weakened but did not break the cycle of paranoia. With NATO aircraft bombing Belgrade, Milosevic could claim -- and Serbs could see, hear and feel -- that he had the stomach to take on the world to retain Kosovo, which many Christian Orthodox Serbs regard as the cradle of their religion.</p>
        <p>He lost Kosovo, of course, but in the eyes of many Serbs he remained a patriot. There is a noble lost-cause tradition in Serbia, especially regarding Kosovo. It dates to Serbia's martyred Prince Lazar, who, before dying in a lost battle against the Turks for Kosovo in 1389, said, ''It is better to die in battle than to live in shame.''</p>
        <p>Well before he lost Kosovo, Mr. Milosevic was not particularly popular in Serbia. Still, he could say there was no alternative, having painted his internal opponents as allies of Serbia's enemies and, therefore, traitors. His indictment as a war criminal played into that, striking many Serbs as mere American propaganda.</p>
        <p>In the past year, though, Mr. Milosevic ran out of the headstrong enemies from Yugoslavia's other ethnic groups who had been so helpful in stirring up Serb blood and securing his grip on power. And his internal opponents saw the wisdom of not appearing to side with, or take support from, major powers like the United States that had been Serbia's external enemies.</p>
        <p>IN Montenegro, the last Yugoslav republic still joined with Serbia in a federal government, President Milo Djukanovic refused to be drawn into loose-lipped talk of war. Instead, he and his government inched away from Belgrade's embrace in a way that did not give Mr. Milosevic a marketable pretext for chaos. It was the first time that a much-predicted war between Serbia and a former Yugoslav republic failed to occur.</p>
        <p>Inside Serbia, too, the opposition was learning how to play Mr. Milosevic's game. It had seemed for years that the opposition was hopeless. A personal rivalry between two of its leaders sabotaged the momentum gained in three months of opposition rallies in 1996-97.  After the war in Kosovo, when discontent over poverty was running high, the Milosevic regime succeeded in weakening a key opposition leader, Zoran Djindjic. It noted on state television that he had fled Serbia and dined with the enemy during the war.</p>
        <p>This year, though, most opposition leaders swallowed their egos and rallied behind Vojislav Kostunica, a cautious constitutional lawyer with impeccable patriotic credentials. Mr. Kostunica inoculated himself against charges that he was a puppet of the West by vowing that, if elected, he would not allow Mr. Milosevic to be taken away for a war-crimes trial in The Hague.</p>
        <p>Shortly after Mr. Milosevic rose to power in the late 1980's, a parable began to circulate in Belgrade. In it, he is a wild-eyed hijacker who has taken over an airplane called Yugoslavia and is throwing passengers out the window one by one. Those left on board realize to their horror that the hijacker has no plan for landing the plane. For many years, the story had no ending.</p>
        <p>Last week, though, the fuel supply for Mr. Milosevic's violent and aimless journey -- the populist backing of his people -- was finally turned off. The parable appears over, with Serbia and the world waiting for the dictator to crash.</p>
