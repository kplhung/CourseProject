        <p>THE contrast is as subtle as a blind-side tackle. When professional football sweeps across the television sets of America every Sunday afternoon during fall and winter, millions of viewers enter a world of not only yards and points but also bucks and megabucks.</p>
        <p>Millions of dollars are charged for 30 seconds of advertising during the Super Bowl. Players' salaries often climb into the same range. A Kurt Warner goes from clerking in a grocery story in Iowa in 1995 to stardom with the world champion St. Louis Rams and a six-year, $47-million contract five years later. The most expensive medical attention is on standby. The price of a good seat to a game is a day's salary for many.</p>
        <p>But in this town and many others a few football fields away from those television sets on those same Sundays can be found men of similar age and similar love of the game playing in a totally different financial league. The players are not paid; they pay for the privilege of playing. Gate receipts are whatever a passing of the hat produces. Advertisers, when they can be found, contribute dollars in hundreds, not hundreds of thousands. Medical insurance is too expensive to consider.</p>
        <p>It is the world of semiprofessional football.</p>
        <p>It is the world of financial shoestrings.</p>
        <p>''There have been games,'' Ken Esehak said, ''when I'm not sure we'll get to play because we don't have the $200 to pay the officials. The players have had to dip into their own wallets while suiting up.''</p>
        <p>Esehak, 52, is the coach, general manager, business manager and guiding force behind the Mount Vernon Steelers of the United Football League. He spends more time worrying about finances than off-tackle traps, he said, because he doesn't have a choice.</p>
        <p>On their 10-game league schedule, the Steelers play five home games in Memorial Field here, hard by the Hutchison River Parkway.</p>
        <p>''It costs $275 to rent the field this season,'' Esehak said, ''and the city came way down to that figure.''</p>
        <p>A lawyer by trade, Esehak can rattle off figures like an accountant.</p>
        <p>''To run the team on a tight, tight budget costs $10,000 a season at the very least,'' he said. ''We tried charging admission to the games, but a lot of the people couldn't afford anything, so we just let them in. Now we pass the hat. On a good day -- a very good day -- we collect maybe $150.</p>
        <p>''We also charge the players a registration fee of $200 a season, but some can't afford the full amount. And then there are advertisers, when you can find them.''</p>
        <p>HSBC Bank and the Yonkers law firm of Fitzgerald &amp; Fitzgerald have helped frequently.</p>
        <p>''Put that against travel costs, stadium costs, game officials, league fees, replacing and repairing home and away uniforms,'' Esehak added. ''Painting the helmets at the start of the season is a $500 item. Most years I end up going into my own pocket.''</p>
        <p>Like the United Football League, the Steelers are in their sixth season. They have gone to the division championship game once and are 4-1 and headed for the playoffs this season despite their financial disadvantage.</p>
        <p>''Revenue is a little easier for some teams,'' Esehak said. ''I've had kids who finished college but wanted to continue back off when told they have to pay for their own shoulder pads, helmet and shoes in addition to the registration fee. So we don't always get the best players.''</p>
        <p>Up county, the division rival Westchester Chiefs, stationed in Peekskill, have things a little easier, but not much. This season John O'Brien, who organized the Chiefs in 1993, then joined the U.F.L. when it formed, has turned most team duties over to his son Sean, the team's tight end. ''It's always a struggle,'' said the father, who gets good community support in Peekskill. ''On a good year we'll raise maybe $4,000 or $5,000 above our needs. On a bad year, we'll have maybe $20 at the end of the season.''</p>
        <p>So, why? Why worry about money all the time? Why play for the privilege of being black and blue on Monday?</p>
        <p>Esehak, a former semipro, has the answer. ''The league has a slogan: 'For the love of the game.'</p>
        <p>''With all the headaches, there is fun involved. We have players who don't want to give the game up. They're willing to pay, and to travel long distances, just to play football.''</p>
        <p>Pete Bruseo and Jeff Guervara are offensive linemen who played their high school ball in distant Dover, N.J., and still travel from there to Mount Vernon for games and twice-a-week practices. ''We also have players coming from New Haven, Suffolk County and the Delaware Water Gap,'' Esehak said. ''Our kicker, Kevin Bovan, is 42 and still travels from Old Bridge, N.J.''</p>
        <p>The Steelers have a standout quarterback in Dino Passariello, who threw for four touchdowns last Sunday. A former star at Sleepy Hollow High who now works in sales for a Manhattan investment concern, he is 37 and still playing after shedding retirement in 1997. At 5-foot-8 and 165 pounds, he looks dwarfed and vulnerable next to his fellow players. ''I've been playing since I was 8 and something always hurts,'' he said with a shrug. ''For a while I tried flag football, but I got just as beat up in that, so I might as well do what I really love.</p>
        <p>''Besides, guys I work with get more hurt skiing than I do playing football.''</p>
        <p>His wife, Carol, agreed. ''He gets such a kick out of it,'' she said. ''I have to say it makes him a better husband.''</p>
        <p>It does not make her a better spectator.  ''I'm sort of barred from the games,'' she said. ''I want to go fight when I see him get hit.''</p>
        <p>Fighting is not part of semipro football as practiced in the United Football League. Its commissioner, Steven Ellis, delivers the message clearly to the 15 teams in two divisions (the New York metropolitan region and the region around Washington).</p>
        <p>''We've had to clean up an image,'' said Ellis, 35, three years a semipro himself. ''People used to think beer leagues and brawls when they thought semipro. It's been a six-year effort, but we've gotten to the point where we are taking teams to the Caribbean for exhibitions.</p>
        <p>''Our league is about grown men living a dream and college-eligible kids improving their skills. It's against the by-laws to pay a player, and all teams struggle to raise funds.''</p>
        <p>Even the National Footbal League to which the most talented aspire is a roadblock. Its games keep potential fans at home.</p>
        <p>Esehak said: ''We get maybe 400, 500 fans a game on a good Sunday afternoon. Could we do better on a night without N.F.L. games? Sure, but at night it would be $1,400 for lights alone plus $850 to rent the field.''</p>
        <p>Next year, Mount Vernon will charge the Steelers a $750 rental on a Sunday afternoon. ''No way we can afford that,'' Esehak said.</p>
        <p>Actually, the city's commissioner of recreation, Yuhanna Edwards, gave the Steelers a year's grace. ''We had just implemented the new rates so we waived them till next year,'' Edwards said.</p>
        <p>Edwards wants the Steelers in his town. ''Absolutely,'' he said. ''I'm associated with Pop Warner football, and the Steelers players have been great with the youngsters. It's great for them to have a mentorship and, once they stop playing in high school, semipro ball gives them a place to play.''</p>
        <p>Next season's finances are next season's worry for Esehak. ''We live week to week,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Besides, there's a game to be won against the unbeaten Bronx Bandits here today.</p>
        <p>Avoiding the Risk of Hurt Hands, but Playing Tough</p>
        <p>THE macho cult of football demands that one play with injuries. Tim Lyons of Irvington, a defensive tackle with the Mount Vernon Steelers, is as tough as his sport demands. But he has missed practices and games this season not for an injury but for fear of a relatively minor injury.</p>
        <p>''I didn't want to hurt my fingers,'' the 6-foot-2, 265-pounder said.</p>
        <p>Lyons, 35, is a professional organist. He can be found playing every Sunday morning at the St. Barnabas Episcopal Church in Ardsley-on-Hudson. On fall days, he normally hustles out after services, puts on his uniform and plays football -- ''Just because I really like the sport.''</p>
        <p>But for the two weeks before Sunday, July 30, he avoided preseason scrimmaging with the Steelers. ''That's because I was playing at St. John the Divine that day,'' he said of the huge cathedral in Manhattan's Morningside Heights section. ''Playing there is my Super Bowl.''</p>
        <p>St. John, the tackle-organist said, is the largest cathedral in the world -- ''two football fields long,'' Lyons said.</p>
        <p>''And the organ,'' he continued, ''is one of the greatest in the world and one of the largest. It's phenomenal. It's so reverberant in that space.''</p>
        <p>Being invited to play there is an honor. ''I graduated from Columbia and I was always interested in music, so I heard that organ all through college,'' Lyons said. ''I had started playing an organ when I was 14.</p>
        <p>''I first applied to play there in 1987. That's why I couldn't risk hurting my fingers.''</p>
        <p>Lyons, who has missed a couple of other games because of recitals, even has his ''Super Bowl'' trophy. The CD of his performance at St. John the Divine was released last month.</p>
