        <p>The sun's atmosphere, called the corona, is hundreds of times hotter than its surface, and astronomers have been trying to figure out why for more than 50 years. They have long suspected that powerful magnetic fields sprouting from the solar surface are involved. By taking the sharpest pictures ever of gases clinging to those fields, a NASA satellite has tightened that connection. The pictures show what amount to pillars of fire at the base of the field lines. But scientists still haven't figured out what sets off the fires.</p>
