        <p>Editorial on moral urgency of debt relief for world's poorest nations</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Debt relief for the world's poorest nations is an idea with moral urgency and strong bipartisan support. People in these countries, most of which are in Africa, suffer needlessly because their governments use 40 percent or more of their national budgets for interest on a foreign debt that will never be repaid. This leaves little for pressing social needs, including improved health care, and better schools and universities. The Clinton administration and most members of Congress back a program to forgive the debts of impoverished nations that can show they have sensible economic policies and will use the money to help their poor citizens. Uganda has used its debt relief to reduce school fees. Mozambique is planning to stock health clinics with badly needed medicines.</p>
        <p>But the very popularity of debt relief is allowing a few in Congress to hold the money hostage, using it as a bargaining chip to win financing for other programs. The administration asked for $435 million, which would write down the debt countries owe the United States and contribute to retiring debt held by regional development banks. The House has approved only $225 million, and the Senate an embarrassing $75 million. Congressional assent is also needed for a plan to let the International Monetary Fund retire debts it holds by using investment income from the sale of its gold reserves. The plan is being blocked by Senator Phil Gramm of Texas.</p>

        <p>But the very popularity of debt relief is allowing a few in Congress to hold the money hostage, using it as a bargaining chip to win financing for other programs.

        <p>The debt-relief package is a bargain for the United States, which will have to pay only 4 percent of the wealthy nations' total, or $920 million over four years. Each dollar Washington contributes, moreover, produces $20 in debt relief. If Washington does not meet its commitment, the whole package may unravel, as other wealthy nations will be reluctant to act. Debt relief works -- for example, primary school attendance nearly doubled in Uganda after the country dropped its school fees. While relief has been too limited so far, the program is scheduled to reach 10 more African and Latin American nations this year. More countries may qualify in the years ahead. Congress should not block or shortchange this vital help for the world's poorest.</p>
