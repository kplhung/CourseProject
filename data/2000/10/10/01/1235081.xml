        <p>WHEN 88-year-old Nicholas Pogany and his wife, Margaret, 77, gathered recently with their three children, six grandchildren and other family members for the traditional Jewish wedding of their oldest grandchild, it was more than an ancestral ritual. It was a celebration of an American family that almost never was.</p>
        <p>For eight decades, Mr. Pogany had a remarkable tale to tell. But until seven years ago much of it had remained hidden -- even from his children. Only when his twin, George, died in 1993, were the family secrets, demons and triumphs set free.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pogany and his brother were Hungarian Jews, born in 1912. But in the hopes of making a better life, the family converted to Catholicism. Nicholas later chose to return to his Jewish roots, only to spend the final months of World War II at the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, while George, who had become a Catholic priest, spent the war in an Italian monastery.</p>
        <p>A haunting new book by Eugene Pogany, the son of Nicholas Pogany, ''In My Brother's Image,'' (Viking, $25.95) unlocks the family's tale. Eugene, a psychologist in Boston, delved deeply into his subjects, resulting in his own spiritual journey.</p>
        <p>Although Nicholas has lost most of his eyesight and the spry stride of youth, his mind remains as sharp as it was when he was a child in Budapest. He readily remembers dates, names and details that most people would have forgotten long ago. Perhaps it is because he internalized his story, allowing it to simmer for decades, that it has become so distinct. Now when he speaks of it, the floodgates open.</p>
        <p>Nicholas's father, Bela, a secular Jew, converted to gain employment as a veterinarian in prewar Hungary when anti-Semitism was rife. Nicholas' mother, Gabriella, became a Catholic, so devout that she asked to be taken to morning Mass by her captors as she was about to be deported. She died, clutching a crucifix, in Auschwitz.</p>
        <p>''When some stupid person says that the Holocaust never happened,'' said Nicholas, ''I say, 'Then where is my mother?' ''</p>
        <p>More than 50 years later, he is still haunted by her death, one that he said proves that ''no matter what you believe in, when you are born a Jew, you are always a Jew.''</p>
        <p>Today, in his two-bedroom condominium in Edison, artwork covers the walls, shelves are filled with books and the apartment is occupied with assorted Judaica. Most noticeably, there are newer photographs of his grandchildren and antiquated photos of family members who vividly inhabit the pages of ''In My Brother's Image.''</p>
        <p>Growing up in Budapest, and then later as converted Catholics in rural Hungary, the well-educated and highly cultured brothers were surrounded by poverty -- especially the poverty of the Hungarian spirit, which was drowning in fear and prejudice.</p>
        <p>Nicholas and George shared more than their indistinguishable appearance; they were both good Christians. At one point, Nicholas thought about joining the priesthood. ''But I started liking girls,'' he said in a recent interview, with a wistful chuckle. It was George who became the priest.</p>
        <p>In 1939, George suffered from kidney stones, and his ecclesiastical administrator, possibly pleased to be rid of the convert priest, suggested he go to Italy for a cure. Fortuitously, it was a trip that would save his life -- but one that would also create a great chasm between the two brothers.</p>
        <p>''In his eyes I was an apostate, and he never forgave me,'' said Nicholas. ''I know very well that way of thinking. Remember, I was a good Catholic.''</p>
        <p>Nicholas, in turn, resented George because he said his brother was indifferent to the suffering the Jews endured. ''He never asked one question,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In Italy, the Rev. George Pogany became the secretary to the legendary Padre Pio, a monk regarded by many Catholics as a saint, while in Hungary, Nicholas served time in a forced-labor battalion. In 1944, Nicholas married Margaret Deutsch, a spirited Jewish woman a decade his junior. Margaret, known as Muci, was born in the United States, and her father died while her mother, Elza, was pregnant with her. The young mother and daughter returned home to their family.</p>
        <p>The couple's wedding night was spent in their apartment's basement during a bombing raid. Months later, Nicholas defected to join his wife, who was being deported to Bergen-Belsen in Germany, but they never met up. Muci barely survived the concentration camp, and later a slave labor factory in Dresden. Her head shaven, she wasted to 63 pounds, was covered with sores and contracted tuberculosis.</p>
        <p>After they were both liberated -- and not knowing whether the other was alive -- Nicholas tracked her down to a sanitarium. ''No words can describe the feeling,'' he said. The two renewed a vow that Muci made in the concentration camp. ''I said that I will bring Jewish children into the world,'' she recalled. And they did -- Peter, Eugene and Ellen.</p>
        <p>''It is a miracle,'' Nicholas said of his children, as Muci served up pot roast and Hungarian pastries. Talking about her grandson Brett's wedding and pointing to family photographs, the matriarch added, ''This is why I was fighting for my life.''</p>
        <p>In 1956, 17 years after they had last seen each other, George left Italy to reunite with Nicholas, who had moved to the United States. In Nicholas's East Orange apartment, the reunion conversation was tense, with each thinking the other a traitor.</p>
        <p>George became the parish priest at St. Mary's Church in downtown Newark, while Nicholas and Margaret raised their children in a Jewish household. The anger and sense of betrayal boiled beneath the surface -- though the brothers renewed their family ties, attending bar mitzvahs and church functions together.</p>
        <p>In 1984, Eugene began to delve into the family history, and by the time George died in 1993, he had uncovered the family secrets. Returning as successful Americans, the Poganys have visited Hungary several times since then, rediscovering childhood landmarks: churches and schools they attended, bleak towns they inhabited and even the  cemetery where Bela Pogany is buried.</p>
        <p>Nicholas, who has witnessed the ugliest side of human nature, has mixed feelings about his homeland. Although he has a need to return, he said: ''I hate that place. They can offer me all of Hungary and I would not accept. I am an American now.</p>
        <p>''People must know this story, so it will never happen again,'' added Nicholas, who earned a law degree in Budapest and was a social worker in Newark. ''But if you are malevolent, you will never change.''</p>
        <p>As he tells his stories of unspeakable inhumanity, his eyes, dulled by age, well up, and he gently dabs his tears. ''I knew that I'd make it,'' he said of a life filled with betrayals and small conquests. Nicholas is proud of his son, and the book. And he is quick to show off letters of praise from Elie Wiesel, Pope John Paul II and others.</p>
        <p>The Poganys daughter, Ellen Beigel, said: ''After reading the book and about the vow to have Jewish children, the fact that my brother was able to document this interesting story, and have it printed for other people to read, makes that vow even more fulfilling.''</p>
        <p>Peter, at 50 the oldest son of Nicholas and Muci, said: ''My family's story is almost like fiction. No one can fathom what they went through.''</p>
        <p>And with all the sorrow in his past, the invincible Nicholas joked about his life as both a Catholic and a Jew: ''When I die, I have insurance on both sides.''</p>
