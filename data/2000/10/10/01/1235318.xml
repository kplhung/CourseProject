        <p>The cheers echoed through the ballroom of the Best Western Carriage House Inn here. White ''Lazio 2000'' buttons gleamed from shirts and blouses and, as they always do, those in the crowd laughed at Representative Rick A. Lazio's favorite joke about New York subsidizing Arkansas.</p>
        <p>''We expect our fair share,'' said Mr. Lazio, smiling his perpetual grin and adding that New York State sends billions more in federal taxes to Washington than it receives in return. ''If you compare it to states that we effectively subsidize, Southern states, like, let's pick a Southern state, say. . . .''</p>

        <p>The cheers echoed through the ballroom of the Best Western Carriage House Inn here. White ''Lazio 2000'' buttons gleamed from shirts and blouses and, as they always do, those in the crowd laughed at Representative Rick A. Lazio's favorite joke about New York subsidizing Arkansas.</p>
        <p>''We expect our fair share,'' said Mr. Lazio, smiling his perpetual grin and adding that New York State sends billions more in federal taxes to Washington than it receives in return. ''If you compare it to states that we effectively subsidize, Southern states, like, let's pick a Southern state, say. . . .''</p>
        <p>''Arkansas!'' someone from the crowd cried out, to laughter.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio had come, though, to convince people that the upstate economy had turned a corner but had not completely righted itself, a notion he found disputed not only in the region, but also in this very room.</p>
        <p>''Stay on message,'' one man called out. ''New York State upstate is getting better in spite of what the opposition makes fun of you for.''</p>
        <p>But one woman in the crowd was not convinced. ''We are dairy farmers,'' she said. ''All of the economy in the North Country is not getting better. My husband has taken over a 60 percent cut in wages this year, and so has my son, who works with us. We want to preserve our family farm. We need that Northeast dairy compact now, and we want you working for it.''</p>
        <p>Nobody mentioned soft money. Few people talked of trust. Instead, this week, as he toured upstate in advance of what his aides said would be a full-court press in October to counter an unexpectedly strong showing in the region by Hillary Rodham Clinton, Mr. Lazio heard concerns about more bread-and-butter issues, like jobs and local development.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio reaches the start of October, a critical time for his campaign, with three polls indicating that Mrs. Clinton is building a lead, particularly upstate, which pundits say he should command.</p>
        <p>He has faced enthusiastic, if modest, crowds, but also concerns among Republican voters and party officials that people do not have a good grasp of him, that he may not be hitting concerns that drive people into the voting booth.</p>
        <p>His campaign strategists are sending word to reporters to watch for a ''revamp'' and ''retooling'' in his upstate strategy. They say he will devote more time and resources upstate. More television commercials will be broadcast. More proposals will come out. He will talk more about an education plan he proposed nearly three weeks ago but has not heavily promoted since then, although he has called the issue paramount. More surrogates will make appearances, like Gov. George E. Pataki, who toured with Mr. Lazio at a factory today to promote tax relief as a stimulus to the economy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio's campaign manager, Bill Dal Col, said of the coming surge, ''The final push is about pushing you over the edge.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Dal Col warned against underestimating the power of grass-roots, low-profile campaigning, including direct-mail and phone solicitations.  These, he said, are potentially potent weapons that Mr. Lazio plans to unleash with vigor in October.</p>
        <p>Some political scientists watching the campaign say they think that Mr. Lazio's push for upstate voters will not be as successful as he hopes. They say he should have paid more attention to the region earlier, instead of allowing Mrs. Clinton to be the first to bring up the upstate economy and to advance the perception -- right or wrong -- that she has taken the lead on the issue, a perception that has given her a bounce in the polls.</p>
        <p>Surveys taken well in advance of Election Day do not necessarily capture the mood of voters. But they do feed impressions of a candidate and a campaign among voters and journalists.</p>
        <p>''There is pretty good reason to be concerned,'' said a top Republican strategist. He wondered if Mr. Lazio's support of large-scale tax relief measures would resonate in upstate areas that were not ailing. ''Their numbers are indicating that they are falling far enough back that they have a lot of work to do,'' he said of the Lazio campaign. ''They are allowing the terms of engagement to be dictated by the other side.''</p>
        <p>Another Republican strategist put it more bluntly, saying: ''These guys are flailing. There is no apparent direction that I can see, and they better find one in the next couple of weeks before it is too late.''</p>
        <p>Even some of Mr. Lazio's most enthusiastic supporters say he needs to do more to connect with voters, particularly upstate.</p>
        <p>''The soft-money thing was great for getting his name out there,'' said a Republican fund-raiser in Ulster County, ''but people want to hear more about his record. His message doesn't always get out. He has a good record.''</p>
        <p>James E. Campbell, a professor of political science at the State University of New York at Buffalo, agreed, saying Mr. Lazio's battle with Mrs. Clinton over the unregulated campaign funds known as soft money cost him precious time needed to counter a growing perception that he was not attentive to the struggling economy in pivotal Erie County.</p>
        <p>Professor Campbell said that while there were more jobs in the county now than there were a few years ago, the boarded-up storefronts and abandoned buildings made it clear that much more needed to be done.</p>
        <p>''He needs to reassess and make his case that his more broad-base plan is better for the economy than Mrs. Clinton's targeted micromanaging approach,'' Mr. Campbell said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio contends that his comments on the economy have been misconstrued. He has said that his plan to lower taxes and encourage business partnerships among the private and public sectors will strengthen the economy everywhere.</p>
        <p>''As I've said all along, more work needs to be done,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He also says that with five weeks left in the race, he does not put much stock in polls. He and his aides say they are not surprised that he is trailing Mrs. Clinton. They point out  that Mr. Lazio is running in a state with a Democratic majority, during a presidential election year in which the Democratic nominee is ahead in this state. In addition, they concede, Mrs. Clinton has campaigned aggressively upstate, and her campaign has broadcast several commercials aimed at the region. And they believe that Mr. Lazio's entry in the race just four months ago put him at a disadvantage.</p>
        <p>''I think it's very important not to be fooled by poll numbers,'' Mr. Lazio told reporters today after the Watertown rally. ''I think if you look at the enthusiasm at the grass-roots level, the people who are supporting me, the people who are Republicans and Democrats and independents, the people who are willing to cross party lines, the people in this room who are elected Democrats who are supporting me, I think that makes a huge statement about the fact we do have momentum, that we are going to win this race.''</p>
        <p>Over and over, Mr. Lazio has pointed to his 1992 upset victory for his House seat, a race in which polls showed him behind by 18 points several days before the election, he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio missed a majority of votes in the House in September and has tempered the pace of his fund-raising. That has given him more time to campaign, which his advisers say he needs after spending so much of the summer raising money to catch up with Mrs. Clinton.</p>
        <p>On this trip, which began Wednesday and was to end Saturday, Mr. Lazio's stops consisted largely of visits to small light-manufacturing plants, where he closely observed the assembly of lighting fixtures, sprayers for lawn care products and laminates for circuit boards. A strategist explained that such stops may seem low key, but they provide ''good optics'' for television and newspaper cameras in the smaller media markets the campaign has shortchanged.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio also worked his base at party rallies and dinners, explaining the high stakes he sees in this race.</p>
        <p>''People throughout America are looking to New York,'' he told the gathering here in Watertown, striking a theme he has sounded for a week or so. ''They think this race is more important in many ways than the races in their own home state. They look at this race and they say, 'You know what? This is a race that may determine the direction that America goes. It may determine the moral compass of our country.' It's a race that could determine the heart and soul of America, and for a lot of New Yorkers, I think it's a race over the heart and soul of New York. So there is a lot at stake.''</p>
        <p>Since the summer, Mr. Lazio has said character and trust are driving issues; his aides said they were the underpinnings of his recent push for campaign finance reform, an issue they insisted he would not drop. But in recent days, Mr. Lazio has hardly raised the subject himself unless prompted by reporters.</p>
        <p>Instead, in several speeches he talked of easing tax burdens across the board and stressed the importance of a sound education system -- the subjects of his two major policy addresses since joining the race.</p>
        <p>This trip also offered Mr. Lazio a chance to hear more about voters' concerns. A policy adviser has been quietly taking notes at each stop. Mr. Lazio was asked by a veteran here if he supported a constitutional amendment to bar desecration of the flag. He said he did. At another stop, the candidate urged high school students to swear off drugs and alcohol, but later declined to say if he supported voluntary abstinence for everyone.</p>
        <p>And he did plenty of old-fashioned, grass-roots campaigning.</p>
        <p>''The countdown has begun,'' he told Republicans in East Rochester. ''We need to make sure we get every vote out. Every vote counts in this election. Please, please, please get those bumper stickers on, yard signs up. Call your neighbors. We don't want to have to think about the day after election that we did not do everything that we should have done to make sure we sealed victory.''</p>
