        <p>Vice President Al Gore met with a couple of his hand-picked ''real people'' today to begin preparing for Tuesday's debate with Gov. George W. Bush in Boston -- what he called, in President Clinton's phrase, a ''job interview'' with the American people.</p>
        <p>In a novel approach, Mr. Gore is assembling a ''debate camp'' of 13 ordinary citizens he has met along the campaign trail to help him prepare for the debates. All 13 were to gather here later tonight.</p>
        <p>''The average working person in this country represents the person who I'm really fighting for in this election,'' Mr. Gore said. ''You know, I see a debate kind of like a job interview. And so I want to spend my time preparing for the debate with the people who are representative of the ones who are going to be doing the hiring.''</p>
        <p>One of those greeting him was Donald Jalbert, 43, a school principal from Lewiston, Me. Mr. Jalbert said that the Gore campaign had provided him with an inch-thick packet of issues papers to study.</p>
        <p>But, he said, he thought Mr. Gore was looking for ''something a little different.'' He said Mr. Gore ''has to try to attract the swing voters, and needs to figure out how to say some of these things they've been talking about a little differently.''</p>
        <p>For his part, Mr. Gore told reporters on Air Force Two, ''When I get to places in the preparation where I have a question about how to proceed, I want to use them as a sounding board.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore will also be spending time with his professional campaign consultants, including Carter Eskew, Bob Shrum, Stanley Greenberg, Tad Devine and William M. Daley, his campaign chairman. Florida is also a staging ground with a purpose -- the presidential race is dead even here and if Mr. Gore can win it, his advisers believe he can win the election.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Gore was playing down the competitive aspects of the debates, saying he was just looking for a way of communicating with voters.</p>
        <p>''There's not a lot of heavy lifting,'' he told reporters, ''but reading a stack of briefing books can be pretty boring.''</p>
        <p>Reporters noticed that Mr. Gore's fingernails were bitten down to the quick. Asked if he bit his nails, he replied, ''Uh, yeah, sometimes.''</p>
        <p>Asked if he was nervous, he said, ''No, as I said yesterday, the older I get, the less I get nervous about things that might have made me nervous when I was younger.''</p>
