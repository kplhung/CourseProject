        <p>FEW people ever noticed the anonymous one-story building running along the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive from 49th to 51st Streets, its southern end at the foot of the majestic co-op at 1 Beekman Place, which was built by the Rockefeller family. Now the unusual structure -- a 460-foot-long garage whose origins reflect a Civil War-era height restriction -- is largely demolished. And the co-op has hired the architects Fox &amp; Fowle, otherwise known for their new Times Square skyscrapers, to rebuild it.</p>
        <p>The new garage won't have pulsing screens or high-tech metal and glass, as do the Fox &amp; Fowle-designed Conde Nast and Reuters Buildings in Times Square -- only a plain brick and rubble stone wall, in keeping with the super-quiet character of this low-profile co-op.</p>
        <p>The Beekman family, Colonial-era merchants, built a riverfront mansion near the foot of East 50th Street in 1764. Many sources say that the patriot-spy Nathan Hale was first arraigned there after his capture by the British in 1776. By the mid-19th century the East River waterfront had fallen far from its resort status, and coal yards, lumber mills and other industries dotted the shoreline, at least where there was good river access.</p>
        <p>Perhaps because the Beekman mansion's grounds were on a high, rocky bluff without good water access, the house remained standing until the 1870's. But in 1865 the family sold off much of its land around the newly established Beekman Place, including most of the river-facing lots between 49th and 51st Street. To protect the light and air of the brownstone row houses that soon went up at 13-39 Beekman Place, the Beekmans promised to restrict the height of future buildings on their remaining waterfront strip of land, directly below the houses, to no higher than that of Beekman Place itself.</p>
        <p>By the turn of the century bigger and bigger factories were crowding the shoreline -- among them the huge Cremo cigar factory on the current site of River House at 52nd Street -- and the once-genteel private houses were filled with boarders. Still, a clipping from The New York Sun at the Museum of the City of New York, undated but probably from the 1910's, painted a bucolic picture of the clifftop houses looking down on the rocky shore below: ''Mothers in the neighborhood take their knitting and embroidery every afternoon and bask in the shade. . . . Even Coney Island and Rockaway have nothing on the beach at Beekman Place.''</p>
        <p>By this time the Beekman family estate was trying to void the 1865 height restriction on the waterfront strip -- with a free hand, it said, it could have wiped out the beach and replaced it with a giant steam plant. In 1920 The New York Times reported on what had been a six-year fight to remove the restrictions, which the row-house owners on Beekman Place had fought strenuously to keep.</p>
        <p>The Beekmans' lawyer, Herbert L. Fordham, said that radical changes in the area should void the restriction because it was ridiculous to hang on to the ''half-forgotten vision of terraces and gardens . . . in the midst of towering steam plants, electric light plants and coal pockets. New York needs its waterfront for business.''</p>
        <p>BY 1922 the Beekmans gave up the fight and leased the waterfront strip -- 460 feet long, stretching from 49th up to 51st, and including the empty plot on Beekman Place now occupied by 1 Beekman Place.</p>
        <p>The lease was acquired by a development group that announced plans for a studio apartment on the Beekman Place frontage, and a one-story garage on the waterfront strip. The studio apartment was not built, but the garage, designed by John J. Dunnigan, later a state senator from the Bronx, did go up. It had simple rubble-stone walls and a curved, wood-truss roof. The garage entrance was at 49th Street.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the Beekmans should have held out, because just as they surrendered, fashion came to Beekman Place, and house after house was turned into elite occupancy. The natural outcome, for the empty plot at the south end of Beekman Place, was the luxurious 16-story co-op at 1 Beekman, built in 1930 by a syndicate headed by David M. Milton, the son-in-law of John D. Rockefeller Jr.</p>
        <p>Milton's wife, Abby, was called by The New York Times ''the wealthiest young woman in America.'' The Times reported that the couple were taking an 18-room triplex with a 33-by-25-foot living room. The building had 335 rooms divided among 24 apartments, most of which were duplexes.</p>
        <p>Milton's syndicate reached an accommodation with the garage operator and reduced the southerly section of the garage to a narrow driveway encased in the building and running through 1 Beekman's waterside complex of tea room, gym, swimming pool, squash courts and additional duplex apartments.</p>
        <p>Early tenants at 1 Beekman included the diplomat David K. E. Bruce, William J. Donovan -- who founded the Office of Strategic Services, the forerunner of the C.I.A. -- the Miltons and John D. Rockefeller III.</p>
        <p>The architects were Sloan &amp; Robertson, with Corbett, Harrison &amp; MacMurray. The latter firm was also designing Rockefeller Center, for John D. Rockefeller Jr. Rockefeller lent his son-in-law $1 million to build 1 Beekman, and the contractor was Webster B. Todd, whose father, John R. Todd, was working with Rockefeller on the plans for Rockefeller Center.</p>
        <p>The younger Todd also took an apartment in the building; his daughter, Christine Todd Whitman, is the governor of New Jersey. Partly because it is tucked away on Beekman Place, the building has had a low profile and is far less well known than River House, 10 Gracie Square and comparable structures.</p>
        <p>PHOTOGRAPHS of the garage in the 1930's show that people still sat along the water's edge, and it was not the Beekmans but the East River Drive, completed in 1939 in this section, that finally wiped out the quiet river view, although a small park, reached from 49th and 51st Street, was inserted between the garage and the highway.</p>
        <p>Although now the traffic noise is almost overwhelming, over time the park has grown in, and the garage structure was surrounded by weed trees and vines, many growing out of the clifflike retaining wall rising above the garage up to Beekman Place. From the park the garage was mysterious -- the southern third in the polite Georgian style of 1 Beekman Place incongruously joined to the northern two-thirds, a primitive, anonymous structure.</p>
        <p>Now the northern portion is demolished almost to ground level, and work crews are stripping off the vines and weed trees, some of which are more than a foot thick.</p>
        <p>Fox &amp; Fowle declined to comment on the reconstruction. Metropolitan Planning and Management, the construction consultant for the $1 million project, said that the roof of the garage had been leaking and that except for a flat roof with some plantings, the building was being put back almost the way it was, keeping in place the lower half of the rubble stone wall and adding brick above.</p>
