        <p>Dolly Filartiga's days of medical training are long behind her. She was studying to be a doctor in Paraguay in 1976 when her brother Joelito, 17, was tortured and killed because their father opposed the repressive government.

        <p>In 1984, a federal judge in Brooklyn ruled that the family was entitled to $10.4 million in damages from Americo Norberto Pena-Irala, the inspector general who ran the police force in Asuncion, Paraguay, in 1976.

        <p>Dolly Filartiga's days of medical training are long behind her. She was studying to be a doctor in Paraguay in 1976 when her brother Joelito, 17, was tortured and killed because their father opposed the repressive government. Ms. Filartiga dropped her studies to seek reprisal. Today, living in Forest Hills, Queens, she said full justice continued to elude her.</p>
        <p>In 1984, a federal judge in Brooklyn ruled that the family was entitled to $10.4 million in damages from Americo Norberto Pena-Irala, the inspector general who ran the police force in Asuncion, Paraguay, in 1976. When the Filartigas filed their civil lawsuit, Mr. Pena-Irala was living in Brooklyn, but he soon returned to Paraguay.</p>
        <p>''We were a fantastic family until this man came and killed my brother,'' Ms. Filartiga, 45, said Friday in an interview.</p>
        <p>The 1984 ruling has been cited as a precedent in more than 100 civil lawsuits on human rights. But in all the lawsuits, including Ms. Filartiga's, no money has been collected because the defendants live abroad.</p>
        <p>For years, the Paraguayan government has refused demands by Ms. Filartiga and her lawyers to pay the damages. Two weeks ago, the Filartigas appealed to the lower house of Parliament, which is expected to issue a decision in about a month.</p>
        <p>If Paraguay continues to refuse to pay, Ms. Filartiga said, her family will ask the Inter-American Court of Human Rights in Costa Rica to enforce the Brooklyn federal court's decision. ''We people who were persecuted, we are not ordinary people,'' she said. ''We have been fighting since they killed my brother.''</p>
