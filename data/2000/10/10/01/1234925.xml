        <p>If you grew up in the 1970's, then you remember a time when the very phrase ''staying together for the sake of the children'' sounded hopelessly Victorian. Unhappily married couples, so the thinking went, were doing their children a favor by divorcing. It was the era of ''An Unmarried Woman,'' of ''I'm OK -- You're OK'' and of the first no-fault divorce laws. Dish-hurling, name-calling parents were bad for kids, sure, but so were repressed parents who lingered in tepid marriages under the misguided assumption that a mother and father together were always better than either alone. Divorce was a crisis from which children would quickly bounce back.</p>
        <p>For years, this notion hung on more or less unassailed in dinner-party wisdom, psychology textbooks and sitcoms. Only in the last decade or so has it begun to seem more self-serving than truthful -- and for this dawning recognition we owe a great deal to the work of the psychologist Judith Wallerstein. She, more than anyone else, has made us face the truth that a divorce can free one or both parents to start a new and more hopeful life and still hurt their children. She has urged parents and policy makers alike to think seriously about the impact of divorce on children, while acknowledging its necessity as an escape route for couples yoked miserably together.</p>
        <p>By now, Wallerstein's research has also informed a barrage of antidivorce polemics and ideological defenses of marriage that are far less subtle and humane than her own books. Some, like ''The Case for Marriage: Why Married People Are Happier, Healthier, and Better Off Financially,'' by Linda J. Waite and Maggie Gallagher, just seem strained. Waite and Gallagher think people ought to get married and stay married, and they catalog, exhaustively, all the statistical reasons: married people live longer and healthier lives, make more money, feel happier and claim to have better and more frequent sex than their single counterparts. But it's hard to know who is supposed to read this book or what purpose it might serve. Most people want to get married, after all. The right to divorce is deeply ingrained in American culture precisely because so is the ideal of a mutually fulfilling marriage.</p>
        <p>Wallerstein's goal, on the other hand, is not to condemn divorce. It's to remind us that it takes a toll on children that adults may not want to acknowledge. To make this case, she draws on a unique storehouse of information. Since 1971, she has followed the postdivorce fates of the same 60 families from Marin County, Calif. In ''Second Chances: Men, Women and Children a Decade After Divorce,'' written in 1989 with Sandra Blakeslee, a regular contributor to The New York Times, Wallerstein looked at how the kids were faring 10 and 15 years after their parents split up and was surprised to find that half of them were entering adulthood as ''worried, underachieving, self-deprecating and sometimes angry young men and women.''</p>
        <p>In ''The Unexpected Legacy of Divorce,'' also written with Blakeslee, Wallerstein and her colleague Julia Lewis check in with 93 of the original 131 children, and profile five of them in detail. Like ''Second Chances,'' the new book offers the narrative satisfactions of a high school reunion or a where-are-they-now documentary. Will angry Larry finally realize that his abusive father was the jerk in the family, not his cowed but kindly mother? Will ultraresponsible Karen, who took charge of her clingy mother and younger siblings after her parents divorced, ever loosen up enough to fall in love and take a gamble on marriage?</p>
        <p>As it turns out, only 40 percent of the ''children'' in her study, who now range in age from their late 20's to their early 40's, have ever married. (In the general population, the figures are 81 percent for men in that age range and and 87 percent for women.) Since their own parents had not projected the image of a loving and contented relationship, Wallerstein's subjects felt they had no idea what one ought to be like. For them, trying to live in day-to-day harmony with another person was like ''becoming a dancer without ever having seen a dance.'' (Of course, the same might be said for the children of warring spouses.) Wallerstein concludes that ''contrary to what we have long thought, the major impact of divorce does not occur during childhood or adolescence. Rather, it rises in adulthood as serious romantic relationships move center stage.''</p>
        <p>This emphasis on the long-term effect of divorce is the new nugget here. But in some ways, I found it less compelling than the reiteration of Wallerstein's earlier themes -- above all, the way in which children's needs are often overlooked, and their resilience blithely assumed, in custody settlements. There are a few subjects on which Wallerstein becomes righteously indignant. One is the way in which postdivorce visiting arrangements fail to take into account either the individual personalities or the changing needs of children. The painstakingly equalized schedules that placate some parents and help some kids may make others feel like movable property. What works for a 6-year-old may no longer suffice for an adolescent. ''Americans tend to listen to their children and value their opinions. They are seen and heard and consulted,'' Wallerstein writes. But the child for whom visiting arrangements are court-ordered or negotiated by still-angry parents ''is a passive vessel -- like a rag doll that stays put in whatever position it is placed.''</p>
        <p>Why, she asks, can't such arrangements better accommodate the temperament and growth of the individual child? One 9-year-old boy she cites was ordered by the court to fly from Flint, Mich., to Philadelphia two weekends a month for visits with his father. He left after school on Fridays and had to change planes in Chicago, which frightened him, especially in winter weather. ''He would return after a weekend with his dad and sit in his room silently holding his dog, refusing to see his friends.''</p>
        <p>Or consider Paula, whose obligations were less grueling but who offers an equally striking example of loneliness and maladjustment. Paula, one of the children Wallerstein follows well into adulthood, was 4 when her parents, a businessman who had fallen into debt and his pretty, young stay-at-home wife, split up. In general, Wallerstein believes, children under 6 suffer the most after divorce simply because they require the most constant care. And in postdivorce turmoil, when many mothers suddenly find themselves having to go to work or school, and when both parents are often consumed with their own grief or desire to move on, even very young children tend to receive less care. Paula's mother was a case in point. Desperate to make a better life for herself and her two daughters, she took college classes from 7 a.m. to noon and worked afternoons and all day Saturday. At night, she'd lock herself in the bathroom to study while Paula lay on the floor outside listening to her turn the pages of her textbook.</p>
        <p>It didn't help that no one had tried to explain to Paula the disappearance of the family she had known. Like many divorcing couples, Paula's parents did not tell their children they were separating till the day they actually did. In too many families, Wallerstein writes: ''It's as if the divorce came out of the blue. No one says a word. This means that the child, especially the pre-school child, often learns about the divorce in the most traumatic way possible when she wakes up one morning to find that her father and his belongings have vanished into thin air.''</p>
        <p>Wallerstein, who believes that how and when divorcing parents break the news makes a big difference in how their children cope afterward, offers specific suggestions to couples about what they might say. Indeed, one of this book's virtues is the way it combines research and analysis with advice to real people facing the breakup of their marriages.</p>
        <p>At times, though, it's clear that the very strengths of Wallerstein's method -- the in-depth interviews with people she has known since they were small children -- are also its weakness. When some of her subjects talk about defining themselves as ''children of divorce,'' I wonder if being categorized as such in a celebrated 25-year study didn't contribute to that identity. In interviews with journalists, the 78-year-old Wallerstein refers to the subjects of her study as her ''children''; they call her Judy, send her cards and snapshots, invite her to their weddings. It could well be that they share with her a sadder, more vulnerable side of themselves than they do with others, but sadder and more vulnerable are not necessarily truer.</p>
        <p>The fact that some of these characters are composites -- she tells us so in the introduction, but does not say which -- is also a bit troubling. At least one of the characters from her last book, ''Dana,'' makes an appearance here as ''Lisa,'' speaking some of the same lines verbatim, acting out the same brutal game with the dolls she's offered at her first interview -- but given some different identifying details. It's hard to know for sure whether Wallerstein and her co-authors are using composites to protect the identity of their subjects or to shape their lives into more convenient parables.</p>
        <p>For years, Wallerstein's critics -- especially those who think she exaggerates divorce's detrimental effects on kids -- have argued that her research was unscientific. She hadn't incorporated a control group into her original study; the population she looked at was a homogeneous, from a single middle-class community. In the new book, she tries to answer those critics by including interviews with 44 adults from the same community whose parents did not divorce. This ''comparison'' group doesn't add much to the scientific quotient -- the numbers are too small and they aren't carefully matched with the people from the original study.</p>
        <p>By now, though, the attacks on Wallerstein's methods seem irrelevant. Other well-designed, large-scale studies that did use control groups have confirmed many of her findings -- showing higher dropout rates and a greater incidence of emotional disturbance among children of divorced parents than among children from intact families, for example. Besides, if anything, her prosperous middle-class sample should have influenced the results in a more positive direction.</p>
        <p>Yet in one important regard Wallerstein's sample is skewed in a way that may have led her to overly pessimistic conclusions. The parents described here separated in 1971, at a time when most mothers did not have careers of their own and were more likely to suffer precipitous declines in income when their husbands left; when relatively few fathers took an active role in the care of their young children; and when people married and had children at younger ages. (This last point is important because, according to Wallerstein's study, anyway, younger fathers were the least likely to stay involved in their children's lives after a divorce.) In all these respects, America is a different place now -- maybe not different enough to make divorce significantly kinder to children, but different enough to give us hope.</p>
