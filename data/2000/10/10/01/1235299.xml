        <p>In the United States' Olympic women's basketball team media guide, there is a team photo from the 1984 Los Angeles Games, where the Americans won all six games and the gold medal. The picture of youth, Teresa Edwards stands in the second row, far left corner, with a hairstyle she doesn't wish to remember and a set of clothing she won't forget.</p>
        <p>There, obediently adhering to team code, are the best women's players of the day, posing for posterity in matching blue blazers, white blouses and blue skirts.</p>
        <p>''So much has changed,'' Edwards said last night, her last in uniform, which she has managed to wear so long and so well. ''The style of play, the exposure, the acceptance of women's athletes as a whole.''</p>
        <p>Teresa Edwards came out of Cairo, Ga., and the University of Georgia, and did more than one person's share to facilitate that change. She toiled in Europe but always came home when it was time to form another Olympic team, time to raise her sport's profile. Beginning in 1984, from 20 years of age to a mature 36, she graced five.</p>
        <p>''Almost a miracle in itself,'' her teammate, Ruthie Bolton-Holifield, said.</p>
        <p>A fourth gold medal won last night, claimed after the Americans gave the Australians a 76-54 comeuppance, was enough to convince Edwards it was time to go, ''going out the right way.'' She would retire finally after 20 years of pushing the ball up the floor, of fighting the uphill battle for gender equity in sports. She would leave her ''fantasy life'' on top, on her own terms.</p>
        <p>Her postgame presence was requested in doping control but Edwards said, sorry, after five Olympics, they could wait for her.</p>
        <p>She wanted to be the last player off the court following the medal ceremony, and have time to herself, just as when she was a kid in Cairo. The coaches would let her have the empty gym, sometimes with the lights turned down. Alone, she would shoot and shoot until she could barely move, and then she would sit, in the middle of the court, in the circle, until she was ready to shoot some more. So while the others went off to celebrate, Edwards sat down in the circle, daydreaming about the past and wondering about the future. And that was where Dawn Staley found her, trying to fight off the emotions and be the same ol' reliable, imperturbable Teresa.</p>
        <p>''Let it go,'' Staley told her.</p>
        <p>Edwards let it go, and had a good cry.</p>
        <p>Six years younger, Staley was the quicker player, yet Edwards remained a starter for Nell Fortner, the head coach, and nobody, least of all Staley, was about to complain. The way Staley looked at it, here was a woman who commanded respect, who was one of the true grinders and table-setters for what the women have now.</p>
        <p>Compared to the men, it's not that much, as Edwards admitted. She, in fact, had refused to join the Women's National Basketball Association after the American Basketball League folded last year. The pay wasn't worth it. Not after all these years, and all her effort.</p>
        <p>''When people think of the era she came up in, it's always Cheryl Miller,'' Staley said, referring to the player two down from Edwards in the same row in that 1984 team photo. ''But there were a lot of other players, like T., who did whatever they had to do, to keep playing, keep the game moving forward.''</p>
        <p>Edwards played almost 29 of the 40 minutes of her last game, scored 6 points. She had three official assists but they didn't count her experience, her level-headedness, against an opponent that had become grating to her teammates. Nowhere in any box score was the impact of the team meeting she called before the quarterfinal to talk about what it felt like in 1992, the one year she didn't win gold.</p>
        <p>''She told us how bad it feels when you're expected to win and you don't,'' said Yolanda Griffith. ''She told us, 'I don't want you to feel the way I did.' ''</p>
        <p>They listened and played hard, crisp and efficient basketball right through the final. They pounded the boards, ran the break. When it was over, Edwards's teammates hugged her, one by one. Lisa Leslie had tears in her eyes when she said, ''This was all for her.''</p>
        <p>Someone asked Edwards if she thought the American men, whooping it up last night in the stands, enjoyed watching them because the women have something they've lost. ''I don't know what those guys like,'' she said. ''They've got too much money for me to worry about them.''</p>
        <p>For any truly committed player, it is about your game, your team. For Edwards, it was always about ''not following the crowd,'' about being the sure and steady leader.</p>
        <p>With the game and financial rewards still growing, she said she is sometimes asked if she came along too soon. ''I say, 'I'm right on time,' '' she said. ''I think I made an impact. I made a career of it.''</p>
        <p>It ended last night, with a golden goodbye.</p>
