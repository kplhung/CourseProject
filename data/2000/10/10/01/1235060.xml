        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Douglas Davis is dead on in his evaluation of museum Web sites. Why do Web sites fall short, especially in terms of content and interactivity potential?</p>
        <p>As Mr. Davis must know, most of the major museums he surveyed, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, are bastions of traditionalism run by directors and board members who are not, as a rule, because of their age and class, part of the demographic group that uses the Web. They have vast resources to dedicate to Web sites if they so desired, but they do not, in my experience, wish to listen to the ideas of younger art historians and curators who are Web site users themselves. Those museums with smaller budgets want to jump on the Web site bandwagon to gain a larger audience but squander their limited resources by doing a middling job of it.</p>
        <p>For several years I worked at a Connecticut museum whose director and board were convinced that they needed a Web site and even dedicated enough money to pay a professional design team to create it. Yet they punted when it came to content and interactivity: they hired a local college student to maintain the site part time and solicited little input from museums, curators or educators. The site remains, in essence, a glossy brochure with pretty pictures pasted onto a Web site, offering little information except for a short list of artists in the collection, directions to the museum, and a few overgeneralized blurbs about key paintings.</p>
        <p>Until museum directors fully commit to the idea of the virtual museum by dedicating appropriate resources and soliciting more content and value from their creative and intelligent staff members, museum Web sites will remain substandard and far below their potential.</p>
