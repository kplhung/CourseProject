        <p>For decades Hollywood was a town run by a few moguls. Films were churned out like autos on an assembly line. Labor negotiations in the 1930's and 1940's were often resolved through the strong-arm tactics of dynastic studios. By the 1960's, with the power of studios ebbing, the unions and film studios as well as television networks placed labor negotiations in the hands of the town's top broker, Lew R. Wasserman, then the chairman of MCA Inc.</p>
        <p>The town has changed. Mr. Wasserman is 87 and frail, and Hollywood's power structure is a complex amalgam of competing corporate interests. The unions, once weak and divided, are emboldened. And, most important, Hollywood is now beset by issues that go beyond simple wage increases for actors and others. The growth of foreign markets for films and television series, the expansion of the video and DVD industries and, more recently, the Internet explosion have left writers, actors and directors with deep grievances about their pay and status.</p>
        <p>Now Hollywood is in a panic mode. For the first time, unions are confronting networks and studios about how writers and actors should be paid when films and television shows are shown on the Internet and on the growing number of cable outlets. And they are threatening strikes that union officials and television and film executives all expect to define the issues that will shape the entertainment industry's labor relations for decades.</p>
        <p>The impact of the strike threats is already rippling across the entertainment business and is affecting what viewers around the world will see in movies and television next year. Although the job actions are not scheduled until mid-2001, studios and networks are consumed with making films and television series in advance of the possible walkouts.</p>
        <p>Television networks are already planning more reality and news shows, which would not be affected by an actors' strike. In the rush to make movies now, executives acknowledge that some scripts that are not fully ready have been given the green light in order to speed films into production before a strike.</p>
        <p>Scott Rudin, one of Hollywood's most prolific producers, has accelerated his schedule and is planning six movies before spring, when production would stop. ''Everyone's working under a deadline,'' he said. ''If you think you'll be shooting in June or July, you're in a state of diminished mental capacity.''</p>
        <p>Hollywood is far more concerned about the strike threats than it is with the current debate in Washington over violence in the movies, television, video games and music lyrics. A strike could mean lost wages of $680 million a month in Los Angeles for the 272,000 people working in the entertainment industry.</p>
        <p>Fueling anxiety among networks and studios was the collapse on Wednesday of talks aimed at ending the five-month-old actors strike against the advertising industry. While not directly related to the planned strikes next year, the issues -- earnings from new technology and  cable -- are quite similar.</p>
        <p>In the larger battle, a strike by the Writers Guild of America, representing 11,000 writers on the East and West coasts, is set for May 1. The Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, representing 135,000 actors, are scheduled to walk out on June 30.</p>
        <p>The issue of Internet compensation is a particularly sore point for writers. Nearly 20 years ago, writers bowed to producers on the issue of payment for shows appearing as re-runs on the then-fledgling basic cable networks. The two sides worked out a  formula, which was revised in 1988, that now gives writers 2 percent of the license fee for each episode earned by a producer or studio. This can translate into about $6,500 for a one-hour episode. But the writers think this is far too low, especially given the networks' growing propensity to rerun their shows on cable channels. Internet properties are not included in the current formula.</p>
        <p>''The management said it was a new form, to give them a break, and let's not strangle the baby in a cradle and they'll make it up later on,'' said Michael Mahern, secretary general of the West Coast division of the Writers Guild. ''Well, 'later on' has yet to come. This makes writers inherently suspicious of breaks intended to help out the growth of a new technology where our good will is not returned when the technology becomes mature.''</p>
        <p>Marshall Herskovitz, a top television writer who has created, with Edward Zwick, such shows as ''Thirtysomething'' and ''Once and Again,'' said simply, ''There is a very strong sense of deja vu and suspicion as we move into negotiations regarding the Internet and confusion about what the future will hold for broadband and multiple delivery systems.''</p>
        <p>Nick Counter, president of the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, representing the management side, said informal discussions had begun with the Writers Guild. ''We're waiting to hear back from them,'' he said. Mr. Counter said talks with the Screen Actors Guild were largely in abeyance because of the actors' strike against advertising agencies.</p>
        <p>Actors currently get a minimum residual of $3,100 on a one-hour drama's first showing as a rerun, a sum that slides downward in subsequent showings.</p>
        <p>There is another issue at play. In a sign of their growing militancy, screenwriters are consumed not only by financial matters, like increases in residual payments for video and foreign sales, but symbolic issues involving the way credits are given on films.</p>
        <p>The writers are seeking an end to ''possessory credits,'' that is, credits on movies that read ''a film by'' followed by a name. These are taken by directors; writers view the credits as insults to them and their creative input.</p>
        <p>What has complicated the looming walkout is that the Hollywood confronting the complex new technological and labor issues is itself a far more complicated town than it ever was -- a town whose studios and networks are owned mostly by conglomerates with divergent interests.</p>
        <p>''Years ago the motion picture and television production companies were all on the same track,'' said Ken Ziffren, a top entertainment industry lawyer who is advising the  two actors unions as well as the Directors Guild of America.</p>
        <p>Nowadays, he said, studios and networks are only one part of conglomerates' identity. ''Time Warner is AOL and cable,'' Mr. Ziffren said. ''Sony is a consumer electronics company. Fox is a television network and a station group and a satellite operator and a media empire. Universal is really a music company. Disney is theme parks and cable channels as well as the ABC network. It goes on and on. The business of feature films and television is now a very small part of the corporate setup of some of these companies. There are divergent issues and interests now, much more than management versus labor.''</p>
        <p>The sheer size of many of the conglomerates can weigh heavily now in labor negotiations. For example, if the television division at Fox or Disney is facing a poor year, it could adopt a hard-line approach to negotiations because the parent company would have little to lose. These conglomerates themselves would financially support the television unit through the collective bargaining process. But if, say, Warner's television division was successful -- and Time Warner's magazine and cable units were lagging -- it would probably be a corporate priority to resolve a strike quickly in order for various series to continue and prosper.</p>
        <p>At stake for viewers is the prospect of summer and autumn of 2001 with reality shows, old movies and news magazine programs to replace comedy and drama series -- a prospect that would further diminish network audiences. To protect themselves at the outset of a strike, networks are seeking to make additional episodes of hit series. The last strike by the Writers Guild from March 7 to August 7, 1988, delayed the 1988-89 season and began the proliferation of news shows like CBS's ''48 Hours,'' which began that year, and ABC's ''Primetime Live,'' which started in 1989. That strike was generally seen as a defeat for the guild, with no major issues resolved.</p>
        <p>On the film side, a strike in 2001 would limit the number of movies in production, affecting not only actors, writers, technicians and others but also theater chains around the nation, which are already facing financial stress because of overbuilding.</p>
        <p>Even movie actors earning millions of dollars are scrambling. Mark Wahlberg was recently forced to drop out of the director Steven Soderbergh's remake of ''Oceans 11'' at Warner Brothers in order to make Tim Burton's remake of ''Planet of the Apes'' at Fox before the strike deadline. To the delight of Warner Brothers, he was replaced by an even bigger star, Matt Damon, who was searching for a quick project.</p>
        <p>Most certainly, the gloom has been deepened by the absence of a figure like Mr. Wasserman, who was a mediator trusted by all sides even though he obviously represented management. Mr. Wasserman's role was described by one former associate as resembling that of Jimmy Carter or President Clinton during Middle East negotiations -- that is, moving between both sides and saying, essentially, how far either group will go to reach an accommodation.</p>
        <p>Among the moguls seeking to step into the Wasserman role is Jeffrey Katzenberg, one of the owners of DreamWorks. Mr. Katzenberg is one of a dozen top studio executives in the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, representing the studios and networks.</p>
        <p>William Daniels, president of the Screen Actors Guild, did meet Mr. Wasserman, despite his lack of clout. ''He said that if both sides want a deal to be made it would happen,'' Mr. Daniels said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Daniels added: ''I just wish people would stop talking about a strike. We haven't even started negotiations. Let's not panic.''</p>
        <p>Preliminary talks aimed at avoiding a strike have begun, but the mood on all sides has been pessimistic, especially in the aftermath of the breakdown of talks between the actors and advertising agencies.</p>
        <p>''It's like the wild, wild west,'' said Stacy Snider, chairman of Universal Pictures. ''We're trying to hold on to a sense of reasonableness and sanity -- and I think we are -- but we have to make decisions much faster than we usually do because of what could happen.''</p>
