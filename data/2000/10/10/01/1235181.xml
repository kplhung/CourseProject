        <p>Come the first Sunday in November, the New York City Marathon will funnel some 30,000 runners over the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, through 26 miles of city streets and into Central Park near the Sheep Meadow. Draped in silvery blankets, these runners will then spill out of the park and find their friends and families waiting at the reunion area, which will be situated a stretch of Central Park West from 74th to 85th Streets.</p>
        <p>On that day, only runners and those welcoming them may use much of Central Park West, and therein lies the growing irritation for many West Siders.

They say the arrangement robs residents of bus service, blocks access to the park and worsens already heavy traffic.</p>

        <p>Come the first Sunday in November, the New York City Marathon will funnel some 30,000 runners over the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, through 26 miles of city streets and into Central Park near the Sheep Meadow. Draped in silvery blankets, these runners will then spill out of the park and find their friends and families waiting at the reunion area, which will be situated a stretch of Central Park West from 74th to 85th Streets.</p>
        <p>On that day, only runners and those welcoming them may use much of Central Park West, and therein lies the growing irritation for many West Siders. Members of Community Board 7, which covers the Upper West Side, are asking the city to make room for the reunions inside the park rather than shut down the street. They say the arrangement robs residents of bus service, blocks access to the park and worsens already heavy traffic.</p>
        <p>The Parks Department, in turn, says that park lawns cannot stand up to such foot traffic and that people must simply accept the congestion that comes with a famous marathon. The board will take up the issue at its Tuesday meeting.</p>
        <p>''The marathon is great and we want it,'' said Parks Commissioner Henry J. Stern. ''So we put up with one day's inconvenience.''</p>
        <p>The marathon has been a New York institution since 1976, but the problems associated with the reunion area began three years ago, when the city finished its $18 million renovation of Central Park. The city decided to protect the new sod by moving runners and their families to the street. Since then, Eric M. Nelson, chairman of the community board, said he had fielded numerous complaints from residents, many of them elderly.</p>
        <p>''Lots of them depend on the buses along Central Park West and are afraid to take the subway,'' Mr. Nelson said. ''So you close the street anywhere, and it's a substantial hardship for them. And why would runners and families be tearing up the lawn? People already walk there, eat there. It's not like they'll be ripping up sod for souvenirs.''</p>
        <p>But reuniting along Central Park West rather than on the Great Lawn does more than protect the grass, said Richard Finn, spokesman for the New York Road Runners Club, which oversees the marathon. The street helps with what he called ''people flow.''</p>
        <p>''Through all the chutes and medical and water stations, there's just a natural route to the street that works well,'' Mr. Finn said. ''You don't want people stopping or everything will back up.''</p>
        <p>Still, he understood why neighbors felt so disrupted.</p>
        <p>''Sure, with an undertaking this large, there will be a change in the daily life style of New Yorkers,'' he said. ''But that's just New York.''</p>
