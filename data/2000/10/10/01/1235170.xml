        <p>The intersection where the Cross Bronx Expressway meets the Bronx River Parkway has never been free of noise, traffic or pollution.

        <p>The intersection where the Cross Bronx Expressway meets the Bronx River Parkway has never been free of noise, traffic or pollution. But in the last six months, residents of the Bronx River section of the Bronx, which is ringed by these two big  highways, have realized just how unpleasant life can be when trucks idle for hours along residential streets.</p>
        <p>Francisco M. Gonzalez, district manager of Community Board 9, said he has gotten increasingly angry complaints about tractor-trailers that park along 174th and 172nd Streets, Bronx River Avenue and the Bruckner Boulevard service road.</p>
        <p>Up to 70 18-wheelers might be parked in the neighborhood at one time, Mr. Gonzalez said, and some of the trucks are filled with potentially dangerous cargo like medical waste.</p>
        <p>''When it gets hot, the smell is horrendous,'' Mr. Gonzalez said. ''And if you have leakage, it's leaking into the drainage system or the sewer system in the neighborhood.''</p>
        <p>Drivers idle because restarting a diesel engine is time-consuming and costly. Others may want to prevent refrigerated food from spoiling, or they want to sleep in their rigs.</p>
        <p>Michael C. Phipps, a deputy inspector for the 43rd Precinct, said some trucks may belong to local residents seeking to avoid costly commercial parking lots, and others drivers may be waiting to unload produce at the Hunts Point Market, just across the Bronx River.</p>
        <p>In recent weeks, the police have put metal boots on the wheels of illegally parked trucks, but they may not have enough boots for the job.  ''When I go into my next budget consultation,'' Mr. Gonzalez said, ''the first thing I'm going to ask for is more boots.''</p>
