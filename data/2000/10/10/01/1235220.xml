        <p>Race walking provided the most riveting Olympic moment for television viewers in Mexico. Danes were mesmerized by badminton, South Koreans by their men's field hockey team. Chinese and Swedish fans watched an epic battle between two longtime rivals for table-tennis gold. In the Netherlands, these Olympics were mostly about swimming. In Cameroon, they were about soccer.</p>
        <p>The Olympic Games, it is easy to forget, are  no monolith. Because it is human nature to cheer our own, the Olympics are experienced, and ultimately remembered, in different ways in different places. But the narratives all share a common theme, one of athletic prowess and determination overcoming the surrounding clutter -- the politics  of the Olympic bureaucracy, the cynicism, the specter of performance-enhancing drugs, the complaints about saccharine broadcasting and all the rest.</p>

        <p>Race walking provided the most riveting Olympic moment for television viewers in Mexico. Danes were mesmerized by badminton, South Koreans by their men's field hockey team. Chinese and Swedish fans watched an epic battle between two longtime rivals for table-tennis gold. In the Netherlands, these Olympics were mostly about swimming. In Cameroon, they were about soccer.</p>
        <p>The Olympic Games, it is easy to forget, are  no monolith. Because it is human nature to cheer our own, the Olympics are experienced, and ultimately remembered, in different ways in different places. But the narratives all share a common theme, one of athletic prowess and determination overcoming the surrounding clutter -- the politics  of the Olympic bureaucracy, the cynicism, the specter of performance-enhancing drugs, the complaints about saccharine broadcasting and all the rest.</p>
        <p>To be sure, there are some global Olympic memories too, moments awe-inspiring enough to transcend parochialism and pull in all the separate narratives: Cathy Freeman, the Australian and Aboriginal sprinter, winning gold in the 400-meter race and carrying both her national and ethnic flag on her victory lap; Michael Johnson becoming the first man to win the 400-meter sprint in consecutive Olympics; China's Fu Mingxia becoming only the third diver to win four Olympic gold medals. Then there was the heartbreak of the Russian gymnast Svetlana Khorkina, victim of the Games' most notorious glitch, and thousands of swimming fans cheered Eric Moussambani from Equatorial Guinea in a 100-meter freestyle preliminary that he swam alone, and with much difficulty.</p>
        <p>The United States leads the medal count at Sydney, but the most significant American achievement may have been a fourth-place finish. It certainly was the most alarming one from the rest of the world's perspective, coming in the most popular of sports. Nobody told the men's soccer team that an aversion to the world's game has long been as much a defining trait of American exceptionalism as an aversion to the metric system.</p>
        <p>The team lost the bronze-medal match against Chile on Friday, but its mere presence in the semifinals was itself a historic achievement for American soccer. And because Olympic soccer has an under-23 age rule for men, this result augurs well for the nation's prospects. On the women's side, where Americans have been dominant, a silver medal came as a disappointment only because Mia Hamm, Julie Foudy, Brandi Chastain and the others had allowed our expectations to soar.</p>
        <p>There are plenty of other highlights on the American Olympic reel, including Tommy Lasorda's sheer ecstasy at leading mostly minor-league players to end Cuba's long reign in baseball. The women's softball team overcame three losses to win gold. Marion Jones exhibited dominating speed and desire. The swimming competition was marked by Misty Hyman's disbelief at pulling off the biggest upset of the swim meet in the 200-meter butterfly and Jenny Thompson's poise in winning her seventh Olympic gold medal in her career, the most won by an American woman. Some hasten to add that they all came in relay events, but we find that asterisk all the more ennobling.</p>
        <p>The marathon will close the festivities today, and the athletes will converge on Stadium Australia for one last celebration. They all helped secure  the ultimate victory, that of sports over the surrounding clutter.</p>
