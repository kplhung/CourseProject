        <p>Dr. Nora Vivian Odendahl and Dr. David Burdette Searls were married yesterday by the Rev. Christine Reed, a Unitarian Universalist minister, at Prospect House, the Princeton University faculty and staff club.</p>
        <p>Dr. Odendahl, 44, will keep her name. She is a test developer for the Educational Testing Service in Princeton, N.J. She graduated magna cum laude from Dartmouth College and received a doctorate in English from Princeton. She is the daughter of Alice Wallerstein of Chevy Chase, Md., and the late Alan Odendahl, and is the stepdaughter of Leibert B. Wallerstein. Her mother retired as an adjunct professor teaching English to foreign students at Montgomery College in Rockville, Md. The bride's father was an economist for the Small Business Administration in Washington.</p>
        <p>Dr. Searls, 49, is a vice president of SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals, in King of Prussia, Pa., overseeing a computerized study of the human genome. He is a graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and received a master's degree in computer science from the University of Pennsylvania, as well as a doctorate in biology from Johns Hopkins University. He is the son of Laura and Darrell Searls of Kennett Square, Pa. His mother retired as a teacher and secondary education administrator in Palos Heights, Ill. His father, also retired, was a consulting engineer and specialist in automated material-handling systems at the Austin Company, a design, construction and engineering firm in Cleveland.</p>
        <p>The bride and bridegroom became acquainted in October 1998, when Dr. Searls responded to a posting by Dr. Odendahl on match.com, an online dating service.</p>
        <p>''I was attracted to her background in English literature,'' Dr. Searls said. ''Because I am a scientist, I've always felt an attraction to the humanities -- to counter the science.'' He added, ''Her interest in biking and hiking were other areas where we were counterbalanced as well.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Odendahl said that what attracted her to him was how similar they were. He, too, had roots in academia. Both had made a transition to another career: for him, from academic biological research to research in the pharmaceutical industry; for her, from completing doctoral training for a teaching career to working as a test developer.</p>
        <p>After a week or two of exchanging phone calls and e-mails, they met for a date on Penn's Landing in Philadelphia, on a tall ship converted into a restaurant.</p>
        <p>''I thought it was a charming idea,'' Dr. Odendahl said. ''I had mentioned that I had written my doctoral dissertation thesis on Melville and enjoyed writing it.''</p>
