        <p>The inflatable rabbit robot cruised the aisles at the Hyatt Regency playing an electronic version of ''It's A Small World.''</p>
        <p>Unfortunately for the visitors, the furry bundle of electrons did not have much trouble negotiating its way around the smattering of people in the exhibition area.</p>
        <p>For three days last month, a delegation of 150 Chinese businesspeople from 52 companies came to New Jersey to try to raise interest among New Jersey companies in trade and investment opportunities in Zhejiang Province.</p>
        <p>''Mainly they are looking for guangxi -- relationship building,'' said Albert Chu, a consultant from Randolph who coordinated the China Zheijiang 2000 Economic and Trade Fair, held at the Hyatt Regency.</p>
        <p>So far, Mr. Chu said, textiles and garments had been the province's most successful export items. And indeed, booths at the fair were splashed with silks and other fabrics as well as ready-to-wear clothing. He noted that in the past, businesses in the province had supplied such American manufacturers as Ann Taylor and Liz Claiborne. Other exhibits touted small electronics items, appliances, tea, Christmas lights, biodegradable food containers and toys.</p>
        <p>Gao Yuzhi, vice director general of the Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Bureau of Zheijiang Province, said through a translator: ''We came not only to sell. We have over 100 investment projects that are looking for investors,'' particularly in the pharmaceutical, chemical and health-care industries.</p>
        <p>For the past several years, the province -- which has a population of more than 40 million -- had exhibited at the Jacob Javits Convention Center in Manhattan, and on this day the Chinese seemed a bit stunned by the difference between the two locations.</p>
        <p>''We're happy with the reception we've received in New Jersey,'' Wang Huifen, an exhibitor, said through a translator. ''But we would have preferred seeing more people here.'' About 300 came the first day, but traffic slowed to a trickle on the second and third days, and walking into the Hyatt seemed like entering a hotel in Beijing, since Asians far outnumbered Americans.</p>
        <p>Despite its disappointment at the small turnout, the delegation, which met with Governor Whitman during its stay, was determined to pursue trade with New Jersey because of the state's economic influence.</p>
        <p>New Jersey has the eighth largest economy in the country, and a gross state product of $327 billion, the governor's office said. If it were a country, New Jersey would have the 16th-largest economy in the world.</p>
        <p>In addition, the Chinese province has a long relationship with the state and with Union County. Zheijiang and New Jersey are sister states, and Wenzhou, another city in the province, has been a sister city with Union County for the past 19 years -- though there has been little trade between them. Mr. Chou said Chinese officials had hoped to hold the fair in Union County, but they were unable to find a place that would accommodate the delegation.</p>
        <p>To be sure, many Chinese provinces have trade fairs in the United States. ''It is one of the ways to promote Chinese manufacturers and products,'' said Zhang Jie, third secretary of the commercial office of the Chinese Embassy in Washington. ''It enhances the friendly exchange between the United States and the provinces and helps to publicize Chinese products.''</p>
        <p>As for Zheijiang, Ms. Gao said her province and New Jersey had much in common. Like New Jersey, Zheijiang is neighbors with a large and influential city -- its main city, Hangzhou, is about 100 miles from Shanghai. The province's economy is ranked fourth in China, Ms. Gao said. The United States is the province's top exporter, buying $2.4 billion in products last year, or nearly 19 percent of its total export volume. In turn, Zheijiang bought $579 million in goods from the United States last year. The delegation listed General Electric, Motorola, Pepsi and Merck among the companies that have done business in the province.</p>
        <p>When it comes to business, however, the differences between the two cultures remain significant, said Mr. Chu, who is involved in training efforts in China, directed by Kean University under the sponsorship of Union County.</p>
        <p>''They need help not only with language, but also with professional and management skills'' for business and government officials, Mr. Chu said.</p>
        <p>Still, Ms. Gao of the trade bureau said that economic reforms under way would certainly help sharpen her nation's business acumen because the Chinese now have the money to pay for training. Moreover, she said, China's recent entry into the World Trade Organization would accelerate the pace of business modernization.</p>
        <p>''One point of this visit is to expose people to America,'' Mr. Chu said. ''Many of these people have never been out of the country before, and don't know what to expect.'' He said the visitors needed to learn more about Westerners, even seemingly small details like the fact that smoking is far less acceptable here than in China.</p>
        <p>While some companies at the fair were government-owned, there was also a mix of privately held businesses as well as several joint ventures. Provincial officials said they hoped that fairs like this one would spawn new companies.</p>
        <p>Ms. Gao said she and her colleagues were determined to return to New Jersey. ''Through this exchange, both sides can win,'' she said. ''We have had good meetings with the New Jersey governor and with New Jersey businesses.'' Looking around the near-empty lobby, she added, ''But it is far from New York.''</p>
