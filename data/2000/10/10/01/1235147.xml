        <p>Keith Rodan fell in love with the million-dollar view from the roof of his old apartment on Freeman Street, from which he could see the entire East Side of Manhattan spread out like a picture postcard.  But there was a blight on the horizon.</p>
        <p>''There was a sludge tank in the middle of it all,'' Mr. Rodan said.</p>
        <p>Today, Mr. Rodan is the tank's biggest fan. Along with Meta Brunzema, an architect, Mr. Rodan, who is a videographer, has devised a plan to convert the waterfront tank -- a 52-foot-high concrete tower that holds treated sewage -- into an environmentally advanced community center that would include a cantilevered rooftop cafe (''think the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence,'' reads a description) and a grotto-type swimming pool. The tower is scheduled to be shut down in 2003.</p>
        <p>''It's not going to be just a functional institutional kind of place but something that could be luxurious,'' Mr. Rodan said. He promised that the tower's walls would be sandblasted to remove any lingering odors.</p>
        <p>A blueprint for waterfront development in Greenpoint, drawn up by the Center for Community Environmental Development at Pratt Institute, encourages reuse of the tower. Ms. Brunzema said she and Mr. Rodan had been inspired by both that plan and by a similar project in  Germany, in which a natural-gas tank was transformed into a diving pool.</p>
        <p>Plans for the Greenpoint tower project were submitted Thursday to Community Board 1.</p>
        <p>Joseph Vance, co-chairman of the Greenpoint Waterfront Association for Parks and Planning, said that as an architect he was attracted to the idea. But, he added, ''It probably doesn't have a high reality factor.'' There is currently no price tag attached to the project.</p>
        <p>One thing both Mr. Vance and Mr. Rodan agree on is that all Greenpoint deserves those million-dollar views. As a Waterfront Association official, Mr. Vance has been fighting for a waterfront park on land surrounding the sludge tower, near the point where Newtown Creek meets the East River. A small park is nearby, but it ends frustratingly in a tall fence just a few feet from the water's edge.</p>
        <p>If the proposed pool is built in the sludge tower, Greenpoint residents will be able to savor the views while frolicking in the water.</p>
        <p>As Ms. Brunzema, an expert in swimming pool design, described the project, ''It would be the most unique swimming experience in New York City.''</p>
