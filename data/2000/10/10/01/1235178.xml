        <p>IT was largely the romantic obsession of male writers and moviemakers that first elevated boxing from barroom backwater to relative respectability early in the 20th century. From Damon Runyon's columns in The New York American, Hemingway's ruminations on the ''sweet science'' and Clifford Odets's play ''Golden Boy,'' to Norman Mailer's discourse on the Thrilla in Manilla, and Martin Scorsese's ''Raging Bull,'' boxing has long stood as a metaphor for male angst and aggression. The lawlessness of the boxing establishment -- still evident today -- invited riffs on exploitation and the corruptibility of the soul.</p>
        <p>But now a new wave of boxing chroniclers has stepped into the ring -- namely, women -- and the books and movies they are making present a very different image.</p>
        <p>On Friday, ''Girl Fight,'' which won the top prize for drama at the Sundance Film Festival, opened amid a clamor of publicity for its unknown star, Michelle Rodriguez, and its unsentimental depiction of a woman channeling her rage by training to compete as a featherweight. ''Shadow Boxers,'' a stylish documentary that spotlights Lucia Rijker, widely considered the world's best woman in the ring, will have its premiere on the Sundance channel in February after a national run in theaters. ''On the Ropes,'' another documentary, with Tyrene Manson, an aspiring pro, was nominated for an Oscar last year. And Kate Sekules, a British journalist who fought professionally, has just published her memoir, ''The Boxer's Heart: How I Learned to Love the Ring'' (Villard).</p>
        <p>The new literature and films by and about women in the ring avoid the heroic, romantic cliches of ''Rocky'' and ''The Champ.'' The intrigue surrounding men's boxing is owed to the collision of testosterone, cash and machismo. But what gives the writing and filmmaking about women's boxing its resonance is that it touches on issues like body image, the balancing of femininity and aggression and the struggle for recognition in a male arena.</p>
        <p>Women who box are still considered marginal, if not odd, by sports fans. Cheering on two women trying to knock each other senseless makes many spectators uneasy. But if history is a guide, the new wave of books and movies may bring the sport into the cultural mainstream.</p>
        <p>One reason that the new genre of boxing stories is less sentimental may be that the storytellers are writing from their own experience. The men who mythologized boxing generally were spectators. In fact, the cultural gulf between them and the fighters, largely poor and often illiterate, was enormous.</p>
        <p>But Ms. Sekules, who has the upper-crust accent and chiseled good looks of Christiane Amanpour, boxed professionally for a couple of years in the late 1990's. The director and producer of ''Shadow Boxers,'' Katya Bankowsky, was a Golden Gloves competitor. So was Karyn Kusama, the writer and director of ''Girl Fight.''</p>
        <p>That these women could be both fighters and writers is no fluke. Many of the women who are drawn to boxing are well educated and accomplished in white collar professions. Ms. Bankowsky, a freelance television commercial producer, graduated from Yale University.</p>
        <p>So did Dee Hamaguchi, an architect-turned-New York City schoolteacher, who was responsible in 1995 for getting the Golden Gloves, the venerable amateur tournament in New York, to include women.</p>
        <p>Rosalie Parker, the national featherweight champion, attended Harvard University and is earning a graduate degree in international relations. Tenley Zinke, a Smith College graduate, is a fashion publicist who competed in the 1999 Golden  Gloves finals.</p>
        <p>''They say that men box to get out of the ghetto,'' said Ms. Sekules, who is the travel editor of Food &amp; Wine magazine. ''I joke that boxing was my way into the ghetto.''</p>
        <p>Since the ''aeroboxing'' workouts voguish in health clubs in the early 90's, record numbers of women have now begun to duke it out in sanctioned bouts on amateur and professional levels. (As might be expected, New York City, with its large percentage of fitness-conscious, competitive women, has the largest and most accomplished cadre of competitive boxers in the country.)</p>
        <p>''There's no question that the kind of women who box competitively is much more upscale than the men who do it,'' said Bruce Silverglade, the owner of Gleason's Gym in the waterfront area of Brooklyn known as Dumbo, where 116 women are members, including 7 professionals and 16 amateurs. That accounts for about 15 percent of his total membership.</p>
        <p>''They are very serious about everything -- from their jobs to their schooling to boxing,'' Mr. Silverglade said.</p>
        <p>Since the Golden Gloves began allowing women to fight in 1995, the number of applicants has risen tenfold. At the championships in April at Madison Square Garden, nearly 20 percent of the entrants were women. Nationally, there are more than 1,500 women who are amateur boxers and 400 who are professionals, including the headline-grabbing daughters of Muhammad Ali, Joe Frazier and George Foreman. There is a strong movement to make women's boxing an Olympic sport in 2004.</p>
        <p>Whereas men who box competitively do it largely for the money, that is not an option for women. They are rarely offered more than $10,000 a bout, even for championship fights. Their reasons for donning the gloves are far more nuanced. ''Or insane,'' as Ms. Sekules said, joking.</p>
        <p>''I fight because it's the ultimate challenge, because it stretches my idea of my self,'' Ms. Bankowsky said. ''Having grace and elegance bang up against violence and aggression is exhilarating.''</p>
        <p>Far from the stereotype bruiser, many of the women are also undeniably feminine. Ms. Rijker, who has striking cheekbones and a piercing gaze, was recently cast in a remake of ''Rollerball'' by the director John McTiernan. Ms. Bankowsky, whose aquamarine eyes accent her pale skin, dyes her hair white-blond and wears it fashionably cropped.</p>
        <p>Ms. Kusama believes that such divergence from expectations is what makes the spectacle of women's boxing compelling. ''It's inherently more dramatic to watch two women hit each other,'' she said. ''It brings the point home that boxing is basically sanctioned violence.''</p>
        <p>Watching women fight must raise the question: aren't they worried about getting their faces broken? The ring career of Ms. Zinke, the fashion publicist, puts the risks and rewards in sharp relief, suggesting as well the precarious state of women's boxing. Slender and gamine at barely 100 pounds, with straight teeth and a flawless nose, she works in an appearance-conscious job, for Paul Wilmot &amp; Associates, which specializes in fashion clients.</p>
        <p>Ms. Zinke, 29, was drawn to boxing by her boyfriend, who boxed in the 1996 Olympics. She began training in 1998, and less than a year later, she found out she would be competing in the Golden Gloves finals at Madison Square Garden, facing a tough opponent from the Glen Cove Police Boxing Club. The fight would be broadcast live on the MSG network.</p>
        <p>A week before the fight, she asked a friend to photograph her nose. ''I figured if it got broken, I'd want to get it fixed back to the way it was,'' she said. A week before the fight, Ms. Zinke was sparring and wound up with two black eyes and a swollen nose. On the street, passers-by looked at her with compassion, assuming she was a victim of domestic violence. Two days later she had to preside over an event to reintroduce  Helena Rubinstein products in the United States. ''Luckily, the client knew what I'd been doing, and she thought it was great,'' Ms. Zinke recalled.</p>
        <p>She lost the Madison Square Garden fight, though she lasted all three rounds. Her nose remained intact. ''It was the most amazing experience,'' she said. ''All my life I had been judged by my poise and feminity, and I wanted to show myself and the world that there was a very different side to me. It's horrible to get hit, but it does help you prove one thing to yourself -- that you can endure it and still keep going.''</p>
        <p>Another aspect of boxing that women writers and moviemakers have dealt with is the continuing corruption of the fight game itself. ''It's a shady, lawless business,'' Ms. Bankowsky said, ''and lots of people get hurt in lots of ways. I think that's crucial to the story.'' In ''Shadow Boxers,'' she follows Ms. Rijker, the championship fighter, through the world, cataloging the murky dealings of promoters and fight denizens.</p>
        <p>One of the biggest problems is that there is still virtually no infrastructure for women's boxing. Although the ranks of women who are accomplished fighters are swelling, there is even less of a codified ranking system for them than there is for men. That means that there is no way properly to pair women in official bouts. And promoters -- who control the fight game in a way not permitted in any other sport -- are still loath to invest heavily in women who are serious about fighting. They prefer to represent novelty acts like Mia St. John, a Playboy model, who posed on the magazine's cover nude with boxing gloves.</p>
        <p>Bob Arum, the promoter, dropped Ms. Rijker for Ms. St. John last year. ''Women are still outsiders in the boxing community,'' Ms. Kusama said.</p>
        <p>But the chroniclers of the fight game expect all that to change. Laila Ali, who has a lot of talent but little experience, the pros say, will give the sport a boost if she can be molded into a real fighter. An even bigger jolt would come if the International Olympic Committee allowed women to box. That would make a big difference, said Seth Abraham, who controls programming for HBO and its parent company, Time Warner. It would help develop and showcase a whole new generation of women.</p>
        <p>Unlike ESPN, HBO does not regularly televise women's matches. But Mr. Abraham says he is following the sport closely, scouting for a bout that will make the grade. ''In the meanwhile, the more people write books about it and make movies about it the better,'' he said. ''That's how men's boxing came into its own. First came the newspaper columns and the books and the films. Then came the crowds.''</p>
