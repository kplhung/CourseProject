        <p>FOR an eight-year run as president and chief operating officer of the Oracle Corporation, the world's second-largest software publisher, Ray Lane was the un-Ellison. While Larry Ellison flew his fighter jet, won yacht races, glowered on magazine covers and, as founder and chief executive, served as Oracle's swashbuckling public persona, Mr. Lane was the accessible, old-school corporate veteran back at the office.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lane's run ended with an abrupt resignation in June. The company issued a civil press release. ''I am grateful to Ray for his efforts,'' it quoted Mr. Ellison as saying. ''He will be missed.''</p>
        <p>But in a recent interview, Mr. Lane, 53, said he had been forced out, a rupture he called an inevitable result of Mr. Ellison's desire to reassume control of a company whose daily operations he had left largely to Mr. Lane.</p>
        <p>''I was running 90-plus percent of Oracle -- just about everything but development, which was Larry's,'' Mr. Lane said, referring to work on new products. ''I didn't feel I was missing anything. I kind of got that C.E.O. feeling.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ellison, meanwhile, was presented with the prospect of overtaking Microsoft and his archrival, Bill Gates, the only person with a larger fortune.  With the Internet making Oracle software that much more crucial, Mr. Ellison apparently wanted that C.E.O. feeling all for himself again. He began shrinking Mr. Lane's role.</p>
        <p>''Had he not been so aggressive at taking some of these actions and finally forcing my departure because I just couldn't take it anymore, I think I would have left within a year anyway,'' Mr. Lane said. ''Or I think he would have fired me.'' Mr. Lane did not even resign in person, but over the telephone.</p>
        <p>Neither Mr. Ellison nor an Oracle spokesman would respond to Mr. Lane's comments despite several requests.</p>
        <p>With a net worth of about $850 million, Mr. Lane, who remains on the Oracle board, did not need that job, or any other. He sought more personal balance. ''If I could simply eliminate travel and unproductive meetings, I'd get half my life back,'' Mr. Lane said, explaining why he turned down offers to lead other companies. ''If I had just a few hundred thousand in the bank, then I'd probably take a C.E.O. job.''</p>
        <p>Instead, Mr. Lane became one of 10 general partners at Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers, the venture capital firm in Menlo Park, Calif., a post akin to Silicon Valley sainthood.</p>
        <p>Still high-powered? Mr. Lane describes his new job as a relief. ''It's 10 minutes from my house,'' he said. ''I don't expect to be living on planes. I have no desire to get to the office before 9 and I won't be taking any business dinners after 7.''</p>
        <p>He plans to focus more on his family. He has a son not yet 2 years old with his second wife, Trisha, and a daughter is expected in November.</p>
        <p>His current course is not the Ellison way, Mr. Lane said. ''Larry wants to be the richest man in the world. He doesn't have a wife,'' Mr. Lane said. (Mr. Ellison has been divorced three times.)  ''What's important to him is going down in the annals of history of the computer industry as having owned the Internet era, the way Bill Gates owned the PC era.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lane, a graduate of West Virginia University, was seasoned at companies like I.B.M., in marketing and product management, and Electronic Data Systems, as a division vice president.</p>
        <p>In 1992, when Oracle's stock price plunged, Mr. Ellison recruited Mr. Lane from Booz Allen &amp; Hamilton, the consulting firm. He was in charge of the information systems group, which advised companies on how to take advantage of information technology.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ellison tapped him to discipline the Silicon Valley giant, which specializes in database software. Mr. Lane became Oracle's ballast. ''I enjoyed the role,'' he said. ''The difference between us was good for shareholders.'' During his years, sales of Oracle's software -- used by companies and organizations to store, manage and sort databases, or information warehouses -- increased tenfold. The stock became an investor favorite.</p>
        <p>Analysts and colleagues credit Mr. Lane for Oracle's expansion into software that handles billing, inventories, hotel and airline reservations and the like, building its consulting business, consolidating its European operations and establishing an online business-to-business marketplace.</p>
        <p>''He brought order and structure into the picture,'' said Lawrence White, vice president for product strategy at Oracle from 1985 to 1998, and now marketing vice president at the Tenfold Corporation in Foster City, Calif. ''The thing that was unique about Ray is that he was intelligent enough and fast enough that he was able to maintain Ellison's respect for a long time. That's very difficult to do.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lane says he had a major role in bringing the company back from the brink. ''I'm not shy about taking part of the credit, along with Jeff Henley and Larry Ellison. The three of us turned Oracle around.'' Mr. Henley is chief financial officer.</p>
        <p>Some former colleagues at Oracle say Mr. Lane made himself expendable by recruiting and training other skilled managers, and by developing a system that was not as adaptable as Mr. Ellison wanted.</p>
        <p>''In the end, Ray could come up with a very elegant organization structure,'' Mr. White said. ''But it was sometimes beyond the grasp of some people at Oracle, and maybe not flexible enough to take on new opportunities in the Internet space.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lane, however, says his management style is more humane and flexible than Mr. Ellison's. ''He looks at skills, I.Q,'' he said. ''But he isn't really into any other factors of the human beings that are part of the business. The human beings, the way they act, the way they team, affects their delivery, affects their performance.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ellison, said Mr. Lane, has gained added confidence in his own management skills from his belief that Oracle could do with less of a human element. ''I heard him say, 'The Internet has given me new knowledge that a company can work like a computer,' '' Mr. Lane said.</p>
        <p>If not amicable, Mr. Lane said, the split was for the best. ''Larry's happy without me,'' he said. ''I'm happy without him. We are two very happy people.''</p>
