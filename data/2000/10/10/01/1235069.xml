        <p>SO your child wants a birthday party and you'd like to make it special. You would walk through fire to avoid holding the party at the local fast-food joint, yet you don't feel up to leading games for 20 shrieking children.</p>
        <p>Or perhaps your family is holding a reunion. You'd like help in setting the right atmosphere to avoid the tense discussions on who should have inherited Aunt Mabel's tea set.</p>
        <p>Why not hire an entertainer? A vast array of performers are available for children's parties or adult gatherings, and many charge surprisingly reasonable rates. Here is a sampling of entertainers for hire.</p>
        <p>Magic</p>
        <p>''The Amazing Andy'' is the name of Andy Charney's one-man show of juggling, magic tricks and making balloon animals. Mr. Charney, of Orange, says 95 percent of his 500 annual performances are for children, at day-care centers, libraries and private parties. His show lasts 30 to 45 minutes and ends with a child pulling a rabbit out of a hat.</p>
        <p>He performs for adults, too, but the show is a bit different. ''I juggle machetes for the adults, but I wouldn't do that in front of kids,'' he said. His usual price is $95, though that can increase depending on travel time. Information: (203) 795-4733.</p>
        <p>Clowning Around</p>
        <p>Any number of clowns are for hire, appropriate for children's parties or adult occasions. For one-stop shopping, call Clown City in Norwich at (860) 889-1000 and talk to the owners, Susan Conley and Douglas Chapman. Clown City sells clown supplies and also offers a 10-week, $200 course in clowning. In its decade of existence it has trained 500 clowns from all over the state.</p>
        <p>Most clowns will juggle and perform magic tricks for children, Ms. Conley said, and usually charge $100 to entertain 10 children for an hourlong show that includes magic and making balloon animals. Some clowns will also paint faces. That takes about half an hour longer and will add $25 to the bill.</p>
        <p>Expect to pay extra for traveling expenses, starting at $20, if travel time exceeds 15 minutes each way. Add an extra $1 per child if the party has more than 10 children. It is also possible to hire a face painter for about $60 an hour. Clown City also has these names.</p>
        <p>The Animal Kingdom</p>
        <p>For something different as well as educational, you can call Rick McPherson, experiential education director of the Waterford Country School at (860) 442-9454, extension 270. Parents planning a party can ask him to bring the traveling zoo to their homes, specifying large animals, small animals or a combination for children to learn about and view. He stressed that this was not a petting zoo. Those who ask him to bring large animals will be treated to the sight of an 18-foot trailer pulling up with animals like a donkey, a llama, sheep or a cow. (Extra fun can be had in catching the expressions on your neighbors' faces as the cargo is unloaded.)</p>
        <p>Mr. McPherson said he used portable pens for the large animals. Small animals can include a prairie dog, a red-tailed hawk, an owl and a crow that will perch on people's shoulders.</p>
        <p>Mr. McPherson also has seven snakes. His favorites are a corn snake, about three feet long, and an equally docile red-tailed  boa constrictor (seven and a half feet).</p>
        <p>The small animal show is $50 for an hourlong performance. The large animal show costs $100 an hour for a minimum of two hours. It's also possible to take the party to the Waterford Country School to view the same animals. For $4 a person, you also have access to a heated log cabin where your party can have cake after a trip to the zoo.</p>
        <p>Storytelling</p>
        <p>You can hire a storyteller for any occasion, from a bar mitzvah to a birthday party. One is Henry Savin, a New London resident and program director of the Jewish Center of Southeastern Connecticut. He is happy to tell tales to fit any occasion, but his first love is Jewish folk tales.</p>
        <p>Mr. Savin charges $250 for about 45 minutes, and he can be reached at (860) 447-0057.</p>
        <p>A directory of about 75 storytellers is available by calling the Connecticut Storytelling Center at (860) 439-2764, said the group's executive director, Ann Shapiro. The center is a nonprofit organization with offices at Connecticut College in New London, but it is not affiliated with the college. The directory includes information on which storytellers are appropriate for which audiences. Some prefer telling tales to young people, while others, like Katie Hereld of Cheshire, prefer adult settings. Some couples perform together; Ms. Shapiro, for example, combines storytelling and music with her husband, Tom Callinan.</p>
        <p>Music</p>
        <p>Gunar Saleen, a cellist formerly with the Greenwich Symphony who continues to play chamber recitals, keeps a directory of musicians who perform at private homes or parties. Mr. Saleen can be reached at (203) 637-5872. One of the musicians on the list, for example, is the harpist Wendy Lucas of New Canaan, whose charges start at $200. Occasionally Ms. Lucas pairs up with a flutist to play for private parties.</p>
