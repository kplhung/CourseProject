        <p>Domestic round-trip air fares rose $20 in early September when all of the major airlines except Southwest imposed a surcharge that the industry said is necessary to offset the recent increase in the price of jet fuel.</p>
        <p>The surtax, the second this year, was initiated by Continental Airlines and promptly matched by American, America West, Delta, Northwest, United, US Airways and T.W.A. -- airlines that carry about 90 percent of the nation's domestic passengers.</p>
        <p>In addition to Southwest -- which in March added a fuel surtax from $2 to $8 depending on the length of the flight, but said it would not go along with the latest hike -- AirTran Airways and most regional and low-fare airlines also have not added the surtax.</p>
        <p>Continental did not give details about its surtax decision, which was announced on the same day that crude-oil futures closed above $35.39 a barrel, the highest in nine years (it has since risen an additional $2).  (Airline fuel costs, like the cost of gasoline, move virtually in tandem with increases in the price of crude oil.) But Northwest said that each one-cent increase in the price of fuel costs the airline $29 million to $30 million.</p>
        <p>In addition, the airline industry trade group, the Air Transport Association, has estimated that fuel will cost the carriers $5.5 billion more this year than in 1999, when it cost $10.4 billion. Through June of this year, the latest month for which figures are available, aviation fuel was up 59.5 percent, compared with a 3.6 increase for all of 1999. The price of aviation fuel averaged 75 cents a gallon in that six-month period, compared with an average 53.1 cents a gallon in 1999 and 51.3 cents in 1998. Aviation fuel currently averages about $1 a gallon.</p>
