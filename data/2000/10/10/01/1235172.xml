        <p>PENNSYLVANIA is using traffic jams to generate more hits -- not fender-benders, but visits to its official site on the World Wide Web.</p>
        <p>The state has put its Web address -- www.state.pa.us -- across the bottom of its new blue, white and yellow license plates, albeit in type small enough that only those with excellent vision or a penchant for tailgating can see it.</p>
        <p>By June 2002, nine million of these 72 square-inch billboards will be issued in the state's first complete plate replacement since 1976.</p>
        <p>In introducing the new plates, Gov. Tom Ridge said, ''The old, faded yellow ones sent exactly the wrong signal.'' The right signal, he said, is to promote the state's high-technology prowess.</p>
        <p>So far, the strategy has worked, said Anthony Haubert, a spokesman for the state Department of Transportation. ''The number of hits on our Web site has increased dramatically,'' he said. ''While it could be due to a number of reasons, we do have the feeling that the deployment generated a lot of those inquiries.''</p>
        <p>He added that advertising the site helped to ''put the state at the forefront of technology and e-government.''</p>
        <p>And even if the new design has received mixed reviews in the Keystone State, the idea has caught on elsewhere. In 2002, Nebraska will introduce a license plate imprinted with its own Web address: www.state.ne.us.</p>
        <p>With several new cars promising built-in Internet access, will motorists succumb to the temptation to visit the Keystone State in cyberspace even as they cruise the Pennsylvania Turnpike in real time?</p>
