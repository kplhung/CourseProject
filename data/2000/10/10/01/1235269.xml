        <p>WHEN John Foley walks into a plush, full-service hotel, he has one thing inmind: theft.</p>
        <p>But he is on the preventive end of things.</p>
        <p>As vice president in Dallas for the Elsafe division of VingCard, which in turn is a part of Assa Abloyof Sweden, Mr. Foley leads a product development group that designs keyless hotel-room safes. One of its most recent versions, the M28, is it stop seller; it is large enough to accommodate what is often the business traveler's most valuable accessory a laptop computer.</p>
        <p>More than 65,000 M28's have been sold since their introduction in late 1998, many of them to chains like Marriott, Four Seasons and Hyatt. The safe is mounted on top of a minirefrigerator or bar in the room's armoire; one model comes with an internal electronic outlet, which can be used to charge the batteries of the laptop while it's inside. To gain access to the safe, a guest punches in a fourdigit code on a keypad; internal software lets employees monitor attempts to unlock the safe. An activity log can be printed for concerned guests.</p>
        <p>''We entered the market for very exclusive hotels,'' said Mr. Foley, who has been with Elsafe since 1987.''Today, it's a more massmarket product. The demands and needs have really changed.''</p>
        <p>Over all, Elsafe has 750,000 safes in hotels in 116 countries, and has re-ported annual sales growth of about 20 percent for the last five years.</p>
        <p>''Any hotel today purchasingsafes wants to have a safe largeenough to accommodate a laptop,''he said. ''It's a basic need.''</p>
