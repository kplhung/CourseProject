        <p>As campaign props, political spouses and children have long held a place somewhere beside red, white and blue bunting, yard signs, buttons and balloons. But this year, perhaps more than most, presidential politics has become a family affair.</p>
        <p>There was Laura Bush -- whose husband once promised that she would never have to deliver a political speech -- giving the first major address at the Republican National Convention. There was the little matter of that kiss Vice President Al Gore planted on his wife, Tipper, at the Democratic convention. Their daughter Karenna Gore Schiff has become a close adviser to Mr. Gore. And the story of Hadassah Lieberman's journey from the daughter of Holocaust survivors to the wife of the Democratic vice-presidential nominee has come up many times on the campaign trail.</p>
        <p>But the hardest-working family in this election cycle may be that of the Republican vice-presidential nominee, Dick Cheney. The whole family has gotten into the act. His wife, Lynne V. Cheney, a well-known figure in her own right, gives spirited speeches to warm up his audiences. His older daughter, Liz Cheney-Perry, is in charge of preparing him for the coming debate against his Democratic rival, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, and she arrived here today to oversee a mock debate. And his younger daughter, Mary, plays perhaps the most important role of all.</p>
        <p>''I think of her as sort of my aide-de-camp,'' Mr. Cheney said in a recent interview aboard his campaign plane. ''She keeps all the paper flow coming to me; everything sort of funnels through her. More than that, she knows me. She has no qualms about telling me when she thinks I'm wrong, or when I need to do something. Mary will always come in and lay it right on me. My experience over the years is that's invaluable in a campaign. Everybody wants a good relationship with the candidate -- not everybody will level with you. Mary levels with you.''</p>
        <p>Mary Cheney, 31, goes everywhere her father does. She rides in his campaign plane and travels in his motorcade, not in the fancy sedans that meet him at each stop but in staff vans. She wears an earphone attached to a walkie-talkie that keeps her in touch with press aides and advance teams. When Mr. Cheney's hotel lost all power recently in Chesterfield, Mo., she coordinated his move to a new hotel. When Mr. Cheney toured tornado-ravaged Xenia, Ohio, she was there to pass him a green Thermos so he could pour coffee for emergency workers.</p>
        <p>And she is the one responsible for keeping Mr. Cheney on schedule, raising her finger, making cutting gestures with her hands or otherwise letting him know when it is time to end his speeches to nursing home residents or high school students. ''The staff jokes about the lengths she will go to to get him off stage,'' Mrs. Cheney said.</p>
        <p>Before joining the campaign, Mary Cheney worked at the Coors Brewing Company, where she was a liaison to the gay and lesbian market. She left the company in June, expecting to begin seeking a business degree this fall at the University of Colorado at Denver, a plan she abandoned when her father joined the race. ''She quit work in June, thinking she would have a nice, relaxed summer,'' Mr. Cheney said, adding that she now plans to enroll at the University of Colorado at Boulder in the spring term.</p>
        <p>Though Mary Cheney has not been an outspoken advocate of gay and lesbian causes, her presence on her father's campaign led to a flurry of news media reports about her being gay. Mr. Cheney's aides said that her sexual orientation was not an issue on the campaign (''It's no big deal to anyone,'' a staff member said), and the Cheneys say they consider it a private family matter.</p>
        <p>''I'm simply not going to discuss that aspect of Mary's life,'' Mr. Cheney, 59, said of his daughter, who declined, through an aide, to be interviewed.</p>
        <p>The campaign has also thrown a wrench into the plans of Ms. Cheney-Perry, 34, who lives near the Cheneys' home in McLean, Va. Ms. Cheney-Perry, who worked in the State Department for five years before becoming a lawyer with White &amp; Case, assigned to an arm of the World Bank, took a maternity leave in March to have her third daughter, Grace. When her father was tapped to run for vice president, she, too, joined the fight. ''She just extended her maternity leave,'' Mr. Cheney said, noting that she is not drawing a salary from the firm.</p>
        <p>''She is in charge of debate preparation,'' Mr. Cheney said, explaining that she oversees research on the issues and on Senator Lieberman's positions, keeps the briefing papers coming and makes sure that people like Representative Rob Portman, the Ohio congressman who plays Mr. Lieberman in practice debates, show up when needed. She also calls her father several times a day with ideas and suggestions. Arguments are not wholly new to Ms. Cheney; as a student at the University of Chicago Law School, she won a moot court competition in her second year.</p>
        <p>At times, Mr. Cheney said a little ruefully, his daughters work in tandem. ''Sometimes Liz and Mary will conspire together, and say, 'You've got to get the old man to change his tie,' or some such thing,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Cheney explained that ''they liked it, but he wore it for three days.'' Mr. Cheney said, ''I didn't pay any attention.''</p>
        <p>Then there is Lynne Cheney, who is almost as big a draw on the trail as her husband. The Cheneys were high school sweethearts in Wyoming -- she was a baton twirler, he the captain of the football team -- and they celebrated their 36th wedding anniversary this summer at a Republican fund-raiser in Mississippi.</p>
        <p>Crowds seem to remember Mrs. Cheney best for her days as the voice from the right on CNN's ''Crossfire Sunday,'' if not her books or her tenure as head of the National Endowment for the Humanities in the Reagan and Bush administrations.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney says his wife is one of his closest advisers. Even before he was tapped to run for vice president, Mrs. Cheney, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, gave advice to Gov. George W. Bush on education policy in Texas and for his presidential campaign. It is an issue she has strong feelings about. In her book ''Telling the Truth'' (Simon &amp; Schuster, 1995), she laments that political correctness and relativism have corrupted the nation's culture and educational institutions.</p>
        <p>All this has given Mrs. Cheney an unusually high profile for a would-be second lady. This month, she testified before Congress, taking the entertainment industry to task after a Federal Trade Commission report found that the industry regularly marketed adult-rated materials to children and teenagers. The following Sunday, she appeared on three morning talk shows -- hardly usual for the wife of a vice-presidential candidate -- talking more about the entertainment industry and criticizing Mr. Gore for attending a fund-raiser with media moguls where, she said, ''X-rated jokes'' were told. And this week, the campaign sent Mrs. Cheney on what for it has become the politically delicate task of addressing the annual convention of the Christian Coalition in Washington.</p>
        <p>On the stump, though, Mrs. Cheney sheds the persona of the outspoken conservative academic. She invites no controversy in her role as the loving spouse and upbeat warm-up act for her husband. She adds dynamism to the ticket, plunging eagerly into rope lines, shaking hands, posing for pictures and making small talk.</p>
        <p>She tries to soften her husband's stiff, somber image by telling people folksy anecdotes about his boyhood and early life: how he rode the rails with his grandfather, a cook on the Union Pacific (''He learned that cooking is an honorable male occupation.''); his early jobs delivery papers, busing tables and stirring fudge (''It killed his sweet tooth.''); and her doubts that he can go on late-night talk shows and sing, as did his rival, Senator Lieberman (''He flunked choir.'').</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney plays George Burns to her Gracie Allen. When he takes the stage, he sometimes allows himself a joke, telling crowds that he has ''a Republican marriage.'' Dwight D. Eisenhower's victory, Mr. Cheney explains, led to a shake-up at the Agriculture Department, forcing his father, who worked there, to relocate to Wyoming.</p>
        <p>''If it hadn't been for that great Republican victory of 1952, I never would have moved to Wyoming, and I never would have met Lynne, and Lynne would have married somebody else,'' Mr. Cheney says, pausing a beat.</p>
        <p>Then comes the punch line: ''And when I was telling that to some folks the other night, Lynne said, 'Yeah, and now he would be running for vice president.' ''</p>
