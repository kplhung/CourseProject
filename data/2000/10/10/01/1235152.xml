        <p>The city's oldest surviving synagogue building, a Gothic Revival structure at 172 Norfolk Street that reopened as a house of worship last year after a quarter-century of disuse, is acquiring a central piece of its past, a Torah with possible deep roots in the synagogue's history.</p>

        <p>The city's oldest surviving synagogue building, a Gothic Revival structure at 172 Norfolk Street that reopened as a house of worship last year after a quarter-century of disuse, is acquiring a central piece of its past, a Torah with possible deep roots in the synagogue's history.</p>
        <p>The synagogue was built in 1850 and abandoned in the mid-1970's. In 1986, a Spanish artist named Angel Orensanz acquired and painstakingly restored it as an arts center. Last year, a congregation, the first in decades, returned; known as the Shul of New York, it shares the space.</p>
        <p>As the congregation expanded, one member, Bonnie Kozek, took it upon herself to find a Torah. The Torah, the first five books of the Old Testament and the holiest object in a synagogue, is typically handwritten on parchment scrolls; the synagogue had been using a paper facsimile.</p>
        <p>Ms. Kozek's search led her to Rabbi Philip Hiat, a scholar in residence at Central Synagogue in Manhattan who has a reputation for hunting down such documents. Rabbi Hiat had heard of a man in Brooklyn named Harold Novick who wanted to sell a scroll once owned by a synagogue in Texas. In July, a meeting was held to transfer the scripture. ''Hiat is an expert in Torah calligraphy,'' recalled Burt Aaron Siegel, rabbi of the Shul of New York. ''He opened the Torah, began looking at it and told us it came from a place called Slonim. We just looked at each other in silence.''</p>
        <p>Slonim is a hamlet in Belarus, a country once ruled by Poland. Many Jews who had fled Slonim in the early 20th century to escape persecution ended up on the Lower East Side, and many of them prayed at the Congregation Anshe Slonim (''People of Slonim''), which in 1921 moved into 172 Norfolk Street.</p>
        <p>For a half-century, the building was their spiritual home. By the 1970's, however, the original worshipers had dispersed and the congregation disbanded.</p>
        <p>At a ceremony last month, the Torah was carried into the synagogue and ''wedded'' to the new congregation. It remains there under lock and key in a newly constructed ark. Although the scroll's history is uncertain, in Ms. Kozek's view, ''The Torah found its way back home.''</p>
