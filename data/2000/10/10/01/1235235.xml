        <p>The creator of the stainless-steel gull-winged sports car is trying a comeback. John Z. DeLorean declared personal bankruptcy last year and then was evicted from his 434-acre estate in New Jersey hunt country after it was sold at auction. Now that he is finally close to settling with creditors for the DeLorean Motor Company, Mr. DeLorean, 75, is starting a new online retail company, DeLorean Time.</p>
        <p>Its first product will be a $3,495 watch made of -- what else? -- stainless steel.</p>
        <p>Fred Dellis, who designed the company's Web site, www.deloreantime.com, said that with the proceeds, Mr. DeLorean hoped to start a new automobile company. ''Each one of the watches carries with it a certificate entitling you to buy one of the new cars,'' said Mr. DeLorean in footage on the site. But no prototypes are yet available.</p>
        <p>Buyers will have to be patient for the watches, too. They must make down payments of $1,750 and will then have to wait up to 10 months.</p>
