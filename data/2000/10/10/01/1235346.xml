        <p>Wisconsin is synonymous with cheese, and for potatoes, you've got to go with Idaho. But when it comes to combining the two, New Jersey takes the cake. (I do not know which state takes the cake for cake.) I'm talking, of course, about cheese fries. You were thinking maybe potatoes au gratin? Sorry, mon ami; this is the New Jersey section, not Le Figaro. Driving along Roosevelt Avenue in Carteret, I believed I had stumbled across the Cheese Fry Holy Grail. Could it be -- a restaurant named Cheese Fries? With a 24-hour drive-through window? That's what it said on the bright yellow sign just off the road. But it was not to be. The establishment was, in fact, Burger Express. Had I approached from the other direction, I would have thought its name was Fried Chicken. Entering Burger Express was like stepping back in time, into my beloved world of 1970's fast food: dark wood paneling, rounded corners on rectangular windows. The ambience harked back to a simpler, pre-McNugget era, before environmental activists sprung the Quarter Pounder from its plastic foam cage. Alas, I was derailed from my retro reverie by an unmistakable train theme, with faded railroad photos on the wall, and a burger named The Locomotive ($3.84). I ordered a Big Broiler with cheese ($2.34), and admired some atypical fast-food menu items, such as grilled cheese with tuna ($3.04) and grits ($1.74). But let's face it, I was there for the cheese fries ($2.55). They came in a generous portion of crisp, hot crinkle-cuts, smothered in a hearty but not overpowering cheese sauce. Served in a plastic foam container, no less. To the young entrepreneurs out there: The restaurant name Cheese Fries is apparently still available. I am easily reached for consulting.</p>
