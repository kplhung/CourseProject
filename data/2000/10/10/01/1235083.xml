        <p>Nearly every commuter has a favorite cell phone story.</p>
        <p>Take the time some bus passengers found it impossible to ignore a woman shouting about some very personal matters.</p>
        <p>''I mean the entire bus could hear,'' said John Cahill, a 37-year old lawyer, waiting for a bus to Manhattan here one recent morning. People began yelling at her, Mr. Cahill recalled. Someone said: ''Are you for real, lady? We don't want to hear about your boyfriend's problems.''</p>
        <p>Or there is the constant ringing. Sometimes, complained Benjamin Berman, 38, a production manager for an apparel company, it's even a tune. ''I've heard 'Mary Had a Little Lamb' in digital variations about 300 different times,'' Mr. Berman said.</p>
        <p>Now, one New Jersey transit company, DeCamp Bus Lines, has done something about it. It has banned virtually all cell phone use by its passengers.</p>
        <p>In taking the drastic step, DeCamp became the first transportation company in the state -- and perhaps one of the first in the nation -- to do so, said Dee Yankoskie, a spokeswoman for the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association.</p>
        <p>For now, at least, none of the other bus companies in the state are expected to follow DeCamp's lead. Officials of several companies said they had not received enough complaints to warrant a ban.</p>
        <p>But apparently the phone was ringing off the hook at DeCamp.</p>
        <p>''We have had disruptions on the buses between patrons who get into shouting matches,'' said Gary P. Pard, the company's vice president for operations, who instituted the ban on Sept. 8.</p>
        <p>''I don't think we've had any physical contact yet,'' Mr. Pard added, although he noted that even before the ban a bus driver had ejected a woman from his bus for refusing to end a cell phone conversation that he found distracting. The driver was later reprimanded.</p>
        <p>DeCamp's move comes at a time when there is a growing sentiment against the use of cell phones in public places. So far, airlines regulate their use, and an increasing number of restaurants are asking patrons to shut off the phones. And in a pilot program, Amtrak recently instituted a ''quiet car'' on one train traveling the Philadelphia-Washington route ''for people who want to escape cell phones,'' said a company spokeswoman, Karina Van Veen.</p>
        <p>''It started by customer demand, and customers enforce it,'' Ms. Van Veen said. If it is successful, she added, a quiet car might be instituted on other trains.</p>
        <p>Since the relatively recent proliferation if cell phones, many states have considered banning people from using cell phones while driving, though none have done so yet. As a result, a handful of municipalities have taken it on themselves to ban drivers from using the phones, including Marlboro Township in Monmouth County -- the only town in the state to do so. The Jersey City council approved a ban on Sept. 13, but Mayor Bret Schundler vetoed the measure, insisting it was an issue for the state to decide.</p>
        <p>In New Jersey, where similar bills have languished in legislative committee for more than half a year, the Senate passed a joint resolution last month that would create a 17-member task force to study the issue. The Assembly has yet to vote on the resolution.</p>
        <p>As for DeCamp's move, James Berzok, a spokesman for ther state Department of Tranportation, said that to his knowledge there were no statutes or regulations ''that would get the department involved in this decision.''</p>
        <p>DeCamp, which is based here, says it serves 9,000 riders a day on about 150 trips between Essex County and Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Before the ban was instituted, Mr. Pard of DeCamp said, he had received complaints from drivers who had to intervene in disputes among passengers and also found it difficult to differentiate between a phone ringing and the passenger stop buzzer.</p>
        <p>In April, signs were posted on the partitions behind drivers and on bus windows asking passengers to keep calls to a minimum and to speak softly. Mr. Pard said that worked for a while, but soon the complaints began again. In May, more strongly worded messages went up, but many of these were ripped down. ''They could have at least taken down the Scotch tape too,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Finally, in June, he posted the ban. He did not mince words. Cell phone users who get angry with DeCamp over the ban should look in the mirror, he wrote. ''Common sense and a little decency would have avoided this abhorrent confrontation, but alas, we must consider the greater good,'' he wrote. ''NO MORE!!!!!!!''</p>
        <p>''All I can tell you is my drivers have not been coming back in saying</p>
        <p>they're having a problem,'' Mr. Pard said. ''I'm assuming they've pulled in their phones.''</p>
        <p>Ackowledging that there might be exceptional situations, he said that drivers have been advised to ''use sound judgement and common sense; there might be a situation where you would allow someone to use their cell phone.''</p>
        <p>''I don't want them to be the middleman in confrontations,'' Mr. Pard added, explaining that the driver should point to the sign  and ask the person to get off the phone.</p>
        <p>For those who refuse to comply Mr. Pard said: ''The most serious handling of it is to ask them to leave the bus. If they refuse to do that we have every right to call in the local authorities and have them removed.''</p>
        <p>He said another option would be for the driver to pull off the road and wait for the to end the conversation. ''Obviously that brings every other passenger on the bus in to play,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Ken Miller, a spokesman for New Jersey Transit, said that while there had been some complaints about the use of cell phones on its trains and buses, they had not yet risen to ''a real big problem.''</p>
        <p>Christine Salzone, director of marketing for the Northeast region of Coach USA, a Paramus-based company that operates the Red and Tan, Shortline, Community Coach, Olympia, Suburban and Trans-Hudson bus lines, said, ''We do not have any plans to have such a policy for the moment, but we certainly are paying attention to the use of cell phones on our buses and their impact on people's comfort.''</p>
        <p>Lakeland Bus Lines Inc. of Dover, which serves Dover, Essex, Morris, Sussex and Warren Counties, has no ban but has posted signs asking passengers not to use cell phones unless absolutely necessary.</p>
        <p>For the most part, Mr. Pard said, reaction to the ban has been favorable. ''Initially when I talked to people, the positive response was 5 to 1,'' Mr. Pard said. ''And now it's going far beyond that.''</p>
        <p>One recent morning, several people waiting for the bus in Upper Montclair said they agreed with the ban, though with some reservations.</p>
        <p>''I don't know if people understand how loud they are,'' said Denise Brown, 34, a manager at an investment firm.</p>
        <p>Most commuters, like Brian Mieth, 33, a marketing director for an internet company, said they did not mind people making short calls in quiet tones. For that reason, Mr. Mieth said he had mixed feelings about the ban.</p>
        <p>''I put my phone on vibrate, so no one hears the ring,'' he said. ''I talk quietly and I keep it to a bare minimum.''</p>
