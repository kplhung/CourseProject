        <p>DOES anyone really know why the show must go on? Is it because the tickets have been sold? Because the actors must be paid? Or is the reason more intangible, rooted in the notion of art itself?</p>
        <p>What is certain is that most theater artists cherish their near-disasters, if only because such mishaps make good stories. Circumstance becomes the villain, a hero appears and the show -- well, you know.</p>
        <p>Here are a few such stories from local stages:</p>
        <p>Christopher Beach, director of the Performing Arts Center at Purchase College:</p>
        <p>''It was a snowy night in March 1993, and the Hong Kong Ballet was performing in the Concert Hall. I was in my booth at the back of the theater, when suddenly one of the university police officers burst in. 'There's a bomb in the building!' she said. 'It's going to go off in 15 seconds.' I thought, well, I have about 10 seconds to get everyone out of the theater. I leapt up and ran to the stage. I thought, maybe she means 15 minutes. It was the middle of the ballet, and the dancers were doing their double turns and grand jettes across the stage. I asked the production manager for a microphone and walked onto the stage. 'Ladies and gentlemen,' I said. 'If you'll be kind enough to grab your coats and evacuate the theater, we have an emergency.'</p>
        <p>''It was a full house, but the theater was empty in 4 minutes. The bomb didn't go off in 15 seconds or 15 minutes. The security officers checked all over, and then we began the program again. I still have people coming up to me and saying, 'I was here the night you had the bomb.' ''</p>
        <p>Paul Lustig Dunkel, music director and conductor of the Westchester Philharmonic:</p>
        <p>''We try to do as many concerts as possible in the music business. One summer in the mid-1980's I had to conduct a Sunday morning rehearsal at the Mozart Festival in Burlington, Vt. After the rehearsal ended, at 2 p.m., I was supposed to fly to Westchester to conduct the Westchester Philharmonic -- it was called the New Orchestra of Westchester then -- at a 5 or 6 p.m. all-Mozart concert at Heritage Hills in Somers. Musicians don't know about time zones -- we're good at longitude, not latitude -- but since this was one time zone, I didn't think it would be a problem.</p>
        <p>''It was a beautiful day in Vermont, but for some reason all the flights were canceled. I guess it was raining somewhere. So I got into my car -- it was an '85 Mazda -- and started driving. There were campers on the road going 20 miles an hour, and I needed to be doing 80. It was frightening.</p>
        <p>There's nothing worse as a conductor than finding someone else conducting your concert -- it's worse than finding someone in bed with your wife. Especially if it's someone you know. I thought, 'Oh my God, one of the musicians will conduct when I don't make it.' They're all good musicians, but it was a terrifying thought.</p>
        <p>I went practically on the sidewalk to pass cars. There was a huge thunderstorm going on in Westchester, but I was only a couple of seconds late. The orchestra waited, and everything was fine. I had driven fast before, but never with such purpose.''</p>
        <p>Anthony Aibel, music director and conductor of the Westchester Symphony Orchestra:</p>
        <p>''In 1994 the orchestra went on strike the day of a concert. The musicians were pressing for union recognition. We had a very important dress rehearsal that same day, and we kept postponing it. Would the concert go on?</p>
        <p>''A decision was reached, and both parties were satisfied just in time for a 6 p.m. rehearsal at the Performing Arts Center in Purchase. We rehearsed until 7:15, and then went to get into concert attire. But I discovered I had left my tails at home. One of the board members offered to drive me home to Riverdale, then back to Purchase for the 8 p.m. concert. He was going 70 miles an hour the whole way.</p>
        <p>''We got back at 8:15. I was sprinting backstage when I began to hear music playing. I thought, 'What a curious thing, it's exactly the same piece I conducted at rehearsal.' It was a Brahms Hungarian Dance. I thought, 'That's odd, that's too coincidental.'</p>
        <p>''My concertmaster had taken up the baton. He was making his conducting debut. It's a very humbling thing to see that the orchestra can go on without you. After the piece, when he came offstage, he told me: 'That was the easy Hungarian dance. We can't do the next two pieces without you.'</p>
        <p>''But I had an idea. I said, 'No, you go back onstage.' So when he lifted up his baton, I took his violin out of his case and sat down in his seat. I pretended I was the concertmaster.''</p>
        <p>Eli Abdallah, marketing associate of the Emelin Theater:</p>
        <p>''There are cancellations, but it all works out. Last winter when the actor Werner Klemperer backed out of a lecture, the actress Barbara Feldon came instead. Sometimes a lot of people have the same agent, so we get substitutions easily.</p>
        <p>''Ann Hampton Callaway was supposed to appear in our cabaret series last season, but when she got a part in the show 'Swing,' she canceled. We ended up with her sister, Liz Callaway. Fortunately, it happened in enough time for us to make the change.''</p>
        <p>Richard Kapp, music director and conductor of Philharmonia Virtuosi:</p>
        <p>''When I first heard Mela Tenenbaum, who is now our concertmaster, play the viola d'amore, I was so overpowered that I asked her to play the Vivaldi D minor Viola d'Amore Concerto at a concert with us in Purchase the following week. It was her first opportunity to play in the United States after immigrating from the Soviet Union.</p>
        <p>''She was dressed to the nines, including hair and makeup, when she stepped outside the stage door to have a cigarette. The door closed behind her, and she was locked out of the building in a driving rainstorm. She spoke no English; it was time to go on stage, and there was no way to get back in.</p>
        <p>''So she traipsed around in the mud, carrying her 450-year-old viola d'amore until she finally found her way back into the theater. She got on stage wringing wet just as I was announcing the piece. The amazing thing is, The concert was recorded live, and the CD 'Vivaldi's Favorites, Vol. 1' was selected by Time magazine as one of the best recordings of 1992.''</p>
        <p>Joseph N. Hankin, president of Westchester Community College:</p>
        <p>''There was so much rain this summer that we almost had to cancel the New York Philharmonic's 20th-anniversary concert here. The Philharmonic had already canceled other outdoor concerts because of the weather.</p>
        <p>The field where we usually hold the concerts was much too soggy -- the stage would have just sunk. So we decided to move the stage to a parking lot. In order to do that, we had to rip out some curbs and grass, remove four light poles and cut down nine trees. The audience -- there were at least 20,000 people -- sat in a totally different orientation to the stage than usual. The light poles were put back afterward, and we're going to plant some trees.''</p>
