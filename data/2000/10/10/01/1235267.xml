        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In offering his advice for United, Alfred Kahn, who oversaw airline deregulation as chairman of the Civil Aeronautics Board in the late 1970's, said all airlines should engage in peak pricing -- charging more for tickets at peak travel times.</p>
        <p>But that idea is off the mark. It would result in mass revolt by the flying public, ensuring that the industry would lose far more than it would ever gain. Instead of holiday sales, we opt for holiday price hikes? Under this logic, might we also try raising toll fares on turnpikes, tunnels and bridges for rush hour?</p>
        <p>Imagine driving up to the George Washington Bridge and seeing a sign that reads: ''Welcome to New York. If it is between 7 a.m. and 5 p.m., the toll is triple the normal price. Have a nice stay!''</p>
