        <p>Article on John Ramage's miniature portrait of George Washington, done in October 1789 as gift to Washington's wife, Martha, which is expected to fetch $600,000 to $900,000 at Christie's auction in New York; photos (M)</p>

        <p>ON a Saturday in early October 1789, George Washington powdered his graying brown hair, donned a yellow waistcoat, lace cravat and the blue uniform with gold epaulettes that he had worn as commander of the Continental Army and set off to meet John Ramage, the most popular miniaturist in America. He probably went to Ramage's studio on Williams Street in Lower Manhattan, 10 blocks south of where he was staying on Cherry Street. And there Ramage painted his portrait, the first produced of Washington since he had become president five months earlier. That night, he recorded the event in his diary, writing, in his idiosyncratic way, ''Sat for Mr. Ramage near two hours to-day who was drawing a miniature Picture of me for Mrs. Washington.''</p>
        <p>The miniature, a half-length portrait in watercolor on ivory, depicts Washington not as a man of power and authority but as Martha Washington's husband of 30 years (she had also been married previously). His thoughtful face, turned a bit to the right with shadows accentuating the high brow and aristocratic nose, is softened with a wisp of a smile, a Ramage trick. No doubt, Washington knew how much Martha would treasure the intimate look of the miniature, which he had Ramage, who was also a goldsmith, frame in a 2 1/8-inch elliptical gold locket edged with beading. On the back, Ramage inscribed Washington's monogram on an oval of glass covering a lock of hair said to be the president's.</p>

        <p>ON a Saturday in early October 1789, George Washington powdered his graying brown hair, donned a yellow waistcoat, lace cravat and the blue uniform with gold epaulettes that he had worn as commander of the Continental Army and set off to meet John Ramage, the most popular miniaturist in America. He probably went to Ramage's studio on Williams Street in Lower Manhattan, 10 blocks south of where he was staying on Cherry Street. And there Ramage painted his portrait, the first produced of Washington since he had become president five months earlier. That night, he recorded the event in his diary, writing, in his idiosyncratic way, ''Sat for Mr. Ramage near two hours to-day who was drawing a miniature Picture of me for Mrs. Washington.''</p>
        <p>The miniature, a half-length portrait in watercolor on ivory, depicts Washington not as a man of power and authority but as Martha Washington's husband of 30 years (she had also been married previously). His thoughtful face, turned a bit to the right with shadows accentuating the high brow and aristocratic nose, is softened with a wisp of a smile, a Ramage trick. No doubt, Washington knew how much Martha would treasure the intimate look of the miniature, which he had Ramage, who was also a goldsmith, frame in a 2 1/8-inch elliptical gold locket edged with beading. On the back, Ramage inscribed Washington's monogram on an oval of glass covering a lock of hair said to be the president's.</p>
        <p>The locket has for most of the last two centuries remained in the hands of two different families. A year or so after Washington died, in 1799, Martha gave the locket to a niece, Betty Lewis Carter, the daughter of his sister Betty, who had died before him. In 1907, the locket was sold to Lucy Wharton Drexel, a member of the Philadelphia family of bankers. In 1988, a descendant sent it to Christie's in London. At a November auction that year, two Americans -- Alexander Acevedo, a New York dealer, and Eddy G. Nicholson, a New Hampshire investor and collector -- vied for the locket by telephone from their homes in America at 5 o'clock in the morning. The bidders, who knew each other well, were unaware that they were competitors at the sale, until later.</p>
        <p>''He was almost as stubborn as I was,'' said Mr. Acevedo, who bought the locket for $623,000 -- 10 times the Christie's estimate -- a price that remains the record for a miniature portrait.</p>
        <p>Two months later, Mr. Acevedo exhibited the miniature at his booth at the Winter Antiques Show in Manhattan, and Mr. Nicholson, his first customer, bought it for $650,000. Now he is selling it at Christie's in New York on Jan. 19. It is expected to bring from $600,000 to $900,000.</p>
        <p>''Washington's loathing of sitting for his portrait is well-documented, but this portrait is different because it is so personal,'' said Susan D. Kleckner, Christie's specialist in American folk art and miniatures. And so was the second image of Washington that Ramage painted at the same sitting, a frontal view, that is now in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. (Ramage also made a copy of each; the second of the frontal versions is in the Robert Hull Fleming Museum at the University of Vermont; the whereabouts of the fourth miniature is unknown.)</p>
        <p>Miniatures painted by Ramage were prized for their brilliant colors and long, delicate brush strokes. The rich, layered surfaces were livelier than those on the enameled images that were also popular in the period. Ramage's portraits differ from many others of Washington because they are more personal, less formal and each has a trace of a smile on his face.</p>
        <p>The two versions that Ramage painted that day differ in more than the way the subject is posed. The differences are readily apparent when the portraits are seen side by side. Recently, Ms. Kleckner brought Martha's miniature to the Metropolitan Museum, where it was placed alongside the museum version for comparison. In Martha's slightly larger miniature, Washington seemed to be looking into the distance, lost in thought. In the other version, he looks equally intense, but his eyes are directly on the viewer, as if he were about to speak.</p>
        <p>UNLIKE Martha's miniature, on which virtually every owner is identified by engravings on the back of the locket, the museum's work was of unknown provenance until 1924. It was then that the last owner, Charles Allen Munn, a collector of Washington paintings who was the publisher of the Scientific American, bequeathed it to the museum.</p>
        <p>What is less well known to the public today is Martha Washington's feelings about miniatures and lockets. She cherished these pictures and had many painted of her children from her first marriage, and she often enclosed locks of their hair as expressions of intimacy. To many mourners who sent her letters of condolences after Washington's death, she sent locks of his hair.</p>
        <p>And what was the significance of the hair? ''Hair was precious, intimate and incredibly meaningful,'' said Carrie Barrattc, a curator of American Paintings and Sculpture at the museum who is an expert on miniatures. ''We forget today -- when most everyone's hair is so visible, and hair is being swept into dust bins in beauty parlors everywhere -- that in the 18th century you rarely saw people's hair. They wore hats, veils and kerchiefs; they powdered their hair or wore wigs. Hair helped to commemorate a person. In a locket it made a portrait into a token of affection rather than a record of a likeness. These are secular reliquaries, watercolor on ivory -- bone -- and occasionally, hair at the back.''</p>
