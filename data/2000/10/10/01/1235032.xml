        <p>THE perception of casino entertainment as sleazy lounge acts has greatly changed in recent years. Today, casinos like Foxwoods in Mashantucket and Mohegan Sun in Uncasville offer a wide array of musical acts that once would never have dreamed of playing a casino.</p>
        <p>''It's not just Shecky Green and Jerry Vale anymore,'' said Mitchell Etess, the executive vice president of marketing at Mohegan Sun. ''What you're seeing is, the whole concept of casino entertainment is evolving, mostly because the number of casinos is growing and the broad demographics is growing.''</p>

        <p>THE perception of casino entertainment as sleazy lounge acts has greatly changed in recent years. Today, casinos like Foxwoods in Mashantucket and Mohegan Sun in Uncasville offer a wide array of musical acts that once would never have dreamed of playing a casino.</p>
        <p>''It's not just Shecky Green and Jerry Vale anymore,'' said Mitchell Etess, the executive vice president of marketing at Mohegan Sun. ''What you're seeing is, the whole concept of casino entertainment is evolving, mostly because the number of casinos is growing and the broad demographics is growing.''</p>
        <p>Tom Cantone, vice president of Foxwoods Entertainment Group, agreed, saying: ''That's the misnomer I've been trying to educate people about. You're not playing a casino. You're playing a concert that happens to be in a casino.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Etess and Mr. Cantone have persuaded many of today's top name acts to play at their casinos: Wynonna, Vanessa Williams, Tony Bennett and Bill Cosby, for example.</p>
        <p>They are also booking the top-drawing names from yesterday including Foreigner, REO Speedwagon, Kiss, Davy Jones and K.C. and the Sunshine Band.</p>
        <p>Though Mr. Cantone said Foxwoods has introduced more than 150 acts to the casino circuit, he added, ''There are still acts who hesitate to book here. They think they won't find their audience.''</p>
        <p>Both Mohegan Sun and Foxwoods have several entertainment stages with more on the way. Mohegan Sun's big concert stage is its new 5,000-seat Uncas Pavilion, which is open to audiences of all ages. Besides music and the occasional stand-up act, the theater is host to professional boxing matches and its traditional Oktoberfest celebration.</p>
        <p>Mohegan Sun also operates the cabaret-style Wolf Den, which presents nightly fare of blues, rock and jazz for patrons 21 and older without a cover charge or drink minimum. Its Events Center, a bingo hall by day, has also offered acts like Ringo Starr, the Doobie Brothers, Al Jarreau, Regis Philbin, and Steve Lawrence and Eydie Gorme.</p>
        <p>Foxwoods features two large concert stages, its 4,000-seat Fox Arena and the 1,400-seat Fox Theater, as well as three nightclubs and a place for youngsters. The 400-seat Cinedrome is a high-tech dance club with no shortage of live music or music videos to play on its giant screens. It reserves Sunday nights for swing dancing, Tuesdays for country and Thursdays for salsa music. The Atrium and Intermezzo Clubs also offer dancing. The Cinetropolis is a Disneyesque club suitable for children.</p>
        <p>Why would a casino set aside so much space for non-gambling activity? ''It's to get people to come who don't usually go to casinos,'' said Mr. Etess. ''We do feel it brings new customers here and it extends their stay.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cantone said this marketing strategy simply gives customers what they want. ''We know that entertainment is a big part of their visit,'' he said. ''They go out of their way to come here. We're not on the boardwalk.''</p>
        <p>Though neither casino pays any more than other area venues, Mr. Etess said, each is willing to bring a band like the 70's folk-rock group America to a relatively small performance space without charging admission. When they do this, casinos bank on getting their money back in the restaurants or gaming rooms.</p>
        <p>Mr. Etess also said that the casinos' locations help -- on the route between Boston and other spots the bands play -- and that ''we have a good reputation of taking care of the acts.''</p>
        <p>The short distance between Mohegan Sun and Foxwoods does not preclude any particular act from performing at the other location -- within reason. ''We can't repeat too many acts within too short a period of time,'' said Mr. Cantone. ''Only a handful of traditional acts sell out every time: Bill Cosby, Wayne Newton, Tony Bennett.''</p>
        <p>Nobody could be happier than the oldie bands that have found a second wind in the casino concert halls. Except perhaps their maturing fans. ''You can go back again,'' said Mr. Cantone.</p>
