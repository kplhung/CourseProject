        <p>Dear Juan and Dick,</p>
        <p>I've spent the last two weeks in total awe of you dudes, smoother in deep water than Hoogie and the Thorpedo, tighter than C. J. and Marion, braver than Rulon Gardner grappling with the Siberian Meanie. So what if your Games bombed? That's show business. Sets you up for a box office smash in 2004.</p>

        <p>Dear Juan and Dick,</p>
        <p>I've spent the last two weeks in total awe of you dudes, smoother in deep water than Hoogie and the Thorpedo, tighter than C. J. and Marion, braver than Rulon Gardner grappling with the Siberian Meanie. So what if your Games bombed? That's show business. Sets you up for a box office smash in 2004.</p>
        <p>If you implement my three simple suggestions, that is.</p>
        <p>1. BRING BACK A COLD WAR-- No wonder your numbers hurt; you've been competing at a disadvantage, compared to, say, Roone Arledge and Avery Brundage, the last major TV-I.O.C. partners. Once the Soviet Union broke into Baby Bells, the Games lost their gimmick. The United States had no big rival in the moral equivalent to war. That's why the Dream Teamer Charles Barkley roughing up a third-world opponent (he could have been hiding a spear, Charles said) was such brilliant political satire in 1992.</p>
        <p>Now it's just politically incorrect, especially since Nike, Adidas and Reebok tried and failed to fill the tribal gap. Fans didn't realize then, and still don't, that dying for a logo is every bit as final as dying for a flag. That's why we need some ideological jousting to re-establish the Olympics' brand equity. Otherwise, it's just another international entertainment event and will be taken over by the N.B.A.</p>
        <p>China is the perfect designated adversary, a sports Satan. China is big, it's coming on and it's willing to do heavy drugs, which always shows desire. China is No. 2 to us in the medal count (if you don't put all the old Soviets together, which would make them No. 1.)</p>
        <p>It's not for me to tell you how to bring the world to the brink of war. With Dick's experience at ABC and NBC and Juan's in Spain, you know the way.</p>
        <p>Nike, Bud and Coke, as well as various government agencies in the United States and China, have good people who can help you whipsaw emotions until the viewing publics in both countries are chanting, ''Faster, stronger, even higher/We will beat the Evil Empire.''</p>
        <p>2. IMPOSE A DRUG TAX -- We all know that athletes need their chemical helpers to train harder and recover more quickly from injury, not to mention look good for photo ops. Let the ethicists decide whether they have the right to take chances with their bodies. The only valid argument I ever heard against drug use is that it forces athletes who prefer to stay clean yet competitive either to leave the sport or to take drugs, too. That's just not fair. So let's make it fair.</p>
        <p>For starters, allow all drugs all the time. Growth hormone for 7-footers, steroids for 400-pounders, speed for sprinters, EPO for the blood sports. Make it, they'll take it. And then, for something truly new, institute real drug testing all the time by a medical group unaffiliated with television or the Olympics that gets paid bonuses for coming up with positives, especially of superstars.</p>
        <p>And then, depending on the event, and on the type and amount of drug taken, a handicap will be imposed -- points deducted, time or distance reduced. Sports is filled with statistical wonks who can work it out. Clean and dirty will be able to compete on a leveled playing field.</p>
        <p>3. RETURN TO TRADITIONAL VALUES -- The shame-free celebration of the male body (to die for, as women who were caught watching found out) was one huge Olympic moment in the ancient Games. Men competed naked. There were no concerns about wind resistance and drag in those days. Bodysuits in ancient Greece? The ratings would be in the Aegean. Sure, they had scandals -- fixed races, payoffs in olive oil franchises for so-called amateurs -- but Sparta and Athens were sister cities compared to such contemporary city-states as Pepsi and Coke (see cold war scenarios in attached documents).</p>
        <p>But I digress. This suggestion is touchy. Obviously, nude events, per se, are not possible. However, now that fabric technology is so evolved, it should be possible for, say, Speedo, to produce competition gear, call it Nudos, that would conceal the athletes' bodies to the, uh, naked eye and the standard camera, yet be transparent to certain enhanced video lenses. On pay-per-view channels, it would be possible to view athletes in the altogether right through their Nudo suits.</p>
        <p>Imagine how this would improve basketball, beach volleyball, gymnastics or pole vaulting for that demographic you need to reclaim. Which is everybody. Athletes in Nudos would receive additional compensation, but knowing these narcissistic babies as we do, some of them would have to be kept under standard wraps.</p>
        <p>You've got four years to turn the Games around. Tweaking won't do it. Being bold and basic is your only chance. Are the Olympics worth such radical risks? Beats me. But I'm sure it's worth it to you guys. Listen to me, Juan, and you will get the Nobel Prize you seem to be despairing of, and you, Dick, will have your dream of a network back in your pocket.</p>
