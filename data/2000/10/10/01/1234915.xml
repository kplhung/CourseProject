        <p>The Breach</p>
        <p>Inside the Impeachment and Trial</p>
        <p>of William Jefferson Clinton.</p>
        <p>By Peter Baker.</p>
        <p>Illustrated. 464 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>A Lisa Drew Book/Scribner. $27.50.</p>
        <p>What would Leon Jaworski have done with Linda Tripp and her tapes? I'll make a guess based on what he did when he learned there was an unexplained 18*-minute gap on one of the Nixon tapes. Despite the agonized howls of the White House lawyers (they wanted to read Rose Mary Woods her Miranda rights) and without consulting his staff, the Watergate special prosecutor picked up the phone and called the judge in the case. John J. Sirica held a public hearing the same day.</p>
        <p>When Kenneth W. Starr learned of Monica S. Lewinsky, the Whitewater special counsel had to make choices. The most obvious would be to inform the federal district judge in Little Rock, Ark. (When she finally got the information, Susan Webber Wright knew how to handle a lying president.) Starr chose instead to expand his jurisdiction, to view the Lewinsky affair as more of the obstruction conspiracy that he never proved in the Whitewater case. Starr aides ambushed Lewinsky and tried to turn her, to wire her so as to ensnare Bill Clinton; Vernon E. Jordan Jr.; Betty Currie, the president's secretary; or anybody they could get. The unintended consequences were many.</p>
        <p>In ''The Breach,'' Peter Baker sums up the results: ''The nation's politics had been warped into something almost unrecognizable. All the rules had been rewritten. A president could be caught enjoying sexual favors in the Oval Office suite from an intern barely older than his daughter, then lie about it on national television, cover up his misconduct and yet soar to record heights in political popularity polls. A special prosecutor could force a young woman to divulge her most intimate secrets, haul her mother into a grand jury and even compel the Secret Service agents who guard the president to break their code of silence, all without anyone able to tell him to stop. A speaker of the House could seek to use the president's wrongdoing to his advantage in an election, only to endure a devastating defeat and find himself forced from power just days later, all the while conducting his own secret, five-year extramarital affair.''</p>
        <p>Baker, a reporter at The Washington Post who covered the White House, picks up the story as the House of Representatives got the case. Starr and the House leaders insisted it wasn't about sex and the president, but about lies and the presidency. It was about all that, a very public soap opera (''Watergate or 'Peyton Place'?'' Representative Lindsey Graham asked) for which the House Republicans demanded constitutionally lethal consequences. The country and the Senate said no; lowlife behavior unworthy of errant high schoolers shouldn't be cast in terms of a high crime.</p>
        <p>''The Breach'' -- the title refers to the widening gap between political parties -- is a tale oft told on network and cable television and Web sites, in print and electronic magazines, newspapers and instant books that left nothing to the imagination and little for the future. Baker has added insider details and an accumulation of the bad judgments and incompetent actions that led to the president's impeachment and then acquittal without any official repudiation by Congress. He quotes Alexander Hamilton on ''the greatest danger'' of impeachment: ''that the decision will be regulated more by the comparative strength of parties than by the real demonstration of innocence or guilt.'' Henry J. Hyde, the House judiciary chairman, agreed, but became a prisoner of party process. Richard A. Gephardt, the House Democratic leader, began by telling his counsel if they found an impeachable offense, he and Thomas A. Daschle, the Senate Democratic leader, would go to the White House and tell Clinton to resign. Soon Gephardt was telling the same lawyer, ''We're going to win by losing.''</p>
        <p>As the situation deteriorated, Baker says, Hyde tried to negotiate the granddaddy of all plea bargains, secretly proposing that if Clinton would go along with being impeached by the House, Hyde would negotiate a censure in the Senate, the end to the Starr investigation and immunity from criminal prosecution. Baker doesn't measure the likelihood that Hyde could have delivered. Representative Asa Hutchinson's last-minute compromise was to dump the case on Judge Wright in Little Rock, ''and then we wouldn't have to have the impeachment.'' It was too late.</p>
        <p>Some of the book's quotations are priceless and have been or will be denied, as is the custom. ''Bob can stand scrutiny, can't he?'' the Democratic lobbyist Butler Derrick is quoted as asking an aide to Speaker-designate Bob Livingston while pressuring for a vote on censure as an option to impeachment. Shortly afterward, Livingston confessed an extramarital affair and resigned from Congress. Before the president's grand jury appearance began, his lawyer David E. Kendall tells Kenneth Starr: ''You know all those nice things I was quoted saying about you? I didn't say them.'' Starr replies, ''I didn't think so.'' James W. Ziglar, the Senate sergeant-at-arms, warns Strom Thurmond to stop flirting with the White House lawyers Nicole K. Seligman and Cheryl D. Mills, asking, ''What would we do if they filed some sort of sexual harassment suit?'' Senator Thurmond smiles and answers, ''Now, wouldn't that be nice?''</p>
        <p>Reporters reward their sources. Baker finds some of the players here among the smartest, well connected, articulate and conscience-torn, while others are tough-minded and foulmouthed or profane and brass-knuckled. He does not find any heroes. He documents in bemusing detail what folks were eating and drinking during momentous meetings -- chicken enchiladas; warm fruit punch and stale pretzels; eggs, orange juice and coffee; shrimp; pizza, including a kosher pie for Senator Joseph I. Lieberman; takeout Japanese; lager beer; red wine; white wine; and soda. It's the insignificant-detail ploy: if he knows what they munched, he must know everything.</p>
        <p>When it's over, the result is the damaged reputations of Clinton and his lawyers, Starr and his staff, journalists, members of Congress, presidential aides and simple bystanders. We don't yet know the damage to the presidency, the courts, Congress and the Constitution. But historians, for perspective or comic relief, will be able to read Peter Baker's account of what the actors were saying and doing as they snacked offstage.</p>
