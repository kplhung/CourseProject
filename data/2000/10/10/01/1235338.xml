        <p>Faced with elimination tonight, the MetroStars played their best game of the season, if not their history, beating the Chicago Fire, 2-0, at Giants Stadium.</p>
        <p>The victory evened their Major League Soccer semifinal series at 1-1 and 3 points each. The decisive Game 3 will be played Friday night at Chicago.</p>
        <p>The physical game included 40 fouls and 6 referee cautions, but the quality of soccer was at its highest level here since the days of the Cosmos three decades ago and the World Cup in 1994.</p>
        <p>The MetroStars got goals from Mark Chung and Adolfo Valencia. And Mike Ammann, returning to action for the first time since Aug. 16, when he broke three ribs and punctured a lung in a game against Tampa Bay, made three saves, all in the final 13 minutes.</p>
        <p>The game was of such high quality that the knowledgeable fans in the crowd of 15,476, a record for an M.L.S. playoff game here, stayed several minutes after the end of the game to cheer the MetroStars.</p>
        <p>Every player from the MetroStars had a memorable performance, but Lothar Matthaus might have sparkled most. Matthaus, the 39-year-old German superstar, was brilliant in his sweeper position.</p>
        <p>''I cannot say enough about everyone, but I thought Lothar played his best game, and whatever happened in the past can be forgotten,'' Coach Octavio Zambrano said, referring to his differences with Matthaus. ''I said before the playoffs that this is the time for the big-time players to show up and this is the best I've seen Lothar play.''</p>
        <p>Matthaus was calm and composed after the game, as if it were just a day at the office. He exchanged jerseys with Hristo Stoichkov, Chicago's Bulgarian star, at the end of the game and said afterward that this was the type of game the MetroStars would have to play if they were to reach the championship.</p>
        <p>''It was important for me to do things offensively and defensively,'' Matthaus said. ''Soccer is a simple game, and when we play simple we play better.''</p>
        <p>There was nothing fancy tonight by the MetroStars, who lost by 3-0 at Chicago in the opening game of the series on Tuesday. They seemed fired up to redeem themselves tonight.</p>
        <p>The game was so physical early that there was a foul every two minutes or so and the referee handed out five yellow cards in the first half. There were 23 fouls in the first half, 13 by the MetroStars, most of them for vicious tackles.</p>
        <p>''Everybody was committed to give ourselves the best,'' said Steve Jolley, the central defender, who said before the game that the MetroStars had to ''crack some bones'' to succeed.</p>
        <p>''We applied pressure and we held the lead like we never did before,'' said Jolley, who neutralized Ante Razov, Chicago's central striker, who scored Chicago's final goal in Game 1.</p>
        <p>Chung's first goal in the playoffs, with five minutes remaining in the first half, was all the MetroStars needed.</p>
        <p>He took a left-footed blast from 14 yards to the lower left corner after he collected his own rebound.</p>
        <p>Valencia sealed the victory with his second goal of the playoffs. It came with six minutes left when he took a pass from Clint Mathis and beat Zach Thornton with a low shot to the right corner.</p>
        <p>The MetroStars played their best game without Tab Ramos or Thomas Dooley. Ramos sat out with a groin muscle injury from practice last Thursday. Dooley nursed a shoulder injury.</p>
        <p>As a result, Zambrano was forced to play Mathis in midfield and use Alex Comas as Valencia's partner on attack.</p>
        <p>''It was a different role for me, but I'm happy I contributed,'' Mathis said. ''We had our backs against the wall and we played with intensity. We were all determined to do what it takes.''</p>
        <p>Billy Walsh, the defensive midfielder for the MetroStars, was impressed by the way his teammates performed and said he was involved in the best soccer game of his career.</p>
        <p>''Bodies were flying everywhere,'' Walsh said. ''It was a fantastic game, and I'm thrilled that I was part of it.''</p>
        <p>''I hope the guys carry the momentum into the next game,'' said Zambrano, who called for practice on Sunday morning. ''I challenged the guys, and they responded. I think it speaks volumes for our players.''</p>
