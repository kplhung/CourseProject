        <p>For thousands of years, Indian women have moved through daily life wearing vividly colored, gracefully flowing saris. Given the quixotic world of fashion, where trends may last for a season at most, that might be a record.</p>
        <p>But a visit to the cluster of clothing stores on 74th Street, where most saris in the city are sold, reveals that the sari's grip on the fashion sensibility of local Indian women may be loosening, due to the pull of Western dress.</p>
        <p>''The women used to wear saris all the time,'' said Ramesh Navani, owner of India Sari Palace, one of the few stores on the street that specializes in saris. ''But now they keep them only for special occasions.''</p>
        <p>Less than a decade ago there were more than a score of stores on and near 74th Street that primarily sold saris, said Mr. Navani, who is the president of the Jackson Heights Merchants Association. Now less than half a dozen remain, and most  have supplemented their stock with luggage, cosmetics and costume jewelry to meet the demands of rising rents on the busy commercial strip.</p>
        <p>Mr. Navani laments the fact that the art of wrapping a sari, which measures six yards by 45 inches, is being lost among a new generation of young Indian-American women.</p>
        <p>''It takes a little practice to be able to gracefully walk in it,'' he said. ''It's not like pants.'' He conceded, however, that saris can be cumbersome in bad weather and impractical for certain jobs.</p>
        <p>Shiv Dass, the owner of Shingar, is trying to entice younger women by offering what he called ''ready-made saris,'' sari-style dresses that are tailored and require little wrapping. But these days he sells mostly skirt-and-top combinations called lehnga choli, or knock-offs of designer fashions worn by Indian movies stars.</p>
        <p>Zaki, a 31-year-old singer from Dallas, wears elaborate costume saris when she is performing with her band but added: ''When I'm at work or shopping around, I like to wear something that everybody is wearing. I don't want to stand out.''</p>
        <p>Still, both shop owners say they are attracting new customers from the neighborhood's recent influx of Bangladeshi immigrants. But they know these are first-generation immigrant women and their American-born daughters will probably not wear saris every day.</p>
