        <p>GUIDEBOOKS to New York City are always in demand in a place where advice can quickly become outdated. Here is a sampler from some recent volumes:</p>
        <p>NEW YORK'S 50 BEST MUSEUMS FOR COOL PARENTS AND THEIR KIDS  By Alfred Gingold and Helen Rogan  City &amp; Company ($14, paperback)</p>
        <p>On the American Museum of Natural History:</p>
        <p>The other big favorite is, of course, the dinosaur exhibit on the fourth floor -- two halls of enormous skeletons in very peppy poses, tails waving, jaws wide and ready for action. If you're looking for the true giants, go to the Saurischian hall; don't miss the Tyrannosaurus rex skull and the Apatosaurus (which you actually cannot miss, since it towers above everything and has an oddly tiny skull). Triceratops, Stegosaurus, and assorted duck-billed friends are in the Ornithischian hall. Here, again, the kids will feel totally at home, as a result of the enduring fascination the world's smallest people have for the world's largest creatures.</p>
        <p>On the Maritime Industry Museum in the Bronx:</p>
        <p>''A trip here is like a visit to the souvenir-filled attic of an eccentric seafaring uncle. Fort Schuyler sits on a small promontory, surrounded on three sides by the waters of Long Island Sound and the East River. . . . The museum offers a comprehensive history of American ships and shipping. But with kids, you'll have to dodge around in accordance with their whims. Wherever you look, you'll see models, highly detailed replicas of all sorts of vessels, including Cleopatra's barge (complete with a tiny queen of the Nile on deck), a couple of Chinese junks, a Spanish galleon with painted sails, and the doomed luxury liner Andrea Doria, with three swimming pools. . . . On the second floor, New York parents will want to study the big (one inch equals 50 feet) model of the Brooklyn Navy Yard, circa 1940-42. The model contains 273 buildings inside the yard's boundaries, 659 houses and 4 churches outside, 46 naval vessels, 47 mobile cranes, 231 freight cars, and so on. Completion time? Eight years.</p>
        <p>NEW YORK'S 50 BEST BOOKSTORES FOR BOOK LOVERS  By Eve Claxton  City &amp; Company ($12, paperback)</p>
        <p>Community Bookstore and Cafe, 143 Seventh Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn</p>
        <p>This charming place is a community bookstore in both name and function. . . . The books at Community are chosen with intelligence and flair with the emphasis on literature, psychology, and history. Park Slope's many families are well served by a children's area, where kids are always welcome to hang out, read and play.</p>
        <p>Strand Book Store, 828 Broadway, at 12th Street</p>
        <p>The Strand claims to be the largest used book store in the world, home to somewhere in the region of two million books. The famous red sign outside says, ''Eight miles of books.'' Store manager Nancy Bass says, ''These days it's probably closer to twelve miles.''</p>
        <p>The Strand was founded by Nancy's grandfather Benjamin Bass in 1927 in a closet-sized space on the old Book Row. Today the cavernous Broadway store is owned by her father, Ben's son Fred. . . . The store bustles with customers seven days a week, even without a cafe. Fred promises, ''The Strand will never serve cappuccino!''</p>
        <p>INSIDE NEW YORK 2000  Inside New York ($16.95, paperback)</p>
        <p>The nice thing about cafes . . . is that it's just as acceptable to hang anonymously with your shades on as it is to strike up conversations with total strangers. In fact, many a New Yorker has been known to come away with a good story after spending a morning in the cafe with their noses in the paper and their ears pricked. So while we recommend the following joints for a caffeine jolt as alternatives to the big chains, be forewarned: If you've got a secret you want to keep, don't go blabbing it in places like the Hungarian Pastry Shop (1030 Amsterdam Avenue) or Cupcake Cafe (522 Ninth Avenue). If there's one thing you'll learn while hanging out in coffeehouses, it's that New Yorkers really do care.</p>
        <p>RETRO NY: A GUIDE  TO REDISCOVERING  OLD NEW YORK  By Chuck Lawliss  Taylor ($16.95, paperback)</p>
        <p>New York has always had a vibrant street life. In colonial times business was often conducted outdoors. Stocks were traded near a buttonwood tree between 68 and 70 Wall Street. Prior to 1841 meats and vegetables had to be sold in public markets rather than private shops. Other kinds of street vendors also were common in the early days. Among the products sold were gingerbread, roasted peanuts, apple cider, kindling, shoelaces, brooms, and newspapers. Children incorporated into their games stoops, cornices, manhole covers, curbs and fire escapes. In addition, street celebrations have always been an important part of neighborhood identity.</p>
        <p>Little wonder that New Yorkers love a street fair; it's in their blood. A street fair offers good things to eat, games to play, interesting people to mingle with, lots of things to see and do. On weekends from early spring to late fall, there's usually a street fair somewhere in the city.</p>
        <p>NEW YORK @ NIGHT  McCann/Kaali-Nagy Publishing Group  ($11.95 paperback)</p>
        <p>With New York City having played such a pivotal role in fostering so many musical styles, expectations here are higher than in other cities. While ambience and decor are often exceptional, these establishments live or die by the quality of the performance. In order to succeed in Manhattan, a live music proprietor must equip his establishment with exceptional acoustics and sound equipment. And, while cover bands may go over in Poughkeepsie, nightcrawlers in Manhattan demand not only the latest and greatest, but acts that are inaccessible anywhere else. Usually drinks are a bit more expensive and almost always a cover charge is demanded at the door.</p>
