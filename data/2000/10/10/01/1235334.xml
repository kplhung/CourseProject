        <p>THE mayor of Waterbury?'' asked a commuter on the train platform. ''I thought he was in jail.''</p>
        <p>That was a previous mayor. The current one, Philip A. Giordano, was greeting commuters, trying to politic his way out of a predicament that feels like solitary confinement.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giordano is the only Connecticut politician campaigning for the United States Senate. But he's also about the least likely one to get there.</p>
        <p>Connecticut's Senate race has become like a Fairfield County private estate sale with hand signals and whispered deals and breathless speculation about whether a guy named Joe -- bidding by proxy -- will buy the armoire, the chaise or the whole lot. Everyone seems so tickled that Joe is still interested that Democrats and Republicans have all but canceled the race.</p>
        <p>The only person not taking the hint is Phil Giordano: ex-marine, self-described ''Italian with a hard head,'' and Republican mayor of downtrodden Waterbury. Before Joseph I. Lieberman became the Democrats' vice-presidential nominee, Mr. Giordano insisted on being his party's sacrificial lamb against the popular incumbent. But now he cannot even arrange for his own honorable slaying.</p>
        <p>The Republican governor, John G. Rowland, advised Mr. Giordano against running and is treating him like ants at a picnic. Mr. Rowland appeared at Mr. Giordano's campaign kickoff but declined to say why he thought the mayor would make a better senator than Mr. Lieberman, the governor's friend. The governor is holding a Giordano fund-raiser, but he has politely made it clear that Mr. Giordano will not be among his top choices for appointment to the Senate seat if Mr. Lieberman is elected to both jobs.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman will not even give Mr. Giordano the satisfaction of saying whether he will debate him. Last week, Mr. Lieberman said voters eager to see him debate should watch him debate Dick Cheney. Polls show Connecticut voters split on Mr. Lieberman's using his Senate seat like a college applicant would a safety school. But he gets sky-high 80 percent approval ratings.</p>
        <p>Polls show that Mr. Giordano would be similarly overmatched if Mr. Lieberman drops out and is replaced by another popular Democrat, Attorney General Richard Blumenthal.</p>
        <p>So pity Mr. Giordano, up before dawn every day, shaking hands at train stations, cruising the state every weekend in a mobile home, barely seeing his wife and three young boys, trying to convince voters that he, Phil Giordano, IS RUNNING AGAINST JOE LIEBERMAN!!!</p>
        <p>''No way!'' said a train station worker in Fairfield. Mr. Giordano quickly explained: ''Not for vice president, for Senate.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Giordano endures it from every angle. ''There is a Senate race in the state here,'' a radio host said, introducing Mr. Giordano. ''Many of the people don't realize that, including one of the candidates.''</p>
        <p>An hour later, meeting the staff of The Connecticut Jewish Ledger, he was told solemnly: ''You're running against this myth.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Giordano, 37, with boyish good looks and a quick laugh, weathers it well. Challenging Mr. Lieberman once seemed to offer statewide exposure after three two-year terms as mayor of Waterbury, a former brass-manufacturing center with a storied history of corruption. The city has fared well recently, thanks to the largess of Governor Rowland, a Waterbury native, yet Mr. Giordano says he might not run again.</p>
        <p>Now Mr. Giordano struggles for the fading limelight. He is reduced to asking Republicans to write letters to the editor urging that Mr. Lieberman debate him. His campaign schedule for Wednesday listed three events and, under a heading for Mr. Lieberman's Connecticut schedule, shouted: ''Nothing! He's 'Outa' Here!!'' On a radio show that day, Mr. Giordano plaintively said: ''The U.S. Senate race is extremely important.''</p>
        <p>On top of that, Mr. Giordano said, he fired his campaign chairman last week after discovering that he had paid top dollar to a printing firm owned by the aide's girlfriend's father.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giordano tries to stay on message: Mr. Lieberman changed positions once he became a vice-presidential candidate and has raised his own profile more than Connecticut's. Republicans in Greenwich cheered his message the other night, even offering hints for offbeat advertising venues, like diner place mats.</p>
        <p>But the race is often the lonely sound of one man running. At an opening of a Bush campaign office in Norwalk that night, Mr. Giordano enthused, ''I'm having a great time campaigning.'' Polite applause followed, but when a Republican in the back of the room was asked what he thought about Mr. Giordano's one-man mission, he answered with one word: ''Who?''</p>
