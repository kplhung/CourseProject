        <p>THUNDER FROM</p>
        <p>THE EAST</p>
        <p>Portrait of a Rising Asia.</p>
        <p>By Nicholas D. Kristof</p>
        <p>and Sheryl WuDunn.</p>
        <p>Illustrated. 377 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Alfred A. Knopf. $27.50.</p>
        <p>At the opening of ''Thunder From the East,'' Nicholas D. Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn's new book on contemporary Asian culture and society, we glimpse a ''raffishly handsome young man'' whose severed head is impaled on a bamboo stake, the victim of Indonesian rioters. Reading on, we meet a sweet 13-year-old Cambodian girl sold into prostitution by her parents; a mother and her tiny son picking through the mountainous Jakarta garbage dump that is their home; an elderly Japanese man with vivid memories of his wartime service as a torturer; and an entire village of shrunken, retarded Chinese children poisoned by the waters of the nearby Yellow River. The opulence is no less appalling: the $1,500-a-head Japanese restaurant where a hostess hectors the authors for being cheap; the private city near Bangkok, once a billionaire's avaricious dream, now a massive, unfinished, obscenely expensive ghost town.</p>
        <p>At the end of the 18th century, Samuel Shaw, an American merchant seaman visiting China for the first time, wrote to a friend back home, ''It would shock your humanity, were I to give a sketch of the misery which is here daily exhibited.'' Two centuries later, and despite its apparent entry into modernity, Asia can still be shocking to Western observers.</p>
        <p>Kristof and WuDunn, both staff members at The New York Times, for which they were formerly correspondents in Asia, are not peddling sensationalism. Nor are they in any way hostile to Asian culture. As their subtitle, ''Portrait of a Rising Asia,'' suggests, they are convinced that for all the misery, folly and evil they have witnessed in the region, in the coming decades ''Asia is likely to wrench economic, diplomatic and military power from the West'' and become the ''center of the world.'' After reading their account one wonders whether this would be an entirely good thing even if it came true.</p>
        <p>Kristof and WuDunn are, in their own words, ''grim'' optimists. Unlike the Western celebrants of Asia whose books rolled off the presses by the dozens in the 1980's and early 90's, they refuse to ignore the underside of Asian culture, the more destructive aspects of so-called Asian values, or the cultural flaws that in the past have prevented Asians from achieving a happy destiny and could do so again. Despite their desire to believe in Asia's future, the stories they tell often end up illustrating modern Asia's vast endemic problems: fragile economies without the smallest social safety net for the desperately poor, an industrial revolution that is creating an environmental nightmare, political systems suffering from entrenched corruption, legal structures that are ''opaque and often useless,'' and rising nationalist passions that could erupt into war.</p>
        <p>This darker view is not all that surprising, for Kristof and WuDunn write in the wake of a pan-Asian economic catastrophe that exposed all the manifold problems of the region's political economy. With the benefit of hindsight, they make clear that the ingredients of the Asian economic miracle so admired by the World Bank and writers like James Fallows and Chalmers Johnson -- the tight government control of research, development and investment known in the United States as ''industrial policy'' -- were also the undoing of many Asian economies. All the ''government meddling was disastrous,'' they write, and ''for all the praise lavished on the Asian business culture, up close it never looked nearly so impressive.''</p>
        <p>The absence of democracy, too, proved at least as much an obstacle as a spur to economic success. Cronyism and authoritarianism in many Asian countries led to unwise and inefficient allocations of investment capital. A nation like Indonesia ''had little hope for a vigorous market economy so long as Suharto was still in power and allowing his children and buddies to extract billions of dollars through monopolies and special concessions.'' The classic Asian model was destined ultimately to fail, though its foreign admirers failed to see the cracks. They ''focused on the glittering pinnacles rather than the wobbling foundations.'' When the economic crash came, it took everyone by surprise.</p>
        <p>The irony is that while many have become skeptical of the Asian miracle since the crisis, Kristof and WuDunn are optimists today precisely because of it. Despite all the pain and misery it brought, they believe that ''the Asian economic crisis was the best thing that could have happened to Asia.'' It helped destroy the ''cronyism, protectionism and government regulation that had burdened Asian business.'' It began to undermine some of the pillars of Asian society and culture -- the rigid social hierarchies, for instance -- that blocked further economic and social development. And it forced a ''greater reliance on markets, democracy and the rule of law.''</p>
        <p>Today's Asia is ''more democratic and more entrepreneurial than the old one,'' and that, Kristof and WuDunn believe, is reason for hope. In a more democratic Asia, with more room for individual initiative and creativity, and a stronger and fairer legal system, the natural discipline and determination of the Asian people may finally return the region to the global pre-eminence it enjoyed centuries ago. To put it another way, Asia will succeed not by hewing closely to Asian values but by becoming more and more like the West.</p>
        <p>Kristof and WuDunn advance this optimistic prediction with some caution. Two years after the unexpected Asian economic calamity, they are sensibly skeptical even about their own predictions. That crisis, they believe, was no aberration, and ''there will be further turbulence in the years ahead, and it may well get worse.'' Indonesia may collapse. India ''could fight a nuclear war with Pakistan.'' China could be ''torn apart by secession and civil war.'' In fact, they write, ''The next world war, if there is one, will almost certainly begin in Asia.'' They concede that this would have a somewhat disruptive effect on Asia's march toward global pre-eminence.</p>
        <p>Their humility is wise, and well earned. Just a few years ago, in ''China Wakes,'' a book written before the economic crisis, Kristof and WuDunn advanced views about Asia not dissimilar to the ones they now criticize. They wrote admiringly of Indonesia's ''vibrant industrial growth,'' and while they recognized that Suharto's rule was marred by graft, nepotism and repression, they concluded nevertheless that there was ''no doubt that Indonesia is making great progress.'' Indeed, Kristof and WuDunn once shared the common view that a little authoritarianism was a good thing for countries like Indonesia. ''Dictators can assure more order and stability than elected presidents'' in some countries, and this was ''crucial because economic growth requires stability.'' Looking around Asia in the early 1990's, they observed that except for Japan, Asian democracies like India and the Philippines were the economic ''laggards of the region.'' Kristof and WuDunn were ''unwillingly'' drawn to the conclusion that democracy could be ''an obstacle to economic growth.''</p>
        <p>Today they reject such thinking (though without ever mentioning their own change of heart). But is the new analysis any more solidly grounded than the old one? In the 1980's and early 90's, Asia watchers saw high growth rates and authoritarianism and called it a model. Then, when economic calamity struck in the late 90's, the experts gave themselves intellectual whiplash trying to explain, or explain away, the contradiction between their old analysis of Asian success and the new reality of Asian failure. Now Kristof and WuDunn, along with some others, present us with a new set of lessons learned, and once again predict Asian success. For a Western liberal, the new pro-democratic wisdom is certainly more attractive than the old pro-authoritarian wisdom. But will it prove any more enduring?</p>
        <p>One almost wishes Kristof and WuDunn had spent less time gazing into their crystal ball and simply let their outstanding reporting speak for itself. WuDunn is the more elegant writer, Kristof the more ferocious reporter. Their combined work yields a most memorable portrait of modern Asia. Whether it is a portrait of a ''rising'' or a ''falling'' Asia is harder to tell: their vivid tales of child prostitution, horrendous poverty, environmental degradation, wanton killing and government corruption tend to overwhelm their hopeful theorizing. Kristof and WuDunn's predictions, one suspects, will soon be overtaken by events. But the fascinating and often grisly stories they tell will long remain seared in the reader's memory.</p>
