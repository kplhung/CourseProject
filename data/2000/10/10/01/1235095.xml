        <p>THE work of Eddie Earl Cato (1941-1980) and his son, Nicholas Evans-Cato (who was born in 1973) pays homage to the Gowanus Canal and the once-thriving industrial center around it. Mr. Cato studied at Brooklyn College and later worked there; Mr. Evans-Cato was born in Brooklyn and still lives in the borough. Their work is on exhibit at the Prospect Park Tennis House in ''Thirty Years of the Gowanus: Two Generations of Cityscapes.'' (Mr. Evans-Cato's oil ''Palazzo'' is above.) He will also lead a walking tour through locations depicted in the paintings, joined by Dan Wiley, an urban educator, who will discuss the neighborhood's future. The events are presented by the Brooklyn Center for the Urban Environment.</p>
