        <p>President Clinton took office promising health insurance for all Americans, so he was distressed by the steady increase in the number of uninsured from 1993 to 1998. But finally the trend has been reversed. The Census Bureau reported that the number of people without insurance dropped last year by 1.7 million, to 42.6 million. The number of people with employment-based insurance rose 3.4 million, to 172 million.</p>
