        <p>IT was tempting. Six cities in 12 days, unpacking only once? Add two days in London and it was even more inviting. Especially since this tour-cruise to four Scandinavian capitals, St. Petersburg and an optional side trip to Berlin was for ''experienced travelers.'' Make that ''mature,'' the brochure amended, using an adjective that describes me better than ''experienced.''</p>
        <p>Although I had never before been on a cruise -- unless two nights aboard an informal small ship gliding along Glacier Bay in Alaska qualifies -- or vacationed on an organized tour, this Grand Circle Travel trip with 12 days aboard the Norwegian Cruise Line's Norwegian Dream looked too good to pass up.</p>
        <p>But me? A nongambler who didn't dance and hated to dress up? Would I take to the whole culture of cruising: the three nights of formal dress, the potentially seductive (and destructive) round-the-clock eating and, even, just sitting around watching the ocean go by?</p>
        <p>Could this if-this-is-Tuesday-it-must-be-Copenhagen trip (the kind I always poked fun at in my more mobile youth and before knee replacement surgery two years ago) satisfy my normal curiosity about people and places, provide anything more than a fleeting glimpse of fabled cities?</p>
        <p>Would traveling with a group of my age peers be like spending two weeks in a retirement home?</p>
        <p>Despite these concerns I signed on for a tour in June. Grand Circle Travel of Boston, begun in 1958 by the founder of the American Association of Retired Persons, came highly recommended. According to one of my two traveling companions, it provided fine accommodations and stimulating, stress-free land tours run by knowledgeable guides and, frequently, academics.</p>
        <p>The trip got off to a good start at Heathrow in London, where smiling Grand Circle representatives shepherded travelers wearing official C.G.T. badges to waiting buses that would take us and our C.G.T.-tagged luggage to the upscale Tower Thistle Hotel. Because the hotel is far from the center of the city, sandwiched between the Tower of London and a posh marina-housing development on the Thames, Grand Circle provided hourly bus transportation to and from the British Museum. This was in addition to breakfasts and a city sightseeing tour -- with one of those knowledgeable guides -- that were part of the package.</p>
        <p>On our own, my friends and I set the stage for what we hoped would be great things to come, with a night of theater we had booked  on the Internet (Maggie Smith in ''The Lady in the Van''), dinner at a chic Piccadilly restaurant I had discovered on a previous trip, and visits to places like the new Tate Modern and the British Museum. On the morning of the third day all 148 of the Grand Circle travelers from 23 states boarded our assigned buses for the trip south to Dover.</p>
        <p>With minimum effort -- and with G.C.T. personnel again riding herd on us and our luggage -- we boarded the ship and checked in. For about $250 more than my friends paid, I had booked as a ''guaranteed single'' which meant that instead of paying a ''single supplement'' for a specific cabin at almost twice the double rate, I would get a stateroom that the Norwegian Cruise Line had not sold. It turned out to be a pleasant surprise: in the center of the sixth deck with a queen-sized bed, sitting area, color television with free movies and CNN, plenty of closet space (for one), and a small shower-bathroom with a hair dryer and the usual hotel goodies replenished every day. Not surprisingly, it was an inside cabin, and, without a window, eventually claustrophobic.</p>
        <p>By early afternoon all 1,800 passengers and 700 crew members were on board and we set sail. The first two days were spent ocean cruising: across the English Channel into the North Sea, through the Kiel Canal (where in an amazing engineering feat, the ship's mast and funnel were flipped over so we could pass under a series of bridges) and into the Baltic Sea. Once I realized that all the seasickness cures that cruise veterans had urged me to buy were unnecessary, I tried to make the most of my floating home.</p>
        <p>It was a tastefully furnished, 12-deck colossus with three dining rooms that had two seatings for each meal; an intimate bistro where the food and ambience were a notch above the usual pleasant, if unexciting, fare; two informal cafeterias, one of which was open 24 hours a day; ample sun decks where attendants were always ready with lounges, towels, blankets for cold days, and, of course, drinks; two small outdoor pools, for dunking, not really swimming; a nightclub with nightly entertainment ranging from an abbreviated version of ''Crazy for You'' to a concert by ''the world's fastest banjo player''; a gym with, I'm told, the latest equipment; a health club where I indulged in three massages; shops; cocktail lounges where ''gentlemen hosts'' were happy to dance with unaccompanied females of a certain age, and a casino where, in record time (three minutes once) I lost $10 a night on the slot machines.</p>
        <p>THE service, by a friendly international crew, was impeccable; courteous to sometimes fawning, but never pushy. One could sit in the nightclub or the cocktail lounges for an entire evening without feeling pressure to buy a drink. Each evening, along with The G.C.T. Bulletin and a piece of chocolate, we received a Cruise News that in addition to ordering us to turn our watches back or forward, detailed the next day's nonstop activities aboard.</p>
        <p>There were bridge, golf, ballroom dancing and gambling lessons; craft workshops to learn how to make essentials like crepe-paper roses; talks on each port of call by both ship and G.C.T. personnel; shopping seminars; bingo; trivia contests (did you know that at any given hour there are 61,000 planes in the air over the United States?); and even sessions of exercise sitting down.</p>
        <p>Nowhere, from either the cruise line or G.C.T., both of which issued copious amounts of descriptive materials about our stops, was there a anything beyond the obvious historical facts and shopping hints. After once walking around the ship three and a half times to collect a congratulatory Mile With a Smile citation, I read a lot.</p>
        <p>But ostensibly we were on a ship that was to take us to see the sights on land. Long before we left on the trip, we had received a list of available shore excursions. Although two program directors accompanied us to act as troubleshooters, gift givers to clients marking birthdays or anniversaries, and hosts at a cocktail party, Grand Circle Travel, like other touring groups aboard, did not run the land tours. They were offered by the Norwegian Cruise Line.</p>
        <p>Carefully plotting our limited time ashore, we signed up for morning ''highlights'' tours of Helsinki, Stockholm, Copenhagen and Oslo. That, we thought, would give us time on our own. For St. Petersburg, to save the cost of getting visas and because we were advised that going it alone was difficult, we booked two tours: an evening trip to a suburb of the city to visit Pavlovsk, the summer palace of Paul I, and a full-day tour of Classical St. Petersburg that included the Hermitage.</p>
        <p>We thought wrong. The advance itinerary was misleading since a ''day'' in port, we discovered, began as late as 9 a.m. and ended at about 3:30 p.m. leaving us a scant hour or two to explore.</p>
        <p>Independently, we did manage to have lunch in Helsinki and wander through its lively waterfront market. On our night in Copenhagen, we took a cab to the Tivoli Gardens for a relaxed evening of big-band music and admiring the gardens and lights. And with the help of friendly passers-by, who in Scandinavia all seemed to speak English, we managed a public bus to the Vasa Museum in Stockholm to see a 17th-century warship that inexplicably sank soon after its launching; it was reclaimed from the mud in 1961. It was, we heard a British tourist say in a stage whisper, a peculiar monument to failure.</p>
        <p>On the whole, though, we were limited to the impressions that our native guides were programmed to share. True, some of these impressions will last a lifetime. Like the superb chamber music concert in the glow of a White Night summer evening in Pavlovsk. Or the stunning mosaics that give name to the Golden Hall in Stockholm's City Hall. Or the eccentric Vigeland Sculpture Garden in Oslo with its 150 statue groups representing one artist's view of humanity. Or the massive Baroque Christiansborg Palace in Copenhagen where contemporary Gobelin tapestries tell the history of Denmark in a thoroughly modern, sometimes abstract, way.</p>
        <p>But generally there was little time to soak up our surroundings as we raced to and then in and out of sites. For instance, it's hard enough to appreciate the badly hung and lighted works in the Hermitage. It's almost impossible when you're allotted about five seconds a painting.</p>
        <p>If the sightseeing was disappointing, the company I kept was amiable -- and spry. It was not, as I had feared, like waiting in line for early bird dinners in Florida. ''Mature'' covers a lot of ground, of course, both physically and chronologically.</p>
        <p>While there were some families and even honeymooners on board, the vast majority of passengers were of an age; that age. We were an average 64.1 years old, a cruise line spokeswoman said. My G.C.T. tour mates, an informal survey revealed, were retired professional couples, with only a sprinkling of us single folk.</p>
        <p>There were a few incidents reflecting the crankiness that can be part of the senior mystique. Like the platinum blonde (those of us with gray hair made up a distinct minority) who during an emergency boat drill peevishly insisted that ''on the Holland American line we did this in the dining room, not on the freezing deck.'' Several of my fellow travelers were in their 80's and 90's and, with accompanying deafness, often loud.</p>
        <p>Since the ship has staterooms for the handicapped, there were travelers in wheelchairs. Some like me carried canes. To accommodate everyone the tours had been rated with symbols denoting ''moderate walking over relatively level terrain'' or ''considerable walking and/or climbing.'' No one in authority, however, apparently told the guides about these ratings. Wherever we went we were led at a brisk clip with only occasional restroom stops. The long lines at ladies' rooms made our young women guides impatient. While this could have happened with any group, given our age bracket it was especially irksome.</p>
        <p>Fourteen days and about $7,000 later I was of several contradictory minds. As reluctant as I am to confess it, I did enjoy being waited on and pampered aboard ship. Once. More cruising could prove boring to my psyche and harmful to my waistline.</p>
        <p>Despite having to wear name tags and traveling in a pack, I found that a tour was not as regimented as I had feared. Was it less expensive? I thought so until I later learned that booking the cruise directly from the Norwegian Cruise Line would have cost slightly less.</p>
        <p>I have to admit that covering so much ground in such a short time would have been prohibitive physically. Having a cabin to settle into certainly beats living out of a suitcase. But paradoxically, the very accessibility that this cruise made possible is what also made it so frustrating. Knowing a city after even a week is doubtful; three hours is a mere tease.</p>
        <p>Getting the formula just right is a puzzlement; one that, given retirement, time and unlimited funds, I'd be happy to solve.</p>
        <p>If you go</p>
        <p>My Grand Circle Travel 16-day Ocean Cruisetour, which included round-trip fare from New York to London, transfers from and to Heathrow airport, two nights with full breakfasts in a first-class London hotel, a sightseeing tour of London, transfer to Dover, England, and 12 nights and 13 days with at least three meals a day aboard the Norwegian Dream of the Norwegian Cruise Line cost $4,145 for a guaranteed single reservation. Add taxes, fees (like an agriculture inspection fee of $2) and optional travel insurance and it came to $4,459. Grand Circle Travel, 347 Congress Street, Boston, Mass. 02210. Reservations and information: (800) 221-2610.</p>
        <p>In addition, I took six shore excursions that are offered by the Norwegian Dream: Gala Evening at Pavlovsk, four hours, $64; Classical St. Petersburg, nine hours, $150; Stockholm and City Hall, three hours, $42; Highlights of Oslo, three hours, $39; Helsinki City Sights, three hours, $42; Royal Copenhagen, three hours, $48. For information, (800) 327-7030 or www.ncl.com.</p>
        <p>Tipping aboard ship came to $10.50 a day for cabin and restaurant personnel and there were gratuities for local tour guides. Tips for our Grand Circle Travel companions were also expected, but not mandatory.</p>
        <p>For 2001, Grand Circle Travel has scheduled these trips aboard the Norwegian Dream every 13 days from April 27 to Sept. 6 -- this time  substituting Tallinn, Estonia, for Oslo. Rooms run from $3,095 to $5,295 each for double occupancy.</p>
        <p>At the Norwegian Cruise Line, the ''brochure rate'' (which a spokeswoman said is usually heavily discounted) is $2,099 to $7,150 for double occupancy. That is for the cruise alone and does not include the Grand Circle Travel extras. Information: (800) 327-7030 or www.ncl.com.</p>
