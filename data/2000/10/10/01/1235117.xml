        <p>THE talk Thursday night, on a barhopping jaunt through Midtown was: bars we have known and loved, bars we have worked in, bartenders we miss, bars we miss, drinks we miss, bars where we fell in love, oh, yes, and this movie.</p>
        <p>The movie, ''Two Family House,'' which opens on Friday, is about a bar, too. Which makes sense, because the director and the star are bar aficionados. Raymond De Felitta, the director, who also wrote the film, had an uncle named Buddy, one of those 50's guys with a small life and big dreams who wanted to buy a place in Staten Island, live upstairs, and open a bar where he could sing for customers. To cast Buddy, Mr. De Felitta chose Michael Rispoli -- here's a surprise -- an actor who once worked as a bartender.</p>

        <p>THE talk Thursday night, on a barhopping jaunt through Midtown was: bars we have known and loved, bars we have worked in, bartenders we miss, bars we miss, drinks we miss, bars where we fell in love, oh, yes, and this movie.</p>
        <p>The movie, ''Two Family House,'' which opens on Friday, is about a bar, too. Which makes sense, because the director and the star are bar aficionados. Raymond De Felitta, the director, who also wrote the film, had an uncle named Buddy, one of those 50's guys with a small life and big dreams who wanted to buy a place in Staten Island, live upstairs, and open a bar where he could sing for customers. To cast Buddy, Mr. De Felitta chose Michael Rispoli -- here's a surprise -- an actor who once worked as a bartender.</p>
        <p>It seems the pair use bars as navigational aids in their lives, and some of those bars overlap, in a six degrees kind of way. Starting at a friend's place on Eighth Avenue, Matt's Grill, Mr. Rispoli (the first Don on those earliest episodes of ''The Sopranos'') alternated between sitting and mixing a few. ''I never made a cosmopolitan until a few weeks ago,'' he said. ''I can make all the classics, grasshoppers, Rob Roys, old-fashioneds . . . ''</p>
        <p>Mr. De Felitta interrupted. ''Old-fashioneds,'' he said. ''Now there's a drink that never made a comeback. I wonder why?''</p>
        <p>Mr. De Felitta, who lives in Greenwich Village, waxed on about bars. ''A lot of Village history was held together by saloons,'' he said as he ticked off the missing. The Lion's Head, McBell's.</p>
        <p>Interrupting their wallow in watering hole arcana was an obligation to speak to cinema buffs at Jeffrey Lyons's film series on 57th Street where ''Two Family House'' had just been screened. A few questions: What happened to the white woman's black baby? (a fudge there); Did you do your own singing? (Mr. Rispoli said no). The hardest prop to find? (Mr. De Felitta said it was a smashable period juke box). After 25 minutes, the two headed off to Randolph's, a quiet bar at the Warwick hotel, for some vodka-based libations. ''When I see a crowded place, I just walk by,'' Mr. De Felitta said. ''I think, Aren't the kids having fun? At my age, I look for empty places.'' He is 35, though his cultural reference points are from the 50's. Randolph's had what he termed that ''Touch of Mink'' quality. ''Gig Young would be sitting right about here,'' he said, ''waiting for Doris Day.''</p>
        <p>Now to the falling in love part. ''I met my wife at the Riviera,'' Mr. Rispoli recounted. ''Blind date. And then we went to Chumley's. We walked up to this slot car place, on 19th, but we couldn't get in, so we went back for a nightcap at the Lion's Head and we started making out at the bar. And now we have three kids.'' The blind date, by the way, was arranged by the fellow who now has Matt's Grill. Remember Matt's Grill?</p>
        <p>The men were amazed to discover that they both knew Chipmunk, a legendary bartender years back at Churchill's, on the Upper East Side. ''Chipmunk, with the mustache and the teeth,'' Mr. De Felitta offered. Mr. Rispoli recalled, ''He drank Agent Orange -- Grand Marnier.''</p>
        <p>Mr. De Felitta said, ''He was Mr. Free Drinks.''</p>
        <p>''Hammered every night by 8,'' Mr. Rispoli shot back.</p>
        <p>Mr. De Felitta, astounded, said, ''Didn't you know that's who I named Chipmunk for in the script?'' ''No, really?'' and ''really'' went back and forth a couple of times. And then Mr. De Felitta revealed he knew where Chipmunk was now working, on First Avenue in the 70's. Plans were hatched. Chipmunk, if you're reading this, lay in some extra vodka.</p>
