        <p>Police officials said yesterday that investigators were searching for an unidentified rapist who is suspected in separate attacks on two young girls in Queens, most recently last Monday in Astoria.</p>
        <p>Investigators said they believed that the man singles out latchkey children, who arrive home from school before their parents return from work. Detectives first suspected a pattern after an 11-year-old girl told them that a man knocked on the door of her family's apartment about 3 p.m. Monday and told her that he was a plumber sent to repair a leak. Once inside the apartment, the police said, the man brandished a knife and raped and sodomized the girl before fleeing. Her parents called the police when they arrived home.</p>

        <p>Police officials said yesterday that investigators were searching for an unidentified rapist who is suspected in separate attacks on two young girls in Queens, most recently last Monday in Astoria.</p>
        <p>Investigators said they believed that the man singles out latchkey children, who arrive home from school before their parents return from work. Detectives first suspected a pattern after an 11-year-old girl told them that a man knocked on the door of her family's apartment about 3 p.m. Monday and told her that he was a plumber sent to repair a leak. Once inside the apartment, the police said, the man brandished a knife and raped and sodomized the girl before fleeing. Her parents called the police when they arrived home.</p>
        <p>Detectives said they recalled a similar incident that occurred on May 19, 1999. In that case, a 9-year-old girl was raped and sodomized at knifepoint in her Jackson Heights apartment, also by a man who persuaded her to open the door by telling her that he was a plumber.</p>
        <p>Each victim described her attacker as a 20- to 30-year-old dark-skinned man who is 5 foot 10 to 6 feet tall and weighs 160 to 180 pounds.</p>
