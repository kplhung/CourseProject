        <p>THIS is a story about the search for corporate citizenship, and a cautionary tale of money, influence and the limits of American power.</p>
        <p>The tale begins in 1925 in Augusta, Me., where a local company provocatively named American Foreign Power and Electric legally incorporated a subsidiary, the Electric Company of Ecuador (Emelec by its Spanish acronym), to serve the rapidly growing city of Guayaquil.</p>
        <p>It's a long way from Maine to Ecuador, but such was the reach of Yankee business ingenuity in those pre-globalization days. Foreign Power had already set up similar, quite lucrative companies in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile and Cuba. All were acquired in 1960 by Boise Cascade, the forest products company, which was interested because American Foreign Power had originally burned wood for fuel.</p>
        <p>The Ecuadorian operation thrived for years, even after the government started regulating its rates. Then, in the mid-1980's, disputes began flaring. The American owners said they could no longer charge enough to cover costs; the government said Emelec was not meeting the terms of its concession.</p>
        <p>In binding arbitration, the company won a ruling that the government had broken the 1925 contract and owed Emelec $52 million. The government refused to pay.</p>
        <p>While this dispute simmered, Emelec changed hands several times, eventually coming under the control of a Bahamas-based entity owned by an Ecuadorian tycoon named Fernando Aspiazu who has been in trouble with his government. Yet it remained an American corporation, filing an American tax return each year, though it hasn't reported a profit or paid a dollar in taxes since 1985.</p>
        <p>Now the story takes a twist. Mr. Aspiazu also happened to own a bank in Ecuador, the Banco del Progreso, which failed in 1999. To recapitalize the bank, he took steps to sell stock in his power company, which he placed in a trust.</p>
        <p>The government of Ecuador seized the bank before the sale, and arrested Mr. Aspiazu. (He has not been charged, but remains in jail.) Mr. Aspiazu then tried to keep the power company's assets out of government hands by creating another trust to sell Emelec's assets and repay thousands of angry bank depositors. An American, Peter Heberling of the Latin America Finance Group, was named the sole trustee, and William Van Dieppen, president of the group, planned to help with the liquidation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Aspiazu's motives are less than clear, but he seemed to think he could act like Robin Hood. ''More than 500,000 families are affected by the bank's failure,'' Mr. Van Dieppen said. ''Making sure they get repaid can't hurt Aspiazu's chances of having his name rehabilitated.''</p>
        <p>Any American investor lured by Latin America's promise fears corruption and complication, which go hand in hand. Ecuador is one of South America's least stable countries, and early this year things really started to come apart. The economy was in such a shambles that the president, Jamil Mahuad, tried to scrap its currency in favor of dollars, but people took to the streets, the army took the Presidential Palace and Mr. Mahuad took off for quieter quarters.</p>
        <p>As the dust was settling, Mr. Van Dieppen was talking to four potential American buyers for Emelec, including Enron. But the new president of Ecuador, Gustavo Noboa, needed to send a message that things had changed in the country for people like Mr. Aspiazu. He sent troops and the police to seize Emelec headquarters in Guayaquil.</p>
        <p>The company appealed to the American embassy in Quito, only to be told that Emelec, the direct descendant of American Foreign Power, was not considered an American corporation. ''The State Department did not do its homework,'' Mr. Van Dieppen said, adding that he thought that the ambassador, Gwen Clare, had sided with the Ecuadorian government. Mr. Van Dieppen said his calls to the ambassador and the State Department were not returned. ''We felt totally abandoned,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Van Dieppen then turned to the one tried-and-true fallback for any company anywhere in the world: he hired lawyers to push Emelec's interests in Washington. He went to Capitol Hill and lined up the support of Senator Jesse Helms. For a time he also paid Kissinger McLarty Associates, the high-octane Washington consulting firm led by Henry Kissinger and Thomas F. McLarty III, President Clinton's former chief of staff, to intervene.</p>
        <p>The investment in influence apparently paid off. On Aug. 28, Ms. Clare said in a letter that the dispute had been raised by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright during a visit to Ecuador. ''The government of Ecuador should quickly and fairly sort out the competing claims on Emelec's assets,'' Ms. Clare wrote, adding that she looked forward to working with the trust.</p>
        <p>A State Department official familiar with the case said the embassy's initial reaction was based on a mistrust of Mr. Aspiazu's role. But after Senator Helms's office and Emelec's lawyers and representatives in Washington expressed interest, department officials decided to take another look. ''Some things could have been resolved faster,'' the official conceded. ''But these guys had a lot of things on their platter.''</p>
        <p>He was alluding to the new administration led by Mr. Noboa, who also seems to have changed his position. When he was victoriously touring Emelec's seized offices, he brushed off reporters' questions about constitutional violations, declaring, ''I have to do what I need to do -- impose order on this country.'' But in a recent speech to New York investors, he seemed almost contrite, saying that the confidence of American investors, which Ecuador desperately needs, is being restored because the nation is ''beginning to change.''</p>
        <p>In the end, what happened to American Foreign Power exposes some of the rules of global influence game as it is now played.</p>
        <p>''Never assume that the United States government is necessarily going to be on your side in your hour of need,'' Mr. Van Dieppen said. Without top-notch representation in Washington, he said, ''no one is going to take you seriously'' there.</p>
        <p>Or in Guayaquil, either, it seems.</p>
