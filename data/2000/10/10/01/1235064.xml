        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In Lisa Zeidner's otherwise cogent review of past and present film adaptations of Henry James novels [''It's Hard Adapting Henry James. Still, They Keep Trying,'' Sept. 10], one reads the following aside: ''Hot tip to development folk: still awaiting adaptation is James's seriocomic gem 'What Maisie Knew,' a child's-eye view of an ugly divorce.''</p>
        <p>In fact, there has been at least one direct film treatment of this novella: Babette Mangolte's 1975 film of the same name. I would also argue that Rolf de Heer's 1997 film ''The Quiet Room,'' shot in Australia, is indisputably an adaptation of the James story, though James is not acknowledged in the credits.</p>
        <p>Ms. Mangolte's 58-minute film -- with Epp Kotkas, Kate Manheim, Yvonne Rainer, John Erdman and Philip Glass -- was presented in recent years at the Donnell Library in Manhattan as part of its ''Meet the Makers'' film series. Today the film is in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art in Paris.</p>
        <p>Describing the film, the flyer distributed at the screening states: ''What you see is what Maisie sees, as well as how she sees it and what she thinks she sees. So, the camera is used to objectify a vision, which is descriptive of the character Maisie. This vision is presented through a succession of narrative tableaux, composed of various everyday situations. The dramatic tension is created by the evolution of Maisie's perception of these situations.''</p>
        <p>''The Quiet Room'' -- featuring Celine O'Leary (Mother), Paul Blackwell (Father), Chloe Ferguson (Girl, age 7) and Phoebe Ferguson (Girl, age 3) -- is remarkable in that there is not a word of dialogue spoken by the ''Maisie'' character, who uses her silence as a weapon to reunite her feuding parents. (There are occasional flashbacks in which the girl's voice-over narration is heard.)</p>
        <p>In his March 1997 review in The New York Times, Stephen Holden wrote: ''Rarely has a movie entered the consciousness of a child as deeply and convincingly. . . . [The film] is an exploration of the power that children wield over their parents and an almost intimidating reminder that not much escapes our children's vision, as much as we wish it might.''</p>
        <p>I feel certain that James -- the author of the experimental novel ''The Awkward Age,'' which presents the characters' thoughts as so many ''lamps'' of consciousness -- would have approved of Ms. Mangolte's use of the camera as ''seeing eye.'' Similarly, in her ability to manipulate her parents, Mr. de Heer's Girl is a kindred spirit not only of James's Maisie but of Flora and Miles in ''The Turn of the Screw.''</p>
