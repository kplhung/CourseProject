        <p>WHEN the guy wielding a broom to sweep up the front steps is the same guy who wielded a brush to paint the picture on the wall, it's a good bet that you've entered that corner of the art world known as the cooperative gallery.</p>
        <p>In these endeavors, mainstays of the modern art world, artists open their checkbooks to help pay for the costs of administering and operating exhibit space, which they may very well have helped refurbish with their own hands.</p>
        <p>In return, they get a guaranteed place to take part in group and solo shows. Such exhibitions differ from the commercial or nonprofit gallery show and from museums because, for the most part, they are not fully curated packages that deal with a specific theme, clientele or interest. Besides getting a consistent spot to display their work, cooperative artists have fewer limitations on what can be shown.</p>
        <p>Here is a look at several cooperative galleries and how they operate:</p>
        <p>The Piermont Flywheel Gallery in Piermont, established in 1992, is a storefront on a commercial street. Its membership is 20, and it features two gallery spaces; one is primarily used for one-person shows, and the other is for group exhibitions.</p>
        <p>''We run at a 19-month cycle,'' said the gallery president, Gene Powell, a painter from Valley Cottage, near Nyack. ''This way, everyone gets a chance to have a one-person show that runs three weeks. We also have a Web site, www.Piermontflywheel .com, where you could go to see what we have on display, and to see additional work by our member artists.''</p>
        <p>As with many cooperatives, the members come from as far away as they are willing to commute. The Piermont gallery has members from Putnam and Orange Counties, from New Jersey and from Connecticut as well as two from Piermont, Sally Savage, a photographer, and Margaret Grace, a painter -- ''who also happens to be our founding mother,'' Mr. Powell said.</p>
        <p>Right now, the gallery is looking for a few new members. ''The only thing that we won't consider is craft such as jewelry and ceramics,'' he said. ''We first and foremost look at the quality of the work. We ask potential members to submit slides and supportive materials as well as four original works. When we review the work of applicants, there must be a quorum present, and if the artist receives a majority of votes, they are asked to join.''</p>
        <p>Artists have a variety of reasons for joining a cooperative gallery. ''You can do what you want here,'' said Margery Deckinger-Myerson, a painter from Nanuet. ''There's no one telling you, 'You can't do paintings that combine orange and green.' That actually happened to me. I was told the painting would not sell with that color combination.''</p>
        <p>William Chaiken, a painter from Hillburn, N.Y., says that being part of a cooperative gives him the time to spend on his work that he used to spend trekking from gallery to gallery. ''I've had many shows in commercial galleries in the city, and they don't like to give out your home address,'' he said. ''Here, we promote the artist as an individual. Visitors and prospective buyers can look at our work here at any time, and they can reach us directly through the gallery.''</p>

        <p>Not for Members Only</p>
        <p>In Peekskill, Gallerie Jjenth has a membership that accepts works of nonmember artists. Its active membership stands at five; however, its current exhibition, titled ''Hot Stuff,'' features the work of 11 artists, including one from Rhode Island.</p>
        <p>The gallery president, Jo-Ann Brody, a sculptor from Peekskill, has been involved with Gallerie Jjenth, which is a second-floor walk-up overlooking a commercial street, since its inception five years ago.</p>
        <p>''We are set up so that everyone, member or not, pays a per-month fee for the time their work is in the gallery,'' she said. ''Members also have an opportunity to have a one-person show, and again, that same fee, which covered them for participation in the group show, is due at the time of their solo show. In order to be considered for member status, an artist would have to have had work in three of our group shows.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Brody said the exhibition schedule gave her a powerful incentive to create works. ''We show the equivalent of three new pieces every other month,'' she said. ''That's an incredibly positive pressure to have. In addition, the active members are encouraged to critique members' new works as they are brought in. We discuss what works, what doesn't work -- the content of the art, the color and the technique are all discussed. We have one meeting for every show, and the discussion that is initiated at the drop-off often carries through the hanging and the reception of the show.''</p>
        <p>Nancy Faulds, the gallery's treasurer and also a founding member, said the discussions helped improve her photography. ''The critiques showed me that my work needed to be more uniform thematically,''  said Ms. Faulds, a photographer from Putnam Valley. ''That realization brought a much needed rhythm to my work.''</p>
        <p>The space itself also plays a role in defining members' works. ''It's a trying ground,'' Ms. Brody said. ''When I bring my work here, I can immediately see if it says or does what I wanted it to. It's amazing. What I've just completed, and what I could not get a good look at in my cluttered studio, comes to light in a formal gallery space.''</p>

        <p>With Shows, New Members</p>
        <p>The Upstream Gallery, a cooperative gallery housed in a storefront on a commercial street in Dobbs Ferry, finds some of its new members in its own open-group shows. ''That's how I got involved with this gallery,'' said Sondra Gold, who is one of the 17 current members. ''If we see the work of a new artist we like in one of our group shows, then they are asked to submit slides. At that time, we explain the ground rules, making them aware of the cost and the sitting arrangements. They later bring in original works to be reviewed by our members. When they bring their work in, then it's serious.''</p>
        <p>Having group shows of outside artists is also an excellent way of having new people get to know the gallery, Ms. Gold added. ''It's very good publicity for us because they in turn will bring in people from their mailing lists.''</p>
        <p>Nat Meyer-Shapiro joined Upstream at its inception, back in 1992. ''We moved to Dobbs Ferry from Hastings, when we lost our lease,'' he recalled. ''At that time, a few members left the group. It took almost two years to re-form, and we re-opened here on Main Street in 1997.</p>
        <p>''Those of us who stayed from the original group worked well together -- it was a good base,'' he said. ''But we needed more members to make the membership fees reasonable. A co-op cannot fail because of a lack of sales. That's the best part. It exists without the pressure of sales. As long as we have enough members, we stay open.''</p>
        <p>While most commercial galleries take a 50 percent commission, he said Upstream took only 10 percent.</p>
        <p>Ms. Gold said Upstream benefited from the fact that there are 13 places to exhibit art in Dobbs Ferry. ''People who go to an opening next door at the Main Street Gallery, for instance, would be inclined to come in and see what's going on in our gallery,'' she said. ''If we have an opening, then they go over there. In fact, most of the galleries in Dobbs Ferry have gotten together. We've formed a coalition, and we're working on getting organized. We've purchased advertising together; we're making banners.''</p>
        <p>Unlike Gallerie Jjenth, the Upstream Gallery members do not formally encourage  critiques from other members about an individual's work. ''It's a sensitive area,''  Mr. Meyer-Shapiro said..</p>
        <p>''We get the message when one of our paintings or sculptures is not complimented,'' he said. ''It's subtle, and that's enough. There are many different optic rules, and it's important that one does not impose their aesthetic on another person's art.''</p>

        <p>Putting Principles First</p>
        <p>The newest, and the most distinctly different cooperative effort in the area, is Collaborative Concepts, which is focusing its efforts primarily in Putnam and Dutchess Counties.</p>
        <p>Until now Collaborative Concepts has not had a stable location. But this month, it will move into a 6,400-square-foot building in Beacon, which will be its home base.</p>
        <p>Over the summer the group of 24 exhibitors put together a multimedia show at the McDonnell Atelier, a two-story, converted industrial space on a quiet side street in Cold Spring, which featured many of the Hudson Valley's most prominent artists.</p>
        <p>One member, Tony Moore, a ceramic artist and painter from Cold Spring, helped install the Atelier show, putting in two weeks of long days that sometime ended at 4 or 5 o'clock in the morning. ''I tried to do the absolute very best I could do for every single artist and every piece of art,'' he said. ''There was no hierarchy involved with regard to the size of the work. It's principles above personality.''</p>
        <p>Kate Rogovin, a sculptor from Cold Spring, said of the Atelier installation: ''There were a lot of things that I would rather not ever do again, while at the same time it was such a success. I also have to say that the building itself is inspirational. It was somehow magically transformed.''</p>
        <p>Greg Glasson, a sculptor from Beacon, said: ''It's a frontier philosophy. If you look at how we approached this space; we initially started with the main room on the first floor, eventually taking over the whole building.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Moore, taking an overview, said: ''I don't see this group as having any boundaries. We can do anything. We can bring in different people from anywhere. They don't have to be from the Hudson Valley as long as that person is willing to participate. However, there are still those nuts and bolts to contend with. You can't run before you can walk and you get the sense that the next project will be more difficult to do because our standards are very high.''</p>
        <p>It would seem that the main difference between the stable cooperative gallery and the nomadic-type group like Collaborative Concepts is that each show at the latter becomes an event. The coordination of the exhibition at McDonnell Atelier, where Collaborative Concepts is currently showing members' work, was carried primarily on the shoulders of three: Mary Madden, Herman Roggeman, a sculptor and painter from Garrison, and Ellen Haven, of Garrison, who is not an artist but the publicist of the group. With Ms. Madden leading the way, each was responsible for the management of the exhibition, whether it was which lights or what paint to buy, where to publicize the show or what would be the agenda for the next meeting. Ms. Madden of Beacon, who is not an artist, has a regular day job as senior vice president of the Hudson Valley Federal Credit Union in Poughkeepsie. She is always looking toward the future. ''We've chosen our next site in Beacon, where we will hold exhibitions through January of 2001.''</p>
        <p>A. Eric Arctander, a painter from Putnam Valley, who believes that commercial galleries ''commodify'' art, said: ''A lot of what is wrong with the art scene today lies at the heart of the gallery system. We're trying to do something different. We were asking ourselves, How can we be different and not be confused with the standard cooperative gallery?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Moore said that the cooperative includes both formally trained artists who have exhibited in museums and others who have virtually no track record, including Augustine Della Vecchia of Plainville, Conn., an electrician by trade who as a sculptor, makes hand-carved and turned vessels that the gallery exhibits. ''He didn't go to art school; he doesn't have an M.F.A.,'' Mr. Moore said, adding: ''People are blown away by his work. They love it -- he sells it, but would his work be seen in a commercial gallery in New York? Probably not.''</p>
        <p>Martee Levi, a painter from Garrison, said Collaborative Concepts disproves one stereotype about artists: ''that we are loners.'' Mr. Moore summed up the philosophy as ''what can I do for the show, not what can I get out of it?'' Which is not to say, he hastened to add, that putting on the shows is easy.</p>
        <p>''There were situations that were just horrendous,'' he said, ''and afterward, you throw your arms around a person and a tear would come to your eye and you felt that you truly touched that person's soul.''</p>
        <p>Collaborative Concepts can be reached through McDonnell Atelier, 11 Peekskill Road, Cold Spring. Telephone: (845) 265-7262.</p>
