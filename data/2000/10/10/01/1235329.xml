        <p>Civil libertarians and journalists have reacted angrily and warily to a surprise government inspection of electrical hookups at the headquarters of the Dawn Group of Newspapers, a visit by engineers and armed soldiers presumed to be an effort by the military government to intimidate the press.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, the inspectors spent four hours at the Karachi offices of the well-respected newspaper Dawn and the monthly magazine The Herald.

        <p>Civil libertarians and journalists have reacted angrily and warily to a surprise government inspection of electrical hookups at the headquarters of the Dawn Group of Newspapers, a visit by engineers and armed soldiers presumed to be an effort by the military government to intimidate the press.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, the inspectors spent four hours at the Karachi offices of the well-respected newspaper Dawn and the monthly magazine The Herald. They claimed to be looking for illegal electrical connections, a common source of revenue loss for the government. No major infractions were discovered.</p>
        <p>A statement by the company read: ''The highhanded manner in which the inspection by the army monitoring team was carried out left the indelible impression that a punitive raid rather than an electrical inspection was the basic objective of the operation.</p>
        <p>''It is very difficult for governments to live with an independent press in Pakistan. Of late, the present administration has become increasingly hostile toward any criticism whatsoever.''</p>
        <p>Strong protests about news coverage have become a recent staple of the military government, which seized power in a bloodless coup nearly a year ago.</p>
        <p>During a recent visit to New York, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, the nation's chief executive, was asked about his perceived animosity to the news media. ''I have no desire to stifle the press although some of what is printed in Pakistan would justify stifling it 10 times over,'' he responded.</p>
        <p>Hostile treatment of journalists was a hallmark of the government of the deposed prime minister, Nawaz Sharif. Common tactics were beatings, arrests and tax audits.</p>
        <p>When General Musharraf took power, he promised to safeguard a free press. That pledge has proven nettlesome. The military faces increasing criticism as it slowly plots a return to democracy and tries to thwart corruption and collect taxes.</p>
        <p>On Friday, in an official response to the Dawn group's complaints, the government that said it was being unfairly maligned and that the episode was an example of press irresponsibility rather then political intimidation. A government spokesman said Dawn had been exaggerating.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, human rights and civil liberties groups have condemned the military leadership for ordering a ''raid.'' So have various press organizations and political parties.</p>
        <p>The Nation newspaper, one of Dawn's rivals, said Friday in an editorial that it hoped that the incident in Karachi was ''not part of a scheme with wider ramifications.</p>
        <p>''One also hopes that it had been ordered by some overzealous and shortsighted functionary not sensitive to its full implications,'' it added.</p>
