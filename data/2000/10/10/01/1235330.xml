        <p>Kozmo.com, which strives to be the 7-Eleven and Blockbuster of online delivery companies, started in Manhattan. Urbanfetch.com, one of its main competitors, has one of the strongest presences in the city. YourGrocer.com, an online supermarket that serves much of the New York region, gained its first footholds in TriBeCa and Greenwich Village.</p>
        <p>They came for the density, the upscale customers and the advantage of not having to pay the high rents of their bricks-and-mortar competitors. City and state officials seem to be tripping over one another to offer grants and tax breaks to lure more of these desktop-to-doorstep companies, which deliver a range of items, including soap and DVD players, to New Yorkers.</p>
        <p>But in all the furor to bring new businesses and jobs to New York, critics say that an important question is not being asked: Can the online delivery model work in Manhattan? The answer varies. But there seems to be a consensus on at least one thing: in Manhattan, success for these companies is going to be harder than it seemed.</p>
        <p>''I'll be the first to tell you that Manhattan, specifically, is one of the most difficult areas for any kind of new consumer service,'' said Shawn Milne, a senior analyst at E*Offering, an online brokerage firm that sells Internet stocks. ''It is very difficult logistically.''</p>
        <p>If the companies cannot succeed in Manhattan, some critics wonder whether it is a good idea for the state and city to provide them with economic incentives -- in effect, becoming venture capitalists with taxpayer money. Many online delivery companies have underestimated the difficulty of operating in Manhattan, the analysts said.</p>
        <p>Urbanfetch, which Kozmo is considering acquiring, stopped renting movies in Manhattan and Brooklyn last month because the profit margin on each videotape or DVD was not high enough to justify the costs of delivery. Kozmo and Urbanfetch began requiring minimum orders. And YourGrocer.com moved to Elmsford, N.Y., last year to be able to focus better on suburban families in places like Westchester and in Fairfield County, Conn., executives said.</p>
        <p>But the problems did not stop there. Call it revenge of the bricks and mortar. Several traditional grocery stores have begun their own delivery services to complement their regular business. As the logic goes, the most traditional grocery stores -- whose main business is done through their storefronts -- can afford to lose money in order to cut into the online companies' margins.</p>
        <p>In November 1997, Allen MacCannell founded NYCGrocery.com in Lower Manhattan. The company went to local markets and shops, bundling the orders and then delivering them to customers' doorsteps. The company was unable to navigate Manhattan's traffic congestion and difficulties like doormen-staffed  buildings unwilling to take deliveries when tenants were absent.</p>
        <p>''Suburbs,'' said Mr. MacCannell, whose company was bought in 1999 by a venture capital fund that owned YourGrocer.com. ''That's where you get the unbelievably good prices.''</p>
        <p>Many online companies thought that Manhattan's density would work to their advantage because they would be able to maximize profits by making dozens of deliveries in a small area in one trip.</p>
        <p>But analysts say they believe that many of them did not anticipate some of the logistical challenges. Delivering items by bicycle can be more expensive than using vans, because couriers, who are paid by the hour, cannot carry as many items.</p>
        <p>Analysts also thought that the high price of real estate in Manhattan would put the competitors of online delivery companies at a great disadvantage. What they have found, instead, is that the intangible benefits of not having a Manhattan storefront must be countered with a flurry of outreach efforts and advertising. Urbanfetch even tried opening a booth to give itself a physical presence in Pennsylvania Station.</p>
        <p>Probably the most difficult challenge, analysts said, revolves around consumer habits: Manhattanites are often less likely to purchase in bulk, which decreases the profits made on each delivery.</p>
        <p>''Kozmo and Urbanfetch were a good story when profits did not matter,'' said Ned Vickers, who is starting an online company, NEDexpress, that will team up with traditional retailers, like Fairway.</p>
        <p>There are signs of hope, however. Kozmo, which delivers in 11 cities, has seen its revenues increase and expenses drop since it began reconfiguring parts of its business this year, laying off about 300 workers.</p>
        <p>Gerry Burdo, the recently appointed president and acting chief executive of Kozmo, said average orders in Manhattan had reached about $18, up from $10 in January.</p>
        <p>The company's highest expense, labor costs for couriers, who average about 2.5 deliveries an hour, has stayed at about $12 per hour. Other overhead costs -- rent at $10 to $12 per square foot, management costs, technology and others -- have led to deficits. But Kozmo officials, who refused to discuss their balance sheets in detail, expect to make a profit in Manhattan soon.</p>
        <p>The keys, said officials at the company, which has four warehouses in Manhattan, are to increase the number of deliveries couriers make per trip and the amount each customer is paying per order, and to build warehouses that can quickly get orders off the shelves. (Kozmo's newest warehouse in Manhattan, on East 45th Street near First Avenue, can process every order in about one minute, officials said.)</p>
        <p>Still, some in the industry have doubts. So, if online delivery companies already in Manhattan cannot seem to turn profits, some critics wonder whether it is a good idea for city and state officials to provide similar companies interested in the market with financial incentives.</p>
        <p>Webvan, an online delivery company that was scheduled to open two large warehouses in the South Bronx and Bergen County, N.J., bringing more than 1,900 jobs to the region, has only fueled that argument. Two weeks ago the company, based in San Francisco, said it would delay its most immediate expansion plans, including the New Jersey warehouse.</p>
        <p>Technology industry analysts said the delay also cast doubt on the company's plans for the Bronx warehouse, which was supposed to provide more than 900 jobs.</p>
        <p>Richard Lipsky, a lobbyist for several small-business associations in New York City, said it made no sense to provide economic incentives to companies that had not proved long-term profitability. ''The city is acting like an overeager novice investor,'' Mr. Lipsky said. ''It is putting a lot of faith in companies that have not proven themselves.''</p>
        <p>Mitchell Moss, director of the Taub Urban Research Center at New York University, who has studied the effect of technology companies on urban areas, said government officials could be wasting their time providing some Internet companies with incentives.</p>
        <p>''The traditional instruments to attract and retain businesses are designed for larger companies that have an established history,'' Mr. Moss said. ''So, here when you are dealing with firms that are really at the embryonic stage, then you need to think a little more strategically.''</p>
        <p>Still, Charles Gargano, the chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation, the state economic development agency, said there were ways to protect taxpayer money. ''We don't pick and choose one industry over another,'' he said. ''What we do is get a commitment that they are going to come to New York and create new jobs.''</p>
        <p>Michael Carey, the president of the New York City Economic Development Corporation, said that the city had tried to research each of the Internet companies it had given incentives to, but that it was difficult to predict outcomes.</p>
        <p>''There is no question that there are companies in this new-media world that may not make it,'' he said. ''But if you look at what has happened in this industry in the last few years, it has become an important part of the city's economy.''</p>
