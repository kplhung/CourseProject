        <p>AFTER a long struggle, a 1,000 acre residential development aimed at middle-income workers in nearby high-tech and service companies has begun to emerge within former woodlands three miles east of this major corporate center.</p>
        <p>Moving vans pulled up in August to the first of 500 homes that will be built by next summer by the development arm of the Weyerhaeuser Corporation, the giant forest products company.</p>
        <p>The project, called Redmond Ridge, will eventually hold 1,500 homes and condominiums priced from $180,000 to $460,000 as well as 272 apartments and a 1.2 million square foot business park and 100,000 square feet of retail space. The developers expect the project to be home eventually to a total of 4,000 to 5,500 people.</p>
        <p>Because of its location on the eastern fringe of a metropolitan area, Redmond, once a logging and farm community, grew more slowly than other King County cities to the west, like Seattle, Bellevue and Kirkland, which are situated on the shores of Lake Washington or Puget Sound. Beyond Redmond to the east are unincorporated rural King County and small outlying cities. The county ends near Snoqualmie Pass, about 30 miles away in the Cascade Mountains.</p>
        <p>The Redmond area began changing rapidly in 1985 when the Microsoft Corporation built a sprawling corporate campus here, and other companies followed, including AT&amp;T Wireless, Space Labs, Genetic Systems and Eddie Bauer. From 12,000 jobs in 1980, employment has swollen to 63,000 today, of which about a third are at Microsoft.  The town's population has doubled to 44,000, and there is intense demand for new housing.</p>
        <p>Ten years ago, King County approved Redmond Ridge as a fully contained community, which was not supposed to have a negative impact on its rural surroundings. But bitter fights and lawsuits from citizens' groups erupted, since Redmond Ridge was the only high-density urban pocket in the county's land-use plan not connected to an existing city.</p>
        <p>The fighting was not resolved until this summer, and most opposition faded away when the Central Puget Sound Growth Management Hearing Board denied an appeal by a citizens' group that was asking the board to reconsider King County's earlier approval for Redmond Ridge. To Joseph Elfelt, leader of the citizens' group Friends of the Law, however, ''Redmond Ridge is an urban island that was leapfrogged into a rural area.''</p>
        <p>Speaking just after he had finished unloading hay from a semi-trailer for three horses he pastures on a five acre homestead he purchased seven years ago, he added: ''I am going to be squeezed out. There is no way the rural area between Redmond Ridge and the city will remain rural.''</p>
        <p>In Redmond, housing prices are relatively steep. In King County over all, including Seattle, 12,551 homes sold in the last six months at an average of $318,719, while in Redmond the 676 properties that were sold averaged some 25 percent higher: $400,776.</p>
        <p>Even with prices above the county average, Redmond is not producing homes as quickly as many would like. Faline Blyth, an associate broker at Windermere Real Estate said, ''The city has a shortage of building sites,'' adding, ''Finding a home site is like looking for a needle in a haystack.''</p>
        <p>Ron Fowler, a broker for John L. Scott Real Estate said, ''The state's Growth Management Act allocates target housing goals for cities, and Redmond has not reached those goals for providing homes.''</p>
        <p>Part of the problem is the breadth of demand for housing. ''My guess,'' said William Boucher, marketing director for the Quadrant Corporation, Weyerhaeuser's development unit, ''is that there is a huge chunk of people at Redmond high-tech and service companies making $50,000 to $70,000 a year. They want affordable housing close to jobs, so that they do not have to commute to suburbs where housing is available and cheaper.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Boucher scoffs at the notion that workers at Microsoft and other high-tech companies are mostly millionaires with stock options. ''Buyers are not pulling up in BMW's; they drive here in minivans and Saturns,'' he said. A buyer profile at Redmond Ridge shows that 80 percent of the people who have purchased homes are employed in high-tech companies, are in their mid 20's to late 30's and are a mix of singles, married childless couples and families. The first 25 buyers had an average household income of $80,000.</p>
        <p>THEIR homes are on land that has been carved from 1,500 acres of timberland on Novelty Hill that Weyerhaeuser bought a century ago. Its logging helped fuel Redmond's early growth with jobs and lumber. But the land was pegged for development because the noise and large trucks that are part of logging were no longer compatible with residential neighbors who surround the forests.</p>
        <p>The three miles between Redmond Ridge and the city is unincorporated King County and largely built up with homes, stables and a few small farms and subdivisions. Adjacent to Redmond Ridge is a 10-year-old subdivision called Westchester, where homes are priced from about $700,000 to $1.1 million.</p>
        <p>The narrow Novelty Hill Road, once a muddy, rutted logging road, now is clogged with commuters who work in Redmond or other cities but who recently moved to rural communities east of Redmond Ridge, like Duvall, Monroe and Carnation, where new subdivisions are replacing dairy farms.</p>
        <p>The traffic funnels through Redmond's downtown, creating rush hour traffic gridlock.</p>
        <p>Redmond's mayor, Rosemarie Ives, an opponent of Redmond Ridge, is worried about the added traffic from the devlopment and from the 3,000 to 5,000 people expected to work in its high-tech business park.</p>
        <p>Mayor Ives said the city has identified $9 million in road improvements it will make, and the city council accepted $3.5 million in mitigation fees from Weyerhaeuser. Weyerhaeuser is also spending $6.5 million to install stoplights and turn lanes on Novelty Hill Road and other streets.</p>
        <p>Redmond Ridge itself is a flurry of activity these days as bulldozers prepare sites and trucks scurry over the just-paved streets carrying dirt or building materials. Homes that are sold sport yard signs that say ''Home occupied, please respect owner's privacy'' and are next to others under construction by five builders.</p>
        <p>Condominiums of 1,000 to 1,300 square feet with two or three bedrooms will cost $180,000 to the low $200,000 range. Town homes with 2,000 square feet and three bedrooms range from $280,000 to more than $300,000. Detached homes with 2,085 to 3,300 square feet and three bedrooms are priced from $260,000 to $550,000.</p>
        <p>Also planned are 272 one- to three-bedroom apartments and town houses with 750 square feet to 1,700 square feet that will be rented at monthly rates from $980 to $1,800.</p>
        <p>A fiberoptic network connects homes, and homeowners have a choice of two cable television providers and high-speed Internet access. At the community center, an $80,000 demonstration garden will educate busy homeowners on how to use low-upkeep native plants like sword ferns in their yards. Some 60 percent of Redmond Ridge will remain forests, parks or wetlands, with 15 miles of trails on new paths and old logging roads.</p>
        <p>On 1,000 adjacent acres called Blakely Ridge, Quadrant also plans to start construction in 2002 on 950 single-family and multifamily homes, assisted living units and a public golf course in a complex for active seniors. The company purchased the property in 1997 from Port Blakely Tree Farms.</p>
        <p>Redmond Ridge is coming to market at a time the red-hot Seattle area housing market is slowing, partly because of higher interest rates. But Barbara Chilcote, Redmond Ridge general manager. said: ''We're not worried. Homes are selling like hot cakes. We know the housing demand is there.''</p>
