        <p>THIS month backhoes will begin tearing into 17 acres here for an office building that, like others in recent years in the flush office market along the Princeton Route 1 corridor, will be built on speculation.</p>
        <p>But the new building, University Square, is unlike the others because of its size. With 316,000 square feet on five floors, it will break from the pattern of low-slung corporate boxes, averaging 100,000 square feet, that line the 20-mile corridor stretching from New Brunswick to Trenton. The developer is the Reckson Associates Realty Corporation, a real estate investment trust based in Melville, on Long Island, with offices in New Jersey.</p>
        <p>Commercial brokers say an aversion to risk is one reason other developers are not putting up larger buildings. Financing for speculative construction, they add, is still tight and will keep such projects to a modest size.</p>
        <p>Moreover, ''the bread-and-butter tenants'' in the Princeton market need 25,000 square feet and are well served by the smaller buildings, said J. Douglas Petrozzini, a senior vice president at the Edison office of Grubb &amp; Ellis, the commercial real estate services company.</p>
        <p>Many larger tenants in the area, he added, typically build their own space or have it built for them. Merrill Lynch is building, in phases over the next year, 1.25 million square feet of office space in eight buildings on some of the 450 acres it owns at Scotch Road and Interstate 95 in Hopewell. The project, which sparked fierce resistance from some local residents, could grow to 3.5 million square feet.</p>
        <p>And RCN, a cable company, will soon begin building the first 610,,000-square-foot,  four-building phase of its planned 135-acre, 1.5 million-square-foot campus at Princeton Pike and I-295 in Lawrenceville, said Robert T. Morford, a principal at the Garibaldi Group, a real estate services company in Chatham that represented RCN.</p>
        <p>Jeffrey Schotz, senior vice president and managing director of Reckson's New Jersey operation, said University Square was designed for tenants who wanted large blocks of space ''and until now had limited options.'' He said his company was financing the $45 million project with internal funds.</p>
        <p>University Square is the first building Reckson is constructing in New Jersey since it entered the state in 1997. Since then, the company has acquired land on which it could build some 1.6 million square feet of space, as well as older office buildings it has renovated.</p>
        <p>Brokers said the construction of University Square, while unusual, was not surprising. In the last two years, there has been two million square feet of speculative offices built in the Princeton market, according to Cushman &amp; Wakefield, the commercial real estate services company.</p>
        <p>AND projects totaling 710,000 more feet are under way or about to start. In addition to University Square, they include a 140,000-square-foot building planned at the Carnegie Center office park in West Windsor. A 70,850-square-foot building is rising and another with 100,000 square feet is planned on land sold to separate developers by Princeton University. The buildings are part of the 2,200-acre Princeton Forrestal Center, which straddles Plainsboro and South Brunswick Townships.</p>
        <p>That production pace has some real estate executive concerned about overbuilding. But brokers say that will not occur as long as lenders keep the lid on financing and the state's economy and job growth continue to stoke tenants' demand for space and their desire to be near Princeton University.</p>
        <p>''The Princeton market,'' said David Knights, marketing director at Princeton Forrestal Center, ''is supported by three legs: the pharmaceutical, financial services and telecommunication industries. And with the economy the way it is, all three legs are growing -- and aggressively.''</p>
        <p>With that demand, most of the two million square feet of speculative space built in the last two years has been leased. The corridor's vacancy rate fell to 9.8 percent in the second quarter of this year from 10.4 percent a year earlier, according to Cushman &amp; Wakefield. Average asking prices for prime space remained stable at $28.87 per square foot a year.</p>
        <p>The demand is coming mostly from current tenants who are expanding, said Peter W. Hamburger, a senior director at Cushman &amp; Wakefield. ''If businesses continue to grow at a modest rate of 3 percent a year,'' he added, ''that will generate a demand for 360,000 square feet a year.''</p>
        <p>As a result, he said, the market should be able to absorb the next crop of speculative buildings.</p>
        <p>And the space RCN and Merrill Lynch will vacate for their new buildings as well, said Mr. Morford of the Garibaldi Group. RCN is said to occupy 100,000 square feet in Carnegie Center</p>
        <p>Merrill Lynch is building the Hopewell buildings ''to meet our immediate growth needs,'' said Joseph M. Cohen, a company spokesman. He said 6,000 employees who provided support services for the company's brokerage operations would occupy the buildings.</p>
        <p>They will relocate from leased space mostly in central New Jersey, including 250,000 square feet in the Princeton market, Mr. Cohen said, adding that those leases expired in 18 to 36 months. A 1.2 million-square-foot building the company owns in Plainsboro will be retained, he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schotz, of Reckson, said that University Square, which will rise at the corner of Route 1 and Alexander Road, represented ''an opportunity to get in on a fast-growing market.'' To satisfy what his company believes is tenants' unmet need for large blocks of space, he said, the building's five floors, each with 60,000 square feet, will be marketed to users needing at least half that amount of space.</p>
        <p>Though the building could accommodate tenants wanting 5,000 square feet, ''that is not our intent right now,'' Mr. Schotz said. Initially, rents will be $32.75 a square foot, with tenants paying for their own electricity, and will rise during the course of construction to $34.75. Completion is set for the fall of 2001.</p>
        <p>Boston Properties expects to start construction by year-end on a 140,000-square foot, five-story speculative building at its 450-acre Carnegie Center office campus. Half of the park's eventual four million square feet is built and leased.</p>
        <p>Since the company bought the park in 1998, it has built four more buildings, on speculation or for specific tenants. All 600,000 square feet in those buildings also are leased, keeping the park at full occupancy, said Micky Landis, a vice president and regional manager at Boston Properties.</p>
        <p>''We put up one building a year,'' Mr. Landis said, ''But right now. there is more construction in the market and frankly that should concern any developer who has memories of the mid-80's.'' The question, he said, is ''how many other developers will try to take advantage of the market.''</p>
        <p>STILL, he said, Carnegie Center has the advantage of offering a campus environment. Another factor is that the park's current tenants continue to grow, he said, adding that such tenants filled the previous buildings ''and are likely to fill the new one'' as well.</p>
        <p>Rents at the park are $31 to $36 a square foot, he said, adding that those at the planned building, while not yet set, would be in that range.</p>
        <p>In Plainsboro, the Patrinely Group, with offices in Houston and Princeton, last week started construction on a 70,850-square-foot speculative building. It will be the second such building for the company, which in 1998 agreed to buy, in pieces, 100 acres from Princeton University to build the Princeton Corporate Campus, an office campus of up to 1.2 million square feet on both sides of Route 1 in Plainsboro. It is part of the Princeton Forrestal Center.</p>
        <p>The first building, with 154,000 square feet, is leased, said Walter F. Thomas, a senior managing director for new development at the Patrinely Group. ''The depth and breath of the demand is greater than we anticipated,'' he said, adding that lease proposals were out for all but 24,000 square feet in the second building. Rents in that building will be $31.50 a square foot, with tenants paying for their own electricity.</p>
        <p>The first two buildings will complete development on the southbound side of Route 1 and Mr. Thomas said his company ''is pushing forward with dispatch for approvals'' for the one million square feet it could build on the north side of the highway.</p>
        <p>Five buildings of 160,000 square feet each are envisioned there.. But Mr. Thomas said the plan was flexible, allowing his company to build larger or smaller buildings to meet market demand.</p>
