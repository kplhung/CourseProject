        <p>A Queens teenager has been charged with robbing a cabdriver in what is believed to be the first arrest making use of digital cameras that were placed in thousands of livery cabs after a series of killings this year, police officials said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The suspect, Jeff Ratanaburi, 17, of Woodside, was arrested on Thursday after he and another man were identified as suspects in a Sept. 23 robbery, the officials said. He was charged with second-degree robbery and accused of taking the driver's cellular telephone.</p>
        <p>The police said Mr. Ratanaburi was in the back seat during the robbery, which occurred in Elmhurst, Queens, while the other man was in the front seat. Although Mr. Ratanaburi was identifiable on camera, the other man's face could not be seen, the officials added. The police are looking for the second man.</p>
        <p>The arrest was first reported Friday in The Daily News Express, an afternoon newspaper owned by The Daily News.</p>
        <p>In May, after 10 livery-cab drivers had been killed in five months, the city's Taxi and Limousine Commission required all livery-cab drivers  to install digital cameras or safety partitions. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani created a $5 million program to reimburse livery drivers $325 each for partitions or cameras.</p>
        <p>More than 3,700 digital cameras and 9,900 bulletproof partitions have been installed in livery cabs since the order was issued, city officials said. No livery-cab drivers have been killed since then, officials said.</p>
        <p>The police said Mr. Ratanaburi and the other man were picked up by Balkar Singh, 42, about 5:30 p.m., at  104th Street and National Street in Corona. They told Mr. Singh to drive them to 92nd Avenue and 51st Street, officials said. The officials said Mr. Ratanaburi reached across the back seat of the cab, which did not have a partition, and tried to take money from Mr. Singh. Mr. Singh told investigators that the two men took his cellular telephone and left the cab.</p>
        <p>Mr. Singh then drove to the Taxi and Limousine Commission office in Woodside, where technicians downloaded frames from the camera. Detectives identified Mr. Ratanaburi after they showed his picture to security guards at Newton High School, the police said.</p>
