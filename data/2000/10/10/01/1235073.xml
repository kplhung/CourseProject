        <p>WESTCHESTER COUNTY has three dozen historical societies -- not bad for a place where the residents seem relentlessly transient, hurried and high-tech.</p>
        <p>While it may seem out of character at first, the county's highly evolved historical consciousness has its own logic. Whether run by volunteers or a professional staff, the societies -- repositories for documents, photographs, maps and artifacts -- are in many cases the only links to the people and events that have shaped history. The societies can give residents without any real roots a sense of connectedness, and an hour spent perusing a collection and chatting with its caretakers can lower the blood pressure as surely as the Cross Westchester Expressway can raise it.</p>
        <p>Here is a look at three societies:</p>
        <p>Rye Historical Society And Square House Museum</p>
        <p>The Rye Historical Society is one of the few historical organizations in Westchester headed by a small professional staff, and it is a bustling place. The society operates a museum that attracts 11,000 visitors a year. It sponsors lectures, organizes exhibitions (currently ''The Language of Hats: From Poke Bonnets to Pillboxes, From Top Hats to Homburgs'') and oversees a collection that includes 4,000 photographs, ceramics, tools, textiles, store signs and furniture. There's even a summer camp, complete with cornhusk dolls and Colonial cooking.</p>
        <p>The Square House Museum, at 1 Purchase Street, is the society's base. Restoration work is being done on the 1670 Knapp House at the corner of Milton Road and Rye Beach Avenue, the oldest remaining dwelling in Westchester. The plan is to move the society's archive, now in a glorified walk-in closet, to the Knapp House, while keeping administrative offices in Square House.</p>
        <p>Shadowy, musty and seemingly caught in a time warp with its wide plank floors, giant fireplace and period furniture, the Square House, built in 1730, functioned as a tavern and inn from 1760 to 1830. The tavern was an important outpost on the old King's Highway, running from New York to Boston (now the Boston Post Road). ''The whole story of early America occurs along this road,'' Phyllis Dillon, the society's director, said. George Washington and John Adams stayed at the tavern, and the Marquis de Lafayette was entertained in the upstairs ballroom on his return to the United States long after the Revolutionary War. Even then, Rye was known for its refinements; in his diary, Washington wrote about the tavern's elegance and hospitality.</p>
        <p>A textile conservator by trade, Ms. Dillon, who lives in Hastings-on-Hudson, has worked at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Museum of the Chinese in the Americas. But she is now immersed in the history of Rye and the region.</p>
        <p>One of the oldest communities in Westchester, Rye was settled in the 1670's by Puritans from Connecticut. For the next 100 years, farmers grew corn and rye, raised sheep and cows and produced cheese.</p>
        <p>But in the 1800's, farming gradually lost its appeal. The Erie Canal opened, giving farmers in western New York a competitive edge, and then the rail lines came through, enabling wealthy New Yorkers to build grand weekend houses on Long Island Sound and to begin daily commuting to Manhattan. Soon the sons of farmers hung up their hoes to take factory jobs in Port Chester and Yonkers.</p>
        <p>A preservation movement emerged around the time of the centennial of the Revolution, and a Presbyterian minister, Charles Baird, published a history of Rye in 1871. Then, in 1904, two well-to-do families, the Parsons and the Whittemores, bought the Square House property and donated it to the newly formed village of Rye. ''It's very interesting that these summer people were aware of the early history and beauty of the area and wanted to preserve it,'' Ms. Dillon said. The Square House served as the municipal building until 1964, when the government leased it to the newly formed historical society, creating the museum.</p>
        <p>Rye Historical Society and Square House Museum, 1 Purchase Street, Rye. (914) 967-7588.</p>
        <p>Pound Ridge Historical Society</p>
        <p>The head of the Pound Ridge Historical Society half boasts, half complains about her many duties, like recruiting docents, organizing the annual antiques benefit and cleaning the bathroom at the society's one-room museum. ''I'm sort of a jack-of-all-trades,'' Joyce Ann Butterfield, the president, said. Indeed, the historical society is as different from Rye's as the affluent municipalities are from each other.</p>
        <p>In Pound Ridge, in leafy northeastern Westchester, weekenders compete with commuters for expensive houses, which still have wells and septic tanks. With 4,550 residents, the town of Pound Ridge is exactly a third the size of Rye. But with 20 square miles, it has five times the area. In short, Pound Ridge looks and feels like the country.</p>
        <p>With only 300 to 500 visitors a year, the society decided not to replace the one paid staff member who left last year. It now relies on volunteers and the occasional paid consultant. Instead of rotating exhibitions, the museum has erected a display, ''The People of Pound Ridge: The Big Story,'' which is to stay up at least through 2002.</p>
        <p>This year, the society jumped into the 21st century when it acquired a computer, a fax machine and a copier. A trustee, Richard Major, a former town historian who helped found the society in 1970, is now busy indexing the archives.</p>
        <p>What it lacks in ambition, the historical society makes up in charm. Its museum and headquarters occupy a former Presbyterian meeting house at the junction of Routes 124 and 137. Past and present exhibitions reflect Pound Ridge's determination to hold suburbia at bay. ''We did a whole exhibit on the trains that never came,'' said Ms. Butterfield, who had volunteered for the Queens Historical Society before moving to Pound Ridge 17 years ago.</p>
        <p>The permanent exhibition covers the development of churches, the Revolutionary War, the dozens of local landmarks, the building of schoolhouses in the early 1800's and residents' professions in the 19th century -- farming, milling, masonry, shopkeeping, basket weaving and shoemaking. The population actually fell from an early peak of 1,486 in 1850 to 515 in 1920.</p>
        <p>The historical society's archives are crammed in a chilly basement room of the former Presbyterian Church next door. (Today the town-owned church building serves as a community center.) In addition to boxes of photographs and papers are antique baskets, tools, costumes and dolls, and Ms. Butterfield is always looking for more. ''I tell people, 'You don't want to give up your picture of the general store? Fine,' '' she said. '' 'Let me make a laser-print copy.' Then, hopefully, sometime down the line we'll get the original.''</p>
        <p>Residents of Pound Ridge -- among them the actors Richard Gere and Tim Robbins -- value privacy as much as history. And the society, whose members include the actress Zoe Caldwell, has had to be mindful of that. ''We had considered doing an exhibit of famous people in Pound Ridge,'' Ms. Butterfield said, ''but we realized it would get very complicated. We couldn't have picked anybody who was alive.''</p>
        <p>Pound Ridge Historical Society, Westchester Avenue, Pound Ridge. (914) 746-4333.</p>
        <p>Hastings Historical Society</p>
        <p>The building that houses the Hastings Historical Society, known as the Observatory Cottage, is an architectural jewel, sitting amid the emerald lawns of Draper Park. Three years ago, the all-volunteer society completed an ambitious renovation and expansion of the historic cottage. Current and former residents contributed $350,000 toward the society's new home.</p>
        <p>But for all the humidity controls and up-to-the-minute archival storage techniques, the historical society has felt a void since June when its archivist and the village historian, Mary Allison, died. ''She was a mainstay of this archive,'' said Muriel Olsson, a volunteer.</p>
        <p>In the mid-1990's, the village government decided to give the historical society a long-term lease on the cottage, which contains portions of an observatory built by the astronomer Henry Draper in the 1860's on his father's Hastings estate. The observatory was one of the first centers of the ''New Astronomy,'' based on photography rather than direct observation, and it attracted a parade of visitors, from Thomas Edison to Emperor Don Pedro II of Brazil.</p>
        <p>Both the casual student and serious scholar can use the archive. Dozens of folders are cataloged by subject, including ''actors,'' ''banking,'''' ''cemeteries,'' the ''Hastings Garden Club,'' and ''restaurants.'' The archive also contains Draper's glass-plate negatives of the moon, stars and comets.</p>
        <p>There is plenty of room for exhibitions in the society's new headquarters at 407 Broadway, off Washington Avenue. A recent one, on female business owners in Hastings in the 1970's, was especially popular. But half of the society's membership consists of former residents who have scattered across the country. They receive The Hastings Historian, a quarterly publication, which delves into various aspects of village history. ''The Historian is really their link to Hastings,'' said David Willis McCullough, an editor and past president of the society.</p>
        <p>Hastings' history was shaped by its Hudson River location. After the Revolution, industry flourishedt. From the 1830's to the 1970's, descendants of the early Dutch settlers and immigrants from many countries quarried marble, refined sugar, fashioned paving stones, made wire and even produced mustard gas during World War I.</p>
        <p>By the 1930's, Hastings was fast becoming a bedroom community, the result of its proximity to Manhattan, its rail line along the river and a residential building boom, which had begun at the turn of the century. ''There were early real estate ads beginning around 1910 describing the fresh breezes and healthy climate,'' Mr. McCullough said.</p>
        <p>Over the years, the two-square-mile village has attracted a number of artists, including the Hudson River School painter Jasper F. Cropsey, the actress Billie Burke (the good witch in ''The Wizard of Oz'') and the sculptor Jacques Lipchitz. With 8,000 residents, Hastings still attracts people with an artistic bent.</p>
        <p>In fact, a trustee adept in the ways of the digital world, Barbara McManus, recently scored a coup for the society's collection when she ventured onto eBay, the Internet auction site. Ms. McManus bid $200 on an antique instrument that measures humidity, called a hygrometer. It was designed by Daniel Draper, the brother of Henry and one of the country's first weathermen, who in 1868 established the New York meteorological observatory in Central Park. Today the statuesque instrument is proudly displayed in the society's archive.</p>
