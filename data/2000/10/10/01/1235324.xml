        <p>Rick White, the Mets right-hander who has struggled lately, studied videotape on Wednesday, searching for flaws. He and the pitching coach, Dave Wallace, went down the checklist of typical mechanical problems but could find nothing wrong.</p>
        <p>Then they noticed something wrong with White's feet on the pitcher's rubber. He corrected the problem, threw for a few minutes before Wednesday's game and grew confident again.</p>
        <p>''There's nothing to worry about,'' said White, who was 0-3 with a 9.00 earned run average in 10 games since Aug. 26 before pitching a perfect inning yesterday. ''I think we ironed everything out, which is good to know. I'd rather find it out now with a few games to go in the season than figure it out in the playoffs -- especially since I've never pitched in October.''</p>
        <p>If White's pitching reflects his renewed comfort, the Mets will be grateful. In his first 11 games after being acquired July 28 from Tampa Bay, he had a 1.04 E.R.A. and was a valuable member of the bullpen.</p>
