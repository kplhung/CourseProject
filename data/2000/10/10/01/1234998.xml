      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Montclair State University is -- as the name says -- a state school, with 13,500 students, most of them middle-class commuters. But between 8 and 9 p.m. tonight, it will be ''a prestigious school on the other side of the tracks, populated by kids who act as if they're on top of the world that they own anyhow.''</p>
        <p>Those are the words of CBS, describing ''Montclair University,'' the setting for a series called ''That's Life,'' which after today moves to Saturday nights. The premise, as they say on the West Coast, where the show is filmed, is that Lydia Savage (played by Heather Paige Kent), shucks her engagement and shocks her blue-collar family by enrolling at Montclair University, where she shows the swells that there's more to education than book learning. The drama was written by Diane Ruggiero, originally of Old Bridge, who attended Montclair State in the 90's.</p>

        <p>Greg Waters, vice president for institutional development at Montclair State, says the administration is delighted. As for the upper-crust students on the show, he said: ''We must have some kids of that type. I'm sure we do have kids aspiring to it.''</p>
