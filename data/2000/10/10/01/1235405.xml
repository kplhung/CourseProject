        <p>MARSHALL-Robert W., Sr. Of Summit, New Jersey, whose career with Bell Laboratories spanned more than four decades, died on Friday, September 29, 2000 at Overlook Hospital after a long illness. He was 87 years old. Marshall, who retired from Bell Laboratories in 1977, was a patentee of various radar and underwater tracking systems and devoted much of his career as an electrical engineer in research, development, and quality assurance of integrated circuitry. He worked in the Whippany, Murray Hill, and Holmdel labs. Marshall was detailed to the U.S. Department of Defense during World War II. During the post-Korean War years Marshall served with the U.S. Army Air Corps' Intelligence forces in the North Atlantic. A contributor to several professional journals, Marshall was a member of IEEE and the American Society of Engineering Education. He was also a very active member of Central Presbyterian Church in Summit, NJ serving for many years as Superintendent of the Church School and as an Elder. He was also a member of the Board of Development at Princeton Theological Seminary. During his retirement Marshall was much involved in the Old Guard of Summit, serving as Program Chairman for several years. A native of Minneapolis, Marshall graduated from the University of Minnesota School of Engineering in 1934. He received an M.S. with honors from Columbia University in 1936 and was inducted into the Sigma Xi Honor Society. He was married to the late Alexandra Babcock Marshall for 54 years.
