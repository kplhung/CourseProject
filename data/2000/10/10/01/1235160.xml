        <p>THERE are two kinds of car people,'' Jan Voboril told me as we climbed into his 1916 Lancia convertible. ''One likes to polish them, one likes to drive them. I think it's much more fun to drive. Wouldn't you rather cook than do the dishes?''</p>
        <p>Sure. But even the dishes sounded more appealing than the prospect of driving over the George Washington Bridge in an 84-year-old car with no roof and no doors on one of the windiest days of the year. I would get my fill of the polishers soon enough, once we reached the Louis Vuitton Classic at Rockefeller Center.

        <p>THERE are two kinds of car people,'' Jan Voboril told me as we climbed into his 1916 Lancia convertible. ''One likes to polish them, one likes to drive them. I think it's much more fun to drive. Wouldn't you rather cook than do the dishes?''</p>
        <p>Sure. But even the dishes sounded more appealing than the prospect of driving over the George Washington Bridge in an 84-year-old car with no roof and no doors on one of the windiest days of the year. I would get my fill of the polishers soon enough, once we reached the Louis Vuitton Classic at Rockefeller Center. The event, which was held last weekend and has been an annual occurrence since 1995, is an outdoor exhibition of 50 of the world's rarest classic cars -- the lush, romantic kind Jay Gatsby would have owned.</p>
        <p>The Vuitton Classic judges cars on their rarity, impeccable provenance (whether they are original or reconstituted), history (whether a celebrity or famous race car driver owned it or drove it) and engineering excellence. There are more car enthusiasts today then ever, said the show's curator, Murray Livingstone Smith, who races vintage cars around the world. And with the present economy, more people are buying, everyone from ''the chairman of Wal-Mart to guys at Microsoft,'' he added. The cars in this year's show were worth about $40 million.</p>
        <p>Though the usual venues for vintage cars this valuable are private estates or country clubs, the idea for showing them in the streets was Mr. Smith's. His hunch that the general public might take a liking to the show was right. According to the New York Police Department, last year's event drew two million spectators.</p>
        <p>This year, Mr. Smith had another hunch. For the first time, he instituted the New York Style Awards at the classic. ''Generally speaking, cars are only judged by car people,'' Mr. Smith said. ''I wanted to take people with aesthetic sensibilities and see how the cars appeal to them. A great design has great value. A Balenciaga dress that was good then is good now.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Smith assembled a jury of eight style mavens that included Eileen and Jerry Ford, founders of the Ford Modeling Agency; Martha Nelson, managing editor, In Style magazine; Dana Cowin, editor in chief, Food &amp; Wine magazine; Brenda Cooper, host of E! channel's ''Fashion Emergency''; Laurin Sydney, anchor, CNN's ''Showbiz Today''; Amy Fine Collins, special correspondent, Vanity Fair; and Tiffany Dubin, vintage fashion expert.</p>
        <p>The idea of linking cars and fashion is nothing new. In the early 1920's, the French paired the latest couturier fashions with the most elegant automobile designs, calling it a concours d'elegance, a competition of elegance. Cars would be judged with models posing beside them, and wealthy individuals would then order their own custom-built cars and custom-made gowns.</p>
        <p>Those events virtually disappeared during World War II, but were reinstated in the economic boom of the 1950's, a trend that was celebrated in a 1997 exhibition at the Fashion Institute of Technology called ''Fashion: Automobile Fabrics of the 1950's.'' That was the decade when women who bought the 1952 Crown Victoria Ford were given a coat to match their new car, and Dodge buyers could order the 1955 La Femme in pink and white, with a matching shoulder bag, lipstick case and compact.</p>
        <p>I thought about coordinated cars and outfits as I joined Mr. Voboril for the last leg of his journey in his 1916 Lancia; he had started in Los Angeles less than a week earlier. One of the best-known classic car restorers in this country, he bought the car for $2,300 in 1973, and has put 130,000 miles on it.</p>
        <p>I met him in New Jersey, and though the temperature was in the 80's, he gave me a heavy blue baseball jacket to ward off the wind on the bridge. I had tied a Hermes scarf around my head, imagining how glamorous I would look, but he insisted I anchor it with a red baseball cap. I ended up looking like a refugee from the right side of the tracks in Anatevka who had somehow wandered into a seventh-inning stretch.</p>
        <p>Mr. Voboril says he estimates the car to be worth ''about $100,000.'' For that kind of money you'd think you'd get a key, but he had to get down on all fours to start it somewhere underneath. As he tried, he drew quite a crowd in the parking lot of a Marriott hotel near the bridge. One man said confidently, ''It will never start.'' Mr. Voboril responded, ''It's not getting it going that's the problem, it's stopping it.'' Oh, swell.</p>
        <p>Once on the road, Mr. Voboril was intent on getting Lancia up to her full speed of 85 miles an hour, and, I'm sorry to say, nearly succeeded. I clutched the outside of the car for ballast while sliding off my shoes so I could grip the floor with my bare feet. The car had no well for legs; the floor was flat out in front of us.</p>
        <p>Mr. Voboril, whose complexion resembles a rock formation, clearly relishes being at one with the elements. He was also so completely bonded with the car, driving it with both feet and a stick shift, that he pulled me out of my fear. To drive in a car like this is to travel through time, to see what it must have been like nearly a century ago for the first people to try a swift motor car. The thrill of adventure seemed to dance all around us as we crossed the bridge, the sun glittering hard on the water, the open sky beckoning.</p>
        <p>As he pulled into Rockefeller Center, the crowd applauded and toasted his journey's end with Champagne.</p>
        <p>To try out city driving (utterly tame but for the finger-pointing), I took a quick spin through Central Park with Mr. Smith, who borrowed a Mercedes 300 SL convertible, circa 1963, for the occasion. ''These cars are so idiosyncratic,'' he said. ''They have their own characters.''</p>
        <p>Our Mercedes must have been menopausal; the heat seemed to be on high, and Mr. Smith was understandably reluctant to fool with it. Within minutes, we were soaked with sweat.</p>
        <p>By the time the style jury arrived, though, he had cleaned up. ''Don't worry about the technical, choose what you like,'' Mr. Smith encouraged them. They were selecting four categories: Best Car for a Night on the Town; Timeless Style Regardless of Age; the Car I Would Most Like to Own; the Most Surprising Car.</p>
        <p>What would the winners get? ''Prestige,'' Mr. Smith said. ''And the car jumps in value.''</p>
        <p>Out the jurors went, clipboards in hand. Mrs. Ford fell immediately in love. ''I want that Rolls convertible sedan,'' she said, pointing to a breathtaking dark green 1910 Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost Tourer with three banks of seats. Ms. Sydney, however, was more interested in Ms. Dubin's boots, an exquisite camel leather with maroon diamond patterns that she had bought at Colette in Paris. ''I'd like to drive those boots out of here more than any car,'' Ms. Sydney said hungrily.</p>
        <p>Mostly everyone exclaimed over the 1940 Duesenberg, the last one ever built. Its former owner, the German painter Rudolph Bauer, who was sent to a concentration camp, reclaimed ownership after the war; the car was bought by a restorer and still has its original tires.</p>
        <p>The car's interior was purple leather. ''It's so chic,'' Ms. Cowin said. ''That purple interior is so this season.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Cooper agreed. ''I would have expected deep burgundy,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Everyone marveled at the car that Mr. Smith called the Copper Kettle, a 1921 copper Rolls-Royce that its owner says takes 50 hours to clean. Its battery was housed in a polished wooden box.</p>
        <p>The menopausal Mercedes fared well, too. ''It has that early Bondian quality,'' Ms. Nelson said.</p>
        <p>Transcending even Bond was the 1925 Rolls-Royce Phantom 1 Torpedo, which was on exhibition but not in competition. It's former owner, the Maharajah of Bekanur, used it to hunt tiger on his 25,000-square-mile estate. The car was equipped with special ammunition cases and twin express rifles.</p>
        <p>Ms. Collins arrived only as the rest of the judges were finishing, but she quickly discovered that her purple shoes were a perfect match for the Duesenberg interior. She was the envy of them all.</p>
        <p>I checked in on the Lancia. In his zeal to champion the drivers versus the polishers, Mr. Voboril had not only skipped the polish; he hadn't even washed the car or removed the dead bugs from the front grate. The style judges just shook their heads. I found Mr. Voboril.</p>
        <p>''Why didn't you at least wash it?'' I demanded. One ride and the car was mine. He shrugged. ''It was going to rain,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Needless to say, the Lancia didn't win. The 1940 Duesenberg won for a Night on the Town; the dark green 1910 Rolls-Royce won for Timeless Style Regardless of Age; Most Surprising was the silver 1936/37 Dubonnet Hispano; and Most Like to Own was the 1953 Ferrari 342 America.</p>
        <p>Poor Lancia. I went back outside to take one last look, but my view was blocked by an elderly couple standing in front of it. They were transported.</p>
        <p>''Isn't that beautiful?'' the woman gushed, positioning her camera.</p>
        <p>''Fantastic,'' her husband exclaimed. ''Simply fantastic.''</p>
        <p>He smiled at me and I nodded. Justice at last.</p>
