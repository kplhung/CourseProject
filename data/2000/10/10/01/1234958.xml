        <p>THIS year is shaping up as a record for the cruise industry, officials say, with the number of passengers possibly exceeding 7 million, well above the record 5.8 million in 1998.

        <p>THIS year is shaping up as a record for the cruise industry, officials say, with the number of passengers possibly exceeding 7 million, well above the record 5.8 million in 1998. A major reason, according to the cruise industry trade group, the Cruise Lines International Association, is the many low fares this year, which some industry observers have described as ''the best prices since 1980.''</p>
        <p>Whether or not they have been that low, many cruises have been priced at less than $100 a night a person, something that has been rare in the 90's. But low fares are likely to continue this fall and next year.</p>
        <p>The AAA, the biggest leisure travel agency in the United States, recently declared that cruising was the best value in travel and that discounts ''should be a staple of the cruise industry for the foreseeable future.''</p>
        <p>As examples, the AAA cited certain seven-day cruises to the eastern Caribbean through December on Holland America for $599, and similar discounted fares by Carnival Cruise Lines to both the eastern and western Caribbean this month. Costa Cruises, in which the Carnival Corporation has a controlling interest, is offering seven-night Caribbean trips from Fort Lauderdale beginning next month from $699 a person.</p>
        <p>The reason for such bargains is hardly a mystery: almost 80 new ships joined the North American fleet during the 1990's, and 52 more are scheduled by 2005. Altogether, the new ships will add about 77,000 berths to the current 170,000.</p>
        <p>But if Premier Cruise Lines calls it quits -- as seems likely following its abrupt shutdown last month, after its ships were repossessed by creditors -- it will reduce capacity growth next year to 10 percent from 12 percent, according to James Winchester, an analyst with Lazard Freres.</p>
        <p>For now, though, the cruise industry is in ''an overbuilt situation,'' said Robert C. Biege, the owner of the Cruise Center, an agency in Elm Grove, Wis. ''The cruise lines' philosophy is, 'Let's get them on board cheap, but get them -- and be sure they bring their credit card so we can charge for everything.' ''</p>
        <p>Michael Driscoll, editor in chief of Cruise Week, agrees that cruise ships -- despite their claims of being all-inclusive -- are trying to offset the low fares by charging for everything from soft drinks to hamburgers to alcoholic beverages. But he noted that Royal Caribbean beat a hasty retreat in June, when after widespread complaints, it rescinded its $8 charge for 90 minutes on the Voyager of the Seas' rock climbing wall, and its $6-an-hour fee for ice skating.</p>
        <p>Like other analysts, Mr. Driscoll thinks deep discounts will last throughout 2001. He noted, for example, that published fares for some Alaskan cruises next year were already 10 percent lower than this year's.</p>
        <p>But the region with the most bargains and the deepest discounts is still the Caribbean, which this year is expected to attract 45.9 percent of all cruise passengers, according to the Cruise Lines International Association. All but a handful of its 25 members have ships in the Caribbean, and the competition is likely to heat up now that the Disney Magic has begun weekly cruises to the eastern Caribbean and that Princess plans to keep its 2,600-passenger Grand Princess in the Caribbean all next year after its repositioning from Europe this month.</p>
        <p>That prospect should sit well with passengers. ''While a lot of our customers go to Alaska,'' said Alisanne Toomey, of Cruise Shoppe Travel in Albuquerque, N.M., ''we also sell a lot of Caribbean cruises because people like the low fares.''</p>
        <p>Another thing that should sit well with passengers, if not necessarily those looking for low fares, will be the scheduled arrival in 2002 of Canyon Ranch's Quest I and Quest II. They will be the flagships of Canyon Ranch at Sea, a new division of the health resorts in Tucson and Lenox, Mass. Each ship will carry up to 320 guests and, according to a Canyon Ranch spokeswoman, ''will be a health resort from stem to stern.'' They will have worldwide itineraries.</p>
        <p>Although many discounts are announced in ads and over the Internet, many are also passed along in less obvious ways, particularly for luxury cruises, for which fares can easily exceed $700 a day a person. These include offering discount air fares to and from the ship's departure city, or cutting fares for those who pay well in advance.</p>
        <p>For example, the rate for a cabin on the veranda deck of Radisson's Paul Gauguin during its weekly round trips from Tahiti in 2001 is $5,495 a person -- but $300 less for those booking 120 days prior to sailing.</p>
        <p>Passengers on Windstar's seven-day Costa Rica trips next January and February have a choice of three bonuses: $299 round-trip air fare from Miami, two free hotel nights in Costa Rica plus $399 round-trip air fare from Miami, or 5 percent off the cruise fare, which starts at $2,482.</p>
        <p>Those who pay a deposit at least six months ahead for a cruise of six or more nights on any of the Delta Queen Steamboat Company's ships next year, can choose free round-trip air fare, a $250 a person travel allowance, or two free nights in a hotel in any of a dozen port cities, including Chicago, St. Louis and New Orleans.</p>
        <p>Facing greater competition in popular Panama Canal trips, Crystal Cruises is cutting fares as much as 50 percent on five such cruises between mid-November and Dec. 20, and eight more next year.</p>
        <p>While it may seem that cruise lines will soon run out of new destinations, many of them avoid offering the same itinerary over and over by adding a twist or two. Silversea Cruises, for example, will return this fall to Australia for the fourth time, but for the first time it will sail around the western coast, visiting Fremantle, Adelaide and Broome.</p>
        <p>Windstar is adding New Zealand to its Pacific cruises starting late next year, with its Wind Song scheduled for 10 trips of 10 days each, visiting ports on both the North and South Islands.</p>
        <p>Many other ships have new or additional itineraries in Asia or the South Pacific, a region where the number of cruises this year will rise to 237, compared with 192 in 1999.</p>
        <p>The number of South American cruises has doubled in five years, to 72. Cunard Line's refurbished Caronia (formerly the Vistafjord) will sail the west coast of South America from January through March, then make two voyages between Fort Lauderdale and the Amazon River.</p>
        <p>The Celebrity Mercury, in its first full season in South America, has a 15-day cruise leaving Buenos Aires on Feb. 22. It will spend two days in Rio de Janeiro during Carnaval, with passengers getting seats in the Sambadrome for the main Carnival parade. Crystal has five South American cruises from January through March. And Norwegian Cruise Line will increase its berths in South America by almost 300 beginning this December, when it replaces the Norwegian Majesty with the 1,748-passenger Norwegian Dream.</p>
        <p>A new destination is Cuba. Beginning Nov. 18, the Cuba Cruise Corporation, a division of Blyth &amp; Company Travel of Toronto, will begin twice-weekly cruises there from Nassau, the Bahamas. They will be aboard a 550-passenger ship, the Funchal, then after three weeks, the 350-passenger Arion, both of which will be renamed La Habana for these voyages. Except for the inaugural cruise, which departs on a Saturday, the three-night cruises will depart Thursday, and the four-night cruises on Sunday.</p>
        <p>Longer cruises are the most profitable for cruise lines, because they attract bigger spenders to begin with and offer more exotic and more expensive land tours. But changing lifestyles, which often make it difficult to fit a weeklong or 10-day cruise into work schedules, have resulted in a bumper crop of shorter cruises. Cruise Lines International figures show that there were 1,468 three-to-five-day cruises in 1999 and that there will be nearly 2,000 this year.</p>
        <p>For those who haven't noticed, informal dress pretty much reigns aboard ship. Now Norwegian Cruise Line is making it more or less official. Instead of the usual two ''formal nights'' during a seven-day cruise, this summer, Norwegian announced ''resort casual'' for the whole cruise with one optional formal night aboard the Norwegian Sky, and it plans to expand the casual code to its entire fleet.</p>
        <p>Also, in what Norwegian describes as a way to simplify things for passengers, tips will automatically be added to on-board accounts.</p>
        <p>Aside from bargain fares, the most notable change in cruising this year is the virtual omission of what was all the rage this time last year: millennium cruises, those overpriced voyages designed to see who and what ships would be first to welcome last year's faux millennium and bid goodbye to the old. This New Year's Eve, there will be the usual number of year-end voyages, but there has been little talk of welcoming the actual millennium.</p>
        <p>In fact, as the ball is descending in Times Square on Dec. 31, Celebrity Cruises' new 1,950-passenger Millennium is scheduled to be midway between Fort Lauderdale and Key West, thousands of miles from the international date line and those islands and atolls that many considered the place to be last New Year's Eve. As of this writing, there are still berths available.</p>
