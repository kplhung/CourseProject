        <p>DINNER with entertainment often used to mean dinner theater, but the days of dinner theater in Connecticut seem to have faded into yesteryear, along with veal cordon bleu and baked Alaska.</p>
        <p>That doesn't mean you have to dine in silence or to a repertory of golden oldies played off-key on an out-of-tune piano.

        <p>DINNER with entertainment often used to mean dinner theater, but the days of dinner theater in Connecticut seem to have faded into yesteryear, along with veal cordon bleu and baked Alaska.</p>
        <p>That doesn't mean you have to dine in silence or to a repertory of golden oldies played off-key on an out-of-tune piano. These days you can find some very hot live music and entertainment all around the state in both fancy and funky settings that also feature interesting food. Here are a few of some of the livelier spots, listed alphabetically by town.</p>
        <p>Bridgeport</p>
        <p>Downtown Cabaret Theater may be the last outpost of what used to be known as dinner theater -- with a twist. Maybe it has survived because of its novel approach to dining, called B.Y.O.D., Bring Your Own Dinner (and drinks). It works surprisingly well. Some patrons arrive with pizza and beer, others favor more elaborate menus and a few have gone so far as to bring their own tablecloths, china and silverware.</p>
        <p>The drill, we found, was to arrive early (in order to get the choice seats, facing the stage, at our reserved table, which is shared with others) and unwrap and munch on our home-made sandwiches, pasta salad and cookies. While we opted for the casual, we noticed diners at another table with a large casserole, salad bowl, foil-wrapped warm rolls, meringue pie and 1920's-style cocktail shaker of martinis. Most tables seat 8, though there are a few for 2 and one for 10 diners. Soft drinks, tea and coffee are the only drinks sold on the premises.</p>
        <p>''Cabaret'' is a misnomer for the show that goes on. This is real, fully staged, professional musical theater.  ''Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat,'' with music by Andrew Lloyd Webber and lyrics by Tim Rice, will run from Nov. 3 to Feb. 18 followed by Willie Russell's ''Blood Brothers,'' from March 2 to May 20. ''Back to Bacharach and David,'' with the songs of Burt Bacharach and Hal David, is scheduled from June 1 to Aug. 5 next year, with a fourth production to be announced later. Admission is $28 to $32.50, $20 for students and older people; season subscriptions for four shows cost $85 to $120. Performances are Friday at 8 p.m., Saturday at 5:30 p.m.. and 8:30 p.m., and Sunday at 5:30 p.m.</p>
        <p>Essex</p>
        <p>The Griswold Inn offers musical entertainment, with no cover charge, every night of the week year-round. Mondays, it's the Sea Chanteys with -- fittingly enough in Essex -- songs of the sea. On Tuesdays, the sound is country, played by the Finest Kind of Bluegrass, while Wednesday the Hot Cats Jazz Band blasts forth. Thursday is also jazz night with the Freight Train Four and their Dixieland jazz. On Friday it's the Griswold Inn Banjo Band, Saturday offers Bob Price on banjo and Ray Churchill at piano, and Sunday the show is Johnny and the East Coast Rockers.</p>
        <p>Weeknights and Sundays the music is from 8 to 11 p.m.; on Fridays and Saturdays the hours are 9 p.m. to 12:30 a.m. The groups perform in the bar, but can be heard in two of the inn's four dining rooms. So if you want to listen as you dine, request seating in either the large Covered Bridge Room or the cozy Library. The sturdy, reliable food includes  fried oysters and clams and slow-roasted aged prime ribs of beef as well as rosemary-grilled lamb loin, Caribbean spiced pork chop and pesto-roasted scrod and other seafood. Entrees run from $17.50 to $24.95. Reservations are essential.</p>
        <p>Georgetown</p>
        <p>Both the music and the menu at the Georgetown Saloon are well suited to the suburban cowboys who like to hang out there on weekends. The overiding look of the place is western, what with the hardwood benches and knotty-pine walls hung with horns, tools and rifles.</p>
        <p>The casual Mexican/American menu offers such dishes as beer-batter chicken, steaks, BBQ beef brisket, fajitas, enchiladas and quesadillas. On Friday evenings, from 9:30 p.m. to 1:30 a.m. whirlers and twirlers can dance to blues or rock and roll groups, such as the 60's to 90's arrangements of Jay Stollman and the Black Allstars (Oct. 27), Future Tense's contemporary rock and roll (Nov. 3) and Roxy Perry (Nov. 10), the self-styled ''New York City's Queen of the Blues.''</p>
        <p>On Saturdays, there's stomping to classic country or to the rock and roll rhythms of, say, Gunsmoke (Oct. 14), the spunky contemporary country sounds of the Cheryl Cormier Band (Oct. 21) or River Street (Oct. 28). On both Fridays and Saturdays the groups play three one-hour sets.</p>
        <p>Sunday is family time from 6 to 8:30 p.m., with contemporary pop, swing or acoustic folk and rock music, played by such groups as the Scratch and Sniff Duo (Oct. 22 and Nov. 12 and 26), Willow (Oct. 29), Desert Sky with contemporary country (Nov. 5) or the high-powered J &amp; B Horn Squad swing band (Nov. 19). There is a $3 cover charge if you come for dinner and stay on, $4 if you come later just for the music.</p>
        <p>Hartford</p>
        <p>The name pretty much says it all at Black-Eyed Sally's BBQ &amp; Blues in Hartford. The music on tap Wednesday through Saturday evenings might feature someone like the Johnny Rawls Revue or the Sam Taylor Blues Machine, two of the groups who frequently play here. (And Wednesday nights are also open-mike nights.)</p>
        <p>As you listen, you can dine on fried Maryland oysters, Cajun popcorn, a BBQ rib sampler or Sally's pig-out platter of pulled pork, sliced beef brisket, pepperjack cheese grits and Memphis rice and beans in the tin-tiled dining room with midnight blue tin walls hung with portraits of Muddy Waters and other blues greats.</p>
        <p>Coming up are Big Jack Johnson and the Oilers (Oct. 20), Eddie Shaw and the Wolf Gang (Oct. 21), Carl Weathersby Blues Band (Oct. 27), Larry Garner and His Boogaloo Blues Band (Nov. 9) and the Phil Guy Blues Band (Nov. 17 and 18). In December, look for Michael Hill's Blues Mob (Dec. 1) and Sandra Hall and the Empress Blues Band (Dec. 8).</p>
        <p>Each Wednesday, beginning at 8:30 p.m., is open blues jam/open mike night, with one of a handful of frequently booked area bands. Thursday through Saturday, different nationally known groups appear, playing two 90-minute sets, from 9 p.m. to 12:30 a.m. Thursday, 10 p.m. to 1:30 a.m. Friday and Saturday. There is a cover charge, from $5 to $8, depending on the attraction. If you want to catch the music, make your dinner reservation for 7 p.m. or later.</p>
        <p>New Haven</p>
        <p>Hot Tomato's in New Haven is a setting so graceful you don't expect to hear the Chicago blues as played by the Cobalt Rhythm Kings every Thursday evening from 9 p.m. to midnight. The five-piece band hangs out in a corner of the ground-floor bar-dining area, but diners in the main dining room (up the winding staircase) can peer over the railings that circle the elegant room and clap and stomp with every set.</p>
        <p>Diners have a range of intriguing options from a contemporary menu threaded with Asian and Italian dishes. Personal favorites include appetizers of tuna-maki tempura and pasta pillows and entrees like salmon osso buco, pasta verdure and veal porterhouse. There is a full bar, a wine list and 13 beers on draft, along with bottled domestic microbrews and imported beers. Reservations are recommended.</p>
        <p>Norwalk</p>
        <p>Silvermine Tavern, a Colonial inn serenely ensconced on the Silvermine River in Norwalk, seems at first sight an unlikely locale for the raucous sounds of jazz. But come Thursday, Friday and Saturday evenings, that's the music that drifts out from the tavern lounge, through the six cozy dining areas decorated with early American artifacts. On a recent Thursday evening, we nibbled our way through the tavern's hefty all-you-can-eat buffet that included roast beef, corned beef, the tavern's signature chicken pot pie, a salad bar and a score of tempting desserts. While doing so, we tapped our toes to the ebullient rhythms of the Bearcats Dixieland Jazz quartet. Thursday, from 6:30 to 8:30 p.m., is always Dixieland night. It offers a great time for a family dinner out, both because of the $17.95 prix fixe buffet and the fact that children under 12 are charged 18 cents an inch of height.</p>
        <p>Friday and Saturday are jazz nights too, but the groups and hours are different, from 9 to midnight, with dinner served until 10 p.m. The menu is American, with entrees from $16 to $28.  There is a cover charge of $5 a person, plus one item on the menu, but the charge is waived for dinner guests. Reservations all three nights are suggested.</p>
