        <p>The words were blistering and seemed excessive. Kerry Collins, the Giants' quarterback, had failed to guide the team back from its first deficit last week against the Washington Redskins, and then stood behind a podium and told reporters the loss was his fault. Given a chance to share the blame, Collins repeated his admission of guilt.</p>
        <p>Collins said he played terribly, missed open receivers and could easily have been intercepted three more times.</p>
        <p>If Collins accomplished one thing last week, it was taking another step toward cementing himself as one of the Giants' leaders. Quarterbacks everywhere are supposed to take the credit and the blame for most of an offense's performance, but Collins is in his first full season as a starter with the Giants and trying to prove he can be a winner.</p>
        <p>''I think that's good that he said that because that's what a quarterback does say,'' offensive guard Glenn Parker said. ''That's part of the maturing process, but that doesn't mean that that's true. The truth is we played horrible and that's why he played horrible. He got crushed at times.''</p>
        <p>The Giants had other reasons for the offense's demise in the 16-6 loss. The offensive line allowed four sacks and left Collins scrambling for most of the game. The offensive coordinator, Sean Payton, said he could have called plays quicker.</p>
        <p>The offense as a whole has not been the dynamic attack envisioned by Payton, and today the Giants (3-1) are on the road to face a Tennessee Titans defense that is fourth best in the National Football League against the pass. The Titans (2-1) allow 171 yards a game.</p>
        <p>Coach Jim Fassel said he spoke to Payton about using long passes more. The rookie Ron Dixon's 34-yard touchdown catch is the Giants' longest pass completion in their four games. Running back Tiki Barber (18 catches) has one fewer reception than Amani Toomer, the team's leading receiver last season. Barber also has two of the Giants' four longest plays from scrimmage, both on runs.</p>
        <p>Collins and the receivers Toomer and Ike Hilliard had a breakout game against the Eagles in a 33-18 victory in the second week of the season. They helped the offense convert an astonishing 50 percent of their third-down situations. Besides that game, however, the passing attack has been overshadowed by Barber and running back Ron Dayne.</p>
        <p>When the Giants needed the pass to rally last week against the Redskins, they fell short. Collins was intercepted by Deion Sanders in the end zone on a fourth-quarter pass to Hilliard. The Giants did not score until the final three minutes.</p>
        <p>Toomer suggested that the passing game should become more aggressive and look to throw deep more, instead of being used only to convert a third down. He noted how the Giants rely on long drives to score but do not always turn them into touchdowns, a problem last season.</p>
        <p>Toomer has spoken to Payton about his concerns, and the coordinator said the Giants scripted 10 to 15 plays each game to go downfield. Payton told Toomer that if two or three plays had been converted, ''This wouldn't even be coming up.''</p>
        <p>One notable example came in the second quarter against Washington. Toomer had broken free from Sanders, but Collins's pass was too long.</p>
        <p>''We're going to take our shots downfield,'' Payton said. ''Our philosophy won't change that way. At the same time, certainly we'd like to see more of those at this point of the season after Week 4 and we have to look at the execution as much as anything.''</p>
        <p>And the execution is a team matter. Given another opportunity Friday to evaluate his performance against Washington, Collins said his comments might have been excessive because they were fueled by the emotion following a loss.</p>
        <p>''My immediate reaction, I was probably a little too harsh, a little hard on myself,'' Collins said. ''I think we're all taking responsibility for it. I think we've learned from it and moved on.''</p>
        <p>Still, many on the Giants believe Collins knew what he was doing, and they like it. He had already won over the once-skeptical defense and proven his talent as a passer. But he had yet to take the heat for his on-field performance this season. How he reacted in his first test was crucial, even if he would have preferred to succeed on the field.</p>
        <p>''Players that are leaders take that,'' Fassel said. ''Kerry is a leader on this team. He is the quarterback. He does all the things that people expect.''</p>
        <p>Collins had already dealt with the questions of off-the-field mistakes led to his release by the Carolina Panthers in 1998. And he quickly heard the second-guessing when the Giants signed him before last season to be a highly paid backup. He knew how to answer those.</p>
        <p>If there was any question whether Collins could handle adversity with the Giants, Fassel said, ''I think everybody understands that now.''</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>The Giants yesterday signed kicker JARET HOLMES and deactivated kicker BRAD DALUISO, who has a stiff back. To make room on the roster, the team waived linebacker KEVIN LEWIS. Holmes was at Giants Stadium on Friday for a tryout.</p>
