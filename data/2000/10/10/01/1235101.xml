        <p>WHENEVER Andrea Faith Gurwitt and her mother, Nissa Simon, go out to dinner together, they usually sit in total silence, eyes glazed over, busy eavesdropping on their fellow diners.</p>
        <p>''We can't help listening to other people's conversations -- at a movie theater or the ballet, anywhere,'' said Ms. Gurwitt, 34. ''Usually, people have really funny or interesting things to say. Even the mundane is interesting as long as it's not yours.''</p>

        <p>WHENEVER Andrea Faith Gurwitt and her mother, Nissa Simon, go out to dinner together, they usually sit in total silence, eyes glazed over, busy eavesdropping on their fellow diners.</p>
        <p>''We can't help listening to other people's conversations -- at a movie theater or the ballet, anywhere,'' said Ms. Gurwitt, 34. ''Usually, people have really funny or interesting things to say. Even the mundane is interesting as long as it's not yours.''</p>
        <p>One night in June 1998, Ms. Gurwitt and her mother were riding an M96 crosstown bus, headed through Central Park to Ms. Gurwitt's apartment on the Upper West Side. The eavesdropping conditions were perfect: the bus was relatively quiet and behind them sat a talkative man, Adam Charles Eidelberg.</p>
        <p>Artistic, mechanically minded and unconventional, Mr. Eidelberg was headed to his apartment on West End Avenue, where a toy train track loops through the rooms. A photographer who coordinates summer programs at the International Center of Photography, he was sitting with a colleague, lamenting his not-so-great love life.</p>
        <p>''My colleague asked me, 'What are you looking for in a woman?' '' remembered Mr. Eidelberg, 38. ''I said, 'I want to get married. I want to have children. I'm looking for somebody between 27 and 35.' She asked, 'Any particular body type?' And I said, 'No, none at all.' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Eidelberg added: ''I also said I'd been doing a lot of dating, which I had. I was doing three or four dates a week. I didn't quite live up to my dad. Before he met my mother, he went out every night except Wednesday, which was date-making night.''</p>
        <p>Listening intently, Ms. Gurwitt, who was dating someone at the time, decided that several of her single friends might be interested in Mr. Eidelberg. ''I liked his voice,'' she said. ''He sounded kind.''</p>
        <p>She and her mother got off at the same stop as he did -- 96th and Broadway -- so Ms. Gurwitt approached him on the sidewalk. ''I said, 'Please don't be embarrassed, but I heard everything you said and I have someone for you,' '' remembered Ms. Gurwitt, now a reporter at The Herald News in West Paterson, N.J. ''Adam handled it quite well. He said: 'No problem. Who is it?' ''</p>
        <p>At that point, mother and daughter began grilling him. As he remembered, they ''quizzed me about myself, including questions such as where I was born and whether my one-bedroom West Side apartment was rent controlled -- it was.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Gurwitt, whom friends describe as both strong-minded and soft-hearted, soon set Mr. Eidelberg up with someone interested in photography, but it wasn't a good match. ''No spark,'' Mr. Eidelberg said.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Mr. Eidelberg and Ms. Gurwitt met occasionally for coffee (to further discuss what he was looking for in a woman) and eventually for movies.</p>
        <p>''We started going out once a week, Wednesday nights at the movies,'' Mr. Eidelberg said. ''We had no hand-holding, nothing.''</p>
        <p>For months, they remained movie buddies. Then, one Wednesday night, Ms. Gurwitt said, she had a thought that she claimed had never occurred to her: maybe she was the one for Mr. Eidelberg. ''We were at a movie and there was music playing and Adam was dancing down the aisle and it just hit me,'' she said. As it turned out, it had already hit him.</p>
        <p>Soon, she began spending more time with him, appreciating everything from his talent for fixing a clogged drain to his ability to read her moods, even when she tried to hide them.</p>
        <p>Last Sunday, they were married at the Joseph Slifka Center for Jewish Life at Yale, in New Haven, with a reception afterward in nearby Edgerton Park, across the street from the book-filled clapboard house where the bride grew up. A few of the 130 guests commented that the couple might never have met had Ms. Gurwitt not been so friendly -- and so nosy. ''I think curiosity is a good thing,'' the bride's mother said. ''I don't think it kills cats.''</p>
