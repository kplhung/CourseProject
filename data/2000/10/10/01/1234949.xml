        <p>Barge operators in Europe traditionally shut down from about November to April, but travelers seeking river cruises then can find them in Egypt, where winter is prime season, as well as in China, Myanmar, the United States and South America.</p>
        <p>This December in Egypt, Nabila Tours and Cruises of San Francisco will begin four-night trips on Lake Nasser aboard the new, 134-passenger riverboat Queen of Abu Simbel. The ship will depart from Aswan on Mondays and call at the archaeological sites of Wadi el Sibu, Amada and Qasr Ibrim on the way to Abu Simbel. where two temples dating from about 1250 B.C. were raised 200 feet in 1966 to a cliff overlooking the lake to avoid the rising waters behind the Aswan High Dam. About 350 feet long, the ship has an outdoor pool and a spa. The fare, including shore excursions, ranges from $600 to $720 a person in double occupancy. Nabila also offers three-  and four-night cruises on the Nile between Luxor and Aswan on five other riverboats carrying 130 to 150 passengers and stopping also at Edfu and Kom Ombo. The cost is $525 to $695 a person.</p>

        <p>Barge operators in Europe traditionally shut down from about November to April, but travelers seeking river cruises then can find them in Egypt, where winter is prime season, as well as in China, Myanmar, the United States and South America.</p>
        <p>This December in Egypt, Nabila Tours and Cruises of San Francisco will begin four-night trips on Lake Nasser aboard the new, 134-passenger riverboat Queen of Abu Simbel. The ship will depart from Aswan on Mondays and call at the archaeological sites of Wadi el Sibu, Amada and Qasr Ibrim on the way to Abu Simbel. where two temples dating from about 1250 B.C. were raised 200 feet in 1966 to a cliff overlooking the lake to avoid the rising waters behind the Aswan High Dam.

Nabila also offers three-  and four-night cruises on the Nile between Luxor and Aswan on five other riverboats carrying 130 to 150 passengers and stopping also at Edfu and Kom Ombo. The cost is $525 to $695 a person.</p>
        <p>In Myanmar, the season for a cruise on the Irrawaddy River is September to April, and one of the vessels making the trip is the 126-passenger Road to Mandalay, operated by Orient Express Trains and Cruises and marketed in the United States by Abercrombie &amp; Kent. A three-night cruise from Mandalay to Bagan, including sightseeing, costs $1,780 to $3,590 and includes a flight from Yangon (formerly Rangoon) to Mandalay with return from Bagan to Yangon.</p>
        <p>The Three Gorges of the Yangtze River in China, destined like the original site of Abu Simbel to be filled by water backing up from a massive dam, are being visited by the boats of at least two companies, Regal China Cruises and Victoria Cruises. Regal China Cruises offers a package through Nov. 21 that includes a three-  or five-night cruise between Chongqing and Wuhan and a half-day tour in both cities, ranging from $1,049 to $2,399 a person in double occupancy. Through Nov. 29 Victoria Cruises offers a series of two-  to nine-night cruises, some of them originating in Shanghai, for $630 to $3,520.</p>
        <p>Another spectacular gorge is the Columbia River Gorge between Oregon and Washington, where the newest American riverboat, the 161-passenger Columbia Queen of the Delta Queen Steamboat Company of New Orleans, went into service in May. Each stateroom has satellite TV and a radio, a VCR and a ship-to-shore telephone with a data port; some have balconies. The Columbia Queen offers an eight-night program that includes a night's hotel stay in Portland as well as a seven-night, 1,000-mile cruise on the Willamette, Columbia and Snake Rivers between Astoria, Ore., and Lewiston, Idaho, the gateway to Hells Canyon. Fares range from $2,100 to $4,300 a person in double occupancy. A similar seven-night itinerary on another paddlewheeler, the 146-passenger Queen of the West of the American West Steamboat Company of Seattle, costs $1,859 to $3,929 a person in double occupancy. The company also has four-night cruises and a seven-night rail-cruise trip with Amtrak.</p>
        <p>Along the Gulf Coast of Louisiana and Texas, Riverbarge Excursion Lines of New Orleans, which began cruises on the Mississippi River in 1998, is adding service as far as Matamoros, Mexico. In December and January the company, which operates the 198-passenger River Explorer, has scheduled seven-night trips on what is described as the Route of Jean Lafitte between Port Isabel and Galveston, Tex. Calls include Matamoros, just south of Brownsville; South Padre Island and Corpus Christi, Tex. Fares range from $1,970 to $2,330 a person in double occupancy.</p>
        <p>Some riverboat operators have formed associations to handle reservations, but travelers can usually make reservations for almost any cruise with a travel agent. Here is a selected listing of companies and representatives offering river cruises in various parts of the world:</p>
