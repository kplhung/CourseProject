        <p>''Art Nouveau, 1890-1914,'' which opens next Sunday at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, is, according to Paul Greenhalgh, curator of the exhibition at the Victoria and Albert Museum, among the most extensive collections of the style ever presented.

        <p>More than 350 works will be on display, including lithographs by Toulouse-Lautrec and Alphonse Mucha. Also featured are extraordinary, organically shaped furniture pieces in exotic woods by Hector Guimard, who designed the plantlike cast-iron entrance gates to many Paris Metro stations.</p>

        <p>''Art Nouveau, 1890-1914,'' which opens next Sunday at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, is, according to Paul Greenhalgh, curator of the exhibition at the Victoria and Albert Museum, among the most extensive collections of the style ever presented. The exhibit closed in London in July, and will travel on to Tokyo in April 2001.</p>
        <p>More than 350 works will be on display, including lithographs by Toulouse-Lautrec and Alphonse Mucha. Also featured are extraordinary, organically shaped furniture pieces in exotic woods by Hector Guimard, who designed the plantlike cast-iron entrance gates to many Paris Metro stations.</p>
        <p>Art Nouveau is characterized by its synthesis of structure and richly ornamental  decoration based on natural forms, but intimations of more stripped-down 20th-century art can be seen in pieces like Josef Hoffmann's gridlike ''Skyscraper Basket.'' The exhibition ties together the manifold sources of the style at the turn of the century, from Celtic revival to the Symbolist movement and a new interest in Oriental art.</p>
        <p>Other highlights include dragonfly and cobweb lamps from the Tiffany Studios and housewares by Frank Lloyd Wright.</p>
        <p>The exhibition will run through Jan. 28, 2001, at the National Gallery of Art, East Building, on the Mall between Third and Ninth Streets at Constitution Avenue NW.  The gallery is open Monday through Saturday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., and Sunday 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission is free. Information: (202) 737-4215, or visit the museum's Web site at www.nga.gov.</p>
