        <p>''It's O.K. to Be Smart'' is not your standard graffito. But that's what's written on the yellow Brain Quest Bus, which will visit New Jersey for six weeks starting Oct. 10. The bus, which promotes the popular question-and-answer card game, will hold Brain Quest Challenges for children in second through fifth grades at various schools. All participants will get a prize -- a T-shirt, mouse pad, stickers or tattoos -- whether their answers are right or not. The winners at each school become that school's team, and face teams from other county schools. The winning school gets $500 worth of library books from Workman, which puts out Brain Quest. The bus will visit Camden County Oct. 10 to 14; Middlesex County Oct. 16 to 21; Morris County Oct. 23 to 28; Essex County Oct. 30 through Nov. 4; and Bergen County Nov. 6 through 11. The full schedule is available on the Web at www.brainquest.com by clicking on the yellow bus. After the bus rolls on, the stops will be memorialized in a diary on the site.</p>
