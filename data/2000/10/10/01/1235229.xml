        <p>Palace Amusements in Asbury Park, known for the grinning painted face of Tillie, took a step toward protection from demolition last week when the State Review Board for Historic Sites unanimously recommended its listing in the New Jersey Register of Historic Places. Asbury Park sought to demolish the structure late last year, but held off after an engineering firm said it could be saved. The State Office of Natural and Historic Resources must decide within 90 days whether to list it. Inclusion in the register means developers would have to consult with the state before beginning any construction that could affect the site.</p>
