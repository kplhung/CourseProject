        <p>The Census Bureau reported that median household income rose in 1999 to top $40,000, the fifth consecutive annual increase. The increase was fueled by relatively large increases in household incomes for the poor: 11.8 percent of the population was living below the poverty line, defined as $17,029 for a family of four, the lowest poverty rate since 1979. More than 2.2 million fewer people were considered poor last year, and 81 percent of that decline occurred in inner cities, suggesting that prosperity has begun to trickle down.</p>
