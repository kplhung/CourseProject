        <p>A snapshot from Prague: One cool, hazy night, a day after black-masked anarchists attacked police lines and rattled delegates to the meeting of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, Horst Kohler and James D. Wolfensohn, respectively the new managing director of the I.M.F. and the World Bank president, stood at an outdoor ceremony with fixed smiles on their faces.</p>
        <p>Jubilee 2000, a leading pressure group for third-world debt relief, presented them with a petition, and gave them a dressing down. '</p>
        <p>'Your declarations have proven to be empty promises once again,'' one speaker scolded. The two officials vowed to do better and left shaking hands.</p>
        <p>Just a decade ago leading economists in the United States and Europe settled on a new strategy for fighting poverty. In return for long-term loans, poor nations got mandatory lessons in capitalism, what might be called the teach-a-man-to-trade theory of aid.</p>
        <p>It seemed like a great solution at the time. After the fall of Communism, poor nations hungered for unbridled capitalism. And the industrial countries had more energy for lecturing than they did money for traditional aid, which plummeted in the 1990's.</p>
        <p>But as Prague sweeps up the shattered shop window glass left over from the violence-plagued meeting of global aid agencies last week, one thing has become clear: The old way of thinking is now economically debatable and politically untouchable.</p>
        <p>In its place is emerging a new consensus about helping the poor that shifts some of the burden to the rich. It has the potential to raise living standards, but will cost a great deal more money.</p>
        <p>The new consensus has three main elements. First, loans are fine, but grants are better, especially for humanitarian projects like fighting AIDS and malaria. The World Bank and other development agencies keep even their low-interest loans on their books as assets. Grants, however, are write-offs, and will require more cash infusions from donor countries if the aid agencies want to preserve their capital.</p>
        <p>Second, debt relief must come faster and be more generous. There are 41 nations eligible for debt relief, whose average debt load is 125 percent of their gross domestic product. Rich nations have begun a slow process of relieving this crushing burden, but the drumbeat to forgive much more of the third world's debt is deafening for government ministers, who seem to up their pledges with every anti-globalization riot.</p>
        <p>Third, trade is a two-way street. There is broad agreement that poor nations have done more than their fair share to free up trade, and the pressure is on rich nations to open their markets wider to the things poor countries make.</p>
        <p>For Europe and Japan, that means lowering the wall protecting their farmers. For the United States, it means a showdown with the influential textile and sugar lobbies.</p>
        <p>The betting is that these kinds of changes will throw a lifeline to the world's poorest people, defined as those earning $2 or less a day. They number a staggering 3 billion, roughly half the world's population.</p>
        <p>The World Bank acknowledges that the poor in Africa, Latin America and the former Soviet Union did not benefit much from the roaring prosperity of the 1990's. They may eventually benefit from the almost universal shift toward market economics, but that has not happened yet.</p>
        <p>The new thinking aims for more immediate results. Easing debt loads, handing out grants directly to villages, clinics and schools, and providing more export opportunities for the crops grown and the shirts stitched by the poorest workers could help. But there will be a price to pay.</p>
        <p>''We have to tackle the selfishness of wealthy countries,'' says Mr. Kohler. ''This is a question of morals.''</p>
        <p>And of expediency. The I.M.F. and the World Bank, its fellow Washington-based global lender, have been front-line targets of the anti-globalization movement that has spread from Seattle to Washington and Prague.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Kohler and Mr. Wolfensohn are edging closer to their critics, even pandering a little. Though they still espouse free market capitalism, they argue for a humane approach to poverty relief that puts developing nations in charge and cuts some strings attached to aid.</p>
        <p>When the aid experts talked about economic overhauls in Prague, they were as often calling for changes in wealthy nations as for the 90's-formula medicine prescribed to the poor.</p>
        <p>Their message is: We want to fight poverty more effectively, but it will only work if industrial countries dip into their pockets and challenge their entrenched domestic interests on trade and, by extension, on employment.</p>
        <p>''The globalization battle is really about the parsimony of the G-7,'' said Trevor A. Manuel, South Africa's finance minister, who chaired the Prague sessions. He was referring to the United States, Japan, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Canada, members of the Group of 7 developed countries.</p>
        <p>Financial leaders from rich nations are beginning to feel the heat, and they are touting their own anti-poverty strategies.</p>
        <p>Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers, who said in Prague that the poverty battle has become ''the overarching economic and humanitarian challenge of our time,'' proposed last week that the World Bank replace some loans with outright grants, a first. The proposal echoed a key demand made by a Congressional commission that recently criticized the bank as a feckless anachronism.</p>
        <p>Trouble is, Congress is still practicing tough love. American foreign aid declined an average of 8 percent annually in the 1990's. The average American had $42 of his taxes devoted to foreign aid in 1993, and $32 in 1998, according to World Bank figures. The United States is the stingiest rich nation, but aid declined in many European countries as they tightened their budgets for monetary union.</p>
        <p>With the backlash against globalization mounting, the next president will probably have to figure out a way to persuade lawmakers to provide more aid and debt relief, even while making politically tricky compromises on trade. It will be a hard sell, but Mr. Kohler of the I.M.F. says he has the solution.</p>
        <p>''It will be very helpful,'' he says with a smile, ''when these groups that have been attacking us turn their attention to the Congress.''</p>
