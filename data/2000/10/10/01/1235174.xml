        <p>SHE was sitting in the Brooklyn Botanic Garden the other day, feeding a duck out of her hand. She looked serene, as befitted a soon-to-be-ordained Zen priest.</p>
        <p>''You can perform legal marriages,'' she said of her impending priesthood, which ''gets the legal clergy status, those parking spaces that say Clergy Only.'' She laughed.</p>
        <p>Angel Kyodo Williams, native New Yorker and woman about town, also has the distinction of having just written her first book. It is called ''Being Black: Zen and the Art of Living With Fearlessness and Grace'' (Viking Compass, 2000).</p>
        <p>Ms. Williams's book, which is due in stores next week, is more than just a paean to Buddhism. It is also a call for black Americans to look inward. More than most groups, she says, blacks suffer from stress and externalized notions of who they are. Zen practice, she believes, offers the way to peace because of its focus on stillness and introspection.</p>
        <p>After more than three decades of legal enfranchisement, Ms. Williams believes that black people need to look beyond fitting into America. They need to make space in their lives for existential questions.</p>
        <p>Ms. Williams, whose Buddhist middle name means ''way of teaching,'' is 30 years old and very much a child of the city. She grew up in Queens, Brooklyn and Manhattan. Her parents were divorced, and she lived with her father, a city firefighter. She now lays her head in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>Her buddies include the writer Rebecca Walker, the daughter of Alice Walker, and she counts the elder Ms. Walker and Gloria Steinem as mentors.</p>
        <p>Like many American Buddhists, Ms. Williams came to the religion from Protestantism, seeking answers to the usual questions about self-identity and spirituality. They are questions complicated by a society that too often substitutes race for real identity, Ms. Williams said. Those distortions can range, for instance, from the benign stereotype of blacks as good dancers to the malignant stereotype of intellectual inferiority.</p>
        <p>Blacks can also come down hard on one another, Ms. Williams said, if someone is seen as straying too far from the group. The identity patrol can lead to such silliness as making fun of a black person who prefers European classical music to hip-hop, or such self-defeating behavior as shunning good grades as ''white.''</p>
        <p>When she was growing up in Flatbush, the girl who sat behind her in fifth grade maliciously snipped off one of her long braids. Ms. Williams said she was an outcast.</p>
        <p>''I was just not black enough,'' she recalled. ''I spoke very, very proper English. And the white teachers liked me. I did not keep up with the ever-changing criteria for being black.</p>
        <p>''The title of the book is very much tongue in cheek,'' Ms. Williams said. ''Being black, there's no such thing, really. But of course, there is. There is a something. But there's no easy way to get a fix on it.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Williams contends that beyond the  difficulties inherent in the human condition,  African-Americans have suffered uniquely, not just enslaved, but completely shorn of cultural connectors like country of origin, religion, ethnicity, language and name.</p>
        <p>Lacking ''a consistent cultural reference point,'' blacks can resort to mean-spirited and self-defeating ways to determine who is really black and who is not, she said.</p>
        <p>She understands that behavior, though. It is a defense and a reaction to being isolated, marginalized and rendered invisible.</p>
        <p>Three years ago, Ms. Williams had an experience that illuminated her need for new answers. In 1996 she and Rebecca Walker founded Kokobar Cafe in Fort Greene, Brooklyn. The cafe opened around the time that once-struggling black neighborhood was becoming fashionable.</p>
        <p>The financial backers included the filmmaker Spike Lee and the singer Tracy Chapman. The place attracted much media attention after being billed as the first cybercafe owned and operated by black women. In addition to espresso, the cafe had half a dozen computers that allowed people from the neighborhood to use the Internet.</p>
        <p>Then Ms. Chapman called in her loan. The cafe closed in 1997. Painful as that was for Ms. Williams, she was also hurt because many black old-timers from the neighborhood resented Kokobar. Because it was run by women. Because it attracted a large white clientele. Because she and Ms. Walker did not fit their notions of who women should be.</p>
        <p>''People need to get out of their heads about who they are,'' Ms. Williams said, looking across the duck pond in the Japanese Garden. 'I'm challenging white folks too, to peel their eyelids back and try to get an inkling of blackness, particularly in America.</p>
        <p>''We have to expand the definition of blackness, for sure,'' she said. ''It's incumbent upon all of us to stretch the boundaries, to experience everyone else's boxes.''</p>
