        <p>The title of THE TELLING (Harcourt, $24), Ursula K. Le Guin's new novel, may reveal more about the book's virtues and flaws than she realizes. Its protagonist, Sutty, is an Indo-Canadian who becomes an Observer for the Ekumen, the benign organization that looks after the varied worlds settled by humans.</p>
        <p>Sutty comes from an Earth ruled by a religious dictatorship that thinks nothing of bombing the Library of Congress to eliminate a repository of dangerous ideas. Her first diplomatic station is Aka, a world in the grip of a Corporate State so determined to lift itself by its technological bootstraps that it has tried to eliminate old religions, old languages, history itself.</p>

        <p>The title of THE TELLING (Harcourt, $24), Ursula K. Le Guin's new novel, may reveal more about the book's virtues and flaws than she realizes. Its protagonist, Sutty, is an Indo-Canadian who becomes an Observer for the Ekumen, the benign organization that looks after the varied worlds settled by humans.</p>
        <p>Sutty comes from an Earth ruled by a religious dictatorship that thinks nothing of bombing the Library of Congress to eliminate a repository of dangerous ideas. Her first diplomatic station is Aka, a world in the grip of a Corporate State so determined to lift itself by its technological bootstraps that it has tried to eliminate old religions, old languages, history itself.</p>
        <p>The twin totalitarianisms of religion and of science weigh heavily on Sutty -- and on the reader, who is never allowed to forget how closely they mimic each other. Searching the Akan hinterland for remnants of the banned traditional culture, Sutty uncovers a tenacious resistance movement devoted to preserving the old ways, which turn out to be rooted in a mind-set akin to Earth's Taoism.</p>
        <p>Like most of Le Guin's science fiction, ''The Telling'' is essentially an anthropological puzzle story. How does Akan society function? How did it get that way? Although Le Guin takes care to give Sutty a past -- through long flashbacks about her family and her lover -- she remains little more than a mouthpiece for the author's personal vision of the good society as realized on Aka: ''Good was an adjective, always: good food, good health, good sex, good weather. No capital letters. Good or Evil as entities, warring powers, never.'' Central to this now-threatened way of life is ''the Telling,'' a continual exchange of ideas, stories, memories and feelings. Great tellers are revered, but everyone shares in this sacrament: ''We are the world. We're its language. . . . If we don't say the words, what is there in our world?''</p>
        <p>Le Guin provides Sutty with an antagonist, a state functionary as devoted to Akan Corporation dogma as Sutty is to learning the truth. But their clashes strike no sparks. We are told about, but we never feel, Sutty's personal stake in her task on Aka. For all her eagerness to share her vision, Le Guin has forgotten that even in didactic fiction, showing is always preferable to telling.</p>
        <p>THE SKY ROAD, by Ken MacLeod (Tor/ Tom Doherty, $24.95), runs on parallel narrative tracks. One story line is set in a future Scotland, a society of oddly limited technology that owes its origin to a murky event known as the Deliverance, which somehow freed humanity from television, computers and other electronic instruments of oppression. Two lovers named Merrial and Clovis take on the job of finding out exactly what happened.</p>
        <p>The second story line dips back in time to the 21st century to record the adventures of Myra Godwin-Davidova as she parlays her leadership of a tiny Central Asian state into a pivotal role in world history. How Myra becomes the Deliverer is the burden of both story lines, which converge neatly at the end.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, the two stories are grossly unequal in their ability to sustain your interest. Merrial and Clovis, with secrets of their own, make an appealing pair of historical sleuths; and their post-Deliverance society is vigorously if sparely delineated. By contrast, Myra's cut-and-thrust machinations involving political entities with names like the International Scientific and Technical Workers' Republic come across as neither satirical nor cautionary but merely self-indulgent. One problem may be that MacLeod, who introduced Myra and this particular 21st-century setting in earlier stories, apparently expects us to be as enthralled as he is with the detailed Realpolitik of his imaginary future.</p>
        <p>THE BRIDGE, by Janine Ellen Young (Aspect/Warner, paper, $6.50), is nothing if not ambitious. Young has borrowed the central premise of ''Close Encounters of the Third Kind'' and Carl Sagan's ''Contact'' and stuffed a globe-spanning soap opera into it. Far-distant aliens devise a space probe to identify other intelligent life in the universe. When the probe reaches Earth, its viruslike ''passengers'' make some people mortally ill while conveying to others bits and pieces of a blueprint for a machine that will allow humans and aliens to establish faster-than-light contact.</p>
        <p>Instead of pursuing this familiar but always beguiling premise, Young gives full rein to her emotionally overendowed characters. While billions die, young people fall in love in prose that calls to mind an unlikely liaison between F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ayn Rand: ''And, in the distance, behind it all, Manhattan, like some tomorrow city, its skyline all promises and dreams.'' ''She had the face of a child finding the first star. . . . He felt his heart begin to melt.''</p>
        <p>By accentuating the personal, Young might have given a human face to her story of interstellar confrontation. But the sentimental education of her large cast of characters throws little light on the main event. Despite the obstacles placed in the way of the dreamers, there is little suspense; anyone who doubts that interspecies love will triumph in the end has not been paying attention to all that heavy breathing.</p>
        <p>DUNE: House Harkonnen (Spectra/Bantam, $27.50) is the second ''prequel'' to the classic series by the late Frank Herbert. Written by Frank's son Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson, the new Dune novel succeeds admirably in setting the stage for the epic conflicts recounted in the earlier books -- in which the fate of a galactic empire is determined on a strange desert planet inhabited by monstrous sandworms and the fiercely independent people called Fremen.</p>
        <p>As always in the Dune saga, the plot turns on long-term schemes of vengeance and redemption. Herbert and Anderson delight in explaining the technologies and philosophies behind such mysterious and powerful forces as the Spacing Guild and the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood. They take their time introducing the heroes and villains who will grow up to contest the galaxy. The fun comes when selected villains get their just deserts -- not to be confused with Dune's principal export, the exceedingly rare ''spice'' that allows humans to see, if darkly, into the future.</p>
        <p>Following Frank Herbert's lead, each chapter is headed with a portentous quotation from one of the holy books or instruction manuals of the day. These often restate the obvious in suitably Delphic tones: ''Discovery is dangerous . . . but so is life.'' Occasionally, they rise to what passes for wisdom in the world according to Herbert: ''The universe is our picture. Only the immature imagine the cosmos to be what they think it is.''</p>
