        <p>TAKEOUT meals, books on tape, mail order, even the much-abused use of the cell phone -- they're all ways to survive in a time-crunched society. Those employing all these tools and still finding it hard to fit in time for a good time, might try this approach to eating out:  bring family or friends to the table and add entertainment.</p>
        <p>One of the local dining spots where entertainments abound is The Bayou. This Louisiana-inspired restaurant and club is crammed with the colorful and sometimes wild paraphernalia of the state's cultures. Mardi Gras and voodoo; jazz, blues and zydeco; jambalaya, mudbugs and po'boys -- it's all here.</p>

        <p>TAKEOUT meals, books on tape, mail order, even the much-abused use of the cell phone -- they're all ways to survive in a time-crunched society. Those employing all these tools and still finding it hard to fit in time for a good time, might try this approach to eating out:  bring family or friends to the table and add entertainment.</p>
        <p>One of the local dining spots where entertainments abound is The Bayou. This Louisiana-inspired restaurant and club is crammed with the colorful and sometimes wild paraphernalia of the state's cultures. Mardi Gras and voodoo; jazz, blues and zydeco; jambalaya, mudbugs and po'boys -- it's all here.</p>
        <p>The food is quite good, with seasoning that runs from mild to incendiary. (More than 100 hot sauces always stand at the ready.)  Try crawfish pie, barbecue pork or blackened chicken po'boy, Bourbon Street ribs or grilled catfish. Smashed potatoes, cole slaw and cornbread are musts.</p>
        <p>Sunday brunch is a treat, especially when on the second Sunday of every month a gospel-singing group comes on board to add extra zip to a plate of eggs. On most evenings, musicians take over the tiny stage, usually late.</p>
        <p>Wednesday night is Voodoo Night. For $10, Angela will give a ''spiritual reading,'' telling it like it is, or isn't.</p>
        <p>The Bayou, as well as some other spots mentioned here, sometimes charges admission or a cover. Get on the mailing list for a calendar of events and prices. (See accompanying box.)</p>
        <p>Xaviar's in Garrison offers an elegant Sunday brunch, accompanied by genteel harp music. The lofty dining room in what was once a ballroom and views of rolling greens are upstaged only by the tempting buffet table laden with roasts and delicious salads. What makes brunch here very special are the superb extra dishes passed to every table over the course of a meal. These  marvelous little mouthfuls might include oysters Rockefeller, vegetable fritter, coconut shrimp or a fluff of cauliflower mousse sprinkled with black caviar.</p>
        <p>On a tree-lined street in Ossining in the charming historic district called Sparta,  Dudley's occupies a small purple clapboard.  The dining room is cozy and romantic. On Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights beginning about 7, a duo or trio plays soft jazz, the mellow classics that, some will remember, tell a sweet story.</p>
        <p>The food is creatively and carefully prepared. Ingredients and combinations may sound extravagant, but they work beautifully. Farmed kangaroo, antelope or ostrich might be on hand with more familiar fish, duck and pork selections.</p>
        <p>The gardens at Harvest on Hudson are something to see, poised dramatically (as is the restaurant itself) on the edge of the Hudson River. On Thursdays and Sundays, while pleasant weather still holds, diners  can enjoy both sights and sounds at this special location. Music wafts over the blooms starting around 6 p.m. Inside, in the soaring, high-tech dining room, a jazz group takes the stage around 10 on Friday nights.</p>
        <p>Although food can't compete with the kind of scenery this waterfront spot offers, the kitchen has some solid moments. One can't go wrong with iced oysters of the season  from the raw bar, tuna tartar or a bowl of one of the pastas.</p>
        <p>It's hard to elbow into small, sleek and sophisticated Ernaccio's 17 Main after 10 on a Friday or Saturday night. The jazz is good and the crowd lively. From 5:30 on Sundays, soothing guitar music accompanies dinner. Seductive appetizers make a tasty snack at the bar or an opener for a full dinner. Intriguing gravlax with potato pancake, mushrooms and snails in phyllo can pave the way for a bowl of seven-bean chili. Lamb, tuna or chicken will please heartier appetites.</p>
        <p>Up in Putnam, when it was still a sleepy county, the Towne Crier Cafe was an unlikely showcase for the talented musicians it managed to entice from around the globe. Today, the area bustles with new houses, giant shopping plazas and a population eager to be entertained. Behind a southwestern facade, the Crier's large dining hall is often packed with a multigenerational audience, which comes for the food and the music -- blues, folk or rock performed on a small stage tucked into a corner. It's also worth checking the schedule for Magical Mystical Michael, a witty magician who performs now and then.</p>
        <p>Burritos, barbecue pork with blue corn tacos and nachos are listed along with  pizzas and heavy duty items like roasted duckling, grilled salmon and pastas. Desserts are legend.</p>
        <p>On a smaller scale The Turning Point brings similar musical groups to Rockland. Space in the downstairs cafe and bar is devoted to performances. Here patrons might order snacks, salads, hamburgers and hot and cold sandwiches from a supper menu. In the upstairs restaurant, diners having a complete meal with hot entrees before the show are given the advantage of reserving a seat for the performance.</p>
        <p>In a rustic river shack attached to a marina, rock or blues groups set up in the bar at Striped Bass every Friday and Saturday from about 10. Even in winter, the place has an open- air, island feel, evoked, perhaps, by a Margarita, a bottle of Red Stripe beer, a raw bar and a few spicy hot Jamaican-style items. Barbecued ribs and lobsters are good, too, and there's pasta for those who want to play it safe.</p>
        <p>Westchester Broadway Theater has been entertaining people for so long that it's almost a landmark. Between musicals -- ''The Sound of Music'' is just closing; ''Crazy for You'' and ''Hello, Dolly!'' are coming up -- short-run performances featuring comedians and vocalists and children's programs including, this year, the musical ''Beauty and the Beast'' and Halloween and December holiday specials fill the schedule.</p>
        <p>At performances that offer a meal option, food is served at tables in the terraced theater just before curtain time. While nothing to write home about, dishes are decent enough, and dining right in the theater brings novelty to the occasion.</p>
