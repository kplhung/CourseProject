        <p>The new scouting season is under way in this quiet Westchester County village, as parents register their younger sons for Cub Scouts and pack up their older boys for the season's first weekend camp-outs at Clear Lake.</p>
        <p>This was once a pleasant and predictable moment. Now it is a skirmish in America's latest culture war, this time with children caught in the middle, and the commotion growing louder because of a United States Supreme Court ruling upholding the right of the Boy Scouts of America to exclude gays.</p>
        <p>Maybe it was inevitable, given the role it has played as the curator of traditional values, that the Boy Scouts of America would find itself in the middle of this conflict: a symbol of virtue to some and something akin to a hate group to others. But where does that leave the children? Are they being deprived of a valuable experience so adults can stand on principle? Or will they be enriched by being part of a significant civic debate, however shrill?</p>
        <p>In the last few days, the din has grown louder, with another charity, the United Way of Westchester and Putnam Counties, withdrawing its support, and another government and school system, New York City's, reconsidering their relationship with the Boy Scouts, which for 90 years has taught boys skills, values, leadership and patriotism.</p>
        <p>First, the president of the United Way affiliate announced to the editorial board of The Journal News of White Plains that it would no longer contribute its customary donation. The executive of the local Boy Scout council fired off an official defense and began a new fund-raising campaign. Meanwhile, New York's mayor and schools chancellor publicly pondered whether city schools could continue to house and help Boy Scout groups.</p>
        <p>In Ardsley, 40 minutes from Midtown Manhattan, there were no news conferences or position papers, no pronouncements by the executive director of this or the president of that. Which is not to say that all was quiet on this suburban front. Here, the anxiety, anger, bewilderment and feelings of betrayal were played out in private -- at dinner table discussions between husbands and wives, in heart-to-heart talks with children, during tense conversations among neighbors and in the nervous chatter of scout leaders who felt the reaction moving their way.</p>
        <p>And there was plenty to chew on, as there always is when people of good will disagree. ''It's an opportunity for us to talk to each other as a community,'' said John Lloyd, a fund-raising consultant with two sons, ''which is how people determine what their values are.''</p>
        <p>One of Mr. Lloyd's sons was a member of a small Cub Scout den that just recently disbanded after his family and one other decided to withdraw their children to protest the Boy Scout policy and the Supreme Court decision. The two other 9-year-olds in the den, whose parents had not informed them of the controversy, decided to drop out because their friends were not returning.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, a Boy Scout troop in Ardsley that remains intact is going through the motions of scheduling an October camp-out, promoting boys from second class to first class and teaching newcomers to recite the Scout Oath.</p>
        <p>But the leaders of that troop fear that change is in the wind.</p>
        <p>What if the Methodist Church here, where the Boy Scouts have met for 80 years, decides to end its sponsorship? What if the schools, where the scouts distribute fliers and hold their annual Pinewood Derby of homemade cars, send them packing?</p>
        <p>''Maybe it won't affect us this year, but there's the potential next year,'' said Dr. Ronald Preston, a cardiologist and the assistant scoutmaster of Ardsley Troop 3. ''It's holding the kids hostage.''</p>
        <p>The reaction against the Boy Scouts saddens but does not surprise David Blankenhorn, president of the Institute for American Values, a New York organization that researches family issues. ''Contests over symbols have real-world consequences,'' he said, ''and when I say 'symbols,' I don't mean to suggest something trivial because some people are willing to die for their symbols.''</p>
        <p>The Boy Scouts, Mr. Blankenhorn said, ''are the most potent symbol of what used to be called the American way of life.'' He sees the events of recent months -- the withdrawal of some charities, corporations, municipalities and a small number of families -- as a grave threat. ''You can tear down an institution with this kind of divisiveness. You can argue until there's nothing on the ground but rubble.''</p>
        <p>Others see the dialogue as a difficult but potentially enriching experience for parents, children and communities. Andrew J. Cherlin, a professor of sociology at Johns Hopkins University, said youngsters were the ''innocent bystanders'' and urged parents ''to be careful not to sacrifice their children's happiness for their own causes.''</p>
        <p>But he continued: ''There comes a point where a parent says, 'It's more important for my child to learn this lesson than to have fun.' It's a serious move, but that doesn't mean it shouldn't be done, and the children will remember. A generation from now, these 9-year-olds will be telling their kids what happened, some with bitterness and some with gratitude.''</p>
        <p>The unintended collapse of one of the Cub Scout dens here began with two families, both passionately opposed to the Scouts' ban on gay members, deciding jointly to take a stand. Mr. Lloyd and another father, Dr. Bruce Gelb, an associate professor of pediatrics at Mount Sinai Medical School, first told their sons' den leader, Michael Macleish. (Mr. Macleish declined to be interviewed, and all the families involved said their children asked not to be identified by their first names.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Lloyd and Dr. Gelb said their decision to withdraw, made shortly after the Supreme Court ruling in June, was agonizing. Their boys had benefited from scouting, the two men said, particularly its focus on patriotism and community, and they greatly admired Mr. Macleish for his ability to get along in the wilderness as well as for his empathy for the boys, including his own son, who was part of the den. ''This is pretty complicated stuff,'' Dr. Gelb said. ''And in the end I'm left with sadness, certainly not anger or victory, because my kid lost something.''</p>
        <p>In making his decision, Dr. Gelb read about the Scouts' policy, the Supreme Court decision and child development. He concluded that banning gay leaders was as objectionable as excluding blacks or Jews. To continue to participate, he said, ''at some level was endorsing it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lloyd said he needed less research to arrive at the conclusion that he could not remain a member of an organization he considered bigoted. He had once worked for the American Civil Liberties Union, raising money for projects seeking equal rights for gays, among other causes.</p>
        <p>Such issues were at the heart of both his work and his life. ''This is the quintessential civil rights experience,'' he said. ''It happens one person at a time.''</p>
        <p>The two fathers agreed to speak to their sons on the same evening. Dr. Gelb said his son was visibly disappointed. His goal was to be an Eagle Scout, and he was about to leave for a week of Boy Scout camp. ''In a perfect world you want your kid to jump up and say, 'I want no part of it,' '' Dr. Gelb said. ''But as time goes by, I think he'll understand it more and think he did something significant.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lloyd left the decision to his son, although he said he was sure the boy understood his father's preference after a long conversation they had about discrimination, the Supreme Court and the expulsion of a  gay scout leader in New Jersey that prompted nine years of litigation and the court's decision.</p>
        <p>''What do you think you should do?'' Mr. Lloyd remembers asking.</p>
        <p>''I don't think I should be in anymore,'' he said his son replied.</p>
        <p>Rick Okrasinski, a computer consultant who is the local Cub Scout committee chairman and an assistant leader of Boy Scout Troop 3, said that after the Lloyd and Gelb boys quit, the two other boys in the den were less enthusiastic.</p>
        <p>''It stands to reason,'' he said. ''Kids that age want to be with their friends. Maybe if this situation gets reversed, and it goes their way, they'll come back.''</p>
        <p>The children have clearly discussed it among themselves. During a telephone interview, one mother, Monica Oberlander, was interrupted by her son, who told her that his fellow Cub Scouts had quit because the Boy Scouts ''discriminate against people.'' She quieted him by saying he was too young to be concerned about anything but ''arts and crafts, hiking and having lots of fun.''</p>
        <p>She said: ''I don't think he understands the issue at all. But now he's saying he doesn't want to do it.''</p>
        <p>To the leaders of the Boy Scout troop, whose members are older and less likely to have decisions dictated by their parents, the disbanding of the Cub Scout den is a pity. Dr. Preston, the assistant scoutmaster, struck a parallel to the Roman Catholic Church, which along with the Mormons is a major supporter of the Boy Scouts</p>
        <p>''Do people stop going to Mass because they don't believe in the church's position on birth control?'' Dr. Preston asked. ''Why throw out the baby with the bath water?''</p>
