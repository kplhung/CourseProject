        <p>DEAR DIARY:</p>
        <p>About 10 minutes after ''The Croupier'' began rolling at the Screening Room, a small movie theater in Montclair, two couples walked down the aisle, talking loudly. After a public discussion about where to sit, they continued jabbering before settling down.</p>
        <p>After making their way to the lobby when the movie ended, the latecomers, without introduction, asked another viewer, ''How did it start?''</p>
        <p>The man answered tartly: ''I can't tell you. Some people walked in and talked so loudly, I couldn't hear the movie.''</p>

        <p>Scene: Ridgewood street fair.</p>
        <p>A couple -- the man an impulse buyer, the woman a skeptic -- stop at a booth where cell phone accessories are sold. After paying $49 for a device to recharge a phone in a car, his partner says, ''I think you'd better try that out right away.''</p>
        <p>They dash to their car and -- sure enough -- the gadget doesn't work.</p>
        <p>''Let's hurry back to return this gizmo,'' she says. ''I bet the vendor will say, 'Your phone's too old.' ''</p>
        <p>Approaching the booth, the woman reads the vendor's lips as he says to an assistant, ''Here comes a credit.''</p>
        <p>The man reports, ''This gadget doesn't fit my phone.''</p>
        <p>To which the vendor replies, ''Your phone's too old,'' and quickly turns to a new prospect.</p>
        <p>The new customer, a youth, needs an earphone, which the vendor proceeds to pitch. The youth then takes the latest model cell phone from his pocket and plugs in the attachment. It doesn't work.</p>
        <p>This time the vendor says, ''Your phone's too new.''</p>
        <p>The couple and the young man meet at another stand and find they have something in common: zeppoli. The man pays off his bet to the skeptical woman and treats the surprised youth. They slowly walk away from the great street fair.</p>

        <p>TAN LITTLE INDIANS</p>
        <p>I think I'll never understand</p>
        <p>The ladies, chic and summer-tanned</p>
        <p>Who, complimented thereon in belated</p>
        <p>September tributes, won't concur.</p>
        <p>Instead they'll shrug, protest, demur,</p>
        <p>Insisting loudly, ''But my tan's all faded.''</p>
        <p>Maureen Cannon</p>
        <p>I was visiting a childhood friend, Mike, his wife, Barbara, and their two daughters on a late-summer evening in Spring Lake. The girls had been rambunctious for much of the day, and Mike had confided that he was feeling a bit haggard and irritated.</p>
        <p>As we all stood in line for an Italian ice, a pregnant and radiant young woman strolled by. Enchanted by the girls' apple-cheeked faces, she stopped and cooed at them.</p>
        <p>''You just wait until you have yours,'' Mike muttered as he watched her walk away. ''You'll get your tubes tied up like the Gowanus Expressway.''</p>

        <p>ALL SOCKS DON'T COME IN PAIRS</p>
        <p>I collect lots of unmatched socks,</p>
        <p>While others collect exotic rocks.</p>
        <p>I can't use them in summer and spring,</p>
        <p>But fall and winter are my thing.</p>
        <p>Out come my boots all shiny and new,</p>
        <p>On go my socks, one pink, one blue.</p>
