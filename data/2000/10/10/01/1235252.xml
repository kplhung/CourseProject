        <p>Throughout the 1990's, pension funds and university endowments added to their domestic stock holdings to take advantage of the bull market. Not Yale University.</p>
        <p>In the last decade, Yale sold hundreds of millions of dollars of American stocks. The equities it did buy tended to be value and small-cap stocks, which have been depressed in recent years.</p>
        <p>Yet Yale has come out ahead because the university's chief investment adviser, David Swensen, bet on private equity, hedge and venture capital funds.</p>
        <p>The endowment rose 40 percent in the year ended June 30, to $10 billion. Harvard University's endowment fund returned 32.2 percent during the same period.</p>
        <p>''We've done things differently from the institutional orthodoxy,'' Mr. Swensen said in a recent interview with Bloomberg News.</p>
        <p>Just 25 percent of Yale's money is in plain-vanilla American stocks and bonds, compared with the typical university allocation of 75 percent reported by the National Association of College and University Business Officers.</p>
