        <p>Luc Longley's plans of arriving at Knicks training camp with fresh legs and a new start backfired Friday night when the Australian team's 7-foot center hyperextended his left knee in a semifinal loss to France here at the Olympics.</p>
        <p>Longley, who said he might miss two months of action while rehabilitating the injury, was injured with about seven minutes left in Australia's 76-52 loss to France. Going up for a rebound, he came down awkwardly on the back of a French player's heal and was forced to leave the game.</p>
        <p>He was not expected to play in Sunday's bronze medal game against Lithuania, and his status for Knicks camp, beginning next week in Charleston, S.C., appeared doubtful. Longley was traded to the Knicks in a 12-player, four-team deal nearly two weeks ago that featured Patrick Ewing going to Seattle and Glen Rice and Longley coming to New York.</p>
        <p>''The Knicks doctors have yet to see the M.R.I., but out here they're telling me it's a sprained capsule in the back of my knee,'' Longley said.</p>
        <p>The initial report from Australian team officials was that Longley was expected to miss two to three weeks. But today, the player who helped Michael Jordan's Bulls to three titles in the 1990's said he did not expect to play for about two months.</p>
        <p>''It's very disheartening for a lot of different reasons,'' he said. ''Not playing in the bronze medal game while Australia goes after its first medal in men's basketball really bothers me. I also was looking forward to having a good training camp, meeting all my new mates and fitting in with New York. All that gets pushed back now.''</p>
