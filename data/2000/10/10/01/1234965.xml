        <p>Q After renting an apartment in a midtown co-op for four years, I asked to break my lease. Since the rent was still under the market rent, I thought they would be glad to get rid of me.  However, I was told by the management company that I needed to find someone to sublet the apartment whom they would approve. I did that.  The management company gave that person his own lease for a higher rent and immediately terminated my lease. The apartment was left in impeccable condition. When I received my security back, however, it was about $1,000 less than I expected.  When I called to find out why, I was told that I was being charged for painting the apartment because I broke my lease. Can they do this? . . . Lisa Robin, Manhattan.</p>

        <p>Q After renting an apartment in a midtown co-op for four years, I asked to break my lease. Since the rent was still under the market rent, I thought they would be glad to get rid of me.  However, I was told by the management company that I needed to find someone to sublet the apartment whom they would approve. I did that.  The management company gave that person his own lease for a higher rent and immediately terminated my lease. The apartment was left in impeccable condition. When I received my security back, however, it was about $1,000 less than I expected.  When I called to find out why, I was told that I was being charged for painting the apartment because I broke my lease. Can they do this? . . . Lisa Robin, Manhattan.</p>
        <p>A Jeffrey Ween, a Manhattan landlord-tenant lawyer, said that the management company probably had no right to deduct the cost of painting the apartment from the letter writer's security.</p>
        <p>''The New York City Housing Maintenance Code requires every owner of a dwelling unit in a multiple dwelling to paint an apartment every three years,'' Mr. Ween said. ''So if the apartment had not been painted during the past three years, it was the owner's obligation to do so, not the tenant's.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ween added that if the apartment had been painted within the last three years, and the tenant had done something to make it necessary to repaint the unit, then there might be a possibility that the tenant could be held responsible for a new paint job.</p>
        <p>However, he said, that should have been part of the negotiations between the parties at the time the management company agreed to allow the letter writer to find someone to sublet the apartment. Moreover, Mr. Ween said, since it was the management company, rather than the letter writer, who ultimately terminated the lease -- by offering a new lease to the new tenant -- it would be unlikely that the letter writer could be held responsible for painting the apartment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ween said that the best way for the letter writer to get her money back would be to file a small-claims action against the unit owner in civil court.</p>
        <p>A Bank That Lost Co-op Loan Papers</p>
        <p>Q Last year I paid off the balance of my co-op share loan. The bank informed me that it was unable to remove the lien against my apartment because it had misplaced the stock certificate and proprietary lease and that the co-op would have to replace those documents for it to file the necessary papers.</p>
        <p>The co-op said it would not replace the documents unless the bank posted a lost-instrument bond to protect the co-op. The bank insists that it is not obligated to post such a bond and has, therefore, taken no action. What can I do to resolve this dispute? . . . John Leonard, Forest Hills, N.Y.</p>
        <p>A Aaron Shmulewitz, a Manhattan co-op lawyer, said that most co-op loan documents provide that once a loan is paid in full, the lender must return the original note, the stock certificate and the proprietary lease to the borrower and must file what is known as a UCC-3 Termination of Financing statement with the register of the county where the co-op is situated.</p>
        <p>''The fact that the lender may have misplaced the borrower's stock certificate and proprietary lease is factually and legally unrelated to the lender's obligation to file the Termination of Financing statement,'' Mr. Shmulewitz said.</p>
        <p>At the same time, he said, since the loss of the certificate and lease occurred as a result of the lender's negligence, the lender should provide to the letter writer what is known as an ''affidavit of lost stock and lease.'' That affidavit can then be used by the letter writer to obtain a replacement certificate and lease from the co-op.</p>
        <p>If the co-op continues to insist on a lost-instrument bond, he said, the letter writer would have no option but to post the bond and then sue the lender for the cost of getting the bond.</p>
        <p>A lost-instrument bond is an insurance policy that protects the co-op from future claims should someone find the stock certificate and the lease and fraudulently claim ownership of the apartment. The premium for the bond is usually between 2 and 3 percent of the amount to be insured, usually the value of the apartment.</p>
