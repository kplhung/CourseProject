        <p>WHEN John Hein sees a beautiful piece of wood, he has the urge to frame it like a picture. When he does, the fact that a usable cabinet or table is built in the process is almost beside the point.</p>
        <p>At least it would be, if not for the fact that Mr. Hein marvels at the feel of a curved wooden handle or the swish of a perfectly made door opening and closing almost as much as he loves the look of a gnarled piece of English brown oak or East Indian rosewood.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hein makes $15,000-to-$20,000 cabinets, sideboards and coffee tables in his converted garage next to his home in Hopewell. He has won five Niche Awards, the ''Academy Award'' of American craft, from Niche Magazine, and the Design Encyclopedia included him in its listing of eminent furniture designers, along with such notables as Thomas Chippendale, Gustav Stickley and Frank Lloyd Wright. A cabinet with a subtly curved door was recently given to the Newark Museum's permanent collection and is on display in the Ballantine House galleries.</p>
        <p>It takes Mr. Hein, who works only on commission, 400 to 500 hours over several months to craft each unique piece of furniture. Many pieces start with a single outstanding piece of wood, like a panel of curly maple with blue waves running through it from a fungus that attacked the tree while it was alive.</p>
        <p>Another memorable piece of wood was from the trunk of a 100-year-old English walnut that once had a fence nailed to it. No one else wanted the wood because of the nail marks. Mr. Hein used it to create a dramatic cabinet back that could be viewed through glass doors; the flawed wood became the focal point of the piece.</p>
        <p>''The trees that produce the best wood often suffered terribly in life,'' Mr. Hein said. ''The most beautiful wood is found around areas of decay or disease.''</p>
        <p>The owner of a lumberyard in this semirural area of Mercer County knows what type of wood Mr. Hein wants and saves anything interesting. But sometimes it can take months to obtain just the right piece of wood from some exotic location; he has used wood from, among other places, India, China and Japan.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hein's elegant pieces all have a stark simplicity reminiscent of Shaker furniture with a hint of Oriental styling thrown in. The distinctive look is created by juxtaposing the contrasting colors of different types of wood, like a light oak panel set inside a black walnut frame with a rosewood back and ebony legs.</p>
        <p>''I might use a graphically intense wood like the English walnut for a back to draw your eye into the piece and put that next to a softer, calm color of a pearwood,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The pieces have no metal parts except for hinges. Everything else, including the drawer pulls, is hand-carved wood that is meticulously dovetailed, with room provided for the wood to expand and contract with changes in humidity.</p>
        <p>Each piece is oiled and painstakingly hand-rubbed to bring out the natural color and shine of the wood with no stains or lacquers added.</p>
        <p>''When I build a piece of furniture it is for all time,'' Mr. Hein said.</p>
        <p>He never knows what a piece will look like, although he may be given some dimensions or a preferred type of wood. Other customers just trust his judgment.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes I'll do five or six drawers before one comes out right. For some things, like the drawer pulls, I keep carving until it feels right,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Many of the pieces created by Mr. Hein are cabinets, in part because a cabinet door lets him better display a beautiful piece of wood and because it can easily be raised to eye level.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hein, who says he was all over the place in his studies in college, was a researcher in the rare books archive at Princeton University when he decided he wanted more of a life of his own than living vicariously through the people in books. After researching the art of furnituremaking and settling on a direction he wanted to take, he jumped in with both feet and started his own business.</p>
        <p>Since then, the 45-year-old artist has developed a reputation in the United States, Europe and Japan for creating restrained pieces with a purity of form that emphasizes the aesthetic qualities of the hardwoods he uses.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Hein is the artist in the family, his wife handles the details of the business, which often involves borrowing pieces back from the owners so that he has some to show in exhibitions. He does not own any of his own work.</p>
        <p>Details of Mr. Hein's work, and even of the tools he uses, are shown on his Web site, pluto.njcc.com/jhein.</p>
        <p>''Of all the contemporary crafts, furniture is the one where form is most closely tied to function,'' Mr. Hein said. ''Each of my pieces is made to be used.''</p>
