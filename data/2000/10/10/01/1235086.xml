        <p>Considering its occupant has a big title, the office doesn't have much of a view.</p>
        <p>Rob Burnett looks from his ground-floor window at a cinderblock wall painted several shades of dirty beige. It's certainly not Broadway, where Mr. Burnett has worked the last four years as executive producer of ''Late Show with David Letterman.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Burnett is a Jersey guy and that beige wall is indeed Jersey. Taking leave from his daily Letterman duties, he is the creator and executive producer of ''Ed,'' an hourlong comedy-drama that will be broadcast Sunday nights on NBC starting in October. ''Ed'' is the first major network series in recent memory to be shot primarily in Bergen County.</p>
        <p>''I am not scared to be quoted saying that I love New Jersey,'' Mr. Burnett said, in almost Lettermanic deadpan. He is sitting in his spare office, dotted mostly with videotapes, scripts and an array of relatively healthy snacks: Diet Coke, Diet A&amp;W Root Beer, Fiber One cereal. He said, though, that he is becoming partial to the doughnuts from Trautwein's farm market in Closter. ''Yes, I love New Jersey.''</p>
        <p>''Ed'' provides for a sort of homecoming for Mr. Burnett, who grew up in North Caldwell and attended West Essex High School. He wanted to produce a TV series, but most of them are shot in southern California, far from his Manhattan home. He searched for producing partners that would allow him to do the show in the East, and Viacom offered to team up with Worldwide Pants.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Letterman, whose Worldwide Pants production company produces ''Ed,'' wears high-end suits in front of the cameras, Mr. Burnett is comfortable in the ''Ed'' offices and on the set across Paris Avenue in a Jerseyfied shorts-and-T-shirt ensemble.</p>
        <p>The outfit is one that the show's title character would most likely wear. Ed is a New York lawyer who gets fired for omitting a comma in a brief, costing his firm nearly $2 million. On top of that, his wife leaves him for another man. So Ed (played by Tom Cavanaugh) heads back to a more casual life in Stuckeyville, his small hometown where he spent the best years of his life. He tries, unsuccessfully, to woo his former girlfriend; but he finds joy in buying the town's old bowling alley, and he moves in with his best friend, who is a doctor, and his wife.</p>
        <p>To create all this, Mr. Burnett and his crew have taken over the defunct Country Club Lanes on Paris Avenue, just off the main shopping strip in this village south of the New York State border. Sixteen of the old AMF automatic lanes in the vintage 1950's alley are now the Stuckey Bowl, and the rest of the building is outfitted for stage sets.</p>
        <p>Outdoor scenes are being shot in the nearby towns of Westwood, Ridgewood, Norwood and Old Tappan in Bergen County and at Montclair High School in Essex County. The Runcible Spoon restaurant in nearby Nyack, N.Y., doubles as the pie shop where Ed and his buddies hang out, and Joel's in Ridgewood plays their favorite coffeehouse.</p>
        <p>But for the next several months -- and pending success in the ratings -- Northvale and the old bowling alley, with its kitschy light-turquoise-and-off-white interior, will be the primary ''Ed'' home.</p>
        <p>''I think this will mean great things for the Greek restaurant around the corner,'' Mr. Burnett said, rubbing his stomach as he spoke of the Greek Village on Livingston Street. ''Especially if they keep filling me up with their souvlaki.''</p>
        <p>Mayor John E. Rooney misses Country Club Lanes, where he used to bowl, but he is pleased at the way the ''Ed'' crew has dressed up the place.</p>
        <p>''They have made all the space really usable and maybe, even when the show is finished, we'll be able to have that rented out as a studio,'' said Mr. Rooney, who is also a Republican State Assemblyman from the district. ''We love good, clean industry here and they have been very good to us, buying from local businesses and hiring local tradespeople.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rooney's daughter is a stage manager for ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,''  so he said he is well aware of the needs of the TV business. But he nonetheless declined to take a small part in ''Ed.''</p>
        <p>''I was in Providence recently and the mayor there has appeared in 'Providence,' '' he said, referring to the NBC drama. ''He loves it, but I don't think it's for me.'' So much for his chance to throw out the first bowling ball when the ''Ed'' set opened. He was on vacation.</p>
        <p>Most shows in the East are filmed in Manhattan (''Spin City,'' ''Law and Order'') or on sound stages in Queens (''The Cosby Show,'' ''Sesame Street''). But Mr. Burnett wanted a feel he couldn't get in the city, especially since Stuckeyville is Anytown, U.S.A.</p>
        <p>''Ironically, many of the towns in North Jersey have that Midwestern look we were looking for,'' said Kathy Ciric, ''Ed's'' location manager. ''Northvale especially has a lot of buildings from the 1920's and a little later, which is great for us. There are no Kmarts and, on the other hand, not all that many Victorians.''</p>
        <p>Outside Northvale, Ms. Ciric has found other venues she loves. Ridgewood's town square has a Midwestern feel, said Ms. Ciric, and ''Montclair High School has a gorgeous campus.''</p>
        <p>''It looks like an idealized 1950's, which is important since Ed wants to drift back to his idealized past,'' she said. But the house Ed lives in with his friend is actually in the nearby town of Old Tappan.</p>
        <p>''It has a lemonade porch with a wonderful overhang and a rail around it,'' she enthused. ''You just can't resist sitting on that porch and rocking the day away.''</p>
        <p>Of course, HBO's ''The Sopranos'' has put its own spin on North Jersey scenery, which the ''Ed'' folks appreciate, but will not emulate.</p>
        <p>''We are not looking for gritty, like 'Sopranos,' '' Mr. Burnett said. ''We'll have that other New Jersey, the one no one seems to know.''</p>
        <p>It is important for the ''Ed'' crew to stay within 30 miles of Manhattan, said the show's supervising producer, Kathy McGill, since union rules require extra travel payments if shooting is farther away.</p>
        <p>''And, God willing, we will still be shooting in the winter,'' Ms. McGill said. ''There is a richness to that you don't find in sunny California. And we think that will enhance the show.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Burnett said the scripts, too, should give knowing viewers a New Jersey feeling, even if Stuckeyville is not in any particular state.</p>
        <p>''When I write, I'm thinking of the North Caldwell of my teenage years,'' he said.  ''It's a New Jersey that is good-looking, that is a great place to be. Those people who think otherwise, well, they have probably just been on the Turnpike, so they just don't know. It's a place where you can smell the trees at night and listen to the cicadas.''</p>
        <p>And eat some really good souvlaki and doughnuts.</p>
