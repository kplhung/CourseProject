        <p>It's a class thing, some students say. Then there is the distance.</p>
        <p>The newest addition to the Princeton University campus stands camouflaged behind a cement facade -- all five levels, 185,000 square feet, all $48 million worth.</p>
        <p>But for a campus center, the Frist is something of a lonely place. For one thing, the center is hardly central, since the library and most of the dormitories are clustered in the northern and western portions of campus, away from the center.</p>
        <p>Jarrod Grover, a freshman who works at the center's souvenir shop, said that he had seen surprisingly few students. ''I don't think that it has caught on yet,'' Mr. Grover said. ''I've seen more nonstudents than students come through here.''</p>
        <p>Designed by the architect Robert Venturi of Venturi, Scott Brown and Associates, who received his undergraduate degree here in 1947 and a master's in fine arts in 1950, the center is a melding of the historic Palmer Hall -- where Einstein frequently worked -- with a modern addition that features a solid face of windows to the south and a detached facade to the north.</p>
        <p>Princeton is one of the many Ivy League universities that have focused attention on student centers in recent years. Mr. Venturi's firm designed Harvard's Memorial Hall, completed in 1995, and the Perelman Quadrangle at the University of Pennsylvania, which opened this fall. At Columbia, Lerner Hall opened last year, and the Collis Center at Dartmouth -- first opened in 1901 -- was renovated and expanded in 1994.</p>
        <p>Despite the undergraduate view here, the director of Frist, Paul Breitman, said the center, which took seven years to plan and two more years to build has been ''busy and packed ever since.''</p>
        <p>Much like the building itself, Spencer Merriweather, a former student government president who is the newest member of the board of trustees, tried gracefully to blend the two views. ''We have never had anything this size before,'' Mr. Merriweather said. ''This is essentially oversize for us, but maybe we do have some room to grow. It's only a matter of time before this thing blossoms.''</p>
        <p>In the meantime, it is a period of adjustment.</p>
        <p>''I think that it's cold and makes that part of campus look uninviting,'' said Amy Anderson, a senior majoring in architecture.</p>
        <p>Adriel Mesznik, another senior majoring in architecture, put it this way: ''A lot of this place looks like it's not done yet, and I don't know how much is actually not finished yet, but I have a feeling that a lot will look permanently unfinished.''</p>
        <p>As for the center's exterior, Mr. Mesznik said the detached facade created a ''dead zone'' or ''no-man's land,'' adding that he felt the contrast between old and new destroyed continuity within the building.</p>
        <p>Scoffing at the criticism, Mr. Venturi said, ''We're in an era where everyone gets thrilled out of criticizing everything.''</p>
        <p>As for the thrust of remarks like that of Mr. Meznik, he said, ''There is continuity, but also a contrast between old and new, which is fun and good and romantic and inevitable.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Venturi said that ''like a village with a lot of variety, that variety does not make for an obvious unity. Down with unity.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Grover, who works in the center, noted that the cafe and beverage laboratory -- which will serve alcohol if it obtains a liquor license from the state -- are out of view from the first-floor entrance. ''Once you're there, it's like any other coffee shop,'' he said. ''But the chance that you'll find a friend there is slim.''</p>
        <p>If the entire campus center has not caught on yet, the basement cafeteria has. During the week it has been crowded, especially around lunchtime.</p>
        <p>''Once the clock strikes 12 forget it,'' said Vickie Mate, who works the deli counter.</p>
        <p>To that end, some on campus say Princeton may be fulfilling one unstated purpose -- tempering the influence of the well-known eating clubs that line Prospect Street just to east of the center.</p>
        <p>But Justin Nyberg, a senior who belongs to the Ivy Club, the oldest club on the street, said, ''It will never replace them, but it will be a nice supplement.''</p>
        <p>In addition to the classrooms and eating facilities, there is a 241-seater movie theater  that has been attracting sizable audiences.</p>
        <p>The university is not only pulling students and visitors in the direction of Frist, but pushing them that way too. This fall the school tour begins and ends at the campus center instead of the historic Nassau Hall.</p>
        <p>''It was designed so it would be part of the circulation system of campus as a whole,'' Mr. Venturi said. ''It is a building with a series of entrances that is very open and more communal.''</p>
        <p>And despite some minor glitches, the center offered what one senior, Greg Mancini, termed the first ''democratic space'' on campus that students wanted -- even if it took some getting used to.</p>
        <p>''To us it's something very foreign,'' said Mr. Mancini. ''Our social space is already constructed. The kids who will really show you what this place means to Princeton are the freshmen and sophomores. To them this isn't new, it's a part of Princeton also.''</p>
