        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In his review of Michael A. Bellesiles's ''Arming America'' (Sept. 10), Garry Wills accepts the book's ludicrous argument, which dismisses the use of firearms in America from early times.</p>
        <p>At first, guns were indeed rare and unreliable. The need, however, was undeniable. You can't kill a deer with a sharp stick, and it's all but impossible to bring down a rabbit with a thrown stone. The early muskets were improved, but not soon. The ''embattled farmers'' who fired ''the shot heard round the world'' were underequipped, but they sure were better shots than the Brits. It took them seven years, underfed, frostbitten and underarmed, but in the end they defeated the finest army in the world. They didn't do it with pocket knives.</p>
        <p>As for those wise old dead white guys who invented our country, it may well be that the creation of the United States was the most important event since the founding of the Roman Republic. If you accept this, as I assume most Americans would, then follow the trail of revolution: the next was the French Revolution, dissolving almost at once into the bloody Terror, succeeded in turn by the dictatorship of Napoleon, followed in time by the equally bloody dictatorships of Stalin, Mussolini, Hitler (the last two elected democratically), Mao Zedong, Fidel Castro, Pol Pot and Laurent Kabila. The first act of each of these bloody-handed tyrants on taking power was to confiscate all privately held firearms. Perhaps that will give Wills pause.</p>
        <p>He is correct in saying that the Civil War brought immense improvement in the design and quality of guns (from cannons to pistols). The Confederates tended to be better shots, but the Union troops improved throughout the war, and of course had better weaponry and equipment over all. The Plains Indians were subdued after the war by cavalrymen, even better armed than they'd been in the Civil War.</p>
        <p>I was raised in the Depression in northern Michigan in a hamlet of a dozen or so families. Most of the men had no jobs, but every house had five or more guns to feed their families. Along with the other boys, I was taught early how to handle a gun properly and bring home food for the pot. I'm proud I was able to do my share. There was never any sort of armed confrontation, of course, nor was any home ever burglarized, no door ever locked. Different times, different people?</p>
