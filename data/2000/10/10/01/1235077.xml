        <p>The two 1893 facades of the onetime Public School 35, which a neighborhood coalition successfully fought to preserve, are to form a four-story Romanesque Revival base around the Beekman Regent, a new 19-story luxury condominium at 351 East 51st Street scheduled to be completed next summer.</p>

        <p>The two 1893 facades of the onetime Public School 35, which a neighborhood coalition successfully fought to preserve, are to form a four-story Romanesque Revival base around the Beekman Regent, a new 19-story luxury condominium at 351 East 51st Street scheduled to be completed next summer.</p>
        <p>''This is what the community worked for over the past two decades,'' said Carol Pieper, district manager of Community Board 6.</p>
        <p>The schoolhouse's brick, granite and sandstone facades, sawed away from the now-vanished interior, have been braced in place by steel girders at the corner of First Avenue in recent months. The school building was designed by George W. Debevoise, the architect for the Board of Education. Over the years it also housed, in succession, P.S. 135, the United Nations School and a women's homeless shelter.</p>
        <p>''It's rare to offer so many different types of apartments in one project,'' said Dennis A. Herman, the principal of Beekman International Center, which developed the 64-unit condominium to feature four apartment styles.</p>
        <p>The developer bought the building for $8.5 million, including taxes, from the city's Economic Development Corporation last year. He said development costs are to exceed $100 million.</p>
        <p>With four elevators and sterling silver master bathroom fixtures, the Beekman Regent is to have 10 lofts, five duplexes with terraces, 18 upper-floor apartments with terraces or balconies and 30 single-level apartments based on prewar layouts.</p>
        <p>''It's a very elaborate project, not a straight up and down tower,'' said Costas Kondylis, the architect, who also designed the 856-foot-high Trump World Tower, three blocks south of the project.</p>
        <p>The 15 new stories of wine-colored brick at the Beekman Regent are to blend in with the brownstone detail of the existing four-story buff color brick facades -- now a 70-foot-high hurdle for a crane hoisting concrete and reinforcing bars, said Lori Levine, the developer's project manager.</p>
        <p>Lofts, priced from $2.553 million to $5.072 million, are to be on the upper two floors of the old facades, and will have 14- and 16-foot-high ceilings and 10-foot-high arched windows. Duplexes with terraces, priced from $3.4 million to $6.782 million, are to occupy the next two floors. A 799-square-foot one-bedroom apartment, to be available for $719,000, can be combined with an apartment on the upper duplex level.</p>
        <p>Single-level apartments, from $726,000 to $1.776 million, are to be on the six floors atop the  duplexes. The high-floor apartments, priced from $2.087 million to $11.182 for a penthouse duplex with rooftop terrace and five fireplaces, are to be in the top eight floors of the building.</p>
        <p>Behind the old facade are to be a lobby and  mezzanine garage. A restaurant is being sought for a 9,900-square-foot retail space.</p>
