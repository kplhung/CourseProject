        <p>PaineWebber has named its own price for Priceline.com, and it is a mere fraction of the previous target.</p>
        <p>Priceline, which asks users to bid on products and services, warned last week that its third-quarter revenue would fall below market expectations because of weak airline ticket sales. But PaineWebber has maintained its ''buy'' recommendation on the stock. Only now, its 12-month target price is $15, down from $125. It closed on Friday at $11.88.</p>
