        <p>ALEXIS DE TOCQUEVILLE, the French historian and philosopher, visited the young United States in the early 1830's and wrote ''Democracy in America,'' concluding that the democratic system would indeed survive for the long term.</p>
        <p>''It was a revolutionary idea at the time,'' said Jean-Pierre Conreur, who runs the $35.4 million Tocqueville Small Cap Value fund. ''The name implies contrarian thinking. It's like our value investing style, which is based on the belief that the majority is usually wrong.''</p>
        <p>That perspective has paid off for investors, even in the bull market. The fund has returned 12.9 percent a year, on average, for the three years ended on Sept. 28, compared with 6.6 percent for its peers in the small blend category of funds, according to Morningstar Inc.</p>
        <p>In choosing the 35 or so stocks for the fund, Mr. Conreur, 62, trolls the bottom of the market, looking for undervalued companies with market capitalizations of $250 million to $1 billion.</p>
        <p>''I look at companies that all the Wall Street analysts have given up on,'' he said in a thick French accent, despite his 44 years in the United States, mostly in New York. ''They are ignored for very good reasons -- like the company missed its projected earnings or is in the midst of a product line transition or a deep cyclical downturn.''</p>
        <p>The companies he chooses are  typically down 60 to 80 percent from their five-year highs -- and there are many such stocks from which to choose in a volatile market. ''The market is driven by earnings and price momentum,'' he said. ''As a result, we get extreme valuations on the upside and on the downside.''</p>
        <p>He uses three computer screens. The first looks for companies whose stocks are selling near 52-week lows. Then comes a search for price-to-sales multiples that are near their lows of the last 5 or 10 years; the companies in the portfolio sell for just one times their annual revenue, on average.</p>
        <p>''Because the American economy has been booming over the last 12 years, many companies have extraordinarily high profit margins, which translate into very high price-sales ratios,'' Mr. Conreur said. ''If anything happens to those margins, stock prices will collapse.''</p>
        <p>Finally, he screens the usual financial data, including long-term debt, accounts payable and receivable and reinvestment in the business. ''We're checking to see that a company's short-term problems don't affect its long-term picture,'' he said.</p>
        <p>MR. CONREUR works with three industry analysts to evaluate whether a company can return at least triple his investment over the next three to five years. They ask questions of company management, to learn whether a business plan is in place to fix problems over the next year or so. Then they monitor the plan's progress to make sure that the company does not shift gears midway.</p>
        <p>The analysts also check to see if, as Mr. Conreur puts it, ''the company is losing money for the right reasons,'' like heavy investments in research and development or new equipment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Conreur sells stock when its valuation triples or quadruples or when insiders dump a big block of shares.</p>
        <p>His biggest holding is Input/Output of Stafford, Tex., one of the largest American makers of seismic equipment used in oil and gas exploration, primarily on land. Its stock price fell from $40 in 1998 to $5.33 in October 1999, when he first bought shares. Mr. Conreur attributes the drop to the collapse in oil and gas prices last year, which caused a drastic cutback in exploration equipment purchases by major oil companies. While prices have since shot up, companies have not yet made major investments in needed exploration equipment, he said. But that is  ''just a matter of time,'' he added.</p>
        <p>The shares closed on Friday at $9.63, or 160 times consensus earnings estimates of 6 cents a share for the fiscal year ending next May.</p>
        <p>Mr. Conreur also likes Anixter International of Skokie, Ill., the former distribution arm of AT&amp;T. He expects sales of its telecommunications equipment to grow over the next few years, ''because many businesses and buildings must be rewired to deliver new high-speed communications networks to small businesses.'' Anixter's share price fell after it missed several quarters' earnings projections following the 1998 Asian economic crisis; the fund bought shares in October 1998 at $14.50; they are now at $14.75 or six times Wall Street earnings projections of $2.45 a share for 2001.</p>
        <p>''Wall Street is waking up a little bit to the stock,'' he said, ''but it still sells for a modest multiple.''</p>
        <p>Another holding is Henry Schein Inc. of Melville, N.Y., which was the second-largest distributor of dental supplies until 1997, when it acquired Sullivan Dental, the third-largest, and jumped to first. Because the acquisition was difficult to integrate, the company missed its earnings projections in 1999.</p>
        <p>''Talks with management convinced us that the integration problems were being resolved,'' Mr. Conreur said, ''and it should become a growth business again over the next year or so.''</p>
        <p>The fund bought shares in August 1999 at $11.47; they closed on Friday at $19.94 or 10.6 times the consensus earnings estimate of $1.87 a share for 2001.</p>
