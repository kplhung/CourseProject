        <p>Randall Godfrey was a Dallas Cowboys linebacker for the last four seasons, and he played against the Giants twice a year. When Godfrey jumped as a free agent to the Tennessee Titans last Feb. 16, he left behind the National Football Conference Eastern Division and those annual Cowboys-Giants rivalries.</p>
        <p>But because the Giants play the Tennessee Titans here on Sunday, Godfrey will see the Giants again. Yet, he said, he hardly recognizes them.</p>
        <p>''This is a totally new Giants offense,'' Godfrey said after a week of video preparation. ''It is a more wide-open offense that features Tiki Barber. Ron Dayne gives them that 1-2 punch and power-running. There is a lot more shifting than I've seen before. I am familiar with most of the personnel, just not the scheme.''</p>
        <p>Titans safety Marcus Robertson said: ''Tiki is the wild card in their offense. Amani Toomer is a solid receiver, but it looks like to me that they want to get the ball into Ike Hilliard's hands. They line him up more in the slot and they are looking for him for more change of direction after the catch and for longer runs after the catch.''</p>
        <p>Tennessee (2-1) sees a Giants offense that often looked cutting edge in the Giants' 3-0 start -- and then looked confused and timid before being squashed by the Washington Redskins' defense last Sunday night in a 16-6 loss.</p>
        <p>''Hmm,'' Tennessee defensive end Jevone Kearse said. ''And that was in their own stadium, right? Maybe we can take some of what Washington did and put our own special spin on it.''</p>
        <p>That would mean a wide-open, aggressive defensive assault that is juiced by nearly 69,000 wild fans in Adelphia Coliseum who create as much ruckus as any group anywhere in the National Football League.</p>
        <p>As good as the Washington defense was, the Titans' defense is probably better.</p>
        <p>Giants beware.</p>
        <p>''One of the reasons I came here is because they played defense with a young and hungry style, and that's what I'm all about,'' Godfrey said. ''A lot of times in free agency your best offer comes from bad teams with bad defenses. I was lucky to come to a team that was in the Super Bowl last year. They blitz me a lot more here than Dallas did, and I use my speed to cover more backs and tight ends.''</p>
        <p>Godfrey is one of only two new starters (linebacker Greg Favors is the other) on Tennessee's defense. It is a four-lineman, three-linebacker front with swift cornerbacks and punishing hitters as safeties.</p>
        <p>Kearse is the star among the linemen, Eddie Robinson is the seasoned linebacker, and the secondary -- cornerbacks Samari Rolle and Denard Walker and safeties Robertson and Blaine Bishop -- form an enviable quartet.</p>
        <p>This defense ranks 10th in the league -- 15th against the run (allowing 102 yards a game) and fifth against the pass (allowing 171 yards a game). Tennessee has not intercepted a pass this season, but it has 11 sacks, 3 more than it had through 3 games a year ago. Only once in its last 23 games has it allowed a running back to gain 100 yards in a game. Priest Holmes of the Baltimore Ravens accomplished that late last season, but the string of backs denied includes Marshall Faulk, Fred Taylor, Robert Smith, Charlie Garner, and Corey Dillon and Jerome Bettis, twice each.</p>
        <p>It is a defense infused with speed. The focus is for each defender to run forcefully to the ball. It blitzes in an all-out, hit-and-miss style. This defense intends on hitting you before you hit it.</p>
        <p>It loves to force an offensive player to sit out a play or two because of a ferocious hit. It is relentless in pursuit -- for example, do not be surprised to find Tennessee linemen 15 to 20 yards downfield involved in tackles. The lighter-weight defensive ends attempt to hit, gain separation and then speed upfield. Rolle often takes the best receiver and locks him in man coverage. Bishop is a rock in run support, creeping up, dispensing nasty blows and then trash-talking the fallen ballcarrier.</p>
        <p>Tennessee's defense can be compared with Tampa Bay's, which is widely considered the best in today's pro game. As in Tampa Bay, when the Tennessee defense is on the field in front of its home crowd, it energizes the atmosphere as much as any offense does.</p>
        <p>Kearse is a prime factor.</p>
        <p>Last season as a rookie -- the 16th pick in the draft -- he led the American Football Conference in sacks with 14.5. He was the defensive rookie of the year, played in the Super Bowl and a week later played in the Pro Bowl. He began this season with 14 tackles in Tennessee's loss at Buffalo. Last Sunday, when Tennessee won at Pittsburgh, 23-20, Kearse did not have a sack, ending his N.F.L-record string of 12 games with at least half a sack. He has 1.5 sacks this season and a team-high 18 solo tackles.</p>
        <p>''I started out fast last year and it was all desire and wanting to show people there was no way I should have been drafted that low,'' Kearse said. ''When I got to the Pro Bowl and realized there were only three other defensive ends on the A.F.C. team, that was when I realized what I had accomplished. Now I see a lot of respect. They chip and double- and triple-team me. Quarterbacks are looking for me.''</p>
        <p>So Kearse is helping to create chances for big plays by his teammates.</p>
        <p>While the Tennessee offense searches for continuity, the defense  is the strength, especially in the Titans' new stadium, where they have not lost in the nine games .</p>
        <p>Tennessee opened the season with three consecutive 3-point games and the aggregate score is only 53-50 in the Titans' favor.</p>
        <p>''Our defense rallies for our offense and it rallies to the ball,'' Kearse said. ''We know we can win with our defense.''</p>
