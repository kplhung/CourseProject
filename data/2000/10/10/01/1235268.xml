        <p>Investors hope that it's over now -- the punishing string of earnings warnings that has relentlessly pushed down stocks, especially the high-wire technology stocks. Apple, Intel, Sprint, Eastman Kodak, UAL and a host of other big names announced that they would disappoint Wall Street as the third quarter closed.</p>
        <p>Will the fourth quarter be any kinder? Many analysts look for a rebound by year's end, but others fear that the economy may not have such a soft landing after all, that computer sales growth will falter and that Wall Street's wall of worry may be harder to climb.</p>
        <p>''It's just a continuation of what we've seen since Labor Day,'' said John Shaughnessy, chief investment strategist at Advest. ''This is a combination of the concerns about third-quarter earnings reports, the implications of rising oil prices for the economy and corporate profit, and the implications of the weak euro.''</p>
        <p>The Dow Jones industrials fell 5 percent for the month, the Nasdaq composite lost 12.7 percent and the S. &amp; P. 500 slipped 5.4 percent in September.</p>
        <p>There was relief that September had ended and hope for an upswing in October. But the pessimists pointed out that it can be a harsh month for stocks: Big market drops have a way of happening in October.</p>
