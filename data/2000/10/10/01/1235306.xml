        <p>Gov. George W. Bush told an annual conference of the Christian Coalition today that the country needed to place more value on ''the life of the unborn'' and that he would sign a law to ban late-term abortions.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Bush added that ''good people disagree'' on the abortion issue, and he did not mention the Food and Drug Administration's decision this week to approve the use of the abortion-inducing drug mifepristone, which was opposed by many conservative Christians.</p>
        <p>''Should I be elected, I will lead our nation toward a culture that values life -- the life of the elderly and the sick, the life of the young and the life of the unborn,'' Mr. Bush said in videotaped remarks that were played tonight at the Christian Coalition's conference in Washington. Mr. Bush was at his ranch near Waco.</p>
        <p>''I know good people disagree on this issue, but surely we can agree on ways to value life by promoting adoption and parental notification,'' Mr. Bush continued. ''And when Congress sends me a bill against partial-birth abortion, I will sign it into law.''</p>
        <p>It was the same tempered language that Mr. Bush typically uses to discuss abortion, which he opposes except in cases of rape, incest or risk to a pregnant woman's life. He has said that he would support a constitutional amendment to outlaw abortion if it included those exceptions.</p>
        <p>But the fact that he did not ratchet up his oratory for an audience that surely would have appreciated it seemed to reflect the delicacy of his dance with religious conservatives. They are an important part of his  base, but to win the presidency, Mr. Bush must appeal to moderate Republicans and independents, many of whom support abortion rights.</p>
        <p>Although his father, President George Bush, addressed the group in 1992 and Bob Dole did so in 1996, the Bush campaign had said earlier that Mr. Bush had no plans to speak to the conference. Aides said he would be busy with debate preparations.</p>
        <p>But after some Christian conservatives criticized that decision and warned that Mr. Bush should not take religious conservatives for granted, the campaign announced that Mr. Bush would videotape remarks to be played to the group.</p>
        <p>Governor Bush told the audience: ''I need your help. This may be the closest election in 40 years. That means every day will count. Every vote will count.''</p>
