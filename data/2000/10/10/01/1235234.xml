        <p>Last Thursday in Lower Manhattan, the group invited women to speak about life after Goldman.

        <p>Last Thursday in Lower Manhattan, the group invited women to speak about life after Goldman. Ilona Nemeth is now the director of financial communications at DoubleClick, and Natalya Smith is the chief financial officer at Colleges.com. Mandee Heller and Tamara King founded HerDollar.com, which they expect to sell to a large financial services firm; they acknowledged sleeping in airports to save money.</p>
        <p>Others remain on Wall Street. Jessica Palmer, who joined Goldman in 1976 and described herself as one of the few women ''still left standing,'' has risen to a senior position at Salomon Smith Barney. Janet Tiebout Hanson, who founded 85 Broads, started a money management firm, Milestone Capital Management. Susan Payne heads Emergent Asset Management in England. There were even some current Goldman employees there, including Nomi Ghez, a managing director.</p>
        <p>The only man to speak was probably the alumnus trying hardest to prove there is life after Goldman: Jon S. Corzine, former co-chairman and now a Senate candidate. Saying he still checked the stock pages, he assured the crowd, ''I haven't given up on capitalism.'' Proving his point, he quoted the price of Goldman stock.  But, he said, he liked it better at its all-time high of around $130.</p>
