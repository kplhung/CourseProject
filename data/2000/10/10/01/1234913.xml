        <p>The Collected Poems</p>
        <p>By Stanley Kunitz.</p>

        <p>NEXT week, Stanley Kunitz will take office as poet laureate of the United States. In July, he turned 95. His ''Collected Poems'' affirms his stature as perhaps the most distinguished living American poet. It's been a long haul for Kunitz. He was born and grew up in Worcester, Mass., where his father committed suicide six weeks before he was born -- an event the poems often allude to. He attended Harvard on a scholarship, graduated summa cum laude, earned a master's in English and assumed he'd stay on as a teaching assistant. But it was made known to him -- how one wishes one could recapture that delicate 1920's conversation -- that Anglo-Saxon students might resent being taught English by a Jew. So he worked for 20 years as a newspaperman, farmer and editor. He made a small splash in 1927 with his first book of poems, ''Intellectual Things,'' but then more or less disappeared from the literary scene. His second and weakest book came out during World War II and was little noticed. By the time of his third, ''Selected Poems, 1928-1958,'' he was already in his 50's and sufficiently obscure for eight publishers to turn it down. Atlantic Monthly Press gambled on it and it won the Pulitzer Prize. Ever since, Kunitz has been a presence in American culture and a mentor to younger poets. He divides his time between New York and Provincetown, Mass., where he maintains an elaborate terraced garden that often insinuates itself into his work.</p>
        <p>What makes this collection of a lifetime's work so valuable is the way it allows us to perceive the interconnectedness of all Kunitz has written. Each poem stands alone, but each also enriches the others. Take, for an example, ''The Wellfleet Whale,'' perhaps Kunitz's best-known poem. On the surface, it's a simple account of an actual event, the beaching and death of a whale on Cape Cod. Only on rereading do we notice the undercurrents of meaning, and then the many interconnections with other Kunitz poems. The poem begins with the sounds whales make:</p>
        <p>You have your language too,</p>
        <p>an eerie medley of clicks</p>
        <p>and hoots and trills,</p>
        <p>location-notes and love calls.</p>
        <p>Kunitz is identifying with the whale, comparing its language to his own as a poet. That observation leads us to recall a much earlier work, ''Ambergris,'' where the entire poem -- influenced by Donne and the metaphysicals -- is an extended metaphor comparing a whale and the poet. ''Ambergris'' ends:</p>
        <p>from my mammoth, cold, and featureless</p>
        <p>Event of age, my enemies will flee,</p>
        <p>Whereas my friends will stay and pillage me.</p>
        <p>Reading this, we remember that the crowds that gather at Wellfleet on Cape Cod also pillage the whale. They carve initials on it. And then we remember that in a poem from his middle period, ''The Testing-Tree,'' the boy Kunitz seeks</p>
        <p>the inexhaustible oak,</p>
        <p>tyrant and target,</p>
        <p>Jehovah of acorns</p>
        <p>-- a tree the boy regards as magical, at which he throws stones and in which he carves his initials. Tree and whale resemble each other as archetypal emblems -- Jehovah-like or, in the case of the whale, Christlike:</p>
        <p>Toward dawn we shared with you</p>
        <p>your hour of desolation,</p>
        <p>the huge lingering passion</p>
        <p>of your unearthly outcry.</p>
        <p>The pursuit of such interweavings makes of this book one long poem, in which symbols and themes recur in different contexts. An avowed Jungian, Kunitz once wrote: ''The imagination is a deep-sea diver that rakes the bottom of the poet's mind and dredges up sleeping images. . . .+If we go deep enough, we may discover the secret place where our key images have been stored since childhood.'' He believes poems exist before you know them: ''Even before it is ready to change into language, a poem may begin to assert its buried life in the mind with wordless surges of rhythm and counterrhythm.''</p>
        <p>Another reward for having all Kunitz's poetry together in this book is that it lets us watch the quest of a poet in search of his true voice. The early poems lack it. They're intellectual and dense: sometimes you crack the code, sometimes not. They're tightly rhymed and metered in a way that sometimes feels by-the-numbers. But as time goes on, the Kunitz voice emerges. The later poems are the best -- how rare this is in a lyric poet -- composed in simple relaxed English, usually in loose three-beat lines, without rhymes but with inner music. They are clear on the surface, with much going on down below. Perhaps the only blemish is an occasional tendency, after the real poem is over, to add a few words or lines to raise it to some epigrammatic epiphany it hasn't fully earned.</p>
        <p>The major poems nearly always embody large statements, open or implied, about birth and death and the cosmos. This is Kunitz in his high oracular mode. But he is a master too of slighter lyrics, usually stirred by memories of his own life. Here is one of these, a poem to his sisters, both of whom died young. From its late-Yeatsian chorus at the beginning to its gentle apostrophe at the end, ''My Sisters'' is perfect. Note the key rhymes: tears, fears, dears -- implying, perhaps, a missing ''years.''</p>
        <p>Who whispered, souls have shapes?</p>
        <p>So has the wind, I say.</p>
        <p>But I don't know,</p>
        <p>I only feel things blow.</p>
        <p>I had two sisters once</p>
        <p>with long black hair</p>
        <p>who walked apart from me</p>
        <p>and wrote the history of tears.</p>
        <p>Their story's faded with their names,</p>
        <p>but the candlelight they carried,</p>
        <p>like dancers in a dream,</p>
        <p>still flickers on their gowns</p>
        <p>as they bend over me</p>
        <p>to comfort my night-fears.</p>
        <p>Let nothing grieve you,</p>
        <p>Sarah and Sophia.</p>
        <p>Shush, shush, my dears,</p>
        <p>now and forever.</p>
