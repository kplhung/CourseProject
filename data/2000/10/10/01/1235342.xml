        <p>Michael Vick had not put up the statistics that matched the superlatives he inspired before the season. He knew it, and it frustrated him. Today, he demonstrated what a quarterback can accomplish when he is angry and determined. Unstoppable.</p>
        <p>Consider this: 210 yards gained on the ground. Three running touchdowns, the last an 82-yard Houdini act in the fourth quarter. A staple of pirouettes that turned sacks into long gains and electric glides around end that ended in the end zone. Or the five Boston College defenders he carried over the goal line on one play. Or the fact that his coach, Frank Beamer, asked, ''Jiminy whiz, how does he do that?'' as he stood on the sidelines.</p>

        <p>Michael Vick had not put up the statistics that matched the superlatives he inspired before the season. He knew it, and it frustrated him. Today, he demonstrated what a quarterback can accomplish when he is angry and determined. Unstoppable.</p>
        <p>Consider this: 210 yards gained on the ground. Three running touchdowns, the last an 82-yard Houdini act in the fourth quarter. A staple of pirouettes that turned sacks into long gains and electric glides around end that ended in the end zone. Or the five Boston College defenders he carried over the goal line on one play. Or the fact that his coach, Frank Beamer, asked, ''Jiminy whiz, how does he do that?'' as he stood on the sidelines.</p>
        <p>Still, Vick's spectacular one-man show in leading No. 4-ranked Virginia Tech over Boston College, 48-34, did not erase the memory of his spotty passing performance.</p>
        <p>''I did some things today that I'm still upset about,'' he said, referring to his 5-of-17 passing for 61 yards and one interception. ''I should have made the throws. Instead I had to turn to the second element of my game, which is my running.''</p>
        <p>One-dimensional or not, Vick put up a performance that will likely be featured prominently on his December highlight reel when the Heisman Trophy candidates are whittled down to a few.</p>
        <p>Only briefly in the first quarter, when the Eagles scored back-to-back touchdowns to tie the score at 14-14, did the 44,500 here in Alumni Stadium believe that a tight football game might actually threaten to take precedence over a virtuoso individual performance. The Eagles (2-2, 0-2 in the Big East) were out-gained by Virginia Tech (4-0, 2-0) 481 yards to 287 and were, they admitted, merely supporting players in Vick's dazzling show -- flawed and all.</p>
        <p>''I've never seen anything like him,'' said Boston College defensive back Lenny Walls, who did better than most of his teammates against Vick, picking him off once inside the Hokie 10-yard line. ''I guess he's one of a kind.''</p>
        <p>But Walls was talking about what it felt like to be the last guy chasing Vick on his 82-yard touchdown run in the fourth quarter.</p>
        <p>It was third down and 12 on the Hokie 18-yard line when the Eagles blitzed Vick. Safety Ralph Parent appeared to have a bead on him. Instead, Vick sidestepped him, tiptoed into the line of scrimmage, where he hopped over two more would-be tacklers, then rocketed out to the left side of the field. Walls was giving chase; he headed Vick back to the middle of the field at about the 10-yard line. They squared off then, but with an exaggerated goose step, Vick blew by him to the end zone.</p>
        <p>The memory of the run was the one thing that gave the quarterback reason to smile.</p>
        <p>''It was a blitz and they had man-to-man coverage,'' said Vick, who also fumbled once. ''I couldn't get the ball out, and then the middle opened up for me. The rest was just me being me.''</p>
        <p>Part of Vick being Vick was the game-long struggle to keep his head when the Hokie offense was far from running smoothly.</p>
        <p>The Hokie receivers dropped passes; Vick threw the ball inside when they cut outside and vice versa; and the blitzing Eagle defense did get hard shots on him, including one in the first half that bruised his left knee.</p>
        <p>Vick's body language reflected his frustration. His shoulders slumped, he slapped the turf and, after throwing an option pitch to a running back who wasn't behind him, he slouched off the field with an animated escort from offensive tackle Anthony Lambo.</p>
        <p>The fumble, late in the first half, set up a Boston College touchdown and closed the gap to 28-20.</p>
        <p>''He was pretty ticked and was getting frustrated because he didn't think he was doing anything right,'' said Lambo, whose efficient blocking was one of the reasons Virginia Tech running back Lee Suggs was able to gain 145 yards and run for two touchdowns.</p>
        <p>''I told him to clear his mind and go on to the next play and we'd be fine,'' Lambo added.</p>
        <p>The next time Virginia Tech got the ball, Vick led a nine play, 59-yard drive that ended with his carrying five Eagle defenders the last 3 yards of an 11-yard touchdown run.</p>
        <p>It was those feats that made Beamer at once marvel and explain the impact of his quarterback on the team.</p>
        <p>''Our No. 7 does some sensational things out there,'' Beamer said. ''We have two plays, the one we call and the one he turns into something else. His ability to ad lib is amazing, and if he gets a step, nobody is going to catch him. Some of the mistakes he made today, he'll be a better quarterback for.''</p>
        <p>Vick agreed, and afterward made a promise. It wasn't meant to be scary to future opponents, but it couldn't help but be. He wanted to watch film, work on his reads and take extra throwing practice this week.</p>
        <p>''I'll bounce back next week,'' he said, deadly serious. ''You can count on it. You can count on it.''</p>
