        <p>Two centuries of stunning advances in communications and information technology have brought humanity at last to this. It is now possible, with a few clicks on your Web-enabled cellular phone or hand-held digital assistant, to instantly obtain a map of the shortest route from wherever you are in the world to the nearest Godiva Chocolatier outlet.</p>
        <p>The software to perform this miracle was announced last week by Godiva and Fry Multimedia, an e-business development company in Ann Arbor, Mich., that helped Godiva create its five-year-old Web site, Godiva.com. The underlying technology for the system, made by Ecliptic Systems of Palo Alto, Calif., has a lot to keep track of -- 232 Godiva retail shops and 2,500 Godiva counters in department and specialty stores.</p>

        <p>Perhaps ominously for consumers of what many regard as a guilty indulgence, the announcement also said Godiva now ''has the flexibility to expand wireless offerings that leverage knowledge of individual consumers'' -- in other words, their computer may soon know if you've been bad or good . . . .</p>
