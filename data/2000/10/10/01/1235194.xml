        <p>PRESIDENT HUGO CHAVEZ of Venezuela, speaking to leaders of the OPEC countries in Caracas last week, urged crybabies lamenting the high price of oil to direct their anger at national taxes or, in the case of the poorest countries, at the failure of the rich to grant them debt relief. The big oil producers, Mr. Chavez said, were on the side of the people. Nice try, but that's not the way it looks from Rwanda, or just around the corner from Caracas in the Caribbean and Central America, or in faraway Asia.</p>
        <p>In much of the developing world, in countries without oil of their own, rising fuel prices can not only cripple public transportation or gut slender national budgets that could otherwise be used to improve living standards and services. They also can weaken crucial sectors of fledgling private economies that are supposed to hold out hope for national growth.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, developing countries with no oil, gas or large-scale hydroelectricity, especially small or landlocked nations, are in the hands of importers and transporters who show no mercy. Big lending institutions don't make it easy for them to get credit for alternative sources of energy. And to compound all this, prices for commodities produced in the third world have fallen disastrously over the last decade.</p>
        <p>Dr. Lamuel A. Stanislaus, Grenada's ambassador to the United Nations, said in an interview last week that far away from the widely reported protests against oil prices in Europe, there were little-noticed strikes in his country by taxi and bus drivers.</p>
        <p>Last week in Caracas, President Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria, Africa's largest oil producer, acknowledged that poor nations were in trouble and called for a fund to help stabilize oil prices for developing nations. Grenada depends on oil from Trinidad -- not an OPEC member -- and in the past Trinidad has offered concessional terms in times of crisis. But until that kind of help comes, Grenada and other islands wrestle alone with their problems.</p>
        <p>''The small island states like Grenada, we are wholly dependent on the import of oil for energy and so many of our industries depend on oil,'' Dr. Stanislaus said. ''Generation of electricity in Grenada is dependent on oil. The cost of electricity is high and will go higher. Another area where we have been suffering is transportation. And the air carriers bringing tourists -- the price of oil will definitely affect us there.'' And in a nation of fish-eaters, he added, ''The fishing fleet is fueled by oil when they go out to sea.''</p>
        <p>IN Rwanda, a wounded country still trying to overcome the legacy of genocide, the oil price shock ''is like adding insult to injury,'' said Ambassador Joseph Mutaboba. Rwanda has to buy oil through the port of Mombasa, Kenya, and pay a succession of oil importers. ''Rwanda counts every single penny,'' he said. ''Having over 60 percent being spent on debt servicing, we now have to use even the small amount left to counter the oil shortage.''</p>
        <p>Middle income countries also feel the pain. In South Korea, elevators in some buildings now stop at alternate floors. In Thailand, Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai introduced a weekly ''car-free'' day by riding his bicycle to work. Mr. Mutaboba and other envoys say they have raised the issue of the rich-poor gap on energy with OPEC and in relevant United Nations committees, where they also ask for more urgent attention to debt relief. ''We make these appeals but they fall on deaf ears,'' he said last week.</p>
        <p>The low prices of other commodities produced in the developing world had begun to take a toll before the cost of oil rose. ''Even as the price of oil has risen by over 40 percent over the last year, the prices of key commodities that make up the mainstay of many developing countries' exports, such as coffee, cocoa and cotton, have fallen between 45 to 50 percent,'' said Mark Malloch Brown, administrator of the United Nations Development Program, introducing his agency's World Energy Assessment Report on Sept. 20. Although the latest United Nations World Economic and Social Survey, released on Thursday, shows a slight slowing of commodity price plunges, it nonetheless concludes: ''Among the major categories of nonfuel primary commodities, agricultural prices experienced the sharpest drop in 1999.''</p>
        <p>Figures from the report show that sugar prices dropped 30 percent within a year, and tropical beverages -- cocoa, coffee and tea -- fell 21 percent, with similar drops in the prices of vegetable oil seeds and oils. Agricultural material like rubber, cork, some wood products and textile fibers fell 10 percent. Only the prices of tropical timber, an increasingly scarce commodity, rose substantially (about 17 percent) from 1998 to 1999. Against those figures, oil prices rose from about $10.50 a barrel in December 1998 to more than $30 now .</p>
        <p>Dr. Stanislaus, the Grenadan ambassador, said that the time was overdue to concentrate harder on new and renewable sources of energy. ''We have thermal energy,'' he said. ''We have energy from the sun. We have water. We have wind.''</p>
        <p>AT the United Nations Development Program, Mr. Malloch Brown agreed, but said that the obstacles were formidable. ''The short-term answer is lower gas prices, but the longer-term answer for developing countries has got to be alternative energy strategies,'' he said. ''But you've got still a situation where it's easier to get cheap credit to build a traditional power plant, as long as it meets some environmental standards. You can't get cheap credit for solar power or other energy sources.''</p>
        <p>Surprisingly missing from the current oil-price debate are the environmentalists, Mr. Malloch Brown said. As protests spread in Europe against the high-tax strategies that were adopted after the oil shock of the 1970's to slow the rise in energy consumption, he added, there were no strong voices from the environmental lobby arguing that these policies were right and should not be abandoned. In the United States, Vice President Al Gore, author of ''Earth in the Balance,'' has called for a draw-down in strategic oil reserves instead of a new look at American energy use. ''The environmental community ought to look at itself pretty hard,'' Mr. Malloch Brown said.</p>
