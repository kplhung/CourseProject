        <p>ON Sept. 14, with 2,800 passengers aboard five vessels in the Bahamas, Cozumel, Mexico, and Nova Scotia, Premier Cruises was shut down.</p>
        <p>For me, this was not just a news report; I was a Premier passenger  in June, and my cruise was a bust. Along with my husband and three of our grandchildren, I had gotten as far as Boston on a cruise to Nova Scotia out of New York when the company gave up trying to fix the air-conditioning on the Big Red Boat II and canceled after two days. All  992 passengers aboard were promised full refunds as well as vouchers for a future date. The line then sent us back to New York on buses.</p>
        <p>Our crushed, weary grandchildren were met by their parents, who had been summoned by cell phone after two days of their first child-free week in 14 years. No one who has lost a vacation needs more grim details.</p>
        <p>Every week from then on, our travel agent called Premier about the promised refund. We had paid $2,834 in all, starting with deposits in mid-April, all charged to American Express. On Sept. 8, our agent, Anne Davies of Linden Travel in New York -- who is retiring from the travel business -- said that she could no longer reach the woman she had been speaking with in Premier's accounting department. Instead, she was getting a taped message from the refund department saying ''every effort'' was being made to provide refunds, but five canceled or shortened trips made it impossible to handle the high volume of calls.</p>
        <p>A week later, Premier, a privately held company with a capacity of over 5,000 passengers, stopped operating.</p>
        <p>Adrift and Orphaned</p>
        <p>Failure has no sponsors. Bruce Nierenberg, president and chief executive officer of Premier, said in an interview after the shutdown that in effect, he had not been in charge of the line since April. Mr. Nierenberg said that Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, an investment bank that had lent the line $55 million in 1998 with five vessels as collateral, had really been running things.</p>
        <p>Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette precipitated the shutdown by abruptly seizing four mortgaged ships on Sept. 14; Catherine M. Conroy, a spokeswoman for the banking company, said it feared that other creditors would get there first, and that it also wanted to ensure the orderly debarkation of passengers. The fifth mortgaged vessel, the Seawind Crown, being operated under charter in the Mediterranean, was seized in Barcelona, said Alan Twaits, Premier's counsel; however, Ms. Conroy said the banking company had not seized it. A sixth vessel, our own Big Red Boat II, which Premier was operating under charter, was recovered by its British owner, Oceanic Marine Ltd., at the same time.</p>
        <p>Mr. Twaits, who during the week of Sept. 10 had the unhappy task of announcing that the company was laying off virtually everyone remaining on its staff, supplied a rough tally of the passengers to whom Premier had earlier promised refunds for cancellations or shortened cruises.</p>
        <p>The total is inexact because the company rebooked passengers who chose to try again, in addition to giving them vouchers for another time. Some disappointed passengers were transferred immediately to another Premier boat, or got another cruise. Our kids loved their one day at sea, the games and computer room and the cabin steward, I Wayan Muryartha, who twisted their towels into swans; they were ready to go again immediately, but other obligations made that impossible, so we asked for the refund.</p>
        <p>Mr. Twaits's record showed that a canceled June 3 New York-Nova Scotia trip of the Big Red Boat II had 800 passengers booked; its June 10 round trip was completed, although the anchor snagged a power cable in Newport, R.I.; its canceled June 17 trip had 775 passengers, of whom 230 did not transfer to another vessel; our June 24 trip ended in Boston when all 992 passengers were put ashore (no other ship was available to take those who wished to continue). In Houston, 1,210 passengers never got aboard the Big Red Boat III for a cruise June 10 because a tug damaged a propeller; the June 17 cruise, with 1,140 passengers, was also canceled for repairs.</p>
        <p>The maximum possible number of claimants in these figures would be 4,372. Mr. Twaits said many refunds had been made; our travel agent was told by the Premier employee that she was starting on refunds for June 24 just before she was replaced by the taped message.</p>
        <p>The estimated 2,800 passengers put ashore Sept. 14 and 15 at the time of the vessels' seizure would bring the potential total to about 7,200. Beyond that are the unknown number of people who paid for or made deposits on cruises leaving on Sept. 16 and later.</p>
        <p>The Next Steps</p>
        <p>What are the avenues of recourse for passengers who got no cruise or a partial cruise and no refund? Mr. Twaits said that 20 percent of Premier's passengers had not used credit cards. The 80 percent who did and who hold reservations for cruises that will never take place should seek a refund through the credit-card company first, as soon as possible. For bank-linked credit cards, contact should be made with the issuing bank. American Express prints an 800 number on its cards for use in disputing charges.</p>
        <p>Carole Reynolds, a senior attorney at the Federal Trade Commission in Washington, says that the Fair Credit Billing Act of 1974 provides two avenues for claims in such situations.</p>
        <p>First, Ms. Reynolds said, is the billing-error provision (which the American Society of Travel Agents is recommending to agents and consumers in writing to their card companies). The billing error involved is something that was not delivered as agreed.</p>
        <p>A drawback is that the law says the cardholder should send a letter reporting the problem within 60 days of the mailing date of the bill with the error. But Ms. Reynolds says that a claim should be made even if the 60 days have expired, and three major card issuers say that Premier passengers who used their cards ''will be protected,'' whether they have paid the bill containing the Premier charge or not. The companies use varying language to describe their policies, but the message is that they are prepared to cancel or refund Premier charges for those who lost their cruises. The banks or companies then have to pick through the remnants of Premier to get their money.</p>
        <p>Sean Healy, a spokesman for Visa U.S.A., said that Visa cardholders have 120 days from the ''expected delivery date,'' meaning the date they would have boarded the ship, to dispute a charge. William P. Binzel, a vice president of MasterCard, said that the issuing banks in his organization had a provision for refunds on something ordered for ''delayed delivery'' that does not arrive a long time after payment has been made. Nancy Muller, a spokeswoman for American Express, said that the Premier collapse would be a typical billing dispute: American Express gives the cardholder a temporary credit, and if it gets no response from an inquiry to Premier, the credit becomes permanent.</p>
        <p>The second avenue cited by Ms. Reynolds of the F.T.C. is the ''claims and defenses'' provision. This applies to amounts that have been billed but not paid. Three tests must be met: That the cardholder made a good-faith attempt to resolve the problem with the merchant; that the amount involved is more than $50 and that the transaction took place in the state where the cardholder lives, or within 100 miles of the home address.</p>
        <p>Most states have laws governing where phone transactions take place. A good argument can be advanced that someone who calls a travel agent from home and then gives the agent a credit card number over the phone has made a transaction from home, wherever the agent may be. The ''billing error'' route is probably the better way to approach the problem, even for those who have not paid the bill with the Premier charge in it.</p>
        <p>For those who take that approach, the American Society of Travel Agents has prepared a model letter for a billing-error complaint that its member travel agents can provide to consumers.</p>
        <p>Added Protection</p>
        <p>Many of the passengers who lost their cruises were in a relatively fortunate position, because they had bought trip-cancellation insurance, as we had. Our policy, which cost  $257, was chosen by our agent from CSA Travel Protection, which is a  supplier recommended by the consortium her agency belongs to.</p>
        <p>The CSA policy covers default of the travel operator. Some policies limit payment of benefits to situations where an operator declares formal bankruptcy; others exclude default as a reason for claims. Claudia Fullerton, a spokeswoman for CSA, which is based in San Diego, said  her company would probably have $500,000 in claims from Premier passengers. She said on Sept. 20 that the company was already receiving calls from policyholders at (800) 348-9505 and was sending out claim forms. Ms. Fullerton further said that agents were advising clients that seeking a refund from their credit cards was an option, but were not requiring that they do this before filing an insurance claim.</p>
        <p>Tom Zavadsky, an executive vice president of Travel Guard in Stevens Point, Wis., said that his company expected $1.5 million in Premier claims. ''Our phone is ringing off the hook,'' he said, adding that the company's agents, rather than sending out claim forms, were taking client information over the phone and entering it into the computer on the spot. The number is (800) 826-1300.</p>
        <p>Beth Godlin, senior vice president of World Access of Richmond, Va., which sells Access America policies, said that she expected her company would have $1 million in claims. She said that when the company began to receive calls, she ran a report and found that in the collapse of Regency Cruises almost exactly five years ago, Access America paid $1.5 million in claims.</p>
        <p>Some people will get their money back under a combination of claims. Dan McGinnity, a spokesman for Travel Guard, said that in another case, a policyholder had spent $30,000 for a deluxe cruise that was canceled, and the credit-card company covered only $18,000. Travel Guard paid the rest, he said.</p>
        <p>Bond Provides Coverage</p>
        <p>The third source of compensation for the lost fares is a surety bond ($15 million in Premier's case) that the Federal Maritime Commission requires cruise companies to take out. The Government requires the bond as evidence of financial responsibility and as a way to indemnify passengers and others for deaths or injuries, or for nonperformance by passenger vessels. The bond size, according to Sandra L. Kusumoto, a spokeswoman for the commission, is based on passenger revenue and is typical for cruise ships because they take deposit money for cruises far into the future. This bond covers only cruise payments, and not the cost of air fare to or from a port.</p>
        <p>The yield from the bond is intended to compensate those who will not get help from credit cards or trip insurance. The bond is underwritten by the Greenwich Insurance Company and NAC Reinsurance. The handling of claims and other matters will be directed by a law firm retained by the insurers and by companies experienced in liaison between lawyers and passengers.</p>
        <p>The Regency collapse five years ago went through bankruptcy court, and the proceedings dragged on for months and months. George B. Freehill of Freehill, Hogan &amp; Mahar of New York, a lawyer working on this case who also worked on the Regency case, said that duplicate claims had created huge delays, but that everyone the firm could identify was paid by the insurer. He said that some claimants were still being sought. The information he and the Federal Maritime Commission are issuing urges all Premier claimants to start with their credit-card  companies and trip-cancellation insurers.</p>
        <p>''By filing a claim with the credit card company, or under any applicable travel policy, the passenger will avoid the delays that inevitably occur in the investigation and claims- settling process,'' the Freehill statement says.</p>
        <p>Those who paid for canceled cruises by check or cash, the statement continues, may obtain claim forms and instructions by calling (212) 425-1883, faxing (212) 425-0392 or sending an e-mail message to premier@freehill.com.</p>
        <p>The Web sites of the Federal Maritime Commission (www.fmc.gov) and the insurance company (www .nacre.com) both have the full text of the announcement. A Web page is being set up by the legal organizations involved in the claims process.</p>
        <p>Meantime, I have worthless cruise vouchers to give to the kids. They would rather have had the trip to Nova Scotia. I am sure the same goes for the rest of the claimants.</p>
