        <p>On the eve of an election campaign some 30 years ago, Richard Nixon described himself as being ''tanned, rested and ready.'' Three decades along, on the threshold of yet another America's Cup crusade, the same could be said of Russell Coutts.</p>
        <p>Coutts, the two-time cup winner from New Zealand, was in Sydney at the Olympic sailing site earlier this week in a coaching role that befits a gold medalist, which he was in the Finn class in 1984. He had been recruited by an old friend, the American Soling skipper Jeff Madrigali, to help the United States team hone its racing skills.</p>
        <p>But when Madrigali lost in the quarterfinal rounds and made an early, unscheduled exit from the competition, so did Coutts.</p>
        <p>Before leaving, Coutts sat down to talk about his last six eventful, at times tumultuous, months. In March, as the skipper and incoming chief of Team New Zealand, he successfully defended the cup. Weeks later, he quit the New Zealand campaign and was brandished by many Kiwis as a traitor. Now, he is living in Switzerland, where he heads up a $55 million cup challenge bankrolled by the pharmaceutical billionaire Ernesto Bertarelli.</p>
        <p>Coutts looked fit and relaxed here, the only visible sign of strain being a fresh sprinkle of gray in his dark hair. When asked whether his controversial departure from Team New Zealand might have been the cause, his answer came with a laugh.</p>
        <p>''It probably hasn't helped,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In New Zealand, not everyone forgives Coutts or the six crewmen who left with him for Switzerland, including the tactician Brad Butterworth who sailed brilliantly while dispatching Italy's Prada Challenge for the cup in a 5-0 drubbing.</p>
        <p>And Coutts believes certain members of the Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron, the present holders of the cup, have dragged their feet in responding to Bertarelli's official notice of his challenge. ''We're copping a little bit of flak there because they're delaying things a little more than what I think is necessary,'' he said. ''It's probably a little of the history of it.''</p>
        <p>He believes such tactics are short-sighted. ''It's stupid, really, because I think these teams are good for the sport,'' he said. ''On the one hand, these stalling tactics don't help their reputation any, and on the other they probably make us more determined.''</p>
        <p>When Coutts speaks of ''these teams,'' he refers not only to his new allegiance but also to the campaigns recently begun by the American technology executives Craig McCaw and Larry Ellison.</p>
        <p>''It's fantastic for the sport,'' Coutts said. ''It's moved it to a new level. I see a lot more competitive syndicates, and I think that's good for the event.''</p>
        <p>In New Zealand, however, questions remain about the past. Specifically, many wish to know more about Team New Zealand's finances, and to what extent the turnover from the syndicate's former leaders, fronted by Sir Peter Blake, to its new directors, led by Coutts and Butterworth, had to do with the latter's departures.</p>
        <p>Coutts steers carefully through these waters. He said, basically, that he had hoped to have a sponsorship package in place for New Zealand, which would give him the ability to secure contracts with team members, within 90 days after the cup finals at the latest. ''But we couldn't get the transfer done quickly and a lot of our options closed up,'' he said.</p>
        <p>With many Team New Zealand players essentially free agents, the fledgling syndicates came calling. ''I knew that was a danger,'' Coutts said. ''These other players came into the game with immediate funding and pounced.''</p>
        <p>On a trip to Switzerland ostensibly to discuss chartering Bertarelli a Team New Zealand boat, Coutts says the talk turned to other possibilities, and a bond was forged. He says of the 19 sailors who competed for New Zealand last time, only five remain on the Kiwi side.</p>
        <p>Beyond that, Coutts will not air any dirty laundry about his final days with Team New Zealand. ''The true story hasn't come out and probably never will, because it doesn't really benefit anyone,'' he said. ''If I took the time to explain it I don't think there would be many arguments from anyone about what happened.''</p>
        <p>And so, to many Kiwis, Coutts and his mates will be seen as turncoats.</p>
        <p>''I think about 50 percent of New Zealanders will never forgive them,'' said the noted Kiwi broadcaster, P. J. Montgomery. ''But the other half have looked further and they want to know why. ''Why weren't these guys tied up beforehand? What were the old trustees up to?''</p>
        <p>Coutts says that it's all ancient history to him, and that he holds no grudges. ''It's all provided a fantastic opportunity for me,'' he said. ''It's a bit like 1993, when we were starting to put a new team together. I'm excited and remotivated. Life's wonderful at the moment.''</p>
        <p>MAKING WAVES</p>
        <p>With a remarkable rally after a disappointing string of opening races, the Star boat team of MARK REYNOLDS and MAGNUS LILJEDAHL today won the first United States sailing gold medal since 1992. The 470 men's and women's teams of PAUL FOERSTER and BOB MERRICK, and J.J. ISLER and PEASE GLASER, won silver medals, and the 49er crew of JONATHAN and CHARLIE MCKEE won bronze.</p>
