        <p>Is thoroughbred racing about to look a gift horse in the mouth for the second time this year, and possibly for the last time in its long battle to save itself?</p>
        <p>The gift horse is Fusaichi Pegasus, who was born a star with regal breeding: son of Mr. Prospector, grandson of Danzig. Also, with great expectations: sold as a yearling for $4 million to a Japanese venture capitalist, Fusao Sekiguchi.</p>
        <p>And when he started racing, Fusaichi Pegasus became a superstar, winning five straight races this year after running second in his debut and then winning the Kentucky Derby (the first favorite in 21 years to do so). Racing people were soon asking if this was the wonder horse, the new Secretariat who could save racing from itself with class, speed and star quality. Also, with the magic name Pegasus, the flying horse of mythology.</p>
        <p>For a time, it looked as though he was indeed the hero driven toward his destiny. Even when he ran second to Red Bullet in the Preakness, people dreamed that Fusaichi Pegasus would generate a rivalry that would save racing from the limbo of lost expectations. Then Pegasus and Red Bullet came down with injuries, missed the Belmont Stakes and waited while other horses spent the summer racing and winning.</p>
        <p>That was then, and this is now. But now, racing incredibly is getting a second chance. Now, Fusaichi Pegasus has ended his four-month absence by winning the Jerome Handicap at Belmont Park last weekend with class and command, and racing has rediscovered the thrill that comes with a great race horse. Or, as it surmised last spring, with two great race horses: Pegasus, the 3-year-old winner of the Kentucky Derby, and Lemon Drop Kid, the 4-year-old winner of last year's Belmont Stakes and of this year's Brooklyn, Suburban, Whitney and Woodward.</p>
        <p>They have suddenly become rivals for Horse of the Year, and they are facing two theatrical chances to settle the issue: the $1 million Jockey Club Gold Cup at Belmont Park on Oct. 14 and the $4 million Breeders' Cup Classic at Churchill Downs on Nov. 4. What more could racing want?</p>
        <p>But this is where fact and fancy collide. Maybe it is too obvious, two horses racing twice to see which one is truly the Horse of the Year. Maybe it lacks the complicated charm (and controversy) fanned by business ''solutions'' to the identity crisis threatening the sport. The National Thoroughbred Racing Association proposes to streamline its operations with a sophisticated technology network that might cost somebody between $100 million and $200 million. Frank Stronach's Magna Entertainment is looking into the idea of creating a national thoroughbred league with three or four franchises of 30 horses and ''teams'' of five horses.</p>
        <p>Suppose they had banked on Fusaichi Pegasus and Red Bullet for such a league this summer but then found both stars injured? If Mark McGwire gets hurt, the St. Louis Cardinals still report for the playoffs. But if Fusaichi Pegasus gets hurt, does Neil Drysdale send in a pinch-runner? In racing, you can't write the perfect script. Horses are individuals, owned and trained by individuals, with differing goals and motives.</p>
        <p>Stronach, who owns various racetracks, probably said it best when searching for reasons Fusaichi Pegasus had lost the Preakness to his Red Bullet: ''Horses aren't machines.'' Call it the X factor. It's what makes racing dramatic. Maddening, true, but utterly dramatic because it follows no script. The enticing part is voiced by John Terranova, the trainer of Gander, who was third in the Woodward: ''Fusaichi Pegasus is in a different universe as far as horses go.''</p>
        <p>But now, his trainer, Drysdale, isn't so sure about Fusaichi Pegasus. Win or lose, the horse has been valued at $60 million and will head to stud next year, so the title Horse of the Year isn't quite so urgent for his camp. Besides, he might win it just by winning the Kentucky Derby and the Breeders' Cup Classic. Nor is the purse money decisive when you realize that a huge pot of gold lies within reach as a stallion. And an injury at this late stage of his racing career might prove ruinous to the early stage of his next career.</p>
        <p>But for Scotty Schulhofer, the trainer of Lemon Drop Kid, nothing would be sweeter than adding the ultimate honor for his colt. ''In my mind, he is the Horse of the Year,'' Schulhofer said. ''If he's got to win two more races, he will.''</p>
        <p>Whatever racing is, show biz or betting biz, its future lies in its stars. So, we had better find a way to make certain that the stars are taken as seriously as the tournaments and at-home bettors. It all begins on the track, where Fusaichi Pegasus surfaces again as a superstar on the threshold of fulfilling his great expectations -- when he runs.</p>
