        <p>STEPHEN AND MARGE HOPPE say their friends thought they were crazy to build their own country house. Why didn't they just buy one?</p>
        <p>But the Hoppes, who are 31 and live in Peter Cooper Village in the East 20's in Manhattan, decided that the time was right and that it might never be again. ''We thought we would never have the guts to do it once we had responsibilities and kids,'' Mr. Hoppe said.</p>
        <p>Not that they started out determined to build rather than buy. They looked at houses in Sullivan County in the Catskills, and then in Columbia County near the Massachusetts border. ''We looked at close to a hundred houses,'' Mrs. Hoppe said, but they never found the right place; either the land was right and the house wasn't, or vice versa. The couple met 10 years ago at work, and got married four years ago.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hoppe, who works as a video editor, had always thought it would be fun to build a house, so when a broker suggested they look at 16 acres in Copake in Columbia County for $36,000, they looked at the land, and fell for it.</p>
        <p>At about the same time, Mr. Hoppe ran into Joseph Bruno, a high school friend from East Islip, on Long Island, who had become an architect. The Hoppes and Mr. Bruno began meeting about two years ago, shortly after they first saw the land. The couple never looked at plans by any other architect; Mrs. Hoppe jokes that Mr. Bruno was ''the only one we could afford.''</p>
        <p>But as in many successful architect-client relationships, it is clear that the three have become friends and have managed to work through the glitches that come up in building something big. Because over time the house got bigger and bigger. ''We're not building a summer house,'' which was the original plan,  Mrs. Hoppe said. ''We're building a dream house.''</p>
        <p>As they talked with their architect,  they realized they wanted to include everything that really mattered to them, like a private deck, and a screened-in porch for meals, and plenty of room for friends and family. ''We realized we probably wouldn't build another house,'' Mrs. Hoppe she said.</p>
        <p>After they perfected their design, the real work began. Although they hired workers to do the excavating, framing, foundation and heating, they have cleared a lot of the land, and done the drywall, electricity, spackling and painting. Everything they can do, they will do.</p>
        <p>And it's something entirely new to both of them. Mr. Hoppe, who has functioned as the general contractor and prime mover, has learned as he has gone along, studying books.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Hoppe, who works as a producer for a company that puts together corporate events, has worked with him. Whenever they were doing electricity or putting up walls and didn't know what to do next, he looked in a book, consulting a homebuilding guide that the Hoppes call their bible. But his greatest asset, his wife says, is that he has ''no fear.''</p>
        <p>SINCE August 1999, when the work began, they have spent every weekend and all of their vacations at the house working, often with friends and relatives helping.</p>
        <p>By the end of August, they had accomplished enough that they were able to begin spending weekends in the house rather than in a local motel. One side of the 2,700-square-foot structure overlooks a valley that becomes visible in winter when the trees lose their leaves. There is a great room and a kitchen, and a loft  that will probably house their office.</p>
        <p>Another wing includes a large master bedroom and two guest rooms. Underneath is a high-ceilinged basement that can be developed later.</p>
        <p>Their house will cost about $300,000 to build, but, because of the money they have saved on labor, it will have features that are more elaborate than are typically found in a house that price. For instance, by doing the drywall, Mr. Hoppe estimates they have saved $12,000. Those savings let them buy such things as an $8,000 system for turning on and off the lights using a wall pad -- or a telephone.</p>
        <p>''I'll be able to use my cell phone to turn on the light and the heat from the car,'' Mr. Hoppe said. ''I'm a technology geek.''</p>
        <p>Eventually, they may build a garage with a studio; both of them used to create metal sculptures, an activity they have put on hold while they build their house. But they seem in no hurry. Their patience is quite remarkable, but considering all the work they have to do, it is a good thing. ''There's no time frame,'' Mr. Hoppe said. There can't be, given that they do this on weekends.</p>
        <p>''We thought we would be celebrating the millennium here, and then Labor Day,'' Mrs. Hoppe said. Now  they try not to give themselves false hopes. ''It's hard to think ahead of the one thing you're working on,'' she said. ''It's too overwhelming.''</p>
        <p>They originally fell for the land in part because it's just five minutes from Copake Lake and near such cultural events as Tanglewood and Jacob's Pillow. ''Meanwhile, we haven't done any of them,'' she said. ''We've never even been on the lake.''</p>
        <p>But they don't seem to mind, because the work is a great contrast to their city lives. ''I sit for eight to 10 hours a day in a dark room,'' Mr. Hoppe said. In Copake, they can see the stars at night from their new, not-quite-finished bedroom.</p>
