        <p>JENNA died two weeks ago, so the thoughts of her parents, Theresa and Bruce Gudin, are not as preoccupied by their insurance carrier as they once were.</p>
        <p>But their struggle to get coverage for home health care for Jenna, their daughter who suffered from spinal muscular atrophy and died at the age of 13 months, underscores the difficulties that can arise when anything in an insurance contract isn't crystal clear.</p>
        <p>On two points, all parties involved agree: Jenna Gudin's coverage for 24-hour nursing care had been exhausted, but some kind of continuing care remained, in H.M.O. language, ''medically necessary.'' The question became how much care the insurer was obliged to pay for, and on that no one could find accord.</p>
        <p>When she came home from the hospital in April, the doctors agreed that Jenna needed care around the clock. Her illness made it hard for her to breathe; she slept with a ventilator, could not move, could not cough and would choke on her own secretions if left unmonitored.</p>
        <p>The Gudins's contract with Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey provided for ''short term'' 24-hour nursing care. After that, ''part time'' care would be paid for. What did those terms mean, exactly? The contract did not elaborate. But on June 23, the company's medical director wrote to the Gudins to say that the 24-hour benefit would end in three days.</p>
        <p>That was 60 days after the care had begun, and the Gudins did not think that was unreasonable, especially when they read the rest of the letter. Jenna might be covered by the company's alternative treatment program, it said, and ''Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield wants to work with you to facilitate and assure that your child receives the care she needs.''</p>
        <p>Representatives from Horizon came to the Gudins's home to see Jenna, talk to the family and meet with doctors. Dr. Zia Ghavami, Jenna's pediatrician, came away impressed. ''The people who attended that meeting wanted the best for the child,'' he said. ''No one felt it was a good idea to limit care.''</p>
        <p>But then, in August, came another letter from Horizon, saying Jenna was no longer entitled to any nursing care at all. Stunned, the family immediately appealed the decision and took up the matter with the Small Employer Health Benefits Program, a division of the state insurance department. Horizon wrote to the Gudins again, this time saying that care for Jenna would indeed be covered, but only for four hours a day; the alternative care option was dead.</p>
        <p>The Small Employer program concluded that Horizon was unreasonable to limit Jenna's covered care to just four hours a day. ''There was a big disconnect between 24-hour care and then going to four hours,'' said Ellen F. DeRosa, deputy executive director of the program. By her reading of the contract and the law, she said, part-time care meant any level less than 24 hours a day, and ''is an unlimited benefit.''</p>
        <p>She wrote a letter saying so to Horizon's lawyer, Lenore Brady, who responded that Ms. DeRosa had ''no authority to issue opinions interpreting'' the insurance plan.</p>
        <p>''I was incensed,'' Ms. DeRosa said, especially since her agency had written the standardized contract language in question and often sends bulletins to insurers on how to interpret the contract. (Her view on this issue was later incorporated in just such a bulletin.)</p>
        <p>The position of Horizon was that the meaning of part-time care was no more clear to it than to the Gudins. ''We believe we made a reasonable interpretation of ambiguous language in a standardized contract,'' it said in a written statement.</p>
        <p>Kent B. Thurber, head of the health group in the Portland, Ore.,  law office of Davis Wright Tremaine, said this situation ''points to the need for people to understand how the terms in their policy are defined.''</p>
        <p>''There is no inherent definition of short term or part time,'' he added.</p>
        <p>As far as New Jersey insurers go, Ms. DeRosa's bulletin is now enforceable; ignoring it means risking a fine or even a license suspension.</p>
        <p>Yet who studies the intricacies of insurance contracts that they hope will never apply to them? Not the average 30-year old with no current plans to become terminally ill. And not hopeful parents of a newborn, who in their worst nightmare never expected to be told that their baby would die without 24-hour care.</p>
        <p>Mr. Thurber said: ''Consumers need to communicate with an insurer and state agencies, ask for a definition and get it confirmed in writing from the start. Then at least you have some documented evidence going forward.''</p>
