        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Righting United Airlines: Nine Flight Plans'' (Sept. 10), in which airline experts, professors and consumer advocates offered their ideas for solving the carrier's labor and service problems:</p>
        <p>I disagree with Gerald Meyers, a University of Michigan professor, who, in criticizing United's employee stock ownership plan, said that ''very few'' ESOP's are successful.</p>
        <p>I happen to be an employee-owner in an ESOP company, Scot Forge, a Spring Grove, Ill.-based manufacturer of open die and rolled ring forgings -- a true ''heavy metal'' industry. Just under 500 of us own two manufacturing plants in Illinois and one in Wisconsin. We are a 100 percent employee-owned company,  through an ESOP established in 1978.</p>
        <p>We are a very profitable private company, and over the years we have watched the value of our stock increase steadily. Our ESOP has created a few new millionaires, and many of us have retired with very healthy, six-figure stock accounts.  These are not just company officers or directors -- we are talking about  factory and office workers, too. As owners, we also share in the profits through bonuses and dividends, and our pay scale is competitive with that of companies in our area that are not employee-owned.</p>
        <p>Scot Forge is far from an isolated success story. Many ESOP companies are much like ours, small to midsized businesses. They represent every aspect of our economy, including manufacturing, retail and service industries.</p>
        <p>KAREN YORK  Spring Grove, Ill., Sept. 12</p>
        <p>The writer is a staff accountant at the Scot Forge Company.</p>
