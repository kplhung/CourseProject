        <p>AH, wilderness. A 100-year-old Tudor mansion hidden away. An under-construction faux Tudor mansion rising behind a ribbon of fresh asphalt. A broad green lawn to mow. A place to fire up the grill -- or have someone fire it up for you. For half a century, such has been the lure of New Jersey for waves of former city dwellers.</p>
        <p>But increasingly, these seekers of rural charm do not have to hike far in their Timberlands to find their newest enemy: Nature. There are the deer spreading ticks, bears pawing at the barbecue and geese spoiling the parks after being fed countless pieces of bread by yuppies and their Gap-clad progeny.</p>
        <p>The bluebird of suburban happiness may be beautiful and embracing in theory, but when it comes to geese leaving something less attractive than golden eggs, homeowners insist it is time to take action.</p>
        <p>Indeed, Mike Cerra, a spokesman for the New Jersey League of Municipalities, said his organization had been fielding a growing number of requests for ordinances limiting the care and feeding of animals.</p>
        <p>So far, at least 100 of the state's 567 municipalities have enacted such ordinances for geese, duck and bear.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cerra looked at the standoff this way: ''They were here before we were. We're the new guys. We took their space and now we're surprised to see them in their own backyards.''</p>
        <p>Easily the most controversial remedies for ridding the leafy suburbs and exurbs of their earlier inhabitants are the hunting down and shooting of deer and approximately 1,000 black bears -- a number that will double by 2006, wildlife officials say.</p>
        <p>At the 11th hour last month, the state Fish and Game Council acceded to Governor Whitman's wishes and voted to cancel New Jersey's first black bear hunt since 1970. The council, at her request, had already unanimously voted to cut the number of bears that could be killed to 175 from 350.</p>
        <p>In the Essex County township of Millburn, on the other hand, a deer hunt is edging closer -- following the passage of a measure last month by the township committee -- and by next month a company with licensed sharpshooters may begin thinning the deer population to 140 from 397. The final step for the committee is to provide the details of the proposed hunt to the state Division of Fish, Game and Wildlife and await a permit.</p>
        <p>Susan Predl, a senior wildlife biologist for the state Division of Fish, Game and Wildlife, said it was likely that the township would receive the permit. ''This is not the same category as the black bear hunt that was proposed,'' Ms. Predl said.</p>
        <p>''It's not uncommon,'' she added. ''It is more often requested by urban and suburban communities where regular deer hunting is not effective.''</p>
        <p>Then there are the Canada geese. All across New Jersey, park officials, golf club owners and residents fear not for their lives, but for their grass. Geese can leave a brilliant green lawn brown and decidedly unpleasant to walk on -- particularly when romping in the park in bare feet on a warm, lazy afternoon.</p>
        <p>The acid content in goose droppings kills the natural algae in ponds that provide the oxygen in the water. Without that oxygen the fish die. And without fish to eat them, the mosquitoes thrive.</p>
        <p>About 30 municipalities -- like North Haledon, in Passaic County -- have passed resolutions or ordinances prohibiting the feeding of geese.</p>
        <p>''It has been very quiet here since we passed the resolution, three years ago, requesting that residents do not feed the geese,'' said Lucille Debiak, the administrator of North Haledon. ''They were quite bad before that. They were a health hazard concerning the droppings. Also on my street you constantly had to stop your car to let them cross.''</p>
        <p>Marybeth Smith, an editorial assistant at Coded Systems Corporation in Monmouth County, which tracks municipal ordinances, said, ''It is becoming more prevalent to pass this type of no-feeding ordinance as a way of dealing with animal problems.''</p>
        <p>Municipalities in Monmouth, Morris, Sussex, Essex and Gloucester Counties have all passed ordinances or resolutions prohibiting the feeding of geese. And last year the Monmouth County towns of Fair Haven, Interlaken and Red Bank all placed on a ban on the feeding of ''nonresident'' ducks and geese.</p>
        <p>''It's to discourage people from attracting the migrating birds, nonresident,'' said Dale Connor, secretary for Fair Haven Borough. ''One town enacted it, and everybody followed. I know a lot of towns have it now.''</p>
        <p>Apparently, the little winged frostbacks from Canada came to visit and stayed. They saw the golf courses and soccer fields of New Jersey as one big green card they just had to have. Those that make their permanent homes here are dubbed ''resident'' while those passing through are ''nonresident'' populations.</p>
        <p>Perhaps they check their driver's licenses.</p>
        <p>In Millburn -- which apparently attracts wildlife as easily as it does investment bankers -- the geese became such a nuisance and health hazard that the town took more direct action than legislation; it hired Go Goose of Flanders, which drives them off with collies and a remote-controlled miniature air boat.</p>
        <p>''Since we've been using the dogs and that little boat it's been much better over the past two years,'' said Millburn's health officer, Bill Faitoute. ''Taylor Park was the main problem for health because they hold concerts there and people had to sit in all those droppings.''</p>
        <p>These days, Go Goose is doing a go-go business. It has  contracted with 20 New Jersey municipalities from Gloucester to Passaic Counties, as well as towns in Pennsylvania, New York, Massachussetts, Long Island, and Colorado.</p>
        <p>The cost of running the geese off -- depending on the size of the goose population -- can range from a few hundred dollars to hundreds of thousands of dollars to keep airports and military base runways clear.</p>
        <p>''Of all the states we deal with, New Jersey is right at the top of the list for geese,'' said Phil Graziano, the president of Go Goose. ''Forget about hunting them. They got smart and moved into areas where you can't shoot in the middle of towns.''</p>
        <p>New Jersey has a 28-day goose-hunting season in which municipalities, airports and military bases -- by obtaining a special permit -- can ''round up and exterminate nuisance geese.'' Citizens can also hunt during that period, with a limit of five geese per hunter each day.</p>
        <p>''It's not even touching the numbers,'' said Mr. Garziano.</p>
        <p>Bill Hoffman of Hoffman's Exterminators in Mantua concurred. Indeed, Mr. Hoffman, whose company handles municipal and government contracts from Trenton to Cape May Point, says that the biggest animal problem in New Jersey is geese.</p>
        <p>''When it comes to massive statewide nuisance it's geese,'' he said. ''Geese are everywhere. There is not a county in Jersey that is not battling them right now. They get worse every year. They stopped migrating. They don't just pass through. They are officially called resident geese. They aren't going anywhere unless you run them off.''</p>
        <p>But where does the chase stop?</p>
        <p>''If we get rid of the geese,'' he said, ''it'll just be the squirrels, raccoons, snakes, bats and groundhogs left to deal with.''</p>
        <p>And what's good for the geese is not necessarily good for the deer. In Millburn Township, for instance, residents are tired of having deer eating their garbage, tomato plants and azaleas. Moroever, they associate deer with Lyme disease and highway collisions. Last year alone, town workers picked up 100 battered carcasses from local roads, double the number of a decade ago.</p>
        <p>Ms. Predl of the wildlife service said there were 16,000 recorded incidents of deer being struck by motor vehicles in 1999 -- including incidents in Chester, Union County on Route 78 east and in West Deptford 3 in which  people died.</p>
        <p>Despite the enthusiasm with which some towns are going after deer -- Summit already has the same kind of permit that Millburn is seeking, as do the park systems in Union and Morris Counties -- the wildlife service is having difficulty thinning the herds.</p>
        <p>''Even with an aggressive hunting season where one person can shoot 100 deer, it's still hard to decrease the population,'' Ms. Predl said.</p>
        <p>While at the turn of the century there were no free-ranging deer in New Jersey, she said, ''they did too good a job of repopulating.</p>
        <p>''Since deer were brought in to the state from Michigan and Pennsylvania in 1909 there are now 178,000 deer here,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Kevin Robinson, who lives in Princeton, says he has encountered herds of up to 20 deer wandering through the streets.</p>
        <p>Standing in the Princeton Community Park near Route 206, Mr. Robinson looked down at his 6-year-old son, Martin, and said, ''I kind of hate to see them have a deer hunting season, but they are a hazard and that's the truth.''</p>
        <p>More and more these days, people who have chosen to live in the more unsettled regions of the state find themselves caught between a love of animals and the instinct to protect their own cubs from such hazards as bears roaming in backyards foraging for food, deer ornamenting the lawn carrying Lyme disease.</p>
        <p>In the spring mating season, it is not unusual to see deer -- heedless of all but the pursuit of propagation --  lurching out from the the underbrush, onto highways and into shops and homes.</p>
        <p>It is not unusual for drivers to glue deer whistles to bumpers in the hope that the high-pitched sound will ward the animals off. And Morristown and Hillsboro have installed red reflectors along the roads so that when a car's headlights shine on the reflectors, the red light floods nearby fields and frightens away the deer.</p>
        <p>Then there is Clinton Griggs, a project engineer for the state Department of Transportation's maintenance division, who is the man responsible for cleaning up when a deer -- or other large animal -- is struck on a state roads.</p>
        <p>''A dead deer can be the worst thing ever to happen in a person's life,'' said Mr. Griggs, who should know. Mr. Griggs said he has had mayors and members of Congress roust him from bed to get a carcass that a constituent has encountered.</p>
        <p>''They want it gone within the hour, and if it isn't taken away pronto, they are on the phone to their congressman,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Griggs remembered one incident last year in Montgomery Township in which someone actually moved a deer several times before Mr. Griggs could find and dispose of it.</p>
        <p>''Seems it came to its final rest near a big school bus stop and everyone was in a panic that the kids would see it in the morning, so somebody moved it,'' he said. Before coming to its final rest, however, he said the carcass was first moved near a shopping center, then near a senior citzens' center and then a school before finally ending up on a back road.</p>
        <p>''I was out hunting a dead deer,'' Mr. Griggs said with a laugh.</p>
        <p>Princeton Township, he said, is one of his most frequent pickup zones. ''In Princeton you have calls all the time about deer jumping straight through the plate glass storefront windows in town,'' he said. ''It's bound to happen more and more with all the development. The deer are pushed into smaller spots.''</p>
        <p>UP the northern and western reaches of the state it is bears that have some residents literally up in arms. Unlike the deer -- a threat by their sheer numbers and traffic hazards -- the invading black bear sends people scattering and their hearts skittering.</p>
        <p>First there is elation at the sighting. But soon it dawns on the person facing the bear that although the animal looks cuddly, it is in fact a potential predator.</p>
        <p>Development has grown steadily in the last 20 years in sections of Sussex, Passaic, Morris and Warren Counties that were once covered with forests. The bears -- hearty eaters and intelligent, adaptable animals -- have come to rely on people to broaden their diet of berries, acorns, skunk cabbage, rabbits and other small mammals.</p>
        <p>Bears have long been wandering into more settled areas, particularly in the summer, as the young are rousted from their lairs to make way for new offspring. But experts say the bears being spotted now tend to be older and more brazen. As their numbers have grown, they have migrated to more thickly populated counties, including Bergen, Essex, Hunterdon and Somerset.</p>
        <p>Indeed, some residents of West Milford, in Passaic County, are battling black bears that have become so at home in human terrain that residents claim they look both ways before crossing the street.</p>
        <p>Susan Kuchenreuther of West Milford -- who heads Bear Truth, the group that lobbied Governor Whitman to hold the black bear hunt -- said: ''They're beautiful animals. Really, I love them. But if they come into the yard they pose a threat and need to be euthanized.</p>
        <p>''The bears need to have the fear instilled back into them,'' Mrs. Kuchenreuther added. ''They want our food and they'll do anything to get it. They are way too comfortable in my backyard.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Kuchenreuther founded the group in June after her female Labrador retriever, Shadow, was mauled late one late night by a black bear who took the dog by the neck and bit it several times. The dog survived, but her owner has become a militant anti-bear activist.</p>
        <p>''I have two boys, Tommy, who's 10, and Stephen, who's 7, and I worry all the time now,'' she said.</p>
        <p>It was pressure exerted by animal rights groups that led the governor to cancel the hunt while expanding municipal rights to euthanize animals deemed to be a threat to public safety.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Kuchenreuther is so concerned for her children's safety that she has told them they must wear whistles while outdoors so they can summon help if they are cornered or approached by a bear. In addition, the family has spent $1,000 to light the backyard and has set up a watch schedule whenever the dog is outside.</p>
        <p>Last week, while she was in her garage, Mrs. Kuchenreuther said she ''heard a dragging sound and turned to see a massive bear entering the garage.</p>
        <p>''I hid behind the car and made my way around to the basement door and made a dive for the door,'' she said breathlessly. ''I am always anticipating an encounter. It is really unnerving.''</p>
        <p>Still, there are those who have made peace with the animals. Susan Kehoe lives next to Waywayanda State Park, a black bear habitat that separates Vernon from West Milford. Fifteen years ago Ms. Kehoe coaxed a cub down from a tree with a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.</p>
        <p>''That was before the no-feeding ordinance,'' she said. ''As with any wild animal, you should always exercise extreme caution when approaching wild bears.''</p>
        <p>Today, that bear, which she named Samantha, another named Goofey and two cubs are welcome frequenters of the Kehoe yard.</p>
        <p>''I would not condone people feeding bears because it's not in the bear's best interest,'' Ms. Kehoe said. 'The bears get used to the handout, but can't always tell where to go back to. As we all know, some people don't want the bears in their yards.''</p>
        <p>For her part, Ms. Kehoe characterized the members of Bear Truth as ''a bunch of hysterical soccer moms on the war path.''</p>
        <p>Linda Smith, the founder of the Bear Education and Resource Group in West Milford, tends to agree with Ms. Kehoe, though in less strident terms. ''There are a lot of people moving here who don't know how to deal with bears,'' Ms. Smith said. ''They love the views and green space but not the wildlife that comes with it.''</p>
        <p>Several weeks ago Ms. Smith joined with the American Humane Society, the New Jersey Animal Rights Alliance, the Sierra Club and some individual residents to sue the state and force it to stop the hunt.</p>
        <p>The State Fish and Game Council, an 11-member board appointed by the governor to set rules for wildlife management, said there was currently one bear per square mile in Bergen, Passaic, Essex, Hunterdon and Somerset Counties. The council recently proposed allowing a hunt to drop that number to one per 2.35 acres. But the hunt was stopped after activists alleged that the council had not done enough research.</p>
        <p>''In the Poconos, also home to black bears, there are two to three bears per square mile, and they are not having a hunt,'' Ms. Smith said.</p>
        <p>Sharon Southard, a spokeswoman for the Division of Fish and Wildlife, a branch of the state Department of Environmental Protection, said, ''We feel that the governor's new management plan will accomplish the same goals as the hunt.''</p>
        <p>Ultimately, the governor arrived at a plan that she termed ''aggressive but reasonable.'' The program includes a public education program, partnership agreements with law enforcement agencies to train local police in bear management techniques. In addition, it allows law enforcement personnel to euthanize bears that pose a threat to public safety. Nuisance bears can be be tagged and relocated.</p>
        <p>The Bear Group and others are now backing a bill introduced in the State Assembly aimed at banning the hunting of black bears for five years.</p>
        <p>But the Bear Truth group plans to fight the proposed ban to ''keep the options open.''</p>
        <p>''I was somewhat surprised when the governor flip-flopped her position,'' Ms. Kuchenreuther said. ''It was all political pressure. But we're not totally unhappy, because the towns have more ability to euthanize the problem bears.''</p>
        <p>Some hunters agree with the Bear Group's view of the state's bear research, but for different reasons.</p>
        <p>Rick Bailey who owns M &amp; R Animal Removal in Palmyra and contracts with seven Burlington County towns to remove animals, is also an avid bear hunter who is relieved that the state dropped the hunt.</p>
        <p>''The state was going about it all wrong,'' Mr. Bailey said. ''Hunters were going to get hurt for sure.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bailey said that the low hunting fees, coupled with the the ease of obtaining a license and lack of training classes, would have allowed novice hunters to take a potentially deadly expedition.</p>
        <p>''Anyone who had done even a little homework on the subject would know that the state's plan was going to decrease the hunter population before it decreased the bears,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bailey said that experienced bear hunters preferred to set bait for the bears and shoot from the safety of a tree stand, or an above-ground hunting enclosure. Foes of the hunt disapproved of that practice, saying it was unfair to the bears.</p>
        <p>''First off, you're never going to find them by just wandering aimlessly through the woods,'' Mr. Bailey explained. ''Second, if you did find one and had to shoot within the 50-yard range required by the allowed guns, then most likely you would find yourself in the most heart-pumping experience of your life -- running for your life through the woods with an angry, wounded bear at your heels.''</p>
        <p>Still other hunters, like John Spodofora, a Stafford Township councilman, would prefer hunts rather than allowing government employees to euthanize animals.</p>
        <p>Mr. Spodofora -- a member of the township's Environmental Commission who has been praised by President Clinton and several environmental groups for his policies -- is an unabashed hunter.</p>
        <p>''People will eat packaged hamburger from a cow that is born into a little pen where it waits its whole life to get hit on the head with a hammer,'' he said. ''And everybody's O.K. with that? The poor cow never has a chance. A hunter uses every part of the animal, whereas when it's euthanized it's just buried and wasted. People are so confused on this issue it's unbelievable.'</p>
        <p>Mona Scobbo of Princeton, who has a yard overrun with rabbits that devour her flower beds, geese that defecate on the lawn and deer that transport Lyme disease carrying ticks, has an inner battle raging over the clash.</p>
        <p>''I want my flowers, but I don't want to poison the rabbits,'' Ms. Scobbo said. ''I'm worried about my children getting Lyme but can't stand the idea of the hunt. The geese make a mess, but they are beautiful. It's just sort of part of the whole deal of living someplace that's green. We just have to learn to live with it all and enjoy it while it's here. With development being what it is, I guess they won't be here that much longer no matter what we do.''</p>
