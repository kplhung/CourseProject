        <p>Portraits, especially those of famous people, can seem both public and intensely personal.

        <p>Hans Namuth: Portraits</p>
        <p>Heckscher Museum of Art, 2 Prime Avenue, Huntington. Through Oct. 29. (631) 351-3250.</p>
        <p>Portraits, especially those of famous people, can seem both public and intensely personal. This traveling show of Namuth's photographs of celebrities in the creative arts traces the full 40 years of Namuth's work with this subject matter and tends to emphasize the wide variety of decisions involved in recording a sitter. Selections come from the collection of the Smithsonian Institution's National Portrait Gallery, which organized the exhibition.</p>
        <p>Namuth's passion for photographing creative people started in 1950 with his landmark series of 500 images of Jackson Pollock in the act of applying pigment. (Six are included in this installation.) The photographer, who had a house in Water Mill, met Pollock at the opening of Guild Hall's artists of the region exhibition and asked to visit the studio with his camera.</p>
        <p>Nothing else in the show has this kind of documentary value, although a view of Lee Krasner surrounded by her paintings in the same space, years later, after she took over her late husband's barn-studio, indicates the small pieces she chose to hang, and a view of Willem de Kooning at work contains references to his use of newspaper and large drawings.</p>
        <p>There is a lot to consider in Namuth's varied approaches to the way a specific compositional format might contribute to the portrayal. The portraits can be especially meaningful when their design establishes a link to the subject's work in some manner. A rear view of a seated Mark Rothko contemplating the slowly expanding color vibrations in a new painting is a particularly good example.</p>
        <p>Another portrays Larry Rivers concealing a portion of his face with a hand, and still another shows Josef Albers positioned in front of one of his geometric subjects in a manner that relates the structure of his face to the overall scheme. The mood of swift, transient whimsy in Saul Steinberg's art seems to harmonize perfectly with Namuth's high viewpoint photo, which makes the artist appear quite small standing beside a sidewalk covered with his chalk drawing of a train.</p>
        <p>A very obvious cleverness can introduce an awkward self-consciousness, however. Portraits of the architects Eero Saarinen and Buckminster Fuller have this quality, and it is especially evident in a image of Philip Johnson photographed on a Museum of Modern Art stairway beside Oscar Schlemmer's famous painting of a stairwell.</p>
        <p>Sharp psychological insights contribute to the success of several examples, including a pensive, troubled Pollock sitting on the running board of his car, and a dramatically conceived image of an assured Louise Nevelson presiding over the blueprints for her St. Peter's Church commission.</p>
        <p>'Pollock to Wyeth'  Heckscher Museum of Art. Through Oct. 29.</p>
        <p>It seems appropriate for the Heckscher to compliment the Namuth portraits with an exhibition of work by some of his subjects, although visitors would have been better served by a show based on selections closely related in date to the year of the portrait. The situation is somewhat redeemed, however, by the good percentage of notable pieces among the 22 examples.</p>
        <p>Mark Rothko is represented by one of his important watercolors from 1947. These fluid, shifting organic forms would soon become more regularized, but continue to emphasize the power of ambiguous color units to resonate.</p>
        <p>Other strong works also date from the 1940's, including Ben Shahn's ''Death of a Miner,'' a powerful comment on social injustice, and Lee Krasner's ''Shattered Color,'' an investigation of diffused pigment marks as a visual force. Elaine de Kooning's ''Black Mountain No. 6,'' part of a series of bold abstractions from 1948, is one of the show's special treats.</p>
        <p>Lucas Samaras readdresses the nature of examining human characteristics with a camera lens in a pair of self-portrait photographs from 1990. The setting up, lighting and manipulation of the image is their subject and they provoke comparisons with Namuth's more straightforward approach.</p>
        <p>Jackson Pollock and Jasper Johns are represented by effective screenprints typical of their approaches to abstraction.</p>
        <p>Nature studies in watercolor by Andrew Wyeth and Edward Hopper reflect the mood of intense concentration both usually have in their paintings and suggest their customary adjustments of light to heighten a specific sensation.</p>
