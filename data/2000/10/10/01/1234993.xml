        <p>ARTISTS all over the world, in the late 1950's and early 1960's, began scouring the streets and newsstands of Tokyo, Dusseldorf, Paris, Moscow, New York and San Francisco for junk materials or pop motifs. Everything that the stringent rules of Modernism had pronounced unworthy of artmaking seemed newly alluring: comic books, trash, an old quilt, a tarnished spoon, a stuffed goat, words on a page. Artists and critics called this work anti-art, Fluxus, neo-Dada, Beat, Nouveau Realisme, Gutai. The artists' aim was to sabotage any accepted definition of art and vandalize its boundaries. As Robert Rauschenberg once put it, they wanted to work in the gap between art and life.</p>
        <p>For Bruce Conner, though, debunking the meaning of art was never enough. His fixation for more than four decades has been with undermining everything you ever thought you knew about who or what it is to be an artist. Anyone who thinks he knows who Mr. Conner is from his assemblages in the Whitney Museum's ''Beat Culture'' show in 1995 will be flummoxed by the traveling exhibition ''2000 B.C.: The Bruce Conner Story, Part II,'' (organized by the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis), which opens at the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art next Sunday and remains on view through Jan. 14.</p>
        <p>Part II is ''Not a Retrospective,'' as the impossible-to-read medallion embossed on the first page of the catalog informs you, with Mr. Conner's customary barbed tomfoolery. After all, the exhibition is missing all but one of the more than 300 paintings Mr. Conner has made and all of the photographs. Those might find their way into a Part I, if there ever is one, or maybe some future Part VII. The current Part II is merely an installation of 174 sculptures, assemblages, films, collages, prints, drawings and photograms so disparate that David Bonetti, reviewing the exhibition during its stop here this summer at the M. H. de Young Museum for The San Francisco Examiner, likened it to ''a group show.''</p>
        <p>This pleases Mr. Conner. ''I never wanted to get locked into a style of work that I would be identified with to the point that I couldn't do anything else,'' he said one recent morning as we sat in the dining area of his tiny and tidy house, in front of a window overlooking rooftops of this city where he arrived from Wichita, Kan., more than 40 years ago.</p>
        <p>It's bad enough that his films are required viewing in film schools and his assemblages place him as a pivotal figure in the San Francisco renaissance of the 1960's. ''I've already been typecast as a filmmaker and sculptor,'' he complains. ''What I want to do is change.''</p>
        <p>I have been warned about Bruce Conner by curators and critics who know him. They say he is ''paranoiac,'' ''difficult'' and ''impossible to deal with.'' They regale me with stories of nasty scenes and aborted retrospectives. Even curators who are unabashed fans of the work and consider it shamefully underestimated told me he was apt to throw me out of the house.</p>
        <p>Mr. Conner, it is true, has hardly a charitable word to say about museum personnel, with the exception of Peter Boswell, the primary organizer of ''2000 B.C.'' He has even more choleric -- and sometimes more believable -- stories about curators, critics and printmakers than they have about him.</p>
        <p>''Some people are visual illiterates and they work in museums,'' he says. (At the moment, the museum Mr. Conner is in disagreement with is New York's Museum of Modern Art, over its handling of his assemblage sculptures ''Child'' and ''The Box.'')</p>
        <p>But the man in front of me is as courteous and contained as the farmer in ''American  Gothic,'' whom he resembles in the severity of his blue eyes, even when he's being funny, and the thinness of his nose. Mr. Conner is 67, but his stamina and hours have been drastically limited since 1984, when he was discovered to have a liver ailment that could have killed him within a matter of years.</p>
        <p>''Because of these constraints,'' he says, ''because of what it takes to cajole, threaten and try to coerce museums and galleries to present my work in the way I want it to be,'' he declared himself an Anonymous Artist a year and a half ago.</p>
        <p>When he can, between bed rest and the demands of a traveling exhibition, he makes collages at his 35-by-40-inch drawing table in the front room that serves as his studio. He doesn't sign them, he doesn't claim them, which means he doesn't have to photograph, measure, mat, frame or label them. He sends them to friends. If a friend calls to thank him for the work, he denies he had anything to do with it, according to his ''12-step program for Anonymous Artists.''</p>
        <p>This is only the latest act of subterfuge in Mr. Conner's ongoing confrontation with artistic identity. He sees his role as similar to that of an experimental novelist -- not to expose his soul but to create and undercut narratives through absurdity and surprise. Toward this end, like the Soviet-born artist Ilya Kabakov, he has invented fictional characters to make his work. He created an artist stuck in the vocabulary of the Surrealist artist Max Ernst and gave him the name of his movie star friend Dennis Hopper for the etchings that constituted ''The Dennis Hopper One Man Show'' in the early 1970's.</p>
        <p>He has signed prints with thumbprints and imprinted photosensitive paper with his body in his stunning series of ''Angel'' photograms. But a signature is something else. ''For me looking at a painting with a big signature on it was like a big commercial,'' he says. So he signed his work only on the back.</p>
        <p>When his New York dealer, Charles Alan, objected, he signed with the finest pen he could find, in as tiny letters as he could manage, on the most obscure area of the painting. Then he would send his dealer a map with which to find the signature. Twice during the 1960's he put a moratorium on signing altogether. He told Alan to forge his signature but didn't get any cooperation. Then Mr. Conner sent him a signature stamp, which Alan declined to use and returned to Mr. Conner. So Mr. Conner made an assemblage out of the stamp and presented it to Marcel Duchamp at a lecture, with the request that Duchamp return it to Alan. Months later, Duchamp's wife took it to Alan in the middle of a blizzard.</p>
        <p>For Mr. Conner, as for other artists of his generation, a great many ideas descended from Duchamp's readymades of 1915 -- objects easily found in everyday life, like a shovel or a urinal, which the artist declared to be art by signing them. Mr. Conner was frustrated, however, in his attempts at persuading Alan to organize a two-person show with Duchamp. Mr. Conner's idea was to paint the walls and sculpture stands in the same white as they were before he repainted them.</p>
        <p>''That would be my contribution, and I would not sign it,'' Mr. Conner tells me. ''So I would make this work that I didn't sign, and, on the walls and sculpture stands, Marcel Duchamp would show the work that he did sign but didn't make.''</p>
        <p>This antic sensibility, laced with apocalyptic dread, informs the first and most celebrated of Mr. Conner's films, the 12-minute black-and-white ''A Movie'' of 1958. Born in 1933 in Kansas, Mr. Conner was 12 when Hiroshima was bombed, and draft age when the Korean War brought the bomb scare and bomb shelters home to a complacent America.</p>
        <p>The bomb is the protagonist of ''A Movie,'' which takes its inspiration from the Marx Brothers' ''Duck Soup'' and from Mr. Conner's childhood passion for making adult secrets visible. In movies, the viewer is not supposed to see the flashing numbers leading to the beginning of the film. But Mr. Conner spliced this countdown leader with girlie footage that a friend had found in Kansas, of a nude taking off her stockings. To this he added discarded footage from a camera store of a submarine captain spying through a periscope then firing away, ostensibly at the nude. Before long an underwater atomic bomb explodes and waves capsize surfers, sailors, fish, a battleship. Then ''The End'' flashes intermittently on screen, with its double meaning of the end of the film and the end of the world. The bomb dematerializes in light. The words ''Bruce Conner'' flash large, long and often, the ego of the creator as big as the bomb.</p>
        <p>''A Movie'' and the films that followed have been credited with influencing MTV. ''Not my fault,'' Mr. Conner says when asked.</p>
        <p>But such political savagery became a mark of the horrific, erotic assemblages he made out of debris left behind by the poor blacks displaced by San Francisco's urban renewal. He studded the assemblages with Salvation Army jewelry and throttled them with nylon stockings.</p>
        <p>The relationships are intimate, if not always apparent, between the films, the assemblages, the dense black-and-white felt-tip pen drawings of the late 1960's and the compulsively ordered ink-blot drawings of the 1990's. The common thread is conflict: between black and white, light and shadow, flesh and spirit, the object and the reason for making it. In every medium Mr. Conner wants the eye to be in constant movement and so misled by the next thing it sees that, when it returns to the first, it sees something altogether different.</p>
        <p>The important thing is never to be pinned down. Never to give in to that dread signature style. It has been worth the struggle. In his youth, Bruce Conner might not have been the artist Robert Rauschenberg was, but it has served Mr. Conner's long career to keep things small, vagrant and aberrant.</p>
