''It's not until return is weighed against risk that you achieve an accurate and true assessment of how your investments are performing.''</p>
        <p>Last week, RiskMetrics added a new dimension to its retail Web site (www.riskgrades.com), which was introduced earlier this year, so that for the first time investors can evaluate actual or anticipated returns in relation to risk.</p>
        <p>RiskMetrics applies its methodology to stocks, bonds and funds, and, recently, options. It even considers currencies so that one can compare, say, an American technology stock with a Korean mutual fund composed of bonds.</p>
