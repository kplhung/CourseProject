        <p>The abandoned, chateau-style former Towers Nursing Home, opened as a cancer hospital in the 1880's by John Jacob Astor, has moved closer to becoming part of a luxury apartment complex.

        <p>The abandoned, chateau-style former Towers Nursing Home, opened as a cancer hospital in the 1880's by John Jacob Astor, has moved closer to becoming part of a luxury apartment complex. But those who are campaigning to put a museum of American medicine in the fortresslike and fire-scarred building have not given up their effort, even against increasingly long odds.</p>
        <p>The owner of the 200-foot-by-200-feet property on Central Park West between 105th and 106th Streets recently won permission from the city's Board of Standards and Appeals to install apartments in the building and in a new 27-story tower that is planned to be built behind it. And because the building's landmark status applies only to its exterior, the city's Landmarks Preservation Commission granted a permit two weeks ago for interior demolition. In addition, the local community board has backed the plan.</p>
        <p>The recent actions make it likely that Savanna Partners, which owns the site, will soon sell it to a developer who would build the apartment complex. Chris Schlank, a company partner, would not name the developer but said the deal could be completed as early as this week.</p>
        <p>But Dr. Sarah Auchincloss, a physician at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Hospital, said the building's distinctive round towers, designed to increase air and light and keep down dust and germs, and its pedigree as North America's first cancer hospital, made it the ''perfect site'' for a museum of American medicine. She said she and others had formed a nonprofit group to pursue that goal and have been meeting with city officials.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Schlank said this idea, while interesting, is impractical because of the costs of renovating the long-vacant property.</p>
        <p>Susan Gurney, who is working with Dr. Auchincloss, said the group had begun raising money but did not yet have enough to make an offer on the building.</p>
