        <p>The Yankees' players had many questions for reporters today, asking for help in sorting out the many playoff possibilities. Finally, one player asked another: ''So, let me get this straight. Where do we go if the Bengals win?''</p>
        <p>These are a handful of the possible ways the next 48 hours can play out:</p>
        <p>*If Oakland clinches the American League West and Seattle is the wild-card team, the Yankees will open the playoffs at Oakland.</p>
        <p>*If Oakland beats Texas on Sunday, Seattle loses to Anaheim, and Cleveland defeats Toronto, the Indians and the Mariners will have a one-game playoff on Monday to determine the wild-card team. If Cleveland wins to become the wild-card team, the Yankees will open the playoffs at Chicago, and Oakland will be host to Cleveland.</p>
        <p>*If Seattle wins the A.L. West and Oakland is the wild-card team, the Yankees will open the playoffs in Seattle; Chicago will be the site of the first two games between the Athletics and the White Sox.</p>
        <p>The Yankees will probably wait here for the outcome of Sunday's games involving Seattle, Cleveland and Oakland and adjust their travel plans accordingly. If other teams are required to play on Monday and the Yankees still do not know where they will open the playoffs, the Yankees will return to New York on Sunday night and work out at Yankee Stadium on Monday before traveling to the playoff site.</p>
        <p>''We're ready to go,'' Manager Joe Torre said.</p>
        <p>Tough Decisions for Torre</p>
        <p>Even if Joe Torre knew who will pitch against the Yankees on Tuesday, he might not know who will be his designated hitter and who will play second base. Torre has been trying different combinations, mostly with Chuck Knoblauch at second base and either Glenallen Hill or Jose Canseco at designated hitter.</p>
        <p>But Canseco is in a late-season funk -- he went into tonight's game 3 for 28 with no runs batted in in his last nine games -- and Hill has been good, but not overwhelming. In addition, Knoblauch clearly is struggling with his defense, even though his last throwing error occurred June 28. In Friday's game, for example, he appeared out of sync in attempting to turn a double play, his footwork and movements awkward, and he made a high throw that pulled Tino Martinez off first base.</p>
        <p>''There's no question it is still there,'' Torre said, referring to Knoblauch's throwing jitters. He added that the problem could not be addressed fully until spring training. ''But again, I find his reactions are good, and he's going after the ball and making plays.''</p>
        <p>In Torre's perfect world, Knoblauch would be the second baseman and Canseco or Hill would make an impact as designated hitters. But Torre might decide to start Knoblauch at D.H. for his abilities as a leadoff hitter and use Luis Sojo or Jose Vizcaino at second. Torre might prefer to start Sojo or Vizcaino in games started by the left-hander Andy Pettitte, whose sinking fastball tends to generate ground balls.</p>
        <p>Torre has an option similar to the strategy used by Dick Williams when Williams managed Oakland in 1972. Torre could start a defensive specialist at second, like Sojo, and inject some of his offensive-minded bench players to pinch-hit -- Hill, Canseco and Luis Polonia -- when appropriate.</p>
        <p>The Yankees' bench will be loaded with pinch-hitters, and with the possible exception of Scott Brosius, Torre will probably not pinch-hit for his regulars.</p>
        <p>If Hill pinch-hit for Sojo with two runners on base in the fourth inning, for example, Vizcaino could replace Sojo and Clay Bellinger could later replace Vizcaino.</p>
        <p>Williams used four players at second base during the American League Championship Series, including catcher Gene Tenace. Dick Green and Ted Kubiak played second during the World Series.</p>
        <p>''I have to look at the matchups,'' Torre said.</p>
        <p>M.R.I. for Grimsley</p>
        <p>Jason Grimsley had a magnetic resonance imaging examination today. An inflamed muscle in his right forearm and a bone spur in his right elbow were diagnosed. Grimsley will undergo arthroscopic surgery in the off-season for removal of the spur. In the meantime, he will try to rehabilitate the elbow, and he may try to come back during the postseason.</p>
        <p>Given the short time frame, it is unlikely Grimsley will pitch again this year, but the Yankees want to keep their options open. If a pitcher or two is hurt during the division series and the Yankees advance, their other pitching candidates, like Randy Keisler and Craig Dingman, are inexperienced.</p>
