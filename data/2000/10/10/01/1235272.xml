        <p>The factories built as part of the great Soviet industrialization undertaken for Stalin, Georgia's native son, stand empty. The ugly concrete apartment houses for the workers are crumbling. The shops display few wares, and every traffic light is off to save electricity.</p>
        <p>Only the soup kitchen seems to be thriving as a line snakes out the door.</p>
        <p>Etery Guedashvili, 61, emerges from the squat building, carrying her ration of soup in a jar and bread wrapped in paper, a meager meal that embodies the dashed hopes for democracy and prosperity all across the former Soviet republics of the Caucasus and Central Asia.</p>
        <p>At first she is embarrassed by this handout. But humiliation fast turns to anger, and she spits out her indictment of the government.</p>
        <p>''I worked in a military production plant for 30 years and I earned a good pension,'' she said. ''Now I get only 12 lari a month, and they don't even pay that. I would go back to work, but there are no jobs.''</p>
        <p>Twelve lari is $6, the average pension. Often the government does not have enough money to pay even that pittance, or the salaries of teachers, police officers and judges.</p>
        <p>Rustavi was once a model of the Soviet economy, a new city built in 1948 for 160,000 residents whose lives centered on the bustling factories. Today, Rustavi is a model for the stubborn poverty gripping a vast region rich in oil, gas and strategic importance but short of the hope that even five years ago buoyed forecasts of a better tomorrow.</p>
        <p>Details and degree differ from country to country, but everywhere there is the same volatile mix of ethnic and religious strife and despair over government failure to create even the prospect of wealth.</p>
        <p>The people here, particularly the middle-aged and elderly, grew up secure in the belief that the state, however hated, would meet their needs, and they can scarcely cope now that it patently does not.</p>
        <p>''The standard of living for large sections of the population has been falling now for 15 years,'' concluded a new report by the International Crisis Group, a private organization in Brussels. ''And there are political forces already mobilized to exploit any outburst of popular discontent.''</p>
        <p>The report dealt with Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzebekistan, but the assessment is depressingly similar elsewhere.</p>
        <p>Georgia, whose modern political star is not Stalin but Eduard A. Shevardnadze, the former Soviet foreign minister who helped tear down the Berlin Wall, was supposed to be different. It is a country of rugged beauty and rich culture, with a population of about five million in a mountainous area slightly smaller than South Carolina. The first independent state was founded in the fourth century B.C., and Christianity became the state religion in fourth century A.D.</p>
        <p>Five years ago, Georgia seemed poised to become something of a model for the triumph of Western values and the free market.</p>
        <p>The bloody civil war and the chaos that followed independence in 1991 were over. Mr. Shevardnadze, newly elected as president, was highly regarded in the West. He carried out democratic reforms and, with help from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, created the fastest growing economy among the region's former Soviet republics.</p>
        <p>Then things went awry. The Russian financial crisis in 1998 robbed Georgia of its export market for machinery, agriculture and wine. Next, fighting resumed in the breakaway ethnic enclave of Abkhazia in northwestern Georgia. Both there and in a second separatist region, South Ossetia, peace remains elusive.</p>
        <p>The economic woes deepened this summer when drought destroyed 80 percent of the wheat crop and drained reservoirs.</p>
        <p>But the biggest problem is corruption, which is so rampant that the government cannot collect enough taxes and customs duties to pay salaries and pensions regularly, let alone reduce the $200 million in foreign debt or curb its budget deficit.</p>
        <p>Teachers in the eastern region of Tianeti refused to open the schools in September, because they had not been paid for 10 months. Residents in Tkibuli, in the west, blocked streets to protest the lack of electricity.</p>
        <p>In an interview at his office in the capital, Tbilisi, Mr. Shevardnadze, now 72, acknowledged the difficulties but said he remains optimistic. He described plans for improving health care and irrigation and new efforts to improve tax collection.</p>
        <p>There is some potential help from a much-debated proposed pipeline from Baku, Azerbaijan, to the Turkish port of Ceyhan, but that is a bit further down the road, and more speculative. The pipeline would pass through Georgia, generating jobs and eventually about $50 million a year in transshipment fees.</p>
        <p>''We have gone only halfway there in terms of economic development,'' Mr. Shevardnadze said. ''It is a slow process.''</p>
        <p>One reason for the agonizing slowness of change is the prevalence of the Soviet-era mentality, especially in societies that were predominanty feudal and rural when the 1917 revolution suddenly foisted Communist visions of equality and forced industrialization on them. ''Stalin and Lenin taught us to stay in one place and wait,'' said Alexander Rondeli, director of a research center linked with the Foreign Ministry. ''This condition did not change overnight. There is no Soviet Union, but we live in the Soviet Union. We have the same values and the same mentality.''</p>
        <p>The leadership mentality is similar, too, in most of the former republics. Authoritarian leaders have centralized power and neutered the opposition just as Kremlin bosses once did. Mr. Shevardnadze is a leader of equal longevity, dominating Georgia for much of the last 35 years.</p>
        <p>True to his foreign reputation as one of the men who helped Communism collapse relatively painlessly, Mr. Shevardnadze has steered a more democratic course than other former Soviet leaders. Power is shared among the strong presidency, the judiciary and the legislature, though Mr. Shevardnadze's party controls Parliament and the opposition is weak.</p>
        <p>But corruption, from a booming black market in oil and cigarettes to bribery of officials, remains almost intractable because of the tightknit, clannish nature of Georgia and because some of those involved are longtime associates of the president and he remains loyal to them.</p>
        <p>''Corruption is the key to the economic future of the country,'' said Gela Charkviani, a senior adviser to Mr. Shevardnadze. ''If we can deal with the underlying corruption, we can collect enough taxes and other revenue to pay the salaries of the teachers and all the pensions.''</p>
        <p>A seven-member commission has just completed work on a blueprint for scrubbing the government, but details have not been disclosed.</p>
        <p>What is apparent is that the effort will have to be tough and thorough to save people like most residents of Rustavi, a city built 25 miles southeast of Tbilisi along the Kura River on the site of an ancient village said to have been destroyed by Tamerlane at the end of the 14th century.</p>
        <p>Steelworks and ironworks were started to supply the Soviet military and agriculture, and chemical factories produced pesticides. All of them polluted the river, a toxic residue that adds to the city's troubles.</p>
        <p>But the modern destruction of Rustavi occurred when the Soviet Union collapsed. The market for its goods evaporated. In the chaos that followed, armed gangs and free-lance looters pillaged the factories and sold the machinery for scrap.</p>
        <p>The local authorities estimate unemployment at higher than 50 percent, but that seems low to Malkhaz Irenadze, who runs one of the city's two soup kitchens for the Salvation Army. Each kitchen gives away 1,000 meals a day, he said, adding that he could easily serve 10 times as many.</p>
        <p>For many of those who go there, the only meal of the day is thin soup, vegetables, bread and an occasional sausage.</p>
        <p>''This is a frozen city,'' one older woman said bitterly. ''The government has forgotten us.''</p>
