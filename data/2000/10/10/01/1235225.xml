        <p>One million dollars in state planning funds have been secured to aid in the continuing revitalization of the Port Jefferson waterfront, State Senator Kenneth P. LaValle said last week.</p>
        <p>The money will be used to renovate an 11,000-square-foot corrugated steel building that will become a community center. The senator said about $500,000 in additional funds were earmarked last year to build an ice-skating rink and to make improvements to the 350-foot village pier.</p>
        <p>The 5.1 acres, called Harborfront Park, was purchased by the Village of Port Jefferson from Mobil Oil for $1.8 million in 1997. Formerly an E.P.A. Superfund site, Mobil cleaned up most of the polluted areas, leaving behind a handful of capped areas where excavation is prohibited. These will be turned into grassy areas with plantings and walkways.</p>
        <p>So far, the village has spent about $30,000 on design plans for the park, relying heavily on local volunteers, according to Mayor Jeanne Garant, who sought Mr. LaValle's help. ''I came to him with a wish list back in June,'' said the mayor. ''He told me if we could find a civic use for the building, he could get us money to renovate it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. LaValle, a Port Jefferson resident, is hoping that the waterfront facelift will lure new businesses to available space nearby. ''This will be an important boost to the Port Jefferson waterfront,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The building to be renovated is currently being used by the Long Island Seaport and Eco Center for the group's shipbuilding program, which will remain there. It will also accommodate concerts, dances and other larger community events.</p>
