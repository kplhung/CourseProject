        <p>ON Oct. 18, when Dianne Wiest replaces Steven Hill as ''Law and Order's'' district attorney, the entire cast from the original season will finally be gone. It has been a lingering death, and the ultimate blow will not be a severe one: Adam Schiff, the character played by Mr. Hill, did little these past few seasons beyond muttering ''Make it go away'' whenever he was confronted by the weekly murder-cum-political-headache.

        <p>ON Oct. 18, when Dianne Wiest replaces Steven Hill as ''Law and Order's'' district attorney, the entire cast from the original season will finally be gone. It has been a lingering death, and the ultimate blow will not be a severe one: Adam Schiff, the character played by Mr. Hill, did little these past few seasons beyond muttering ''Make it go away'' whenever he was confronted by the weekly murder-cum-political-headache. Ms. Wiest will almost certainly be an improvement. But her salutary appearance will not be enough to reverse a sorry decline.</p>
        <p>I became an avid fan of ''Law and Order'' when it first showed up on NBC back in the fall of 1990, and I continued to watch it faithfully for years. Even now, I will occasionally tune in to the reruns that appear nightly on A&amp;E, hoping to catch one of those great old episodes from the first few seasons; I have seen many of them two or three times, and they still hold up. But the constant presence of the past has its downside, too. If you watch the George Dzundza-Chris Noth-Michael Moriarty version of ''Law and Order'' on any given evening, it makes it almost impossible to sit still for the Jerry Orbach-Jesse L. Martin-Sam Waterston tripe that is currently masquerading under the same name.</p>
        <p>This is not entirely or even primarily the fault of the actors. Mr. Orbach and Mr. Waterston are both very talented guys, in their way. (One can't, alas, say the same of Mr. Martin; he is even more wooden than Benjamin Bratt, who preceded him.) But their way is overstatement -- the kind of in-your-face intensity that can verge on self-parody, and that perfectly suits the present high-concept version of the show. ''Crimes ripped from the headlines,'' promos for ''Law and Order'' have boasted in recent years, and that is indeed what we've increasingly been getting: rich-people murders, Hollywood murders, politician murders, all sounding dubiously familiar. There are no unexpected twists in these plots, no thoughtful explorations of case law, no moral difficulties for the viewer to grapple with, no subtleties of any kind. The minute you finish watching the first full scene about the murder, you know exactly how the rest of the show will play out.</p>
        <p>It was not always thus. In the beginning, ''Law and Order'' kept you on your toes every second. It contained virtually no explication. Scene changes were rapid and instructive and you had to read subtitles to understand them. (Written scene titles continue to appear, but they now convey no essential information: if you ignored them, you could still follow the silly plots.) The two homicide cops who worked the crime scenes knew obscure, significant things about city life; the show's writers knew things about city life, and they conveyed this knowledge to us obliquely. If, on occasion, a brief interrogation took place in Spanish or a witness spoke to someone in Chinese, these exchanges wouldn't be translated; you had to pick up the meaning through the context. The series, during its first few seasons, was smart and gritty and very, very New York -- the old New York, that is, the one that existed before they spiffed up Times Square.</p>
        <p>In the original ''Law and Order,'' there was always a weird twist, and you never knew when to expect it: sometimes it came up early in the cops' investigation, and sometimes it didn't occur until three-quarters of the way through the hour, well into the courtroom scenes. Nor did the legal questions have to be begged to produce the surprise. I'm no lawyer, but those court scenes struck me as much more factually based and logically argued than most of what we get on television, including Court TV. You never knew which cases the D.A.'s team would win or lose -- at times you weren't even sure whether you wanted them to win or lose -- and the show would often end on a note of ambiguity, or cynicism, or even despair. This ''Law and Order'' was not your usual snappy television show, and it seemed willing, for a while, to resist its audience's weakness for snappy TV.</p>
        <p>But gradually, being television, it began to change in response to the ratings. It began to flatten out its own difficult contours, shift into a smoother gear -- and in doing so it garnered larger audiences, multitudinous Emmy nominations, reams of bland critical accolades and all the usual status symbols of a successful television series. This revised ''Law and Order'' preserved an outer semblance of the original two-part structure -- the pairing that attracted both cop-show addicts and courtroom-drama fans, and that justified its binary title -- but it gave up on the rigors and complexities of that structure, often allowing one part to bleed sloppily over into the other. Like a sonnet, the original ''Law and Order'' strictly adhered to its form: a half-hour of police investigation followed by a half-hour of lawyerly activity. Again like a sonnet, the show worked wondrous variations on that form, and a great deal of the pleasure lay in seeing how much creativity could be displayed within those confines.</p>
        <p>I say ''the original 'Law and Order,' '' but what I am describing is a phenomenon that was always in transition, so it is hard to pinpoint the exact moment it went from being good to being bad. Television, like theater and film, is an ensemble art; it has many movable parts. Like its sister arts, it depends on the multiple and various strengths of writers, actors and directors, any one of whom might or might not be essential for the whole thing to work. But when you see a movie or a play, you complete the entire artistic experience with the same ensemble intact. You get to the end and you see the thing whole, and that's what makes it artful. A television series is, as a form of art, more like life: it begins to disintegrate almost the moment it starts, and the members of the ensemble are constantly disappearing. Of course, they can always be replaced, but -- as with life -- the replacements aren't necessarily as satisfying as the originals.</p>
        <p>I hope I will someday see again a television ensemble as perfect as the first season's cast of ''Law and Order.'' George Dzundza and Chris Noth (neither of whom I'd ever seen on television before) were terrific as the grounded, older, married cop and the brash, handsome, younger one; there was real chemistry to their partnership, and each was appealing in a different way. Dann Florek was excellent as their precinct captain (much better than he is now on the trashy ''Law and Order: Special Victims Unit,'' where he has to preside over exclusively sleazy crimes and a squad room of camera-conscious television stars). Mr. Hill was eminently satisfactory as the elected district attorney, Richard Brooks was persuasive and dignified in the role of Assistant District Attorney Paul Robinette, and Michael Moriarty was absolutely thrilling as Assistant District Attorney Ben Stone. Mr. Moriarty has one of those cellolike voices that can practically make a television drama. (David Caruso served this function on the first season of ''N.Y.P.D. Blue,'' and John Spencer plays a similar role now on ''The West Wing.'' When a show has a voice like this, you can actually hear the writers composing for it -- giving it the kind of expressive, cohesive lines that it alone can deliver sincerely.) And, as Ben Stone, Mr. Moriarty also had a remarkable ability to convey thought without words, to show intelligence and shock and disapproval and sadness passing across his face in response to other actors' lines and gestures. But Mr. Moriarty wasn't the only actor who could do this, that first season; they all could, to some extent, and that's partly what made the show great.</p>
        <p>OF course, the cast had no diversity whatsoever: the core cast included too many Irishmen and Jews, no women, no Hispanics or Italians, only one African-American. So Mr. Florek got replaced by a black woman, S. Epatha Merkerson, who took on the role of Lieutenant Van Buren (she had previously appeared in a first-season episode as the mother of a perp, or a vic, or possibly both), and Mr. Dzundza got killed off to make room for Paul Sorvino. At first I thought I would resent these changes bitterly, but the show went on pretty much as before, and I came to like these two actors almost as much as their predecessors. Then Paul Sorvino gave way to Jerry Orbach -- O.K., I survived that too -- and Richard Brooks got replaced by a succession of pretty young women, each slightly more annoying than the previous one. (Actually, the current occupant of the assistant D.A. role, Angie Harmon, is vastly more annoying than either Jill Hennessy or Carey Lowell was; her voice is like fingernails on a blackboard, and her face registers only a single expression.) When Michael Moriarty got ousted by Sam Waterston, the show's condition was clearly terminal, but I held on for the sake of Chris Noth. It was only when Noth left -- later to reappear in the weirdest places, like HBO's ''Sex and the City'' and the Broadway revival ''Gore Vidal's 'The Best Man' '' -- that I knew my ''Law and Order'' no longer existed.</p>
        <p>I've tuned in a few times each season in the years since, and I've always been disappointed. To a certain extent, this is inevitable: after all, I was even disappointed by the second season of ''The Sopranos,'' and that was better than anything on TV except the first season of ''The Sopranos.'' When something is really terrific, what follows will always be a letdown. A television series, by definition, consists of what follows, and if a show is really successful it will inevitably stay on the air past its spoilage date. Still, I find the steady decline of ''Law and Order'' much more frustrating than the average deterioration of the average show.</p>
        <p>Do I resent the fact that the dumbed-down show became the popular, successful one, when most people never even saw the good version that preceded it? You bet I do. Do I believe that a single good actor like Dianne Wiest, or even a single good executive producer like Arthur Penn, can come in at this point and bring back what's been lost? Frankly, no, though I wish them both well. Would I argue that the show should have been killed off while it was still in its prime? Not vehemently. I try to be philosophical about these things. Let ''Law and Order'' limp along in its current state as best it can -- I won't object, as long as we can still catch those early episodes on A&amp;E.</p>
