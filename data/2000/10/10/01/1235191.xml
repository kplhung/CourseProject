        <p>The spiffy new subway trains were unveiled to much fanfare in July. By late next year, they are expected to replace the city's oldest fleet of trains, known as the Redbirds, which have been operating since the 1950's.</p>
        <p>But at the moment, the chances of catching a ride on one of the new models is about as good as contracting the West Nile virus -- at least that's what it feels like. Only two 10-car trains are currently running, out of the 5,800 cars in the system, as part of a trial until the city is convinced that they work properly. As to when the rest of the 1,080-car fleet would begin rolling, Deirdre Parker, a spokeswoman for the New York City Transit Authority, said only, ''When testing is complete,'' probably by the end of 2001.</p>
        <p>The first train out of the gates, a Kawasaki known affectionately as R142A, has been riding the No. 6 line since July 10. The second car, a Bombardier called R142, made its premiere on the No. 2 line a few days later. Both have been running entire routes, but they are sometimes pulled off the line for repairs.</p>
        <p>Though the sleek new trains have wider doors than the Redbirds and more extensive hand grabs, their greatest appeal lies in high-tech components like digital sign boards, a public announcement system with recorded announcements and subway maps that light up to show where the rider is on the route.</p>
        <p>Although the new trains run on a timetable, the Transit Authority won't divulge the schedule so as to avoid disappointing riders. ''It's a catch-as-catch-can thing,'' Ms. Parker said.</p>
        <p>Happily for subway buffs, some Web sites contain unofficial schedules of the new cars' comings and goings (see http://www.nycsubway. org/faq/r142faq.html#schedule, or http://members.aol.com/orentree/ R142.htm).</p>
        <p>Chat rooms devoted to subway gossip, like Subtalklive (http:// www.nycsubway.org/cgi-bin/ subtalk.cgi) contain comments about the whereabouts of the trains.</p>
