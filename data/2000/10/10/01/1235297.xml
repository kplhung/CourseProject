        <p>The House candidates in Michigan's Eighth Congressional District seem so committed to being nice that they have trouble explaining why people should vote for them and not the opposition.</p>
        <p>The two state senators running for an open seat debated here on Wednesday, and while they talked a lot about their own views in general terms, they hardly ever criticized each other. Diane Byrum, the Democrat, said that ''personal negative attacks have no place in this campaign.'' Mike Rogers, the Republican, said, ''If you look at the ads I have run, there is not a negative ad there, and there won't be.''</p>
        <p>This tossup contest, for a seat being vacated by Representative Debbie Stabenow, who is running for United States Senate, is crucial as Democrats seek the seven-seat gain that would give them a House majority. And it is no tea party, with the candidates' supporters happy to fill the void in negativity.</p>
        <p>The Michigan Republican Party, for example, is running an all-out attack advertisement, blaming Ms. Byrum for missing a vote on education ''while she counted her campaign cash'' at a fund-raising reception. ''Byrum has taken money from casino interests,'' it says, and urges viewers: ''Call Diane Byrum. Ask why she put herself before Michigan school kids.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Byrum acknowledged missing the one vote, but said she voted for the bill on several other occasions.</p>
        <p>On the other side is Emily's List, a group that raises money for Democratic women, like Ms. Byrum, who favor abortion rights. It put out a flier here showing an old woman and asking, ''Who would take away her guaranteed future protection?'' It asked readers to tell Mr. Rogers ''not to sacrifice your Social Security to pay back his wealthy friends.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rogers has called Gov. George W. Bush's proposed $1.3 trillion tax cut too big, and said he favored voluntary private investment of some Social Security taxes only if benefits, tax levels and retirement ages would not have to be altered.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rogers also said in an interview today that Ms. Byrum's backers were conducting push-polling, a technique denounced by professional pollsters in which a caller claims to be conducting a poll but asks loaded questions. Charles Mack, a chaplain at Michigan State University, said he had received a call from a Spokane company, and indicated that he was undecided. Then he was asked if he would be more likely to support Ms. Byrum if he knew she favored things like smaller class size and better-trained teachers.</p>
        <p>Unlike some push-polling calls, this one did not attack Mr. Rogers. He said he thought the Michigan Education Association, which has endorsed his rival, was behind the calls.</p>
        <p>Al Short, director of governmental affairs for the teachers group, said, ''That is not happening.'' The group's material is sent only to members, he said, and praises Ms. Byrum but does not attack Mr. Rogers, whom he praised for supporting some of the group's positions.</p>
        <p>There is plenty of reason for supporters to pitch in. The latest public poll showed Mr. Rogers with a statistically insignificant edge of 42 to 40 percent. Rusty Hills, chairman of the Michigan Republican Party, predicted that the race would stay close. ''We'll be counting until 4 o'clock in the morning,'' Mr. Hills said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Byrum has the support of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., with 39,000 members in the district, and the Michigan Education Association, with 12,000. The Fraternal Order of Police endorsed them both. A hardware store owner, Ms. Byrum has good relations with business, too. The state chamber of commerce backed Mr. Rogers, but the Lansing chamber supported her.</p>
        <p>Each candidate has national issues to argue. On Wednesday, in the closest thing to a slap at Mr. Rogers, Ms. Byrum said: ''My opponent and George Bush believe we should have a large across-the-board tax cut. If you do that, you do not have any money to put into targeted tax cuts, to put into Social Security, to put into strengthening Medicare.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rogers attacked over commitment of American troops abroad, and said, ''I think it's going to take some very strong leadership to get America back off her knees and respected around the world.''</p>
        <p>THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: MICHIGAN  Correction:  October 4, 2000, Wednesday  An article on Sunday about the campaign for Michigan's Eighth Congressional District misspelled the given name of the Democratic candidate. She is Dianne Byrum, not Diane.</p>
        <p>In some copies the article also misstated the title of the Republican candidate, Mike Rogers. He is the majority floor leader of the State Senate, not the majority leader.</p>
