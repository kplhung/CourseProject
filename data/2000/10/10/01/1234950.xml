        <p>''When I was a boy there was but one permanent ambition among my comrades in our village on the West bank of the Mississippi River. That was to be a steamboatman.'' -- Mark Twain, ''Life on the Mississippi.''</p>
        <p>YOU think it's going to be just another cruise until they blow the whistle.</p>
        <p>That's the steamboat whistle, and what a sound it is: nothing less than the voice of the American past. We were sauntering toward Ol' Man River along the Robin Street Wharf in New Orleans, mildly cranky that we'd been unable to linger forever over lunch at Commander's Palace. But we were dutifully making our way to the Mississippi mooring of the world's largest paddlewheel steamboat, the American Queen.</p>
        <p>That's when its four-foot brass whistle cut loose. There is the urgency of departure here, the reverberation of countless partings. But it is also the joyful sound of running free on the Mississippi, the rush of challenging the fogbound dangers of the ever-shifting channels. And there is warmth and welcome in this bellow. It says, all aboard: we are safe, we are dry, we offer food and drink and fellowship and fun.</p>
        <p>And so, as the whistle shrilled, my wife, Sarah, and I began pressing forward, eager to get to our cabin, to find our bags, and to push off for our four-night Huck Finn adventure. The phrase ''paddlewheel steamer'' conjures up cigar-chomping card sharks, fiery whiskey, and a fierier Ava Gardner on the levee in ''Show Boat,'' trying to conceal her Creole provenance. But we really had no idea what to expect.</p>
        <p>The notion of a paddleboat cruise also threatened discomfort, and we wondered whether this jaunt might be cramped and interminable. If we were entering cruise-ship hell, well, both of us had taken good books.</p>
        <p>But to give away the ending right here: the trip exceeded our expectations in almost every respect, and hardly the least of the entertainments was the mighty Mississippi itself.</p>
        <p>The Delta Queen Steamboat Company offers a confounding variety of cruises ranging from 3 to 14 nights. Our four-night voyage paddled away from New Orleans and made Louisiana stops along the Mississippi at the Oak Alley Plantation, St. Francisville and Baton Rouge.</p>
        <p>Our flight from Newark arrived shortly after 9 A.M. on a Thursday; the boat wouldn't leave until 7 P.M. So we took a taxi to the wharf and checked our bags with the American Queen porters. The day was ours: a grace period, a bit of time to make a leisurely reconnection with the Big Easy. Back on the air-conditioned American Queen our bags awaited us in the cabin. The requisite chocolate was on the pillow, as well as a room key and a way-cool plastic dining card imprinted with our names and our dinner-table assignment.</p>
        <p>Traveling frugally, we had taken an inside cabin on Texas Deck with two single beds and absolutely no river view at the two-person discount rate of $2,100 (passengers  can spend as much as $9,240 a person for a two-week cruise).</p>
        <p>Though we had jokingly fretted about Lusitania steerage, the 10-by-10-foot cabin and seven--by-four-and-a-half-foot bathroom were snug but not oppressively small, offering two single beds and a shower.</p>
        <p>Our cabin, named for the Rosedown Plantation, was hardly spare: we found floral wallpaper, floral-print bedspreads, a wrought-iron headboard, Victorianish lighting fixtures and pretty steamboat prints on the bulkheads.</p>
        <p>The cabin did present one challenge: the toilet would not flush. (This turned out to be a boatwide problem afflicting the vacuum-powered system; it was fixed by dinner time.) We wandered about the six-deck, 418-foot-long sternwheeler, charmed by its bright brasswork, cut-glass doors and the abundance of chandeliers (which Mark Twain, referring to a long-ago paddlewheeler, described as ''an April shower of glittering glass-drops'').</p>
        <p>There were parquet floors in the Grand Saloon, hunting trophies in the Gentlemen's Card Room, and wicker and rattan furniture in the cheery veranda called -- appropriately -- the Front Porch of America.</p>
        <p>The American Queen still looks new (it was launched in 1995 with the breaking of the world's largest bottle of McIlhenny Tabasco Sauce). It is, in a sense, a fantasy of the Victorian steamboat, built from archival plans and photos from the golden age, including the J. M. White, the most lavish of the floating hotels, built in 1878 for an unheard of sum, around $250,000, according to the Delta Queen Steamboat Company.</p>
        <p>If the Queen is a regal sight, its over-the-top opulence is not exactly that of the Hotel Carlyle. But gold swag curtains in the dining room are hardly bad form on a luxury paddlewheeler. Its antiques include 100-year-old fireplaces and an 1891 grand piano. On deck, the Queen's steamboat-Gothic curlicues, fretwork embellishment and filigree trim seem appropriate, justifying such 19th-century hyperbole as ''floating wedding cake,'' ''gingerbread palace'' and ''glory boat.''</p>
        <p>Though it isn't a gambling steamer, the vessel offers an abundance of other amusements. Within minutes we parked our skeptical New York attitudes and became hooked on the nightly 6:45 P.M. show in the Grand Saloon on the Main Deck. Thankfully, the shows never took themselves seriously. There was, of course, a ''Show Boat'' medley (what could be finer than hearing ''Ol' Man River'' belted out while heading up the Mississippi?). Other revues included a tongue-in-cheek salute to Hollywood and a hugely entertaining rock 'n roll parody, all performed by four singers with strong musical-theater voices accompanied by a seven-member orchestra, the Steamboatin' Syncopaters.</p>
        <p>Big-band dancing in the Grand Saloon, pianoman soirees at the Captain's Bar and lounge-act dancing and carrying on in the Engine Room Bar were among additional diversions. Each day, in the Texas Deck theater, there was a first-run movie video we wanted to see, but on-shore options had a stronger pull. On some days the attraction was the just-barely-large-enough workout center, with its half-dozen bikes and treadmills and small pool.</p>
        <p>Another draw was the spectacle of the calliope on Promenade Deck. This instrument, with its 37 gold-plated brass pipes, is driven by live steam and produces just about the happiest sound there is.</p>
        <p>We often sought the wisdom of the boat's ''Riverlorian,'' Clara Christensen, an onboard lore-dispenser and lecturer. She was available much of the day, overseeing the quaint Chart Room where riverboat-pilot wish-they-weres could consult maps of the Mississippi.</p>
        <p>Each day, shuttle buses delivered passengers from the boat's moorings to towns, antebellum plantations and cities. Guided tours, selected by the Delta Queen company and run by local residents, were of high quality. For example, after our first breakfast on the Mississippi, we strolled down a landing stage and headed for a tour of Laura: A Creole Plantation, in Vacherie, La. Our guide was the owner, Norman Marmillion, who over the past seven years has orchestrated the 1805 plantation's restoration.</p>
        <p>The project has preserved 4 of the original 69 slave cabins where, according to Mr. Marmillion, tales  from African-American folklore,  similar to those told by Joel Chandler Harris, the Georgian author of the Br'er Rabbit stories, were first recorded. He said they were collected in Creole French at Laura and other plantations by the folklorist Alcee Fortier, and that the translations were adapted by Harris for his stories.</p>
        <p>Next day, at a new mooring, we toured St. Francisville (population 1,716) and headed for Catalpa Plantation, where John James Audubon worked as a tutor, and the Myrtles Plantation, said to be ''one of America's most haunted houses.''</p>
        <p>IF we adopted a New Orleans attitude toward the daily tours and amusements -- too much ain't enough -- in truth, the grandest show was the simplest: the Mississippi. It is nothing less than the river of the American soul. For us, there was no greater satisfaction than lounging on the spacious deck, watching Louisiana go by as we steamed through bend after bend, enjoying the parade of plantations, port facilities and overgrown riverbank; even the odd tanker dock looked picturesque.</p>
        <p>As river neophytes, we had wondered about seasickness, but for most of the journey there was little sensation of being on a boat, save for the faint but reassuring vibration of the engines and the swift pageant of the riverbank.</p>
        <p>The American Queen also offered some little-boy thrills for passengers fascinated by things nautical, especially by the workings of a modern steamboat. For example, the 30-foot-wide, 45-ton, bright red paddlewheel is fitted with wooden ''boards'' (more easily replaced, and less dangerous, than steel if the paddles break when hitting river debris).</p>
        <p>And an engineering fanfare was achieved with the lowering of the two black, feathery-crowned smokestacks (the 42-foot above-deck sections lower on hydraulic hinges), to pass under a river-spanning power line.</p>
        <p>The boat seems to take as its culinary prime directive the cruise-ship maxim that customers ''shall come on as passengers and shall leave as cargo.'' The five-course dinners in the 226-seat dining room offered choices that always included indigenous specialties such as gumbo with andouille sausage, crawfish etoufee, and fried green tomatoes.</p>
        <p>The food could be quite good, as when the salmon and the redfish appeared; alas, the tournedos of beef offered a fine cut of meat that was devoid of taste, and it was thumbs down on the scallops en papillote, with six small cold scallops in a tasteless crust. The heart-healthy options were always safe, despite the nightly changing, but never-relenting dessert menu, which included such options as the decadent bread pudding in bourbon sauce, the sugar-free peach pie and the bananas Foster.</p>
        <p>With its crew of 180, the Queen has a passenger capacity of 436 in 222 cabins; our cruise was fully booked with people from 19 states, Germany and Britain. The passengers, many but by no means all of whom were getting up in years, dressed in, well, sort of golfing duds for most of the cruise, donning suits and ties (but not tuxes) and dressy jewelry for such occasions as the Captain's Reception and the Captain's Dinner.</p>
        <p>It seemed that those happiest on the Queen were the passengers on family reunions, travelers who were inveterate learners or who had the history bug, and those with an appreciation of the Midwest. The unhappiest seemed to be young singles, teenagers and hypercritical Manhattanites bereft of their real-time Dow Jones Internet quotes.</p>
        <p>Many passengers on our cruise were repeat visitors. ''I just loved it then and I love it now,'' said Esther Ramsay, of Redmond, Ore., who took her first steamboat trip in 1977 and described herself as ''a retiree who loves to have fun.''</p>
        <p>In the end, our jaunt was a voyage of days so filled with promise that we couldn't wait to get up in the morning. And happily, when the steamboat moored at our last landing on Monday morning, we found ourselves ashore in the home of laissez les bons temps rouler: New Orleans, not exactly the worst alternative to life on the Mississippi.</p>
        <p>Two hours before our flight home, we wandered down Bourbon Street, only to be caught in an impromptu, pseudo-Mardi Gras parade through the French Quarter. Masked revelers pelted us with classic shiny-bead necklaces. Grateful for the gifts, we draped them around our necks as amulets to ward off the sinister influence of mundanity as we headed to the airport.</p>
        <p>Costs on the Queens and stops on the river</p>
        <p>River Voyages</p>
        <p>The Delta Queen Steamboat Company runs 3-to-14-night river cruises on the 436-passenger American Queen and its smaller sister riverboats, the Delta Queen (174 passengers) and the Mississippi Queen (416). Information: Robin Street Wharf, 1380 Port of New Orleans Place, New Orleans, La. 70130; (504) 586-0631 or (800) 543-1949; www  .deltaqueen.com.</p>
        <p>Offerings include trips on the Upper and Lower Mississippi; the Ohio River; West Virginia's Kanawha River; the Tennessee; the Cumberland from Paducah, Ky., to Nashville; the Illinois, upriver from St. Louis; and the Intracoastal Waterway from New Orleans to Galveston, Tex.</p>
        <p>Costs range from $495 to $2,035 for a 3-night cruise, $1,070 to $4,660 for 7 nights, and $2,060 to $9.240 for 14 nights; all prices are per person double occupancy, including port charges.</p>
        <p>The lowest-end rooms are inside cabins, with twin beds and a bathroom with shower; the most expensive suites include private verandas.</p>
        <p>There is occasional discounting; through our travel agent we got a couple's discount, so that my fare cost $1,400 and my wife's cost $700, for a total of $2,100. Travelers often need to make reservations months ahead.</p>
        <p>Our cabin had no TV but a four-channel cabin radio offered live audio from CNN Headline News.</p>
        <p>Trips Ashore</p>
        <p>American Queen passengers paid $34 a person for their tour combining both the Laura and Oak Alley Plantations.</p>
        <p>The aristocratic French life of New Orleans and the Creole life of the plantations are described during the visit to Laura, which is at 2247 Highway 18, Vacherie, La. 70090;  (225) 265-7690. The Web site is www  .lauraplantation.com. Vacherie is 35 miles northwest of New Orleans.</p>
        <p>Oak Alley Plantation is at 3645 Highway 18, Vacherie, La. 70090; (225) 265-2151. The Web site is</p>
        <p>www.oakalleyplantation.com. It  takes its name from the quarter-mile row of 28 live oak trees, planted nearly 300 years ago, that lead from the gate at River Road to the mansion.</p>
        <p>As part of our tour of St. Francisville, we visited the Catalpa Plantation, 9508 Old U.S. 61, St. Francisville, La. 70775; (225) 635-3372. The owner, Mary Thompson, greeted us with coffee in bone-china cups as well as sherry in cut-glass tumblers. She led a vivid and eccentric tour through the house showing her exquisite, five-generation collection of china, silver, enamels and paintings. Afterward we were taken by bus to the Myrtles Plantation, 7747 U.S. 61, St. Francisville, La. 70775; (225) 635-6277. (The American Queen tour visiting both Catalpa and the Myrtles cost $48 a person.)</p>
        <p>Built in 1796 by Gen. David Bradford, a leader of the Whiskey Rebellion in Pennsylvania two years earlier, the mansion at the Myrtles  has been called ''one of America's most haunted houses.'' The sunny mansion gives little hint of its murder-marred past in the ordered display of its Baccarat crystal chandeliers, Aubusson tapestries and Carrara marble mantels.</p>
        <p>We also took the Cajun Heritage Tour ($48 for American Queen passengers), which included a half-hour bus ride to the Bayview Tavern in Port Vincent, La., a local music hangout on the bayou. Deborah White, our wry tour guide, proved to be an irrepressible storyteller on Louisiana politics.</p>
        <p>At the Bayview we listened to a talk about Cajun history and were treated to an all-out Cajun party,  with music, Cajun dancing and jambalaya, the traditional spicy stew of rice, seafood and chicken.</p>
        <p>Information on the tour is available at the Bayview Tavern, 17510 Highway 16, Port Vincent, La. 70726; (225) 698-3147.</p>
