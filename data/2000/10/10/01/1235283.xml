        <p>The campaign debate over prescription drugs for the elderly has become a confusing muddle of partisan charges and countercharges, with both sides invoking the standard bogymen of health care debates, from ''big government'' to ''H.M.O. bureaucrats.''</p>
        <p>But a few things are clear, health analysts say.</p>
        <p>It is very difficult for the average Medicare beneficiary to sit down with the Bush and Gore plans and compare how much she would pay in premiums and co-payments and how much she would receive in benefits. That is because the approaches of the two candidates are so different, and there are so many unknowns about Gov. George W. Bush's plan.</p>
        <p>Given what is known, many analysts and consumer advocates consider Vice President Al Gore's plan to be more generous; he would devote much more money to it, they note, and he promises a higher federal subsidy for premiums. Mr. Bush's health care advisers counter that his plan offers more flexibility and more choices for older Americans.</p>
        <p>For all the promises, experts say none of the drug benefits being proposed for Medicare are as generous as what many working people routinely receive. But critics of entitlement programs are already complaining about expanding benefits in a program with long-term financial problems.</p>
        <p>This often arcane policy discussion is occurring in a white-hot political environment. Few would have predicted it two years ago, but the cost of prescription drugs -- and the lack of Medicare coverage for them -- has remained at the top of the political agenda in this campaign. In the most recent New York Times/CBS News Poll, 65 percent of those surveyed, including 71 percent of the women, said reducing the costs of prescription drugs for the elderly mattered ''a lot'' to them.</p>
        <p>Health care and Medicare combined overshadowed most other issues when voters were asked to list their concerns, giving a taste of what politicians will increasingly confront in an aging society.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore, like other Democrats, has made the issue a centerpiece of his campaign, berating the pharmaceutical industry for putting profits ahead of people and reiterating his promise of relief with a 74-page campaign credo, ''Medicare at a Crossroads.'' He would add a prescription drug benefit to the traditional Medicare program.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush, who spoke little about the issue in the primaries, has increasingly focused on prescription drugs as the campaign has progressed. His enemy, though, is not the drug industry but the prospect of ''big government'' intervention that could stymie innovation and force the elderly into a ''one-size-fits-all'' government plan. Like other Republicans, Mr. Bush would rely heavily on the private health insurance industry -- H.M.O.'s and other managed care companies -- to deliver drug benefits to the elderly.</p>
        <p>The philosophical differences, in short, are stark, and they are reflected in the plans -- and the difficulty in making apples-to-apples comparisons.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush takes a two-track approach. For the first four years, he would send $48 billion to the states to help low-income elderly people, including those with annual incomes up to about $14,600. This accounts for Mr. Gore's claim that the Bush plan would force the elderly into welfare offices for prescription drugs.</p>
        <p>Down the road, Mr. Bush sees drug benefits as an outgrowth of his proposal to transform Medicare, a fairly traditional government insurance program, into an arena for competing private health plans. (Only about 16 percent of Medicare beneficiaries are now in H.M.O.'s.) Those H.M.O.'s and other health networks, all vying for the business of Medicare beneficiaries, would be required to offer the elderly a ''high option'' plan that covers drugs. (So would the federal government, for those who choose to stay with traditional Medicare.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush promises a federal subsidy for those prescription drug premium costs of 25 percent -- more for the low-income elderly. And Mr. Bush would create a catastrophic benefit that would kick in when the elderly's out-of-pocket bills hit $6,000.</p>
        <p>Still, many of the details of this plan are left up to a future White House task force, the Congress and the private marketplace: for example, how much would the basic drug benefit be worth? What would the basic package look like in the Bush plan? What would be the deductibles, the co-payments and the like?</p>
        <p>''It's very difficult for anyone to say how this would affect me or my mother,'' said Diane Rowland, an expert on Medicare at the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, a health research group.</p>
        <p>Because of the emphasis on the private marketplace, said Ron Pollack, head of the consumer advocacy group Families USA, ''different people in the same state would have considerably different benefits and considerably different cost-sharing requirements.'' And, he added, Mr. Bush ''simply does not define what that would be.''</p>
        <p>Sally Canfield, a health adviser to the Bush campaign, said, ''We did not want to hamstring the task force on how they wanted to set up the benefit.'' Democrats and their allies suggest another rationale: the Republicans are avoiding details that can be used against them, as they are now using the size of the Gore premium against the Democrats.</p>
        <p>Kenneth E. Thorpe, a professor of health policy at Emory University and a former top analyst in the Clinton administration, argued that the average premium under the Bush plan was bound to be substantially higher, in large part because Mr. Bush would provide a lower subsidy than Mr. Gore, and because private health plans would have higher administrative costs.</p>
        <p>In general, the price of Mr. Bush's Medicare proposal, including the restructuring proposals and prescription drugs, is $158 billion over 10 years, according to the Bush campaign. Mr. Gore proposes spending $338 billion on prescription drugs alone, according to Congressional Budget Office estimates, over that same period.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore would offer a drug benefit under the traditional Medicare program, available to older Americans for an additional monthly premium, which would start at $25 a month in 2002 and double over the next decade. It would be a voluntary benefit; people could choose it or waive it. But if they sign up, Mr. Gore says, the federal government would subsidize half the real cost of the drug premiums.</p>
        <p>The benefit would not have a deductible. It would cover half the cost of prescriptions up to $5,000 a year when fully implemented. It would also provide protection against catastrophic drug costs that kicked in when a beneficiary's out-of-pocket costs hit $4,000 a year. And it would provide more assistance to low-income people.</p>
        <p>The Gore campaign offers the example of a widow with $610 of prescription drugs to buy each month, or $7,320 a year. It assumes she would receive a 10 percent discount (subtract $732) for being part of a drug plan. Medicare would pay half of the first $5,000 of her bills; she would pay the rest. After her bills reached $5,000, she would be responsible on her own until she reached the $4,000 cap on out-of-pocket drug costs.</p>
        <p>Medicare would then pick up the rest. The result: the widow would pay $4,000 for her drugs. Medicare would provide $3,320 in benefits.</p>
        <p>The Republican critique of this plan in the past few weeks has focused on the size of the premiums and what Republicans assert is the inflexibility of its ''big government'' approach.</p>
        <p>Advertising produced for the Republican National Committee refers to a $600 annual ''big government access fee,'' the yearly premiums for the Gore plan when it is fully implemented a decade from now. Republicans have noted that beneficiaries could pay more in premiums than they receive in benefits, although experts note that this is the case with all kinds of insurance.</p>
        <p>Experts see the debate over prescription drugs, at its roots, as a clash of visions for Medicare: should health coverage for older Americans largely remain a government-run social insurance program, with a standard package of benefits for rich and poor, sick and well alike, and everyone sharing the risks? Or should it move more aggressively toward simply giving older Americans a fixed payment, which they can use to purchase the private plan of their choice?</p>
        <p>''The notion that there is a plan that will meet everybody's needs is wrong,'' argues Dr. Gail Wilensky, a Bush health adviser.</p>
        <p>Not surprisingly, all this focus on prescription drug relief, and the elderly in general, has given rise to something of a backlash. Critics of entitlement programs are deriding what Peter G. Peterson, the author and former commerce secretary, calls ''a rich menu of free lunches'' instead of the ''hard and honest choices'' needed to shore up Medicare for the long haul. But health analysts note that nobody is proposing prescription drug coverage for retirees that is nearly as generous as what most working people receive.</p>
        <p>''There are big differences among the Medicare proposals on the table, but in all cases those plans are suggesting benefits for the elderly that are quite a bit less generous than what the typical worker has today,'' said Larry Levitt, vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, which recently conducted a survey of employer-based plans.</p>
        <p>It comes down to a Catch-22 for the elderly: because their use of drugs is so high, because so many of the newer (and more expensive) drugs are aimed at chronic conditions that disproportionately affect older people, and because the ranks of Medicare beneficiaries will steadily rise, doubling in the next 30 years, the government simply cannot afford to match what working people get.</p>
        <p>''Even if we enact a prescription drug benefit, it won't put the problem to rest for long,'' said Robert Reischauer, president of the Urban Institute. ''Policy makers will be readdressing this issue again before the decade is out, because the underlying trends are so powerful and the coverage is so basic.''</p>
