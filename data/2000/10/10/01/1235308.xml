        <p>John Schuerholz was beaming. He knew he was beaming. ''I'm beaming,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Minutes earlier, the Atlanta Braves had completed their run to a ninth consecutive division championship. Think of that number. Nine. Has any other team in Major League Baseball won division titles nine times in a row? The answer is no.</p>
        <p>''I think it's an absolutely remarkable accomplishment,'' said Schuerholz, who could be excused if he was feeling giddy in the aftermath of the Braves' clinching last Tuesday. ''In this day and age, with all of the challenges of keeping rosters together and creating a winning team, when these things shouldn't happen, once, twice, nine times? Come on.''</p>
        <p>It is postseason time, and the Braves are part of it again. Can anyone remember when they haven't been a part of it?</p>
        <p>But the Braves haven't just won division titles. From their second championship season through last season, they won the most games in the National League each year. Entering the weekend, they had a chance to have the most victories this season, too. The only time they did not have the most victories was in the streak's first season, 1991. The Pittsburgh Pirates won four more games that year.</p>
        <p>It is no coincidence that the Braves' streak began in Schuerholz's first season as general manager. It is most interesting that Schuerholz was able to replace Bobby Cox as general manager and work smoothly with Cox as manager.</p>
        <p>''With most people it would be difficult,'' Schuerholz said about that potentially awkward situation. ''But he made it so easy for me because of who he is and the kind of guy he is. We have known each other for a long time. There's a mutual respect that's existed for a long time. So we've worked together very well. I respected the job he did before I got there, so it was easy. He thought I would do a good job. He told everybody that. I knew he would do a good job because I tried to hire him before as manager. So it was an easy relationship to craft and to grow.''</p>
        <p>The relationship is as strong as ever. A rumor popped up recently, suggesting that Cox would leave his job after this season and be replaced by Jimy Williams, whose status in Boston is questionable. Not so, Cox said firmly. He's not retiring, and Schuerholz is not asking him to retire.</p>
        <p>''We work together so well, I know what he wants; he knows what we have to do,'' Schuerholz said. ''There's no trying to guess what we're trying to accomplish. He and I are on the same page all the time.''</p>
        <p>One of the beauties of the Braves is they make changes each winter and don't miss a beat the following season. Schuerholz gets good players, and Cox fits them in seamlessly.</p>
        <p>''They aren't always the guys who are the most highly thought of,'' Schuerholz said, ''but they're the guys who have the ability and the makeup and the character to be championship-caliber people. We get enough of them to win championships every year. It seems like every time we construct a new roster and give it to Bobby and his coaches, they make champions out of them. That's a pretty comforting feeling.''</p>
        <p>Some people believe a winning team has to make changes to keep players from becoming complacent, but Schuerholz said that is not the reason he shuffles the roster.</p>
        <p>''It's not intentional,'' he said. ''The changes are not by design. Some are, but some are a reaction to a need to control and manage our payroll. We look for ways to keep our team together at a certain range of pay and we have to change some guys, a position here, a position there. Our scouts do a remarkable job. They know the kind of people we want. They bring us the kind of guys we need.''</p>
        <p>The Braves will continue to be criticized for not winning the World Series more than once, but there is as much, if not more, to be said for maintaining the championship level of play they have demonstrated over so many 162-game seasons. The Yankees have won three of the last four World Series, but those seasons were the only ones in which they finished first. The two other times in the past five years that they were in the playoffs, they finished second and qualified as the wild card. The Braves have never been the wild card.</p>
        <p>No. 5,529 Beats the Clock</p>
        <p>Michael Tucker of Cincinnati broke a significant record last week and may not have even known it. Without fanfare, the major league home run record fell last Wednesday, and it was Tucker who struck the record-breaking blow.</p>
        <p>The home run total going into that day's games was 5,526, two away from the record, which was set last season. Darin Erstad of Anaheim hit the day's first home run, and in the fifth inning of the day's only afternoon game, Terrence Long of Oakland connected against Mike Holtz for No. 5,528.</p>
        <p>That evening, several games began shortly after 7 p.m. Eastern time. Tucker and Shannon Stewart of Toronto led off their games and slugged home runs, Tucker on the third pitch from Paul Rigdon in Milwaukee, Stewart on the second pitch from Sidney Ponson in Baltimore. In New York, meanwhile, Andruw Jones, batting second for Atlanta, drove Rick Reed's seventh pitch of the game over the fence.</p>
        <p>The distinction of breaking the record went to Tucker, however. The game in Milwaukee, whose starting time had been moved up an hour when a postgame fireworks show was added, began two minutes earlier than the one in Baltimore and five minutes before the one between the Braves and the Mets.</p>
        <p>Shutouts Increase</p>
        <p>Despite all of the home runs hit this season, pitchers at times have had their way with hitters. Entering the weekend, they had pitched 201 shutouts compared to 193 last season. National League pitchers have raised their total from 93 to 110, while American League pitchers have dropped from 100 to 91.</p>
        <p>Included in the shutout total this season are 29 1-0 games, two more than last year. The most intriguing aspect of the 1-0 games is that 10 of them were pitched last month and 13 in the last 5 weeks.</p>
        <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers have spearheaded the late-season surge. After pitching no 1-0 games all season, the Dodgers had four last month, including three in a five-game span. Chan Ho Park pitched eight innings each in the first and last of the spree of three 1-0 games. But as if those games were not enough, the Dodgers pitched yet another shutout, this one by 9-0, in the game after Park's second 1-0 decision.</p>
        <p>Season Without a No-Hitter</p>
        <p>Barring a last-day development, the season will end today without having a no-hitter. It would be the first season since 1989 that no no-hitter was pitched.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, this season has produced 12 one-hitters -- seven the work of an individual, five a result of collaboration.</p>
        <p>Pedro Martinez of Boston came closest to adding his name to the no-hit list. John Flaherty of Tampa Bay led off the ninth inning against Martinez with a single. Bartolo Colon of Cleveland went into the eighth inning before Luis Polonia of the Yankees singled with one out.</p>
        <p>Mike Mussina of Baltimore (Ron Coomer, seventh inning), Ryan Dempster of Florida (Mike Piazza, sixth), Tim Hudson of Oakland (Frank Thomas, fourth), Chris Holt of Houston (Ron Belliard, second) and Gil Meche of Seattle (Mike Sweeney, first) pitched the other complete-game one-hitters.</p>
        <p>Meche's complete game was only five innings because of rain. If he had not allowed any hits, he would not have received credit for a no-hitter. A minimum of nine innings is required for a game to be a no-hitter.</p>
        <p>Leyland Not a Candidate</p>
        <p>With half a dozen or more managerial vacancies about to open, teams will seek the best replacements they can find. One name that could be prominently mentioned is Jim Leyland, who did not manage this season after a long run as manager of the Pittsburgh Pirates, the Florida Marlins and the Colorado Rockies. He won three consecutive division championships with the Pirates and the World Series with the Marlins.</p>
        <p>Interested teams, however, should not make the call to Leyland's home in Pittsburgh. Asked if he would take a managing job for next season, Leyland said firmly, ''Not a chance.''</p>
        <p>Asked if he might consider a job after another year off, he declared just as firmly and succinctly, ''Done.''</p>
        <p>Scouting for the St. Louis Cardinals, who are managed by his good friend Tony La Russa, Leyland said he liked what he was doing and liked being home most of the time with his young children. ''I'm enjoying my family,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Watson's Forgotten Resume</p>
        <p>Bob Watson helped build a championship team in Houston, presided over a World Series champion in New York and has now helped create an Olympic gold-medal baseball team, the first to beat the Cuban international juggernaut. But six teams have changed general managers in the past year, and Watson, who was the first black to hold the general manager's title, did not get one of the jobs.</p>
        <p>Another example of baseball's effort to increase its number of nonwhite executives.</p>
