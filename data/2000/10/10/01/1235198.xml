        <p>MARTIN EBNER has a reputation for pushing the giants of Swiss industry and finance to change their ways and pay more attention to shareholder value. But for Mr. Ebner, a maverick investor who is a kind of Swiss Warren Buffett, Roche Holding was a special case. As recently as 1997, shares in Roche, the pharmaceutical giant based here, accounted for 92 percent of Mr. Ebner's profitable Pharma Vision fund, which rose 24 percent a year, on average, through the 1990's.</p>
        <p>Then, last year, Roche hit a roadblock. First, the company agreed to pay a half-billion dollars in settlements after the Justice Department accused it of conspiring with other companies to fix worldwide prices for vitamins; the amount exceeded what the company had paid to settle a citric acid price-fixing case two years earlier and a prescription-drug price-fixing case in the 1970's.</p>
        <p>Next, the pace of revenue growth slowed, and Roche was unable to say how it would compensate for once-promising drugs that never made it to market, or others that have made it -- like Xenical, the exciting weight-loss medication -- but have failed to sell as well as expected. Finally, the company lost its chief financial officer, Henri B. Meier, a respected former banker who had used Roche's unusually large cash reserves -- now about 31 billion Swiss francs, or $17 billion -- to generate profits when drug sales stagnated.</p>
        <p>Roche Holding, once one of the three or four biggest drug makers in the world by market capitalization, had by this year slipped to eighth place.</p>
        <p>Little wonder that Mr. Ebner had tried but failed to apply his brand of medicine. The struggle ebbed in August, when Mr. Ebner dumped about $280 million of Roche shares after the company refused to give him a seat on its board. (Through another company, BZ Group, Mr. Ebner still owns 16 percent of Roche, and he has not completely given up his fight for accountability to shareholders.) Instead, the Hoffman family, which owns most of the voting shares, appointed Peter Brabeck-Letmathe, chief executive of Nestle, the Swiss food giant. Like Roche, Nestle has a multitiered capital structure that limits most shareholders' rights to elect board members or to vote on company policies.</p>
        <p>Roche's rebuff of Mr. Ebner, coming so soon after the vitamin case and amid flagging sales, reinforced the impression among many investors that the company was fatally woven into an old-style corporate web in which family links and corporate cronyism counted for more than transparency and shareholder value. Mr. Ebner, who virtually never speaks to the press, would not comment, but a close associate, Kurt Schiltknecht, summed up the woes. ''On the board, the family remains in power,'' he said. ''It's not a pleasant situation. It's not clear in what direction they're going.''</p>
        <p>From its beginnings more than a century ago, when Fritz Hoffman-La Roche decided to mass-produce standardized pharmaceuticals as an alternative to the often inconsistent remedies then commonly hand-mixed by pharmacists, Roche has always relied on its own compass. It was one of the first drug makers to sign up to sell a rival's product under license, and was in the biotechnology vanguard when it acquired control of Genentech Inc. a decade ago.</p>
        <p>MORE recently, Roche has resisted the drug industry's accepted wisdom that pharmaceutical makers must merge in order to survive, and it pioneered the idea of expanding into diagnostics, the business of detecting and identifying diseases, and twinning that product line with its drugs.</p>
        <p>Investors, however, seem unimpressed with Roche's current course. Its once-stellar stock has declined 32 percent this year, while the Standard &amp; Poor's drug industry index climbed 23 percent -- and some individual stocks, notably Pfizer, have soared as much as 38 percent. Roche's first-half revenue this year rose 11 percent, to 13.68 billion Swiss francs, and profit -- minus a gain of 3.9 billion Swiss francs from the sale of some Genentech stock and other items -- rose 13 percent, to 2.98 billion Swiss francs. Not even the push into diagnostics, led by the $11 billion acquisition of Boehringer Mannheim in 1996, could offset a narrowing of what already were below-average margins. Roche's return on equity and return on capital lag behind those of its biggest competitors. And analysts have warned that earnings for 2000 could shrink by 8 percent.</p>
        <p>Compared with rivals, Roche has clearly set itself a distinctive course; whether it is the right course remains to be seen. ''It is too early in the game to make a definitive statement,'' said Steve Plag, who follows Roche at Credit Suisse First Boston in London. ''Only time will tell.''</p>
        <p>Roche's chief executive, Franz B. Humer, figures that time is on his side. With the Hoffman family protecting him from a hostile takeover, Mr. Humer, a native of Austria and a lawyer by training, said in a recent interview that Roche had laid the groundwork for growth. In addition to its strategic majority stake in Genentech, Roche has alliances with Affymetrix, a biotechnology company in Santa Clara, Calif., and Incyte Pharmaceuticals, a genomics research group seeking to apply genetic research to the daily practice of medicine. Roche also is among 10 big drug companies in the SNP Consortium, a group that finds and publishes hundreds of thousands of anomalies in the human genetic code that predispose people to disease. It has a partnership with Decode Genetics Inc., a company that uses genealogical records in Iceland to unravel the genetic basis for difficult diseases.</p>
        <p>IN more traditional businesses, Roche in 1994 expanded research and distribution in the United States by paying $5.3 billion for Syntex and then bought Boehringer, the world leader in diagnostics. And, Mr. Humer made clear, Roche's substantial cash reserves give him the option to buy other promising smaller companies, even as the Hoffman family's control of Roche protects him from a hostile takeover.</p>
        <p>''Do I exclude major acquisitions or mergers?'' he asked rhetorically. ''No. But it's not a question of making acquisitions just for size. There has to be a strategic fit from a research point of view or from a marketing point of view.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Humer acknowledges that pharmaceuticals, which account for 60 percent of revenue, face a dry spell. Most troublesome is the United States, where overall drug sales are growing 10 to 12 percent a year but where Roche's drug sales actually dropped in the first half.</p>
        <p>Moreover, Roche recently canceled several promising drugs in the new-product pipeline because they proved ineffective or clashed with other medications. A promising heart drug called Posicor was halted because of the risk of reactions with other medicines, for example, while Tasmar, a treatment for Parkinson's disease, was withdrawn in Europe because of side effects. Development of four other promising drugs -- for Alzheimer's, arthritis and heart disease -- was discontinued.</p>
        <p>To revive sales of Xenical, which stagnated after a heady start last year, Mr. Humer said Roche was seeking to persuade regulators that the drug could reduce the risk of diabetes and heart disease, as well as make people slimmer. Confirming such medical benefits would make it easier to persuade health insurers to reimburse Xenical's relatively steep price -- about $150 a month. Roche is spending heavily to reach general practitioners and people losing weight, for instance, through toll-free numbers, to emphasize the drug's medical benefits. ''I am confident that over time we'll get off this plateau,'' Mr. Humer said. ''When? It's difficult to forecast.''</p>
        <p>Roche is also using technology to assess the toxicity of new drugs, to try to catch weaknesses before embarking on expensive clinical trials that are required before drugs can go on sale. ''We reviewed the procedures and improved them in a number of steps along the way,'' he said, adding that Roche sought to do so ''without frightening the organization into a zero-risk policy.''</p>
        <p>Among drugs in development, Mr. Humer counted Pegasys, a medication for treating hepatitis B; Ibandronate, for osteoporosis, and T-20, an H.I.V. drug developed with Trimeris of Durham, N.C. Mr. Plag, the Credit Suisse analyst, called them ''interesting products,'' but added that ''this year will be a tough year, with a significant slowdown.'' Like many analysts, Mr. Plag cut his recommendation for Roche earlier this year to ''hold'' from ''buy.''</p>
        <p>Some revenue slack is taken up by growth in diagnostics, where Roche has succeeded Abbott Laboratories  as global leader. Heino von Prondzynski is so convinced of Roche's potential in diagnostics that he quit earlier this year as vaccines chief at Chiron, the innovative drug company in Emeryville, Calif., to run Roche's diagnostics division. ''In the next three to five years you're going to see more and more targeted monitoring of individuals, and then the application of preventive measures either by changes in life style or medication,'' Mr. von Prondzynski said.</p>
        <p>Roche is already profiting, he said, from a shift in diagnostics away from laboratory-based analysis to hand-held devices. Accucheck, for instance, a portable device that measures blood sugar levels in diabetics, is now Roche's biggest blockbuster. Accucheck sales reached $1.1 billion last year, more than any Roche drug -- and newer, more compact versions are on the way. By 2003, Roche will sell a device the size of a cell phone that can automatically feed insulin to a patient, adjusting the dosage with a sensor implanted beneath the skin.</p>
        <p>The trend to portable devices is also strengthening Roche's retail sales, an area in which the company was traditionally weak, notably in the United States. Roche recently hired Richard Laube from Procter &amp; Gamble to head its consumer health sales; early next year, he will join Roche's management board, the top executives who run daily operations.</p>
        <p>Mr. Humer acknowledged that the departure of Mr. Meier, the chief financial officer, was a loss, but he said Mr. Meier chose his own successor, Anton Affentranger, 44, chief executive of Lombard Odier, a Geneva private bank. Mr. Meier himself will join the Roche board, assuring continuity. ''I am convinced we have the depth to continue to creatively finance our operations,'' Mr. Humer said.</p>
        <p>Family members, who rarely talk to the press, declined to be interviewed for this article. But in an interview last spring with a Swiss newspaper, Andre Hoffmann, a grandson of the founder and a board member, said shareholders were not shortchanged. From 1990 through last year, he said, Roche's market value had risen almost tenfold, to 174 billion Swiss francs, or $98 billion. The family, he said, ''would naturally be prepared to discuss'' changes to Roche's corporate structure, ''if such a step made sense for Roche.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Humer, for his part, knows that Roche's family-style capitalism is no longer fashionable, driven out by a push throughout Europe for greater shareholder rights, but he says it has ''provided stability,'' and ''allows us to think strategically.'' Indeed, critics sometimes accuse Roche, with liquid assets of $17 billion, of being a bank with a hobby of selling pharmaceuticals. Yet the cash is not there for its own sake, Mr. Humer said, ''but in order to reinvest in the business.'' Despite criticism from Mr. Ebner and other activists, the system works, he said.</p>
        <p>''Why fix it,'' he asked, ''if it isn't broken?''</p>
