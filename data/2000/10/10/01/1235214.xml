        <p>We stand on the threshold of a new century big with the fate of many nations. It rests with us now to decide whether in the opening years of that century we shall march forward to fresh triumphs, or whether at the outset we shall cripple ourselves for the contest.

        <p>Theodore Roosevelt's speech to the Republican National Convention in 1900 was exuberantly a young man's oration, suppurating with testosterone (a substance he preferred to call ''vigor di vita'').

        <p>We stand on the threshold of a new century big with the fate of many nations. It rests with us now to decide whether in the opening years of that century we shall march forward to fresh triumphs, or whether at the outset we shall cripple ourselves for the contest. Is America a weakling, to shrink from the work of the great world-powers? No. The young giant of the West stands on a continent and clasps the crest of an ocean in either hand. . . .''</p>
        <p>Theodore Roosevelt's speech to the Republican National Convention in 1900 was exuberantly a young man's oration, suppurating with testosterone (a substance he preferred to call ''vigor di vita''). His projection was so forceful -- sentences machine-gunning to the back of Philadelphia's Exposition Hall, gesticulations shaking his entire body -- that nobody listening could doubt his total identification with ''the young giant of the West.''</p>
        <p>Nothing is more notable in modern American campaign oratory than its careful, gray, timid quality. Can anyone imagine any candidate now essaying such a robustly masculine paragraph as the one quoted above? George W. Bush is not about to invoke ''the fate of many nations,'' for fear that he may be asked to name some of them. One doubts that Al Gore would risk using the word ''cripple,'' even as a verb. (Some time back, his boss, careless of the dictionary, actually apologized to Welsh-Americans for saying that Congress was ''welching'' on its responsibilities.)</p>
        <p>In the hundred years since T.R. strutted that stage, our civilization has matured. Sensibilities quiescent then are more vocal now. But the United States is still a young republic, in the Greek or Roman sense. Why do presidential hopefuls who put such a premium on jogging talk as if they were on their last legs? Is the young giant of the West succumbing to ossification? You'd certainly think so, the way monuments are proliferating in Washington at Starbucks speed. (A group of nostalgic Reaganauts in Congress, not content with Ronald Reagan National Airport and the Ronald Reagan Building downtown, now want an official Ronald Reagan memorial and shrines to the Gipper in every one of the 50 states.)</p>
        <p>Paradoxically, Mr. Reagan -- the oldest president we've ever had -- was the last candidate who could get away with testosterone-laden oratory. From the outset of his political career he cultivated, and addressed himself to, groups like Young Americans for Freedom. When backers offered him the use of a television studio for his famous ''Time for Choosing'' speech of Oct. 27, 1964, he declined and asked for a ''large room full of students.''</p>
        <p>Political campaigners have always relied on youthful supporters, if only because they cheer louder, jump higher, and have more stamina for licking envelopes. But Reagan (who wrote most of his own speeches before entering the White House) unself-consciously thought of himself as young -- and orated accordingly.  Hence his lusty willingness to assail Communism with words like ''evil'' and ''lie'' and ''cheat,'' instead of the careful vocabulary of containment.</p>
        <p>Young people respond, albeit viscerally, to short, direct words like these. Their restless minds have no patience for circumlocutions. For that matter, we older voters appreciate frank talk, too. We like to know what a candidate really feels, even if his aggression alarms us (as T.R.'s sometimes did) or his ignorance takes us aback (as Reagan's often did). America is still a nation that values individual expression -- which is to say, free speech.</p>
        <p>Joseph Lieberman started out as an attractive candidate with Reagan esque humor and Rooseveltian moral fervor, but he perverted the latter with an address to Hollywood moguls that gave new dimensions of meaning to the word ''pander'': ''Al and I have a tremendous regard for this industry. . . . We will never put the government in the position of telling you by law, through law, what to make.''</p>
        <p>Richard Cheney deserves equal time here, but can anybody recall a single one of his public remarks?</p>
        <p>Neither Vice President Gore nor Governor Bush seem able, in their carefully scripted utterances, to say anything that has the slightest ping of personality. Even as ''just folks,'' both men stiffen up. Their joviality, in armchair schmoozes with Jay Leno or Oprah Winfrey, is that of a pair of Toby jugs. That onstage kiss at the Democratic Convention persuaded a lot of people that Honest Al has a blood temperature of more than an ecologically correct 68 degrees Fahrenheit. But for this viewer, it looked as engineered as the torch-lighting ceremony in Sydney.</p>
        <p>All of which does not augur well for the debates. When we build our monuments and write our histories, it's the presidents with vigor di vita we identify with.</p>
        <p>In live memory and folk memory, we hear again the chuckling self-certainty of Ronald (''There you go again'') Reagan; Gerald Ford's unmatched simple eloquence after the resignation of Richard Nixon (''My fellow Americans, our long national nightmare is ended''); Harry Truman warning the thermally challenged to stay out of his kitchen; John Kennedy tossing those dry, disarming wisecracks at press conferences; Franklin Roosevelt's baritonal pronouncements making the Oval Office resonate like a drum; T.R.'s sibilant teeth biting out his unforgettable epigrams (''S-speak s-softly and carry a big s-stick''); and so on back through the thunderers of the 19th century.</p>
        <p>Here's one undecided voter's appeal to all current candidates: Between now and Nov. 7, will somebody please say something?</p>
        <p>Edmund Morris, the author of ''Dutch: A Memoir of Ronald Reagan,'' is writing the second volume of a trilogy on Theodore Roosevelt.</p>
