        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In his column ''Word of Warning on Camden From Someone Who Knows,'' (On Politics, Sept. 10), Iver Peterson presents choices on how to deal with this troubled city that are best described as Hobbesian. One alternative he discusses, a type of benign neglect, is the state ''giving Camden just enough to scrape by.''</p>
        <p>The other alternative is to increase the state subsidy even further so as to ''allow the city to invest and blossom'' by making it more attractive to private business and investors.</p>
        <p>I would suggest there exists a third option, that of a controlled but temporary state guardianship having as its objective the eventual abandonment of Camden as a municipal entity.</p>
        <p>If the next governor and legislature have the courage to consider this option, I suspect federal dollars could be made available to use Camden as a test case for detailed study, hands-on experience, all of which can be implemented elsewhere.</p>
        <p>The alternative is to continue having the tax-paying residents of New Jersey continue to support a failed Camden long into the future and, probably, dubious, projects like the state aquarium, the Battleship New Jersey monument and the Admiral Wilson Boulevard clean-up.</p>
        <p>At some point perhaps there will be enough of us to send a firm message to our elected officials in Trenton that enough is enough. We cannot continue to support Camden forever, and it is time to consider other options rather than to tinker around the edges of the problem.</p>
