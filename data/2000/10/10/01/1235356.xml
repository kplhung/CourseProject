        <p>Mississippi State 47  Florida 35</p>
        <p>Dicenzo Miller ran for 172 yards and Dontae Walker had 156 as Mississippi State made No. 3 Florida look defenseless in a 47-35 victory yesterday in Starkville, Miss.</p>
        <p>Florida Coach Steve Spurrier openly questioned his defense's effort after last week's poor performance against Kentucky and saw no improvement against the Bulldogs.</p>
        <p>Mississippi State (3-1, 1-1 Southeastern Conference) gained 517 yards, 351 on the ground. Miller and Walker each had a touchdown run, and Wayne Madkin ran for two scores and threw for one.</p>
        <p>Florida's offense wasn't much better against Mississippi State's pressure defense. The Gators (4-1, 2-1) turned the ball over three times and missed three fourth-and-1 attempts in the first half.</p>
        <p>Florida scored a touchdown on the game's final play, but never got to attempt a conversion as fans stormed the field and tore down both goal posts.</p>
        <p>L.S.U. 38, Tennessee 31</p>
        <p>Rohan Davey threw a 25-yard touchdown pass to Robert Royal on the first play of overtime to give L.S.U. a victory over No. 11 Tennessee in Baton Rouge, La.</p>
        <p>After L.S.U. scored, Tennessee drove to the 3, but third- and fourth-down passes to the end zone were broken up by linebacker Bradie James.</p>
        <p>Tennessee did not score a touchdown until the third quarter, then scored 25 second-half points to overcome an 18-point deficit and tie the score.</p>
        <p>L.S.U.'s John Corbello, who kicked a 47-yard field goal in the first quarter, missed a 46-yarder on the final play of regulation.</p>
        <p>It was the first overtime game in Tiger Stadium history. Victory-starved L.S.U. fans swarmed the field after the game and quickly toppled both goal posts.</p>
        <p>Oregon 23  Washington 16</p>
        <p>Joey Harrington threw for one touchdown and ran for another to lead Oregon over visiting Washington.</p>
        <p>Oregon (4-1, 2-0 Pac-10) led all the way after Harrington hit tight end Justin Peelle with a 13-yard strike up the middle midway through the first quarter. Harrington drove the Ducks 88 yards in nine plays after a 70-yard punt return by Keenan Howry was called back for an illegal Oregon block.</p>
        <p>The victory extended Oregon's home winning streak to 18 games, the longest current streak in the Pac-10. It was the conference opener for Washington (3-1).</p>
        <p>Oregon State 31  Southern Cal 21</p>
        <p>Ken Simonton ran for a career-high 234 yards and three touchdowns as host Oregon State ended its 26-game losing streak against No. 8 Southern Cal. The last time the Beavers (4-0, 1-0 Pac-10) beat Southern Cal (3-1, 0-1) was a 3-0 victory over the Trojans in 1967.</p>
        <p>Michigan 13  Wisconsin 10</p>
        <p>Drew Henson, making his first start for No. 9 Michigan, threw a 15-yard touchdown pass to David Terrell with 6 minutes 42 seconds left at Ann Arbor, Mich.</p>
        <p>The No. 17 Wolverines (4-1, 2-0 Big Ten) became the first Division I-A football program to reach 800 victories. The Badgers fell to 3-2, 0-2 in the Big Ten. Henson, who fumbled twice in the first quarter, was 15 of 27 for 257 yards and a touchdown.</p>
        <p>On the game-winning drive, Henson converted on two third downs with 21- and 20-yard passes to Terrell.</p>
        <p>Nebraska 42, Missouri 24</p>
        <p>Eric Crouch ran for 110 yards and a touchdown and threw two scoring passes for No. 1 Nebraska.</p>
        <p>Bobby Newcombe set a school record with a 94-yard punt return for a touchdown for the Cornhuskers (4-0, 1-0 Big 12), who won despite their worst defensive performance of the season.</p>
        <p>The Huskers allowed a season-high 492 yards to the Tigers, who scored their most points in Lincoln since winning 35-31 in 1978 -- Missouri's last victory in the series. Newcombe's return broke Johnny Rodgers's school record of 92 yards set against Oklahoma State in 1971.</p>
        <p>Kansas State 44  Colorado 21</p>
        <p>Jonathan Beasley threw three first-half touchdown passes and visiting Kansas State opened its Big 12 campaign by overwhelming Colorado. Josh Scobey ran for two touchdowns for the No. 5 Wildcats (5-0), who scored three straight touchdowns after Colorado (0-4) had reduced the deficit to 7 midway through the second quarter.</p>
        <p>Clemson 52, Duke 22</p>
        <p>Woodrow Dantzler ran for three touchdowns and threw for another score as No. 7 Clemson beat Duke at Durham. Clemson (5-0, 3-0 Atlantic Coast Conference) has won its first five games for the first time since 1987 and is 17-3 against the Blue Devils (0-5, 0-2) in the last 20 meetings.</p>
        <p>Alabama 27  South Carolina 17</p>
        <p>Milo Lewis intercepted two fourth-quarter passes and the backup quarterback Andrew Zow revived a sputtering offense as host Alabama beat No. 23 South Carolina.</p>
        <p>The Crimson Tide (2-3, 2-1 SEC) avoided its first 1-4 start in 43 years and handed the Gamecocks (4-1, 2-1) their first loss of the season.</p>
        <p>T.C.U. 24, Navy 0</p>
        <p>LaDainian Tomlinson ran for 121 yards and a touchdown as No. 16 Texas Christian University won at Navy to extend its winning streak to nine games. Casey Printers was 14 of 17 for 188 yards and 2 touchdowns for T.C.U. (4-0). Navy fell to 0-4. Tomlinson, who had 33 carries, broke T.C.U.'s career rushing record, pushing his total to 3,645 yards.</p>
        <p>T.C.U. put together touchdown drives of 81, 85 and 67 yards, keyed by the passing of Printers.</p>
        <p>Texas 42  Oklahoma State 7</p>
        <p>Roy Williams caught a 96-yard touchdown pass and Kenny Hayter rushed for 122 yards against the nation's toughest run defense as No. 13 Texas beat visiting Oklahoma State.</p>
        <p>Major Applewhite passed for 291 yards and 3 touchdowns to lead Texas (3-1, 1-0 Big 12).</p>
        <p>Reggie White led Oklahoma State (2-2, 0-1) with 104 yards rushing.</p>
        <p>Northwestern 37  Michigan State 17</p>
        <p>No fluke. No overtime necessary. Northwestern beat a ranked team for the second straight week -- this time  No. 18 Michigan State in East Lansing, Mich. The victory follows a riveting 47-44 overtime victory at Wisconsin, then ranked No. 7. Michigan State fell to 3-1.</p>
        <p>IN OTHER GAMES</p>
        <p>J.T. Thatcher had three interceptions as No. 14 OKLAHOMA (4-0, 1-0 Big 12) beat visiting KANSAS, 34-16. . . .
