        <p>WHILE fans all over the country spent this summer obsessed with the last ''Survivor,'' the latest ''Millionaire'' and all manner of television that had nothing to do with their lives, some Westchester residents were tuning in to Channel 73 and watching a Rye police officer, Gary Olivier, cook sausage and peppers while chatting about the news in their hometown.</p>
        <p>Public access television, the cable channels earmarked for local issues, are crackling with inventive, personal programs made by Westchester and Putnam residents for their friends and neighbors.

        <p>WHILE fans all over the country spent this summer obsessed with the last ''Survivor,'' the latest ''Millionaire'' and all manner of television that had nothing to do with their lives, some Westchester residents were tuning in to Channel 73 and watching a Rye police officer, Gary Olivier, cook sausage and peppers while chatting about the news in their hometown.</p>
        <p>Public access television, the cable channels earmarked for local issues, are crackling with inventive, personal programs made by Westchester and Putnam residents for their friends and neighbors. Only on public access can you see Rudolph W. Giuliani ''outed'' as a vampire, or watch State Senator Suzi Oppenheimer bake bread, or test your knowledge about the city of Rye on the game show ''What's Your Rye-Q?''</p>
        <p>Many of these programs, which are broadcast on Channels 19, 32, 71, 72 or 73, depending on the provider, have developed loyal followings. In Briarcliff Manor the bars fill each week with patrons dying to hear what Clay Tiffany -- an unapologetic dirt disher -- will say next on his program, ''Dirge of the Charlatans.'' At 11 p.m., other viewers are settling in for ''Television Boy,'' the 30-minute mixture of music, art and weirdness produced by Chris Mongon, who calls his unusual, David Lynch-inspired program ''a cross between 'The Twilight Zone' and 'Saturday Night Live' -- definitely a counterculture kind of thing.''</p>
        <p>From school board meetings to ''Television Boy,'' the potential content of public access programs is limitless -- bound only by the interest and imagination of a community. Anyone who can hold a video camera can make a program. And for those who can't, many towns offer free instructional workshops and even lend equipment. Cable companies are obligated to make these channels available, and studio managers across Westchester say that slowly more people are becoming aware of public access.</p>
        <p>''We've definitely grown -- a lot,'' said Nicole Levitsky, the production coordinator at Rye Community Television studios. ''Everyone watches our live City Council meetings. It might be hard to believe, but they do. When we taped a meeting about the Fire Department, the firemen came running down the street and right into City Hall to answer questions. They were watching in the firehouse.''</p>
        <p>This is the purpose of public access -- to show a community to itself, to give those who work or live in a town the opportunity to take part and share information. Debbie Salansky, a manager at the Larchmont-Mamaroneck public access station, LMC-TV, has watched interest in these programs grow so much over the last 13 years that she now broadcasts locally produced shows from 5 p.m. through the wee hours.</p>
        <p>''People realize that they can do important stuff with public access,'' she said. ''I see more and more of them being interested in it and coming in. They can do fun things, but they can also do informative things that help other people. You can watch your child's school play, or you can watch what's happening with your government.''</p>
        <p>Purists say the huge cable corporations that arrived in the 1980's to gobble up smaller mom-and-pop operations have crushed the original free-wheeling ideal of public access television. But highly personal shows like ''Television Boy'' belie this.</p>
        <p>Besides Mr. Mongon's wacky program, Mediaone also shows Dr. Jacqueline Putting, an herbalist who speaks for a half-hour on the healing properties of plants; ''We Mean Business,'' which focuses on stores in Ossining; ''Underground Thrashold''' with Tony Manic, who runs tapes of heavy metal rock concerts; and ''The Sundiata Sadiq Show,'' a platform for the host to make known his opinions about injustices whites have done to blacks.</p>
        <p>''We reach into homes all the way down to Chappaqua and Millwood,'' said Cecilia Mastrorilli, the local access producer at Mediaone. ''Our stuff's getting into the home of President Clinton.''</p>
        <p>In Larchmont and Mamaroneck, viewers might tune in to watch ''Jeannette's Best Breads,'' where Jeannette Bogart bakes a loaf with a community leader, sits down with her guest for lunch and chats about issues of the day (when Senator Oppenheimer joined her, the two discussed breast cancer).</p>
        <p>''Public access is a value both to the audience and the presenters,'' said Ted M. Levine, the host of ''What's Your Rye-Q?'' It is a game show where contestants ponder questions like, ''How many checkout lanes are there in the A.&amp;P.?''</p>
        <p>''On my show and all the others, the audience is learning more about the place they live,'' he said.</p>
        <p>There are bilingual programs, like ''La Vida Loca'' on LMC-TV. The hosts discuss issues of interest to Latinos before breaking into dance routines.</p>
        <p>There are public service programs like ''The Computer Guy,'' where Jake Morvay, a Mamaroneck high school junior, assists the technologically befuddled on call-ins.</p>
        <p>And there is entertainment. Michael Byrnes, an elevator mechanic by day, has found countywide popularity with his three-year-old program ''The Guitar Show.''</p>
        <p>''Basically, I was watching television, and I realized that I didn't see anyone just playing guitar, just standing there by themselves and playing,'' he said. ''I'm a guitar player, and that's what I like, so that's what we do. We invite people on who just stand and play.''</p>
        <p>Even Westchester County produces programs. ''This Is Westchester,'' an hourlong magazine-style show, which tries to emulate ''Dateline,'' trains a camera on local people grappling with emotional issues. Once, a camera crew followed Child Protective Services into a home to show counselors deciding whether to leave a child in the care of his heroin-addicted mother.</p>
        <p>Matthew Wachsman, the county's coordinator of technical media services, said: ''The question is, Do you want to watch 'Seinfeld,' or do you want to watch '60 Minutes,' or do you possibly want to watch 'This Is Westchester'? We're basically trying to compete with 'Survivor,' so we really tried to make our show personal and get down to grass-roots stories, because that's how you show the issues.''</p>
        <p>Right now, ''This is Westchester'' reaches about 30 of 43 municipalities in the county, he said.</p>
        <p>''The opportunity with public access is wonderful,'' said Mr. Mongon, a k a Television Boy. ''And even though it probably wasn't originally designed to fulfill what it fulfills for me, it's amazing that we're able to do what we can do. I don't even like the term public access. I totally consider it underground cable.''</p>
        <p>For all that creative ferment, some public access supporters say it's still not enough.</p>
        <p>''We never seem to have as many programs as we'd like,'' said Jim Kenny, the community studio manager in Rye. ''We sort of thought more people would use the studio here. A lot of people have a lot of ideas, but not a lot of people have the time and energy it takes to put a program together.''</p>
        <p>One reason may be the byzantine way public access operates, with a different system in each municipality. Some cities have their own studios where community members can shoot and broadcast their shows. Some do not. In certain cases, the cable company charges residents a nominal monthly fee, which is put toward public access; in others, the city or town gets money from a cable provider and may or may not put it toward community TV.</p>
        <p>Tom Rippolon, who used to manage a public access station in Tarrytown, lays the blame at the feet of the cable corporations, which he says have subtly discouraged the growth of the format. In the old days, Mr. Rippolon recalled, his community was deeply invested in local programming.</p>
        <p>''We generated everything from shows about controversial political issues to church services to soap operas and humor,'' he said. ''It really ran the gamut of what could come out of a community. It was a very unimpeded access that people had.''</p>
        <p>Now, he said, there are more restrictions than ever before and a clear discouragement of anything controversial.</p>
        <p>But others say each municipality has only itself to blame.</p>
        <p>''Mediaone gave all the surrounding towns the option of having their own TV studio -- but a lot of towns didn't take them up on it,'' said Ms. Mastrorilli, the local access producer at Mediaone who also runs GO-TV, the public access station in Ossining.</p>
        <p>Even she admitted, however, that there has been a major change.</p>
        <p>''When I first started with this stuff in 1982 it was a lot more crazy, it was more free,'' she said. ''We used to pretty much put anything on the air. It was all about free speech, about letting people say whatever they wanted to say. Now, there are way more rules and regulations and paperwork than I ever had before. You need talent releases for everything -- we can't even shoot the fifth-grade play at school without copyright paperwork.''</p>
        <p>Still, it's good enough for ''Television Boy.''</p>
        <p>Unfazed by the catch-as-catch-can nature of the system, Mr. Mongon happily drops off tapes with the cleaning people at the Peekskill station when he has to get to work before regular business hours.</p>
        <p>''One morning I just left the tape in a bag on a doorknob and could only hope they would put it on,'' he said. ''But I've got to tell you, It's a lot of fun. With all the hell that life can feed you, there's this golden moment when you can sit down and actually create.''</p>
