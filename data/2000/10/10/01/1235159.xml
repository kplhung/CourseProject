        <p>NEVER mind what you read in Vogue, see traipsing down the runways in Paris or observe on the fashionistas on ''Sex and the City.'' Black remains the perennial favorite color of New York women.</p>
        <p>Forget the blather about gray being the new black or pink being the new gray or orange being the new pink. Busy New Yorkers can't be bothered with such seasonal silliness. For them, black is the new black and has been for some time.</p>
        <p>Black has staying power, or as they say in the movie biz, black has legs. It might be a star one season and a bit player the next -- it's shaping up as a good year for black leather -- but in New York it's always on stage.</p>
        <p>From Lincoln Center to the Angelika Theater, from the bar at Pastis to the banquettes of Le Cirque, from the perfume counters at Bloomingdale's to the sale racks at Loehmann's, black rules. Even at Wendy's, in the subway arcade beneath Rockefeller Center, patrons wolf down burgers beneath a framed photograph of Audrey Hepburn (a k a Our Lady of the Little Black Dress), attired as Holly Golightly in a black sheath, pearls and huge black glasses. And don't tell the cloakroom attendant at Il Cantinori that yours is the black coat. They're all black.</p>
        <p>During last month's Fashion Week, Bryant Park swarmed with fashion hounds who looked like an enormous batch of licorice sticks in their black suits, skirts, T-shirts and skinny black leather pants. Appropriately, Henri Bendel and Bergdorf Goodman festooned their windows in the city's signature color combo, black and white.</p>
        <p>''Black is a New York state of mind,'' said Leatrice Eiseman, director of the Pantone Color Institute, an organization that tracks and predicts color trends. ''It's the ultimate color of urban chic that goes with the city.''</p>
        <p>No doubt there are women in Chicago, San Francisco and other fashion meccas as besotted for black as women in New York. There just aren't enough of them to collectively coat the streets in shades of soot.</p>
        <p>''In Cleveland, they consider a cobalt blue dress proper business attire,'' said Janet McCue, former fashion editor of The Plain Dealer of Cleveland. ''I don't think New Yorkers would be caught dead in that. Anything bright or colorful would make them feel kind of Podunky.''</p>
        <p>Or like a fish out of water. Evelyn Dallal, a partner in Ogan/Dallal Associates, a New York public relations firm with many fashion industry clients, estimated that 70 percent of her wardrobe is black. Yet she was persuaded to wear a pale blue silk suit for a friend's wedding in Beverly Hills.</p>
        <p>''I felt a little flashy,'' Ms. Dallal conceded. ''I'm not used to wearing color.''</p>
        <p>Why are New York women so inordinately attached to black?</p>
        <p>''The bottom line is that black is the most powerful color symbolically,'' said Valerie Steele, chief curator of the museum of the Fashion Institute of Technology. ''It is associated with death, darkness, anarchy, elegance, evil, and with sex and things taboo. The combination of all these things, of being powerful and dangerous and sexy and chic, is important to the self-identity of New York women.</p>
        <p>''Maybe in Atlanta, women are concerned with looking pretty and feminine,'' Ms. Steele added, ''but in New York, it's more like, let's go for the jugular. There is nothing like black for having this sort of dangerous edge, this drop-dead chic.''</p>
        <p>In other words, if you want to look sophisticated and aloof -- and what New York woman doesn't? -- you can't run around town in lime green and heliotrope. Or as Ms. McCue of The Plain Dealer put it, ''You can't withdraw into yourself in a tangerine suit.''</p>
        <p>Coco Chanel is most often credited with creating the original little black dress in 1926, a sleek, uncluttered number that became a linchpin of modern fashion. The 1950's marked the glory days for black dressing, with the uptown crowd swanning around in full-skirted black cocktail dresses and downtown types outfitted in head-to-toe beatnik black.</p>
        <p>However, not until the 1980's did New Yorkers begin wearing black en masse, according to Ms. Steele of F.I.T.</p>
        <p>''Fashion really went black in the 1980's with the advent of avant-garde Japanese fashion that carried on the beatnik tradition,  but did it in a more sophisticated way,'' she said. ''At first, people thought it was this depressing, apocalyptic look, but then boom! It caught on with everyone with any pretension to being cool or hip. The downtown crowd took to it, then it moved uptown and took on a richer, more glossy spin. Black was everything to everyone.''</p>
        <p>Certain factions of New York fashion mavens shun the noir aesthetic. They crave color, preferably the one making this season's statement. Among the Sherwin-Williams brigade: the ladies-who-lunch bunch and their young successors, the Park Avenue princesses, along with the editorial czarinas of the slick fashion bibles.</p>
        <p>''It's partly a question of having that kind of disposable income or access to free clothes so you can get the cute little powder blue Louis Vuitton this or that, wear it a couple of times and chuck it,'' Ms. Steele said. ''Most people can't do that.''</p>
        <p>Politicians' wives and female politicians also rarely wear black. Hillary Clinton, for example, tends to favor a spectrum of blue.</p>
        <p>''Politicians want to be perceived as approachable and friendly,'' said Ms. Eiseman of the Pantone Color Institute. ''The last thing they want is to come across as a New York sophisticate.''</p>
        <p>Not does black saturate television screens, even when a series is set in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>''For the camera, black absorbs all the light and has no interest,'' said Patricia Field, the costume designer for HBO's ''Sex and the City.'' ''I'm working on a new show called 'The Street' that takes place on Wall Street. I wanted to dress all these guys in black and make a strong statement, but I couldn't because of that very problem.''</p>
        <p>As for Sarah Jessica Parker and her three uber-trendy ''Sex and the City'' chums, whom Ms. Field outfits in hot colors and wild prints, the designer wanted them to represent ''the glamour, excitement and energy of New York.''</p>
        <p>''I feel New York has so many options, culturally and artistically, why just go to black?'' she said. ''Black has its place. But let's face it. It doesn't give you any eye candy.''</p>
        <p>If clothes proclaim your fantasies and aspirations, then colorful confections bring out the sunny, flirty inner prom queen who loves the spotlight. Black, on the other hand, lets the world believe you're clever, cool, pulled-together and 10 pounds thinner than you really are.</p>
        <p>''I give a lot of credit to those women who wake up in the morning and put together an orange suit with all the right accessories,'' said Amy Holt Edelman, author of ''The Little Black Dress'' (Simon &amp; Schuster, 1997). ''Who needs the aggravation? In black, you never look out of place. You look thinner, taller, sexier and more elegant in black. A New York woman just feels good in black.''</p>
