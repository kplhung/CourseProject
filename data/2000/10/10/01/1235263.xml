        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>It seems a shame a tree in Queens had to be felled just to make a stop sign visible (''Wielding the Ax, When a Tree Endangers Life and Limb, Sept. 17). Had the Transportation Department become involved, perhaps the sign could have been moved in front of the tree that was blocking it. Surely moving the signpost a few feet would have been a lot less costly and far more correct from an ecological standpoint. Besides, the tree was certainly there before the sign  was installed, and the sign should never have been placed where in time it would be hidden.</p>
