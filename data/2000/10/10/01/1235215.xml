        <p>Al Groh confronted the first public crisis of his head coaching tenure last week, and he handled it with perfect Parcellsian pitch. He refused to disclose even the most minute details of his meeting with Vinny Testaverde last Tuesday. He blasted the news media. And then, in a normal bit of coaching logic, he insisted -- the meeting with the quarterback notwithstanding -- that there had never been a problem in the first place.</p>
        <p>But the way that Groh had dealt with his first real crisis was more typical of his personality. That was a hurdle far more ominous than Testaverde's frustration. Two days before the Jets were to face the New England Patriots, in the team's final full practice session, Groh looked up to see his trainers helping Wayne Chrebet off the field.</p>
        <p>''That was a lot bigger issue for me to deal with,'' Groh said. ''Look, I really wished I didn't see Wayne standing there, but what I wished isn't the issue anymore. Immediately, it became: 'How do we deal with this? How do we deal with this in front of the team, in making accommodations to the game plan?' Here it was, handle it.''</p>
        <p>Chrebet's sprained lower leg, it turned out, was not serious, and he played against New England, scoring two touchdowns in the fourth quarter.</p>
        <p>If Groh's bluster last week was an homage to his former boss, then that sort of throwback, boiled-down-to-the-core-issues approach was vintage Groh. Because he wanted to instill mental and physical toughness in the team, he ran a grueling training camp that annoyed players. He has maintained that every person must be accountable and must contribute to the team, so he benched left tackle Jason Fabini after he collected four penalties in the first game and then benched Testaverde after he threw his third interception.  Last week, he reveled in a team full of his type of guys.</p>
        <p>''They're tough,'' Groh said. ''They work the same way every day. They sit in the same place in the meeting room every day. They practice the same way every day. They're tough and dependable, and they're really part of the team structure and happy to be such. More than any other sport, football is about putting the team together, not about collecting individuals.''</p>
        <p>Only in his playcalling, which has included a bit of derring-do with desperation passes to cornerbacks, halfback options and going for it on fourth downs, has Groh's nuts-and-bolts approach taken on an additional dimension.</p>
        <p>''You have to think in terms of doing things that might help you win,  and you can't fear what the consequences are,'' Groh said. ''You've got to be willing to play the odds.''</p>
        <p>Everything is about the game for Groh. His disdain for the ancillary issues that fill up the days between games is obvious. He speaks incessantly of just wanting to coach the team -- he has a sign in his office that reminds him to do just that -- and he was visibly uncomfortable during the weeks leading to games against New England and Tampa Bay, with their obvious sideshow aspects. And he refused last week to  address whether he felt that he was more accepted in the locker room, now that the Jets are 4-0 and he has proven that it is possible to succeed Parcells without destroying your career.</p>
        <p>''I'm not coaching for acceptance,'' Groh said. ''I'm just trying to coach the team the way I believe and the way I know how.''</p>
        <p>But Groh has so far succeeded where Pete Carroll, with the Jets, and Ray Handley, with the Giants, failed. Because he has won quickly, any murmurs about the differences in style and substance between Groh and Parcells have largely subsided. Testaverde laughed when he recalled an encounter he had with Parcells a few weeks ago, in which the former coach sarcastically reminded Testaverde what time the next game would begin, a dig meant to remind Testaverde to play all 60 minutes, not just the fourth quarter.</p>
        <p>Testaverde said Parcells's gift for a zinger almost made players enjoy being punished. That is not Groh's style. Instead, he reviews in exhaustive detail what he expects of his players. While they still give large amounts of credit to Parcells for crafting a team short on superstar names but long on grittiness, they also agree that Groh, after a perfect and largely unexpected start, at least for now, has the golden touch.</p>
        <p>''Obviously, what he's doing is working,'' center Kevin Mawae said. ''Any time you have any kind of change, there's growing pains. We went through them in spring and in training camp. The system was the same but the way of doing things did change. Practice schedules, and that was a big adjustment to a lot of guys. The first instinct is to say 'We used to not do it like that.' It causes a little grumbling. Everybody had this perception that everything was going to be exactly as it was. They shouldn't have thought that way. Al's his own man. He's going to coach his way.''</p>
        <p>Groh said he would spend part of the bye week analyzing his performance, and his love of detail will be revealed here, too. He will review not in broad strokes how certain things have worked, but also how he handles each Wednesday of preparation, each Thursday.</p>
        <p>''Were the practices well planned?'' Groh said. ''Were the goals established? I'm personally not satisfied with what I've done.''</p>
