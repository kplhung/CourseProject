        <p>You've cherry-picked surprisingly low-priced Burgundies at an Acker Merrall &amp; Condit auction. Wine is about sharing, so you've invited novices and aficionados to sample a dozen; after an hour, the bottles will hop to the dinner table. But frustration lies ahead: Your guests will find successive wines harder to appreciate as tannins, acidity and alcohol accumulate on their palates.</p>
        <p>To solve this age-old problem, wine teachers and sponsors of professional tastings serve sparkling and still water, or baguette slices, or Carr's water biscuits, or cheese.</p>
        <p>When James Trezise, president of the New York Wine and Grape Foundation, judged wines this year at the Los Angeles County Fair, he found something new. With the cheese cubes and crackers, he said, were ''the most delightful olives I've ever had'' that, further, were ''regardless of the wine -- red or white -- the best palate cleanser I've ever had.''</p>
        <p>The foundation, in the Finger Lakes, holds a yearly statewide contest open to all 140 wineries. Mr. Trezise ordered the olives for this year's 16 judges. They were, he said, a hit.</p>
        <p>Intrigued, I fetched cans from the source, the C. C. Graber Company, California olive merchants since 1894. Bull's-eye! Graber's cured olives, tree-ripened in the San Joaquin Valley, outrank the choicest Spanish olives I've ever tried with fresh fino and manzanilla sherries, a made-in-heaven marriage.</p>
        <p>Greenish, reddish-green and blackish-green, Graber olives are nutty, smooth, mellow, succulently meaty, but not filling. Paradoxically, eaten warm they not only neutralized the palate but also heightened the pleasures of the next reds and whites sipped. Go figure.</p>
        <p>Graber olives have long been sold citywide in many D'Agostino markets, A. &amp; P.'s and Food Emporiums. Look only for No. 12 size olives in 7.5 ounce cans with a flat 1940's appearance (about $4).</p>
        <p>C. C. Graber is at 315 East Fourth Street, Ontario, Calif., 91764; (800) 996-5483; www.graberolives.com.</p>
