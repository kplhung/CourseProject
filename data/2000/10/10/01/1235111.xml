        <p>''If you had told me a year ago that I would own not one, but two pairs of blue jeans with gold sparkles on them, I would've said you were crazy,'' said Jane Long, who moved last winter from New York to Los Angeles, to be a producer for Radical Media, a multimedia production company. Still, Ms. Long said, ''the L.A. mentality of dressing like Barbie is pretty fun. You can't be too serious about your clothes out here, when half the people you meet are wearing board shorts.''</p>

        <p>''If you had told me a year ago that I would own not one, but two pairs of blue jeans with gold sparkles on them, I would've said you were crazy,'' said Jane Long, who moved last winter from New York to Los Angeles, to be a producer for Radical Media, a multimedia production company. Still, Ms. Long said, ''the L.A. mentality of dressing like Barbie is pretty fun. You can't be too serious about your clothes out here, when half the people you meet are wearing board shorts.''</p>
        <p>But Ms. Long found that Los Angeles has its own style slant, not limited to Barbie. Among her discoveries is Rebecca Rich, a designer, whose tartan halter dress and matching bag ($250 at her Waring Avenue showroom), left, can move into evening by replacing flip-flops with Manolo Blahniks ($350). Another West Coast shopping must is Curve, on North Robertson Boulevard, where Ms. Long's inner New Yorker gravitates to black pieces, but with a twist, like the Jean Yu sleeveless turtleneck ($205) below, paired with a black wool Delia skirt ($225). ''I never wear anything with sleeves in L.A.,'' Ms. Long said, ''but the turtleneck is a little nod to New York. Plus, the skirt is comfortable enough to sleep in on a plane.'' To finish the outfit? Prada shoes ($385), and a Prada bag ($890), ''big enough to hold my computer, without making me feel like president of the math club.''</p>
