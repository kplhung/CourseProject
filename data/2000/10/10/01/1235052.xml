        <p>DORY is different and difficult to decipher. Call this new Asian restaurant at 1087 Jericho Turnpike in Commack (631-543-6790) and you will be told it serves Korean-style Chinese food, yet the sign out front identifies it as a ''Chinese restaurant'' and the menu given to me listed only Chinese golden oldies like egg rolls, won-ton soup, lo mein, fried rice and moo goo gai pan. Our waiter  (who like the rest of the staff was long on hospitality but short on English) said Dory serves Chinese-American and Chinese-Korean dishes. When I said, ''would you please point to a Chinese-Korean dish on my menu,'' he reached for my wife's instead. So there are actually two different menus. No one told us that, nor does either menu have a heading (the gold covers are Chinese-American, and blue covers are Chinese-Korean). Order from the latter; that's what was done by the large family groups of Koreans, happily engaged over their bowls of noodles, rice and soup. Anyway, why order standard Chinese preparations at a place that specializes in Korean-style creations?</p>

        <p>DORY is different and difficult to decipher. Call this new Asian restaurant at 1087 Jericho Turnpike in Commack (631-543-6790) and you will be told it serves Korean-style Chinese food, yet the sign out front identifies it as a ''Chinese restaurant'' and the menu given to me listed only Chinese golden oldies like egg rolls, won-ton soup, lo mein, fried rice and moo goo gai pan. Our waiter  (who like the rest of the staff was long on hospitality but short on English) said Dory serves Chinese-American and Chinese-Korean dishes. When I said, ''would you please point to a Chinese-Korean dish on my menu,'' he reached for my wife's instead. So there are actually two different menus. No one told us that, nor does either menu have a heading (the gold covers are Chinese-American, and blue covers are Chinese-Korean). Order from the latter; that's what was done by the large family groups of Koreans, happily engaged over their bowls of noodles, rice and soup. Anyway, why order standard Chinese preparations at a place that specializes in Korean-style creations?</p>
        <p>And what is Korean-style Chinese food, you ask? Dishes that look and sound like familiar Chinese fare that receive interesting and at times unexpected spins. An example of the latter is rice topped by shredded beef, vegetables and starch noodles ($6.95) accompanied by a bowl of unannounced egg drop vegetable soup that is unceremoniously dumped over the dish. (Don't knock it until you've tried it; I thought it a tasty bargain.)</p>
        <p>Braised minced beef balls with vegetables at $12.95, the most expensive a la carte choice we ordered, turned out to be 11 refined little hamburger patties in a vegetable sauce swimming with moe'r and button mushrooms, red and green peppers, onions, carrots, scallions and cucumbers. It's a homey, mild, altogether pleasing dish of soft ingredients that is effortlessly eaten. A big bowl of noodles, with sauteed seafood in a vegetable cornstarch soup, needed squirts of soy sauce to flavor it and contained scant seafood, much of it rubbery conch.</p>
        <p>Dory's a la carte selections offer quantity and value. Its set-multicourse, more expensive meals for groups of three, four and more diners are a once-over-lightly survey course of Korean-Chinese cuisine. A recent dinner for four that cost $110 consisted of four kinds of cold dishes, shark's fin with seafood and vegetables, sliced beef with oyster sauce, egg drop soup, a hot bun, dessert and a soft drink. Fixed price dinners deliver variety, but portions are small and tend to be served too rapidly.  Additionally, diners who want clean plates with each course must request them.</p>
        <p>The cold dishes, which batted .500, were, shrimp with ketchup-like chili sauce, rubbery jelly fish covered with diced garlic and cucumber slivers, soft duck egg yolks enclosed in aspic and thin, tender soy marinated slices of beef. A tiny contingent of scallop-size shark fin slivers is nearly lost in an avalanche of sauteed vegetables, shrimp and conch. A relatively bountiful serving of tender sliced beef with oyster sauce, enlivened by vibrant seasoning, was first rate, but egg drop soup was ho hum.  The dry tasteless hot bun is best forgotten, but ripe watermelon slices and especially sweet, diminutive, homemade deep-fried corn bread balls got our attention.</p>
        <p>Dory is spare, spartan-clean and shiny-new with bare tables, artificial flowers and hard surfaces that reverberate sound when the restaurant is full. Complimentary kimchi, or spicy fermented cabbage, onions and black bean sauce, usually precedes Korean meals, while deep-fried noodles are the norm with Chinese fare.  The well-intentioned, though erratic staff, doesn't always get it right, yet like Dory itself, makes a positive impression by evening's end.</p>
        <p>Openings</p>
        <p>The Pomodoro Restaurant Group is opening a French bistro in Huntington and turning Enoteca Il Castello, its restaurant in Locust Valley, into a catering hall. The 50-seat bistro, tentatively called Pommes Frites, is replacing Il Pescatore at 55B Wall Street (631-421-4122). It will offer traditional dishes, like cassoulet, coq au vin, rabbit, bouillabaisse, filet of sole en papillote and oysters, in a dining room of antique mirrors, banquettes and a tile floor. Complete dinners including wine will cost between $25 and $35. Hugo Garcia, the maitre d'hotel at Enoteca, will run the dining room at the new spot and Ronazdo Cannas and Mariane Villasbas, two cordon bleu trained Brazilian chefs, will be the kitchen commanders.</p>
        <p>The Cooke's In, a successful little nook on Depot Road in Huntington, specializing in Southern cooking, will soon move to larger quarters, expand its menu and offer entertainment.  Juanita Cooke, the restaurant's chef and owner, is relocating Cooke's In to 276 New York Avenue (631-424-2181)  where the Colonial Diner was for years and Apretador II, a Salvadoran eatery, is now. Ms. Cooke plans to serve lunch and dinner (and a Southern-style breakfast in the future), is considering a Sunday gospel brunch and has hired Clark Stansbury, a chef at the Bear Mountain Inn and longtime friend, to join Purcess Ebanks Clark in the kitchen.</p>
        <p>Brindisi, a new 125-seat Italian restaurant, opened at 111 Jericho Turnpike in Jericho (516-876-8855) on Sept. 12. Owned by Natale Petrone and his wife, Rosemarie, who operated Il Sapore in Roslyn Heights for 15 years, Brindisi is a modestly priced (all most all of the entrees are in the $11.75 to $18.75 range) spot with an open kitchen, cathedral ceiling, garden room, fireplace and large windows facing the Jericho Turnpike.</p>
        <p>Bayview Bistro (formerly Soup du Jour), at 44 Main Street in Northport (631-262-9744), was purchased last spring by Mark Weiner, its manager and Richard Scott, his partner. Mr. Weiner and his wife, Martie, then hired Emanuel Karropoulo and Jerry Gasparro, chefs from Louis XVI and Jonathan's of Huntington, designed a new menu and opened an outdoor patio. Dinner entrees are priced from $18 (risotto with shrimp) to $66 (a 40-ounce porterhouse for two).</p>
        <p>Mi Ranchito Grill, a small storefront Latino restaurant, opened at 172 Main Street in Port Washington (516-767-1300) on Sept. 12. The low-priced eat-in-takeout spot serves three meals a day, seven days a week.</p>
        <p>Potpourri</p>
        <p>Villa Doria, 2565 Bellmore Avenue (516-785-5353), has a $25 prix fixe barbecue every Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday from 6:30 to 8:30 p.m.</p>
