      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>There is too little discussion of the reasons for juvenile crime and the use of graduated punishment and creative treatment options to address the problem. The successes enjoyed by such strategies never get as much publicity as one graphic and isolated crime. Instead, critical decisions affecting the structure of the juvenile justice system, and the lives of thousands of children with unique treatment needs, have been fueled by Colombine-type incidents and other rare but easily exploited episodes of particularly violent conduct.</p>
        <p>Rather than acknowledge that violent crime will continue to exist no matter what we do, some politicians would rather seize upon the latest tragedy and pretend that each new episode constitutes clear proof that we are not meting out sufficient punishment. Amazingly, this posturing is taking place at a time when juvenile crime is down.</p>
