        <p>The last time the Mets began a series at Pacific Bell Park, Bill Pulsipher was their starting pitcher, Rickey Henderson was the controversy of the moment and the San Francisco Giants were hopeless at their new home.</p>
        <p>That day, the Giants ended their home futility. Before the Mets arrived for a four-game series on May 1, the Giants were 1-7 at the ballpark bordering San Francisco Bay. Sweeping the Mets in May propelled them to a 54-19 home record the rest of the way.</p>
        <p>''We were probably playing our worst baseball of the year when we went to San Francisco early,'' said Mets General Manager Steve Phillips, whose team visits San Francisco for the first two games of the National League division series starting Wednesday. ''We've figured out who we are since then.''</p>
        <p>The Mets were at their best in August, when they took three of four from the Giants at Shea Stadium. The games between the teams have been marked by solid pitching -- by the Mets' Mike Hampton and Al Leiter at Shea, and by the Giants' Shawn Estes, Livan Hernandez and Russ Ortiz at both parks.</p>
        <p>Jay Payton made a breathtaking catch in San Francisco to rob Bill Mueller of a home run. That series was also notable for the first Giants home run to land in the bay, by Barry Bonds off Rich Rodriguez, and by two bench-clearing incidents in which no punches were thrown.</p>
        <p>One incident involved Mets backup catcher Todd Pratt, who initially felt that J. T. Snow had tried to take him out with a slide. The other flared up when the Giants' Marvin Benard stared down Mets reliever Dennis Cook after being hit by a pitch.</p>
        <p>''The Marvin thing was bad, but that's over with,'' Pratt said. ''I think we dropped that in the last series. There's only one thing that's important: to win one out of two there, if not both, and then come back and take two at our park.''</p>
        <p>If Hampton starts Game 1 -- as Leiter, the other candidate, thinks he will -- he will be facing a team he has owned. Hampton is 9-0 with a 3.09 earned run average against the Giants.</p>
        <p>Hampton's turnaround is a major reason for the Mets' improvement since May. The left-hander allowed five runs in five and one-third innings in his start at San Francisco on May 3, walking six and pushing his E.R.A. to 6.52.</p>
        <p>After that game -- which ended when Jeff Kent hit a three-run homer off Turk Wendell -- Hampton dressed quickly and left without speaking to reporters. He walked alone to the team hotel, stopping along the way to see a movie, and he used that time for reflection. Putting his pitching woes in perspective turned him around, Hampton said.</p>
        <p>''It just made me stop and think and not put too much emphasis on a sport, on a game,'' Hampton said. ''It's tough to do -- I take a lot of pride in what I do, and it's hard to separate the two. It's my job, it's my profession. But sometimes you have to sit back, do a little reality check, see where you are in life and say, 'Hey, it's not so bad.' ''</p>
        <p>After that game, Hampton was not so bad, either. He worked into the ninth inning in a shutout victory his next start, and has gone 13-6 with a 2.41 earned run average since the May 3 start.</p>
        <p>The Mets have played only two series with the Giants; they had at least three series with every other N.L. team except Houston.</p>
        <p>But the Mets know enough to admire what the Giants have accomplished after going 10-13 in April.</p>
        <p>''The Giants have done a super job,'' Phillips said. ''They have a solid middle of the lineup, a very productive offense. Their young pitchers have developed extremely well this year.''</p>
