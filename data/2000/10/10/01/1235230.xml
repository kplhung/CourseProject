        <p>The death of a 6-year-old boy in Elizabeth and an increase in injuries nationwide has fueled efforts by state and local officials to require children to wear helmets while riding kick scooters. The boy, Andy Alex Pino, died from head injuries late last month after being hit by a car while riding his scooter. He was the first child and the second person in the country to die in a scooter-related accident, according to the National Consumer Product Safety Commission. Even before the death, officials in Elizabeth and Jefferson Township had begun discussing local helmet requirements, and Assemblyman Gary Guear of Mercer County began drafting an amendment to the state helmet law to include scooters.</p>
