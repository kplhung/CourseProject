        <p>The jazz artist Eric Alexander returns to his alma mater, William Paterson University, this afternoon.</p>
        <p>With a dozen well-received albums under his belt, the tenor sax player has become a wunderkind on the jazz circuit thanks to his distinctive hard-bop style. Highly influenced by the likes of Dexter Gordon and George Coleman, he soon developed his own, more original sound.</p>
        <p>He is fond of letting his co-musicians take the spotlight, showing off their expertise as well as allowing them to subtly complement his. He ranges from bluesy and soulful to straight-out bop, and he will be featuring music by Harold Mabern, his former William Paterson professor, who will also play piano with the combo. Mr. Alexander and his quintet perform at 4 p.m. at the university's Wayne campus.</p>
