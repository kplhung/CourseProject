        <p>Anya Hindmarch, a British designer, has taken a cue from 1960's television for a line of Pop Art-style accessories that any Batgirl would kill for. Her ''Whaam! Boom! Kpow!'' collection of sequined handbags, $580, and Jimmy Choo for Anya Hindmarch mules, $660, right, explodes with the comic-book-style exclamations of the era's ''Batman'' series. ''My younger brother was obsessed with the show, and I was forced to watch it,'' Ms. Hindmarch said last Tuesday from London. The designer, 32, said the kitschy combination of vibrant color and groovy graphics are chic because ''fashion is quite whimsical at the moment.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Hindmarch's accessories, available at her store at 29 East 60th Street, arrive serendipitously. After a long absence from television, the vintage ''Batman'' series, which stars Adam West, returns to television in six-episode blocks beginning on Oct. 3 at 8 p.m. on the Sci-Fi Channel. Fashion fans should mark their date books: ''Catwoman's Dressed to Kill,'' a 1967 episode starring Eartha Kitt and featuring the designer Rudi Gernreich as himself, will be broadcast on Nov. 21 at 10:30 p.m. As Robin might say, ''Holy cameo appearances!''</p>
