        <p>''I was an inmate at Susanville. I joined my fire crew in December. It was nice, instead of being behind the prison wall. There are no gun towers. There are no walls. You've just got walls of flame around you. That time, the wind caused the fire to create little tornadoes. Those are unpredictable. You are risking your life, but at least you are doing something good. Though I've never really had anybody come out of one of the houses we saved and say thank you. Still, it gives me and my crew mates satisfaction. It makes us feel like somebody. When we get down off the fire line, we're scum again. But we are the ones spending 24 hours on the line, risking our lives and getting paid almost nothing for it. I feel as if I'm growing into a man.'' -- Interview by Catherine Saint Louis</p>
