        <p>FOR the last 20 years, the region's jazz fans have faithfully circled the dates on their calendars: the second Sunday of each month from September through April.</p>
        <p>The can't-miss-it attraction?</p>
        <p>Concerts presented by the Presbyterian Jazz Society in the parish hall of the landmark First Presbyterian Church on Lincoln Avenue in Mount Vernon.</p>
        <p>''Our jazz concerts are like big family reunions,'' said Dotti Johnson, secretary and board member of the Presbyterian Jazz Society.</p>
        <p>Members of the audience sit informally at tables, spreading out the food they brought for dinner, sharing a bottle of wine with those at the next table, mingling with the musicians before and after each set.</p>
        <p>Along with the down-home atmosphere, the concerts offer a chance to hear top-notch musicians at a reasonable cost. Tickets, sold in advance, are $15.</p>
        <p>While the society may not have the money to book major stars, it still manages to assemble a formidable lineup, mixing luminaries like Milt  Hinton, Dr. Billy Taylor and Clark  Terry with younger talents like the saxophonist Eric Alexander and the pianist Benny Green.</p>
        <p>In a tribute to the quality of the venue and the knowledgeable fervor of the audience, many artists have reduced their fees to fit into the society's annual budget, said Judy Wernick, a board member who helps book the acts.</p>
        <p>The society traditionally begins its concert season with a performance by the saxophonist Houston Person of Croton Falls and the vocalist Etta Jones. Of the audience, Mr. Person said, ''They like jazz the way it should be played -- bluesy and swinging.''</p>
        <p>The society was founded two decades ago by the Rev. Clinton Glenn, pastor of the First Presbyterian Church in Mount Vernon from 1975 to 1990 and now a resident of Manhattan, where he is still active in the clergy and owns a managerial development firm.</p>
        <p>Saying that he started the concert series ''purely and simply out of my love for jazz,'' Mr. Glenn said his effort was modeled after the Jazz  Vespers program that the Rev. John Garcia Gensel established at St. Peter's Lutheran Church in Manhattan, at the Citicorp building.</p>
        <p>Mr. Glenn said that leaving the society's helm in 1990 to focus on new career interests was ''tough in many respects,'' but he said it was made easier by the dedication of the society's eight board members and others devoted to the group.</p>
        <p>''They've taken up the cause and have made it a lasting resource in the community,'' he said.</p>
        <p>There is no formal connection between the First Presbyterian Church in Mount Vernon and the jazz society it houses, other than a landlord-tenant agreement and a nominal rental charge.</p>
        <p>''Frankly, I thought the imprimatur of the church would be a good marketing tool, which is how we chose the name,'' Mr. Glenn said. None of the jazz society's members, in fact, is a member of the church's congregation.</p>
        <p>Centrally situated in Mount Vernon, the church is quite a busy place. Its large, three-story residential wing serves as a homeless shelter and also houses the Mount Vernon Music Academy, where more than 300 students go for instruction.</p>
        <p>''I look at the church as a giant tree with all these different ministries nesting in its branches,'' said the Rev. Rose Niles McCrary, pastor of the First Presbyterian Church since 1996.</p>
        <p>From the start, the jazz society's concerts have been successful, with audiences usually numbering about 150. Herbert Mooney, the society's treasurer for the last five years, said that on the two occasions that he could recall when the society didn't break even on a show the reason was bad weather.</p>
        <p>To a degree, the Presbyterian Jazz Society has helped satisfy an existing cultural need. Southern Westchester had a reputable jazz scene through the 1950's, with several venues featuring live jazz. By 1980, though, the only place a jazzbo could find nourishment was at Defemio's, a restaurant-cum-jazz club in Yonkers that has a weekly jam session on Wednesday nights; but Defemio's closed two years ago.</p>
        <p>Two special events help keep the society solvent. There is the Post-Holiday Blues Party, a special fund-raising dinner dance with a live band in January, on the Saturday night before the Super Bowl. In May the society ends its season with its annual ''Tribute to a Legend'' concert, in which a renowned artist performs and is honored by the society. Last May, the society celebrated the career of Jimmy Heath, the saxophonist and composer-arranger, and the parish hall's 250-seat capacity quickly became standing room only.</p>
        <p>At each show a hat is passed for contributions to the Jazz Foundation, a nonprofit organization, which aids indigent musicians and retired jazz artists who do not have health insurance.</p>
        <p>''A lot of churches aren't comfortable with the idea of hosting what could be called a jazz club, but I think it's wonderful,'' said Ms. McCrary. ''I perceive such joy and fellowship at the jazz society concerts -- a real sense of community.''</p>
