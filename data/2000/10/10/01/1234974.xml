        <p>THE new season's crop of television shows is transmitting an oddly puritanical message: the pursuit of wealth breeds immorality -- or, at the very least, extreme vulgarity. On ''Bull,'' the new TNT series, the founder of a prosperous investment banking firm is a manipulative, coldhearted schemer who doesn't flinch from organizing an illegal trade -- and then foisting responsibility on somebody else. The young hotshot stockbrokers in ''The Street'' on Fox break up their day with quickies in the bathrooms and amuse themselves by urinating prankishly in coffee cups. On NBC's ''Titans,'' the latest nighttime soap opera from Aaron Spelling, an heir to an aeronautics fortune discovers that his former lover is about to become his stepmother -- and she's pregnant with his baby.</p>
        <p>None of these fictional concoctions, however, can hope to compete in the dubious morality department -- or even as melodrama -- with ''The Rockefellers,'' PBS's juicy (albeit soberly juicy) multigenerational biographical study of American capitalism's royal family. This engrossing two-part program, which begins Oct. 16 -- and marks the 13th season of PBS's ''American Experience'' -- serves up a lavish spread of money lust, religious fervor, philanthropic penance, sexual impropriety and even bigamy. ''The Rockefellers'' addresses head-on the ethical question that runs subliminally through those other programs: Can you do what it takes to become rich and be thought of as good? This was also the irresistible theme of ''Titan: The Life of John D. Rockefeller Sr.'' by Ron Chernow, a consultant to the PBS program and one of its expert commentators, who in his book described Rockefeller as ''an implausible blend of sin and sanctity.''</p>

        <p>THE new season's crop of television shows is transmitting an oddly puritanical message: the pursuit of wealth breeds immorality -- or, at the very least, extreme vulgarity. On ''Bull,'' the new TNT series, the founder of a prosperous investment banking firm is a manipulative, coldhearted schemer who doesn't flinch from organizing an illegal trade -- and then foisting responsibility on somebody else. The young hotshot stockbrokers in ''The Street'' on Fox break up their day with quickies in the bathrooms and amuse themselves by urinating prankishly in coffee cups. On NBC's ''Titans,'' the latest nighttime soap opera from Aaron Spelling, an heir to an aeronautics fortune discovers that his former lover is about to become his stepmother -- and she's pregnant with his baby.</p>
        <p>None of these fictional concoctions, however, can hope to compete in the dubious morality department -- or even as melodrama -- with ''The Rockefellers,'' PBS's juicy (albeit soberly juicy) multigenerational biographical study of American capitalism's royal family. This engrossing two-part program, which begins Oct. 16 -- and marks the 13th season of PBS's ''American Experience'' -- serves up a lavish spread of money lust, religious fervor, philanthropic penance, sexual impropriety and even bigamy. ''The Rockefellers'' addresses head-on the ethical question that runs subliminally through those other programs: Can you do what it takes to become rich and be thought of as good? This was also the irresistible theme of ''Titan: The Life of John D. Rockefeller Sr.'' by Ron Chernow, a consultant to the PBS program and one of its expert commentators, who in his book described Rockefeller as ''an implausible blend of sin and sanctity.''</p>
        <p>All these shows come hot on the heels of ''Survivor,'' and the attendant commentary lamenting the nation's deplorable celebration of greed, as if this were something new. But Americans have always chased money with what Europeans used to consider unseemly ardor. In 1835, in ''Democracy in America,'' Alexis de Tocqueville observed, ''I know of no country, indeed, where the love of money has taken a stronger hold on the affection of men.''</p>
        <p>Well, what's wrong with that? The question may be especially relevant now, with a clear-cut financial distinction between the (very wealthy) Republican and (merely comfortable) Democratic presidential and vice-presidential candidates. Or maybe not. Most prospective contestants for ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' seem more worried about paying their bills than the unanticipated ethical quandaries that might attach to their newly fat cash balances.</p>
        <p>Still, the responsibility that accrues to the very rich has not been an incidental concern for the country's actual titans. Andrew Carnegie believed that wealthy people should enrich society, not their heirs, and to that end gave away almost his entire fortune before he died. He once warned his fellow robber barons that ''the man who dies thus rich dies disgraced.''</p>
        <p>The Rockefellers, however, took a less apologetic stance. ''The growth of a large business is merely a survival of the fittest,'' John D. Rockefeller Jr. once noted, sounding a little like a Victorian-age antecedent of Richard Hatch, the triumphant survivor.</p>
        <p>Rockefeller elaborated: ''The American Beauty rose can be produced in the splendor and fragrance which brings cheer to its beholder only by sacrificing the early buds which grow around it. This is not an evil tendency in business. It is merely the working out of a law of nature and a law of God.''</p>
        <p>Yet this same Rockefeller, who also had to bear the burden of being called Junior, devoted much of his life to giving his family's money away, investing in medicine, science, education, the arts and foreign policy (a practice that would provide another target for the family's critics). He was merely continuing the tradition established by his father, who said his course was set by a Baptist preacher who encouraged him to make as much money as he could, and then give away as much as he could.</p>
        <p>Though the senior Rockefeller didn't seem to feel guilty at all about being rich, his heirs did grapple with their family's unsavory legacy -- which went beyond the founder's predatory business practices. The family was spawned by a bigamist and alleged rapist: John D. Sr's father, William Avery (Devil Bill) Rockefeller, a traveling salesman. Generations later, after decades of cleansing philanthropy on an enormous scale, the family's hard-won respectability would be challenged again. Its golden son, Nelson Rockefeller, who had become a national political figure, died at 70 while in the company of a young woman, in what his speechwriter Joseph E. Persico delicately described as ''undeniably intimate circumstances.''</p>
        <p>The PBS documentary underscores the impression that the Rockefeller family has always wanted (but has not always been able) to have it both ways: to be rich and good, to be powerful and beneficent, humble and lordly -- to be carrying out God's will while living well. Emblematic of the family's historic struggle was John D. Rockefeller Sr.'s decision to house his family in a mansion near Cleveland with a grand facade and a threadbare interior. His wife once told a neighbor, ''I am so glad my son has told me what he wants for Christmas, so now it can be denied him.'' When he grew up, Junior wasn't quite so harsh, though after he distributed allowances to his children he urged them not only to keep accounts but also to save 10 percent and to give away 10 percent.</p>
        <p>Despite the sort of unmitigated greed we usually see on television, a surprising number of Americans follow the Rockefeller model as best they can. At the top is Bill  Gates, who transferred $17 billion to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and then there is everyone else. Apparently there is a feeling that if you can't be as rich as Rockefeller, or even Richard Hatch, you can at least try to be good (in charity if not in personal behavior). The share of households contributing to charity has remained relatively constant between 1987 and 1998, about 70 percent, according to the most recent data from Independent Sector, a collection of voluntary organizations.</p>
        <p>Those stuck in the middle class can take comfort in the documentary's assurance that they may be lucky not to be fabulously rich. For Junior, being a Rockefeller was often agonizing, especially after a bitter union strike at a Rockefeller-owned coal mine that left 45 people dead. He suffered debilitating headaches and ultimately had to take refuge in a sanitarium.</p>
        <p>He instructed his children from the Bible, ''Unto he who much is given, much is required,'' and once wrote: ''I did not choose or seek to be the recipient of such wealth. It has not been the greatest happiness.''</p>
