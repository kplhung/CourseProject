        <p>Mike Ammann stood in front of his locker after the MetroStars' 2-0 victory over the Chicago Fire tonight and faced a crowd that was larger and closer than anything he had seen in front of the goal during the game. Walking past, defender Mike Petke laughed and said, ''Now, Ammann comes back and he's the savior.'' He walked a few more steps and turned back, nodding and acknowledging, ''Yeah, he is.''</p>
        <p>While Ammann, the MetroStars' goalkeeper, had a lot of help from his teammates, the savior description would be hard to dispute. Returning to the lineup for the first time since sustaining three broken ribs and a punctured lung on Aug. 16, injuries that were expected to end his season, Ammann provided an emotional lift for the first 76 minutes. Then, in the next two minutes, he came up with a pair of huge saves to preserve a one-goal lead.</p>
        <p>The MetroStars added another score to defeat the Fire and send the series back to Chicago on Friday for a decisive Game 3 in the Major League Soccer semifinals. Each victory is worth 3 points; a team needs 5 points to win the series.</p>
        <p>''It's what I dreamed of last night when I was thinking about the game, to go out, do my job, and help the team win,'' said Ammann, who faced just six shots and needed only three saves. ''That's what happened tonight. I never envisioned a shutout. That's only the third or fourth one all year. The score doesn't make a difference to me. It's getting 3 points and getting us to play on Friday.''</p>
        <p>As Ammann worked out this week, he surprised even his teammates when they started to hear whispers that he would return. The fiery Ammann had watched from the sidelines on Tuesday as the Fire pounded in three goals against Paul Grafer in a one-sided victory against a listless MetroStars squad. If Ammann was unsure what he could provide physically, he was certain that by getting back in the net, he could help maintain the team's focus with his vocal style.</p>
        <p>''He gave us not only good play on the field, but everything else that comes with a player that we all counted out,'' MetroStars Coach Octavio Zambrano said. ''All the credit goes to him. If there is one guy that can come back from those injuries, it's Mike. He's a tough kid. He showed today that he wanted to be with his team in those type of games. He came up big also with a couple of big saves.</p>
        <p>''We pondered whether to bring him in or not, because obviously Paul Grafer had done well for us. In these type of games you need to have a psychological push that a player like him can give. It turned out to be the right decision.''</p>
        <p>Ammann said he had hoped to make a difference.</p>
        <p>''Some of the guys were talking to me, hoping I would be able to play,'' Ammann said. ''I think, whether it's an emotional boost or not, I can go out and help them make their game easier just by communicating with them. That's what I tried to do.''</p>
        <p>The MetroStars dominated play, controlling the action and protecting Ammann every time one of the Fire's dangerous forwards entered the box. Perhaps his most anxious moment came when he came off the line and plucked the ball off the foot of Diego Gutierrez before he could get a shot off, risking a collision.</p>
        <p>Then, in the 77th minute, Ante Razov ripped a shot from the right side of the net that Ammann leaped to deflect over the crossbar. One minute later, Hristo Stoichkov blasted a shot from in front of the net that Ammann dived for, punching it wide of the net.</p>
        <p>''It was going to take a while to get into the game, into the flow of it,'' he said. ''In the first half, I didn't really have anything to do save-wise, so it makes it more difficult to get into the flow of the game. Once you get a half under your belt, you feel more comfortable.''</p>
        <p>Ammann added: ''Those are the hard games when you don't have much to do. You stand back there and kind of get cold.''</p>
        <p>Ammann appreciated his teammates' protecting him. ''I hope they do the same thing on Friday,'' he said. ''To me, that was the best effort, not the best game, but the best effort by a MetroStars team. That's what we need. We need to continue that and repeat that on Friday.''</p>
