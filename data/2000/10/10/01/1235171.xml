        <p>WHEN mutual fund investors receive tax statements for this year, some will find a few unpleasant surprises concerning capital gains.</p>
        <p>Between now and late December, the funds will pass on to shareholders the net profits realized on 2000 sales -- and there may be more than the usual amount to hand out. Last year, the red-hot stock market helped funds build up large gains, which many were forced to distribute this year because nervous investors sold their shares as the market dipped in early 2000.</p>
        <p>Unless these funds are held in tax-deferred retirement accounts, investors must report the distributions as capital gains on their income tax returns for this year, even though many will automatically reinvest those distributions in new shares.</p>
        <p>In addition to the gains distributed by a fund, an individual shareholder will also have a gain or loss when selling fund shares.</p>
        <p>''There are a lot of ticking tax bombs out there,'' said Valerie Putchaven, an analyst at Morningstar Inc. Her advice is to review fund portfolios and act now to minimize taxes in April.</p>
        <p>Investors in funds that have lost money might consider selling shares to offset big gains distributions. But Robert Willens, a tax analyst at Lehman Brothers, warned against using short-term losses to offset long-term gains on shares held more than a year. Those losses, he said, are better used to offset short-term gains, which are taxed at a higher rate. Short-term gains are taxed at up to 39.6 percent; long-term gains are taxed at up to 20 percent.</p>
        <p>It is generally up to investors to keep track of their shares and how long they have owned them, and, when recognizing gains, to sell first the ones they have held for longer periods.</p>
        <p>Investors who have been in a fund for a year or less and receive capital gains distributions should still report them as long term, said Evan H. Snapper, a senior tax manager at Ernst &amp; Young, because under Internal Revenue Service rules, all distributions from funds are considered long term.</p>
        <p>And investors can receive gains distributions even if the value of their holdings has dropped since they bought into the fund.</p>
        <p>When selling shares, investors should be careful not to run afoul of the so-called I.R.S. wash-sales rule. Under it, if an investor buys the same fund or security within 30 days of a sale, the sale is not recognized for tax purposes.</p>
        <p>Investors should think twice about buying fund shares near the end of the year, when most funds pay their annual dividends, Mr. Snapper said. That is because all shareholders as of the date of record receive a full year's worth of dividends and capital gains distributions, even if they have owned shares for only one day. (Exact payment dates are available from a fund's management.)</p>
        <p>And because undistributed dividends are part of a fund's assets, the fund's share price drops when dividends are paid.</p>
        <p>FUND holders might also want  to maximize their 2000 investing expenses. For tax purposes, these are ''miscellaneous expenses,'' which are deductible to the extent that they exceed 2 percent of adjusted gross income. Deductible expenses include the costs of mutual fund investing books, newspapers and magazines with investment advice, investment counseling and advisory service, postage and telephone calls related to investing.</p>
        <p>Investors might want to ''bunch'' these payments before the end of the year so they can be deducted for this year. (If income is expected to drop next year, investors might want to delay the expenses until January.)</p>
        <p>Because fund investors have so little control over taxes, Representative Jim Saxton, the New Jersey Republican who is chairman of the Congressional Joint Economic Committee, has proposed permitting investors to defer taxes on reinvested capital gains distributions of up to $3,000 a year ($6,000 for couples) until they sell the shares.</p>
        <p>But that is unlikely to happen, said Mr. Willens of Lehman Brothers. ''It depends on the outcome of the election, but I don't see an appetite in the current administration to reduce capital gains taxes.''</p>
