        <p>FOR several years before their 50th wedding anniversary, my partner's parents, Frank and Lucy, knew exactly how they wanted to celebrate the occasion.

        <p>FOR several years before their 50th wedding anniversary, my partner's parents, Frank and Lucy, knew exactly how they wanted to celebrate the occasion. ''In March of 2000,'' they would tell their children, their children's spouses and partners, and their grandchildren, ''we're taking all of you on a Caribbean cruise.''</p>
        <p>No one doubted their sincerity or generosity, but still it was with a pleasant sense of unreality that we finally convened in San Juan, P.R., in March to board the brand new Ocean Princess. Nineteen strong and ranging in age from almost 7 to 70, we had come from Iowa and California for a floating family reunion, a seven-night cruise with stops at Trinidad, Barbados, Antigua, Martinique and St. Thomas.</p>
        <p>It was a first cruise for everyone but Frank and Lucy, and it was only the fifth voyage for the 1,950-passenger, 77,000-ton Ocean Princess. Operated by Princess Cruises, a subsidiary of the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company of London, the ship had come into service a month earlier.</p>
        <p>It's a handsome vessel, inside and out. The long, sloping prow creates a streamlined profile for a ship that is 14 stories tall and 856 feet long. Inside, subdued lighting, potted palms and lots of wood paneling give most of the public areas the understated look of a classic ocean liner.</p>
        <p>One exception is the glitzy, four-story atrium adjacent to the two main dining rooms. With its boutiques, marble and shiny brass, the atrium seemed like an upscale shopping mall (except when tables piled  with bargain merchandise periodically appeared outside the shops, making it seem more like Filene's Basement).</p>
        <p>The Ocean Princess has the casino, fitness center, live shows, four pools and choice of restaurants you'd expect on a ship this big and new, but my favorite feature turned out to be far more elemental: the fresh, balmy sea air my partner, Mac, and I breathed day and night thanks to the sliding glass door and private balcony of our outside cabin. Of the ship's 975 staterooms, 410  have balconies, and at roughly 4 by 10 feet, ours was large enough to fit two chairs and a small table, where most mornings we had a light room-service breakfast while watching the gymnastics of flying fish.</p>
        <p>The 19 of us were spread among six identical aft cabins; Mac and I had one to ourselves, as did Frank and Lucy, and the rest of our group occupied the remaining four. The cabins were on the Aloha deck, the 11th highest of 14 decks and one that gave us lofty views of sea and port. Conveniently situated just above us was the Riviera deck, with its three outdoor pools, gymnasium and spa.</p>
        <p>While most staterooms have a queen-size bed or two twins that can be made into a queen, our group had four-berth cabins. Three of the berths fold out of the walls and a twin serves as a sofa during the day -- a fairly tight fit when all four are occupied, although the wall of glass and the balcony beyond make it feel less cramped.</p>
        <p>Closets were ample for two people -- four was stretching it -- and cabins were equipped with a safe, desk-dresser, small refrigerator, telephone and television. Each bed had its own reading light. The plush terry cloth robes were a nice touch, and the tiny bathrooms had a stall shower, wash basin and seemingly endless supply of hot water.</p>
        <p>As handsome and amenity-filled as the ship was, the service was its most impressive feature. The staff, which hailed from Central Europe, the Philippines, Italy, Britain and other countries, usually struck a note that was friendly, not chummy; helpful, not obsequious. I was especially impressed by the special attention given to Frank and Lucy's anniversary. One of their sons had written to Princess and to a friend of his who knew someone at the cruise line to ask if something special could be done to recognize his parents' milestone.</p>
        <p>The result was a congratulatory note, flowers and bottle of champagne from the captain, a fancy cake presented with much fanfare at the end of our second formal dinner, and an invitation for all of us to visit the bridge during the sail-away from Martinique that night. During the bridge visit, we chatted with the captain and his officers and watched in awe as they maneuvered their massive, $300 million vessel out of an impossibly narrow space.</p>
        <p>Each night in the dining room, we had three adjacent tables and our own waiter, a wry, bespectacled Hungarian named Levent, who told us he'd postponed starting a veterinary practice to see the world for a few years. The food was uniformly good --  favorites like tender Nebraska prime rib; wonderful pastas sauced by our Italian head waiter; seafood dishes like tilapia in a citrus-caper sauce; and always a nice selection of vegetarian and ''healthy choice'' dishes.</p>
        <p>It was great fun to watch the younger members of the family -- whose dining-out experience was mostly of the fast-food type -- rise to the challenge of ordering from a multicourse menu. Gently coached and encouraged by Levent, the kids became savvy restaurant patrons. They tried escargots or asparagus tips in puff pastry, ordered a starter or two in lieu of a full meal when they weren't very hungry, or requested an extra dessert when they just couldn't decide which of two to choose.</p>
        <p>Princess bills itself as ''the Love Boat,'' and in the weeks before our cruise, I kept spotting news reports of romance-related publicity stunts preceding the launch of the Ocean Princess. From the moment we stepped on board, however, it was clear that the ship would be as much ''the family boat'' as ''the love boat.'' I saw plenty of hand-holding couples of all ages, but also parents with children, and a number of groups like ours that included three generations.</p>
        <p>Surprisingly, although there were 2,004 people aboard -- well above the official two-to-a-cabin capacity -- the ship did not seem crowded, and everyone seemed to get along fine. I have a fond memory of Kate, age ''6 3/4'' chatting with newfound friends in their 30's and 40's as they all sat one evening in an outdoor whirlpool.</p>
        <p>The Ocean Princess has indoor activity centers geared for smaller children and teenagers, although none of the younger people in our group seemed interested because there were more than enough cousins with whom to swim, explore the ship and -- in the case of the teenage boys -- make raids on the round-the-clock buffet (from 7:30 p.m. to 4 a.m., it's bistro-style table service). In fact, even we adults seemed more inclined to read, visit and relax by the pool than, say, play a round of virtual golf or attend an aerobics class.</p>
        <p>I had every intention of using the well-equipped gym, but a sinus infection -- quickly dealt with by the ship's doctor -- and tropical lassitude got the better of me. I did, however, make several forays to the library, have my hair cut in the salon ($25) and take slow walks on the Promenade Deck, whose broad, teak path outfitted with canopied steamer deck chairs seemed a world away from the sun-tanning crowds  around the main pool. I also indulged in a terrific massage at the spa ($90 for 50 minutes); the masseur, however, should rethink his post-treatment practice of bluntly suggesting a 15 percent tip.</p>
        <p>We picked up the pace during day trips at our ports of call, each of which Mac and I had researched using guidebooks and the Internet before leaving. Our homework, supplemented by guidebooks in the ship's library, freed us from total reliance on organized shore excursions or the shopping-heavy port information provided by Princess, and allowed us to briefly sample island life while escaping the cruise-ship hordes.</p>
        <p>For each island, our goals were simple: see one cultural or historical site, have lunch at a nontouristy place and visit one beach for an afternoon swim before heading back to the ship. By using taxis we shared with others in our family group or by just walking, we were able to achieve at least two of our goals on every island, and at a cost that was no greater (and sometimes less) than ship-organized excursions.</p>
        <p>In Port-of-Spain, Trinidad, for example, our long, fascinating walk around this richly varied city of Afro-Caribbean and East Indian culture and a visit to the botanical gardens were followed by a vegetarian lunch at a popular neighborhood food stall. On Barbados, our custom taxi tour included Harrison's Caves (an extensive network of caverns with streams, waterfalls, stalactites and stalagmites) and the Flower Forest (50 acres of flowers and fruit trees).</p>
        <p>We then had a wonderful buffet of island dishes in an old wooden house that is now Brown Sugar, a restaurant frequented by government office workers. The Barbados excursion ended with a swim at a powdery sand beach that we had almost to ourselves.</p>
        <p>ON Martinique, one of the highlights of the trip, eight of us hired a van for a trip through the inland rain forest and flower farms to St.-Pierre, destroyed in 1902 by Mount Pelee's eruption. There, we enjoyed French-Creole dishes like spicy kid stew and a salad of avocado and salt cod on the flower-fringed terrace of Le Fromager, a restaurant overlooking the Caribbean. On our return along the coast, we made an impromptu stop in a tiny seaside village to watch fishermen clean a shark they'd just caught.</p>
        <p>Mac and I did sign on for one ship-organized trip, a $49-a-person catamaran excursion with about 60 other Ocean Princess passengers to Antigua's barrier reef for an hour of snorkeling, followed by a swim at an unremarkable beach. I had a good time even though a recent eruption of the Soufriere  Hills volcano on nearby Montserrat had clouded the sea with ash and reduced underwater visibility.</p>
        <p>On the ride back to port, when the crew broke out the rum punch, fired up the recorded reggae and got a few people dancing, Mac was drafted by a fellow passenger to lead the wobbling conga line -- a goofy, happy and sunburned group -- around the deck.</p>
        <p>Before dinner on our last evening on board, I sat on our balcony as the Ocean Princess slowly pivoted from the dock at Charlotte Amalie, in a large, graceful arc, and headed out to sea. From one deck above, where a poolside sail-away party was going on, I could faintly hear the Sarah Brightman-Andrea Boccelli recording of ''Time to Say Goodbye,'' that lilting Italian-English ballad.</p>
        <p>I smiled, thinking how shameless it was of Princess to play the song -- like a swelling movie soundtrack -- as we steamed away from our final port of call. But I will concede that the smallest of lumps had somehow found its way to my throat.</p>
