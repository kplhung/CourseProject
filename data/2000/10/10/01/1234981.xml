        <p>JUST before Orson Welles died, as the scene is presented in ''War of the Worlds,'' a new biographical drama that opens the Next Wave festival on Wednesday in the Harvey Theater at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, he uttered a last word that could be taken as the key to his whole personality.</p>
        <p>The word was ''Thorne,'' the name of a room he often visited at the Art Institute of Chicago when he was young. ''It was a place of magic for him,'' said Naomi Iizuka, who wrote the script in collaboration with Anne Bogart, the artistic director of the SITI Company, which helped create the play and will perform it at the festival.</p>

        <p>JUST before Orson Welles died, as the scene is presented in ''War of the Worlds,'' a new biographical drama that opens the Next Wave festival on Wednesday in the Harvey Theater at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, he uttered a last word that could be taken as the key to his whole personality.</p>
        <p>The word was ''Thorne,'' the name of a room he often visited at the Art Institute of Chicago when he was young. ''It was a place of magic for him,'' said Naomi Iizuka, who wrote the script in collaboration with Anne Bogart, the artistic director of the SITI Company, which helped create the play and will perform it at the festival.</p>
        <p>Could Welles's last word actually have been ''Thorne''? Could there be such a startling parallel between the life of this actor, director and bon vivant and the plot of the film ''Citizen Kane,'' Welles's masterpiece in which the title character, the newspaper magnate Charles Foster Kane, speaks a similarly evocative name, ''Rosebud,'' just before he dies?</p>
        <p>''That's speculative,'' Ms. Iizuka conceded. ''Anne and SITI and I are speculating about that, in the same fashion that Welles speculated about Rosebud.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps not exactly in the same fashion. When Welles made ''Rosebud'' the last word of Kane, he was probably having sly fun with William Randolph Hearst, the real-life figure on whom Kane is often thought to have been based). Hearst did have a Rosebud who was dear to him. It was not his childhood sled, as in the movie, but rather his adult mistress, Marion Davies, whom he had given the pet name Rosebud. More to the point, when ''Citizen Kane'' came out in 1941, Hearst had not actually uttered any last words; he was still alive.</p>
        <p>But to the creators of ''War of the Worlds,'' part of a surge of new works about Welles, fact is not relevant. ''Welles was very interested in fiction, often including fictions he told about himself,'' said Ms. Bogart, who conceived and directed this latest in a number of avant-garde biographical dramas dealing with what she calls ''big people.'' Previous subjects: Andy Warhol, Robert Wilson, Marshall McLuhan; present or future subjects: Virginia Woolf, Robert Rauschenberg, Leonard Bernstein. ''The people who know my work will be surprised at how linear this one is,'' Ms. Bogart said.</p>
        <p>As in most of her productions, she said, she started with a question. This time it was, ''When did news become entertainment?''</p>
        <p>She thought the answer was ''The War of the Worlds,'' the 1938 radio play that made the 23-year-old Orson Welles a star. He turned the H. G. Wells tale about a Martian invasion of Earth into a simulated news broadcast that was so convincing it panicked listeners across the country.</p>
        <p>''But then I changed the question,'' Ms. Bogart recalled. ''It became, 'How do you ever know a person?' ''</p>
        <p>' ''War of the Worlds' is not a documentary,'' she added. ''We use the poetic language of the stage.'' Many characters are composites or invented outright. ''It tells his story,'' she said, ''but I can't say it's his life.''</p>
        <p>If not his life, it is, in a way, his movie. ''War of the Worlds,'' which also has been presented at the Humana Theater Festival in Louisville, Ky., and the Edinburgh Festival in Scotland, is, of course, named for the radio broadcast. It is ''Citizen Kane,'' though, that is the more direct inspiration for ''War of the Worlds.''</p>
        <p>In the play, Welles is given the Kane treatment, the story of his life and work explored as if it were a mystery. The play appropriates the film's structure and even some of its scenes and techniques. (Hence the Thorne speculation.)</p>
        <p>Along with all this invention and meditation, there are some facts in the play, and they too are surprising.</p>
        <p>''He wasn't a tragic character,'' said Ms. Bogart about Welles. ''He had a fantastic life, full of traveling and people and love and great restaurants. I think audiences will be surprised by the breadth of his work, and just the quantity of it, if not the quality. At the end of the play, we list the films he was involved in; there must be 100, and that's not even a complete list.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Bogart and her company are far from the only artists who have  become taken with the man and his work. Fifteen years after his death, Orson Welles -- boy genius turned portly outcast, film pioneer, theatrical innovator -- is experiencing a comeback.</p>
        <p>AMAZON.COM lists 45 different titles about him. (It lists 34 about William Randolph Hearst.) The respected Welles biographer Simon Callow is soon to come out with his second and last volume.</p>
        <p>''RKO 281,'' a movie shown last November on HBO and now out on video, tells the story of the making of ''Citizen Kane'' (''RKO 281'' was the way RKO, the studio that financed  ''Citizen Kane,'' referred to Welles's project before its release). It is based on the 1997 documentary ''The Battle Over 'Citizen Kane,' '' which was nominated for an Academy Award.</p>
        <p>A month later came the theatrical release of Tim Robbins's film ''Cradle Will Rock,'' which tells several true stories from the 1930's, including that of Welles's defiant staging of Marc Blitzstein's pro-union musical ''The Cradle Will Rock'' over government objections. (The Jean Cocteau Repertory Company is currently staging a revival of Blitzstein's musical at the Bouwerie Lane Theater.) In an irony that Welles fans note with some bitterness, a year before his death, Welles wrote his own screenplay about this episode from his past, with the title ''The Cradle Will Rock,'' but he could not get the financing to make it into a film.</p>
        <p>''It's kind of artistic necrophilia,'' Henry Jaglom, a filmmaker and one-time Welles collaborator, told The Hollywood Reporter. ''There is all this interest in him and his work, but when he was alive he was cast aside.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, also last year, William Hurt starred in ''The Big Brass Ring,'' a film about a gubernatorial candidate threatened by a scandalous past, which was adapted directly from another screenplay that Welles wrote, in 1982, and could not get produced.</p>
        <p>Even the United States Postal Service has gotten into the act, last year issuing an ''Orson Welles's 'Citizen Kane' '' postage stamp.</p>
        <p>The fascination with Welles is continuing this year on the stage. ''Orson's Shadow,'' written by Austin Pendleton and produced by the Steppenwolf Theater Company in Chicago, tells the story of Welles's production of Ionesco's ''Rhinoceros'' at the Royal Court Theater in London. At the urging of the theater critic Kenneth Tynan, he directed Laurence Olivier and Olivier's new love, Joan Plowright.</p>
        <p>''It's a mystery to me why he's in the zeitgeist,'' said Ms. Bogart. ''I was disappointed that this person that I spent years researching is suddenly everywhere. I thought, 'This was mine!' ''</p>
        <p>For Ms. Bogart, doing a play about Welles offered her a chance to translate close-ups, panning and point-of-view techniques to the stage: ''So much of my work as a director is deeply affected by cinematic technique. Too much of our theater is stuck in the 19th century, with box sets and living rooms.'' Still, she said: ''I will never make a film. I'm interested in being in the same room with people, breathing common air.''</p>
