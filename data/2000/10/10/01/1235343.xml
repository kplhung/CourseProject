        <p>FOUR years ago, had you told Marion Jones that in the 2000 Games she would win five medals, most likely she would have been ecstatic. Some runners train a lifetime to reach the Games, competing but never winning a medal. Their careers are defined by simply getting there.</p>
        <p>So in 1996, having missed the Atlanta Games with injury, the thought of winning five medals would have been staggering for Jones.</p>
        <p>Somewhere between Atlanta and Australia, Jones got gumption -- maybe Nike marketing, maybe a suddenly inflated sense of her abilities, maybe a sense that her time had arrived. Jones began telling writers around 1998 that she wanted to win five medals in Sydney and she wanted them all to be gold: the 100 meters, the 200 meters, the long jump, the 4x100-meter relay and the 4x400-meter relay. Critics thought she was crazy, told her not to try, and her goal became a huge target.</p>
        <p>Jones ended her competition last night, the quest completed but the goal unfulfilled. She won her five Olympic medals, except two were bronze. She was unchallenged in winning the 100 and 200 meters; fell short in the long jump; anchored the bronze medal 4x100-relay team; and ran the fastest leg of the 4x400 gold medal relay.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, the Bahamas, the little country with the gigantic women's 4x100-meter relay team, snatched the gold medal and Jamaica won the silver. The United States, fumbling the baton handoffs on the second and third exchanges, earned bronze, and they would not have gotten that had it not been for Jones's anchor leg. She got the baton trailing the third place team by about 7 meters. She made up the distance and nudged ahead to give the United States -- missing two of its top sprinters, Gail Devers and Inger Miller with hamstring injuries -- a disappointing but respectable third.</p>
        <p>No time to rest. While her 4x100 teammates went out for their medal ceremony, Jones was warming up for her final event -- the grueling 4x400 relay. She hadn't run that relay since her sophomore year at the University of North Carolina, and she made it clear after the race that she would not add the 400 meters to her portfolio.</p>
        <p>''I have no desire, none, to run the 400 meters competitively,'' Jones said. ''It's a race that's very challenging. Right now my career has other challenges.'' She paused, smiled and added, ''including the long jump.''</p>
        <p>The 4x400 relay team was counting on her yesterday, and that's what counted.</p>
        <p>''I felt surprisingly good,'' she said. ''I was concerned that when I hit the straightaway my legs were going to say, 'No more, Marion, no more.''' They didn't.</p>
        <p>If there was a race, an event, that told you all you needed to know about Marion Jones -- despite the fizzle in the long jump and the bronze in the 4x100 relay -- the leg she ran on the 4x400 relay said it all.</p>
        <p>The first two legs ended with the United States neck and neck with Jamaica. Jones took the baton and opened a 10-meter lead. She handed off with a 20-meter lead, winning her third gold medal with maybe her most impressive performance of all.</p>
        <p>This was a bizarre day for the United States in what had been an odd Olympic competition. In a way, this was a transition Olympics for the United States. A year when many established stars, the pillars of United States track and field, are making their exit. Michael Johnson will not compete in another Olympics; this was probably the last Olympics for Devers, and for Suzy Favor Hamilton, who had to be taken off the track in a wheelchair after collapsing in the 1,500.</p>
        <p>That leaves the likes of Marion Jones, 24, and Maurice Greene, 26, to carry the torch.</p>
        <p>Greene, the animated 100-meter champion, led the United States to a rousing victory in the men's 4x100-meter relay. After the victory, Greene, Jon Drummond, Bernard Williams III and Brian Lewis had a victory celebration that will follow -- or haunt -- them for several years. The danced, they skipped, they gawked, they clowned, even on the medal stand during the national anthem. They posed, flexed and gestured like the minstrels so popular in Australia during the 19th century.</p>
        <p>There were some boos, some cheers. Afterward, a cascade of  questions from the track and field  media and other athletes who felt the  sprinters' vaudeville act -- which the  media had built up and encouraged  -- had gone too far.</p>
        <p>Later, in the face of questioning by  journalists, Drummond apologized to anyone who had taken offense.</p>
        <p>''We have so much emotion bottled  up that we have to keep contained  due to the fact that we have to focus  on our race,'' he said. ''When it's all over and you absolutely have that opportunity to exhale, it's not that we're trying to offend anyone, we're just expressing ourselves the way we know how.''</p>
        <p>The stoic Michael Johnson, who helped the United States win gold in the 4x400 relay and who has been  critical of Greene in the past, said he didn't see the display but drew chuckles when he added, ''But I can imagine.'' Johnson really can't imagine. It is not his style nor his temperament to let loose, cut the rug, act a little crazy and silly -- then grow from it. Johnson said United States track and field had to grow up and mature, that younger runners had to learn how to better carry the torch and bear the burden.</p>
        <p>''If my leaving the sport is leaving it in Marion's hands,'' Johnson said, ''I'm not saying that, you said that, but if that is the case then I would say this is being left in very good and capable hands.</p>
        <p>''Marion is a tremendous athlete with a lot of talent, carries herself with a lot of class and knows what she wants to do, and isn't afraid to state that and come out here and give it a try.''</p>
