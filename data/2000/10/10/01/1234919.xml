        <p>THE Talmud and</p>
        <p>the Internet</p>
        <p>A Journey Between Worlds.</p>
        <p>By Jonathan Rosen.</p>
        <p>132 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux. $16.</p>
        <p>Jonathan Rosen, author of the novel ''Eve's Apple,'' is an accomplished writer. He now reveals an interest in Talmud and a hands-on acquaintance with the Internet. Though acknowledging that he is a great expert in respect of neither, merely a keen amateur, he has been struck by certain thought-provoking resemblances between these two inexhaustible sources of information.</p>
        <p>The result is an admirable essay -- somewhat old-fashioned but benignly so: carefully shaped; having an air of relaxation, yet with no hint of looseness in the writing. Reading and rereading Rosen's little book I found myself thinking, to my own surprise, of E. M. Forster. Forster, living and working in modern Alexandria, would study the great theologians and philosophers of the ancient city. Serious but rarely solemn, he would muse on the relations between the One and the Many, or on disputes about the nature of Christ's humanity, or about the ways in which the past can persist in the present.</p>
        <p>In something like the same way, Jonathan Rosen broods about the wisdom and martyrdom of Akiba, and the mock funeral of Yochanan ben Zakkai, who was to found the yeshiva ''that helped secure the survival of Judaism.'' He meditates on the survival of the Western Wall, relic of a past that keeps so powerful a hold on the present. He makes use of what Forster called ''rhythms,'' gently insistent little phrases, often unexpectedly repeated, which do much to bind together apparently disparate reflections and contribute to the shapeliness of the whole work.</p>
        <p>Moreover, those repetitions reflect Rosen's sense of the repetitions and ironies of the Jewish tradition, some exemplified by the history of his family. He considers the contrast between the fate of his grandmothers, one murdered in 1939, the other, much loved, who lived on in the comfort of New York; and the contrast between the harsh lives of immigrant Jews and his own relatively safe modern life. He takes his wife to Scotland to see where his father, conveyed there in a Kindertransport at the beginning of the war, spent the years of the Holocaust living in a Scottish mansion; in that peaceful, mostly happy place he learned of his father's death in Buchenwald. Rosen himself chose to be married on the anniversary of Kristallnacht, and at the end of the essay announces that he is expecting the birth of a first child in 1999, an event for which the date forecast by the experts was also Nov. 10.</p>
        <p>Such rhythms occurring amid the disparities of experience, sometimes strange, sometimes terrible, are the material of Rosen's musings: ''The chaos and the incongruities, it turns out, are part of the truth.'' And that thought leads him back once more to the Internet, its chaos and incongruities and its sudden unforeseen linkages, as when he realizes that the mansion in which his father spent years of his childhood belonged to the Balfour family, and that the Balfour Declaration, pledging British support for a Jewish national home in Palestine, had been drafted in that very house. Once again his ''rhythms'' echo the rhythms of history.</p>
        <p>Of course the parallel with Forster cannot be pushed too far, if only because Rosen is firmly committed to his Jewishness, largely secular though it is, while Forster was committed to nothing that could be said to have an official religious connection. His admiration for argumentative church fathers and neo-Platonic philosophers seems entirely disinterested, as Rosen's talk of the rabbis is not. But though it may be that Forster was a skeptical English liberal, and in any case seems at the moment to be having one of his periodic slumps in reputation, I dare say Rosen would still not think it a disparagement to be compared with him as an essayist.</p>
        <p>We learn from Rosen's book that the basis of the resemblance between the Talmud and the Internet lies in the fact that everything can be found in either of them if you know how and where to look. It is an agreeable chance that the Talmudic word for tractate, masechet, means ''webbing'' -- we are dealing with two different forms of World Wide Web.</p>
        <p>Talmud is infinitely extensible and astonishingly absorbent: Maimonides labored to codify it for more convenient use, but his work was simply swallowed by the huge book he had attempted to replace. The great commentaries of the 11th-century scholar Rashi, and the commentaries on Rashi's commentaries, are similarly absorbed into the whole. The very layout of the pages makes it possible to think that there is maintained a ceaseless conversation across time between ancient and modern rabbis. Everything is already there, yet it can be added to; and all of it must be continually studied. A rabbinical fancy places Moses at the back of Akiba's class, a mere beginner in the exposition of Torah; even God, it is suggested, needs to study his own book, with its inexhaustible freight of doctrines, stories, disagreements.</p>
        <p>Rosen writes with fine enthusiasm on this vast, ever-growing compilation, which for Jews took the place of the Temple and which plentifully records ''the free play of great minds, the pressures of exile, the self-conscious need to keep a civilization together'' in alien cultures that worshiped the Word made flesh, while they worshiped the word alone. Yet he can still compare a page of Talmud to a home page on the Internet, where few would argue for divine inspiration. Despite all its junk and jumble, the Internet also presents ''a world of unbounded curiosity, of argument and information, where anyone with a modem can wander out of the wilderness for a while, ask a question and receive an answer.''</p>
        <p>Rosen contrives many artful divagations. One is on Book XI of the ''Odyssey,'' which describes the hero's visit to the underworld and his vain attempt to embrace the shade of his mother. Another elegant sequence concerns Henry Adams, the Virgin and the dynamo and Chartres cathedral, considered as a stony Christian equivalent of Talmud. Even more central to his thinking is a brief study of the Jewish historian Josephus, one of Rosen's heroes despite his being ''a liar, a coward and a traitor.''</p>
        <p>Josephus was a Jewish general, and when his forces were defeated by Vespasian he defected to the Romans. But his history of ''The Jewish War'' provides the best eyewitness account of the destruction of the Temple, and a great deal more. He wrote in times, and of times, when history was inseparably involved with religion, yet did so in a secular, almost modern way. Although always a Jew, Josephus wrote about Jews in Greek, and for a gentile audience. He was concerned with fact, with ''the bricks-and-mortar world of the actual Temple'' rather than with fantastic doctrinal refinements like the meticulous rabbinical rulings about work on the Sabbath, which had their origin in the mystique of the Temple, a Temple of the mind.</p>
        <p>Much may be said against him, but Josephus is among the world's most admired historians, whereas his contemporary Yochanan ben Zakkai is honored almost exclusively in what is after all a rather recondite religious tradition. Yet Josephus is trapped in history, while ben Zakkai is free of time. The worldview of Rosen needs them both, with all their contrarieties. He asks himself whether he is not making Josephus and ben Zakkai ''the historical equivalent of my two grandmothers -- the bearers of twin legacies, both of which I am heir to, and which I would like in some way to reconcile.''</p>
        <p>The analogy between Talmud and Internet finally breaks down because ''the Internet has no moral center.'' But it still has great value for modern people who need to make contact with some kind of order and connectedness in a chaotic age. Rosen, remembering (but misquoting) T. S. Eliot, says it provides them with fragments to shore against their ruins. It helps them to study those incongruities that are necessarily part of the truth, and to make connections, however improbable. And all through this humane and gentle book one is reminded of the famous epigraph of Forster's ''Howards End'': ''Only connect.'' Connecting is a practice encouraged by both Talmud and Internet, and by Jonathan Rosen as well.</p>
