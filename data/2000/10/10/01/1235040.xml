        <p>THE children packed inside the auditorium at the Pulaski Street elementary school in Riverhead on a recent afternoon might have yawned or fidgeted when the man in the suit strode in. Instead they raised the rafters with screams of excitement.</p>
        <p>Too bad for the visitor, Rick A. Lazio, that the students are too young to vote. But if his preteen-idol welcome was a reflection of the political leanings of the children's parents and teachers, the din was music to a Long Island native son who will need all the local enthusiasm he can muster on Nov. 7, when New York voters will elect him or Hillary Rodham Clinton to the United States Senate.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Lazio departed several minutes later, after being mobbed by his young admirers, he seemed elated.</p>
        <p>''I guess those children weren't scared of you,'' said someone outside, and Mr. Lazio, on his way back to his campaign bus, laughed as genuinely as the children had cheered. He laughed again, but more softly, when a young man in a passing car called out, ''Beat her up, Rick!''</p>
        <p>Political analysts on both sides agreed that Mr. Lazio, who has represented the Second Congressional District in Suffolk County for eight years, will need a solid boost from his home base if he is to win.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio's staff said enthusiastic welcomes on Long Island, such as the one he received in Riverhead, and the candidate's deep local roots gave him a regional edge. Clinton strategists said Mrs. Clinton's stature and command of the issues would sway the balance in her favor, cutting into if not overcoming Mr. Lazio's margin of support on the Island.</p>
        <p>Local pride in Mr. Lazio's rising star has been most apparent in Babylon and Islip, the predominantly Republican, middle-income and blue-collar South Shore towns at the core of the Second Congressional District. The district also includes small parts of Huntington and Smithtown.</p>
        <p>''He's a local boy, he really cares about the community and he's a real Long Islander,'' said Thomas DiCicco, who owns Watson Auto Repair Service in West Islip and lives nearby in Brightwaters, where Mr. Lazio resides.</p>
        <p>Mr. DiCicco said he had known the Lazio family for 25 years, and it was hard to find anyone in West Islip who didn't claim Mr. Lazio as an acquaintance and applaud his success.</p>
        <p>''He lives in our situation and he knows what the people's views are,'' said Valerie Butindaro, 21, of West Islip, who works the counter at Sequams Colony Deli in West Islip and is a part-time student at Suffolk County Community College. ''It's a real morale booster that he's running. He has my vote.''</p>
        <p>Nick LoMonaco is the owner of Villa Monaco in West Islip, where Mr. Lazio grew up in a neighborhood near Montauk Highway. ''I know Rick and I want to see him in there,'' he said. ''To have someone from around the corner in the Senate, that would be like having a rainbow over us.''</p>
        <p>He might also have mentioned a pot of gold. Long Island's most famous living politician, Alfonse M. D'Amato, is credited with steering hundreds of millions of dollars worth of federal grants and contracts to Long Island during his 18 years in the Senate. Presumably some of Mr. Lazio's local support is based on expectations that he would restore a Long Island gravy train that has had no conductor since Mr. D'Amato was defeated in 1998.</p>
        <p>But another Long Island Republican who ran for the Senate said there would be limits to what Mr. Lazio could do as a Long Island partisan.</p>
        <p>''There would certainly be an advantage to Long Island because he knows it very well and the better you know an area the better you can serve it,'' said Robert R. McMillan, who ran against Daniel P. Moynihan in 1988. ''So certainly the area you come from is never given short shrift. But at the same time, you are the Senator from New York and you have to represent everybody.''</p>
        <p>Mr. McMillan, a lawyer in Melville, said Mr. Lazio needed to show his command of issues upstate while still protecting his Long Island advantage. ''You have to play to your strength, and the strength for Lazio is of course suburban Long Island,'' he said. ''And if you will notice, he has been spending a lot more time on Long Island lately.''</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the Lazio campaign, Bryan Flood, a former resident of Ronkonkoma, said Mr. Lazio's record of ''working for Long Island'' would assure strong support in the Senate race. ''Long Island is Lazio territory,'' he said. ''Every poll out there seems to suggest that Long Islanders strongly support him.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Flood cited a recent Marist College poll that showed Mr. Lazio leading Mrs. Clinton two-to-one among suburban voters. Lee Miringoff, the director of the Marist College Poll, confirmed the results and said they were from polling done on Sept. 19 and 20 in Westchester, Rockland and Long Island. ''It's a very wide margin,'' Dr. Miringoff said. ''Mrs. Clinton has had trouble in the suburbs all along.''</p>
        <p>But one top Democrat said Mr. Lazio might not win the walkover victory on Long Island that Republicans expected.</p>
        <p>''Long Island is a battleground and it is bad news for Rick Lazio because it shouldn't be for a native son,'' said Judith Hope, the state Democratic chairwoman and a resident of East Hampton. ''I think Long Islanders are savvy enough to understand that we need a very strong and effective advocate in the U.S. Senate who can step into the shoes of Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Jacob Javits and Bobby Kennedy, all giants. And I think they will see Hillary Clinton as a woman who can do that.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Hope said Mr. Lazio had not endeared himself to women voters in the first debate on Sept. 13, when Mr. Lazio crossed the stage to demand that Mrs. Clinton sign an agreement to forgo soft money. Some voters saw Mr. Lazio's behavior as bullying.</p>
        <p>''Women have expressed to me their dismay at what they saw as a performance that revealed his immaturity,'' Ms. Hope said.</p>
        <p>State Assemblywoman Patricia Acampora, who has known Mr. Lazio since he was an assistant Suffolk County district attorney in the 1980's, said Long Island voters recognized that Mr. Lazio only did what was necessary to make an important point.</p>
        <p>''I watched the debate and I know Rick, and I don't feel it was done in an offensive way,'' she said. ''Rick is not an in-your-face person, he was just trying to engage Mrs. Clinton.''</p>
        <p>But an old Lazio friend and member of his 1976 graduating class from West Islip High School said she was taken aback by Mr. Lazio's debating style. ''On a personal level I like Rick very much,'' said Carolyn Zenk, now a Democratic member of the Southampton Town Board. ''But that particular approach was mean-spirited. It wasn't like him.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio is remembered in Suffolk County as notably non-confrontational. ''You never really knew where Rick was going to be on a vote,'' recalled Donald R. Blydenburgh of Smithtown, a State Supreme Court justice who was the presiding officer of the Legislature when Mr. Lazio was a member in the early 1990's.</p>
        <p>Others recalled that Mr. Lazio was invariably pleasant and willing to listen, but also noncommittal. ''He would always say, 'I'll think about it,' '' said Joseph Rizzo, a retired Republican county legislator who served with Mr. Lazio.</p>
        <p>But memories of Mr. Lazio the candidate were different. Edwin M. (Buzz) Schwenk, a former Suffolk Republican leader, recalled an encounter with Mr. Lazio during his underdog campaign in 1992 against Thomas J. Downey, a nine-term Democratic incumbent.</p>
        <p>''I saw him in his driveway, and he had this borrowed truck with a sign on the back that said 'Lazio for Congress' '' Mr. Schwenk recalled. ''I said, 'Rick, what do you think you're doing?' and he said 'I really don't know, but I think I have a chance to win this thing.' And the point that came across to me was that he had fire in the belly to move ahead.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio grew up in an unremarkable-looking Cape in West Islip, where his mother, Olive, still resides, and seemed in his South Shore youth to show little sign of banked fire. In high school he did well academically but not well enough to be an honor society member. He was not an athlete or a student leader. His list of activities in the 1976 West Islip High School yearbook is short.</p>
        <p>What set Mr. Lazio apart was an early immersion in the Republican political life of Suffolk County, where working families like his own that might have been urban Democrats a generation earlier pass through a political looking glass upon moving to the suburbs and become Republicans. His father, Tony, who owned a local auto parts store, was also an employee of the county Republican Party in charge of arrangements for political events before suffering a stroke.</p>
        <p>After Mr. Lazio graduated from Vassar College and obtained a law degree from American University, he returned to West Islip to take a job in 1983 as an assistant county district attorney.</p>
        <p>The district attorney, Patrick Henry, who hired Mr. Lazio, said in an interview that seeing Mr. Lazio at party events pushing his stricken father in a wheelchair had impressed him. ''It was obvious to me and to other casual observers that Rick was a very devoted son,'' said Mr. Henry, who is now a state Supreme Court justice.</p>
        <p>Mr. Henry eventually promoted Mr. Lazio, who handled misdemeanor and later felony cases, to executive assistant, a role in which Mr. Lazio dealt with the press and helped implement office policies.</p>
        <p>Briefly in private practice in Babylon after leaving the district attorney's office in 1988, Mr. Lazio got the Republican nomination to run for a seat on the Suffolk County Legislature in 1989 when a Republican incumbent, Patrick Mahoney, decided to run for county sheriff.</p>
        <p>Even before his first two-year term was over, Mr. Lazio was plucked by Republicans to run against Mr. Downey.</p>
        <p>As a congressman, Mr. Lazio gained a reputation as a moderate Republican with expertise in housing. More recently, he was a sponsor of a bill that increased federal funding for a cleanup of Long Island Sound.</p>
        <p>But unlike Mr. D'Amato, the Island Park resident who was supervisor of the Town of Hempstead and the most powerful member of the old Nassau County Board of Supervisors before becoming a Senator, Mr. Lazio has played a far more limited role in Suffolk County government and politics. Mr. D'Amato was more of a kingmaker (of Governor Pataki, for one); Mr. Lazio remains more of a protege (of Governor Pataki).</p>
        <p>Nor is Mr. Lazio known for his ideological fervor. Paul Sabatino, the longtime counsel to the Suffolk County Legislature who recalled Mr. Lazio as a county legislator, said he expected that as a senator Mr. Lazio would be more like Mr. D'Amato, called Senator Pothole for his attention to local minutiae, than the intellectual Mr. Moynihan, who is retiring.</p>
        <p>Mr. D'Amato did not answer calls to his office in Manhattan seeking his views on what kind of senator Mr. Lazio would make. But when asked about the prospects for a Senator Pothole II, the candidate himself had an answer.</p>
        <p>''I would keep doing what I've been doing as a member of Congress, just do more of it,'' Mr. Lazio said. ''Deliver for Long Island. Help the schools, help the businesses, get people to work together.''</p>
