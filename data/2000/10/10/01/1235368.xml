        <p>Indonesia's democratically elected government suffered a setback in its attempt to restore credibility to the rule of law when its corruption case against former President Suharto was dismissed. Doctors said three strokes had left Mr. Suharto unfit to stand trial. The decision touched off street clashes; at least one person was killed. The government of Abdurrahman Wahid had charged Mr. Suharto with embezzling $590 million during his 32-year rule; he and his family are believed to have stolen billions. Mr. Suharto's youngest son has been sentenced to 18 months for corruption.</p>
