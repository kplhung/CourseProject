        <p>Princeton's Taylor Northrop kicked a 24-yard field goal in overtime to cap a stirring comeback and a 27-24 victory over host Columbia yesterday in the Ivy League opener for both teams.</p>
        <p>Princeton, which had trailed by 10 points with 2 minutes 32 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter, earned its first victory under the Tigers' new head coach, Roger Hughes.</p>
        <p>''There is no superlative for how big a win this is for us,'' Hughes said. ''This is a huge win, especially considering how we did it.''</p>
        <p>For the second consecutive week, Columbia yielded a touchdown with less than a minute to go; last week's defensive lapse against Bucknell cost the Lions the game. Yesterday Kyle Brandt's 7-yard plunge with 47 seconds left tied the score at 24-24.</p>
        <p>Columbia (1-2) had led, 24-14, but after a 37-yard field goal by Northrop, the Tigers' Taylor Smith recovered the ensuing onside kick. Princeton (1-2) then went 51 yards in five plays, capped by Brandt's game-tying run.</p>
        <p>The Lions received the ball first in overtime, but Dany Berghoff missed a 27-yard field-goal attempt.</p>
        <p>''We are very disappointed in the way we finished,'' Columbia Coach Roy Tellier said. ''We've dropped two in a row like this. We have to find a way to win games like this.''</p>
        <p>The Lions dominated the first half, outgaining the Tigers, 340 yards to 45. But Princeton's Andy Bryant returned the opening kickoff of the second half to the Columbia 49, and quarterback Tommy Crenshaw then found Patrick Schottel down the left sideline to narrow the gap to 17-14.</p>
        <p>''We only had 15 offensive plays in the first half, and that's unacceptable,'' Hughes said. ''In the second half we executed a lot better and we started to play a lot better.''</p>
        <p>Princeton outgained Columbia in the second half, 293 yards to 135.</p>
        <p>Columbia's Jeff McCall struck for his second touchdown pass with just under five minutes to go in the third quarter. After another Princeton fumble, McCall found Jarel Cockburn on a 37-yard touchdown pass.  The score re-established the Lions' 10-point advantage, at 24-14, with just under five minutes remaining in the third quarter.</p>
        <p>Columbia kicked off the scoring late in the first quarter. Johnathan Reese rumbled in from 5 yards, capping a 76-yard march.</p>
        <p>But early in the second quarter, a McCall pass was tipped and intercepted by Kevin Kongslie. He sprinted 48 yards to the end zone, knotting the score at 7-7.</p>
        <p>The Lions responded two drives later. Columbia drove 71 yards in 14 plays to the Princeton 3, but settled for Berghoff's 21-yard field goal. After a Princeton fumble gave Columbia the ball at the Tigers' 47, McCall hit Cockburn on an 11-yard fade pattern with 17 seconds left for a 17-7 lead.</p>
