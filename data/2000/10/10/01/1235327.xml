        <p>The program at Belmont Park said it simply: ''Fictitious. Chestnut filly, 4 years old, owned by Her Majesty the Queen.''</p>
        <p>But despite her royal connections and her record of winning three times in five starts since arriving from Britain late last year, Fictitious could manage only a fourth-place finish yesterday while another filly from Britain, Gino's Spirits, was winning the $111,200 Noble Damsel Handicap. La Ville Rouge placed second, and Solar Bound was third.</p>
        <p>For Gino's Spirits, this was her third success in four starts this year, and she scored it by two-and-three-quarters lengths over an international field that included fillies and mares from Ireland, Chile and South Africa as well as Britain and America.</p>
        <p>The favored entry of Storm Dream and La Ville Rouge, trained by Phil Johnson, produced a reverse result: La Ville Rouge finished second and Ireland's Storm Dream, the stronger half of the entry, tired to seventh place in the field of eight.</p>
        <p>''Storm Dream looks sound,'' Johnson said, somewhat puzzled, ''and it didn't look like she bled.''</p>
        <p>Jean-Luc Samyn, the jockey on Storm Dream, said: ''She just wasn't herself. I don't know what happened.''</p>
        <p>Gino's Spirits, trained by Elliott Walden, ran the mile in 1:363/5  under Edgar Prado, paid $16.40 for a $2 bet to win and earned $66,720. She is a 4-year-old granddaughter of both Danzig and Cure the Blues, and she won 2 of her 12 starts in England last year before heading across the Atlantic.</p>
        <p>''The plan was just to sit off the speed and get a good spot on the inside,'' said Prado, who was riding her for the first time. ''I knew they were flying up front, and my filly relaxed perfectly. Once the hole opened, she just took off.''</p>
        <p>In the $75,000 Ashley T. Cole Handicap for horses foaled in New York State, it proved a day of redemption for Currency Arbitrage. The 7-year-old chestnut had lost 11 races in a row over the last two years and, accordingly, was listed at odds of 16-1, but he held on to win this one by a length over Pebo's Guy, who nosed out Doctor Cat for second place.</p>
        <p>Currency Arbitrage, owned by the Anstu Stable and Earle Mack and trained by Gary Sciacca, ran the mile and an eighth in 1:504/5  under John Velazquez and returned $34.20 for a $2 bet to win.</p>
        <p>FINISH LINES</p>
        <p>Tiznow, the 3-year-old star from the West Coast, won the $500,000 Super Derby in record time yesterday at Louisiana Downs when he ran away from Commendable, winner of the Belmont Stakes. The race marked the sixth straight time that Tiznow had run either first or second, and he led almost all the way to win this time in 1:594/5 , which was two-fifths of a second faster than the track record set by Gate Dancer in 1984.</p>
        <p>The colt, trained by JAY ROBBINS with CHRIS McCARRON riding, ran second last month in the Pacific Classic. He went off as the even-money favorite in the field of six in the Louisiana Derby, and dueled with Commendable until they turned for home, when he drew clear.</p>
