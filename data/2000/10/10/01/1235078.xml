        <p>WHILE others in the state are debating whether to allow hunting of some of the 1,000 or so black bears that live in northern and western New Jersey, Tracy Nash Leaver is rescuing black bears, mostly injured or abandoned cubs, and caring for them while they recuperate or grow up.</p>

        <p>WHILE others in the state are debating whether to allow hunting of some of the 1,000 or so black bears that live in northern and western New Jersey, Tracy Nash Leaver is rescuing black bears, mostly injured or abandoned cubs, and caring for them while they recuperate or grow up.</p>
        <p>The goal is to return the animals to the wild, where Mrs. Leaver hopes they will live out their days with no further contact with human beings.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Leaver, along with more than 40 volunteers, operates the Woodlands Wildlife Refuge in Bethlehem Township in northern Hunterdon County, the only refuge in the state that is permitted to take in black bears.</p>
        <p>Bears are the biggest animals the refuge takes in, and they eat the most, consuming 20 pounds of puppy food and 15 to 20 pounds of fruit and vegetables a day when they are cubs.</p>
        <p>The refuge also provides a temporary home to raccoons, porcupines, fox, reptiles, skunks, squirrels, coyotes, deer and even one bobcat. (Birds are not accepted, as they require separate federal permits.)</p>
        <p>''The bobcat had been hit by a car and had no more than a day to live when he was brought to us,'' Mrs. Leaver said. ''Sir Bob was a truly wild-spirited New Jersey animal. It was an honor to work with him.''</p>
        <p>The staff is wary of getting too attached to the animals or having them get too used to human contact.</p>
        <p>''There was never a danger of Sir Bob getting used to people,'' she said. ''But I have to warn the staff to enjoy the nurturing when the animals are infants. That is when they have to have hands-on care. Later, you want the animals to have as little contact as possible with people so they can be returned to the wild. It is a bittersweet process.''</p>
        <p>The Woodlands Wildlife Refuge is on an acre and a half in a remote location where most of the animals are housed out of sight from the staff and from neighbors or passers-by.</p>
        <p>The refuge was started when Mrs. Leaver found two orphaned raccoons, and it grew from there.</p>
        <p>''I was always dragging home hurt animals when I was a kid,'' Mrs. Leaver said. ''This grew out of it. It was just the right thing to do.</p>
        <p>''We have so much to learn from animals, and they are always going to be there. We need a better understanding of the black bears and other animals,'' she said.</p>
        <p>''If I could tell people one thing it would be to please learn about the animals in New Jersey. Go to the library, take your kids and learn about local wildlife. It is absolutely incredible that New Jersey still has the diverse habitat to support these animals and they should be respected.''</p>
        <p>The refuge, which operates on donations, can be reached at Post Office Box 5046, Clinton, N.J. 08809. Its Web site is www.woodlandswildlife.org.</p>
