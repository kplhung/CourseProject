        <p>WHEN the Port Washington Board of Education met last month, one of the issues on its agenda was the review of two books proposed for use in the high school English curriculum. While the board enthusiastically approved ''Clear Light of Day'' by Anita Desai for an advanced-placement English course, several members raised concerns about the second book, ''In the Time of the Butterflies'' by Julia Alvarez, proposed for a 10th grade literature and composition class.</p>
        <p>The novel, which is based on fact, is about four sisters living in the Dominican Republic when Rafael Trujillo was dictator there. The sisters sacrifice safe and comfortable lives to fight for freedom. Their stories span several decades, from adolescent secret crushes to gun running and prison torture. The book was published by Penguin in 1994.</p>
        <p>Reviews have rated the book as an outstanding choice for high school students, and it is required reading in a number of high schools. The American Library Association named it as a ''notable book,'' and it was a 1995 National Book Critics Circle Award nominee. But the sticking point for the Port Washington board was a crude diagram of a homemade bomb that appears on one page.</p>
        <p>The book had already been approved by the English department and the administration of the village's sole high school, Paul D. Schreiber High. It was then presented to the seven-member school board for final approval, and the board voted 4 to 3 to ask the school to re-evaluate the book. Richard Sussman, the board's president, said last week that he thought the board would vote on the matter again at its meeting Tuesday.</p>
        <p>''This is not an issue of censorship, but one of safety,'' Mr. Sussman said. ''Especially in today's climate, we have problems with a book that gives out instructions on how to build a bomb. I understand that it is a good book, but I don't think it's appropriate that we should be condoning a book that gives out these instructions so easily. We are not banning the book, but we're just not approving it for use in the curriculum.''</p>
        <p>Another board member, John Zimmerman, went a step further. ''Circulating a book to students about making a bomb would be the wrong thing to do,'' he said. He added that the board had initially voted to ban the book but had reconsidered. ''To back down from the original decision would be irresponsible of us,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In response to the board's action, Dr. Albert Inserra, the school superintendent, said: ''We have to question whether the diagram is something that as part of a book we should be purchasing and handing out to kids. While I am more concerned about material of this nature than I would have been two years ago, I also understand that the drawing is not really relevant to the story. It has come up for discussion that maybe the publisher would be willing to reprint the book without the diagram. We will now take another look at this book, but that doesn't mean that we won't recommend it again.''</p>
        <p>The board's vote has drawn reactions from educators and parents in Port Washington and beyond, some applauding the board's decision and others condemning it.</p>
        <p>''I think the board's action was totally justified,'' said one Port Washington woman, the mother of a high school student, who asked that her name not be used because she thought her opinion would be an unpopular one. ''We live in a very crazy time, and the suggestion of violence could trigger an irrational act by an unbalanced individual. There are so many examples of fine literature that can be used in the curriculum to teach our students about another time and another culture. Why not just substitute this book with another novel that doesn't have a drawing of a homemade bomb?''</p>
        <p>Jan Scherr of Syosset, the mother of two sons, age 19 and 16, disagreed. ''I'm disturbed by the picture, especially because of the violent world we live in, but I'd hate to see good literature sacrificed because of one picture,'' she said. ''I don't think that any kid would be influenced enough by a drawing to make a bomb. A disturbed person who wants to make a bomb would somehow find out how to do it.''</p>
        <p>Mary Anne Cariello, the president of the Port Washington Teachers Association, said that the drawing of the bomb was not a key element in the novel. ''As a matter of fact, the key element on the pages before and after the drawing is the young woman's love interest, and I can't imagine how this diagram would inspire anyone to build a bomb,'' she said. ''People have to distinguish between kids being able to go on the Internet and find such information, and books being taught in a classroom where the teacher is mediating the ideas from the book in a controlled setting. I hope that the school board will think about this further and decide to approve the book.''</p>
        <p>When the issue in Port Washington came to the attention of Barbara Bernstein, the executive director of the Nassau County chapter of the New York Civil Liberties Union, she said: ''This is absolutely part of the post-Columbine hysteria and is most definitely an act of self-censorship. If you are going to screen every book for any depiction of violence as a provocative element, you'd have to review every book in the school library. Our libraries are full of books that have violent themes or deal with violence.</p>
        <p>''If every depiction of violence is in some way considered a provocative act that will increase juvenile violence, we won't have any art or literature left.''</p>
        <p>Donald Parker, a coordinator of the Long Island Coalition Against Censorship, said that it would also be an act of self-censorship if ''In the Time of the Butterflies'' was dropped from the required reading and was designated merely as supplemental reading. ''Even if the novel remains in the school, there may only be three copies available in the library, and this literature would not be accessible to the students and not discussed the classroom,'' he said. ''This would be a concession to panic and a disservice to the students and the community.''</p>
        <p>Last week, Ms. Bernstein and Mr. Parker sent a letter to the school board, urging its members to reconsider their decision.</p>
        <p>Across the Island, as word of the vote in Port Washington spread, other educators voiced their opinions.</p>
        <p>''I ride both sides of the fence,'' said Robert Pinckney, the interim superintendent of the Malverne School District. ''While I can initially understand the sensitivity and obligation of the school board to protect the children of Port Washington, I wonder if the members read the entire book or are just reacting to one page. I understand the litigious society that we live in, and if the book was approved and one student read it and built a bomb, there would be serious questions of accountability.</p>
        <p>''But on the other side, this is taking a piece of literature out of the hands of students that could teach them about the culture of another country and the struggle for freedom. And the bottom line is that students today can go on the Internet and find information on anything, including how to build a bomb.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Bruce Brodsky, the Suffolk County representative at the State School Boards Association, also expressed concerns about censorship for safety's sake. ''To censor something starts us down a slippery slope,'' he said. ''If you censor one book, for whatever reason, what would stop the board from censoring other books as well? It opens up Pandora's box and becomes an issue larger than one specific book.''</p>
        <p>''While the board has the legal right to make this decision in an attempt to protect the children from the potential of someone manufacturing a bomb, they will not be able to stop the information from being out there,'' said Dr. Brodsky, a member of the board of Eastern Suffolk Boces. ''In essence, they are trying to block the un-blockable, and banning this book would give them a false sense of security. The pluses of this book far outweigh the potential of one kid going off the deep end and doing something bad.''</p>
        <p>Whatever the outcome to the debate, it seems to have helped sales of ''In the Time of the Butterflies.'' Mr. Sussman, the school board president, said that since the board sent the book back for re-evaluation, it has sold out at local bookstores.</p>
