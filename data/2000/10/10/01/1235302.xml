        <p>Aleksandar Djurkovic's mother, 65, has been tending the flowers on her balcony for nearly two years. On Friday, when high school students marched past her window to a rally against the Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic, she ripped off the blooms and tossed them down, on to their heads.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Djurkovic, 36, says he is anxious, unable to sleep. ''My girlfriend wept with joy after she heard that Milosevic lost'' the presidential election on Sunday to the challenger, Vojislav Kostunica, he said. ''But I'm so nervous it will all collapse, that Milosevic, that Bolshevik, will succeed again at buying time and exhausting everyone.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kostunica and the 18-party coalition that backs him have vowed not to run in a runoff against Mr. Milosevic on Oct. 8, saying that Mr. Kostunica was elected outright last Sunday, winning more than 50 percent of the vote. He and the opposition say the government manipulated the vote with major fraud to push Mr. Kostunica below the 50 percent margin, although only just.</p>
        <p>A boycott of the second round is awkward here in Vojvodina, where voters must vote in a second round for a regional assembly that the opposition has a strong chance to control for the first time since Mr. Milosevic stripped this region of autonomy when he stripped it from Kosovo, too, in 1989. Leaders here need to tell people to vote Oct. 8, but not for the presidency, a mixed message that is likely to be misunderstood.</p>
        <p>Unwilling to accept the alleged vote fraud, Mr. Kostunica and the opposition have announced a series of rolling rallies and a general strike, to begin Monday, to convince Mr. Milosevic to concede a first-round defeat. It is a risky strategy, despite the confusion in the ruling coalition and divisions between its two partners, Mr. Milosevic's Socialists and the Yugoslav United Left headed by his wife, Mirjana Markovic.</p>
        <p>The opposition's call for people power seems particularly risky this weekend, when Serbs are tending to their own affairs. Mr. Milosevic used the occasion to make his first public appearance since the elections, at a graduation at a military academy. The rallies on Friday in Belgrade and here in Vojvodina were relatively small, feeding Mr. Djurkovic's anxiety.</p>
        <p>But Monday will be different, insists Miodrag Isakov, president of the Reformists of Vojvodina, one of the two main opposition parties here. ''It's D-Day,'' he said. ''We don't want to drag everything out as we've done in the past, with endless rallies. This time we want to finish it in a blitzkrieg and shut the country down.''</p>
        <p>The ruling Socialists are anxious, Mr. Isakov said. ''I think they're ready to give up, but they're testing us, to see if we're strong enough and if the people are ready to defend their votes and their rights. And I think the people are ready.''</p>
        <p>The people around Mr. Milosevic and Mrs. Markovic have had problems telling them that he lost the election, Mr. Isakov said. ''Now he needs a couple days and some real pressure to get used to it. Of course, he wants to buy himself some time, but his options are very narrow.''</p>
        <p>What matters to the opposition, Mr. Isakov said, is not that Mr. Milosevic leave the country. ''First we need his admission of our victory,'' he said. ''That will change everything.'' But to secure that, he added, Serbia simply must rise up on Monday.</p>
        <p>And if Mr. Milosevic is still sitting firm by Thursday, say? Mr. Isakov laughed nervously. ''It's like the joke during the NATO bombing,'' he said. '' 'Clinton: give up now or we're all going to die.' Well, if Milosevic doesn't kill himself by then, then we will all have to kill ourselves.''</p>
        <p>In Novi Sad, there is real resentment of NATO and its destruction of the only three bridges across the Danube River. The main bridge, the Varadinski Duga, is nearly repaired now, waiting only to be asphalted, and Mr. Milosevic is likely to come here to open it before Oct. 8.</p>
        <p>But Vladimir Horowic, a leading member of the Vojvodina Bar Association, says people are offended at the notion that somehow the ruling parties reconstructed the bridges, ''and not the people themselves.'' Mr. Horowic says the street protests on Monday will have to escalate quickly into a blockage of roads and railway traffic, and become a confrontation with Mr. Milosevic's police.</p>
        <p>''Really, it has to be over in a few days,'' he said. ''People must move from the squares to the president's palace and install a new one. They can't just sit around the squares and have a rock concert. It can be done with good humor, but the police and the army must see the people in front of them claiming their victory.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Horowic's wife, Sanja, also a lawyer, is skeptical. ''The opposition doesn't look strong enough in itself and eager to take anything other than Gandhi-like attitudes,'' she said.''And that's not enough.''</p>
        <p>Her husband laughed, then said: ''I'm absolutely optimistic and any pessimism I have I'm repressing. That's the way every person has to think. People now realize for the first time in this country that a majority of them think the same way.''</p>
        <p>Petar Petrovic, fired as chief news editor of TV Novi Sad, the state channel here, in 1990, has just been elected as a member of the Novi Sad city government, running on the opposition ticket. ''Monday must be D-Day and it must go fast,'' he said. ''Milosevic has been exhausting us for 10 years now, and we can't let him do it again.''</p>
        <p>The idea of a prolonged general strike is not enough, he said. ''The idea of telling people to stop work and drink coffee is funny here. That's all anyone has been doing for 10 years!'' But if the roads and cities are blocked, he said, Mr. Milosevic will get the right message.</p>
        <p>Mr. Milosevic, though, is less the problem than the system that depends on him, Mr. Petrovic said. ''Even if he wants to go, many of them don't want to let him. They need him to survive, especially JUL, his wife's party. Without the couple, they disappear. They're not a political party, but just a business association, a kind of mafia. Without him and her, they lose everything.''</p>
        <p>On Friday, 150 workers at TV Novi Sad signed a protest letter asking for the resignation of the chief editor, and six news editors were fired when they refused to run the state television news and promised equal time to the opposition. They came to the opposition rally last night here, but they were not allowed to speak.</p>
        <p>''We need to welcome those who leave the power now, to encourage others to shift, but not make too much of them, and offend those who were fired 10 years ago,'' Mr. Isakov said. ''It's a delicate balance -- until yesterday, these people were busy cheating us.''</p>
        <p>In America, he was told, the phrase is: the train's leaving the station. ''We welcome them on board,'' he said. ''But not in first class.''</p>
        <p>Slavko Caric, a businessman, says there is a revolution under way. ''But the crucial point is that the high-ranking people from the police and the army have to be convinced that the population has reached a critical mass, that all Serbia wants him out and wants him out fast. They know he's lost support, but they must see it.''</p>
