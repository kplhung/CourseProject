        <p>During the last several years, tenants at 181 East Houston Street said, they have endured cascading leaks, unstable stairs and rats. On Tuesday,  their problems got worse when police officers and city workers told them to leave the building immediately because it was in imminent danger of collapse. The distraught tenants wondered where they would spend the night.</p>
        <p>''We don't know what's happening to us,'' said a tenant, Daniel Lora, standing in a drizzle. ''Shame on the city for closing down our building without telling us where we're going.''</p>
        <p>The dilapidated tenement, between Orchard and Allen Streets, was taken over by the Department of Housing Preservation and Development in 1993 for nonpayment of property tax.</p>
        <p>In 1998, Con Edison shut off gas  because that bill had not been paid.  Most tenants were relocated by the city, but a dozen were allowed to stay. An agency spokeswoman, Carol Abrams, said the city made some repairs, including shoring up walls and strengthening staircases.</p>
        <p>But those repairs were apparently not sufficient. On Sept. 20, the same day that the city notified a new owner, Serge Hoyda, that the deed to the property was being sent to him, a Buildings Department inspector found the structure unsafe and an order to vacate was issued.</p>
        <p>Paul Wein, a Buildings Department spokesman, said tenants could return after the building was repaired. Ms. Abrams said Mr. Hoyda must make the repairs and house tenants until the work is done.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday afternoon, the local councilwoman, Kathryn Freed, said she had arrived at 181 East Houston Street while tenants were leaving. Ms. Freed got rooms for the tenants at the Pioneer Hotel on the Bowery, then called Mr. Hoyda, who agreed to pay for those rooms for 10 days. Mr. Hoyda said he did not know yet where tenants would stay after the 10 days or how long it would take to repair 181 East Houston Street.</p>
        <p>''The building is in very dangerous condition and could take up to a year to fix,'' he said. ''I'm very disappointed.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Freed said, ''H.P.D. should've been keeping the building up. They  weren't at the building when it was vacated and when they finally got there they didn't do a thing.''</p>
        <p>In response, Ms. Abrams said that the agency has been working to save the building as rent-stabilized housing and that, on Tuesday, city employees were at the site ''to offer assistance to the families.''</p>
        <p>On Thursday two tenants, Iris Sanchez and Emilio Namias, sat in a cafe near their building. Ms. Sanchez said that almost all her possessions were still inside, and that she worried about where she would live. Mr. Namias nodded.</p>
