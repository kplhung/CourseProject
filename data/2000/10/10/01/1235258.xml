        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The article ''Melting Pot With Baselines'' (Sept. 10) about the tennis courts in Lincoln Park in Jersey City, brought back many memories. In the 70's and 80's my husband and our three children played regularly. Players came from New York and from all over the country, and many of them knew one another. One regular player was Michael Chang, who at the time lived in Hoboken. Even then, waiting time for a court was often an hour or more.</p>
