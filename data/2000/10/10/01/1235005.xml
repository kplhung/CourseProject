        <p>Doretta Katzter letter on Judith Shulevitz's September 10 article holds women are over Hillary Rodham Clinton's decision to remain married and to continue to support her husband despite the way he treated women (S)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>It is not the perception of Hillary Clinton as a ''bluestocking'' that concerns women (The Way We Live Now: Judith Shulevitz, Sept. 10). In fact, one of the few things we may have in common with the first lady is the experience of being perceived as opinionated or aggressive, particularly those of us who have worked in male-dominated professions. What concerns us is her willingness to remain in a marriage in which she was demeaned. And what concerns us even more is the very public support she gave to her husband, support that was in large part responsible for his ability to remain in office. This undermined women by legitimizing the notion that men can be expected to cheat and that women should, nonetheless, stand by them.</p>
        <p>Moreover, Hillary Clinton set women in the workplace back 20 years by ignoring the way in which her husband treated women.</p>
        <p>In setting aside the most fundamental principles of her female contemporaries in order to protect her own political viability, Hillary Clinton has demonstrated that she cannot be trusted.</p>
