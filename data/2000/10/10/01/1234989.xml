        <p>A FEW years ago, a party to celebrate the start of a cable arts channel was held at the home of an art collector.

Yet any idea that this event signaled an easy coexistence of high art and mass media was short-lived.

        <p>As if that quaint, condescending comment were not bad enough -- making it seem that we had stepped into a time warp and landed in the 1950's -- the next was truly jaw-dropping.

        <p>A FEW years ago, a party to celebrate the start of a cable arts channel was held at the home of an art collector. The walls were lined with canvases by Jasper Johns and other contemporary painters whose work museums would be happy to have. Yet any idea that this event signaled an easy coexistence of high art and mass media was short-lived. When it was time for a toast, the hostess announced without a trace of irony or self-consciousness, ''We're not television people, my husband and I, but we figure it's not going away so we might as well support an arts channel.''</p>
        <p>As if that quaint, condescending comment were not bad enough -- making it seem that we had stepped into a time warp and landed in the 1950's -- the next was truly jaw-dropping. The chairman of the new channel said he agreed, and justified his decision to wallow in this declasse medium with a cliche: ''If you can't beat 'em, join 'em.''</p>
        <p>It's tempting to dismiss their remarks as the lingering snobbery of a dying breed, and to some extent that's just what they were. But their attitudes are also not as rare as you might think. They are extreme versions of the many wrongheaded approaches to television, which range from the dismissive on one side to the happy-go-lucky on the other. Images that pigeonhole the medium dominate any conversation about it; in these views, watching television is thought to be cultural anthropology, mindless escapism, emotional solace or a source of news, sports and occasionally art. But it is rarely embraced for doing all these things at once.</p>
        <p>Yet that variety, and the way the parts feed one another, is where television gets its immense social power. A fresher, more realistic way to understand and appreciate television is to stop regarding it through a narrow lens, and instead to embrace its breadth.</p>
        <p>Anyone who does not watch television cannot possibly understand mainstream American culture. That may be disappointing news to art collectors who wish we lived in Renaissance Italy, but there it is. We live in a vast, messy society, and television mirrors who we are in all our contradictions, complexities and uncertainties.</p>
        <p>Yet just as there used to be people who proclaimed that they watched only PBS, now there are people who claim to watch only HBO (for ''The Sopranos,'' of course, and not ''G-String Divas'' and other sex-filled late-night shows). There is even unmistakable self-loathing displayed on television itself. ''It's not TV, it's HBO,'' goes the idiotic slogan for the best channel there is. Of course it's TV, you ninnies, it's just good TV. But that is a concept the marketing people obviously think won't convince the upscale audience they mean to attract. The slogan TNT uses for its original films, ''The best movie studio on television,'' also attempts to borrow some luster from the movies, even though the increasingly homogenized film world no longer has much glory to share.</p>
        <p>A wider embrace of television, taking the medium on its own terms, is more revealing. Paradoxically, only such a broad view can cut to the heart of our multifaceted society, a place where pop culture and high art, reality and fiction, news and television's shaping of it, meet. Whether you're watching television as an escape at the end of a tiring day or seeking out sociological clues, those activities come to the same thing; the sociology seeps in by osmosis.</p>
        <p>WITHOUT going out of its way, television provides a constantly updated chart of what mainstream America thinks. The several Emmys recently awarded to the sitcom ''Will and Grace,'' including best comedy and best supporting actor for Sean Hayes as Will's friend Jack, offer a staid, traditional sign of approval. The show's popular success tells us that Americans will watch the story of a gay man and his female best friend. But ''Will and Grace'' also hints (here is its nasty secret) that it is safe to create a stereotypical flouncing gay man in Jack, who can reassure viewers that their prejudices are true. Even programmers' attempts to gauge what America is ready for indicate how the zeitgeist is perceived. In the end, the show's easy acceptance said one thing; if it had created an outcry, that would have meant something else.</p>
        <p>Among the most popular shows of recent years, there is no single ''reality'' reflected by television, but several provocative versions of how we think about real life. From ''The X-Files'' we learn that we live in a country in which people are deeply suspicious of the government's truthfulness; in the alien-hunting Mulder and the rational Scully we see the dramatized tension between belief and skepticism. From ''The West Wing'' we learn that viewers long for a president like the one Martin Sheen plays, more upright and heroic than we are ever likely to have in life, and that this longing can coexist with a tough-minded acknowledgment of political horse-trading. ''E.R.'' tells us to expect doctors who are dedicated and selfless, whatever messy personal problems are nagging at them that day; life tells us those expectations are insanely idealized.</p>
        <p>And while networks and critics crow about so-called ''quality'' shows (a favorite, meaningless buzzword), pedestrian and even outright bad shows are revealing, too. The ordinary ''Drew Carey Show'' offers a middle-American, overweight, unglamorous hero, a comfort to average people everywhere.</p>
        <p>Look even briefly at more respected art forms and you find creators who genuinely like television, are influenced by it and make it a significant part of their work. David Foster Wallace's story ''My Appearance,'' about an actress who is a guest on the old ''Late Night With David Letterman,'' is a sophisticated work about the ironic turn our society has taken, a failing marriage and the masks we wear every day. Dave Eggers's acclaimed novelistic memoir, ''A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius,'' is loaded with television references, including an account of his failed audition for MTV's ''Real World.'' These writers represent just two of the generations (those in their 30's and their 20's) who grew up with television. The pioneering video art of the older Nam June Paik began when the VCR was an alien concept. Such artists embrace television as an important, imperfect part of American culture, without looking down on it or losing their critical judgment.</p>
        <p>It is perceptive of them to incorporate the medium in their work, because even as the explosion of channels creates a more fragmented television universe, what we know and how we know it is shaped more than ever by television. Political campaigns are no longer simply staged with the evening news in mind; they are made-for-Oprah or made-for-Larry King events.</p>
        <p>Television now creates cultural moments as much as it reflects them. The prepackaged Olympics, which end today, and the annual ritual of the Academy Awards transcend what the athletic contests or the Hollywood awards would be if the cameras stayed away. The details of the O. J. Simpson trial, the JonBenet Ramsey murder, the Monica Lewinsky scandal and the Elian Gonzalez custody fight have invaded the public conversation in a way that would never have happened without cable news channels. (Though the Internet is rapidly gaining ground, it has not yet become pervasive enough to claim that kind of grip.)</p>
        <p>Even our language has been shaped by television. Catch phrases enter and leave the language, understood even by people who don't watch the shows that spawned them. They are marks of what has captured the public imagination: the simplistic ''final answer'' from the cheery ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire''; the overwrought fatalism of ''the tribe has spoken'' from the cutthroat ''Survivor''; the ''yada, yada, yada'' tribute to the joys and neuroses provoked by life's ordinary details in ''Seinfeld.''</p>
        <p>The fact that television is important doesn't mean that everything it does is good, of course. Most of it is dreadful, but even at its worst it can be dreadful in a fascinating way. A vapid mini-series like ''The Sixties,'' with its laughably hollow image of a volatile decade, demonstrates how television can reduce history to a meaningless montage of film clips, music and colorful costumes, defanging a whole era to make it palatable for television and buyers of the soundtrack CD. Yet, by giving us what the 60's was not, by creating a caricature historians can rail against, ''The Sixties'' perversely contributes something to the conversation. That is not the ideal contribution, but it matters.</p>
        <p>The biggest problem with junk television (apart from boredom) is that its critics can use it to demonize the whole medium. Movies, especially, love to make television the easy scapegoat, in films like ''The Truman Show,'' which suggests people cannot escape the medium's evil control. But as the current political debate about marketing violent entertainment to children illustrates, condemning an entire industry is more a political convenience than an idea rooted in the vast range of what television presents every day.</p>
        <p>The experience of watching television is more complex than either the politicians or the Hollywood executives, both full of narrow self-interest, admit. Blinkered opinions that damn television for its Jerry Springer excesses or foolishly overpraise it for half-witted sitcoms are both off base.</p>
        <p>And television's highest achievements do not define it any better than its lowest. ''The Sopranos,'' which has the depth of character of genuine art, is like a gift, rare in any medium. It is as distant from most junk on television as a Kurosawa film is from a Hollywood action movie or a Toni Morrison novel from a Danielle Steel romance. Yet no one dismisses film and novels in general just because popcorn movies or beach books outweigh true art. No one would dream of saying, in a regal tone, ''We're not book people, my husband and I.''</p>
        <p>Television people are everywhere, watching everything, realizing (as only people with a solid grasp of American culture can) that the highbrow-lowbrow divisions so often imposed on television are nonsensical. It's not HBO; it's TV.</p>
