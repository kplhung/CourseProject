        <p>TRANS AM: 'RED LINE'  Thrill Jockey, CD, Thrill 087.</p>
        <p>Ever careful not to take themselves too seriously, today's experimental rock groups often overcompensate with layers of self-protective irony. Trans Am, a three-piece group from Washington, has developed two contrasting musical personas, each played out tongue in cheek. In one guise, the group is a tense, precise power trio, often playfully quoting from classic rock. The rest of the time, it trades electric guitars for outdated synthesizers and parodies progressive electronic acts of the 70's and 80's like Kraftwerk and Gary Numan. Clever as it may be, the split-personality ruse has limited the group's musical intelligence.</p>

        <p>TRANS AM: 'RED LINE'  Thrill Jockey, CD, Thrill 087.</p>
        <p>Ever careful not to take themselves too seriously, today's experimental rock groups often overcompensate with layers of self-protective irony. Trans Am, a three-piece group from Washington, has developed two contrasting musical personas, each played out tongue in cheek. In one guise, the group is a tense, precise power trio, often playfully quoting from classic rock. The rest of the time, it trades electric guitars for outdated synthesizers and parodies progressive electronic acts of the 70's and 80's like Kraftwerk and Gary Numan. Clever as it may be, the split-personality ruse has limited the group's musical intelligence.</p>
        <p>But with ''Red Line,'' its fifth album, Trans Am has loosened up and aimed its considerable talents in a thousand directions. The group -- Phil Manley and Nathan Means on guitars and keyboards and Sebastian Thomson on drums -- has finally embraced free-form rock with a beat rather than derivative kitsch. In the process, it has produced the first truly experimental album of its career. Despite a few slips back into ironic role-playing, the music on ''Red Line'' sounds fresh, and the band has never sounded so confident. (It will perform at the Bowery Ballroom in Manhattan tomorrow.)</p>
        <p>The album is stylistically diffuse. Parts of it are hard-rocking variations on complex instrumental patterns; others contain menacing electronica, folksy acoustic guitar, frenetic bongo drumming and musique concrete, sometimes juggled together in the same track. The band often begins a song in one place and, quickly bored, changes directions several times. ''Village in Bubbles,'' among the first of the album's 21 tracks, opens with a typical Trans Am groove, an agitated bass-and-drum funk pattern played on a shotgun downbeat, but the song abruptly mellows with the help of a murky, underwater echo effect. ''The Dark Gift,'' the album's magnum opus, crams at least half a dozen distinct ideas into nine minutes of meandering.</p>
        <p>Such digressions make ''Red Line'' a tantalizing sketchbook of musical doodling and sonic landscapes. The concepts are linked only by the band members' curiosity. Without any personas to hide behind or jokey schemes to bog it down, the band seems freed to follow its ideas as far as they will go.</p>
