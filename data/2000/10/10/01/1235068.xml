        <p>Fly Fishing</p>
        <p>A ''Compleat Fly-Fishing Fair'' is to be held on Saturday in Old Saybrook, presenting comprehensive information about the sport from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Experts will be on hand with lectures and demonstrations and members of fly-fishing clubs will take aspiring young fly-fisherfolk under their wings for instruction.</p>
        <p>One of the more intriguing lectures is called ''Fly-Fishing from a Kayak,'' to be delivered by Chris Lento and Brian Conklin. ''Fly-Fishing for Weakfish,'' ''Fly-Rodding the Coast'' and ''Fly-Fishing the Farmington'' will be discussed respectively by Capt. Jim White, Ed Mitchell, and Don Butler and Bob Kneeland.</p>
        <p>In addition to fly-fishing, other activities in the great outdoors will be covered by talks and demonstrations on packing a backpack properly, using an outdoor camp stove, building a rope bridge, and in a simulation of perpendicular terrain -- negotiating an outdoor climbing wall.</p>
        <p>Authors will be signing books, and a fully loaded river-tripping canoe will be on display, along with salt-water fly-fishing boats and all manner of equipment. The event takes place at the North Cove Outfitters, 75 Main Street. Call (860) 388-6585 for more information or check out www.northcove.com.</p>
