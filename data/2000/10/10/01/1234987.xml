        <p>DICK WOLF eschews the expensive sports clothes and open-necked shirts that are de rigueur for rival television kings like Steven Bochco and David E. Kelley. Instead, with his slicked-back hair, cuff-linked off-white shirt, expensive tie and sleek suit, Mr. Wolf resembles a very successful businessman.</p>
        <p>Which he is.</p>
        <p>The busiest writer-producer on television, the 53-year-old Mr. Wolf will have four shows on the air this fall -- including the longest-running dramatic series on television, NBC's ''Law and Order.'' A fifth Wolf show is planned for early next year.</p>
        <p>''What I love about television is you write it and six, seven weeks later you're watching it,'' said Mr. Wolf, seated in the commissary of Universal Studios. ''And nobody at any movie studio is making the kind of socially aware or socially provocative feature films that you see almost every night on television. Nobody. It's a genre that's disappeared. Except on television.''</p>
        <p>And especially on Mr. Wolf's shows.</p>
        <p>His most anticipated new show is NBC's ''Deadline'' (Mondays, 9-10 p.m.), which starts tomorrow. In this drama series, Oliver Platt plays a crusading columnist for a New York tabloid newspaper who recruits graduate students to help uncover what the city's power brokers often want to keep buried. The columnist, according to Mr. Platt, is a kind of composite of Jimmy Breslin, Mike McAlary, Murray Kempton and Mike Royko (although it's unlikely that these columnists used graduate students to help them).</p>
        <p>Mr. Platt, a skilled 40-year-old character actor (''Bulworth,''  ''Dr. Dolittle''), had been sought for years by television producers. He even turned down the Dylan McDermott role on ''The Practice.'' But last year Mr. Platt told a friend, David Kissinger, president of programming at Studios USA Television, which is Mr. Wolf's producing partner, that he was weary of traveling to movie sets and missed his wife and three children in New York. Was there a New York-based television series available?</p>
        <p>Mr. Kissinger told Mr. Wolf, who had been thinking of a newspaper series. The role of the columnist was quickly designed for Mr. Platt. The cast of ''Deadline'' also includes Tom Conti as the media mogul who owns the tabloid and Bebe Neuwirth as an editor, as well as Hope Davis and Lili Taylor.</p>
        <p>''I've always wanted to do a newspaper show,'' Mr. Wolf said. ''I liked 'Lou Grant.' I loved 'Front Page.' And what I wanted to do was deal with a columnist, not a reporter. The knock on newspaper shows is that a reporter reports. He's a passive protagonist. He has to wait for things to happen. A columnist doesn't. A columnist is not limited by objectivity. A columnist can smell something and say, 'This is what I want to do.' A columnist can drive the action, which is the essence of drama.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Platt said his only concern in taking the job was signing a commitment for five years. ''It's scary,'' he said. ''But then again you have the opportunity to collaborate with a guy like Dick Wolf, to build a character from the ground up and establish a world and spin it out. The oversimplified personal question I had was, Do I want consistently good writing and to sleep in my own bed and be with my family and have a steady gig, or do I want wildly erratic writing and to sleep in hotels and come home exhausted from a film set? Was there any doubt?''</p>
        <p>The series starts the same night another new Wolf show, ''Arrest and Trial,'' is to make its debut on Channel 9 in New York. This nationally syndicated show, to be seen five days a week on 170 stations, blends reality with dramatic re-creations as it follows highly charged and violent criminal cases from the police investigation to the verdict. Interviews with law enforcement officers are interspersed with scenes enacted by actors portraying victims and killers. Brian Dennehy, who won a Tony Award last year as best actor for his performance in ''Death of a Salesman,'' serves as the host.</p>
        <p>''What's really fascinating for me is using real cops and real prosecutors as well as file footage and some re-creations,'' said Mr. Wolf, who is producing the show with Robert Port, president of Maury Povich's Mo Po Entertainment. In contrast to successful reality shows like ''Cops,'' the new series explores a crime by re-enacting it through the use of often grainy film and tape that seeks to blur the line between reality and fiction.</p>
        <p>''I'm a crime junkie,'' Mr. Wolf said. ''Cops and prosecutors are kind of unsung heroes. And this is a chance of getting real people on camera and seeing who they are.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Wolf has been obsessed with cops and prosecutors for 25 years. He grew up relatively affluent in Manhattan, the son of an advertising executive. He attended Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass., and the University of Pennsylvania, where he majored in English. After graduation he worked in advertising for eight years. ''I did landmark advertising campaigns -- 'Can't beat Crest for fighting cavities!' Remember that?''</p>
        <p>By the time he reached 30, Mr. Wolf wanted to quit advertising and write screenplays. In 1977, at the height of the skateboard craze, he sold his first script to Universal: ''Skateboard,'' which was made into a movie starring Leif Garrett. ''A memorable movie,'' Mr. Wolf said dryly. But he had a talent for writing commercial films, and three were made: ''No Man's Land'' (1987), ''Masquerade'' (1988) and ''School Ties'' (1992), about anti-Semitism at a fancy prep school. None of the films were especially successful (although ''School Ties'' is notable for featuring a cast of young actors who later went on to become stars, among them Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, Chris O'Donnell and Brendan Fraser).</p>
        <p>''It took 11 years to get made and then made 11 cents,'' Mr. Wolf said of ''School Ties.'' He added: ''I deserted the movie business because of frustration. You can really get old waiting for pictures to get made.''</p>
        <p>By the early 1980's, Mr. Wolf and his family had moved to Los Angeles from New York. While writing film scripts, he also began working on such television shows as ''Hill Street Blues'' and ''Miami Vice.'' In the meantime, he developed ''Law and Order'' for Fox, but it was rejected by Barry Diller, who then ran the company. (Ironically, Mr. Diller has now taken over Studios USA, which is producing the show.) CBS also rejected it. Brandon Tartikoff, then the entertainment chief at NBC, reluctantly agreed to take ''Law and Order'' on the condition that Mr. Wolf also develop and work on a series called ''Nasty Boys,'' about a Las Vegas police unit. To the surprise of NBC, ''Nasty Boys'' died quickly. ''Law and Order,'' after a slow start, began building an audience.</p>
        <p>Cast turnover has marked the show -- partly because Mr. Wolf wants to keep altering the characters to keep the series fresh, and partly because some actors, like Benjamin Bratt, have wanted to move on to film careers. In the new season, Steven Hill, who has long played the grumpy district attorney, Adam Schiff, is being replaced by Dianne Wiest.</p>
        <p>The actors on Mr. Wolf's shows speak of him with a bit of awe. ''I get along with him fine, but I don't think he's an easygoing guy,'' said Jerry Orbach, whose career before ''Law and Order'' was, like that of most of the actors on that show, on the New York stage. ''He's kind of a type A personality, on the phone a lot.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Orbach added: ''I think Dick's special talent is that he crosses a lot of lines and always surprises you. Some guys are good with the police, some guys are good with the legal stuff, some have a sense of humor, some are serious. Dick seems to have a little bit of everything, and that's unusual.''</p>
        <p>Like ''Law and Order'' and its spinoff, ''Law and Order: Special Victims Unit'' (Fridays, 10-11 p.m.), which is in its second year, ''Deadline'' is set and filmed in New York. It is also being written in New York; the writing staff for the ''Law and Order'' shows, under Mr. Wolf, is based in Los Angeles at Universal Studios, whose television division was sold to Studios USA.</p>
        <p>A fifth Wolf show, another spinoff of ''Law and Order,'' is also in the works for NBC. Filming will probably start in December, with 13 episodes ready by the early summer, before the start of threatened actor and writer strikes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wolf's skills -- and his ambition -- are a bit grandiose, almost like those of an old-time movie mogul. He is constantly on the run between his home near Santa Barbara, where he lives with his wife and three children, and the studio in Universal City, as well as New York.</p>
        <p>''He's always in evidence, whether he's in person or not,'' said Mr. Platt. ''He's very hands-on. He's very collaborative. And he picks extraordinarily talented people to run his shows.''</p>
        <p>To oversee ''Law and Order'' this season, for example, Mr. Wolf has hired the 78-year-old Arthur Penn, the director of such celebrated films as ''Bonnie and Clyde'' and ''The Miracle Worker,'' to serve as the new executive producer. He replaces Ed Sherin, who had been on the job for seven years and wanted to take a break.</p>
        <p>The appointment of Mr. Penn is a modest breakthrough for older people on television, an industry where age discrimination is notorious and writers, producers and directors over 50 or even 40 try to hide how old they are. Mr. Wolf is also using the 69-year-old Ted Kotcheff, director of ''North Dallas 40,'' as executive producer of ''Law and Order: Special Victims Unit.''</p>
        <p>''It's ridiculous,'' Mr. Wolf said. ''People are dropping off credits on their resumes. They don't list 'M*A*S*H' anymore because it shows that they're older.''</p>
        <p>The fact that Mr. Wolf is blunt, energetic, a bit irascible and independent-minded -- as well as highly successful -- seems to dazzle and almost intimidate network executives. ''Dick's a bit of a character; he's bigger than life,'' said Garth Ancier, president of NBC Entertainment. ''He runs his organization like a well-oiled machine. He has a very strong organization and has very, very good taste in casting. He's shrewd. He gets you involved. He'll call and say: 'I have a great idea. Oliver Platt. I believe in him.' And before you know it you're having breakfast with Oliver Platt. And once you get Oliver Platt, you get Tom Conti and Bebe Neuwirth.</p>
        <p>''You get a call from Dick saying, 'I want to bring in a new D.A. on ''Law and Order,'' and I want to get Dianne Wiest.' How can I complain about that?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kissinger, the Studios USA Television executive, said: ''Happily for us, he's married his talent with an insatiable ambition. Dick's just not content to have one show on the air. He views himself as building a company. His ambition is to try to duplicate the days of MTM, which in some ways he's doing.'' (MTM, run by Grant Tinker and Mary Tyler Moore, was a top television producer in the 1970's).</p>
        <p>Certainly ''Law and Order,'' entering its 11th season, has stamped Mr. Wolf's career. Now that the show is the longest-running drama series on network television, he has hopes of seeing it match ''Gunsmoke,'' which ran for 20 years, as the longest-running prime-time drama series ever.</p>
        <p>''I want to beat 'Gunsmoke,' '' he said. ''We're renewed until 2005. It'll be a shame if we don't go for the record.''</p>
        <p>By contrast to the characters on ABC's flashier ''N.Y.P.D. Blue,'' officers and prosecutors on ''Law and Order'' are notable for their absence of histrionics. Perhaps that is why ''Law and Order,'' although successful, has won only one Emmy as best drama series, in 1997, and why longtime cast members like Mr. Orbach and Sam Waterston have never won.</p>
        <p>MR. WOLF is plainly annoyed. ''We've been wildly underappreciated by the Emmys and the Writers Guild,'' he said. ''It's not flashy. It's not showy. It's not that type of writing. Jerry Orbach keeps saying, 'Can't you guys put someone dying in my arms so I can cry and take a long time and maybe win an award?' ''</p>
        <p>Despite such complaints, Mr. Wolf says he's doing exactly what he wants to do, although the breakneck speed of television can leave him bewildered and frustrated. ''I just try to hire extremely obsessive people,'' he said. ''Otherwise it's so easy to get to Episode 14, with eight to go. And you say, 'Well, it's good enough.' And once you say 'it's good enough,' then it's bad, really bad.</p>
        <p>''It's like running a marathon. To churn out really A-level work, it takes really obsessive-compulsive people.'' He laughed. ''Like me.''</p>
