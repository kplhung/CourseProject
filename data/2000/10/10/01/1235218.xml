        <p>THE Jewish New Year, which began on Friday evening, serves as an annual reminder for American Jews that in a predominantly Christian society, they are a tribe set apart by their own calendar, rhythms and rituals.</p>
        <p>But in a dramatic theological statement that some rabbis plan to hash out in High Holiday sermons around the country, some of the most respected teachers in the Jewish world have just proclaimed that Judaism and Christianity are not so distinct after all.</p>
        <p>Nearly 170 Jewish scholars and rabbis released a statement last month asserting that ''Jews and Christians worship the same God,'' ''seek authority from the same book -- the Bible,'' and ''accept the moral principles of Torah.''</p>
        <p>To some ears, this was simply the goodwill language of common ground often heard in earnest interreligious dialogue. But other Jewish thinkers regard such statements as erroneous and even threatening -- a blurring of distinctions between two irreconcilable faiths.</p>
        <p>The debate began three weeks ago with the release of ''Dabru Emet: A Jewish Statement on Christians and Christianity'' (Dabru Emet means ''speak truth'' in Hebrew). It was written after five years of percolating by four professors: Dr. Michael A. Signer of the University of Notre Dame, Dr. Tikva Fryer-Kensky of the University of Chicago Divinity School, Dr. Peter W. Ochs of the University of Virginia and Dr. David Novak of the University of Toronto.</p>
        <p>The authors wanted to acknowledge that in the half-century since the Holocaust, many churches -- both Protestant and Roman Catholic -- had revoked their teachings that Judaism was a failed religion reviled by God. Because the Holocaust had propelled changes in the Christian canon, the Jewish thinkers who signed ''Dabru Emet'' agreed it was time to note the changes and to offer a response.</p>
        <p>What has already generated considerable debate is one of the statement's most provocative points, that ''Nazism was not a Christian phenomenon.'' It goes on to say that although many Christians participated in the Holocaust, ''Nazism itself was not an inevitable outcome of Christianity.''</p>
        <p>But the statement pivots on the idea that Judaism and Christianity revere the same God, the same Bible and same moral principles. In many Christian circles, this is accepted as gospel. When Prof. Phillip A. Cunningham, a Catholic, teaches theology classes at Boston College, he refers to the Old Testament as the ''Shared Testament.''</p>
        <p>''In terms of the written words, 95 percent of them are the same, so that's why I think it's fair to call it a shared religious heritage,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But do Jews and Christians really share a common Bible? Some of the scholars who did not sign the statement -- and even some who did -- say that is stretching the truth.</p>
        <p>''Christians often read the New Testament as an interpretive key to what the Old Testament really means,'' said Dr. Jon Levenson, the List professor of Jewish Studies at Harvard Divinity School. ''So to say we read the same book is a little misleading. We read the same book with opposing presuppositions that are mutually exclusive.''</p>
        <p>Christians read the Old Testament as Part 1 and the New Testament as Part 2 of the Bible, said Dr. Amy-Jill Levine, the Carpenter professor of New Testament studies at Vanderbilt University Divinity School. To Jews, the Bible is the Old Testament alone.</p>
        <p>''There is no reason for Jews to be citing the New Testament,'' Dr. Levine said. ''It's not part of our sacred scripture, any more than we would cite the Bhagavad-Gita or the Koran or the Sutras.''</p>
        <p>But even the Old Testament itself is not the same for Jews and Christians. Although the individual books, such as Genesis or Exodus, are the same, their order is different. The Christian version ends with the prophet Malachi predicting the return of Elijah, which Christians interpret as foreshadowing the New Testament arrivals of John the Baptist and Jesus. By contrast, the Jewish version ends in Second Chronicles, with an edict for the Jews to return home to Jerusalem and rebuild the temple, said Dr. Levine.</p>
        <p>DR. LEVENSON said that he could not in good conscience sign ''Dabru Emet,'' though he respected the motivation behind it.</p>
        <p>''The document did not adequately articulate why Jews should not be Christians, and why Judaism and Christianity cannot be combined, as they often are today,'' he said. ''And since Judaism is the unknown religion, the minority religion, it is the one under cognitive and social reasons to disappear.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Levine did sign, however. She said, ''I don't think educating Jews about Christianity will weaken Judaism. To the contrary. If one looks at Jesus as a Jew within a Jewish context, you find he has a lot to say to Jews in terms of social justice.''</p>
        <p>Among all the streams of Judaism, the Orthodox are usually the most hesitant to participate in interreligious dialogue relating to theology, which was discouraged by the renowned Orthodox rabbi, Joseph Soloveitchik.</p>
        <p>So it came as a surprise to count 11 Orthodox Jews among the signers of ''Dabru Emet,'' said Rabbi Irving Greenberg, an Orthodox Jew who is president of the Jewish Life Network. He signed, and said ''the most daring and interesting'' point the document made was about the shared Bible.</p>
        <p>''Think of the word of God,'' he said,  ''as something that has multiple wavelengths at which the melody is heard. If I hear the melody in treble and you hear it in bass, it is not that you have distorted hearing. What I'm saying, and what this statement is saying, is that God broadcasts to Jews in the treble and to Christians in the bass.''</p>
        <p>The real value of the statement, said Rabbi Greenberg, who is also the chairman  of the United States Holocaust Memorial Council, was that Jewish leaders had finally gone on record recognizing the monumental shifts in Christianity.</p>
        <p>''It's a response to the Christian repentance and self-correction, which is one of the great religious accomplishments ever,'' he said. ''It took 1,900 years, and I'm sorry it took the Holocaust to generate it, but it is still impressive.''</p>
