        <p>Miami limbered up for its game against Florida State by squashing Rutgers tonight, 64-6. Amazingly, the Hurricanes said they used a basic game plan but still got valuable contact work by gleefully mobbing each other in the end zone after each touchdown.</p>
        <p>Miami, ranked No. 10, cruised to a 41-0 halftime lead in dealing the Scarlet Knights their worst home loss in 112 years. Before 23,782 at Rutgers Stadium, most of whom were long gone by the fourth quarter, the Hurricanes (3-1, 2-0 Big East) accumulated 400 yards and 20 first downs in the first half alone against the Scarlet Knights (2-3, 0-3).</p>

        <p>Miami limbered up for its game against Florida State by squashing Rutgers tonight, 64-6. Amazingly, the Hurricanes said they used a basic game plan but still got valuable contact work by gleefully mobbing each other in the end zone after each touchdown.</p>
        <p>Miami, ranked No. 10, cruised to a 41-0 halftime lead in dealing the Scarlet Knights their worst home loss in 112 years. Before 23,782 at Rutgers Stadium, most of whom were long gone by the fourth quarter, the Hurricanes (3-1, 2-0 Big East) accumulated 400 yards and 20 first downs in the first half alone against the Scarlet Knights (2-3, 0-3).</p>
        <p>Miami Coach Butch Davis began giving some extra rest to his starters as Miami heads into next week's game at the Orange Bowl against the No. 2 Seminoles.</p>
        <p>''We went in really focused,'' Miami middle linebacker Dan Morgan said. ''We didn't want to overlook them (Rutgers) and focus just on the Florida State game.''</p>
        <p>Rutgers, which was flattened by Virginia Tech two weeks ago, 49-0, lost its 13th game by more than 40 points during coach Terry Shea's five-year, 49-game coaching tenure.  Miami, which beat the Scarlet Knights a year ago, 55-0, became the 14th opponent during Shea's tenure to score at least 50 points.</p>
        <p>Miami quarterback Ken Dorsey completed 14 of 19 passes for 215 yards and three touchdowns in less than a half. James Jackson rushed for 118 yards on just 15 carries and scored 3 touchdowns.</p>
        <p>''If we can take care of this game,'' Jackson said, referring to the Florida State game, ''I think everything will take care of itself for the national championship.''</p>
        <p>The Hurricanes defense, which scored a safety and a touchdown, kept Rutgers scoreless until 12:04 remained in the game.</p>
        <p>The Scarlet Knights' season-opening victories over Villanova, a Division I-AA team, and Buffalo, a Division I-A team for just two years, can now be considered a tease. Rutgers had a chance to beat Pittsburgh a week ago, but the Scarlet Knights, save a 44-yard first-quarter drive that stalled at the Miami 39, were simply not competitive against the Hurricanes. And the fact that Rutgers did not have its starting quarterback was only one of many reasons.</p>
        <p>Two plays into the second quarter, Miami had a 21-0 lead.</p>
        <p>The Hurricanes marched at least 80 yards on each of their first three touchdowns, and none of the drives lasted longer than 3 minutes, 18 seconds.</p>
        <p>''Their speed is overwhelming,'' Shea said of the Hurricanes. ''That's a team that many teams like us are aspiring to become. And we're not close.''</p>
        <p>Rutgers had won the coin toss, and Shea's decision to wait until the second half to receive looked silly.</p>
        <p>Quarterback Chad Schwenk looked good on Rutgers' second drive. He completed 5 of his first 6 passes and took the Scarlet Knights to the Miami 39, but the Hurricanes forced him to throw three straight incomplete passes, killing the drive.</p>
        <p>The game then disintegrated quickly. On Rutgers's next possession, Schwenk threw a short pass into double coverage, and Markese Fitzgerald made a fingertip interception at the Rutgers 19-yard line. Jackson scored his third touchdown of the game five plays later, on a 2-yard run.</p>
        <p>On Miami's next possession, outside linebacker Wes Robertson sacked Dorsey on third down, but Miami decided to go for a first down on fourth-and-3 from the Rutgers' 21. Dorsey floated a perfect fade pass to Reggie Wayne in a corner of the end zone for a touchdown, and Miami had a 35-0 lead with 7:28 left in the half.</p>
        <p>The Hurricanes then pushed their lead to 41-0 with 2:48 left in the half.</p>
        <p>Najeh Davenport, a 235-pound companion to Jackson in the Miami backfield, was stopped for no gain on third down at the Rutgers 4. Miami holder Aaron Moser mishandled the snap on a 21-yard field-goal try and was tackled for a 2-yard loss, and the Rutgers fans gave their loudest cheer of the half.</p>
        <p>But on the next play, Rutgers fullback Dennis Thomas had the ball knocked loose by Hurricanes defensive tackle Matt Walters, and Quincy Hipps pounced on the fumble in the end zone.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the people in charge of firing cannons in the end zone when Rutgers scores a touchdown had all their ammunition left.</p>
        <p>''We're going to pick up the pieces,'' Shea said. ''And there are a lot of pieces to collect.''</p>
