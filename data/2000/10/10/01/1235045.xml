        <p>WHEN the Hartford Symphony takes the stage at the Bushnell this season, the programs may very well produce more than music. One of the eight guest conductors of the subscription programs will likely become the symphony's new music director. Edward Cumming was at the podium last weekend, while Andre Raphel Smith, the assistant conductor of the Philadelphia Orchestra, arrives Oct. 17 and 18. Other conductors in the series include James Paul, Steven Smith, Leslie Dunner, Derrick Inouye, Enrique Arturo Diemecke and Ransom Wilson. Perhaps, however, the music director will be chosen from conductors coming into town for other parts of the symphony's season: Martin Fischer-Dieskau, in charge of two pops evenings; Peter Sacco and Randall Craig Fleischer, presiding over family matinees; Angel Gil-Ordonez and Joseph Silverstein, leading concerts by the Hartford Symphony Chamber Orchestra. The number to call for a list of programs and guest soloists is (860) 244-2999.</p>
        <p>The Norwalk and Greenwich Symphonies, both with opening nights on Oct. 14, are proceeding under the direction of long-standing, popular conductors. In the Norwalk Concert Hall at 8 p.m., Jesse Levine will offer a program that includes Mozart's Symphony No. 33, arias from ''Don Giovanni'' and ''Zaide'' as well as Mahler's Symphony No. 4 with the soprano Kaori Sato (203-866-2455).</p>

In the Norwalk Concert Hall at 8 p.m., Jesse Levine will offer a program that includes Mozart's Symphony No. 33, arias from ''Don Giovanni'' and ''Zaide'' as well as Mahler's Symphony No. 4 with the soprano Kaori Sato (203-866-2455).</p>
        <p>In Greenwich, David Gilbert begins his 26th season as music director with a program ranging from Vivaldi to Glen Cortese, whose ''Millennium Variations'' gets its Connecticut premiere. Also scheduled on the Oct. 14 program, which begins at 8:30 p.m. in Greenwich High School, is Beethoven's Symphony No. 4 and, with Gary Graffman  of the Curtis Institute in Philadelphia, playing Ravel's Piano Concerto for the Left Hand. The program will be repeated the following afternoon at 4 (203-869-2664).</p>
        <p>''Our upcoming season spotlights visions and visionaries,'' said Sidney Rothstein, music director of the Ridgefield Symphony. The works of four composers will be performed by a pair of soloists, the concert choir of Western Connecticut State University and an expanded orchestra in the symphony's opening concert, at 8 p.m. on Oct. 21. On the program are Wagner's ''Flying Dutchman Overture,'' Beethoven's Third Piano Concerto, the finale of Mahler's Symphony No. 3 and Arnold Schoenberg's ''Survivor from Warsaw'' (203-438-3889).</p>
        <p>The Stamford Symphony also begins its season Oct. 21. The 8:30 p.m. concert at the  Palace, and its 3 p.m. repeat on Oct. 22, find the music director, David Gilbert, sampling three staples of the repertory: Ravel's ''Tombeau de Couperin,'' Mendelssohn's ''Scottish'' Symphony and, with Ida Kavafian as soloist, Prokofiev's Violin Concerto No. 1. Separate series of pops, family and holiday programs can also be heard during the rest of the season (203-325-4466).</p>
        <p>Plenty of familiar works are on the programs of the Greater Bridgeport and Waterbury Symphony, too, but they are nicely spiced by rarities and premieres. When the trumpeter Allen Vizzuti is soloist at the first Greater Bridgeport concert, Oct. 28 at 8 p.m. in Klein Memorial Auditorium, he'll play works by Vivaldi, but also introduce two of his own original compositions. On Dec. 15, Hajime Teri Murai is the guest conductor of Tchaikovsky's all-but-forgotten Symphony No. 1, subtitled ''Winter Dreams.'' And when the music director Gustav Meier returns in the New Year (moving the orchestra to the Stratford Festival Theater while the Klein auditorium undergoes renovations), he'll present two works for the first time anywhere: Deborah Teason's ''Redemption Song'' and a symphonic movement by J. D. Gersen, 1999 winner of the Bridgeport Youth Symphony's student composers competition (203-576-0263).</p>
        <p>The Waterbury Symphony's 8:15 p.m. concert on Oct. 20 is a pops program at Warner Theater devoted to ''Music of the Night'' by Stephen Sondheim, Richard Rodgers and Andrew Lloyd Webber, among other Broadway notables. The classics will return on Dec. 2 and 3, even as the orchestra's music director, Leif Bjaland, takes the group back to Naugatuck Valley Community-Technical College. The novelties arrive in the New Year, with the Connecticut premieres of Peter Schickele's ''New Century Suite'' and David Carlson's ''Quantumsymphony,'' which Mr. Bjaland described as ''an electrifying exploration of the vast, uncharted regions of space'' (203-574-4283).</p>
        <p>The Vocal Scene</p>
        <p>Connecticut Choral Artists (also known as Concora) begins its season today with a 4 p.m. concert, ''Copland and Cohorts,'' at Cheney Hall in Manchester, a salute that will be repeated Oct. 14 at 8 P.M. at Westminster Presbyterian Church in West Hartford. The program includes Copland's work entitled ''In the Beginning,'' which the group's music director, Richard Coffey, described as challenging. Works by composers who influenced Copland or were influenced by him -- Debussy, Poulenc, Barber, Schuman and Ives -- will also be heard. ''An Alpine Christmas,'' an evening of operatic choruses, and Bach's ''St. Matthew Passion'' are highlights later in the season (860-224-7500). The passion of opera can be heard at the Palace Theater in Stamford on Oct. 14 at 7 p.m. ''We are extremely excited to present an emotionally charged evening of blockbuster arias, duets and scenes from beloved classics by Verdi and Puccini,'' said Laurence Gilgore, general director of Connecticut Grand Opera and Orchestra. Sherrill Milnes, Francisco Casanova and Theresa Santiago are among the performers. The first staged production follows in November, with the soprano Aprile Millo of the Metropolitan Opera as ''Tosca'' (203-359-0009).</p>
        <p>''We continue to explore great choral music from many different centuries and musical styles,'' said Arthur Sjogren, director of the Pro Arte Singers, proving the point with a diverse lineup at 4 p.m. on Oct. 29 at the Norwalk Concert Hall. A Bach Mass and a wedding anthem by Handel provide a baroque base, but thereafter the choir contrasts settings of the text ''When David Heard'' by the 16th-century Englishman Thomas Weelkes and the 20th-century American Norman Dinerstein and explore a Richard Strauss work (203 358-9282).</p>
        <p>Many choirs do not offer concerts until December. The Greenwich Choral Society, for instance, first steps out on Dec. 2 and 3, with concerts both days at 4 and 7:30 p.m. in Christ Church. The choir's music director, Paul Mueller, has planned holiday programming ranging from Vivaldi's ''Gloria,'' a staple of past years, to the world premiere of ''Songs of Innocence,'' by Adolphus Hailstork, who will not only attend the performances but also speak about the new piece at 6 o'clock on Dec. 2 (203-622-5136).</p>
        <p>A Christmas Carol Sing ushers in the season for the New England Chamber Choir on Dec. 15 at 7 p.m. in Second Congregational Church of Middle Haddam; in 2001, Richard Donohue is preparing for an afternoon of opera (Monteverdi to Puccini), an Easter festival and a spring concert pairing Brahms's German Requiem with Samuel Barber's ''Prayers of Kierkegaard'' (860-342-2328).</p>
        <p>Chamber Recitals</p>
        <p>Chamber music fans also have an abundance of riches from which to choose. Armstrong Chamber Concerts will offer 3 o'clock recitals Oct. 7 and Nov. 11 at First Congregational Church in Washington; the violinist Helen Armstrong will be joined by the pianist Randall Hodgkinson, the oboist Gerard Reuter, the violists Louise Schulman and Jesse Levine, the cellists Robert deMaine and Stephen Kates (860-868-0522).</p>
        <p>At 8 p.m. on Oct. 17, the Chamber Music Society at Yale presents the Muir Quartet; later in the season, there will be performances by Calliope Renaissance Band, the Takacs Quartet, the American Chamber Players and the Tokyo String Quartet.</p>
        <p>Yale, of course, is host to dozens of other concerts, many of them free, throughout the academic year; tomorrow, for example, there is an 8 p.m. recital by the pianists Michael Friedmann and Peter Frankl (203-432-4158).</p>
        <p>The Newtown Friends of Music have invited the Yale graduate student and pianist Anna Grinberg to give a ''Praeludium Recital'' as part of their regular Sunday afternoon series at the Edmond Town Hall (it's set for 3 p.m. on Oct. 22); after that come the appearances of the Ying and Alexander Quartets, the cellist Ole Akahoshi and the Jacques Thibaud String Trio (203-426-6470).</p>
        <p>The Miami String Quartet will play the first of the 4 o'clock recitals in the Candlelight Concert series at Wilton Congregational Church on Oct. 22, followed in November by the Opus One Piano Quartet. In January, the harpsichordist Bradley Brookshire will perform, and in February it will be the Aspen Winds (203-762-3401).</p>
        <p>Wind octets by Mozart, Haydn and Beethoven open the 29th year of concerts by the Chamber Players of the Greenwich Symphony; the 4 p.m. program on Oct. 22 in Second Congregational Church will be repeated the following evening at the Bruce Museum. Other pairings follow in November, January and March (203-869-5734).</p>
        <p>The new season of the Danbury Concert Association gets underway on Oct. 15 at 3:15 p.m. when the pianist Santiago Rodriguez plays in Ives Hall (on the campus of Western Connecticut State University).</p>
        <p>On Nov. 4, the violinist and conductor Salvatore Accardo takes his Orchestra Da Camera Italiana to Ives Hall for its first performances in Connecticut; in 2001 the Spoleto Festival USA Chamber Players and the violin-piano duo of Ayako Yoshida and Andrew Armstrong will be presented (203-748-0522).</p>
        <p>Chamber music with an international style is the promise of Wesleyan University's Crowell Concert Series, which spotlights such fare as Spanish music for four guitars by Entrequatre, an ensemble based in Asturias (8 p.m. Oct. 21), French pieces for a variety of struck instruments from Les Percussions de Strasbourg (Nov. 10, also at 8) and ahead in 2001, programs by the female vocal quartet Anonymous Four, the jazz pianist Ahmed Jamal, and the Kronos Quartet (860-685-3355).</p>
