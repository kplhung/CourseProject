        <p>Several times a month, in preparation for a statewide math exam later this school year, the opening minutes of every 9th and 10th grade class at Northwest Cabarrus High are devoted to math, no matter whether the class is Latin, history or physical education.</p>
        <p>The math teachers give the gym instructors problems about batting averages, and ask the social studies teachers to work through equations related to the population of Japan.</p>
        <p>High school teachers sometimes isolate themselves in their classrooms, but the instructors at Northwest Cabarrus High in this suburb of Charlotte have been brought together, at least in part, in pursuit of a common goal: money. If the school's test scores in various subjects exceed a rate set by the state, then every teacher, including the gym teacher, will receive a $1,500 bonus.</p>
        <p>And it is not just the teachers here who stand to gain. Under a separate initiative, students at Northwest Cabarrus who have high grade point averages, or whose averages increase significantly, now carry gold, silver and white identification cards that entitle them to a $2 discount at Great Clips hair salon, free toppings at Ci-Ci's Pizza and even a chit to skip a test or homework assignment.</p>
        <p>As nearly every state moves to install new standardized tests and measures of accountability, the three-year-old North Carolina program, which treats teachers like shareholders and students like sales clerks vying to meet quotas, is being closely watched.</p>
        <p>''People say, 'You're a teacher, you're not in it for the money,' '' said Clyde Campbell, 57, a history teacher here, as he walked to the main office to pick up his bonus check on the day Northwest Cabarrus High's efforts on last year's exams were rewarded.</p>
        <p>''But,'' added Mr. Campbell, who is called Soupy, ''$1,500 is a lot to someone with two kids in college.''</p>
        <p>Merit pay has become a focus in contract negotiations in school districts around the country, and North Carolina's experience with schoolwide bonuses is seen as a potential compromise. It is a program that, so far, satisfies politicians intent on tying at least some part of teachers' salaries to student performance, while respecting the concerns of unions that a teacher not be judged solely on the work of his students, whose abilities can vary wildly.</p>
        <p>Such ideas are spreading.</p>
        <p>In an even more sweeping change in how teachers are paid, the teachers' union in Cincinnati narrowly voted in September to peg teachers' progress up the salary ladder to the results of an evaluation performed by another teacher and the principal. Teachers will now be placed in five categories, from apprentice to accomplished. Standardized test scores are not included, however.</p>
        <p>California will release a list in October of schools that have met statewide targets on standardized tests, entitling several thousand schools, for the first time, to bonuses of about $800 per teacher and administrator. In December, it will award another round of far more lucrative bonuses to more than 200 improving schools -- the awards range from $5,000 to $25,000 per teacher and administrator, depending on a school's performance -- with the individual districts and union chapters charged with distributing the money.</p>
        <p>Smaller programs are being tested in two Brooklyn school districts.</p>
        <p>Northwest Cabarrus High is also one of 3,500 schools across the country that have recently adopted the student gold card program, called Renaissance, which is sponsored by Jostens of Minneapolis, a leading manufacturer of yearbooks.</p>
        <p>Among experts who are impressed by the North Carolina and Cincinnati approaches is Allan Odden, a professor of education at the University of Wisconsin at Madison who specializes in teacher compensation. Like a similar program in Kentucky, Professor Odden said, the North Carolina model emphasizes a school's core mission, provided the tests are an accurate measure of what should be going on in class.</p>
        <p>''You could have performance-based accountability and reward it with a handshake,'' he said. ''But I would say the whole strategy is stronger if there's a carrot.''</p>
        <p>Professor Odden said that it was far too early to determine whether students were learning more as a result of the program, but that studies of the Kentucky program in the mid-1990's had shown that to sustain long-term gains, schools had to move beyond merely ''teaching to the test.'' (Thus far, North Carolina has  avoided one of the minefields in the Kentucky program: the alienation of parents who felt the schools, and not teachers, deserved the bonus money; two years ago, the Kentucky Legislature rewrote its system to defer to the parents.)</p>
        <p>In the North Carolina program, scores on standardized exams in five core subjects -- along with a writing and math test -- are combined in an index that roughly tracks the percentage of students who are performing at grade level. That index is then compared with an average of scores over the previous two years.</p>
        <p>Teachers and administrators at a school that posts a gain of even one-tenth of a percentage point are rewarded with a $750 bonus. (Teachers' assistants receive $375.) But teachers at schools that reach the next plateau -- a complicated formula that stipulates an improvement of about two to four percentage points, depending on previous performance -- earn $1,500 each, with the teachers' assistants paid $500.</p>
        <p>Last year, in the program's third full year, teachers at half of the state's 2,000 schools received the larger bonuses, and a quarter more received the smaller bonuses. These stipends came over a period when the average teacher's salary, which is set by the state, rose 26 percent, from $31,167 to $39,220.</p>
        <p>At Northwest Cabarrus High, the pressure is palpable. That the school, one of the top performers in the state, has received bonuses two years in a row is of little comfort. To keep its standing, scores must improve more this year, or the school will be singled out by the state for losing ground, no matter how little; not only will teacher paychecks shrink, but parents will surely ask what went wrong. Never mind that fluctuations of a few points in standardized test scores are regarded by experts as having little meaning.</p>
        <p>''It's sort of like Florida State University in football,'' said Phil Hull, a former assistant principal at Northwest Cabarrus who is its rookie principal this year. ''If they don't finish every year in the top three, they're a failure.''</p>
        <p>In the English department, Sharon Drace, who teaches 10th grade, is discussing world literature and drilling students in several hundred technical literary terms -- as common as ''irony'' and obscure as ''archetype'' -- one of which will be the basis of the lone question on the state's English writing exam. Those who score below 70 on the test, which is factored into the school's bonus index, will have to repeat the class.</p>
        <p>''Your whole life in this class depends on whether you pass one question,'' Ms. Drace said.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, Ms. Drace, who is 57 and began teaching eight years ago, says she is happy to accept her bonus. The $1,500 represents an increase of about 4.6 percent over her $32,000 salary. And though one colleague used the money this year to pay for her son's laser eye surgery, Ms. Drace spent her windfall on her fall graduate school tuition and for  car insurance.</p>
        <p>''The last $54 I used to go out and buy a Revere stew pot,'' she said.</p>
        <p>For students, there have been perquisites as well. About 200 of the school's 1,500 students are carrying gold cards this fall, meaning they had a ''straight-A'' average or better last year (honors courses are worth extra credit) and had no more than six absences, with no suspensions. Three hundred more have silver cards, meaning they have at least a ''B'' average.</p>
        <p>Though the discounts at local merchants are similar, many students say that the prestige of the gold card is the biggest draw.</p>
        <p>''I wanted the gold card so much,'' said Tempess Stark, 15, who raised her average to an A from a B-plus last year. ''I wanted the best.''</p>
        <p>Becky Griffin, 15, who carries a silver card in her wallet, said the cards are a constant source of conversation.</p>
        <p>''You're always comparing G.P.A.'s,'' she said. ''All your friends ask if you have a silver or gold. If you have a silver and they have a gold, it makes you want to be up there with them.''</p>
        <p>But Charles Dickerson, 16, who did not qualify for a card last year but thought he might be in contention for at least a silver this year, said it did not motivate him.</p>
        <p>''It sets up a barrier, smart kids and dumb kids,'' he said. ''I don't think it's cool.''</p>
