        <p>The Westchester Philharmonic, which played Hindemith and Schoenberg at its opening concerts a couple of weekends ago, returns to Purchase College Nov. 11 and 12 (at 8 p.m. and 3 p.m., respectively) with a  lineup that includes the world premiere of David Mallamud's ''Par 80,'' Copland's ''Organ'' Symphony, with Prof. Robert Fertitta of Purchase College as soloist.

        <p>MANY orchestras are notoriously conservative, but here in Westchester the three major symphonic ensembles all have the programming courage of their convictions, with music of the 20th century well in evidence in the new season.</p>
        <p>The Westchester Philharmonic, which played Hindemith and Schoenberg at its opening concerts a couple of weekends ago, returns to Purchase College Nov. 11 and 12 (at 8 p.m. and 3 p.m., respectively) with a  lineup that includes the world premiere of David Mallamud's ''Par 80,'' Copland's ''Organ'' Symphony, with Prof. Robert Fertitta of Purchase College as soloist. The program also includes Carlos Chavez's ''Sinfonia India'' and, with Robert Bonfiglio as the guest artist, the Vaughan Williams's Harmonica Concerto.</p>
        <p>''I'm trying to get people to listen to old music and new music in the same way,'' said the philharmonic's music director, Paul Lustig Dunkel. ''The Vaughan Williams straddles the pop and classical worlds, while the Chavez and Copland pieces, dating back to the 1920's and 30's, burst upon the music scene like bombshells. They caused fury and scorn among the critics, but were they ever exciting.''</p>
        <p>For information on the concert series and nonsubscription concerts, including Halloween shows for children on Oct. 22, call (914) 682-3707.</p>
        <p>Another of Copland's brightly hued, though less familiar, scores, ''Three Latin American Sketches,'' is the curtain raiser for the new cycle of concerts by the Westchester Symphony Orchestra, whose music director is Anthony Aibel. ' The opening program, Oct. 14 at 8 p.m. at Purchase College, also includes Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 26, introducing the 10-year-old prodigy Claire Huangci, and the Schumann Fourth Symphony. Coming up later in the season: Bloch's ''Baal Shem,'' Barber's ''Adagio for Strings'' and ''Ben Hur'' by the award-winning American composer Kevin Scott. For information on the program, call (914) 631-4313.</p>
        <p>When the Performing Arts Center at Purchase College opened nearly a quarter of a century ago, one of the first concerts there was by Philharmonia Virtuosi, and that ensemble has returned every year since. This year the ensemble will give seven concerts, the first on Oct. 15 at 3 p.m. It will be devoted to chamber music by Beethoven, but when the orchestra assembles on Oct. 29, the music director, Richard Kapp, conducts the full orchestra in one of his typically varied fusions: Bach's Suite No. 1, the rarely encountered ''Rakastava'' Suite of Sibelius and, with the assistance of Eliot Fisk, Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco's Guitar Concerto No. 1. For a brochure on the season, including ''Peter and the Wolf'' and other ''Cushion Concerts'' for children, call (914) 693-5595.</p>
        <p>Today at 3 p.m., Philharmonia Virtuosi and Mr. Kapp will help the Pulvermann Foundation start its 10th season of free concerts at Rye High School. Two soloists share the solo spotlight, the violinist Mela Tenebaum, playing ''Spring'' from Vivaldi's ''Four Seasons,'' and the clarinetist Igor Begelman, a 2000 Avery Fisher Career Grant winner, presenting a premiere of his own Fantasy on Themes From Verdi's ''Traviata.'' Also on the program: Mozart's ''Eine kleine Nachtmusik'' and  Gershwin's ''Lullaby.''</p>
        <p>The Westchester Chamber Orchestra, under Barry Charles Hoffman as music director, begins its fourth year at the Joyce Auditorium of Iona College in New Rochelle. Opening night is Oct. 14 at 8, when the tenor Robert White leads the way to an evening of Irish songs and other Celtic favorites. Later concerts take a more contemporary turn, with Matt Sullivan playing the Vaughan Williams Oboe Concerto and the soprano Hanli Stapela recounting Barber's ''Knoxville: Summer of 1915'' (914) 235-6528).</p>
        <p>Many Westchester choirs have already officially completed their auditions for their fall concerts, butall of them are still likely to welcome new members. For instance, you can try joining the Choral Arts Society, which will sing the Brahms ''German Requiem'' with the Chappaqua Chamber Orchestra on Nov. 5 at  Tarrytown Music Hall. ''This is a singular opportunity for us to perform with a complete orchestra of players who are accustomed to working together,'' said Timothy Vernon, the music director, observing that the choral group will again share the stage with the Chappaqua Chamber Orchestra in March, performing an all-Haydn program. For information about the programs, call (914) 428-4183 or (914) 684-2576.</p>
        <p>Too early to think about the holidays? Not for the Westchester Concert Singers, rehearsing under John Daly Goodwin for a Dec. 2 concert at Faith Lutheran Brethren Church in Briarcliff. The program will sample Bach's ''Christmas Oratorio'' before moving on to Three Carols by that significantly lesser member of the family known as PDQ Bach. (914-769-2312). Another holiday program comes from David Graf, who will combine the young voices of the Boys Choir of Westchester and the Westchester Girls Choir in a carol fest on Dec. 20 at Grace Episcopal Church in White Plains (914-666-5719).</p>
        <p>Informal opportunities to sing it yourself are provided by the Westchester Gilbert and Sullivan Group. ''With the recent popularity of 'Topsy Turvy,' we've attracted new members, and the group is really thriving,'' says Emily Kingsley, who has the monthly 7:30 p.m. singalongs  at her Briarcliff home. Arriving Oct. 18 is ''Iolanthe'' with ''Princess Ida'' and ''The Mikado'' coming in November and December. (914-923-2995).</p>
        <p>The Tokyo String Quartet opened the season for Friends of Music last weekend, but five other chamber ensembles are still en route to Ossining High School. Next Saturday at 8:30 p.m., the Naumburg Award-winning Eroica Trio will be there, followed on Nov. 18 by the cello-piano duo of Carter Brey (principal cellist of the New York Philharmonic) and Christopher O'Riley. On deck for next spring: the Lark Quartet, Cuarteto Latinoamericano and the violinist Elmar Oliveira, who is a resident of Croton-on-Hudson. (914-271-8598).</p>
        <p>The first of the Westchester Chamber Music Society concerts, on Oct. 15 at 8 p.m. at Congregation Emanu-El of Rye, features the American String Quartet with Haydn, Prokofiev and Beethoven. Those who didn't catch the Tokyo in Ossining can hear the quartet in Rye, where they will present Mozart, Schubert and Bartok on Nov, 12. A quartet and a half is offered on Dec. 10, as Samuel Rhodes and Joel Krosnick (of the Juilliard String Quartet) join the Brentano Quartet for the G major Brahms Sextet (914-948-6533 or 914-723-0222).</p>
        <p>Describing the programs of Performers of Westchester concerts, the violinist and music director Alexander Simionescu said: ''You are one of a small audience in private homes and experience an intimacy with the music and musicians unequaled in a concert hall.'' The season begins at 8:30 p.m. on Oct. 20 in Harrison and continues the following Sunday at 4 p.m. in Mamaroneck, as Mr. Simionescu, his violinist-wife, Pamela Frank, and her father, the pianist Claude Frank, are joined by two noted, if nonfamily colleagues, the violist Paul Coletti and the cellist Ronald Thomas. Among the groups coming later in the fall: the Laurel and Divertimento Trios and the Arcata String Quartet (914-693-9658).</p>
        <p>Far and away the most sweeping schedule of events is that of the Performing Arts Center at Purchase College, which, besides making its halls available for rental to the orchestras mentioned above, has more than 80 events on its own roster. For starters, the Orpheus Chamber Orchestra performs on Friday at 8 p.m., followed by the Glenn Miller Orchestra at 3 p.m. next Sunday. Other attractions include Joan Baez on Oct. 13, and on Oct. 20, the Ballet Folklorico de Mexico (Box office: 914-251-6200).</p>
        <p>Caramoor these days is no longer just a summer festival. Most Wednesdays at 11 a.m. a ''Performer's Showcase'' introduces young talent (this week it's the pianist Katya Grineva, on Oct. 11 the Anthea Kreston Piano Trio); each of the 45-minute recitals is followed by a tour of the House Museum. Also on this month's agenda are a master class and recital given by Philip Smith, principal trumpeter of the New York Philharmonic, a jazz morning with the BearCats Dixieland Band and a ''Rising Stars'' chamber music evening (914-232-5035).</p>
        <p>The Emelin Theater in Mamaroneck offers seven subscription series, including family programming, name performers, alternative folk, bluegrass, cabaret and Klezmer. There are eight recitals in the classical cycle, starting Oct. 21 at 8 p.m., when Paul Ostrovsky, Mark Peskanov, Toby Hoffman and Nathaniel Rosen convene for chamber music of Mozart, Schubert and Beethoven (914-698-0098).</p>
        <p>The Fox Lane School in Bedford is the site of dance and classical music performances offered by the Mount Kisco Concert Association. Pilobolus Too, an offshoot of the Pilobolus Dance Theater, gives a family matinee Oct. 15 at 3 p.m., while on Oct. 28 at 8 p.m., the 58-piece Orchestra da Camera Italiana makes its Westchester debut with Salvatore Accardo as conductor and violin soloist (914-666-9181).</p>
