        <p>One by one, the options kept fading for Lauren Jackson. Worn down on the inside, barely able to get free on the perimeter, Jackson, the young star of the Australian team, resorted to the only move she had left against the Americans, a move straight out of a heated schoolyard:</p>
        <p>She pulled someone's hair.</p>
        <p>With four minutes left in the gold medal game tonight, and while jostling under the basket, the frustrated 19-year-old Jackson plucked Lisa Leslie's ponytail, sending the hairpiece into a row of photographers. Leslie was embarrassed, but not enough to hold her tongue on the way up the floor.</p>
        <p>''I told her she could have the hair; I'll take the gold,'' said Leslie, the United States center.</p>
        <p>And the Americans spoiled the teenager's party by routing Australia, 76-54, to win their second straight Olympic basketball gold medal in front of 15,000 people who had wanted to see them put in their places.</p>
        <p>Leslie and her teammates dedicated the game to Teresa Edwards, the 36-year-old, five-time Olympian who is retiring.</p>
        <p>The United States women turned in a virtuoso big-game performance. Leslie was a force underneath, scoring 15 points and gathering 9 rebounds, using her sinewy frame and footwork to make Jackson work inside. Edwards and Dawn Staley moved the ball on offense and pressured the Australians on defense. Sheryl Swoopes (14 points) ran the floor, Natalie Williams (15 points, 9 rebounds) and Yolanda Griffith (13 points, 12 rebounds) muscled inside, and everyone but the injured Chamique Holdsclaw got off the bench to celebrate in the final minutes.</p>
        <p>In the bronze medal game, Janeth Arcain had 28 points and Alessandra Oliveira 26 as Brazil beat South Korea, 84-73, in overtime.</p>
        <p>Jackson, a 6-foot-5 center, was essentially a one-woman team for much of the night, one of the few Australians who could create her own shot. She ended with 20 points on 6-of-17 shooting, with 13 rebounds and 4 blocked shots. But Griffith, Williams and Leslie made Jackson work on every possession, and at the end she symbolized her exhausted team.</p>
        <p>Stubborn pride and all, she could not keep up with the Americans.</p>
        <p>''The Americans are great, they're an awesome team,'' Jackson said. ''They played a great game. But we can beat them. I still think we can beat them.''</p>
        <p>She did not address the hair-pulling incident, which Leslie contended was intentional. Emotionally drained after her first Olympics, Jackson cried in the locker room.</p>
        <p>Brash and skilled beyond her years, she helped foster the rivalry the past week. Several of her teammates joined in. In the end, that supreme confidence may have been Australia's undoing.</p>
        <p>''We had heard from them how we couldn't run with them; they were going to take it to us,'' Leslie said afterward. ''And all the newspapers would be on our doorsteps every morning, with Australia on the front. It was just so much motivation that we felt like the underdogs.''</p>
        <p>Vince Carter, Kevin Garnett, Alonzo Mourning and most of the United States men's basketball team showed up to cheer and watch, engaging in harmless trash talk with 100 or so green-and-gold-clad Australian fans at courtside. The United States women's soccer team also showed up for support.</p>
        <p>They were drowned out by the home crowd for about the first 10 minutes, until the United States started to pull away. The Americans led by 43-30 at halftime. Australia's one great opportunity came with less than 15 minutes left when Trish Fallon converted a 3-point play to draw the Opals, the team's nickname, within 53-45.</p>
        <p>But Leslie, Griffith and Williams put the game away with a show of their grit and perseverance inside. They combined to score 10 of the next 12 points to push the lead to 17 with 9 minutes 28 seconds left.</p>
        <p>Australia was dealt a blow when Kristi Harrower, the starting point guard, went down with an ankle injury with 16 minutes left. As the game wore on, it became clear that the more experienced and deeper Americans would not give in to youth or a crowd pulling for their opponents.</p>
        <p>With 52 seconds left, Coach Nell Fortner cleared her bench, and the United States party began. Everyone hugged Edwards, who shed some tears as she left the floor for the last time after an extended celebration.</p>
        <p>Nikki McCray gyrated in the middle of the floor, Staley did cartwheels along the sideline and the other players began dancing and high-fiving.</p>
        <p>The nastiness that characterized the game seemed dead at the buzzer, with Leslie, who was draped in an American flag, hugging Jackson, and the Australians and the Americans congratulating one another.</p>
        <p>Not that the rivalry will expire any time soon.</p>
        <p>''She was apologizing for pulling my hairpiece, said she didn't mean to and all that,'' Leslie said of Jackson. ''It didn't matter. You have to ask her why that was in her heart.''</p>
        <p>Jackson could be the No. 1 pick in next season's Women's National Basketball Association draft. That prospect entices Leslie, who said, ''If she wants to come to the W.N.B.A., she can meet me again on my turf.''</p>
        <p>As Edwards said goodbye, another veteran spoke of stepping down as well. The 28-year-old Leslie said she was officially retiring from the Olympics. They would both go out knowing that young upstarts like Jackson never toppled them.</p>
        <p>When asked if she would consider playing in 2004, Leslie asked where the Olympics were being held. Athens, she was told.</p>
        <p>''Nah,'' she said. ''I have a gold medal and I'm going home. That's it. I can get my hair done over.''</p>
