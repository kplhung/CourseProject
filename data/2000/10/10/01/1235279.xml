        <p>The hypermodern openings that made their debut after World War I stressed holding back the center pawns with the intent of lining up pieces for a concentrated attack to demolish the enemy pawn center, which had been allowed to expand without restraint.

        <p>The hypermodern openings that made their debut after World War I stressed holding back the center pawns with the intent of lining up pieces for a concentrated attack to demolish the enemy pawn center, which had been allowed to expand without restraint. But to hold back without a plan to undermine White's center is to invite disaster. Black's position can end up in self-destructive passivity with a cramped formation.</p>
        <p>So, there must come a moment when the hypermodernist springs into action and carries through his plan. But in the fourth round game between the grandmaster Gregory Kaidanov of Lexington, Ky., and Peter Bereolos of Nashville in the United States Open Championship in St. Paul in August, Black made no provision for the counterattack he needed. And Kaidanov broke through nicely on the kingside.</p>
        <p>In the Robatsch Defense after 3 Nc3, the order of moves with 3 . . . c6 is aimed at discouraging the aggressive 4 f4, which could be countered by 4 . . . d5 5 e5 h5 6 Be3 Nh6 7 Nf3 Bg4 and a blockade on the light squares in the kingside. Kaidanov contented himself with the conservative 4 Nf3, which preserves a flexible pawn structure.</p>
        <p>After 5 Be2, Bereolos could well have developed with 5 . . . Nf6. There is nothing to be gained by White's playing 6 e5 de 7 Ne5 or 7 de Qd1 8 Nd1 Ng4.</p>
        <p>After 6 O-O, it was high time for Bereolos to seize a piece of the center in classical style with 6 . . . e5. Instead, he sidelined a knight with 6 Nh6?! and following 7 h3 O-O 8 Be3, he had to defend against the threat to win a piece with 9 Qd2 by weakening his pawn formation with 8 . . . f6.</p>
        <p>Kaidanov intensified the debility of the e6 square by advancing with 10 d5, threatening 11 Nd4 and 12 Ne6.</p>
        <p>It is understandable that Bereolos would fight for central space with 11 . . . f5, even though it loosened his king's defense. He had no other way to open the game to activate his pieces.</p>
        <p>After 16 . . . Ng6, Kaidanov opened fire on the backward e7 pawn with 17 Bh5! Perhaps Bereolos should have offered to exchange a pair of bishops with 17 . . . Bf6. Instead, he blocked the weakness with 17 . . . Be5.</p>
        <p>With 20 Bg6 hg, Kaidanov removed the knight that was holding the black kingside together. After 21 Nf4, Bereolos could not afford to exchange the attacking white knight because 21 . . . Bf4 22 Qf4 would make the e7 pawn indefensible.</p>
        <p>After Bereolos made a desperate attempt to get counterplay with 25 . . . Qa5, Kaidanov bored in with 26 Bg5 Rf7 27 Ng6, and after 27 . . . Rh7 he struck with 28 Ne7! Kg7 29 Bh6!</p>
        <p>The final point was that 29 . . . Rh6 30 Qg5 Kf7 31 Qh6 Ke7 32 f4 Rb8 33 fe not only yielded Kaidanov a rook for a bishop, but also a winning mating attack. Bereolos gave up.</p>
