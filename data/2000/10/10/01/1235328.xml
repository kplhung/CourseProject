        <p>For two seasons, the Delbarton Green Wave had cruised into its locker room each week with a comfortable halftime lead.</p>
        <p>Bishop Francis, an unranked team from East Orange, N.J., ended that streak yesterday, taking advantage of four Delbarton mistakes to jump to a 13-point halftime advantage.</p>
        <p>But Delbarton, New Jersey's second-ranked team, scored three consecutive touchdowns in the second half to win, 28-20, despite playing without its starting quarterback (Jeff Parros) and star receiver (Wes Swackhamer).</p>
        <p>Delbarton, of Morris County, N.J., benefited from two touchdowns in the fourth quarter by Sean Farrell. The first score by Farrell, a senior tailback, was a 2-yard run, capping a 12-play, 86-yard drive. Farrell recovered the ensuing onside kick, and five plays later, he scored from 4 yards out. Farrell finished with 117 yards on 12 carries.</p>
        <p>Delbarton's other touchdowns were scored by Raffael DeLuca, on a 3-yard run in the first quarter, and Geoff Close's 8-yard run in the third.</p>
        <p>Bishop Francis' scores came on Corey Cooper's 88-yard kickoff return in the first quarter; Calif Harris's 3-yard run in the second quarter (set up by a blocked punt); and Anthony Bailey's 1-yard dive (set up by an interception) in the second quarter.</p>
        <p>Delbarton's defense kept Bishop Francis out of the end zone in the second half largerly because of the stellar play of the junior linebacker Gavin Weeks, who registered 7 of his 11 tackles and a sack in the fourth quarter.</p>
        <p>Elsewhere in New Jersey, Bergen Catholic (4-0), the third-rated team in the state, kept its undefeated season alive by defeating Paramus Catholic, 29-20.</p>
        <p>Joe Sandberg (19 carries for 124 yards) and Andrew Stuerzel (16 carries for 68 yards) rushed for a touchdown apiece and Jeff Sticco scored twice to pace the Crusaders. Chris Hanly, a sophomore, kicked a 32-yard field goal with 1 minute 40 seconds remaining to ice the game.</p>
        <p>For Paramus Catholic (1-3), James O'Leary, a sophomore quarterback, completed 22 of 45 for 218 yards and 3 touchdowns. O'Leary's scoring passes were to Paul Santiago, Mike Sumulikoski and Eddie Smith.</p>
        <p>Thomas Zydel, Bergen Catholic's senior quarterback, completed 7 of 9 passes for 90 yards. Bergen Catholic's rushing attack produced 253 yards, while Paramus Catholic's ground game was held to 11 yards.</p>
        <p>Bergen Catholic plays at home against Bloomfield (3-0) next Saturday.</p>
        <p>On Friday night, Paterson Catholic (4-0) ended Glen Rock's 26-game winning streak, 14-10.</p>
        <p>Reggie Brown, a senior fullback, ran 34 times for 205 yards and a touchdown to help Paterson Catholic end Glen Rock's impressive run, which began in its second game in 1998. Glen Rock (3-1) had not lost to Paterson Catholic since 1993.</p>
        <p>But with Brown leading the offense and lineman Davon Clark leading the defense, Paterson Catholic avenged its only loss of last year. Clark had quite a day as he piled up 3 sacks, 2 tipped passes and an interception at the Glen Rock 10-yard line.</p>
        <p>Glen Rock did not go quietly however. Glen Rock's Craig Agnello returned a kickoff 90 yards for a touchdown in the second half that cut the deficit to 20-14.</p>
        <p>On Paterson Catholic's next possession, Glen Rock got an interception from Joe Barron with a little less than five minutes left in the game. Glen Rock's chances were ended, however, when safety Nygel McGuire intercepted a pass and Paterson Catholic ran out the clock.</p>
        <p>C.H.S.F.L.</p>
        <p>In a battle of Catholic High School Football League Bronx rivals, FORDHAM PREP (3-1) defeated MOUNT ST. MICHAEL (2-1), 27-7.</p>
        <p>Matt Rinklin, a senior, led the way for Fordham Prep, completing 18 of 29 passes for 239 yards and 2 touchdowns. Both touchdown passes were to David Bailey, who had 7 catches for 178 yards. Bailey also intercepted a pass and ran it back 41 yards for a touchdown. The senior linebacker Michael Sangobowale anchored the defense with four tackles and two sacks.</p>
        <p>PREPS</p>
        <p>Mike Francour (10 of 17 for 185 yards) hooked up with Steve Radkovich (six catches for 122 yards) on two scoring plays as CHESHIRE ACADEMY (1-1) cruised to a 30-22 victory over NEW YORK MILITARY ACADEMY (0-3). Jim Walsh of New York Military Academy ran for two touchdowns and threw for another.</p>
        <p>SALISBURY (2-0) rocked host CANTERBURY, 41-7. Dennis Hicks rushed for 91 yards on 19 carries for Canterbury (1-1).</p>
        <p>On Friday night, Danny Skelly, a senior tailback, scored three short touchdowns -- two on the ground and one by air -- to help RIVERDALE (3-0) to a 29-20 victory over NAZARETH (2-2). Skelly also recorded 11 tackles as an inside linebacker. Joe Bernard (12 carries for 71 yards) contributed a 23-yard touchdown run in the victory.</p>
