        <p>Until a few years ago, it was relatively easy to cross the Atlantic on a freighter, but more and more lines have stopped taking passengers on that popular route. There are, however, still some freighters available between North America and Europe.</p>
        <p>One is the 45,000-ton Hong Kong Senator, a German-flag container ship built in 1993 and chartered by the Swiss MSC and Korean Seanator Line. The ship has a passenger capacity of 10 and makes a round trip of approximately 56 days, leaving from San Francisco, then sailing to Manzanillo, Mexico, transiting the Panama Canal and proceeding to Savannah, Ga., Norfolk, Va., and New York before crossing to Felixstowe, England; Bremerhaven, Germany, Rotterdam and Le Havre. The ship comes back by way of New York, Norfolk, Savannah, the Panama Canal and Manzanillo, ending the voyage in Los Angeles.</p>

        <p>Until a few years ago, it was relatively easy to cross the Atlantic on a freighter, but more and more lines have stopped taking passengers on that popular route. There are, however, still some freighters available between North America and Europe.</p>
        <p>One is the 45,000-ton Hong Kong Senator, a German-flag container ship built in 1993 and chartered by the Swiss MSC and Korean Seanator Line. The ship has a passenger capacity of 10 and makes a round trip of approximately 56 days, leaving from San Francisco, then sailing to Manzanillo, Mexico, transiting the Panama Canal and proceeding to Savannah, Ga., Norfolk, Va., and New York before crossing to Felixstowe, England; Bremerhaven, Germany, Rotterdam and Le Havre. The ship comes back by way of New York, Norfolk, Savannah, the Panama Canal and Manzanillo, ending the voyage in Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>All cabins are air-conditioned and have private baths, a minibar and a refrigerator and windows with a view, but not all views are forward facing. All public rooms, including the dining room, the TV lounge, with  bar, exercise room, sauna, swimming pool and self-service laundry are shared with the ship's officers and are a few decks below the passenger accommodations.</p>
        <p>The age limit is 79, and a statement of good health and inoculations against yellow fever and cholera are required. Passports must be valid for at least six months beyond the passenger's expected return. Fares begin at $3,640 a person in double occupancy.</p>
        <p>When a freighter makes a port call, loading and unloading freight determines the length of time for sightseeing ashore, usually longer than on a cruise ship. And since cargo takes precedence on freighters, delays can occur. Like the Hong Kong Senator, most freighters carry no more than 12 passengers (the limit for sailing without a full-time doctor aboard).</p>
