        <p>Tipper Gore hopped off a New Orleans streetcar and boogied her way through the crowd, shimmying all alone to the music of a Dixieland band. Wacky, fun-loving Tipper was at it again. Just as in Los Angeles, where she had jammed on stage at the Democratic convention. Which was nothing compared with her performance four years ago in Chicago. That time, she jumped into Lake Michigan with her clothes on. Officially, she's the antidote to her stuffy husband, Lucy to his Ricky Ricardo, forever mugging and angling to play with the band. What will she think of next? Today, it's a one-woman line dance outside the local party headquarters, where she's supposed to cut a ribbon and give a speech. But there is something a little off, a little forced about the gaiety swirling around the laughing woman who is dancing as fast as she can while a small herd of TV camera guys closes in. It doesn't look like fun.</p>
        <p>The woman does have a raucous side and an authentic subversive streak. In fact, after an often unfun childhood, she has been fairly determined in that way. She regularly skips functions that sound boring and once greeted a female acquaintance at a very fancy Washington party with an undecorous pinch on the bottom. Yet she is also darker, smarter, tougher, more difficult and more complicated than the goofy cardboard cutout she likes to hide behind. She is not just unpredictable -- the first word her oldest daughter, Karenna Gore Schiff, chooses to describe her -- but erratic: expansive one day and down the next. A friend who has worked closely with her on mental health issues says, ''She struggles with her mood, but she doesn't want to be pitied'' just because it is public knowledge that she became clinically depressed after her son was hit by a car in 1989. Like her husband, she has a mostly interior nature, and like him too, she is devoted to the kind of family life neither of them had as kids.

        <p>Tipper Gore hopped off a New Orleans streetcar and boogied her way through the crowd, shimmying all alone to the music of a Dixieland band. Wacky, fun-loving Tipper was at it again.

        <p>The woman does have a raucous side and an authentic subversive streak. In fact, after an often unfun childhood, she has been fairly determined in that way. She regularly skips functions that sound boring and once greeted a female acquaintance at a very fancy Washington party with an undecorous pinch on the bottom. Yet she is also darker, smarter, tougher, more difficult and more complicated than the goofy cardboard cutout she likes to hide behind. She is not just unpredictable -- the first word her oldest daughter, Karenna Gore Schiff, chooses to describe her -- but erratic: expansive one day and down the next. A friend who has worked closely with her on mental health issues says, ''She struggles with her mood, but she doesn't want to be pitied'' just because it is public knowledge that she became clinically depressed after her son was hit by a car in 1989. Like her husband, she has a mostly interior nature, and like him too, she is devoted to the kind of family life neither of them had as kids. And she is even more private and press-shy than he is, especially since being worked over for her mid-80's campaign against explicit rock lyrics.When the news photographers start clicking away, she often pulls out her own camera and shoots back.</p>
        <p>Sometimes she dances because she is not supposed to dance. ''It's a rebellion,'' says another friend. ''There are even these jerky movements sometimes, when she'll suddenly veer off to the side like she's suddenly said, 'No straight lines!''' At other times, though, according to this same friend, ''It's a distraction. It's, 'If I do this, maybe they'll pay attention to my jumping in the lake''' -- rather than to whatever is really going on with her that day.</p>
        <p>When the music finally ends in New Orleans, Tipper Gore stops laughing and faces the small crowd hesitantly. Standing up on the porch of the old house that is being turned into a campaign headquarters, she twists the toe of one shoe into the floor as if she would like to tunnel out of there and says just a few words, in a barely audible voice: ''I'm going to cut the ribbon so we can get to work. How's that?''</p>
        <p>Yet this, this is the Tipper Gore that the folks here have turned out to meet. The women -- and it is women, mostly -- who surround her at the little cake-and-tea reception that follows have either seen past all the light and motion or read it in a slightly different way. One of them remarks to a friend that there is no one else she would have waited two hours for, standing out in the hot sun.</p>
        <p>And why is that? I ask.</p>
        <p>''She's one of us,'' says the 37-year-old woman named Carlene Sikorsky. ''She sweats like the rest of us. I have some problems, but I can afford my treatment. She works for people who can't.''</p>
        <p>Even the Democratic Party chairman, Joe Andrew, suggests that this every-woman quality is part of Tipper's appeal: ''She gives a great speech because she doesn't give a great speech. She's a little nervous and a real person.''</p>
        <p>So is this another woman America loves in her weakness? Yes and no. You do see that when yet another fan on the campaign trail volunteers that she sure relates to the way Tipper's weight goes up and down. Which puts her whole defiant dance, her refusal to be pitied, in kind of a valiant light. And explains why she has never said much more about her depression than she did at the convention, that ''it was the hardest time in my life. I talked with Al, my friends and [a] mental health professional, and I realized I was suffering from clinical depression. I got help'' -therapy and medication -- and it worked.''</p>
        <p>But though her admirers can see that under all the whooping she is uncomfortable, they also appreciate that she gets up and does what she has to do anyway.</p>
        <p>When I sit down with her in her New York hotel, Gore seems relaxed, sinking back into the couch and altogether comfortable in a loose-fitting black jacket and pants. When I ask whether she lobbies her husband on the issues, she tosses back, ''Not my thing.'' The most important issues in the race to her, she says, are the Supreme Court and health care. ''I'm not trying to cover all my bases here. I know it's supposed to be education.'' Everything important is personal with her. Health care, for example, is something she came to care about through her 76-year-old mother, Margaret Carlson Aitcheson, who has had recurring bouts of depression and lives in the Gores' pool house at the vice-presidential residence.</p>
        <p>Mary Elizabeth Aitcheson, nicknamed Tipper after a song her mother liked, was only 14 months old when her parents divorced in 1949. In the papers they filed, her mother accused her husband, Jack Aitcheson, of beating her, and Aitcheson, who denied it, countered that she was ''of a nervous, volatile, flighty and erratic temperament'' and ''lacking in normal maternal instincts,'' because she was sometimes unable to get out of bed in the morning, even to take care of their baby.</p>
        <p>''My mother taught me about courage,'' Gore says with real pride. By which she means that her mother, who worked as an accountant, did the very best she could. There were good times -- times her mother took her to the symphony and to see ''The Seven-Year Itch'' on Broadway. ''Yet,'' Gore says, ''she also had the struggle of depression. She always wants me to say that, thank you very much, she did recover from it. I saw her rebuild time and time again. It was hard. They didn't have modern medication back then. But she didn't complain.'' And neither does her daughter.</p>
        <p>Did her mother talk to her about her illness? ''When she was able to,'' Gore says quietly. I tell her that when she talks about depression, it sounds nothing like the disease I'm pretty well acquainted with through a couple of people I love. She makes it sound so easy -- take a little something and boom, all's well. She doesn't argue, but says: ''My mission is to reach -- kind of like the presidential debates -- reach the maximum number I can and people who don't understand it at all. Particularly in the South, they believe you can pray your way out of it, or will your way out of it.''</p>
        <p>So, she says, she sticks to sound bites that emphasize that depression is a disease and that it can be treated. And steers away from her own experience? ''There are certain parameters for me to stay within so I'm not some sort of poster child,'' she says, pained, and looks away.</p>
        <p>Anyway, all that is behind her, she says, a late-breaking one-time problem that might not even have anything to do with her family history. She insists that her tentativeness in certain situations is receding, too: ''I think I'm getting less press-shy. It's kind of a natural response as a mother. It's protective.''</p>
        <p>Then I ask whether that same protectiveness accounts for her habit of turning her own camera on crowds or the press corps, and she gives a long, subtle answer that strikes me as both brave and poignant: ''It's only momentary; I don't have full protection. But what it does do is give me a way to do something I like to do in politics or at an official event. It's keeping a part of me separate from the campaign, still holding on to something that's me.''</p>
        <p>Backstage last month at Al Gore's glitzy Radio City Music Hall fund-raiser, just a couple of minutes before the vice president was scheduled to go on, he was still mulling what to say to the crowd. Joe Lieberman and his wife, Hadassah, were holding hands and chatting with Tipper while they all waited, just beyond the curtain. But Al Gore had a laptop set up on a small table only a couple of feet out of view of the audience, and he was busy editing his remarks with his speechwriter, Eli Attie. Intent, furiously chewing gum, repeatedly mopping his forehead, Gore called his wife over and ran several bits of the speech past her. She was just as serious and very animated as she reviewed the remarks, repeatedly shaking her head no and making chopping motions with her hands. He asked, she answered, he nodded. Then the speechwriter nodded in turn. In the darkness, which was broken only by the glow of the computer and the small penlight Gore was using to read some notes, the moment felt much more intimate than the long kiss they shared in front of the crowd at the Democratic convention.</p>
        <p>After the Gores walked out on stage, I asked Attie about the scene. He was startled that I had seen it, but answered: ''He was going over the whole thing with her, asking her should I say this, should I say that. She's a big reality check for him, and she was telling him to keep it short. She's the person he trusts more than anybody.''</p>
        <p>When Gore speaks of his wife, what comes through most clearly is his gratitude, his feeling that she rescued him emotionally and his appreciation for the price she paid to be the wife he needed her to be. Certainly, she never wanted the political life. And though she found work she cared about -- twice, in fact -- she never took her turn. First, she studied to become a therapist. Then, just as she was discovering her talent for photojournalism, her husband announced that he was running for Congress and needed a full-time partner. She gave up on some aspects of her college feminism many years ago, she says now, and no longer believes in having it all: ''You've got to have one strong person always there for the kids.'' Still, she tries to look at it like this: Hasn't she done more to destigmatize mental illness than she could ever have done in private practice?</p>
        <p>She does have Al, though -- and has since they met on the night of his senior prom, when she was 16 and he was 17. In between campaign stops in Ohio a couple of weeks ago, Gore told me that ''she brings excitement to my life that wouldn't be there otherwise. She sees things I don't see, understands things I don't understand. I've learned so much from her.''</p>
        <p>And he brings her?</p>
        <p>''An opportunity to use her expertise in psychology,'' he cracks.</p>
        <p>She does not tend to get involved in policy matters, beyond those issues she has worked on personally, like mental health and homelessness. Though she gives her husband credibility on the issue of pop-culture nastiness and vulgarity, for example, she is not driving the Gore-Lieberman ticket's criticisms of Hollywood. But she is plenty involved in personnel and, effectively, has veto power over all major appointments. She was party to both the hiring and the departure of Tony Coelho as Gore's campaign chairman.</p>
        <p>Gore's staff tends to steer clear of her, as a surprising number of his aides have remarked in passing over the last year. They see her as high-maintenance and hard to please -- as demanding as he is. The advice given one new hire in his office was this: When she calls, say yes and keep moving. She is not at all uptight in some ways. A former baby sitter who went on vacation with the Gores when their four children were young remembers being embarrassed by her frank references to their apparently robust sex life. ''I had never been around an adult who talked openly like that,'' said the woman, Karen Spears, who was 18 at the time. And the vice president's wife didn't consider it any big deal when she played matchmaker to her two hairdressers: conveniently for her, the guy who cuts her hair in New York and the guy who cuts her hair in Washington are a couple now.</p>
        <p>But she can be awfully proper too. During the Radio City fund-raiser, when Bette Midler repeated the vulgarity that George W. Bush had used to describe the Times reporter Adam Clymer, her jaw literally dropped. And she can come off as imperious. At the end of our first interview, I said I hoped we would be talking again soon, and she said, very slowly, drawing out each word, almost as if imitating some monarch, ''Yes, I've decided you're an O.K. sort. I've decided I will speak to you again.'' When next we met -- she and Karenna had invited me to a private lunch at the residence, just the three of us -- she was quite chilly, which was odd under the circumstances. Yet when I saw her again, only a few days later, she could not have been more effusive in her warmth.</p>
        <p>Karenna, the 27-year-old new lawyer, new mom and big-cheese adviser to her father, sits down for coffee in her neighborhood on Manhattan's Upper East Side and says: ''So, 'All About My Mother.' Great movie.'' The Tipper Gore she describes is ''kind of a hippie.'' But one with lots of rules. ''When I was little, we'd go on marches and boycott things all the time'' -- Nestle Quik, for example. ''Then there was the thing that I couldn't watch Mighty Mouse. To her, pictures of naked people weren't bad because that was natural, but Mighty Mouse was bad because the girl mouse was always screaming to be rescued. Mighty Mouse was this charged figure for me. The ultimate for me was to watch Mighty Mouse while drinking Nestle Quik and eating Wonder bread -- she was big on whole wheat too.''</p>
        <p>When the family first moved from Arlington, Va. -- and the house Tipper had grown up in -- into the vice-presidential residence, Karenna said: ''We were all kind of in a spoiled way grumpy about it. We wanted it to be like it was. 'Why do we have to have a staff? We want to make our own dinner.' Finally we realized we mostly were nostalgic about her doing a lot of housework.'' Neither of her parents ever pressured their kids, she said. But both ''were really into talking things out. We had to talk about everything.'' And when she got caught sneaking out and drinking in high school, ''I had to read a book about alcoholism'' -- Are You Dying for a Drink? Teenagers and Alcohol Abuse.''</p>
        <p>As anyone who saw Karenna nominate her father at the Democratic convention already knows, they are very close and mutually adoring. ''Growing up, I was a little more of a daddy's girl,'' she says. But since becoming a mother herself last year, ''lately I relate to my mom so much more and appreciate what she was up to when I was asking her if she had a real job and being a brat.'' Karenna sees the dynamic between her parents like this: ''There's a lot of energy between them because they're not on the same wavelength.'' But the real glue, she says, is that ''they had such a yearning for a home that was warm and loving.'' Looking to the future, Karenna says, her mother, at 52, is ''a little bit sad'' about her soon-to-be empty nest. Kristin, who is 23, is working in Los Angeles, Sarah is in her last year at Harvard and Albert -- Al to everyone outside the family -- is a senior in high school. ''She loves being a mom,'' Karenna says. ''She's so naturally maternal, and that's what she's best at and what makes her most happy.''</p>
        <p>Karenna's sister Kristin, a comedy writer for the animated TV show ''Futurama,'' recalls that as a child she was mortified by the way her parents carried on in public: ''I remember being embarrassed at how affectionate they were, and they'd be kissing in a restaurant or she'd sit on his lap when my friends were over.'' And since their big kiss in California, she hates all the talk about how her mom ''humanizes'' her dad. ''That's insulting both to her and to him,'' she says. ''She's not a tool, and he's very human.'' Karenna says that ''Kristin growing up was probably a lot closer to my mom.'' Kristin told me that her earliest childhood memories of her mother ''are of being on her hip in the darkroom'' the Gores had in their home in Arlington: ''I remember thinking she was this magician, conjuring up these images, and I remember the smell'' of the chemicals she used.</p>
        <p>Their old baby sitter, Karen Spears, says Tipper was the one who did most of the actual work of parenting, at least when Spears was working for them, early in Gore's Congressional career. ''Al was for fun, but Tipper was the one who had everything under control,'' she says. ''Even on vacation, I remember her shooing the kids away from him, saying he had been working so hard he needed a week to decompress before dealing with them.'' But Kristin goes even further: ''I remember a distinct difference before my brother's accident and after. He was gone a lot before, always working, and my mother was always around. I remember wanting to fake being sick, not to watch 'Dukes of Hazzard' or 'Wonder Woman' but to hang out with her.''</p>
        <p>Her parents were never big on socializing, and both made a point of really listening to their children, Kristin says, remembering how every one of her school reports for years and years was on the Beatles. ''So I'd give my parents the oral report: more facts about the Beatles. And they were always, 'Oh, great, honey.''' It was her mother, though, who took special care to listen to each one of them individually, even amid the chaos of carpooling.</p>
        <p>She would also treat each of her children to little adventures with her. By the sound of it, Tipper was glad to be getting another crack at a happy childhood, away from the pressures, in the refuge of her real life. ''I remember her waking me up at midnight in third grade because it had started to snow, and we got on our coats and walked through the neighborhood. 'Hopefully it will snow a lot,''' Kristin remembers her saying, ''and we can sled all day tomorrow.'''</p>
