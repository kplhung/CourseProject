        <p>AT Paper Mill Playhouse, ''Anything Goes'' might as well represent a flippant stage direction, or an arbitrary state of mind. But a focused representation of a musical perennial, it is not.</p>
        <p>Granted, the show's nutty story, with its hoary jokes and unhinged luxury-liner passengers provide the fixings for goofy fun. Hitting the deck most wackily are Billy, a stowaway stock broker, mistaken for a gangster, and Moonface Martin, a real ''public enemy.''</p>

        <p>AT Paper Mill Playhouse, ''Anything Goes'' might as well represent a flippant stage direction, or an arbitrary state of mind. But a focused representation of a musical perennial, it is not.</p>
        <p>Granted, the show's nutty story, with its hoary jokes and unhinged luxury-liner passengers provide the fixings for goofy fun. Hitting the deck most wackily are Billy, a stowaway stock broker, mistaken for a gangster, and Moonface Martin, a real ''public enemy.''</p>
        <p>The voyagers, in and out of disguise, also include a reluctant debutante named Hope; her dopey fiance, a Lord named Evelyn, and a lusty nightclub singer, Reno Sweeney.</p>
        <p>Reno gets a kick out of Billy and even sings ''I Get A Kick Out of You'' to him in a bar. But Billy gets on board to nab Hope. She gets a kick out of him, too. When things look glum, she sends a note: ''What good does love do when there is no hope? Love, Hope.''</p>
        <p>It's a good thing that Reno will take Evelyn, and does, when she's all dressed up as a geisha.</p>
        <p>It's all a carefree accompaniment to a fantastic voyage of an eternally fabulous score, which is the scattershot show's only reason to have endured more than six decades.</p>
        <p>But it takes ineffable flair and elegance to turn the wild and crazy into the wild and coherent.</p>
        <p>After its successful 1987 resurrection at Lincoln Center, the show toured with the renewed imprimatur of a modern-day Broadway hit.</p>
        <p>Oddly, the revitalizing elements of that restaging were its accent on youth and romance and a confident spin on old tricks for new audiences, not just die-hard nostalgists.</p>
        <p>Lee Roy Reams's staging does not follow that path of conceptual renewal. It is not acted, but self-consciously displayed as a series of personal appearances, song highlights and dance numbers (choreographed, some dreamily, by Michael Lichtefeld, though not as seamlessly as his dances in other productions).</p>
        <p>It is still hard to figure why some numbers are out and others are in, and just what they have to do with the plot or the characters. Yet, for all the daft plot's function as a series of arbitrary song cues, it is essential for the audience to believe that the performers believe in their characters, in their lines and in their lyrics.</p>
        <p>Only Bruce Adler has a hold of the antic humor and the old-time vaudeville style that defines his work. ''I'm a crook,'' he shrugs, and his bearing, his inflection, the sheer performing pleasure he imparts are lovely.</p>
        <p>Veteran and otherwise capable performers appear to be drifting along disconnectedly, or just showing off. Since George Dvorsky is an old hand at Billy, his blase manner might be simple burnout. Yet, there must be chemistry between him and Stacey Logan (Hope). The voices are swell; the rest is vacuous.</p>
        <p>If the musical comedy world is waiting to hear of Chita Rivera as Reno, no news is no news. A powerhouse performer of undiminished pizazz, Ms. Rivera vamps, wiggles and punctuates sexiness, but not the insouciance the part demands. She sings carefully, with no interpretive knack. She is choreographed carefully, executing every kick and spin with virtuosity and immense calculation. She smiles, incessantly, in a star turn that appears hell-bent on making hard work look spontaneous. This is an act, not by an actress but by a star and a survivor, who is playing to the audience every moment.</p>
        <p>Yet there is no denying the glaring fact that Ms. Rivera is miscast.</p>
        <p>Her formidable theater career has been mostly notable for dark roles, with edge: tough, dramatic, resilient women, starting with a street-smart girl, Anita in ''West Side Story,'' more than 40 years ago. Surveying the Rivera repertory, ''Chicago,'' ''Sweet Charity,'' ''The Rink,'' ''Kiss of the Spider Woman'' leap to mind, none lightweight.</p>
        <p>At the same time, she is an acclaimed performer in the Las Vegas-Atlantic City mode, which is the way she is doing, not playing, Reno.</p>
        <p>At Paper Mill, you won't be seeing Chita Rivera in ''Anything Goes.'' But you'll be getting two for the price of one: Chita Rivera and ''Anything Goes.'' A bargain at such a cost: double compromise.</p>
        <p>ANYTHING GOES</p>
        <p>Paper Mill Playhouse, Brookside Drive, Millburn.</p>
        <p>Through Oct. 15. Today and next Sunday at 2 p.m. and 7:30 p.m., Wednesday and Friday at 8 p.m., Thursday at 2 p.m. and 8 p.m., Saturday at 2:30 p.m. and 8 p.m.  (973) 376-4343.</p>
