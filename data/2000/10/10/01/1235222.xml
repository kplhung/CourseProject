        <p>The elusive aura of electoral inevitability once possessed by Gov. George W. Bush, and then captured for a time by Vice President Al Gore, has vanished from the presidential race. The latest polls show Mr. Bush ahead, Mr. Gore ahead or a tie. The only things that seem inevitable now are that the Election Day result will be close -- perhaps as narrow as the Kennedy-Nixon race of 1960 and the Ford-Carter race of 1976 -- and the series of presidential debates that begins Tuesday will be pivotal.

        <p>Since 1960, presidential debates have developed a reputation as gladiatorial contests that shaped the outcomes of elections and also offered a foretaste of how the winner turned out to govern. The easy smile and effortless way that Ronald Reagan glided past the contradictions of his positions come to mind. Many political experts at the time thought that Jimmy Carter won the debate with Mr. Reagan on the substance, just as many people thought that Richard Nixon out-pointed John F. Kennedy in 1960. The voters have sometimes been happy not to get bogged down in the expertise sweepstakes and instead made a judgment about whose character and vision they felt most comfortable with.

        <p>The elusive aura of electoral inevitability once possessed by Gov. George W. Bush, and then captured for a time by Vice President Al Gore, has vanished from the presidential race. The latest polls show Mr. Bush ahead, Mr. Gore ahead or a tie. The only things that seem inevitable now are that the Election Day result will be close -- perhaps as narrow as the Kennedy-Nixon race of 1960 and the Ford-Carter race of 1976 -- and the series of presidential debates that begins Tuesday will be pivotal. The swing voters are entering their decision phase.</p>
        <p>Since 1960, presidential debates have developed a reputation as gladiatorial contests that shaped the outcomes of elections and also offered a foretaste of how the winner turned out to govern. The easy smile and effortless way that Ronald Reagan glided past the contradictions of his positions come to mind. Many political experts at the time thought that Jimmy Carter won the debate with Mr. Reagan on the substance, just as many people thought that Richard Nixon out-pointed John F. Kennedy in 1960. The voters have sometimes been happy not to get bogged down in the expertise sweepstakes and instead made a judgment about whose character and vision they felt most comfortable with. So with as many as 90 million people expected to watch the debate, it is worth remembering that the commentators sounding off afterward may not have an immediate fix on the impressions solidifying in the public mind.</p>
        <p>These are lessons that Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore are no doubt studying hard this weekend as they prepare. On most issues, especially tax cuts, Social Security, Medicare and campaign finance reform, Mr. Gore continues to have positions with broader public support. The spurt in oil prices has exposed sharp differences between the candidates over Mr. Bush's proposal to open up wilderness areas to drilling and Mr. Gore's proposal to tap the strategic petroleum reserve. Here, too, the vice president would appear to benefit from the public's preference for environmental protection and lower fuel prices. The Food and Drug Administration's approval last week of an abortion-inducing pill is bound to come up in the debates, allowing Mr. Gore to solidify his lead among women by stressing his pro-choice position.</p>
        <p>For all that, Mr. Bush has recovered from the dive he took after the Democratic convention, and he is coming off a better couple of weeks than Mr. Gore. As was the case early in the campaign, Mr. Bush's personality seems to be offsetting his narrower issues base and Mr. Gore's advantage in expertise. A few weeks ago Mr. Bush said he would be focusing on issues more than character, but he seems to have picked up in the polls because of his genial style on television with the likes of Oprah Winfrey, Regis Philbin and Larry King. Part of his challenge is to bring that level of comfort into the auditorium in Boston on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>In the end, a mysterious mixture of issues, personalities and performance will flow into the public perception of who won the debates. In terms of performance, each side has its risk factors and its own version of the expectations game. The Gore team worries that Mr. Bush will get excessive credit for a merely competent performance. The Bush team hopes that Mr. Gore's strong debating skills will come across as more slashing and off-putting than masterly.</p>
        <p>For all the emphasis on video style, however, there is still a timeless quality to these confrontations. For several decades, American television audiences have been watching presidential candidates argue over how best to preserve and adjust the basic programs of the New Deal and the Great Society, whether to cut taxes, how to keep up defenses. These were issues voiced as early 1948 and even 1900. But the game really changed with television and the popularity of the 1960 debates. Now, in 2000, the demand we place on candidates has become a daunting one. Each man must sell himself as the better custodian of past gains, the better guide to the future and, into the bargain, the more likable fellow.</p>
