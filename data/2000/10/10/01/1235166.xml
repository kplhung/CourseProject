      <block class="full_text">
        <p>WHEN it rains on one, it pours on us all.''</p>
        <p>Greg Wolf likes to apply this more-the-merrier philosophy to the coffee and tea business in New York. And perhaps in a Zen world, the two beverages would complement each other, rather than compete.</p>
        <p>In July, though, Mr. Wolf and his business partner, Vardi Moscovitch, bought out a coffeehouse in Park Slope and converted it into a tea bar with terra-cotta-colored walls, leather sofas and shelves of black tea canisters.</p>
        <p>He is, after all, in the business of tea. So while coffee may be king in this Starbucks of a city, tea now owns the corner of Seventh Avenue and 10th Street in Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>''The tea culture is much richer than anything coffee can offer,'' Mr. Wolf said while sitting in his Tea Lounge, which is to open this week. ''The corporate world is taking over coffee, but locals are taking over tea.''</p>
        <p>This is not a story about tea's popularity. That story has been told. People have been drinking tea in China for 5,000 years and in New York since it was a Dutch colony. But early New Yorkers also drank coffee, lots of it, and today the city percolates with coffee shops, coffee bars and coffee kiosks.</p>
        <p>Take a look around, though, because the business of tea is changing, doubling in the last decade from $2 billion to $4 billion in the United States, according to the Tea Council, which keeps tabs on the industry. In New York, tea bars and tea salons are sprouting up, sometimes in the place of coffeehouses. Hotels and supermarkets are scrambling to offer wide varieties of tea. There are tea chains now, and tea sommeliers. A pound of tea can sell for $165, but a cup can still be bought for $1.</p>
        <p>Just as the American espresso bar spruced up coffee 20 years ago, tea is going gourmet while also marketing itself as hip and profitable. Its gains over coffee may still be small, but they are strategic.</p>
        <p>All this makes Mr. Wolf happy to be in the tea business. He doesn't need leaves to tell him his timing, and prospects, are good.</p>
        <p>When his mentor, Miriam Novalle, opened the city's first tearoom eight years ago, many people thought she was taking too big a risk. What did a perfume maker know about running a 6,000-square-foot tearoom in the basement of the Guggenheim Museum branch in SoHo?</p>
        <p>Plenty, it turns out. Today, Ms. Novalle is widely known as the city's tea guru, hand-blending 435 tea varieties, supplying tea to 450 local restaurants, and serving tea to everyone from the Dalai Lama to Susan Sarandon, all from within her cozy T Salon and T Emporium. The business moved to East 20th Street three years ago.</p>
        <p>''You don't see the Dalai Lama drinking cappuccino,'' she said of tea's recent upswing. ''Players in the world of enlightenment don't go to coffee shops. They go to tea bars. So we're starting to see a shift in consciousness. When people think of something endearing or evolutionary, they think of tea.''</p>
        <p>Tea shop owners are also sensing that educated tea drinkers will pay premium prices. At T Salon, a pound of green oolong Namasta tea sells for $160. At Ten Ren Tea  and Ginseng Company, another longtime New York business, a pound of green oolong sells for $125. ''We are also pioneers in New York,'' said Ellen Lii, whose Ten Ren company also owns stores in Chinatown, Flushing and Sunset Park. ''When we started, people would say: 'How could you ask so much for tea? You must sell gold.' But today, they are not surprised. They say, 'Oh, you sell good tea.' ''</p>
        <p>Tea is also learning accessibility. Coffee chains have long dominated their market by setting up shop on every street corner and offering an alluring mixture of convenience and cool. Tea salons, meanwhile, tucked away their product in dainty afternoon ceremonies in back rooms where few but the doilied could sample its varieties. Even in Asian societies, tea is often treated as sacred.</p>
        <p>When Bruce J. Fernie, a founder of the  Tealuxe Company in Boston, went into the tea business four years ago, he decided to free tea of its raised pinkie stigma. He opened his first tea bar in Harvard Square, where bar stools, trendy light fixtures and navy walls appealed to the Cambridge crowd. So did his 150 bins of loose tea and his line of merchandise with logos, including T-shirts bearing phrases like ''The Only Legal Pot in Harvard Square.''</p>
        <p>''For so long, tea has been seen as something you drink when you're sick or visiting your grandmother,'' Mr. Fernie said. ''So we worked really hard to make people comfortable. Now, we've got old ladies with blue hair one moment and students with blue hair the next. It's weird, but it's cool.''</p>
        <p>In July, he took Tealuxe to Morningside Heights, across the street from Columbia University. In August, he opened another tea bar in the Citicorp Center on East 53rd Street, and he plans to open three more this year. His Columbia outlet is two doors down from a coffee bar, which once would have bothered him. Now he's fine with it.</p>
        <p>FOR years, business people thought there was no profit to be made in tea, said Joe Simrany, president of the Tea Council. Hotels, restaurants and food markets ignored specialty tea. Brewing temperatures, steeping times, it was too much bother when people were satisfied with a bag of Lipton's. But companies have started looking fondly at the profit potential and cachet that comes with high-end teas. In New York, the Hotel W employs a full-time tea sommelier.</p>
        <p>Whole Foods Market is building a 37,000-square-foot store at Seventh Avenue and 24th Street in Chelsea, and the natural foods store chain has decided a coffee bar will not be enough. It is adding a tea salon. David Lannon, the store's vice president, said the tea counter should pay off because tea sells well and is healthier than coffee.</p>
        <p>''Coffee is still a much bigger chunk of the pie, but people are changing,'' Mr. Lannon said. ''They are not exclusive coffee or tea drinkers anymore. Maybe we can get them a cup of coffee in the morning and a cup of tea in the afternoon.''</p>
        <p>At the Tea Lounge in Park Slope, Mr. Moscovitch and Mr. Wolf said they would not mind if their patrons asked for a cup of joe. But standing now amid the sawdust and tiles of their new business, Mr. Wolf hopes the neighborhood will be so busy falling in love with tea, it will not even miss the coffee shop that came before.</p>
        <p>''This community knows a lot more about wine, beer and coffee than they do about tea,'' he said, grinning. ''But wait until we get done with them.''</p>
