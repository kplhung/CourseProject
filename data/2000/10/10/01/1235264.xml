        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In ''Is the No. 7 a Good Line? Or Poor? It All Depends'' (Sept. 10), the Flushing line is overrated by the Straphangers Campaign because they evaluated two services (the No. 7 Express and No. 7 Local) as if they were one service. Once you measure them separately (as you would, say, the A express and the C local), their scheduled peak service (and, hence, their ratings) are not as good.</p>

        <p>What lowers the rating even more is that the combined express and local service is now at about three-quarters of capacity. Forty years ago, the peak combined service on the Flushing line was 36 trains per hour (1 minute, 40 second spacing).</p>
