        <p>THINK of jail, and a vivid image comes to mind of surly convicts clad in black-and-white striped uniforms. Yet those distinctive outfits, a staple of Jimmy Cagney movies and Halloween parties, are actually relics of a time that had vanished with the ball and chain.</p>
        <p>But not anymore.</p>
        <p>Dozens of county sheriffs, in states as diverse as Texas, Indiana, Nebraska, Florida and Maine, are  putting their inmates back in stripes. The Mississippi Department of Corrections has been using striped trousers for more than five years (green-on-white for minimum-security convicts, black for medium, and red for maximum). The zebra look has even arrived in juvenile detention centers in Massachusetts and Missouri.</p>
        <p>The most frequently cited reason is that the bright, solid-colored jumpsuits that have been an industry standard for decades can cause confusion. If felons who wear such uniforms escape, citizens may mistake them for sanitation, utility or highway workers.</p>
        <p>''I've been in the department for 27 years and I've seen a whole lot of escapes,'' said Duane Kaley, sheriff of Portage County, Ohio, which brought back stripes about three years ago. ''The likelihood of recovering someone in stripes is 100 percent better than if they're not. It turns the public into one heck of an eye for us.''</p>
        <p>But another, more controversial, function of stripes is to send a powerful message when an arrest is made.</p>
        <p>''It's a media event for the local sheriff's department,'' said Bob Barker, president of the Bob Barker Company of Fuquay Varina, N.C., the nation's leading prison-supplies firm. ''They call in the TV cameras and they make a big to-do about it. It shows the sheriff is tough on crime.''</p>
        <p>One sheriff, Gerald Hege of Davidson County, N.C., noted that in 1994 he won election by 227 votes. Then he clad his inmates in stripes. At his next election, he won by 5,000 votes, though he spent only $15,000 to his opponent's $100,000. ''The public loves them,'' he said of stripes.</p>
        <p>Some criminologists, though, are uneasy. ''Should prisoners be uniformed?'' said Charles M. Friel, a professor at the College of Criminal Justice at Sam Houston State University in Huntsville, Tex. ''Yes, and I think schoolchildren should wear uniforms, too. Should uniforms be the wrong size or an unusual color for the sake of putting your foot on somebody's neck? No, I think that's being a bully.''</p>
        <p>That's why most correctional facilities in this country did away with stripes by the 1940's and 50's, substituting nondescript denims or the familiar Day-Glo jumpsuits. New York State discarded stripes in 1904, at the height of the Progressive era; the superintendent of prisons called them a ''badge of disgrace.''</p>
        <p>But today, stripes are of a piece with the increasingly popular ''no frills'' prison movement. The idea is that convicts should have to work for the kinds of amenities -- television, weight rooms, conjugal visits -- that reform-minded penologists introduced a generation ago in response to calls for prisoners' rights. No-frills, which depending on one's definition also encompasses chain gangs (even for women) and boot camps, is a return to a more punitive penal age.</p>
        <p>''There are cycles in this stuff,'' said Larry Sullivan, chief librarian of the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in Manhattan and the author of ''The Prison Reform Movement: Forlorn Hope'' (Twayne, 1990).  ''The Supreme Court has said that inconvenience and discomfort in prisons is not a constitutional violation -- that if you're tough, that's fine. You're taking away a certain measure of any kind of dignity that prisoners have left when you put them in this kind of clothing.  You're humiliating them.''</p>
        <p>There may be a middle ground. Last year, the Michigan Legislature stopped state prisoners from wearing street clothes, as they had been allowed to for more than two decades. They now wear dark blue uniforms with a single orange stripe running down each leg and arm. Lawmakers consider the new outfits to be functional and identifiable, but not overly oppressive.  ''Horizontal stripes are to prison uniforms what 'The Shawshank Redemption' is to prisons,'' said Matt Davis, a spokesman for the Michigan Department of Corrections. ''They're a Hollywood fantasy at best. They're not what we view in a modern correctional sense.''</p>
        <p>But others feel that even stripes are not enough.  Sheriff Joe Arpaio, of Maricopa County, Ariz., who has earned a controversial reputation for Draconian measures like forcing inmates -- male, female and juvenile --  to wear pink underwear. Earlier this year, after a convicted killer and her cellmate escaped briefly, Sheriff Arpaio ordered convicts to stencil the word ''ESCAPEE'' in large red letters on the insides of their striped uniforms, in case they escaped and then tried to evade capture by turning the garments inside out.</p>
        <p>Professor Friel feels that such tactics miss a bigger  point. ''If you've got enough escapees to the point where you have to spray-paint them green,'' he said, ''then you should indict the sheriff for malfeasance.''</p>
