        <p>''This is the time of year that rats and mice start looking for warmth, food and shelter,'' said Arthur Katz, president of Knockout Pest Control in Uniondale, N.Y.

        <p>THEY don't write, they don't call, and they don't wait for an invitation to make themselves comfortable in your home.</p>
        <p>''This is the time of year that rats and mice start looking for warmth, food and shelter,'' said Arthur Katz, president of Knockout Pest Control in Uniondale, N.Y. ''And even the most expensive homes in the best neighborhoods have them. Both rats and mice are common, not only in urban areas, but in the suburbs, too. I know of mansions on Long Island that have rat problems.''</p>
        <p>While it is impossible to say with any certainty whether the area's rodent population is higher than normal -- official figures are not compiled -- anecdotal reports from pest control experts, along with published reports of rats seen scurrying across the steps of Gracie Mansion this summer, seem to support that perception.</p>
        <p>Here, then, are some tips for keeping these uninvited guests out of your house or apartment.</p>
        <p>''The name of the game is prevention,'' said Jerry Quinlan, an entomologist for Assured Environments, a pest control company in Manhattan. ''A mouse only needs an opening of a quarter of an inch or so to get into your house. So you want to seal up the most common entry points.''</p>
        <p>Such points include areas where pipes, wires or cables enter the house and spaces around doors and door frames.</p>
        <p>''The most common entry point is at the base of exterior doors and garage doors,'' he said, pointing out that weatherstripping on such doors should be replaced if any gap is present.</p>
        <p>''If you're inside the house or garage and can see light coming through under the door, a mouse can probably get through too,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Quinlan added that it is also important to avoid attracting rodents to the house itself. ''The area around the house should be clean and free of debris,'' he said. ''And garbage cans should always be covered.''</p>
        <p>And while those who live in apartment buildings have less control over the entry of mice and rats into the building itself, Mr. Quinlan said, they can make it less likely that rodents will infiltrate their apartments.</p>
        <p>''All penetrations into the apartment must be sealed,'' he said, referring to the holes in walls and floors where heating and plumbing pipes enter the apartment. ''We seal around all penetrations with copper mesh,'' Mr. Quinlan said. ''It's coarser than steel wool, and it doesn't rust.''</p>
        <p>What does one do, though, when attempts at interdiction have failed?</p>
        <p>''There are a variety of methods for getting rid of rodents once they're in your home or apartment,'' said Mr. Katz of Knockout Pest Control. Generally speaking, he said, the methods fall into two broad categories: traps that capture the pests and chemicals that kill them.</p>
        <p>''One of the first things we use are glue boards,'' he said, referring to rectangular pieces of cardboard that are coated with glue and placed alongside walls where mice navigate.</p>
        <p>While glue boards are effective, inexpensive and nontoxic, Mr. Katz said, some people prefer not to use them because of the suffering they cause for the trapped rodent. For such people, he said, an alternative method of extermination is provided by mechanical traps. ''The snap trap is the most common,'' he said, referring to the traditional wood and metal-spring device that dispatches its victims quite quickly and effectively. (While cheese is depicted as the bait of choice in cartoons, mice seem to prefer sweets like chocolate and peanut butter.)</p>
        <p>The problem with snap traps, however, is that since they do not discriminate between rodents and curious pets or children, they should be used only in places where cats, dogs and young children cannot go.</p>
        <p>Another way to rid a house or apartment of resident rodents, Mr. Katz said, is with live trapping.</p>
        <p>''There are a variety of traps that will catch a mouse without killing it,'' he said, referring to devices that range from single-occupancy plastic traps that shut tight when a mouse enters to multiple-occupancy steel cages that can hold entire families of rodents. ''The problem with live traps is that you have to do something with the mice you catch,'' he said, adding that while professionals have no qualms about doing whatever is necessary to ensure that caught rodents  are put out of commission for good, compassionate homeowners often merely release their captives outdoors, thereby setting the stage for a potential reoccupation.</p>
        <p>For those who prefer a more passive approach to pest control, poison-baiting might be the weapon of choice.</p>
        <p>''Baiting works really well if you can follow instructions and have a little patience,'' said Greg Zarek, service manager for Metro Pest Control in Woodside, Queens.</p>
        <p>Most rodenticide baits, Mr. Zarek said, are fairly slow-acting, thereby giving the animal time to take some of the bait back to the nest and share the bounty with family members.</p>
        <p>''That's why you might want to avoid using traps and bait at the same time,'' he said, explaining that while a trap might eliminate one mouse on its way back to the nest, a rodent with a jaw full of bait to be shared could eliminate an entire nest.</p>
        <p>''You also want to make sure that you put the bait where you see rodent activity, but not where there are any children or pets,'' he said, adding that bait sold in tamper-resistant packaging is safer that loose pellets or solid baits.</p>
        <p>Another poison that can be used relatively safely is ''tracking powder.'' That is a rodenticide that is injected through holes drilled into wall cavities where rodent traffic is suspected. Mice traveling through the treated area get the powder on their fur and feet and then lick it off -- and ingest it -- when they clean themselves.</p>
        <p>There are, of course, always those who claim to have discovered an even better mousetrap.</p>
        <p>''The most effective traps that we sell are the Rat Zapper and Big Bertha,'' said Chad Gros, vice president of U-Spray, an Internet-based pesticide distributor in Liburn, Ga.</p>
        <p>The Rat Zapper, Mr. Gros explained, is an enclosed rectangular trap that has a floor consisting of two metal plates. The plates are each connected to a capacitor -- a device that stores electrical energy -- that is charged by four AA batteries. ''When a rat or a mouse walks in, he shorts out the plates and gets zapped by the energy stored in the capacitor,'' he said, explaining that a homeowner can get ''10 or 12 kills'' from one set of batteries. ''This is considered a pretty humane way of dispatching mice and rats,'' Mr. Gros said, adding that Big Bertha, which uses four D cells as a power source, can increase the number to more than 100.</p>
        <p>The products, which sell for $49.95 and $89.95 respectively, can be ordered from U-Spray's Web site at www.bugspray.com.</p>
