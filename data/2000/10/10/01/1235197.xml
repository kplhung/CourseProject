        <p>PAUL J. FROMMERT, 61, works for Xerox as a quality and safety manager in Webster, N.Y. He has been with the company for 36 years. His retirement account is worth about $1 million and should provide him with a retirement income of about $5,000 a month.</p>
        <p>Or so he thought.</p>
        <p>About five years ago, said Mr. Frommert, who had been looking forward to retiring in 2001, he noticed a reference in his Xerox retirement fund statement to ''prior distribution.'' He didn't understand it and started asking about it.</p>
        <p>His questions led to the discovery that instead of the $5,000 a month he had been counting on at age 62, he would actually get less than $20, because of the curious way Xerox took account of a break in service, from 1985 to 1989, when he left to start his own business.</p>
        <p>When he left in 1985, Mr. Frommert said, Xerox required him to withdraw the pension fund balance -- then about $140,000 -- that he had accumulated since 1960. Under the Employment Retirement Income Security Act, or Erisa, returning employees must be given credit for previous years of service or be allowed to buy them back. So when he was rehired in 1989, he was given retirement credit for his first 25 years, and he said Xerox led him to believe that it would somehow deduct the $140,000 already paid to him when it came time to calculate his pension.</p>
        <p>What Mr. Frommert says he wasn't told -- and didn't find out until five years ago -- is that Xerox makes such deductions in a way that would all but obliterate his benefits.</p>
        <p>Xerox created a ''phantom'' account, pretending that it contained the $140,000 Mr. Frommert had been paid, and had it ''grow'' on paper as if it had been invested over the years. At retirement, the ''phantom'' account would be deducted from the real one.</p>
        <p>Unlike the real pension money, though, the phantom account was considered to have been placed in a very aggressive stock fund, growing at an estimated rate of 22 percent a year, retroactive to 1985. At that rate, the phantom account has been steadily catching up with Mr. Frommert's real account, which is based simply on years of service and age,  to the point that it is now just a few thousand dollars behind. Subtract one from the other, and voila, a $20 monthly pension.</p>
        <p>Because he had not been told what was going on, Mr. Frommert said, he asked Xerox to calculate his pension more realistically -- but to no avail. He said he even offered to surrender his previous years of service and accept only the benefits accumulated since he came back in 1989, as if he had been a new hire. Still, he said, the company said no.</p>
        <p>Last November, Mr. Frommert sued Xerox in Federal District Court in New Haven, seeking a pension unravaged by the phantom account.  ''I'm in a pickle,'' he said. ''I have an 11-year-old son. I'm going to have to continue working if this suit isn't resolved in my favor.''</p>
        <p>A spokesman for Xerox, which is based in Stamford, Conn., said the company would not comment on pending litigation.</p>
        <p>Since last November, 40 more rehired Xerox employees have joined the suit. Mr. Frommert and the plaintiffs' lawyer, Robert H. Jaffe, estimate that up to 1,500 of Xerox's 53,250 domestic employees could unwittingly be in the same pickle.</p>
        <p>Alan H. Clair, 57, another plaintiff, said he loves working for Xerox but called the pension predicament ''gut-wrenching.'' He added, ''With one hand, Xerox credited us with our previous service; then with another, invisible, hand, they took it away.''</p>
        <p>The situation provides a lesson in the importance of knowing all the ins and outs of your company retirement account, especially if you have been rehired after quitting or retiring. But because both the laws and companies' policies can be blindingly complex, and sometimes misleading, it is not always easy.</p>
        <p>Norman Stein, a professor of pension law at the University of Alabama, says that any changes made in pension plans during the last decade have probably hurt employees.</p>
        <p>He is especially critical of so-called cash-balance plans, which many companies are adopting. In a traditional plan, benefits based on a combination of age and service build  sharply toward the end of an employee's career; in a cash-balance plan, benefits build uniformly each year.</p>
        <p>''Most cash-balance plans have been designed to hurt older employees,'' he said. So after years of having ''a plan that is not good for young people when they're young, when they get older they get a plan that's not good for older people,'' he said. ''And companies are often cleverly misleading about this.''</p>
        <p>Professor Stein said there has been a shift in corporate attitudes toward pension plans since the mid-1980's, partly because any excess money in them can now be added to a company's operating profit. ''It used to be that pension plans were viewed as belonging to the people covered by them,'' he said. ''The new ideology is that this money belongs to the company and its stockholders, or its management. If the employees want it, there has to be warfare for them to get it. This has had a devastating effect on retirement policy.''</p>
        <p>He doesn't need to tell that to Mr. Frommert.</p>
