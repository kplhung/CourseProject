        <p>I'D heard that Las Vegas had gone upscale, but I wanted to see for myself. I liked it the old way: gaudy and like nowhere else in the world.

I wanted to see if Las Vegas had lost its sense of itself.</p>
        <p>I also wanted to say goodbye to a classy old hotel on the day in late August when it closed forever.

        <p>I'D heard that Las Vegas had gone upscale, but I wanted to see for myself. I liked it the old way: gaudy and like nowhere else in the world. Now it seems as if each huge new resort deliberately mimics some other place, wrapping itself in the veneer of an older, more elegant culture: Egypt of the pharaohs, Venice of the doges, Paris, even New York. I wanted to see if Las Vegas had lost its sense of itself.</p>
        <p>I also wanted to say goodbye to a classy old hotel on the day in late August when it closed forever. In 1950, the Desert Inn was the fifth property to open on the two-lane highway that would become the Strip. Howard Hughes bought the hotel one New Year's Eve when the management asked him to leave his penthouse to make way for high rollers.</p>
        <p>Now a more extroverted billionaire, Steve Wynn, will implode the icon and build a towering new Desert Inn on the vast scale of the Aladdin, Bellagio, the Venetian, Paris Las Vegas and Luxor -- massive new resorts borrowing from cultures from all over the world. High rollers are having their day.</p>
        <p>I am an indifferent gambler but an enthusiastic tourist with a fondness for camp and glitter. I've always been able to have a fine time in Las Vegas without breaking the bank (mine or the casinos'), and I bet I still could. For this spur-of-the-moment trip, from a Sunday morning to a Tuesday afternoon, I budgeted $300 (without the cost of getting there). I just wanted to explore the hyper new versions of Paris, Venice and a Lake Como villa. I didn't need to stay in one.</p>
        <p>Until recently, casino hotels would undercharge for rooms and food, figuring low rates and cheap buffets would keep guests at their slot machines and gambling tables.  Calling at the last minute from Tucson, I couldn't find any of those low room rates. In fact, I couldn't find anything under $150.  Finally I fell back on advice from an acquaintance who lives in Las Vegas: there's usually a cheap room at the Maxim.</p>
        <p>I couldn't find the Maxim in my guidebooks, but the address was on Flamingo Road, just off the Strip and across from Bally's. I called. I could have a double for $59. I booked it. If it had clean sheets, hot water, air-conditioning and enough light to read by, it would be fine for one night.</p>
        <p>I didn't want to rent a car, even though a half-dozen national and local firms offered automatic economy cars for daily rates under $20. I tend to be a poor navigator and easily distracted behind the wheel, and Las Vegas Boulevard South -- the Strip -- is 10 lanes wide and lined with world-class diversions. I chose public transport.</p>
        <p>On the 15-minute shuttle ride from McCarran International Airport to the Strip ($4), my seat companion mentioned that she would be paying half-price for two days at Bellagio, and her room would be ''comped'' (complimentary) for two days at the Mirage. On a convention weekend!</p>
        <p>''Join the slot clubs,'' she advised. All the big hotels have some incentive program to encourage bettors to stay. They issue membership cards with a magnetic strip that records either time or money spent gambling there, and your name goes on their mailing list for discount newsletters.</p>
        <p>''How much do you actually gamble there?'' I asked.</p>
        <p>''Oh, I probably play for six or seven hours a day, but not in one place,'' she said.</p>
        <p>''Do you always win?''</p>
        <p>''Honey, nobody always wins.''</p>
        <p>The Maxim looked like a hotel that has seen better days. The casino is gone. Not even a slot machine graces the vast, rather grim expanse before the registration desk. Nevertheless, it seemed to be packing in the tour groups. My room would not be ready before 3 p.m., I was told, so I checked my bag in the luggage room and headed for the glitter.</p>
        <p>Aladdin, Las Vegas's newest megaresort, added 2,567 rooms to the city's inventory when it reopened on Aug. 17. On the site of the original Aladdin, which opened in 1966 and was demolished in 1998, spires and onion domes once more speak of a thousand and one nights, but the big hype is about Desert Passage.</p>
        <p>This vast mall wraps the entire lower level of the resort. Its roster includes about 130 shops and 20 restaurants scattered along various ''trade routes'' to mysterious destinations with names like Dome of the Spirits. Casbahs abound. Young women in harem pants perch on silk pillows to offer temporary henna tattoos ($15). At the North African harbor, a 155-foot merchant trader rises and falls on the tide as fog and scattered rain blow through. ''Experience retail'' is the concept, and it's surreal. Too hungry to endure the long line for the Spice Market buffet in the Aladdin, I headed for Paris, across the street, to look for good food. I found it.</p>
        <p>Behind a 50-story (half-size) Eiffel Tower, Paris Las Vegas clusters replicas of the Arc de Triomphe, the Louvre, the Opera, and the Hotel de Ville. Inside, it's the Latin Quarter in the 1920's. The streetscapes are lined with bistros, boulangeries and patisseries, shops with cheeses, sausages, pates and wines. I grazed. A rather large lunch, with two trips to the patisserie, came to $10.99.</p>
        <p>FORTIFIED, I wandered into the casino, where I laughed with delight. Three legs of the Eiffel Tower plunge through the 40-foot ceiling, and the Seine wanders through, lined with wrought-iron street lamps and bridged by the lovely Pont Alexandre III. It's all maniacally authentic -- even the rivets in the tower are said to duplicate the originals -- but sublimely irrelevant to the oblivious gamblers.</p>
        <p>I snagged another apple tartine ($2.75) and walked back to the Maxim to check in. Despite my misgivings, the room was fine, if characterless. It had a good bed (king size) and met all my other requirements. Phone calls cost $1, however.</p>
        <p>Still stuffed with French pastry, I skipped dinner to take in Cirque du Soleil's 7:30 p.m. performance of ''Mystere'' at Treasure Island. This was my splurge. I got one of the last seats in the house for $75, more than I would have paid to see Steve Lawrence and Eydie Gorme at Caesars Palace ($55), but less than Siegfried &amp; Roy at the Mirage ($95). It was definitely worth it.</p>
        <p>After the performance, I found a good place on the plank bridge outside Treasure Island to wait for the sea battle. Every night, at 90-minute intervals, a reproduction of the British frigate Britannia attacks the Hispaniola, a pirate ship plying the blocklong depiction of Robert Louis Stevenson's Buccaneer Bay. Pirates and naval officers exchange cheesy B-movie dialogue and realistic cannon fire, with flaming explosions so fierce I felt the heat on my face. After a lot of good-natured swashbuckling and scary stunt dives, the frigate slowly slips under the waves. Pirates and audience rejoice. It took eight minutes to sink the Britannia and a half-hour for the crowd to disperse. But it was fun and free.</p>
        <p>I was tired, but I couldn't stop neon-gazing along the Strip. I watched the volcano erupt at the Mirage and the waters dance from more than 1,200 choreographed fountainheads at Bellagio. Finally I walked back to the Maxim, vowing tomorrow I'd take the bus. With the show ticket, I'd spent about $165.</p>
        <p>On Monday morning I moved to La Concha, a funky 50's-style motel right on the Strip next to the Riviera. In the hallway on my floor, the carpet rippled and somebody had systematically added pince-nez and Vandykes to the Restoration-style figures stenciled on the walls, but my $48 room had some nice touches. The king-size bed had an upholstered headboard. White wrought-iron vines surrounded the vanity outside the bathroom and framed a full-length mirror in the bedroom. The frayed carpet had been neatly repaired with duct tape, and local calls were free.</p>
        <p>Public buses turned out to be ideal transport for my needs. The No. 301 runs along the Strip regularly. The fare on that route is $2 and transfers are free. So is the entertainment. On my first ride, the driver rapped on the window of a stretch limo that pulled up next to the bus at a light.  When the tinted window glided down, the bus driver leaned out: ''Do you have any Grey Poupon?''</p>
        <p>At the Mirage, the Secret Garden of Siegfried &amp; Roy is a little jewel of a zoo with the white tigers and lions that appear (and disappear) in the illusionists' show. The garden is very small, but the magnificent rare creatures seemed content to wrestle in a desultory fashion and paddle in their pool. Behind the garden at the Dolphin Habitat (included in the $10 admission fee), cackling cetaceans tossed a beach ball back and forth with visitors. The breeding program that produced them at the Mirage is  highly successful, but the guide's perky spiel about it struck me as pure Las Vegas. ''Nothing in this habitat is natural,'' she assured us. ''The coral reef is entirely artificial.'' Even the 2.5 million gallons of seawater are man-made. Still, the animals provide a transcendent respite from humanity in this town.</p>
        <p>After a quick lunch at the generic casino buffet at the Mirage ($9.95), I crossed the street to the Venetian for a free roulette lesson. Here the landmarks are full-size: the Doges' Palace, the Campanile, the Ca' d'Oro, the Rialto Bridge. At the foot of Piazza San Marco, strapping gondoliers in tight shirts and red bandannas belt ''O Sole Mio'' as they pole tourists under the Bridge of Sighs ($10 a person for about 15 minutes).</p>
        <p>It's another example of crackpot authenticity: The boats were made by the oldest gondola firm in Venice, for a Grand Canal 36 inches deep.</p>
        <p>READY for a dose of culture, I headed for the Liberace Museum.  (People who want real culture should vacation in the real Venice.) A couple of miles from the Strip on Tropicana Avenue ($1.25 on bus No. 201), the shrine to Mr. Showmanship raises funds for  Liberace's scholarship foundation. Exhibits include 14 of his pianos -- a French Pleyel played by Chopin and Liberace's favorite Baldwin concert grand, the one covered with thousands of etched mirror tiles. A row of  fabulous glittering vehicles recalls his grand entrances. He would roll onstage in a 1962 Rolls-Royce clad in etched mirror tiles, to match his piano. I coveted that Rolls.</p>
        <p>The costumes are equally dazzling. According to the printed guide, seamstresses would wear dark glasses to protect their eyes from the glare of beads and rhinestones on his capes, sewing as many as 100,000 on one garment. One rhinestone rests in a place of honor. Weighing more than 50 pounds, the 115,000-carat Austrian sparkler was a gift from an understandably grateful industry.</p>
        <p>This summer the Liberace Museum opened a new gallery for changing exhibitions about the arts and popular culture. It's included in the $6.95 admission. I spent a happy hour there, immersed in the displays and video clips of ''Red, Hot &amp; Blue,'' the Smithsonian's traveling salute to American musicals (which has since departed). There's really nothing like a little Busby Berkeley to top off a lot of Liberace.</p>
        <p>I spent the evening downtown, at the sanitized pedestrian mall called the Fremont Street Experience. The highlight was an excellent grilled salmon dinner ($8.95) at the Triple 7 restaurant and brewery at Main Street Station. Including motel, meals, admissions, buses, tips, souvenirs and a couple of microbrews, I'd spent a little over $110 for a day packed with entertainment.</p>
        <p>Late Tuesday morning, I took a taxi to Bellagio ($8) and checked my bag at the outdoor luggage kiosk to be collected later, on the way to the airport. Unencumbered, I treated myself to a degenerate breakfast  buffet. At $10.95 it is very pricey for a Las Vegas breakfast buffet, but the flatware is heavy, the napkins vast and crisp, and the presentation of dozens of dishes is drop-dead elegant. One guest was actually videotaping the steam tables, particularly such unusual breakfast fare as pork loin with mushrooms and spicy udon noodles with scallops and jellyfish.</p>
        <p>I had arranged to meet the free Elvis-a-Rama Museum shuttle, but we never connected and I had to go home without sighting a single Elvis. Even so, I went home reassured. There's no identity crisis in Las Vegas. In its heart of hearts, glittering excess reigns.</p>
        <p>Bottom line: a can't-lose approach (don't gamble)</p>
        <p>Including taxes, tips and miscellaneous expenses, my two-night Las Vegas trip cost $316.24, or $158.12 a night. Round-trip air fare from Tucson, Ariz., on Southwest Airlines (I paid $181, the full fare, because I booked only a day ahead) brought the total to $497.24.</p>
        <p>Accommodations</p>
        <p>Room rates are unpredictable in Las Vegas. Because my trip was organized at the last minute and I arrived during a convention weekend, I  wasn't able to find a great room deal, but very good discounts can be found with patience and flexibility, particularly at the casino hotels' Web pages; the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority reservations line, (800) 332-5333; or such discounters as Reservations Plus, (800) 805-9528; Las Vegas Hotel Reservation Services, (800) 728-4106 or at www.  lasvegasreservations.com.</p>
        <p>My room at the Maxim Hotel, Post Office Box 1990, (800) 634-6987, fax (702) 735-3252, lacked character but met my basic requirements. The 800-room hotel is at 160 East Flamingo Road. Local phone charges added $6 to my bill for one night: $64.31.</p>
        <p>Right on the Strip, the 351-room La Concha Motel, 2955 Las Vegas Boulevard South, (702) 735-1255, fax (702) 369-0862, has the world-weary air one expects in a Las Vegas motel. This room, too, was perfectly adequate, and local calls were free. One night with tax was $52.32.</p>
        <p>Dining</p>
        <p>All-you-can-eat buffets are still good deals, but they tend to all seem the same. The Mirage buffet, 3400 Las Vegas Boulevard, (702) 791-7111, is memorable for its fountains and gardens, its salads, and its bourbon-laced bread pudding. Lunch is $9.95, dinner is $14.95.</p>
        <p>At $10.95, the breakfast buffet at Bellagio, 3600 Las Vegas Boulevard, (702) 693-7223, is expensive by Las Vegas standards, but it offers variety, from sweet breakfast pasta to potatoes lyonnaise to the caramelized apples to top off the oatmeal.</p>
        <p>Main Street Station's Triple 7 restaurant and brewery, downtown at 200 North Main Street, (702) 387-1896, is a nice change from buffets for about the same price. Dinner specials, including grilled fish, meats,  and seafood, cost about $10. The  microbrews cost $2.95 for a 16-ounce glass, or $4.95 for a sampler of 5 ounces of each of the five brews.</p>
        <p>The graveyard-shift steak special is another dying tradition. Binion's Horseshoe Coffee Shop, 128 Fremont Street, (702) 382-1600, is hanging on with a worthy $4.99 version (a 10-ounce New York strip steak, baked potato, salad and rolls) served from 11 p.m. until 7 a.m.</p>
        <p>Activities</p>
        <p>On weekdays the Venetian, 3355 Las Vegas Boulevard, (702) 733-5000, offers free lessons in poker, dice, roulette and blackjack. Doves are no longer released at Piazza San Marco.</p>
        <p>At Treasure Island, 3300 Las Vegas Boulevard, (702) 894-7111, the first pirate battle of the day takes place at 4 p.m. and is repeated every 90 minutes (last battle at 10 p.m. Sunday to Thursday, 11:30 p.m. Friday and Saturday). Crowds start to gather about a half-hour before. Inside the hotel, the Buccaneer Bay Club and the north end of the Battle Bar have good views of the free skirmish.</p>
        <p>The Secret Garden of Siegfried &amp; Roy and Dolphin Habitat, at the Mirage, 3400 Las Vegas Boulevard, (702) 791-7111, are open 11 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Admission: $10. When the garden is closed, on Wednesday, admission to the Dolphin Habitat is $5.</p>
        <p>The Liberace Museum, 1775 East Tropicana Avenue, (702) 798-5595,  www.liberace.org., is open Monday to Saturday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., and  Sunday 1 to 5 p.m. Admission $6.95, seniors and students $4.95, children  12 or younger free.</p>
        <p>Cirque du Soleil's ''Mystere'' is performed Wednesday through Sunday, at 7:30 and 10:30 p.m., at Treasure Island, 3300 Las Vegas Boulevard. With tax, the ticket costs $82.50; (702) 796-9999.</p>
        <p>Getting Around</p>
        <p>The major national car rental companies and several local ones have branches at McCarran International Airport; most charge around $20 a day if you book in advance. Allstate Car Rental, (800) 634-6186, offers some of the best packages.</p>
        <p>A trip from the airport to the Strip or downtown costs about $12 to $15 by taxi, $4 on a Bell Trans minibus, (702) 739-7990. Wheelchair-accessible Citizens Area Transit buses, (702) 228-7433, cover the city well. On most routes, the one-way fare is $1.25 (exact change), with free transfers.  The No. 301 local and No. 302 express run along the Strip 24 hours a day, $2 each way.</p>
        <p>A free monorail connects the MGM Grand to Bally's, with trams linking other various combinations of casino hotels.</p>
