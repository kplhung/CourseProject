        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>With the dizzying heights and great speeds of modern amusement rides, patrons place a great deal of trust in the mechanics and operation of these devices. It is our job at the state Division of Codes and Standards to see that that trust is well placed. It was no accident that New Jersey just completed one of its safest amusement-ride seasons ever. We have strict standards and regular inspections. People who are strapped into these rides expect nothing less.</p>
        <p>In a recent article (''A Bumpy Ride This Summer,'' Sept. 10), some amusement-ride operators complained that New Jersey's regulations go too far. We believe they should go even further. The state has nearly doubled the number of inspectors on staff, initiated surprise inspections to observe rides and operators in action, conducted engineering reviews of new rides and significantly increased penalties for violations of regulations.</p>
        <p>But the deaths of a mother and daughter on a relatively tame amusement ride in 1999 indicated the need for additional steps. We are working with state lawmakers to develop legislation that would require greater accountability on the part of ride manufacturers and enable us to ensure that ride designs, especially new ones, are safe.</p>
        <p>We recognize that amusement rides are a business, and that park owners and operators make a living from the thrills they provide to patrons. We also appreciate the impact of the amusement-ride industry on New Jersey's economy. That is why we are committed to processing ride applications within 30 days.</p>
        <p>We do require that maintenance-operating manuals be supplied for each ride. Without them, it is impossible for the ride operators to keep the rides safe and impossible for our inspectors to thoroughly check them out. We don't view that as excessive ''paperwork'' or over-regulation. And we doubt that those who climb aboard these rides for fun and excitement do either.</p>
