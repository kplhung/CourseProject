        <p>NOT every designer can trace his inspiration to the surfers off Newport Beach, Calif., glimpsed on a cross-country motorcycle trip. But that is where Custodio Dalmau, better known as Custo, the designer of Custo Barcelona, had his creative epiphany.</p>
        <p>''On the coast from Los Angeles to San Diego, I saw the first printed T-shirt in my life,'' he recalled. ''It existed in Europe as a means for publicity, to advertise something, but not as a fashion statement. I saw a classic surfing T-shirt with a palm tree and a wave rider. It was the experience of my life.''</p>

        <p>NOT every designer can trace his inspiration to the surfers off Newport Beach, Calif., glimpsed on a cross-country motorcycle trip. But that is where Custodio Dalmau, better known as Custo, the designer of Custo Barcelona, had his creative epiphany.</p>
        <p>''On the coast from Los Angeles to San Diego, I saw the first printed T-shirt in my life,'' he recalled. ''It existed in Europe as a means for publicity, to advertise something, but not as a fashion statement. I saw a classic surfing T-shirt with a palm tree and a wave rider. It was the experience of my life.''</p>
        <p>Today Mr. Dalmau's snug-fitting psychedelic T-shirts decorated with images of party girls are the marquee items of a moderately priced clothing line that has a cult following. Customers line up for the designer's personal appearances, and many scour the country for every T-shirt he has ever created -- customers like Julieana Choy, 25, an office manager in Manhattan who lives in Fairfield, N.J., and has over 200 Custo Barcelona items.</p>
        <p>''I research his T-shirts to get as many as possible,'' she said. ''I contact distributors before each season so that I know what will be in each store. I separate my 1998 shirts from '99 and 2000 and keep the seasons separate, too.''</p>
        <p>A resident of Barcelona, Mr. Dalmau makes playful clothing that seems to echo that city's whimsical Antonio Gaudi buildings and Surrealist Miro paintings. At his Fashion Week show last month in Bryant Park, his sixth in New York, the models flounced down the runway in outfits splashed with red and pink polka dots, tan suede fringe and disco-style metallics. Set to techno music mixed by a French-African D.J., the collection looked like ''I Dream of Jeannie'' meets the rave scene.</p>
        <p>''They're clothes to dance till 8 in the morning in,'' said Kim Hastreiter, an editor and publisher of Paper magazine, who was at the show. ''He has a huge following. It's kind of like Betsey Johnson. But Betsey is more girly, and he's more clubby or Ibiza-y.''</p>
        <p>Since 1996, when Custo Barcelona was introduced in a few boutiques in the United States, ringing up $500,000 at wholesale, the brand has grown rapidly. Today it is sold in department stores like Saks Fifth Avenue, Henri Bendel and Neiman Marcus, with projected wholesale revenues this year of $25 million, Mr. Dalmau said. Worldwide, the line is expected to total $50 million this year. Ranging from $65 for a T-shirt to $300 for a cashmere and silk sweater, Custo Barcelona offers an economical way to embrace the swirling prints currently in fashion, compared with the four-figure designer versions from Fendi, Pucci and Versace.</p>
        <p>''Custo came at just the right time when people wanted a change,'' said Joan Kaner, the senior vice president and fashion director of Neiman Marcus. ''Fashion had turned a corner from minimalism and modernist. The line is about pattern and color and fun. The lady who buys Custo is interested in fun and fashion without a heavy investment.''</p>
        <p>Retailers across the country confirmed that Custo Barcelona is so popular that the items rarely go on sale. Although Mr. Dalmau isn't the only designer who makes appearances in stores, his habit of autographing his T-shirts has proved irresistible. Before a visit in March to Christians, a boutique in Raleigh, N.C., the store sent customers notices and a local newspaper wrote about the designer. Throngs lined up at the door, credit cards in hand.</p>
        <p>''I've been in business 17 years and I've never seen anything like Custo,'' said Nancy Steelman, the owner of the store. ''We sold over 400 units in four hours. We saw people from the military bases of North Carolina. We saw 13-year-old girls to an 85-year-old woman who wore a Custo and had it signed.''</p>
        <p>Similarly, when Mr. Dalmau made an appearance in April at Henri Bendel on Fifth Avenue, the line stretched to 25 people and the cash registers rang up over 400 shirts in three hours. The store had never sold so many items by a single designer in so short a time, said Gayle Scheck, the department manager for market collections.</p>
        <p>At the two Vin Baker boutiques in Santa Monica and Los Angeles, Custo Barcelona is the most profitable of 40 labels, Joe Peach, the owner, said. His best customers are middle-aged women, former flower children, he said, who relate to the graphics, which hark back to the 1960's and 70's. When Mr. Peach posted a date for a T-shirt signing by Mr. Dalmau on the store's Web site, he got orders from around the world.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dalmau, 44, is tan and short with rugged good looks. His deep voice and Castilian accent enhance his caballero appeal. Although his designs feature a palette of flamingo pink, peacock blue and canary yellow, he himself prefers a uniform of black and white. Only his long dark hair curling around the nape of his neck, his sandals and a thick silver necklace adorned with a few chunky crucifixes hint at the flower child within.</p>
        <p>Twenty years ago, Mr. Dalmau dropped out of architecture school at the University of Barcelona to take a two-year motorcycle trip with friends. To finance their journey, they planned to write about their travels for motorcycle magazines. In June 1980, they began their adventure in Washington Square Park and rode to California. It was there that Mr. Dalmau saw the T-shirt that he says shaped his career.</p>
        <p>After the trip, he briefly returned to San Diego to learn to surf. In 1982, he went back to Barcelona, where he had grown up, and started a T-shirt business with his brother, David, four years his junior, who assumed the role of financial manager.</p>
        <p>It took 13 years of false starts before the T-shirts evolved beyond simple central images derived from surfer culture to the elaborate designs of today: a mix of vibrant colors and retro prints combined with illustrations of hipster chicks in bell-bottoms, shades, hats and heels, sipping martinis, having a swell time. Recently, Mr. Dalmau began adding fanciful details to the tops, like sequins, eyelets and knit trim, and diversified the collection by including skirts, dresses, pants, tops and even men's wear.</p>
        <p>Katherine Coats, 35, an optometrist in Holly Springs, N.C., is a typical collector. Two years ago, she spotted a T-shirt on a store mannequin and liked the retro design. The splashy style also reminded her of Fran Drescher's wardrobe on the television show ''The Nanny.''</p>
        <p>Before long, Ms. Coats was a Custo addict. Every store in the Raleigh area that carries the line now calls her when a shipment comes in. She has instructed them to hold one T-shirt in her size in every style until she can get in to make her selection. Competition for the tops is so fierce that she has been forced to comb the country in her hunt for them.</p>
        <p>''I've bought them in Nordstrom's in D.C.,'' she said. ''I tracked down one in Atlanta and another in Texas. I went to a T-shirt signing, and it was unbelievable. There were 15 people lined up outside the store before it even opened. I got there at 9:30 and there were already women ahead of me.''</p>
