        <p>FISHING, I recently discovered, is about more than, well, fishing. Of course, seasoned fishermen know this, but my experience with a rod can be counted on as many fingers as a trout has.</p>
        <p>I wanted to see what all the fuss was about. I needed to know why the guys on television fishing shows always coo, ''nice fish, pretty fish'' no matter what they pull out of the water. I wanted to find out why someone would leave a successful business career in New York City and relocate to Cornwall, opening a company called Housatonic River Outfitters and living contentedly  on one-tenth of what he used to earn.</p>
        <p>That's exactly what 38-year-old Harold D. McMillan has done. I actually met him years ago when he was teaching children in Bridgeport how to fish. Now he was offering a respite from life in Fairfield County. I grabbed my 14-year old son, Seth, and headed north on Route 7.</p>
        <p>Route 7 slalomed alongside the Housatonic, and before long we arrived in Cornwall. I put my window down and said to the man securing a big blue rubber raft to a trailer, ''That's it?'' Steve Yoos, age 46 from Watertown, our guide for the day, grinned and nodded. Another guide, Rob Parkins, heaped two yellow pontoon boats on top.</p>
        <p>We were aiming to go out after 9 a.m., when Northeast Utilities hydroelectric plant, upstream in Falls Village, releases water through a dam to generate electricity. The impending re-licensing of the plant and the local people pushing for natural flow dominated the conversation as we drove to the launch site.</p>
        <p>We pulled into White Hollow Farms, drove across a field, past an old vineyard and backed the boats up to the riverbank. One of the first things the mother and son members of this expedition learned was the Litchfield Wave, not a salutation but a necessity near the river: brushing the mosquitos and no-see-ums out of our faces while the guides unloaded the boats. As we neared the water's edge, the air cooled. We had no complaints weather wise; the day was superb, with low humidity, a clear blue sky and sun-drenched vistas.</p>
        <p>Steve pulled the boat half-way up the bank, and gallantly got me into my swiveling seat in the stern, from dry grass to dry boat. I could have been wearing Manolo Blahniks, stepping from limo to Le Cirque. Seth jumped in and sat in the bow seat. Steve and Rob pushed the boat into the water, about six inches deep at this point, and Steve sat in the middle.</p>
        <p>Slowly, gently, we floated at a nearly imperceptible three miles per hour. It was profoundly quiet except for the birds. Then we dropped anchor in about four feet of water. Steve readied the spinning rods, starting with Seth who had a bit more knowledge than I, and soon he was casting nicely. Then the soft-spoken man of infinite patience turned his attention to me.</p>
        <p>Steve showed me how to place my hand, with forefinger on the line, releasing the bail, cast, with a flick at the last moment. To watch him cast was humbling: a fluid, graceful invitation to the bass and trout below. My first cast, I forgot to release the bail. The hook slapped the water about two feet from the boat.</p>
        <p>''Keep the rod low when you're reeling in, leave about three feet of line to cast again,'' he said. Easy, that's about what I had started with. I tried again.</p>
        <p>Nice cast, said Steve, as the hook and lure arced toward the bank to the left of the boat. My goal was to elicit that mellow praise from my guide with each try. I was concentrating very hard, getting the distance, aiming for the right spot along the bank. It was going rather well. I had the rhythm. I tried casting back-hand, swiveling in my chair. This seemed to work better. But then I had a momentary lapse. I tried to put top-spin on my cast, thanks to tennis, and instead of going off toward the riverbank, the line flew up toward the bow, crossing lines with Seth.</p>
        <p>''Incoming!'' shouted Steve.</p>
        <p>''Mom! yelled Seth.</p>
        <p>The fish scattered. ''I saw the white light, Mom,'' said my teenager, referring to a near-death experience of my doing. So far the only thing I had caught was grief.</p>
        <p>We all settled back down. A flotilla of canoes overtook us and were soon out of sight. Up overhead was the Route 7 bridge that at that point doubled with the Appalachian Trail. Seth managed to cast into some bankside vegetation. ''If you're not getting caught in the trees, you're not getting close enough,'' said Steve.</p>
        <p>By noon we had hooked a submerged tree branch, riverbank vegetation and rocks. The rule on the river is catch and release. In our case it was catch and be released.</p>
        <p>Where were the fish? We learned that the dam releases distress the fish and insects, causing the exposed rocks to heat up, and as a result raise the river temperature, upsetting the delicate balance of the ecosystem. Another reason we hadn't had so much as a nibble was that post-card perfect days send the fish into the banks where the shadows are.</p>
        <p>I had seen a program the night before on cable about the Loch Ness monster, the latest theory being that it is some kind of prehistoric whale, and we were chatting about that; cast and chat, chat and reel in.</p>
        <p>My line went taut and zig-zagged. I did not scream. ''You've got a fish,'' Steve said very quietly. And from the murky, khaki-colored water, my rod nearly bent in half, I caught sight of a beautiful, shimmering rock bass, a feisty eight inches long. I reeled it in and Steve extracted the hook and gently set him back in the water. Score one for Mom.</p>
        <p>After a break for lunch, we set off again, with Steve rowing (how nice someone else was driving) parallel to the left bank. Cast, reel in, chit-chat. Suddenly Seth's rod nearly jumped out of his hands. He had hooked a large-mouth bass. It looked exactly like the plastic ones mounted on a plaque that sing and wiggle. Steve estimated that it was a couple of pounds and 14 to 15 inches long.</p>
        <p>''These are the ones the bass guys on Saturday morning TV kiss,'' he said, and added, ''That's the first large-mouth we've caught this year.'' After that there was no stopping my son. He hooked fish like crazy the rest of the afternoon. I caught two more smallies.</p>
        <p>Up ahead, where the river bent to the left, was a doe sipping at the water's edge. Steve pointed out otter slides in the steep banks. Birds darted and swooped above us, catching insects in the air as they rose from the water. Farther up, a great heron glided like a silent 747. Intermittently something sweetly fragrant could be sniffed in the air.</p>
        <p>Steve had alerted us to expect a change in the ride. It started as a whisper, increased to a zephyr and intensified. Except it wasn't the wind. I caught sight of the riffle ahead, water racing over the rocks. Steve pointed the raft straight ahead and down we went, buffeted by semi-submerged boulders, wending our way to the tranquil pool below.</p>
        <p>Seth thought it was fun. I was so relaxed we could have ridden out the Perfect Storm for all I cared. We arrived in the pool called Push 'Em Up. Before I knew it we were getting out of the boat and the guides were loading it back on to the trailer. ''We have to ask for these guys again,'' Seth said.</p>
        <p>Soon we were back on Route 7, heading south. Seth had brought his laptop and a  movie to watch in case he got bored in the car. But he never touched them. He rolled down his window, breathed the air, looked at the river through the thick forest and said, ''It's a different world.''</p>
