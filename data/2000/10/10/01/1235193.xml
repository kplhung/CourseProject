        <p>An artist who designs inflatable plastic shelters that kept a number of street people warm and dry last winter plans to step up his work this winter.</p>
        <p>''It was great,'' the artist, Michael Rakowitz, said of last year's effort. ''The people who used them were dispersed throughout the city.'' Some lived in the South Ferry area, some around Pennsylvania Station and some even made it to Queens.</p>
        <p>A photo and video display of Mr. Rakowitz's custom-built shelters, which resemble giant cocoons, opened last month at White Columns, a gallery on at 320 West 13th Street, with the entrance on Horatio Street. His work is part of a group exhibition called ''Concerted Compassionism,'' which will continue through Oct. 15.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rakowitz, who teaches at the State University College at Purchase and Pratt Institute, started custom-building individual homeless shelters in and near Boston three years ago. The shelters, which cost him only $5 apiece and which he gives away, are made of clear plastic; homeless people told him they do not like black, which hides them from the outside world and vice versa.</p>
        <p>The shelters include Velcro liners that can be used to store personal articles or signs, and they attach to the ducts of a building's heating and ventilating system. The warm air leaving the building flows through the insulation like a radiator, heating and inflating the shelters.</p>
        <p>''There are about 20 people who want a shelter of their own this winter,'' Mr. Rakowitz said, ''and I plan on making them for those who are still around.''</p>
        <p>He tailors each shelter for the individual homeless person, whom he tries to get to know. After a Police Department spokesman warned last year that erecting the shelters on city property was illegal, Mr. Rakowitz said he and one homeless man worked out a design that was ''really almost like an extension of the body itself and less like a tent.''</p>
        <p>The only serious encounter with the police of which he was aware occurred outside a residential building in Chelsea. The officer who arrived recognized Mr. Rakowitz from a news article, and instead of shooing the homeless man along, called his commander to request more time for the man to move his belongings.</p>
        <p>''This was a policeman who was actually sympathetic to this one homeless guy,'' Mr. Rakowitz said.</p>
        <p>A woman from the building also recognized Mr. Rakowitz. ''She lay down in the shelter to see what it was like,'' he said.</p>
