        <p>IF it's possible to buff tinsel, the nation's top movie studios tried gamely to polish Hollywood's tarnished image last week.</p>
        <p>Top film executives appeared before a Senate committee to deliver mea culpas following fresh revelations about the use of teenagers and children as young as 9 in market research to make R-rated films, theatrical trailers and commercials more appealing to youngsters. The strategy surfaced in confidential documents submitted to the Federal Trade Commission, which released a report earlier this month about the pervasive marketing of violent entertainment to  children.</p>
        <p>In its defense, the Motion Picture Association of America pledged to tighten marketing practices, promising to permit underage audiences for R-rated test screenings only if accompanied by an adult.</p>
        <p>Among the documents were memos from the National Research Group, a market research firm that conducts surveys for the major studios. The memos, filled with industry argot, showed that at almost every stage of the moviemaking process -- sometimes when a film was still an idea -- young teens and children were asked their opinions to help shape the finished product. Excerpts follow.</p>
        <p>DOREEN CARVAJAL</p>
        <p>A memo to Columbia Tristar executives  discusses preparations for a sequel to the 1997 teen slasher movie ''I Know What You Did Last Summer.'' It outlines plans to interview 10-  and 11-year-olds who had seen the original film, and to test name recognition of entertainers with a pre-teen following, including the pop singer Brandy and the actress Jennifer Love Hewitt from the television series ''Party of Five.''</p>
        <p>The list of questioning will include, but not be limited to the following:</p>
        <p>About the first movie, favorite character . . . scariest scene, most remembered about ending, most liked about ending, aspect of the movie most desired to see in the sequel.</p>
        <p>About the sequel: awareness and popularity of Brandy, Freddie Prinze Jr., Sarah Michelle Gellar, Jennifer Love Hewitt and a list of young actors and actresses to be provided. Feelings about the new settings. Expectation of the sequel in terms of plot, cast, music, etc.</p>
        <p>This memo gauges potential interest in ''Disturbing Behavior,'' an R-rated horror film being prepared for release by MGM/ United Artists featuring the actress Katie Holmes from the TV show ''Dawson's Creek.'' The report was based on telephone interviews with 400 people aged 12 to 59, and 331 others between 10 and 20 years old.</p>
        <p>Positioning statement: ''Disturbing Behavior'' is a fast-paced provocative thriller starring the next ''Scream Team'' racing against a community that has taken discipline to an extreme. Steve's family moves to a seemingly perfect town where a disturbed psychologist has convinced parents that the best way to get their kids to conform is to submit them to ''Stepford-like'' programming that forces them to ignore usual teen urges.</p>
        <p>Key selling points: Not just teen slasher  -- more intellectual, thought provoking.  Technology dehumanizing people for greater authoritative control. Don't trust anyone over 30 camaraderie. Sexy, edgy underthemes -- sex, drugs, rock and roll. Young good-looking people -- girl from ''Dawson's Creek.'' Likable hero. Potential for great soundtrack. Bond between siblings. New school/back to school.</p>
        <p>A subsequent report to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer rates the effectiveness of ''Fear'' and ''Terror,'' two 30-second commercials for ''Disturbing Behavior,'' based on surveys of 438 moviegoers 12 to 20 years old.</p>
        <p>Underlining the suspense and the appealing idea of something being amiss, the stand-out scene continues to be the blonde hitting her head into the mirror. Also enjoyed are scenes of Holmes' confrontation with a strange man after being menaced.</p>
        <p>All of these factors again lead to stronger performance of the commercials among 15- to 17-years-old. Those 18 to 24 remain the more hesitant about the horror focus of the story. However, results suggest that the more straightforward emphasis on brainwashing or control through experimentation as conveyed by ''Fear'' has increased interest somewhat over previous commercials among the 18 to 24 crowd.</p>
        <p>Younger males are the most interested in what they consider to be a ''good and dark'' story. Younger females most mention that the movie stars Katie Holmes.</p>
        <p>Another memo summarizes audience reaction to a test screening of ''Judge Dredd,'' a science-fiction movie starring Sylvester Stallone as a heavily armed policeman who dispenses street justice in a lawless futuristic city. The audience in Renton, Wash., included 337 people, one-third 13 to 16 years old.</p>
        <p>Judge Dredd, in this early rough-cut version, played very well to teenagers, generating well above average ratings and recommend scores from young teenagers, with the highest scores from younger males.</p>
        <p>The movie generated average ratings and recommend scores from older (18 and over) males and somewhat below average scores from older females. . . .</p>
        <p>Scenes liked most: . . . Chief justice dies in front of Blind Justice statue. Former chief justice dies. Hanging with cannibals. First judge saves Dredd from cannibals. . . .</p>
        <p>Scenes liked least: . . . Fight at end. Hanging off Statue of Liberty. Kiss at end. Women fight. Chief justice dies. Robot tears off man's arms . . .</p>
        <p>In sum, ''Judge Dredd'' generated an enthusiastic response among young teenagers despite the rough state of the movie and the incomplete special effects. The movie generated well above average ratings and recommend scores from teenagers. The enjoyment of the movie lessened significantly among the older age groups. . . .</p>
        <p>Afterword: An online critique of a test screening of ''Disturbing Behavior'' posted by Lighthouse Shines Advance Movie Reviews found little evidence of the ''intellectual, thought provoking'' material cited in the National Research Group's prerelease memo.</p>
        <p>Until they actually showed a pair of naked breasts . . . I assumed that this film would be PG-13 or something lame like that. Although after editing the final version still might be, as the audience was filled with teenagers (God, I am starting to sound like my parents!). . . .</p>
        <p>I don't think that this film was ever meant to be brain surgery or Shakespeare in the first place anyway, so I enjoyed the film for what it was. Some good clean fun with some creepy cheap thrills and shocks thrown in. . . . Which I think is what it was meant to be all along.''</p>
