        <p>BOXING has always provided an apt metaphor for films about struggle and redemption.

        <p>BOXING has always provided an apt metaphor for films about struggle and redemption. The troubled young man from the poor background is locked in the frame with his adversary, the sweat flies, there are close-ups of agonized faces and the architecture of oiled and muscled bodies. As more and more women, including Muhammad Ali's daughter, Laila, and Joe Frazier's daughter, Jacqui Frazier-Lyde, take up the sport, it is almost inevitable that films about women who box should follow, too.</p>
        <p>Now comes ''Girlfight,'' a first feature by Karyn Kusama, which opened Friday. It is the story of a sullen, gum chewing, muscular girl from the underclass, played by Michelle Rodriguez, who literally fights her way into the ring.</p>
        <p>''The idea was to take the classic boxing story, put a female protagonist in it and subvert the form,'' said Ms. Kusama, 32.</p>
        <p>Like more traditional boxing movies before it -- ''The Champ,'' with Wallace Beery, ''Champion,'' with Kirk Douglas, or 'Raging Bull'' and ''Rocky'' -- ''Girlfight'' is about ''an outsider who enters a world  where she does not belong and finds a place for herself,'' Ms. Kusama said. In fact, that description could apply to Ms. Kusama: she had to struggle to get financing for the film from reluctant studios.</p>
        <p>Movie companies wanted her to make her character a white girl, ''a celebrity starlet in an environment of material comfort,'' said Ms. Kusama, who described trying to raise money for the film as ''a nightmare.''</p>
        <p>''A woman in a traditional male role is really scary for people,'' she said. ''People felt she would be unappealing, unbelievable.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Kusama added: ''I wasn't thinking of the movie in socio-political terms. I thought it would be fresh.''</p>
        <p>''Girlfight,'' which shared the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival with ''You Can Count on Me'' and which also won the Director's Award, provides a rare film portrait of the lives of Panamanians and Dominicans, as well as Puerto Ricans, who inhabit the world of boxing. ''It's modern, urban Latino,'' said Ms. Kusama. Most movies about Latinos feature primarily Puerto Ricans, Ms. Kusama said, but Latino ''doesn't mean one thing.''</p>
        <p>In ''Girlfight,'' the protagonist, Diana -- hair slicked down in corn rows, with a strand falling over her eyes -- is prone to starting fights in high school. And there are sorrows buried in Diana's family, including a mother who had committed suicide after being physically abused by Diana's father (played by Paul Calderon). Meanwhile, the father has pinned his hopes on her brother (Ray Santiago), whom he wants to be a boxer but who really wants to be an artist.</p>
        <p>When Diana goes to the neighborhood gym in search of her brother, she decides she wants to box, too. But the trainer tells her: ''You can't. Girls don't have the same power as boys.'' She asks her father to pay for her training, but he won't hear of it. So she steals from him and pawns her mother's locket. Soon she meets another young fighter, Adrian (Santiago Douglas), and they fall in love. When Diana takes a punch in the eye, she asks Adrian, ''Do you still like me with my black eye?''</p>
        <p>''I think I like you more,'' Adrian replies.</p>
        <p>At first, when the lovers spar, Adrian can't bear to hit her. ''I love you, I really do,'' she tells him as they are locked in combat.</p>
        <p>''They say love kills you in the ring,'' one of the boxers says.</p>
        <p>Then, in what the gym owner bills as New York's ''first gender-blind amateur boxing event,'' Diana and Adrian are paired against each other. But Adrian is reluctant. ''If you don't fight me in this match,'' Diana says, ''you're less of a man than you think you are.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Kusama admits that the idea of women and men fighting each other in boxing competition is unlikely at the moment. But ''10 year ago boys and girls wouldn't wrestle each other,'' she said. ''Now they do it in high school and college championships. And the girls sometimes win.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Kusama was drawn to boxing in 1992, when a friend took her to Gleason's Gym in Brooklyn. A chain smoker, she hoped sparring would curb her habit. She came to love the sport. ''I realized what an intimate situation it is.'' It was as if the two people in the ring had invaded each other's sense of space and time, she said. ''It made sense to me that young boys from very, very troubled backgrounds would seek out the physical contact and the emotional contact with the trainers.''</p>
        <p>Of course, you can really get hurt. On one occasion, Ms. Kusama was knocked out by ''a really good woman boxer,'' she said.</p>
        <p>''You can wear a breast plate, but it's not very effective to punch someone on the breast. It makes more sense to go for the organs or the brain, the liver, the kidneys.''</p>
        <p>For Ms. Kusama, ''There's a sort of decorum to the violence of boxing that I took to be an idealized version of the world.'' Only, she added, ''where in life do you have a referee?''</p>
        <p>''Boxers are the most courageous people in the world, oh my God,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The story for ''Girlfight'' grew partly out her own ''general sense of isolation and alienation growing up,'' Ms. Kusama said.</p>
        <p>She was raised in St. Louis, where her father, a Japanese-American, is a child psychiatrist and her mother an educational psychologist. Ms. Kusama attended New York University Film school and won the Mobil Prize for ''Sleeping Beauties,'' a 15- minute short about two sisters with a telepathic connection.</p>
        <p>After graduating from N.Y.U., Ms. Kusama became, she said, ''the queen of odd jobs,'' adding, ''I've tried to just get through life.'' She met the filmmaker John Sayles through a baby-sitting job and became his personal assistant. She was impressed by Mr. Sayles's commitment to his art. She watched him develop his 1996 movie ''Lone Star'' from inception to release.</p>
        <p>When Ms. Kusama wrote the script for ''Girlfight,'' Mr. Sayles's longtime companion, Maggie Renzi, and her business partner, Sarah Greene, agreed to produce it, along with Martha Griffin. The budget was $1 million. But all the film companies, including Sony Classics Pictures, Fine Line Features, Miramax, passed.</p>
        <p>Finally, in 1999, Ms. Kusama secured a backer. But two days before pre-production began, the backer pulled out. Mr. Sayles and Ms. Renzi came to the rescue and promisedthe $1 million. Later, the Independent Film Channel chipped in $300,000.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sayles said he had never doubted that the film would get a distributor. He liked the idea of a woman as the main character in a boxing movie. ''She doesn't want to be a 'girly-girl,' '' he said on the phone recently. ''She's in chaos. Once in that world, there is a kind of belonging.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Kusama found her star, Ms. Rodriguez, at an open casting call. A self-described ''Jersey City girl'' who is half Dominican and half Puerto Rican, she grew up in a rough neighborhood. Members of her family are Jehovah's Witnesses. She dropped out of high school and later got her high school equivalency diploma at age 17. ''Life educated me, honey,'' Ms. Rodriguez said in a phone interview.</p>
        <p>Ms. Rodriguez had decided to pursue acting because she hated the idea of a 9-to-5 job. She then signed up with ''some cheesy agency that, like, robs you for money,'' she said. The agency took photos of her but failed to get her a job. Then she saw the notice for the ''Girlfight'' call in Backstage. ''I got there about one and a half hours late, as always,'' she said. ''I'm pretty irresponsible.''</p>
        <p>There were 350 other contenders for the part. ''She read lines,'' said Ms. Kusama. ''It was a disaster. She had no concept of what this process was. She didn't know that when you make a mistake you don't berate yourself in the middle of the tape and roll your eyes.''</p>
        <p>But ''we could not find anyone who could come close to her in physical power,'' Ms. Kusama said. ''Michelle projects a lot of intelligence, more like an animal intelligence.'' The director decided to take a chance.</p>
        <p>The production hired an acting coach, and sent Ms. Rodriguez, who had never boxed before, to a gym to get in shape. ''After a week they said I was ready to spar,'' Ms. Rodriguez said. ''I turned into an animal.''</p>
        <p>''I looked like I was on steroids because I was so buff.''</p>
        <p>The film was shot in Jersey City and New York. It was accepted at the Sundance competition, and suddenly all the companies that had rejected it began competing to buy it, Ms. Kusama said. Finally, Screen Gems purchased it for $3 million. Ms. Kusama also made a deal with Capitol Records to release the distinctive soundtrack with its blend of hip-hop, flamenco and hand clapping.</p>
        <p>Ms. Kusama herself has given up boxing. She lives in the Fort Greene section of Brooklyn with three roommates and is writing a new script, which she describes as ''bio-fiction.'' She doesn't have a production deal, but, with the release of ''Girlfight,'' she said, she believes it will be far easier to get money for a movie this time around.</p>
        <p>''Now,'' she said, ''I will be playing a different kind of game.''</p>
