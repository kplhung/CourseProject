        <p>Models and other fashion insiders have been nursing miniature bottles of Champagne for years, backstage at fashion shows and at chic parties and promotions. Cashing in on the cool appeal of casually sipping bubbly from a hand-held bottle, companies like Moet &amp; Chandon, Veuve Clicquot and Pommery are marketing the minis, or splits, to the general public. Piper-Heidsieck has packaged its Baby Pipers (about a glass and a half) in eye-catching red bottles and distributes them to restaurants like Brasserie 8 1/2 and Flute ($15 a pop), which serve them right in the bottle, like beer.</p>

        <p>Models and other fashion insiders have been nursing miniature bottles of Champagne for years, backstage at fashion shows and at chic parties and promotions.

        <p>Liquor stores carry the splits ($8 to $10) in party-ready packaging. York Wine &amp; Spirits displays their Baby Pipers in boxes of 24. ''They're tiny, sexy and luxurious, and people have a sense of ownership when they hold them,'' explained Herve Rousseau, an owner of Flute, who says the minis have been particularly popular with women since he began stocking them two weeks ago. ''They're like an accessory or toy.'' And since they have screw tops, they won't explode all over an expensive silk blouse.</p>
