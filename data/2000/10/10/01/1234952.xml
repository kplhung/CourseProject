        <p>LIKE children with their noses pressed up against a candy-store window, Panamanian tourism officials had watched with longing and frustration as cruise ships full of tourists glided tantalizingly through the canal on their way to the Caribbean or South America. But starting this month, vacationers who would  have seen Panama only from a ship's railing finally will be able to go ashore when Panama inaugurates Colon 2000, a $45 million cruise ship port on the Caribbean entrance to the legendary canal.</p>
        <p>The project, a joint venture between the Panamanian Government and a private developer, is a major advance in Panama's quest to transform its image and economy since the United States handed over the last of its military bases on Dec. 31.</p>
        <p>While other projects in the former Canal Zone have been geared to the more mundane businesses of shipping and cargo, backers of Colon 2000 hope to lure tourists ashore with the promise of duty-free shopping to the accompaniment of music and folk dancing at a two-story, 190,000-square-foot mall and a 150-room Radisson Hotel, scheduled to open in June.</p>
        <p>Eighty port calls are already expected for the first year, by ships from Carnival, Celebrity Cruises, Holland America and Princess Cruises. Visitors can go fishing or golfing near Colon, or even dash down to Panama City at the canal's Pacific entrance and tour the Canal Museum or shop at the handicrafts market.</p>
        <p>''We are the only port of call that can offer a shore excursion that would include a tour of both the Caribbean and the Pacific.'' said Augusto Terracina, the marketing manager for Colon 2000.</p>
        <p>The lush lands along the canal's route boast bird sanctuaries and eco-tourism resorts. An odd transformation has taken place at the former School of the Americas, the controversial finishing school for Latin American military leaders, which the Spanish hotel chain Sol Melia has converted into a secluded resort on Gatun Lake near Colon.</p>
        <p>But there are security concerns for tourists. The city, which was a boom town during the canal's construction between 1904 and 1914, has many rundown areas rife with crime. Panamanians hope the new projects will create jobs and ease unemployment. Although tourism officials are hopeful enough about Colon that they will offer tours of its old section, some Panamanians are doubtful that the city's fortunes have improved enough to make it attractive to tourists. At any rate, it is not the kind of place where tourists should wander alone.</p>
        <p>The city's grim sections are in contrast to the commercial buzz inside the Colon Free Trade Zone, the biggest in the world after Hong Kong. Panamanian officials are taking advantage of the port's proximity to the free zone to offer bargains in everything from electronics to Gucci.</p>
        <p>''The prices tourists are going to find here will be much better than in other ports because we have the free trade zone which distributes to the Caribbean,'' Mr. Terracina said. ''St. Thomas is one of the most popular shopping ports. Well, we distribute to St. Thomas. That right there would save the passenger lots of money.''</p>
