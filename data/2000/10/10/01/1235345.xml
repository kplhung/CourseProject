        <p>Suzy Favor Hamilton had the fastest time in the world this year in the women's 1,500 meters. Her career best of 3 minutes 57.40 seconds, run with a new assertiveness and an appetite for distance training, made her a favorite for a gold medal in the Sydney Games.</p>
        <p>Her chances seemed to improve almost every day as the Olympics approached. Regina Jacobs, the American champion at the Olympic trials, withdrew from the Games with a respiratory viral infection. Then the defending Olympic champion, Svetlana Masterkova of Russia, hobbled off the track in the first round here.</p>
        <p>Favor Hamilton, 32, ran easily through the heats, but the usually gregarious runner declined to speak to reporters. When she collapsed in the homestretch today and finished last, no explanation was given, other than that she was being treated for dehydration. Many questions went unanswered. Had she been sick? Did she panic when three runners passed her and she realized she would not become the first American woman to win a medal in the event?</p>
        <p>Favor Hamilton missed the entire 1999 season after surgery to repair her torn left Achilles tendon. In September of last year, her brother Dan Favor committed suicide; a manic-depressive, he had stopped taking his medication, she said. She dedicated the Olympic season to her brother and began using her maiden name, Favor, again in his honor.</p>
        <p>At the University of Wisconsin, Favor Hamilton won nine national collegiate titles, a record. But, as a professional, she had gained the reputation as a soft, timid runner who did not race smartly and was unreliable in major competitions. That seemed to change this year.</p>
        <p>In June, at the Prefontaine Classic in Eugene, Ore., Favor Hamilton ran to the front of the 1,500 meters and boldly led Gabriela Szabo of Romania, the 1996 Olympic silver medalist, until the final meters, lunging and falling to the track as Szabo caught her at the tape.</p>
        <p>Today's race unfolded at a crawl. The first lap took 70 seconds. Marla Runyan of Eugene, the first legally-blind athlete to make an American Olympic team, went to the front. By 800 meters, Favor Hamilton took the lead. She was still ahead with 150 meters remaining, but she struggled out of the final turn and stumbled to the track without colliding with anyone.</p>
        <p>Nouria Merah-Benida of Algeria won in the second-slowest time ever in the Olympics, 4:05.10. Violeta Szekely of Romania took the silver and Szabo finished third with her fierce kick after nearly tripping over a fallen British runner, Hayley Tullett.</p>
        <p>Runyan, who finished eighth, called the slow pace ''ridiculous'' and said the ending confused her.</p>
        <p>''I feel like I'm in a bad dream,'' Runyan said. ''Who won? Who fell? I need a narrator.''</p>
        <p>Szabo said she also did not know what happened to Favor Hamilton.</p>
        <p>''I'm sorry for her,'' Szabo said. ''But this is sport. There is a winner and a loser.''</p>
