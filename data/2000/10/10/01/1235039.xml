        <p>AS state Republicans see it, the mistake in their soft-money television commercial targeted at Steve J. Israel, the Democratic candidate for the Second Congressional District seat, was just an innocent error. As the Israel campaign sees it, the ad was evidence that the Republicans don't know Suffolk County.</p>
        <p>The commercial, which ran for several days on Cablevision, identified Mr. Israel as a ''county board member'' who ''voted for at least 11 county fee increases.''</p>

        <p>AS state Republicans see it, the mistake in their soft-money television commercial targeted at Steve J. Israel, the Democratic candidate for the Second Congressional District seat, was just an innocent error. As the Israel campaign sees it, the ad was evidence that the Republicans don't know Suffolk County.</p>
        <p>The commercial, which ran for several days on Cablevision, identified Mr. Israel as a ''county board member'' who ''voted for at least 11 county fee increases.''</p>
        <p>But there is nothing in Suffolk called the county board, and Mr. Israel has never served on the county Legislature.</p>
        <p>''Steve Israel is a member of the Huntington Town Board who never voted on any legislation that would affect county fees,'' said John Lapp, Mr. Israel's spokesman. ''This is a cookie-cutter ad made by Washington consultants who don't know what they are talking about.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Israel, 42, has been on the Huntington Town Board since 1993. His opponent, Joan Johnson, 66, has served as Islip Town clerk since 1991. They are competing for the seat being vacated by Representative Rick A. Lazio, who is running for the Senate.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the Johnson campaign, Jon Hymes, disavowed the ad, which was paid for by the state Republican Committee.</p>
        <p>''It was not Joan's ad,'' he insisted. ''She's been focusing on running a very positive campaign.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Israel said Ms. Johnson was remiss in not speaking up.</p>
        <p>''I'm sure she knows the difference between a town councilman and a county legislator,'' he said. ''Joan Johnson presumably watches the commercials and should have called and said it's wrong. She had an obligation to do that. A candidate should be responsible for what the campaign is saying and to correct such a glaring factual error. Instead, she chose to allow the distortions to continue.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Israel said his campaign first learned of the ad on Sept. 19 when a supporter called after seeing it. The campaign's lawyer, James Gaughran, wrote to Cablevision asking that it pull the ad because it is ''unquestionably misleading to voters and harmful to the public interest.''</p>
        <p>Asked about Mr. Israel's complaint that Ms. Johnson had launched her campaign with a ''distorted and factually incorrect soft-money ad,'' Mr. Hymes said: ''It's laughable compared to the way he ran his primary campaign -- very negative and repeatedly attacking his opponent. The cycle of attacks bankrupted both campaigns.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Israel's primary opponent was a county legislator, David Bishop of Lindenhurst. Each campaign said it spent more than $300,000.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the state Republicans, Dan Allen, said his office learned of the mistake when Cablevision called on Sept. 22. He said the ad was quickly pulled and a corrected version was made over the weekend that ran last week, replacing the word ''county'' with ''town.''</p>
        <p>Alan Gershuny, the Israel campaign manager, said he did not dispute that Mr. Israel had voted to increase fees 11 times during his tenure on the Town Board.</p>
        <p>Mr. Allen took responsibility for the original ad and acknowledged an ''error in the scripting.'' He added that the Johnson campaign was not consulted about the ad, saying: ''A political party is not allowed to coordinate outside ads with the candidate.''</p>
        <p>Asked if the ads were hurting Ms. Johnson because of her vow to wage a campaign based on issues rather than attacks, Mr. Allen replied: ''This is what we do around the state. Our job is to make sure we support the Republican candidates and make clear that there is a clear distinction between the Republican and Democratic candidates.''</p>
