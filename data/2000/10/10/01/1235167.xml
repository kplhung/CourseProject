      <block class="full_text">
        <p>In this age of synthetics, it seems that nobody wants to bond.</p>
        <p>Nobody knows this better than Kazi Helal, the evening barman at the Chemists'  Club, on 45th Street between Fifth Avenue and the Avenue of the Americas in the Club Quarters Hotel.</p>
        <p>He is the loneliest mixologist in Midtown, and he can be found in the empty room known as Rumford Hall dressed in a maroon blazer and bow tie, polishing brandy snifters with a slow, methodical purposelessness.</p>
        <p>His only company most evenings are the pink lofty marble columns and the aging oil portraits of deceased chemists and Nobel laureates. The hall itself is dedicated to Benjamin Thompson, Count Rumford, an 18th-century British scientist, born in America, who is credited with, among other things, inventing the modern fireplace.  A plaque to the wig-wearing Count Rumford refers somewhat opaquely to his being ''Driven . . . hence by neighborly intolerance.''</p>
        <p>''Who knows, maybe Rumford was a big drinker,'' says Mr. Helal, 42. ''But not too many chemists come now. I don't know. Maybe they're tired. Too much mixing. They used to have a very big library. It was very expensive. But they sold it. Nobody cares now.''</p>
        <p>The club, according to Ronald Stefandl, the president, and Hal Simons, the vice president, was at one time a citadel to the scientist. Until the oil crisis of the 70's, New York was the chemical capital of the world: Mobil, Exxon and Union Carbide were all based here.</p>
        <p>The old club was at Madison Avenue and 41st Street, and it had a barbershop, a library and 10 floors of rooms where out-of-town chemists kept their shaving kits and their mistresses. Deals were done at the oak.</p>
        <p>''If you got to the bar at 5 minutes after 5, you were three deep,'' remembered Mr. Simons, 81.</p>
        <p>But the companies consolidated, cut costs and moved away. And the new breed of chemical man is a suburban homebody  by nature. Once the Chemists' boasted 2,400 members with a 500-man waiting list. Now there are just 600. They sold the old granite-block building about a decade ago and landed here in the hotel, just off the lobby.</p>
        <p>The decline, Mr. Helal says, is just the way things work. It is Newton's Third Law of Motion: For every force, there is an equal and opposite force. Or, as he put it, ''What comes up must go down.''</p>
        <p>A busy evening here is perhaps 18 patrons and when it becomes hurly-burly, Mr. Kazi does not lose his cool. His demeanor is always smooth, the martini always dry.</p>
        <p>The mixologist's recipe:</p>
        <p>3 oz. C2 H5 OH + H2 O @ 32degreesF + 3 olives.</p>
        <p>Stir. Do not shake, as turbidity will increase specific heat, thus bruising the compound.</p>
        <p>Mr. Helal was born into a Muslim family in Bangladesh. And as a Muslim, he admits that he is technically prohibited from handling alcohol.</p>
        <p>But there is a rational explanation here. It seems that he is something of a scientist,  with a doctorate in boozelogical studies.</p>
        <p>''I mix, therefore I'm a chemist.''</p>
