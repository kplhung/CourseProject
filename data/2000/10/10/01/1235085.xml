        <p>14 WALL STREET RESTAURANT  *  [Rating: One Star]  (212) 233-2780; 14 Wall Street, between Broadway and Broad Street, 31st floor; $$$; smoking permitted; all major credit cards.</p>
        <p>The former bachelor apartment of J. P. Morgan is divided into three dining rooms and a bar with mahogany paneling, all with the staid air of a private club overlooking the financial district. Appetizers include poached foie gras ''au Torchon,'' with marinated grapes, oxtail jelly and country toast; salmon tartare  with fennel and artichoke puree and chips; and sauteed crab cake with ginger cole slaw and mustard sauce.  Entrees include grilled lime shrimp over fennel and haricot vert salad, orange dressing and honey-glazed grapefruit; grilled dry-aged steak with five-pepper sauce and pommes frites; and honey-glazed duck breast over spinach and raw mushroom salad, fresh goat cheese and melon tartare.

        <p>BAYARD'S  **  [Rating: Two Stars]  (212) 514-9454; 1 Hanover Square, between Pearl and Stone Streets; $$$; smoking in the lounge; all major credit cards.</p>
        <p>When Harry Poulakakos, who also owns Harry's of Hanover Square, opened Bayard's in December 1998, he knew he had history on his hands. The building was erected in 1851 as a bank. Later it became the New York Cotton Exchange. In 1914, it was turned into India House, a businessmen's club, which continues to meet there during the day. Current appetizers include chilled English pea soup that is garnished with apple-wood-smoked codfish; warm chanterelle salad with mesclun greens and hazelnut vinaigrette; and soft shell crab with a garlic chive vinaigrette. Entree choices include roasted rack of lamb with eggplant caviar, potato gratin and sauce Nicoise; grilled Dover sole with sauteed spinach and mustard sauce; and roasted veal medallions with wild mushroom cream and fettuccine. (Review: 3/ 10/99)</p>
        <p>HARRY'S OF HANOVER SQUARE  ++  (212) 425-3412; 1 Hanover Square, at Pearl and Stone Streets; $$$; smoking at the bar; all major credit cards.</p>
        <p>This restaurant and saloon, long a landmark for Wall Street workers, is fittingly housed in the landmark India House (one floor below Bayard's). Harry's wine cellar, which is considered to be one of the best in New York City, is known for its low prices for normally expensive wines. Appetizers include baked clams oreganato; prosciutto with lemon; fresh mozzarella with sliced tomatoes and fresh basil; and smoked Nova Scotia salmon. Entrees include veal saltimbocca with prosciutto and mozzarella cheese; grilled French lamb chops; aged prime sirloin steak; grilled or blackened swordfish steak; and jumbo shrimp sauteed fra diavolo with penne. (Article: 4/30/99)</p>
        <p>VINE *  [Rating: One Star]  (212) 344-8463; 25 Broad Street, between South and Water Streets; $$$; smoking at the bar; all major credit cards.</p>
        <p>Vine is pleasant, airy and woody, with views of the New York Stock Exchange out the tall front windows. Appetizers include grilled Maine shrimp, steamed bok choy, Thai curry and coconut; salad of Maryland crab with mango creme fraiche; and pan-seared ocean scallops, warm asparagus salad and truffle vinaigrette. Main dishes include crispy sea bass, Maine shrimp and littleneck clams with sweet onion ragout; Maine lobster, harvest corn fritters with Sauternes chive broth; and porterhouse steak, basil mashed potatoes, crisp Maui onions and Bordelaise sauce. (Review: 6/14/00)</p>
        <p>WILD BLUE  *  (Rating: one star]  (212) 524-7107; 1 World Trade Center, between Liberty and Vesey Streets; $$$; smoking at the bar and lounge; all major credit cards.</p>
        <p>There's enthusiasm to spare at this intimate restaurant designed by Larry Bogdanow in the space once occupied by Cellar in the Sky, atop the World Trade Center. The American menu walks the thin line between simple and austere. Appetizers include buttermilk-fried oysters, smoky chipotle cream and spoon bread; chanterelle mushrooms with a lobster salad and roast beet vinaigrette; and yellowtail carpaccio, radish salad and a sea urchin vinaigrette. Main courses include slow-roasted Pacific salmon and wild mushroom emulsion; American lamb T-bone chops with crisp onion strings; and Atlantic skate with green pea risotto and brown butter.
