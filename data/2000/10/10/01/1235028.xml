        <p>WHO is Mae Browne?  She's the grandmother of Kathleen Zadrozny, the owner of a new Huntington Station restaurant. Her wedding photo (circa 1934) graces the foyer of this namesake restaurant.</p>
        <p>Mae Browne, indeed anyone's grandmother, would feel comfortable in the elegant, traditional dining room. The shiny walnut and cherry floors of the foyer give way to plush carpeting there. Ceilings are an attractive combination of mahogany beams and tapestry covered acoustic panels. All these sound-absorbing surfaces make table conversation a joy. (There is a second dining room upstairs as well as two small rooms for parties of 8 to 14 people.)</p>

        <p>WHO is Mae Browne?  She's the grandmother of Kathleen Zadrozny, the owner of a new Huntington Station restaurant. Her wedding photo (circa 1934) graces the foyer of this namesake restaurant.</p>
        <p>Mae Browne, indeed anyone's grandmother, would feel comfortable in the elegant, traditional dining room. The shiny walnut and cherry floors of the foyer give way to plush carpeting there. Ceilings are an attractive combination of mahogany beams and tapestry covered acoustic panels. All these sound-absorbing surfaces make table conversation a joy. (There is a second dining room upstairs as well as two small rooms for parties of 8 to 14 people.)</p>
        <p>Decoration runs to gilt-framed mirrors, hanging tapestries and charming paintings with a hint of Art Deco style. Brocade is featured in the draperies at the windows and the vests of the staff.</p>
        <p>Despite the positive first impressions generated by these surroundings, the picture is not all rosy. Members of the serving crew are not as sharp as their snappy weskits. On one visit the team worked with clock-like precision. Another time, though, there were slowdowns and service gaps: no additional rolls were offered after the first round was eaten; a water spill (including melting ice cubes) was never wiped up; and an unreasonably long wait occurred between openers and entrees. Our waiter on both occasions seemed indifferent and exuded no warmth.</p>
        <p>Ms. Zadrozny, however, was charming. She is also the owner of Aegean East, a popular Greek spot in Hicksville. The food at Mae Browne's is a half a world away from Greece.  The menu reads like a culinary map of the United States: Maine diver sea scallops, ahi tuna with Asian overtones, Hudson Valley foie gras and Maryland blue-claw crab cakes.</p>
        <p>Those four dishes illustrate the kitchen's successes and failures. The scallops, four big beauties perched on a tasty lemon-parsley risotto, and the very rare slices of sushi-quality tuna mated with a crisp spring roll and a nest of seaweed salad show the chef at the top of his game. The foie gras, a $20 appetizer one night and an opener bearing a $10 supplementary price on a fixed price weekend menu, was a disappointment. The portion was skimpy and the pink peppercorn-sauterne-caramel sauce was unrelentingly sweet. The crab cake had more filler than crab.</p>
        <p>Prices are steep. There is just one a la carte entree under $24 (chicken at $19). On the weekend, only a three-course $55 meal is offered. One of our party was an elderly woman with a tiny appetite. We asked if she could just order the crab cake for her  meal. Our waiter consented but not with good grace. That night, we were charged $18 for the single crab cake, served atop a bed of mesclun, a dish that goes for $12 on the a la carte list offered other nights.</p>
        <p>Openers I'd order again are the hearts of romaine in a creamy lemon dressing and the Napoleon of tuna tartar sandwiched with crisp won tons.</p>
        <p>The mesclun salad contained very little blue cheese and even less flavor. The Yukon gold potato and truffle soup was tasty enough, but an off-putting skin had formed on top.  Rare slices of venison over hazelnut pappardelle were chewy and drowned in brown gravy.</p>
        <p>In addition to the outstanding tuna and scallops, a trio of meat dishes won kudos: a velvety filet mignon with cheese-infused mashed potatoes and caramelized endive, roast Long Island duck with rare breast meat and crispy legs in a tangy citrus sauce and thick, juicy slices of loin of veal paired with mustard spaetzle.</p>
        <p>Also-rans include ginger-glazed salmon over noodles and Asian vegetables, which inexplicably had little taste, and equally bland black sea bass atop diced vegetables in an artichoke broth.</p>
        <p>Dessert is the most successful course. Especially winning were a milk chocolate-pecan demisphere with oven-roasted nectarines, a blueberry-almond tart and an unusual ice cream sandwich starring a long slim, nut-studded brownie topped with scoops of cinnamon peach, brandied strawberry and spiced plum ice creams.</p>
        <p>Mae Browne's  257 East Jericho Turnpike, Huntington Station, (631) 424-1131.</p>
