        <p>Violent clashes between Palestinians and Israeli troops left at least 12 Palestinians dead and hundreds wounded in the third day of fierce fighting set off by the defiant visit on Thursday of a right-wing Israeli leader, Ariel Sharon, to the steps of the ancient mosques atop Jerusalem's Old City.</p>
        <p>The fighting today, on the first day of the Jewish New Year, an Israeli national holiday that is commemorated as a time for quiet reflection and prayer, was among the bloodiest confrontations between Israelis and Palestinians in recent years.</p>
        <p>The violence, which began in Jerusalem, spread today from the northern edge of the West Bank to the end of Gaza Strip, escalating in two places into gun battles between Palestinians and Israeli security forces. Palestinian youths burned tires and bombarded Israeli soldiers and the police with rocks and firebombs; Israeli troops responded variously with tear gas, rubber bullets and live ammunition.</p>
        <p>The Israeli military said tonight that seven soldiers had been ''lightly wounded'' by rocks in the disturbances today. At least 16 Palestinians have been killed and hundreds injured in the last three days.</p>
        <p>Prime Minister Ehud Barak said in a statement that he spoke with the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, tonight ''and stressed the importance of Arafat's immediate personal involvement to stop the violence.'' They agreed that ''senior security officials from both sides will be in constant contact for the purpose of restoring calm,'' the statement said.</p>
        <p>Still, with the death toll rising, there were fears that the violence may quash hopes for a quick resumption of the peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians. Negotiators returned from Washington on Thursday after parallel talks with State Department officials that both sides called inconclusive.</p>
        <p>''We will have funerals tomorrow, and the situation is still tense and explosive,'' Nabil Aburdaineh, a senior adviser to Mr. Arafat, said tonight. ''This tension will negatively affect the peace process.''</p>
        <p>Palestinian and Israeli security forces engaged in a fierce gun battle for more than an hour at the entrance to Netzarim, one of several Jewish settlements in the Gaza Strip.  A Palestinian policeman was killed in the crossfire, witnesses and officials in Gaza said.</p>
        <p>An ambulance driver and a 12-year-old boy were also killed.</p>
        <p>The boy was filmed by a foreign television crew as he cowered behind a cement block with his father, who shouted at the Israeli soldiers to hold their fire. The ambulance driver was killed as he tried to rescue the boy.</p>
        <p>The excruciating scene, including boy's screams as he was hit by the fatal gunfire and the father's cries of horror, was broadcast on Israeli and Palestinian television tonight.</p>
        <p>''This is a killing in cold blood, an attack on an innocent child without any excuse,'' Mr. Aburdaineh said. ''This cannot be forgiven.''</p>
        <p>There was little reaction from Israelis, many of whom spent the day strolling to synagogues and family gatherings on the Rosh Hashana holiday that represents a conscious break from the usual national preoccupation with hourly news reports.</p>
        <p>Eight Palestinians, including two policemen, were killed in a chaotic confrontation with Israeli troops outside Nablus, on the West Bank, Palestinian officials said. Hundreds of protesters there attacked an Israeli army checkpoint with rocks and homemade firebombs, Israeli army officials said. The officials said the troops fired live ammunition only after being hit by rifle fire from Palestinian policemen.</p>
        <p>More than 200 Palestinians were reported wounded in the bloody Gaza clash, which erupted from demonstrations protesting Mr. Sharon's visit to the mosques on Thursday morning and the storming of the Muslim religious site on Friday afternoon by heavily armed Israeli troops.</p>
        <p>The Gaza protesters, many of them sympathizers of the radical fundamentalist Hamas movement, directed their fury not just at Mr. Sharon, but also at Mr. Arafat, ripping up posters of the Palestinian leader.</p>
        <p>In East Jerusalem, Palestinian protesters fought sporadically with Israeli troops throughout the day, and a teen-age boy was killed during a clash with Israeli forces near Ramallah.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak told Mr. Arafat that Israel ''will not allow the violence to serve as a negotiating tool,'' the statement from his office said.</p>
        <p>The prime minister also spoke today by telephone with President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, who was meeting in Cairo with Mr. Arafat, Mr. Barak's office said. Mr. Mubarak had lashed out Friday at what he called ''provocative Israeli actions'' at Jerusalem's Islamic holy sites. The Egyptian foreign minister, Amr Moussa, said tonight that Israel and the Palestinians are now ''at a very critical stage of the peace process, and we hope it will make progress, but with these actions it will never advance.''</p>
        <p>In Washington, P. J. Crowley, a White House spokesman, said American officials were talking to both sides at the highest levels and asking them to end the violence. ''Issues have to be resolved at the negotiating table and not in the streets,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Israel's army chief, Shaul Mofaz, said in a statement that he had spoken with two Palestinian security chiefs, Mohammed Dahalan and Jibril Rajoub, and ''we agreed that the Palestinians will cease fire in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.''  Osama al-Ali, a senior Palestinian security official, said the Israelis and Palestinians had agreed mutually to ''exert maximum effort to stop the fire.''</p>
        <p>The Israeli army today ordered the evacuation of Jewish worshippers from the Western Wall, the site of rock-throwing attacks by Palestinian youths yesterday. Army helicopters criss-crossed the skies and troops blocked Israeli access to what are normally heavily traveled crossing points into the West Bank.</p>
        <p>In Arab East Jerusalem, and in Palestinian-ruled cities in Gaza and the West Bank, Palestinians called a general strike today to protest the Israeli incursion on Friday into the Old City plaza that Jews call the Temple Mount and Muslims call the Noble Sanctuary.</p>
        <p>The fighting between Palestinians and Israeli security forces since Thursday is the worst sustained violence the area has seen since riots erupted in 1996 after Israel opened an ancient tunnel deep beneath the plaza. The Western Wall, the most sacred place of worship to Jews because of its proximity to where the last Jewish temple is believed to have stood two millennia ago, is part of the foundation of the great raised courtyard, now dominated by the seventh-century mosque the Dome of the Rock.</p>
        <p>Though Israel asserts sovereignty over the site, its security forces normally stay on the plaza's walled perimeter. Internal policing is handled by Palestinian Authority officials and by the Islamic clerics who exercise religious control over the mosques and surrounding courtyard.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sharon, who obtained Israeli police permission to lead a delegation from his rightist opposition Likkud party to the plaza, has vociferously objected to suggestions that a peace pact might give an independent Palestine state whole or partial sovereignty over the site.</p>
        <p>His visit infuriated Palestinians, who continue to associate Mr. Sharon with the massacres of Palestinian refugees in Lebanon two decades ago, and who are united in demanding control over what is considered the third most sacred site in Islam.</p>
        <p>On Israeli television tonight, Mr. Sharon denied that it was his visit that had touched off violence. ''It was not my visit that lit the fire, but Palestinian incitement,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak did not comment on Thursday about Mr. Sharon's action, nor did he on this holiday, when domestic politics is traditionally given a rest. And neither he nor his associates publicly linked the violence to the Likud leader's Temple Mount visit.</p>
        <p>The scenes of heavily armed Israeli riot troops storming the plaza as it was packed with worshippers, shown on Palestinian television on Friday night and in Palestinian newspapers this morning, enraged many in the West Bank and Gaza.</p>
        <p>In Gaza City, protesters marched this morning from a local university, converging on a heavily fortified Israeli army outpost outside the Netzarim Jewish settlement. As Israeli troops hidden behind their protective barricades opened fire on bands of rock-throwing student demonstrators, the sirens of the ambulances that began converging on the scene attracted even larger crowds, witnesses said.</p>
        <p>Israeli army spokesmen said the troops came under live fire from the Palestinian police. But television footage of the incident, including the shooting of the 12-year-old boy, and the absence of any serious Israeli casualties, served to reinforce the Palestinians' belief that the Israelis were responding with disproportionate force.</p>
        <p>Miguel Angel Moratinos, the European Union envoy to the Middle East, condemned the violence in Gaza and the West Bank after a meeting in Cairo today with Mr. Arafat, and expressed his condolences to the families of those killed.</p>
        <p>''This is a sad day for everyone who is working to achieve peace,'' he said. ''We are shocked by these violent actions.''</p>
