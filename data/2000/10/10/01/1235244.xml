        <p>For more than two decades, Southside Johnny Lyon and the Asbury Jukes have epitomized the mix of rock 'n' roll and blues that made the New Jersey shore music scene famous. Some of the best musicians from in and around Asbury Park have honed their skills with the Jukes and gone on to develop regional, and even national, followings of their own.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lyon and the Jukes will headline the second night of a two-night concert event at the Commerce Bank Ballpark in Bridgewater next Saturday. Also appearing that night are stars of 1970's rock 'n' roll, David Clayton-Thomas and Blood, Sweat and Tears, and Felix Cavaliere's Rascals.</p>
