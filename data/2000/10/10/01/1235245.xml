        <p>Westfield Symphony Orchestra will open season with Beethoven's Triple Concerto in partnership program with Arbor Chamber Music Society (M)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The concerto takes its name from a word meaning together, as, in concert. In most concertos, togetherness is furnished by a soloist with an orchestra, whose combined artistry makes or breaks the performance. But togetherness in Beethoven's Triple Concerto involves not one soloist but three. The solo trio for this concerto, with which the Westfield Symphony Orchestra opens its 10th season Saturday, was chosen from the roster of the Arbor Chamber Music Society, based in Summit.</p>
        <p>The Rahway concert says more than one thing about making music together. It is the first event in the orchestra's and Arbor's three-year partnership, the purpose of which is to share and expand audiences. Each group has its own separate schedule, and this is the season's only joint event. But other related projects are in the planning or dreaming phases.</p>

        <p>The outreach theme of the rest of Saturday's concert extends past partnership and community, to outer space. The orchestra, under its director David Wroe, is to play John Williams's ''Suite from 'Star Wars' '' and Gustav Holst's ''The Planets.'' Talk about reaching for the stars.</p>
