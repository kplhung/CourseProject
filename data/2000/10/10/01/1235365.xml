        <p>In a ruling laced with scathing language for the ''improper'' behavior of former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's attorney general said that a six-month review failed to turn up enough evidence to prosecute him on charges of conspiring with a contractor in an illegal kickback scheme, of stealing gifts to the state and of obstructing justice. Mr. Netanyahu said he was ''relieved, relieved, relieved.'' It is unclear whether he will seize the moment to re-establish himself at the head of Israel's right wing, which has splintered since he stepped down after his overwhelming defeat in May 1999 by Ehud Barak.</p>
