        <p>IF Al Gore and George W. Bush really want to win over millions of Americans in their first debate on Tuesday night, they might dispense with the briefing books, give their policy advisers the weekend off and get some tips from a pro: Mark Burnett, the executive producer of the megahit television show ''Survivor.''</p>
        <p>The candidates, he counsels, should bare their true selves and personalities and never try to hoodwink the public. ''What we learned from 'Survivor' is how clever and cerebral the viewers are,'' Mr. Burnett said. ''If the politicians in these debates think they're pulling the wool over the American people's eyes, they're crazy.''</p>
        <p>Such advice may sound suspect coming from the man responsible for staging authenticity on a so-called reality-based TV series. Even so, as the candidates seek to distinguish themselves on issues, the truth is that viewers tend to remember debates not for the positions, but for the theater.</p>
        <p>Let's face it: the debates are TV shows, not altogether different from ''Oprah,'' ''Larry King Live'' and the other preferred venues of candidates this season. Debates are about a politician's likability, apparent candor and ability to function under the glare of klieg lights -- not to mention the glares of millions of Americans. Sometimes all it takes is an arsenal of well-crafted one-liners, and knowing when to spring them.</p>
        <p>Yet for all the attention to scripted political performances, Americans are looking for the unscripted moment. They want a glimpse of the ''real'' man who would be president, and how he will react when cornered or knocked off balance.</p>
        <p>''I don't think anybody in America who watches debates can tell you what they debated about,'' said Don Hewitt, creator of  ''60 Minutes,'' who produced the first presidential debates 40 years ago. ''I was at the first one when we elected a president because he looked better than the other guy. While that's great for Atlantic City when you pick Miss America, I'm not sure that's the way you should elect a president.''</p>
        <p>Richard G. Darman, who was President George Bush's budget director and was involved in Republican debate preparations in the 1980, 1984, 1988 and 1992 campaigns, said the focus on style over substance was ''regrettable but may not be such a negative because the electorate is using its intuition to judge values, character and personality.''</p>
        <p>''Those are actually very relevant things,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The fate of Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush could come down to stagecraft, performance skills and this all-important question: Which guy more looks (and acts) like he belongs in the Oval Office?</p>
        <p>Here, then, are some pitfalls the candidates should watch out for as their big moment in Boston approaches.</p>
        <p>Don't Be Someone Else</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore does not have the fraternity boy persona of Mr. Bush and he should not pretend he does. But unlike Mr. Gore, Mr. Bush does not revel in policy minutia and  should not act like he does.</p>
        <p>''The key to debate is to play to your strengths and not change who you are,'' said Jordan Factor, a 2000 graduate of Brandeis University who won the national championship of the American Parliamentary Debate Association. ''Bush should come across being a nice guy and the kind of guy you'd want to sit around and have a beer with. He should tell jokes and stories about his life in Midland. The tip I'd give Gore is to recognize that he is a serious guy and that's O.K.''</p>
        <p>''And if he wants to stay stiff,'' the 22-year-old Mr. Factor added, ''he should stay stiff because that's him.''</p>
        <p>Don't Pull a Lazio</p>
        <p>Candidates have to be as mindful of their physical movements as they are of their words. That lesson escaped Representative Rick Lazio in his recent debate with Hillary Rodham Clinton, his rival in the Senate race in New York. Mr. Lazio was portrayed as a bully for leaving his lectern, confronting Mrs. Clinton and gesturing at her as he demanded she sign a pledge not to use  unregulated campaign money.</p>
        <p>Yet candidates should not be paralyzed either. In a 1976 debate between Mr. Ford and Jimmy Carter, the sound gave out for 27 minutes. But the combatants were so afraid of making a misstep that they froze -- and looked powerless and trapped.</p>
        <p>President Clinton skillfully used body language against Bob Dole in San Diego four years ago. To unnerve Mr. Dole -- and frighten him into not upbraiding the president's character -- Mr. Clinton stared at his opponent and kept inching closer to him. It worked; Mr. Dole was rather tame. As for Mr. Dole, ''One of the weighty matters on his mind was when he would walk out from the lectern,'' said Nelson Warfield, his press secretary. ''That mundane detail occupied much detail and analysis.''</p>
        <p>Don't Lapse Into Old Habits</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush was fairly successful in keeping his smirk in check during the primary debates. Now, the biggest thing he has to watch is his tendency to mangle words.</p>
        <p>Mary Ellen Doran-Quine, a speech pathologist in Reston, Va., said Mr. Bush should not be too jumpy in responding. ''Sometimes he doesn't think before he talks,'' she said. ''If he pauses just a millisecond or two, he probably could prevent some of that. Bush could also open up his mouth a little bit more to get more resonance. He has a pinched nasal quality to his voice.''</p>
        <p>By contrast, she said, Mr. Gore ''has a very nice voice quality -- voice is the element of seduction.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore has his own issues. Ms. Doran-Quine said the vice president is so steeped in policy that he would be better off not to cram. ''I would never memorize anything if I were him,'' she said. ''It sounds like it's rehearsed.''</p>
        <p>Another concern for Mr. Gore is that he must control his inclination to verge on condescension. Mr. Burnett, the Survivor producer, said he learned this from his program: ''Don't overexplain things. You don't need to talk on a child's level.''</p>
        <p>Don't Be Afraid to Correct Mistakes</p>
        <p>When President Ford asserted in a 1976 debate that Poland was not under Soviet domination, he passed up chances to correct himself. It could be he did not realize he was mistaken. But candidates can prevent damaging publicity if they correct themselves or rethink an ill-considered response.</p>
        <p>Peter Jennings, the ABC News anchor who moderated a presidential debate in the primaries, said Mr. Gore could have saved himself from negative media coverage if he had backtracked on his statement that he would favor a litmus test for military leaders to ensure they would allow gays in the military. ''He could have said, 'Peter, I want to reconsider my answer about that question of gays in the military,' '' Mr. Jennings said. ''That would have stopped everyone dead. When I get in trouble on television, I try to share with viewers why we make a mistake.''</p>
        <p>Yet the concede-your-flaws strategy has risks. In pointing out a misstatement or blunder to millions, a politician could highlight something that may never have been noticed.</p>
        <p>Don't Be Shy About Looking Your Best</p>
        <p>His opponents mocked Mr. Dole four years ago for working on his tan in Florida in the days leading up to his debates with President Clinton. But if there was any lesson from Richard M. Nixon and his legendary five o'clock shadow in the first presidential debate of 1960, it was that appearances count. In the case of Mr. Dole, who was 73, his aides said the tan made him look more fit, particularly since he was appearing alongside a rival who was only 50.</p>
        <p>''You don't want to look like you've just performed in the George Hamilton tan-off,'' said Sig Rogich, an image consultant for President Reagan in 1984 and later for President Bush. ''But you certainly want to look your best. Let's not forget they are performing before the American people.''</p>
        <p>Don't Get Too Nervous</p>
        <p>''Tension city,'' is how former President Bush recently described presidential debates to Jim Lehrer of PBS, the moderator again this year.</p>
        <p>To calm down, Mr. Gore is famous for strenuous workouts before debates. Mr. Warfield said he kept Mr. Dole ''locked down'' four years ago ''to keep him insulated from last-minute suggestions.'' He explained, ''The last thing you want to do is have someone come up with a bold idea that could bomb.''</p>
        <p>Many experts advised the candidates to disregard the age-old advice that they pretend they are addressing a roomful (in this case, nation-ful) of naked people. ''That never works and it only distracts you,'' said Mr. Factor, the college champion. Instead, he said, ''picture yourself at your inauguration. Always keep the goal in sight.''</p>
        <p>The actor Warren Beatty, who has played a president in the movies, questioned the premise of this article. ''You're calling a guy in Hollywood who flirts with people and asking him, 'What should these guys do to look pretty?' '' he said. ''In a theatrical sense, whether someone should wear a gray shirt with a pink tie should be put aside. What is important in these debates is what is said.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Beatty's advice? ''Go back to the play itself,'' he said. ''Stop thinking about the costumes and the makeup. And just turn on the lights.''</p>
