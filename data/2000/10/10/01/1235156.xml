        <p>When garter snakes slithered through the lobby of a Wall Street office building early last month, workers were understandably terrified.</p>
        <p>''People were doing 100-yard dashes to get to the door,'' said Timothy Faison, a security guard at the Water Street Towers on Maiden Lane. ''It was ridiculous.''</p>
        <p>The snakes were an unexpected part of a series of seven art installations made of shredded tires, which the artist, Steven Siegel, had assembled in his studio in Dutchess County, north of New York City. But unknown to anyone, garter snakes had laid eggs inside the tires. When the eggs hatched, the reptiles wiggled out.</p>
        <p>Mr. Siegel, an environmental artist, said the sculptures were intended to illustrate the relationship between humans and natural resources. But many people who saw the snakes thought he was making a statement about Bridgestone/Firestone, the company that is recalling 6.5 million tires that have been linked to more than 100 deaths.</p>
        <p>''I certainly had not intended to link the Firestone crisis with the evils associated with snakes,'' said Mr. Siegel, who did not remember what brand of tires he used. ''My own message got carried a step further than I intended.'' He acknowledged that he had noticed a few snakes crawling near the sculptures while he was constructing them. He also remembers seeing a snake when he installed the work. Still, he said, he had no idea that the creatures had actually nested inside the tires.</p>
        <p>When the building's owner learned of the incident, the sculptures were quickly removed and replaced by eight works constructed of newspaper, which Mr. Siegel had made in an indoor work space. And for the artist, the incident was not a total disaster.</p>
        <p>''I never thought about using live animals in my work before,'' he said. ''But who knows? Maybe that's coming next.''</p>
