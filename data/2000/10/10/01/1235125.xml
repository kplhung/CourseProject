        <p>Courtney Weaver, a writer, and Simon James Frankel, a lawyer, were married yesterday at their home in San Francisco. Judge Pierre N. Leval of the United States Court of Appeals in Manhattan, for whom the bridegroom had been a clerk, officiated.</p>
        <p>Ms. Weaver, 34, is keeping her name. She is the author of ''Unzipped'' (Doubleday, 1999), a book about dating and relationships. She graduated from Brown University and received a master's degree in creative writing from New York University. Her mother, Dianne Weaver, lives in San Francisco and is a principal in Town &amp; Company-Morgan Lane, a real estate company there. Her father, David Weaver, who also lives in San Francisco, is a lawyer.</p>
        <p>Mr. Frankel, 37, is an associate at Howard, Rice, Nemerovski, Canady, Falk &amp; Rabkin, a San Francisco law firm specializing in intellectual property. He is a summa cum laude graduate of Harvard University and received a Master of Philosophy degree from Cambridge University, where he was a National Science Foundation fellow in the history and philosophy of science, and also a law degree from Yale Law School.</p>
        <p>His parents, Louise and James B. Frankel, live in San Francisco. His father retired from Cooper, White &amp; Cooper, a law firm there, to which he was of counsel.</p>
        <p>It is not often that a date begins with a request for a nondisclosure statement, even if made in jest. But in this case, a lawyer was going out with a former sex and dating columnist. (She wrote a column on sex and dating for Salon, an online magazine, from 1996 to 1998.)</p>
        <p>Ms. Weaver's mother's best friend, Susan McBride, was selling Mr. Frankel a house in late 1998, and thought he and Ms. Weaver might be a good match.</p>
        <p>But Ms. Weaver was a little taken aback when told of Mr. Frankel's profession. ''My mother's friend said: 'No, he is a good lawyer. Art law. He's not running after handicapped kids looking for money.' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Frankel, for his part, was intrigued, and cautious. ''I didn't want to wind up fodder for one of her columns,'' he explained.</p>
        <p>They played telephone tag for two weeks trying to fit a dinner into their schedules. Finally, Mr. Frankel suggested a date to which Ms. Weaver agreed. Then he said he was only 80 percent sure that he could make it.</p>
        <p>''Why don't you call me when you are 100 percent sure,'' Ms. Weaver said she told him.</p>
        <p>She then e-mailed a message to a close friend, in which she referred to Mr. Frankel as ''Mr. 80 Percent.'' A few phone attempts later, Ms. Weaver left a message on Mr. Frankel's answering machine suggesting that they just aim for coffee.</p>
        <p>''I felt I had been demoted,'' Mr. Frankel said. He quickly called to make a firm dinner arrangement.</p>
        <p>Their meeting, at a Thai restaurant on a rainy January evening in 1999, went well. They impressed each other favorably in the charm and wit departments. And Ms. Weaver assured Mr. Frankel that he would not need a nondisclosure statement.</p>
        <p>''When I got home, I e-mailed the same friend,'' she recalled. ''I said I didn't know if there was a love connection, but I could talk to him for the rest of my life.''</p>
