        <p>WHEN the documentary filmmaker Ken Burns announced his plans for a series on jazz, Matt Glaser, a violinist who had played on the soundtracks of Mr. Burn's ''Civil War'' and ''Baseball,'' started pestering him about being included in the new film. Mr. Burns ignored him. Mr. Glaser insisted. Finally he came to Mr. Burns's apartment one night and pressured him into hearing his spiel about one of Louis Armstrong's recordings of ''Lazy River.''</p>
        <p>''He came in and did this extraordinary thing, talking and singing while the music was going,'' Mr. Burns said, ''and immediately I knew that we were on to something new, something that had never been filmed before.'' Mr. Burns asked if Mr. Glaser could repeat his performance in front of a camera for ''Jazz.'' Remembering the evening, Mr. Burns said, ''He's making it come alive and I was jumping around in ecstasy and Matt's saying, 'I told you so, I told you so.' ''</p>
        <p>''Jazz,'' a 10-night, 19-hour documentary that is one of the most highly anticipated programs of the new television season, is full of moments like Mr. Glaser's, striking concatenations of word, music and image. One of the film's commentators will be citing a piece of music, maybe snapping his fingers to mark off the time and singing the melody and part of a solo to underscore a point. It can seem a bit goofy: seeing and hearing someone sing alone before the camera, a weirdly intimate and separate experience from the way the piece is usually heard. Then the original recording wafts onto the soundtrack, in time with the talking head. And what might have been merely nostalgia or scholarship becomes history.</p>
        <p>These convergences might seem serendipitous. But as with jazz, in which years of study are required to reach a level where a performance feels natural and unstudied, Mr. Burns's moments are the product of planning.</p>
        <p>''It's a new level of filmmaking, and I had to hold off using it too much,'' he said. ''We're making room for the music and listening to it on a level we haven't before. There are two parallel tracks, and we're performing a quantum act by merging them.''</p>
        <p>The documentary, which took six years to complete -- and which is already a subject of controversy in the provincial world of jazz -- will be broadcast on PBS beginning Jan. 8. Mr. Burns is calling it the final chapter of an American trilogy that began with ''The Civil War'' and continued with ''Baseball.''</p>
        <p>Though he had heard jazz -- he ran a record store in the late 1960's, and his father had been a jazz fan -- he was always more interested in popular music, rock and rhythm and blues. But once he began working on the film, he often found jazz and all of its ramifications overwhelming. ''On a larger level, I began to understand that an instinct I had had about jazz was right, that it was a very accurate prism through which you could see refracted tendencies of my country,'' he said. ''I found what I wanted, but I didn't expect jazz's story to be so rich. On every level -- mythological, sensual, political and social -- it informed me about who we are as a people. I didn't expect to learn so much.''</p>
        <p>He was particularly touched by Louis Armstrong.</p>
        <p>''He changed my life, he made me a better person,'' Mr. Burns said. ''I had a popular view of Armstrong, but I had no idea how central he was to American music, and simply how great he was.''</p>
        <p>''Jazz,'' reflecting the propensities of Mr. Burns and his writer, Geoffrey C. Ward, subscribes solidly to the Great Man theory of history. The film investigates in some depth the lives of Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Jelly Roll Morton, Sidney Bechet, Bix Biederbecke, Billie Holiday, Charlie Parker, Miles Davis and John Coltrane, among others. The biographical stories circle around, repeating and commenting on one another in a cycle leading from the turn of the last century to the present. More than anything, the stories keep leading back to race.</p>
        <p>''I'm doing this film because I'm interested in race,'' Mr. Burns said. ''Race is the soul of the country, and nowhere is it more evident than in jazz, where a music came out of the black community and with great generosity was shared with the country.''</p>
        <p>Throughout the documentary, race and heroism intersect. For black musicians, heroism was a matter of maintaining elegance and creativity under the constant pressure of demeaning and dangerous laws and practices that could reduce them to the status of children. A commentator quotes Duke Ellington as saying, after an insult, ''I put the energy I would have used in pouting and went off and wrote some blues.'' And the filmmakers have been extraordinarily generous to white musicians, trying to show exactly how difficult it was for them to renounce mainstream white culture and ally themselves aesthetically and emotionally with black culture.</p>
        <p>''When Ken asked me about Paul Whiteman,'' said Gerald Early, the black essayist and scholar whose commentary is a major part of the documentary, ''I was a bit stunned, because I didn't want to reduce the argument to 'Well, whites stole everything,' which has already been said. So it forced me to think a bit more about the subject, to look at what sort of work Whiteman had done to get where he was, and the sort of honesty with which he approached his study. Then you find something essentially American in the position of white musicians also.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ward, a longtime colleague of Mr. Burns's who was a co-writer of ''The Civil War'' and ''Baseball,'' said that he dived into the project in part to erase a series of myths that he feels have infected jazz since its inception. ''I hope that the notion that all jazz musicians are the same, human, comes across in what we made,'' Mr. Ward said. ''I try to make these musicians people, black and white.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Burns mixes filmed performances and interviews with stills, moving from generalizations about the intersection of culture, music and the American community to specific personal anecdotes. Prominent among the commentators are the critics Stanley Crouch, Gary Giddins and Gene Lees, the historians James Lincoln Collier, Albert Murray and Phil Schaap and the musicians Dave Brubeck, Charlie Haden, Jon Hendricks, Arvell Shaw, Clark Terry and, particularly, Wynton Marsalis.</p>
        <p>One commentator tells a story about Ellington's ability to provoke fights between his sidemen, then put them together in a duet, where their anger would bring out an intense performance. As the anecdote is being told, stills show what looks like Ellington doing exactly that.</p>
        <p>In the six years Mr. Burns and his crew spent working on the film, they assembled 2,400 stills, 2,000 film clips, 75 interviews and 500 pieces of recorded music.</p>
        <p>''It took literally millions of decisions,'' Mr. Burns said. ''This whole documentary is a detective story. We'd go to an archival source and find 40 shots we could use, though we'd only have the place for one. Or we'd hear about some stills and spend months looking for them, only to find nothing. Or we'd find something and the owners would want a ransom, hundreds of times more than we normally pay for things, which was often heartbreaking. Or we'd have to convince somebody. For instance, I pestered Norman Granz, who owns some rare footage of Charlie Parker, and finally he relented and was generous.</p>
        <p>''It's hard work, and you never know if you're asking a source the right questions, or if they're holding a gem back for whatever reason.''</p>
        <p>AND Mr. Burns had to face the cantankerous world of jazz, where critics, academics and musicians are divided into hostile camps that can make the Balkans seem like a cradle of good will. It's a world that can divide along any number of lines: the relative virtues of white and black musicians; whether swing and blues are central to the music; whether the term ''jazz'' has any real meaning. Some critics can't stand jazz that doesn't subscribe to rules; others feel music that doesn't break rules is worthless. And among these experts there is an almost pathological lack of generosity. Mr. Burns waded right into the middle of all this, choosing which advice to take and which to ignore.</p>
        <p>''If we had assembled all our advisers and put them into one room, a fight would have broken out,'' Mr. Ward said. ''It's not a documentary that will make jazz experts particularly happy. There's something missing for everyone.''</p>
        <p>For Mr. Early, what was missing was soul jazz: Mr. Burns ignored his suggestion to include this 50's movement that merged elements of black popular music and church culture with jazz, one of the last moments when jazz maintained a large black audience. For Mr. Marsalis, the trumpeter and artistic director of Jazz at Lincoln Center, who is the documentary's primary talking head, what was missing was an attack on fusion.</p>
        <p>''I understand why he treated fusion and the avant-garde the way he did,'' Mr. Marsalis said. ''He let the interviewers deal with it. But if it were up to me I would have taken the movements on.''</p>
        <p>In what is likely to be Mr. Burns's most controversial choice, the documentary dwells on the first 60 years of the music, leaving the years from 1960 to the present to be covered in the final two hours, a fact that is already bouncing around the jazz world and angering many. Jazz has exploded with new movements in those 40 years, and if it lost its footing as a popular music, it did not become any less prolific. But the decision, right or wrong, was the result of careful consideration.</p>
        <p>''I could have used another 12 hours to cover from 1960 to the present,'' Mr. Ward said. ''We chose to focus on the earlier years and not follow all of jazz's later tributaries. And with Ellington and Armstrong and Bix Biederbecke you have titanic figures, terribly important figures. You have to give them their due.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Burns said he saw the modern era, and the definition of a contemporary pantheon, as the province of current critics. ''That being said, I'd hold the final episode as an honorable view of what's gone on,'' he said. ''But I'm not in the business of making judgments about the present. I simply don't know if there are contemporary figures as important as Armstrong or Miles Davis, who belong in the Mount Rushmore of jazz.''</p>
        <p>Finally, to the chagrin of many in the jazz world who see him as contentious and narrow-minded, Mr. Marsalis is, in Mr. Early's words, the documentary's Virgil, guiding the audience through the labyrinth of jazz history.</p>
        <p>''I met Wynton after a speech I gave at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1991,'' said Mr. Burns. ''It was a meeting of the minds. Later, when he heard that I was doing a documentary on jazz, he told me, 'I'll do anything you need.' In one way he's the backbone of the film.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Burns said he didn't worry that Mr. Marsalis's viewpoint would dominate the documentary. ''I choose these influences, but I'm a very strong filmmaker and I want to borrow from all these stories. And finally I make the decisions about what goes into the documentary.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Marsalis sees the documentary as yet another way of advancing jazz's cause in its birthplace. ''I just hope the nation embraces the music after watching the documentary,'' he said. ''I would hope that the nation developed a deeper relationship with the music, with something that we all have in common. I hope young people embrace it. Jazz doesn't need to be exaggerated about. The lives of Miles Davis and Louis Armstrong were real; these are great figures. There's a lot to learn there about ourselves.''</p>
