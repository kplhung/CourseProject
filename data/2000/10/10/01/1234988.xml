A British monarch decided that his gamboling would have a certain je ne sais quoi if housed in a delightfully inauthentic Indian palace in Brighton.</p>
        <p>It's common knowledge that Western art borrowed heavily from Japan in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It's less well known that the West repaid the loan with interest. Japan, abruptly introduced to foreign customs and culture after the mid-19th century, raced to remake itself as a modern nation, which included adapting Western modes of representation. The Japanese learned photography from Western photographers, then modeled their own imagery on examples of Western painting and photography. ''Shinzo and Roso Fukuhara: Photographs by Ginza Modern Boys, 1913-41,'' at Sepia International in Chelsea (through Oct. 14), presents for the first time in New York the work of two brothers who played early roles in the formation of Japanese modernist photography.</p>
        <p>This show of more than 100 images and some printed material is sponsored by Shiseido, the cosmetics company, which has also financed an exhibition on the role of cosmetics in art at the Grey Art Gallery at New York University. ''Ginza Modern Boys'' was selected from the Shiseido Corporate Museum collection by Noriko Fuku, who wrote the accompanying catalog.</p>
        <p>Shinzo and Roso Fukuhara's father founded Shiseido, and Shinzo (1883-1948), as the oldest surviving son, was obligated to follow his father as company president. He could pursue photography only as a sideline yet did so with an energy and effectiveness that might be envied by many a full-time practitioner. In the early 1920's he and his brother organized an amateur photographers' group, he founded a photography magazine that once featured female Japanese photographers (a previously undiscovered species), and he was the first to try to formulate a theory of photography in Japan. By the 30's, he was promoting the use of photography in advertisements for his company.</p>
        <p>In the 1920's Shinzo Fukuhara denounced Pictorialist photography for imitating painting. His own photography, most of it destroyed in the great earthquake of 1923, began to shift from a dreamy, soft-focus Impressionism -- an isolated stroller whose face is obscured by shadow, bridges that melt under massed tones of gray -- to more rectilinear arrangements of stairs and pilasters and walls. The work of the 30's is sharp and geometric enough for entry into the modernist club yet never insistently or strictly stripped down; Shinzo always harbored an affection for soft effects, tonal gradations, ragged shadows, blurred backgrounds. Other Japanese photographers went much farther down the modernist road than either of the Fukuharas.</p>
        <p>Roso Fukuhara (1892-1946), the younger brother, did not have to work and seems to have pretty much devoted himself to his camera. His style is more spare and unsparing than Shinzo's (and to my mind lovelier as well as more challenging). A single, calligraphic branch of wisteria loops down before an empty sky to meet a small, blurry patch of leaves rising up in the distance. The imprint of tradition is often, and beautifully, evident in his landscapes.</p>
        <p>Ms. Fuku's catalog says that Roso Fukuhara's work was not published in his lifetime, yet he was a pioneer of photographic modernism: a rather startling combination. He played with space in cunning ways. In ''Sangatsudo'' (1938), he photographed a roof in the lower half of the frame, then an oddly shaped section of sky, bounded on the upper edge by a line of silhouetted dentils that appear to hang down. In fact they are protruding from the edge of another roof so close that the photographer (and, by extension, the viewer) must be standing underneath it.</p>
        <p>As Ms. Fuku spells out, the Fukuharas' work illumines the interchange of Japanese and Western styles. A bit of background first: after the Meiji Restoration of 1868, the Japanese were so determined to westernize that they consulted European constitutions before devising one of their own and introduced the study of Western culture in public schools.</p>
        <p>Japanese artists, hugely impressed by the realism of European painting (and dumbfounded by that of photography), examined Western styles intently. An art school with Italian instructors opened in Japan in the 1870's; an exhibition of English photography was held in 1892. The Ginza district of Tokyo became the center of arts and modern life, a place where the most up-to-date (meaning, basically, westernized) Ginza modern boys hung out with Ginza modern girls.</p>
        <p>WHILE the Japanese were trying to learn Western ways of representation, Japanese prints were casting a spell on Impressionism, Art Nouveau and painters like Mary Cassatt and Edgar Degas. Influences kept flowing back and forth. By the first decade of the 20th century, it was clear that Alfred Stieglitz, Edward Steichen and other photographers knew Japanese prints and equally clear that Japanese photographers knew Impressionist paintings.</p>
        <p>The cross-cultural influences were so strong in Japan that they threatened to overwhelm the traditional arts, and a Westerner made some of the first efforts to rescue them. Ernest Fenellosa, an American, went to Japan in 1878 to teach philosophy, and he took a hand in trying to preserve the country's traditions without giving up the new-found sense of contemporaneity.</p>
        <p>Now the story gets a little complicated. In 1890, Fenellosa was appointed the first curator of Japanese art at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts; there, he introduced Arthur Wesley Dow, an American artist, to Japanese prints. Dow wrote an artists' manual emphasizing Japanese principles of composition and taught art at the Pratt Institute and Columbia University in New York from 1895 to 1922.</p>
        <p>Shinzo Fukuhara, who earned a degree in pharmacology at Columbia in 1912 and was interested in combining Western innovation with Japanese tradition, came to admire the American photographer Alvin Langdon Coburn, who had studied Japanese art at a school founded by Dow and had added Japanese tradition to Western innovation. Shinzo often published Coburn's work opposite his own in his magazine, and his photographic group mounted an exhibition of Coburn's photographs in Japan in the early 20's. What may have been particularly appealing in Coburn's art was an element of familiarity, an attitude and intent the Japanese recognized as akin to their own.</p>
        <p>In 1923, the great Kanto earthquake devastated Tokyo and spurred the Japanese to modernize at a breakneck pace. Tokyo rebuilt with concrete, steel and skyscrapers. Photography magazines and photographically illustrated magazines proliferated, making Western imagery ever more available; the Japanese were especially intrigued by Laszlo Moholy-Nagy.</p>
        <p>In 1931, ''Film und Foto,'' the international photography exhibition organized in Stuttgart, Germany, traveled to Tokyo and Osaka. Japanese photographers tried out the mechanical, architectural, graphically ordered styles the West had already initiated in honor of the machine age and were included more and more often in exhibitions in the West.</p>
        <p>If the show at Sepia is representative, the Fukuhara brothers, born in the 19th century, clung to landscape and details of traditional buildings. At their most modern, they never quite relinquished their ties to Japanese art of the past. They were quite capable of circumventing the camera's built-in perspective system to produce spaces more like those of Japanese screens and scrolls.</p>
        <p>JAPANESE art conceived of empty spaces as positive rather than negative, not merely what is left over between and around objects but every bit as important as solid matter. In Shinzo Fukuhara's ''Light With Its Harmony 8: Pond'' (1924), a tree with leaves that might have been brushed on arcs slowly, horizontally across the top of the frame. The water enclosed by the lines of trunk and branch occupies two thirds of the picture space. Within those lines the pond fairly tilts up on the surface of the image as water so often does in Japanese art, and its outlined shape appears to lean against the curve of the tree.</p>
        <p>In ''Sea at New Year'' (1937), the reciprocal spaces of silvery ocean and sky are separated by irregular hills that are subtly darker but no more solid than the atmosphere and dissolve into swaths of mist. A tiny boat hovers on the surface of the picture like a splotchy swipe of diluted ink.</p>
        <p>In Roso Fukuhara's ''Kamikochi'' (1937), a great flourish of mist between background mountains and frothy trees up front assumes a shape at least as strong and commanding as that of the mountains. In ''Miscanthus'' (1933), reedlike stems, as taut and straight or elegantly scribbled as pen strokes, stand up before mountain ranges so pale and delicate that they function as tonal washes applied to a vertical backdrop. Pictures like these, immediately recognizable as ''Japanese'' but encompassing the dual discoveries of the ancient East and the modern West, strike me as the most beautiful in the show.</p>
        <p>As Japan underwent chaotic changes in the 1920's and 30's -- modernization, industrialization, militarization -- Shinzo and Roso Fukuhara continued to produce images of peace and quiet that negotiated alliances between the old dispensation and the new. In their way they denied what much of the world still believed: that the twain would never meet.</p>
        <p>The twain insist on meeting and have done so repeatedly in the realm of art, sitting on an endless loop of intercontinental, interhemispherical influences, where East keeps sliding into West and veering off to north or south or directions not yet mapped.</p>
