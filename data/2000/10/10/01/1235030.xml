        <p>BANDAGED and bruised, one of the two Mexican immigrant workers from Farmingville who were recently lured to an abandoned building and then attacked was afraid to show his face. ''I guess that's the price you have to pay for the American dream,'' he was quoted as saying about the attempt to murder him.</p>
        <p>As a Hispanic, my stomach heaved: I was angered by his sense of resignation, but I understood it, too. As an American, I was shocked that anyone would think that the risk of murder is the price of entry into my country. As an East Ender, I realized he was right.</p>
        <p>It's simple economics. Many of us on the East End are feeling flush these days. We want to perfect our American dream, but on the cheap. So we hire immigrant labor to build the decks on which we barbecue, the pools we play in and the family rooms we gather in. We pay them a low wage -- they seem to be satisfied -- and we consider the transaction complete when they disappear.</p>
        <p>But it's not. In economic terms we haven't captured all the costs.</p>
        <p>In the case of immigrant workers, most communities on the East End have avoided the full costs associated with maintaining this cheap labor pool. We (or our contractors acting as our agents) want the convenience of disposable labor, people we can hire in the morning and push out of sight after a long day's work. The most efficient way of accomplishing this labor transaction is the same way you buy a quart of milk. You go to a market and select the product you want off the shelf.</p>
        <p>And so it's evolved that day laborers congregate in certain highly visible spots to form ''shape-up lines'' and ply their wares -- themselves.  But because there is no affordable housing in the communities where the laborers actually work, they generally live and gather in communities far away from those of us who hire them. It's as if you hired a gardener and then forced your brother to take him in. The gardener may pay rent, but your brother is going to resent the intrusion.</p>
        <p>This is, in essence, what we have done to working-class hamlets like Farmingville. We have shifted the burden of the housing and dispatching of immigrant labor to them. Formerly homogeneous suburban communities have suddenly seen their lives disrupted so that we can afford to enhance ours.</p>
        <p>This is not to excuse the hate unfurled in recent months by groups like the Sachem Quality of Life Organization. These groups argue that the shape-up lines and the immigrants' crowded housing conditions create health and safety hazards. If this were their real concern, these groups would have accepted the proposal to establish a hiring hall, a proposal backed by Robert J. Gaffney, the Suffolk County executive, among others. Instead, these groups have tried to pervert American values in pursuit of their racist ends.</p>
        <p>They argue that hiring halls offend their civic sensibilities because they condone the illegality of immigrants who have slipped into this country.  Yet in pursuing this argument these groups have nurtured another illegality: attempted murder.</p>
        <p>And in a scene more appropriate to a totalitarian regime than to our Rockwellian vision of small-town American democracy, this same element drowned out a Hispanic witness at a town meeting by chanting the Pledge of Allegiance while marching out of the meeting.</p>
        <p>Working from fear rather than fact, they cited a nonexistent crime wave in order to convince the Suffolk County Legislature to sue the Immigration and Naturalization Service to initiate a witch hunt in which I, a sixth-generation United States citizen, could easily have been rounded up. To its shame, the Legislature almost bought into the ploy, barely defeating the measure by a lone vote.</p>
        <p>The atmosphere of hate that some citizens of Farmingville have fostered cannot be excused or tolerated.  But neither can we excuse ourselves from our role in creating it. We have to recognize that Farmingville, and communities like it, are subsidizing our ''not in my backyard'' views, because they are being forced to house a disproportionate number these workers.</p>
        <p>It's not enough to dismiss Farmingville with a liberal ''tsk, tsk.'' We in surrounding communities must absorb the full cost of the labor that makes it possible to build our McMansions. At minimum, this means establishing hiring halls and evenly distributing them among various communities.</p>
        <p>But more important, we must put an end to the Nimby complex. We must create affordable housing in communities throughout the East End including -- or perhaps most especially -- in overheated real estate markets like the Hamptons. It also means accepting these workers as neighbors in our communities after the workday ends rather than carting them off as chattel to pens in other communities each night.</p>
        <p>The American dream is about more than economic opportunity. It's about creating a textured land in which people of various colors come together as a community. That's our great experiment and strength. While we may need to be ready to die in defense of that dream, we cannot tolerate the murder of anyone seeking to join it merely because he is willing to build our own American dreams at a discount.</p>
