        <p>Sammie Henson could not contain his anguish tonight. Moments after losing the gold medal flyweight freestyle wrestling match to Namig Abdullayev of Azerbaijan, 4-3, Henson rushed from the stage and under the bleachers of the exposition hall. Wailing and screaming, he raced past stunned spectators in a 5-foot-4 blur, then fell to the floor sobbing inconsolably and rocking on his back.</p>
        <p>USA Wrestling officials and Olympic volunteers formed a cordon around the 119-pound wrestler and urged onlookers to leave, but the sight of such despair only drew more.</p>
        <p>Eventually, Henson picked himself up and took his pain to a private place. Brandon Slay, his 167 1/2-pound teammate, was preparing for his match when Henson entered the athletes' room.</p>
        <p>''I saw his gut reaction, but when you see a teammate you care about facing the agony of defeat, you can't let any of his sadness get in my way,'' Slay said. ''I had to put it away.''</p>
        <p>But later, as Henson received his silver medal, his face set in a mask of utter grief, he sobbed beside Abdullayev.</p>
        <p>There was only speculation about Henson's extreme reaction because he never spoke to reporters. One theory was that he was enraged that the referee, Abass Namazian, never penalized Abdullayev for preventing Henson's maneuvers by pulling the back of his red singlet.</p>
        <p>''I thought the referee saw it two or three times, and should have given Sammie a point,'' said John Smith, a co-head coach of the United States team.</p>
        <p>Another possibility was that Henson, an intense 29-year-old former Greco-Roman wrestler, whose nickname is Pit Bull for his aggressiveness, could not contemplate losing. ''He clearly believed that he was better and hadn't perceived that he could lose,'' Gary Abbott, a spokesman for USA Wrestling, said. ''All the time, he has talked about the gold.''</p>
        <p>Abdullayev and Henson were born three days apart in January 1971. Abdullayev, the 1996 Olympic silver medalist, lost to Henson in the gold medal match of the 1998 world championships.</p>
        <p>Henson fell behind, 3-0, in the first round tonight, but tied Abdullayev early in the second three-minute period. But Abdullayev won with a final point on a takedown 4 minutes 32 seconds into the match.</p>
        <p>Henson was not the only bitter American silver medalist. Slay charged that he was unfairly penalized 3 points in his 4-0 loss in the gold medal match to Alexander Leipold of Germany. The first penalty, for 2 points, was levied when the referee, Borje Schoug, ruled that Slay had not followed his instructions to get into a clinch with Leipold to start the second period.</p>
        <p>''I couldn't hold my hands around him,'' Leipold said. ''I tried three times and he went back, back, back. The referee told him to stand upright and let me hold him. He didn't let me do that.''</p>
        <p>Slay said: ''I gave him plenty of opportunity to get into his lock. But he started whining and crying like a baby. He was acting.''</p>
        <p>Leipold got a third point when the referee said that Slay illegally broke Leipold's lock on a gut wrench that he applied to Slay's midsection.</p>
        <p>''He was whining and crying that I was hurting his fingers,'' Slay said.</p>
        <p>Leipold said: ''He grabbed my fingers. It was a point.''</p>
        <p>Bruce Burnett, the United States freestyle coach, who is leaving after the Olympics to coach at Navy, said: ''I saw one aggressive wrestler and one passive one. The aggressive one came to wrestle and the other one didn't.''</p>
        <p>Leipold eventually scored a fourth point over the dispirited 5-8 Slay, who said the 3 penalty points against took him out of his offensive strategy.</p>
        <p>''It's tough to know that he's the Olympic gold medalist and he didn't score,'' Slay said.</p>
        <p>Disgusted by the referee's calls, Slay balked at letting Schoug hold his hand up as he proclaimed Leipold the winner. ''I was just sick to my stomach,'' he said. ''I wasn't trying to be rude because I wasn't in control. When you have no control, it's a nasty feeling.''</p>
        <p>As they stood together on the top step of the medal stand, Leipold, a four-time Olympian and now a first-time medalist, told Slay: ''You'll have two more Olympic Games. I think you can win the gold medal. It's not so bad.''</p>
        <p>Slay said nothing in reply but later said he resented the good wishes. ''I'm 24; who knows what I'll be doing in four or eight years?'' he said. ''That's not the best time to say that to me.''</p>
        <p>TAKEDOWNS</p>
        <p>The USA Wrestling headquarters in Colorado Springs has received an inquiry from the World Wrestling Federation into the availability of RULON GARDNER, the superheavyweight Greco-Roman wrestler who defeated the seemingly invincible ALEKSANDR KARELIN for the Olympic gold medal on Wednesday night. GARY ABBOTT, a spokesman for USA Wrestling, said Gardner might consider the offer.</p>
