        <p>BEFORE you enter the Garden State Discovery Museum in Cherry Hill, there is no need to give a stern lecture about how this building is full of items that are just to look at and not to touch. Here, you are invited and encouraged to look, touch, pick up and play.</p>
        <p>The museum, which opened six years ago, is geared to children 11 and under. Each station invites them to do something. The underlying theme is the Garden State, with exhibits that include a diner, life at the shore and animals found throughout the state.</p>

        <p>BEFORE you enter the Garden State Discovery Museum in Cherry Hill, there is no need to give a stern lecture about how this building is full of items that are just to look at and not to touch. Here, you are invited and encouraged to look, touch, pick up and play.</p>
        <p>The museum, which opened six years ago, is geared to children 11 and under. Each station invites them to do something. The underlying theme is the Garden State, with exhibits that include a diner, life at the shore and animals found throughout the state.</p>
        <p>This is not a quiet place. All the exhibits are on one floor, and you can hear the constant chatter of children. Afternoons are quieter than mornings, though, because the earlier hours attract hordes of school groups.</p>
        <p>A sign at the front of the museum promises ''a hands-on celebration of imagination,'' and that's what our group got in two hours.</p>
        <p>My museum testers for this trip were my 8-year-old son, Matthew; our friend John Marshall, who is 11, and John's sister, Kayli, who is 3 1/2. While 3 through 11 is a tough range in which to find common ground, this museum does have something for each of those age groups.</p>
        <p>While Kayli and Matthew liked the ''Down the Shore'' exhibit, at which they could play on a wooden boat and fish for plastic bass, John sat down at a computer in the media exhibit and made his own South Jersey page, complete with weather, his picture and a story about the museum. The Philadelphia Inquirer exhibit describes newsroom operations and lets children make their own mini-newspaper and play with a machine that demonstrates color printing.</p>
        <p>''This is awesome,'' John said. As a parent, I enjoyed seeing what the children wrote. Their ideas of front-page headlines are phrases like ''I Love Brian'' and and ''Kelly Smells.''</p>
        <p>In the animal section, children can see a robin's nest, the skin a snake sheds, hawk feathers and a snapping turtle's shell. Some days, they can hear a short lecture called ''Turtle Talk'' to learn about the state's slower creatures.</p>
        <p>Sydney is the museum's pet bull snake. He is about six feet long and only comes out of his glass case on occasion. I was glad that the day we were there, he was staying inside.</p>
        <p>One of the biggest hits for all ages is a surprising one. In the days of high-powered computer games and virtual reality, it's amazing to see how happy a huge soap bubble can make a child. The child stands on a circle, and the bubble is pulled up around him or her. ''I'm in a bubble,'' they all shout. Kayli said it was her favorite spot.</p>
        <p>''What's Growing in the Garden State?'' has a play grocery store with lots of native fruits and vegetables. Children enjoy filling a basket and heading to the cash register.</p>
        <p>After that, everyone wanted to climb through the elastic spider web. There are strategically placed bells in the web, and the trick is to crawl through without making a bell ring.</p>
        <p>In a salute to sprawl, there's a construction zone with a house in progress and lots of building blocks. It wouldn't seem right to hit all the other highlights in New Jersey and not have home construction.</p>
        <p>A favorite children's spot was the mock veterinarian's office. They put on green scrubs, picked up stethoscopes and started examining and diagnosing all the stuffed animals. The best patient was the life-size stuffed cow.</p>
        <p>In the back of the museum, the children get a chance to be television reporters. Channel 6, the ABC affiliate in Philadelpha, has an exhibit with an anchor desk, a camera and a weather map. Predicting local weather kept the children amused.</p>
        <p>The museum's co-founder and director, Roree Iris-Williams, said it strives ''to highlight what we think is great about the Garden State.''</p>
        <p>The museum also has special theme weekends, like one on butterflies, when monarch migration is discussed and butterflies are released. On Woodstock weekend, children tie-dyed shirts, strung beads and listened to music from the 1960's.</p>
        <p>There is a Jersey diner with a very cool Volkswagen parked in front (all inside the museum), where you can take a turn at taking orders and serving food. All the food is plastic, however. When you are ready for the real thing, you need to go to the front section of the museum. There are tables to eat bag lunches as well as vending machines offering snacks and drinks.</p>
        <p>If your children are anything like mine, the gift shop is a highlight of any museum experience. This one had Beanie Babies, yo-yos, magnets and some good puzzles, but the selection did not seem to have quite the imagination of the museum.</p>
        <p>The museum items were in a wide range of prices, so it was possible to buy a souvenir for less than $2. The T-shirts were $12.99 to $15. I particularly liked the colorful fish shirts.</p>
        <p>On the way out, we had to stop at the 25-cent sour ball machine. This is the best version of a gumball and candy machine I've seen.</p>
        <p>You have to work a little for your treat. The sour ball is released onto baseball diamond grid. You need to get a hit to make your sour ball to go down one of the slots and be released. You get as many tries as it takes, so eventually everybody wins.</p>
        <p>The Garden State Discovery Museum is at 16 North Springdale Road in Cherry Hill. Hours: 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Tuesday through Sunday; to 8:30 p.m. on Saturday from October through May; open Monday in July and August and on holidays. Admission: $6.95 for children and adults, $5.95 for the elderly; free for children under age 1. Information: (856) 424-1233 or at www. discoverymuseum.com. Callers can request a copy of the museum's newsletter.</p>
