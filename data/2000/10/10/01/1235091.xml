        <p>THE New Jersey Film Festival at the Rutgers University Co-op/New Jersey Media Arts Center certainly is not lacking for themes. There will be French classics like Godard's ''Alphaville'' and new French releases like ''Beau Travaille'' based on Melville's ''Billy Budd.'' There will also be films with Jewish themes, films with gay themes, films from Iran and of course, films from American independents including a retrospective of the work of the experimental filmmaker Bruce Baillie.</p>
        <p>The festival continues through Nov. 22. Tonight, filmgoers can see ''Benjamin Smoke,'' a poignant, funny documentary from the directors Jem Cohen and Peter Sillen about the lead singer for a punk-country blues band called ''Smoke.'' On Thursday, ''Screen Tests,'' Andy Warhol's three-minute portraits of the Beautiful People in his Factory will be shown, and on Friday, ''Paragraph 175,'' a documentary about the persecution of gays by the Nazis will be on view.</p>

        <p>The festival continues through Nov. 22. Tonight, filmgoers can see ''Benjamin Smoke,'' a poignant, funny documentary from the directors Jem Cohen and Peter Sillen about the lead singer for a punk-country blues band called ''Smoke.'' On Thursday, ''Screen Tests,'' Andy Warhol's three-minute portraits of the Beautiful People in his Factory will be shown, and on Friday, ''Paragraph 175,'' a documentary about the persecution of gays by the Nazis will be on view.</p>
        <p>Albert Gabriel Nigrin, the founder and director of the Rutgers film Co-op/New Jersey Media Arts Center, started showing films in a classroom at Rutgers in 1983 when he was a graduate student in French literature. The French cinema courses he took transformed him into a filmmaker and founder of the university's film society.</p>
        <p>In the last 20 years, the screenings have become a yearlong calendar of 100 films seen by an audience of 15,000 annually -- and filmmakers like Martin Scorsese and Todd Solondz appeared at no cost to discuss their work.</p>
        <p>''The film Co-op is a small miracle,'' said Prof. Alan Williams, associate director of the Rutgers University Cinema Studies Program. ''The big thing about the Film Co-op is that these films wouldn't be seen in New Jersey otherwise. Largely because of real estate values, the commercial theaters that used to show those sorts of film have failed.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Nigrin, who also lectures on cinema studies at Rutgers, believes that seeing good films makes people want to be filmmakers. In 1993, he set up the New Jersey Media Arts Center, the Film Co-op's educational wing. The center offers filmmaking workshops at low or no cost taught by people in the business.</p>
        <p>One former student is Marilyn Herod, who is making a documentary about the history of soul food. Ms Herod, who is 50, works as a librarian's assistant at the Rutgers chemistry library. She has been working on her film for five years, mostly on weekends and out of her own pocket.</p>
        <p>After five years, she is editing the film and hopes to complete it before the year is out. She says her quest was inspired by the courses she took and by the films she saw at the Co-op.</p>
        <p>''I was a student of Al Nigrin's at Rutgers,'' Ms. Herod said. ''I took a cinema studies course to satisfy my degree in English. Then I took a workshop at the Media Arts Center. Al told us to put down a topic that interested us. Mine was soul food. I started the project soon after. I took the screenwriting workshop and wrote my own script for the movie. I took a course which prepared me to shoot it.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Herod said she had an image of water in the beginning of the film that symbolizes soul food's trip from Africa and that she learned in classes that documentaries often start with a scene from nature. It's been a learning experience, she said, and a struggle because she has been unsuccessful in getting grant money.</p>
        <p>Making the film, ''Benjamin Smoke'' took 10 years, said the film's co-director Peter Sillen, who lives in Fairhaven. ''Benjamin was a really amazing person. He was unlike anybody else I ever met or anybody I had ever seen perform. He really lived life on his own terms and you don't see that very often. He was somebody who was able to work outside of the mainstream, and I was really drawn to him as a subject.''</p>
        <p>Working outside of the mainstream seems to be the stuff that independent filmmakers and film societies are made of, Mr. Nigrin said.</p>
        <p>''Young filmmakers want to make films that come from the heart rather than the pocketbook, and I think, in that sense, our community is a little bit different than the ones out in Hollywood or New York,'' he said. ''These folks who have been seeing films that are not like what they see in the multiplexes want to emulate them, and they know that becoming famous is something they may not attain. But they don't care. They are more interested in getting their vision out -- as far as it can go.''</p>
