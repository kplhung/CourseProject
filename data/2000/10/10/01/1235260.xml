        <p>It was a tip-top Tipper moment.</p>
        <p>Al Gore was appearing with his wife on Larry King's show Thursday, leaning closer and closer to her.</p>
        <p>Please, please, I muttered to myself, don't let them start making out on national TV.</p>
        <p>Mr. King asked the Gores if, in their White House, they would invite contributors for sleepovers, as Hillary Clinton has to underwrite her New York Senate campaign.</p>
        <p>While Mr. G. was equivocating, Mrs. G. stepped in as controlling marital authority.</p>
        <p>''No,'' she said flatly, then adding with a sly smile: ''I think we could think of some other things to do.''</p>
        <p>With that one sentence, Tipper summed up the Democratic campaign: They are not Bill and Hillary. They have a sexy private life and enjoy being home with each other.  Their marriage is not all about climbing and plotting and dunning.</p>
        <p>The Clintons' Humpty-Dumpty relationship has shaped the 2000 race. Husbands and wives strive to prove how incredibly happy -- and faithful -- they are. Tipper Gore, Laura Bush, Hadassah Lieberman, Lynne Cheney, Pat Lazio -- these women are everywhere playing political footsie with their guys. Pat chats proudly about cleaning the family nest, Tipper talks up Al's hunkiness, and Hadassah introduces her husband as ''the love of my life'' and ''my Joey.''</p>
        <p>Even that most airtight of couples, the Reagans, are reliving their romance in a new book of sugary love letters called ''I Love You, Ronnie.'' It is unthinkable that ''Mommie Poo Pants,'' as Ronnie addresses Nancy, would have let fat-cat arrivistes use the White House as a crash pad, interrupting the Reagans' blissful, dinner-on-trays, ''Little House on the Prairie'' TV evenings.</p>
        <p>The only couple that can't campaign as a couple is the couple that sparked this obsession with couplehood -- the Clintons.</p>
        <p>Because she is set off against this unremitting uxoriousness, this Valentine's card of a campaign, Hillary seems so very alone. She wanders, like the Flying Dutchman, all around her new state, rattling about in that $1.7 million white elephant of a house in a suburb where she is a stranger.</p>
        <p>And her husband wanders, like the Flying Dutchman, all around the globe, desperately seeking legacy, an equally lonely figure, the black sheep of this romantic race.</p>
        <p>It is one more sign of the Clintons' perennial rootlessness and their addiction to public roles and public housing that he is building an apartment in his presidential library in Little Rock, and says he plans to stay there a lot.</p>
        <p>Bill wasn't around to hug Hillary after her Buffalo debate, as the Lazio brood swarmed. He wasn't around to sit beside her at the Radio City Music Hall fund-raiser last month, when K. D. Lang and other celebrities offered tributes to the shining marriages of Al and Tipper and Joe and Hadassah. Hillary had to sit on her own, and listen about the others.</p>
        <p>Afterward, the first lady was Manhattan's dread extra woman, when she tagged along with the cozy couples to a party at Elaine's. Reporters watched as she stood outside, off by herself, for a time. ''She was like some astronaut floating in space,'' said one.</p>
        <p>Bill Clinton is intimately involved in and fixated on his wife's campaign. He simply can't appear with her very often because she must escape his shadow. And she does better with voters when she appears the victim who is enduring, rather than embracing, a difficult marriage.</p>
        <p>In a recent Washington Post Magazine story, John Harris writes that the Hillary-Bill tie is stronger than ever: they talk constantly on the phone and he edits her speeches, even signing them, ''I love you, B.''</p>
        <p>''This is a relationship that thrives on distance,'' a Clinton friend said.</p>
        <p>Perhaps. But most marriages don't.</p>
        <p>In this race of couples trying to show they thrive in tandem, the Clinton are trying to show they thrive apart.</p>
        <p>While everyone else is cuddling up to a spouse, Mrs. Clinton is cuddling up to a Senate seat. Maybe that's why her campaign, even now when she's  doing so well in the polls, seems so joyless.</p>
        <p>Conservatives see the Clintons on a steely march back to the White House with Hillary as president and Bill as consigliere. But up close it looks more poignant than Patton.</p>
        <p>Once again, the Clintons' private lives are enmeshed with their public ambitions in ways that are exhausting and ultimately sad. The more closely they work together on her campaign, the more alone they both seem.</p>
