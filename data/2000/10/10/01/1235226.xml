        <p>The Museums at Stony Brook said last week it was changing its name to more clearly identify collections and programs, and would now be known as the Long Island Museum of American Art, History and Carriages.</p>
        <p>The 61-year-old museum said it included carriages in the new name because of its collection of more than 250 horse-drawn carriages, one of the largest collections in the country. Museum holdings include more than 40,000 objects dating from the late 17th century to the present.</p>

        <p>The Museums at Stony Brook said last week it was changing its name to more clearly identify collections and programs, and would now be known as the Long Island Museum of American Art, History and Carriages.</p>
        <p>The 61-year-old museum said it included carriages in the new name because of its collection of more than 250 horse-drawn carriages, one of the largest collections in the country. Museum holdings include more than 40,000 objects dating from the late 17th century to the present.</p>
        <p>Richard B. Russell, the museum's acting president and chief executive officer, said the former museum name ''did not identify who we are.''</p>
        <p>''By changing the name we hope to amend misconceptions and strengthen our position as a major regional and national cultural resource,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Local historians and educators founded the museum in the mid-1930's. It was incorporated in 1939. The philanthropist Ward Melville included the museum in plans he proposed in 1940 for architecturally integrated commercial and cultural buildings in Stony Brook. He and others donated 19th-century American art, European and American-made carriages, and historic objects.</p>
        <p>The museum includes three exhibition buildings and five historic buildings on a nine-acre property. It is the largest not-for-profit museum on Long Island.</p>
