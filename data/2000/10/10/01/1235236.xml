        <p>Alistair McAlpine, treasurer and deputy chairman of Britain's Conservative Party under Margaret Thatcher, has packaged his book The Servant with other guides to business strategy, The Art of War by Sun Tzu and The Prince by Niccolo Machiavelli, in The Ruthless Leader, recently published by John Wiley &amp; Sons (S)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>If asked to name two literary classics that have been adopted as guides to business strategy, many people might say ''The Art of War'' by Sun Tzu and ''The Prince'' by Niccolo Machiavelli.</p>
        <p>And the third? How about ''The Servant'' by Alistair McAlpine. Mr. McAlpine was treasurer and deputy chairman of the Conservative Party under Margaret Thatcher for 15 years. He packaged his text with the other two in ''The Ruthless Leader,'' recently published by John Wiley &amp; Sons.</p>

        <p>If asked to name two literary classics that have been adopted as guides to business strategy, many people might say ''The Art of War'' by Sun Tzu and ''The Prince'' by Niccolo Machiavelli.</p>
        <p>And the third? How about ''The Servant'' by Alistair McAlpine. Mr. McAlpine was treasurer and deputy chairman of the Conservative Party under Margaret Thatcher for 15 years. He packaged his text with the other two in ''The Ruthless Leader,'' recently published by John Wiley &amp; Sons.</p>
        <p>''I don't suggest it's a great philosophical work,'' Mr. McAlpine said of his book, noting that it was the publisher's idea to put the three together. ''The other two are useful guides to civilization, and my book was certainly well regarded when it came out in Britain.''</p>
        <p>''The Servant,'' originally published by Farber &amp; Farber in 1992, contains Mr. McAlpine's view of British politicians, businessmen and other modern-day Borgias.</p>
