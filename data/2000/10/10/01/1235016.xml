        <p>THERE are easier things to do than run a community theater, especially one with a Native American theme. It's a concept that escapes most people, said Marty Black Eagle Carl, founder, president and producing artistic director of Algonkuin Theater Company in Hamden.</p>
        <p>''They have no clue,'' said Mr. Carl, who bills the Algonkuin as the only Native American theater in Connecticut. ''Really. Some would guess that we do only Native shows or that we're connected to one of the casinos and have money. Or that we do cowboy and Indian shows.''</p>

        <p>THERE are easier things to do than run a community theater, especially one with a Native American theme. It's a concept that escapes most people, said Marty Black Eagle Carl, founder, president and producing artistic director of Algonkuin Theater Company in Hamden.</p>
        <p>''They have no clue,'' said Mr. Carl, who bills the Algonkuin as the only Native American theater in Connecticut. ''Really. Some would guess that we do only Native shows or that we're connected to one of the casinos and have money. Or that we do cowboy and Indian shows.''</p>
        <p>Algonkuin Theater Company has existed since 1993. After Mr. Carl directed his own adaptation of Gaston Leroux's ''Phantom of the Opera'' for Talent Hut Players in Seymour, he and a handful of friends decided to start their own company.</p>
        <p>''We based it around the idea of promoting Native theater -- when we could find it,'' Mr. Carl said. ''Also, to do other interesting plays that we enjoyed or would like to direct and act in.''</p>
        <p>Because there is not exactly a surplus of Native American plays, Algonkuin stages a Shakespeare production every summer. Of the group's four to five annual productions, one or two are Native American plays. Since the Algonkuin has no permanent home, it presents plays in New Haven at the Church of the Redeemer, the Educational Center for the Arts and the Little Theater, and in Hamden at the Miller Memorial Library and the Eli Whitney Barn.</p>
        <p>Mr. Carl, who claims Blackfoot, African and European heritage, said his aim was ''to bridge the gap of understanding of Native American culture by producing plays by and about Native Americans.''</p>
        <p>So far, Mr. Carl said that most of the Native shows have been ''historic in essence,'' including ''Elegy for an Icon'' and ''Please Do Not Touch the Indians.''</p>
        <p>''This year we doing a modern time frame Native play called 'Someday' by Drew Hayden Taylor,'' said Mr. Carl.</p>
        <p>''Marty has always been very into his Native American background,'' said Peggy Hackett, a longtime friend of Mr. Carl who has helped with set design and lighting since the company was founded. ''As it turned out, most of us that formed the original board had Native American blood in us also, so we thought that would be a neat way to go since there didn't seem to be many other Native American theater companies around.''</p>
        <p>Once the Algonkuin's founders committed to a Native American agenda, they had difficulty finding accessible plays. ''We didn't have plays like the Euros did,'' Mr. Carl said. ''But there was Native theater, mostly being religious in content as all theater. None of it survives except what's still used in religious practices.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Hackett added that most Native American plays she is familiar with are not exactly comedies either. ''They usually center around the problems that Native Americans have gone through such as alcoholism, depression, rape, suicide and of course the mass destruction of their way of life. ''It's stuff that needs to be said and remembered. But a more upbeat show would probably draw more people in.''</p>
        <p>But the Algonkuin might still have a tough time marketing them if they have not run on Broadway, which very few have. And so the company survives on a calculated mix of popular plays and Native work. (Its first production, in 1993, was ''Phantom of the Opera'' with a Native spin.)</p>
        <p>''Small theater is tough outside of New York because most people won't come out to see plays that they've never heard about,'' Mr. Carl said.</p>
        <p>''People who have seen our work know that we do a wide range of shows, so that's how we get the audiences who come back. They've seen our Shakespeare or our Neil Simon, and some will come back for our artsy shows, or our obscure Native shows, because they know they'll see something good.</p>
        <p>''Since New Haven isn't known for having a large Native community, we just try to keep producing good, professional shows all the way around,'' he said. ''We hope people come and see our Native shows and learn about our history, our heritage, where we were and where we are today.''</p>
        <p>The Algonkuin Theatre welcomes anyone wishing to work on productions.</p>
        <p>Tanya Feduik-Smith started volunteering last summer when her husband played the title role in ''Hamlet.'' She directed the Algonkuin's most recent production of ''Much Ado About Nothing,'' which was presented last month at the Eli Whitney Barn.</p>
        <p>''I'd gotten really interested in directing and Marty gave me the chance to direct a couple of shows for the company, which I really enjoyed doing,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Carl's wife, Margaret, stage manager for many of the theater's productions, said the company's financial constraints have not been all bad. ''It really forces us to be creative, and we are fortunate to find actors who are willing to put their best efforts into a project they don't get paid for.</p>
        <p>''It's great when we get people, especially friends and relatives of the actors, who rarely or never go to live theater and tell us how much they enjoyed it,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Algonkuin Theater's next production is the area premiere of ''Someday,'' by Drew Hayden Taylor, running Nov. 3 to 18. The production, directed by Mr. Carl, will be presented at the Black Box Theater at Church of the Redeemer, Whitney Avenue and Cold Spring, New Haven.
