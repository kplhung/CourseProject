        <p>The best reason for drinking a Long Island wine is that it is demonstrably competitive in quality and price with its peers. The worst reason is local chauvinism; the psychodynamics of chauvinism are not conducive to high standards.</p>
        <p>So the informed consumer makes the wisest choices. Here are some suggestions for evaluating local wines and making sound decisions about whether to buy them or choose wines from elsewhere.</p>
        <p>During the cold-weather months, visit the North and South Fork wineries with an agenda designed to educate yourself. For example, come home with half a dozen chardonnays, three in oaky styles, three in fruitier styles; or three merlots or cabernet francs; or various dry whites intended primarily for mealtime (sauvignon blanc, chenin blanc, pinot blanc).</p>
        <p>Get on the mailing or e-mail lists of East End wineries and local merchants for their recommendations and early-bird specials.</p>
        <p>Find two neighborhood stores whose stocks suit your tastes and pocketbook, and develop personal relationships with the owner, manager or a salesperson: They live on repeat business. And take advantage of free store tastings, usually on Fridays and Saturdays. Samples from several bottles reduce the risks inescapable in wine buying.</p>
        <p>Routinely check odd-lot bins for clearance bargains, and study, clip and save ads. If you spot a boon, buy one bottle that day, try it within 24 hours and reorder fast: if a store has it in limited quantities, it may vanish fast. Even if you are smitten, don't buy a full case: you might tire of the wine; six bottles will do nicely.</p>
        <p>If one store doesn't give a 10 to 15 percent discount and perhaps free delivery on a 12-bottle case, another will. Half-case discounts are common.</p>
        <p>Check whether a red or white in a standard 750-milliliter bottle comes in a 1.5-liter version, a magnum. It should cost less than two 750's; for large-scale entertaining, magnums save money. Dining alone at home? Check the half-bottles.</p>
        <p>Keep receipts. If a tainted cork or mishandling has ruined a bottle bought for immediate drinking, return the wine recorked and intact within 24 hours. Reputable merchants offer reasonable customers another or substitute bottle, credit or your money back (ultimately, producers shoulder the loss).</p>
