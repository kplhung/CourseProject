        <p>WENDING her way through the  Hayground Market in Bridgehampton one recent afternoon, Kathi Cavanaugh stopped to scoop string beans into her plastic bag. ''I always pick fresh produce here, rather than going to the supermarket,'' said Ms. Cavanaugh, who lives in Sag Harbor. She was standing beneath a handwritten sign proclaiming ''Local String Beans.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Cavanaugh said she preferred locally grown produce for a couple of reasons. ''I believe it's fresher, for one thing,'' she said. ''And it supports the local farmers, which I think is highly important.''</p>
        <p>Finding fresh local produce in Suffolk County is not a demanding chore this time of year. Roadside stands now proudly display the bounty: armies of plump pumpkins, tangles of speckled cranberry beans, waist-high piles of unshucked corn.</p>
        <p>Selling locally grown produce is mainly a homespun affair on Long Island, despite the success other areas have had in using regional labels. In New Jersey, where farmers compete directly with Long Island farmers for wholesale customers, the long-running New Jersey Farm Fresh campaign is considered a classic example of agricultural branding, as the field is known. New York State operates its own program, as do many other states and regions.</p>
        <p>In Riverhead, a similar campaign was developed 15 years ago by a farmers' organization called the Long Island Farm Bureau. Under the banner of ''Grown on Long Island,'' the campaign was initially greeted with high hopes. A logo was designed -- it was free, the winning entry of a Suffolk County Industrial Development Authority competition -- and signs for farm trucks and stickers for produce boxes were prepared. But the project stalled.</p>
        <p>''We haven't gotten much cooperation from supermarkets, who are more interested in buying by the price,'' said Joseph Gergela III, the group's executive director and a member of an old Riverhead farm family.  ''And to be fair, our farmers have been reluctant to participate as well for reasons of their own, which are mysterious to me.''</p>
        <p>The campaign did make some inroads. About 150 signs with the campaign's verdant logo -- the outline of Long Island surrounded by the slogan in curvy letters that seem to be sprouting at the top -- were handed out and actually used, Mr. Gergela said. A number of growers affix labels with the logo on produce boxes, although Mr. Gergela said he did not know how many.</p>
        <p>This year, the bureau is trying to revive the campaign. One reason is farmland preservation. The thought is that if farmers are prospering, they will be less likely to sell their land to developers. Progress in establishing a local farmers' market, a quixotic dream of long standing that finally received start-up money from the State Legislature last year, is another.</p>
        <p>''The campaign is an effort to give a regional identity to the produce grown on Long Island,'' said Lyle Wells, a Riverhead farmer and longtime Farm Bureau member.  Drawing on a $70,000 promotion budget, up more than 40 percent over 1999, Mr. Gergela has attended about a dozen local trade shows this year, double the number he went to last year. The money comes from the bureau, whose 5,700 members pay dues of $80 a year.</p>
        <p>While Suffolk County farmers -- as individuals -- may appreciate the marketing power of the word ''local,'' they have by and large paid only lip service to the campaign. One reason why they are lukewarm is that roadside selling is often more profitable. To sell a ''Grown on Long Island'' deal to supermarkets, ''we have to lock into prices and volume, and not everybody wants to do that,'' said Phil Schmitt, a fifth-generation lettuce grower in Riverhead.</p>
        <p>Another stumbling block has been the issue of quality standards. No wilted green beans, no bruised zucchini, no black patches on the cauliflower. Supermarket buyers enforce those standards; roadside customers may overlook a few imperfections.</p>
        <p>Another problem is economic. Establishing a serious marketing campaign is going to cost quite a bit more than $70,000, and absent government largess, the money will need to come out of members' pockets. ''I don't know that they'll be willing to support that,'' Mr. Gergela said.</p>
        <p>Another issue is marketplace economics -- read: retail consolidation. Supermarket produce buyers, never the most romantic of  souls, have become even less susceptible to regional appeals. ''When Waldbaum's was a Long Island store, we could go to the warehouse and sell directly to them,'' Mr. Schmitt said. ''We sold every day to them for 40 years. When they sold the store to A.&amp;P., everything changed. The A.&amp;P. buyers didn't care if we came from Long Island or Timbuktu. Every big store's the same; they buy on price.''</p>
        <p>Still, people see the television commercials venerating produce from New Jersey -- they appear on ''Good Morning America,'' right after Martha Stewart, for goodness' sake -- and may well wonder why Grown on Long Island remains a struggling seedling. The campaign has its critics, some of whom say it fails to establish a strong emotional connection between consumers and Long Island produce.</p>
        <p>Joseph Friedman, a senior partner in  Friedman, Ellis, Nielsen &amp; Rogan, a Hauppauge firm that specializes in marketing and branding, contends that the campaign should be redesigned. ''Freshness means so much to people when it comes to produce, yet the campaign doesn't seem to get that message across,'' said Mr. Friedman,  whose client roster includes Galluccio Estate Vineyards in Cutchogue. ''The region has panache - -- its popularity is growing in leaps and bounds. The farmers have to make clear in the campaign that local equals fresh.''</p>
        <p>How could they do that? ''They could,'' he said, ''hire me.''</p>
        <p>Another branding consultant, Peggy Ehlers of Riverhead, said she feels ''enormous frustration'' at the campaign's pace.  ''Look at Napa Valley,'' she said and went on to describe that California landmark  northeast of San Francisco as an agricultural marketing benchmark. ''I happen to think this region actually has more going for it than Napa Valley, but we aren't anywhere near them in branding,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The problem, in her view, is that the Farm Bureau's campaign misses the agri-tourism boat. ''People are looking for freshness, of course, but even more they're looking for something emotional,'' she said. ''They want a connection to the land, to the farmers, to the heritage. Grown on Long Island doesn't work because it just doesn't tap into the emotional reasons people buy produce.''</p>
        <p>Some 18 million people live within a day's trip of Riverhead, she said. Reaching only a fraction of those people could create a market for local farmers and preserve the region's farmland from development.</p>
        <p>''We need to connect the various industries that are dependent on agri-tourism,'' she said. ''There are all these cottage industries, bed-and-breakfast accommodations and, of course, the vineyards. They're all part of the visitor's experience, but they've  been left out of the picture here.''</p>
        <p>Inclusiveness and outreach have not been  campaign hallmarks, it seems. ''Grown on Long Island?'' said Harold Watts, the Long Island Wine Council's president. ''Haven't heard anything about that.''</p>
