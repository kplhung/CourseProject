        <p>Friday night at the fights usually means rich guys at ringside watching a couple of street toughs battle it out. But once a month at Gleason's Gym in Brooklyn, it's the other way around.</p>
        <p>On a recent Friday, the lean, gritty fighters who train regularly at the gym laid off the speed bags to watch the fancy-pants fighters trying out their footwork in the ring.</p>
        <p>They watched as Dmitry Feygin, 34, a computer consultant for J. P. Morgan, slugged it out with Philip L. Maier.</p>
        <p>Like all the competing fighters at Gleason's that night, Mr. Maier has a day job unrelated to boxing. As a judge for the New York State Public Employment Relations Board, he adjudicates labor disputes.</p>
        <p>''I'm more honest than a boxing judge,'' said Mr. Maier, 42, of Park Slope, Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>At the White Collar Boxing nights at Gleason's, on Front Street under the Brooklyn Bridge, the working stiffs doff their suits, ties and laptops, strap on 14-ounce gloves and protective headgear, and step into the ring. The sparring sessions are mostly between professionals in the business world.</p>
        <p>About 100 people showed up on Sept. 22, mostly friends and families of the fighters, to watch the 10 matchups.</p>
        <p>It may seem odd that Gleason's, a gym used at one time or another by the likes of Ali, Frazier, Tyson and Bowe, now has duffel bags lying around with Ralph Lauren dress shirts and slacks inside. But it hardly seems set to become a yuppie gym.</p>
        <p>Spectators sit on metal folding chairs. The cigar smoke is cheap and the meager snack bar has no fancy bottled waters, only soda and cellophane-wrapped muffins.</p>
        <p>The walls are papered with sports page clippings and pictures of boxers. The ceilings are low, and the smell of stale sweat seems strong enough to wilt the crease in a Brooks Brothers suit.</p>
        <p>This old-gym charm, such as it is, is one reason many of these boxers come to the White Collar sessions.</p>
        <p>Jill Stasium, 34, a Brooklyn artist who sells her canvases in SoHo, said she first came to Gleason's for the shower: her nearby apartment did not have a full bathroom. Then she decided to try boxing. Now she enjoys sparring on canvas as much as she does painting on it.</p>
        <p>''I was always the biggest couch potato,'' Ms. Stasium said before her sparring session with a trainer. ''I never threw a punch at anyone in my life. I started fights but never stuck around to fight them. Now I even dream about punching people.''</p>
        <p>Another artist who made the leap from painting to punching was Tahira Kahn-Harper, 26, an art teacher at Public School 125 in Harlem. She was making her second appearance.</p>
        <p>Ms. Kahn-Harper was taking on an Irish fighter, Ruth O'Sullivan, 24, who is from Dublin but who lives in Brooklyn and trains at Gleason's.</p>
        <p>Just before the end of the second round, Ms. O'Sullivan rocked Ms. Kahn-Harper with a straight right hand to the head. But the fight was pretty even, and at the end, it was Ms. O'Sullivan who emerged with a bloody lip.</p>
        <p>Ms. Kahn-Harper said that before she took up boxing last year at a Manhattan athletic club, ''I thought it was brutal, and I thought it was barbaric. ''Now that I do it, I still think it's a little bit of both. But now I see there's a bit of the intellectual as well as the primal.''</p>
        <p>Bruce Silverglade runs White Collar Boxing at Gleason's. He started the monthly sessions about 11 years ago as more and more businesspeople joined the gym and wanted to compete in front of a crowd.</p>
        <p>Actually, not all the collars are white. While a Deutsche Bank executive boxes there, Mr. Silverglade said, so do police officers and carpenters.</p>
        <p>There are no official winners. Each fighter gets a trophy and a hand raised after the contest. They pay $20 to participate. ''But they take it as seriously as our pro fighters at Gleason's and go through the same emotional and physical trauma,'' Mr. Silverglade said.</p>
        <p>The fighters go three rounds of two minutes each, he said, but are not always in shape for that. ''Sometimes we have to cheat on the bell.''</p>
        <p>Leif Washer, 53, a dentist from Wallingford, Conn., has been fighting in the White Collar bouts for several years, and now uses them as a reason to get into the city with his wife and take a nice hotel room in Midtown. In his baggy white trunks with his initials, Mr. Washer sat on the edge of the ring taping his hands while his wife, Mary, and his daughter and two of her friends watched.</p>
        <p>''They're my entourage,'' he said, adding that the group did not come just to see him box. He also paid for their hotel rooms.</p>
        <p>The bouts are supposed to be for training purposes. But the fighters, if they are evenly matched, are allowed to really go after each other, and they often do.</p>
        <p>''The younger guys with all the testosterone really try to kill each other, but the older guys take it easy on each other,'' Mr. Washer said.</p>
        <p>But that is not completely true. Mr. Washer's opponent was Mark Korman, 56, of Brooklyn. The last time they fought, they both lost their tempers and began brawling. Though both wore headgear, each bloodied the other's face. Mr. Washer broke Mr. Korman's tooth (and did not offer to fix it). Mr. Korman said he broke one of Mr. Washer's ribs.</p>
        <p>''I put him in the hospital,'' Mr. Korman crowed when asked about the fight.</p>
        <p>Mr. Washer made a custom mouthpiece for himself, and said he hoped for a tamer fight this time. But he shot a worried glance across the gym at Mr. Korman, who was already getting pumped up by taking on all challengers in arm wrestling, and beating all of them.</p>
        <p>''That's from 25 years loading trucks,'' said Mr. Korman, a produce buyer for two supermarkets in Midwood, Brooklyn. He has been training four times a week lately, and was gearing up for Mr. Washer. But this time there was no blood. Mr. Korman did go strong to the body several times though, peppering Mr. Washer with rapid-fire combinations.</p>
        <p>Mr. Silverglade announces the fights. Next up -- in the red corner, wearing the black trunks -- was Freddy Fiengo, 34, a manager at the Regency Hotel in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>And in the blue corner, in blue satin trunks, was Scott Lowenthal, 47, from Pomona in Rockland County. Mr. Lowenthal is a sergeant in the Metropolitan Transportation Authority police, and he teaches self-defense to new officers.</p>
        <p>Working his corner was his son Shawn, 21, a student at Rockland Community College. Though father and son occasionally spar with each other, the younger Mr. Lowenthal had never seen his old man in the ring and was a little nervous. But the fighters traded punches pretty evenly, and chatted amiably afterward.</p>
