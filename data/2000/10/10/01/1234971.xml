        <p>JULY 6, 1996 was not your typical day at the Denver International Airport. A crowd of 200 jammed a United Airlines gate, drumming, dancing and singing to welcome 15 members of the Maasai tribe of Kenya. The Maasai, tall and proud in their traditional red plaid and beaded collars, bracelets and earrings, were met by their equally vivid hostess, Cleo Parker Robinson. Wearing a bright blue dress, auburn braids and inchlong crimson fingernails, Ms. Robinson led the group through the concourse to the shuttle train and, above the continuing din, surveyed the scene, beaming her megawatt smile. The Maasai's visit, the culmination of a cultural exchange between Ms. Robinson's Denver-based dance ensemble and its sister city counterpart in Nairobi, was Ms. Robinson's brainchild and another fulfillment of her vision of dance as a bridge between cultures, nations and people.</p>
        <p>That day was just one on a long list of Ms. Robinson's achievements during a 30-year career in dance. She has become an institution in Denver, with a triumvirate of dance company, dance school and theater building that all bear her name. Her youth program, Project Self-Discovery, recently received the ''Coming Up Taller'' award by the President's Council on the Arts and Humanities. Last spring she directed ''Porgy and Bess,'' only the second black woman in the opera's history to do so. And she has completed the first year of a four-year term on the National Council on the Arts, the only dance artist on this advisory panel to the National Endowment for the Arts.</p>

        <p>JULY 6, 1996 was not your typical day at the Denver International Airport. A crowd of 200 jammed a United Airlines gate, drumming, dancing and singing to welcome 15 members of the Maasai tribe of Kenya. The Maasai, tall and proud in their traditional red plaid and beaded collars, bracelets and earrings, were met by their equally vivid hostess, Cleo Parker Robinson. Wearing a bright blue dress, auburn braids and inchlong crimson fingernails, Ms. Robinson led the group through the concourse to the shuttle train and, above the continuing din, surveyed the scene, beaming her megawatt smile. The Maasai's visit, the culmination of a cultural exchange between Ms. Robinson's Denver-based dance ensemble and its sister city counterpart in Nairobi, was Ms. Robinson's brainchild and another fulfillment of her vision of dance as a bridge between cultures, nations and people.</p>
        <p>That day was just one on a long list of Ms. Robinson's achievements during a 30-year career in dance. She has become an institution in Denver, with a triumvirate of dance company, dance school and theater building that all bear her name. Her youth program, Project Self-Discovery, recently received the ''Coming Up Taller'' award by the President's Council on the Arts and Humanities. Last spring she directed ''Porgy and Bess,'' only the second black woman in the opera's history to do so. And she has completed the first year of a four-year term on the National Council on the Arts, the only dance artist on this advisory panel to the National Endowment for the Arts.</p>
        <p>But despite such a resume, Ms. Robinson is not well known, even in the dance world. Part of the reason, she feels, is her location. ''It's difficult to recognize anyone not out of New York, not on either coast,'' she said in a recent interview. ''Seldom do we recognize the artistry that comes out of the middle of the country.''</p>
        <p>Race and gender, she thinks, have also contributed to keeping her off the dance map. ''In the dance world, it's been so hard for the black woman,'' she said. Then she added, with characteristic optimism: ''Sometimes it's an inspiration to make change, because we know things haven't changed enough. You know it exists, you work through it.''</p>
        <p>''I think of Katherine Dunham,'' she continued, referring to her mentor and friend, ''and why she's been so misunderstood, because she lives in a society that won't let a woman be complex. Especially an African-American woman. Consider our history. My grandmother's job was to iron clothes for white people. That's all she could be. The domestic woman, that's a real box. And when you break out of the box, you're called all sorts of names.''</p>
        <p>Basing her integrated Cleo Parker Robinson Dance Ensemble on the African-American tradition in modern dance, by 1973 she was inviting the top choreographers  of that genre: Eleo Pomare, Dianne McIntyre, Rod Rodgers, Donald Byrd. Milton Myers choreographed her company's signature piece, ''Raindance,'' in 1984. Talley Beatty created his last work, ''Ellingtonia,'' for her company in 1994. And Donald McKayle, whom Ms. Robinson calls ''my greatest choreographic inspiration,'' has given it nine dances since 1983. In the 1990's she also raised the money to document and produce two works by Ms. Dunham, ''Choros'' and ''Barrelhouse Blues,'' with the goal of preserving more in the future.</p>
        <p>Some people did take notice. In 1997, the arts presenters Stephanie Hughley, Laura Greer and Mikki Shepard named Ms. Robinson and four other black dance company founders ''Dance Women: Living Legends,'' inviting them to the Brooklyn Academy of Music to share the stage with one another and their dance companies in performance. The others, Joan Myers Brown (Philadanco in Philadelphia), Anne Williams (Dallas Black Dance Theater), Lula Washington (Lula Washington Dance Theater in Los Angeles) and the late Jeraldyne Blunden (Dayton Contemporary Dance Company in Ohio), were honored for the length of their careers, for their educational efforts, and for their support of African-American choreographers and dance traditions.</p>
        <p>''People need to know that there are black women now who are pioneers, not just 50 years ago,'' Ms. Robinson said. ''I was honored for doing things in my area that no one ever did, ever dreamed of doing.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Robinson, now 52, is the oldest of four children born to Martha and Jonathan Parker. She grew up in Denver's Five Points neighborhood during the 50's and 60's in an interracial family that struggled through poverty and prejudice. A two-year relocation to her grandparents' home in Dallas during her childhood brought greater hardship. ''My mother was disowned by her parents for marrying my father, so we had to go there,'' Ms. Robinson said. ''She was the only white person within this all-black community during segregation. We had to hide her.''</p>
        <p>At one point a white woman, apparently angry at seeing a mixed-race child, broke a bottle and tried to attack young Cleo with it. ''She came at my face, and my mother stuck out her arm to stop her,'' Ms. Robinson said. ''She still has the scars. But now, I don't have any hatred. I have memory of fear and pain, but I also learned a lot about love, about how much my mother and father loved me, how much my grandparents loved me, how much the people in that community protected me.''</p>
        <p>Her parents' story inspired the choreographer David Rousseve's ''Dry Each Other's Tears in the Stillness of the Night'' (1993). ''I have an extraordinary mother and father,'' Ms. Robinson says. ''They endured so much humiliation. We grew up talking about what was just, what was law, what needed to change.'' The Parkers exposed their children to jazz, theater and poetry, but most important, Ms. Robinson said, they ''taught us you can't live with fear.''</p>
        <p>The Parkers couldn't afford private dance lessons, so Cleo took classes at the Y and at local recreation centers. A childhood brush with death -- her heart stopped while under medication for nephritis, a kidney disease, but she was revived -- spurred her ambitions. ''For me, it was very clear,'' Ms. Robinson said. ''I had to dance. This drove me, thinking, 'I don't have a lot of time.' ''</p>
        <p>At 15, she began teaching dance at the University of Colorado in Denver. After a trip to New York for classes and auditions, she returned to Denver, finished college and at 21 married Tom Robinson, her childhood sweetheart. The same year, Ms. Robinson was hired as dance director at the Model Cities Cultural Center. There was no studio, only an empty office, but in that small space her dance company began. ''In those days, I wanted to prove that you don't have to go to New York to dance,'' she said. ''I wanted to build something, give people something I didn't have access to when I was young.''</p>
        <p>Her dance school operates year-round from Denver's first black church, the Shorter African Methodist Episcopalian Church. Renamed the Cleo Parker Robinson Dance Theater after she acquired and rehabilitated the building in 1988, the former church now houses several dance studios, Ms. Robinson's dance school, a 300-seat theater, Project Self-Discovery and her International Summer Dance Institute, a two-week intensive course on the movement, music and culture of the African Diaspora.</p>
        <p>MEANWHILE, she took her dancers around the world, performing in Singapore, Eastern and Western Europe (in Italy they visited the Vatican and met the Pope), South America and Africa. They have danced at Jacob's Pillow and the American Dance Festival, and participated in cultural exchanges not only with the Maasai but also with DanceBrazil in Bahia. In November, they open the first International Tel Aviv Dance Festival.</p>
        <p>Ms. Robinson recently celebrated her ensemble's 30th anniversary with a gala performance of her newly staged ''Mary Lou's Mass.'' Written by the great jazz composer Mary Lou Williams, this union of jazz and the Roman Catholic mass had been danced just once, in 1971, by the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater. Because additional music was found, Ms. Robinson has choreographed it in 23 sections instead of Ailey's original 9.</p>
        <p>Balancing three decades of struggle and success, Ms. Robinson remains an optimist: ''You don't wait for your reward after 30 years -- you're rewarded as you do it. The reward is now. And the little seeds of what happened to you start sprouting out, have a whole other life, other purpose. That's why art is functional, why we need it; in our daily lives, it brings us together. We've come through so much, and artists have been such a big part of that.</p>
        <p>'' 'Here I stand,' Paul Robeson said. 'I'm still here.' And so are we, giving thanks for all we have, trying to be one of those forward-moving companies of the art world. Trying to pave some ways.''</p>
