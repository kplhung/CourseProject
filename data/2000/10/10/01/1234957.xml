        <p>Outward Bound for Women</p>
        <p>Q. How can I find an Outward Bound group for women over 50 with a focus on hiking or cycling? -- Maida Beren, Manorville, N.Y.</p>
        <p>A. Outward Bound USA, with headquarters in Garrison, N.Y., runs five ''schools'' across the nation and offers dozens of ''courses'' a year. It refers to its programs this way because the outings try to teach nature skills and self-understanding.</p>
        <p>Craig Steele, the national vice president for marketing, said all the schools offered ''adult renewal'' courses. Only a few are for women only, but coed courses tend to have more women than men, he added, and usually attract people in their 30's, 40's and 50's.</p>
        <p>One note about accommodations:  Outings use tents or, sometimes, just a tarp above as protection from the elements. And don't expect hot showers (or even cold ones).</p>
        <p>The only cycling course next year for women is for ages 16 and up on Aug. 12 to 25. It mixes mountain biking and rock climbing in North Carolina's Appalachians. The cost is $1,995 (prices include food and specialized equipment, including tents).</p>
        <p>There are two women's backpacking trips in Maine: one in the White Mountains and Mahoosuc range near New Hampshire, June 30 to July 7,  and Canoeing and Hiking in the North Woods, Sept. 1 to 8. Each costs $995. The Desert Sampler course, in Joshua Tree National Park in California, includes hiking and rock climbing. This has two sessions: an eight-day trip March 11 to 18 ($995), and five days, March 26 to 30 ($795).</p>
        <p>To find out more, call Outward Bound at (888) 882-6863 or go to www.outwardbound.org.</p>
        <p>If you'd prefer a bike tour and more comfort, Bicycle Holidays, 1394 Munger Street, Middlebury, Vt. 05753, (800) 292-5388, plans one or two trips for women in the Lower Champlain Valley of Vermont next summer or early fall. Dates are not set, but this year's trip was six days with five nights in inns and B &amp; B's and included most meals. Riders pedaled 30 to 40 miles a day. The cost was $1,195 each, double occupancy.</p>
        <p>If you'd like more choices, try Adventure Women, 15033 Kelly Canyon Road, Bozeman, Mont. 59715, (800) 804-8686, fax (416) 587-9449, www .adventurewomen.com, which specializes in trips for women over 30. It rates trips easy, moderate or high energy. An easy hiking tour is its Olympic Peninsula Walkabout in Washington, next Sept. 15 to 21, covering about three miles a day on foot in Olympic National Park and environs. Lodging is mainly in rustic lodges. The cost is $1,825 a person, double occupancy, including most meals and ground transportation.</p>
        <p>The Web site www.infohub.com allows you to search for women's tours of all kinds in various price categories, time periods and locations.</p>
        <p>Dance Lessons in Dublin</p>
        <p>Q. I will be taking my 13-year-old daughter to Ireland and she would like to take a beginner-level Irish dancing lesson in Dublin. Is this possible? -- Ann Steiner, Lancaster, Pa.</p>
        <p>A. A lesson certainly should be doable -- considering that there are more than 80 teachers in the city registered with the Irish Dancing Commission, according to Sean Fegan, project officer at the commission, which regulates competitions and certifies teachers worldwide. He said he could not recommend any member over another, so he urged that you ask your daughter's teacher for a recommendation.</p>
        <p>You can also contact Dennis Denahy, president of the Irish Dancing Association of America, the commission's affiliate in America, for a list of schools in Dublin, at 10608 Lockwood Avenue, Oak Lawn, Ill. 60453, or (708) 636-8241.</p>
        <p>One of those on the list is the O'Shea School, 237 Dellwood Grove, Castleknock, Dublin 15. Sean and Aine (pronounced Annie) O'Shea hold beginners' classes -- as at many schools, 90 minutes to two hours long -- on Wednesday and Thursday afternoons at different sites. Mr. O'Shea said the cost would be about $5.50, at $1.08 to the punt. Contact the O'Sheas at (353-1) 821-4327 or (353-87) 250-9147.</p>
        <p>Olive Hurley, who runs the Hurley School of Irish Dancing in Kilcamud, said she offers beginner classes on Monday and Thursday afternoons. Ms. Hurley, who has been teaching for 20 years, said the cost would be about $5.50. For more information, call her at (353-1) 269-8005, or see www.olivehurley.com.</p>
        <p>Christine Cosgrave, a director of the Dublin Folk Dance Group, 48 Ludford Drive, Ballinteer, Dublin 16, phone and fax (353-1) 298-7929, said her school offered lessons three evenings a week in Dunbrum, about six miles from Dublin center. Classes average about 20 students of various ages, and cost about $4.</p>
        <p>Genealogy in Basel</p>
        <p>Q. How can I find out about genealogical societies or professionals in Basel, Switzerland? -- Dorothy Kinney, Lafayette, N.J.</p>
        <p>A. On the Web, genealogy.net leads to a page for the Swiss Genealogical Society, which owns a library. To seek information, contact Alfred Dobler, Alte Bilindenholzstrasse 14,  8616 Riedkikon, Switzerland; e-mail, alfred.dobler@gmx.net.</p>
        <p>The Genealogical and Heraldic Society of the Region of Basel deals with both Basel-Stadt, the city, and Basel-Landschaft, the canton. The society's prsident, Dr. Hans B. Kalin, Steinbuhlallee 189, CH-4054 Basel,  (41-61) 301-7455, fax (41-61) 301-7451, said he could help with addresses of archives and of members who have knowledge of particular areas.</p>
        <p>But you might want to begin in the United States with The Swiss Connection, a quarterly put out by Maralyn Wellauer. She wrote the 1979 book ''Tracing Your Swiss Roots,'' now out of print, and is revising it. Ms. Wellauer's newsletter ($12 a year) prints articles on researching family histories and runs personal queries from subscribers free.</p>
        <p>She said she would personally take queries on genealogy; contact her at 2485 North 72nd Street, Milwaukee, Wis. 53210; (414) 778-1224, fax (414) 778-2109. In addition, her Web site, feefhs.org/ch/tsc/frg-tsc.html, includes a link to addresses of cantonal archives in Switzerland.</p>
        <p>Ms. Wellauer recommended using the Genealogical Library of the Church of the Latter-day Saints in Salt Lake City, saying it contained all Basel parish registers. Call the livrary at (801) 240-2584, or start searching at www.familysearch.org.</p>
        <p>Another large and comprehensive Web site is www.genealogy.com, with articles, search engines, chat rooms and links to other sites.</p>
        <p>For general travel information, contact Switzerland Tourism, 608 Fifth Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10020, (877) 794-8037, fax (212) 262-6116.</p>
