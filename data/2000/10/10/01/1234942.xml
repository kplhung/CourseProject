        <p>What's the modern-day equivalent of Mary Cassatt's Impressionist tea parties of cakes and chiffon? A Realist Champagne bacchanalia of Lee press-on nails and Doritos, perhaps? Inspired in part by the exclusionary gleam and faux intimacy of fashion shoots, as well as by Cassatt's scenes of social life, Delia Brown has been staging parties, inventing invitees and photographing them, then exquisitely painting the hedonistic results. Of course, she is always invited and In the Scene, one step beyond the 80's artists who used their celebrity to get On the List. In the group show for her graduate degree, she even created her own V.I.P. room with a Champagne party of hired actors cavorting behind velvet ropes while the cheap white-wine masses were kept at bay.</p>
        <p>One of the people invited to the group show, but not to Brown's party inside, was Chris D'Amelio, a co-owner of D'Amelio Terras, a gallery on West 22nd Street. ''We left troubled,'' D'Amelio says. ''Is it the greatest thing we saw or just an attempt to get attention?''</p>

        <p>What's the modern-day equivalent of Mary Cassatt's Impressionist tea parties of cakes and chiffon? A Realist Champagne bacchanalia of Lee press-on nails and Doritos, perhaps? Inspired in part by the exclusionary gleam and faux intimacy of fashion shoots, as well as by Cassatt's scenes of social life, Delia Brown has been staging parties, inventing invitees and photographing them, then exquisitely painting the hedonistic results. Of course, she is always invited and In the Scene, one step beyond the 80's artists who used their celebrity to get On the List. In the group show for her graduate degree, she even created her own V.I.P. room with a Champagne party of hired actors cavorting behind velvet ropes while the cheap white-wine masses were kept at bay.</p>
        <p>One of the people invited to the group show, but not to Brown's party inside, was Chris D'Amelio, a co-owner of D'Amelio Terras, a gallery on West 22nd Street. ''We left troubled,'' D'Amelio says. ''Is it the greatest thing we saw or just an attempt to get attention?''</p>
        <p>The show managed to be both: Brown's first one-woman show, ''What! Are You Jealous?'' opens at D'Amelio Terras on Oct. 7.</p>
        <p>Brown admits that by showing the process of her work she is making it more accessible. ''But I couldn't make the party accessible,'' she says with a giggle. ''It's exclusive!''</p>
        <p>The resulting images, she says, are utterly fake, ''luxurious and exclusive but constructed for the moment. I'm not interested in 'what's the truth of this moment.' I'm interested in why some people have access to this experience and others not.''</p>
        <p>The title of her new show is from a Gaugin painting (''Aha oe feii?'') in which two Tahitian women loll naked by a pool of water. She has done a series of women lolling naked in the pools of Los Angeles, where she lives. The show will also include the paintings seen here, staged with models in a Malibu mansion.</p>
        <p>Brown's first party series was imagined, inspired by a fashion spread of bathing suits called ''Pool Sharks.'' ''I thought, This is the sexiest thing I've ever seen -- I want to be at this party.'' So she invited herself with paints, dressed up in a bra, panties, stilettos, sunglasses and a Betsey Johnson leopard coat. On the wall above the orgy about to take place hung an ''18th-century'' portrait of herself in the style of her earlier, more academic work.</p>
        <p>For that early work, she rented costumes and painted herself with a cat to symbolize self-possession and independence, a twist on the old practice of including a dog, the symbol of fidelity and possession by a husband, in a portrait.</p>
        <p>When she puts herself in the picture, Brown says, she is not what's important -- what's important is her relationship to the cultural signifiers. Those have included a Versace rug, Pringles, Startec phones, dead Mot &amp; Chandon bottles, Manolo Blahniks, Fogal fishnets and Tab, all pointing to who she was: a former rapper from Venice Beach, Calif. Like rap, Brown's paintings are obsessed with the splashy trappings of wealth: a mansion, designer clothes, jewels. The idea of serving Champagne with Cheetos came from a DJ Quik song.</p>
        <p>Like the portraits that first inspired her, Brown's work, D'Amelio says, celebrates the success achieved by its subjects, conveyed through the interiors and the fashion. ''It's this thing you can't describe,'' he adds. ''The fabulousness that is our culture at this time.''</p>
