        <p>Members of Congress write the darndest bills.</p>
        <p>New Jersey's Congressional delegation spends most of its bill-writing time proposing legislation with important local and national significance -- protecting wetlands, improving education, cracking down on crime and the like. Those are the bills we are likely to hear about through news releases and in campaign boasting.</p>
        <p>But a skim through the hundreds of bills proposed by New Jersey's 13 members of the House during the 106th Congress now drawing to a close reveals a scattering of bills that are funny, or charming, or even incomprehensible.</p>
        <p>What, for instance, is cyclohexadee-8-en-1-one? Or ''dark couverture chocolate''? Representative Steven R. Rothman, a Democrat from the Ninth Congressional District, has offered a bill to temporarily suspend import duties on the chemical, and Rodney Frelinghuysen, a Republican from the 11th Congressional District, wants to do the same for the candy. And for iced tea.</p>
        <p>It is a given of legislative life that few bills ever go all the way through the president's signature. They face a gauntlet of committees and amendments first, and if they are from a Democrat, in the current minority, they might as well have been made into paper airplanes -- bill paper is thick and long -- and aimed down Pennsylvania Avenue toward the White House.</p>
        <p>No matter. The point is to have done the thing, to have made the gesture to friends and supporters and, often, desperate constituents. Most of the members have put in what are known as private bills to help unite immigrant families, or to find a place in Arlington National Cemetery for an overlooked veteran.</p>
        <p>Many, not surprisingly, deal with recurrent New Jersey issues, like airport noise. Mr. Frelinghuysen has bills in to minimize the airplane noise on the approaches to the region's airports, and Mr. Rothman introduced one ''To amend title 49, United States Code, to prohibit the operation in certain metropolitan areas of civil subsonic turbojets that fail to comply with stage 3 noise levels.''</p>
        <p>Frank E. Pallone Jr., a Democrat from the Sixth Congressional District, put up a fight for the state's beleaguered sports fishermen by introducing a bill to stop commercial fishing of striped bass in United States waters. The sportsmen have long been complaining that the bass are being overfished by trawlers. And few representatives have forgotten Joanne Chesimard, who killed a state trooper on the New Jersey Turnpike in 1973. Several bills have gone in again this year aimed at trying to extradite her from Cuba, where she fled after escaping from jail.</p>
        <p>Mr. Frelinghuysen is most likely to win friends with his Know Your Caller Act, which would forbid telemarketers from concealing their identities and phone numbers from caller ID devices. The measure passed the House on a vote of 420-0 last Wednesday.</p>
        <p>Other bills are more arcane.</p>
        <p>Rob Andrews, a Democrat from the First Congressional District, introduced H.R. 523, ''To encourage States to enter into agreements with other States for the establishment of conforming regulations governing the provision of limousine service between the States.''</p>
        <p>Translation: Neighboring states should not try to impose exclusionary rules on New Jersey limos unless it has a reciprocal deal with us.</p>
        <p>Mr. Menendez similarly put in a bill to have Congress regulate the safety of small commercial vans, and another to protect the safety of animals on airplanes.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, Mr. Frelinghuysen would like Congress to have the United States Mint produce coins in commemoration of the battleship New Jersey, while Bill Pascrell Jr., a Democrat from the Eighth Congressional District, has put in a bill ''expressing the sense of the Congress that Roberto Clemente was a great athlete and should be honored by a national day of recognition.''</p>
        <p>The best bill from a member of the New Jersey House delegation? From Jim Saxton, a Republican from the Third Congressional District. He put in a House joint resolution ''designating the square dance'' as the national folk dance of the United States.</p>
        <p>The most serious-minded bill writers? Marge Roukema, the Republican from Bergen County's Fifth Congressional District, is one. She is a ranking member of the House Banking Committee, and her proposals are mostly about mortgages and taxes.</p>
        <p>Rush Holt, the freshman Democrat from the 12th Congressional District, also did not seem to be having much fun. One of his bills calls for the mandatory registration and licensing of handguns. Another expresses the sense of Congress -- ''that the carrying of firearms into places of worship or educational and scholastic settings should be prohibited.''</p>
        <p>To be fair, Mr. Holt did have one special-interest bill, to temporarily suspend the duty on NORBLOC 7966, a treatment that blocks the effects of ultraviolet light.</p>
        <p>Answers to the other import duty suspension puzzles: Mr. Frelinghuysen is trying to help a confectioner who imports the dark chocolate and ice tea mix. And cyclohexadee-8-en-1-one is a synthetic musk, no longer made in this country, that a company in Mr. Rothman's district uses.</p>
        <p>Funny or serious, narrow or broad, all of these bills have one thing in common. Not one has yet become law, and with Congress rushing to adjourn, their chances are shrinking.</p>
