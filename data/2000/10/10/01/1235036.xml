        <p>LIKE most playwrights, Doug Michaels realizes that his is a solitary craft. That's why he decided six years ago to start a weekly playwright's workshop at the Schoolhouse in Croton Falls.</p>
        <p>''It's a blast,'' Mr. Michaels said from his home in Bedford. ''I can't think of a more enjoyable way to spend a Monday evening than in the company of other writers who are passionate about their work and the process of writing.''</p>

        <p>LIKE most playwrights, Doug Michaels realizes that his is a solitary craft. That's why he decided six years ago to start a weekly playwright's workshop at the Schoolhouse in Croton Falls.</p>
        <p>''It's a blast,'' Mr. Michaels said from his home in Bedford. ''I can't think of a more enjoyable way to spend a Monday evening than in the company of other writers who are passionate about their work and the process of writing.''</p>
        <p>A few miles south on Route 684 in Katonah, the Axial Theater is developing a batch of its own new plays. Bret Primack  and Howard Meyer started the Axial Theater more than a year ago because they wanted to develop their scripts with actors.</p>
        <p>''Instead of creating in a vacuum, I get instant feedback and my work gets produced regularly,'' said Mr. Primack, whose group works out of Barnspace, a performing arts space owned by Iris Solomon and also used for music and dance events. ''Being a part of this group is like being a member of a very loving, supportive family. It's the perfect environment in which to create.''</p>
        <p>Playwriting workshops like the Schoolhouse Writers Workshop and the Axial Theater are often described by their members as ''gymnasiums.'' They are peer groups meeting on a regular, year-round basis. Though there may be a nominal fee to cover operating expenses, the members do not pay for instruction. They meet so they can read their new material to other aspiring playwrights and receive feedback.</p>
        <p>''I have been frustrated by the time constraints placed on the very delicate process of theatrical invention,'' Mr. Meyer, of Yorktown, said. ''I found that three weeks of rehearsal was never enough time to sufficiently explore a play. This ensemble experience solves all those problems. I have been able to invite my favorite artists to engage in an open-ended process without any artificial time limitations placed on the work.''</p>
        <p>What distinguishes the Axial Theater and the Schoolhouse Writers Workshop from most other playwrights' groups in Westchester County is that they are affiliated with a producing theater. The Axial Theater has presented productions at Barnspace since last summer. It also produced Mr. Meyer's play ''The Kiss''and Mr. Primack's play ''The Fall of Athens'' at the Schoolhouse in August.</p>
        <p>The Schoolhouse Writers Workshop presents many staged readings throughout the year in addition to at least one annual production of a new work. ''And every year we place at least one play in the Samuel French Short Play Festival,'' Mr. Michaels said, referring to the Off Off Broadway showcase.</p>
        <p>Part of the appeal of both groups is the strong possibility of production. Mr. Michaels suggested this is why his group's members travel from as far away as Woodbury, Conn., to take part. Each group consists of roughly a dozen members with varying levels of achievement as playwrights. Mr. Michaels, for instance, is a professional cartoonist whose play ''The Original Last Wish Baby'' was published in Applause Theater Books' ''Best Short American Plays of 95-96.'' The other members include a copywriter, a wine merchant, a mother-and-daughter team, a mother of five, an actress and a theater reviewer for a weekly newspaper.</p>
        <p>The other draw to the group is the collaborative process, Mr. Michaels said. ''Writers bring in scenes, which we read and discuss,'' he said. ''When a play is completed, we pass it around and offer suggestions, then try to find a director for a staged public reading. The reading also affords the author the opportunity to have a discussion period with the audience afterward. From time to time, the Schoolhouse will opt to produce one of our plays on their stage.''</p>
        <p>Along the way the playwrights freely suggest changes they think may improve each other's scripts. ''After we read a scene, everyone in the group is free to speak their mind and offer criticism or encouragement or both,'' said Mr. Michaels, who serves as the group's moderator. ''Writers can filter the comments as they choose and decide if a rewrite is in order.''</p>
        <p>The Schoolhouse playwrights ask local directors to cast and stage their plays in either staged readings or full productions. The Axial Theater exclusively casts its own members throughout the process, Mr. Primack said. ''At the center of our group are actors,'' he said. ''For 11 of us, the principal focus is acting, although three of the actors write and two direct as well. Ideas for characters and situations are birthed in the weekly improvisation workshops. Playwrights then begin to write, bringing in works-in-progress for readings and feedback.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Meyer, a professional actor and director who only recently started writing, said the writers meet twice a week as production time nears. ''One session is strictly devoted to exploration -- improvisations and exercises to refine plot, character and relationships,'' he said. ''The other session is strictly for readings of scripts read by the actors who are cast in the roles.''</p>
        <p>The feedback process is paramount, he added. ''Honest, constructive criticism is the main priority. It's offered in a very supportive, nonantagonistic way.''</p>
        <p>The playwrights' ultimate goal, of course, is to see their works produced in regional or New York theaters with union actors. They are aware that it takes time.</p>
        <p>''Up till now we have only generated one-act material, which was our primary goal for the first year,'' Mr. Meyer said. ''As we move into our second year, we are setting our sights on more ambitious full-length events. In fact, 'The Kiss' is our first full-length effort. Hopefully, it will open us up to broader opportunities.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Primack spoke with equal patience: ''I'm certain it's only a matter of time before our plays move down from Westchester to Manhattan,'' he said. ''The work we're doing is as good as things happening in the city today.''</p>
        <p>Until that day comes, these writers enjoy the camaraderie of their fellow aspiring playwrights, Mr. Michaels said. ''Writers working in their home alone with their keyboard and a cat hovering somewhere on the bookcase gain so much by joining in the company of other writers,'' he said. ''On the one hand it's motivation to keep at it every week. On the other, it forces a writer to defend his work. That's a good thing because all work gets challenged at some point, so you may as well harden yourself to the process and get a solid handle on what it is you're trying to say.</p>
        <p>''When things look bleak,'' he added, ''it's nice to know someone who's been through it and can suggest a theater or competition that just might be the one that opens all the doors.''</p>
