        <p>Q: You've conducted trade negotiations all over the world, in places with widely varying social mores. Have any of your counterparts in other countries ever had difficulty accepting a woman as a legitimate government authority?</p>
        <p>Because my rank is high -- I'm an ambassador and a cabinet secretary -- my foreign counterparts treat me with the deference one might expect. Rank is much more important than gender, and rank can tend to overcome any potential gender bias. To the extent women are thought to be, in general, more perceptive about people, more aware of their surroundings, more sensitive to body language, it is a decided advantage to be a woman in a negotiation, particularly in watching. The body always speaks well before the mouth ever opens.</p>

        <p>Q: You've conducted trade negotiations all over the world, in places with widely varying social mores. Have any of your counterparts in other countries ever had difficulty accepting a woman as a legitimate government authority?</p>
        <p>Because my rank is high -- I'm an ambassador and a cabinet secretary -- my foreign counterparts treat me with the deference one might expect. Rank is much more important than gender, and rank can tend to overcome any potential gender bias. To the extent women are thought to be, in general, more perceptive about people, more aware of their surroundings, more sensitive to body language, it is a decided advantage to be a woman in a negotiation, particularly in watching. The body always speaks well before the mouth ever opens.</p>
        <p>Ah, the trade secrets of a good negotiator. Tell us more.</p>
        <p>First, you have to know what you want. That sounds self-evident, but you'd be surprised how many people don't actually know what they want with the kind of precision that a negotiation demands. Then, you have to think of the 2,000 ways to get to where you want to go: what the trades might be, what the arguments might be, what the moves might be on the other side. And you watch carefully, and listen carefully, talk less, and remain persistent.</p>
        <p>Do you use these skills at home on your family?</p>
        <p>Yes, and they don't work with my children. They usually tease me when I begin a sentence, ''Instead of that, why don't you. . . .'' or ''As an alternative. . . .'' or ''How about doing it this way?'' They figure they're in for a series of protracted talks.</p>
        <p>You must have a pretty crazy life, with all the traveling you have to do.</p>
        <p>The travel demands are very heavy. I stopped counting the number of times I'd been around the world after the first term. This is now the end of the second term. I keep my trips as short as possible. I land, even when I go to Asia, and I start working immediately.</p>
        <p>How does someone who lives on a plane figure out what time it is?</p>
        <p>I just decide in my own mind it is the time it is wherever I happen to be.</p>
        <p>How do you deal with jet lag?</p>
        <p>I have two almost-foolproof means of dealing with jet lag. No. 1, drink lots of water on the airplane. No caffeine. No liquor of any sort, or wine. Just lots and lots and lots of water, which means I stroll up and down the aisle with some frequency. My second observation is, There is no such thing as jet lag. I think there's a psychological component.</p>
        <p>George W. Bush takes his own feather pillow with him wherever he goes on the road. What do you take from home?</p>
        <p>My Ben &amp; Jerry's cow-print socks. When my feet get cold, I'm cold.</p>
        <p>Do you help your daughters with their homework from 30,000 feet or from 7,000 miles away?</p>
        <p>If I need to, I'll take copies of what they're doing. Last year, I was traveling with ''Macbeth'' so my daughter and I could discuss it on the phone. When my older daughter was getting bat-mitzvahed, I took a copy of the Torah portion with me. The advantage to helping her on the phone was that she learned to read Hebrew very quickly. She could zoom through very,</p>
        <p>very fast. Because, of course, overseas calls are expensive.</p>
        <p>What does the China deal mean for the average American, the average New Yorker?</p>
        <p>For the average New Yorker, China will now allow direct investment in its telecom and Internet operations. For upstate New York and farming communities there, longstanding bans on a variety of American agricultural products have now been lifted.</p>
        <p>You've been working on this for seven and a half years -- with a lot of points along the way when it must have seemed as if it would never really happen. After you heard the final tally on the Senate vote, what did you do?</p>
        <p>I sat quietly at my desk when I got back from Capitol Hill where I was watching the vote. I sat down and smiled quietly.</p>
