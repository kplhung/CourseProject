        <p>A case that seemed like small potatoes -- a court decision preventing the Village of Huntington Bay from restricting the Huntington Yacht Club's plans to add another 14 floating boat slips -- has cast doubt on the validity of decades of decisions by Long Island villages regarding the development of waterfront properties.</p>
        <p>Thousands of cases could be reopened as a result of the ruling, which at the very least seems likely to make more work for the lawyers.</p>
        <p>''The decision calls into question any village permit issued for a dock, bulkhead or piling within tidewaters in and around Nassau and Suffolk counties,'' said John L. Rivkin of Uniondale, the yacht club's lawyer.</p>
        <p>The decision by the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court in Brooklyn held that the Town of Huntington, not the Village of Huntington Bay, has jurisdiction over tidewaters. The ruling was made on May 1, but Mr. Rivkin didn't begin trumpeting the result until after Aug. 23, when the time to appeal the decision expired. Mr. Rivkin said it applies to every village on Long Island that has a boundary defined by the tide.</p>
        <p>''Tidewaters such as Lloyd Harbor, Reynolds Channel and the Great South Bay are all now subject to permitting discretion of the towns in which such waters are located, rather than the local villages,'' Mr. Rivkin said. ''In the past, many villages assumed zoning jurisdiction over the tidewaters on the theory -- albeit erroneous -- that the tidewaters lie within the territorial boundaries of the villages.''</p>
        <p>''Now that this is the law, it erases all village zoning authority throughout Nassau and Suffolk as it relates to waterfront projects,'' he said. ''So if you are selling your home and you have a dock O.K.'d by a village, the permit is void and there is a cloud on the title of your property.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rivkin said the ruling gives new hope to homeowners who were denied a permit by a village to build a pier or other waterfront structure. Such homeowners might also wish to consider legal action against the village, he said, arguing that they have ''lost not only the use and enjoyment of a dock, but their property has also diminished in value.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rivkin said he is trying to learn how many waterfront property owners were ''aggrieved'' by villages to determine if a class action suit is warranted. But he said he could not estimate the number of waterfront property owners in Long Island's incorporated villages. Most of the North Shore waterfront from Great Neck to Port Jefferson is in incorporated villages; most of the rest of Long Island's 1,100 miles of shoreline is unincorporated. (The Island's two cities, Glen Cove and Long Beach, are not affected by the ruling.)</p>
        <p>Others who do not stand to benefit from additional legal fees backed Mr. Rivkin's view of the impact of the ruling. But the Mayor of Huntington Bay, Herbert F. Morrow, described Mr. Rivkin's analysis as a ''stretch.'' He said the court was addressing a unique situation involving a yacht club whose property straddled both village and town jurisdictions.</p>
        <p>''We took the position that the pier extension was totally in the village,'' and the court disagreed, Mr. Morrow said. ''I don't see this as a big issue, placing an onerous cloud over villages. It's wrong to say it has such broad application.''</p>
        <p>He scoffed at Mr. Rivkin's assertion that many towns had delegated their jurisdiction over tidal and underwater lands to the villages. ''No village would take the position that it has sole jurisdiction,'' he said. ''The Town of Huntington never gave away its authority. It simply said to applicants, go to the village and then come back to the town.''</p>
        <p>One homeowner with more than a passing interest in the case is Patrick Molloy III, who was sued in 1996 by the Village of Sag Harbor when he sought to widen a slip to accommodate his 195-foot boat. He said the court decision ''validates our position. The village never had any right to tell us what we could do with our underwater property.''</p>
        <p>He said that because the village never obtained a stop-work order, he made the necessary modifications for his boat and now plans to move for dismissal of the village's suit based on the court's decision.</p>
        <p>Burt H. Stutchin's application to build a pier extending from his property in Lloyd Harbor ran afoul of a recent village ordinance forbidding piers more than 75 feet long or piles driven into water more than 2 feet deep at low tide.</p>
        <p>''All of my neighbors have docks that were grandfathered in,'' he said. ''Everybody and his uncle has a dock in the inner harbor but me.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Stutchin said that last year he lost a federal court challenge to the village ordinance. After the May 1 ruling, he said, he consulted with Mr. Rivkin about pursuing the challenge in state court, but had made no decision. ''It's aggravating, costly and I don't know if I'm going to sue,'' he said.</p>
        <p>There's no assurance that a town would grant a construction permit that a village had denied. The attorney for the Village of Lloyd Harbor, John Ritter, said the village ordinance was intended to prevent a profusion of piers that would congest the narrow harbor, and that concern would still be legitimate regardless of whether it was the town or the village issuing the permits.</p>
        <p>The impact of the ruling is open to dispute on other grounds. For example, Mr. Ritter said he did not believe the state decision applied to his village at all. He said that although the boundary of most villages is the high-water mark, Lloyd Harbor has zoning jurisdiction into the middle of Huntington Harbor.</p>
        <p>''The line of incorporation of the village is in the middle of the water,'' he said. ''We don't have ownership of the bottom land, but we have zoning control over the private use of it.''</p>
        <p>Helen J. Rosenblum, the attorney for the Town of Shelter Island, said she viewed the state court decision as helpful to the town in its ongoing court battle with the Village of Dering Harbor.</p>
        <p>''The village wanted the ability to issue permits for moorings in Dering Harbor, but we never delegated that authority to them,'' she said. ''They asserted that certain state laws gave them that jurisdiction. But we said those laws don't apply to us because we are older than the state and we have certain rights to ownership of the land.''</p>
        <p>The special counsel hired by the town to handle the case, William W. Esseks of Riverhead, explained that the original 1666 deed to Shelter Island included the land and its coves, creeks and bays. By 1910, Mr. Esseks said, the land had been partitioned into so many pieces over the years that it was decided to ''hold a judicial sale to clear up the question of title to the lands under water.''</p>
        <p>The sale was held in 1919, and the purchasers transferred title to the Town of Shelter Island.</p>
        <p>''I can't think of any other place where this happened,'' said Mr. Esseks. ''This is a situation where the town owns the land under the water.''</p>
        <p>Howard E. Pachman of Commack, the lawyer for the Village of Dering Harbor, said he had not yet studied the arguments in the Village of Huntington Bay case.</p>
        <p>The state court decision is also of interest to the towns of East Hampton, Southampton and Southold because they maintain independently elected boards of trustees that manage the waters and other natural resources under patents originally received from the English Crown. Scott A. Strough, president of the Southampton Board of Trustees, said the state, particularly the state Department of Environmental Conservation, has not always recognized his town's jurisdiction and that he hoped this latest court decision would end future conflicts.</p>
        <p>Ray Cowen, the D.E.C.'s regional director, said that although the court case may jeopardize the jurisdiction exercised by some villages, ''it is a village-town thing and has nothing to do with the State of New York. We conceded long ago that certain areas of the tidal coastline of Long Island are under the jurisdiction of the various towns. There is no argument about that.''</p>
