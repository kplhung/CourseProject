        <p>African-Americans and Hispanics have a much greater chance of being stopped by the police in San Diego than whites and Asian-Americans, according to the results of a survey released this week.</p>
        <p>The survey, conducted for the San Diego Police Department in the first six months of the year, found that whites and Asian-Americans had an 8 percent chance of being pulled over while African-Americans and Hispanics had a 14 percent chance. The chances were calculated by comparing the ethnic breakdown of those stopped in traffic with the number of people of driving age in San Diego.</p>
        <p>The survey found that while blacks are 8 percent of the driving age population in San Diego, they accounted for 12 percent of the traffic stops and 20 percent of those searched. Hispanics, who are 20 percent of the driving-age population, made up 29 percent of the stops and 50 percent of the searches.</p>
        <p>''We have these numbers, and the numbers are troubling,'' said Dale Kelly Bankhead, a spokeswoman for the American Civil Liberties Union of San Diego and Imperial Counties.</p>
        <p>But Ms. Bankhead applauded the department for studying the issue, which has been raised in cities across the country, calling the department the first to study racial profiling voluntarily.</p>
        <p>At a news conference on Thursday to announce the results, Police Chief David Bejarano said there was nothing in the initial findings that made him believe officers were acting improperly. And in a videotape shown to the department's 2,100 officers, Mr. Bejarano said they should not take the results as a negative reflection on their work.</p>
        <p>However, Mr. Bejarano, the city's first Hispanic police chief, said the numbers did indicate that more study was needed. The numbers announced this week were preliminary figures, and the study will continue for the rest of the year.</p>
        <p>The authorities said the results could have been skewed by several factors. For example, analysts used the 1990 Census to determine the number of people of driving age in San Diego, but critics contend that  minorities are underreported in the survey. Also because San Diego borders Mexico, many Mexicans drive over every day, but would not be counted in the Census numbers.</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Bejarano said that the study had raised serious questions and that if abuses were found they would be addressed. ''If there are problems,'' he said, ''we want to make sure we address them with training, supervision and, if necessary, discipline.''</p>
        <p>Racial profiling, a practice where the police stop motorists based on their race, has become a contentious issue nationwide. At least five states have outlawed the practice and at the suggestion of United States Attorney General Janet Reno, the police are beginning to gather statistics on stops and searches. Still, many departments, including the Los Angeles Police Department, balk at the suggestion.</p>
        <p>The San Diego police began keeping records of stops and searches in January after concerns were raised by community leaders. For more than 91,000 stops, the police recorded the date and time, reason, driver's sex, age and race and action taken.</p>
        <p>The information was then analyzed by academics from Eastern Kentucky University, Vanderbilt University and San Diego State University with the police and representatives from groups like the N.A.A.C.P., Urban League and A.C.L.U. reviewing the results.</p>
