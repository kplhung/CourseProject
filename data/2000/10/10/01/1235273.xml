      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Gleaming and new, yet hollow and unused, the 28-story Water Resources Administration Building in southwest Beijing stands as a mocking monument to the problems plaguing farmers like Liu Guangyue, whose rice crop has failed this year because of the lack of water.</p>
        <p>It also stands as a marker of the corruption riddling China's Communist Party.</p>
        <p>The cylindrical tower with its huge pillared entrance was built by the Ministry of Water Resources's party leaders with $72 million they were supposed to spend on a national network of canals, reservoirs, dams and dikes meant to protect people like Mr. Liu from droughts and floods.</p>
        <p>But both natural disasters have haunted Mr. Liu, 34, who lives in central China in the plain between the Yangtze and Huai Rivers, where a more developed system would channel the rivers' overflow away from farmland in wet years and trap it in reservoirs for use in years that are dry. Mr. Liu's land has been alternately inundated and parched in the last five years.</p>
        <p>''We won't get anything from the land this year because there is no water now,'' he said recently, squinting from beneath a battered straw hat at his withered rice seedlings.</p>
        <p>The Ministry of Water Resources cannot be blamed for the weather, which has brought very little rain to northern China this year, but mismanagement and corruption have wasted hundreds of millions of dollars in the last decade -- more than $360 million last year alone -- meant for flood and drought control and left China ill-prepared for disasters.</p>
        <p>''It's indisputable that because of a lack of funds many water irrigation and anti-flood facilities all over the country have not been maintained, leaving the risk of many disasters,'' said the state-run Legal Daily in an article about the Beijing building.</p>
        <p>It is just one of the ways that graft throughout the country's many-layered government is draining the state treasury, crippling the economy and angering the people that the government is supposed to serve.</p>
        <p>China's National Audit Bureau reported that more than $15 billion in government funds was squandered in 1999, a figure that is said to have stunned even the country's unflappable prime minister, Zhu Rongji. Much of the money ended up in private hands, skimmed off unauthorized projects like the water ministry's building in Beijing.</p>
        <p>The tower was supposedly built to house ministry offices, but only one floor was actually allocated for that purpose. For the rest of the building, the ministry's mandarins envisioned restaurants and a hotel and conference center where waistcoated staff would serve customers to the accompaniment of piped-in music. Rent from the offices was supposed to spill into a secret coffer.</p>
        <p>But the ministry ran short of money before the building was finished. By the time government auditors became aware of the building, which never appeared on the ministry's books, the ministry's party committee had recalled $20 million from dozens of water projects around the country to pay for the construction.</p>
        <p>The State Council, China's cabinet, seized the building after it was discovered and plans to sell it to the highest bidder soon.</p>
        <p>The flood of public monies into private hands is leaving China littered with such jetsam of corruption: half-built office towers, unfinished bridges and roads to nowhere. Beijing has accelerated a national drive to try to stem the tide of corruption, executing droves of wayward party members -- most recently the Parliament's vice chairman.</p>
        <p>That's because corruption is inherent to a system where a one-party hierarchy, based on political patronage and protection, controls the allocation and use of state-owned assets, critics say.</p>
        <p>''Those who are in control of assets have found it easy to allocate in a way that lines their pockets, especially given the ridiculously low compensation packages still in place for officials,'' said Sin-ming Shaw, a visiting scholar at Harvard University who has studied corruption in China.</p>
        <p>The corruption has only grown worse as the party's ideological foundation deteriorates and central government controls relax in the slow transition to a market economy.</p>
        <p>''China can never rid itself of corruption unless and until the leaders have the courage to officially dump its Communist Constitution and put in a new ideology which is based on private property,'' Mr. Shaw said.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the country's Communist Party elders worry that the corruption is undermining their credibility and spreading cynicism. Graft is so pervasive that most people see high-ranking party officials singled out for execution not as isolated bad apples, but as scapegoats who mismanaged their political connections.</p>
        <p>In the case of the water resource ministry, Niu Maosheng, the minister under whose watch the corruption occurred and who was implicated by the auditors, was reassigned as governor of Hebei Province, hardly a severe reproof.</p>
        <p>Increasingly, aggrieved people are banding together to fight corruption, either physically or legally by appealing to higher powers in Beijing. Their efforts rarely win much relief.</p>
        <p>When farmers in Shaanxi Province failed to get satisfaction last year in a lawsuit against party officials who they contended were taxing them illegally, they sent their lawyer to appeal to the central government. He was arrested for fomenting unrest and sentenced to five years in jail. Farmers are now petitioning the Shaanxi provincial government to overturn his conviction.</p>
        <p>The cynicism is heightened by the muzzling of the press, which is only allowed to report selectively on corruption and is never permitted to dig very deep. Gao Qinrong, a reporter for the state-run New China News Agency, was sentenced to 13 years on charges including bribery and pimping after his expose of an irrigation project in Shanxi Province that was an elaborate sham.</p>
        <p>Corruption involving water has become one of the country's most emotional flash points. More than 100 cities in northern China are rationing dwindling water supplies. Anger toward the ministry is high. In Anqiu, a small town in eastern Shandong Province, people used to surviving on seepage from the Mushan Reservoir went on a rampage in July when the ministry tried to seal the reservoir's dam without first installing promised pumps and water lines. .</p>
        <p>The auditors' report on the ministry, which President Jiang Zemin ordered after floods killed 3,000 people and destroyed $20 billion in property in 1998, uncovered a maze of bank accounts that diverted Ministry of Water into slush funds, sideline businesses and investments, including real estate and the stock market. Some of the money was used to buy homes and cars for ministry officials  or was given to them directly in the form of off-the-book ''bonuses.''</p>
        <p>The opportunity for graft will only increase when the ministry embarks on a huge scheme to divert water from the Tibetan plateau to the chronically arid north. The plan, a dream of the late Mao Zedong, involves a series of pipelines and canals covering more than 700 miles. So far, according to the auditors' report, it has diverted more money -- at least $8 million -- than water.</p>
