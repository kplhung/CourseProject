        <p>WHEN it comes to games, it seems there are those who do and those who don't -- enjoy playing them, that is.</p>
        <p>Natalie Hertz is definitely in the first category. Asked how long she has been playing bridge, she replies, ''Try forever.''</p>
        <p>In fact, Ms. Hertz, a 65-year-old lawyer from Harrison, learned when she was 13, growing up in New Rochelle. Her parents played regularly, and she began feeling it was simply the thing to do. ''I think what is fascinating for me is the challenge of using this limited number of symbols to communicate,'' she said recently. ''It's like communicating in a different language, getting a puzzle and seeing what you can come up with.''</p>
        <p>After graduating from New Rochelle High School, Ms. Hertz went to Cornell University, where she and a group of girls started a regular bridge game in the dormitory. Soon, they were serious players. ''We got a lot of kibitzers, people who just came to watch and talk, and we had to put our foot down and tell them to leave or be quiet,'' she said.</p>
        <p>One of the most annoying was one Daniel Hertz, who kept making wisecracks. ''If anyone had told me this was the man I'd eventually marry,'' she said, ''I'd have told them they were out of their mind.'' Fortunately for him, he also turned out to be a good bridge player, and the two began a partnership that has lasted 45 years.</p>
        <p>''He's my principal and favorite partner,'' Ms. Hertz said. ''It's unusual. There aren't many husband-and-wife bridge partners. Either the partnership dissolves or the marriage dissolves -- not necessarily in that order.''</p>
        <p>She and Dr. Hertz, who is a psychiatrist practicing in White Plains, have thrived in both areas because ''we communicate well -- that's the essence of a good partnership in marriage and in bridge.'' Only once did he criticize her audibly when she made a mistake, muttering not far enough under his breath, ''Unbelievable.'' It took her months to get over it.</p>
        <p>But in general, they complement each other well: ''In every marriage, there's a designated worrier,'' she said. ''It's the same with bridge. I tend to be an overbidder, optimistic. He's the worrier. He tends to be an underbidder, very cautious.''</p>
        <p>These days, they travel throughout the country, playing in tournaments, both under the auspices of the American Contract Bridge League. The prizes are not monetary; they are distributed in points, which, Ms. Hertz said, are the ''equivalent of gold stars -- people ask what are you winning, and I tell them, it is simply the honor of winning.'' In terms of rank, they are both Gold Life Masters.</p>
        <p>Tournaments are held in hotels and convention centers; often, competition means playing 12 hours a day with only short breaks for meals. Training is similar to what an athlete undergoes for a sports event. Ms. Hertz walks several hours a day; Dr. Hertz plays squash. ''If you get out of shape, you see it at the bridge table,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Polly Wright's chosen game is for her more a matter of intellect than physicality. Ms. Wright, a 46-year-old from Eastchester, teaches chess for the National Scholastic Chess Foundation in White Plains, gives private lessons to adults and plays in and directs tournaments. At one time she was one of the top 50 ranked women in America and is still a Class A player in the United States Chess Federation.</p>
        <p>''You can compete against people vastly different from yourself in age, unlike in an athletic event,'' said Ms. Wright, who knows a little about athletic events, since she also competes in triathlons. ''Young, old, whatever -- you'll see 75-year-olds playing against 7-year-olds. Also, I like the fact that in chess everyone is starting with the same 16 men -- there's no element of chance, as there is in games in which you're dealt a hand of cards. And, it requires critical thinking, planning ahead, organizational skills, which is why it's great to teach to young people.''</p>
        <p>One of her most grueling matches recently was against an 8-year-old boy. ''I struggled and struggled against this kid, and I finally beat him only because he dropped one pawn,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Tournaments take place everywhere from local clubs to major venues -- theaters, meeting halls -- in big cities. Ms. Wright recalled a world championship match in Manhattan in 1991 between Gary Kasparov and Anatoly Karpov. The audience saw the action on large screens behind the players and listened to commentary on headsets.</p>
        <p>Her own competitive play takes her to 30 tournaments a year, mostly in the Northeast. To prepare, she reads books by the masters and immerses herself in details of plays that they have successfully used. She also plays quickie games over the Internet, although she finds these less satisfying than the real thing. ''A two-dimensional board is just not as good to work on as a real, three-dimensional one.''</p>
        <p>Chess, she believes, requires and enhances logical, strategical thinking.</p>
        <p>Yet she confesses to a few less than scientific personal superstitions. She has a large collection of chess pins, which commemorate different events. She wears one to each tournament as a good-luck talisman. Her favorite: a tiny sterling silver square chess board with a little bishop on it.</p>
        <p>It was given to her by the Grand Master, George Koltanowski, 14 years ago after she asked him for a memento. ''He was an absolutely brilliant player, and this is a beautiful pin,'' she said. ''It really is a perfect little piece of geometry.''</p>
        <p>Aesthetics are part of the appeal of mah-jongg for one player, Madelon Sheff. Ms. Sheff, a 64-year-old education consultant from Hartsdale, loves the look, feel and sound of the tiles. No longer made of actual ivory, they are little, white, plastic rectangles with colorful drawings and inscriptions; the clicking noise they make when handled is music to Ms. Sheff's ears. In explaining the game to a novice, she seems to delight in just saying the names of the three suits: bam (for bamboo), crak (for characters) and dot (for circles).</p>
        <p>She also likes the fact that this is a game with history. Materials she took off the Internet suggest whimsically that mah-jongg ''may have been played on Noah's Ark during the 40 days and nights of rain.'' The more logical explanation, the Internet piece continued, is that it evolved from games played during the Sung Dynasty (A.D. 960 through 1279) and the Ming Dynasty (A.D. 1368 through 1644) and was popularized in its current form in 1850. In the early 1900's, it was introduced to the West. By the 1920's, a full-fledged mah-jongg craze was sweeping the United States. Supply could barely keep up with demand as people brought their mah-jongg sets to country clubs, hotels, cruise ships and, of course, their living rooms.</p>
        <p>The first mah-jongg games in Ms. Sheff's memory were played in the Pelham Parkway section of the Bronx where she grew up. ''I was 6 years old; I would watch these women who'd come to this pretty little park and set up their tables and play for hours,'' she said. ''They were mostly housewives with New York accents; they drank chocolate egg creams and ate pretzels and pickles from a barrel. Even then I knew I wanted to be part of this.''</p>
        <p>It was not until she was working as a teacher 20 years later that she actually began to play regularly. After a number of years playing, she became too busy and took a hiatus until two years ago. Then, she and some friends were fondly recalling their mah-jongg days, and before they could say bam, crak, dot, they were rummaging through their garages for their old sets.</p>
        <p>Now Ms. Sheff and pals from Hartsdale get together one night a week; another group plays in Yonkers all day on Mondays. They follow rules of the National Mah-Jongg League, playing for hours (each individual game lasts about 15 minutes), talking about everything from food to politics.</p>
        <p>''We bring sandwiches and fruit and candy; one of the women bakes the most delicious rugelach, and the coffee pot keeps flowing,'' Ms. Sheff said. ''We talk about  Rick Lazio and about Hillary, and who we like, we talk about everything.''</p>
        <p>One thing they don't need to discuss are the rules and regulations of this very intricate game. Most who play the game know it backward and forward, with all of its arcane nuances. This does not mean, however, that mah-jongg comes easily to everyone. ''There's a story that Albert Einstein was visiting a colleague whose wife was playing mah-jongg with her friends,'' Ms. Sheff said. ''And Einstein said, 'This game looks much too complicated for me.' ''</p>
