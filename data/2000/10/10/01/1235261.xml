        <p>Adult children are often expected to care for aging parents who become frail or ill, but a new survey has found that many may not be completely prepared for the task.</p>
        <p>In the survey, conducted by Family Circle magazine and the Kaiser Family Foundation, 43 percent of the respondents said they knew little or nothing about their parents' health insurance, and 45 percent did not even know who their doctors were. Almost one-third said they were unaware of where their parents kept financial statements and other important documents like health insurance cards.</p>
        <p>The survey, conducted over the summer, involved 806 adults nationwide who had a parent 65 or older.</p>
        <p>Most of the participants knew that Medicare was the health insurance program serving people over 65. But many were not familiar with the program's basic restrictions: only 38 percent knew that Medicare did not generally pay for prescription drugs, and just 34 percent knew that Medicare did not pay for long-term care.</p>
        <p>Only 37 percent of participants were aware that Medicaid was the health insurance program for low-income families.</p>
        <p>''Child care issues were the most talked-about stresses for families of the 20th century,'' said Susan Ungaro, editor in chief of Family Circle. ''We believe that caring for our aging parents is the new most pressing stress of the 21st century.''</p>
