        <p>''The landlord would not renew our lease,'' said Chris Mihalislis, who manages the new location with her husband, Gus. ''He just didn't want a restaurant there anymore,'' she added. She and her husband have had 33 restaurants in the 28 years they have been married. They now own four, as well as a bar, all in Brooklyn.</p>
