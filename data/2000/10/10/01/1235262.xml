        <p>One of the biggest clouds over any parent's finances is the cost of college tuition -- and the long haul toward setting aside enough to cover it.</p>
        <p>One year of tuition at a four-year private college cost $15,380 last year, and a year at a public college cost $3,356, according to the College Board's latest calculation.</p>
        <p>And a survey over the summer of 294 parents, conducted by by SSB Citi Asset Management Group, a Citigroup subsidiary, found that most parents felt they would have enough money when the time came to send their children to college. However, when asked to specify the ways they expected to pay for their children's college educations, most cited financial aid and scholarships. About half said current income.</p>
        <p>Though the survey found that most parents were saving for their children's education, about three-quarters of them had not taken advantage of programs that automatically stash money into savings accounts, like state college savings plans or prepaid tuition plans.</p>
