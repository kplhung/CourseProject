        <p>To a casual passer-by, the second-floor window overlooking Washington Street in Perth Amboy, N.J., is filled with nothing more than smudgy streaks of pale white, reddish-orange, light gray and green.</p>
        <p>But Ramona and Marcelino Collado, who live in the apartment behind the window, say that the colors recently started creating an image of the Virgin Mary. And in the last 10 days or so, their belief has spread, first by word-of-mouth and then by media accounts.</p>
        <p>Daily, hundreds of the devout and the curious have come to the working-class Hispanic neighborhood to peer and to pray. Some stand outside, squinting. Others climb the stairs to the apartment and troop into the Collados' living room to kneel before a large framed picture of Christ or  press their hands to the window pane.  They leave candles and bouquets, turning the sparse little apartment into a shrine.</p>
        <p>One visitor called her experience mystical; another, breath-taking.  But Thomas Connelly, a 48-year-old salesman, found the window slightly unsatisfactory. In 1992, he said, he had visited the home of Joseph Januszkiewicz, in Marlboro, N.J., who said Mary appeared to him on the first Sunday of each month.</p>
        <p>Mr. Connelly recalled experiencing a special feeling and the scent of roses, things he was not getting out of the Collados' window. ''The window's very vivid in color,'' he said, ''but I don't know what to look for. I can see kind of a face if I imagine it.''</p>
        <p>So far, the Collados' neighbors are accepting, but then their apparition is still new. In Marlboro, the township grew irritated as its Mary neared her third year of visitations. Seekers who congregated by the thousands created traffic jams and unsanitary conditions. And the Diocese of Trenton, taking pains to remain respectful of those who believed in the apparition, finally declared that no miracle had occurred.</p>
        <p>The Diocese of Metuchen, which includes Perth Amboy, has so far declined to comment on the Collados' window.</p>
