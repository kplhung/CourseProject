        <p>THE network television business continues to undergo enormous change, but how strange is this: the hot network of the fall season looks to be CBS.</p>
        <p>That's CBS, once the butt of jokes by all its rivals for having a core audience of viewers who signed on to see Jack Benny and haven't quit yet.</p>
        <p>The jokes, of course, stopped this summer with the spectacular success of ''Survivor,'' the reality series that had most of the nation, even those under the age of 30, talking about CBS in a different way. As the new season starts this week, almost every close observer of network television is identifying CBS as the network with the most positive momentum -- and the best chance to wind up next spring with an audience that is significantly younger than the one it had last year at the same time.</p>
        <p>Because ''Survivor'' had so many viewers over all -- its final episode beat the Academy Awards telecast and was second only to the Super Bowl as the most-watched show of the television year -- CBS was able to promote its fall lineup far more effectively than any other network could. This may not have mattered in previous years, when the new shows promoted by CBS during broadcasts of big events like the World series were less than worthy of the attention. But this fall, by almost every reckoning, CBS has plenty to promote.</p>
        <p>Several advertising agency executives have selected ''Bette,'' a comedy series starring Bette Midler, as the show most likely to break through as a real hit (as opposed to one that makes it only because it is adjacent to another hit, like ''Suddenly Susan'' and ''Stark Raving Mad'' -- lackluster comedies that in seasons past gained audiences from their positions in NBC's Thursday night lineup).</p>
        <p>Steve Sternberg, the senior vice president for broadcast research for TN Media, which buys television commercial time for advertisers and analyzes prospects for new series every season, said: ''Over all, CBS has the best lineup of new shows. They had very, very good program development.''</p>
        <p>In ''Bette,'' which has its premiere on Oct. 11, Ms. Midler plays herself, with a touch of the old Lucy thrown in. She sings and does pratfalls, surrounded by a fictionalized version of her real-life family. CBS believes the show it on Wednesdays at 8 p.m., leading off a night, a move that is rarely made with a new series.</p>
        <p>Following ''Bette'' at 8:30 is ''Welcome to New York,'' a comedy about a television weatherman from Indiana brought into a caldron of competition and personal rivalries on a morning show in New York.</p>
        <p>''Welcome to New York'' has also received some strong advance notice from critics, although the CBS show a most certain to start off with the biggest amount of built-in attention is ''The Fugitive,'' beginning this Friday at 8, simply because it is an unashamed remake of a television classic, the 1960's series that starred David Janssen.</p>
        <p>''The Fugitive'' is joined by two other crime dramas: ''C.S.I.'' (Fridays at 9), heavy on forensic science, and ''The District'' (Saturdays at 10), in which Craig T. Nelson plays a police chief in Washington. Both shows stand a better than reasonable chance of emerging as successful, said Mr. Sternberg, who named ''The District'' as one of the year's likely hits.</p>
        <p>Even a quirky new family drama called ''That's Life,'' on Saturdays at 8, could prove appealing to viewers, Mr. Sternberg said, leaving ''Yes, Dear'' (Mondays at 8:30), about two couples and their differing methods of child rearing, as the only one of the seven new CBS shows being dismissed by critics and analysts like Mr. Sternberg.</p>
        <p>It is extremely rare for any network to have six new shows that are seen as having a fair chance at surviving a first season. If three or four of them pitch in with solid ratings, the CBS season will have to be considered a major success. (NBC has three of last fall's new entries -- ''The West Wing,'' ''Third Watch'' and ''Law and Order: Special Victims Unit'' -- on this fall's schedule, one of the best success ratios in recent years.)</p>
        <p>Even without a boost from the new shows, CBS is virtually certain to accomplishtwo significant goals this season: improving its overall ratings and bringing in more young adult viewers, the kind that advertisers pay a premium to reach. The reason is that ''Survivor'' will be back for a second edition in January, starting, as it happens, on the night that CBS is also broadcasting the Super Bowl.</p>
        <p>''CBS is going to be a lot better and is going to get a lot younger this year,'' Mr. Sternberg said. ''It has 'Survivor,' and it is going to get much more promotion on the cable channels owned by Viacom, like MTV and VH1.'' (Viacom is the parent company of CBS, as well as those music channels.)</p>
        <p>''And 'Survivor' even makes the shows around it younger,'' Mr. Sternberg added. ''Shows like 'Everybody Loves Raymond' only have audiences that tend to look old because they're on CBS. That show and some others will probably be younger this year.''</p>
        <p>Can CBS challenge ABC for the leadership in prime time? Most analysts doubt it, because ABC will have four nights a week of ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,'' its now-entrenched game show hit.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Sternberg said that starting in January, when ''Survivor'' rolls out a new group of tribal adventurers in Australia, CBS will almost certainly start beating up on everybody else.</p>
        <p>And if a few of the new fall shows become hits, he said, ''CBS could make the season interesting.''</p>
