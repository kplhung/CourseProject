        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>When Signature Theater honors a single writer over an entire season, it bestows a sort of Olympian status on that individual. Jesse McKinley interviewed five of these chosen dramatists [''A Reunion of Playwrights Shaped in One Crucible,'' Sept. 24)], and they all concluded that writing itself, not recognition, provides the greatest satisfaction.</p>
        <p>In Greek mythology, when mortals challenge the gods, they get turned into spiders, dolphins or constellations. Yet when one has something substantive to offer, he gets a throne on the mountaintop. Dionysus makes wine. Gods like wine. Dionysus is in.</p>
        <p>Struggling playwrights who cringe and imagine seasons of our own on Signature's Mount Olympus would do well to remember: we've got to plant vines, grow grapes, harvest, press, bottle, ferment and age. All hard work. For heaven's sake, let's enjoy the work. Apparently it's the best part.</p>
        <p>ROB ACKERMAN  Manhattan</p>
        <p>The writer is a playwright whose first Off Broadway production, ''Tabletop,'' opens in October at the American Place Theater.</p>
