        <p>SOME people just can't get enough of school, no matter how old they are.</p>

        <p>SOME people just can't get enough of school, no matter how old they are.</p>
        <p>Take Stuart Friedman. He's a partner in a Manhattan law firm, the kind of busy guy who returns phone calls from taxis en route to business trips. So what was he doing committing one evening a week to Mark Fichtel's classes at the Larchmont Mamaroneck Center for Continuing Education?</p>
        <p>So far as Mr. Friedman is concerned, Mr. Fichtel's teaching -- first in a class about Russia and then one about Spain -- was well worth any contortions in his schedule.</p>
        <p>''I took the second course because the first one Mark taught was so good,'' said Mr. Friedman, who had scheduled his child's soccer practice, where he coaches, just before Mr. Fichtel's class. ''I always had had an interest in Russian history and literature, and the course was superb, at a college level, but a college course without a text or readings where it was on fast forward, sophisticated  and detailed.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Friedman is one of the students who are changing the face of adult and continuing education courses, once overwhelmingly tailored to the interests of active retirees who had plenty of leisure time for a class in art appreciation or cooking.</p>
        <p>The classes are thriving despite  such options as self-guided programs on the computer and the prevalence of cable offerings like the Food Channel or home decorating channels. Adult education classes appeal to  people who don't want to download a language program from their computer but want to have spoken conversation with other people in a social setting or want to have a book discussion in a forum that is less remote than an Internet chat room.</p>
        <p>''There's obviously the personal interaction that happens when people are taking the same class, as well as the opportunity to discuss things with the instructor,'' said Paula Shamoian, director of the Larchmont Mamaroneck Center for Continuing Education.</p>
        <p>And as Helen Anbinder, the director of the Inter-Village Continuing Education Program, put it, ''They're not just coming for dancing and exercising.''</p>
        <p>She continued, ''One area that's really amazing is that the more challenging and esoteric the courses are, the more popular they are.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Anbinder's program is sponsored by of the Ardsley, Dobbs Ferry, Hastings and Irvington school  districts. ''We've offered Latin, Homeric Greek and Greek literature, and they've just flown,'' she said. ''We did a course on Herodotus, and people keep coming out. With our Shakespeare courses, we've had to run two sections.''</p>
        <p>Most school districts offer some form of continuing education, whether on their own or in cooperation with neighboring districts. So, too, do colleges and places like Y's, synagogues and churches. Depending on how often classes meet and the materials needed, fees range from under $20 to about $150, with many classes in the $40 to $60 range.</p>
        <p>Course offerings offer a snapshot of what's popular, from feng shui to  swing dancing.</p>
        <p>Carol Milove, continuing education director for the Katonah-Lewisboro school district, said: ''We follow the trends and keep up with the times. We have 18-year-olds taking ballroom dancing; we're offering a Broadway dance class, and we also have a class on eBay: how to buy, save and sell there.''</p>
        <p>Lisa Carter, director of community services at Westchester Community College, said two new courses are being offered this year: women's health and holistic therapies for pets.</p>
        <p>And, in an election year special, a White Plains city councilman, Robert E. Greer, is offering a four-session workshop, through Purchase College's continuing education program, on how to run for public office. Sessions will be held this Wednesday and each Wednesday through Nov. 1, except Oct. 18, from 6:30 to 8:30 p.m.</p>
        <p>As course offerings and the student body evolve, so do class schedules.</p>
        <p>For example, Larchmont-Mamaroneck has begun offering late afternoon classes from 4 to 6 to accommodate car-pooling parents or older people who prefer not to venture out  at night.</p>
        <p>Shorter classes -- four or five sessions, or even less -- are increasingly popular, unlike the past, when students had to be willing to sign up for a full semester. ''We're offering shorter classes, more one-session classes, and no 10-session courses the way we used to,'' said Martha Davis, director of the continuing education program for the Chappaqua school district.</p>
        <p>The Bronxville continuing education program has also added more one-shots, like a popular class on getting rid of clutter for hopeless pack rats. ''It's easy for people to commit to one evening,'' said Betty Hewitt, co-director for the Bronxville Adult School. ''We don't have to cancel too many classes.''</p>
        <p>As Ms. Shamoian said: ''People want to do more in less time. Over the years, the courses have gotten shorter and shorter.''</p>
        <p>There's Tai Chi, Russian and . . .</p>
