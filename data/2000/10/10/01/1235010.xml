        <p>ON the corner of Porach and Walnut Streets, in an area of well-kept but modest homes, a small group of volunteers for Habitat for Humanity is busy putting in the foundation for two houses, one of which will be the home of the Diaz family, who live nearby and have been closely following the progress of the construction.</p>
        <p>''It's a miracle,'' said Antera Diaz, who with her husband, Bienvenido, and their three children, will be moving a block from where they now rent a two-bedroom apartment, into the first home they've ever owned. ''Where we live now I pay $650 a month for two rooms to sleep in. We never thought we'd have a home of our own.''</p>

        <p>ON the corner of Porach and Walnut Streets, in an area of well-kept but modest homes, a small group of volunteers for Habitat for Humanity is busy putting in the foundation for two houses, one of which will be the home of the Diaz family, who live nearby and have been closely following the progress of the construction.</p>
        <p>''It's a miracle,'' said Antera Diaz, who with her husband, Bienvenido, and their three children, will be moving a block from where they now rent a two-bedroom apartment, into the first home they've ever owned. ''Where we live now I pay $650 a month for two rooms to sleep in. We never thought we'd have a home of our own.''</p>
        <p>The Diaz family live in what is called ''The Hollow,'' one of 39 neighborhoods in Yonkers. Bounded roughly by Ashburton, Yonkers and Nepperhan Avenues, it was once a vital and lively area of the city, according to Richard Halevy, a public affairs director for the city. ''There was a public school in the center of it,'' Mr. Halevy said, ''and there were churches, stores, delis and lots of vitality.''</p>
        <p>The public school is now vacant and on the market, Mr. Halevy said, ''and there are many vacant storefronts, but there's still a good working class population.''</p>
        <p>Two years ago, Bob Vila, the former host of the television program ''This Old House,'' helped build a Habitat for Humanity house in the neighborhood that was featured in a weeklong series on ''CBS This Morning.'' The site currently under construction is right next door.</p>
        <p>''It's this little community of Habitat houses,'' said James Killoran, executive director of Habitat for Humanity of Westchester. Mr. Killoran added that he hoped to build six more houses on a vacant city-owned parcel directly across the street. ''I'd also like to build a community center and even a deli there, sort of create a little village-like atmosphere that would help the neighborhood recapture what it once was.''</p>
        <p>If his dreams come true, Mr. Killoran said, it would constitute ''the biggest concentration of Habitat houses in the county.'' Mr. Halevy said that the city might consider making the parcel available to Habitat for Humanity, but added that ''those plans sound a little ambitious for the size property,'' which is about 175 by 400 feet.</p>
        <p>On occasion, the organization acquires land from private owners, mostly through donations, Mr. Killoran said, ''but mostly we buy it from municipalities.'' Often the land is in depressed parts of a town, he said, or in odd locations, such as a hillside or an industrial zone. ''Sometimes we buy it for $1,'' Mr. Killoran said. ''Then we have to spend our money rehabilitating it.''</p>
        <p>Habitat for Humanity of Westchester, a nonprofit organization founded in 1988 that is an affiliate of Habitat for Humanity International, has built six houses in the county, two in White Plains and one each in Yonkers, Ossining, Larchmont and Yorktown. It is now building or rehabilitating 12 more, Mr. Killoran said; eight are new houses, and four are rehabilitated ones. Of the new houses, in addition to the two in Yonkers, four are in White Plains and two are in Ossining. Of the rehabilitated homes, three are in Yonkers and one is in Greenburgh.</p>
        <p>The rehabilitation project in Greenburgh involves a former crack house. ''We take on rehabilitation projects when it's a property worth saving,'' Mr. Killoran said. ''But it's more expensive and harder to do. We prefer building new housing instead.''</p>
        <p>The group's goal is to build 10 houses over the next year in Westchester, Mr. Killoran said, and it is now considering acquiring properties in Mount Vernon and Port Chester.</p>
        <p>THE typical house built by Habitat for Humanity in Westchester has two stories and a basement, three bedrooms and one and a half baths and averages from 1,000 to 1,200 square feet. ''They sell for between $65,000 to $80,000,'' Mr. Killoran said. ''That represents our cost, which is lower than even subsidized housing because we use volunteer labor.'' The group also provides no-interest financing, and monthly mortgage payments go into a revolving fund that is used to build more houses. Income limits depend on family size; the maximum family income is $40,000.</p>
        <p>Because volunteer labor and donations of cash and building material keep costs down, deeds on Habitat for Humanity houses have restrictions, prohibiting owners from turning around and immediately selling the houses for a profit, Mr. Killoran said. ''We want to encourage people to move up,'' he said, ''but they can't sell before a certain number of years, and Habitat for Humanity gets first right of refusal. We want to keep these houses affordable and available to the families who need them.'' The typical period during which resale is prohibited, he said, is 10 years.</p>
        <p>Families who buy houses are also required to volunteer family members' services for a total of 500 hours, and not just on their own houses. ''Our whole family and our friends have worked on our house and other houses,'' Mrs. Diaz said.</p>
        <p>Last month, Habitat for Humanity International, which is headquartered in Americus, Ga., built its 100,000th house, on West 134th Street in Harlem. Founded 24 years ago by Michael Fuller, a businessman, the organization now has more than 2,000 affiliates in 68 countries.</p>
        <p>''It took 24 years to put up 100,000 houses,'' Mr. Killoran said, ''and now we want to build another 100,000 in five years. It can be done, because the learning curves aren't as steep. We're one of the top builders in the country now. We're getting good at this.''</p>
        <p>The group has received a great deal of publicity, in part because of the participation of former President Jimmy Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, who have been volunteering with the organization since 1984.</p>
        <p>Bjorn Kuhn, the architect of the the Porach Street houses, said that he became involved with Habitat for Humanity through a neighbor who invited him to a meeting. ''I was thinking about doing something as I got nearer to retirement,'' Mr. Kuhn said. ''It's right up my alley because I need to do something that's very physically active. Sitting around a table talking about doing something is not what I enjoy.''</p>
        <p>MR. KUHN, a partner with Marcantonio and Kuhn Architects of Irvington, N.Y., said that he helps out in a variety of ways. ''I help with the site approval process since I have a lot of experience with that,'' he said, ''and in overall management of the construction site and in using various software systems.''</p>
        <p>Peter Work, an assistant construction manager for Habitat for Humanity on the Yonkers site, was once a manager with the singing group New Kids on the Block. ''This is such a different life than I led before when I was always on the road, but I still do soundtracks for movies when I'm not doing construction,'' Mr. Work said. ''I've always had two loves, music and construction. I love what I do. Working for Habitat for Humanity, I may not make as much money as I could somewhere else, but I can say I'm making a difference, and that's satisfying to me.''</p>
