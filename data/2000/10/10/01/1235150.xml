        <p>Sara Naison-Phillips, the daughter of Elizabeth Phillips and Mark Naison of Brooklyn, is to be married today to Malik Naki Russell, the son of Dawn Russell of Brooklyn. Rabbi Miriam S. Ancis is to officiate at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden.</p>
        <p>The bride, 23, will be known as Ms. Naison-Russell. She is an analyst in investment banking at Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company in Manhattan. She graduated cum laude from Yale University. Her father is a professor of African-American studies and history at Fordham University in Manhattan and the Bronx, where he is also the director of the urban studies program. Her mother is the principal of Public School 321 in Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>The bridegroom, 27, is an associate in the corporate division of Simpson Thacher &amp; Bartlett, the New York law firm. He graduated from the University of South Carolina and received a law degree from Georgetown in May. His mother produces and directs corporate training videos at TIAA-CREF, the teachers' pension fund, and is an instructor in video production at the New School University, both in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>The couple met in 1998 at a party and fund-raiser for the Legal Aid Society in Manhattan. Ms. Naison-Phillips was a Legal Aid summer intern, and Mr. Russell was a summer associate at Cahill, Gordon &amp; Reindel, the law firm.</p>
        <p>''He was making fun of the way his friend was dancing with one of my friends,'' Ms. Naison-Phillips remembered. ''I thought it was funny also, and so I walked up to him.''</p>
        <p>They had more in common than a sense of humor. Both wanted to be lawyers, both had grown up in Brooklyn, and both were college athletes who had considered becoming professionals -- she in tennis, he in basketball.</p>
        <p>''Neither of us had much experience dating outside of our race,'' said Ms. Naison-Phillips, who is white and Jewish. She said that Mr. Russell, who is black and who was not brought up in any particular religion, is ''very proud of his heritage and involved with the African-American community.'' She added: ''And I feel very connected to Jewish culture. That wasn't complicated at all by my relationship with Malik.''</p>
        <p>They discussed race and religion early in their acquaintance. They quickly decided that neither would be a barrier for them.</p>
        <p>''It's one thing to date, but getting married is a whole other step,'' Mr. Russell said. ''It made no sense for me to spend my time with someone if there was no chance of going forward.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Naison-Phillips added: ''Lots of times marrying someone of a different race means your family will abandon you, but our families had no problem with it. And we realized that we have more in common with one another than with anybody either of us has ever met.''</p>
