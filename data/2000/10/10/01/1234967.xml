        <p>STUART KAPLAN used to buy and sell coal and copper mines for a living. That was before a 1968 visit to the Nuremberg Toy Fair in Germany, the largest toy fair in the world. Ostensibly he was shopping for presents for his five children, but Mr. Kaplan, an inveterate collector of stamps, coins, matchbook covers, old books and baseball cards, among other things, found the atmosphere irresistible.</p>
        <p>''I became entranced with a deck of tarot cards, brought it back and took it to the old Brentano's in New York,'' Mr. Kaplan said. ''Henry Levy, the buyer, ordered 100 decks from me and said, 'Write a book on it.' So I did within six months and sold 700,000 copies.''</p>

        <p>STUART KAPLAN used to buy and sell coal and copper mines for a living. That was before a 1968 visit to the Nuremberg Toy Fair in Germany, the largest toy fair in the world. Ostensibly he was shopping for presents for his five children, but Mr. Kaplan, an inveterate collector of stamps, coins, matchbook covers, old books and baseball cards, among other things, found the atmosphere irresistible.</p>
        <p>''I became entranced with a deck of tarot cards, brought it back and took it to the old Brentano's in New York,'' Mr. Kaplan said. ''Henry Levy, the buyer, ordered 100 decks from me and said, 'Write a book on it.' So I did within six months and sold 700,000 copies.''</p>
        <p>By 1978, he was publishing full time. That year, Mr. Kaplan sold 200,000 tarot decks. ''It was amazing,'' he said.</p>
        <p>His new-found passion for collecting playing cards and tarot cards evolved into a full-time business, United States Games Systems of Stamford. His hobby-verging-on-obsession will be on display at two exhibitions this fall, at the Bruce Museum in Greenwich and at the  Stamford Museum and Nature Center.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kaplan's first book, ''Tarot Cards for Fun and Fortune Telling,'' was followed by four more during the next 20 years: ''Tarot Classic,'' on fortunetelling and art history, and three volumes of an encyclopedia on the history of tarot from the 15th century to the present.</p>
        <p>Those volumes were illustrated with cards from museums throughout the world as well as from Mr. Kaplan's collection. He is working on the fourth and final volume of the encyclopedia.</p>
        <p>His company's two-story, 22,000-square-foot warehouse and office building in Stamford does double duty. Part of it houses the staff that assembles and packs his products for shipping.</p>
        <p>''A printer in Europe, who has been doing this for 150 years, manufactures the cards, which are based on historic designs, for us,'' he said. ''We provide the art work, warehouse, assemble and distribute the decks with boxes and instruction booklets.''</p>
        <p>Up a flight of steps is an atrium-like space that is home to Mr. Kaplan's collection of 20,000 items, including cards, card boxes, books, ephemera and paintings. ''I have the largest collection in the world of tarot cards and books on tarot cards and the history of playing cards,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Though Mr. Kaplan's life is in the cards, he is not a card player (although he admits to having played casino as a child). Nor does he have his fortune told, or tell fortunes at parties at his home, although guests often ask.</p>
        <p>''I avoid having my cards read,'' Mr. Kaplan said. ''If I were to live my life based upon what the cards portray, I'm afraid I might be swept up into it. And I prefer to be objective about what I collect and publish.''</p>
        <p>What he finds appealing is the history and the artwork of the cards, what they tell about social events of the times and what they show about the evolution of printing. He has also worked with museums to reproduce images from their archives, like the Mummy Deck from the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston and ''Women in Works of Art'' from the National Portrait Gallery in Washington.  ''The tarot cards and card games are a slice of life of the way people entertained themselves over the last several hundred years,'' said Mr. Kaplan, who built his collection with his wife, Marilyn.</p>
        <p>The museum exhibitions are results of interest expressed by three  organizations to which Mr. Kaplan belongs: the International Playing Card Society; the 52-Plus Joker Club; and the American Game Collectors and Puzzle Association. ''The organizations will all come at the same time, and I'll give tours,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''Symbolism and Prophesy: The World of Tarot,'' at the Bruce Museum in Greenwich through Nov. 26, will feature cards from the Renaissance to the present, bearing allegorical images representing death, the devil, God and the world that are also used for fortunetelling.</p>
        <p>Among the standouts are illuminated cards representing the earliest extant cards from the 15th century. There are also wood-block-printed, stenciled and hand-colored tarot decks made in France, Austria and Italy in the 18th and 19th centuries; and highly prized Minchiate packs, expanded decks with allegorical images and signs of the zodiac popular in Florence during the 18th century.</p>
        <p>When most people think of tarot cards, the first thing that comes to mind is fortunetelling. ''But tarot cards of the 15th century,'' Mr. Kaplan said, ''were originally used for a trump card game popularized by Italian nobility in northern Italy. By the late 18th century, the popularity of an expanded deck of tarot cards developed as well into a method of fortunetelling.''</p>
        <p>One intriguing section of paintings, drawings and memorabilia is devoted to Pamela Colman Smith, the artist who did the Rider-Waite tarot deck, the most popular tarot deck. Born in 1878 in Middlesex, England, of American parents, she joined the Order of the Golden Dawn, an esoteric group dealing with rituals and the mysteries of life, and started painting visions that she had while listening to music.</p>
        <p>The second Kaplan exhibition, running through Dec. 31 at the Stamford Museum and Nature Center, is ''Authors, Old Maid and One-Eyed Jacks,'' an exhibition of American playing cards, card games and memorabilia from the 1840's though World War II.</p>
        <p>The exhibition will feature cards from 80 decks on topics from presidents to authors to baseball, including original box covers and directions. There will be demonstrations of mechanical card-playing devices, like an electrically powered table that shuffles and deals cards to each of four players, and activity areas inviting children to create card games and build houses of cards.</p>
        <p>Among the games are children's favorites like Old Maid, Snap and Authors. There are also cards used by the Apaches, which are rawhide painted with vegetable dye.</p>
        <p>''This is the last time I'll do an exhibit publicly,'' Mr. Kaplan said. ''While it's nice to see originals in an exhibition, by reproducing material in the Encyclopedia of Tarot, people internationally can share my collection in the intimacy of their homes without coming to local exhibitions.''</p>
        <p>The Bruce Museum of Arts and Science (1 Museum Drive in Greenwich; 203-869-0376) is open Tuesday through Saturday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., and Sunday, 1 to 5 p.m.</p>
        <p>The Stamford Museum and Nature Center (39 Scofieldtown Road, Stamford; 203-322-1646) is open Monday through Saturday and holidays, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., and Sundays, 1 to 5 p.m.</p>
