        <p>THE best-known exchange in DINNER AT EIGHT (1933) is between Marie Dressler, as a grand stage actress of an advanced age, and Jean Harlow, as a plantinum blond bimbo in a backless dress. Harlow has read recently that ''machinery is going to take the place of every profession.'' Dressler quickly replies, ''Oh, my dear, that's something you need never worry about.'' The scene comes at the end of the film, but there's a lot of wonderful business leading up to it. Based on Edna Ferber and George S. Kaufman's play and directed by George Cukor, the movie merited major star power, including two Barrymores (John and Lionel), Wallace Beery as a nouveau riche opportunist and Billie Burke (with her Glinda the Good Witch trill put to good use) as the panicked Park Avenue hostess. For her, the evening is a disaster; for moviegoers, it's old Hollywood at its comic-drama best - Sunday at 6 p.m. on TCM.</p>

        <p>THE best-known exchange in DINNER AT EIGHT (1933) is between Marie Dressler, as a grand stage actress of an advanced age, and Jean Harlow, as a plantinum blond bimbo in a backless dress. Harlow has read recently that ''machinery is going to take the place of every profession.'' Dressler quickly replies, ''Oh, my dear, that's something you need never worry about.'' The scene comes at the end of the film, but there's a lot of wonderful business leading up to it. Based on Edna Ferber and George S. Kaufman's play and directed by George Cukor, the movie merited major star power, including two Barrymores (John and Lionel), Wallace Beery as a nouveau riche opportunist and Billie Burke (with her Glinda the Good Witch trill put to good use) as the panicked Park Avenue hostess. For her, the evening is a disaster; for moviegoers, it's old Hollywood at its comic-drama best - Sunday at 6 p.m. on TCM.</p>
        <p>Ludovic Fabre, the 7-year-old protagonist of Ma VIE EN ROSE (1997), lives in a sunny French suburb, believes he is really a girl and dresses the part whenever possible. This might not be so bad if Papa's boss didn't live next door. Or if little Ludo (Georges Du Fresne, who is outstanding) hadn't just declared his intention to marry the boss's son. Ludo's parents alternately humor and berate him; his young-at-heart grandmother comforts him. The situation eventually turns ugly (especially after the boy's unscheduled appearance in the school production of ''Sleeping Beauty''), but the film never does. It's a fantasy daydream, from the Belgian director Alain Berliner, with charm to spare - Sunday at 10 p.m. and Monday at 6 a.m. on IFC.</p>
        <p>Old men daydream, too, as illustrated in the classic WILD STRAWBERRIES (1957), Ingmar Bergman's idea of a road movie. Victor Sjostrom plays a 78-year-old Stockholm professor who's driving south with his lovely but troubled daughter-in-law and makes the mistake of stopping at the house where he spent his childhood summers. From there on, it's open season on fantasies and exquisitely nostalgic flashbacks, with the additional inspiration of some ebullient young hitchhikers and an unhappy husband and wife who come close to a head-on collision because they're so busy fighting - Sunday at 2 p.m., Sunday/Early Monday at 3:30 a.m. on Bravo.</p>
        <p>As a fallen Pentecostal preacher in THE APOSTLE (1997), Robert Duvall is so good it could make your head spin. His character tries to start a new life after he loses his church (that is, his congregation votes to dismiss him). Farrah Fawcett is quietly believable as his estranged wife, a faded beauty worn down by emotion. The film's rural Southerness - from the language and accents to the architecture and decor - is absolutely authentic, and that's a rarity in Hollywood films. Dr. Duvall also wrote the screenplay and directed himself - Friday at 8 and 11 p.m. on TNT.</p>
        <p>T.S. Eliot and Vivienne Haigh-Wood met in Oxford in 1915 and fell madly, buoyantly in love. But Brian Gilbert's TOM AND VIV (1994) is the story of their miserably unhappy marriage, which is headed for ruin after the couple's first visit to the wedding bed. The film is a little cold and not always completely engaging, but Willem Dafoe is fascinating as Eliot and Miranda Richardson earned an Oscar nomination as Haigh-Wood. She ends up in a mental institution; he ends up depressed enough to write ''The Waste Land'' - Friday at 9 p.m., Friday/Early Saturday at 2 a.m., Saturday at 5:45 p.m. on Romance Classics.</p>
