        <p>Vice President Al Gore has invited 13 everyday people to help him bone up for the first presidential debate on Tuesday. Well, not just any everyday people. It just so happens they hail from Michigan, Ohio, Illinois, Florida, Pennsylvania, New Mexico and a few other swing states.</p>
        <p>Other average citizens, like Winnifred Skinner of Des Moines (Iowa is another important battleground), have been invited to the debate itself. So Ms. Skinner is to arrive in Boston by Winnebago with her poodle, Bridget. ''I've never been that far east,'' she said.</p>

        <p>Vice President Al Gore has invited 13 everyday people to help him bone up for the first presidential debate on Tuesday. Well, not just any everyday people. It just so happens they hail from Michigan, Ohio, Illinois, Florida, Pennsylvania, New Mexico and a few other swing states.</p>
        <p>Other average citizens, like Winnifred Skinner of Des Moines (Iowa is another important battleground), have been invited to the debate itself. So Ms. Skinner is to arrive in Boston by Winnebago with her poodle, Bridget. ''I've never been that far east,'' she said.</p>
        <p>With the presidential race as tight as the 400-meter Olympic hurdles, neither side seems to be bypassing any chance to send a message to voters in the swing states. Or as William M. Daley, the Gore campaign chairman, put it: ''The presence of these special guests is an opportunity for us all to remember what's really important in this election.''</p>
        <p>Gov. George W. Bush, meanwhile, sought to leave another kind of impression with the voters: that Mr. Gore was not enough like President Clinton on the issue of reducing the size and influence of government.</p>
        <p>''The vice president was seated right behind Bill Clinton at the State of the Union when the president declared, 'The era of big government is over,' '' Mr. Bush told workers at a plant in Green Bay, Wis. ''Apparently, the message never took.''</p>
        <p>The vice president lobbed the issue of soft money right back at the Texas governor. Acting on a demand by two senators -- Russell D. Feingold, a Wisconsin Democrat, and John McCain, an Arizona Republican -- Mr. Gore challenged Mr. Bush to agree to a ban on the use of soft money, the donations made to the parties but used for the campaigns.</p>
        <p>On that topic, Mr. Bush found no need to debate: he said he did not believe the Democrats would abide by such a deal.</p>
