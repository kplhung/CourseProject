        <p>LARRY YELEN exists in two worlds. He is manager of rights and clearances, law and business affairs for VH-1, protecting musicians' copyrights. He is also a major collector of music audio and video recordings.</p>
        <p>Fascinated by audio tape, his preoccupation began as a teenager in the late 1960's. With a Norelco Carrycorder, one of the first cassette recorders, he taped live performances by artists like Jimi Hendrix and the Who at the Fillmore East and then began taping and collecting television, live-concert and home video performances. Soon he was trading with other collectors.</p>
        <p>''I was making friends worldwide,'' he said, ''with music fans and the music industry.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Yelen, who lives on the top floor of a post-war Cape Cod in Oceanside, has a collection of hundreds of video audio and audio tapes, including rare concerts, television and radio appearances, promotional clips and off-stage musical moments. His childhood fascination with tape recording and music collecting has evolved into a profession. His company, Rockives, is listed in various footage-library directories, and he is a research consultant.</p>
        <p>He supplies his expertise and clips for television documentaries and other music-related projects for network news programs, home videos and music specials like ''Part of Elvis '56,'' ''Bill Monroe: Father of American Bluegrass,'' ''British Invasion -- First Wave,'' ''Friday Night Videos'' and VH-1's Top 100 special and Rockumentary and Legends series.</p>
        <p>Since he was regarded as a historian and preservationist, many artists appreciated his efforts. He has rescued hard-to-find footage, sharing it with people like Eric Clapton, Sheryl Crow and Bob Dylan.</p>
        <p>What differentiates him from a bootlegger? ''I don't distribute publicly and don't steal from people's archives,'' he said. ''I don't distribute for resale.''</p>
        <p>He said he dealt only with material that was in the public domain or material for which he owned the rights. In other cases, although he may provide the actual tape, he directs the buyer to the potential copyright owners.</p>
        <p>The more footage he makes available, the less valuable his collection becomes. ''With VH-1 now strip-mining the history of rock 'n' roll -- for some really terrific projects, mind you -- we're using more clips,'' Mr. Yelen said. ''We've done such exhaustive programming that with this plethora of documentaries there becomes fewer gems.''</p>
        <p>A few defining moments led Mr. Yelen to become what he described as the Oscar Madison of music collecting. ''The first thing that floored me was seeing 'The Heroes of Rock 'n' Roll,' a great clip show with Buddy Holly and Muddy Waters. Then what sealed it was seeing the Who's 'The Kids Are Alright' in 1979. I couldn't live without owning it.''</p>
        <p>His first experience with recording was as a child, speaking into a Wollensak tape recorder in speech class at the West End Elementary School in Lynbrook.</p>
        <p>''I was amazed,'' he recalled. ''I just couldn't understand how someone's voice could transfer on tape. I became obsessed.''</p>
        <p>A graduate of Lynbrook High School, Mr. Yelen majored in business in college. But he soon became exclusively interested in ''all things audio-visual,'' he said. He enrolled in photography school and sold his photos to magazines like Crawdaddy. His photographs graced book and album covers, including Jeff Beck's ''Live With the Jan Hammer Group.'' He was a music journalist and became director of research for the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame Induction presentation.</p>
        <p>In the late 1980's, as MTV Networks's programming moved more toward music specials, Mr. Yelen began researching and associate producing such shows as the Eric Clapton and Paul McCartney ''rockumentaries.'' In the mid-1990's, he began writing music specials for the network. He eventually moved to the law and business department in 1995.</p>
        <p>Although he calls himself the ''Napster of video,'' in that he likes to acquire more than distribute, he sides with record labels, not fully trusting the motives of song-sharing sites like Napster. ''Fancy that,'' he said, ''coming from a guy who has thousands of hours of material I don't own.''</p>
        <p>When he was 12, his father bought him his first tape recorder, a two-pound, two-piece Quasar camcorder. Today, Mr. Yelen -- an archivist who possesses ''one of the ranking personal collections of music audio and video rarities focused on the 60's'' -- owns such rarities as an unreleased 1969 concert film of Jimi Hendrix in London; Lou Reed, at the height of his glitter period, interviewing Andy Warhol; and John Lennon singing intense multitake versions of ''Dear Yoko,'' filmed by Mr. Lennon in his Laurel Hollow home.</p>
        <p>Other favorites include a 1968 Yardbirds performance of ''I'm Confused,'' which later morphed into the Led Zeppelin classic ''Dazed and Confused,'' a 1971 Allman Brothers Central Park performance featuring Duane Allman, and a Brian Wilson clip featuring the piano-playing composer singing ''Surf's Up.''</p>
        <p>While Mr. Yelen does not like talking about his rarest clips (''I'd be swamped with collectors' demands''), with a little coaxing, he will produce a jaw-dropping 1964 Dutch television performance by the Beatles, featuring an unknown Jimmy Nichols -- not Ringo -- on drums. There are some ''sacrosanct'' items he will not make public.</p>
        <p>He stores his collection in his den, where tapes are strewn on the floor and rest on shelves and metal-and-wood cabinets. He has multiple video machines that encompass various world formats like PAL, Secam and NTSC and a professional 20-inch monitor, on which he sometimes screens videos for friends.</p>
        <p>The room is chaotic -- ''poorly cataloged,'' he admitted -- but he knows where everything is. This is an improvement he said, from when the room was ''like Miss Havisham's, with tons of stuff all over and posters on the wall.'' Now it is just filled with three-quarter-inch U-Matic videos and one-half inch VHS, pro-format Betacam and Betamax tapes.</p>
        <p>''There's an addictive quality to what I do,'' he said. ''It's like being a junkie. It starts as a hobby but it grows to 'more is better.' ''</p>
        <p>Although his collection is vast, he has a wish list: live footage of Jeff Beck with Rod Stewart, and newly discovered James Brown performances. Although he collects what he calls ''timeless'' music, Mr. Yelen's tastes include alternative fare like Liz Phair and Sleater-Kinney.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes I watch these tapes and I feel like I'm the only one on earth,'' he said, reflecting on his collection. ''If the power of all this music in this room would be released, I'd be blown away.''</p>
