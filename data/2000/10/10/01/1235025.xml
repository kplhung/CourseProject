        <p>'If she was wearing a revealing top,'' wrote The Los Angeles Times in a guide to the geographic origins of guests at a Conga Room party during the Democratic National Convention, ''a short, tight micro-mini and strappy stilettos, if she had that come-hither look, she was definitely Left Coast.''</p>
        <p>When did the West Coast of the United States become the Left Coast, and why?</p>
        <p>The East Coast is rarely called the Right Coast; its only synonym is the Eastern Seaboard, as in ''We ought to saw off the Eastern Seaboard and float it out to sea,'' 1960's hyperbole attributed to Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona, who considered the Rockefeller-Dewey Northeast to be a hotbed of liberalism. (Seaboard means ''land bordering a seacoast,'' though ''Western Seaboard'' is an unfamiliar term.)</p>
        <p>The earliest Left Coast citation I can find, with the help of Fred Shapiro of Yale, is in the title of a 1977 Rolling Stone record review: ''Wet Willie Left Coast Live.'' Three years later, a New York Times writer put it in context: ''If you're standing in Texas looking north, as Texans frequently do, the Left Coast is where Hollywood is.'' These usages had no political connotation.</p>
        <p>In the mid-90's, however, a liberal coloration emerged. The Denver Post noted that President Clinton ''swayed to the left coast and invited gays into the military.'' The combination of geographical and political direction was irresistible. ''The Pacific Northwest was a center of so much outcry against the Reagan administration in the 1980's,'' wrote Joel Connelly in The Seattle Post-Intelligencer, ''that conservative pundits referred to the region by a derisive nickname -- the 'left coast of America.'''</p>
        <p>As California has become more solidly Democratic, the name -- with its political connotation -- is most closely associated with that state. (Oregon and Washington are still up for linguistic grabs.)</p>
        <p>Other nicknames for Los Angeles and Hollywood, home of the glitterati (an amalgam of ''glitter'' and ''literati''), seem to be fading. ''Tinseltown, with its reference to the silver screen and the glamour surrounding it, is at least mildly positive,'' says Arnold Zwicky, visiting professor of linguistics at Stanford. ''La-La Land, with its suggestion of kookiness, is (mildly, jokingly) deprecatory, and I don't think I've heard Angelenos use it except in explicit self-mockery.''</p>
        <p>La-La Land is a play on the initials L.A., perhaps influenced by Lotos-land in ''The Lotos-Eaters,'' a poem by Tennyson: ''In the hollow Lotos-land to live and lie reclined/On the hills like Gods together.'' In his 1941 novel, ''The Last Tycoon,'' F. Scott Fitzgerald had a character describe Hollywood as ''a mining town in lotus land.''</p>
        <p>Jack Smith of The Los Angeles Times tracked La-La Land back to a 1985 recording, ''Land of La-La,'' by Stevie Wonder, the pop-soul music star, with backup singers chanting el-lay every few bars. The only uses found before that were a 1979 L.A. Times lead, ''Monday night in Lalaland is not like Monday night in, say, Washington,'' and a 1984 reference in The Washington Post by the fashion columnist Nina Hyde, reporting on a bar that ''encourages the cocktail waitresses to pour themselves into black super-clingy spandex pants, very LA-LA land, very Cher of a couple of years ago, very roller disco.'' A second sense exists, only tangentially related to the city: a state of unreality, induced by drink, drugs or congenital dreaminess.</p>
        <p>Whether used derisively by unappreciative visitors to the Golden State or used self-mockingly by residents, when the nicknames refer to a specific place, they are proper nouns to be properly capitalized: Tinseltown, La-La Land and now the Left Coast.</p>
        <p>Package Deal</p>
        <p>In the Left Coast convention speech introducing himself to the nation, Senator Joseph Lieberman said: ''My dad lived in an orphanage when he was a child. He went to work in a bakery truck and then owned a package store in Stamford, Conn.''</p>
        <p>The week before, however, in a speech to the A.F.L.-C.I.O. convention in Hartford, Lieberman used the phrase liquor store. Crawford Lincoln of Brimfield, Mass., asks, ''Was this a gentler locution to soften the image of his family's business for a national audience?''</p>
        <p>I'd say yes, and thereby hangs a euphemism. A package store is a store, not a bar, where liquor is sold by the bottle and not by the drink and where the contents of the ''package'' is consumed off premises.</p>
        <p>In 1880, Bradstreet's weekly reported active trade in package houses. In 1890, The London Daily News reported that ''Judge Foster recently decided that liquor could only be sold in 'original packages,' which is construed as meaning one or more bottles of beer or whisky. The merchants . . . are not allowed to sell beer or whisky by the glass.''</p>
        <p>Our earliest evidence for the phrase package store, I am informed by Joanne Despres at Merriam-Webster, ''is an entry in the 1918 Addenda to the New International Dictionary (originally published in 1909), where it is labeled 'cant, U.S.''' (Cant means ''jargon,'' and business euphemisms fall into that category.)</p>
        <p>Let's face it: what the seller is selling is not a package but what is contained in the package, which is liquor. Why the squeamishness about that word? After Prohibition was repealed in 1933, state legislatures had the opportunity to license booze shops and saloons but did not want to upset the many ''drys.'' That led to the linguistic prettification of saloons as taverns and of shops purveying the mother's milk of John Barleycorn as package stores.</p>
        <p>Maybe the senator uses the terms interchangeably. But I have a hunch that some politically sensitive soul remembered that ''drys'' still exist and vote and changed the candidate for vice president's word from liquor to package. It shows a sandpapered-fingertip sensitivity to the shades of meaning of words.</p>
