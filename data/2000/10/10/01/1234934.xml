        <p>The boarded-up movie theaters in Michael Putnam's SILENT SCREENS: The Decline and Transformation of the American Movie Theater (Johns Hopkins University, $39.95) wear their faded glamour like battered hats. Putnam's photographs, taken with an 8 by 10 view camera, are starkly formalistic: the boxy, Art Deco theaters are largely shot head-on and centrally placed in the frame, making the viewer conscious of minute variations in detail and texture. The stylized neon marquees that read ''Ritz,'' ''Lux'' or ''Judy'' contrast with the blank, peeling facades, as if we can see the dream palace that once was and the shell it has become. In the two decades since he started the project, Putnam found the old theaters were disappearing like buffalo from the plains. The film historian Robert Sklar points out in his introduction that although local cinemas figure prominently in our national mythos, they actually were a secondary source of revenue for Hollywood. In a 1948 antitrust case, the Supreme Court ruled that the studios held a monopoly because of their control over the vastly more influential metropolitan first-run theaters, which constituted less than 1 percent of the 10,000 screens in the country. Larry McMurtry, who wrote the novel ''The Last Picture Show,'' says that the old theaters are ''structural Quixotes, exhausted and brought to rest by brute reality, yet retaining in the gaunt and stubborn angles of their facades a suggestions of the visions, cheap but romantic, that once rolled like great clouds across their screens.''</p>
