        <p>Executive creativity is hardly limited to acquisition strategies, product development and accounting. At the Forbes Magazine Galleries,  23 executives are displaying their art until Oct. 14. Having sold about 100 watercolors through a gallery in Saratoga, Calif., in the last two years, Daniel M.

        <p>Executive creativity is hardly limited to acquisition strategies, product development and accounting. At the Forbes Magazine Galleries,  23 executives are displaying their art until Oct. 14. Having sold about 100 watercolors through a gallery in Saratoga, Calif., in the last two years, Daniel M. Tellep, retired chairman of Lockheed Martin, proudly declared at the opening last Wednesday, ''I'm earning minimum wage.''</p>
        <p>Also on display are six volumes of poetry by John Barr, a partner and founder of the SG Barr Devlin investment banking firm; photography by Norman Augustine, chairman of the  Lockheed Martin executive committee; a mosaic by William Ruder, a founder of the Ruder-Finn public relations agency and now president of his own firm; and a paper-clip sculpture by David Finn, Ruder-Finn's co-founder, who has published many a volume of his photography.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ruder, a trustee of the Business Committee for the Arts, suggested the exhibit to Judith A. Jedlicka, the committee's president, who then asked Christopher Forbes to be the host. ''I just said yes,'' Mr. Forbes said. ''I'm the yes man.''</p>
