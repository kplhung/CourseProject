        <p>As part of our training in acupuncture, we students practice on one another for two years prior to becoming student clinicians. I have been hurt many times by fellow students and have seen situations that breach the bounds of ''do no harm.'' Is it unethical to make us guinea pigs for inexperienced fellow students? Would I betray my profession if I sued my school for the harm done to me and to stop this dangerous practice? -- Anonymous</p>
        <p>All medical professionals must, at some point, work on actual human beings, and much thought has been given to how this can be done with a novice practitioner. There are a few essentials. First, the patient must know what's going on; that is, must know that the medic doing the work is a trainee. Second, the trainee must not try anything beyond his level of skill, admittedly an ambiguous rule. And third, there must be proper supervision by an experienced practitioner. If these three conditions are met, then I believe the training process is an ethical one, if not free of risk.</p>

        <p>As to your final point, it is not disloyal to your profession to hold it to the highest standards; rather, it is your obligation. But you should not sue your school -- at least not yet. Litigation should be a last resort, not a first step. Before going to law, you can talk to your teacher, to the school administrators, to your professional association and to government regulatory agencies about how the class can be made safer for all.</p>
        <p>One thing I wonder: If you were repeatedly harmed by novices, why did you keep allowing yourself to be treated by them? I'm relieved you weren't studying high explosives.</p>
        <p>I recently hired a consultant to help me with a problem in my home office. Not only did he fail to provide a solution, what he told me I already knew. Am I entitled to a discount? Should I pay at all?- Anonymous</p>
        <p>Your consultant may be inept, but you still have to pay him. You hired him to give you his advice, and it sounds as if he did. If his best effort turned out to be lackluster, you may want never to use him again, but it doesn't sound as if he was dishonest. So while you're free to ask for a discount, he's not obliged to provide one. Similarly, a doctor gets paid even when the patient dies. (Although the doctor shouldn't expect a letter of recommendation from the patient himself.)</p>
