        <p>More than a century ago, the stately little street known as Montgomery Place was a private walkway, gated at both ends and lined with decorative lampposts.</p>
        <p>Now, some of its residents want to turn back the clock and make the blocklong elm- and brownstone-lined street a private preserve again.</p>
        <p>''We are currently approaching public officials about the feasibility of this idea,'' said Dr. Jeffrey Goodman, president of the Montgomery Place block association. ''They think it's really cool.''</p>
        <p>Montgomery Place lies between Prospect Park West and Eighth Avenue and falls within the Park Slope Historic District. Its residents recently discovered that their street had been a private, gated thoroughfare from its beginnings in the 1870's until about World War II.</p>
        <p>The hope is that closing the street to traffic would make it safer for children who live there. Dr. Goodman said the move would also enhance property values and provide private parking spaces, at least for property owners, though he acknowledged that some residents considered that idea elitist.</p>
        <p>But there is a long road ahead.</p>
        <p>''It would be tough,'' said Tom Cocola, a spokesman for the city's Department of Transportation, which has jurisdiction over streets. According to Mr. Cocola, the residents would have to draft a proposal to buy back their street from the city.</p>
        <p>''Every property owner would be responsible for paying for the land'' in front of each building, Mr. Cocola said. Then the agency would set a price, ''which could be so high, I don't even want to speculate,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Next, a long series of government approvals would be required. ''Then the street would be demapped,'' Mr. Cocola said.</p>
        <p>The Landmarks Preservation Commission would have to approve the gates' design. Terri Rosen Deutch, a spokeswoman, said, ''We'll need to see designs for those street lights, too.''</p>
