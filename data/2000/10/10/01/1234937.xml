        <p>THE FEELING OF WHAT HAPPENS: Body and Emotion in the Making of Consciousness, by Antonio Damasio. (Harvest/Harcourt, $15.) A neurologist, drawing on the experiences of patients over many years, explains the difference between intelligence and consciousness and the central role of emotion and feelings in forming consciousness. His account, chosen by the editors of the Book Review as one of the best books of 1999, is ''a must-read book . . . on one of the greatest unsolved mysteries,'' William H. Calvin wrote in these pages.</p>
        <p>A GESTURE LIFE, by Chang-rae Lee. (Riverhead, $13.) Franklin Hata, this novel's elderly Korean-born narrator, looks back on his life from his comfortable perch in a leafy New York suburb, finding clues to his true identity in his service in the Japanese Army during World War II. The result is ''a beautiful, solitary, remarkably tender book that reveals the shadows that fall constantly from the past,'' Andrew O'Hagan said here last year.</p>

The result is ''a beautiful, solitary, remarkably tender book that reveals the shadows that fall constantly from the past,'' Andrew O'Hagan said here last year.</p>
        <p>THE TRUST: The Private and Powerful Family Behind The New York Times, by Susan E. Tifft and Alex S. Jones. (Back Bay/Little, Brown, $18.95.) The authors conducted some 550 interviews and extensive archival research to tell the monumental story of Adolph S. Ochs, who bought The Times in 1896, and those family members who stewarded the paper through the years. Last year our reviewer, Ron Chernow, called this a ''lively, lavishly detailed epic.''</p>
        <p>PLAINSONG, by Kent Haruf. (Vintage Contemporaries, $13.) In unadorned prose that echoes its characters' unadorned lives, this novel records a season of changes great and small in an isolated town on the high plains of Colorado. The result is an intimate tale that is ''so foursquare, so delicate and lovely, that it has the power to exalt the reader,'' Verlyn Klinkenborg wrote in the Book Review in 1999.</p>
        <p>DARK WIND: A Survivor's Tale of Love and Loss, by Gordon Chaplin. (Plume, $14.) The author tells of his long voyage aboard a 36-foot motor cruiser with the woman he loved, and of the bad luck and missteps that led to her death during a typhoon in the Marshall Islands. ''Chaplin writes vivid prose, with snappy dialogue,'' Anthony Bailey wrote here in 1999, and his ''account of their catastrophe is tense and moving.''</p>
        <p>NEIGHBORS, by Thomas Berger. (Zoland, $13.) In this satirical 1980 novel, a mild-mannered suburbanite finds his civility tested when he gets sucked into the vortex of his new neighbors, who have a penchant for strange games and inflicting pain and humiliation. '' 'Neighbors' is wonderfully funny and mysterious book,'' Thomas R. Edwards wrote here. ''Berger is one of our most intelligent, witty and independent-minded writers.''</p>
        <p>SLEEPING WITH EXTRA-TERRESTRIALS: The Rise of Irrationalism and Perils of Piety, by Wendy Kaminer. (Vintage, $13.) In a sweeping critique of the blind irrationality running through what she sees as today's evangelical culture, the author takes on everything from alien abduction to New Age spiritualism. Even if her analysis is hit or miss, Kaminer is ''a sharp, outspoken thinker,'' Caroline Knapp wrote here last year.</p>
        <p>SOLSTICE, by Joyce Carol Oates. (Ontario Review, $14.95.) This dark novel explores the obsessive (and destructive) romance between two determinedly heterosexual women: a timid young teacher trying to escape her disastrous marriage and an artist who has just lost her husband. ''The voyage is not for the faint of heart,'' Rebecca Pepper Sinkler wrote here in 1985. ''Oates, never squeamish about looking into the dark places of the soul, has aimed a powerful beam into that shadowy chamber.''</p>
        <p>PRIMO LEVI: Tragedy of an Optimist, by Myriam Anissimov. (Overlook, $18.95.) According to this well-researched biography, this Italian writer and Auschwitz survivor had a lifelong faith in the clarity of thinking and an enduring reverence for language. ''Anissimov's book . . . provides a serious, lively, at times fervently told story that is always sympathetic to Levi's shy personality and restrained tone,'' Victor Brombert said here last year.</p>
        <p>PERSIAN BRIDES, by Dorit Rabinyan. (George Braziller, $15.95.) Set in turn-of-the-century Persia, this novel tells of a 15-year-old girl, who yearns for the return of her unborn child's father, and her 11-year-old cousin, desperate to get married herself despite the grim lot of women in their society. ''Rabinyan grounds her themes of sexual politics in scenes mingling exotic beauty and gritty horror,'' Michael Lowenthal wrote here in 1998.</p>
