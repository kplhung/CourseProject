        <p>The Rosehill Community Association is trying to put its neighborhood on the map. Literally.</p>
        <p>''I would love it if I could get Rosehill's name on the little map in the back of the taxi,'' said Stuart Osnow, the president. ''That would be the ultimate.''</p>
        <p>The neighborhood, which includes Kips Bay, is generally regarded as the area bounded by Fifth Avenue, the East River and 23rd and 34th Streets, wedged between Gramercy to the south, Murray Hill to the north and Flatiron to the west. It is often referred to erroneously as Midtown East or Gramercy Park.</p>
        <p>According to locals' lore, the name Rosehill dates to 1746 when John Watts, a British farmer, bought 131 acres of land extending from Broadway to the East River between 21st and 30th Streets. Watts built a palatial summer house and named it Rosehill after the 16th-century home of a Scottish ancestor.</p>
        <p>But he was considered loyal to the British crown, and he returned to England in 1775 when colonists threatened his life. During the Revolution his mansion was burned to the ground.</p>
        <p>The community group has used the name Rosehill since its founding 15 years ago. Two weeks ago it asked C. Virginia Fields, the Manhattan borough president, to issue a proclamation stating that the neighborhood would be known as Rosehill again. A spokeswoman says she supports the idea.</p>
        <p>Even if the city does not officially recognize Rosehill, the association that bears its name will continue to acknowledge the neighborhood's boundaries. ''We'll still call it Rosehill,'' Mr. Osnow said. ''It's better to have some name than no name at all.''</p>
