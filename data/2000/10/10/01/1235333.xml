        <p>One electrical worker was critically injured and another was scarred after they were burned in an explosion and fire yesterday in a FedEx building at Newark Airport.</p>
        <p>The workers, Jake Paterek, 47, an electrical foreman with 15 years of experience, and Donna Fornoff, 42, an electrician's helper, were injured while a drill simulating an airplane crash was under way outside the building. The workers taking part in the drill immediately gave the burn victims emergency treatment.</p>
        <p>Officials with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which runs the airport, said the two victims were working in a small electrical closet inside the FedEx building, which is used to store cargo before and after flights, when the explosion occurred at 10:54 a.m.</p>
        <p>Mr. Paterek, who suffered second-degree burns over 55 percent of his body, was taken to the burn unit at St. Barnabus Medical Center in Livingston, N.J., where he was in critical condition. Ms. Fornoff, who suffered burns to her face, was treated at St. Barnabus and released in the afternoon.</p>
        <p>Both victims were working on an electrical control panel when a metal object, believed to be a tool, fell into the panel and made contact with live wires, touching off an explosion and fire that set both of the workers' clothes ablaze.</p>
        <p>Steve Coleman, a spokesman for the Port Authority, said the two workers ''tried to put the fires out on each other,'' but were unsuccessful  until they made their way out of the electrical closet.</p>
        <p>In the other room, Mr. Coleman said, the workers were able to roll on the floor to put out the fire, and Mr. Paterek staggered outside onto a runway area, where only yards away, the Port Authority police and emergency crews from Essex and Union Counties were staging a disaster drill that simulated a crash landing of a 727.</p>
        <p>Mr. Coleman said, ''It was extremely fortunate that we had emergency crews there'' for the drill, because ''when someone has severe burns, it is important to get them to the hospital as quickly as possible.''</p>
