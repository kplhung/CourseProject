        <p>A VISIT to the New Canaan Historical Society transports visitors to a particularly pretty part of a town.

        <p>''What distinguishes and sets the New Canaan Historical Society apart,'' said Janet Lindstrom, the society's executive director, ''is our collection of buildings and museums, which present a good idea of early Colonial life and then move forward into the Victorian period and beyond.

        <p>A VISIT to the New Canaan Historical Society transports visitors to a particularly pretty part of a town. Across from God's Acre, a lush greensward and former burial ground, and adjacent to St. Michael's Lutheran Church, the society owns five buildings with seven museums on two rolling acres, and each museum has its own historical focus.</p>
        <p>''What distinguishes and sets the New Canaan Historical Society apart,'' said Janet Lindstrom, the society's executive director, ''is our collection of buildings and museums, which present a good idea of early Colonial life and then move forward into the Victorian period and beyond. In many historical societies, only one period is represented.''</p>
        <p>The first stop for most visitors is New Canaan's first town hall, a townhouse built around 1825 that is now home to a 4,000-volume library, a costume museum and a parlor. Furnished with formal sofas, chairs and old-time china closets, the parlor is used for small exhibitions as well as the society's offices.</p>
        <p>''Recently we extended our archival wing to create a state-of-the-art vault,'' Ms. Lindstrom said. The expansion also produced a large meeting room dominated by a three-paneled, 30-foot Works Progress Administration mural called ''The Meetinghouse'' by George Avison. Set in 1825, it depicts the Rev. William Bonney approaching New Canaan's Old Meetinghouse on horseback -- and extends to a tranquil scene of parishioners on their way to church.</p>
        <p>New Canaan's oldest pharmacy, the Cody Drug Store, also lives on in a model of the 1845 establishment.</p>
        <p>Lock, stock and apothecary furnishings on shelves stretch the store's 20-foot length, dominated by hand-blown jars labeled in Latin, some still containing remnants of pharmaceuticals.</p>
        <p>A showcase displays perfumes and after-shave lotions. ''Instead of buying a whole bottle, you could buy a nickel's worth or a little splash,'' said Ms. Lindstrom, who also pointed out powders and an advertisement reading ''On many a face of charm and grace Miss Phoebe's powder finds a place.''</p>
        <p>In its heyday, the drug store was also a center of business and social life. It became the unofficial Democratic political headquarters in a strongly Republican town, a telegraph office, a post office, a gathering place after town meetings.</p>
        <p>From the townhouse, it is a short walk to the other museums, past small gardens, including a 25-square-foot patch sprouting seasonal vegetables and pumpkins planted by schoolchildren.</p>
        <p>The John Rogers Studio and Museum, a quaint Gothic-Victorian gable-roofed building built in 1878, now a historic landmark, houses some of his statuary groups. Rogers became known as an artist of the common people because of his ability to capture groups in Norman Rockwell-like scenes drawn from everyday life. And unlike bronze and marble sculpture, the province of the rich, his work was made of inexpensive plaster, painted a putty color to hide dust.</p>
        <p>''The Traveling Magician'' portrays a magician pulling a rabbit out of a hat for two children. ''The Neighboring Pews'' shows a moment of interaction among parishioners. ''Union Refugees'' recalls the pathos of the Civil War.</p>
        <p>Nearby is the Tool Museum, housed in a former garage (the only modern building). There are two rooms, one housing an exhibition on building a house starting with a tree, walls decorated with lovingly hand-carved tools. A second, larger area displays farm implements with one section devoted to New Canaan's days as a shoemaking center, and another a re-creation of a 19th-century printing office.</p>
        <p>The oldest house on the property is the Hanford-Silliman House, a center-chimney saltbox dating to 1764. A Craft Room was added to the structure in the early 19th century to give visitors a feeling of what life would have been like for the first owner, a weaver named Stephen Hanford who was also a tavern keeper. But the house decorated with mid-18th century furniture reflects the heritage of the two families for whom it is named. The kitchen features a walk-in fireplace replete with tools, and the Tavern Room was a meeting place open only to male guests. Beyond the parlor and bedrooms little discoveries await: a stairwell decorated with a collection of samplers, a hall display of dolls.</p>
        <p>Last is the Rock School, a one-room mustard-yellow schoolhouse built in 1799, furnished with reproduction desks and a cast-iron wood-burning stove.</p>
        <p>Unlucky pupils were forced to wear rustic wood plaques labeled Crybaby, Lazy Child and Tattletale around their necks, and a dunce cap and three-legged corner stool were provided for the disobedient. ''These were harsh punishments that today's kids get a kick out of,'' Ms. Lindstrom said.</p>
        <p>The New Canaan Historical Society (13 Oenoke Ridge, New Canaan; 203-966-1776) is open for tours Wednesday, Thursday and Sunday, 2 to 4 p.m. Town House and library hours are Tuesday to Saturday, 9:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. A $3 donation is suggested. For those interested in visiting additional historic houses -- from Putnam Cottage in Greenwich to the Captain David Judson House in Stratford -- a brochure, ''10 Doorways You Can Open,'' is available from the Coastal Fairfield County Convention and Visitor Bureau, (800) 866-7925.</p>
