        <p>WHEN Genentech Inc. was founded here nearly 25 years ago, it created a model for a new industry based on biotechnology, the premise that biological discoveries would lead directly to breakthrough drugs. Since then, more than 1,200 biotechnology companies have sprung up around the world.</p>
        <p>But Genentech is still a model. After years of turmoil and uncertainty, Genentech has nine drugs on the market, one awaiting regulatory approval and seven in late-stage clinical trials, all biological therapies.</p>
        <p>Only a couple of dozen rivals have any drugs on the market, and most of those companies have just one or two. And while major pharmaceutical companies claim an average of three new drugs a year, many of them are me-too's or minor refinements of existing therapies. Genentech's recent performance -- one new drug or a new use of an existing drug approved in each of the last five years -- is enviable.</p>
        <p>But the path to that state has been anything but direct. In 1990, Roche Holdings, based in Switzerland, took a majority stake in Genentech, setting off a debate over whether that link was a brilliant strategic stroke for Genentech or a sacrifice that would prevent it from becoming an American drug powerhouse, the Merck of its generation. Amgen Inc., which got its start four years after Genentech, is the largest biotech company in revenues and market capitalization, though it is thriving largely on the basis of just two blockbuster drugs.</p>
        <p>Genentech fell into Roche's arms after Genentech's blood-clot-dissolving drug, Activase, failed to meet sales forecasts, and Wall Street refused to provide additional financing.</p>
        <p>But since the mid-1990's, under a new chief executive with an obscure rallying cry to ''beat the put,'' Genentech has more than recovered.</p>
        <p>As events happened, 1995 was the crucial year -- though it hardly looked that way at the time. Activase had not become a blockbuster, nor had Pulmozyme, a breakthrough drug for cystic fibrosis approved in December 1993. And in May 1995, with Genentech's stock price in the low $40's, Roche declined to exercise an option, or put, to acquire for $60 a share the 33 percent of the company that it did not already own, further depressing Genentech's shares.</p>
        <p>That July, G. Kirk Raab was forced to resign as Genentech's chief executive after the disclosure that he had sought a personal loan guarantee of $2 million from Roche while in the midst of negotiations. That year, too, the company faced federal criminal charges, later settled, that it had marketed human growth hormone for unapproved uses.</p>
        <p>And when Roche named Arthur D. Levinson, the company's chief scientist, to succeed Mr. Raab, Genentech seemed destined to be just a research arm of the Swiss giant, rather than an operating company. Making matters worse, Roche had negotiated a second put option, which fixed the price that it would have to pay for the rest of Genentech's shares until June 1999. That effectively capped the potential return to investors at a bond-like level, giving them little stake in whatever growth the company managed.</p>
        <p>TO outsiders, Mr. Levinson was a nerd from central casting. Growing up in Seattle, he decided at the age of 7 to be a scientist. In his four graduate-school years at Princeton, he visited nearby New York City just once. And he had come to Genentech from a post-doctoral fellowship at the University of California at San Francisco, in the laboratory of Harold Varmus and Michael Bishop, who later shared the Nobel Prize for discovery of oncogenes, genes that give rise to cancer. At the time, Mr. Levinson had no experience in running a business.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Levinson rapidly disproved the doubters. Yes, he immediately increased spending on research and development, but he also cleverly exploited the relationship with Roche, forged strategic alliances with other companies and made good hires.</p>
        <p>In 1995, Mr. Levinson determined that he needed to increase earnings per share to a level where Genentech's price-to-earnings multiple would put the share price above Roche's option -- and keep the company semi-independent. To do that, he first spent heavily to build Genentech's drug pipeline and then cut back to help the bottom line.</p>
        <p>He energized Genentech's troops with his ''beat the put'' cry. To escape the new put, exercisable in June 1999, Genentech shares would have to rise above their $82.50 price. ''Probably 80 percent of our employees didn't believe we could beat the put,'' Mr. Levinson said in a recent interview.</p>
        <p>Beat it they did. But with Genentech shares reaching a high of $90 last spring, Roche bought out the company anyway. Then it did a surprising thing, issuing new shares equivalent to as much as 19 percent of Genentech to raise new capital. Later offerings further reduced Roche's stake, to 59 percent. Genentech closed on Friday at $185.69.</p>
        <p>Roche has two directors on Genentech's board, but Genentech controls its own day-to-day destiny. ''They've done something very creative,'' said William Haseltine, chief executive of Human Genome Sciences, the first company founded to exploit the sequencing of the human genome. ''The relationship with Roche is probably the best you can create between an innovative organization and a large global corporation. I think it will be seen as a case study.''</p>
        <p>Since 1995, Mr. Levinson has spent $2.07 billion on the research that led to Genentech's flurry of new drugs -- which, as a percentage of sales, is about 50 percent more than Amgen spent in the same period. Most analysts dropped coverage of the company after June 1995, because a biotech share that traded like a bond did not interest growth investors. Out of the Wall Street spotlight, Genentech could invest aggressively, with the greatest risk being that it would fail and Roche would buy it out anyway.</p>
        <p>''Part of the reason for not remaining independent was to maintain an incredibly broad-based support for all kinds of research,'' said Cynthia Robbins-Roth, an early Genentech employee who is now an industry consultant. ''No one ever knows how long it's going to take for a piece of science to make it out the door as a product.''</p>
        <p>Genentech quickly made two long-shot bets. One was on monoclonal antibodies, a kind of bioengineered protein that mimics natural defense mechanisms of the immune system; the other was on cancer as a target of the monoclonal antibodies. Genentech had never made a monoclonal; its early drugs were copies of naturally occurring proteins like insulin and growth hormone, and the consensus opinion at the time was that monoclonals did not work.</p>
        <p>The company had never made a cancer drug either, and because cancers evade the immune system, they were not considered good targets for antibodies.</p>
        <p>But Genentech's research machine had been looking at cancer and monoclonals for some time. To jump-start the program, Genentech licensed a drug in the late stages of clinical development from Idec Pharmaceuticals, a San Diego company run by William H. Rastetter, a former Genentech executive. The drug had already shown safety and efficacy in human trials, but Idec lacked the cash to to do a large conclusive study, let alone manufacture the product. Genentech could.</p>
        <p>''Two factors were most important to us'' about Genentech, Mr. Rastetter said. ''Their entrepreneurial culture and environment, driven by science, and their background expertise and experience in biological manufacturing. Not many people had the scale to make it work.''</p>
        <p>In December 1997, the drug, Rituxan, won federal approval for the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. In clinical trials, Rituxan had been as effective as standard chemotherapy, without the devastating side effects. Though not a cure, it has proved effective in extending the lives of lymphoma patients, and trials are continuing by Idec and Genentech to broaden its use to earlier-stage patients in hope of a cure.</p>
        <p>''Rituxan was the first monoclonal for cancer, and that changed everything,'' said Susan Desmond-Hellman, Genentech's executive vice president and chief medical officer. ''It used to be the most important things were palliative, like pain control or anti-nausea, and now we're talking about really treating the molecular cause of cancer.''</p>
        <p>ITUXAN caught the eye of scientists in the field. When Dennis Slamon, director of research at the Jonsson Cancer Center at U.C.L.A., found that one-third of women with metastatic breast cancer overproduced a protein called Her2neu, which prompts the aggressive growth of cancerous cells, he went looking for a partner that could produce an antibody to bind to and possibly block the effects of the protein. His search took him to Genentech.</p>
        <p>''Other companies were thinking about Her2 when they saw our data, but no one believed antibodies could work because they had been tried in the past and failed,'' Dr. Slamon said. ''It was a small core within Genentech who stuck to our project, and they had to fight for it. Once they did get involved, it went very quickly, in terms of Genentech being able to provide an antibody that could work in people and organize and execute a clinical trial.''</p>
        <p>Herceptin was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in October 1998, the first biological drug for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. Unlike chemotherapy, which indiscriminately kills fast-multiplying cells -- healthy ones as well as cancerous cells -- Herceptin focuses on a specific genetic alteration implicated in the cancer, and thus has relatively few side effects. In some patients, who have taken anthracyclines, a common chemotherapy, Herceptin resulted in increased congestive heart failure, and it is no longer used with those drugs.</p>
        <p>At the same time, Dr. Slamon and Genentech are proceeding with tests of Herceptin alone and Herceptin with other chemotherapy agents in women with the Her2neu protein whose cancers have not metastasized.</p>
        <p>Entering the final phase of clinical trials is another monoclonal antibody, anti-VEGF, that binds with and disables vascular endothelial growth factors -- proteins necessary to the building of blood vessels. ''This is an elegant way to treat cancer, because we're not targeting something on the cell surface, but something in the blood supply,'' Dr. Desmond-Hellman said. ''Tumors can't grow bigger without a blood supply.'' Anti-VEGF is being tested in breast, colon and lung cancers.</p>
        <p>Several other cancer drugs are in earlier stages of clinical testing. ''Four years ago, I addressed our national sales force and said that over the next seven years, we had a chance to get half our sales from oncology,'' Mr. Levinson said. ''We did it in four. If we're not the dominant company in cancer in five years, they should hire a new management team, including me.''</p>
        <p>MR. LEVINSON'S confidence that drugs will make it from the lab to the market sounds like bravado, but it is based on a cautious approach; unlike some other biotech companies, Genentech will advance no drug in clinical trials without first understanding how it works. ''When you have drugs with a clear mechanism of action, lo and behold, they're more likely to work,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Unlike some other companies, where marketers have major influence on drug development, Genentech places responsibility for advancing drugs in trials with people who have substantial medical experience. ''When you look at most biotechs and big pharmas, many people with ultimate responsibility for these decisions are pretty far removed from the bedside or the lab bench,'' Mr. Levinson said. ''Our people can rip through the data and see whether it's meaningful. There's an element of science and clinical rigor, and there's also an element of intuition.''</p>
        <p>Although Genentech has made a strategic decision to concentrate on drugs for cancer and heart disease, the two biggest killers in developed countries, it is still opportunistic. The company's latest drug, Xolair, for the treatment of asthma and allergic rhinitis, fits this category. Xolair is awaiting F.D.A. approval and could reach the market early next year.</p>
        <p>Jointly developed with Novartis, a Swiss rival to Roche, and a smaller company in Houston named Tanox Inc., Xolair is a monoclonal antibody designed to interfere early in the process that leads to symptoms of allergic asthma and seasonal allergic rhinitis. Xolair binds with and  blocks a protein called IgE, which prompts the release of histamines and other allergic responses.</p>
        <p>''The advantage is you are now not only treating the asthma, but all the allergens with a single shot,'' said William E. Berger, a clinical professor in the department of pediatrics, allergy and immunology at the University of California at Irvine, and a physician who has led clinical trials of Xolair. ''This drug is actually treating the basic mechanism. The only concern is that it's going to be relatively high cost, so we don't know how affordable it will be.''</p>
        <p>Genentech has not announced pricing for Xolair, for which Novartis will be the co-marketer.</p>
        <p>IN its earlier days, Genentech was sometimes accused of promoting its drugs to some patients who did not need them, most notably growth hormone to athletes, youth-seekers and some children whose physical stature fell well above the guidelines indicated for prescription. In April 1999, the company agreed to pay $50 million to settle federal criminal charges that it had marketed human growth hormone for unapproved uses from 1985 to 1994, pleading guilty to one criminal violation.</p>
        <p>Those dark days occurred before Mr. Levinson took command. But Genentech remains an aggressive marketer of its products, promoting its breakthrough therapies directly to patients and spending vast sums to educate physicians in their use -- as other drug companies do.</p>
        <p>Consider the faces that adorn Genentech's ads, annual report and the sides of its buildings. They are a bit like those of Apple Computer's Think Different campaign, though instead of John Lennon and Yoko Ono, they belong to breast cancer patients, stroke survivors and children with cystic fibrosis, who are breathing easier with Pulmozyme.</p>
        <p>''We're putting the face of the patient first in all of our advertising,''  said Myrtle Potter, executive vice president for commercial operations and chief operating officer. ''At the end of the day, as exquisite as the science is, it's all about taking care of our patients.'' Genentech's materials for patients also include a cancer survivor's kit that helps women understand the disease and become advocates for themselves.</p>
        <p>Ms. Potter, like Dr. Desmond-Hellman, was recruited from Bristol-Myers Squibb, the chemotherapy giant, and analysts say their hirings, as well as Genentech's increased willingness to find partners, are a new source of strength and a sign that the early arrogance of the company has diminished. Surrounded by far larger companies with deeper resources, and a flood of genomics and post-genomics companies, all of which are aggressive about recruiting from it, Genentech is trying to be nimble.</p>
        <p>The company has a new rallying cry these days, called ''five by five'' -- code for Mr. Levinson's goals: increasing earnings per share by 25 percent each year, increasing net income as a percentage of revenue to 25 percent from 18 percent now, receiving five product approvals by 2005, getting five products into late-stage clinical trials and finding $500 million in incremental revenue as a result of business deals.</p>
        <p>''We wanted to put something in front of ourselves as a goal,'' Mr. Levinson said. That strategy has, after all, worked before.</p>
