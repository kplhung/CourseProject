        <p>IF you're a pop musician, there are two ways of going through your parents' record collection. One way is to mimic whatever recent or distant past appeals to you, which is the way most North Americans do it. The second way, the route that more and more Latin Americans are taking -- with their built-in consciousness of mestizo culture -- is a sort of self-examination. It involves taking bits and pieces of the regional culture that your family has lived in and combining them with new music to make a portrait of who you are.</p>
        <p>The Mexican rock band Cafe Tacuba did it the second way. Its spritelike singer, Ruben Albarran, and its burly bassist, Quique Rangel, were studying graphic design in the late 80's when a teacher taught them to find aesthetic motivation in whatever national culture they had within them or saw around them.</p>

        <p>IF you're a pop musician, there are two ways of going through your parents' record collection. One way is to mimic whatever recent or distant past appeals to you, which is the way most North Americans do it. The second way, the route that more and more Latin Americans are taking -- with their built-in consciousness of mestizo culture -- is a sort of self-examination. It involves taking bits and pieces of the regional culture that your family has lived in and combining them with new music to make a portrait of who you are.</p>
        <p>The Mexican rock band Cafe Tacuba did it the second way. Its spritelike singer, Ruben Albarran, and its burly bassist, Quique Rangel, were studying graphic design in the late 80's when a teacher taught them to find aesthetic motivation in whatever national culture they had within them or saw around them.</p>
        <p>''We translated that to our music,'' Mr. Albarran told me a few weeks ago, as the band sat together in a hotel room before a show at S.O.B.'s in New York. He was wearing a South American knitted shoulder bag and a denim vest spangled with badges of old punk and ska groups: the Ramones, Madness, the Specials. ''We started looking through our parents' records,'' he said.</p>
        <p>There they found boleros, the songs of Agustin Lara, even the mass-pop romantic singers like Los Panchos. Pretty soon they were playing a kind of music that gained the moniker ''ranchera-punk.''</p>
        <p>They certainly weren't the first Latin American rock band to do so; Botellita de Jerez had started mixing rock with traditional music a few years earlier, and Cafe Tacuba's producer, Gustavo Santaolalla, played in an Argentine rock band during the 60's that used South American folkloric sources to break away from standard North American rock styles.</p>
        <p>This process of making music is best understood as a gift of the 1960's, when the quest to rediscover African and Indian cultural roots spread all over the Caribbean and South America. You can hear this tendency in other current Latin American bands, too -- among them Aterciopelados, from Colombia; El Gran Silencio, from Mexico; and Pedro Luis, Mundo Livre and Nacao Zumbi, from Brazil. Their records can be counted among the best recent documents about what new-world culture means.</p>
        <p>Cafe Tacuba's name comes from a famous old restaurant in Mexico City that fuses Mexican and European cuisine. That's the creole paradigm the group took on, having soaked up plenty of new wave and ska from England during the 80's and reconciling those influences with regional Mexican music.</p>
        <p>If the unity of Mexican and Anglo culture is Cafe Tacuba's basic organizing principle, there's a whole lot of unifying left to be done within its own audience. To Latin Americans, the band is a popular rock act with some cleverness -- an Offspring or a Beck. The overwhelmingly Hispanic audience at the New York stop of the Watcha Tour in early September sang along with every line of the group's songs. To the few Anglos in the United States who follow Cafe Tacuba, the band is an arty curiosity.</p>
        <p>Its recent double CD, ''Reves/Yosoy,'' is many-limbed and may be a masterpiece. Originally it was only ''Reves,'' a hard-to-market album of chilly instrumentals made of studio jams, made when the band was feeling fractious; the act of recording it, Mr. Albarran said, was ''medicine.'' When Cafe Tacuba gave it to WEA Latina and got the disappointed response it half expected, the band fished out some songs it had written during its last long tour to make an accompanying album of songs with words.</p>
        <p>Many of the Spanish lyrics are about isolation and disorientation: as most great bands do three or four albums into a career, Cafe Tacuba has made a record about entering one's 30's and wondering what the next step is. ''El Hombre Impasible'' seems a rewrite of ''Nowhere Man''; in ''Arboles Frutales,'' Mr. Albarran sings, ''I am surrounded by thousands of fruit trees/ mangos, tangerines, plums, pineapples and avodados/ I will starve to death because I don't want to move.'' And in the opening track, ''El Padre,'' the narrator imagines, Kafka-esquely, that he has turned into his father.</p>
        <p>It's tempting to describe their performances and their records simply by what they combine -- ranchera, foot-stomping son jarocho, surf guitar, rhythm-machine-driven postpunk, death metal, ballads as well-crafted as Paul McCartney's. But all this talk about combinations makes it seem a larkish form of eclecticism -- a Beck record, say. (It's a handy comparison, since Beck has used American folklore in his own work, and he toured with Cafe Tacuba early this year.) The difference is that Cafe Tacuba's shows seem like reports of a worked-out philosophy; Beck, in contrast, is a brilliant schemer who hasn't found his final thesis.</p>
        <p>For the first annual Latin Grammy Awards last month, ''Reves/Yosoy'' was nominated in the best rock album catergory and was expected to win. The day of the awards show -- which the band avoided -- band members mentioned to me their unhappiness that regional Mexican music, which makes up the bulk of the Latin record market, was being pushed to the side under the show's glitzy format. But the point they seemed more intent on getting across was that they didn't care much for categories in the first place. Of course, it sounds like something you've heard musicians say before. But listening to ''Reves/Yosoy,'' seeing its Anglo-Hispanic marketing scheme fail in the United States and noticing how Cafe Tacuba's fans love the band for being this way make you understand that its form of eclecticism isn't just the result of having too many options in life: for Cafe Tacuba, it is a system that works.</p>
        <p>Watching a band like Cafe Tacuba make whatever music it wants to make -- as it did in its three passes through New York during the past year -- is inspiring. And the band does this with enthusiasm; unlike so many English-language rock bands, Cafe Tacuba smiles. It doesn't look as if it's busy ruling things out. By the end of the evening, the last night I saw Cafe Tacuba in New York, the band had won a Latin Grammy but didn't bother to mention it from the stage.</p>
