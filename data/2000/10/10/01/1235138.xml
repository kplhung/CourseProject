        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I am a 1971 graduate of the Harvard Law School and attended the recent black alumni weekend (front page, Sept. 26). I was pleasantly surprised to see 10 of my 27 or so black classmates. For me, it was not only an event of celebration, but also one of reconciliation. While I hated the student experience at Harvard, I am nonetheless profoundly grateful to have graduated from there.</p>

        <p>When high achievement is divorced from happiness and a sense of belonging, it sullies the success. For many of us who matriculated there in the late 60's and early 70's, to return with unsullied success is the difference between then and now.</p>
