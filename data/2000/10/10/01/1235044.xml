        <p>MAYBE the orchestra members are wearing color-coded T-shirts so one can tell the strings from the woodwinds. Or maybe the program opens with an opportunity for the audience a chance to try out different instruments. The concert is short and sweet: nobody has to be persuaded to come back after intermission because there isn't one.</p>
        <p>These are not like the concerts Barbara Soroca, the executive director of the Stamford Symphony, heard when her grandmother took her to the New York Philharmonic when she was a little girl. ''It was not child-friendly,'' she said. ''These concerts are. We don't say, 'Sit and be quiet.' This is interactive, with a lot of excitement.''</p>

        <p>MAYBE the orchestra members are wearing color-coded T-shirts so one can tell the strings from the woodwinds. Or maybe the program opens with an opportunity for the audience a chance to try out different instruments. The concert is short and sweet: nobody has to be persuaded to come back after intermission because there isn't one.</p>
        <p>These are not like the concerts Barbara Soroca, the executive director of the Stamford Symphony, heard when her grandmother took her to the New York Philharmonic when she was a little girl. ''It was not child-friendly,'' she said. ''These concerts are. We don't say, 'Sit and be quiet.' This is interactive, with a lot of excitement.''</p>
        <p>Family concerts have become so important that many symphony organizations are hiring education directors to oversee them, along with school outreach programs.</p>
        <p>Laurie Allen, who has been director of education for the Hartford Symphony for 14 years, said that providing lively information was just as important as playing good music.</p>
        <p>''We've started doing program booklets that are directed to the family so the parent can read the material before the concert starts and there are activities they can do at home,'' she said. ''We really try to do more than little time-wasting things; we get them to think about the music.''</p>
        <p>Mae Miller of Weston was appointed education director of the American Classical Orchestra, based in Norwalk, just over a year ago.</p>
        <p>She and Thomas Crawford, the orchestra's founder and music director, presented the orchestra's first-ever family concert last season and will do three this year.</p>
        <p>''In many ways, having the responsibility of educating a young audience in the age range of 5 to 12,'' Ms. Miller said, ''is even more challenging than preparing for a regular season subscription concert.''</p>
        <p>''Here's a chance to attract more concert-goers through the children and at the same time, educate them,'' she said. ''The parents are learning with and through their children. We do not 'dumb down' the music.''</p>
        <p>There is one very important strategy in programming, she noted: ''The music we play, well, we do not play any adagio. Strictly allegro!''</p>
        <p>Here are some of the concerts planned specially for children and families:</p>
        <p>American Classical Orchestra</p>
        <p>This orchestra, conducted by Thomas Crawford, specializes in music from the Baroque, Classical and Romantic eras. The instruments are historic or accurate reproductions. ''Beethoven Lives Upstairs'' will be presented on Oct. 21 at 3 p.m. in Norwalk Concert Hall.</p>
        <p>From 2 to 2:45 in the concert hall's Community Room, gold and silver ticket holders will be admitted to the Instrument Petting Zoo, where children can try out instruments donated by the Westport Music Center, and meet musicians. Members of the Norwalk Youth Symphony will also demonstrate how to play the instruments and give an informal performance.</p>
        <p>''A Holiday Symphony,'' a combination of music and storytelling presented by the orchestra and its children's chorus, is scheduled for Dec. 9 at 3 p.m. at Norwalk Concert Hall.</p>
        <p>After the concert, gold and silver ticket holders are invited to a party in the community room.</p>
        <p>''Winter Winds'' will be performed twice, at 1 and 3 p.m., on Feb. 3 at the Westport Unitarian Church. Music by Mozart and Beethoven will be featured.</p>
        <p>Subscriptions to all three concerts for adults and children are $34, $28 and $19. Single tickets are $12, $10 and $7. To order tickets call (203) 838-6995 or fax (203) 838-6998 or write to American Classical Orchestra, 50 Washington Street, Norwalk 06854.</p>
        <p>Hartford Symphony</p>
        <p>All concerts take place at 11 a.m. at The Bushnell. Free preconcert activities begin at 10 a.m. in The Bushnell's lobbies.</p>
        <p>''Fanfare for the Common Kid,'' on Nov. 4, will feature Randall Craig Fleischer as guest conductor and Heidi Joyce as narrator.</p>
        <p>The symphony celebrates the 100th anniversary of Aaron Copland's birth with such well-known Copland works as ''Appalachian Spring,'' ''Buckaroo Holiday,'' ''Hoedown,'' ''Fanfare for the Common Man'' and ''Billy the Kid.''</p>
        <p>''A Morning at the Movies,'' on Feb. 4, will explore the importance of music in some of film's most captivating scenes as they are brought to the symphonic stage on a big screen with live accompaniment.</p>
        <p>On March 24 Peter Sacco is guest conductor for ''March Madness.'' The program will feature Liszt's ''Rakoczi March,'' Mozart's ''Turkish March,'' Copland's Dream March from ''The Red Pony,'' Sousa's ''Hail to the Spirit of Liberty March,'' the March from Tchaikovsky's ''Symphony No. 6,'' and other favorites.</p>
        <p>Stamford Symphony</p>
        <p>On Dec. 9 at 2 p.m., the composer and conductor Robert Kapilow leads ''The Polar Express and Elijah's Angel,'' a program with a children's chorus and actors at the Rich Forum. On Feb. 10, ''The Thrill of the Orchestra and Musical Detectives'' will be presented at 2 p.m. at the Rich Forum with Janna Hymes-Bianchi as guest conductor. Ms. Hymes-Bianchi will be back March 10 for ''Peter and the Wolf and More!'' at 2 p.m. at the Palace Theater.</p>
        <p>Subscriptions are $48 and $60, single tickets $20 and $25.</p>
        <p>Minding Manners In Concert Halls</p>
        <p>A FEW basic strategies should be kept in mind by an adult taking a child to a concert.</p>
        <p>When it comes to applause at family concerts geared toward youngsters, all bets are off: there is no wrong time to clap. Children clap when they are inspired; the music has touched them. It's a visceral, primal reaction.</p>
        <p>And how gratifying for a musician to get spontaneous feedback from an audience that claps because it was moved to do so!</p>
        <p>Feed the children before you go; hunger usually leads to a meltdown. Food is not allowed in the concert hall. A concert, no matter how informal, is not an outing at the movies or an afternoon with the television. Candy? No crinkly paper but a mint discreetly handed off is fine.</p>
        <p>Visit the bathroom right before the concert. Make another visit, if you can get there before the line snakes around the block, at intermission if there is one.</p>
        <p>Encourage the children to take a little extra care in their appearance; they don't need to be fancy, just presentable. Make it special, not stressful.</p>
        <p>Try to settle into your seats at least 10 minutes before the curtain. If they get antsy play a game like ''I See Something . . . Red,'' or perhaps a game of tick-tack-toe or whatever has worked in the past. Some orchestras even provide programs with puzzles and games relating to the music. Have a pencil handy.</p>
        <p>Do not bring electronics into the hall: no personal CD players, Gameboys or Palm Pilots. Cameras and video and recording equipment are not allowed, either.</p>
        <p>Be a good role model and turn off your cell phone or pager.</p>
        <p>Encourage the children to whisper if they must speak to you during the performance. It's O.K. to whisper occasionally to your child about something going on in the music; otherwise, no talking unless the musicians or conductor are interacting with you.</p>
        <p>Make sure when you open your program, you open your mind. If you are less than enthusiastic about classical music, your children will be, too.</p>
        <p>And if the little person seated next to you has drifted off, don't disturb his music-induced reverie; that's the Mozart effect.</p>
