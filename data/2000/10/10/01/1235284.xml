        <p>LANCE ARMSTRONG did not have to be here. These Olympic races had nothing to do with the Tour de France, the European circuit, where he makes his very considerable living.</p>
        <p>He was here because he remembered what the Olympics meant to him as a child, when he dreamed of being a champion swimmer. Ultimately, the sport changed, but there was always the podium and the medals, the top step and the glittering gold.</p>
        <p>Armstrong did not achieve his dream, and ''It's just a feeling,'' he said, but he won't be back in Athens in 2004 when he is 33. He'll never win that gold medal, and that should be all right, given all that he has done, but Armstrong seemed preoccupied and sad in his role as a bronze medalist in a cycling time trial yesterday.</p>
        <p>He is a swashbuckler from the big leagues. He did not have to be here, just as Venus Williams did not need to be here. There are not enough points in the women's tennis computer rankings to put her muscular frame on a jet plane right after the United States Open, but Williams cried when she won her singles gold medal.</p>
        <p>Yes, sponsors love gold medals, but athletes have been known to say no to tasks they do not want to do, even for money. Ivan Zamorano, 33, lobbied for one of the three over-23 slots on the Chilean Olympic soccer team. He now has a bronze medal to bring back and show his teammates with Inter Milan.</p>
        <p>It has been easy to lampoon the professionalization of the Olympic movement, bringing in Chris Evert and Wayne Gretzky and even Michael Jordan, obediently representing his sponsor's logo.</p>
        <p>Juan Antonio Samaranch, the president of the International Olympic Committee, can be persuasive about why the greatest athletes should be at the Games -- because those athletes were at the ancient Games in Greece, since there was no concept of playing for hire in those days. The open-door policy came in for a drubbing when American hockey players trashed their dormitory rooms in Nagano, Japan. On the other hand, louts from very minor sports have done crude things at the Athletes Village this time around.</p>
        <p>More important, Armstrong cared enough to bring his wiry body, the one that has recuperated from testicular cancer, which had spread to his brain and lungs, to twice win the Tour de France, at a time of year when a cyclist should be winding down. He also cracked a vertebra in his neck the end of August when he was hit by a car while cycling in Nice, France.</p>
        <p>''If it wasn't the Olympics, I wouldn't do it,'' Armstrong said, after finishing behind his buddy Vyacheslav Yekimov, a Russian who normally blocks out the breeze for Armstrong on the U.S. Postal Service Team. (Jan Ullrich of Germany finished second.)</p>
        <p>Armstrong cared, the same way the baseball player Dave Nilsson cared. Nilsson was an All-Star with Milwaukee who chose to play in Japan this season so he could have the leeway to play for his homeland in the Summer Games.</p>
        <p>The Aussies are great that way. Pat Rafter and Cathy Freeman and Ian Thorpe were all said to have spent some nights in the Athletes Village. It's their country, and it was founded on a jovial sense of egalitarianism, all in it together, mate.</p>
        <p>Not everybody feels that way. There are basketball players who were resting their knees or getting married or making rap records, whatever basketball millionaires do in their off-season that is all too short (for them, as well as for us).</p>
        <p>Still, a dozen of them signed on, and only each one knows how much effort he was putting into it. They could have listened to Tom Lasorda's claim that winning an Olympic gold medal would be better than winning the World Series. Typical Lasorda blather? Sure. But he said it long before his culls and rejects won the gold medal, so at least he was consistent.</p>
        <p>Armstrong faltered in the 1992 Games and he slumped again in 1996 and later he found out he had cancer racing through his system. This time he came back to try for the gold.</p>
        <p>''This is the closest I've been to the Olympic spirit,'' Armstrong said, with the bronze around his neck. ''In Barcelona, we were way outside the city. In Atlanta, I just came in the day before. But this has been great.''</p>
        <p>He didn't stay in the village. He said it was because the logistics didn't work out. But he was an Olympian when he put on the helmet, and he was an Olympian when the digital clock said he had not won. And during the news conference, Armstrong bit his lip as Yekimov spoke in English.</p>
        <p>''For me, is hero,'' Yekimov said of Armstrong. ''This guy, he gives a positive mood to all of us. He's done a great job winning two Tours de France. He'll win another one. But today I'm gold and he's bronze. He understands the situation. Next year, we're together.''</p>
        <p>They room together on those weeks of torture, when it takes a masseuse nearly an hour in the evening just to pound the muscles back into place. They ride together, with Yekimov doing the dirty work up front and Armstrong getting the glory of the yellow leader's jersey. When Yekimov went to another team in 1999, Armstrong lobbied to get him back in 2000, and succeeded.</p>
        <p>This is heavy-duty sporting pressure, the 800-pound gorilla voicing his opinion, millions of prize francs and sponsor dollars riding on Armstrong's demands. Yet at the end of their season, Armstrong and Ullrich and Yekimov churned their thighs one more afternoon for a medal. There is room in the Games for professionals like them.</p>
