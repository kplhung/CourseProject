        <p>Last year, people living near Grand Army Plaza learned that a 15-story condominium was planned for Union Street, just steps from the Park Slope Historic District. They quickly rallied against the project, saying it would be a blight in their neighborhood.</p>
        <p>For a time, they were successful. But now it appears they have lost their final battle.</p>
        <p>The controversy arose in August 1999, when neighbors noticed that a fence had been erected at 939 Union Street and promptly formed the Grand Army Plaza Coalition to fight the project and others like it.</p>
        <p>When excavation on the site began two weeks, coalition members realized that no work permit had been posted. They informed the city's Department of Buildings, which issued a stop-work order.</p>
        <p>But the order had been issued in error. The proper permits had, in fact, been filed, according to Paul Wien, a department spokesman.</p>
        <p>Then, just as the stop-work order was to be rescinded, department officials realized the developer had not sent the required five-day notification to neighboring property owners.</p>
        <p>''Right now, the stop-order stands,'' Mr. Wien said Wednesday. ''But it will be lifted when they send out the five-day notification.''</p>
        <p>The coalition is all but conceding defeat.</p>
        <p>''Slowly, regrettably, we are realizing that our other options are zero,'' said Marc Zarowin, a coalition spokesman. ''They don't care that 95 percent of the neighborhood is row houses, and this will stand out. They just care about making their money.''</p>
        <p>Alex Goldin of the Union Development Group, which is building the project, said the design of the condo would be compatible with the neighborhood's graceful brownstones.</p>
        <p>''It will have no impact whatsoever on traffic or parking because it's only 22 families,'' Mr. Goldin said. ''And it will fit right into the landmark environment. It's a good project for the neighborhood, overall, though you'll always have people upset about development.''</p>

        <p>NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: PARK SLOPE -- UPDATE  Correction:  October 8, 2000, Sunday  An article in the Neighborhood Report pages last Sunday about opposition to a proposed condominium on Union Street in Park Slope, Brooklyn, misspelled the surname of a spokesman for the city's Department of Buildings. He is Paul Wein, not Wien.</p>
