        <p>WHAT SHE SAW . . .</p>
        <p>By Lucinda Rosenfeld.</p>
        <p>284 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Random House. $23.95.</p>
        <p>ONE of the great advantages of self-loathing is that you can do it anywhere -- and you don't even have to be good at it. When were you ever good at anything? Lucinda Rosenfeld's comic first novel, ''What She Saw . . . ,'' concerns Phoebe Fine, a self-hating young girl from New Jersey who blooms, before our very eyes, into a self-hating young woman from New Jersey. ''She chewed her fingernails into bloody pulp,'' Rosenfeld writes on the occasion of her heroine's senior year at Hoover University. ''She showered infrequently, she cried incessantly, she smoked relentlessly. She wore the same outfit every day, her 'fat outfit': black palazzo pants and a men's extra-large brown cardigan. She couldn't keep down her breakfast (12 tablespoons of brown sugar), never mind her lunch (a blueberry muffin).'' This particular bender was triggered by Phoebe's waning romance with an insufferable -- and married -- professor named Bruce Bledstone. Bruce is the fifth deluded moron Phoebe has dated in a row. She may be the queen of self-loathing but, as they say in acceptance speeches, she couldn't have done it alone.</p>
        <p>Over the course of ''What She Saw . . . ,'' Phoebe dates roughly 10 deluded morons in all. (I'm hedging in fairness to the fraternity brother Spitty Clark: he's a moron, but he's not deluded about it.) Each boyfriend has a chapter named after him, and the long, loping title of Rosenfeld's novel actually runs, ''What She Saw in Roger Mancuso, Gnter Hopstock, Jason Barry Gold, Spitty Clark . . .'' etc. It's a catchy gimmick. Judging from the acknowledgments, Rosenfeld is friendly with Malcolm Gladwell, author of ''The Tipping Point,'' who would probably say that the high-concept structure is what makes this book ''sticky.'' Ultimately, it's the novel's best friend and worst enemy. Rosenfeld is a genuinely funny, skewering satirist. She lays out a colorful butterfly collection of bad boyfriends here, their hearts still beating, their wings firmly pinned. But ''What She Saw . . .'' can be glib and disjointed, settling for laughs in lieu of insights. You can tell, from the occasional flashes of darkness, that Rosenfeld knows precisely where Phoebe's pain is buried. Unfortunately, she's in no mood for digging.</p>
        <p>The novel opens adorably, with a morose 10-year-old Phoebe toting a violin case around Whitehead, N.J. Phoebe's folks are uncool classical music geeks -- to pass the time in the car, they try to name a composer for every letter of the alphabet, beginning with Albinoni. On top of that, she's suffering from a debilitating case of second-child syndrome. ''Having been born three years before her, Emily had been awarded the 'real' bedroom,'' Rosenfeld writes. ''Not that Phoebe had asked to be born second. Not that she'd asked to be born!'' Phoebe's life is a drab, sorry thing until it starts raining men. Or at least grade-school boys. Bachelors Nos. 1-4 are perfectly, almost tenderly drawn. There's the enigmatic fifth-grade rebel Roger (Stinky) Mancuso -- His favorite expression was 'Ya mental'; his second-favorite expression was 'Ya gay' '' -- and, years later, the Kappa Omega brother Spitty Clark, an alleged date-rapist who studies advanced beverage management.</p>
        <p>YOU will be surprised to hear that Phoebe's relationships with Stinky and Spitty end badly. Early in ''What She Saw . . . ,'' Rosenfeld's tremendous flair for dialogue and her acute eye for the flora and fauna of 80's pop culture whisk you along -- and there's enough disturbing subtext to suggest the novel will eventually start thinking deeper thoughts. ('' 'Do you want to go to the party now?' she asked Spitty, suddenly sick with herself for having brought the whole rape business up -- and only minutes before her fall formal was due to begin!'') But Phoebe's unhappy romances become tedious, and the jerks that she dates start shedding dimensions: three, two, one.</p>
        <p>''What She Saw . . .'' is essentially a short-story collection posing as a novel. Because of the time lapses between the chapters, it's tough to get a 20/20 vision of who Phoebe is. The most bewildering moment arrives in a chapter called ''Arnold Allen,'' when Phoebe meets a man on the street who claims to be a famous movie producer. He persuades her to take him back to her apartment for an audition, whereupon he tells her to put on a silk top, rubs lotion on her legs -- O.K., so far he really does sound like a movie producer -- and then asks for $500 in cash for her application to the Screen Actors Guild. Now wait a minute. Phoebe's desperate for attention, she wants to believe in her inner movie star -- yeah, I get that. But for 200 pages she's been cynical and suspicious of men's flattery. Suddenly she's a rube rushing to the cash machine?</p>
        <p>By the end of ''What She Saw . . . ,'' you've lost interest in the riddle of who Phoebe is. She seems remote, negative -- a whiny friend who won't get off the phone. Even Rosenfeld seems to think she's no fun, blithely riffing on her bulimia (''It was all pretty terrible. It was all pretty tragic'') and her tangled, unexamined views on sex (''She'd never been so aroused. . . . Which is mostly to say that she could tell that Bruce Bledstone was aroused. And was there really any difference?''). Despite the continuing lava flow of memoirs, it's still considered condescending to suggest that a novelist is secretly writing about him- or herself. Frankly, if I didn't think ''What She Saw . . .'' was at least partly autobiographical, I'd think it was a little cruel. Rosenfeld is a promising writer, and I'm certain she has some fine books in her now that she's exorcised all these ghosts. Stinky, Spitty, Bruce -- they didn't deserve a novel. They're lucky they got a second date.</p>
