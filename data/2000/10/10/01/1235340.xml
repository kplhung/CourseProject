        <p>Five years ago, Linda Pagan opened the Hat Shop at 120 Thompson Street (between Spring and Prince Streets). After leaving a job on Wall Street, she began vacationing in countries like Kenya and India and brought back handmade merchandise that did not exactly fit the mandates of her first shop; they were not hats, nor were they made by New York artisans.</p>
        <p>She collected the dyed baskets, olive wood and camel bone kitchen utensils, colorful multipurpose wraps and beaded sandals she said were ''made by two guys who sit under a mango tree'' and had private sales for familiar customers.</p>
        <p>When Ms. Pagan found out that Alexei Baklanov was closing Red and Gold, his accessories shop two doors down at 110 Thompson Street, she decided to take over the additional space, paint it a deep fiery orange and call it the Nomad Shop. It opens today.</p>

        <p>Five years ago, Linda Pagan opened the Hat Shop at 120 Thompson Street (between Spring and Prince Streets). After leaving a job on Wall Street, she began vacationing in countries like Kenya and India and brought back handmade merchandise that did not exactly fit the mandates of her first shop; they were not hats, nor were they made by New York artisans.</p>
        <p>She collected the dyed baskets, olive wood and camel bone kitchen utensils, colorful multipurpose wraps and beaded sandals she said were ''made by two guys who sit under a mango tree'' and had private sales for familiar customers.</p>
        <p>When Ms. Pagan found out that Alexei Baklanov was closing Red and Gold, his accessories shop two doors down at 110 Thompson Street, she decided to take over the additional space, paint it a deep fiery orange and call it the Nomad Shop. It opens today.</p>
        <p>Mr. Baklanov, in the meantime, started buying more items to create a fuller selection of high-end scarves, candles, silver jewelry and leather wallets and briefcases from countries like Italy, Peru and Spain. He also moved, to a new space about twice the size at 1146 Lexington Avenue (near 79th Street). The new store, which opened Sept. 23, is called Iliria, a name he created that alludes to a flower (ilyria), a Peruvian silver company (Ilaria) and the setting of Shakespeare's ''Twelfth Night'' (Illyria).</p>
        <p>Mr. Baklanov, who immigrated from St. Petersburg 10 years ago and was trained there as an art historian, selects his items carefully. ''There's no difference in a precious object, either displayed at a museum or a store,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Although, he added ''at the store, you have a chance to own it.''</p>
