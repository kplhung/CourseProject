        <p>Charles H. Greenthal &amp; Company, which opened a residential sales office on 125th Street in Harlem in August 1999, has doubled the size of the office by adding a commercial division. Both divisions are in the Bishop Building, at 125th and Eighth Avenue.</p>
        <p>Peter A. Moody, who was born in Harlem, heads the commercial unit, which has three brokers. He said that much of the opportunity in the area is retail property but that there is office space as well.</p>
        <p>''In addition to the prime commercial strip along 125th Street, there is commercial activity along Lenox Avenue, which is known as Malcolm X Boulevard in Harlem; Seventh Avenue, which is named for Adam Clayton Powell Jr.; and Eighth Avenue, which is named for Frederick Douglass,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Greenthal executives said that with the opening of the residential sales office, their company was the first major real estate company to establish a presence in Harlem. ''Now, we are the first of the major firms to establish a presence in Harlem's commercial real estate market as well,'' said William West, the chief executive of Charles H. Greenthal.</p>
        <p>Mr. Moody said investors were becoming more interested in Harlem, which has seen an upturn in retailing activity with the opening of the 275,000-square-foot Harlem USA complex, which includes Gap, Old Navy and Disney stores.</p>
