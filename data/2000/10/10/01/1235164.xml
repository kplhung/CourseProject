        <p>TO Sara Gay Forden, the most compelling character in her new book ''The House of Gucci'' (William Morrow) may well have been the one that got away. Ms.  Forden's labyrinthine tale of familial corruption, betrayal and greed in the renowned Italian luxury empire spans the decades from 1921, when Guccio Gucci founded the company, to the present.</p>
        <p>Along the way, the author provides revealing glimpses of a multitudinous cast of players, in particular Maurizio Gucci, whose 1995 murder, arranged by his former wife, is the book's framing drama.</p>
        <p>One subject who eluded Ms. Forden during her research, however, was Sheree McLaughlin Loud, a rangy American former model, who was Maurizio Gucci's girlfriend during the turbulent years 1984 to 1990. Described in the book as the single ''ray of sunshine'' in Mr. Gucci's life, Ms. Loud refused to return Ms. Forden's calls.</p>
        <p>But recently, Ms. Loud materialized at a book party for Ms. Forden given by Rizzoli. Tears welling in her eyes, the tall, fair-haired Ms. Loud embraced the author and confided, ''Those were some of the most intense years of my life.'' She said that after reading the book, she regretted her decision not to cooperate.</p>
        <p>A few days later, at her office in Midtown Manhattan, Ms. Loud, 41, who is now the communications director for Giorgio Armani's Collezioni label, recalled the years of intimacy with Mr. Gucci, a grandson of the company founder.</p>
        <p>''I didn't tell a lot of people about my relationship with Maurizio while it was happening, and I saw no reason to tell Sara when she called,'' said Ms. Loud, dressed in an understated Armani knit top and trousers. ''My experience in Italy had quite simply changed my life. I didn't want it to be in some gossip book.''</p>
        <p>During her six-year relationship with Mr. Gucci, whom she met during preliminaries for the 1984 America's Cup regatta, she made almost weekly commutes between New York and Milan. ''I traveled by Concorde, then by private plane, and I would arrive in Milan almost any hour of the day or night,'' Ms. Loud said. ''To me the trip was nothing -- it was just like a ride to the Hamptons.''</p>
        <p>At the time, Mr. Gucci was separated from his wife, Patrizia Reggiani. ''There weren't too many stabilizing people around him -- he had hardly any friends,'' Ms. Loud recalled. She spent days lolling on the deck of his yacht, the Creole, or at his chalet in St. Moritz.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gucci, who owned 50 percent of the company, was consumed by a desire to restore the luster of Gucci's image, tarnished over the years by cheap, overdistributed goods.</p>
        <p>''I felt like I was living a movie,'' said Ms. Loud, who was 25 when she met Mr. Gucci, 10 years her senior, referring to both her love affair and the House of Gucci itself. So intimidated was she at the start of the affair that she refused to set foot in the Fifth Avenue store. ''After a year, I did go, and I bought this one little bag, just to show him that I liked his product,'' she said.</p>
        <p>In dark moments, Mr. Gucci brooded. Domenico De Sole, Gucci's chief executive, was in talks with Investcorp, the merchant bank, which bought Gucci in 1993 and provided the funds for the house's spectacular turnaround under the designer Tom Ford. Ms. Loud recalled that after Mr. De Sole clinched the deal with Investcorp, Mr. Gucci considered him a traitor.</p>
        <p>''He thought everyone was betraying him,'' she said. ''He swore to me that Patrizia was trying to kill him. He told me she was poisoning him.''</p>
        <p>At the time, Ms. Loud dismissed his suspicions. ''I'm from Connecticut, you know,'' she said. ''I come from practical people. For me that kind of thinking is just too bizarre.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Reggiani, whom the Italian press dubbed the Black Widow, had long sought her former husband's ruin. She was convicted two years ago of engineering his murder and sentenced to 29 years in prison.</p>
        <p>Ms. Loud has since gone on to a new life. Last summer, she married Rob Loud, a money manager, and is expecting her first child in March. At work, she has her hands full, overseeing public relations and marketing for Le Collezioni. But her years with Mr. Gucci haunt her.</p>
        <p>''I can't believe Patrizia had him killed,'' she said, incredulous. ''All that belongs to another world. And I was another person. I dream about it.''</p>
