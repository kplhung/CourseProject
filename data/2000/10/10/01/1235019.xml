        <p>WELCOME to Newark International Airport from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, transmitting on highway advisory radio 530-AM. Please be advised that monorail service has been suspended at all stations and that despite the exhaustive guidance I'm about to give you in this radio announcement, coming here today may turn out to be the biggest mistake you have ever made. We sincerely regret any inconvenience.</p>
        <p>A $3.8 billion construction program is under way at the airport. Over the next two years we will improve the roads, build two parking garages and expand and upgrade the terminals. The thing is, just about the time we're completing that work, we'll announce another construction program that is even more expensive and disruptive. Hey, it's not just us; in case you haven't noticed, every airport in the country is in a constant state of construction and rebuilding. It's a little something we do on the theory that if we keep you busy dodging bulldozers and looking for parking spaces, you won't notice all the flight delays, flight overbookings, flight reroutings and flight cancellations. We abjectly apologize for any inconvenience.</p>

        <p>WELCOME to Newark International Airport from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, transmitting on highway advisory radio 530-AM. Please be advised that monorail service has been suspended at all stations and that despite the exhaustive guidance I'm about to give you in this radio announcement, coming here today may turn out to be the biggest mistake you have ever made. We sincerely regret any inconvenience.</p>
        <p>A $3.8 billion construction program is under way at the airport. Over the next two years we will improve the roads, build two parking garages and expand and upgrade the terminals. The thing is, just about the time we're completing that work, we'll announce another construction program that is even more expensive and disruptive. Hey, it's not just us; in case you haven't noticed, every airport in the country is in a constant state of construction and rebuilding. It's a little something we do on the theory that if we keep you busy dodging bulldozers and looking for parking spaces, you won't notice all the flight delays, flight overbookings, flight reroutings and flight cancellations. We abjectly apologize for any inconvenience.</p>
        <p>Almost half of the spaces in daily parking lot C have been eliminated to make way for the construction, and the main entrance to C parking has been combined with the entrance to B parking. Also, B, C and D are off-limits to S.U.V.'s with CD players, and E, F and G are reserved for GTO's, BMW's, RV's and VW's. In addition, just for the fun of it, we've turned around some of those tire-spike things at the entrances and exits. We are deeply saddened by any inconvenience.</p>
        <p>So anyway, as we're tearing everything up for this construction, we get a call from the company that made the monorail, telling us that the danged thing is busted. You remember the monorail: it's that zippy $350 million contraption we put in four years ago with a veritable sonic boom of fanfare. Phrases like ''state of the art'' were thick in the air. Well, guess what? Nobody thought to waterproof the thing, so now it needs $25 million in repairs and is going to be shut down for months. The inconvenience of it weighs heavily on our conscience.</p>
        <p>Red-jacketed customer service representatives are on hand to assist and further confuse you. These service representatives are everywhere -- in the terminals, on the sidewalks, in the parking lots, in the cockpits. It may occur to you that all these new employees had to park somewhere and that perhaps this is why there are no parking spaces left for you. Let me say, on a personal note, that this same thing occurred to a certain former Vice President for Construction Planning and Monorail Maintenance, but that he has recently been reassigned to Busywork and Radio Greetings, so it's out of his hands. Honk if you object to demotions without possibility of appeal.</p>
        <p>Courtesy buses are available at all monorail stations to transport you to terminals, parking lots, car rental counters, hotels and, of course, other buses. In fact, so many buses are jockeying for space that someone in a car is likely to be squashed or rear-ended if he takes his eyes off the road even for a second to try to read the baffling array of signs. We would strongly suggest that you simply turn around and drive home, but if you're listening to this announcement it's already too late, isn't it? We flog ourselves daily over the inconvenience of it.</p>
        <p>Bright orange ''Monorail Service Alert'' posters have been scattered throughout terminals A, B and C to point you this way and that. For your convenience, the directional arrows on these signs are changed hourly, at random. Also, for those who prefer to walk between the various parking lots and terminals, thousands of colorful footprints have been painted on the sidewalks to direct you to the appropriate destinations. Follow the red feet for A, the purple feet for D. These, incidentally, are also the colors your own feet will be if you attempt any of these walks carrying heavy bags. On a personal note, I can tell you that the formerly high-ranking employee who was given the job of actually making these painted footprints still can't fit back into his shoes. Honk if you favor health insurance coverage for foot massages.</p>
        <p>Although it's irrelevant at this point, you should have allowed at least an hour extra for your trip to the airport today. In fact, if your destination is anywhere east of the Mississippi and north of Atlanta, you should have just driven there. Frankly, it may be a good time to reassess your neurotic need to go places. Rabbits live their entire lives on less than one acre; maybe you should, too. This is 530-AM, thanking you for listening and, of course, apologizing for the inconvenience.</p>
