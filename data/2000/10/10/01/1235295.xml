        <p>The fishing went off at Montauk one recent afternoon. Overnight, the coast teemed with feeding fish: blues, albacore and stripers.</p>

        <p>Bang!</p>
        <p>The fishing went off at Montauk one recent afternoon. Overnight, the coast teemed with feeding fish: blues, albacore and stripers.</p>
        <p>My guide, as she had been for most of the summer, was Amanda Switzer of Three Mile Harbor. Amanda is a born angler. She has that sense that there will be fish here and not there, that a cast in the next second but not five seconds later will catch a fish, and that she may ease upon a school of feeding stripers if she cuts the engine now and glides toward shore.</p>
        <p>I have been fishing much longer than she has. I have fished many more places. Occasionally, I can cast farther. Still, time after time, so many times that I know it's not an accident, she has taken three fish to my one, four fish to my none.</p>
        <p>We putt-putted out of Montauk Harbor. The sleepy summer port showed signs of energizing for the fall. Commercial fishermen in boats large and small made their way out of the harbor. Amanda waved to a friend who towed his rusty but reliable old trawler to the boatyard. Outside the jetty, two fishing boats, draggers' nets hanging from their sides, made their way from Three Mile Harbor. Obviously, they had heard of the goings on at Montauk as well.</p>
        <p>We headed for the Point. The remnants of a tropical storm were bearing in from the south, and we hoped for a two- or three-hour window of fishing before the seas built too much for her flats skiff. In the distance, we saw a few boats in the tidal rip that had formed past the lighthouse.</p>
        <p>When we rounded the Point, there was a flotilla of boats of all sizes extended as far as I could see. A picket line of surf-casters ranged along the shore. Mobile homes crouched on the cliff tops like a row of pillboxes guarding the coast.</p>
        <p>Bunker, or perhaps snapper blues, leapt from the rip, desperate to escape predators. Amanda cut her engines. She took up her rod. She is a lefty who learned her fly-fishing on saltwater, so her cast has none of the frantic to and fro that betrays trout fishermen who take up saltwater fly-fishing after years on the stream.</p>
        <p>A pod of albacore came up in back of us. In unison, we wheeled and fired, like grouse hunters pointing and shooting at the sound of flushing birds. Amanda was quicker than I was. She connected as the fish swirled with operatic enthusiasm.</p>
        <p>I tried another cast but had no time to fish it out as Amanda pointed her rod toward the front of the boat and, looking for all the world like a neophyte water skier holding on for dear life, she ran forward, around the bow and then back to the rear as the albie dashed for safety, and Amanda tried to keep it from doubling over and breaking her rod.</p>
        <p>The school of albacore, as is their habit, moved up and down the beach, returning every 15 minutes, a half-mile circuit. We chased them for an hour.</p>
        <p>''Good, but not amazing,'' Amanda said. ''Let's head east and see what's happening.''</p>
        <p>We moved out at full throttle. The warm southern wind felt soft. The air shimmered with the frosted glass look that deKooning and his painter friends called Long Island light.</p>
        <p>''One of the last T-shirt days,'' Amanda added.</p>
        <p>As we approached the cliffs just west of the Point, we saw Paul Dixon, Amanda's mentor, and the dean of East End fly-rodding. Somehow he always knows where the fish are. He gestured to us.</p>
        <p>We looked ahead of him. There in the rocks next to the shore the black forms of bass en masse churned the water. Surrounding them, large bluefish picked off bait that had escaped the mayhem of the stripers.</p>
        <p>I cast into the school. I was a little short. A bluefish struck. Five minutes later all 8 pounds of him went into the cooler. On the next pass, I took the helm and Amanda picked up her rod. Bang! A 34-inch bass slammed her fly. I backed us out, and she fought the fish to the boat. We crept in on the school again, and again, and again. Every approach produced a good bass.</p>
        <p>Then other boats started to show up. The only way to fish this small pod of big fish was for one boat to move in, hook up and back out. It became a bit of a circle dance. We waited back from the pack. A huge school of large bass came up in back of us. We circled and drifted into them and within two or three casts we were both into keeper fish. We landed them. Amanda stood on the stern, spread her arms and cracked a grin as wide as a pie plate.</p>
        <p>''You can have a whole month of crummy fishing, and then this,'' she said.</p>
        <p>We fished until we had our fill, and when we left the bass were still working.</p>
        <p>That night, I pan-roasted the bass in a corn meal crust and topped it with a salad of diced tomato, watermelon, celery leaves and chili oil. A cold riesling went down perfectly on this first perfect striper day of the season.</p>
