        <p>DOMINIC J. BARANELLO is something of an institution in Suffolk County politics.</p>

        <p>DOMINIC J. BARANELLO is something of an institution in Suffolk County politics.</p>
        <p>Since Lyndon B. Johnson was president, few Democrats have considered a campaign in Suffolk County without first consulting Mr. Baranello. He was widely recognized as the nation's longest-serving Democratic Party leader when he finally stepped down as the Suffolk County chairman late last month.</p>
        <p>Vice President Al Gore visited Mr. Baranello in his Centereach law office last spring to seek his support. And he was among the first New Yorkers that Hillary Rodham Clinton called when she began her bid to become a United States Senator.</p>
        <p>But it wasn't just his longevity that earned him the respect of such national figures. Over the years, Mr. Baranello developed a reputation as a scrappy strategist who was able to overcome the Republican Party's 2-to-1 advantage in voter registration to twice elect a Democratic county executive and to claim all three of Suffolk's congressional seats in the mid-1980's. His knack for picking winners also earned him the leadership of the state Democratic Party in the late 1970's when Gov. Hugh Carey rewarded him for being one of his earliest supporters.</p>
        <p>Even the Republicans who crossed swords with Mr. Baranello seem to truly respect and admire him. ''He was a worthy adversary,'' said Howard C. DeMartini, who served two stints as Suffolk's Republican chairman in the 1990's. ''Whereas the average shelf life of a Republican Party chairman has been about 3.4 years, he has lasted for 34 years.''</p>
        <p>It did not come as much of a surprise when the 78-year-old Mr. Baranello announced he would not seek an 18th two-year term as Suffolk County chairman. Earlier in the year, he had taken a $136,000-a-year job as vice president of Suffolk Off-Track Betting, a prime spot for party patronage jobs. He also had named a protege, Supervisor Richard H. Schaffer of Babylon, as a top party deputy. Mr. Schaffer is the new party chairman.</p>
        <p>Mr. Baranello said he set the stage for a graceful exit because ''the whisperings on the street'' that he was no longer leading the party adequately suggested strongly that ''it was time to do something else.''</p>
        <p>For several years, his detractors had been saying that Mr. Baranello lacked the energy to marshal the political troops as he once had. Some felt he gave too many of the few patronage jobs the Democratic Party has to friends and family. One of his sons, for example, runs the print shop at O.T.B.</p>
        <p>They pointed to the party's defeat in recent countywide races and quietly referred to Mr. Baranello's memory lapses as signs that he should step down. When regaling a crowd with tales of old victories and defeats, he would often pause to ask, ''what was that fellow's name again?''</p>
        <p>Floyd Sarisohn, a longtime colleague and Democratic activist, dismissed the criticism. ''He's just like a huge computer that has absorbed a ton of information,'' he said. ''It takes a little longer, but he can still find everything because he knows it.''</p>
        <p>But even Mr. Schaffer admitted that the local party needed to be refocused. ''It has become a little dormant on some of the grass-roots things that have gotten us where we are, things like get-out-the-vote rallies and going door to door,'' he said. ''But you can't put that all on Dominic. Some of the local leaders dropped the ball as well.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Schaffer, at 36, is a political wunderkind who started running election phone banks when he was only 13 years old. With Mr. Baranello's help, he was elected to the county Legislature at 22 and has been Babylon's supervisor since 1992.</p>
        <p>Mr. Baranello wasn't much older when he made his first run for public office -- justice of the peace. He also ran for the newly formed county Legislature in 1971. He lost both times. But he was the party leader in the Town of Brookhaven when H. Lee Dennison, a Republican, was recruited by the Democrats to run for county executive in 1960. Mr. Dennison won and served for 12 years, with Mr. Baranello one of his fiercest supporters.</p>
        <p>Mr. Baranello is more specifically credited with helping to build the careers of Patrick Halpin, Suffolk's second Democratic county executive, and Thomas J. Downey, who was elected to Congress when he was only 25 and served for 18 years before being ousted by Rick A. Lazio in 1992.</p>
        <p>As he announced his retirement at the county convention at the Knights of Columbus hall in Patchogue on Sept. 21, Mr. Baranello told one of his favorite stories about how he pulled together a tenuous bipartisan majority to elect the county Legislature's first Democratic presiding officer.</p>
        <p>It was in 1988, when the Democrats and Republicans each had nine seats. With Mr. Baranello's help, Sondra M. Bachety had secured the support of two Republicans, but lost the initial vote because a Democratic colleague, Steven Englebright, accused her of conspiring with Republicans and voted against her.</p>
        <p>The discussion behind closed doors got so heated that Ms. Bachety beaned Mr. Englebright with her pocketbook. Mr. Baranello said he got Mr. Englebright on the phone and ''used all of the swear words I had and told him to go back in there and vote for her.'' But the meeting had been adjourned, and the two Democrats vowed never to speak to each other again.</p>
        <p>With a week before the next meeting of the Legislature, Mr. Baranello schemed to bring Ms. Bachety and Mr. Englebright to the party's headquarters in Patchogue one snowy Sunday afternoon with neither knowing the other would be there.</p>
        <p>''I told her she might say 'I'm sorry I broke your glasses and hit you with my bag' and told him he should apologize too,'' Mr. Baranello said. ''So when he came in the room, she gets up close to him, puts her arm around him and says 'I'm sorry,' and he began to cry. And that's how we got her elected.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Bachety, now the executive director of the Babylon Industrial Development Agency, said of Mr. Baranello: ''Most of us remember him for his ability to bring together diverse groups. We had everybody, the very liberal Democrats, the black caucus Democrats, the gay groups, the anti-abortion people, the pro-choice people, and yet he had this amazing ability to bring people together and make them all part of the general organization.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Englebright said Mr. Baranello found ways to convince dissenters that his way made more sense politically. ''He understood different people's sense of independence and he was a student of the way people interact,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Nora Bredes, a former Suffolk County legislator, said that another of Mr. Baranello's greatest strengths was his ability to adjust with the times.</p>
        <p>Ms. Bredes, a lifetime Democrat, first ran for the county Legislature as an independent in 1989 because Mr. Baranello was supporting a Democrat who had also accepted the endorsement of the Right to Life Party. The Republican candidate won the seat because her maverick candidacy split the Democratic vote.</p>
        <p>''Dominic held that against me,'' she said. ''But by 1992, he was able to move on and he was wholeheartedly behind me when I ran again and we won.''</p>
        <p>And 1989 was the last time he supported a Democrat who would accept a Right to Life endorsement.</p>
        <p>That he was able to be conciliatory when necessary did not mean that he was above playing hardball with someone he believed had strayed too far from the fold. In 1989, he successfully ran a primary candidate against Wayne Prospect, a 10-year Democratic incumbent on the county Legislature who had long been at odds with Mr. Halpin, the Democratic county executive. But Mr. Prospect mainly blamed Mr. Halpin for his ouster and said, ''Dominic and I are both past that.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps the biggest political mistake that Mr. Baranello made was in 1982, when, as state party chairman, he endorsed New York City Mayor Edward I. Koch instead of Mario M. Cuomo, who was then lieutenant governor. Mr. Cuomo went on to become governor and promptly stripped Mr. Baranello of his state chairmanship.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Baranello does not regret his decision. ''It's like betting on a horse,'' Mr. Baranello said. ''Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose.''</p>
        <p>His support earned him Mr. Koch's undying loyalty. ''I will never forget what he did for me,'' Mr. Koch said. ''He paid the ultimate political penalty for it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Baranello and Mr. Cuomo have also long since patched up their differences. ''He did the intelligent thing'' when he supported Mr. Koch, Mr. Cuomo said. ''Based on the evidence he had at the time, I couldn't win. I might've even gone against me.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cuomo said he saw Mr. Baranello as the ''quintessential old-fashioned politician,'' one who believed deeply in the ideals of the party and in the party organization.</p>
        <p>Mr. Baranello, raised in Medford and the son of a highway laborer who immigrated from a tiny Italian village along the Adriatic, said that one of the main reasons he has loved politics all these years is because it has allowed him to tell and retell a story that still brings tears to his eyes when he recounts it.</p>
        <p>''The first sensation I got of being a Democrat came when I was just a kid and I was wrestling with my kid brother and my mother told us to cut it out because Papa was going to listen to the president of the United States on the radio,'' he said. He vividly remembers his father tuning the cathedral-shaped radio to capture the voice of Franklin D. Roosevelt and staring enraptured at the radio as the president spoke.</p>
        <p>And when F.D.R.'s fireside chat had ended, he said his father called to him, ' ''Domenico, veni qua,' and he points to the radio and says, 'You remember, that's the president of the United States and he cares about you and he cares about Mama.' ''</p>
        <p>That, said Mr. Baranello, is why he has spent his entire life working for the Democratic Party. ''I never forgot that,'' he said. ''Because it told me that the business of government is people.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  October 8, 2000, Sunday  An article last Sunday about the retirement of Dominic Baranello, the longtime Democratic Party chairman of Suffolk County, misidentified the first Democratic presiding officer of the county Legislature. It was Floyd S. Linton in 1975, not Sondra M. Bachety in 1988.</p>
