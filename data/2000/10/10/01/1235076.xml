        <p>WHILE Edison has many restaurants featuring the wheat-based fare of North India -- puffy naan bread served with tandoori chicken -- few offer the rice-based vegetarian cuisine of the Spice Coast in South India, a place where steaming idlis, crunchy dosas and pillowy uttappam reign.</p>
        <p>Murali Iyengar, co-owner of Swagath Gourmet, knew that along with immigrants from the north, the town was also filled with South Indian Brahmins, whose customs include special foods. Food was a natural choice for Mr. Iyengar, also a Brahmin and a man who had spent his youth cooking for his 11 brothers and sisters in his homeland.</p>
        <p>With the help of his wife, Padma, his brother Sesha and his sister-in-law Suguna, Mr. Iyengar has been serving South Indian dishes at Swagath since 1992. The response from his fellow Indians and from non-Indians has been enthusiastic.</p>
        <p>The first rice-based dish I sampled there was straightforward and soothing. Idlis are made from a batter composed of three parts white lentils to one part coarse ground rice, all of which is fermented and then  steamed in heaping mounds. The result is just as Mr. Iyengar phrases it: ''protein and starch in perfect balance.'' Eaten alone, this steaming cake may seem as bland as hospital food. But it's ideal for dipping into the sauces that accompany almost all of Swagath's dishes: a chutney of chopped coconut mixed with tamarind, jalapenos and roasted chickpeas; and a sambar, a lentil stew studded with onions and tomatoes and seasoned with 14 South Indian spices. One half of the meal is substance, the other is pure flavor.</p>
        <p>Thair vada is a crispy yet soft doughnut made from soaked ground lentils that have been mixed with onions, curry and peppers and  served in a bowl of cool yogurt curry.  Topped with toasted kernels of chickpea flour and cilantro leaves, this dish also became a complete meal -- protein, dairy and starch all disguised within a creamy, crunchy, wonderfully flavorful dish.</p>
        <p>If it is the satisfaction of actually dunking the doughnuts you crave, then try the Mysore vegetable bonda and dip it into the sambar and chutney. Even these are nutritious. Softer in texture than falafel, these four fritters are stuffed with potatoes, carrots and cauliflower, all rolled in chickpea flour and deep-fried until golden brown.</p>
        <p>One appetizer, rava idli, uses cream of wheat (sogi) rather than rice. The rava idli is similar to the plain idli, only mixed with chickpeas, roasted mustard seeds, cashews, ginger and herbs. You might not even need the sauces with this many goodies included.</p>
        <p>My favorite, and by far the most visually striking dish at Swagath, is the dosa. Dosas use the same white lentil-and-rice batter as idlis, but instead of being steamed are simply cooked in paper-thin rounds on a griddle. The masala dosa is superb, filled with potato and onion masala, which is basically an elegant version of hash browns. But the onion masala dosa is even better. It is the same preparation, sprinkled with tender, lightly sweated onions before Mr. Iyengar folds it into a neat, long bundle. The extra onions add texture and sweetness to an already addictive dish that you can eat with your hands. You should.</p>
        <p>The same batter can also be used to make uttappam and adai, which are thicker. At Swagath, the porous cakes called uttappam allow you focus once again on the sauces, soaking them up as you would with injera, the spongy bread in Ethiopian restaurants. The onion-chili version is filled with either onions or chilies or both, you choose. A rosy version of the uttappam is the Mysore adai, a pancake in which three other types of  lentil are added to the base. The whole mixture is seasoned (and reddened) with chili powder, then topped off onions. It is another complete meal, even more satisfying when paired with an icy bottle of beer or a chilled glass of white wine.</p>
        <p>There are also the risotto-like rice dishes or traditional South Indian complete dinners (thali) that include sides of vegetables, rice, bread and dessert. Padma steered me in the right direction, recommending the bisebelabath and the venn pongal.  The bisebelabath is a South Indian specialty cooked with lentils, green beans and carrots, garnished with peanuts, roasted mustard seeds and curry leaves. Venn pongal incorporates yellow split peas and rice, cooked in milk, coconut, ginger, cumin and black pepper, garnished with roasted mustard seeds and cashews.  These ingredients were happy to be the main event rather acting as a side dish with poultry or meat.</p>
        <p>I've heard that good Indian food keeps you wanting more. If that is true for you, it won't hurt your wallet at Swagath to order additional items to take home with you.</p>
        <p>But first, dessert. One, badam halwa, is a semicoarse paste made from almonds that have been soaked overnight in milk, cooked in honey and ghee (clarified butter) and colored and seasoned with saffron. It is marzipan taken to a new height. And with ice cream on top, it's called nirvana, and no wonder. I wouldn't be surprised if the gulab jaman made an appearance on the menu at the haute Jean-Georges in Manhattan: it's a solitary fried sphere of milk and flour resting in a honey-and-sugar syrup flavored with saffron and cardamom. When I sliced into the ball with a spoon, the steam escaped into a dessert soup.</p>
        <p>Like everything else at Swagath Gourmet, it was all I needed and more.</p>
