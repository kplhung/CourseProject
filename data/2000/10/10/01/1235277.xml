        <p>Last year, the churches and businesses of South Carolina rose up as one to help drive the electric jangle of video poker from the state. But now, as pastors work to rouse their congregants against a proposed state lottery on the November ballot, they are finding a bit less sympathy in the pews and the state's corporate offices.</p>
        <p>Disdain for the idea of state-run gambling is plentiful in this deeply religious state, particularly in the Piedmont region in the northwest. Most major church groups, from fundamentalist Southern Baptists to more moderate United Methodists, have come out forcefully against the lottery plan, hoping to make South Carolina the second Southern state in a year to reject a lottery, after Alabama last October.</p>
        <p>But no one is confidently predicting it will be defeated here, because it is not video poker, and South Carolina is not Alabama. Many residents say lotteries, which are now operated by 37 states, are a relatively mild way to raise money for schools and scholarships, and they are not as bothered by the moral implications of a lottery as they were by the more addictive video poker. (The last poker machine left the state in July after a State Supreme Court ruling, but if the court had not killed it, a planned referendum almost certainly would have.)</p>
        <p>''I'm not for it myself, but I'd say the congregation is about split down the middle,'' said the Rev. Albert A. Neal, pastor of the Antioch Baptist Church in a mostly African-American neighborhood here. ''People say we have to do something about education here because it's the only way out of poverty, and they see a little bit of hope in the lottery.''</p>
        <p>If the lottery is defeated here as it was in Alabama, it could mean that legalized gambling -- which exists in various forms in Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas -- may finally have run its course in a region where churches are immensely influential. But if the lottery passes, then North Carolina, which would be wedged between two lottery states, would feel pressed to adopt one, and that pressure could expand to Tennessee.</p>
        <p>Two years ago, a state lottery to raise money for education was the principal campaign promise of Gov. Jim Hodges, who remains the most prominent proponent of the plan. Mr. Hodges argued at the time that South Carolinians were driving next door to Georgia to play the lottery, and were thus increasing the number of college scholarships the popular program made available only to Georgia residents. His eight-percentage-point margin of victory led many to believe the lottery would also pass, and polls have consistently shown that a majority of voters support it.</p>
        <p>The lottery's proponents, many of whom are Democrats close to Mr. Hodges, say it will generate $45 million for classroom technology and $105 million for 100,000 college scholarships. The state's schools have been improving in recent years, but its high school students still rank last in SAT scores, and supporters say there is no chance a tax increase will be passed.</p>
        <p>''This is like a raffle ticket, not Las Vegas-style casino gambling,'' said Kevin Geddings, a former chief of staff to Mr. Hodges who is running the pro-lottery campaign, which has raised about $500,000. ''It's no more gambling than buying a $1 raffle ticket for the Richland Northeast marching band, and I think people will see that.''</p>
        <p>Of course, that was what proponents said about the lottery in Alabama last year, where polls also predicted its passage before 54 percent of the voters chose to defeat it. Supporters here say Alabama is more rural and conservative than South Carolina, and note that the election was held in an off-year, when the less committed masses stayed home. But in fact, lottery forces in Alabama were blindsided by the enormous and influential opposition of the state's churches, a group that is no less influential in South Carolina.</p>
        <p>''The church leaders are really worked up now, and I'm impressed that they got some good advice from Alabama,'' said James L. Guth, a political science professor at Furman University in Greenville who has studied Southern lotteries. ''Instead of just talking about the morality of gambling, they're stressing the social and public welfare effects of the lottery, which appeals to liberals, too. That could make it more difficult to pass.''</p>
        <p>The church leaders and Republican politicians who have united to fight the proposal have raised more than $200,000 so far, and are spending it on television advertisements that say scholarship winners in Georgia tend to come from neighborhoods much wealthier than those where the lottery is played most heavily.</p>
        <p>Opponents say the promise of education money is typical of the illusions used to pass lotteries in many other states, after which lottery money often replaces revenues from the general fund.</p>
        <p>''It's a religious issue to us in that it promotes greed and fosters the illusion of getting something for nothing,'' said the Rev. Michael Hamlet, senior pastor of the First Baptist Church of North Spartanburg and one of the leaders of the antilottery effort. ''The only way the state wins is if the citizens lose when they play. That's irresponsible.'' Mr. Hamlet's church, which has 5,600 members, has given $25,000 to the campaign.</p>
        <p>Many of the churches' allies in the campaign are Republicans eager to inflict damage on Mr. Hodges. But the churches are not being joined in this effort by business leaders, who enthusiastically worked to eliminate video poker last year, and their absence is telling.</p>
        <p>''More than 75 percent of our membership said we should fight against video poker, because it was bad for the state and bad for the workplace,'' said S. Hunter Howard Jr., president of the South Carolina Chamber of Commerce. ''But this time, the membership is divided, and so we didn't get involved. A lot of the members feel we have more important things to address.''</p>
