        <p>DAVID HAYS, founder of the Theater of the Deaf, set designer for 30 Balanchine ballets and 40 Broadways plays and musicals, intrepid Dad who took his son sailing around Cape Horn in a fearsomely small boat, then wrote about it in ''My Old Man and The Sea,'' has a new book out on  Thursday, called ''Today I Am A Boy'' (Simon &amp; Schuster).</p>
        <p>He will open a book-signing and talk tour tomorrow where he lives, in Chester, at The Lunch Box, 13 Main Street. An early riser who begins his days at the luncheonette, he has scheduled the session to coincide with his breakfast, from 6 to 8 a.m. Count your blessings, the Lunch Box opens at 5.</p>
        <p>The new book is about how Mr. Hays decided four years ago, at the age of 66, that it was time to make his bar mitzvah. So he joined a classroom full of 12-year-olds and set about learning Hebrew and the tenets of Judaism that he had ignored earlier in his life.</p>
        <p>Additional tour stops in Connecticut include one at R. J. Julia Booksellers in Madison (Oct. 12 at 7 p.m. and the Clippership Book Shop in Essex (Oct. 28 from 2 to 4 p.m.).</p>
