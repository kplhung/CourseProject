        <p>NORMAN C. PAYSON has done it again, almost.</p>
        <p>Three years ago, he sold Healthsource, his troubled managed health care company, to Cigna for $1.7 billion and personally collected $90 million. Now he is getting industrywide compliments for rescuing an even worse-off company, Oxford Health Plans, the biggest health maintenance organization in the New York region, from a near-death trauma of undigested growth and management problems.</p>
        <p>But Dr. Payson has still not been able to sell Oxford to a national insurance company, which many analysts believe had been his intention, even though managed-care stocks are performing well. After a bad patch last winter, the stocks are up more than 30 percent, on average.</p>
        <p>In more than two and a half years as chief executive, Dr. Payson, 52, a former family-practice physician who began his career on an Indian reservation, has slashed costs and pulled Oxford out of unprofitable areas. He has raised premiums and said goodbye to 650,000 members, 30 percent of the 1998 peak of 2.1 million. The company's after-tax results have rebounded from a $597 million loss in 1998 to a projected profit of more than $200 million this year.</p>
        <p>''Norm has done a great job,'' said Jonathan Coslet, an Oxford director and a partner in the Texas Pacific Group, the Dallas-based investment fund that recruited Mr. Payson and financed the rescue effort. ''He took a very calculated risk and it has worked out very nicely.''</p>
        <p>Most, but not all, Wall Street analysts have issued ''buy'' orders as Oxford shares have climbed from $6.50 last October; they are now at $30.72. A few contrarian analysts, though, wonder if Oxford can maintain its industry-leading 5 percent profit margins if the company starts to grow and the insurance industry cycle turns downward from the current high, which has allowed many insurers to post double-digit increases in premium rates.</p>
        <p>''The question is, can you grow the business and maintain those margins?'' said James A. Lane, a health care analyst at Salomon Smith Barney.</p>
        <p>Dr. Payson and his investment banker, Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, which is also a minority stakeholder in Oxford, felt confident enough during the summer to search for a buyer for the company, several industry executives said. There have been no takers, at least partly because the rising stock has pumped up Oxford's market capitalization to $2.5 billion, a rich price even for a health plan with 1.45 million members in the relatively untapped New York market for managed care. At the current stock price, a deal would be valued at roughly $1,600 per Oxford member, well above the $1,000 or less of some recent deals.</p>
        <p>''Dr. Payson has done a terrific job turning the company around.'' said Arun Kumar, a health care bond analyst at Chase Securities. ''Now he is a victim of his own success.''</p>
        <p>BUT several analysts said the price per member, or ''life'' in insurance jargon, had been an uncertain guide to the value of recent H.M.O. deals. Aetna  bought the troubled Prudential Health Care  for just $1 billion, sweetened by sizable paybacks by the seller.</p>
        <p>''The price per life is not the key driver,'' Dr. Payson said in an interview. ''It's really earnings.'' The analysts said prospective buyers would be most concerned about the prospects for earnings growth.</p>
        <p>''They probably can grow,'' said Todd Richter, a health care analyst at Banc of America Securities. ''The New York market is in disarray. Aetna is retreating and raising prices aggressively.''</p>
        <p>As Oxford raised premiums and dropped unprofitable business, including its Medicaid managed care unit and companies in Florida and New Hampshire, it lost members in every quarter from the summer of 1998 to last spring. Many who left were small employers, who were aggressively courted by Aetna's U.S. Healthcare unit.</p>
        <p>Dr. Payson said he had completed the first phase of his turnaround plan. Cash flow turned positive during the summer. He eliminated 4,200 jobs, cut costs, paid down $150 million of debt, dropped consultants and improved service to retain ''the good will of doctors,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In its worst days in 1997 and 1998, Oxford infuriated doctors and hospitals by falling far behind in paying for hundreds of millions of dollars of care for Oxford members. Now the company boasts that it has improved its computerized accounting and is paying bills, where there is no dispute about managed-care rules, in 7 days, well below the industry average of 12 to 15 days.</p>
        <p>But not all doctors are satisfied. In a series of letters to the state health department, the New York State Medical Society has accused Oxford of violating a state law by demanding money back from dozens of doctors. Oxford contended that some doctors were charging for more patients than could be seen in a working day and for expensive medical conditions that it said were not justified by a diagnosis.</p>
        <p>Dr. Payson says he is ready to seek growth by offering new types of health insurance and possibly by expanding into nearby counties from Oxford's base in the New York metropolitan area.</p>
        <p>Regulators recently approved a new version of Oxford's popular open-ended, or point of service, health plan, which lets members consult doctors outside the H.M.O. network for an extra charge. Under the new version, Oxford's big network of 53,000 doctors and 210 hospitals would be offered to small businesses at reduced premiums, but employees would pay higher deductible charges and copayments.</p>
        <p>''They are hoping to take back market share from Aetna,'' said William S. McKeever, an analyst at PaineWebber Securities. He is expecting ''continued good earnings gains'' for the quarter that ended on Saturday, and he predicted that the stock would reach ''the mid or high $30's'' in the next nine months.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Lane at Salomon Smith Barney is less sanguine. He recently changed his recommendation from ''buy'' to ''neutral,'' saying prospective Oxford buyers might  wait for a downturn in the insurance cycle.</p>
