        <p>The Golden Age</p>
        <p>By Gore Vidal.</p>
        <p>467 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Doubleday. $27.50.</p>
        <p>If the point of good historical writing is to help us imagine a past that might have been, then it is hard to beat Gore Vidal. His ambitious series of historical novels, a meditation on the meaning of America in seven novelistic parts, is essentially about an America in a parallel historical universe. In the latest, final production, ''The Golden Age,'' we follow the lives of the fictional Sanford family -- wealthy, well-connected men and women in the political, literary and entertainment worlds -- into the middle of the 20th century and eavesdrop by the miracle of historical fiction on the conversations that mattered and several that didn't. If you are at all amused by the possibility of hearing Leonard Bernstein's unrecorded asides or Harry Truman's offhand harrumphs, then much of the book is irresistibly diverting, if quite unreliable.</p>
        <p>We hear, for example, from Herbert Hoover about his nemesis, Franklin Delano Roosevelt -- and who wouldn't have loved to hear him vent? Just after F.D.R.'s third electoral victory, and in the period before Pearl Harbor, Hoover predicts the consequences of America's entrance into World War II. ''I am certain that the next war will absolutely transform us,'' Hoover warns. ''I see more power to the great corporations. More power to the government. Less power to the people. That's what I fear. Because once this starts, it is irreversible. . . . You can't extend the mastery of the government over the daily life of a people without making government the master of those people's souls and thoughts, the way the fascists and the Bolsheviks have done. In his serpentine way, Franklin is going in the very same direction that they have gone in, and I think he knows exactly what he's doing.''</p>
        <p>This is classic Vidal. It is both daring and smart to revisit Hoover, a deeply underestimated figure, and to use him to paint Roosevelt's New Deal as a largely unsuccessful attempt to end the Depression, which segued smoothly into the vast federal war government that still exists, in even more bloated fashion, today. But then Vidal cannot help himself, and he equates -- through Hoover of all people -- this stifling piece of bureaucracy with Hitler's Gestapo and Stalin's Gulag. In Vidal's account, F.D.R. doesn't merely have to be a political master ''whose vast depths of benign insincerity could never be entirely plumbed by any mere mortal,'' but as malign as the despots he helped bring down.</p>
        <p>At times, this political orneriness is bracing, at others merely perverse. The narrative of ''The Golden Age'' is saturated with a casual moral equivalence between the democracies and dictatorships of the 1940's, recasting the ''greatest generation'' as the most oblivious in history, portraying the American midcentury elite as cowardly and corrupt. And Vidal reliably issues condemnations in almost frivolous fashion, through the gossip of a small clique of wealthy leftist intellectuals, whose grand disquisitions and petty jealousies the reader is obliged to take seriously. So we are almost jovially let in on the secret that F.D.R. was actually a war criminal, allowing the bombing of Pearl Harbor (which he knew about in advance) in order to snooker Americans into an unnecessary war with Hitler. In the eyes of Vidal's fictional alter ego, Peter Sanford, Truman was also guilty of mass murder at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, since Japan had been ''trying for some months to surrender'' before the United States wantonly dropped the atomic bomb.</p>
        <p>It's easy to be outraged by these kinds of assertions, but since that is Vidal's point, and since he provides no new evidence for his arguments, it would be foolish to rise to the bait. All the credible evidence points to far more nuanced readings of both Pearl Harbor and Hiroshima than the products of a vast right-wing conspiracy to corrupt American democracy, and Vidal concedes in an afterword that the glosses put upon the facts by his literary characters are subjective only, in ''dangerous territory for the historian.'' What's more interesting is the broad picture of American and world history Vidal paints. If it is not true in a literal sense, does it capture some other truth we have too easily ignored because the winners wrote the history?</p>
        <p>Vidal is best on the surface. His account of the 1940 conventions is a real romp. He depicts F.D.R. with irreverent skill, reminding us that Bill Clinton is not the first president whose sentences require parsing with a toothpick. It's good to know how badly Wendell Willkie could give a public speech; and there are some wonderful scenes in which Eleanor Roosevelt skillfully manipulates her husband and the bosses of the old Democratic Party, the party ''of big-city machines and Southern courthouses each, in its fashion, nostalgic for the happy days of slavery.'' The moment of Roosevelt's fourth Inaugural Address, the haggard capo strapped brutally into his leg braces, swinging his lower body to the White House balcony ''like an absurd toy,'' holding himself upright at the lectern ''with two never very steady hands,'' sticks in the mind. And Vidal captures much of Truman's insecure doggedness as well, even if he is glibly dismissive of Truman's abilities.</p>
        <p>But the broad picture Vidal paints is simply unconvincing. It is impossible to write persuasively about America's coming of age without some account of the rest of the world. Yet for Vidal, the actions of the country's ruling elite are always understood cynically in terms of domestic politics rather than realistically in terms of geopolitical necessity -- an interpretation perhaps less accurate for the 1930's and 1940's than for any other period in American history. The result is a work that almost continuously strains credulity. It is simply silly to speak of Japan ''trying . . . to surrender'' for months in 1945, or of Stalin's being in a ''no-win'' situation in the same year in postwar Europe, cornered into repression by American imperial overreach. We are made privy to the darkest machinations of American party bosses, but there is barely a mention of the political systems in Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia. We are told what kind of salad F.D.R. loathed, and what kind of men Joseph Alsop slept with, but there is scarcely a mention anywhere of the Holocaust, an event that might well affect one's judgment about the propriety of America's European intervention. Roosevelt's political ruthlessness is cheerily equated with Stalin's terror. ''Obviously, our Siberia is a lot nicer than theirs,'' one of Vidal's characters says at one point. ''But Siberia is still Siberia for those you send there.'' The sly calumnies on American decency slowly mount. In Vidal's account, for example, Truman ''recognized Israel, a few minutes after the state was created, in exchange, it was said, for Jewish money to finance his train.'' A nice touch, that ''it was said.'' By whom? The assertions made about world history in Vidal's account are actually less informed -- even if they spring from the same impulse -- than Patrick Buchanan's.</p>
        <p>The other great absence is the American people. One way in which the historical novel can add to our understanding of the past is by recreating the lost voices of the ordinary, interweaving their lives with events beyond their control. This is what Edmund Morris tried to do with some success in his semifictional biography of Ronald Reagan, ''Dutch.'' But Vidal seems utterly uninterested in ''the people,'' except as an object of condescension from his beloved toffs. The only real evocation of the populace is in the mouth of a populist senator, Burden Day. But the kind of populism Day supports is backlit by a grim view of the people themselves: ''It is no accident,'' Day asserts, ''that for 300 years our people willingly, I believe -- maybe even joyously -- slaughtered their way across this continent, enslaved Negroes, drove out Mexicans, broke more Indian treaties than Hitler ever bothered to make.'' Not only is Roosevelt as bad as Stalin, but the American people are worse than Hitler.</p>
        <p>But of the actual lives of ordinary Americans, we read nothing in ''The Golden Age.'' The characters in the novel -- writers, senators, proprietors of political magazines and their countless relatives -- are all so well-heeled that their conversation, when it isn't a clumsy vehicle for Vidal's cranky politics, amounts to little more than chatter. I have to say that I had to strive to find any of the invented characters interesting or memorable. At times the book reads like one of those interminable Vanity Fair pieces about cocktail parties in the 1950's given by society hostesses no one but a complete snob would give a hoot about. Here's a classic example of the fictional padding between the politics: ''Caroline stepped through the open French window onto the rose brick terrace and into the full heat of day. Opposite her, Frederika cowered in the shade of a striped umbrella, weakly fanning herself with the society section of the family newspaper. 'This is not October weather,' Caroline kissed her sister-in-law's cheek, redolent of eau de Cologne.'' On this rarefied stage, we are supposed to understand the moral choices America made confronting Nazism and Stalinism.</p>
        <p>This is where Vidal's idiosyncrasies ultimately wear thin. It is difficult to be seen as a tribune of the plebs when you never leave the social milieu of French chateaus, Georgetown mansions and New York theater openings. It is difficult to make a solid argument about America's imperial temptation when you willfully discount the darkening world that greeted the fledgling superpower in the 1930's and 40's. It is difficult to make an argument about American history when you write a novelistic account that makes grand claims about the American past, but then neither defends them by accountable historical methods nor disowns them as mere fiction. Vidal wants it every which way. In fact, he wants to be Shakespeare (Vidal draws the analogy himself). ''Why do you keep letting Shakespeare leak in upon us?'' Peter asks late in the novel. ''Why not?'' is the answer. ''He gives names to things, real and unreal. He understands how the actors -- the Roosevelts and the Trumans -- are simply spirits and once their scenes are acted out, they melt into air, into thin air, as we shall presently do, still hankering after what was not meant to be, ever.'' But Roosevelt and Truman didn't melt into thin air. They were not invented; and they didn't live long enough ago to be turned into enduring myths. They lived lives and made choices that deserve fearless scrutiny, not snooty, cynical attack. And, by any reckoning, they helped make the world what it now is -- a far freer, brighter place than anything concocted on the strange, orbiting planet called Gore Vidal.</p>
