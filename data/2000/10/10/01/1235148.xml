        <p>Susan Michele LaMontagne and Lawrence Clifford LaRose were married yesterday in East Hampton, N.Y. The Rev. Paula M. Peterson, an interfaith minister, officiated at East Hampton Point, a restaurant.</p>
        <p>Ms. LaMontagne and Mr. LaRose, both in their mid-30's, met at a party in Manhattan in the summer of 1999. Ms. LaMontagne, a tall, athletic woman whose favorite sport is volleyball, liked him right away, although his resume suggested that dating him might not be too wise.</p>
        <p>Mr. LaRose is a co-author of a book about dating called ''The Code: Time-Tested Secrets to Getting What You Want From Women -- Without Marrying Them!'' (Fireside Books, 1996).</p>
        <p>''The book is absolutely about avoiding commitment at all costs,'' said Mr. LaRose, who graduated from St. Thomas College in St. Paul and has a master's degree in comparative literature from New York University. He described his book as a response to ''The Rules: Time-Tested Secrets for Capturing the Heart of Mr. Right'' by Ellen Fein and Sherrie Schneider. That book, he said, was every man's worst nightmare, while his was every woman's worst nightmare.</p>
        <p>Mr. LaRose had recently ended a longtime relationship -- to avoid marrying the woman -- when he was introduced at the party to Ms. LaMontagne. She is a former press secretary to Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania and was a founding partner of Media Strategies, a New York-based public relations firm. She is a graduate of Lehigh University and a daughter of Raymond LaMontagne and a stepdaughter of Monica LaMontagne of Wilton, Conn.</p>
        <p>''She came in to say she was leaving, and I took one look at her and said, 'No, you're not,' '' recalled Mr. LaRose, now the vice president of business development at Annotate.net, a software company in New York. He is a son of Barbara and Clifford LaRose of Edina, Minn.</p>
        <p>''She is a very striking woman: beautiful, tall and very engaging, just wonderfully effusive. She talks a mile a minute. I asked myself very sincerely, 'Why am I not with a woman like her?' ''</p>
        <p>That night they left the party together and talked until 3 a.m. at an Upper West Side bar.</p>
        <p>After that, Mr. LaRose said, his behavior became ''completely un-Code-like.'' He called Ms. LaMontagne the next day. He was always on time for their dates. He did not talk in circles or send mixed messages.</p>
        <p>''We didn't play any games,'' Ms. LaMontagne said. ''He once told me he found me to be the 'anti-Rules' girl, and that's part of the reason he fell in love with me.''</p>
        <p>Four months later, over Thanksgiving weekend, Mr. LaRose broke with the Code entirely: he proposed to her as they were moving into a new apartment together.</p>
        <p>''She's in her sweats, dirty socks, her hair pulled back,'' he said. ''I'm winded from moving furniture. And I ask her to marry me. She kind of dropped her jaw and said yes. I found it very encouraging that she said yes before she actually saw the ring. That was a good sign.''</p>
        <p>The bride said she was now planning a book project of her own. Its title is ''How to Bust the Code.''</p>
