        <p>ON a recent Saturday, Paul Zweban, a restaurateur, stepped out of his apartment building at Riverside Drive and West 91st Street, with Rosemary, his springer spaniel. They were on their way to Riverside Park. ''It is the quietest street I've lived on in New York,'' he said of Riverside Drive, where he has spent four years.</p>
        <p>''There are no bars, no car alarms,'' Mr. Zweban said. ''I can take my dog to the park at 1 in the morning. It's really safe. If people like serenity, this is the place to be.''</p>

        <p>ON a recent Saturday, Paul Zweban, a restaurateur, stepped out of his apartment building at Riverside Drive and West 91st Street, with Rosemary, his springer spaniel. They were on their way to Riverside Park. ''It is the quietest street I've lived on in New York,'' he said of Riverside Drive, where he has spent four years.</p>
        <p>''There are no bars, no car alarms,'' Mr. Zweban said. ''I can take my dog to the park at 1 in the morning. It's really safe. If people like serenity, this is the place to be.''</p>
        <p>Perched above the Hudson River, Riverside Drive curves gracefully for much of its length, from West 72nd Street on the Upper West Side, to Dyckman Street in Inwood, at the northern edge of Manhattan, although the main residential part of the Drive ends about 165th Street. Across the street from the distinguished apartment buildings on the east side of the Drive is Riverside Park, which slopes up from the Hudson River.</p>
        <p>One of the great advantages of living on Riverside Drive, residents say, is its proximity to the hilly English-style park. Riverside Park is not a destination like Central Park but is a magnet for people from the Drive and adjacent streets, noted Ethel Sheffer, an urban planner who has lived on Riverside Drive for more than 25 years. ''With its many levels, it is a wonderful place to walk and stroll, sit and read, and have a sandwich -- even in the colder months,'' Ms. Sheffer said.</p>
        <p>''In the wintertime, if you are walking down to the river on the side streets, you begin to feel icy blasts off the Hudson,'' she added. ''On the other hand, it is a little cooler here in the summer with the breezes that come from the river.''</p>
        <p>The Drive and the southern part of the park, from West 72nd to West 125th Street, were designed as a harmonious entity by the landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted and his colleague Calvert Vaux in the 1870's. ''Riverside-avenue'' opened in 1880 and was completed to 129th Street five years later. It became known as Riverside Drive in 1908.</p>
        <p>In the 1890's, the architect-developer Clarence F. True built many elegant row houses on or adjacent to Riverside Drive between West 72nd and 84th Streets. Some of these houses, built with elaborate cornices, ornate roofs and gables, are today part of the Riverside Drive-West 80th-81st Street Historic District. The Riverside-West 105th Street Historic District, consisting of a group of French Beaux-Arts town houses (1899-1902), is known as ''Paris on the Hudson.'' Riverside Drive was popular then with the newly rich, but it was never as fashionable as Fifth Avenue, historians note.</p>
        <p>In the early 1900's, a number of large houses were built on the Drive, including Charles M. Schwab's chateaulike mansion, which occupied a full block from West 73rd to 74th Street when it was finished in 1906. The Schwab mansion was demolished in 1948 and replaced by the 16-story Schwab House.</p>
        <p>Two freestanding mansions still exist on the Drive, noted Peter Salwen, author of ''Upper West Side Story,'' a history of the area. The former Isaac L. Rice Residence at 346 West 89th Street is now the Ketana Yeshiva of Manhattan, for preschool through eighth-grade students. The other remaining mansion was built at 351 Riverside Drive (107th Street) for Morris Schinasi, who made his fortune selling Turkish tobacco in New York.</p>
        <p>THE few single-family town houses on the Drive trade very rarely, brokers say. The typical building on Riverside Drive today is a doorman co-op. Many of these grand apartment buildings were constructed in the early 1900's to the 1930's to follow the curve of Riverside Drive. During the Jazz Age, George and Ira Gershwin's adjoining penthouses at 33 Riverside Drive were a glamorous gathering ground for entertainers.</p>
        <p>The most desirable apartments on Riverside Drive have views of the Hudson River or the park (especially views above the tree line). In the last 10 years, many lobbies, hallways and elevators have been restored in the Drive's buildings, brokers say.</p>
        <p>On a recent day, there were only 33 co-op apartments and one condominium for sale on Riverside Drive from 72nd Street to 116th Street, said Jim Rosenthal, a vice president with Douglas Elliman. Studio apartments ranged in price from $149,000 to $375,00, and one-bedrooms from $195,000 to $975,000, he said. Two-bedrooms were priced from $495,000 to $1.5 million, while apartments with three or more bedrooms ranged from $1.025 to $2.95 million. Mr. Rosenthal said co-op boards on Riverside Drive are not as snobbish as boards are reputed to be in some other neighborhoods. ''They look for financial stability,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Buyers are predominantly professionals and their families, brokers say. There are many good private and public schools in the vicinity. ''The neighborhood is filled with baby carriages,'' said Ken Scheff, manager of Bellmarc Realty's Upper West Side office.</p>
        <p>Many graduates and faculty members of Columbia University live on the section of the Drive from 100th to 120th Street. ''The neighborhood in the 100's has more of a small-town feeling, with people strolling over to the campus and sitting in coffee shops,'' noted Klara Madlin, the owner of Klara Madlin Real Estate.</p>
        <p>Prices here are ''slightly lower'' than in the 70's and 80's, Ms. Madlin said. A 1,000-square-foot two-bedroom, one-bathroom apartment at 102nd Street with no river views just closed for $435,000, she said, while a similar apartment in the same building with river views sold for $510,000.</p>
        <p>Columbia University owns many buildings on the Drive between 116th and 119th Street. At 120th Street, the Riverside Church, built in 1930, was partly financed by the family of John D. Rockefeller Jr. North of the church, the Riverside Drive viaduct, a raised highway, carries the drive over the Manhattanville valley into Harlem, from 124th to 135th Streets.</p>
        <p>The part of the Drive north of Columbia is beginning to show the effects of gentrification that has swept up the lower part of the Drive. It is a racially mixed area, with professionals, middle- and low-income people, said George Goodwill, chairman of Community Board 9, which represents the area from 110th to 155th Streets.</p>
        <p>The residential part of the Drive stops about West 165th Street. At the Grinnell, a triangular-shaped 80-unit Beaux-Arts co-op with a courtyard at 158th Street, a 1,400-square-foot two-bedroom apartment costs $275,000, and a 2,200-square-foot seven-room apartment is priced at $500,000, said Simone Song, owner of Simone Song Properties.</p>
        <p>THE majority of the rentals on Riverside Drive are in co-op apartments (some are rent-controlled or -stabilized). There are three ''market rate'' prewar rental buildings between 92nd and 96th Streets: 200, 202 and 230 Riverside Drive. At 230 Riverside Drive, a doorman building between 95th and 96th Streets, studios rent from $1,800 to $2,200, said Douglas Wagner, the president of Benjamin James Associates. One-bedrooms range from $2,800 to $3,200, and two-bedrooms average $3,200 to $3,400, Mr. Wagner said.</p>
        <p>Sandy Sweigard, a benefits consultant, moved from White Plains to a one-bedroom rental (with a view) on Riverside Drive in March. ''I was coming into the city for ballets and shows, and now I do the reverse commute,'' she said. ''I wanted to live in a place with human beings around me.'' For Ms. Sweigard, the neighborhood's main appeal is its closeness to cultural attractions (she has season tickets at Lincoln Center and the Joyce Theater). ''Eating is second,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Citarella, Fairway, Zabar's and Murray's Sturgeon Shop are among the abundant (and thronged) gourmet food markets on Broadway, two blocks east of Riverside Drive. Bagel shops, kosher restaurants and health food stores are also plentiful. Symphony Space, a nonprofit performing arts center, is at Broadway and 95th Street.</p>
        <p>Further up in the low 100's, some residents lament that the neighborhood has lost two supermarkets and is inundated with chain drugstores. ''As the neighborhood has got more upscale, chain stores have come in,'' commented Mary Christiansen, an art teacher who lives at Riverside and 104th Street.''</p>
        <p>IN the morning and evening, overflow traffic from the Henry Hudson Parkway causes some congestion on Riverside Drive, Ms. Sheffer said. There are no bus shelters on the park side of Riverside Drive because the park has landmark status. ''In the winter this can make it hard to wait for a bus,'' said Eric Nelson, chairman of Community Board 7, which covers the Drive south of 110th .</p>
        <p>Community residents were instrumental in raising money to design, cast and install the Eleanor Roosevelt Monument, unveiled in 1996 at the 72nd Street park entrance. Other monuments adding a sense of history to the Drive are the Soldiers' and Sailors' Memorial (at 89th Street), the Joan of Arc Memorial statue (93rd Street), the Firemen's Memorial (100th Street) and Grant's Tomb (121st Street), set on a hill overlooking the river. There is an Islamic Cultural Center at 72nd Street and a Buddhist church at 105th Street, as well as many other churches and synagogues on nearby streets.</p>
        <p>One source of a sense of community on Riverside Drive is Riverside Park, which stretches from 72nd to 155th Street. There are 70 ''adopted'' sites, where volunteers tend to their gardens. Unleashed dogs have been a controversial issue in the park, but dog runs at 72nd, 87th and 105th Streets seem to be providing a solution, said James Dowell, executive director of the Riverside Park Fund, a nonprofit group that raises money for the 316-acre park.</p>
        <p>On weekends, notices posted on trees direct families to birthday parties at the Hippo playground at 91st Street and the Dinosaur Playground at 97th Street. Older children use the park area from 101st Street to 111th Street, where there is a synthetic-turf soccer field, sand volleyball courts, basketball courts and a skate park. There are 10 clay tennis courts at 97th Street, as well as 10 reconstructured hard courts at 119th Street. And Cherry Walk, a section along the river between 100th and 125th Streets, has been created for joggers and bikers.</p>
        <p>''Over the next five years we are going to be restoring the pedestrian portion immediately west of Riverside Drive over its entire length from 72nd to 151st Streets,'' said Charles McKinney, administrator of Riverside Park for the Parks Department. Missing elms will be replaced, and hexagonal paving materials, cobblestones and historic ''World's Fair'' benches will be installed in an effort to make Riverside Drive ''one of the most beautiful boulevards in the world,'' Mr. McKinney added.</p>
