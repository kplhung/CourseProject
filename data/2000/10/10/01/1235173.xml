        <p>AFTER just three decades in the American auto market, Honda is poised to sell a million cars and trucks in the United States this year. And it was the Civic that built the franchise.</p>
        <p>The first one arrived in 1973 as OPEC was shutting off the oil spigot. The Civic, then a tiny, efficient subcompact, was the right car in the right place at the right time. Now a substantial small car, the Civic remains a leader in high mileage and low emissions, and the redesigned 2001 model is arriving at a time of tight gas supplies and high prices.</p>
        <p>The Civic is built in 12 countries and sold in 140. More than 10 million have been sold worldwide, and it is on track to be the best-selling small car in America for the sixth straight year. The Civic has won quality awards and engineering acclaim. The coupes and hatchbacks have proved wildly popular among young car customizers.</p>
        <p>But the 2001 model faces the toughest competition yet. Ford's flashy Focus, introduced a year ago, is running not far behind the Civic in sales and was the world's best-selling car in the first half of this year. Nissan beefed up its 2000 Sentra and gave it more power. Volkswagen's Jetta and New Beetle offer fresh, driver-oriented alternatives to Japan's dependable but boring transportation appliances. Meanwhile, improved cars from three Korean automakers are winning budget-minded buyers.</p>
        <p>After a week in which I drove both a gold EX sedan and a bright-red EX coupe, I would still put the Civic at the top of the small-car class, but not by nearly the margin I've given it in the past. If I were shopping for a small car, I'd surely take a serious look at the much-improved competition.</p>
        <p>Honda is not a company that embraces radical change, so it shouldn't be surprising that the look and feel of the latest, seventh-generation Civic have changed only subtly. Why mess with a winning formula?</p>
        <p>Although Ford made a fashion statement with its Focus, Volkswagen played cute with its Beetle and Chrysler went retro with its PT Cruiser, Honda has followed a conservative styling path. It did make the sedan, which was designed in Japan, and the coupe, which was planned in the United States, more distinct from each other -- the same course it took with the current two-door and four-door Accords. The Civic sedan, which went on sale in September, has crisper lines, and it reminded me of a classy, well-tailored suit. Its nose is shorter and more sloping. The coupe, which goes on sale in mid-October, has a lower roofline and a sleeker look. Its windshield and rear roof pillar have a lower, sportier rake than those of the sedan.</p>
        <p>The Civic is now shorter, but larger in most other dimensions. It looks and feels substantial for a small car.</p>
        <p>It is noticeably roomier inside, too, thanks largely to a more space-efficient suspension. As measured by the government, the space for both passengers and cargo has increased. Indeed, the Environmental Protection Agency has moved it up to the compact class, from subcompact status.</p>
        <p>Rear passengers benefit most, because the more compact suspension allows the floor to be completely flat. The center tunnel is gone, thanks to a repackaging of the underbody parts. All passengers get much more comfortable and supportive seats.</p>
        <p>The dashboard is so clean and uncluttered that I thought something was missing. I suspected that Honda had taken content out of the car to trim costs, but when I ran through a checklist of the test cars' equipment, everything was there -- except, perhaps, some character. Is it possible for a design to be too efficient?</p>
        <p>The three-door hatchback, whose sales were slipping, has been dropped. Both the sedan and coupe are available as the base DX, the midlevel LX and the top-of-the-line EX. The coupe also comes as the fuel-efficient HX, which achieves about 40 m.p.g. Another sedan, the GX, is powered by natural gas and is classified as a ''super ultra low emission'' vehicle; Honda calls its powerplant ''the cleanest internal-combustion engine in the world.''</p>
        <p>For now, the performance-oriented Si is missing, though Honda is planning new one.</p>
        <p>A holdout on the use of side air bags in its vehicles, Honda has finally relented. Side bags are now offered on all Civics for $250, and they include a cutoff system that prevents them from deploying if they could put a child or a small adult in danger. Antilock brakes, previously limited to the most expensive models, are now also available on all Civics for $250 extra.</p>
        <p>There are three-point safety belts for all five seating positions, and pretensioners pull the front shoulder belts tightly in a crash. Sensors determine how much force there should be in the air bags' deployment, depending on the crash's severity and whether the driver and passenger are buckled. There are tethers for child-safety seats and an emergency release inside the trunk. While the federal government has not yet crash-tested the 2001 Civic, Honda says its tests indicate that the car will achieve the top, five-star rating.</p>
        <p>If it does, the more rigid body structure will be partly responsible. The stiffer body improves the already responsive handling. In fact, the new chassis, which could certainly handle more horsepower, cries out for a more potent powertrain.</p>
        <p>All Civics are equipped with 1.7-liter, four-cylinder engines, up from 1.6 liters last year, that meet ultra-low-emission standards in all 50 states. The DX and LX have a 115-horsepower version, up from 106. The engine in the EX has variable valve timing, which improves the torque, or getaway response, and raises horsepower to 127. While that is respectable, it cannot match the class-leading 145 of the Nissan Sentra SE.</p>
        <p>The Civic DX, LX and EX come with a five-speed manual or a four-speed automatic transmission. (The HX and GX are available with a continuously variable transmission, an automatic that shifts constantly instead of at fixed points.) The EX sedan that I tested was equipped with the automatic; the coupe had the five-speed manual. Both are silky smooth -- among the best transmissions in any small car. The brakes are excellent, too, bringing the cars to straight, quick stops in panic maneuvers.</p>
        <p>As always, the Civic's quality seems impeccable. Gaps between exterior body panels are impressively tighter than on previous models, and they fit much closer than the pieces of small cars from Detroit.</p>
        <p>Honda says that prices have gone up only slightly on comparably equipped models, though fully equipped Civics now brush uncomfortably close to $20,000 -- at the top of the class. Base prices range from $13,200 to about $18,000. The tested EX sedan, which received the most added equipment and largest price increases, totaled $18,239.</p>
        <p>Civic buyers are among the industry's youngest and most loyal, returning for a second or third Civic or moving up to an Accord or Acura. They are also relatively affluent, and 55 percent are women. These buyers may find the '01 model reassuringly competent. Still, some may wonder, as I did, if the car has sacrificed a bit of its distinctive style and personality in its quest for an ever-larger market.</p>
        <p>INSIDE TRACK: -- Still the leader of the pack, but the wolves are nipping at its wheels.</p>
        <p>Correction:  October 8, 2000, Sunday  An automobile review of the Honda Civic last Sunday misidentified the models on which antilock brakes are available. They are standard on the most expensive Civic, the EX, but are not available on other models.</p>
