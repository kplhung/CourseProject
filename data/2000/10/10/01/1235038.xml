        <p>AVID gardeners know that fall is a time to get back out into the beds and borders. The weeds grow, rain or shine, and all those garden center bargains have to be planted before the nights begin to get frosty.</p>

        <p>AVID gardeners know that fall is a time to get back out into the beds and borders. The weeds grow, rain or shine, and all those garden center bargains have to be planted before the nights begin to get frosty.</p>
        <p>There will come a time, though, when even the most fanatic gardener decides to hang up the tools and take a rest from hands-on activity.</p>
        <p>October, November and December are good months to meet other gardeners and learning from them.  Plant societies, botanical gardens and arboretums sponsor many events, lectures, classes and shows.</p>
        <p>Here is a sampling of events:</p>
        <p>African Violets</p>
        <p>Many gardeners devote the winter to African violets and other members of the gesneriad family. The Long Island Chapter of the American Gloxinia and Gesneriad Society will present a session on creating floral designs with gesneriads at their free monthly meeting on Oct. 14.</p>
        <p>The chapter's meetings take place the second Saturday of each month at Clark Botanic Gardens, 193 I. U. Willets Road in Albertson, N.Y., and start at noon with a plant sale.</p>
