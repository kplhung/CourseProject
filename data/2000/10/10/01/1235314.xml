        <p>The United States persuaded the European Union yesterday to delay imposing billions of dollars in sanctions stemming from a dispute over tax laws, providing at least a short reprieve while both sides seek to cut through a thicket of trade tensions.</p>
        <p>The 11th-hour delay, negotiated in Brussels, is a victory for President Clinton. Mr. Clinton decided this month to hold off on applying new sanctions on European luxury goods in connection with a separate case involving beef and bananas, hoping to a avoid an escalation in trans-Atlantic trade tensions.</p>
        <p>The agreement yesterday is only a procedural delay and does not address the substance of either trade dispute. But it does give the two sides more time to work out settlements to cases they have each won against the other at the World Trade Organization, the Geneva-based trade regulatory body.</p>
        <p>''The United States and European Union today demonstrated a commitment to avoid escalating trans-Atlantic trade tensions and managing this W.T.O. trade dispute responsibly,'' said the United States trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky.</p>
        <p>The delay would appear to justify Mr. Clinton's faith in Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, who had appealed to him to stall new sanctions on Scottish cashmere and other European goods. Mr. Blair persuaded Mr. Clinton that he was intervening to soften the hard-line European stance on both the beef and banana case and the tax case.</p>
        <p>Europe's concession also came after the United States intervened in currency markets to shore up the troubled euro just over a week ago. The Clinton administration took traders by surprise when it joined the European Central Bank in buying euros and selling dollars, at least temporarily breaking what had been a steady fall for the 21-month old European common currency.</p>
        <p>Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers and Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, did not cite festering trade disputes as a reason for the intervention. But the action improved the sometimes hostile relations between the world's two leading economic powers at a crucial time.</p>
        <p>The tax case is, in dollar terms, the largest trade case in history. It involves an American law that allows major corporations, including Boeing and General Motors, to avoid paying some taxes on sales they make overseas. The tax break amounted to $4.1 billion last year. The trade body ruled that the law amounts to an illegal export subsidy, entitling Europe to impose trade sanctions that would probably amount to at least that much each year.</p>
        <p>Under the accord yesterday, Europe will not begin the possibly long process of imposing sanctions until at least Nov. 1, extending by one month the date originally set by the trade organization. That gives Congress more time to pass new tax legislation that the Clinton administration says will bring the country into compliance with trade rules, obviating the need for sanctions. The House has already passed such legislation, and it is now before the Senate.</p>
        <p>The European Union has argued -- and it reiterated its stance yesterday -- that the new American legislation does not address the flaw in the previous tax law. But it also agreed yesterday to allow the W.T.O. to decide on the validity of the new law before any sanctions are imposed. That could mean that even if the new law is ruled a violation, trade between the two powers would not be affected for eight months or so more.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the Clinton administration has yet to publish the new list of sanctions in retaliation for Europe's restrictions on beef and banana trade.</p>
        <p>The administration won the right in 1998 to slap 100 percent duties on about $300 million in European goods each year because Europe restricts trade in beef and bananas. Congress later passed a law requiring the administration to rotate the list of European luxury goods hit by those sanctions to make them more painful to more European companies.</p>
        <p>But the new list is already several months overdue. A senior administration official said this month that they had been placed in ''strategic limbo'' while the two sides seek a settlement.</p>
        <p>A senior American trade official said yesterday that Europe had made some progress toward complying on beef and banana trade, but the official did not suggest that a resolution to the matter was imminent.</p>
