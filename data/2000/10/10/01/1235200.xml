        <p>WHEN child advocates and entertainment industry lobbyists met in 1997 to devise a television ratings system that would include ''V'' for violence and ''S'' for sexual content, one category of programming was notably exempt: the news. So too this campaign season.</p>
        <p>As Congressional committees and federal commissions inveigh against the violent and sexual content that children see in movies and television and hear on compact discs, the news has again gotten a virtual pass, even though local and evening news programs -- and the teasers that promote them -- are a major way children are exposed to violence.</p>
        <p>And that raises a question: even if Hollywood were willing and able to keep some material from children, wouldn't they still see disturbing fare on the news?</p>
        <p>''Leaving the news untouched would leave a significant amount of frightening content on television,'' said Joanne Cantor, professor emeritus of communications at the University of Wisconsin in Madison.</p>
        <p>Professor Cantor, who wrote the book ''Mommy, I'm Scared: How TV and Movies Frighten Children, and What We Can Do To Protect Them'' (Harcourt, 1998), added: ''The decision to exempt the news from this discussion is a political one, not a social-scientific one.''</p>
        <p>The main reason that news programs escape such scrutiny is, of course, that any attempt by Washington to control news-gathering operations would be perceived as censorship. But there are other factors. Local news broadcasts are usually the primary money-makers for individual stations, and any attempt to restrict access to them -- through the V-chip, for example, the device that allows parents to filter out other violent programming -- would be fiercely resisted by station owners.</p>
        <p>And any politicians who sought to shrink the number of people who watched the news would be committing a form of political suicide, reducing the number of potential voters who would be able see their faces and hear their positions, including on Hollywood violence.  There is also the problem attempting to rate a program that can feature the grisly abduction of a child one minute and the recovery of a lost dog the next, all sandwiched around tomorrow's weather.</p>
        <p>''We made a conscious decision not to include news and sports in the ratings,'' said Jeff McIntyre, the federal affairs officer for the American Psychological Association, who was in the room as the television ratings system was hashed out. ''It's not where the majority of the problem is.''</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, there is persuasive research suggesting newscasts are growing more violent, and that large numbers of children are watching such programs and are troubled by what they see.</p>
        <p>Of the 26.9 million people who were in a room with a television tuned to the evening news on the three major networks during the week of Sept. 18, nearly 1 million were ages 2 to 11, according to Nielsen Media Research.</p>
        <p>And the total number of murder and homicide stories featured on the three evening newscasts increased by 633 percent over the last 10 years, from 80 in 1990 to 587 last year, according to the Center for Media and Public Affairs in Washington, a nonprofit organization that monitors news content. Over the same period, the nation's murder rate was nearly cut in half.</p>
        <p>Though little of the research on the impact of televised violence has looked solely at the news, in 1981, Professor Cantor and a colleague asked 300 parents of children from preschool through fourth grade to list the programs or movies that had frightened their children.</p>
        <p>With no suggestions or prompting from the researchers, the parents ranked the television version of the comic book ''The Incredible Hulk'' first, followed by ''The Wizard of Oz'' and ''Jaws.'' Television news was ranked sixth, which meant that children considered it scarier than the fright film ''Halloween'' (No. 7), as well as one of the ancestors of reality programs, ''That's Incredible.'' (No. 10.)</p>
        <p>And this was long before the murder trial of O. J. Simpson, the inquiry into the killing of Jon-Benet Ramsey and the massacre at Columbine High.</p>
        <p>It might be of interest to today's politicians that, in the 1981 survey, ''TV ads for movies'' were ranked No. 9, and thus deemed less of a threat than ''Little House on the Prairie,'' at No. 8.</p>
        <p>PROFESSOR CANTOR agrees with Mr. McIntyre of the American Psychological Association that movies and movie trailers are often bloodier than the news or the promotional spots for the news aired in prime time. But depictions of actual violence, however sanitized, can still be disturbing to a child, said Professor Cantor who, in a survey of 300 parents in 1996, asked whether ''anything on the news has frightened your child.'' One of three said yes.</p>
        <p>Parents of kindergartners reported that their children sometimes had trouble sleeping after seeing footage of tornadoes and earthquakes, '' the professor said. And this was before a whole new genre of prime-time reality programs was introduced with titles like, ''When Animals Attack.'' Older children, said their parents, were more affected by the discussion of criminal violence, ''particularly the victimization of children,'' Professor Cantor said.</p>
        <p>Whether children who see violence on the screen are more likely to commit violent crimes themselves as a result has never been proven. But L. Rowell Huesmann, an expert on media violence at the University of Michigan, said the search for a causal link between violent behavior and violent fare had taken on new urgency as ''the nature of news coverage changes, and the distinction between news and entertainment blurs.''</p>
        <p>But Bob Lichter, president of the Center for Media and Public Affairs, said there was enough evidence that news content needed to change. ''It's not like reality has changed to forced this, '' he said. ''News judgment has changed. It's gone downscale.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lichter said that while eliminating daytime teasers for the 11 o'clock news might help, the only true remedy rested with news directors, who needed to create less sensational broadcasts. But that will never happen unless grown-up viewers demand better news programs by turning the dial or turning off the set.</p>
