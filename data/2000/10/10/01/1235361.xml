        <p>Beijing and the Vatican have feuded since the Communist victory in China in 1949, but tempers have flared anew over events from the distant past. After the Vatican announced it was canonizing 120 Roman Catholics, including 87 Chinese and 33 Europeans, who were killed in China between 1648 and 1930, angry Chinese officials charged that many were colonial oppressors who ''committed monstrous crimes against the Chinese people.''</p>
        <p>Adding to the provocation, the canonization ceremony was scheduled for Oct. 1, the anniversary of the People's Republic. Vatican officials, who have been angered by China's arrests of  priests, insisted that the ''martyrs''  had all worked for the good of China and that the timing was coincidental.</p>
