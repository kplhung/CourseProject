        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Abigail Thernstrom's argument against California's expansion of scholarships for needy students who perform well in high school (Op-Ed, Sept. 26) demonstrates elitism and defeatism.</p>
        <p>She acknowledges that the program is based on merit, with its requirement of a B average, and on need, with its limits on family income. So the only way left to discredit the idea is to say, without offering evidence, that the program will lead to grade inflation and lower standards. The logical conclusion of her argument is that some students are not cut out for college and would never get there unless high schools and colleges lowered standards.</p>
        <p>We in California reject that gloomy assessment of our children and our schools. Gov. Gray Davis and the Legislature have demonstrated their belief that society is better served when our children are better educated.</p>
        <p>JOHN MOCKLER  Sacramento, Sept. 26, 2000</p>
        <p>The writer is California's interim secretary for education.</p>
