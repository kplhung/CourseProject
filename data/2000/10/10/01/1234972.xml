        <p>TWO prisoners flatten themselves like salamanders against a chain fence in their climb to glimpse freedom. Wordlessly, their faces exchange impressions of life beyond jail before dissolving in rage and tears. Then one softly sings of dreams. It's a daring show of vulnerability that triggers a savage beating from the other, whose weapon is a bedspring that once served them as lovers.</p>
        <p>''Bagne,'' the French term for slammer, is a tough jail drama from PPS Danse of Montreal that opens the company's weeklong New York run at the Joyce Theater on Tuesday. With alternating male and female casts, ''Bagne,'' (pronounced ''bang'' in Quebec) is textless physical theater developed in consultation with prisoners and ex-convicts.</p>
        <p>The prison drama, a metaphor for human bonding, is about the need for interdependence. In particular, it addresses the isolation created by social taboos like homoeroticism between men and violence between women. Its realism, authenticated by current inmates as well as former prisoners, who sometimes participate in public postperformance talks, ''Bagne'' is a duet of desperation that takes place in a four-sided metal cage. It is athletic, visceral, battering, gentle and erotic by turns.</p>
        <p>By coincidence, the narrative was made during a period of actual emotional and physical turmoil. During the first week of rehearsals in 1993, the dancer-choreographer Pierre-Paul Savoie (his initials form the name of the company ) fell from the set, tearing a ligament in his left knee. It was a devastating injury; doctors said he would not dance again.</p>
        <p>But Jeff Hall, his partner and fellow choreographer, encouraged Mr. Savoie to continue with ''Bagne.'' Together, they slogged through his depression and convalescence. Then Mr. Savoie began developing his character, using only the strength of his upper body to swing on steel girders, climb mesh barriers, slide down poles and hoist his partner on his back. It took two years and 40 shows before he felt strong enough to dance on his leg again. Mr. Hall, whose idea for the cage inspired the choreography, crawls across beams, kick-boxes, hurls his partner around and even bungee jumps.</p>
        <p>Mr. Savoie's vulnerability underlined ''Bagne's'' theme and helped the two choreographers delve more deeply into their material. ''I was physically and emotionally supporting him,'' Mr. Hall recalls. ''I told him: 'We've gone this far. Even if you just sit in a corner and sing, we'll do this show together.' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Savoie says: ''I created the piece handicapped. It was really dangerous. In our work, we like to push the limit. But in this case, the limit was really close.''</p>
        <p>The easy-going alliance between Mr. Savoie and Mr. Hall began 15 years ago, when they were dance students at Concordia University in Montreal. They shared athletic backgrounds and a fascination with the emotional impact of social prejudices.</p>
        <p>They met in a contact-improvisation class. ''Pierre-Paul was this high-wired case: he was constantly pushing things,'' says Mr. Hall, who credits companies like Montreal's La La La Human Steps, with its emphasis on risk-taking and strength for male dancers, with ''opening the doors for physical men onstage.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Savoie and Mr. Hall are the Mutt and Jeff of dance. Mr. Savoie, 45, is short and compact, with a tender face and soulful eyes. Having studied voice and theater, he choreographs for actors and dancers onstage and for television. At 6 foot 3 inches, Mr. Hall, 42, looms over his partner, his craggy face broken by a puckish grin. In addition to choreographing and performing three duets with Mr. Savoie, he has danced in international productions by the Montreal choreographers Jean-Pierre Perreault and Gilles Maheu and worked in London with Lloyd Newson, the director of DV8 Physical Theater, which specializes in carefully staged mayhem.</p>
        <p>After 75 performances over five years, ''Bagne'' got a sex change in 1998. With two women cast in their roles, the choreographers expect the female version to have a longer life than the male show because, they say, audiences, though shocked by physical violence between women, are more likely to accept women touching each other. The men's ''Bagne'' has been criticized by heterosexuals for its homoerotics and by homosexuals for not going far enough. Mr. Hall and Mr. Savoie insist that ''Bagne'' is not meant to be a gay dance but rather to illustrate how the sexes can trust and manifest strong feelings for each other.</p>
        <p>Sarah Williams took over Mr. Hall's role and Carole Courtois Mr. Savoie's. Like the men, both women have danced for several leading Montreal companies. Ms. Courtois spent years with O Vertigo Danse and Ms. Williams performed with La La La Human Steps. They had never danced together before ''Bagne.''</p>
        <p>Only a few changes were made to allow for the women's smaller size and lesser strength. Although extra training increased their stamina and force, they were unable to perform some of the men's feats. For example, at 5 foot 6 inches, Ms. Williams could not lift and flip the 5-foot-2-inch Ms. Courtois on a steel bedspring. She uses an aluminum replica instead.</p>
        <p>AT first, the women copied the men's roles. But soon the group noticed that the sexes approached issues differently. Ms. Williams and Ms. Courtois were encouraged to introduce female behavior into the piece. ''There is a constant discussion as to what is female and what is male,'' said Mr. Hall. ''Two women directed by men to find a female version -- that causes heated discussions sometimes.''</p>
        <p>Praised by critics as one of the most extraordinary pieces of Quebec dance theater, ''Bagne'' has a hair-raising physicality that stands out in a city known internationally for raw, risky contemporary dance, particularly as exemplified by O Vertigo and La La La. Montreal is Canada's dance capital and home to several dozen innovative choreographers. Among them, PPS Danse's playful energy and skill at performing on surfaces other than floors make for exciting theater. ''Bagne'' is the centerpiece of a trilogy that began in 1987 with ''Duodenum,'' a deliberately absurd wall-walking piece about cartoon heroes, and ended in 1996 with their multimedia, outer-space saga, ''Poles.''</p>
        <p>Like larger Montreal companies, PPS Danse has toured these dances throughout Europe and North America. Of the three, ''Bagne'' is the most controversial. Its interpretation varies according to culture. For example, in Dresden, where it helped commemorate the fifth anniversary of the destruction of the Berlin Wall, Germans saw it as a metaphor for their country's struggle to unify.</p>
        <p>''Bagne's'' choreographic process began with the bungee jump that became its climax. Mr. Hall had read a sensational account from the South Pacific about a woman's legendary leap to safety. Captivated by the daring and drama, he incorporated his version of the feat into the dance. Although it once caused him to break an ankle, the jump is also a rite of passage in ''Bagne'' because ''without that leap into the unknown we can't open the doors of the prison,'' he explains.''</p>
        <p>T HE character finds relief in that jump,'' he says. ''As a performer, I find a big relief, too -- that the straps have held. I feel cleansed.''</p>
        <p>In the women's version, the softer character -- Ms. Courtois -- gets to do the jump because Ms. Williams, the tougher one, is afraid of aggravating an old back injury. The change, Ms. Courtois says, has taught her ''a big life lesson.''</p>
        <p>''I discover the thin blue line of fear when I jump,'' she says. ''It's the moment of risk, the moment when your body decides to do it and before your brain takes over and says, 'No, fear is coming to stop you.' That little line is when you jump. Otherwise, it's too late.''</p>
        <p>The Joyce shows are an experiment for PPS Danse because for the first time the male and female casts will alternate. ''Flipping about and changing casts is almost artistic suicide,'' Mr. Hall admits, adding that he's curious about audience reaction, especially to the erotically charged male version, which, he says, has been a hard sell in the United States, unlike Europe and Canada.</p>
        <p>''We believe the piece is universal -- that people need each other,'' Mr. Hall says. ''The difference will be how men and women take on these needs.''</p>
