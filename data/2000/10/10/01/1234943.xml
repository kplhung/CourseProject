        <p>Finding a good brisket can be as tough as getting a good date on short notice. Once it is located, however, the future is more assured with this particular cut of meat than it is with many men. Cooking brisket is always a long-term relationship.</p>
        <p>Perhaps for this reason, brisket -- once a mainstay of everyday cooking -- is now a ritual food. It is the singular constant in any self-respecting Texas or Kansas City barbecue. It is sliced into the Vietnamese New Year's pho, boiled for an Italian bollito misto, corned for St. Patrick's Day and pot-roasted for Rosh Hashana.</p>

        <p>Finding a good brisket can be as tough as getting a good date on short notice. Once it is located, however, the future is more assured with this particular cut of meat than it is with many men. Cooking brisket is always a long-term relationship.</p>
        <p>Perhaps for this reason, brisket -- once a mainstay of everyday cooking -- is now a ritual food. It is the singular constant in any self-respecting Texas or Kansas City barbecue. It is sliced into the Vietnamese New Year's pho, boiled for an Italian bollito misto, corned for St. Patrick's Day and pot-roasted for Rosh Hashana.</p>
        <p>In response to changes in dietary style, a pace of living that defies slow-cooked meals and the shrinking size of American households, most butchers divide the brisket into two pieces and take a buzz-cut approach to trimming the fat.</p>
        <p>The flat, or first cut, tends to be leaner and weighs five to seven pounds. The point, also known as the second cut or breast deckle, tends to be better marbled, containing the deckle point, a rich and extremely tasty top piece. Each half suffers the fat-seeking scalpel. While it can be skimmed, trimmed or drained before serving, a brisket's intrinsic fat is the secret to a toothsome meal. The fat of the whole is essential to either half.</p>
        <p>This is the nature of brisket. The flesh is marbled with fat and striated with connective tissue, or collagen, which melts, and the fibers loosen when brisket is cooked slowly in a low oven or a smoker or when braised in liquid.</p>
        <p>If the meat is constantly moistened by the simultaneous release of fat, it will emerge, recipe or no recipe, heartbreakingly tender. If not, you take your chances. And probably, your chances toward juiciness will be better if you judiciously braise, rather than roast, either a first or second cut.</p>
        <p>Arthur Schwartz, ''the food maven'' of WOR radio in New York, also found that browning a piece of first-cut brisket prior to baking or roasting increases its succulence. His experiments confirmed that a juicy pot roast requires ''a whole brisket, fat and all'' and ''a lot of onions, about half the meat's weight.''</p>
        <p>A brisket rubbed with garlic, seasoned with salt and pepper, placed on a bed of chopped onions, carrots and celery, covered with tin foil and placed in a 350-degree oven for four hours will, in fact, partly braise from the liquid released by the vegetables and the meat and yield a noble pot roast.</p>
        <p>But to my taste, a brisket slowly simmered in beef broth, wine, cider or seasoned water has more complex flavors. Eastern European Jews refer to this as gedempte fleysch, or well-stewed meat, a form known as the traditional cholent.</p>
        <p>The luck of finding a whole brisket leaves some feeling cautious and tradition-bound. Others want to celebrate the find with more adventuresome tastes, taking the fiery barbecue approach to their brisket, marinating the meat in garlic or in the Moroccan style with green olives and turmeric, even deploying Asian soy or fish sauces.</p>
        <p>The flavor of brisket is big enough to flourish under the most pungent seasoning. The central miracle of this meat lies in coaxing its tenderness, reason enough for a ritual, and if nothing more, a reward for biding time.</p>
        <p>Cholent Brisket  1 cup vegetable oil  1 brisket (about 4 pounds)  Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper  2 medium Spanish onions, thinly sliced  1 tablespoon paprika  6 garlic cloves, coarsely chopped  2 tablespoons honey  6 small red bliss potatoes (2 pounds), quartered  3 medium carrots, peeled and cut into 1-inch-thick slices  1 cup dried Jacob's cattle beans or cranberry beans (about 7 ounces), soaked in water 1 hour, drained  1 cup dried green lentils (about 7 ounces), soaked in water 1 hour, drained  1 cup barley  1 pound beef marrowbones, cut by butcher into 1-inch pieces.</p>
        <p>1. Preheat oven to 225 degrees. In a Dutch oven with a tight-fitting lid, over high heat, heat  1/2 cup oil. Season the brisket with salt and pepper. Brown the brisket in the oil on both sides, then transfer to a platter.</p>
        <p>2. Drain the oil from the Dutch oven. Add the remaining  1/2 cup oil and reduce the heat to medium. Add the onions and paprika and cook, stirring, until the onions are brown and soft, about 6 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in the honey. Remove the Dutch oven from the heat.</p>
        <p>3. Place the brisket on the onion-garlic mixture. Surround the brisket with the potatoes, carrots, beans, lentils and barley and place the marrowbones on top. Cover with cold water by 4 inches. Stir in 1 tablespoon salt and 1 teaspoon pepper. Return the Dutch oven to the heat and bring to a boil. Skim off any scum that forms on the surface of the liquid. Cover and place it in the oven. Bake for 8 hours or overnight.</p>
        <p>4. Remove the brisket from the oven. If it seems dry, moisten it with a little water. When ready to serve, reheat, covered, in a 350-degree oven until it is hot. Transfer to a large platter and serve.</p>
        <p>Yield: 10 to 12 servings.</p>
        <p>Brisket in Coffee-Barbecue Sauce</p>
        <p>3/4 cup vegetable oil  1 large Spanish onion, minced  5 cloves garlic, minced  1 teaspoon crushed-red-pepper flakes  1 tablespoon tomato paste  7 tablespoons light-brown sugar  5 cups brewed coffee</p>
        <p>1/2 cup cider vinegar  128-ounce can peeled, chopped tomatoes  Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper  1 brisket (about 4 pounds).</p>
        <p>1. In a medium kettle, heat  1/4 cup of the oil over medium heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring, until soft and golden brown, about 7 minutes. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in the red pepper. Add the tomato paste and cook, stirring frequently, about 1 minute. Stir in the brown sugar. Pour in the coffee, vinegar and tomatoes, bring to a boil, then lower to a simmer. Simmer 10 minutes. Set aside to cool.</p>
        <p>2. Working in small batches, transfer the tomato-coffee mixture to a blender and puree. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Set aside.</p>
        <p>3. Preheat the oven to 275 degrees. Season the brisket with salt and pepper. In a Dutch oven with a tight-fitting lid, heat the remaining  1/2 cup oil. Brown the brisket on both sides. Drain off the oil, leaving the brisket in the Dutch oven. Turn the brisket so that the fat side is facing up and then coat it with the pureed tomato-coffee mixture. Cover the Dutch oven and place it in the oven. Bake for 3 hours, basting frequently.</p>
        <p>4. Remove the lid and bake uncovered until the brisket is glazed and very tender, about an hour and a half more. Remove the brisket and set it aside to rest for 10 minutes, covered with foil, before slicing thinly across the grain.</p>
        <p>Yield: 10 to 12 servings.</p>
        <p>Colonial Bacon-and-Oyster-Stuffed Brisket  20 shucked, minced oysters, liquor reserved  2 tablespoons chopped fresh sage leaves</p>
        <p>1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley</p>
        <p>1/4 teaspoon ground mace</p>
        <p>1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon</p>
        <p>1/2 pound sliced bacon, finely chopped</p>
        <p>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground pepper  1 brisket, about 4 pounds  Kosher salt  All-purpose flour</p>
        <p>1/2 cup vegetable oil  2 cups red wine.</p>
        <p>1. In a bowl, toss together oysters, sage, parsley, mace, cinnamon, bacon and pepper.</p>
        <p>2. With a long, sharp, thin-bladed knife, cut a pocket in the brisket. Make the cut parallel to the cutting board and in the middle of the meat, cutting almost -- but not through -- the sides of the brisket. Sprinkle the brisket generously with salt. Dust it lightly with flour.</p>
        <p>3. Preheat the oven to 275 degrees. In a Dutch oven with a tight-fitted lid, heat the oil over high heat. Brown the brisket on both sides. Transfer the brisket to a plate. Stuff the brisket pocket with the oyster-bacon mixture. Using toothpicks, seal the pocket.</p>
        <p>4. Drain the oil from the Dutch oven. Return the brisket to the Dutch oven, and pour in the red wine and the reserved oyster liquor. Cover the Dutch oven and bake for 2 1/2 hours. Remove the lid and continue baking until the brisket is well browned and very tender, about 1 hour more.</p>
        <p>5. Remove the brisket and transfer it to a plate, reserving the liquid. Cover the brisket with foil and let it rest for 10 minutes. Slice it thinly across the grain, transfer it to a platter, spoon over some of the reserved liquid and serve.</p>
        <p>Yield: 10 to 12 servings.</p>
        <p>Corned Beef  8 cups water  1 1/4 cup kosher salt  1 cup sugar  3 tablespoons pickling spices  14-pound brisket.</p>
        <p>1. In a medium pot, over high heat, combine the water, salt, sugar and the pickling spices. Boil, uncovered, until the sugar and salt are dissolved, about 1 minute. Transfer the liquid to a container large enough for the liquid and the brisket. Refrigerate the container until the liquid is cool.</p>
        <p>2. Place the brisket in the container with the liquid, weighing it down with a heavy object to keep it submerged. Refrigerate the brisket in the liquid for at least 8 days and up to 12 days, turning the brisket each day.</p>
        <p>3. Boil the brisket, covered, with its liquid until tender, about 3 hours. Serve with horseradish sauce (recipe follows).</p>
        <p>Yield: 1 corned beef.</p>
        <p>Horseradish Sauce for Corned Beef or Brisket</p>
        <p>1/2 cup heavy cream  3 tablespoons well-drained prepared horseradish  1 tablespoon finely minced shallot</p>
        <p>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt  Pinch freshly ground black pepper.</p>
        <p>In a small bowl, beat the heavy cream until it just begins to hold soft peaks. (Do not overbeat.) Gently whisk in the horseradish, shallot, salt and pepper. Chill until ready to serve. This sauce goes particularly well with leftover corned beef or brisket.</p>
        <p>Yield: 1 cup.</p>
