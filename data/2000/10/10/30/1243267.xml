        <p>Glen Sather, the Rangers' president and general manager, chose an odd way to send a message to his struggling team.

        <p>Glen Sather, the Rangers' president and general manager, chose an odd way to send a message to his struggling team. From the media capital of the world, Sather decided to use a Canadian reporter as his conduit, one whose newspaper is printed in Edmonton, Alberta, where Sather used to ply his trade.</p>
        <p>After watching the Rangers lose for the sixth time in seven games on Friday, Sather singled out right wing John MacLean in an interview with The Edmonton Sun, saying MacLean's ''giddyap doesn't giddyap anymore.'' He went on to say that the Rangers had players signed to long-term contracts who were not living up to expectations.</p>
        <p>''We've just got to shake things up,'' Sather said last night. ''The attitude here has got to change.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps it was a coincidence, but the Rangers responded as if each player had read Sather's words. With their former coach, Mike Keenan, back at Madison Square Garden, this time as coach of the Boston Bruins, the Rangers turned in their best period of the season in the first and rolled over the Bruins, 5-1, to snap a four-game losing streak over all and a four-game losing streak on Garden ice.</p>
        <p>''We've been trying to challenge ourselves,'' Brian Leetch said. ''We don't need any outside criticism to motivate us.''</p>
        <p>The Rangers (4-6-0-0) scored twice in the first period. Dating from last season, the Rangers had been outscored, 12-0, in the first period of their last nine home games. That was the longest they had gone without a first-period goal since 1942-43, when they went 10 games without one.</p>
        <p>Valery Kamensky and Jan Hlavac scored their fourth goals of the season, putting the Rangers ahead, 2-0, by the end of the first. Kamensky's came from the right circle off a Mark Messier feed at 10 minutes 6 seconds. Hlavac's came on the power play at the end of a nifty tick-tack-toe with Brian Leetch and Radek Dvorak. Theo Fleury, demoted to the fourth line, scored his sixth goal of the season and the Rangers' first short-handed goal this season, at 3:16 of the second period.</p>
        <p>Then Kamensky set up Messier on the power play 40 seconds into the final period, giving him five goals on the season (all on the power play). Messier scored at 10:01 on a trademark wrong-foot wrist shot to make it 5-0.</p>
        <p>Mike Richter did the rest, stopping 31 of 32 shots. Jason Allison scored for Boston (4-5-1-1) on a power play with 3:15 remaining. And the Rangers left the Garden on a high note for the first time since their home opener on Oct. 11. They had not won since Oct. 19.</p>
