        <p>Bloomberg, the financial information company, will announce that its New York City radio station, WBBR-AM (1130), will shift its format today from business to general news, company officials said.</p>
        <p>The change means that WBBR will incorporate more local, national and international news into its programming, placing the station more directly in competition with the city's two other AM all-news stations, WCBS-AM (880) and 1010 WINS. With the largest reporting staff of any news radio station in New York, WBBR has the potential to be a strong competitor for WCBS and WINS, both owned by Viacom's CBS/ Infinity Broadcasting, analysts said.</p>

        <p>Bloomberg, the financial information company, will announce that its New York City radio station, WBBR-AM (1130), will shift its format today from business to general news, company officials said.</p>
        <p>The change means that WBBR will incorporate more local, national and international news into its programming, placing the station more directly in competition with the city's two other AM all-news stations, WCBS-AM (880) and 1010 WINS. With the largest reporting staff of any news radio station in New York, WBBR has the potential to be a strong competitor for WCBS and WINS, both owned by Viacom's CBS/ Infinity Broadcasting, analysts said.</p>
        <p>In general, it is difficult for a third station of the same format -- especially the expensive all-news format -- to survive in one radio market, the analysts said. But WBBR already has a news staff and loyal listeners.</p>
        <p>The move is in part an attempt to expand WBBR's audience. The station does not rank among the Top 25 stations in New York; WINS ranks No. 8, and WCBS is No. 13, according to the latest annual figures from the Arbitron Company, the ratings organization. Arbitron does not rank stations below No. 25.</p>
        <p>In last few months, WBBR has added general news programming and hired several reporters away from other stations. Douglas Krizner, the station manager, said Bloomberg hopes to broaden its base, but at the same time ''remain true to our roots.''</p>
        <p>Bloomberg started as a market information service for companies in 1981 by Michael R. Bloomberg, the company's president and principal owner. In recent months, Mr. Bloomberg, a former bond trader, has flirted with the possibility of running for mayor in 2001.</p>
        <p>WBBR operates from its studio at Bloomberg's headquarters at 499 Park Avenue in Midtown. The studio is fully digital, which means that Bloomberg's radio staff do not have to deal with tapes, but instead can file all their stories into computerized devices. This reduces the cost of running the news operation and cuts the time it takes to get programming on the air.</p>
        <p>A few weeks ago, WCBS said it would move to a fully digital studio.</p>
