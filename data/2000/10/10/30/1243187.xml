        <p>The ABC News anchor Peter Jennings is moonlighting again as an author. But this time ABC's parent, the Walt Disney Company, is keeping the book at its Hyperion publishing division, to the envy of Mr. Jennings's previous publisher.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jennings and his co-author, Todd Brewster, are following up their best-selling book ''The Century,'' which was tied to an ABC miniseries, with another book and series under the even more ambitious title, ''America.''</p>
        <p>In a statement, Mr. Jennings said he would be taking on the weighty questions de Tocqueville raised more than 160 years ago.</p>
        <p>''Just what is America? And who are the people who call themselves 'Americans'?'' he said. The book is scheduled for publication in September 2002, when ABC's television series will run.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Jennings's contract to publish with Hyperion has rankled his former publishers at the Doubleday imprint of Bertelsmann's Random House unit, who said they never had a chance at the book deal.</p>
        <p>For ''The Century,'' Doubleday paid ABC an advance of about $2 million. ABC signed the contract as the author in the deal and paid some of the advance and royalties to Mr. Jennings, according to people involved in the arrangement. Publicity came easy.</p>
        <p>''It was the fastest-selling $60 book ever published,'' said Stephen Rubin, Doubleday's publisher. It eventually sold more than 1.6 million copies.</p>
        <p>But that deal was signed about a decade ago, before Disney created its Hyperion book unit and bought ABC. This time around, Mr. Jennings and Mr. Brewster signed the book contract themselves -- to ensure their interest was represented in dealing with another Disney division. Their agent, Esther Newberg negotiated another sizable advance for the authors. But publishers at other houses say that, at Disney's behest, she never gave anyone else the chance to publish it.</p>
        <p>''My good friends at Hyperion should be thanking the gods of synergy every night before they go to sleep,'' said Doubleday's Mr. Rubin.</p>
        <p>Robert Miller, the managing director of Hyperion, said he did not know if the book had been offered elsewhere. ''I just know that we wanted to publish the book as soon as we heard about it and we pursued it passionately,'' he said. ''The ability to work with ABC just added to the benefit.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Jennings was unavailable for comment on the terms of his deal.</p>
