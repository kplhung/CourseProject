        <p>JUST minutes after the Senate debate on WNBC-TV last Friday, an assortment of political advisers, pollsters and politicians appeared, like puddles after a rain, in the large studio that is ordinarily the home of -- why did this seem so appropriate? -- ''Saturday Night Live.''</p>
        <p>Standing at lecterns on opposite ends of the room, they proceeded to tell about 100 reporters and photographers and 15 television cameras why their candidate won the testy exchange that everyone had just seen, sharing such edifying observations as Hillary Rodham Clinton ''is a woman of gravitas'' (Raymond B. Harding, the Liberal Party chairman) and Representative Rick A. Lazio ''has a record of fighting for the people of New York State'' (Lt. Gov. Mary O. Donohue).</p>
        <p>Welcome to the parallel world of political spin. Nothing has more influence over American politics than the latest incarnations of political propaganda, from television ads and an e-explosion to the spectacle of otherwise intelligent people turning themselves into political sales clerks.</p>
        <p>The spin machines go into high gear whether reacting to staged events like debates or to breaking news, like this weekend's revelations that New York's Republican Party was trying to link Mrs. Clinton to the suicide bombing Oct. 12 of the destroyer Cole because she raised money from an American Muslim group. The Clinton campaign churned out reaction to both with equally professional dispatch.</p>
        <p>It's not that there is anything new about propaganda machines. But technology is more sophisticated today, negative research is much easier with the Internet, and an enormous audience is potentially just a click away.</p>
        <p>Dan McLagan, a spokesman for Mr. Lazio, says each e-mail message from the  campaign goes to 600 reporters and editors. Mrs. Clinton's spokesman, Howard Wolfson, puts his e-mailing list in the hundreds. And e-mail messages are more insistent than letters or faxes.</p>
        <p>On the other side of the equation are the insatiable news media. Space and air time to fill; 24-hour news cycles. Journalistic standards that are often in inverse proportion to the intensity of the competition. Nothing much argues for restraint on the part of campaigns.</p>
        <p>So: during Friday's taping at WNBC, 11 ''real time responses'' from Lazio 2000 and 12 ''reality checks'' from Clinton 2000 popped into e-mail queues, rearguing and clarifying points made during Gabe Pressman's debate. Sometimes these e-mailed press releases contain useful information, but mostly they are as skewed as political ads and as reliable as snap polls.</p>
        <p>And sometimes they amount to cyberabuse. One day last week, 13 Lazio e-mail  messages tumbled into journalistic computers one after another, deploring the failed Clinton health care plan in identical language, except for a closing paragraph listing hospitals in different areas.</p>
        <p>We reporters tend to consider the First Amendment sacrosanct, making it bad form to argue against an offer of information. But sometimes less really is more.</p>
        <p>YES, we did learn after one Senate debate that Gov. George E. Pataki was proudly ignorant of E. B. White. But Mr. Pataki is not running for Senate. Neither are any of the other postdebate spin doctors.</p>
        <p>The same for Edward I. Koch, Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts and Thomas J. Manton of Queens, three Democrats who, at the request of the Clinton campaign, denounced the Republicans for all but accusing Mrs. Clinton of encouraging the attack on the Cole. Surrogates can help, especially one like Mr. Koch, who has credibility with many Jewish voters. But Mrs. Clinton, who spoke most ably for herself, is the candidate.</p>
        <p>Which brings us back to the spin room routine. It really is ragged, and often comic, featuring consultants and politicians who, judging from C-Span's coverage of this season's presidential and vice-presidential debates, are either transparently partisan or clueless. ''They are institutions, but empty,'' said George Stephanopoulos of ABC, the former Clinton adviser.</p>
        <p>The attempted manipulation makes all but lazy reporters squirm, but most go along, fearful of missing something. The spinners are frequently embarrassed, even the campaigns denounce the tradition.  ''I'm only there because you're there,'' said Mr. Wolfson.'' Mr. McLagan, the Lazio spokesman, agreed, saying, ''We do it to keep you happy.''</p>
        <p>Nobody has much regard for it. But they do it anyway because sometimes somebody gets something out of it. Did we say welcome to the parallel world of political spin? You can erase ''parallel.''</p>
