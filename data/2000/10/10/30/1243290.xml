        <p>The Mets have begun negotiations with Manager Bobby Valentine on a new contract, Valentine's agent, Tony Attanasio, said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Attanasio spoke with Mets General Manager Steve Phillips over the weekend, and the sides exchanged ''proposals and counterproposals,'' the agent said. The negotiating is a sign that a new deal for Phillips -- whose contract expires in December -- is all but official.</p>
        <p>The Mets want to sign Valentine before he can be pursued by other teams after his contract expires on Tuesday; Phillips will not permit other clubs to speak to Valentine until then. The Mets would not discuss a contract extension after last season, as Valentine wished, but this weekend's talks are a cause for optimism, Attanasio said.</p>
        <p>It's like a family fight -- if you don't talk, you can't get anything resolved, Attanasio said. But if we're talking, there's a pretty good chance of getting something done.</p>
