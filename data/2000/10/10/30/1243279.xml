        <p>WHAT'S IN A TURNOVER? THE GOOD . . .  Last season Notre Dame fumbled 25 times, lost 15, and finished the season 5-7.

        <p>Highlights and lowlights from the weekend.</p>
        <p>JOE DRAPE</p>
        <p>WHAT'S IN A TURNOVER? THE GOOD . . .  Last season Notre Dame fumbled 25 times, lost 15, and finished the season 5-7. This year the Irish have fumbled five times and lost one for the first time on Saturday against Air Force. The Irish have the fewest turnovers in the nation, 5, and have a 6-2 record.</p>
        <p>. . . AND THE BAD  Southern California, once ranked as high as No. 8, has lost five straight after California defeated the Trojans, 28-16. Why? U.S.C. has turned the ball over 22 times and is the 106th-ranked team in give-aways.</p>
        <p>LITTLE THINGS THAT ADD UP TO UNDEFEATED</p>
        <p>Virginia Tech leads the nation in punt returning with an 18.23-yard average, as well as interceptions, 19.</p>
        <p>Texas Christian is the best kickoff return team in the country, averaging 29.78 yards a return.</p>
        <p>Oklahoma is fifth in the nation in turnover margin, 1.57; and seventh in net punting.</p>
        <p>IN THE RECORD BOOKS</p>
        <p>Joey Harrington threw for 434 yards and tied a school record with six touchdown passes as No. 7 Oregon beat Arizona State, 56-55, in double overtime.</p>
        <p>Oregon State's Ken Simonton became the first running back in Pacific-10 history to gain at least 1,000 yards as a freshman, a sophomore and a junior. He set the mark against Washington State on a career-long 53-yard run on his second carry in the first quarter. It gave him 1,049 yards for the season.</p>
        <p>Drake rolled up a school-record 734 yards of total offense, beating Butler, 62-41. Drake broke the school and Pioneer Football League records of 671 yards, which it set against Aurora in 1993.</p>
        <p>Marvin Royal ran for a school-record 302 yards and four touchdowns in Sacred Heart's 46-7 victory over Iona.</p>
        <p>Jamar Fletcher had his fifth interception of the year to set up Michael Bennett's go-ahead touchdown run as Wisconsin beat Iowa, 13-7. Fletcher has 19 career interceptions, breaking the school record of 18.</p>
        <p>IT HURTS TO BE GREAT  ''It really hasn't hit me yet, but I'm sure that on the ride home, I'll say to myself, 'I'm the nation's all-time leading rusher.' But I won't pinch myself because I'm too beat up for that.'' -- Grove City's R.J. Bowers, 26, after setting the N.C.A.A. all-division career rushing record. His 128 yards in a victory over Bethany brought his career total to 6,999 yards.</p>
        <p>'BAMA BLUES  ''People don't know football. They haven't played a down of football. -- Alabama quarterback Andrew Zow of the Crimson Tide fans who booed him during a 40-28 loss to Central Florida.</p>
