        <p>A  few years ago I had a job teaching creative writing at a Houston elementary school. One day my best writer -- a quiet boy in fourth grade who produced astonishingly vivid, imaginative stories -- failed to appear in class. His classroom teacher told me his family, beset with financial problems, had moved yet again, perhaps to another motel room. And she sighed, ''I was counting on him for my TAAS scores.''</p>
        <p>Seemingly insensitive, her comment merely pointed up what teachers, administrators and parents in Texas have long known: that results on the TAAS, or the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills test, are all important. As the presidential race grows tighter, this statewide standardized test, given yearly to public school children from third grade through high school, has achieved notoriety as well. A study released last week by the RAND Corporation, a nonprofit research group, claims that while Texas schoolchildren, particularly those from minority groups, have posted dramatic increases on their state test scores during George W. Bush's tenure as governor, their gains on a leading national exam have been less impressive. The rise in state scores,  researchers speculated, might reflect the practice of ''teaching to the test,'' that is, drilling children on  questions typical of those on the exam.</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman for Mr. Bush, who has campaigned on his education record, dismissed the RAND results as ''dead wrong.'' Al Gore seized on the study gleefully, denouncing ''illusory test scores that might elevate the reputations of politicians.''</p>
        <p>As a parent who has seen the state tests close up, I think the RAND researchers have a point. Several points, in fact. First, nobody here denies that schools prep children heavily for the exam. At my daughter's elementary school, a committee I served on briefly was supposed to review the curriculum. Its true purpose was to identify children at risk for failing the test and devise strategies for raising their scores. Why the children were having problems, and what else might be done to help them, weren't matters for discussion.</p>
        <p>The RAND study also implies that an extremely narrow academic focus may squeeze out other learning experiences -- perhaps the kind that elevate children's scores on national tests. At a well-regarded middle school, parents complained bitterly after teachers gathered up textbooks and proceeded to drill students on the state tests for weeks. Preparation included quizzing children on how to approach each question -- one step was ''take a deep breath.''</p>
        <p>Finally, the RAND report raises questions about what a ''passing'' score on the state test actually means. The state defines passing as ''meeting minimal expectations.'' The word ''minimal'' may well explain why, in my district, some schools have apparently contradictory results: a high percentage of their students pass the state test while these same students score below average on the Stanford achievement tests, exams used nationwide.</p>
        <p>Unlike Al Gore, though, I'm not ready to declare that Texas schools aren't making progress. RAND itself released a study in July claiming that Texas students rank high nationally, especially in math. Could it be that relying on a single study, like relying on a single standardized test, doesn't give a complete picture of children's educational achievement?</p>
        <p>As it is, an excessive dependence on standardized tests -- summed up in the catch phrase ''accountability'' -- could undermine the concept of local control of the schools, a sacred tenet of both candidates in this race. When much of a school's curriculum and many of its activities are determined by a statewide, uniform test, who's actually in control? Not the principal, teachers or parents, but the government, whether in Washington or Austin, that decreed the test in the first place.</p>
