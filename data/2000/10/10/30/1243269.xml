        <p>Vice President Al Gore portrayed the presidential election today as a chance for people to reject special interests, while his wife and running mate pronounced Gov. George W. Bush too inexperienced to be president.</p>
        <p>Those two themes dominated the day as Mr. Gore scoured for votes throughout Michigan on a bus tour that had him speaking before black churchgoers in the morning, Reagan Democrats in the afternoon and a throng of about 15,000 supporters this working class city in Western Michigan.</p>
        <p>''You have the power,'' Mr. Gore said at an afternoon rally in East Lansing. ''You have the opportunity, because on that one day every four years, the special interests tremble at the thought that you will penetrate the smoke screen, that you'll see through the efforts to fool you, that you'll ignore the clever, the cleverly designed TV commercials.''</p>
        <p>But instead, he predicted, ''You will vote what's right for your family and for your future and for the loved ones that are depending upon your right as an American citizen to cast in the right way.''</p>
        <p>By contrast, Mr. Bush was off the campaign trail today. He spoke by satellite from his home in Austin, Tex., to a group of Hispanic Republicans in California. His aides, meanwhile, outlined what they called the largest ever Republican grass-roots effort to get out the vote. [Page A15.]</p>
        <p>While Mr. Gore was emphasizing what he wants to do as president, his campaign was trying to sow doubts about how Mr. Bush would perform in the job.</p>
        <p>Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, Mr. Gore's running mate, made the round of Sunday talk programs to voice this emerging campaign theme, and Tipper Gore declared it to a few thousand people at a rally in Warren, Mich.</p>
        <p>''It's not 'The Dating Game,' '' Mrs. Gore said, perhaps tacitly ceding the edge in likability to Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>''You don't have to fall in love with Al Gore -- I did that,'' Mrs. Gore said. ''What you need to do is figure out who you're going to vote for for president, and I know that you are going to weigh experience. That's important.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman used forceful if less personal language this morning.</p>
        <p>''I don't think Governor Bush is ready -- based on his experience, his record, his proposals in this campaign -- to be the kind of president that the American people need at this point in our history,'' Mr. Lieberman said on the ABC News program ''This Week.''</p>
        <p>''His proposals way overspend the projected surplus,'' Mr. Lieberman said. ''They take us back into deficits, raise interest rates, drop the stock market, raise unemployment.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore did not talk about his opponent's qualifications, sticking to his vow not to personally attack Mr. Bush. But he did assail Mr. Bush's record and proposals, delivering sermons laced with lines from his stump speech at two black churches in Detroit.</p>
        <p>Describing Mr. Bush's tax-cut plan, he warned a church congregation that if Americans ''put our trust in that disproven, discredited, failed theory that says give it to those at the very top and ultimately it will work its way down, we tried that. Been there, done that, still paying the bill.''</p>
        <p>As his campaign caravan cut through Michigan today, Mr. Gore pleaded for votes at every stop, portraying Mr. Bush as a captive of special interests like drug companies, the oil industry and the managed-care industry, and telling voters that Election Day was their chance to strike back.</p>
        <p>''This country belongs to you, and I want to give it back to you,'' Mr. Gore shouted at the rally in Muskegon on the first day of a two-day bus caravan in Michigan and Wisconsin.  ''And if you elect me on Nov. 7, I will give it back to you.''</p>
        <p>Casting his 24 years in political office as those of a crusader against the ''special interests,'' Mr. Gore added, ''I know where the rats in the barn are, and you know what, the rats in the barn know that I know, and that's why they're coming out trying to stop us.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's day began with a private meeting with two dozen representatives of Arab-Americans, who make up an important voting bloc in this state, and after the meeting, six endorsed him.</p>
        <p>James Zogby, president of the Arab-American Institute and chairman of the Arab-American Democratic Leadership Council, said that about 20 Arab community leaders would endorse Mr. Gore on Wednesday when he returned to Michigan.</p>
        <p>''It was a very good discussion,'' Mr. Zogby said. ''He asked for frankness, and people gave him frankness.''</p>
        <p>Some Arab groups have been concerned that Mr. Gore's selection of Mr. Lieberman as his running mate would make him biased in favor of Israel.</p>
        <p>''He made it very clear that he was a friend of Israel,'' Mr. Zogby said. ''But he said, 'Look, I'm also a friend of Egypt, I've worked to promote job development in the West Bank,' '' a reference to Mr. Gore's having been a sponsor of a group called Builders for Peace, which is an Arab-American and Jewish-American alliance to promote investment in the West Bank.</p>
        <p>''It was a group that wants him to be evenhanded and establish ties on both sides,'' Mr. Zogby said, ''and they went away convinced that he's done that for the last seven years.''</p>
        <p>At the church services, Mr. Gore talked stump and Scripture as he sought to inspire the congregants to go to the polls for him.</p>
        <p>''Paul wrote twice, to the Galatians and Second Thessalonians, 'Do not grow weary in well doing.' We have done well in the last eight years,'' Mr. Gore said from the pulpit at the Hartford Memorial Baptist Church. Continuing to quote, he said: ''But in due season we shall reap if we faint not.''</p>
        <p>Then, switching to his stump speech, he blurted out: ''You ain't seen nothing yet.''</p>
        <p>He found a new way to illustrate Mr. Bush's tax cut: ''My opponent proposes to spend more money on tax benefits to the wealthiest 90,000 multimillionaires than all his proposals to spend money on 90,000 public schools all across the United States of America.''</p>
        <p>And he boiled down his criticism of the governor's prescription-drug plan to this: ''The only thing you need to know about the proposal my opponent has made is that the big pharmaceutical companies support it.''</p>
        <p>Describing the problems that some older people have in paying for their medications, he added: ''Those seniors are choosing between skipping pills and skipping meals. They're choosing between this medication and the other one. And it is wrong. The big drug companies are deeply involved in this election. They've supported not only my opponent's proposal, but supported him massively.''</p>
        <p>He raised the audience to its feet by declaring: ''You have the ability to make a difference. This state has the ability to decide this close election. You have the ability to decide what this state decides.''</p>
        <p>With his hands stretched out, the vice president implored the crowd, ''Don't sit down, because I don't want you to have to get right back up again.''</p>
        <p>In the spring, Mr. Gore contended  that Mr. Bush lacked the experience to be president, but he has not made that argument for months, presumably for fear of being seen as breaking his vow not to personally attack the governor.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore has even gone to some lengths to tell reporters that he is not making that argument. In a late-night flight on Saturday from Minneapolis to Romulus, Mich., Mr. Gore was asked about an editorial in The New York Times, which in endorsing Mr. Gore said that Mr. Bush was too inexperienced for the job.</p>
        <p>Asked if he believed that, the vice president responded, ''I haven't said that I believe it, because I don't think it's my place to say that I believe it.''</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, Tad Devine, a top Gore strategist, said the campaign intended to capitalize on the ''tremendous sense of unease'' that voters feel about Mr. Bush's lack of experience.</p>
        <p>''In many ways, Governor Bush is not up to the job of being president,'' Mr. Devine said, adding that while Mr. Gore's positions on issues would be the central argument for the vice president's election, the campaign would make the lack of experience the central issue against Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>Mr. Devine also said that Mr. Gore would be linking Mr. Bush more directly with Congressional Republicans, an argument Mr. Gore began to make on Saturday in an address in Pennsylvania when he said a health care bill provided millions for health maintenance organizations but did not include patient protections.</p>
        <p>''He will be tied in with the Republicans in Congress,'' Mr. Devine said. ''This is why he's having difficulty in Florida, after the Republican takeover, and it's why Gore is ahead there -- there's a perception that the Republicans in Washington have done some very bad things for programs that people rely on. This could be very damaging to Bush.''</p>
        <p>In His Own Words  AL GORE</p>
        <p>Remarks yesterday at a rally in Macomb, Mich.:</p>
        <p>''The Supreme Court is at stake. There are going to be three, maybe four -- somebody wrote this morning, maybe even five -- justices of the Supreme Court appointed by the next president of the United States. That means a majority on the court that will interpret our rights under the Constitution for the next 30 to 40 years. These young children here will have children of their own that will live under the interpretations of our Constitution determined by the election nine days from now. Think about it.</p>
        <p>We want the Americans with disabilities to have rights in this country to participate in the mainstream. There is a 5-to-4 decision now pending in the Supreme Court that will be revisited by the next court that will determine whether or not the Americans With Disabilities Act survives or not.</p>
        <p>Think about civil rights. Think about women's rights. Think about human rights. Think about antitrust law. Think about Federalism. All of these issues are on the ballot this Nov. 7.''</p>
