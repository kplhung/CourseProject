        <p>From the Crypt  Many a goblin will roam tomorrow, but no creature will be so eerie as the vampire to be loosed at the Walter Reade Theater at Lincoln Center. F. W. Murnau's ''Nosferatu'' (1921), to be shown at 4, 7 and 9:30 p.m., is the earliest screen version of Bram Stoker's ''Dracula.'' The newly restored print is tinted as it would have been in the 1920's, has hand-calligraphed English intertitles and will be accompanied by a new score played by the Alloy Orchestra. Information: (212) 875-5610.</p>
        <p>On a Grand Scale  Not content with being Sterling Professor of Humanities at Yale, Berg Professor of English at New York University and a former professor at Harvard, as well as the author of more than 20 books, Harold Bloom is taking on a new role. In his debut as an actor, he will appear with members of the American Repertory Theater at 7:30 tonight at the Hasty Pudding Theater in Cambridge, Mass., leading a reading titled ''The Falstaffiad.'' This celebration of Shakespeare's Falstaff incorporates all of that corpulent knight's speeches and extends to his death. At evening's end Professor Bloom will deliver a brief prose epilogue in the spirit of Shakespeare. Information: (617) 547-8300.</p>

        <p>Royal Art  On loan from Queen Elizabeth II come the 66 drawings that go on view tomorrow at the Getty Museum in Los Angeles. Assembled from the collection of old master drawings and watercolors in the royal library, the show focuses on the short, brilliant career of Raphael, who was born in 1483 and died at 37. ''Raphael and His Circle: Drawings From Windsor Castle'' continues through Jan. 7. Information: (310) 440-7300.</p>
        <p>Tiny Tales  In the 19th century, thanks to advances in printing technology, toy theater became a popular means of staging miniature dramatic spectacles using cutout characters. From Thursday through Nov. 19, practitioners of this art form from the United States, Europe and Latin America will stage everything from an updated ''Antigone'' to ''Peter Pan.'' The Fifth International Toy Theater Festival takes place at Here, 145 Avenue of the Americas, at Dominick Street, South Village. Information: (212) 647-0202.</p>
