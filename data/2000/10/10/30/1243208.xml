        <p>DEAR DIARY:</p>
        <p>My husband and I were headed to work. We parked in front of City Market on Broadway so he could run in and get our morning coffees. We were illegally parked so I stayed in the car. As I gazed out the windshield, the silent movie unfolded:</p>
        <p>A woman carrying a small child and trying to hold on to her stroller was trying to hail a cab in the pouring rain. A passer-by held his umbrella over her to keep her and the child dry. There was no car in sight and after a time, the man passed his umbrella to her and seemed to be saying that he was going off to see if he could find a cab at the next corner. He returned -- still no cab -- signaled her to keep the umbrella and went off. Finally a cab appeared and as the woman was trying to maneuver the child and umbrella into the car, the stroller started rolling away. It was quickly retrieved by another passer-by. The woman loaded her gear and child into the cab and they took off. My husband returned with our coffees and we rode off.</p>

        <p>DEAR DIARY:</p>
        <p>My husband and I were headed to work. We parked in front of City Market on Broadway so he could run in and get our morning coffees. We were illegally parked so I stayed in the car. As I gazed out the windshield, the silent movie unfolded:</p>
        <p>A woman carrying a small child and trying to hold on to her stroller was trying to hail a cab in the pouring rain. A passer-by held his umbrella over her to keep her and the child dry. There was no car in sight and after a time, the man passed his umbrella to her and seemed to be saying that he was going off to see if he could find a cab at the next corner. He returned -- still no cab -- signaled her to keep the umbrella and went off. Finally a cab appeared and as the woman was trying to maneuver the child and umbrella into the car, the stroller started rolling away. It was quickly retrieved by another passer-by. The woman loaded her gear and child into the cab and they took off. My husband returned with our coffees and we rode off.</p>
        <p>I was feeling very good, pleased by the people who had helped the harried woman. But I also questioned why I hadn't!</p>

        <p>The coat I want is dark in color but light in spirit</p>
        <p>It fits like an old glove but leaves me room to grow</p>
        <p>It says I read The Nation and the Eddie Bauer catalog</p>
        <p>That I shop at Saks but know a good value</p>
        <p>That I have it all together</p>
        <p>And that nothing ever rains on my parade.</p>
        <p>It comes with a white horse and a fairy godmother.</p>
        <p>It also has a pocket for Hershey kisses,</p>
        <p>In case the horse is late</p>
        <p>Or the fairy godmother stops at the mall.</p>

        <p>Mildred Cohen is one of the many who question what she calls the ''ubiquitous, automatic, meaningless expression 'Have a nice day,' '' and the usual response, ''You too.''</p>
        <p>She can't do anything about the exhortation but she's taken another tack in her reply. ''How?'' she asks. This almost always elicits a look of confusion, so she amplifies her reply. ''How shall I have a nice day?'' she asks.</p>
        <p>A few of her replies to date:</p>
        <p>''Curl up with a good book.''</p>
        <p>''Go sit in the sunshine.''</p>
        <p>''Go crabbing.''</p>
        <p>The one almost universal response -- a smile.</p>
        <p>Phyllis Canter reports that Kyle Canter, her 6-year-old grandson, was watching his parents dress for a formal dinner. ''What's that?'' he asked as his father put on one item. ''It's called a cummerbund -- it's like a sash,'' his father replied. ''What's it for?'' Kyle asked. ''It sort of keeps the shirt down, the pants up and the stomach in,'' Dad explained. Kyle obviously hadn't reached the age of diplomacy. ''It's not working,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Dear Diary:</p>
        <p>Retirees, former Manhattanites now living in Florida, we come to New York in the summer to absorb all that the city has to offer. We call it ''getting our batteries recharged.'' One hot day we boarded a bus in SoHo that made only limited stops. We were on our way uptown to meet friends for dinner and the theater and were afraid we might not make it ion time.</p>
        <p>At 42nd Street, we inched our way toward the front, to get off at the next authorized stop. At 46th Street, not a limited stop, we waited for a red light to change. We were close to the curb and to our destination, so I asked the driver if he would let us off. He ignored the request. I leaned closer and asked, ''Would you let your grandparents walk five extra blocks in this heat?''</p>
        <p>Like the Red Sea parting, the doors opened. We hopped off, then waved our thanks to the driver. He stared straight ahead, denying any complicity in the near miracle that had occurred.</p>
        <p>MORTY BASS</p>
        <p>A woman who doesn't wish her name used was awakened by the telephone at 3:30 a.m. recently. The caller identified himself as chief of security for her telephone company, told her that someone was charging her number with calls to the West Indies, Spain and other destinations and asked for her PIN. Despite the hour, she was sufficiently awake to reply that he should already know the number and should be calling during regular business hours. At this, he warned that unless he got the requested information, he would cut off her service for 24 hours. ''Cut off my service because someone else is charging calls to my account?'' she exclaimed, then asked if she could call him back. Not surprisingly, he said no, and she hung up. Almost immediately the phone rang again. The man said he'd give her one more chance. ''Nope,'' she replied. ''Cut me off.'' She hung up again. She tried the line -- dead. Another try -- dead. A third try -- the line was back. She drifted back to sleep, imagining the man running his finger down the white pages, hoping to prey upon some other sleep-deprived New Yorker.</p>
        <p>NEW AGE SERVICE</p>
        <p>''There's unusually heavy volume'' on their reservation line.</p>
        <p>They know my time's important -- at least it's on their dime.</p>
        <p>I've pressed the numbers one by one (thank God there's only nine)</p>
        <p>Now I've been on hold forever -- to upbeat corporate whine.</p>
        <p>I've paid some bills, done my nails and cleaned this desk of mine</p>
        <p>If someone doesn't come on soon, I'll have to take to wine.</p>
        <p>By the time they finally answer, I've forgotten why I called</p>
        <p>This style of customer service leaves this old gal appalled.</p>

        <p>Stanley Perlman was at a movie when a young woman in front of him punched in a number on her cell phone and began speaking loudly enough to be heard by her neighbors. She was calling a friend who was apparently at the snack stand. ''Don't get too much butter on the popcorn,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Monday morning. A crowded crosstown bus, stopped for traffic. The wait, according to Hedy B. Lipschitz, made considerably more pleasant by the driver's announcement:</p>
        <p>''Your safety is my main concern. Presently, I'm waiting for the red light to change so I can continue safely on my way. I hope this doesn't cause you to be late. Just remember, if you have any troubles, don't take them with you to work, school or home. Leave your troubles on the bus and I will dump them out in the East River.''</p>
