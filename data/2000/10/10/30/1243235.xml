        <p>If you wanted to start a new life, free of reproach or inquiry, this remote prairie town of 35,500 might be the place. Its open wheat fields, quiet ways and uncritical embrace of strangers drew two such outsiders here in 1996, a doctor couple from New York and California who had both practiced medicine in Las Vegas.</p>
        <p>Dr. Robert Bierenbaum, then 39, an intense New Yorker with piercing eyes and an in-your-face manner, seemed misplaced amid the brawny and laconic citizenry. But his exotic skills and civic spirit soon won over the town: he published a bagel recipe in the local newspaper, read Hebrew amid the 20-some congregants of the tiny clapboard synagogue, even flew members of the Rotary Club to Mexico in his twin-engine Comanche to give free medical care to orphans.</p>
        <p>''At first it was just, 'That guy is nothing but strange,' '' said Curt Hussey, operator of the town's private flight school at Pietsch's airfield. ''But he was just like, 'Anything to do to help.' ''</p>
        <p>Before long, Dr. Bierenbaum, a plastic surgeon, and his wife, Dr. Janet Chollet, an obstetrician-gynecologist, had settled in to medical practices, pitched in on community projects, had a home, a dog and a baby on the way.</p>
        <p>Few questioned Dr. Bob, as they called him, who was convicted last week of murdering his first wife. In a state that averages two people per square mile, it is more important to embrace newcomers than to fuss with details about the past.  ''We're from North Dakota and we trust people,'' said Mike Berg, a retired pharmacist and former head of the Rotary Club, who flew to Mexico with Dr. Bob.  Mr. Berg recalls it as the most remarkable experience of his life, one that ''fulfills a person's reason for being here.''</p>
        <p>As Dr. Bierenbaum's social efforts overcame the reserve of his new neighbors, his old neighbors were busy digging up his past. Manhattan investigators were exhuming a woman's torso from a Queens cemetery and running DNA tests to determine whether it was that of his first wife, Gail Katz-Bierenbaum, who had disappeared in 1985. The torso had washed up in Staten Island four years after her disappearance, and the limbs appeared to have been severed, perhaps by a skillful surgeon.</p>
        <p>Throughout the search for Gail Katz-Bierenbaum, her family said they found her husband decidedly unhelpful. He had blocked the police from searching their Manhattan apartment. And when detectives grilled him about what he did on July 7, 1985, the day his wife disappeared, he never mentioned his two-hour solo flight in a Cessna over the Atlantic Ocean.  ''Murderer'' is the word Ms. Katz-Bierenbaum's sister, Alayne Katz, consistently used to describe him.</p>
        <p>The torso was ruled out as belonging to Ms. Katz-Bierenbaum, whose remains have never been found.</p>
        <p>But last week, a Manhattan jury found Dr. Bierenbaum guilty of killing his first wife and dumping her body from an airplane. He faces 25 years to life and is to be sentenced on Nov. 20. The conviction leaves the people of Minot with a question. How well do you ever know anybody?</p>
        <p>''I have no idea what you've done in the past, you have no idea what I've done,'' Mr. Hussey concluded last week, after the verdict, seated in a restaurant near Minot International Airport, which has one baggage carousel. ''We worry about today and tomorrow here, not last week.''</p>
        <p>With bitter winters and little company, residents here have little use for moral condemnation. In the late 1800's, the railroad lured transients to the town's many brothels and saloons. In the 1920's, whiskey traffickers lived among the Lutheran churches and businesses. Today, local rumor has it, the federal witness protection program relocates people here. In short, Minot has always been a good place to reinvent oneself or to hide.</p>
        <p>Though the five-block downtown area boasts a jail, a courthouse and two competing hospitals, Minot (pronounced MY-not) has a desperate  need for people and talent.</p>
        <p>Local doctors here studied the demographics, and did not think a plastic surgeon would arrive until at least 2005. Who would come willingly to a place where many professionals -- particularly doctors who draw patients from the surrounding 100,000 square miles -- must fly single-engine planes to work?</p>
        <p>''Most people don't know that Minot, North Dakota, is on the face of the map, so why come here?'' asked Stephanie, a bookkeeper in town who was treated by Dr. Bob and who asked that her last name not be used.  Dr. Bierenbaum told locals that he loved his new town for being free of traffic and crime.</p>
        <p>''Helpful'' is the word most people use here to describe Dr. Bierenbaum, a man who fixed his colleagues' computers and brought his neighbors chicken soup.</p>
        <p>One recent morning at Pietsch's airfield, where Dr. Bierenbaum spent hours tinkering with his plane and teaching flight safety for the Federal Aviation Administration, mechanics and pilots grounded by fog were eating apple pie. ''He brought us all little vials of grease'' for airplane parts, said Chris Grima, a mechanic whose wife made the pie.</p>
        <p>People here were on their guard at first because he dressed differently, had longer hair and a ''weird intensity'' about him. ''He'd come up to you if he saw a mole, and he would touch it,'' Mr. Hussey said. ''And people would just be like, 'Hey buddy, don't touch me. Boys don't touch boys here.' '' But when they learned he was a plastic surgeon and was checking for cancer, they softened.</p>
        <p>No one in the group would admit to shock when learning of the doctor's past, though the word ''surprise''  brought forth some thoughtful ''mmm-hmms.'' ''The guy was super nice,'' said Jason Naylor, a fellow pilot. To him, the case against Dr. Bierenbaum seems ''so over-circumstantial'' that he thinks maybe an appeal would succeed.</p>
        <p>In the hangar where Dr. Bierenbaum's Comanche still sits, Val Friesen was on his back with a wrench and a rag, repairing an airplane wing. He recalled that when David Berkowitz (later known as Son of Sam) spent time at the Minot military base, animals in the area turned up mutilated. ''We're so sparsely populated around here,'' he said, ''we even have to import our criminals.''</p>
        <p>Some in Minot now think of Dr. Bierenbaum's good works as an effort to expiate guilt.</p>
        <p>Dale Maixner, special agent with the North Dakota Bureau of Criminal Investigations, has another theory: that he was systematically building an image as a person incapable of murder.</p>
        <p>Of course, there is another explanation for what drew Dr. Bierenbaum here: the changes in medicine that have allowed the Trinity Health Center, where he worked, to become a regional hub.</p>
        <p>Randy Schwann, Trinity's marketing director, explained why Dr. Chollet and her husband, along with physicians from places like Walter Reed Army Medical Center and UCLA Medical Center, were recruited here.</p>
        <p>''Ten years ago we were a hospital, and now we're a health system,'' Schwann said, with 80 physicians, 7 community clinics and eye-care and mental-health programs.</p>
        <p>Even Dr. Chollet's brother, also a physician, had earlier been recruited to work there.</p>
        <p>Some say that doctors come here fleeing lawsuits, bouts with drugs and alcohol and strange gaps in their resumes. But Dr. Bierenbaum had a strong record, excellent training and appeared to have an unblemished past, Mr. Schwann recalled, until New York City investigators, accompanied by Mr. Maixner, arrived in November 1998 to look into some issues. They confronted Dr. Bierenbaum on the steps of the Trinity clinic, but he invoked his right to counsel. ''He refused to talk to us,'' Mr. Maixner said. ''The conversation lasted 30 seconds, and he wasn't as upset as I would have expected.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Bierenbaum carried on as a good citizen, writing an article in The Grand Forks Daily Herald about how to avoid snowblower injuries. But his  life in Minot was already fraying.</p>
        <p>His wife had decided to leave medicine and begin law school about 200 miles away in Grand Forks, N.D., where she moved, creating a hectic commuter marriage. Upon selling their Minot condominium, Dr. Bierenbaum took to sleeping on a folding cot in the hangar beside his airplane and showering in the hospital where he still treated patients.</p>
        <p>By last December, the life he had built was over. Investigators with the Manhattan district attorney's office arrested him in Minot, and gave him 48 hours to return to New York and surrender. Darrel Williams, a prominent eye surgeon and one of Dr. Bierenbaum's closest friends here, recalled of that morning, ''He looked a little haggard and seemed to be rushing around.'' Only later would he learn what had happened.</p>
        <p>Before leaving town, Dr. Bierenbaum stopped in at Pietsch's to pay a bill. Mr. Hussey recalled: ''He looked like death warmed over, and I said to him, 'Bob, you look sick.' He said, 'I just have a lot on my mind.' '' The next day, the news hit that he was in New York and under arrest for murder.</p>
        <p>He was awaiting trial at his parents' home in East Orange, N.J., while his wife and daughter were in Pittsburgh.</p>
        <p>Looking back, people see sinister clues in the fact that his socks were mismatched, his airplane a mess.  ''How odd is it that a murderer had dinner at my house, a Seder no less,'' said Harriet Epstein, originally from Queens, who briefly ran the only bagel store here and whose late husband, a wealthy and prominent doctor, befriended and worked with Dr. Bierenbaum.</p>
        <p>Though he doesn't like to admit it, Mike Berg, the friend from the Rotary Club, is angry. ''Going to other states and acting like you're innocent? It's still wrong and you didn't face it.'' Being essentially softhearted, though, he e-mailed Dr. Bierenbaum before the trial to wish him good luck and got a brief response:  ''Thanks. Janet and the baby are fine.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Williams thinks that, regardless of whether or not Dr. Bierenbaum is guilty, he has suffered enough and should be allowed out on a work-release program to continue treating patients. ''I feel grief, like someone has died,'' he said. ''It's the loss of his life and the good he does to help other people.''</p>
