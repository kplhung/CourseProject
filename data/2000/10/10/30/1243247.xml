        <p>Whipping winds turned a house fire in Paterson, N.J., into a neighborhood conflagration yesterday, destroying three homes, damaging six others and leaving 55 people homeless.</p>
        <p>No one was injured in the fire, which was reported at 2:05 p.m. in a two-and-a-half-story wood-frame row house at 559 Main Street, said Battalion Chief Edward McLaughlin.</p>
        <p>Within seven minutes, the fire had gone from a single alarm to a general alarm and spread to three other houses, Chief McLaughlin said. Eventually, it jumped across an alley and spread to more row houses.</p>
        <p>About 100 firefighters from 23 companies in Paterson and surrounding towns were called in to fight the fire, which burned for more than six hours. The cause was being investigated, Chief McLaughlin said.</p>
        <p>The displaced people were staying in a public school nearby, he said.</p>
