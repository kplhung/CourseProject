        <p>REEVES-Robert died October 20, 2000. He was a friend to many and a man of integrity, compassion, decent instinct, and keen perception. He was an avowed loner, but enjoyed the luxury of solitude. Politically, he was an independent; socially, a civil libertarian but for law and order, hopefully always with justice. He was a secular humanist and he decried hypocrisy. He was forever grateful to his esteemed parents, Minna and Benjamin Reeves, for their lifelong devotion to him, as well as for their generosity to him and to others.</p>
