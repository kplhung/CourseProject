        <p>New Jersey, where three of five voters are unaffiliated with a major party, has long been seen as an island of moderation in the liberal Northeast. But Jon S. Corzine, the Democratic candidate for Senate, has built his candidacy on the belief that liberalism is back.</p>
        <p>He campaigns for huge spending increases and new federal programs in education, health care and long-term care. For almost every problem -- from inner-city poverty to suburban sprawl -- he proposes a costly government solution.</p>
        <p>Predictably, his Republican opponent, Representative Bob Franks, ridicules Mr. Corzine as an out-of-touch wastrel. Conservative columnists and radio hosts lampoon the bearded Democrat as a caricature of an old-fashioned, unadulterated liberal-cum-communist.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Corzine, who prefers to call himself progressive, spent hundreds of thousands of dollars polling New Jerseyans before he ever began his Senate campaign. And, as independent surveys and interviews with dozens of voters across the state show, he is clearly onto something.</p>
        <p>''I think that it's not just New Jersey that is more liberal, but the country in general,'' said Bruce Minolli, 47, a pharmacist in Middletown. ''We in the baby boomer generation are no longer living under our parents' conservative thumb. Liberal ideas appeal to us, and it's time to follow them. If spending money now that we know will return with interest in the future is too liberal for people, then they can move out.''</p>
        <p>In poll after poll, New Jersey voters now overwhelmingly say they favor an activist federal government and more federal spending on education, health care and other programs. Concerns about rising taxes, long considered the third rail of state politics, are dissipating as the economy booms and governments and families share in the surpluses.</p>
        <p>''It's very easy to be generous when you have money in your pocket,'' said Christy Davis, a co-manager of the Corzine campaign.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Franks, a four-term congressman who has spent a lifetime in politics, bristles at the idea that voters could be beguiled by a candidate's platform alone.</p>
        <p>''I'm going to tell people what I think we can afford and what I think we can't,'' Mr. Franks said today during a swing through the western part of the state en route to Giants Stadium for a tailgate party. ''I don't think I'd be doing anyone a service by promising I'll deliver everything everyone wants.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine seems to be doing just that. Through a ceaseless barrage of high-gloss television commercials, he has portrayed himself as the only candidate eager to reform the health care system, protect Social Security, expand Medicare to cover prescription drugs and send every toddler to preschool and every high school graduate to college.</p>
        <p>''There's the allure of a person who wants to shake things up and to be a bit risky in government,'' said Jeff Mitchell, 51, a construction foreman from Freehold. ''I think that your regular family is conservative, but dreams of being big spenders and taking risks. A guy like Corzine does it, and maybe some of his ideas will rub off on us.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Franks, who has been reacting to Mr. Corzine throughout the campaign, agrees with many of his goals, but generally argues for a more cautious approach. He speaks of increasing federal spending for education and expanding federal health-insurance programs, for example. But it is unclear whether his incrementalism, coupled with his dire warnings about the fiscal consequences of Mr. Corzine's expansionist agenda, will win over New Jersey's increasingly impatient voters.</p>
        <p>''The question being put to voters through one-way advertising is, 'Are these good things or not?' '' said Cliff Zukin, a political scientist and director of The Star-Ledger/Eagleton-Rutgers Poll. ''Bob Franks has not been able to ask, 'Are you willing to pay more money for that?' But if people are willing to pay, and unless Franks can ask that, Corzine is essentially getting a free ride.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Franks, who has finally cobbled together enough money to go on the air with his own commercials, is doing his best to prevent that. He has narrowed his deficit in the race to the single digits -- nine points in a Star-Ledger/Eagleton-Rutgers Poll of 600 registered voters published today, and four points in a a new Gannett New Jersey Poll of 575 registered voters. He has done so largely by winning over Republicans outraged over Mr. Corzine's campaign spending. Independents and Democrats have been less moved, according to the polls.</p>
        <p>But on the campaign trail today, Mr. Franks encountered a number of Democrats who said they planned to vote for him precisely because of Mr. Corzine's spending. ''I never voted Republican, and I'm voting Republican in this one race,'' said Bob Dodelin, of Mount Laurel, who shook Mr. Franks's hand at an antiques fair in Lambertville.</p>
        <p>Of less interest to voters, however, were Mr. Franks's dire warnings that Mr. Corzine would ''bankrupt the federal government'' and cause ''backsliding'' into budget deficits.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine, however, has been affected by this line of attack. In recent weeks, he has largely dropped the word ''universal'' from his stump speech in favor of variations on a theme of ''fiscal discipline.'' On Friday, taping a television interview, he repeatedly said any spending increases should be ''prudent and thoughtful.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine's pollster, Doug Schoen, said the campaign's surveys showed that when given a choice between spending for social programs and an across-the-board tax cut, which Mr. Franks supports, New Jerseyans favored social programs by a three-to-one margin. ''When you add fiscal discipline into the mix,'' he said, ''it's four to one.''</p>
        <p>In social policy, as well, Mr. Corzine's positions are not, as Mr. Franks claims, so clearly out of the ''mainstream.'' Mr. Corzine opposes any erosion of abortion rights, for example, and supports gun registration and licensing. A New York Times poll earlier this month found that most New Jerseyans agree with Mr. Corzine on both counts.</p>
        <p>Even Mr. Corzine's opposition to the death penalty has become less of an anomaly, as the release of scores of wrongfully convicted death-row prisoners and advances in DNA testing have raised new questions about capital punishment across the country. In New Jersey, the voters are of two minds, the Times poll found: just 46 percent say murder should be punished by death, while 40 percent, like Mr. Corzine, now prefer life imprisonment without parole.</p>
        <p>But like his views on government spending, Mr. Franks's positions on social policy are more nuanced than Mr. Corzine's, making it more difficult for him to explain himself in 30-second advertisements, and making him more vulnerable to attack.</p>
        <p>For example, Mr. Franks says he supports abortion rights but favors some restrictions, such as a ban on the late-term procedure its opponents call partial-birth abortion. But Mr. Corzine is running a commercial that all but accuses Mr. Franks of wanting to overturn Roe v. Wade.</p>
        <p>New Jersey has not exactly lurched to the left, pollsters and political analysts say. Rather, the already wide center has been stretching in that direction for several years. The Times poll, which surveyed 908 registered voters, found that 44 percent of voters described themselves as moderate and 26 percent as liberal. Both numbers were essentially unchanged over the last few years. But conservatives dropped to 23 percent of the electorate from 28 percent in 1997.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zukin, of The Star-Ledger/Eagleton-Rutgers Poll, points to two events that he said pushed unaffiliated voters in the direction of the Democratic Party: the 1997 gubernatorial election, and the battle in Washington over the impeachment of President Clinton.</p>
        <p>''When Jim McGreevey started beating up Christie Whitman around car insurance and it became a class issue, that's when we saw the Democratic advantage in New Jersey change,'' Mr. Zukin said. ''And when Republicans beat up Clinton around impeachment, the state became even more Democratic.''</p>
        <p>Over all, the number of people who consider themselves Democrats has risen to 39 percent from 33 percent in 1997, the Times poll found; only 23 percent call themselves Republicans, down from 30 percent in 1997.</p>
        <p>The disparity is even more striking when voters are asked which party they feel closer to: 34 percent say the Republican Party, while 52 percent say the Democratic Party, according to the Times poll.</p>
        <p>Mr. Franks, whose Congressional district re-elected him even though Democrats outnumbered Republicans there, no doubt recognizes this handicap, said David P. Rebovich, a political science professor at Rider University. ''Why haven't we heard Bob Franks saying, 'On top of that, I'll be a member of a majority party?' '' he asked. ''He's afraid to say that, because the response will be that 'you'll have to kowtow to Trent Lott, and your seeming moderation will fall by the wayside.' To run as an incumbent Republican congressman really is an albatross.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rebovich said Mr. Franks was wise to focus on Mr. Corzine's political inexperience and to paint him as out of touch. ''What we need is a subtle liberalism, or what Franks would call a moderate approach to public policy -- compassionate, sensitive, but also sensible and frugal,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Still, when social problems top every list of voters' concerns while tax rates keep dropping, it remains to be seen if frugality will have the appeal it had in the recessionary early 1990's.</p>
        <p>''We are like the greatest country in the world,'' said Cynthia Schaefer, a fifth-grade teacher from Ocean Township in Monmouth County, where Republicans have long held an edge in statewide elections.</p>
        <p>''If we can't supply our children with adequate health care, then there is a terribly big problem,'' she said. ''I don't have a limit where I would say we can't afford that. We have to afford that.''</p>
