        <p>Despite government assurances, building experts and news media in Tokyo question whether city of 12 million is safe or ever can be after summer of unusually intense seismic activity and strongest tremor since devastating 1995 earthquake in Kobe, which killed about 6,000 people; many experts say Tokyo and its immediate surroundings, which are atop one of world's most complex and menacing patchwork of seismic faults, could suffer far more powerful and potentially catastrophic earthquake at any time; 1923 earthquake, which measured 7.9 on Richter scale and killed estimated 140,000 people recalled; photo; map (M)</p>

        <p>Once every few weeks this city is shaken by a tremor so powerful that it becomes Topic A of conversation in the gleaming high-rises that tower above Tokyo and aboard the packed subways that course underground. And then, just as swiftly, conversations shift back to Japan's economic performance, the latest political scandal or, these days, Japan's baseball championship series.</p>
        <p>Such serenity is in large part attributable to government assurances that every practical earthquake safety precaution has already been taken in Tokyo, and to Japanese familiarity with geological disaster on a huge scale. No one seems to blink at minimum -- and oddly precise -- estimates of 6,717 people killed and more than 300,000 structures destroyed, mostly by fire, if the Big One hits.</p>
        <p>''All of Tokyo's large buildings are able to withstand a magnitude 7.2 earthquake,'' said Kenji Suzuki, the city's chief of disaster prevention planning, whose offices in the 48-story twin-tower Tokyo government headquarters contain a disaster response command center that resembles a high-tech war room. ''Since scientists tell us that we are unlikely to experience anything bigger than this in the foreseeable future, we are satisfied.''</p>
        <p>But after a summer of unusually intense seismic activity across Japan and, earlier this month, the strongest tremor since the devastating 1995 earthquake in Kobe, seismologists, building experts and the news media are pondering whether this city of 12 million people is now considered safe or, indeed, ever can be.</p>
        <p>The Kobe earthquake had a force of 7.2 on the Richter scale, now seldom used. It struck directly under the city, and killed about 6,000 people.</p>
        <p>At the Tokyo Fire Department, which would be the lead rescue agency in an earthquake, officials are, like Mr. Suzuki, focused on a quake of the magnitude of that of Kobe.</p>
        <p>''A bigger earthquake will probably not happen for another 100 or 200 years,'' said Seiichi Ohsawa, a fire department quake preparedness specialist. ''On the other hand, a quake like Kobe's can be expected to recur fairly often.''</p>
        <p>But many experts say that Tokyo and its immediate surroundings,  atop one of the world's most complex and menacing patchworks of seismic faults, could suffer a far more powerful earthquake at any time. In 1923, an earthquake known as the Great Kanto earthquake hit the Tokyo area, leaving an estimated 140,000 people dead. It measured 7.9 on the old Richter scale.</p>
        <p>By all accounts, building materials and techniques, as well as safety and rescue procedures, have improved immensely in the last 70 years. But the location of what experts view as the most dangerous faults in the Tokyo region -- offshore in the Tokai region, a semirural zone to the southwest -- means that many of them warn that Tokyo may be preparing for the wrong disaster, and should ponder instead how to combat a 27-foot tsunami, or giant wave, that would reach the Tokyo waterfront within three to four minutes, before any safety precautions could be taken.</p>
        <p>One danger that appears to have been given little consideration in official disaster estimates is ''soil liquefaction,'' whereby intense vibrations release underground water, instantly turning what had once appeared to be solid land into oozing, perilous mud.</p>
        <p>Tokyo is in particular danger because much of this city is low-lying Tokyo Bay landfill and other ''reclaimed'' land. A 1987 computer model made by the Institute of Civil Engineers, which is cited in the book ''Sixty Seconds That Will Change the World: The Coming Tokyo Earthquake,'' suggested that 98 square miles, or about 12 percent of the city's land, will liquefy in the event of a major earthquake.</p>
        <p>Megumi Mizoue, a leading earthquake expert at the National Meteorological Agency, scoffed at official casualty estimates from a big quake, noting first that ''what is happening in the Tokai area is awful and gives us reason for great worry'' and second that Tokyo has many shopping centers and subways deep underground. ''It is said that the shock is reduced by a third or more underground,'' he said. ''But power and air come from the surface, and we can anticipate lots of casualties simply from panic.''</p>
        <p>At the Obayashi Corporation, one of Tokyo's biggest building companies, officials said they were concerned that the city's building safety standards, steadily more stringent since Kobe, were still not up to snuff. As they spoke, workers outside their shimmering headquarters in the Shinagawa district were completing work on the foundation of a companion tower in a pit that reached bedrock, deep underground, to reduce the danger of soil liquefaction.</p>
        <p>Other methods for insuring the stability of tall buildings, they said, included the placement of huge tanks holding 150 tons or more of water on the roof. The swaying of the water, architects said, counters the swaying of the building in an earthquake.</p>
        <p>Architects have also begun to use latticework girders, some with hydraulic shock absorbers, as a brace, or ecoskeleton, for tall buildings.</p>
        <p>Even in the case of a Kobe-style quake beneath Tokyo, the devastation experts say they expect seems difficult to square with official damage and casualty estimates. Mr. Ohsawa of the fire department, for instance, conceded that ''we would be overwhelmed.''</p>
        <p>''We couldn't possibly handle all of the fires,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Relief officials rely on public awareness and preparedness to keep the toll, and subsequent chaos, to a minimum. Approximately one million people take part in earthquake drills in Tokyo every year.</p>
        <p>''In Kobe they didn't expect an earthquake, but in Tokyo everyone expects one,'' Mr. Ohsawa said. ''We hope that participation in drills will make a difference.''</p>
        <p>But in Kamata, a Tokyo neighborhood of low buildings and narrow streets that according to the municipal government falls into the highest earthquake risk category, few pedestrians or shopkeepers interviewed recently were aware of any particular danger in the area. Few, too, had ever taken part in earthquake drills or given much thought about what to do in an emergency.</p>
        <p>''Hey! Not here!'' shrieked Noriko Sanpei, 21, a student who was leaving a multistoried college building with several friends. ''We've never been told anything by the city or by anyone. If we had to evacuate, I wouldn't know where to go.''</p>
