        <p>Gone is the weary, worn 7-footer with the kneepads and the lumbering gait, the brooding face of the Knicks for the past 15 years and, most recently, his former teammates' scapegoat.

        <p>Gone is the weary, worn 7-footer with the kneepads and the lumbering gait, the brooding face of the Knicks for the past 15 years and, most recently, his former teammates' scapegoat. The success of Patrick Ewing's former team now revolves around three All-Stars on the perimeter, his frail, unpretentious and at times spectacular replacement, and an undersize post player whose battles with bigger men have turned his body into one aching mass of muscle.</p>
        <p>Each of the five is capable of providing the Knicks and their fans with highlights and moments that Ewing rarely could. Instead of Ewing launching an awkward baseline jumper, there will be Latrell Sprewell blazing toward the basket, braids swinging, for a vicious, two-handed dunk capped with the most beloved scowl in the metropolitan area.</p>
        <p>Whereas Ewing brought clutch-time memories of being outdone by Hakeem Olajuwon, Michael Jordan and Reggie Miller and of an errant finger roll in a Game 7 against Indiana, Allan Houston and Larry Johnson provoke fonder thoughts of the bouncing shot that buried Miami in the playoffs and the storybook 4-point play against the Pacers in 1999.</p>
        <p>And while the sight of Ewing wheeling slowly and predictably for a shot drew a groan from the Madison Square Garden crowd in recent seasons, Glen Rice's sweet stroke will have fans expecting a bucket every time he lets one go. And Marcus Camby's tip-dunks off offensive rebounds will ignite the kind of hysteria that Ewing had not incited in years.</p>
        <p>Sleeker and speedier, the Ewing-less Knicks, who open the season tomorrow night against the Philadelphia 76ers at the Garden, should be the most aesthetically pleasing team the franchise has sent onto the floor in at least 15 years. But the question is: Will it be better?</p>
        <p>The majority opinion around the league is: No way. But in the locker room, where the players have admitted to being excited about finally getting to play without Ewing, the Knicks are not conceding anything.</p>
        <p>''We have a lot of our key components back, so I don't think we're any worse,'' Sprewell said. ''I don't know if we're much better, either, though. It's a tough call.''</p>
        <p>Better is relative to the competition, and the Knicks will benefit from playing in a watered-down Eastern Conference that has no offensively dominant center or power forward. Miami's Alonzo Mourning, the conference's best player, will miss the season with a kidney disease. Indiana's Rik Smits retired, and Dale Davis, the No. 1 reason Indiana bested the Knicks in last season's playoffs, was shipped to the Western Conference in a trade to Portland, as was Cleveland's Shawn Kemp.</p>
        <p>So even if the Knicks miss Ewing more than they think they will, they cannot, at this point, be eliminated from the conference title picture, if only because they appear to be no worse than the rest of their mediocre competition. On the other hand, the Knicks may be only an angry star or a nagging injury away from struggling, which could make this season the greatest challenge of Coach Jeff Van Gundy's career.</p>
        <p>''I think this year we have more challenges and more questions than in years past because we've had more change than in the past,'' Van Gundy said. ''I don't know if it's my biggest challenge, but it's the one in front of me.''</p>
        <p>Van Gundy's most formidable task will be finding appropriate playing time for Sprewell, Houston and Rice, three All-Star-caliber players who essentially play the same position. Rice, who has a reputation as a somewhat selfish player, has been accepting his role as the Knicks' sixth man. But he is assuming he will play starter's minutes.</p>
        <p>''We all know that the guy's got to play and get minutes,'' Don Chaney, a Knicks assistant, said of Rice. ''It's up to Jeff in terms of how he handles that. It's hard making sure a guy gets X amount of minutes, especially when you have guys who play the same position. But Jeff knows that those three guys, especially, have to have minutes. We can't allow ourselves to not have them on the floor. He'll figure it out.''</p>
        <p>Van Gundy's initial thoughts were to play the three together with Sprewell and Houston in the backcourt. But playing Sprewell at point guard was such a liability in the preseason that Van Gundy favors a lineup featuring Rice at power forward.</p>
        <p>''What we would do is spread teams out, drive and kick, and scramble the game a little bit more,'' Van Gundy said. ''I think that may be more feasible at times than playing Latrell, Allan and Glen as the point, shooting guard and small forward.''</p>
        <p>But except for a handful of minutes in Charlotte, Rice has no experience as a power forward. When asked yesterday if he had ever played the position, he smiled and said, ''Only on PlayStation.''</p>
        <p>While the strange alignment might work to the Knicks' advantage on the offensive end, where Rice would use his quickness to exploit his larger, slower opponents, it would be a defensive and rebounding hazard against most units. At best, it seems suited to serve as a secret weapon the Knicks can employ in stretches. That being the case, the question still remains as to how Van Gundy will get Rice the minutes he deserves.</p>
        <p>Van Gundy has talked with his three stars about the situation and told them there will be nights when only two of them are on the floor at the end of the game.</p>
        <p>''There's going to be rough times as far as some nights because if we only finish with two of the three and we lose, the other guy's going to think, 'I should've been in,' '' Van Gundy said. ''And you know what? Rightfully so.''</p>
        <p>Sprewell, who made a sacrifice similar to Rice's by coming off the bench when he joined the Knicks in 1999, said that when he heard of the Ewing trade he expected a subsequent deal involving himself or Houston. He is still not sure how it is going to play out.</p>
        <p>''I feel confident in myself and what I can do,'' Sprewell said. ''I know those guys can play. It's going to be competitive. Somebody's going to be disappointed at the end of the game, I would suspect. But it really shouldn't be. If we're winning, then guys should understand that it doesn't matter.</p>
        <p>''But I know how I am and how those guys, Allan and Glen, are, too. They want to play. As a player, you want to play as much as possible. But you have to make sacrifices, and some nights, it's going to be each one of us making the sacrifice. Hopefully, it'll work out. There's no sense in trying to make the situation worse by complaining about it.''</p>
        <p>One of the league's general managers and a person close to the Knicks management said the Knicks were still trying to cancel the problem by trading for Dikembe Mutombo, the Atlanta Hawks' All-Star center. They said the Knicks were trying to involve a third team because Atlanta would not trade Mutombo for Houston and Camby.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, the Knicks will try to make what they have work.</p>
        <p>''As of right now, this is who we are,'' General Manager Scott Layden has said repeatedly, most recently last Wednesday. ''And we like who we are going into the season.''</p>
