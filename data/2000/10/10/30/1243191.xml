        <p>Less than a year after it changed the face of network prime-time competition, the ABC game show, ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' is coming back to earth, moving down in status from phenomenon to solid performer, and its producer is already contemplating a facelift.</p>
        <p>The new television season is still unsettled, and the early competition for ''Millionaire'' has been unusually stiff, including the Olympics, the World Series and heavily promoted premieres of entertainment series; but viewership for the game show is down about 16 percent from where it was at the close of last season.</p>
        <p>More significantly, last season's trend toward an aging in the show's audience has continued. This season ''Millionaire'' is down about 25 percent among viewers between the ages of 18 and 49, the main group that ABC sells to advertisers, a shortfall that is forcing ABC to give away commercial time free to some advertisers.</p>
        <p>With about 20 million viewers a night, the show still provides ratings far superior to most other shows on television, even though it risks overexposure because it is on four times a week. ABC does not release specific figures, but because ''Millionaire'' fills so many hours a week at a cost that is only about half as much an hour as entertainment programs, the game show remains the most profitable show on TV.</p>
        <p>But any sign of vulnerability is cause for alarm at ABC, which has become extremely reliant on the show, especially because the network did not generate any other outright hits last season and seems to have added none thus far this season.</p>
        <p>So the show's executive producer, Michael Davies, is making changes. A second week of celebrity contests is already taped and ready for next month, and a plan is in place for a series of shows with parent-child co-contestants. But now Mr. Davies is poised to make the biggest change yet in the show's familiar format: experimenting with finding contestants through open recruitment, instead of random selection.</p>
        <p>From the beginning, the show has chosen contestants strictly based on an anonymous phone-in quiz. Mr. Davies said he hoped this method would finally provide some diversity -- in terms of race, gender, age and even professional status -- in a show that has been dominated by 40-ish white men.</p>
        <p>While labeling the move an experiment, Mr. Davies said, ''We are seriously looking at throwing out our whole contestant selection process.''</p>
        <p>The ratings falloff this season has coincided with ABC's decision to expand ''Millionaire'' from three nights a week to four, a move widely questioned in the television industry for risking exhausting viewer interest in the show. As Mr. Davies pointed out: ''We've done 185 shows already. That's about eight years worth of episodes for any other prime-time series.''</p>
        <p>Whatever the reason for the falloff, the decline has left ''Millionaire'' vulnerable to falling short of ratings guarantees ABC made to advertisers, which would force the network to give away free commercials known as make-goods.</p>
        <p>Alex Wallau, the president of ABC, a unit of the Walt Disney Company, said that the network had predicted the show would haver some audience decline this season and had built in a reserve of time to give to advertisers in case of a shortfall. But he acknowledged that ABC had also had to give up additional commercial time it had intended to sell. Mr. Wallau said, ''If the ratings continue at the level they've been at, we will have make-good problems.''</p>
        <p>Both Mr. Wallau and Mr. Davies suggested that the show would bounce back once the fall special programming ended and viewing patterns settled down. Noting that ''Millionaire'' has been called the perfect default show, Mr. Davies said, ''I think when people get finished checking out other things, we'll come back.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Wallau agreed, though he said: ''This show is not as dominant as I hoped it would be. I think people will come back. It remains to be seen how many will come back.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Davies said, ''I've known for a long time that this year I was going to have to produce my heart out in order to keep it special.''</p>
        <p>That has meant more special episodes like last week's tournament with American Olympic athletes and the show's coming week of celebrity games, featuring stars like the actor Alec Baldwin, the comedian Jon Stewart and the the hip-hop mogul Sean (Puffy) Combs.</p>
        <p>''Millionaire'' had some other guests in mind, like NBC's Conan O'Brien, but other networks, sensing that ''Millionaire'' might be becoming vulnerable, did not want to help the show revitalize itself and so blocked their stars from participating. ''It seemed somewhat punitive,'' Mr. Davies said.</p>
        <p>But the celebrity shows still have a special feel, Mr. Davies said, and they helped crystallize some of his impressions about the show's contestant pool. Mr. Davies said he became especially aware of how homogenized the show had become as he watched the celebrity editions that featured black contestants like  Mr. Combs, the actress Vivica A. Fox and the Olympic sprinter Maurice Greene. During its entire run, ''Millionaire'' has had only one black contestant on its regular editions.</p>
        <p>In recent months, Mr. Davis said, he looked at some of the people sitting in the show's ''hot seat'' and thought that he had seen them before. ''It was: here's another white guy in a blue shirt,'' he said. ''We've had a lot of those guys in blue shirts.''</p>
        <p>More than merely looks or dress, Mr. Davies said, the show seemed to have begun to fall into some geographical and even professional ruts.</p>
        <p>''We have had a lot of players from places like Maryland and Florida and Atlanta,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The show was also attracting an inordinate number of teachers, lawyers and, especially, computer technicians, Mr. Davies said.</p>
        <p>The sameness among the contestants is a risk because ''Millionaire,'' besides being a game show, is also a reality show. Its stars --beyond Regis Philbin, the host -- are the real people who go on the show, sweat under its lights, banter with Mr. Philbin and win money that they hope will change their lives in some way. One key to the show's success has been the rooting interest that viewers develop in certain players.</p>
        <p>Mr. Davies and ABC have never been able to cast the game show the way other reality shows, like CBS's ''Survivor,'' did so successfully. And so ''Millionaire'' has been forced to continue to compete against shows like NBC's ''Will and Grace'' with whoever makes it onto the air, no matter what they look like, how old they are, or whether they have a compelling story to tell to viewers and get them rooting for them.</p>
        <p>The plan to move toward recruiting contestants stems partly from Mr. Davies's plan for a tournament of college students. In setting up those shows, ''Millionaire'' visited colleges and was flooded with thousands of potential players. Mr. Davies said that show was able to be selective in choosing contestants, leaning toward those who ''might truly need some help paying for a college education'' or those with ''really good stories to tell.''</p>
        <p>With that as a model, the show plans to go to cities where it has been underrepresented in contestants, places like Cleveland, Detroit, Birmingham and New York. ''Yes, we have been underrepresented in people from New York,'' Mr. Davies said. The show is taped in New York.</p>
        <p>After an aggressive local marketing campaign, contestants from those cities will be invited to phone in their interest in being on the show, but they will not have to answer a phone quiz, as has been the rule. About 375 people in each city will be invited to some locations like a hotel ballroom to take a test.</p>
        <p>''We are going to establish a minimum passing score for the test,'' Mr. Davies said. But among those who do pass, the show will choose contestants, looking for what Mr. Davies said is a wider cross section of the country.</p>
        <p>''We want our show to look more like America,'' he said. And, for the sake of its advertisers, ABC may want the show to look like young America.</p>
        <p>The shift in contestant selection will set the American version apart from the original British version, which still adheres strictly to a random process based on the phone quiz. ''What we're hoping for in greater diversity,'' Mr, Davies said, but I mean that with a small d. We don't want this to look like something from central casting.''</p>
