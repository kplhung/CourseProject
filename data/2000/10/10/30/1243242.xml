        <p>The rookie Ron Dayne had run the football on six of the last nine plays, lugging the football to the Philadelphia Eagles' 4-yard line as the Giants sought the clinching, fourth-quarter touchdown today in a game they already led by 17 points.</p>
        <p>But now Dayne was coming to the sideline and he had not been summoned.</p>
        <p>''I was going over to him to see what was wrong and if I could help,'' Giants Coach Jim Fassel said of Dayne. ''Thank God I didn't get too close, because he just left his lunch right there on the sideline.''</p>
        <p>Dayne's stomach distress came just after the Giants' other top running back, Tiki Barber, had his foot stepped on. That meant an opportunity for the reserve running back Joe Montgomery, who had not dressed for several games this season. Montgomery broke a tackle as he went off right tackle, charging into the end zone for the 4-yard touchdown.</p>
        <p>''I always tell the guys that you've got to be ready,'' Fassel said. ''You never know what might happen and we'll need you.''</p>
        <p>Fassel Ends a Drought</p>
        <p>Fassel's three-year victory drought after bye weeks came to an end in today's 24-7 victory. Fassel also won his first replay challenge. In the last two seasons, seven times Fassel had asked the officials to review a videotape replay and each time his challenge had been rejected.</p>
        <p>In the third quarter, Fassel challenged a 9-yard pass from Donovan McNabb to Charles Johnson. Johnson's catch was going to set up a third-and-1 near midfield. The officials agreed that Johnson, who dove for the ball, came down out of bounds before his feet touched the ground.</p>
        <p>Mitchell Sets Record</p>
        <p>Brian Mitchell of Philadelphia set a National Football League career record for punt-return yardage. Mitchell's 57 return yards today enabled him to surpass David Meggett's record of 3,708 yards.</p>
        <p>Giants cornerback Andre Weathers saw his first action since having knee reconstruction surgery last season. Weathers played as the nickel cornerback for Reggie Stephens, who sat out with a sprained ankle.</p>
