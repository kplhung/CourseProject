        <p>Congressional candidates in New Jersey this year are campaigning at the ''fighting center'' of the nation's important issues, as Woodrow Wilson once described the state's political tendencies. In at least two close and bitter races -- in the 7th and 12th Districts -- candidates battle over who best represents New Jersey's generally moderate politics. Here are our endorsements in important races.</p>
        <p>Third District, Central New Jersey: Until this year, Representative James Saxton's 16 years in Congress, his environmental credentials and his protection of military bases have given this Republican regular plenty of insulation against strong political challengers. This time, however, the mayor of Cherry Hill, Susan Bass Levin, has brought energy and fresh views to the contest, arguing persuasively that Mr. Saxton is too conservative for this changing district on a number of issues, including gun control and abortion rights. Mrs. Levin is a well-spoken candidate who would carry the banner of campaign finance reform and whose credentials as a city leader and supporter of public education would give New Jersey a more energetic voice in Congress. We support Mrs. Levin.</p>

        <p>Congressional candidates in New Jersey this year are campaigning at the ''fighting center'' of the nation's important issues, as Woodrow Wilson once described the state's political tendencies. In at least two close and bitter races -- in the 7th and 12th Districts -- candidates battle over who best represents New Jersey's generally moderate politics. Here are our endorsements in important races.</p>
        <p>Third District, Central New Jersey: Until this year, Representative James Saxton's 16 years in Congress, his environmental credentials and his protection of military bases have given this Republican regular plenty of insulation against strong political challengers. This time, however, the mayor of Cherry Hill, Susan Bass Levin, has brought energy and fresh views to the contest, arguing persuasively that Mr. Saxton is too conservative for this changing district on a number of issues, including gun control and abortion rights. Mrs. Levin is a well-spoken candidate who would carry the banner of campaign finance reform and whose credentials as a city leader and supporter of public education would give New Jersey a more energetic voice in Congress. We support Mrs. Levin.</p>
        <p>Fifth District, Northern New Jersey: Representative Marge Roukema, dean of the New Jersey delegation, is a moderate Republican whose political challenge often comes from the far right. Having weathered another such onslaught during the primary earlier this year, Mrs. Roukema deserves a strong vote in the general election as affirmation of the G.O.P.'s better instincts. Her opposition to gay adoption and her support of limits on abortion rights are at odds with her moderate ranking. On these issues we would agree with Linda Mercurio, a tax lawyer and political newcomer who is Mrs. Roukema's Democratic opponent. However, Mrs. Roukema's long record of independence and grace under assault from her ultraconservative adversaries deserves support. We endorse Mrs. Roukema.</p>
        <p>Seventh District, Eastern New Jersey: New Jersey's reputation for nasty politics has certainly been enhanced in this race to replace Representative Bob Franks, now running for the United States Senate. Maryanne Connelly, the Democrat and former mayor of Fanwood, is running against Michael Ferguson, a Republican and an educator who moved into the district to run for this seat. Ms. Connelly has a solid record of public service in Fanwood, and she would be a steady voice against Social Security privatization and the anti-abortion forces in Congress that her opponent would join. Mr. Ferguson is articulate, but it is difficult to get a fix on where he stands since he expressed more conservative views in an earlier campaign in a different district. Supporters of Mr. Ferguson have blanketed television screens with commercials distorting Ms. Connelly's public record -- a push that has helped boost him in the polls. We endorse Ms. Connelly.</p>
        <p>Twelfth District, Central New Jersey: The Republican race against Representative Rush Holt began shortly after Mr. Holt, a Democrat, was first elected two years ago. His Republican opponent, Richard Zimmer, held this seat from 1991 to 1997 and now wants it back. There is understandable confusion about who is the incumbent. Mr. Zimmer had a moderate Republican record in support of campaign finance reform, abortion rights and fiscal discipline. But Mr. Holt, a physicist from the Princeton area, has an even stronger record on these issues, as well as the environment, especially working to curb urban sprawl. His learned voice on issues such as Social Security ably represents his well-educated constituents. We endorse Mr. Holt.</p>
