      <block class="full_text">
        <p>For every administrator, teacher, parent and student in Texas public schools, the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills is the sun around which education orbits. Nothing else is as important as the state's standardized test.</p>
        <p>It is also important to Gov. George W. Bush. From the day he began running for president, Mr. Bush has made education his signature issue, boasting of rising test scores during his tenure and portraying the Texas system as his blueprint for America.</p>
        <p>But even as Mr. Bush has pointed to the scores, a growing number of teachers, parents and academics are questioning whether Texas's system is truly producing better students. The political rhetoric of the so-called Texas miracle in education seems high blown to many parents and teachers. Nor do they believe the other extreme, that the system is fundamentally failing. But many worry that the test has become so consuming that more meaningful instruction is often eclipsed in the rush for high scores.</p>
        <p>''All the emphasis has been on scores, scores, scores,'' said Dan Weaver, a board member in the El Paso Independent School District.</p>
        <p>To be certain, the same complaints heard in Texas can be heard in many states. But in many Texas school districts, teachers and parents say, test preparation is overwhelming the curriculum. State university officials have complained that large numbers of Texas high school students are not prepared for college. Other critics wonder if one reason test scores have improved is that so many weaker students have simply dropped out. And others question if the scores are inflated because the tests are padded with easy questions.</p>
        <p>''There are a lot of easy questions on that test that reflect very low-level academic skills when compared to the grade being tested,'' said George Scott, an education analyst and Houston-area consultant who is often critical of the state education department.</p>
        <p>State education officials respond that the system is not flawless, nor has it finished evolving. They point to a new program intended to better track dropouts, and they acknowledge that many districts are unnecessarily force-feeding test preparation. Others note that states such as California and New York have adopted accountability systems similar to the one in Texas. The officials say that the tests are not padded but that students are simply doing better.</p>
        <p>''I think we're on the right track,'' said Jim Nelson, the Texas education commissioner. ''Is it perfect? Of course not. But I would rather be where we are than where a lot of other states are.''</p>
        <p>Education in Texas again became a campaign issue last week when a new RAND Corporation study suggested that intense drilling for the state test, known as TAAS, may be artificially inflating the scores.</p>
        <p>The test covers math, reading and writing, and is given in the 3rd through 8th grades and in 10th grade as a requirement of graduation. The number of students in all grades passing all sections of the test has risen to 80 percent this year, from 58 percent in 1995, when Mr. Bush took office. The biggest gains have been among black students, where the rate has gone to 67 percent from 31 percent, and Hispanics, to 72 percent from 39 percent.</p>
        <p>Although the Bush campaign strongly disputed the RAND study, pointing to an earlier, more favorable RAND report, some parents, like Carol Holst, were not surprised. Mrs. Holst's son is a fifth grader in a suburban Houston school where she said teachers spent six weeks ignoring subjects not on the test, like science and social studies, while preparing students for the TAAS.</p>
        <p>''They do the same writing formulas for months at a time,'' said Mrs. Holst, who has formed a parents group to change the system.</p>
        <p>The heavy drilling appears to have contributed to morale problems among teachers. In an annual survey this year by the Texas State Teachers Association, 43 percent of respondents said they were ''seriously considering leaving the profession because of low pay, poor benefits, and stress,'' including in some cases frustration over the test.</p>
        <p>One teacher, Erika Silva, 29, said she left an elementary school in Houston two years ago for a private school, in part because of her frustration over the TAAS. ''There was a lot of pressure,'' Ms. Silva said. ''We taught to the test. It was just an understood thing.''</p>
        <p>Such departures may be exacerbating a teacher shortage in Texas that echoes one nationwide. In August, the state teachers association estimated a deficit of 28,000 teachers and noted that about 44,000 positions were filled last year with teachers not certified in their assigned subject. Mr. Nelson said this shortage had prevented the state from expanding the number of college preparatory courses, like chemistry and calculus.</p>
        <p>The shortage of such courses comes as Texas is struggling to better prepare students for college. Even as TAAS scores have gone up, the scores of Texas students on college entrance exams have been stagnant. The Bush campaign says those scores have remained flat because more students are taking the tests, considered a good sign, though the percentage of the overall enrollment taking the test has actually not changed.</p>
        <p>State colleges and universities require students to pass a standardized test either upon leaving high school or once enrolled in order to take higher level courses. But in 1998, only 31 percent of students taking the test for the first time passed all sections. In February 1999, officials with the University of Texas system presented a report to a Texas House subcommittee complaining of ''marked declines in the number of students who are prepared academically for higher education.''</p>
        <p>To a large degree, Texas's education system is a product of the boardroom, not the classroom. A movement began in the 1980's, led in part by Ross Perot, when Texas ranked at the bottom nationally in education, and has evolved since.</p>
        <p>Many legislators credit Mr. Bush for emphasizing education and helping to strengthen the system.</p>
        <p>The system is built on conservative, business world maxims of accountability and standards in which public schools receive a report card ranging from exemplary to unacceptable. The ratings are based on attendance, dropout rates and, most important, TAAS scores. But in rating schools, the system became the first in the nation to make this demand: The school as a whole must attain certain achievement levels, as must each major demographic group -- whites, blacks, Hispanics and low-income students. If one group fails to meet any of the criteria, the whole school is downgraded.</p>
        <p>''We think it is one of the best hopes for introducing equity into American education,'' said Amy Wilkins, an analyst at Education Trust, a Washington group that advocates for poor and minority students. Ms. Wilkins said the Texas system was intended to prevent lower achieving students from falling through the cracks.</p>
        <p>But there are questions of whether the ''pay for performance'' premise from the business world is appropriate for education.</p>
        <p>Superintendents in some districts can receive $25,000 bonuses depending on TAAS scores. Principals and teachers can also be rewarded, or punished, based on the scores. The pressure to pass can be enormous; several districts have been caught cheating. Last year, the county attorney in Austin charged the city's school district and a top administrator with test tampering.</p>
        <p>Another question is whether the accountability system is working for minority students. The RAND study found that the achievement gap between white and minority students was actually growing.</p>
        <p>A discrimination lawsuit by a Mexican-American legal group argued that schools were intentionally holding back minority ninth graders that they feared would fail the 10th-grade test. These students, the lawsuit argued, often became dropouts.</p>
        <p>In January, a federal judge upheld the constitutionality of the test and ruled that the plaintiffs had not proved their argument on dropouts. But the judge declared dropouts a serious problem and agreed that a ''peculiarly'' high number of minority students were retained in ninth grade. The state's most recent statistics show that one of every four black or Hispanic students is retained in ninth grade. Over all, one in six ninth graders is held back, the state statistics show.</p>
        <p>''We're seeing an increase in the number of minority kids who are dropping out,'' said Linda McNeil, a Rice University professor who testified against the state in the TAAS lawsuit. ''And the ones who are held back are by far the ones most likely to drop out.''</p>
        <p>The issue of dropouts cuts directly to Mr. Bush's promise that the system ''leaves no child behind.'' State statistics show the dropout rate is nearly 15 percent, higher among blacks and Hispanics, while other studies question the state's counting system and put the rate above 30 percent. In September 1999, The El Paso Times published an investigation showing that more than 30,000 students labeled by the system as ''transfers'' were most likely dropouts. A study of big city schools by State Senator Gonzalo Barrientos, a Democrat, found that more incoming ninth graders dropped out than graduated on time.</p>
        <p>Education officials disputed these findings and said the state began a program to track dropouts in 1998. The results will not be known until 2003.</p>
        <p>The rigor of the test has also been questioned. An American Federation of Teachers study found the TAAS to be far easier than its counterpart in New York. The TAAS is supposed to represent a grade-level standard. But state education officials concede that the math portion of the 10th-grade exam is probably an eighth-grade test. Other critics say some questions are closer to sixth grade.</p>
        <p>''The thing we're against is the way the TAAS test has taken over our school,'' said Susan Sarhady, head of a parent's group in Plano, an affluent, largely Republican Dallas suburb. ''In the districts that have high passing rates, parents wonder why we are concentrating so much on the TAAS. It is very boring. There are literally addition problems on the 10th-grade test.''</p>
        <p>Although the state curriculum has become more rigorous under Mr. Bush, the test has not. Many administrators feared that the test would be tougher when the new curriculum was incorporated last year.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Nelson, the education commissioner, wrote a memorandum in October 1999 assuring school administrators that while the test would be more difficult, ''a child who would have passed last year's test will also pass this year's test.''</p>
        <p>How? State officials adjust the score needed to pass, depending on how difficult they judge the test to be. So when the 1999 test included material considered more difficult, fewer correct questions were required to pass.</p>
        <p>''If you make a test harder but you make students answer fewer questions correctly, aren't you just running in place?'' asked Mr. Scott, the Houston education analyst.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nelson said adjusting the  score ensures continuity and fairness so each class is measured against the same standard. He added that in 2003 the state will introduce TAAS II, a more difficult test that will include science and social studies.</p>
        <p>A SAMPLER  10th Grade Math in Texas</p>
        <p>Following are math questions included in the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills given to 10th graders this year.</p>
        <p>1. In 40 baseball games Juan's team has scored 50 runs. If the team continues at this rate, how many runs could the team expect to score in a 160-game season?  A 128  B 170  C 200  D 250</p>
        <p>2. Marlena has a housecleaning business. She charges $4.50 per room and gives a $5 discount to customers who provide their own cleaning supplies. Which equation could be used to find t, the total cost to a customer who has r rooms and who provides the cleaning supplies?  A t = 4.50(r + 5)  B t = 4.50r - 5  C t = 4.50t + 5  D t = 4.50r + 5  E r = 4.50(t - 5)</p>
        <p>3. Andy participated in a neighbor's garage sale. He sold 3 items: a picture frame for $8.50, a teapot for $3.75 and a set of 6 cups for $4.75. What were his total sales?  A. $9.35  B. $15.00  C. $15.90  D. $17.00  E. $23.00</p>
        <p>ANSWERS: 1. C;  2. B;  3. D</p>
