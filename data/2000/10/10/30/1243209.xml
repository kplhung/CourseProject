        <p>Prime Minister Ehud Barak failed today to forge an emergency unity government with the right wing, but he is nonetheless unlikely to face immediate dismissal when Parliament reconvenes Monday after a three-month recess.</p>
        <p>The ultra-Orthodox Shas Party, which pulled out of the government before Mr. Barak went to the Camp David peace talks in July, said today that it would grant the prime minister a temporary ''safety net'' while violence continues to rage between Israeli troops and Palestinians. At least three more Palestinians died in confrontations today.</p>
        <p>In Gaza, Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, said his people would remain steadfast ''until a boy or girl holds the flag of Palestine over Jerusalem, the capital of our future Palestinian state.''</p>
        <p>The reopening session of Parliament is still expected to be stormy. But since Shas has a linchpin 17-vote bloc, its support prevents any immediate parliamentary motion to dissolve the faltering government and provoke a political crisis in the midst of an unsettling diplomatic one.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak's associates say he is chagrined at being rescued by the party that destabilized his coalition. But Shas has bought Mr. Barak time to continue negotiations with the opposition Likud Party or simply to survive a bit longer at the helm of a minority government destined to fall.</p>
        <p>Speaking on Israel Radio, Mr. Barak said Shas's move would allow his government to confront this period of violence ''without being harassed daily'' by the political mood swings of the Parliament.</p>
        <p>Shas leaders offered to extend their guarantee of support for a fixed period -- a month, say -- if Mr. Barak would drop his plans for a ''civil revolution'' that would reduce the power of religious parties and authorities. Given that all of Mr. Barak's plans have been frozen by the Israeli-Palestinian crisis, that demand does not seem to be particularly difficult to meet.</p>
        <p>Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, Shas's influential spiritual leader, declared Mr. Barak's government to be bankrupt in a sermon on Saturday night. But he also endorsed a return to the peace table if the violence ebbed as Israel's only option.</p>
        <p>Earlier today, Mr. Barak said he was closer than ever to forging a political deal with Ariel Sharon, the Likud leader. But a two-hour afternoon meeting between Mr. Barak, who leads the Labor Party, and Mr. Sharon ended without a deal.</p>
        <p>The proposal for a unity government faces intense opposition within both parties -- the Labor peace camp and the Likud nationalist camp, whose ideological differences have blurred during the last month's violence but nonetheless remain.</p>
        <p>American and European allies of Mr. Barak have also urged him to refrain from an alliance that could make it more difficult to revive peace talks. The Arab world holds Mr. Sharon responsible for provoking the current violence by a heavily guarded, politicized visit to the plaza outside Al Aksa Mosque in the Old City of Jerusalem on Sept. 28. Israelis say that visit served as the pretext for a planned uprising.</p>
        <p>Political negotiations between Labor and Likud have snagged on the issues of how power would be shared -- and specifically on whether Mr. Sharon would have a veto over peace moves -- and how the unified government would approach peacemaking if the violence receded.</p>
        <p>Israel Radio said the two men had agreed on a diplomatic program to ''suit the new circumstances that have been created.'' Their agreement would not mention the Oslo interim peace agreement or the Camp David proposals, the radio said. But Mr. Barak said resolutely, ''There will be no veto over the prime minister.''</p>
        <p>A unity government would be a ''survival embrace'' for both men, as a senior opposition figure described it today. It would extend their tenures as party leaders and defer the seemingly inevitable move to new elections, in which both would face challengers in their own parties.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sharon faces the prospect of a political comeback by former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is more popular. And Mr. Barak could face a challenge from Avraham Burg, the speaker of the Parliament. Mr. Burg, a young, religious dove, has kept a critical distance from the prime minister since Mr. Barak took office and is therefore less tainted by his perceived failures than other challengers would be.</p>
        <p>Even if Mr. Barak and Mr. Sharon succeed, any political realignment now would most likely be temporary. An emergency government's future would depend on how protracted the violent confrontations turned out to be, and on whether the Palestinians made a unilateral declaration of statehood in the near future.</p>
        <p>Such a declaration would provoke an Israeli reaction -- like the annexation of Jewish settlement blocs in the West Bank -- and could propel the present low-intensity confrontations into a period of greater conflict.</p>
