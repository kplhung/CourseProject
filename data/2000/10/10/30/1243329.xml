        <p>White House and Congressional negotiators, working into the wee hours of the morning, reached a tentative agreement early today on a spending measure of roughly $112 billion to finance the Labor, Health and Human Services and Education Departments.</p>
        <p>''We have the skeleton of what, to put it in Halloween terms, is going to be a monster bill,'' said Senator Ted Stevens, an Alaska Republican who is chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee.</p>
        <p>The agreement removes a major obstacle that had blocked Congress' adjournment. Congress had already set a post-World War II record for the latest adjournment date in an election year.</p>
        <p>Emerging from their talks around 1 a.m., the negotiators in broad terms said agreements had been struck on thorny issues like delaying implementation of Federal rules intended to protect workers from repetitive motion injuries, how Federal money would be directed to local school districts to hire teachers and to build or renovate school buildings, and whether particular contraceptives may be given out in school clinics.</p>
        <p>Congressional leaders say they hope to tie up details on the measure later today and have the House of Representatives vote on it on Tuesday, with the Senate following suit soon afterwards.</p>
        <p>Under that schedule the House and Senate will have to approve at least one more temporary stop-gap spending measure to keep several government agencies functioning since the legal authority for the Federal government expired with the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30.</p>
        <p>On Sunday the House and the Senate once again passed 24-hour sending bills, or continuing resolutions, that kept parts of the government from shutting down for at least another day. The vote in the House was 342 to 7, and in the Senate it was 67 to 1.</p>
        <p>The negotiators, including officials from the Office of Management and Budget in the White House and the top Republican and Democrats from the House and Senate Appropriations Committees were tight-lipped about the many of the details of the agreement on the bill, which traditionally is the most contentious of the 13 spending bills that are needed to be enacted to keep the Federal government operating.</p>
        <p>But several spoke of a number of the provisions in the measure.</p>
        <p>The negotiators agreed to add $4.4 billion -- about $4.1 billion of which is mainly additional funds for education -- to the measure, bringing it to about $112 billion in discretionary spending. That amount makes the bill the largest domestic spending bill that Congress will approve.</p>
        <p>Much of the wrangling was centered around education issues, specifically, the Administration's proposal to provide money to hire teachers to reduce class size in the lower grades and differences over how to pay for school construction and modernization.</p>
        <p>Another nettlesome issue revolved around rules proposed by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to protect workers from sustaining injuries from repetitive motion work activities. OSHA estimates that nearly 650,000 workers suffer injuries and illness caused by overexertion, repetition and other physical stress.</p>
        <p>But Republicans have asserted that the science is not yet clear on what causes these injuries and that the new regulation could cost businesses billions of dollars to comply. A provision in the spending measure had said that no money could be used to ''promulgate, issue, implement, administer, or enforce any proposed, temporary or final'' regulations in this area.</p>
        <p>Participants said the negotiators agreed today that the agency could promulgate the regulations so that business would know what they would be. But OSHA will delay implementing the regulations, meaning that companies will not be forced to comply with them.</p>
        <p>Participants in today's discussions say they will be delayed until after the next President takes office.</p>
