        <p>One great thing about being the host of a late-night TV talk show is that all your jokes can be shared with millions and millions of people. It cannot be very easy to lose that after having it for decades.</p>
        <p>Perhaps that is why Johnny Carson, the former ''Tonight'' show host, decided out of the blue to submit a parody of Dennis Miller's performance as a ''Monday Night Football'' announcer to The New Yorker magazine.</p>
        <p>In the parody, which was featured in last week's issue under the title ''Proverbs According to Dennis Miller,'' Mr. Carson made fun of Mr. Miller's propensity to make obscure, though seemingly intelligent, references during the course of the games.</p>
        <p>(One of Mr. Carson's 10 proverbs: ''What goes up. . .will stay up if it has an escape velocity of 11.3 kilometers per second.'' Another: ''A rolling stone. . .if not acted upon by any force will keep rolling in a straight line at the same speed.''</p>
        <p>People in the television industry took notice of the parody because it is so rare to hear anything from Mr. Carson. Since he retired, there has been nary a peep out of him.</p>
        <p>Susan Morrison, The New Yorker features editor, said Mr. Carson's submission came unexpectedly. ''Basically, several weeks ago, Steve Martin, who writes for us, called me up and said 'Hey, I saw Johnny Carson last night and he told me he had written a piece, and he would like The New Yorker to consider publishing it,' '' Ms. Morrison said.</p>
        <p>''It arrived a couple of days later, via FedEx, with a nice cover note,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Helen Sanders, an assistant to Mr. Carson, said, ''All that needs to be known is, he started writing some brief, humorous pieces, and he submitted that and it got published.'' She added, ''he very possibly could do more of it.''</p>
        <p>Then again, Mr. Carson may have written the piece as a gift to himself. Last Monday, the day the magazine came out, was his 75th birthday.</p>
