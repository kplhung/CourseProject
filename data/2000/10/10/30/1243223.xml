        <p>Duffy Waldorf did to Tiger Woods what Woods had done to so many others.</p>
        <p>Not even Woods, looking for his 10th victory this year and his fourth in succession, could deny Waldorf today in the spectacular and surprising final round of the National Car Rental Golf Classic. Seldom does anyone shoot a 10-under-par 62 in the final round. Waldorf certainly had never done it. In fact, when he arrived at Walt Disney World Resort this morning, Waldorf was not even thinking about winning this event.</p>
        <p>''I figured I was too far behind,'' said Waldorf, who started the final round six strokes behind the third-round leader, Steve Flesch, and four strokes behind Woods. ''So I kept firing at pins. Lo and behold, I started making birdies.''</p>
        <p>He kept making them and making them, playing the round of his life, winning $540,000 and overtaking Woods, the world's best player, in the process. Shocking Woods, and denying Flesch his first victory on the PGA Tour, Waldorf finished at 26 under par for the tournament (262, 65-66-69-62), one stroke ahead of Flesch (25 under), who shot a 69, and three strokes ahead of Woods (23 under), who also shot a final-round 69 and who missed some crucial putts.</p>
        <p>For Waldorf, 38, a tour veteran from Los Angeles, it was the fourth victory of his career, but it was by far the most memorable. Beating Woods is difficult enough, but rarely does anyone overtake Woods on Sunday as if he were stuck in neutral. Waldorf performed brilliantly, however, tying the tournament scoring record of 26 under par set by John Huston in 1992 and equaling Huston for the tournament's low 18-hole score as well.</p>
        <p>It was a clinic in iron play and putting, as Waldorf locked into a zone on the driving range and remained in that zone until he walked off the 18th green. How hot was Waldorf? He birdied six of the first seven holes on the Magnolia course and shot up the leader board faster than anyone could have imagined.</p>
        <p>While Flesch and Woods were in the day's final threesome, Waldorf took advantage of playing one group ahead of them. Instead of facing Woods eye to eye and worrying about what the leaders were doing, Waldorf focused on the pins and took dead aim. He was not even aware of his standing while coming down the back nine. He refused to look at the leader board and concentrated on his own game instead. The strategy worked. Waldorf took the lead with a birdie at No. 12, then capped the day with a 12-foot birdie putt at No. 18 to seal the victory.</p>
        <p>As for Woods, his round was marked by spotty play, poor putting and missed chances. He missed a 3-foot putt for birdie at No. 4, and he missed a 4-foot putt to make a bogey at No. 6, ending his string of consecutive holes without a bogey at 110. Woods birdied No. 14, but at the same time Waldorf was making birdie on No. 15, keeping a two-stroke advantage.</p>
        <p>Then Woods missed a crucial putt for birdie at No. 16, leaving it one roll short of the cup. That was the last gasp for Woods, who settled for par on the final four holes.</p>
        <p>''You can't win them all,'' said Woods, who can still reach $10 million in tournament earnings this season by winning the Tour Championship, which begins Thursday in Atlanta, followed by the American Express Championship in Spain next month. ''I'd lose sleep if I didn't try, but I tried as hard as I could. I just didn't play well enough. And I lost to a guy who shot 62.''</p>
        <p>It was a difficult loss for Flesch, who has 13 top 10 finishes this year but who is still seeking his first victory as a professional. Flesch fell just short again. After he made an 8-foot birdie putt at No. 17, giving him a chance to tie Waldorf, who had already signed his scorecard, Flesch hit a fine approach shot at par-4 No. 18, leaving himself a 10-foot putt for birdie. If he had made it, Flesch would have forced a playoff with Waldorf, who was watching nervously by the 18th green. But even a short pep talk from Woods did not help Flesch, who missed to the left, allowing Waldorf to begin celebrating.</p>
        <p>''I pushed it,'' Flesch said. ''Tiger told me to knock it in, and I felt good. Unfortunately, that was probably the worst putt I made all week.''</p>
        <p>But for Waldorf, it was a victory he will long remember. He shot the lowest round of his professional career, and for 72 holes he was better than Woods. Coincidentally, Woods on Saturday predicted that somebody would shoot a 62 on Sunday.</p>
        <p>''I guess he was probably thinking about himself shooting 62, I would imagine, not me,'' Waldorf said.</p>
