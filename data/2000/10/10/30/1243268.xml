        <p>Early this month, Mike Keenan returned to Madison Square Garden wearing a Rangers jacket and looking for a new fit. An unemployed hockey coach, Keenan heard cheers in a ceremony honoring 75 seasons of franchise history.</p>
        <p>Although he directed the Rangers to the Stanley Cup in 1994, Keenan washed out of two jobs after that and the gap on his resume had grown, ominously, to almost two years. Did he worry that a call to coach a sixth National Hockey League team would never come?</p>
        <p>''That's always in the back of your mind,'' Keenan said last night, when he returned to Eighth Avenue as the new coach of the Boston Bruins. ''There is always a level of anxiety.''</p>
        <p>The Rangers beat the Bruins by 5-1, leaving Keenan with one victory, one defeat and one regulation tie in three games.</p>
        <p>Iron Mike now has an ironclad one-year contract, with extensions at the team's option. In the past, Keenan created mostly successful records and many bruised feelings in Philadelphia, Chicago, New York, St. Louis and Vancouver. When not also the general manager, he put pressure on people in that position. One was Neil Smith, the Ranger boss in 1994. Keenan has learned his lesson, he said last week.</p>
        <p>''Managers manage,'' Keenan said. ''Coaches coach. Players play.''</p>
        <p>This time his commander is Harry Sinden, who arrived in Boston shortly after the Tea Party and who may never leave, despite frequent hints that he might retire soon and suggestions by some fans that he should. Sinden is set in his ways, which include moderate wages for players and frequent replacements on his coaching staff. Oh, to be a fly on the wall when Keenan visits Sinden's office to tell him to spend more money on better players, to trade 5 or 10 guys, and to do it right away, or else. Will Sinden respect Keenan's input?</p>
        <p>''I think so,'' Keenan said. ''Harry has a level of respect for me.''</p>
        <p>Sinden is a fishing buddy of Glen Sather's, the new cigar-chewing boss of the Rangers. Both Sinden and Sather are anchors of the N.H.L.'s old-boys network. When Sather sought a coach last summer, he floated Keenan's name. Does Keenan think Sather put in a good word with Sinden when Sinden fired Pat Burns last week?</p>
        <p>''Someone behind the scenes, I'm sure, has helped me,'' Keenan said. ''If he did, I appreciate it. I have a lot of respect for Glen. There might have been some influence there.''</p>
        <p>Keenan said that Sinden and Sather are the only two general managers in a 30-team league who would hire Keenan without being told to do so by an owner.</p>
        <p>Earning about $600,000, Keenan is working cheap for this era. With little job security, he cannot be complacent. In the first period last night, after the Rangers scored the first goal of the game, Keenan replaced goalie Andrew Raycroft with Kay Whitmore. It did not make much difference as the Rangers ended a four-game losing streak.</p>
        <p>For Keenan's team, it was the third game in four nights since he took over. He is only beginning to match names with faces and to learn which buttons to push with his personnel. Conditioning, a Keenan trademark, will be measured.</p>
        <p>''Maybe the muscle memory has to be changed a bit because we're playing an upbeat style and high-tempo game,'' he said.</p>
        <p>They played nothing of the sort against the Rangers. The Bruins seemed flat-footed. They lost most of the one-on-one battles. The Rangers were a half-step quicker.</p>
        <p>''We played a desperate team,'' Keenan said. ''We hit a wall, emotionally and physically.''</p>
        <p>Someone asked Keenan whether he was glad to be back. ''Tonight? Not good,'' he replied with a smile. ''Generally speaking, great.''</p>
        <p>Earlier, he said: ''I have such a love for the game and passion for it. You come to realize how much it is part of your life.''</p>
        <p>With a group of reporters in a semicircle around him, an arm poked through to shake Keenan's hand. It belonged to Sather. ''Hi, Glen,'' Keenan said. ''Thank you. Appreciate it very much.''</p>
