        <p>As Gov. George W. Bush spent his last full day in Texas before Election Day, his aides today outlined the dimensions and details of an aggressive final push to reach undecided voters and Republican stalwarts through telephone calls, mail and the use of surrogates.</p>
        <p>Clearly trying to cast Mr. Bush's bid for the presidency as an unstoppable force, they said that about 62 million phone calls and 110 million pieces of mail would reach voters by Nov. 7, the culmination of efforts by the Bush campaign and state Republican parties that began about two weeks ago.</p>
        <p>''We are launching the largest-ever Republican grass-roots effort,'' said Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, in a conference call with reporters today.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fleischer and other Bush aides also said high-profile surrogates including former President George Bush, Barbara Bush, Bob Dole and Elizabeth Dole would hit the campaign trail in full stride this week.</p>
        <p>Both the former president and the former first lady were scheduled to make stops in Florida, including a joint appearance there with their son Jeb, the Florida governor. Their oldest son, the Texas governor, is trying to beat back a surprisingly strong challenge in Florida from Vice President Al Gore.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fleischer emphasized that the Texas governor's itinerary over the first three days of a final, eight-day campaign swing would bring him to several states that were initially expected to be more favorable to Mr. Gore than they turned out to be.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fleischer's obvious intentions were to project an aura of strength around the Bush campaign and to give Mr. Bush the luster of an inevitable winner, images that could sway some undecided voters in the end.</p>
        <p>Between Monday and Wednesday, Mr. Bush's schedule includes stops in California, Oregon, Washington, Minnesota and Iowa.</p>
        <p>And while California in particular remains a long-shot for Mr. Bush, his campaign continues to lavish attention on the nation's most populous state, drawing attention to polls there that are tighter than most political analysts had predicted and making a statement of sorts about the campaign's confidence.</p>
        <p>In fact, Mr. Bush's only public event today was a satellite address to a gathering of California Latinos for Bush in Anaheim Hills. In those remarks, he seized on new language and evidence to press his charge that Mr. Gore's proposed programs would make the federal government too large.</p>
        <p>''My opponent would add between 20 and 30,000 additional federal employees,'' Mr. Bush said, using a figure that the Gore campaign has disputed. In fact, Mr. Gore last week pledged a freeze on the hiring of new federal employees if he is elected president.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Bush said: ''The effort's already begun. The I.R.S. recently announced it's hiring more than 2,000 new employees.''</p>
        <p>''You have to wonder if the administration might be on a hiring spree so they can announce a freeze next year,'' Mr. Bush added.</p>
        <p>Kym Spell, a spokeswoman for the Gore campaign, dismissed that notion, along with any suggestion that Mr. Gore was not committed to a lean federal government.</p>
        <p>''The vice president has been a part of reinventing government and ensuring that we have the smallest federal work force in 30 years,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's father used to talk about the ''Big Mo,'' meaning momentum, and that was clearly what the Bush campaign, encouraged by Mr. Bush's slight lead in several national polls, was trying to signal today. And if they managed to rattle their opponent in the process, all the better.</p>
        <p>As part of that endeavor, Mr. Bush's aides accused Democrats and the Gore campaign of adopting a divisive, negative tone that bespoke desperation. Mr. Fleischer said that Mr. Gore had ''brought politics to an unprecedented low,'' but that the Bush campaign would end their campaign on a positive, inspirational note.</p>
        <p>And yet Mr. Fleischer made several pointed jabs at the vice president, especially when discussing the unexpected potency of Ralph Nader's candidacy.</p>
        <p>''There really is a yearning on the Democratic left for a principled Democrat leader,'' Mr. Fleischer said. ''It's understandable. They haven't found one.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's theme for his last eight days on the campaign trail, starting on Monday, will be ''bringing America together,'' and he will attempt to make the case, as he goes day by day through issue by issue, that he can unite Republicans and Democrats to solve tough problems.</p>
        <p>Part of his argument, aides said, would be that he uses hope to appeal to people while Mr. Gore uses fear.</p>
        <p>Tad Devine, a top strategist with the Gore campaign, said that despite all the Bush campaign's talk about California being competitive, the Gore campaign was on solid ground there.</p>
        <p>He said that the principal reason for a visit that Mr. Gore plans to the state this week is to tape the ''Tonight'' show.</p>
        <p>''We'll win California decisively,'' Mr. Devine said today in a conference call with reporters.</p>
        <p>He went on to note that the Bush campaign has its own troubles in states that it was expected to dominate, citing recent polls in Florida that show Mr. Gore with an edge and signs that Mr. Bush's strong standing in Ohio has softened.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's aides, asserting that they had the campaign well in hand, went into extraordinary detail about some Republicans' activities, noting that Republicans will have planted about 1.2 million yard signs and distributed about 1.5 million bumper stickers by Election Day.</p>
        <p>Additional surrogates on the trail this week, they said, would include the actress Bo Derek and the college football coach Joe Paterno.</p>
