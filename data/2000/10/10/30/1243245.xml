        <p>THE warmth of the Subway Series had vanished. Pro football weather had arrived at Giants Stadium as it always does, on a wind that whips out of a slate-gray sky and flaps the flags atop the upper deck.</p>
        <p>''First wind chill of the season,'' the voice at the press-box microphone said just before the kickoff. ''Thirty-one degrees.''</p>
        <p>The temperature was a reasonable 45 degrees, but the 13 mile-an-hour wind with gusts up to 22 m.p.h. not only made it seem colder, but it also made it more difficult to throw a football. Phil Simms, who completed more passes for more touchdowns through the wind here than anybody else, has always said that learning how to cope with the Giants Stadium wind is the most difficult part of a Giants quarterback's job.</p>
        <p>In the 24-7 victory over the Philadelphia Eagles in yesterday's wind, Kerry Collins more than coped.</p>
        <p>In what Collins called ''the most difficult conditions'' of his two seasons here as the Giants quarterback, he completed 22 of 37 passes for 253 yards, including a 27-yard arrow to Amani Toomer for what proved to be the winning touchdown.</p>
        <p>But if it's more difficult to throw a football in the wind, it's also more difficult to catch it. And with nine receptions for 108 yards and that decisive touchdown, Toomer's stature as the Giants' best wide receiver was rewritten on the wind after he had been benched against the Dallas Cowboys in the game before the bye week.</p>
        <p>''I knew I could play this game,'' Toomer, the 26-year-old wide receiver, said. ''I learned I had to get out there and keep getting better.''</p>
        <p>In his second season after having been the Giants' second-round choice out of Michigan in 1996, Toomer had also been demoted by Fassel.</p>
        <p>''That was different; he didn't know then if I could play,'' Toomer recalled. ''This time he wanted to get me going in the right direction.''</p>
        <p>In 1998 the Giants realized Toomer could play when he caught Kent Graham's 37-yard touchdown pass with 48 seconds remaining, which upset the Denver Broncos, then unbeaten, 20-16. Last season his 79 receptions for 1,183 yards broke two Giants records: Earnest Gray's 78 catches in 1983 and Lionel Manuel's 1,029 yards in 1988.</p>
        <p>But when Toomer, bothered by a slightly pulled hamstring and a sore toe, couldn't seem to get open against the Cowboys, he was benched in the second quarter.</p>
        <p>''I'll take any player out if he's not performing,'' Fassel said yesterday. ''How they respond depends on them. I told him I believed in him. I figured he could either take the challenge or give me the brook-trout look. He took the challenge. If we're going to win and put points on the board, he's got to be part of it.''</p>
        <p>And yesterday, with the wind howling over the western rim of Giants Stadium, slamming into the eastern upper deck and swooping back in a westerly direction along the grassy field, Toomer was a big part of it.</p>
        <p>''It depends which way you're going on the field,'' Fassel said, ''but if you're not used to the wind, it'll carry the ball on you or it will knock the ball down. You tell your receivers that they can't hand-catch it. They've got to cradle it or belly-catch it.''</p>
        <p>By halftime, Toomer, as Collins's favorite target, had caught four passes for 58 yards, including the 27-yard touchdown that caught the Eagles in a blitz.</p>
        <p>''You have to give the guy a lot of credit,'' Collins said. ''He got out of sync, but he worked hard in the bye week and this week. There was a big difference in his play out there. He showed great resolve. I've got a lot of confidence in him. I always have.''</p>
        <p>Now the Giants are 6-2, the same as the Jets.</p>
        <p>And the Giants figure to jump to 7-2 with another victory next Sunday in Cleveland before the high-scoring St. Louis Rams, the reigning Super Bowl champions, come into Giants Stadium the following Sunday.</p>
        <p>Even with Trent Green at quarterback instead of Kurt Warner, out with a broken little finger, the Rams can still score quickly and often. But the Rams' defense has been porous.</p>
        <p>Although the Giants stifled the Eagles in yesterday's wind, the Rams will test their defense. If the Giants are to show they belong with the Rams and other playoff contenders (after having lost to the Redskins and the Titans), they must be able to match the Rams touchdown for touchdown.</p>
        <p>For that to happen, Amani Toomer will have to keep getting open and keep catching Kerry Collins's passes. In or out of the wind.</p>
