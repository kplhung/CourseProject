        <p>With a season of uncertainty two days away, Coach Jeff Van Gundy gathered his team together this morning for a 30-minute state-of-the-Knicks address. He spoke of the necessity for mental toughness and professionalism, unveiled the team's rotation and let his players know that, despite their lack of size, his expectations were as high as ever.</p>
        <p>''I told them that our goal for this year is to make the playoffs and to be the hugest underdog ever in a finals,'' Van Gundy said.</p>
        <p>Even though the Knicks have the smallest starting lineup in the National Basketball Association -- they start a forward at center and a guard at small forward -- Van Gundy believes they have the physical tools to be the best team in the Eastern Conference. The difference between being a challenger or an also-ran, he said, will be mental toughness.</p>
        <p>''Our challenge is much more mental than physical,'' Van Gundy said. ''Everybody uses the cliche, 'It's a marathon, not a sprint,' when talking about the N.B.A. regular season. But like I said to these guys today, 'If you've ever watched a marathon, they sprint for 26 straight miles because they've conditioned themselves to sprint, both mentally and physically.' ''</p>
        <p>For Van Gundy, sprinting includes playing well on the second night of back-to-back games, playing well through nagging aches and pains, being supportive of teammates, being serious and professional in the locker room, and holding teammates accountable for working hard and being on time.</p>
        <p>While Van Gundy did not single out Latrell Sprewell, who has often been 10 or 15 minutes late for home games, Marcus Camby, Sprewell's best friend on the team, did.</p>
        <p>''We can't have Latrell coming late to ballgames,'' said Camby, who said that his lower back pain would not keep him out of Tuesday's opener against Philadelphia. ''And we players can't be scared to approach him and say something about it. Jeff can't always police us. We have to police ourselves.''</p>
        <p>Van Gundy also committed himself to an eight-man rotation. It includes the starters Sprewell at small forward, Camby at center, Charlie Ward at point guard, Allan Houston at shooting guard and Larry Johnson at power forward, along with the reserves Glen Rice, Kurt Thomas and Chris Childs. He said those players would play every night, but that the others, including Erick Strickland, would be on call.</p>
        <p>Strickland, who started at shooting guard for Dallas last season, was disappointed but cooperative. He will be a free agent after the season, which makes his position tougher to handle since he is, in a sense, auditioning for a contract with the Knicks or another team for next season.</p>
        <p>''I'm in a situation where we have three All-Stars at the same position -- Glen, Latrell and Allan,'' Strickland said. ''I'm the odd man out and that's just the way it is. But I love the guys and this is a great opportunity to win. I'll just have to support the guys and play well when the opportunities come.''</p>
