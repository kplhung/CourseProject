        <p>To open the National Basketball Association season, a doubleheader on TNT tomorrow night has been advertised hard by the cable network: Knicks-Sixers in an Eastern Conference donnybrook followed by Lakers-Blazers in a rematch of the Western Conference finals.</p>
        <p>Spree vs. Iverson at the Garden. Shaq and Kobe, trying to saw in half the Portland timber. Be there, the whole shebang.</p>
        <p>On some levels, it is the best the N.B.A. can offer today -- genuine rivalries and stars worth paying to see. Yet once you get past the theater on the floor, the real, opening-night story line emerges:</p>
        <p>Welcome to a another riveting season, where roughly three teams in the West can win the championship,  Elden Campbell is one of the premier big men in the Eastern Conference and Allen Iverson's controversial new CD hits stores in February.</p>
        <p>You shouldn't hate this game. But you should be worried about it.</p>
        <p>For instance, call up America Online, click ''Pro Basketball,'' and this is what you get: ''Arbitrator to Decide if Smith's Contract Could Be Voided'' and ''Strickland Charged After Refusing to Leave Restaurant'' sandwiched around ''Utah's Stockton Still Going Strong Entering 17th Season.''</p>
        <p>Nowhere can you find a more indicting story about the state of the league than the Joe Smith contract fiasco. Never mind the details, it is really about a ruthless agent who coaxed a frightened owner into signing an under-the-table agreement for . . . a decent role player.</p>
        <p>Joe Smith is not Kevin Garnett. Smith may go down as one of the bigger No. 1 pick disappointments of all time, right up there with Pervis Ellison in 1989. But he was somehow worth circumventing the salary cap, breaking the rules, costing Minnesota five No. 1 draft picks, cash and perhaps its competitive future.</p>
        <p>Then there's Rod Strickland, in some kind of scrape with the law again, charged with refusing to leave a restaurant that was being shut by fire marshals. It may be a misunderstanding. But here is the harsh truth about the Wizards' point guard: One of the most artistic and skilled players of his era is still too stubborn to realize he has just about thrown away what could have been a Hall of Fame career. He was that good.</p>
        <p>Then you have John Stockton, 38, the pasty-faced point guard with the too-short shorts, plugging along with 37-year-old Karl Malone on the team that time forgot, their success and longevity minimized by the fact that they are both seen as too fundamental (read: boring) to capture a market share anymore.</p>
        <p>It does not stop there. Iverson releases a hard-core rap single that is misogynistic, homophobic and punctuated by gunshots -- just like his gangsta rap heroes Jay-Z and DMX. He is seen as ''keeping it real,'' not conforming to the N.B.A. that David Stern wants to sell. This is the N.B.A. in which it is O.K. to be hard and from the inner city -- in fact, N.B.A. Entertainment will even cooperate with videos -- as long as you don't bring too much of that life with you to upset the paying white customers.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, in somewhat related news, Smith's agent, Eric Fleisher, is still in court with his former protege, Andy Miller, whom Fleisher is alleging stole his business. What a business, huh?</p>
        <p>Miller is another young barracuda whose main concern is how much cut his client can procure him. These are the people who disturbingly have influence in the N.B.A., who hear about this young kid tearing up the West Fourth Street courts during a summer tournament and immediately sink their teeth in.</p>
        <p>I watched a very talented 16-year-old play there this summer. His name is Lenny Cook, a 6-foot-7-inch left-handed kid who clearly had the gift. He was named the top newcomer at the annual ABCD camp, one of the premier cattle calls for teenage prospects put on by the longtime sneaker guru Sonny Vaccaro.</p>
        <p>''Mr. Sonny calls me all the time now,'' Cook told me after his summer league game. Because Mr. Sonny is an Adidas man, and may be trying to funnel a schoolboy talent toward one of his agent friends who represent Adidas clients. Because if Mr. Sonny does not, Nike will.</p>
        <p>Cook seemed like a nice, impressionable young kid. Other than punting the basketball over the fence and on top of a neighboring brownstone after his team lost, he looked like a good sport. But he is already immersed in a culture that is telling him he is better than he is, enough so that he will reach a Division I school not with a sense of privilege but rather with a sense of entitlement.</p>
        <p>Because of his special gift, he will be treated better than schoolmates who may go to M.I.T. and one day work for NASA or develop antibodies for incurable diseases. If he is good enough, he will end up in the N.B.A. before he finishes his education.</p>
        <p>The biggest lament of many N.B.A. coaches today? How many times they have to tell a young player what to do. They are still teaching the game to unproven millionaires in baggy jeans who have yet to learn their trade. Nineteen-year-old Darius Miles, taken third in the draft by the Clippers and thereby becoming the highest high school player ever picked, has four teammates who are 20. Who is he going to learn the N.B.A. life from?</p>
        <p>As Byron Scott, the new coach of the Nets, said last week: ''In my day, you had to tell me once. That was it.''</p>
        <p>At the All-Star Game last February in San Francisco, the league put on an impressive technology summit that brought some of the top names in the dot-com world together. But it almost seemed out of place.</p>
        <p>I have mentioned this before, and maybe it is too idealistic. But as the dawn of a new season begins, why can't Stern and Billy Hunter, the head of the players union, call for a basketball summit -- a panel of agents, coaches, sneaker pitchmen, old-school and new-jack players -- to figure out what went wrong and how to fix it, to bring back the sublime choreography of teamwork that left room for great one-on-one players to flourish while also capturing a public's imagination?</p>
        <p>The magic has been gone for a while -- along with Michael and Larry. It is time to stop pretending.</p>
        <p>You can't rely on Shaq, Kobe and Vince to sell the product for the next 10 years. They need help from more than their All-Star peers; they need the people who make money off their sweat and skill to forget about the profits and think about the future of the game. Before no one is watching.</p>
        <p>Stern loves to bring up the television ratings declines throughout sports, as if the N.B.A. is merely stuck in some economic downturn unrelated to its product. No, David, it's not that. The public doesn't embrace your players as they once did, for reasons that begin before they come into the N.B.A. People don't talk about your league as passionately anymore. All the slick packaging  cannot obscure that.</p>
        <p>On nights like tomorrow, when Kobe is levitating beneath the rim and the Garden is full of noise and hope, you can still love this game. But it is getting harder and harder.</p>
