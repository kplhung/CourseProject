        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I was dismayed to see yet another article about the plight of the rich and richer in New York City and their quest for the perfect private school (''For $300 an Hour, Advice on Courting Elite Schools,'' news article, Oct. 25).</p>
        <p>My daughter will be entering ninth grade in the fall, and I, along with most of her classmates and their parents, have been on a monthlong search for a decent, never mind perfect, public high school. For the most part, zoned high schools throughout the city are overcrowded, understaffed and underachieving.</p>
        <p>Those of us desiring more for our children are forced to apply to a handful of magnet and collaborative schools offering better choices of education. Each year, these schools become more and more competitive as their reputation grows. Our attention should be on the plight of middle-class New Yorkers, who are and always have been the mainstay of the city.</p>
