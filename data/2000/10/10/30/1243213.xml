        <p>Two days ago, Virginia Tech's Dave Meyer was Michael Vick's fishing buddy and invisible backup, Georgia Tech's George Godsey was better known as the brother of Gary, who started two games early in the season at quarterback for Notre Dame, and ''victory right'' was a desperation play that Northwestern practiced often but had hoped never to use. Oh yeah, and Nebraska was the top-ranked team in the nation.</p>
        <p>It is getting redundant to say what a wild weekend in college football it was, but at least this past week there was some variation. Now most college fans know these new names and saw their spectacular efforts crash the highlight reel.</p>
        <p>Three months ago, Meyer was helping Vick answer his fan mail. Three weeks ago, he was summoned from the locker room after the Boston College game. He had not played, but reporters wanted to know what makes Vick Vick?</p>
        <p>Meyer answered them as coolly as he saved the Hokies' season against Pittsburgh on Saturday when his friend and the Heisman Trophy front-runner went down before halftime with a sprained right ankle. Meyer was 7 of 13 for 114 yards and, on the final drive, threw passes of 12, 11 and 11 yards for first downs to set up Carter Warley's 27-yard field goal with 16 seconds left for a 37-34 victory over the Panthers.</p>
        <p>This time after the game, reporters wanted to know what makes Meyer Meyer? After making backup quarterbacks everywhere proud, he credited his heroics to his 8-0 teammates. It was a wise move; they may need each other. Vick will be in a walking cast until at least Wednesday and it is uncertain whether he will play against Miami on Saturday.</p>
        <p>''I was confident,'' the fifth-year senior said. ''I've run this offense here for five years. I was ready to roll. I can't say enough about the way everyone hung together, kept their composure and kept doing the things that have made us successful. It was a good testament to this team.''</p>
        <p>What George Godsey did was ruin a season for previously undefeated Clemson and reduce this week's Tigers game with Florida State into a battle of one-loss teams coached by a couple of guys named Bowden: son Tommy of Clemson versus father Bobby of the Seminoles.</p>
        <p>George Godsey had not received as much attention as Gary did when he filled in for an injured Arnaz Battle at Notre Dame early in the season, though George had led the Yellow Jackets to a 5-2 record. But that changed Saturday when, with seven seconds left, he fired a 16-yard touchdown pass that Kerry Watkins snagged with one hand to give Georgia Tech a 31-28 victory over Clemson.</p>
        <p>It was Godsey's third touchdown pass, the second in the final seven minutes, and it capped a school-record 454-yard passing day for the quarterback. ''We just happened to have the ball last,'' Georgia Tech Coach George O'Leary said after Tech (6-2) dropped Clemson to 8-1.</p>
        <p>Northwestern Coach Randy Walker also reverted to coach-speak in explaining how his Wildcats (6-2) converted on five fourth-down plays to rally from a 35-14 deficit and beat Minnesota, 41-35.</p>
        <p>''Someone who invented this game gave us four downs, so you might as well use them,'' he said.</p>
        <p>None was more timely than the final play of the game when, with the Wildcats facing fourth-and-2 at the Gopher 45-yard line, Northwestern called ''victory right.'' Quarterback Zak Kustok threw deep to the right corner of the end zone, where Kunle Patrick batted the ball to an open Sam Simmons for the game-winning touchdown.</p>
        <p>Walker, whose team is now bowl eligible, swore that his team not only practiced the play, but had gotten extremely good at executing it. ''I'll bet you we hit it 80 percent of the time,'' he said. ''I'll bet you we hit it five of the last six weeks.''</p>
        <p>No matter how dramatic and entertaining these college offerings, they were merely lounge acts for this past weekend's headliner: the Oklahoma Sooners. By thumping Nebraska, 31-14, they are now the nation's top-ranked team in the writers and coaches polls, as well as in the New York Times computer ranking.</p>
        <p>The Sooners (7-0) also sent a new name into college football's consciousness, one Josh Heupel, a soft-armed, slow-footed but deceptively proficient quarterback. The senior tosses awkwardly off his back foot, and his passes wobble and seem to take forever to come down. Still, Heupel threw for 300 yards and a touchdown against Nebraska.</p>
        <p>Even his coach, Bob Stoops, chuckled when trying to explain Heupel's success. But he wants everyone to know his quarterback is a legitimate Heisman Trophy candidate and is not being propped up by a pass-happy offense.</p>
        <p>''There's a touch,'' Stoops said. ''The kid's blessed. You can critique it all you want, it's there. He anticipates things. The whole country saw this game, and how he led us to victory in a big way. He's a winner and everything you want in a quarterback.''</p>
        <p>So, for a weekend at least, college football belonged to the backup, the overlooked brother, the trick bomb and the unorthodox lobber. Not a bad Saturday.</p>
