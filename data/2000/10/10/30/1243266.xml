        <p>THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA  Correction:  November 6, 2000, Monday  An entry in the Addenda listing with the Advertising column last Monday about two executives who were named to posts at CCG.XM, the global e-business unit of the Cordiant Communications Group, misstated the former post of Thurston Yates, director for creative services. He had been associate creative director, not creative director, at the New York office of Zentropy Partners.</p>
