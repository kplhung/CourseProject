        <p>A loves B, who loves C, who loves D, although C once claimed to love B, who eventually decides that A is not so bad after all.</p>
        <p>In the sentimental scheme of things, these would hardly be affairs to remember. Nonetheless in ''Weren't We Fools?'' the choreographer Christian Holder takes this whiff of a plot, makes ingenious use of mainly unfamiliar Cole Porter songs and comes up with an elegant crowd pleaser for American Ballet Theater.</p>
        <p>With its mix of ballroom and ballet partnering and its white-tie-and-tails ensemble, the ballet had a grand atmospheric sweep at its premiere on Friday night at City Center. A second cast of principals on Saturday night gave it more dramatic snap.</p>
        <p>But in both performances the ballroom image was persuasively sustained as a metaphor for emotional expression. Within the tangos, waltzes, social-dance embraces and partner swapping, a tale was told.</p>
        <p>At first glance Mr. Holder would seem to have been inspired by Antony Tudor's two celebrated ballets about similar emotional entanglements, ''Jardin aux Lilas'' and ''Dim Lustre.'' Yet because his style and his music are so different, his ballet takes on a life of its own.</p>
        <p>Mr. Holder is more moralist than romantic. ''Les Liaisons Dangereuses,'' his 1993 work for Ballet Theater, was inspired by its cruel and ironic French literary source. Here, too, adultery is not winked at.</p>
        <p>A, the husband, wins back his wife, B, because her lover, C, has decided to stick with his mistress, D. There is, however, more than one twist in Mr. Holder's clever concept.</p>
        <p>What would otherwise be a drawn-out exposition of ballroom dancing on toe becomes a play between words and dance.</p>
        <p>Lyrics that the heroine directs to her lover, which are sung by Lynne Halliday, the onstage vocalist and the heroine's alter ego, take on a very different meaning when they are directed to the betrayed husband.</p>
        <p>In a similar vein, when the heroine and the lover act out their affair, it is presumably a flashback because the lyrics of the title song, ''Weren't We Fools?,'' refer to the past. Yet the intensity of emotion is real. We see the duet that embodies the affair. When the husband sees it as well, and the heroine is flustered, her rekindled love blends into the past affair.</p>
        <p>For Porter buffs, the ballet will have the special interest of archival material brought to light by the Porter expert Judy Brown, who arranged and orchestrated the music.</p>
        <p>The title song is one that the program describes as rediscovered. It is part of a 14-item medley that includes unpublished works like ''Am I in Love?'' and staples like ''I've Got You Under My Skin,'' which are spliced into the unfamiliar material.</p>
        <p>How to approach that material seems to be a matter of temperament. Mr. Holder, a former star with the Joffrey and a well-known costume designer, has created beautiful 1930's Jean Harlow-style gowns for the women. He also knows how to use theatrical symbols: the lover has a white flower in his lapel, and the husband a red one. Clifton Taylor continues the 1930's movie mood with Hollywood-style lighting and a starry sky that lights up on cue.</p>
        <p>The two casts were excellent but different. Susan Jaffe, gorgeous in a purple gown (Ms. Halliday wore a similar hue), was highly passionate on Friday as The Woman. Clearly torn between the two men in her life, she looked understandably worried and gave the choreography's abstracted mime, numerous lifts and forceful turns a desperate dynamism.</p>
        <p>Carlos Molina as Her Husband, who had the first loving duet with her, had similar nervous energy, electric in its despair.</p>
        <p>Ethan Stiefel, fragmented in his movement, cut an outsider's figure as Her Former Lover. Porter's music fits him like a glove, especially in the show business veneer he offered in his solo. Tender with Ms. Jaffe, he seemed like one of Thomas Hardy's heroes, caught in a web of missed connections. Stella Abrera, stunning as His Mistress, gave the rococo twists of the spooling choreography a courtesan's flair. Mr. Stiefel looked as captivated as viewers could be by Ms. Abrera's performance.</p>
        <p>The Saturday evening cast was better integrated. Angel Corella as Her Former Lover was more of a cad, dazzling in the speedy polish of his turns and fluidity. Julie Kent was a serene Woman, less agitated and more repentant when abandoned by her lover. Brian Reeder had an all-American elegance as a husband who did not know what hit him. His body language telegraphed dejection all the way. The surprise was Jennifer Alexander, looking like a young Agnes Moorehead and radiating some of that actress's wit as a sly and playful Mistress. David Briskin conducted, and the five pairs in the superb ensemble had some of the best choreography.</p>
        <p>There were other debuts to note: Mr. Corella, fine and feisty but a pouting child in the title role of George Balanchine's ''Prodigal Son,'' and Paloma Herrera, too short-legged and knuckling in her toe work to sustain the line of the Siren. At Friday's performance, they had improved over their debuts on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>That evening Gillian Murphy, especially secure, and Maxim Belotserkovsky glittered in Balanchine's ''Theme and Variations.'' Giuseppe Picone and Marcelo Gomes gallantly flanked Irina Dvorovenko, brilliant on all counts, in Harald Lander's ''Etudes.''</p>
