        <p>Tim Duncan has always been an iconoclast, spurning convention and perception. He pierces his tongue like a 20-something East Village hipster yet shoots bank shots as if he were playing for John Wooden, circa 1959. He has an old-school mind, sometimes nurturing, sometimes clashing with his Generation X peers.</p>
        <p>But Duncan, the San Antonio Spurs' center, genuinely set himself apart from his National Basketball Association contemporaries this summer.</p>
        <p>He did not sell his home. He did not pack his bags. Duncan, coming back from knee surgery and the disappointment of last season, remained in San Antonio, the small-market city he led to a championship in 1999.</p>
        <p>''Tim staying here was pretty big for us,'' Spurs Coach Gregg Popovich said in an understatement as cavernous as the Alamodome. ''Yep, you could say that.''</p>
        <p>Not since the Great Free Agent Summer of 1996 -- when Shaquille O'Neal led a bevy of defections by leaving Orlando and signing with the Los Angeles Lakers -- have so many top-tier players changed addresses. Patrick Ewing moved to Seattle; Glen Rice found a new home in New York; Grant Hill went to Orlando; Eddie Jones to Miami; and Shawn Kemp went back to the Pacific Northwest, where he will play for Portland.</p>
        <p>''No one ever figured Patrick would leave New York, and no one ever figured Grant Hill would actually leave Detroit,'' Gary Payton, the Seattle SuperSonics' All-Star point guard, said recently. ''Now you got guys going here, other cats going there. You need an instruction booklet to tell you where everybody is at.</p>
        <p>''Not that we don't realize it was a business before, but you found out real quick how much of one it is now.''</p>
        <p>Amid a changing landscape, the N.B.A. season begins tomorrow night with what could be a Western Conference title preview in Portland: the Trail Blazers and the Lakers renewing their theatrical rivalry from last June.</p>
        <p>No team put more effort into throttling the Lakers over the summer than the Trail Blazers, who walked around in stunned disbelief after giving back a 15-point, fourth-quarter lead and throwing away Game 7 of the conference finals to the Lakers last June in Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>With clear purposes in mind -- pushing O'Neal away from the basket, keeping Kobe Bryant away from the rim -- Portland reloaded in the middle. They acquired Kemp, Dale Davis and Will Perdue, a virtual three-headed, Shaq-proof monster, with 18 fouls to give.</p>
        <p>In other featured openers tomorrow night, the Ewing-less Knicks will be host to Allen Iverson and Philadelphia, and an Indiana team Reggie Miller barely recognizes travels to San Antonio.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday night in Miami, Pat Riley will try to become the second coach in league history to record his 1,000th victory when the Heat plays Orlando. Riley, 55, who begins the season with a record of 999-434, would enter territory crossed only by Lenny Wilkens, who begins his first year as coach of the Toronto Raptors with a record of 1,179-981.</p>
        <p>Some of the more prominent roster overhauls involved the Knicks, the Heat and the Pacers.</p>
        <p>As part of the Ewing deal, the Knicks added Rice and Luc Longley. Longley, Travis Knight and Felton Spencer will try to fill the gaping hole left by No. 33.</p>
        <p>Riley remade the Heat, acquiring Jones and Anthony Mason, his former hard-headed pupil in New York, from Charlotte for Jamal Mashburn and P. J. Brown. He also swung a deal for Portland's rugged forward, Brian Grant. Riley appeared to be putting together his first finals team since he was in New York in 1994 when misfortune struck. Alonzo Mourning was lost for the season with a kidney ailment, opening the door in the parity stricken East.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the Pacers took a decided step back after their first N.B.A. finals appearance. Never mind that Isiah Thomas is taking over for Larry Bird; three-fifths of Indiana's starting lineup -- Mark Jackson left for Toronto, Rik Smits retired and Davis went to Portland -- is gone, along with the veteran Chris Mullin. The youngsters Jermaine O'Neal, Jonathan Bender and Al Harrington may play major minutes alongside Miller and Jalen Rose.</p>
        <p>''Last year, we used to laugh at teams like we have now,'' Miller told a group of reporters last week in Indianapolis. ''They were athletic, but after four quarters we would have our way with them. Now we're the team we used to beat up on.''</p>
        <p>Eight new coaches make their debuts this week. Besides Wilkens in Toronto and Thomas in Indiana, Leonard Hamilton took over in Washington; Alvin Gentry inherited a kiddie corps Los Angeles Clippers team; Dave Cowens went to Golden State; Sidney Lowe to Vancouver; Lon Kruger to Atlanta; and Byron Scott was hired to try to resuscitate the Nets.</p>
        <p>If the summer was busy, it was also especially unkind to the Georgetown big-man fraternity.</p>
        <p>Ewing endured open pleas for his ouster from his critics among New York fans and the news media, especially after an initial trade that would have sent him to Seattle fell through. Dikembe Mutombo contracted malaria during a visit to his home in the Republic of Congo and is just beginning to regain his strength.</p>
        <p>Mourning's kidney disorder, focal glomerulosclerosis, was the most numbing and serious development of all. He will be treated with medication but could eventually require dialysis or a transplant. His illness was discovered during a routine preseason physical after Mourning returned from Australia, where he helped the United States Olympic team win a gold medal.</p>
        <p>''The toughest thing is not being able to play right now, not being able to do something I want to do,'' Mourning said on Thursday during a charity fund-raiser.</p>
        <p>Tim Hardaway, the Miami Heat point guard, said: ''Without Zo, everything changes. Everything.''</p>
        <p>Before Mourning's illness, the Knicks seemed too small to match up with a team featuring a front line of Mourning, Grant and Mason. Now they are merely another fuel-injected, undersize contender, not unlike Milwaukee, Philadelphia, Indiana and Orlando, which, although it lost out on Duncan, acquired Tracy McGrady to go alongside Hill.</p>
        <p>The sad state of affairs in the Eastern Conference was typified best in recent comments by Paul Silas and Dan Issel. Silas, the Charlotte Hornets' coach, said the often placid and inconsistent Elden Campbell had a chance to be the best center in the East. And he meant it. Issel said that if the talent-challenged Nuggets played in the East, they would be a playoff team.</p>
        <p>Vince Carter returns as not only the most thrilling player in the game, but the Toronto All-Star forward also  has a crew capable of swinging the pendulum in the East. The Raptors signed Jackson to direct traffic at the point and gained more size in their frontcourt when they traded Doug Christie to Sacramento for forward Corliss Williamson.</p>
        <p>Many teams improved on paper, but perhaps none more than the Spurs, whose success in persuading Duncan to stay in San Antonio remains the biggest off-season coup. In fact, the Spurs improved at several positions in order to make a run at their second title in three years. Sean Elliott is completely recovered from a kidney transplant, and Derek Anderson and Danny Ferry were added to a deep and talented roster.</p>
        <p>''I think we added exactly what we needed,'' Popovich said.</p>
        <p>Referring to the Lakers and the Blazers, he said: ''I think we can play with them, but we have to prove that on the court. We are a very similar team to the one that won a championship and that fared very well against Portland and L.A.''</p>
        <p>Faced with declining ratings, the N.B.A. is facing another crucial test. Ownership in Minnesota circumvented the salary cap and was punished severely.</p>
        <p>Iverson's controversial rap lyrics produced a recent stream of negative publicity. Commissioner David Stern is still putting on the best face possible two seasons after Michael Jordan's retirement.</p>
        <p>Stern said on Thursday that he thought this would be the season the players focused on the task of getting past the ''post-lockout, post-Michael syndrome.''</p>
        <p>Stern can still turn to a young, charismatic cast of stars in Los Angeles, where the best two players in the league have a nice synergy going. The Lakers felt good enough about their chemistry to gamble on Isaiah Rider, a player routinely up for the title of No. 1 knucklehead.</p>
        <p>O'Neal and Bryant do not have just Phil Jackson's guidance to help them repeat. Horace Grant, O'Neal's former front-line teammate in Orlando, replaces A. C. Green at power forward. And Rider adds points in the backcourt.</p>
        <p>''One thing we're going to learn early is that if we want to do this one more time, we need to go out and do things the hard way,'' said Ron Harper, the veteran Lakers guard who won three titles in Chicago with Jordan. ''Everybody is waiting for you. Other teams are going to go out and go hard every game against us. Yes, we can repeat. But we need to have a good regular season. We can't turn it on at the end.''</p>
