        <p>Cole Leaves Yemeni Port For Long Journey Home  The destroyer Cole limped away from the Aden harbor almost two and a half weeks after 17 sailors were killed in an explosion. The Navy prepared to lift the 8,600-ton ship onto the deck of a chartered Norwegian salvage ship for the five-week voyage home.</p>

        <p>Despite clues suggesting that the Cole was bombed by Islamic militants, American investigators lack concrete evidence and are wary of inflaming political turmoil in the Middle East by making unsubstantiated accusations, officials said.</p>

        <p>Drug War Nibbles at a Border  The Brazilian government is stepping up surveillance in a remote corner of the Amazon that sits on the frontiers of Brazil, Peru and Colombia, driven by a concern that the $1.3 billion the United States has promised Colombia to help its army may send the war against drug traffickers spilling into Brazil.</p>

        <p>Small Mutiny in Peru  An Peruvian Army officer declared a mutiny in an effort to press President Alberto K. Fujimori to resign. The armed forces and the police continued to seek the seizure of Mr. Fujimori's former spy chief, Vladimiro Montesinos.</p>

        <p>Fraying Relations in Jakarta  Relations between the United States and Indonesia have deteriorated rapidly after a series of high-profile disputes between the American ambassador and Indonesian officials. The United States Embassy has closed its doors to the public.</p>

        <p>Moderate Ahead in Kosovo  The moderate Kosovo Albanian leader claimed victory in Kosovo's first postwar elections, and more militant parties formed by members of the separatist rebels appeared to have fared poorly, according to unofficial early results.</p>

        <p>No Unity Coalition for Barak  Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel failed to forge an emergency unity government with the right wing, but is unlikely to face dismissal when Parliament reconvenes, as the ultra-Orthodox Shas Party said it would grant a temporary ''safety net'' while violence continues between Israelis and Palestinians.</p>

        <p>Gore Campaign Challenges Bush's Ability to Be Leader  Vice President Al Gore's wife and his running mate -- but not Mr. Gore himself -- portrayed Gov. George W. Bush as too inexperienced to be president, an argument the Gore campaign hopes will help derail the Bush candidacy. Mr. Gore cast the presidential election as a chance for people to reject the influence of special interests, saying at a rally in Michigan, ''This country belongs to you, and I want to give it back to you.''</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's aides detailed plans for a last push to reach undecided voters as well as Republicans through telephone calls, mail and the use of surrogates like former President Bush, Barbara Bush, Bob Dole and Elizabeth Dole on the campaign trail.</p>
        <p>A15</p>
        <p>Prominent Democrats say Mr. Gore needs to spend the rest of his campaign promoting his role in the administration's economic successes. They say he has not capitalized on what they see as his best selling point: that he has the record and skill to keep the economy strong.</p>
        <p>A15</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore are trying to convince the rest of the world that each of them would step lightly in foreign affairs. Beneath their words, however, lie very different priorities, and probably very different styles, in managing America's relations with allies and enemies.</p>

        <p>Environmental, abortion-rights and gay-rights advocates kicked off a five-state tour aimed at persuading people thinking of voting for Ralph Nader that they should vote for Mr. Gore instead.</p>

        <p>Congress Stuck in Stalemate  The House and the Senate, meeting in unusual Sunday sessions, once again approved temporary stopgap spending bills to keep major portions of the federal government operating for another 24 hours. The measures came as Congressional and administration negotiators made little progress toward agreement on the last spending and tax bills in the federal budget.</p>

        <p>Protest in Death Penalty Case  Mexico has sent a formal protest to the State Department in an effort to prevent the execution of a Mexican citizen, scheduled in two weeks. The move is an example of the increasing intervention by foreign governments in death penalty cases.</p>

        <p>Voter Turnout Seen as Key To Winning New York Race  The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll found that Hillary Rodham Clinton's lead over Representative Rick A. Lazio in the Senate race is about the same as the previous poll reported in September, and her prospects are very much dependent on how many of her supporters turn out to vote.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>The state Republican Committee said its telephone campaign on behalf of Mr. Lazio would no longer include calls that referred to the bombing of the destroyer Cole to try to suggest that some of Mrs. Clinton's donors supported terrorism. State party officials said the campaign would continue with other calls, including some, aimed at Jewish voters, that question Mrs. Clinton's commitment to Israel.</p>
        <p>B1</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton said she respected Islam and did not intend to offend Muslim Americans when her campaign decided last week to return political contributions from members of a Muslim American organization.</p>

        <p>Voting Advice From Pulpit  Archbishop Edward M. Egan urged the New York Archdiocese's 2.4 million Roman Catholic parishioners to vote for candidates who ''share our commitment to fundamental rights for the unborn.''</p>

They are scheduled to lift off from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan tomorrow.</p>
