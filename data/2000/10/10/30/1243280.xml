        <p>STAY AFLOAT -- Without forward Keith Van Horn, who is recovering from a broken leg for at least the first month of the season, the Nets have to be extra sharp to make sure they are not eliminated from the playoffs in November. They need to continue to play the stingy defense the new coach Byron Scott has installed, and find their offensive chemistry in a hurry, even if it is makeshift, until Van Horn and the backup shooting guard Lucious Harris return. Considering the Nets do not have a dominating center and will rely heavily on young players, anything near .500 could be enough to prevent them from gasping for air the first month.</p>

        <p>STAY AFLOAT -- Without forward Keith Van Horn, who is recovering from a broken leg for at least the first month of the season, the Nets have to be extra sharp to make sure they are not eliminated from the playoffs in November. They need to continue to play the stingy defense the new coach Byron Scott has installed, and find their offensive chemistry in a hurry, even if it is makeshift, until Van Horn and the backup shooting guard Lucious Harris return. Considering the Nets do not have a dominating center and will rely heavily on young players, anything near .500 could be enough to prevent them from gasping for air the first month.</p>
        <p>STAY HOT -- What is Kendall Gill eating? The rest of the Nets should have what he's having. Gill shot 62 percent in the preseason, knocking down shots and keeping his elbow -- something he discovered in reviewing film from his last two dismal shooting seasons when he averaged 40.6 percent. He returned to his natural shooting guard position from small forward with a hefty $7 million-plus paycheck and he has been more than worth that so far. Elbow in, Nets have a chance to win. Nice ring to it, but how long can he hold it?</p>
        <p>STAY A STAR -- His teammates tease him good-naturedly by calling him Starbury, but Stephon Marbury is still the key to the Nets. One of the pre-eminent young point guards in the league, he has held back a bit in the preseason, but he always picks it up when it counts. Scott wants Marbury to remember to stay positive when his teammates are not ready for his passes or do not clear the lane in time. This is his team and Scott has given him the direction to run it. Named to the N.B.A. third team last season, this could be his first all-star season.</p>
        <p>STAY TENACIOUS -- The Nets were wondering whether they had won gold or gold plate in the lottery when their No. 1 pick Kenyon Martin had a disappointing preseason. He rebounded at the end, but while he still needs to get into shape. His aggressiveness and rapid development are crucial. He is joined in the rookie ranks by Stephen Jackson, who is largely an unknown. But not for long. The free agent went from training-camp hopeful to starter in four weeks. Jackson is a sparkling offensive talent, who, if he continues to learn and be hungry on defense, can give the Nets an unlikely boost.</p>
        <p>STAY HEALTHY -- The Nets could do all of the above and none of it would matter if they sustain another devastating injury, which seems to be the heritage of this snakebitten franchise. Jayson Williams retired because of a leg injury, Kerry Kittles is most likely out for the season rehabilitating from knee surgery. The Nets already lost key reserve Jamie Feick through at least January to Achilles' surgery. And Keith Van Horn is out for at least a month. Last season the Nets lost 272 man games to injury, fourth-worst in the league.</p>
