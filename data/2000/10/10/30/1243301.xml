        <p>CUSHING - Harry Cooke IV. Passed away on October 24, 2000 suddenly after a short illness at age 76. Vanderbilt scion, accomplished polo player and world traveler, he will be remembered by all who came in contact with him for his strength of character, penetrating wit, voluminous historical recall and an aristocratic lifestyle long forgotten. He is survived by a son, Harry Cooke Cushing V, a daughter-in-law Laure, and two granddaughters Cathleen and Kyra. There will be a memorial service on Wednesday, November 1, 2000 at 1:30 PM at Frank E. Campbell, 1076 Madison Ave. at 81 St.</p>
