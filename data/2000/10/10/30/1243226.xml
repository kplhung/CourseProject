        <p>Frustrated and worried that their candidate has failed to capitalize on what they see as his best selling point, prominent Democrats say Vice President Al Gore needs to devote the closing week of the campaign to delivering an urgent pitch about his role in the administration's economic successes.</p>
        <p>Several of these Democrats, including many of Mr. Gore's most enthusiastic supporters, offered a nearly unanimous verdict: the vice president has not benefited politically from the flourishing economy. And the best way for him to overtake Gov. George W. Bush, they said, is to convince voters that he has the record, and the skill, to keep the economy strong.</p>
        <p>''He needs to go back to a message that will do more than electrify the base,'' Senator John B. Breaux, Democrat of Louisiana, said in an interview. ''He needs to go back to a mainstream message.</p>
        <p>''He has to talk about the success of the last eight years,'' Mr. Breaux said, ''and say that Bush has not given the country enough reason for a change. He should have been emphasizing more the economic successes of the administration. That would have not allowed the Bush people to paint him as a big-government candidate.''</p>
        <p>Scoffing at polls showing that the economy ranked below issues like education and health care among many voters, Gov. Gray Davis of California said: ''All the more reason to remind them of their great and relatively recent good fortune. Most voters remember things were not too good when President Bush left office.''</p>
        <p>In a poll released today by ABC News, as well as in other recent surveys, voters said that Mr. Gore was no more likely to protect the economy than Mr. Bush. Mr. Gore has not entirely neglected the administration's success with the economy in his speeches and has talked about it increasingly in recent weeks. But he has not made it the central theme of his campaign.</p>
        <p>As the campaign entered its final week, with most polls showing that Mr. Bush holds a slight lead nationwide, the friendly counsel of these Democrats took on a sense of anxiety. While several Democrats said they were still optimistic that Mr. Gore would prevail, they expressed fear that Mr. Gore, who was moving ahead in the polls only a month ago, had been outsmarted by Mr. Bush and had let his advantage slip away.</p>
        <p>Today, Mr. Gore, who is growing more intense in his oratory, implored congregants at a black church in Detroit to support him on Election Day. ''You have the ability to make the difference,'' Gore said at Hartford Memorial Baptist Church.</p>
        <p>Shedding their usual spin, some of the Democrats interviewed in recent days uttered something that is obvious but that is not often heard from respected party officials: that a Bush victory is possible.</p>
        <p>Even William M. Daley, Mr. Gore's campaign chairman, allowed as much in an interview on Friday. ''Nobody really knows,'' Mr. Daley said of who will be the next president. ''I don't know where it's going to be tomorrow, much less 11 days from tomorrow. Anything's possible. The only definite is it's statistically impossible for Nader to win -- or Buchanan.''</p>
        <p>In some ways, Mr. Gore's failure to capitalize on the economy was the result of his desire to stand on his own and chart a course separate from President Clinton, and the scandals that marred the administration. Many Democrats argued that he had never found a way to embrace the administration's economic legacy without throwing his arms around Mr. Clinton himself.</p>
        <p>Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut, a former Democratic national chairman, said Mr. Gore has been focusing on the economy but that ''it hasn't been resonating effectively.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Dodd explained: ''One of the difficulties is to talk about it and not talk about the president at the same time. It makes it an awkward conversation. Al Gore knows if we're talking about a third Clinton term, that would be a great liability. It makes your discussion about this somewhat stilted.''</p>
        <p>In the interviews, prominent Democrats said Mr. Gore had not sought their advice. But they said they had voiced concerns to his advisers that he had not sufficiently sought credit for the economy.</p>
        <p>Most strikingly, the Democrats were united in offering the same advice: that the administration's successes must be front and center.</p>
        <p>''He has a proud record, which he helped build,'' Governor Davis said. ''In the last few days, he should remind people that it wasn't always this good and when it ain't broke, don't fix it.''</p>
        <p>Gov. James B. Hunt Jr. of North Carolina, a Democrat, said Mr. Gore needed to talk more not only about the economy but also about what Mr. Bush could do to harm it.</p>
        <p>''He's got to be very aggressive in talking about what Americans have at stake and how Bush's tax cut is very risky,'' Mr. Hunt said, adding that the economy needs ''to be the issue that brings the election home for Al Gore and the Democrats.''</p>
        <p>Several Democrats said that after the Democratic convention and into September, they were lulled into a sense of comfort that many voters had finally decided that Mr. Gore was the best candidate and that he had the edge with the president and a booming economy behind him.</p>
        <p>But they said they were now in the unexpected position of fighting to hang on to the White House in light of the vice president's lackluster debate performances and his failure to lay out his achievements, as well as the Bush campaign's attack on his credibility.</p>
        <p>While many Democrats still predicted that Mr. Gore would prevail, as a group the vice president's party seemed more nervous than the Republicans. Leading Republicans were much less likely than Democrats to offer advice for Mr. Bush in the final week. It could be that the Republicans were more self-assured.</p>
        <p>''My gut keeps telling me that at the end of the day there's a Clinton fatigue factor,'' said Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania, a Republican. ''If I'm undecided and the issues haven't driven me to vote for one candidate or another, I think it comes down to credibility and likability.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Dodd said he and several Democratic colleagues met informally late last week and ''everyone made a little wager'' over who would win. ''The overwhelming consensus was Gore's going to win this in a narrow election.'' But he said a couple of senators said that ''they felt in their gut it was too close to call.''</p>
        <p>Mark Fabiani, Mr. Gore's deputy campaign manager, took issue with those who argued that the vice president should dwell more on the past.</p>
        <p>''I can understand the frustration of people,'' Mr. Fabiani said. ''But at the same time, everyone has to understand that Al Gore will be elected based upon his vision of the future. People naturally are going to give him credit for the last eight years. It doesn't help to be standing up and taking credit for yourself.''</p>
        <p>David Worley, chairman of the Georgia Democratic Party, said it was important for Mr. Gore to campaign independently of Mr. Clinton.</p>
        <p>''I for one, am glad he's running his campaign and not relying on President Clinton,'' Mr. Worley said, ''because that's what voters are looking for, independence. He's got to convince independents that he should be president and he's got to do that in his own right.''</p>
        <p>He also argued that Mr. Gore should emphasize the economy and his role in its success. ''He needs to keep focusing on the issues and the economy,'' Mr. Worley said. ''As long as he does that he'll do fine.''</p>
        <p>Some Democrats argued that if Mr. Gore had concentrated more on the economy, the Republicans would have had less success raising questions about his personality and stirring up the controversy over whether he embellishes facts.</p>
        <p>''People are looking for something to finally resolve this personality thing,'' said Senator Russell D. Feingold of Wisconsin, who counsels Mr. Gore to avoid attacking Mr. Bush harshly. ''He should just stay focused on the issues, be presidential in his manner without overdoing it, but definitely point out that he knows how to do the job and that he's results-oriented.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Feingold was not as harsh as other Democrats in saying that the vice president had squandered opportunities. In the wake of the impeachment, he said, he had convinced himself for a year and a half that Mr. Gore could never win because of the Clinton connection.</p>
        <p>''I think Gore has done as well as he could with the cards that were dealt him,'' he said. ''Don't you remember a year ago, a lot of the stories said, 'Gore is sinking like a stone.' They tried to write the guy off.''</p>
        <p>Some Democrats said Mr. Gore's advantage in the polls after the convention evaporated not because he avoided talking about the past but because of other factors.</p>
        <p>Governor Davis said he understood why Mr. Gore did not want to focus on Mr. Clinton or the past.</p>
        <p>''He has a natural tendency,'' Mr. Davis said, ''to want to be his own person and talk about what he'd do as his own person. That's just human nature.''</p>
        <p>But, he added, that it was vital for him to talk about the past ''because past is always prologue. He needs to say, 'Here's what I've done and now here's what I'm going to do.' ''</p>
