        <p>THE SENATE</p>
        <p>LAST-MINUTE DEBATES -- With polls suggesting that the Senate race in Washington State is one of the year's tightest, Slade Gorton, the Republican incumbent, and former Representative Maria Cantwell, his Democratic challenger, have turned to debates in a final effort to get an edge in the contest.</p>
        <p>In their first meeting, last week in Spokane, the exchanges were mostly civil. But there were sharp clashes over Mr. Gorton's plan to privatize some Social Security investments and over campaign finance reform.</p>

        <p>THE SENATE</p>
        <p>LAST-MINUTE DEBATES -- With polls suggesting that the Senate race in Washington State is one of the year's tightest, Slade Gorton, the Republican incumbent, and former Representative Maria Cantwell, his Democratic challenger, have turned to debates in a final effort to get an edge in the contest.</p>
        <p>In their first meeting, last week in Spokane, the exchanges were mostly civil. But there were sharp clashes over Mr. Gorton's plan to privatize some Social Security investments and over campaign finance reform.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gorton said his privatization proposal was ''the difference between trusting individuals to manage a portion of their own lives and trusting the government, which has wasted Social Security money for generations.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Cantwell, an Internet executive who has seen millions of dollars of her fortune evaporate recently as the value of her company's stock has declined, shot back: ''Ask me what's happened to the stock market in the last couple weeks -- I know. There's nothing secure about Social Security when you play around with the stock market.''</p>
        <p>On campaign finance reform, the two clashed over the McCain-Feingold bill, which would ban unlimited soft money donations to political parties. Mr. Gorton called the bill ''a fraud'' while Ms. Cantwell said opposition to it represented ''what America thinks is wrong with the political system.''</p>
        <p>A second debate is scheduled for today in Seattle.</p>

        <p>A WELCOME ENDORSEMENT -- The Senate race in Virginia is now regarded as too close to call. But the incumbent Democrat, Charles S. Robb, got a lift over the weekend when he was endorsed by former Gov. L. Douglas Wilder.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wilder, a Democrat, is the first -- and only -- black ever elected governor in the country, and his endorsement will probably carry considerable weight with Virginia's black voters, about 15 percent of the electorate. Polls show that Mr. Robb is running neck and neck with his Republican challenger, former Gov. George F. Allen.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wilder's endorsement, announced on Saturday, was the second time he had come to Mr. Robb's aid. In 1994, Mr. Wilder ended a feud with the senator and campaigned with him in the 11th hour of the race, helping him beat his challenger, Lt. Col. Oliver L. North.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Mr. Robb made a get-out-the-vote tour of a dozen black churches in the Norfolk area. And President Clinton traveled to Virginia, where he called for Mr. Robb's re-election while addressing several black congregations in Alexandria. He said Mr. Robb was a man of conviction and courage and urged church members to ''think about your responsibility for the future.''</p>

        <p>THE AD CAMPAIGN</p>
        <p>A GENERAL ENLISTS -- In a final-week blitz of television advertising, automated telephone calls and mass mailings, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas has enlisted the help of General Norman H. Schwarzkopf, his father's top field commander in the Persian Gulf war.</p>
        <p>The general, now retired, made some appearances with Governor Bush earlier in the presidential campaign. But now he is on the phone, telling voters in recorded messages to disregard all those disparaging remarks Vice President Al Gore has been making about the governor's plans for Social Security.</p>
        <p>''You trusted me with the lives of your sons and daughters,'' General Schwarzkopf says in the call, ''so trust me on this. I can promise you that George W. Bush will never do anything to hurt seniors or threaten Social Security. Don't be fooled by the scare tactics.''</p>
        <p>Republican officials say the calls, being heard primarily in battleground states, are part of a last-week media campaign that will cost more than $15 million.</p>

        <p>THE TRAVEL LOG</p>
        <p>THE NUMBERS -- On the next-to-the-last Sunday before the election, Gov. George W. Bush spent the day relaxing at his Texas ranch, except for addressing a group of Hispanics in California via satellite, while Vice President Al Gore stayed on the campaign trail, working the Great Lakes region. The numbers:</p>
        <p>Length of official day: Gore, 13 hours; Bush 2 hours</p>
        <p>States visited: Gore, 1; Bush, 0</p>
        <p>Official events: Gore, 6; Bush 1</p>

        <p>Miles traveled: Gore, 172; Bush, 0</p>
        <p>Main message: Gore, environment and prosperity; Bush, getting out the vote</p>
