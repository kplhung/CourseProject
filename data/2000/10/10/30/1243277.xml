        <p>THE HEALTH AND EFFECTIVENESS OF MARCUS CAMBY -- One of the league's best offensive rebounders, Camby can almost single-handedly improve the Knicks in their greatest area of need: offensive rebounding. But only, of course, if he is healthy. Camby, a fifth-year veteran has never played more than 63 games in a season, and it may be wishful thinking to believe he will top that this season, especially because he is already experiencing soreness in his lower back and right knee and will spend most of his time on the court banging against bulkier centers.</p>

        <p>THE HEALTH AND EFFECTIVENESS OF MARCUS CAMBY -- One of the league's best offensive rebounders, Camby can almost single-handedly improve the Knicks in their greatest area of need: offensive rebounding. But only, of course, if he is healthy. Camby, a fifth-year veteran has never played more than 63 games in a season, and it may be wishful thinking to believe he will top that this season, especially because he is already experiencing soreness in his lower back and right knee and will spend most of his time on the court banging against bulkier centers.</p>
        <p>REBOUNDING -- Logic says the Knicks, who have the smallest starting lineup in the league with an average height of 6 feet 6 inches, will struggle in this department. They ranked 24th in the league last season, with Patrick Ewing averaging a team best 9.7 rebounds per game. But with Camby, Larry Johnson and Kurt Thomas showing improvement, the Knicks outrebounded their preseason opponents. They will need to continue that in the regular season to get easy baskets in transition and on the offensive glass.</p>
        <p>ODD LINEUPS -- Glen Rice, with his outstanding range and post-up game, is one of the most dangerous scorers in the league, so he will have to play at least 30 minutes a game. With Latrell Sprewell and Allan Houston ahead of him, the only way to give each of them the playing time they deserve is to play them together for significant stretches, either through the big backcourt or by playing Rice at power forward.</p>
        <p>LARRY JOHNSON'S HEALTH AND PRODUCTIVITY -- Because of his scoring ability and great passing out of double teams, Johnson, 31, is now the Knicks' top low-post threat. He has shown signs in the past and in the preseason that when given that role, he can play near the level he displayed before sacrificing much of his offense upon joining the Knicks. If Johnson is close to the player who averaged 20.5 points and 8.4 rebounds for Charlotte during the 1995-96 season -- he says that he is -- the Knicks will be able to match anyone in the East. If he is not close, either because of his health or his age, there could be trouble.</p>
        <p>CRUNCH TIME -- Though they sometimes viewed Ewing as a burden, the Knicks often looked to him to bail them out in the fourth quarter. Because he could always get off a decent shot and draw a foul, Ewing was the key go-to guy late in many games. Now that burden will fall largely Sprewell and Houston, both of whom had their share of fourth-quarter problems. In each case, the Knicks would be incredibly flawed structurally, and if the lineups are too unproductive to use, chemistry problems over a lack of minutes could result.</p>
