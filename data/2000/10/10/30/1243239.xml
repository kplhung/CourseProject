        <p>NEW YORK</p>
        <p>MANHATTAN: METROCARD MACHINES OUT  All 1,800 of the city's vending machines for MetroCards were mysteriously knocked out of commission at 1:40 a.m. yesterday. ''We really have no idea what happened,'' said Al O'Leary, a spokesman for New York City Transit. He said the machines' manufacturer was investigating a possible telecommunications problem. Another suspect was the switch to standard time from daylight saving, but Mr. O'Leary noted that 250 machines were in use during last year's switch and there was no problem. He said the machines would be in service by this morning.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: FAIRGROUND ART AUCTION  Nearly 700 pieces from carnivals, circuses and amusement parks, including intricately carved carousel animals from the 1900's, were sold at auction over the weekend for about $1 million. The ''fairground art'' auction, held Friday and Saturday by Guernsey's auction house, also featured circus posters, figures from a Vermont wax museum, as well as a carousel horse (above) by Stein &amp; Goldstein of Coney Island.</p>

        <p>BROOKLYN: 7 FIREFIGHTERS HURT  Seven firefighters suffered second-degree burns yesterday when flames burst through the doorway of a burning apartment, said Firefighter Robert Calise, a Fire Department spokesman. The firefighters quickly extinguished the fire, which started at 11:43 a.m. on the top floor of a four-story brick building at 3301 Farragut Road in Flatbush. Six of the firefighters, who suffered cuts and second-degree burns, were treated and released, and Firefighter Mark Merrell was admitted to the burn unit of the New York-Presbyterian Hospital.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: SUSPECT EXTRADITED  A suspected gang leader, accused in the murder of a retired New York City police detective during an attempted robbery in the Bronx, has been extradited to the United States, the police said. The suspect, Frank Nunez, 38, was sent from Bogota, Colombia, to New York on Friday, and faces federal charges of murder, attempted murder, racketeering and armed robbery. Mr. Nunez is accused in the August 1999 slaying of the retired detective, Donald Pagani Sr., 69. Mr. Nunez then fled to Bogota, where he was arrested by Colombian and United States drug enforcement officials.</p>

        <p>BROOKLYN: COUNTERFEIT CLOTHING  New York investigators seized about $1 million worth of unlicensed clothing, including World Series apparel, officials said yesterday. The counterfeiting operation was run out of a one-story factory at Third Avenue and Union Street in Carroll Gardens, the police said. More than 15,000 shirts and sweaters, bearing the logos of the Yankees, the Mets, Calvin Klein and others were seized Friday and three men were charged with several counts of counterfeiting.</p>

        <p>NEW JERSEY</p>
        <p>NEWARK: AID FOR PART-TIME STUDENTS  The state's top two higher education boards have recommended that New Jersey provide about $10 million in tuition grants to part-time college students. The proposal was approved last week during separate meetings of the Commission on Higher Education and the Higher Education Student Assistance Authority. Gov. Christine Todd Whitman and the Legislature must now decide whether to set aside the money in next year's budget. Needy students taking the equivalent of about two classes each semester would be eligible.</p>

        <p>TRENTON: LAWMAKERS RETURN  State lawmakers will return to Trenton today for an unusually long pre-election voting session. Topping the list of bills before the state Assembly are measures that would require sex education classes to stress abstinence and a bill that would force more disclosure from donors to candidates for governor. Problem gamblers would be allowed to bar themselves from casinos, under another bill up for a vote. First on the agenda is a plan to regulate the use of motorized scooters and skateboards.</p>

        <p>TRENTON: 7 BIRD SPECIES HAVE WEST NILE  At least seven species of birds have tested positive for West Nile virus in New Jersey, according to state health department officials. Crows make up the overwhelming majority of birds that have contracted the disease. But birds that have also tested positive include red-tailed hawks, blue jays, a merlin, an American kestrel, a great horned owl and a cockatiel. At least 1,119 birds in 18 counties have contracted West Nile, most likely from infected mosquitoes.</p>
