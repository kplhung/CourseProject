        <p>Asked for his views on the election, Bern Moorehead began with a little background: as a child, he spent a lot of time at a shooting range his mother owned, and he heard a lot of right-wing politics.</p>
        <p>In a few days, he plans to pick up the absentee ballot from the dresser in his freshman dorm room at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill. And he will weigh his long-held belief in a person's right to own a gun against something that has more recently become important to him: a woman's right to choose an abortion. ''I'll sit down for a long time and stare at that ballot,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Joanna Zahren, a freshman from a charismatic Christian family, knows more about presidential politics than ever before, because the newspaper is required reading in her political science class. She will drop off her ballot this weekend on a trip home to the mostly Republican town of Mooresville, N.C. She is leaning toward her family's choice, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, but worries that he is not up to the intellectual demands of the job.</p>
        <p>''I've just been kind of conditioned,'' she said. ''But I came to college, and I want to do my own thing and be my own person.''</p>
        <p>Hasan Allen, 20, who works at Cellular Etc. in the South Square Mall in Durham, had already voted, at a polling place that is part of North Carolina's new ''no excuse'' program, which lets people vote from  Oct. 16 to Nov. 3. He took along a list of endorsements from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. ''I trust them to make the right decision,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In an election year when the most talked-about issues -- Medicare, Social Security, prescription drugs -- can seem abstract to someone under 30, interviews with three dozen students and young adults here found no lack of interest in the presidential race.</p>
        <p>While many of those interviewed confessed to being confused by -- or ignorant of -- various campaign issues, most said they were using a variety of strategies to pick (or at least muddle) their way to a decision. And even among the few who said they would not vote, apathy was not always the reason.</p>
        <p>As a group, young people are often criticized for apathy toward politics, and with reason. In the last two decades, turnout in presidential elections among people 18 to 24 has hovered around 20 percentage points below turnout for all adults. Though there was a sharp rise in youth turnout in 1992, often cited as evidence that young voters respond to attention from candidates like President Clinton, that spike corresponded with a higher-than-normal turnout over all. And according to a recent poll by MTV and the Kaiser Family Foundation, fewer than half of 18-to-24-year-olds say they will definitely vote this year.</p>
        <p>To some who run voter registration drives and encourage young people to vote, Mr. Bush and Vice President Al Gore have not done enough to make the issues relevant. ''There's no recognition of the issues young people care about, in any of these speeches,'' said John Dervin, the spokesman for Youth Vote 2000, a Washington-based coalition of organizations that promotes civic involvement by young people. ''It's almost like we aren't worth that extra couple of sentences. You throw out a $10,000 tax credit without saying, 'to keep you out of debt' or whatever.''</p>
        <p>Both campaigns point to MTV appearances and traditional networks of student support, but spokesmen for both Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore said their candidates did not tailor their messages when speaking on college campuses. ''What we've seen from Governor Bush and the Bush campaign is a strong and consistent message aimed at all Americans,'' said Ray Sullivan, a Bush spokesman.</p>
        <p>Some credit Mr. Gore with making a greater effort. Unlike Mr. Bush, Mr. Gore agreed to participate in a 90-minute question and answer session on MTV. And at a rally in Madison, Wis., last week, he catered to the college town crowd with expressions like ''Hull-oh?''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Gore is competing with Ralph Nader, whose change-the-system message and rock-star-studded rallies are credited with drawing a large youth audience, although some polls show that young people are no more likely to vote for Mr. Nader than are older adults.</p>
        <p>The young voters interviewed here in the triangle formed by Raleigh, Durham and Chapel Hill were not likely to criticize the candidates for not reaching out. Rather, they tended to fault themselves for failing to grasp the issues. At North Carolina State University in Raleigh, Russell Johnson, 20, a business management major, said he did not plan to vote. ''It doesn't relate to me, I guess,'' he said. But when asked what the candidates could have done to spark his interest, he said, ''I just don't think I really take the time to understand it all.''</p>
        <p>People who had not registered to vote sounded embarrassed rather than defiant. But others told a different story about their peers. Malikia Bryant, 22, who graduated last May from North Carolina Central University, a historically black school in Durham, said her sorority had visited five high schools to register seniors. ''We had to, like, bribe them,'' she said from behind the counter at the Marriott hotel, where she works as a receptionist. ''We'll do a small step show if y'all register to vote,'' they told the students. She demonstrated step dancing, stomping and snapping in syncopation.</p>
        <p>''They say, 'Until a black man runs there's no need for me to vote.' That's such a long shot,'' she added.</p>
        <p>Still, at N.C. Central, a number of students said they had already voted in the campus's early polling station, which has had a steady stream of business. Travis Grady, a junior, was one who had cast his ballot for Mr. Gore. ''I don't want anything to change,'' he said. ''Clinton paved the way for us for the past three or four years. And Gore's going to be on the level.''</p>
        <p>Except, perhaps, for a state bond referendum for higher education, there was no single issue driving students to the polls in North Carolina. For many, the decision-making process involved a painful weighing of many issues rather than a sudden epiphany. Most often, those who had settled on Mr. Gore said his intelligence was the reason; those firmly in the Bush camp frequently cited a Republican upbringing.</p>
        <p>Enthusiasm for the candidates as people was virtually nonexistent, with many students poking fun at rhetoric such as Mr. Bush's ''affirmative access'' or Mr. Gore's claim of inventing the Internet. ''I think they're both crackheads,'' said Jenny Jones, 27, referring not to drug addicts but to people who appear less than rational. ''I think they're a joke,'' she said, though she is planning to vote for Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>Carrie Goodman, a University of North Carolina freshman, said: ''You don't know the real person. You know the persona they give the public.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Goodman had just come from volunteering at a shelter for families in trouble, and said her personal experiences had contributed to her concerns about welfare. The crystal chandeliers in the private home for the elderly where she had worked in her home town of Gastonia, N.C., for example, were too great a contrast with the shoddy conditions of the homes she had visited with her mother, a social worker. She said she will vote for Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>Constance Lindsay, curled up in deep communion with a sofa in the student union at Duke University, said studying in Ghana had made her question why certain countries get more aid than others. Although she said she would vote, she was not convinced that the election's outcome would affect her. ''The one thing that did resonate with me is when Gore said he would give people $10,000,'' she said, referring to the candidate's proposal to make some higher education expenses tax-deductible. ''Because I know how expensive it is to be here.''</p>
        <p>Like almost all of those interviewed, Ms. Lindsay said she had not considered voting for Mr. Nader. But she echoed several others in her wish that he had been included in the debates. ''I just feel like we need more opposition for active dialogue,'' she said. ''The infusion of new ideas is important. That's what alienates people.''</p>
        <p>Erica Smiley, 20, would seem to fit the profile of a Nader fan: she is a leader among progressive students at U.N.C., active in the Young Communist League and describes herself as a ''queer woman of color.'' But she has been urging members of the Progressive Student Coalition to vote for Mr. Gore, to prevent a Bush victory.</p>
        <p>''It's good to be theoretical,'' she said from underneath a bulbous knit hat, as an episode of ''The Golden Girls'' played on the TV in her room.  ''There's just a time and a place. There's no way in hell I could go to a small-town, Southern Baptist, working-class family and tell them to vote for Nader because they need to stand up to the system.''</p>
        <p>For the most part, the conversations focused on issues rather than demeanor. Erica Terry, a reporter with Choose or Lose, MTV's running campaign coverage, said that tendency fit with what she had seen as she has crisscrossed the country. ''We're probably better at that than our parents or our grandparents, who seem to really care this year whether or not he's a nice guy,'' she said.</p>
        <p>''I don't mind Gore's personality,'' was how Ashley Steed, a Duke senior who was weighing what she called Mr. Gore's willingness to help people against Mr. Bush's toughness on crime and support of a strong military, put it. ''I think he gets a hard rap. But Bush gets a hard time for the mistakes that he's made. They'll get the power and the respect that they want from the office, not their personalities.''</p>
