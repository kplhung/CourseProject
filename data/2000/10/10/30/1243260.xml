        <p>Nearly every hour of every day at Bronx Preparatory Charter School begins with a recitation of rules.</p>
        <p>Students open identical color-coded binders to the first page, tracing the words with their fingers as classmates read aloud. Raise your hand. Respect each other. Follow directions the first time.</p>
        <p>Before entering any class, the boys and girls line up in the hallway, aligning heads one behind the other. After the bell, they line up again, right foot on the green tape, until a teacher escorts them to the hallway, where they wait, in line, to be admitted to the next classroom, where they open their binders and, following with fingers, recite the rules.</p>
        <p>''Structure creates peace of mind,'' said Marina Bernard Damiba, principal of the school, which educates 100 fifth and sixth graders from poor black and Hispanic families. ''Remember, the kids we're teaching, this may be the only place they get it.''</p>
        <p>As a new charter, creating a school from scratch, Bronx Prep, on Webster Avenue in the Morrisania section, is establishing a demanding disciplinary culture where conduct and character sometimes take precedence over multiplication and spelling.</p>
        <p>Mindful of the chaos that often pervades inner-city schools, administrators made order paramount in the opening weeks, even if it meant sacrificing time with textbooks for hours of drills on hallway etiquette.</p>
        <p>Charter schools, which receive public funds but remain free from most state and district regulations, are widely seen as laboratories for innovation, and now enroll more than 500,000 students in 2,000 schools nationwide. Bronx Prep's experience this fall suggests that such independence means an opportunity to establish rigorous standards, depending in part on the added autonomy of charter schools, whose staffs serve at will  and whose students can be held to  strict behavior contracts.</p>
        <p>The rigid system has its casualties: long before the end of the first marking period, Bronx Prep had ousted its most experienced teacher and its most challenging student -- dismissals that never would have happened in a traditional public school.</p>
        <p>The teacher, at work on her second master's degree, did not last three weeks of constantly reining children into silent lines. The pupil, who eagerly arrived an hour early on Bronx Prep's first day, was gone by October, after near-daily infractions like sucking his fingers and disrupting class culminated in a fistfight at a bus stop.</p>
        <p>''Good schools don't choose not to see,'' said Kristin Kearns Jordan, the school's executive director. ''As soon as you choose not to see, you lose it. You lose the school. You lose the mission. You lose the purpose of what you're doing.''</p>
        <p>Regimentation Amid Chaos</p>
        <p>The regimented atmosphere stands in sharp contrast to the disorderly classrooms that characterize many public schools in similar neighborhoods. It also bears little resemblance to schools -- often in middle-class suburbs -- where freedom and creativity are savored. As educators strive to bring all children to high achievement standards, they are starting to create schools with widely divergent cultures depending in part on demographics.</p>
        <p>Experts in educational psychology say there is a growing consensus that highly structured environments like Bronx Prep's can be effective for learning, particularly for minority children from poor neighborhoods. They cautioned, though, that rules should not exist for their own sake and must be administered fairly; children, they said, should help design the regimen.</p>
        <p>''To the degree that kids are perceived as lovable, healthy youth with potential, those strategies work fine,'' said Howard C. Stevenson, an education professor at the University of Pennsylvania. ''The struggle is when people assume that kids are amoral or potentially aggressive and the structure is about making them human, as if they're inhuman.''</p>
        <p>William Damon, director of the Center on Adolescence at Stanford, said developing social skills can be as crucial as teaching academics.</p>
        <p>''All throughout life, you need civil codes of behavior in order to get along in whatever you do,'' he said. ''You need to be respectful and honest, you need to have integrity and character, whether you end up driving a truck or being a doctor.''</p>
        <p>At Bronx Prep, that idea translates into signs in the bathrooms reminding children to tuck in their shirts, and frequent criticism for being a bad teammate.</p>
        <p>The children -- who are called scholars -- are given counts of 6 or 10 or 20 to file a worksheet or gather backpacks for a march up or down stairs. Plaudits and demerits are tallied weekly in 10 categories as ''scholar dollars'' to be spent at monthly auctions.</p>
        <p>As often as not, a child is banished to an old-fashioned wooden desk in the hallway, or placed at the silent lunch table in the cafeteria. After a lengthy dressing-down, students must enumerate their misdeeds in a written apology.</p>
        <p>''When you don't even know it, I'm going to be watching you,'' Mrs. Damiba, 29, a model of tough love, warned young Madelyne Morales one morning.</p>
        <p>''You said you wanted to change, didn't you?'' she fairly hissed at the girl, their faces inches apart. ''You said you wanted to get rid of the bad habits, didn't you? We're doing this because we care about you. We care about your future.''</p>
        <p>'You Have to Fit the Profile'</p>
        <p>It was two hours before the Bronx Prep orchestra's inaugural concert, one last run-through of ''Graduation (Friends Forever)'' by Vitamin C, when Robert Brunner, a sixth-grade keyboardist, laughed out loud at a drummer's goof.</p>
        <p>''I'm tired of you; I don't have to put up with you,'' Jesus Concepcion, the orchestra director, screamed at Robert in front of half the school. ''I don't need you tonight, sir. You're going to stand and watch your orchestra play.''</p>
        <p>So Robert hovered at the wall, hangdog, while his classmates practiced. Ultimately, Mr. Concepcion relented, but not before scolding Robert again, upstairs in front of the entire orchestra, 58 children who first picked up instruments this summer.</p>
        <p>''Playing the right notes and playing them well is not enough here at Bronx Prep,'' Mr. Concepcion said. ''It's like the real world: you can be replaced. You have to fit the profile, sir. The profile of a musician. A scholar.''</p>
        <p>Da'Shaun Smith is working on it.</p>
        <p>On the first day of school, Da'Shaun, a fifth grader with round wire glasses and a rhinestone stud in his ear, yawned and bawled and begged to go home. His mother threatened to send him to a military academy.</p>
        <p>Da'Shaun's apology letters began to stack up in his file. Mrs. Damiba put him on a daily behavior log, asking every teacher, after every class, to grade him with a smiley face, a neutral one or a frown.</p>
        <p>One September morning, a well-mannered Da'Shaun stood at the board, confidently leading his math class through a word problem. Another day, a teacher called him an angel. Da'Shaun's scholar dollars grew to as high as $49 out of $50 from just $21 the first week of school.</p>
        <p>''This is a whole different scenario,'' Da'Shaun's mother, Janice Smith, told a teacher at the school's open house earlier this month. ''I'm wondering what you did with the child I sent you all. Are you cloning?''</p>
        <p>On Same Page, or Out</p>
        <p>But not everyone survives the harsh disciplinary system.</p>
        <p>The departed teacher -- who, along with Bronx Prep administrators, spoke about the situation on the condition she not be named -- seemed unwilling or unable to adopt the mandated mores. Her classroom was noisier than the rest, her voice softer. Though her lessons on writing memoirs were engaging, her students sometimes failed to stand precisely on the green line when preparing to switch classes.</p>
        <p>''It can get very detailed in regard to how do you pass papers, how do you switch from one activity to another, how do we speak with children,'' Mrs. Damiba said. ''When we talk about Bronx Prep culture, there has to be everyone being on the same page.''</p>
        <p>With seven years of experience teaching high school and training colleagues to teach writing, the teacher, 33, said she had trouble adjusting to the younger pupils, the longer hours -- Bronx Prep runs from 7:55 a.m. to 5 p.m. -- and the rigid structure.</p>
        <p>Because Bronx Prep's teachers have neither a union contract nor tenure, engineering her departure was as simple as letting her know it was not working out. In a traditional public school, officials said, firing a teacher is the rare result of some egregious behavior like hitting a child or showing up for work drunk.</p>
        <p>Rather than try to replace the teacher, Mrs. Damiba decided to adopt the role of player-coach: Laura Barfield, 23, who is teaching for the first time, took over the grammar-writing classes, and Mrs. Damiba stepped into Ms. Barfield's two math sections. The departed teacher's salary went mostly to bring Mr. Concepcion on campus full time. A strict disciplinarian whose commanding presence mirrors Mrs. Damiba's, he now teaches music appreciation courses and remedial reading.</p>
        <p>Wishing for Second Chance</p>
        <p>The student's dismissal was more complicated.</p>
        <p>The family of the child, Farid, 11, spoke on the condition his last name not be used. He was a special case from the start, an obviously bright child brimming with unexplained anger. His was the last sixth-grade name drawn in the lottery to determine admission, prompting Ms. Jordan, the school director, to whoop with delight because the boy, who aspires to be a paleontologist, seemed so hungry for what Bronx Prep had to offer.</p>
        <p>But Farid was in trouble from Day 1. He called a girl fat, told a boy his breath did not smell like roses. He put his hand on a classmate in line, forgot his homework, poked someone.</p>
        <p>''I am sorry for letting you, myself, and my teammates at Bronx Prep down,'' Farid wrote in one of a series of mea culpas, each dutifully signed by his grandmother, who has raised him because, she said, his mother abandoned him.</p>
        <p>''I feel that an apology is not enough to show that I am sorry,'' he wrote. ''Like Bronx Prep says, 'People may doubt what you say, but they'll always believe what you do,' and I have to behave through my words and actions.''</p>
        <p>Instead, Farid wore a ski mask on the bus one morning, scaring some girls. Then one afternoon, he punched and kicked a girl who was teasing him.</p>
        <p>''There's a bright red line, and he stepped over it,'' Ms. Jordan said.</p>
        <p>It's right there in Bronx Prep's charter: assault is an expellable offense -- along with possessing a weapon, selling drugs, or committing a felony. In other New York City public schools, fighting would more likely result in suspension; removal from a school is reserved for cases involving weapons or severely disruptive behavior, such as starting a riot.</p>
        <p>''In the public school system, there's another school that will end up with this youngster, and another principal who will end up with this problem, as opposed to in a charter school, you know this kid ain't coming back,'' said Jill Levy, president of the city's principals' union. ''In a public school, we have a wider responsibility to the wider system.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, Farid is now enrolled at Public School 4 in Crotona Park, his fifth school in seven years.</p>
        <p>Looking over a stack of his Bronx Prep papers -- a check-plus, an A, a 100 -- his grandmother said she was heartsick at the lost opportunity.</p>
        <p>Farid said he wanted to call his old teachers and ask for the homework assignments. For a second chance.</p>
        <p>''I want to be in uniform, go to school and learn,'' he said. ''If I had a time machine -- even though that's not true -- I would go back and change it. I just wish I could get back in the school.''</p>
        <p>Blank Slate</p>
        <p>Charter schools, which receive public funds but are freed from most state and district regulations, are widely seen as laboratories for innovation, potential role models and catalysts for the broader school system. At Bronx Prep, discipline was a primary focus in the opening weeks of its inaugural year.
