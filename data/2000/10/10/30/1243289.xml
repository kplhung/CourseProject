        <p>YANKEES 4, GIANTS 2</p>
        <p>SIGNATURE MOMENT  Home runs by aging Casey Stengel help the Giants win Games 1 and 3, the first Series homers ever hit at Yankee Stadium, where Stengel becomes a Hall of Fame manager 30 years later.  HITTING STAR  Babe Ruth: a double, a triple, 3 homers, 8 walks and 8 r.b.i., while going 7 for 19 (.368).  PITCHING STAR  Herb Pennock: 2-0, with 3.63 e.r.a., plus Game 6 clincher.</p>
        <p>YANKEES 4, PIRATES 0</p>
        <p>SIGNATURE MOMENT  Legend has it that the day before the Series opened in spacious and hitter-unfriendly Forbes Field, the Murderers' Row of Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Tony Lazzeri and Bob Meusel hit so many balls over the walls in batting practice that the Pirates were psyched out.  HITTING STARS  Mark Koenig, 9 for 18 (.500) and Babe Ruth (.400) with 2 homers and 7 R.B.I.  PITCHING STAR  Wilcy Moore saves Game 1, wins Game 4, with 0.84 E.R.A.</p>
        <p>YANKEES 4, CARDINALS 0</p>
        <p>SIGNATURE MOMENT  Ruth belts three homers in 7-3 clincher in St Louis, the second one followed by Gehrig's fourth homer of the Series to help put the Cards away for good.  HITTING STAR  Ruth, 10 for 16 (.625), with 3 HR and 9 runs scored; Gehrig, 6 for 11 (.545), with 4 HR and 9 r.b.i.  PITCHING STAR  Waite Hoyt, 2-0 in 2 starts, with 1.50 e.r.a.</p>
        <p>YANKEES 4, CUBS 0</p>
        <p>SIGNATURE MOMENT  The debate will carry into the next century on whether Babe Ruth pointed to the spot he eventually homered to in Game 3 at Wrigley Field. What's beyond dispute: the homer broke a 4-4 tie and the Cubs' spirit.  HITTING STAR  Lou Gehrig, 9 for 17 (.529), with 8 r.b.i. and 3 HR.  PITCHING STAR  Herb Pennock, who won 5 career Series games as a starter, saves Games 3 and 4 with four total innings of totally superb relief.</p>
        <p>YANKEES 4, GIANTS 2</p>
        <p>SIGNATURE MOMENT  In their first Series without the Babe, the Yankees get contributions from two holdovers, Lou Gehrig and Tony Lazzeri (7 r.b.i. apiece.) Lazzeri's grand slam sparks an 18-4 romp in Game 2 and Gehrig's two-run homer in Game 4 tips the Series.  HITTING STAR  Jake Powell goes 10 for 22 (.455) with 8 runs scored.  PITCHING STAR  In a Series dominated by hitting, Bump Hadley wins Game 3 by 2-1 and Monte Pearson Game 4 by 5-2.</p>
        <p>YANKEES 4, GIANTS 1</p>
        <p>SIGNATURE MOMENT  A seven-run sixth inning in the opener pretty much dooms the Giants in the Series. Two infield errors and two walks to Lefty Gomez, one of baseball's worst hitters, sustain the inning.  HITTING STAR  Tony Lazzeri goes 6 for 15 (.400) and George Selkirk gets 5 hits, scores 5 runs and drives in 6 runs.  PITCHING STAR  Lefty Gomez, 2-0 with a 1.50 e.r.a., plus a single, 2 runs scored and 1 batted in.</p>
        <p>YANKEES 4, CUBS 0</p>
        <p>SIGNATURE MOMENT  Dizzy Dean's last hurrah unfolds as a gritty 3-2 Chicago lead after seven innings of Game 2, then dissolves into a 6-3 Yankee victory when Frank Crosetti and Joe DiMaggio belt two-run homers in the eighth and ninth, respectively.  HITTING STAR  Crosetti and second baseman Joe Gordon each collect a homer and 6 r.b.i.  PITCHING STAR  Red Ruffing, 2-0 with a 1.50 e.r.a., wins the opener and the clincher.</p>
        <p>YANKEES 4, REDS 0</p>
        <p>SIGNATURE MOMENT  The Game 4 victory symbolizes the Cincinnati futility. Joe DiMaggio's single with two on fetches three runs when catcher Ernie Lombardi, dazed by a collision at home with the second runner, allows DiMaggio to circle the bases.  HITTING STAR  Charlie Keller (.438, 3 HR, double, triple, 8 runs, 6 r.b.i.)  PITCHING STAR  Monte Pearson holds the Reds hitless into the eighth of Game 2 before winding up with a two-hit shutout.</p>
        <p>YANKEES 4, DODGERS 1</p>
        <p>SIGNATURE MOMENT  Mickey Owens's passed ball on what would have been a strikeout ending Game 4, with the Dodgers squaring the Series at 2-2, instead allows Tommy Henrich to reach first base. The next five Yankees reach safely in a 4-run rally that yields a 7-4 victory.  HITTING STAR  Joe Gordon and Charlie Keller get 7 hits each.  PITCHING STAR  Marius Russo and Ernie Bonham pitch four-hit victories in Games 3 and 5.</p>
        <p>YANKEES 4, CARDINALS 1</p>
        <p>SIGNATURE MOMENT  Now without Joe DiMaggio, who's in the service, the Yankees still prevail after winning Game 3 by 6-2, with a five-run eighth centered around Billy Johnson's bases-loaded triple.  HITTING STAR  By going 6 for 20, Johnson is the Yankees' only .300 hitter.  PITCHING STAR  Spud Chandler wins the first and last games, allowing only one earned run over 18 innings.</p>
        <p>YANKEES 4, DODGERS 3</p>
        <p>SIGNATURE MOMENT  Cookie Lavagetto's pinch-double in the ninth spoils a no-hit bid by Bill Bevens and wins Game 4 for Brooklyn. Al Gionfriddo's catch deep in Yankee Stadium robs Joe DiMaggio's homer bid and saves Game 6 for Brooklyn. But Joe Page's five innings of one-hit relief in Game 7 closes the book on Brooklyn.  HITTING STAR  Johnny Lindell, a pitcher turned outfielder, goes 9 for 18 with 7 r.b.i.  PITCHING STAR  Spec Shea goes 2-0.</p>
        <p>YANKEES 4, DODGERS 1</p>
        <p>SIGNATURE MOMENT  Tommy Henrich's drive off Don Newcombe in the Yankee ninth wins Game 1 for Allie Reynolds, 1-0. The leadoff homer is the first walkoff homer in Series history.  HITTING STAR  Bobby Brown collects a double, 2 triples and 5 r.b.i. while going 6 for 12.  PITCHING STAR  Reynolds hurls a two-hitter in Game 1 and 313 perfect innings to save Game 4.</p>
        <p>YANKEES 4, PHILLIES 0</p>
        <p>SIGNATURE MOMENT  After 74 relief appearances in the season, Jim Konstanty starts the opener for the Whiz Kids, works eight superb innings, but is outpitched by Vic Raschi, 1-0, and the Yankees hardly look back.  HITTING STAR  Gene Woodling goes 6 for 14 (.429) and Joe DiMaggio 4 for 13 (.308), with a 10th-inning homer to win Game 2.  PITCHING STAR  Allie Reynolds notches a victory, a save and an 0.87 e.r.a.</p>
        <p>YANKEES 4, GIANTS 2</p>
        <p>SIGNATURE MOMENT  With the Series at 2-2, the rookie Gil McDougald hits a grand slam to propel a 13-1 victory and the Miracle Giants never recover.  HITTING STAR  McDougald drives in 7 runs and Phil Rizzuto bats .320 (8 for 25), with 5 runs scored.  PITCHING STAR  Eddie Lopat, a junk-ball left-hander, wins both his starts and is touched for just 2 runs in 18 innings.</p>
        <p>YANKEES 4, DODGERS 3</p>
        <p>SIGNATURE MOMENT  With one swift swipe, the darting second baseman Billy Martin snares Jackie Robinson's infield pop with the bases loaded and two out to preserve a 4-2 Yankee lead in the seventh inning of Game 7.  HITTING STARS  Johnny Mize, 39, goes 6 for 15 with 3 homers; Mickey Mantle, 20, gets 10 hits and 2 homers.  PITCHING STAR  After Allie Reynolds pitches a shutout in Game 4, he earns a save in Game 6 and the victory in Game 7.</p>
        <p>YANKEES 4, DODGERS 2</p>
        <p>SIGNATURE MOMENT  When Carl Erskine strikes out 14 Yankees in Game 3, Mickey Mantle goes down four times. Two games later, Mantle goes downtown for four runs, his grand slam pacing an 11-7 victory that breaks a 2-2 Series tie.  HITTING STARS  Billy Martin's tiebreaking single in the ninth ends Game 6 and the Series. It is his 12th hit.  PITCHING STAR  In a hitter's series, Eddie Lopat's complete game 4-2 effort in Game 2 stands out.</p>
        <p>YANKEES 4, DODGERS 3</p>
        <p>SIGNATURE MOMENT  Don Larsen's perfect game provides the perfect showcase for the 13th Subway Series. It also puts the Yankees up by 3-2 and apparently numbs the Dodgers so thoroughly that they manage just one run in their next 19 times at bat.  HITTING STARS  Yogi Berra drives in 10 and hits 3 homers, two in Game 7 to assure that it's over.  PITCHING STAR  Larsen's gem can't be topped. But Johnny Kucks tosses a three-hit shutout in Game 7.</p>
        <p>YANKEES 4, BRAVES 3</p>
        <p>SIGNATURE MOMENT  Down by 3-1 in games to a Milwaukee team that beat them the year before, the Yankees turn to Bob Turley, who didn't last an inning in losing Game 2. Turley's 5-0 victory touches off a Yankee comeback.  HITTING STARS  Hank Bauer hit .323, had 10 hits, 4 homers and 8 r.b.i.  PITCHING STAR  Turley's victory in Game 4 is matched by a victory in relief in Game 7.</p>
        <p>YANKEES 4, REDS 1</p>
        <p>SIGNATURE MOMENT  Who else but Roger Maris would awaken echoes of Babe Ruth with a key Series homer? This one, in the ninth of Game 3, supplied the margin in a 3-2 victory that kept Cincinnati at bay.  HITTING STAR  Johnny Blanchard, a backup catcher, bats .400 with a pair of homers and Bobby Richardson bats .391 with 9 hits.  PITCHING STAR  Whitey Ford wins two starts and is not scored on in 14 innings. Shades of Ruth.</p>
        <p>YANKEES 4, GIANTS 3</p>
        <p>SIGNATURE MOMENT  Until it nestled into the glove of second baseman Bobby Richardson, the ball that Willie McCovey rocketed with two out and two on in the ninth inning of Game 7 seemed destined to give San Francisco its first title.  HITTING STAR  Rookie-of-the-year Tom Tresh had 9 hits and former rookie-of-the-year Tony Kubek has 8.  PITCHING STAR  Ralph Terry, goat of the 1960 Series, wins twice, earning a shutout in the clincher.</p>
        <p>YANKEES 4, DODGERS 2</p>
        <p>SIGNATURE MOMENT  It had been 15 years between Yankee titles. It took just three pitches in three Reggie Jackson at-bats to reclaim one. Jackson homered on each one to bury Los Angeles in Game 6.  HITTING STAR  Jackson batted .450 with 10 hits, half of them for home runs, a Series record.  PITCHING STAR  Mike Torrez is the workhorse with two complete-game victories and a 2.50 e.r.a.</p>
        <p>YANKEES 4, DODGERS 2</p>
        <p>SIGNATURE MOMENT  Defense, not power, is the difference as third baseman Graig Nettles thwarts the Dodgers in Game 3. He makes four outstanding plays to back a shaky Ron Guidry.  HITTING STAR  Light-hitting Bucky Dent bats .417 and lighter-hitting Brian Doyle bats .438, with 7 hits (3 fewer than his season total).  PITCHING STAR  Rich Gossage wins one game in relief, finishes the clincher for Catfish Hunter and is never scored on in three Series appearances.</p>
        <p>YANKEES 4, PADRES 0</p>
        <p>SIGNATURE MOMENT  Jim Leyritz belts a 3-run homer late in Game 4 and the Yankees, once down by 6-0, get even at 6-6, then win in extra innings to prevent Atlanta from going up by 3-1. The next night Paul O'Neill saves a 1-0 victory with a game-ending over-the-shoulder catch in right field  HITTING STAR  Cecil Fielder bats .391 and his 9 hits are 4 more than any other Yankee  PITCHING STAR  John Wetteland (2.08 E.R.A.) gets a save in each victory.</p>
        <p>YANKEES 4, PADRES 0</p>
        <p>SIGNATURE MOMENT  After falling behind Kevin Brown by 5-2 in the opener, the Yankees break out for seven runs in the seventh inning, with a grand slam by Tino Martinez.  HITTING STAR  Scott Brosius bats .471, with two homers, both in Game 3. The second one is a three-run blow that turns out to be the game-winner.  PITCHING STAR  Mariano Rivera saves three victories. Andy Pettitte and Orlando Hernandez win with solid seven-inning efforts.</p>
        <p>YANKEES 4, BRAVES 0</p>
        <p>SIGNATURE MOMENT  Paul O'Neill singles home the deciding runs of the opener in Atlanta in the eighth inning, then singles home the first run of Game 2 in the first inning.  HITTING STAR  Chad Curtis, making his first World Series start, homers twice, the second one winning Game 3 in the 10th.  PITCHING STAR  Mariano Rivera is of another century in relief, winning one game, saving two others and assuring the Yankees a 25th World Series title in 76 years.</p>
        <p>YANKEES 4, METS 1</p>
        <p>SIGNATURE MOMENT  Jose Vizcaino's 12th-inning single on the last pitch of Game 1 and Derek Jeter's home run on the first pitch of Game 4. Each put the Yankees ahead for good.  HITTING STAR  Paul O'Neill (.474), Tino Martinez (.364) and Jeter (.409, 2 homers).  PITCHING STAR  The Yankee relievers, especially Mike Stanton with two victories and no runners allowed. The Mets' Al Leiter, with no victories, but 16 strikeouts and lots of respect.</p>
        <p>BASEBALL  Correction:  October 31, 2000, Tuesday  A chart yesterday listing the Yankees' 26 World Series championships misidentified the National League team that lost to them in 1996. It was the Atlanta Braves, not the San Diego Padres.</p>
