        <p>The Lakers of Shaq and Kobe, the Trail Blazers of Rasheed and Smitty, the Spurs of Duncan and Robinson. And now, the Seattle SuperSonics and the Utah Jazz, too.

That leaves the Eastern Conference essentially wide open as the National Basketball Association season begins tomorrow night. The West is, indeed, best.

        <p>The Lakers of Shaq and Kobe, the Trail Blazers of Rasheed and Smitty, the Spurs of Duncan and Robinson. And now, the Seattle SuperSonics and the Utah Jazz, too. Never in the modern pro game has one side of the Continental Divide had so many dominant teams as the Western Conference. That leaves the Eastern Conference essentially wide open as the National Basketball Association season begins tomorrow night. The West is, indeed, best. Portland has retooled to compete with the Lakers, and Tim Duncan is healthy enough to help David Robinson. In the end, the Lakers still have too much heat. The 29 teams in predicted order of finish.</p>
        <p>MIKE WISE</p>
        <p>Eastern Conference</p>
        <p>ATLANTIC DIVISION</p>
        <p>MIAMI HEAT  Last season -- 52-30. Knocked out by the Knicks in the playoffs three straight years.  Additions  G Eddie Jones,  F Anthony Mason, G Ricky Davis,  F Dale Ellis, F Brian Grant,  G Rick Brunson, F Todd Fuller,  F Don MacLean, G Eddie House.  Key losses  C Alonzo Mourning, F P.J. Brown,  F Jamal Mashburn, F Otis Thorpe,  F Clarence Weatherspoon.  Outlook -- Losing Mourning for the season to a kidney disorder may be one of the cruelest blows in Pat Riley's career. His first victory will be the 1,000th of his coaching career, and he has much to be optimistic about after remaking the Heat. Questions remain: Can Grant play center in a not-so-rugged East and can Tim Hardaway's aching knees last beyond an 82-game grind? Somehow, some way, Riley will get them to the finals.</p>
        <p>PHILADELPHIA 76ERS  Last season -- 49-33. Slipped to Pacers in the second round the past two years.  Key losses  G Kevin Ollie, G Speedy Claxton.  Outlook -- Beyond all the combustible possibilities between the rap artist/point guard Allen Iverson and the old-school coach/new-school baby sitter Larry Brown, the 76ers have one of the league's more experienced, stable teams. But Claxton, the rookie point guard from Hofstra, is gone with a season-ending knee injury. Still, Toni Kukoc is only going to get more comfortable with his teammates, and a front line featuring Theo Ratliff and Matt Geiger qualifies as loaded in the East. Iverson's crossover is still the most deadly weapon in the conference, lethal enough to combat his off-court distractions. He could lead the 76ers to the finals. Of course, he could also be traded before the season opener.</p>
        <p>NEW YORK KNICKS  Last season -- 50-32. Two straight conference finals appearances.  Additions  F Glen Rice, C Travis Knight,  C Luc Longley, G Erick Strickland, C Felton Spencer, F Lavor Postell, F Pete Mickeal.  Key losses  C Patrick Ewing, C Chris Dudley, F John Wallace.  Outlook -- After Jerry Sloan, Rudy Tomjanovich and Pat Riley, what coach has the most longevity with one team? Jeff Van Gundy, the original survivor. Now, he has to get Rice to play the good soldier as sixth man, make his big men bring the ball upcourt occasionally and deliver another dramatic playoff run in the post-Patrick era. Rice and Allan Houston are two of the best shooters in the league. Longley is not Ewing, but once he is healthy, New Yorkers will discover passing skills they never knew he had. Marcus Camby has made it clear he is not a center. The bigger issue is, can he be a healthy forward?</p>
        <p>ORLANDO MAGIC  Last season -- 41-41. Hasn't made it to the second round since Shaq left.  Additions  F Grant Hill, G Tracy McGrady,  F Andrew DeClercq, F Mike Miller, G Dee Brown,  G Troy Hudson, C Don Reid.  Key losses  F Ben Wallace, G Chucky Atkins,  G Corey Maggette, F Derek Strong, G Ron Mercer,  G Matt Harpring, G Chauncey Billups.  Outlook -- Landing Hill and McGrady is a nice catch, but the big fish stayed in San Antonio. Without Tim Duncan, the Magic is another high-octane East team and little else. Neither Hill nor McGrady has the personality to implode, so chemistry between the two stars shouldn't be a problem. But of all Orlando's key losses, Atkins may hurt the most. When Darrell Armstrong was out, Atkins made that team go.</p>
        <p>NEW JERSEY NETS  Last season -- 31-51. Nets are on their fourth coach in four years.  Additions  F Kenyon Martin, F Soumaila Samake,  F Aaron Williams.  Key losses  G Kerry Kittles, F Jayson Williams,  F Scott Burrell.  Outlook -- Offering Kendall Gill enough money to spurn an offer from the Lakers may have been one of their best off-season moves. With Kittles's health a major concern and Keith Van Horn missing perhaps the first six weeks with a broken leg, Gill emerges as one of the few players who can keep the ship afloat before January. Stephon Marbury should finally have an All-Star moment. If Byron Scott is patient, the Nets could return to the postseason for the first time since 1997.</p>
        <p>BOSTON CELTICS  Last season -- 35-47. It's Year 4 of Rick Pitino's refurbishing plan.  Additions  F Jerome Moiso, G Bryant Stith,  G Randy Brown, G Chris Carr.  Key losses  F Danny Fortson, G Dana Barros,  G Robert Pack.  Outlook -- Antoine Walker, Paul Pierce and Kenny Anderson qualify as a solid nucleus, but Pitino has yet to find a cast of role players to push the Celtics into the playoffs. One brutal statistic emerges: he is 180-198 as an N.B.A. coach, and if the winning percentage doesn't rise soon, Pitino has said he will not coach the Celtics beyond this season. Pierce, still recovering from a nightclub stabbing over the summer, has All-Star potential.</p>
        <p>WASHINGTON WIZARDS  Last season -- 29-53. Franchise has not won a playoff game in 12 years.  Additions  G Felipe Lopez, F Cherokee Parks,  F Obinna Ekeze, F Popeye Jones, F Mike Smith.  Key losses  G Tracy Murray, C Ike Austin,  F Aaron Williams, C Don Reid.  Outlook -- Juwan Howard, Mitch Richmond and Rod Strickland have a huge burden. Because of their salaries, the Wizards are almost unable to trade them or put a nice assortment of players around them. The reality is, Howard has played three playoff games since signing a $105 million contract in 1996; it doesn't appear he will play another in Washington anytime soon.</p>
        <p>CENTRAL DIVISION</p>
        <p>TORONTO RAPTORS  Last season -- 45-37. Since Charles Oakley has been there, they've won.  Additions  G Mark Jackson, F Corliss Williamson,  G Morris Peterson.  Key losses  G Tracy McGrady, G Dee Brown,  G Doug Christie.  Outlook -- With Mark Jackson now at the point setting up the breathtaking Vince Carter and Lenny Wilkens, the game's winningest coach, on the sideline, Toronto looks strong. Throw in a big-man stable of Antonio Davis, Williamson, Charles Oakley and Kevin Willis, and this is a team capable of advancing to the finals. Losing McGrady to Orlando hurt, but not enough to prevent the Raptors from at least getting out of the first round.</p>
        <p>MILWAUKEE BUCKS  Last season -- 42-40. Came within a defensive rebound of upsetting Pacers in first round.  Additions  F Jason Caffey, C Joel Przybilla,  G Lindsey Hunter.  Key losses  F Billy Owens, F Danny Manning,  G Vinny Del Negro, F Robert Traylor.  Outlook -- Ray Allen is on the cusp of becoming one of the game's top five players. Glenn Robinson still has trouble guarding anyone and Sam Cassell's herky-jerky game has been constrained by minor injuries the past two years. But Caffey was a nice pickup, along with the rookie Przybilla. The Bucks play defense almost as hard as New York. If they don't tune George Karl out, they could win the conference.</p>
        <p>CHARLOTTE HORNETS  Last season -- 49-33. Charlotte has gone 71-46 with Paul Silas in charge.  Additions  F P.J. Brown, F Jamal Mashburn,  F Tim James, F Otis Thorpe, G Hersey Hawkins,  F Jamaal Magloire, F Lee Nailon.  Key losses  G Eddie Jones, F Anthony Mason,  F Dale Ellis, G Ricky Davis.  Outlook -- Brown and Derrick Coleman will reprise a front line from their Nets days, and Mashburn may play more shooting guard than small forward. If Hawkins has enough left in his jumper and Eddie Robinson and Baron Davis keep maturing, Charlotte will make it out of the first round.</p>
        <p>INDIANA PACERS  Last season -- 56-26. Three straight conference finals appearances.  Additions  C Jermaine O'Neal, C Terry Mills.  Key losses  C Rik Smits,  F Dale Davis,  G Mark Jackson,  F Chris Mullin.  Outlook -- Don't discount the drive and passion of Reggie Miller, who at 35 still wants the ball with the season in the balance. Whether someone can deliver it to him as timely as did Jackson is another story. Miller, Jalen Rose and Austin Croshere are solid veterans, but after that Indiana pins its hopes on a kiddie corps: O'Neal, Jonathan Bender and Al Harrington. Smits is retired and Dale Davis is in Portland. Luckily, for Coach Isiah Thomas who takes over for Larry Bird, Conseco Fieldhouse is already sold out for the season.</p>
        <p>DETROIT PISTONS  Last season -- 42-40. Swept in the first round by Miami.  Additions  F Ben Wallace, G Chucky Atkins,  F Cedric Ceballos, F John Wallace, F Billy Owens,  G Mateen Cleaves.  Key losses  F Grant Hill, F Christian Laettner, C Terry Mills, G Lindsey Hunter, G John Crotty.  Outlook -- Jerry Stackhouse is now a permanent go-to guy. Although Hill went to Orlando and Laettner moved to Dallas, Atkins, Ceballos and Wallace give Detroit a more up-tempo, seat-of-the-pants look. Like most teams in the East, the Pistons don't need a bona fide All-Star center to win. If they only played defense, they could make a playoff push.</p>
        <p>ATLANTA HAWKS  Last season -- 28-54. Looking back, getting rid of Steve Smith made no sense.  Additions  G DerMarr Johnson, G Anthony Johnson,  F Hanno Mottola.  Key losses  F LaPhonso Ellis, G Bimbo Coles.  Outlook -- Most coaches didn't want this job. Lon Kruger takes over a tough situation. Unless the Hawks surprise early, Dikembe Mutombo is essentially trade bait, the missing link for a playoff team. Atlanta is not reloading; it is clearly reconstructing.</p>
        <p>CHICAGO BULLS  Last season -- 17-65. Since Michael Jordan hit his shot in Utah, the Bulls are 30-102.  Additions  G Ron Mercer, C Brad Miller, G Bryce Drew, F Marcus Fizer, G Jamal Crawford, F Dragan Tarlac,  G A.J. Guyton, C Jake Voskuhl.  Key losses  C Chris Anstey, G Hersey Hawkins,  G Matt Maloney, G Randy Brown, C Will Perdue.  Outlook -- Elton Brand has help. Mercer, a late free-agent acquisition after every big-name player told Jerry Krause no, should blossom. The rookies Fizer and Crawford can play. The Bulls have salary-cap money for next summer. The bad news? This is the year the heretofore patient fans revolt, and the United Center becomes vacant.</p>
        <p>CLEVELAND CAVALIERS  Last season -- 32-50. Zydrunas Ilgauskas has played only five games in two years.  Additions  F Clarence Weatherspoon, F Chris Gatling,  F J.R. Reid, F Robert Traylor, C Chris Mihm,  G Bimbo Coles, F Matt Harpring.  Key losses  F Shawn Kemp, C Andrew DeClercq,  G Bob Sura, F Danny Ferry.  Outlook -- They finally got rid of Kemp and his inflated contract, but they hardly got equal value. Randy Wittman has another tough assignment. If Ilgauskas, the 7-foot-3-inch Lithuanian center, can have an injury-free year, Cleveland could be in decent shape. But the Cavaliers are not good enough to escape the lottery.</p>
        <p>Western Conference</p>
        <p>MIDWEST DIVISION</p>
        <p>SAN ANTONIO SPURS  Last season -- 53-29. The first defending champion to be knocked out in the first round since the 1984 76ers.  Additions  G Derek Anderson, F Danny Ferry.  Key losses  G Mario Elie, C Felton Spencer,  F Jerome Kersey.  Outlook -- Tim Duncan is slowly returning to full strength after knee surgery. David Robinson has at least two good years left. Coaxing Anderson to play for a pittance was a coup. But who knows how well Sean Elliott will hold up over 82 games? The Spurs have the depth to get back to the conference finals, but don't have the backcourt to overcome the Lakers.</p>
        <p>UTAH JAZZ  Last season -- 55-27. The Jazz is 637-296 in 13 years under Jerry Sloan.  Additions  F Donyell Marshall, G John Starks, F Danny Manning, G DeShawn Stevenson, G John Crotty.  Key losses  G Jeff Hornacek, G Howard Eisley, F Adam Keefe, F Armen Gilliam.  Outlook -- Starks and Sloan are both capable of detonating at any time. But from the occasional explosion should emerge a veteran team with genuine desire left. Karl Malone and John Stockton are a young 37 and 38, respectively, poised to make one last run. Bryon Russell will have to shoulder more of the scoring, with Eisley in Dallas and Hornacek retired. Utah can find a way into the conference finals after a two-year hiatus. Can it win the West? No.</p>
        <p>MINNESOTA TIMBERWOLVES  Last season -- 50-32. Will the Joe Smith contract debacle kill their playoff hopes?  Additions  G Chauncey Billups.  Key losses  G Malik Sealy, G Bobby Jackson.  Outlook -- After Commissioner David Stern last week took away draft picks, levied fines and voided the secret deal between Smith and the team, the Timberwolves' future looks bleak. What's more, one of their best role players, Sealy, was killed in a car accident. Somehow, Kevin Garnett wills them into the playoffs.</p>
        <p>DALLAS MAVERICKS  Last season -- 40-42. In his fourth season with Mavericks, Don Nelson is 75-123.  Additions  F Christian Laettner, F Loy Vaught,  G Howard Eisley, G Courtney Alexander,  F Etan Thomas, F Donnell Harvey, F Eduardo Najera.  Key losses  G Robert Pack, F Cedric Ceballos,  G Erick Stickland.  Outlook -- The Mavericks made a nice run at the end of last season and should be improved with Laettner in the frontcourt and Eisley at the point. Enthusiasm abounds for a once-moribund franchise. But they don't have enough All-Stars to make the playoffs.</p>
        <p>HOUSTON ROCKETS  Last season -- 34-48. Hakeem Olajuwon will be 38 in January.  Additions  F Maurice Taylor, C Jason Collier.  Key losses  F Charles Barkley, F Tony Massenburg,  G Bryce Drew.  Outlook -- In his second year, Steve Francis will remind a lot of people of Allen Iverson: unreal moves, boundless energy, a 6-foot player carrying a team almost by himself. Cuttino Mobley and Shandon Anderson are nice complementary players, but Olajuwon's last season does not appear to be headed beyond 82 games.</p>
        <p>DENVER NUGGETS  Last season -- 35-47. Haven't been to the playoffs since Dikembe Mutombo left.  Additions  G Robert Pack, G Calbert Cheaney,  F Mark Strickland, G Voshon Lenard, G Tracy Murray,  C Mamadou N'Diaye.  Key losses  G Bryant Stith, G Chris Herren,  F Popeye Jones, F Chris Gatling.  Outlook -- Antonio McDyess has All-Star potential. Raef LaFrentz and Nick Van Exel give Denver two proven scorers, but Coach Dan Issel has too many question marks on the bench for the Nuggets to make a genuine run. Denver could sneak into the playoffs.</p>
        <p>VANCOUVER GRIZZLIES  Last season -- 22-60. New owner, new management, same results.  Additions  F Stromile Swift, F Tony Massenburg,  C Ike Austin, G Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf, G Damon Jones.  Key losses  G Felipe Lopez, G Dennis Scott,  F Obinna Ekezie, F Cherokee Parks, F Antoine Carr.  Outlook -- Michael Dickerson and Othella Harrington give Shareef Abdur-Rahim help. And Abdul-Rauf's return to the N.B.A. should be good theater. But Coach Sidney Lowe would need an N.C. State-type miracle to pull the Grizzlies from the cellar.</p>
        <p>PACIFIC DIVISION</p>
        <p>LOS ANGELES LAKERS  Last season -- 67-15. Shaq and Kobe's combined average: 51.9 points a game.  Additions  F Horace Grant, C Greg Foster,  G Emanuel Davis, G Isaiah Rider, F Mark Madsen.  Key losses  F Glen Rice, F A.C. Green.  Outlook -- Shaquille O'Neal lobbied long and hard to land a power forward to help him defend the redwoods in Portland and San Antonio's twin towers. Now he's reunited with Grant, and the Lakers look as strong as ever. Kobe Bryant and Rider will have some issues to work out on the perimeter. But chemistry should not be a problem, especially after Coach Phil Jackson dumped his biggest problem (Rice) in Jeff Van Gundy's lap. L.A. seems poised to repeat.</p>
        <p>PORTLAND TRAIL BLAZERS  Last Season -- 59-23. Two straight conference finals appearances.  Additions  F Shawn Kemp, F Dale Davis, C Will Perdue,  G Erick Barkley.  Key losses  F Detlef Schrempf,  F Brian Grant,  C Jermaine O'Neal.  Outlook -- In Kemp, Davis and Perdue they have three big bodies to try and push Shaq off the blocks and more depth than any roster. But for all their talent and experience, they still have major questions. Can Arvydas Sabonis hold up? Will Rasheed Wallace blow a fuse? Can Damon Stoudamire and Greg Anthony direct the Blazers to a title? The parts still don't fit perfectly.</p>
        <p>SEATTLE SUPERSONICS  Last season -- 45-37. Sonics have two No. 1 draft picks on the roster (Patrick Ewing, 1985, and Pervis Ellison, 1989).  Additions  C Patrick Ewing, F Desmond Mason, C Pervis Ellison, G Randy Livingston, F Dickey Simpkins.  Key losses  F Horace Grant, F Chuck Person,  G Emanuel Davis, C Greg Foster.  Outlook -- Gary Payton and Vin Baker knew they needed a presence in the middle to contend. Whether rickety, 38-year-old Ewing was what they had in mind remains to be seen. But the Sonics have two young backcourt players, Rashard Lewis and Shammond Williams, who can blow by anyone.</p>
        <p>PHOENIX SUNS  Last season -- 53-29. Penny Hardaway hasn't been to the second round since 1995.  Additions  C Iakovos Tsakalidis, C Chris Dudley,  G Tony Delk, G Mario Elie, G Paul McPherson.  Key losses  C Luc Longley, G Kevin Johnson, G Toby Bailey, F Don MacLean, G Todd Day, C Oliver Miller.  Outlook -- Jason Kidd and Hardaway are one of the best 1-2 combinations in the league. With Tom Gugliotta due back in December and players like Shawn Marion and Mario Elie providing intangibles, the Suns will run, gun and have fun. But without a bona fide center, they won't go beyond the first round.</p>
        <p>SACRAMENTO KINGS  Last season -- 44-38. Will Chris Webber's free-agent status cause a distraction?  Additions  G Doug Christie, G Bobby Jackson.  Key losses  F Corliss Williamson, G Tony Delk,  F Tyrone Corbin.  Outlook -- No one will make the all-defensive team, but Webber, Jason Williams, Vlade Divac and crew will again be one of the league's top draws. Throwing an acrobatic Christie into the mix should make for even better highlight material. But losing the steady role players Williamson and Delk hurt. With Williams missing the first five games because he didn't show up for his offseason counseling sessions after testing positive for marijuana, you wonder about the Kings.</p>
        <p>GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS  Last season -- 19-63. The Warriors last appeared in the playoffs in 1994.  Additions  F Danny Fortson, F Adam Keefe, G Bob Sura, G Vinny Del Negro, F Chris Porter, F Chris Mullin.  Key losses  F Jason Caffey, F Donyell Marshall,  F Bill Curley.  Outlook -- Larry Hughes and a healthy Antwan Jamison should at least hold the Bay Area's interest until January. The truth: Coach Dave Cowens has a rough season ahead.</p>
        <p>LOS ANGELES CLIPPERS  Last season -- 15-67. The Clippers have a national TV appearance on Dec. 20.  Additions  F Darius Miles, G Keyon Dooling,  G Quentin Richardson, F Derek Strong,  G Corey Maggette, C Sean Rooks, G Earl Boykins,  C Zendon Hamilton.  Key losses  G Derek Anderson, F Maurice Taylor,  F Pete Chilcutt.  Outlook -- If Alvin Gentry's patience was tested in Detroit, you wonder how much it will be tested with this franchise. Half the roster is under 22. Led by the 19-year-old Miles, the Clippers could be one of two things: one of the league's most exciting young teams or a maddening bunch of knuckleheads still trying to learn the game.</p>
