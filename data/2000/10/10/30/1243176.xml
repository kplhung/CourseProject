        <p>Unlike most retailers, the Kohl's Corporation, the fast-growing department store chain, is not yet selling anything on the Web, though it intends to. The bottleneck is not in bandwidth or server capacity -- the warehouse simply isn't ready yet.</p>
        <p>Kohl's is building a distribution center in Monroe, Ohio. It will be 525,000 square feet -- nearly 12 acres, or almost as big as nine football fields -- and expandable to twice that size. And it will have fancy equipment that can find, pack and ship an item within hours after an order comes in.</p>
        <p>Only after that warehouse is running, probably early next year, will Kohl's plunge into the waters of Web retailing. Kohl's will not start any Web initiative until it has all but eliminated the risk of fulfillment problems, said Susan Henderson, a Kohl's spokeswoman.</p>
        <p>A paradox is emerging in the retail world. As the bricks-and-mortar retailers continue their inexorable march toward the virtual store, they are discovering that selling on the Web requires a lot more bricks and mortar.</p>
        <p>They learned the lessons of last year, when many retailers were so overwhelmed with holiday orders that they ran out of stock. Now they are scurrying to put their operations in synchronization with their Web sales to try to make sure such shortfalls never happen again.</p>
        <p>''Retailers who dealt with Web sales on a strategic level are finally paying attention to tactics,'' said Mark Borsuk, a retail real estate consultant in San Francisco.</p>
        <p>Some, like Gap, Nordstrom and Kohl's, are putting up new buildings to meet delivery needs. Others, like Home Depot, are making their stores do double duty as warehouses and distribution hubs. And many, including Kmart and Wal-Mart, have farmed out the whole process -- at least temporarily -- to so-called fulfillment houses like Fingerhut, Exel and Submitorder.com, which store and deliver merchandise for retailers.</p>
        <p>In their own ways, the retailers are all tackling common problems. Old distribution centers, built to ship pallets loaded with the same items to a finite number of stores, are ill-equipped to send small assortments of items to an infinite number of dispersed customers. In many cases, the people on the phones at their customer call centers are not trained to communicate by e-mail or instant messaging.</p>
        <p>Even warehouses geared to filling catalog orders are often too small or too reliant on antiquated order-handling methods to process orders in the nanoseconds of Internet time.</p>
        <p>''Internet customers place an order, then run to the door to see if the U.P.S. truck is there yet,'' said Elaine Rubin, the chairwoman of Shop.org, a trade association for retailers selling on-line.</p>
        <p>In one sense, the retailers are shooting in the dark. Web selling is still too new for them to accurately gauge what items will be in demand, and from where. Research shows that, for now, shoppers most often use retail Web sites to research products, but then take their shopping lists to the store.</p>
        <p>Still, those habits could change, as consumers grow more comfortable with the Web, and as issues of security and delivery are ironed out. Jupiter Research predicts that e-tail sales will reach $9 billion for November and December alone.</p>
        <p>Uncertain how much warehouse space they may need in coming months, many retailers are erring on the generous side. The result has been a boom in industrial real estate.</p>
        <p>''In centrally located areas, the demand for industrial space far exceeds supply,'' said Jack Fraker, an executive director of Cushman &amp; Wakefield.</p>
        <p>Indeed, brokers who find tenants for distribution centers, particularly places like Memphis, where Federal Express maintains a hub, and Columbus, Ohio, which is less than a day's truck ride from many other urban areas, say they are getting top dollar for their properties.</p>
        <p>James L. Dieter, director of Insignia's United States industrial group, is currently marketing a fairly new 750,000-square-foot, fully automated distribution center near the Baltimore airport. Judging by the calls he is getting from retailers, he predicts the facility will rent out in less than six months, at $17 a square foot.</p>
        <p>''Without the press of e-tailing, it would probably take a year to find a tenant, and I'd probably get 25 percent less in rent,'' Mr. Dieter said.</p>
        <p>Investors, too, are noticing industrial property's new popularity. The AMB Property Corporation, a real estate investment trust, once had $1 billion invested in shopping malls. But it now believes that Web sales will grow faster than store sales. It took most of that money out of malls this year and has invested twice that amount in warehouses -- existing and under construction -- near Los Angeles, New York and other densely populated areas.</p>
        <p>''We've bet close to $2 billion that retailers will want warehouses near their customers,'' said Hamid R. Moghadam, AMB's chairman.</p>
        <p>Actually, many of the companies snapping up warehouses are not retailers at all, but companies set up to serve them.</p>
        <p>''It doesn't make sense for retailers to commit their own capital until they are sure that Web sales work for them,'' said Bruce Edwards, who runs American retail operations for Exel. The company, based in London, has long used its 37 million square feet of warehouse space in the United States to house and distribute large items for retailers and is now chasing the Web fulfillment business.</p>
        <p>New fulfillment companies crop up each day. Submitorder.com, for example, started  last year purely to provide facilities for e-commerce. It runs a 700,000-square-foot distribution center in Memphis and two smaller ones near Columbus.</p>
        <p>Submitorder.com has a dozen or so clients, including Museum Store, Zany Brainy and Bluelight.com. The company holds inventory for its clients, fills their orders, operates their call-in and e-mail centers, and helps consumers track the status of orders. Submitorder's fees are partly based on how much warehouse space its clients use -- an inducement to keep clients from insisting that slow-moving items stay in stock.</p>
        <p>''An order gets into our system, and it's picked, packed and ready to ship in seven minutes,'' said Dennis Spina, Submitorder .com's chief executive. ''But we make money on inventory turns, and if you sell one canoe, say, a year, it makes no sense to keep it in our expensive automated warehouse.''</p>
        <p>Many retailers, anxious to start their Web sales rolling, are willing to play by those rules. In January, Kmart teamed up with Yahoo and Martha Stewart Living to start Bluelight.com, which handles Kmart's online sales. Why farm out fulfillment?</p>
        <p>''It takes 9 to 12 months to bring a new warehouse to full utilization, and it'll take longer than that to know what items our Web customers will buy,'' said Alex McNealey, Bluelight.com's director of operations.</p>
        <p>Still, for many retailers, letting outsiders handle their customers requires too great a leap of faith.</p>
        <p>Until recently, Gap filled Web orders from a 270,000-square-foot warehouse in central Ohio. But that warehouse can no longer accommodate the growth in Web sales generally, let alone the orders for items like large pants and maternity clothes that the Gap sells only online.</p>
        <p>Gap just leased a 424,000-square-foot warehouse near the old one and is building one nearly twice that size nearby.</p>
        <p>''If we do it ourselves, we know that our customers are not in line behind some other retailer's customers, waiting to be served,'' said Kellie Leonard, a Gap spokeswoman.</p>
        <p>A small handful of retailers have figured out how to let their stores handle the distribution problem.</p>
        <p>Home Depot, a relative latecomer to e-tailing, has just begun Web sales to do-it-yourselfers and construction professionals. For now, its Web site will only accept orders from people with zip codes near Las Vegas -- a market growing so fast that Home Depot has hired a lot of new people who can lend a hand with the Web operation. Web customers can choose whether to pick up goods at the stores or have them delivered.</p>
        <p>Home Depot, which has well over 1,000 stores and opens a new one every two days, expects to roll its Web-sales program out nationally by next year. Web customers will only be able to order items that are stocked in their local stores, and their orders will be filled from those stores.</p>
        <p>''Our customers really want the Internet to be a version of their store, online,'' said Ron Griffin, Home Depot's chief information officer.</p>
        <p>Some retail die-hards, meanwhile, are insisting that their catalog centers can accommodate Web sales.</p>
        <p>J. C. Penney handles all Internet customer service in one center, where it employs people who are particularly good at written communication. But Dennis Radabaugh, director of logistics, says the company's five catalog fulfillment centers had enough capacity to absorb the Web orders easily.</p>
        <p>''There really isn't a need to differentiate between a phoned-in order or an Internet order,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Similarly, Eddie Bauer has plenty of space in its 1.5 million-square-foot catalog fulfillment center to fill Web orders. Customers can pay extra to have orders delivered in 24 hours; few enough do so that their requests are not overburdening the system.</p>
        <p>''Internet customers are even more sensitive to delivery price than they are to delivery speed,'' said Mark Staudinger, vice president for interactive media.</p>
        <p>So far, Container Store, a 21-store chain that sells home storage products, distributes items to its stores, catalog customers and Web customers from one center in Dallas. ''Our customers have never insisted on unreasonably fast delivery,'' said Kip Tindell, the company's president.</p>
        <p>But with Internet sales picking up, Container Store is running out of space and is renting a second all-purpose center a few blocks away. Plans are to eliminate both in a few years and move all the stock into an 800,000-square-foot facility it is now building.</p>
        <p>''We were growing anyway,'' Mr. Tindell said, ''but Internet sales were the straw that broke the camel's back.''</p>
