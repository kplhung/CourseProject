        <p>FOR the second time in two years, Gateway, which proclaims it eliminates the middleman by selling computers directly to consumers, has done the same with its advertising, turning to a documentary filmmaker for commercials rather than to its giant Madison Avenue agency.</p>
        <p>The new spots by the filmmaker, Henry Corra, began running late last week on cable television networks. There are two commercials, both featuring Theodore W.

        <p>FOR the second time in two years, Gateway, which proclaims it eliminates the middleman by selling computers directly to consumers, has done the same with its advertising, turning to a documentary filmmaker for commercials rather than to its giant Madison Avenue agency.</p>
        <p>The new spots by the filmmaker, Henry Corra, began running late last week on cable television networks. There are two commercials, both featuring Theodore W. Waitt, Gateway's founder and chairman, who is shown discussing computers with customers at Gateway Country stores. A third spot may run later.</p>
        <p>The last time Mr. Corra and his production company in New York, Corra Films, were asked to create spots for Gateway was in February 1998. He produced commercials in partnership with a New York boutique shop, DiMassimo Brand Advertising, that replaced spots created by the Gateway agency of record, D'Arcy Masius Benton &amp; Bowles in New York, part of what is now known as the Bcom3 Group.</p>
        <p>A month later, Gateway gave the gate to D'Arcy, replacing that agency on the $75 million account by McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising in New York. This time, say executives at Gateway and McCann, part of the McCann-Erickson World Group unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies, history will not repeat itself.</p>
        <p>''It's not a precursor to anything,'' Brad Williams, a spokesman for Gateway in San Diego, said of Corra's hiring. ''We've got a great relationship with McCann.''</p>
        <p>The Corra commercials have become part of a McCann campaign for Gateway that began last month, he added, which carries the theme ''People rule,'' and McCann continues to produce additional spots.</p>
        <p>Agencies have increasingly been reaching out to creative talent not on their payrolls to direct or write commercials, particularly when the newcomers can contribute ''different looks, different techniques,'' Mr. Williams said.</p>
        <p>For instance, Mr. Corra specializes in commercials shot in a no-frills style evocative of the documentaries he produces, which include ''George,'' a film that focused on his autistic son and was shown recently on HBO. His Gateway spots, which are fast-paced and mix footage of actual shoppers shot in black-and-white as well as color, contrast markedly with McCann's, which are shot conventionally and feature actors.</p>
        <p>Such outreach is particularly prevalent among agencies that work in competitive categories like computers, retailing and telecommunications as clients urge them to produce campaigns that stand out amid the commercial clutter. Mr. Corra has also worked with agencies like Merkley Newman Harty in New York and GSD&amp;M in Austin, Tex., both owned by the Omnicom Group, on spots for advertisers like BellSouth and Wal-Mart.</p>
        <p>But usually it is the agency that brings the outside talent inside, not the client. With Gateway, Mr. Corra was personally recruited both times by Mr. Waitt, whom he has known for several years.</p>
        <p>''I got a call out of the blue this summer'' from Mr. Waitt, Mr. Corra said in a telephone interview on Friday, ''who feels that I 'get' Gateway, that I have a feel for the brand because its direct relationship with the customer'' fits with my style of filmmaking.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corra said that when he agreed to Mr. Waitt's request to come along and film the visits to the Gateway Country stores, ''I didn't know if we were doing it specifically for commercials.''</p>
        <p>''Two years ago, it was 'Bail us out; we're dissatisfied with the advertising and we need some good spots,' '' he added. ''Now, this seems to me a really nice complement to the McCann work, a positive infusion of freelance creative.''</p>
        <p>''The traditional triangular relationship among client, agency and director keeps everyone apart,'' Mr. Corra said. ''My hat goes off to McCann for recognizing my work with Gateway is going to be better when I'm working through Gateway and not through the traditional system.''</p>
        <p>Stewart Alter, a spokesman for McCann, said: ''The 'people rule' brand platform is a big one and it can accommodate a documentary approach. In terms of our status, we're going ahead and developing the campaign further. We're continuing to produce more 'people rule' spots.''</p>
        <p>In fact, he added, he was speaking on behalf of the agency because the executives on the Gateway account were ''hard to reach; they're out shooting holiday commercials.''</p>
