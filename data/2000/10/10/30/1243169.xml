        <p>Candidates to head the New York Philharmonic, be they real or imagined, have been passing through town with regularity. Sir Colin Davis's appearance on Thursday at Avery Fisher Hall reminded us of the one who got away. How much warmer and more elegant musical life in either Boston or New York might have been during the last 25 years had he once made decisions that he didn't.</p>
        <p>At least the Philharmonic has Sir Colin as its principal guest conductor, ensuring his regular visits. He has a benign effect on this collection of virtuosos. Glitter is transformed into glow and patina. Relaxation replaces high-energy attacks. The program of early Schubert, early Mozart and late Haydn had force without aggression and urgency without haste. This conductor has spent a lifetime considering the problems of Classical style and has come up with wise decisions.</p>

        <p>Candidates to head the New York Philharmonic, be they real or imagined, have been passing through town with regularity. Sir Colin Davis's appearance on Thursday at Avery Fisher Hall reminded us of the one who got away. How much warmer and more elegant musical life in either Boston or New York might have been during the last 25 years had he once made decisions that he didn't.</p>
        <p>At least the Philharmonic has Sir Colin as its principal guest conductor, ensuring his regular visits. He has a benign effect on this collection of virtuosos. Glitter is transformed into glow and patina. Relaxation replaces high-energy attacks. The program of early Schubert, early Mozart and late Haydn had force without aggression and urgency without haste. This conductor has spent a lifetime considering the problems of Classical style and has come up with wise decisions.</p>
        <p>His enthusiasm for Schubert's very first symphony (he was 16 and had abandoned earlier attempts) could be shared only in part. The last two movements offer a kind of boilerplate rhetoric that repeats the Haydn-Mozart symphonic formats. The piece begins similarly with a slow chordal introduction both awkward and a little pompous.</p>
        <p>Yet immediately thereafter the soul of Schubert (and his was well-developed at an early age) begin to peek through. It begins in the descending rivulets of woodwind harmonies; they sound unlike music by any other composer.</p>
        <p>The marks of originality continue to show up in the trademark melodic gestures of the Andante. It was in this slow movement that conducting skill showed so clearly: the lyrical impulse made prominent but the underlying dance rhythm never forgotten.</p>
        <p>In Mozart's B flat Bassoon Concerto, Judith LeClair transformed her instrument. The characteristic rudeness and deep-throated rasp became a lyrical baritone voice that sang and vibrated with sweetness and grace. Ms. LeClair, who is the orchestra's principal player, removes the bassoon from its function as grit-inducing orchestral ingredient and makes it a star.</p>
        <p>It was all very beautiful, but one kept wondering if what we heard on Thursday was a concerto for some wholly different instrument of her own invention. I also wonder if Mozart didn't have something meaner and less courteous sounding in mind.</p>
        <p>Written in 1792 for his first triumphant tour of England, Haydn's Symphony No. 98 came after intermission and served as a benign and wry comment on the youthful pieces before it. The Adagio cantabile thrives on the use of silence. The finale is a comic routine played between solo voices out of the orchestra.</p>
        <p>The music manages to be both funny and deeply touching, sincere yet sly. Mozart certainly was learning from Haydn when he wrote the Bassoon Concerto at age 18. Schubert was still learning from him in 1813.</p>
