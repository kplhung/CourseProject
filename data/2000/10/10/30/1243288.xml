        <p>Congressional and administration negotiators made little progress for much of today toward agreement on the final spending and tax bills in the federal budget. The stalemate ensures that Congress, which has already set a post-World War II record for the latest adjournment date in an election year, will remain in session at least one day longer.</p>
        <p>After a day in which there were no face-to-face meetings, White House and Congressional negotiators sat down for discussions at 10 p.m. The focus of the talks was on trying to reach agreement on a $106.7 billion spending bill to finance the Labor, Health and Human Services and Education Departments. This measure is the last one to be considered by Congress and has traditionally been the most contentious.</p>
        <p>Meeting in unusual Sunday sessions -- only the 18th time Congress has met on a Sunday since World War II -- the House and the Senate once again approved stopgap spending bills to keep major portions of the federal government operating for 24 additional hours. The vote in the House was 342 to 7, and in the Senate it was 67 to 1.</p>
        <p>But the largely pro forma vote was overshadowed by finger pointing and harsh rhetoric as President Clinton's offer not to veto one tax-cut bill but to veto another bill with a tax reduction in it -- both proposals backed by the Republicans -- failed to settle the impasse.</p>
        <p>Congressional and White House negotiators held no face-to-face meetings today, though they did have discussions on the telephone. Although John D. Podesta, the White House chief of staff, and Jack Lew, director of the Office of Management and Budget, traveled to Capitol Hill today, they only met with Democratic leaders and held no talks with Republicans.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Senate Republican leaders insisted that they would not accept Mr. Clinton's demands for an increase in spending on school construction because, they said, it amounted to little more than a rich reward for his backers in the labor movement. The federal payments for construction, they noted, would fall under the provisions of the Davis-Bacon Act, which provide higher wages for construction workers.</p>
        <p>They also said they would refuse to accept provisions the administration is demanding to put into effect workplace rules that are meant to prevent occupational injuries. Labor unions support the rules, which are opposed by some business groups.</p>
        <p>Referring to those proposals, Trent Lott, the Senate majority leader, said, ''Two of the final items in dispute, two of about five, really involve a payoff to big labor that he's insisting on that we just will not agree to.'' He spoke on the ABC News program ''This Week.''</p>
        <p>But Senator Tom Daschle, the minority leader, said on ''Fox News Sunday'' that the Republican proposals would give ''three times as much in tax breaks to the executives getting business lunches as it does providing for school construction.''</p>
        <p>Tax provisions may hold the key to any talks. On Saturday Mr. Clinton told reporters that he was not irrevocably opposed to the measure, despite letters he had sent to Congress last week that said he would veto a $240 billion tax cut.</p>
        <p>''It is not true that I do not want a tax bill before the election,'' Mr. Clinton said. ''That is not true. I believe we should give some tax relief and I am more than willing to do it, but I cannot in good conscience do something that is unfair and that will aggravate some of the problems it purports to solve.''</p>
        <p>While Mr. Clinton put forth an olive branch to Congressional Republicans on the large tax cut measure that gives tax breaks to small businesses, pensions and corporations, as well as providing a $1 increase in the minimum wage, some of the president's aides suggested he might veto a spending bill that funds the Treasury Department and other agencies.</p>
        <p>Republicans have been eager for that measure to be signed because it also contains the repeal of a telephone excise tax, a move that will reduce revenue to the federal coffers by $55 billion over five years.</p>
