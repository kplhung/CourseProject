        <p>The blond wig sold for $110, the skeleton mask, $155. The top price of the afternoon was $190, for a witch hat with orange locks attached. Even a tacky construction worker's costume was the subject of a silent bidding war, a fifth and sixth grader staring each other down from opposite sides of the cafeteria, before the triumphant child marched up to hand over $100.</p>
        <p>In ''scholar dollars.''</p>
        <p>Photocopied on blue paper with the motto, ''In scholars we trust,'' the fake currency is as much a symbol of the rigorous behavior standards at the Bronx Preparatory Charter School as the old-fashioned desk in the hallway where problem children are parked. This is the carrot after all the sticks, the upside, when doing the right thing finally pays off at monthly auctions where one of the rules -- there are always rules -- is: ''You must have fun.''</p>
        <p>Every week, Bronx Prep ''scholars'' are graded on 10 non-academic attributes that support the school's founding principles, the Seven Cs: caring, character, commitment, confidence, competence, community and curiosity.</p>
        <p>Attendance counts. And effort. Participation, following directions, being a ''good teammate,'' showing improvement, expressing creativity and even sitting up straight can earn children up to $50 a week.</p>
        <p>Special treats like field trips or last Friday's Halloween Party are reserved for those who retain a $35 average (70 of the 100 students so far). Students of the month, with averages over $45, get a special Saturday outing with the principal, Marina Bernard Damiba, and the orchestra director, Jesus Concepcion. (There were 15 such stars in September, with the top student in each grade, Helen Chavez and Steve Lemus, earning an average of $49.80.)</p>
        <p>The children cherish the blue scholar dollars, eagerly competing over who has the most. The auction itself is a silent affair where students bid by holding their money aloft while Mrs. Damiba ups the ante, from $50, to $60, to $75, to $141 for a black cape or $160 for a clown wig.</p>
        <p>Last week's special Halloween auction provided a rare moment of freedom in the rigidly structured environment, as students screeched in delight and rushed up close to watch Mrs. Damiba and John Stassen, the social studies teacher, demonstrate a ''dirt eating contest,'' their faces planted in plates of chocolate pudding.</p>
        <p>Ten fifth-graders bid $85 each for a chance to taste the dirt at the Halloween party. ''I'm not going to eat the whole day for that contest,'' Ayana Gotay said as she handed over her money.</p>
