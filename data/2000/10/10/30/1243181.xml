        <p>Taking a page from the CBS programming playbook, ABC has hired one of its attractive young news correspondents to be the host of a prime-time, entertainment reality show.</p>
        <p>Anderson Cooper, who was most recently an anchor on the ABC overnight news program, ''World News Now'' (and happens to be the son of Gloria Vanderbilt, the designer), will be the host of ''The Mole,'' ABC announced last week. Scheduled to start early next year, ''The Mole'' will show 10 strangers performing ''difficult physical and psychological tasks'' while traveling the world. One contestant will be a saboteur.</p>

        <p>Taking a page from the CBS programming playbook, ABC has hired one of its attractive young news correspondents to be the host of a prime-time, entertainment reality show.</p>
        <p>Anderson Cooper, who was most recently an anchor on the ABC overnight news program, ''World News Now'' (and happens to be the son of Gloria Vanderbilt, the designer), will be the host of ''The Mole,'' ABC announced last week. Scheduled to start early next year, ''The Mole'' will show 10 strangers performing ''difficult physical and psychological tasks'' while traveling the world. One contestant will be a saboteur.</p>
        <p>The network chose Mr. Cooper, 33, to be the host of the program for fairly obvious reasons: he is on the young side and good looking (a draw to those young women so attractive to advertisers). And, since his background is in news, he can bring a certain authority to his duties -- as an informed V.J. on MTV might do.</p>
        <p>It is not dissimilar from the reasoning that went into CBS's decision last summer to hire Julie Chen, the ''Early Show'' news anchor, as host of CBS Entertainment's ''Big Brother,'' the lackluster, somewhat depressing, reality program.</p>
        <p>Of course, that move angered many journalists at CBS News, who believed it was inappropriate for Ms. Chen, a newswoman, to be the host of an entertainment show.</p>
        <p>But ABC, part of the Walt Disney Company, has taken steps to avoid a similar controversy.</p>
        <p>People at the network said that ABC News executives had decided Mr. Cooper could not keep his role as an ABC correspondent if he were to take the job on ''The Mole.''</p>
        <p>It was made clear to Mr. Cooper's representatives, they said, that once he crossed the line, he could not go back to ABC News.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cooper accepted this.</p>
        <p>''Certainly, after all of the things that were said and written about Julie Chen, I knew it would mean leaving ABC News,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cooper said, however, that he did not think the job would mean the end of his journalism career.</p>
        <p>''There is life beyond the networks, and I'm hoping to find it,'' he said.</p>
