        <p>Three polls on the New York Senate race conducted last week had widely differing results, from Hillary Rodham Clinton leading Rick A. Lazio by as much as eight percentage points to the first lady trailing Mr. Lazio by two points. When the results of these statewide polls are averaged, Mrs. Clinton leads by four points -- 48 percent to 44 percent.</p>
        <p>Varied poll results can be caused by several factors, including differences in the wording and order of questions, and the timing of the interviewing period. But the respondents interviewed in the surveys conducted by Blum &amp; Weprin, Zogby International and The New York Times/CBS News Poll were asked their voting intention in similarly worded questions, and the polling dates overlapped, with some questioning conducted during the World Series.</p>
        <p>The poll by Blum &amp; Weprin for NY1 News showed Mrs. Clinton with a seven-point advantage, and the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll gives Mrs. Clinton an eight-point margin. On the other hand, the poll for the New York Post/Fox 5 conducted by Zogby International showed the contest to be essentially tied, with Mr. Lazio's two-point edge well within the poll's margin of sampling error.</p>
        <p>The varied results could lie in the pollsters' different definitions of ''likely voters'' and in how they count New York City respondents.  Zogby International defines likely voters as registered voters who voted in 1996, have some party identification, whether Republican, Democratic or independent, and say they are likely to vote in November. Other factors that may be used to adjust the percentages include race and religion based on past voting patterns, party registration and turnout in New York City.</p>
        <p>Likely voters in the Times/CBS News Poll are registered voters who said they would definitely or probably vote in November and voted in either the 1996 presidential election or the 1998 Senate race. The Times/CBS Poll also weights the results to adjust for past turnout by region.</p>
        <p>The results of all three of these polls correct the proportion of respondents from New York City, who tend to be more Democratic than the rest of the state. New York City makes up about 40 percent of the voting-age population of the state but in past elections it accounts for only about 30 percent of the ballots cast on Election Day. The New York City voters make up about 31 percent of the respondents in Blum &amp; Weprin polls and the Times/CBS News Poll, while in Zogby polls city voters account for a smaller share -- about 28 percent.</p>
        <p>All three polls have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three to four percentage points. So, given the four-point margin of sampling error in the Times/CBS News Poll, Mrs. Clinton could be ahead by as much as 16 points, or exactly tied with Mr. Lazio. Similarly, in the Zogby poll, Mr. Lazio could be leading by as much as 10 points or behind by six points.</p>
