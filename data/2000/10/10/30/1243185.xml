        <p>The ailing Martha Graham Center of Contemporary Dance, which closed its Manhattan school in May for lack of funds, is poised to reopen in temporary quarters as soon as January with a fresh infusion of private contributions and a promise of a $750,000 capital grant from the state senator from its home district.</p>
        <p>The state contribution comes with strings; the dance center cannot get the money unless it raises $750,000 in private donations for operating expenses, said the state senator, Roy Goodman, Republican of Manhattan, who is the chairman of the special committee on the arts and cultural affairs and who made the grant from a state capital fund reserved for the arts, transit, biotechnology and economic development.</p>
        <p>The money is intended to help the modern dance company survive a ''cultural emergency,'' said Mr. Goodman. He is involved in a tough re-election battle against Liz Krueger, a Democrat and political newcomer who has for several years run the Community Food Resource Center, a nonprofit organization that helps provide food to city residents.</p>
        <p>Mr. Goodman said the timing of the grant had nothing to do with his campaign. He noted that in previous years he had steered such funds to other prominent New York arts institutions.</p>
        <p>Because of an legal battle between different factions associated with Graham's legacy, it is unclear whether, even with the money, the center will be able to teach Graham's method and dances.</p>
        <p>''It's my understanding,'' Senator Goodman said, ''that the works of Martha Graham have a limited shelf life and if allowed to moulder for any length of time, we could lose her works. There is some urgency to getting this done.''</p>
        <p>Earlier this year the Graham center's board temporarily suspended operations of the 500-student school, the company and its junior troupe because of its financial turmoil. The trustees were also caught in a bitter feud with Ron Protas, Martha Graham's heir and the company's former artistic director, who was fired earlier this year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Protas controls the rights to the dances, and his lawyer is involved in thorny discussions with the board's lawyers about whether the center's dancers can perform and teach Graham's works.</p>
        <p>Francis Mason, the chairman of the Martha Graham board, said the state's grant money would pay for the remodeling of studio space in a new building that was built on the site of the center's old headquarters on East 63rd Street. The center sold the site in 1998 to pay off a deficit of $2.4 million, which left it with no major assets.</p>
        <p>While the construction takes place, the center intends to resume classes in January in temporary studios, Mr. Mason said. It is not clear what will be taught there because of the negotiations with Mr. Protas's lawyer about rights to the dances.</p>
        <p>Dale Cendali, a lawyer representing the Graham board in the talks, said that the office of the state attorney general, Eliot L. Spitzer, had been trying to mediate the dispute,  although no talks are currently scheduled.</p>
        <p>''We want to move forward with the organization and not lose a generation of dancers,'' she said. ''At the same time we're trying to give the discussion a process to work itself out. We have a lot of flexibility in terms of what exactly could be taught.''</p>
        <p>Efforts to reach Mr. Protas or Michael Quinn, his lawyer, were unsuccessful.</p>
        <p>The board of the Graham center expects that the school could move into its permanent quarters as early as June. It plans to start paying its rent to the new building's owner next month, said Mr. Mason, who noted that the board had also hired a new architect to shape its plans.</p>
        <p>''This is the first step forward that we have been able to take since closing down temporarily in May,'' said Mr. Mason, who added that he was confident now that with the state grant, other support would follow. In the months since the closing of the school, he said, board members have personally raised about $750,000 toward the new school.</p>
        <p>''The foundation community is very interested in our returning to where we were,'' he said. ''This grant is extraordinary and the board is tremendously pleased.''</p>
