        <p>P.&amp; G. Plays Role in Merger Between Minority Suppliers  Procter and Gamble is expected to announce today that it helped orchestrate the merger of two minority-owned companies from which it buys supplies and awarded a $100 million contract to them for going through with the deal.</p>
        <p>Procter brought together Film Fabricators and Johnson-Bryce, two packaging companies in the South, assuring them a three-year $100 million contract to wrap Pampers diapers if they merged. It also promised to link them with other corporate customers. [Page C6.]</p>

        <p>Procter brought together Film Fabricators and Johnson-Bryce, two packaging companies in the South, assuring them a three-year $100 million contract to wrap Pampers diapers if they merged. It also promised to link them with other corporate customers. [Page C6.]</p>
        <p>3 Officers of Pilots' Union Resign  The top three officers of the union representing American Airlines pilots have resigned, one month after members rejected a one-year contract extension. [C6.]</p>
        <p>Copyright Office Backs Digital Law  The United States Copyright Office has endorsed a new federal law making it illegal to break the technological safeguards for books, movies and music that are distributed digitally, a decision that gives copyright holders greater control over the way people use such works. This year, a federal judge found that the Web site of 2600 magazine, whose publisher is Eric Corley, had violated the law by distributing a program designed to break the security code on DVD's so that they could be played on computers running the Linux software operating system. But when the judge issued the ruling, the law did not prohibit the actual use of such a device by individuals because of the pending review by the copyright office. [C16.]</p>
        <p>Jennings's New Book Stays at Home  Peter Jennings of ABC is moonlighting again as an author, following up the best-selling book ''The Century'' with ''America,'' both co-written with Todd Brewster. But this time ABC's parent, Walt Disney, is keeping the book at its Hyperion publishing division, to the envy of Mr. Jennings's previous publisher, the Doubleday imprint of Random House, which said it never had a chance to bid on the book.

        <p>Union Leaders Approve Actors' Pact  Representatives of television and radio commercial actors voted over the weekend to go back to work, ending a six-month strike against advertisers that was the longest talent walkout in Hollywood history. [C10.]</p>
        <p>Web Merchants Make Good on Hype  With every roll-out of a Web store in 1998 and 1999 came declarations that the shop in question would revolutionize the buying experience by making it so much easier than shopping the traditional way. The truth, of course, is that it was too seldom truly easy, and the revolution has been slow to arrive. It is a paradox then that industry survivors are actually starting to deliver on the promise of easy shopping. Bob Tedeschi: E-Commerce Report. [C14.]</p>
        <p>A Wireless Format Is Taking Hold  Two decades ago, the Ethernet standard for wiring computers into local networks caught on because it was ''open'' -- owned by no single company and available for many to adopt and improve. Those same characteristics could propel ''wireless Ethernet,'' formally known as the 802.11b wireless technical standard. The format is catching on so quickly that it could upset the plans of some of the big telecommunications giants that are planning to spend millions of dollars building third-generation cellular networks.

        <p>Gateway Turns to Filmmaker for Ads  For the second time in two years, Gateway is turning to a documentary filmmaker for commercials rather than to its giant Madison Avenue agency. Stuart Elliott: Advertising. [C18.]</p>
