        <p>Spencer Nauman has changed his mind on technology, but don't think it was easy.</p>
        <p>Last year, like so many other individual investors, he bought the racehorses of the bull market. ''The typical big names,'' he said. America Online. Microsoft. Nokia. Yahoo.</p>
        <p>''Last year, there was a feeling of invincibility, and that got even stronger early this year,'' he said. ''Now people are rethinking the assumptions they had.''</p>
        <p>And that includes Mr. Nauman, a 29-year-old student and research assistant at the University of Denver's business school. Last year, his biggest holding was Cisco Systems, the networking giant. This year, it is Berkshire Hathaway, the company controlled by Warren E. Buffett, the technophobic investor who quipped that his shareholders would have been better off if he had spent 1998 at the movies instead of at the office.</p>
        <p>Back in March, when Mr. Nauman told some of his business school buddies that he was going to dump Cisco and buy the slumping Berkshire, his idea was not well-received.</p>
        <p>Berkshire? Buffett? How retro. How quaint. But how reflective of the change of heart that has amateur and professional investors alike rethinking their love affair with technology and telecommunications stocks.</p>
        <p>Classmates, said Mr. Nauman, ''used to call me and tell me what to buy.''</p>
        <p>''It was always JDSU, Nortel and Sycamore,'' he said, referring to JDS Uniphase, Nortel Networks and Sycamore Networks, all red-hot darlings of the bull market.</p>
        <p>Then, the darlings deflated, en masse.</p>
        <p>''Now they ask me what I'm looking at,'' Mr. Nauman said. ''I can really tell there's been a change among my group of friends.''</p>
        <p>The change is that the investing pendulum is starting to swing back toward value investing, Wall Street's black sheep during the bull market.</p>
        <p>Value investors, the likes of Mr. Buffett, search for bargain stocks that have fallen out of favor but whose businesses remain sound. In stark contrast are the growth investors, like Janus Capital, the Denver-based mutual fund company that soaked up more than $35 billion in investors' money last year as its funds soared to the top of the performance charts. Growth investors pay less mind to intrinsic worth as they search for companies with accelerating earnings or revenue growth.</p>
        <p>Mr. Buffett buys Geico and Gillette. Janus buys Nokia and Sun Microsystems. During the remarkable bloom of technology and telecommunications stocks, growth investors were geniuses and value investors were the financial world's street corner Bible thumpers, begging a world gone mad to pay attention.</p>
        <p>But not this year.</p>
        <p>Mutual funds that use a value-stock model just finished another strong quarter of performance, outpacing the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 stock index and their growth-fund rivals for the second consecutive quarter -- the first time that has happened in nearly three years. Mutual fund companies that had been striking the word ''value'' from the titles of their funds are now adding the word back, or starting new value funds.</p>
        <p>For individual investors, the recent success of value investing underscores the risks inherent in betting too heavily on a single industry like technology. But value's victory is hardly complete. The charms of technology riches so easily won in the last few years are still beguiling.</p>
        <p>In September, investors took $2.2 billion out of value funds and put $9 billion into growth funds, according to the Lipper fund tracking firm. This is a comeback? It is, if you consider that in February, investors poured $34 billion of new money into growth funds and withdrew $16 billion from value funds.</p>
        <p>Still, for professional value investors -- many of whom look at their discipline as almost a religion, and thus at growth investing as apostasy -- there is a budding sense of vindication.</p>
        <p>''You had a period of the greatest speculative excesses in the history of man,'' said Martin J. Whitman, the 76-year-old, gravel-voiced manager of the $1.8 billion Third Avenue Value fund. The market's recent activity, he added, reaffirmed that ''nothing changed'' about how stocks should be valued.</p>
        <p>Robert J. Sanborn, the former manager of the Oakmark fund and a devoted value practitioner, called the technology sector ''the most mispriced asset class I've ever seen in my entire career.''</p>
        <p>''I think this is the beginning of a long trend that will favor people that think about valuations,'' he added.</p>
        <p>But there is much ground and many lost opportunities to recover. In 1998 and 1999, ''value is dead'' became a common refrain as the S.&amp; P. Barra Growth Index gained 78.9 percent while the S.&amp; P. Barra Value Index managed a 24.5 percent return.</p>
        <p>''We've seen some light for the deep value funds,'' said Russ Kinnel, an analyst at the Morningstar fund-tracking firm. ''But they were way out in Siberia. They need a lot more of it.''</p>
        <p>Still, the glimpse of daylight has the investment industry warming up to value investing. About 15 percent of new fund filings in the third quarter were for value funds, double the percentage in the first quarter, according to Maxfunds.com, an Internet company that tracks fund filings. So far this year, about 24 mutual funds have added the word value to their names -- more than the usual shifting of identities that goes on in the industry, according to data compiled from Lipper and Morningstar. More are considering.</p>
        <p>''The move afoot here is to rename MFS Equity Income the MFS Value fund,'' said John Reilly, a spokesman for MFS, the nation's 12th-largest manager of mutual funds. The $404 million MFS Equity Income fund eked out only a 7 percent return last year at a time when technology driven funds were posting triple-digit returns.</p>
        <p>This year, the fund, up 17.1 percent in a down market, is suddenly the belle of the ball, and sales have more than tripled since the beginning of the year. Part of the reason for the name change was a desire to label the fund more accurately. Part has been a changing attitude toward value investing.</p>
        <p>''We've been through an extended period where growth was the only thing anyone looked at,'' Mr. Reilly said.</p>
        <p>''The market is a lot different this year,'' he added. ''Growth was sacred for a while because it was so strong. It was the only category anybody wanted to be in.''</p>
        <p>This is some change. In the last couple of years, one prominent value money manager after another either retired or was retired involuntarily as investors withdrew tens of billions of dollars from value funds.</p>
        <p>Scott Black, a longtime value investor who runs Delphi Management, a $1.4 billion Boston investment firm, said value ''was sort of a name for an underachiever.''</p>
        <p>''It was all Janus and highflying funds,'' he added. ''Every so often John Deere or Caterpillar would rally a couple points and then go right back down. Nobody cared.''</p>
        <p>Julian H. Robertson Jr., an investor who only two years ago presided over a $21 billion hedge fund empire, closed his investment operation in March after absorbing steep losses.</p>
        <p>''We are in a market where reason does not prevail,'' Mr. Robertson, who shunned technology stocks, said at the time. Shares of Mr. Buffett's Berkshire fell 19.9 percent in 1999 as its portfolio of value stocks, including Gillette and Freddie Mac, struggled. This year the stock is up 8.8 percent, and Mr. Buffett is flexing his authority -- he recently ousted the chief executive of Gillette, where he is a board member.</p>
        <p>And then there is Mr. Sanborn, 42, an investing phenomenon of the early 90's who ran the Oakmark fund. Mr. Sanborn was more than a talented money manager. He was a Dennis Miller of financial filings who made semiannual reports funny. But last year, Mr. Sanborn's reports became downright existential.</p>
        <p>''I'm a bird at the end of a branch and all my friends are gone,'' he wrote to his diminishing base of shareholders. ''They're all day traders now.''</p>
        <p>''Where's Dr. Kevorkian when you need him?'' he quipped in another report.</p>
        <p>There was reason for his angst. After topping performance charts in the first half of the decade, his assets were trimmed from $8.9 billion in 1998 to $2 billion this September. Mr. Sanborn was removed as the fund's manager in March and now manages less than $100 million in private accounts for Harris Associates, which runs the Oakmark fund. He still is a committed value investor who favors stocks like Black &amp; Decker over America Online.</p>
        <p>Is there a sense of vindication now?</p>
        <p>''If you go to a magazine store and see 10 or 15 mutual fund magazines, all you see is the growth stocks and the growth funds to buy now,'' Mr. Sanborn said. ''I think it will be exactly the reverse two or three years from now. It'll be the value funds to buy now.''</p>
        <p>For the many individual investors who might not feel as brilliant as they did last year, there is a rethinking of strategy. Brian Dixon, a financial adviser based in Springfield, Mo., said his clients were ''starting to realize the importance of value.''</p>
        <p>''In the last five years, we've had a hard time managing people's emotions,'' he added. ''They're captivated by growth and it's hard to convince them to buy a value fund or a bond fund. Now people say, 'Yeah, you were right.' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Nauman, who can see the headquarters of Janus Capital from the window of his Denver apartment,  lost faith in a Janus favorite, Cisco, when he realized that the company's market capitalization would need to reach an unlikely $1 trillion in five years if its stock rose 15 percent annually.</p>
        <p>''That's just insane,'' he said. ''Cisco would rule the world.''</p>
        <p>Still, long-term growth investors like Janus are so far ahead of value investors, it will be some time before value investors can truly call it a comeback.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sanborn, the most ardent of value believers, once wrote that he would act like Billy (White Shoes) Johnson, a kick returner and receiver in the 70's for the Houston Oilers who was known for his exuberant on-field celebrations, when technology stocks finally get their comeuppance.</p>
        <p>''When my prediction on the likely underperformance of high technology stocks comes to fruition, I will do some similar in-your-face crowing,'' Mr. Sanborn wrote.</p>
        <p>That was in his annual report of December 1995, before the Nasdaq's meteoric climb began.</p>
