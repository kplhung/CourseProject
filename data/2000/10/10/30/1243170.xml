        <p>Garry Kasparov extended his hand with a draw offer after only 14 moves of Game 13 of his Brain Games Network World Chess Championship match in London yesterday and Vladimir Kramnik shook it. That made the score Kramnik 7 1/2, Kasparov 5 1/2, and it reduced the champion's chance to retain his title to zilch.</p>
        <p>All Kramnik needs to take the majority of points in this 16-game series is one victory or two 2 more draws, and Kasparov hasn't won a game from him yet.</p>

        <p>Garry Kasparov extended his hand with a draw offer after only 14 moves of Game 13 of his Brain Games Network World Chess Championship match in London yesterday and Vladimir Kramnik shook it. That made the score Kramnik 7 1/2, Kasparov 5 1/2, and it reduced the champion's chance to retain his title to zilch.</p>
        <p>All Kramnik needs to take the majority of points in this 16-game series is one victory or two 2 more draws, and Kasparov hasn't won a game from him yet.</p>
        <p>But the question the entire chess world is asking is, What is Kasparov doing, anyway?</p>
        <p>When he has Black, he fights energetically to avoid loss, but when he has White and the advantage of the initial move, he seems to be just sulking. The greatest player in the world for the last 15 years tanking? Incomprehensible.</p>
        <p>Against Kasparov's Ruy Lopez, Kramnik reverted to the Berlin Defense, which has held up so well for him in this series. After 3 . . . Nf6 4 O-O Ne4 5 d4 Nd6 6 Bc6 dc 7 de Nf5 8 Qd8 Kd8, Black has gotten the two bishops, but White enjoys an advantage in space from his advanced e5 pawn.</p>
        <p>Black's four-pawn cluster, containing a doubled pawn, on the queen's wing is a defect because it cannot produce a passed pawn against White's three-pawn queenside group. But these features have never been easy for White to exploit.</p>
        <p>This game copied Game 9 until Kasparov substituted 10 h3 for 10 Rd1. Instead of holding his queen knight in readiness for the usual maneuver Ne2 and Nf4, Kasparov played 11 Ne4 and after 11 . . . c5, he played 12 c3!?</p>
        <p>Quite unusual, because it puts a pawn on the same color as White's only bishop and thus limits its effectiveness. It also creates a weak light square at d3. It does threaten 13 g4 Ne7 14 Nc5, but that doesn't seem to have any long-term consequences.</p>
        <p>Some explanation is needed for Kasparov's stopping the game with a draw offer after his 14 g4. The game is even, true enough, but it is not played out.</p>
        <p>Game 14 will start tomorrow at 3 p.m. London time. Games 15 and 16 are set for Thursday and Saturday.</p>
