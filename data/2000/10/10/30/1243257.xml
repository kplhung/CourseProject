        <p>The gusting wind sent snow flurries from sideline to sideline, and Kerry Collins, awaiting the opening kickoff, stood next to the Giants' bench with his helmet on and a smile peeking through his face mask.</p>
        <p>Growing up in eastern Pennsylvania, a fan of the Philadelphia Eagles, he had seen weather like this on television from Giants Stadium -- papers swirling at the base of the grandstand, flags at opposite ends of the stadium flapping in opposite directions, faces red and eyes bloodshot from the force of the intractable wind.</p>
        <p>''I kind of thought, 'So this is what it's like,' '' Collins said later.</p>
        <p>It was a Giants kind of day. And when it was over, when the Giants' 24-7 rout of the Eagles was complete and the Giants had a 6-2 record -- their best since the 1990 Super Bowl season -- Collins knew exactly what that meant in every critical sense.</p>
        <p>Today's victory was the archetype for how the 2000 Giants were designed to function, a study in the application of a plan. The wind just gave it atmosphere.</p>
        <p>There was Collins, throwing 37 times for the Giants for 253 yards with 22 completions and no interceptions. There was the Giants' top wide receiver, Amani Toomer, coming back from a benching in the previous game to catch 9 passes for 108 yards and a touchdown.</p>
        <p>There was the rookie running back Ron Dayne, wearing Rodney Hampton's old jersey number (27) and performing like a Hampton clone with 93 rushing yards -- 71 in the second half, when he protected the Giants' lead with 20 punishing, time-consuming carries.</p>
        <p>There was Tiki Barber with 52 perfectly complementary rushing yards and another 71 receiving yards.</p>
        <p>Finally, and perhaps most significant because virtually every winning Giants team has been built on defense, not offense, there were the Giants' defenders, who sacked the Eagles' gifted quarterback, Donovan McNabb, four times, stopped Philadelphia in 10 of 11 third-down conversion attempts and held the Eagles to 192 total yards.</p>
        <p>Standing in the Giants' locker room four hours after the opening kickoff, Collins could smile again and know exactly what he saw.</p>
        <p>''That was the model of how we're supposed to play,'' he said.</p>
        <p>And if the Giants sometimes play inelegantly, especially on offense, the Giants have a response: So what?</p>
        <p>''We're 6-2 and all I read about is what we can't do,'' Giants Coach Jim Fassel said.</p>
        <p>Fassel then offered an apt analysis, even if it included a backhanded compliment to his own charges.</p>
        <p>''We force the other people not to play good, too,'' Fassel said.</p>
        <p>In a numbing wind that gusted to 22 miles an hour and brought the temperature to 31 degrees with the wind-chill factor, the Giants played with steady control. They missed opportunities, but they held the football for a stunning 43 minutes 41 seconds in a game they never trailed, their most extensive possession time in 12 years. The game plan was to throw short passes slanting toward the middle of the field to take advantage of the Eagles' blitzing safeties, and to run with Dayne and Barber as the Philadelphia defense tired. To make it work, Collins had to be sharp despite the wind.</p>
        <p>Collins completed his first five passes, and soon Dayne was scoring a first-quarter touchdown on a 1-yard run. On an Eagle safety blitz in the second quarter, Collins hit Toomer slanting across the center of the field, and Toomer ran into the gap created by the blitz for a 27-yard touchdown.</p>
        <p>Running back Joe Montgomery, a reserve, scored the clincher in the fourth quarter. Brad Daluiso had a 31-yard fourth-quarter field goal.</p>
        <p>The Giants moved into a tie with Washington for first place in the National Football Conference East and are 4-1 in the division. The Eagles fell to 5-4 over all.</p>
        <p>It was a milestone victory of sorts. The Giants, who had a bye in their schedule last week, had never won following their bye in three previous seasons under Fassel. It was also the Giants' eighth consecutive victory over the Eagles for Fassel, who has never lost to Philadelphia. And it gave the Giants their best midseason record since the 1990 team was 8-0.</p>
        <p>''The bye week was obviously on my mind,'' Fassel said. ''I took a very aggressive approach with the team all week. I think it helped set the tone we needed.''</p>
        <p>The Giants' defense certainly came out prepared, thwarting McNabb's passing attempts and containing his scrambling. There were few stellar defensive plays but rather an unending, effective consistency. The Eagles' only score, a 25-yard touchdown pass from McNabb to Charles Johnson, came with 5:12 left in a game the Giants had already put away.</p>
        <p>''It's weird because we don't have one guy who's out there killing people,'' Giants defensive end Michael Strahan said. ''But everybody gets to where they're supposed to be on the field, and then they make the tackle or block the hole.''</p>
        <p>After the Eagles had punted following three plays on their first possession, the Giants drove for their first score, a touchdown sparked by a 36-yard pass from Collins to Barber that moved them to the Eagles' 20-yard line.</p>
        <p>A Collins-to-Toomer completion for 13 yards advanced the football to the Philadelphia 7-yard line. Collins scrambled to the 1-yard line on the next play. From there, Dayne easily powered over right guard Ron Stone into the end zone for a 7-0 lead.</p>
        <p>Just before intermission, the Giants' defense stopped Philadelphia for no gain on three successive plays, forcing the Eagles to punt from their 4-yard line. The Giants were likely to get the football near midfield, but their field position was made better when Philadelphia linebacker Ike Reese was whistled for a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty.</p>
        <p>It set up Toomer's quick slant inside. He beat Philadelphia cornerback Troy Vincent, caught Collins's crisply fired pass and dashed up the middle of the field unimpeded for a 27-yard touchdown and a 14-0 lead.</p>
        <p>Another series of Collins-to-Toomer throw-and-catch combinations -- along with punishing runs from Dayne -- led to Daluiso's field goal early in the fourth quarter. Montgomery scored when Dayne, who had carried the ball six times in nine plays, went out with stomach distress. The little-used Montgomery broke a tackle at the 2-yard line and charged in for a 4-yard touchdown run and a 24-0 Giants lead.</p>
        <p>''I thought it was a complete game for us,'' Collins said. ''There's always things you can do better, but I saw a lot of good signs. I saw us win the way we want to, and regardless of how you do it, that's the best sign of all.''</p>
