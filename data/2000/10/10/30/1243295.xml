        <p>Re ''Emergency Room, to Many, Remains the Doctor's Office'' (front page, Oct. 25):</p>
        <p>New York State's plan to force Medicaid patients into managed care has been a failure. Participation has been low, and those enrolled have difficulty getting to see their primary care physician because, under capitation, these doctors have financial incentives not to see them.</p>
        <p>Routine care provided in the emergency room is expensive and wasteful, especially when you consider that these visits all too frequently result in admission to the hospital. I observe, on a daily basis, Medicaid patients hospitalized for problems and conditions that could readily be treated in outpatient departments.</p>
        <p>Raising physician fees to market levels or, better still, allowing Medicaid patients to enroll in the health care plan of their choice would have an immediate effect on the overuse of emergency room and hospital services.</p>
