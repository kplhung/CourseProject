        <p>Robert W. Pittman, the president of America Online, caused a frisson at the conference here run by the Magazine Publishers of America when he announced that in the last five months, AOL had sold 500,000 subscriptions to Time Inc. magazines.</p>
        <p>To an audience of magazine executives who privately spoke of their willingness to crawl on their naked bellies through the Gobi desert for a dozen paid subscribers, the news came like a long frosty drink of Evian. Relief -- magazine subscribers via the Internet! 500,000 of them! Manna from heaven! -- was in sight.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Pittman's figures beg a compelling set of questions for the magazine industry; especially as it scrambles for new ways to bolster circulation levels in the face of declining newsstand sales, an expected increase in periodical postal rates and the collapse of the sweepstakes houses, which alone has removed millions of potential subscribers from publishers' pockets.</p>
        <p>Among the questions are: Will subscriptions gained online be as reliable as those obtained through traditional methods? Is there a possible liability in the vogue on the Internet for signing up so-called ''evergreen'' subscriptions? Those are are renewed automatically on credit cards unless consumers specifically ask for them to be stopped.</p>
        <p>And as far as Time Inc.'s parent, Time Warner, and America Online go, can the two prospective merger partners work together? Are each other's best interests -- if only as far as promoting Time Inc. magazines like Money, In Style and Sports Illustrated is concerned -- economically compatible? And, if they are, will competitors be crushed?</p>
        <p>A closer look at Mr. Pittman's 500,000 figure is revealing. While it sounds large, many of the subscriptions are not yet paid for. They were offered in pop-up boxes on America Online -- some of the most valued commercial real estate on the AOL sites -- on a free-trial basis. That means consumers get several issues of a magazine -- sometimes months' worth -- with the option of canceling before they are even charged.</p>
        <p>No one knows how many of those subscribers will pay up, much less keep coming back. In other words, whether or not, in the jargon of the Internet, they are ''sticky.''</p>
        <p>The Internet tends to be a free-wheeling world, where it is easier, more tempting and possibly just more fun to order something with the click of a mouse than by filling out a form and walking to the mailbox. That may bring more subscribers, but it also brings fast-fingered consumers who might experience something of an Internet-shopping hangover, and who might later change their minds more readily about what they ordered.</p>
        <p>Of Mr. Pittman's number, Jeremy Koch, the senior vice-president for consumer marketing at Time Inc., said: ''This figure does not necessarily mean 500,000 subscriptions. It means 500,000 gross starts.''</p>
        <p>Of those ''gross starts,'' 95 percent were put on credit cards. And 50 percent of those are the ''evergreen,'' also called ''negative option,'' subscriptions. That is different from the usual arrangement in which magazine publishers contact their customers near the end of their subscription terms and beg them to renew. The evergreens are increasingly being used for subscriptions collected on the Web, executives at several companies said.</p>
        <p>That kind of arrangement is already raising concerns in an area of the magazine industry that is highly sensitive to controversy. Two of the industry's most profitable long-term subscription campaigns, the sweepstakes run by American Family Publishers and Publishers Clearing House, have collapsed in the last year after their tactics finally angered consumers to the point that they prompted lawsuits by the attorneys general of several states.</p>
        <p>(At Gruner &amp; Jahr, for example, 2.5 million subscriptions came in for magazines off those so-called stampsheets last year, said the company's chief executive, Daniel B. Brewster Jr., at the conference, but only 200,000 this year. Next year, he said, he expects almost none.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Koch also said that his division at Time Inc. was specifically monitoring consumer reactions to evergreen subscriptions.</p>
        <p>''We are trying to be very careful about continuous service,'' he said.  ''We need to be very careful about doing all the things that remind them of the deal so that when their credit card is charged, they do not feel we are pulling a fast one.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Koch said that AOL's gathering of Time Inc. subscriptions was is still just a test. At its heart is whether AOL will find it profitable to use such coveted commercial real estate for offers for magazine subscriptions, he said.</p>
        <p>''I think AOL has in the spirit of this agreement thrown itself behind this effort, without worrying too much about the lost cost of other things they might be promoting,'' Mr. Koch said. ''So this is a sort of assessment stage we are in right now, where both sides need to look at whether what we are doing is good for the other party. Do we make more money by cross-promoting this way or is there an opportunity cost that is not good for the company?''</p>
        <p>No one will talk about the exact terms of the arrangement but it is believed that Time Inc. is being cut a break. As part of the deal, Time Inc. distributes new AOL 6.0 installation disks with several Time Inc. magazines and in arrangement with some retail outlets.</p>
        <p>Mr. Koch said he would characterize the promotion so far as ''a promising experiment in cross-selling that hopefully we can build into something bigger.''</p>
        <p>If it does get bigger, that will only further alarm executives at other magazine companies, who say that Time Inc. has an enormous advantage in attracting AOL's consumer eyeballs. ''There has never been a greater opportunity in the history of consumer magazines for marketing subscriptions than with Time Inc. and AOL,'' said Chip Block, the publishing strategist at Ziff-Davis Publishing.</p>
        <p>Others suggested there might be pitfalls. Stephen Sutton, the executive director of consumer marketing at Ziff-Davis Publishing, said that if less than 50 percent of subscribers did not fulfill their payments, then Time Inc. risked sending out millions of free issues to people who never intended to pay their bills, or ''bad-pay copies.'' And he also raised the question of AOL's long-term plans.</p>
        <p>''It seems to me that this is a big question for AOL in terms of the resources devoted to the subscription offers,'' he said. ''Do they want to use that space to promote magazine subscriptions?''</p>
        <p>Ziff-Davis has been soliciting subscriptions off of the Internet since 1996, Mr. Sutton said, when subscriptions to the company's Yahoo! Internet Life magazine were first offered on the Yahoo Web site. Since 1996, 2 million subscriptions have come in to the magazine through Yahoo, he said. (Mr. Sutton said that now most of the subscriptions sold on Yahoo were evergreen; the company began by selling traditional subscriptions.)</p>
        <p>Virtually every large magazine company is beginning to think about its Internet subscription strategy.</p>
        <p>While some are reaping real circulation benefits, others are just beginning to dip in their toes.</p>
        <p>Among the more successful ones are Dennis Publishing, which gets 15,000 subscriptions for Maxim magazine via Maximonline.com every month, said Stephen Colvin, the company's president. Hearst Magazines has in the last four months logged over 230,000 subscriptions to O: The Oprah Magazine off of Oprah.com, according to a Hearst spokeswoman -- which means that roughly one in five subscribers came in off the Internet.</p>
        <p>For now, the magic number -- despite its caveats -- is 500,000. Magazine publishers who do not have tentative mergers planned with online giants are feeling a little, well, envious, despite themselves.</p>
        <p>''I am not an envious person usually,'' Mr. Block of Ziff-Davis said. ''And right now, I am.''</p>
