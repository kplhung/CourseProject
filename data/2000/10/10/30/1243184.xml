        <p>Nordstrom is a prestigious retailer that prides itself on customer service. But an e-mail marketing campaign last week for its Web site, Nordstrom.com, illustrates the pitfalls of relaxing standards on protecting customer information.</p>
        <p>The mailing list was compiled by the Acxiom Corporation, a data supplier in Little Rock, Ark.</p>
        <p>For a fee, the company takes a client's customer data and matches it with names and e-mail addresses in Acxiom's own database.</p>
        <p>Using customer names provided by Nordstrom, Acxiom generated a list of e-mail addresses to which a subcontractor then sent a promotional message from the store's Web site.</p>
        <p>''Dear CUSTOMER NAME,'' the message began, ''We'd like to thank you for being a Nordstrom customer, and let you know about all that we have to offer online 24 hours a day.''</p>
        <p>In at least one case, the Acxiom list was inaccurate. One of the Nordstrom.com e-mails, addressed to a woman named Diana, was instead sent to a business e-mail address based on the name of one of Diana's co-workers, a man named Mike.</p>
        <p>It was not Mike's actual e-mail address. But because the address contained the Internet domain name of Diana and Mike's employer, an investor relations firm in Manhattan, the message made its way to their employer's e-mail server computer.</p>
        <p>Confused? So was the e-mail server, which also forwarded the message to a list of the employer's business contacts.</p>
        <p>In an interview, Mike, who asked that his full name not be published, said he had never entered a Nordstrom store.</p>
        <p>Diana, who also requested anonymity, said she had purchased something in a Nordstrom catalog in the past. But both said they had never given Nordstrom an e-mail address.</p>
        <p>What does Nordstrom have to say about an e-mail marketing campaign that raises questions about accuracy and privacy?</p>
        <p>Shasha Richardson, a spokeswoman for Nordstrom.com, said it was the first time the company had tried to gather e-mail addresses in this manner, and would not necessarily do so again. She did not comment on the misdirected e-mail. ''Right now, we're evaluating feedback from our customers,'' she said. ''Based on that we'll determine if we continue doing this.''</p>
        <p>She also noted that the promotional e-mail gave recipients the option of asking to be dropped from Nordstrom's e-mail list.</p>
        <p>While Acxiom would not comment on the Nordstrom mailing, Allison Marr, an Acxiom product manager, acknowledged that the company does not verify the e-mail addresses in its database, most of which are bought from other companies that have collected the information from customers.</p>
        <p>Dan McLean, vice president for sales and marketing at Boomerang.com, the subcontractor that transmitted the Nordstrom mailing, said matching e-mail addresses with customer data from other sources was a challenge.</p>
        <p>''There are a couple things in the process that may cause odd things to happen,'' Mr. McLean said. ''It's not an exact science by any stretch of the imagination.''</p>
