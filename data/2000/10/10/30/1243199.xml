        <p>An army lieutenant colonel in command of 60 soldiers declared a mutiny today in an effort to press President Alberto K. Fujimori to resign. The dissident group briefly took control of a mining center, took a general hostage and then traveled in a truck and bus toward the remote highlands of Puno province.</p>
        <p>The small rebellion began in the predawn hours in the southern mining center of Toquepala, a few hours after President Fujimori replaced the commanders of the army, navy and air force. The shuffling of the high command came as efforts by the armed forces and the police to seize Mr. Fujimori's former spy chief, Vladimiro Montesinos, continued without success.</p>
        <p>In a communique, the rebellious Lt. Col. Ollanta Moises Humala Tasso said, ''I will only lay down my arms when the chain of command is legitimate and there is a president who has been truly elected by the people to whom I would be able to swear my subordination.''</p>
        <p>In a separate radio interview, the rebel officer called on other members of the armed forces to join the rebellion. The young officer was joined in the uprising by a brother, a retired major who was recently forced to leave the military.</p>
        <p>There were no immediate reports of violence, and the military appeared cautious in reacting. Military units near Toquepala, which lies near the Chilean border, did not move against the dissidents.</p>
        <p>But the military appeared to take the threat of a larger mutiny seriously. The army commander, Gen. Walter Chacon, and Defense Minister Carlos Bergamino conferred with Mr. Fujimori for several hours at the presidential palace today, and the army released a toughly worded communique condemning ''the serious breakdown of discipline.''</p>
        <p>The political situation has become increasingly unpredictable since Mr. Montesinos returned to Peru on Monday after a month's exile in Panama. He faces several allegations of money laundering, torture and corruption, but he is still believed to have influential allies throughout the security forces who may be protecting him from arrest.</p>
        <p>After a videotape surfaced last month showing Mr. Montesinos paying a bribe to a newly elected opposition congressman to switch political parties, Mr. Fujimori announced that he would step down from the presidency next July after new elections.</p>
        <p>Military observers said the uprising was a sign that many middle-ranking officers have long disagreed with how promotions in recent years have depended on political connections to Mr. Montesinos and Mr. Fujimori.</p>
        <p>''As a force, 60 men is nothing, but this is a message,'' said a retired general, Jaime Salinas Sedo. ''Many officials in the armed forces are indignant.'' Members of the opposition were quick to distance themselves from the revolt, saying they wanted a constitutional transition toward new presidential elections scheduled for April 8.</p>
        <p>Alejandro Toledo, an opposition leader who ran against Mr. Fujimori in elections this year, called the uprising ''worrisome'' and ''another symptom of the discontent'' within the armed forces. ''It is time for President Fujimori to resign for the sake of stability,'' Mr. Toledo added.</p>
