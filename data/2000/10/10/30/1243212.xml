        <p>Accusations of racism have divided a law school faculty here in recent weeks, opening an unusually public debate about the role of diversity in legal education here and across the country.</p>
        <p>The public focus on the University of Florida's law school, often said to be the best in the state, began last month when a black associate dean, Kenneth B. Nunn, resigned his administrative position. He says some white professors have blocked the hiring of black professors for years and have resisted the advancement of those who have been hired.</p>
        <p>''I did not want to serve as window dressing to make it seem there was a concern for diversity that I did not think was present,'' Professor Nunn said in his office, which is decorated with a large poster of Jackie Robinson. After 10 years on the faculty, and following the departure of a handful of other black professors in recent years, Professor Nunn, 42, is the only African-American professor teaching this year on a faculty of 50.</p>
        <p>Since Professor Nunn's resignation from the administration, black professors who formerly taught at the school have described an atmosphere of hostility. Some white law professors have argued that calls for diversity overshadow the need to provide basic legal education. And newspapers across the state have reported on the spectacle of law professors publicly at war.</p>
        <p>''This month has been one of the great race awareness or sensitivity programs anywhere,'' said the school's dean, Jon L. Mills. ''This is painful because people are reluctant to talk about this.''</p>
        <p>About 13 percent of law school professors nationally are members of minorities, according to the American Bar Association. The public discussion of diversity in legal education is often limited to bland descriptions of goals, though some professors say law school diversity may be more important than elsewhere because of the profession's influence.</p>
        <p>But behind the scenes, professors here and at other law schools say, the implementation of diversity goals sometimes sparks tensions. ''At law schools nationally there are issues with respect to people of color feeling welcome at their institutions,'' said Berta Esperanza Hernandez-Truyol, who recently joined the faculty here. One of three Hispanic professors at Gainesville, she is the chairwoman of the minority section of the American Association of Law Schools.</p>
        <p>Professor Nunn's public stance is the first to draw such attention to diversity at law schools since 1992, when a black professor, Derrick Bell, resigned from Harvard Law School to protest the lack of tenured black women on the faculty.</p>
        <p>At the law school here, the Frederic G. Levin College of Law, people on both sides of the issue say tensions have simmered for years.</p>
        <p>Joseph W. Little, a white law professor and a former mayor of Gainesville, has been critical of what he says are baseless charges, calling them ''racial McCarthyism.'' He said that he supported hiring minority professors, but that competition for them was intense and they were sometimes lured away by other schools.</p>
        <p>Professor Little argued that proponents have continued to press for diversity at the expense of the school's 1,200 students, some 300 of whom are members of minorities.</p>
        <p>''If it comes to hiring teachers for our core courses and hiring a person that's black just because he's black,'' Professor Little said, ''I will hire for the core course, and I am unabashed about that.'' (Here as at many universities, the faculty has considerable authority in hiring decisions.)</p>
        <p>But black law professors who have worked here said opponents of diversity efforts often claimed that no qualified black candidate could be found as a way of defeating such efforts. ''In America the race question can't be talked about openly and honestly, so there's always an effort to say it must be something else,'' said Michelle S. Jacobs, a black associate professor who is on leave from the law school here and teaching at the historically black Howard University School of Law.</p>
        <p>Charles R. Pouncy, a black law professor who now teaches at Temple University's law school in Philadelphia, said he encountered racial hostility here. He said, for example, that students told him a white professor had apologized to them, saying their education would suffer because the school had been forced to hire ''affirmative action'' professors.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mills, a former Democratic speaker of the Florida House of Representatives who has been the interim dean for a year (and who appointed Professor Nunn to the administration), said there had seldom been overt signs of racism. The bigger problems, he said, were ''sins of omission'' in allowing minority professors to feel unwelcome. Last week, he added, the faculty overwhelmingly voted to keep diversity as a priority, and this week the school hired a conflict-resolution consultant to help with the dispute.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Nunn said he had grown weary of policy statements accompanied by quiet resistance.</p>
        <p>''The reason is fear,'' he said, explaining why he thought his white colleagues found reasons not to hire black professors. ''If we hire people who are like ourselves, that tells us we are good people and we deserve our jobs.''</p>
        <p>The real test for the law school will come next year, Professor Nunn said, when he learns whether he is still the only African-American teaching law here.</p>
