        <p>The day before training camp began, the Nets were all in their uniforms, mugging for the cameras.</p>
        <p>Stephon Marbury and Keith Van Horn joined Kenyon Martin, the No. 1 overall pick in the National Basketball Association draft last June, for a special shot, forming the trio of the future. Byron Scott, the new coach, presided over the day, ready to work his players into shape and riding high on rookie optimism.</p>
        <p>Then the annual Nets tsunami hit.</p>
        <p>Once again, injuries have delayed, if not diluted, the promise of a new year as the Nets begin the 2000-1 season tomorrow night at the Meadowlands against Cleveland without two starters and two key reserves.</p>
        <p>Van Horn, a forward and the Nets' second-leading scorer, fractured his left fibula during an Oct. 17 preseason game and will miss most of the first month. So will the backup shooting guard Lucious Harris, who is recovering from Oct. 5 hernia surgery. Last season's leading rebounder, Jamie Feick, will return in January, at the earliest, after Achilles' tendon surgery.</p>
        <p>''For us, in the first month of November, we want to make sure we hold our head above water,'' Scott said.</p>
        <p>Van Horn, the No. 2 overall draft pick in 1997, surged in the second half of last season, revealing his long-awaited All-Star potential. Now his future is uncertain again. And if the Nets are to surpass last season's 31-51 record, as Scott predicted, they must keep busy while waiting for Van Horn to return.</p>
        <p>''We have to hold the fort down and at least stay .500 and hope we have no more injuries,'' said Kendall Gill, the 32-year-old veteran who has been the Nets' most encouraging surprise this camp, shooting a team-best 62 percent.</p>
        <p>Known for his defensive prowess, Gill was rejuvenated over the summer by changing his shooting mechanics, as well as by signing a $7 million-plus contract. He also moved from small forward back to shooting guard to replace Kerry Kittles.</p>
        <p>The Nets expect Kittles to miss most or all of this season rehabilitating from right knee surgery. Last season, Kittles missed 13 games in November while recovering from surgery on the same knee, and the team went 2-11. That start, coupled with 11 straight losses to close the season, led to a sixth-place finish in the Atlantic Division.</p>
        <p>Scott, the Nets' fourth coach in five years, won three championships as a player with the Los Angeles Lakers, and he pledged that the Nets will be an improved team.</p>
        <p>But no matter how up-tempo and defensive-minded the Nets will be under the 39-year-old Scott -- a protege in Los Angeles of the disciplinarian Pat Riley, the Nets have not been in sync offensively. They struggled to score in the preseason and committed 116 turnovers in 6 games. They have had to adjust to new starters at four positions in a new offense.</p>
        <p>Marbury, the 23-year-old point guard, is the only player returning to his position. And with Van Horn out and Martin struggling, this team belongs to Marbury. ''I think we're going to be O.K.; we just have to believe in what we're doing and get a feel for each other,'' Marbury said. ''It's tough. You just have to play with the guys you have.''</p>
        <p>Scott has criticized Marbury for not playing at full speed this preseason. Marbury, the leading scorer last season with a 22.2 average, knows he has to improve his shooting, but he is also concerned by the weakness in the frontcourt. ''We've got to pound the ball down low,'' Marbury said. ''Our big guys have to step up and start making some big plays. That will open up the inside for us.''</p>
        <p>The pivot is the Nets' most unproven position. Scott will start 6-foot-11-inch Evan Eschmeyer, last year's second-round draft pick, at center. With Feick out, Eschmeyer emerged as the best of three candidates in the preseason, leading with 6.1 rebounds in the 6 preseason games. He will be replacing Jim McIlvaine as the starter. McIlvaine, a seven-year veteran, is less mobile and more foul prone. This year's second-round draft pick, 7-foot Soumaila Samake, is quick but still learning the game.</p>
        <p>Aaron Williams, the 6-9, 225-pound center or power forward, signed a $17 million, six-year contract that could be the Nets' insurance policy this season. Williams, a voracious rebounder, has played with seven teams in seven seasons; the Nets need him to find a more consistent offensive game.</p>
        <p>Without Van Horn, Scott will depend on Williams, mostly as a force off the bench. Martin will start at power forward. The Nets may have won the draft lottery with Martin, but are still unsure of their prize after his uninspiring training camp.</p>
        <p>''At times he has shown signs of greatness and then signs of being an ordinary player,'' Scott said.</p>
        <p>Martin finished the preseason with back-to-back double-doubles. He averaged 7.1 rebounds and 12.2 points in the preseason, but he still needs to learn N.B.A. defenses and to get into shape.</p>
        <p>Originally, Scott envisioned Van Horn and Martin switching off at power and small forward, an explosive combination when ignited by Marbury. But Van Horn strained ligaments in his left knee in the first week of camp and returned briefly in the third game, only to be injured again.</p>
        <p>''It was the first time he and Kenyon were on the floor together and I thought, 'O.K., now, I can see this team coming together,' '' Scott recalled. Minutes later, Van Horn fell awkwardly and Scott's vision disintegrated.</p>
        <p>The Nets had been cautious with Martin as he worked himself into shape as he recovered from a broken fibula sustained last March. They need him to emerge now. ''I can't play like a rookie anymore,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The rookie free agent Stephen Jackson is ecstatic to have won a spot on the 12-man roster with his explosive offensive talent, let alone earn a temporary starting spot. Jackson, 22, who did not go to college but played professionally in Venezuela and Wisconsin, can play small forward or shooting guard.</p>
        <p>The reserve forward Johnny Newman is a 15-year veteran who can still deliver 20-point games, and Scott prefers to see him coming off the bench. Newman is joined there by the veteran point guard Sherman Douglas, back from last season's ankle surgery. Douglas can spell Marbury, or move him at times to shooting guard.</p>
        <p>''People are expecting us to lose now that we've lost Keith and we've had so many injuries,'' Scott said. ''I've always been the underdog in my life. I look to this as a great challenge.</p>
        <p>''We need to get better and better, and as Keith comes back and Lucious comes back, we're at full strength in December, we'll see how good we are.''</p>
