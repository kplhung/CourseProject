        <p>When it's over, your mind will be filled with grotesque images: of a man's brains being scooped out of his skull with a sword and smeared across a church floor; of another man being disemboweled while he's still alive; of yet another killed by a hot iron shoved up his rectum. This may sound like a Halloween special conceived by Quentin Tarantino, but it's part of an extraordinary academic exercise called ''A History of Britain,'' which begins tonight on the History Channel.</p>
        <p>The London-born historian, art critic and professor Simon Schama (now teaching at Columbia University), has transformed a six-hour lecture covering the first 50 centuries of British history into an engrossing piece of performance art for television. This BBC production keeps Mr. Schama, its writer and narrator, scrambling around all kinds of rocks and ruins that illustrate one corner of English history or another, from the Stone Age village of Skara Brae in the Orkney Islands to medieval abbeys and castles in France.</p>

        <p>When it's over, your mind will be filled with grotesque images: of a man's brains being scooped out of his skull with a sword and smeared across a church floor; of another man being disemboweled while he's still alive; of yet another killed by a hot iron shoved up his rectum. This may sound like a Halloween special conceived by Quentin Tarantino, but it's part of an extraordinary academic exercise called ''A History of Britain,'' which begins tonight on the History Channel.</p>
        <p>The London-born historian, art critic and professor Simon Schama (now teaching at Columbia University), has transformed a six-hour lecture covering the first 50 centuries of British history into an engrossing piece of performance art for television. This BBC production keeps Mr. Schama, its writer and narrator, scrambling around all kinds of rocks and ruins that illustrate one corner of English history or another, from the Stone Age village of Skara Brae in the Orkney Islands to medieval abbeys and castles in France.</p>
        <p>As the centuries progress, paintings, buildings, tapestries and even animals (representing human characteristics) are added to the visual props. To further satisfy television's demand for pictures, the producers have included brief re-creations of ancient battles, which seem a little corny at first, but actually do convey a sense of the gory flesh-and-bone intimacy of face-to-face combat. John Harle's energetic and intelligent score translates the pulse of events into music.</p>
        <p>But the excitement doesn't come from these sensory enhancements. The excitement comes from the unlikely Mr. Schama, a mild-looking man with a large and infectious passion for his subject, a wry sense of humor and an elegant yet colloquial style. Describing William the Conqueror's Domesday Book, a detailed inventory of the land and possessions acquired after the Battle of Hastings, Mr. Schama refers to William as ''the first database king,'' who understood that information is power.</p>
        <p>This scholar isn't a bit lofty as he explains later what it meant for Henry II to create English common law. ''Before Henry, justice was: 'Do what I want. I'm the king,' '' he says. ''Now law becomes, 'Listen to what my judges have to say.' '' A vivid and fluid storyteller, Mr. Schama doesn't shy away from grand statements that set the tone for an era, but he also seeks out the nuances that humanize battles for boundaries, wealth, power and a nation's soul. (He can even talk about ideas like a nation's soul without seeming sentimental or silly.)</p>
        <p>He reminds us that catastrophe and renewal have always gone hand in hand. So the plague that destroyed half of England's population in the 14th century, during which ''fathers and mothers recoiled from contact with their children,'' also ended serfdom, because mass death had created a huge labor shortage. This giant survey course begins in 3100 B.C. and ends at the beginning of the 17th century, with 10 more hours covering subsequent history now under production. There's also a two-volume companion text. It all may sound daunting, but even nonhistorians may already have some grounding from museum visits, Shakespeare and movies.</p>
        <p>Certainly it's easier to make some epochs seem more immediate than others. In tomorrow's ''Dynasty'' episode, Mr. Schama focuses on the melodramatic friendship between Henry II and Thomas a Becket, his friend and chancellor (whose brains Henry's knights would spread across the floor of Canterbury Cathedral). Through this story of violence and betrayal, the professor manages to evoke the evolution of the legal system, the continuing struggle between the church and the crown, and -- following Richard the Lion-Hearted's succession to the throne -- a massacre of Jews recorded as a ''holocaust.''</p>
        <p>In the fourth hour Mr. Schama follows the emergence of Scotland, Wales and Ireland, whose nationalistic urges ran counter to the English monarchy's desire to pound them into submission. Here he also describes two gruesome killings: the disembowelment of the Scottish leader William Wallace, and Edward II's death by hot iron.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schama knows what sells. Tonight's two hours cover more obscure clashes of Saxons, Romans and Vikings and continues through the Battle of Hastings and its aftermath. He uses the Bayeux Tapestry (which he calls ''Norman propaganda''), a piece of epic embroidery, as a guide to the showdown between William and the Viking Harald Hardrada. Focusing on the tapestry's image of a mother and child fleeing, Mr. Schama observes that this kind of image would be echoed in Rubens, Goya and Picasso's ''Guernica,'' as reminders of the innocents who die in war.</p>
        <p>He shows us the difference between intimate Saxon buildings and grand Normal cathedrals, to illustrate how architecture can mirror ambition. Even in this more remote and difficult terrain, Mr. Schama makes shrewd and fascinating connections between the personal and political, between art and history, emotionalism and economics. Sometimes doing your homework and watching television at the same time can work out just fine.</p>

        <p>TELEVISION REVIEW  Correction:  November 1, 2000, Wednesday  A television review on Monday about ''A History of Britain,'' a series this week on the History Channel, misidentified the opponent of William, Duke of Normandy, depicted in the Bayeux Tapestry, which shows the Battle of Hastings and is used as a visual aid in the program. His opponent was the English king Harold II, not the Viking Harald Hardrada (an invader whom Harold II had defeated).</p>
