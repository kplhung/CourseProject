        <p>The moderate Kosovo Albanian leader, Ibrahim Rugova, claimed victory for his party today in Kosovo's first postwar elections, saying that unofficial results from the election on Saturday showed that the party had won more than 60 percent of the vote in municipalities across the province.</p>
        <p>The more militant parties, formed by members of the armed rebel force, the Kosovo Liberation Army, appeared to have fared poorly except in a few areas. If the results hold, it is a sign that Kosovo Albanians have opted for peace and stability and largely rejected the thuggery of some of the people who assumed power after the war last year.</p>
        <p>Votes were still being counted through the day, and official results were not expected until Monday. But political parties and independent monitoring groups disclosed their calculations. The results from an independent monitoring group, as well as from Mr. Rugova's party, the Democratic League of Kosovo, indicated that the party had won broadly, in particular in all the major towns.</p>
        <p>''Based on preliminary results,'' he said at a news conference in Pristina, the province's capital, his party won ''60 percent of the vote throughout Kosovo.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rugova declared his determination to lead Kosovo to independence, but also said his party would protect minorities in Kosovo, a reference to the Serbian population, as well as to Gypsies and Muslim Slavs, who have been subject to attacks and killings in the last year, since NATO-led peacekeeping troops maintained control of the province.</p>
        <p>Kosovo remains a province of Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia. Albanians have long made up the preponderance of Kosovo residents, and they had a substantial degree of autonomy in the Communist era. That was withdrawn in 1989 after Slobodan Milosevic became the Serbian leader, and by the late 1990's the Albanians mounted an armed rebellion for independence. After Mr. Milosevic failed to halt what the West called horrific atrocities by his security forces, NATO bombed Yugoslavia for 78 days until Mr. Milosevic agreed to withdraw his troops. Since then, the United Nations has been trying to re-establish civilian government.</p>
        <p>The small remaining population of Serbs in Kosovo overwhelmingly boycotted the elections. Today they said the vote was illegal because only the Albanians voted.</p>
        <p>Vojislav Kostunica, who took Mr. Milosevic's place as Yugoslav president earlier this month, issued a statement today saying that ''Yugoslavia cannot recognize the results of local elections.'' According to Agence France-Presse, he urged international bodies to carry out the United Nations Security Council resolution that governs the foreign presence in the province, and foresees that Kosovo's future will be determined in talks between provincial leaders and Belgrade.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rugova's party said its calculations showed that it won 60 to 70 percent of the vote in all of Kosovo's main towns, including Pristina, and it called for parliamentary and presidential elections to be held next June.</p>
        <p>An independent monitoring group, the Kosovo Action for Civic Initiative, released similar figures, showing an overall victory for the Democratic League of Kosovo.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rugova's party acknowledged losing several areas in central Kosovo to its main rival, the Democratic Party of Kosovo, led by Hashim Thaci, a former leader of the Kosovo Liberation Army.</p>
        <p>Mr. Thaci has played a prominent role in Kosovo, and his supporters and associates acquired influential positions of power after Serbian forces withdrew in June last year. But voters appear to have rejected the roughness and criminality associated with the former guerrilla fighters.</p>
        <p>Mr. Thaci declined to talk to reporters today. He emerged only briefly from a meeting in his offices dressed in casual clothes and looking pensive. The mood of supporters at his party headquarters in Pristina today was subdued.</p>
