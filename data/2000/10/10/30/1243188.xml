        <p>Procter &amp; Gamble is expected to announce today that it helped orchestrate the merger of two minority-owned companies from which it buys supplies and awarded a $100 million contract to them for going through with the deal.</p>
        <p>In recent years, many corporations have stepped up their purchasing from minority-owned suppliers, convinced that the investment will reap financial rewards as the racial demographics of the country change.

        <p>Procter &amp; Gamble is expected to announce today that it helped orchestrate the merger of two minority-owned companies from which it buys supplies and awarded a $100 million contract to them for going through with the deal.</p>
        <p>In recent years, many corporations have stepped up their purchasing from minority-owned suppliers, convinced that the investment will reap financial rewards as the racial demographics of the country change. By 2050, blacks, Hispanics, Asians and American Indians will make up nearly 48 percent of the nation's population, compared with about 24 percent in 1990, prompting many companies to strike deals in minority communities in hopes of garnering loyalty from an increasingly important segment of consumers.</p>
        <p>The number of contracts has been limited, however, by the comparatively small size of many minority-owned companies. Grappling with mediocre growth rates and sluggish sales, consumer products giants like Procter &amp; Gamble are under pressure to cut costs by working with large suppliers that cover vast territories and charge lower prices.</p>
        <p>In response, corporations have been urging small businesses to consolidate and expand for years, but rarely have they played such a pivotal role as in the pending merger between Film Fabricators Inc. of Atlanta and the Johnson-Bryce Corporation of Memphis, two packaging companies with black owners. Not only did Procter &amp; Gamble bring both companies together, assuring them a three-year $100 million contract to wrap Pampers diapers if they merged, but it also promised to link them with other corporate customers.</p>
        <p>''With consumer products companies getting larger and competing on a global basis, the concern was that we would not be able to play a major role on our own,'' said Woodrow A. Hall, the chairman and chief executive of Film Fabricators, who will be chairman and chief executive of the combined company. ''Now, we will be able to compete with anybody, anywhere.''</p>
        <p>Procter officials said they were confident that the deal, and others like it, would increase the company's revenue, citing a 1999 study by Yankelovich Partners, a market research firm, that shows that 87 percent of blacks were more likely to buy from companies that ''give back'' to their community, either through charitable contributions or business ventures.</p>
        <p>''In the 1970's and 80's, companies like ours did this to be viewed as good corporate citizens,'' said Howard D. Elliott, a marketing and business development director at Procter, where contracting with minority-owned suppliers has increased to $548 million this year from $85 million in 1989. ''Now it's a business imperative.''</p>
