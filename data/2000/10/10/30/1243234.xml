        <p>As Donovan McNabb made the walk through the tunnel from the locker room to the interview room at Giants Stadium today, well-wishers passed by, offering mumbled greetings and prodding him to keep his head up. But he needed more than kind words.</p>
        <p>The learning curve for McNabb, the young Philadelphia Eagles quarterback, has been steady and quick. But today, he received a harsh indoctrination into the conditions of Giants Stadium, with winds and snow flurries conspiring with an inspired Giants defense to make him appear to be the inexperienced young quarterback that he really is.</p>
        <p>His strong arm and quick feet have confounded defenses this season, his first as the Eagles' starter. But with the snow swirling as the wind whistled, McNabb struggled through a nightmarish performance and the Giants dominated the Eagles, 24-7.</p>
        <p>McNabb completed 10 of 31 passes for just 129 yards with a touchdown and an interception, and he was not good when it counted. Before he added two long passes and a touchdown after the score was 24-0, McNabb had found his receivers on just 8 of 26 tries for 78 yards.</p>
        <p>Making matters worse for McNabb were the receivers who struggled as badly as he did, dropping nine passes by the count of Eagles Coach Andy Reid.</p>
        <p>''I don't make any excuses,'' McNabb said. ''It's a little windy, a little snowy, but I have plays that are supposed to be made. I didn't make them. That's something that you just can't do in this offense and definitely not in the National Football League. You learn from it and you move forward.''</p>
        <p>McNabb had done that already, moving forward after struggling against the Giants in a one-sided defeat in the second week of the season. In his five games before today's, McNabb had completed 63.1 percent of his attempts, converting 113 of 179 for 1,152 yards and 8 touchdowns. Even in the 33-18 loss to the Giants that preceded the run of success, McNabb managed to complete 19 of 33 for 214 yards and a touchdown without an interception. He also ran for 45 yards and a touchdown on 5 carries.</p>
        <p>''I didn't think it was Donovan's best game, and it surely was not our receivers' best game,'' Reid said. ''I thought we were over the nine-drop games, but that's what we had today. I thought he was off, throwing behind receivers in some cases. Other times, they were dropped. I thought we were over it. Weather, wind, those are all excuses. I've seen them do it in adverse conditions all through camp. We've got to focus in and get it done.''</p>
        <p>In the early-season meeting, the Giants were able to focus on running back Duce Staley and shut down the Eagles' running attack. With Staley out for the season with a broken foot, it was McNabb who was the target, and again the Giants were able to take away the Eagles' most dangerous weapon.</p>
        <p>McNabb ran the ball 3 times for 42 yards, but most times openings disappeared as quickly as they appeared and he was sacked 4 times. And his efforts to establish short timing routes were confounded as the Giants disrupted them with pressure.</p>
        <p>''I just didn't get in a rhythm,'' McNabb said. ''The confidence level was already there and that's not going to drop. I couldn't get into a rhythm and when you can't get a rhythm, being a quarterback in this league, things are going to go bad.</p>
        <p>''I thought we were one play away from changing things around. That's what you need in this league -- one big play and you get things rolling, your confidence begins to get high and you're back on the ball again. ''</p>
        <p>McNabb's rhythm never came with the Eagles limited to a procession of three-and-out series. The Giants had a big advantage in time of possession, 43 minutes 41 seconds to 16:19. On 7 of the Eagles' 12 possessions, they went out without a first down; they accumulated only eight first downs in the entire game.</p>
        <p>''I'm very critical of myself,'' McNabb said. ''I'll learn from it. I think we'll come out after practice next week and the team will see I'm ready to move on and that will lift everyone. During the course of the game, all the way to the end of the fourth quarter, opportunities were there to be taken advantage of and we just didn't do it. It's something that I can look at and definitely learn from.''  PRO FOOTBALL</p>
