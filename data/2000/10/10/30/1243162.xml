        <p>GAME 5</p>
        <p>In the end, the Mets were not the Subway Series' Little Engine That Could. They couldn't because the Yankees were the Super Chiefs. Each game of the five-game series was thisclose, but the numbers were really misleading. The Mets didn't have a chance. They were playing against a team whose players responded to moves their manager made. If everything that King Midas touched turned to gold, just about every move Joe Torre made turned into a victory.</p>
