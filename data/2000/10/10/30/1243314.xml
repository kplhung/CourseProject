        <p>KUBY-Milton. Chief of Human Factors, Life Sciences and Space Environment, retired, at Fairchild Hiller Corporation, he was a pioneer in the field of aeronautical human safety engineering. His varied career accomplishments include designing a bauxite processing factory in Jamaica, West Indies, that produced significant economic benefits for the local community. In addition, he designed advanced cockpit technology for U.S. defense aircraft and, at a later time, led the biomedical engineering team that developed the lifesupport system for Apollo astronauts. After a long, courageouslyfought illness, he died on October 26, 2000, at age 81. He will be remembered for his love of family, generosity of spirit, endless intellectual curiosity, and passion for learning. Beloved husband of Selma and brother of Natalie Naishuler; adored father of Stevan (deceased), Stuart, Beth, and Laurel; devoted grandfather of Eric, Daniel, David, Kimberly, Tina, Evan, and Brian; inspiring father-in-law of Charles Levinthal and Paul Sclafani.</p>
