        <p>Italians are known for their sense of style, so it is perhaps fitting that the campaign for 2001 parliamentary elections, which will determine whether Italy stays center-left or veers center-right, is fixated on looks. Italians will choose between two candidates for prime minister who could easily pass for rivals on ''The Dating Game.''</p>
        <p>Silvio Berlusconi, a media tycoon and leader of Forza Italia, the leading center-right party, is a perennially tanned former cruise-ship crooner who, at 64, retains the glossy good looks and Continental charm of a Rossano Brazzi. Mr. Berlusconi is also one of the richest men in Italy.</p>
        <p>Francesco Rutelli, the 46-year-old mayor of Rome, brings a dash of Paul Newman glamour to Italian politics. The monthly Catholic magazine Famiglia Cristiana is not known for swooning celebrity interviews, but even its editors could not resist informing readers that the mayor's face ''would not look out of place among the busts of Roman emperors in the Capitoline museums.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rutelli's looks have already become an issue in a campaign that has barely started. When Prime Minister Giuliano Amato, 62, decided last month to bow out in favor of the younger, more popular Mr. Rutelli, Mr. Berlusconi scoffed that his new rival was just a pretty face.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Berlusconi does not underestimate the power of a taut jaw line. He has already flooded Italy with billboards featuring gauzy portraits of himself taken at a younger, more slender time.</p>
        <p>Each candidate claims to be the face of a new Italy, a modern democracy shaking itself loose from lingering economic rigidity, red tape and corruption to meet the challenges of a global economy.</p>
        <p>In American terms, Mr. Berlusconi is like a Republican, campaigning on a platform of lower taxes, less government regulation and more free-market reform.</p>
        <p>When he became prime minister in 1994, for eight months, Mr. Berlusconi won by campaigning as a self-made businessman who could rise above the morass of political cronyism and corruption that had caused the Socialists and Christian Democrats to collapse during the Tangentopoli (Bribesville) investigations of the early 1990's.</p>
        <p>Mr. Berlusconi is popular with Italians, many of whom do not seem to hold him accountable for his string of convictions for bribery and accounting irregularities. Most of his convictions were reversed on appeal, or the statute of limitations ran out before the legal processes were completed, but he still faces trials on charges of falsifying accounts and bribing a judge.</p>
        <p>He has turned over management of his companies to his children and recently said that if elected he would put his assets in a blind trust. But he is lobbying fiercely to rescind a law, sponsored by the center-left, imposing equal-access rules for candidates on television and radio, which would restrict his ability to use his own networks to promote his candidacy. The synergy of his business and political interests risks lending his carefully honed image a taint of old-style politics as usual.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rutelli, who was anointed in a balloon-filled political convention this month before embarking on a ''listening tour'' of Italy that included preparing a Caprese salad on a cooking show on the Italian version of MTV, faces an oddly similar problem. (That tape may never be aired, however, because the producers belatedly realized that the new law on equal access would oblige them to invite many other chef-politicians who are far less appetizing to their youthful viewers). The media-savvy mayor has already sought the advice of Jeremy Rosner and Tal Silberstein, political consultants who work with Stan Greenberg, Al Gore's pollster.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rutelli wants to project himself as a ''third way'' centrist along the lines of Bill Clinton and Tony Blair. But he relies on a fractured and fractious center-left coalition whose inability to get along also recalls the revolving-door governments of old.</p>
        <p>At least one centrist is threatening to run as a third-party candidate, which could further divide the splintered center-left.</p>
        <p>Mr. Berlusconi's coalition has cracks of its own. He owes much of his electoral strength in the north to the Northern League, a separatist-leaning party led by Umberto Bossi. It was Mr. Bossi who caused Mr. Berlusconi's government to collapse in 1994 by withdrawing his support.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bossi's recent statements on immigration and race are an embarrassment to his partners. He made headlines this fall when he said the next prime minister should prove he has ''a legitimate family with legitimate children,'' apparently a somewhat bizarre attack on Mr. Rutelli, who has adopted an Ecuadorean child.</p>
        <p>The Roman Catholic Church still has political influence in Italy, and both candidates have been courting Catholic voters.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rutelli, who began his career in the Radical Party, advocating separation of church and state and the right to divorce and abortion, has rediscovered his Catholic roots.</p>
        <p>Two years ago, he helped to found the Democrats, a moderate faction on the left. In 1995 he remarried his wife -- whom he had wed in a civil ceremony in 1982 -- in the Catholic Church. Rome's deft management of this year's Jubilee 2000, a Holy Year of the Roman Catholic Church, won him international praise.</p>
        <p>But the mayor suffered a setback in July during the World Pride Roma 2000 festival, when he first embraced a gay-pride parade through Rome, then distanced himself from it after the Vatican complained. Conservatives in the Vatican were not appeased, and his liberal constituency complained that he had caved in to the church.</p>
        <p>The economy, however, is more likely to determine who wins the election. The tax rate in Italy's top bracket is close to 46 percent, among the highest in Europe, while the bloated pension system is in dire need of reform. Unemployment is at 10 percent, and reaches 20 percent in some southern regions.</p>
