        <p>Talks between the Philadelphia teachers' union and the school district continued late tonight without a settlement as the city prepared for a shutdown of its public schools on Monday.</p>
        <p>After months of failed negotiations, the 21,000-member union, which is fighting demands for contract concessions, voted on Friday to go on strike.</p>
        <p>''This has to be a reform contract that works for the children of this city,'' said Mayor John F. Street ''and we don't seem to be able to get there.''</p>
        <p>Shortly before 11 tonight, Jerry Jordan, the chief negotiator for the teachers' union said, ''Absolutely no progress has been made.''</p>
        <p>One point of contention is whether the teachers' work day will be extended by 45 minutes, as the city has proposed, or by a half-hour, the union's position. Philadelphia teachers' work day is now six hours and 34 minutes, one of the shortest in Pennsylvania. The city had originally wanted to extend the day by an hour.</p>
        <p>The union, the Philadelphia Federation of Teachers, called the strike despite the threat of a possible state takeover of the city's school system, which would allow state officials to order the teachers back to work or face the loss of their teaching certificates and pensions. The takeover would be made possible under a new state law, Act 46, designed to shake up the balance of power of contract bargaining in the troubled 210,000-student system. The union is challenging the state law in court.</p>
        <p>The takeover would involve the cooperation of Mayor Street, a Democrat, who appoints the school board and has been participating in the negotiations, and Gov. Tom Ridge, a Republican.</p>
        <p>''The mayor said on Friday that if there is a strike, the P.F.T. could expect we'd be having conversations with the governor about a friendly takeover as early as tomorrow,'' said David L. Cohen, an adviser to the mayor and a strategist on the school negotiations.</p>
        <p>Governor Ridge has said he would be willing to order a takeover if the mayor requested it.</p>
        <p>Ted Kirsch, the president of the union, said tonight: ''We're about addressing smaller class sizes, safety and discipline. What the mayor is about is command and total control of his employees.''</p>
        <p>The mayor has offered a $314 million pay and benefits package, which would include a $1,000 bonus for every teacher this year and a 14 percent pay increase over the next three years, Mr. Cohen said.</p>
        <p>Mayor Street, who was elected last year, has made improvement of the city's schools a priority and has said the city needs more flexibility in managing the school system. He has sought the introduction of pay-for-performance compensation for teachers.</p>
        <p>The schools are facing an $80 million deficit. Last year only 54 percent of fourth graders scored at or above basic state testing levels in all subjects, Mr. Cohen said. The graduation rate for seniors was 72 percent in 1998. There are an average of 30 to 33 students in every class. The students are mostly from low-income families, with free breakfast and lunch provided for more than 71 percent of them, Mr. Cohen said.</p>
        <p>The last teachers' strike in Philadelphia was 19 years ago. That strike, which lasted 50 days, further shook confidence in the school system and prompted many middle class families to move to the suburbs. Teachers gained little from the 1981 strike.</p>
