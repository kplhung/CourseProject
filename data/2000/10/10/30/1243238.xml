        <p>Will ''Zombie College'' be as funny now that Scott, the protagonist, has joined the ranks of the living dead? Harper Langston is just not sure. But he is among 2,000 fans to leave an e-mail address at Icebox.com, which shows this animated series, to ensure that they are notified of the next ''webisode.''</p>
        <p>''Everyone here thought it was really funny,'' said Mr. Langston, 25, who recently discovered the show while eating lunch in front of his computer at work. ''They should have T-shirts or mugs or something.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Langston is part of a small but increasing audience tuning in to the Internet for short bursts of entertainment. Web viewers can watch the seven installments of ''Zombie College'' at any time, in any order, or the latest ''Queer Duck,'' which made its debut on Icebox this month with the catchy theme song: ''Queer Duck, he's intellectual. Queer Duck, he's homosexual.''</p>
        <p>After years of sputtering attempts to prove itself as a medium for mass entertainment, the Internet is morphing into a more offbeat version of television that is often more profane and always less formulaic than its broadcast and cable counterparts. And just as millions of people now get information and buy products from previously unheard of sources on the Internet, some -- including a few television producers -- have begun to turn to it for entertainment produced outside the traditional entertainment industry.</p>
        <p>''The ideas on the Internet are coming from different places, and there's less restriction on creativity,'' said Steve Gordon, vice president for creative affairs at Viacom Productions. ''Some of it you'd have to tone down for TV. But we think the Web is a very rich place to look.''</p>
        <p>A few Internet properties have been optioned for television and film, but entertainment executives have been slow to embrace material that is often produced by unknowns, whose content may be inappropriate by mainstream standards and whose fan base is still tiny by a television yardstick.</p>
        <p>''There's a lot of interesting stuff out there, but we haven't yet seen the Internet's 'I Love Lucy,' '' Larry Shapiro, a new-media agent at the Creative Artists Agency, said during a recent digital entertainment conference in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>''It's not that easy to get a TV show,'' he said. ''We have a lot of clients with scripts who have been in this business a long time. Sometimes they get a pilot. Sometimes that pilot gets sold. And sometimes it actually makes it to TV.''</p>
        <p>But, encouraged by the growing number of homes and offices with broadband Internet connections, artists have flooded the Internet with animated shows and videos that have no other outlet. Those fashioning material for the Web often compare themselves to the Fox network in its early days, when it pushed the limits of broadcast television with shows like ''The Simpsons.''</p>
        <p>With new digital tools, like Flash animation software, and shorter formats, Web features can be produced quickly and for as little as one-tenth the cost of a typical television show. And some have begun to attract small but significant audiences.</p>
        <p>Most of the sites that sponsor Web shows like ''Zombie College'' -- which chronicles the adventures of a student who turns down the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to follow his girlfriend to a campus where students eat one another's brains -- attract fewer than a million different visitors a month.</p>
        <p>That is a far cry from the 25 million viewers who watched the recent season premiere of ''The West Wing'' or the 50 million or so each month who visit Yahoo, the popular information portal that is the most popular site on the Internet.</p>
        <p>Still, the producers of Web entertainment argue that the extent of the following they have won in so short a time demonstrates the existence of a market for entertainment beyond what is showing on television or in the local multiplex.</p>
        <p>Heavy.com reports that about 40,000 viewers a day come to its site to see shows like its weekly spoofs of ''Behind the Music,'' VH1's trademark celebrity profile show.</p>
        <p>Fan mail for ''Radiskull and Devil Doll'' on Shockwave.com last summer prompted the site to begin merchandising, and more than 1,000 orders for 10-inch Devil Dolls at $11.95 each have been placed since Sept. 26, said a Shockwave representative.</p>
        <p>''It's weird,'' said Joe Sparks, creator of ''Radiskull,'' who said he was developing Web photo albums before he began dabbling with a singing skull, a dancing devil and a computer animation program called Flash. ''Now I make cartoons. I hang out and talk about these dolls and how to make the head a little better.''</p>
        <p>Flash, developed by the software concern Macromedia, is largely responsible for the flourishing entertainment on the Web. Animation is the favored Internet format because unlike video it is easy to shrink to a size that can be delivered quickly without sacrificing visual quality. The Flash program makes animation files even smaller by using geometric descriptions of shapes in motion to determine what is displayed, rather than a series of stills playing in rapid succession. That translates into less waiting time between clicking and watching.</p>
        <p>Recent versions of Flash have also become increasingly easy to use, allowing artists to compose animations on the computer that go directly to the Web.</p>
        <p>''In the past there was no way a guy like me was going to make it to a mass audience,'' said Joe Shields, a cartoonist from Grand Rapids, Mich., whose ''Joe Cartoon'' series is on Shockwave.com, which is a Macromedia spinoff created to showcase Flash. Mr. Shields, whose infamous ''Frog in a Blender'' allows viewers to click on any speed button they choose and watch the results, said he quit his job drawing cartoons for a T-shirt company and now makes a living licensing cartoons to other Web sites and attracting advertisers to his own site, www.joecartoon.com.</p>
        <p>But he is the exception, for now. Most companies and independent artists producing material solely for the Web lose money because unless an Internet show lands a television or film deal, it is almost entirely dependent on selling advertising to make money. Advertisers, who are not spending much on the Web anyway, have not been rushing to sponsor sites whose audiences are small and whose subject matter may not always be palatable.</p>
        <p>''If I had to answer to shareholders, I wouldn't be doing this,'' said Josh Kimberg, chief executive of Bullseye Art, a New York-based Web development concern whose income from corporate clients subsidizes its production of cartoons like ''Space Dog,'' about a dog who fights crime.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kimberg said he had hoped Bullseye could license its cartoons to sites that had set out to showcase Internet entertainment. But the recent retreat by several such companies has led him to believe that an Internet property needs television sponsorship to succeed, he said.</p>
        <p>Last month Shockwave, which paid large sums to celebrities like the directors Tim Burton and David Lynch to produce shows for its site, said it was shifting direction to focus on interactive games. A Web entertainment start-up, Pop.com, that was backed by a group of Hollywood moguls including Steven Spielberg and Ron Howard shut down.</p>
        <p>Still, new revenue models may be emerging. AtomFilms, a Seattle-based Web site showcasing short films and original Internet properties, recently landed a sponsorship with Volkswagen AG, which seeks to lure customers to its site with entertainment supplied by Atom.</p>
        <p>And for many artists the ability to experiment and the opportunity to short-circuit the Hollywood hierarchy seem to trump the low level of compensation.</p>
        <p>''I chose to develop 'Zombie College' for the Web because I could,'' said Eric Kaplan, one of 12 writers for the Fox television show ''Futurama.'' He said he was being paid for his zombie show with stock options in Icebox. ''I was given complete creative control over a project at a stage in my career where I would never have been given complete creative control over a TV show.''</p>
        <p>The properties now playing on the Internet range wildly in quality and subject. Most come in three-to-five minute jolts of animated comedy, ideal for people taking breaks at work. They have titles like ''Miss Muffy and the Muff Mob'' (www.bullseyeart.com), featuring five animated girls with large muffin heads who bake, rap and spew profanity.</p>
        <p>Most offer at least some rudimentary form of interactivity, to keep the viewer's attention during the minute or so it takes to download them. Some Internet users must download free software media players to enable them to view certain shows.</p>
        <p>Much of the fare is aimed at male college students. But there is also Web programming for children, like ''Herschel Hopper, New York Rabbit,'' a 38-minute Flash feature at Rumpus.com. And ''Kozik's Inferno,'' a rendition of Dante's poem produced by Wildbrain.com with the artist Frank Kozik, may be suitable for all ages.</p>
        <p>It is no surprise that Web entertainment has more profanity and nudity than is standard on broadcast television or daytime cable. ''D-Life,'' on Heavy.com, for instance, is a sort of uncensored version of MTV's ''Real World.''</p>
        <p>This fall Fox is planning to introduce toohotforfox.com, featuring reality shows including a version of ''When Good Pets Go Bad,'' which was cut from its broadcast schedule for reasons of taste. Shockwave said it was waiting to install an age-verification system before starting the shows created for the site by Matt Stone and Trey Parker, the creators of ''South Park.''</p>
        <p>''We found this year that there are people doing stuff specifically for the Web, and yet it's very compelling entertainment,'' said Jonathan Wells, director of the ResFest Film Festival, which is touring the nation as part of a program devoted to material made for the Internet. ''It opens up new types of stories that just weren't out there before.''</p>
        <p>If traditional entertainment executives are not scooping up these properties en masse, they seem to be at least paying attention.</p>
        <p>Two animations developed for the Web have been optioned for films, ''L'il Pimp'' (www.mediatrip.com), by the Revolution Studio, led by Joe Roth, and ''Undercover Brother'' (www.urbanentertainment.com), by John Ridley, a writer for the NBC show ''Third Watch'' who also did the screenplay for ''Three Kings.''</p>
        <p>Showtime plans to turn ''Starship Regulars,'' an Icebox series, into a half-hour television show.</p>
        <p>One licensing deal can pay for a lot of digital production. Simon Assad, chief executive of Heavy.com, said the revenue from producing one weekly television show would cover the $250,000 Heavy spends each month to produce eight hours of original programming.</p>
        <p>''It's not really about whether the economics are there or not,'' said Mr. Assad, whose company is negotiating with a cable company for just such a deal. ''It's about whether you have something good enough that people will want to watch it.''</p>
