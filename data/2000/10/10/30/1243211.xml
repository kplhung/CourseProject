        <p>Coach Al Groh of the Jets expressed concern about the play of his safeties last week, and today he made a change in his lineup by giving Scott Frost, a former quarterback, his first start at safety after a three-year conversion process.</p>
        <p>Frost took over for Kevin Williams, who had won the job after a three-way competition in training camp. But Williams struggled in the regular season and was dropped to third in the rotation today, behind Chris Hayes.</p>
        <p>The switch did not solve the Jets' problems in the secondary. Frost and Marcus Coleman were defending Bills receiver Eric Moulds when he split them and caught a 52-yard pass down the left side. Coleman said both he and Frost were at fault. That led to a field goal that put the Bills ahead by 20-17 in the fourth quarter.</p>
        <p>When asked if the sun was a factor in the reception because Moulds went from shade to sun on the play, Coleman said, ''If a tornado dropped down on the 50-yard line, you've got to make the play.''</p>
        <p>Groh said: ''I said before the start of the game that we need to get better play from the safety position. We continue to search for that.''</p>
        <p>Coleman had primary responsibility for Moulds, who caught 6 passes for 137 yards.</p>
        <p>''I thought it was even for the whole game,'' Coleman said of his matchup with Moulds. ''Until he got the big one at the end.''</p>
        <p>A Rare Martin Miscue</p>
        <p>Running back Curtis Martin's fumble in the fourth quarter was his second of the season. Before the first one, he had had more than 500 touches (rushes and receptions) without a fumble since the 1998 playoffs.</p>
        <p>Bills Back in Contention</p>
        <p>The Bills are 4-4 and salvaged a shot at the playoffs. Had the Bills fallen to 3-5, they would most likely have been out of contention in the division. ''This was a big win for us,'' quarterback Doug Flutie said. ''Every week is like that.''</p>
        <p>Becht and Abraham Still Out</p>
        <p>Tight end Anthony Becht (sprained knee) and linebacker John Abraham (abdominal pull) were inactive for the second game in a row, and doubt remains about when either will return. Becht's injury is similar to the one that kept Bills tight end Jay Riemersma out for five weeks. Riemersma returned today. Abraham and Becht were injured Oct. 15 against New England. Right guard Randy Thomas (ankle), who was listed as doubtful all week, started.</p>
