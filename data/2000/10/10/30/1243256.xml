        <p>THIS fall has been good to the Jets.</p>
        <p>They played hard, and executed a solid game plan that exploited their strengths and hid their flaws. Under their first-year coach, Al Groh, the Jets won six of their first seven games.</p>
        <p>They became masters of the comeback victory. The Jets trailed Green Bay, 16-13, in the fourth quarter and won, 20-16. They trailed New England, 19-7, in the fourth quarter and won 20-19. They trailed Tampa Bay, 17-6, in the third quarter and won, 21-17. Last Monday, the Jets trailed Miami, 30-7, in the third quarter and wound up winning, 40-37, in overtime.</p>
        <p>Yesterday the Jets fell behind a desperate Bills team but, after tying the score, ran out of comebacks.</p>
        <p>Was this a blip or an omen?</p>
        <p>As the Jets approach the heart of their season -- a home game against Denver, two games with Indianapolis, a rematch at Miami and a game at Oakland over the next six weeks -- Groh has a decision to make.</p>
        <p>The Jets' flaws are apparent; it's only a matter of time before teams with enough experience to exploit the weaknesses actually will.</p>
        <p>The Jets are getting diminished production from the wide receivers. Their leading receivers are running backs. Wayne Chrebet has 33 catches for the season; Dedric Ward has 22.</p>
        <p>In the their first seven games, the Jets got by on a passing game consisting of short shots to running backs and possession passes to wide receivers. On Sunday, Chrebet had 6 receptions for 69 yards, Curtis Martin 6 for 31 yards, Richie Anderson 6 for 24 yards.</p>
        <p>So Laveranues Coles's numbers jump out at you; the 22-year-old rookie had 5 receptions for 131 yards. Ward's numbers jump out, too; the fourth-year veteran had 3 receptions for 25 yards.</p>
        <p>Coles will soon be forcing Groh to make a decision. Start Coles and bring Ward off the bench in his old third-receiver role, or maintain the status quo.</p>
        <p>Groh confined his comments and compliments about Coles to yesterday's game.</p>
        <p>''He did a nice job for us today,'' Groh said, adding cryptically, ''Hopefully, this is a little window for the future.''</p>
        <p>Which future? The immediate future with Broncos, Colts and Raiders in it, or the long-term future of a new season?</p>
        <p>At the very least, Coles has gone from the periphery to the center of Vinny Testaverde's radar.</p>
        <p>After the game, Coles talked about how gratified he was that Testaverde had pulled him aside and told him what he wanted from him.</p>
        <p>''Just told me he wanted me in the defense's face, where wanted me to run routes,'' Coles said. ''Just the idea he's looking at me makes me feel good; makes me not want him to lose confidence in me. When your quarterback puts that kind of trust in you, you don't want to let him down.''</p>
        <p>For a crucial fourth-quarter stretch, the rookie was Testaverde's go-to receiver. First, Testaverde hit Coles for a 19-yard gain. On first-and-10 at the Jets' 45, Testaverde hit Coles for a 21-yard gain. Then on third-and-12, Testaverde hit Coles for 14 yards. Four plays later, the Jets kicked a 36-yard field goal to tie the score, 20-20.</p>
        <p>''He was on the periphery of our game plan,'' said Bills safety Henry Jones, who intercepted a pass intended for Chrebet.</p>
        <p>Jones added: ''They weren't really going to him at first; then he started getting open. He looked good on film. He's got speed, good quickness, he's a good runner after he catches the ball. He's someone to contend with. He's special.''</p>
        <p>Now, after quietly making his presence known, opposing defenses are beginning to look at Coles. A national audience will, too.</p>
        <p>Coles wishes his past would go away, but it won't. As his stature grows, his story becomes more compelling.</p>
        <p>Briefly, Coles and his Florida State teammate Peter Warrick were arrested last year after they purchased clothes at a Dillard's department store and were charged only a fraction of the price by a saleswoman who had undercharged Warrick several times before. Warrick was suspended for one game and Coles was thrown off the team because he had violated school probation for a variety of other legal and academic problems.</p>
        <p>Warrick was a first-round pick last April, while Coles, who had been projected as a first-round pick, was drafted in the third round. He could be the greatest bargain in the draft.</p>
        <p>The Jets and Groh, who said Coles was ''hungry for another chance,'' gave him a second opportunity. Coles is making the most of it.</p>
        <p>Warrick has 21 catches for 255 yards and 2 touchdowns with Cincinnati; Coles has 18 receptions for 291 yards and a touchdown. Last Monday, Coles scored his first National Football League touchdown when he snatched a pass away from the veteran Sam Madison in the end zone on a 30-yard play. Yesterday against Buffalo, he raced behind the defense for a 63-yard reception.</p>
        <p>The good news for Coles is that he has gotten Testaverde's attention; the challenging news is that Coles has gotten the defense's attention, too.</p>
        <p>''We didn't really have a game plan for him coming into the game,'' said Ted Cottrell, the Bills' defensive coordinator. ''We didn't really know a lot about him. We know about him now.''</p>
        <p>Groh knows, too, and soon he'll have a decision to make.</p>
