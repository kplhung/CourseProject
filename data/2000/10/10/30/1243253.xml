        <p>Hillary Rodham Clinton said today that she respected Islam and did not intend to offend Muslim Americans when her campaign decided last week to return political contributions from members of a Muslim American organization.</p>
        <p>''I think every American deserves to be part of our political process,''  she said. ''I have no difficulty with that at all.''</p>

        <p>Hillary Rodham Clinton said today that she respected Islam and did not intend to offend Muslim Americans when her campaign decided last week to return political contributions from members of a Muslim American organization.</p>
        <p>''I think every American deserves to be part of our political process,''  she said. ''I have no difficulty with that at all.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton, speaking to reporters aboard her campaign bus on Interstate 90 between Cheektowaga and here, said it had been difficult at times navigating the ethnic politics of her newly adopted state. Mrs. Clinton's decision to return $50,000 in contributions from members of the American Muslim Alliance has been interpreted by many Muslim Americans as pandering to the state's influential Jewish voters, a perception Mrs. Clinton and many prominent Jewish supporters have disputed.</p>
        <p>''It has been intense and occasionally it has presented me with a learning curve that I have had to master or at least attempt to,'' Mrs. Clinton said when asked about the ethnic mix of New York. ''But that is part of New York politics. New York is the most diverse place in our country, probably the entire world. So one would expect to find all of the diverse points of view and experiences that people bring from their cultural, and religious, and racial and tribal backgrounds at work in the political mix here in New York.''</p>
        <p>Reflecting publicly for the first time about the past week's unusual infusion of Muslim American issues into a New York Senate race, Mrs. Clinton also said that she was concerned about Arab-Americans' being detained on evidence that the United States government refuses to disclose. She said, however, that she had not yet studied the so-called secret evidence cases against Arab-Americans, and therefore, unlike her position in the case of Jonathan J. Pollard, a Jewish American convicted of spying for Israel, she could not support those demanding the evidence be made public.</p>
        <p>''I haven't had the time to focus on any other case besides that one,'' she said, referring to Mr. Pollard's imprisonment. ''But I intend to look into that after the election.''</p>
        <p>Joined on her ''Hillary 2000'' bus by Senators Charles E. Schumer of New York and Barbara A. Mikulski of Maryland, Mrs. Clinton defended her decision to return the $50,000 from members of the American Muslim Alliance collected at a fund-raiser in Boston in June. She said members had been quoted making statements that support violence. She also said the group's Internet site included offensive material. But she acknowledged that she had not reached out to members of the group to clarify their views.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton said voters should hold the campaign of Representative Rick A. Lazio, her Republican opponent, responsible for telephone calls that try to link the donations to her from the Muslim group to the bombing of the American destroyer Cole in Yemen. The state's Republican Party said today that the references to the bombing of the naval ship  would be deleted, but neither the party nor Mr. Lazio's campaign issued an apology.</p>
        <p>Members of the alliance, which is based in Fremont, Calif., have complained in interviews that their views have been distorted by both the Clinton and Lazio campaigns and that they have been cast as terrorist sympathizers for taking unpopular positions that criticize Israel and side with the Palestinians in the Middle East troubles.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton, on the second day of a three-day upstate bus tour, rose just after daybreak to attend early services at two churches in Buffalo. She made seven campaign stops in Buffalo, Cheektowaga, Rochester, Auburn and Syracuse. The message to traditionally Democratic-voting ethnic groups: Get out and vote.</p>
        <p>''Turnout is key,'' Mr. Schumer said from the pulpit of the St. John Baptist Church in Buffalo. ''It will ensure victory.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's get-out-the-vote message was tougher to communicate at St. Michael's Church, a Roman Catholic parish here in Rochester. About a half dozen anti-abortion protesters were escorted out of the church by the police when they heckled Mrs. Clinton for her abortion-rights stance.</p>
