        <p>I discovered a new expression (new to me, anyway) last week when I heard Internet entrepreneurs describe attracting an audience as ''generating eyeballs.'' This notion had a winning sci-fi ghoulishness. I instantly saw detached orbs whirling through space, reproducing madly as they went.</p>
        <p>I was at a conference sponsored by the Black Filmmakers Foundation. The ''eyeballs'' expression was first used there by Benjamin Sun, the president of Community Connect, a company that owns two successful Web sites for minorities, Black  Planet.com and Asian Avenue.com, and has just started a third for Latinos, Migente.com. And not surprisingly Internet, film and television people at the conference were talking about the presence (limited) and the relative absence (perpetual) of minority groups in these media.</p>

        <p>I discovered a new expression (new to me, anyway) last week when I heard Internet entrepreneurs describe attracting an audience as ''generating eyeballs.'' This notion had a winning sci-fi ghoulishness. I instantly saw detached orbs whirling through space, reproducing madly as they went.</p>
        <p>I was at a conference sponsored by the Black Filmmakers Foundation. The ''eyeballs'' expression was first used there by Benjamin Sun, the president of Community Connect, a company that owns two successful Web sites for minorities, Black  Planet.com and Asian Avenue.com, and has just started a third for Latinos, Migente.com. And not surprisingly Internet, film and television people at the conference were talking about the presence (limited) and the relative absence (perpetual) of minority groups in these media.</p>
        <p>When, for instance, do restrictive cultural presumptions apply: the old saw that black films never sell abroad and the conviction that no successful prime-time television shows can star actors who are Asian-American, Hispanic-American, Native American or Arab-American.</p>
        <p>African-American shows tend to reside in segregated time blocks on upstart networks like UPN, which knows that financially at least black audiences don't destroy the neighborhood. When it comes to demographics, Latinos dominate the moviegoing population. Why then are they nearly absent in films, unless, like Cameron Diaz, they are cast as Anglos, or like Jennifer Lopez, now receive scripts in which ethnicity doesn't matter?</p>
        <p>So I reimagined those eyeballs in terms of broad stereotypes: blacks' eyeballs, rolling at supersonic speed, giving a hip-hop performance of what the poet Vachel Lindsay once called the race's ''basic savagery'' and ''irrepressible high spirits.'' Or Asian and Arab eyeballs -- no, let's say ''Oriental'' to get the full effect -- sheathed in mystery, promising decadent pleasures, perhaps hatching devious plots. Or smoldering Latin eyeballs, daring us to throw off all inhibitions, to be lusty and lawless.</p>
        <p>And then I thought about television because, like the Internet, it is in our homes, and to generate eyeballs in a private space is to generate the fixed obsessions that mark television watching, from the old-fashioned ''I have to see my show every week'' to ''I have to watch reruns every day'' to ''I have to watch and tape at the same time'' to compulsive channel surfing. Or, ''I just keep the damned thing on, whatever I'm doing.''</p>
        <p>Why don't current network shows starring people of color, whose private lives matter as much as their work lives, generate the eyeballs of white viewers?</p>
        <p>It's certainly true that the better network dramas about the workplace (''The Practice'' and ''E.R.,'' for instance) feature African-American actors and racially specific narratives. And cable networks do better, with a few series like ''Resurrection City'' (Showtime) and ''Oz'' (HBO), and with movies. On Wednesday HBO will offer a new channel, HBO Latino, to its subscribers.</p>
        <p>But network television is apparently living in another country that, demographically, existed several decades ago. Inadequate as the African-American presence is, other minorities are almost totally absent. What makes network management, advertisers, producers, directors and writers so dismissive and uncomfortable?</p>
        <p>Generally, minority groups are allowed certain desirable traits in the culture, which they pay for with a matched set of negative traits. Blacks, who have always occupied a huge space in the American imagination, are permitted to be fabulously entertaining. The price is that they are always on or over the edge of the anti-social: primitive (though gifted) and best suited to the kind of broad comedy and melodrama that is marked by highly identifiable body language and speech patterns. By these lights, ''The Cosby Show'' remains astonishing, despite its conventional form and content. And if ''Gideon's Crossing,'' starring Andre Braugher as a doctor, succeeds, that too will be astonishing. And imagine -- he has a Latino colleague, played by Ruben Blades. I just hope neither of them has to be too Good.</p>
        <p>When it comes to being Good, Asian-Americans are often called ''the model minority'': upwardly mobile or securely middle-class; high achievers, academically and professionally. They are allotted almost no cultural visibility or glamour, scant verbal or sexual panache. (The successful mass entertainment vehicles featuring Asians, like martial arts films or action thrillers, tend to come from Asian sources and star Asians, not Asian-Americans.)</p>
        <p>I am not criticizing Lucy Liu when I say that she fits into ''Ally McBeal,'' because the show is a fantasy with realistic trappings. She is just at the most extreme end of the fantasies. With her invulnerable wit and chill sexuality, she is a yuppie martial arts heroine. Can you tell me that all those network executives, directors and script writers who have known Asian-Americans since grammar school, high school or college really find their lives and personalities so unimaginable?</p>
        <p>As for Latinos, I nearly exhausted their prime-time television presence by mentioning Ruben Blades. Of course, there was Jimmy Smits. And there is that sci-fi thriller-with-irony ''Dark Angel,'' whose star, the appealing Jessica Alba, is trans-ethnic on the air because she is trans-human. Wasn't the last network television show starring a Latino ''Chico and the Man,'' with Freddie Prinze (the father, not the son), which went off the air in 1978?</p>
        <p>Thanks to the fashion world and to the so-called Latin explosion embodied by Ricky Martin and Jennifer Lopez, there is a generically Mediterranean or tropical look that is quite popular. But the boundaries are strictly drawn. If they weren't, we would see a range of characters and stories that approaches the range found in a country with people of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban and Dominican descent (and those are just the four largest groups in the Latino population).</p>
        <p>To begin with, there is the language question. Despite the fact that English is the primary language of most Latinos born in the United States, they are still treated as a largely Spanish-speaking niche market. Unless the character is played by a star like Mr. Smits or Ms. Lopez, films and television still recirculate heavy accents and assembly-line plot cliches about Colombian drug lords, petty street hoods with grieving mothers or illegal aliens drawn into crime. Latinos must be identified clearly as a deprived -- often depraved -- minority. But again, given the numbers and the variety of Latinos, how can these dreary types be the only ones television creators can invent?</p>
        <p>Latinos upset the fixed notions of race cherished by so many in the United States. They won't stay put as whites, Indians or blacks. They fit into each of those categories, sometimes separately, sometimes at once.</p>
        <p>Whoever said that art imitates life? Some art does. But a lot of entertainment takes one quick look at what life has to offer, then goes running in the opposite direction.</p>
        <p>Correction:  November 2, 2000, Thursday  The Revisions column in the arts pages on Monday, about the scarcity of minority characters in television series, misidentified a Showtime series focusing on a Latino family. It is ''Resurrection Blvd.,'' not ''Resurrection City.''</p>
