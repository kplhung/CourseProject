        <p>Despite a trail of clues suggesting that the destroyer Cole was bombed by Islamic militants, possibly associated with Osama bin Laden, American investigators lack the concrete evidence to prove anything, administration and government officials say. Washington is wary of inflaming political turmoil in the Middle East by making unsubstantiated accusations, the officials say.</p>
        <p>President Clinton has vowed to find and punish those behind the attack that killed 17 sailors and wounded 39. But investigators say that amassing evidence takes time and that they are also being slowed by Yemeni officials' refusal to let Americans question scores of people detained so far.</p>
        <p>The administration's national security advisers appear content to give the investigators time to build a stronger case before retaliating -- which could defer the potentially divisive question of a military response until after the election on Nov. 7.</p>
        <p>''There is not that open-and-shut case,'' an administration official involved in overseeing the Cole investigation said today, comparing it with the speedy investigation of the bombings of American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in August 1998. ''We don't have those kinds of breaks -- yet. We may get them, but we may not.''</p>
        <p>There are some striking similarities between the bombing of the Cole and previous terrorist attacks in the Middle East that the Clinton administration has linked to Mr. bin Laden's amorphous network of Islamic militant groups.</p>
        <p>However, investigators say they lack the kind of concrete evidence they swiftly amassed in the inquiry into the embassy bombings, when intercepted communications and the arrest of a suspect in Pakistan quickly led investigators to the network of Mr. bin Laden, who is wanted by the F.B.I. on suspicion of masterminding the bombing of the American embassies.</p>
        <p>In 1998, the Clinton administration launched cruise missiles against a training camp in Afghanistan and a pharmaceutical factory in the Sudan, whose owner later protested that his factory had not manufactured chemical weapons and that it had been hit by mistake.</p>
        <p>The current investigation has been complicated by cultural and diplomatic clashes between American and Yemeni investigators. The Yemenis have so far refused to allow investigators to directly question suspects or witnesses in Aden, though they have allowed the Americans to submit questions.</p>
        <p>One official in Washington said American investigators have asked to question ''a couple hundred'' witnesses, including people in the harbor on the morning of the attack and those who lived near the safe houses used by the suspected bombers. The failure to have access to those identified as suspects by Yemen's president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, has made it impossible for American investigators to determine their involvement, the official said. ''If this were a U.S.-only operation, it would be conducted at a different speed,'' an official involved in overseeing the investigation said.</p>
        <p>As it is, evidence collected aboard the Cole and elsewhere in Aden -- along with statements by witnesses -- have provided investigators with what several officials here called strong leads.</p>
        <p>The information suggests to them that the attack was a carefully designed plot carried out by a dedicated group, not just the two suicide attackers who piloted the small boat through the harbor to the Cole. Those involved, the officials said, appeared to have been highly motivated and disciplined, and they managed to maintain airtight operational security over several weeks, or longer, as they planned and initiated their attack from safe houses in Aden.</p>
        <p>Investigators believe that the group included at least one explosives expert. According to the investigators' preliminary reconstruction, the attackers precisely packed a sophisticated plastic explosive and engineered a system of detonating switches and wiring to direct the force of the blast into the Cole's hull.</p>
        <p>Investigators are now comparing the chemical analysis of the bomb to intelligence reports that might indicate which groups had recently acquired that type of explosive, the officials said.</p>
        <p>In some respects, the attack on  the Cole resembled the bombing of an apartment building housing American airmen in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, in June 1996 and the explosion at a training center in Riyadh, Saudia Arabia, in November 1995. There were important differences, however. The Cole attackers were suicide bombers, unlike those in Saudi Arabia, who fled their bomb-filled vehicles moments before they exploded. In Dhahran, the bombers were believed be Saudi dissidents supported by Iran -- a group that investigators said appears unlikely to be behind the Cole attack.</p>
        <p>Of the five previous bombings against American targets in the Middle East, the only suspects brought to an American court were those charged with the 1998 embassy bombings, among them six people in American custody and another three being held in England. Eight others, including Mr. bin Laden, remain at large.</p>
        <p>On the day of the Khobar Towers bombing in Dhahran, which killed 19 Americans, Mr. Clinton vowed that ''the cowards who committed this murderous act must not go unpunished.''</p>
        <p>But more than four and half years later, the investigation has followed an uneven and frustrating trajectory. American authorities have never obtained the cooperation that the Saudis first promised nor have law enforcement officials ever established who committed the attack, although the Saudis later executed three men. In private, American investigators have said the trail leads to militants in Iran where American hopes for improved relations have complicated the search for suspects and the possibility of retaliation.</p>
        <p>In fact, the officials said, American investigators in the case of the Cole are off to a better start. ''They are moving faster and getting competent help and therefore are opening many leads,'' said a senior congressional official who has been briefed on the status of the investigation.</p>
