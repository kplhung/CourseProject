        <p>Reflecting an increasing intervention by foreign governments in American death penalty cases, Mexico has sent a formal protest to the State Department in an effort to prevent the execution of a Mexican citizen scheduled to be put to death in two weeks.</p>
        <p>The Mexican government has said  that the condemned man, Miguel Angel Flores, was deprived of due process because he was not advised of his right to contact the Mexican embassy, in violation of an international treaty.</p>
        <p>Mexican officials did not become aware of the charges against Mr. Flores -- in the 1989 rape and murder of a 20-year-old video store employee in Hutchinson County, in the Texas panhandle -- until nearly one year after he had been sentenced to death, the government said in the letter. It was delivered to the State Department on Oct. 19.</p>
        <p>The Mexican government said it would have helped him hire a lawyer and would have ensured that members of his family, who do not speak English, had been available to testify on his behalf. Mr. Flores, 20 at the time of the crime, had no criminal record or history of violence, but his court-appointed lawyer, who did not speak Spanish, put on no character witnesses or mitigating evidence.</p>
        <p>Mexico wants Mr. Flores's sentence commuted to life in prison and has asked the State Department to intercede with officials in Texas, where Mr. Flores is on death row. He has filed a last-minute appeal with the Supreme Court.</p>
        <p>The State Department said it took seriously the failure of states to advise defendants of their notification rights and has asked Texas for an explanation. Texas officials said that whether Mr. Flores, who came to the United States when he was a child, had been properly advised of his consular rights was a matter to be resolved by the courts.</p>
        <p>Whatever the outcome, the Flores case illustrates the tensions between the United States and foreign governments, including many allies, created by the small but growing number of foreign citizens on death row. Of particular concern are the cases, like Mr. Flores's, in which foreign inmates have not been advised of their rights to contact the governments through their embassies in the United States. That right is guaranteed under the Vienna Convention and the United States aggressively demands that it be accorded American citizens detained abroad.</p>
        <p>Although experts in death penalty law say they have no concrete figures, they say they believe the numbers of such cases may be growing in proportion to the number of foreign citizens on death row. At least 87 foreign citizens -- from 28 countries -- are on death row, in 16 states. Forty-six are Mexican citizens, the Mexican government said.</p>
        <p>In the last two and a half years, six states have executed a foreign citizen, according to the Death Penalty Information Center, a nongovernmental organization in Washington.  None of the six were advised of their consular rights.</p>
        <p>In a landmark case that is to be argued next month, Germany is suing the United States in the World Court, seeking reparations for the execution in Arizona last year of two brothers, Karl and Walter LaGrand.  They were not advised of their consular rights, Arizona officials acknowledged many years after their incarceration. It is only the fourth time in nearly half a century that an ally has sued the United States in the international court, and if the court rules for Germany, other countries are likely to sue, diplomats and lawyers said.</p>
        <p>The issue is particularly contentious with the Mexican government.</p>
        <p>''It is a strain on bilateral relations,'' Jorge G. Castaneda, foreign policy adviser to Mexico's president-elect, Vicente Fox Quesada, said about the number of Mexicans on death row in the United States. Mr. Fox plans to raise the issue when he meets with the United States president-elect, which is expected to be in late November, Mr. Castaneda said. Mexico, which has the death penalty but has not executed anyone since the 1940's, considers it ''inhuman punishment,'' Mr. Castaneda said, noting that this was the view of nearly all European countries.</p>
        <p>Of Washington's policy of apologizing, Mr. Castaneda said: ''It's nice, it's polite. But it's not enough.''</p>
        <p>Even in cases when a Mexican has been advised of the right to consular notification, Mexico will push for a commutation of the convict's sentence to life in prison, said Jesus F. Reyes-Heroles, Mexico's ambassador in Washington.</p>
        <p>''It's a moral issue,'' he said. While Mexico may be the most active, because of the numbers, he said that the problem of foreign nationals being sentenced to death ''transcends Mexico.''</p>
        <p>In the first nine months of this year, the European Union, which has called on the United States to abolish the death penalty, has intervened in 11 death penalty cases, according to the E.U. Web site, which has a section for the death penalty (www.eurunion.org).</p>
        <p>Two years ago, Paraguay appealed, unsuccessfully, to the State Department and the governor of Virginia to block the execution of Angel Francisco Breard, who was convicted of murder and attempted rape. The State Department acknowledged that his rights under the Vienna Convention had been violated. ''We fully appreciate that the United States must see to it that foreign nationals in the United States receive the same treatment that we expect for our citizens overseas,'' the department said. ''We cannot have a double standard.''</p>
        <p>Philip T. Reeker, a State Department spokesman, said this week:  ''Our own consular officers regularly raise this issue with foreign governments when U.S. citizens are arrested abroad, that they have the opportunity to speak with their consular representatives. So it is entirely appropriate to raise this case with us.'' He added that the department does not believe that the resolution lies in the criminal justice process.</p>
        <p>In the Breard case, the agency  apologized to Paraguay for the violation of his rights. This is the standard response when a foreign citizen's Vienna Convention rights have been violated, the State Department's legal office wrote last year in a case involving seven Chinese defendants who were not advised of their consular rights when they were arrested off the coast of Bermuda and charged with smuggling.</p>
        <p>Paraguay and Mr. Breard appealed to the Supreme Court. Without reaching a decision on the merits, the court said, in an unsigned opinion, that Mr. Breard's lawyers ''were likely far better able to explain the United States legal system to him than any consular official would have been.''</p>
        <p>But advocates for foreign citizens  argue that an individual from a defendant's culture, who has lived in the United States as a diplomat, is  better equipped to explain legal proceedings.</p>
        <p>To illustrate, Mark Warren, who works for Amnesty International on issues of foreign citizens and the death penalty, gave the example of a suspect who is told by the police that he has a right to remain silent. That does not mean much to a person who comes from a country where police routinely torture a suspect who does not confess. But if he hears that from a diplomat who is now in the United States, he might believe it.</p>
        <p>Mr. Warren also gave the example of a Mexican suspect in Colorado who told the police he did not need a lawyer but wanted to see the judge; the police wondered why he would conceivably want to see a judge. What the police did not know was that in Mexico, as well as in most European countries, judges supervise criminal investigations.</p>
        <p>A judge in the case said the fact that the defendant wanted to speak to a judge was ''a clear indication that he did not understand the legal proceedings.''</p>
        <p>Sandra Babcock, a Minneapolis lawyer who is representing the Mexican government in several cases, said that the involvement of Mexican officials is critical in getting witnesses to court for a defendant, particularly family members. In death penalty cases, prosecutors generally seek to depict the defendant as cold and inhuman. Family members can rebut that.</p>
        <p>The families of Mexican defendants often live in villages in Mexico, are poor, do not have travel documents and are frightened by the prospect of coming to the United States, Ms. Babcock said. Mexican officials can overcome those obstacles, she said.</p>
        <p>The Mexican government is so concerned about the problem that it has given Ms. Babcock a $300,000 grant to set up a project to provide legal assistance to Mexican citizens on death row.</p>
        <p>When Mexican officials have become involved, they have achieved notable success in helping Mexicans avoid the death penalty.</p>
        <p>Rodolfo Quilantan, the legal attache at the Mexican embassy, said that in the last two years, he had persuaded prosecutors in Ohio, Oregon, Texas and Virginia to not seek the death penalty in murder cases. Altogether, Mexican consular officials have intervened in 261 death penalty cases since December 1994, and in 119 of those cases prosecutors did not proceed with a capital prosecution, according to the Mexican foreign ministry.</p>
        <p>The intervention by Mexico's consular officer in Miami was critical in saving Sergio Soto from the death penalty, said his lawyer, Clayton Kaeiser. The prosecution had a strong case against Mr. Soto on charges of kidnapping, robbery and murder, Mr. Kaeiser said, and it was tried in Palm Beach, Fla., ''a very conservative jurisdiction where feelings against foreigners are high in such cases.''</p>
        <p>The Mexican government paid for medical experts who discovered that Mr. Soto suffered from brain damage, and for investigators to go to Mexico, where they located witnesses who testified about Mr. Soto's upbringing, Mr. Kaeiser said. This evidence was critical in the jury sentencing Mr. Soto to life, instead of imposing the death sentence, he said.</p>
