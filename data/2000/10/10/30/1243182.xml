        <p>The producer Cy Feuer comes rambling out of a back room of his Park Avenue apartment with a phony grimace on his face and a resolution in mind.

        <p>Then, a moment later, his resolve melts away and the stories begin to flow like a Cole Porter song. Like the time he discovered a 17-year-old Julie Andrews in an English play about the Ku Klux Klan. (''I listened for a second and said, 'She has perfect pitch.' '') Or the time he posted a Pinkerton man at the stage door of the Royale Theater to prevent Sandy Wilson, the composer and book writer of ''The Boy Friend,'' from tinkering with the show. (''They called me a monster. But the show went on, and it was a complete smash.'') Or the time he fired George S. Kaufman -- the George S.

        <p>The producer Cy Feuer comes rambling out of a back room of his Park Avenue apartment with a phony grimace on his face and a resolution in mind. ''I don't want to tell the same old stories all over again,'' he says, sounding every bit the Brooklyn-bred wise guy he is, ''because nobody wants to hear them anymore.''</p>
        <p>Then, a moment later, his resolve melts away and the stories begin to flow like a Cole Porter song. Like the time he discovered a 17-year-old Julie Andrews in an English play about the Ku Klux Klan. (''I listened for a second and said, 'She has perfect pitch.' '') Or the time he posted a Pinkerton man at the stage door of the Royale Theater to prevent Sandy Wilson, the composer and book writer of ''The Boy Friend,'' from tinkering with the show. (''They called me a monster. But the show went on, and it was a complete smash.'') Or the time he fired George S. Kaufman -- the George S. Kaufman -- after that old dean of the stage tried to meddle with the musical ''Silk Stockings.''</p>
        <p>All of these theatrical tales -- and countless more -- will be recalled tonight at a gala to honor Mr. Feuer, the producer, at the Chelsea Piers, an event that celebrates his 90th birthday and his more than half a century of work in the American theater. Mr. Feuer won't hit the big 9-oh until early next year, but, as he said, ''Any excuse for a gala will do.''</p>
        <p>''If I'd died at 87,'' he added with a laugh, ''none of this would have been necessary.''</p>
        <p>Working with his longtime producing partner, Ernest H. Martin, Mr. Feuer was responsible for some of the best-known shows of all time, including ''Guys and Dolls,'' ''Can-Can,'' ''Little Me'' and ''How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying,'' a show that he said almost closed in Philadelphia because some ticket buyers thought it was a lecture. The team also once owned a Broadway theater (the Lunt-Fontanne), ran a few others (those of the San Francisco Civic Light Opera Association, for example) and produced the movie versions of ''A Chorus Line'' and ''Cabaret.''</p>
        <p>But that's a whole other story.</p>
        <p>Mr. Martin died in 1995, and Mr. Feuer has had some bad health lately; in July he had a valve replaced in his heart. Now, amazingly, he seems as spry as a man half his age.</p>
        <p>''I feel great,'' he said, trying to ply a reporter with a glass of wine, an old Broadway trick. ''I thought, 'Geez, at my age, what do I need that for?' But when the time came, and you can't catch your breath, you forget about all of your resolutions.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Feuer's Broadway producing career began in 1948 with ''Where's Charley?,'' a musical comedy starring Ray Bolger that became a runaway hit on the strength of Frank Loesser's score. Bolstered by this success, the pair then optioned a musical based on a Damon Runyan short story called ''The Idyll of Miss Sarah Brown.''</p>
        <p>The 1950 show, composed by Mr. Loesser and directed by Mr. Kaufman, was ''Guys and Dolls,'' one of the most loved musicals in history. Mr. Feuer remains one of the show's biggest fans.</p>
        <p>''I think the two greatest musicals ever done, and I'm not trying to be immodest, are 'My Fair Lady' and 'Guys and Dolls,' '' he said, ''because they had something to say.''</p>
        <p>Over the next two decades Mr. Feuer and Mr. Martin produced more than half a dozen big hits -- and of course some big flops -- each of which came with its own internal dramas. Take ''How to Succeed,'' for example, for which the producers hired an untested young choreographer named Hugh Lambert on the basis of a single dance routine they had seen.</p>
        <p>''Boy, it was great, this one number,'' Mr. Feuer said. ''And we're going along and all of the sudden I realize: 'That's it. That was his one number.' '' In a panic, Mr. Feuer called his friend Bob Fosse and begged for help. Mr. Fosse finally relented but refused to take a choreography credit; he insisted on ''musical staging'' instead, to spare Mr. Lambert's feelings.</p>
        <p>Nowadays Mr. Feuer doesn't produce, but he still serves as chairman of the League of American Theaters and Producers, a trade organization. Does he miss anything about the old days?</p>
        <p>''I hate the phrase the 'good old days,' '' Mr. Feuer says, his tough-guy exterior returning for a second. ''It doesn't apply and doesn't serve any purpose.''</p>
        <p>A moment later, he adds: ''But it sure was fun.''</p>
