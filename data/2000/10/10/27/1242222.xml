        <p>When Marcus Coleman signed his five-year, $20 million contract with the Jets after last season, his fellow cornerback Aaron Glenn had a talk with him.</p>
        <p>''Don't even think about the contract,'' Glenn told Coleman. ''Think about how you want to be looked at. You want to be looked at by coaches and players like you always played. You want people to say he was a good player, not that he made a lot of money.''</p>

        <p>When Marcus Coleman signed his five-year, $20 million contract with the Jets after last season, his fellow cornerback Aaron Glenn had a talk with him.</p>
        <p>''Don't even think about the contract,'' Glenn told Coleman. ''Think about how you want to be looked at. You want to be looked at by coaches and players like you always played. You want people to say he was a good player, not that he made a lot of money.''</p>
        <p>Coleman had a breakthrough season in 1999, when he had six interceptions. A free agent, he cashed in with a big contract and then began this season quietly, with no interceptions through the first six games. The former Jets coach Bill Parcells used to talk derisively about one-year wonders. Had Coleman succumbed to human nature and relaxed a bit after he had assured himself of riches?</p>
        <p>Apparently not. Glenn told Coleman and Ray Mickens before the Miami game that he thought the ball would be thrown their way and they would have chances for big plays. Coleman had three interceptions Monday night, two of them on the same drive in overtime (he fumbled one away). The last one led to John Hall's game-winning field goal.</p>
        <p>Coleman nearly had a fourth interception, but he dropped a ball earlier in the game. He is now second on the team in interceptions behind Victor Green, who has four.</p>
        <p>''If I had three picks, I might retire,'' Glenn said. ''They say they come in bunches, so if you have three, you can't retire, because you might get four and five.''</p>
        <p>That could happen on Sunday because Coleman figures to be defending against the Bills' go-to receiver, Eric Moulds, when the teams play in Buffalo. Moulds is Buffalo's leading receiver and has already caught 53 passes for 695 yards. That is almost 20 more receptions than any Jet has.</p>
        <p>Part of Coleman's drop in statistics reflects the fact that opposing offenses avoid throwing to his side of the field. But because Moulds is such an integral part of the Buffalo offense, Coleman is confident he will have plenty of work.</p>
        <p>''During the time we weren't getting a whole lot of balls, I wasn't getting half as many as I did last year,'' Coleman said of how teams avoided throwing in his direction. ''Once you start making plays, consistently, the balls drop off a little bit. But Moulds is going to get the ball. They're going to look for him, whether he's covered or not. That's what you want. As a defensive back, when you're covering a wideout, you look forward to the matchup. You want to cover a go-to guy.''</p>
        <p>Coach Al Groh said he was pleased with how Coleman was playing, despite the fact that it took until Game 7 for Coleman to get an interception. Groh said that in particular he was pleased that Coleman seems to understand the difficult life of a cornerback, where one wrong move could expose the Jets to disaster.</p>
        <p>Coleman said he did not approach this season -- after signing the big contract -- any differently.</p>
        <p>''I was just coming in to get better,'' Coleman said. ''I wasn't worried about this being a fluke year, or a one-year wonder. Because I know I'm not. The only thing I had to prove, not necessarily to myself but to teammates and coaches, was I could play on a consistent level like that every week. I think I've been doing it every week. What happened Monday night -- it just happened like that. I've been solid the whole year. As long as I know I'm doing my job, I don't have to get 8 to 10 picks a game.''</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>HBO microphones for the show ''Inside the N.F.L.'' picked up a third-quarter exchange between the Dolphins' JASON TAYLOR and JAY FIEDLER, in which Taylor remarked on the fans leaving the game early. ''It's still early, where are you going?'' Taylor said mockingly. Replied Fiedler, ''They ain't coming back on us!'' Oops. . . . Running back BERNIE PARMALEE (hamstring) was upgraded from doubtful to questionable on Thursday's injury report. Receiver WAYNE CHREBET (shoulder) was added, although he is listed as probable.</p>
