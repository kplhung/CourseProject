        <p>The 10th Annual Exhibition  Asian-American Arts Center  26 Bowery, Lower East Side  Through Nov. 4</p>
        <p>Among its many services, the Asian-American Art Center maintains a slide file from which an annual show of young, underexhibited artists is drawn. Most of the participants are Asian-born, but there's nothing necessarily ''Asian'' about the work. The unstated theme of this show is a cross-cultural one of making art incrementally from ordinary things.</p>
        <p>Words, for example, accumulate in an installation by Taro Hattori that includes a taped version of a long, going-nowhere lovers' conversation. (The text is from a book by the psychologist R. D. Laing.) Han Sam Son builds up and chips away at thick layers of industrial cardboard to make an abstract wall sculpture. Akiko Ikeuchi passes a single thread across the gallery. It's barely visible, but every inch of it has been knotted.</p>
        <p>A video piece by Sookjin Suh involves creating grids from squares of tofu and butter, while Soonok Jung executes fine networks of tubular forms that suggest microscopic life and city plans. Jane Tsong presents dozens of drawings that look both vague and vaguely alike: as a conceptual project, she asked a succession of people to copy a single basic pattern and in each case using the last version done as the model for the next, so that the original template gradually changed in detail, like a story passed along.</p>
        <p>The single best-looking piece is by Byung-Wang Cho, who has curtained off a corner of the gallery and outlined objects inside with fluorescent red paint; their forms seen in black light glow like a 3-D geometric painting. Mr. Cho's maximal use of minimal space is an Asian-American Art Center specialty. Its small galleries play host to lectures, panel discussions, performances and community-based classes and still manage to put new art careers into orbit every year.</p>
