        <p>This is a city ruled by business, so it is little surprise that a businessman, Li Ka-shing, is widely thought to be Hong Kong's most powerful person. The question is whether Mr. Li has become too powerful even for a city that celebrates his kind of empire-building.</p>

        <p>This is a city ruled by business, so it is little surprise that a businessman, Li Ka-shing, is widely thought to be Hong Kong's most powerful person. The question is whether Mr. Li has become too powerful even for a city that celebrates his kind of empire-building.</p>
        <p>In a report adopted today by the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France, Hong Kong came under fire for allowing Mr. Li, 72, and his family to amass undue influence over the city's commercial life and its stock market. Saying the Li family's companies accounted for up to a third of Hong Kong's total market value, the report expressed concern that competition in the city was no longer fair.</p>
        <p>In particular, the Europeans noted that Mr. Li had been granted a passel of exemptions by the Hong Kong Stock Exchange for the listing of his Internet company Tom.com and that his son Richard, 32, had been awarded a lucrative contract to build a science park without open bidding.</p>
        <p>''If there is any substance to these allegations,'' the report concluded, ''they have significant implications for E.U. businesses who either trade with or locate their Asian headquarters in Hong Kong.''</p>
        <p>Though the European Parliament's judgments carry limited force, they nevertheless struck a nerve here. Hong Kong has built an economy far out of proportion to its size or population, based on a reputation for honest courts and untrammeled commerce.</p>
        <p>The government rejected the accusations, saying that ''all businesses, irrespective of their origins, are competing on a level playing field.'' It said the younger Mr. Li won the contract to build the park, called Cyberport, because he promised to build it quickly and to bear the risk.</p>
        <p>The Beijing-appointed chief executive of Hong Kong, Tung Chee-hwa, said: ''Hong Kong's economic freedom is one of the best in the world. It's the same or better than any of the advanced countries.''</p>
        <p>Unlike Europe or the United States, Hong Kong does not have antitrust laws. It relies on government agencies to monitor some industries, like telecommunications. And it takes a rigorously hands-off attitude toward business -- accepting as a fact of life that monopolies take root in small economies.</p>
        <p>Mr. Li, who came here in the 1940's as a refugee from Guangdong province, just north on the mainland, is a testament to that laissez-faire philosophy. Starting as a maker of plastic flowers, he cobbled together an empire that ranges from telecommunications and ports to supermarkets.</p>
        <p>His son Richard followed him into business, starting an Internet venture in 1999. Barely a year later, he began a $38 billion takeover of Hong Kong's dominant telephone company, Cable and Wireless HKT.</p>
        <p>Richard Li's company, Pacific Century CyberWorks, has been humbled by an 80 percent decline in its share price since February. Still, with the exception of his father, he remains the most prominent businessman in Hong Kong.</p>
        <p>And the Li family's influence does not end here. The Far Eastern Economic Review reported this week that the Chinese government had ordered the local authorities to limit the influence of Li Ka-shing's most prominent company, Hutchison Whampoa, in future port projects on the mainland. Hutchison, which already dominates Hong Kong's port, owns large stakes in the ports of Shanghai, Shenzhen and Xiamen.</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman for Hutchison, Laura Cheung, said today that Beijing officials had not told the company they wanted to curb its role. She also said the European Parliament's report was inaccurate, adding that Mr. Li's companies accounted for only 15 percent of the Hong Kong market's value. Even adding Pacific Century CyberWorks, the figure was less than 18 percent.</p>
        <p>John Cushnahan, the European Parliament member who wrote the report, said in an interview: ''Even if it's only 15 percent, it's a substantial holding. More to the point, look at the way Tom.com was taken public.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cushnahan said the government should secure passage of antitrust laws to reassure its trading partners that they would receive fair treatment. ''When Hong Kong companies trade with us,'' he said, ''they do so in an environment where monopolies are not allowed. It's only fair that they do the same for us.''</p>
        <p>Even business people who have tangled with Mr. Li question whether an antitrust law is the best way to curb his power. Jimmy Lai, a newspaper publisher who challenged Mr. Li's supermarket chain with a home-delivery service, cautioned that new laws would allow the government to pick winners and losers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lai said the bigger concern ought to be the relationship between the government and the Li family.</p>
        <p>''It is true that some tycoons have monopolies,'' Mr. Lai said. ''That's natural in a small market. But cronyism is something the whole world should focus on. We should base our judgments on his ability to push the government.''</p>
