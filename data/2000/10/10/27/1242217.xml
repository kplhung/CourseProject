        <hl1>A Pernicious Secrecy Bill</hl1>
      </hedline>
      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial says bill that was approved by House and Senate with little debate and no open hearings would make it crime for officials to disclose any information that is 'properly classified'; says there is no need to widen bill already on books that makes it crime for government officials to disclose especially sensitive kinds of classified information; says bill in question could be used to prosecute whistle-blowers who release information about government misconduct; calls on Pres Clinton to veto this undemocratic bill</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Congress has delivered to President Clinton a misguided bill that would deny the American people access to information that is vital to maintaining an open, democratic society. The bill, which is attached to the intelligence authorization bill and was approved by the House and Senate with little debate and no open hearings, would make it a crime for officials to disclose any information that is ''properly classified.'' If Mr. Clinton signs this measure he will undermine his effort to reduce government secrecy, a signal achievement of his presidency.</p>
        <p>It is already a crime for government officials to disclose especially sensitive kinds of classified information, including nuclear weapons secrets, codes and plans for military operations. Broadening the coverage of criminal law to the disclosure of just about any kind of information that is classified would freeze public discussion of government policies and actions that require open debate. The bill, for example, could be used to prosecute whistleblowers who release information about government misconduct. If the law were on the books today, it would be almost impossible for the American people to assess why security aboard the U.S.S. Cole was inadequate.</p>

        <p>Congress has delivered to President Clinton a misguided bill that would deny the American people access to information that is vital to maintaining an open, democratic society. The bill, which is attached to the intelligence authorization bill and was approved by the House and Senate with little debate and no open hearings, would make it a crime for officials to disclose any information that is ''properly classified.'' If Mr. Clinton signs this measure he will undermine his effort to reduce government secrecy, a signal achievement of his presidency.</p>
        <p>It is already a crime for government officials to disclose especially sensitive kinds of classified information, including nuclear weapons secrets, codes and plans for military operations. Broadening the coverage of criminal law to the disclosure of just about any kind of information that is classified would freeze public discussion of government policies and actions that require open debate. The bill, for example, could be used to prosecute whistleblowers who release information about government misconduct. If the law were on the books today, it would be almost impossible for the American people to assess why security aboard the U.S.S. Cole was inadequate.</p>
        <p>''Properly classified'' information means information classified according to the law, an open-ended category that includes hundreds of thousands of documents that should never have been classified in the first place, either because they are unimportant or because they cover up embarrassing misdeeds about which the public has a right to know. The standard could be interpreted as covering information that is not stamped classified but is effectively the same as information classified elsewhere in the government. Officials could be prosecuted for releasing material even if they had good reason to believe it was public information.</p>
        <p>The measure opens the door to selective prosecution of current or former officials who differ from the authorized line. For example, officials could be prosecuted for warning publicly about lax security at American embassies, since their information may have come from classified sources.</p>
        <p>The new bill was introduced at the behest of the C.I.A. and was supported by the Justice Department in a fit of narrow thinking. Though the measure has profound First Amendment implications, it was never reviewed by the judiciary committees. As president, Mr. Clinton has an obligation to consider the national interest when he weighs legislation of this kind. The legitimate secrets of the government can be protected without obstructing the free flow of information. He should veto this undemocratic bill.</p>
