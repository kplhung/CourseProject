        <p>Already soaked with Champagne and overcome with emotion, George Steinbrenner stood in a corner of the jammed Yankees clubhouse last night and cried as he struggled to finish his first few sentences.</p>
        <p>He had just watched the Yankees grab their third consecutive World Series title and their fourth in the last five seasons, and he looked as if he had finished a marathon.</p>
        <p>''We beat a great team,'' Steinbrenner said. ''The Mets gave us everything we could want. It's the battle of New York. It was a great one to win. They showed me as much heart as any team I've ever had.''</p>
        <p>That is when Steinbrenner lowered his head and first started to lose his emotions. His voice cracked and the ever-present white turtleneck he was wearing crumpled as his chin touched his chest. Then the no-nonsense owner defended his right to openly weep by saying, ''We've been down a tough trail. O.K.''</p>
        <p>It had been an amazingly tough September for the Yankees as they lost 14 of their last 17 games, but they regrouped in October and became the first team to win three straight titles since the Oakland Athletics did it from 1972 to 1974.</p>
        <p>Steinbrenner invested an unprecedented $112 million in payroll to transform this team into a champion, and the Yankees, through as much adversity as they have had in the last five years, succeeded and beat the Mets in five games.</p>
        <p>''They never stopped,'' Steinbrenner said. ''They never had doubts. So they made me look good by saying I believe in you guys. Easy to sit back like me, do nothing and watch them do what they did.''</p>
        <p>Derek Jeter had already dumped a bottle of Champagne down Steinbrenner's back and started to open another bottle for a second shower, but the principal owner waved him off. Jeter smiled and did not douse Steinbrenner a second time, but it did not matter. From Steinbrenner's ubiquitous blue blazer to his shoes, he was drenched because of Jeter.</p>
        <p>''He's allowed,'' Steinbrenner said.</p>
        <p>Then Steinbrenner saw Manager Joe Torre hugging Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and said: ''What is this? An Italian coalition?'' Giuliani stepped forward and also hugged Steinbrenner and started dissecting the performance of Luis Sojo, who drove in the winning run.</p>
        <p>''Monday? We're all set,'' Giuliani said. ''Biggest parade ever?''</p>
        <p>Steinbrenner told Giuliani that was fine. Steinbrenner reiterated that he had never had a better relationship with a manager than the one he enjoys with Torre, who also cried and looked like he had run a marathon while carrying the Boss on his back.</p>
        <p>Torre, who is under contract for another season at $3 million, said, ''I am planning to be back as manager, unless George fires me.''</p>
        <p>When Torre saw reporters scribbling his words, he said, ''That was tongue in cheek.''</p>
        <p>After Roger Clemens threw a hunk of a bat near Mike Piazza's path in Game 2, Steinbrenner told one Yankee that the Mets were making excuses and that they would just keep ''playing and winning.'' Not surprisingly, Steinbrenner, who found Clemens for one of his first of two dozen hugs, said that he thought the Clemens bat-throwing incident had been given too much attention.</p>
        <p>''Roger Clemens is going to the Hall of Fame,'' Steinbrenner snapped. ''He deserves to be in the Hall of Fame. He didn't throw the bat at anybody. Besides, if he threw the bat at me, I know he'd hit me.''</p>
        <p>Steinbrenner deflected questions about increasing his payroll and whether he would resign Paul O'Neill. When Steinbrenner was asked how soon he would start working toward a fourth straight championship, he said he wanted to take time to enjoy this title. How long?</p>
        <p>''About 20 hours,'' he said.</p>
