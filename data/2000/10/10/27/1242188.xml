        <p>VOLKSWAGEN A.G. and more than a dozen of its suppliers are planning a gift to Queen Elizabeth II: a Bentley. The car -- her first Bentley -- is due in 2002, to mark her 50th year as monarch.

        <p>VOLKSWAGEN A.G. and more than a dozen of its suppliers are planning a gift to Queen Elizabeth II: a Bentley. The car -- her first Bentley -- is due in 2002, to mark her 50th year as monarch. Although the car will be one of a kind, it will set the style for Bentleys as they take a separate path from Rolls-Royce on Jan. 1, 2003.</p>
        <p>''We started talking to them in January,'' said Simon Loasby, chief of the Rolls-Royce and Bentley styling studio, said of Buckingham Palace. ''And they readily agreed.''</p>
        <p>A full-size (19.5 feet long) clay model of the car is in the studio. The model is painted in a two-tone black, he said, ''but we haven't made a final decision on the color.''</p>
        <p>The car will have a gray cloth interior. Suppliers will provide one-of-a-kind tires, headlamps and other components.</p>
        <p>The floorpan of the current Arnage Red Label will be the basis of the queen's car; the likely engine is a Bentley V-8 that Volkswagen re-engineered last year. Although several of the queen's cars have been converted to run on cleaner-burning liquefied petroleum gas, the engine of the new car is expected to use only gasoline.</p>
        <p>BMW will take over the Rolls-Royce name in 2003, but Volkswagen will keep the factory in Crewe, England, and the Bentley name. Bentley needs to establish its own image, and the queen's car is expected to help.</p>
        <p>''It is very modern, not a retro car,'' Mr. Loasby said. ''A Bentley is a muscular car, with its wheels apart and out. It's probably a tiger, if you're thinking of big cats. We've got a couple of tiger books in the studio.''</p>
