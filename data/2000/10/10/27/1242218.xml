        <p>Deutsche Telekom won a major battle today in its effort to enter the United States when Congress abandoned legislation that would have blocked its proposed acquisition of VoiceStream Wireless.</p>
        <p>After weeks of intense lobbying by the two companies, the lawmakers removed a provision from a spending bill that would have prevented regulators from considering the deal. That provision had been inserted by Senator Ernest Hollings, Democrat of South Carolina, who contends that it is bad policy to permit a company controlled by a foreign government to run a telephone company in the United States.</p>

        <p>Deutsche Telekom won a major battle today in its effort to enter the United States when Congress abandoned legislation that would have blocked its proposed acquisition of VoiceStream Wireless.</p>
        <p>After weeks of intense lobbying by the two companies, the lawmakers removed a provision from a spending bill that would have prevented regulators from considering the deal. That provision had been inserted by Senator Ernest Hollings, Democrat of South Carolina, who contends that it is bad policy to permit a company controlled by a foreign government to run a telephone company in the United States.</p>
        <p>The provision had drawn widespread criticism from the Clinton administration and from European governments. They said it violated international agreements intended to promote free trade. They defended the deal on the grounds that it would introduce more competition in the United States among wireless carriers. They also noted that the German government was committed to reducing its 58 percent stake in Deutsche Telekom.</p>
        <p>The Hollings measure also prompted opposition from an unusual alliance that included the United States Chamber of Commerce and organized labor.</p>
        <p>The two companies had retained more than a half-dozen law firms, lobbying concerns and public relations companies to make their case and managed to sway several top lawmakers who had initially signed on to the Hollings measure, including Senator Trent Lott, the majority leader.</p>
        <p>In recent months, VoiceStream, based in Bellevue, Wash., and its executives had also increased their fund-raising efforts on behalf of political candidates, making more than $100,000 in donations. Among the company's most important supporters has been Senator Slade Gorton, Republican of Washington, who is in a tight re-election fight.</p>
        <p>While President Clinton announced his intention today to veto the spending bill on other grounds, lawmakers and administration officials who opposed the Hollings provision said that it was a dead issue. But some Democrats said Mr. Hollings would try to raise the issue again next year.</p>
        <p>Deutsche Telekom and VoiceStream must now await two other regulatory reviews, which are not expected to end until next year. The Federal Communications Commission is considering whether the transfer of wireless licenses is in the public interest. And an interagency task force known as the Committee on Foreign Investments in the United States and headed by the Treasury secretary is examining whether the deal poses any national security issues.</p>
        <p>Neither of those reviews is expected to pose any obstacles to the completion of the acquisition.</p>
