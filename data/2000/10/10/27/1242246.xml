        <p>An hour before game time, only a handful of Knicks were shooting baskets. Instead of warming up, most players were sitting casually in a locker room at Nassau Coliseum Wednesday night, smiling and laughing as they watched a videotape of their last meeting with the Washington Wizards.</p>

        <p>An hour before game time, only a handful of Knicks were shooting baskets. Instead of warming up, most players were sitting casually in a locker room at Nassau Coliseum Wednesday night, smiling and laughing as they watched a videotape of their last meeting with the Washington Wizards.</p>
        <p>Larry Johnson ribbed Allan Houston about one of his commercials that appeared on the screen during a break in the action, and several players joked about the way Jahidi White, Washington's hulking center, threw down a thunderous slam dunk in front of Johnson and a retreating Marcus Camby.</p>
        <p>''Look at them boys back up!'' one Knick shouted, mocking the tone of an angry coach during a film session.</p>
        <p>While it may not have been the best form of preparation, at least those Knicks were in uniform. Latrell Sprewell, lost and caught in traffic on his way to Long Island, would not arrive until 20 minutes before tip-off.</p>
        <p>Jeff Van Gundy, their coach, was aware of it all, and after watching his club turn in an uninspired and mistake-laden performance in losing, 87-86, to the Wizards, he made the connection.</p>
        <p>''We're not moving towards winning,'' an incensed Van Gundy said after the Knicks shot 39 percent from the floor and were outrebounded by 45-32. ''We're moving towards losing. I don't like the way we're headed at all. Some of the guys we count on the most are ill-prepared for the season.</p>
        <p>''We've always taken pride, but we do a lot of foolish things right now,'' he added. ''That's my fault. Before we can be good on the floor, we have to get the right atmosphere. It's my fault. We're a foolish team right now, the way we're conducting ourselves.''</p>
        <p>Asked to be more specific, Van Gundy had no trouble running off a list of problems he had with his team, which is 5-2 heading into tonight's final preseason game at San Antonio.</p>
        <p>''The fourth-quarter execution is deplorable,'' he said. ''The shots we take down the stretch, temper tantrums on the floor, not knowing coverages, blown sets, you name it. Not being ready to play on back-to-back nights. Loose atmosphere. More worried about the darn World Series than about our own team. I'm not just talking about the players. I'm talking about me, too. It starts with me. It's a loose atmosphere. I have to coach better.''</p>
        <p>The players, whom Van Gundy castigated in the locker room after the game, took Van Gundy's tirade in stride. ''That's every time we lose,'' Camby said with a chuckle.</p>
        <p>While acknowledging that some of his concerns were justified, the Knicks said that ranting was simply Van Gundy's way of getting them motivated.</p>
        <p>''In my three years here, we've had worse preseasons and he didn't seem to be this upset,'' said Sprewell, who played better than anyone, scoring a game-high 23 points. ''But the coach's job is to get on us and keep us in our place.''</p>
        <p>Camby said: ''It's justifiably so. We've got guys coming in here not on time. Guys out there don't know the plays, and he's just getting fed up with it. He wants to nip it in the bud early, so it was good that he came in here and put the hammer down so we can move forward, especially with opening night around the corner.''</p>
        <p>After playing well in victories over Philadelphia and Milwaukee, the Knicks have seemingly regressed over the last three contests. They outrebounded four of their first five opponents, but have been beaten by a total of 21 rebounds in the last two games.</p>
        <p>And their offense has been characterized by outside shots and poor execution. The Knicks were horrible on the second night of back-to-back games last season, losing 13 of 19 games, and Wednesday's contest, which followed a victory Tuesday over the Nets, was their first such game of the preseason. Van Gundy was hoping he would not witness the type of meltdown that was commonplace last season.</p>
        <p>Johnson and Sprewell said they had found it hard to get motivated for preseason games, but insisted that come next Tuesday against Philadelphia, opening night, they would play with the fire, intensity and intelligence their coach was looking for.</p>
        <p>Van Gundy did not seem so sure. He stormed through the locker room after his speech to the news media, flinging shut the clubhouse door on his way out. Johnson, glimpsing at Van Gundy, smiled and conceded that the Knicks had been a bit preoccupied.</p>
        <p>''He's probably right about the loose atmosphere,'' Johnson said. ''Guys are worrying about the World Series, looking up at the scoreboard to find out the score, saying it's just the preseason, like myself. We'll be ready when it starts for real, though. But that man, Jeff, don't like to lose. Look at him -- slamming doors and stuff.''</p>
        <p>REBOUNDS</p>
        <p>The Knicks waived LAZARO BORRELL, trimming their roster to 15 players.</p>
