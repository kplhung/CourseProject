        <p>Representative Rick A. Lazio offered a broad indictment of the Clinton administration's foreign policy today, asserting that weakness and indecision by the White House over the last eight years had undermined the nation's credibility and contributed to increased turmoil in China, Russia and, most of all, the Middle East.</p>
        <p>With less than two weeks left in his campaign for Senate against Hillary Rodham Clinton, Mr. Lazio gave one of the most detailed speeches of his entire campaign, a tough-talking address that echoed the criticisms of the White House made by George W. Bush this year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio did not mention Mrs. Clinton once in his 29-minute speech. But while answering questions after his prepared address, at the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs at Syracuse University, he responded indirectly to the central argument of a foreign policy speech she gave last week: that the nation should play a more aggressive role in world affairs. ''The role of the American military is not to build nations; it is not to be the world's social worker,'' Mr. Lazio said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio's main target today was not his opponent, but her husband. He asserted that the president had inherited a stable world and dominant military when he took over the White House after 12 years of Republican rule, and had proceeded to squander ''this unique moment of opportunity.'' Mr. Lazio offered a region-by-region analysis of what he called foreign policy mistakes by Mr. Clinton, which he said had emboldened rogue nations, diluted the strength of the military and left allies unclear of the nation's foreign policy priorities.</p>
        <p>''When the current administration took office eight years ago, they inherited a world made safer by victory in the cold war and the unprecedented respect for, and deference to, American global leadership reflected by our victory in the gulf war,'' Mr. Lazio said. ''Today, after eight years of foreign policy by spin control, our credibility on the world stage is dissipated. When America speaks today, our friends don't believe us quite as much, and neither do our enemies.''</p>
        <p>In Mr. Lazio's speech here today and in the one Mrs. Clinton gave last week at the Council on Foreign Relations in Manhattan, the two candidates introduced an unusual coda to their contest to succeed Daniel Patrick Moynihan: foreign policy. The two speeches suggested the different ways Mr. Lazio and Mrs. Clinton might vote on foreign policy matters in the Senate and perhaps more significantly, how they would use the platform that comes from being a Senator from New York to advance their views on foreign affairs.</p>
        <p>That said, it is extremely unusual for a candidate to offer a major policy address this late in a campaign, but there were more practical political considerations in Mr. Lazio's decision to give a speech on this particular topic. In making such a weighty speech in such a solemn forum, Mr. Lazio sought to counter Mrs. Clinton's efforts to use the subject to reinforce doubts among voters about his experience and maturity.</p>
        <p>Indeed, Mr. Lazio seemed comfortable and in command, both in delivering the written speech and in answering questions from students and faculty, on issues ranging from the role of the United Nations (limited) to how much influence members of Congress should have on the nation's foreign policy (fairly extensive). He ran into difficulty only at one point, referring to the leader of North Korea as ''Kim Jong the Second.'' Mr. Lazio apparently misread the text, which correctly named the North Korean leader as Kim Jong Il.</p>
        <p>In addition, while Mr. Lazio was pointed and detailed in offering criticism of Mr. Clinton's policies, at times sounding very much like Mr. Bush, he was comparatively vague in offering his own proposals and did not stop to hold a news conference with reporters today to discuss the speech.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's spokesman, Howard Wolfson, sought to use the subject of foreign policy again today to raise questions about Mr. Lazio's credentials for the job, noting the preparations that Mr. Lazio had made for the speech. ''Last week Rick Lazio got a special foreign policy tutorial from Henry Kissinger,'' he said. ''Today, New Yorkers learned he should have stayed after class for extra help. Without anything original or positive to say, Rick Lazio was forced to continue hurling negatives and playing politics with foreign policy.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio's speech came on a day in which he attacked Mrs. Clinton's failed attempt to institute a national health care plan at a stop in Rochester this morning, and a day in which State Senator Mary Lou Rath introduced him at a women's luncheon in Buffalo with the famous campaign slogan used by Barry M. Goldwater, the conservative 1964 presidential candidate: ''In your heart, you know he's right.''</p>
        <p>Here in Syracuse, Mr. Lazio skipped around the globe in his speech and in the question-and-answer session, but spent the most time talking about the Middle East, an issue that has come up frequently in the Senate race. He said the United States should no longer seek to play the role of honest broker in Middle East negotiations, and that responsibility for the collapse of the peace process ''squarely lies'' with Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader. ''The time has come for the Clinton administration to stop playing honest broker and stand up for our friend Israel while she is under assault,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio suggested that the president had pushed too hard to force an agreement between Mr. Arafat and Ehud Barak, the Israeli prime minister, out of concern for his own legacy. ''The artificial time constraints of a presidential term may well have driven the parties toward an unsustainable agreement due to the emotional and complex nature of the issues involved,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio said the Clinton administration had erred in its dealing with Russia by putting too much focus on a single leader rather than maintaining contacts with other leaders. ''The current administration's policy of focusing on one leader -- whether it is Yeltsin or Putin -- is so misguided,'' he said. ''Ensuring Russia's Democratic future requires engaging and supporting not Russia's increasingly autocratic government, but Russian civil society.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio said Mr. Clinton had also had a ''lack of resolve'' in dealing with China and had failed to take a tough enough stand against China's human rights abuses. ''China must be made to understand that we want better relations -- that we want to engage them through trade and other means,'' he said. ''But they must also understand that use of force against Taiwan is a dead-end, and that Taiwan will have the means to defend itself, and the unwavering support of the United Sates, if Beijing tries.''</p>
        <p>Echoing a line of attack that Mr. Bush has used against Vice President Al Gore presidential race, he also said the nation's armed forces had been hurt by cuts in defense spending and by being deployed on what he said were too many ill-defined overseas missions. ''America is once again headed toward a hollow military: the readiness and morale of our troops is in steep decline.''</p>
