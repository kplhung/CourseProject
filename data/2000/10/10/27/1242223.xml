        <p>DaimlerChrysler A.G. said today that its third-quarter profit fell by 78 percent, and its executives said that the bad times might continue well into next year.</p>
        <p>As expected, the biggest reason for the decline was a loss of $512 million at the Chrysler Group in the United States, its first quarterly loss in nine years. Burdened with older models under intense competitive pressure, Chrysler sold 14 percent fewer cars in the third quarter than in the corresponding period a year earlier and tried, unsuccessfully, to preserve market share by offering billions of dollars in buying incentives.</p>
        <p>DaimlerChrysler warned last month that Chrysler would run a big loss and that profits, adjusted for one-time factors, would fall steeply.</p>
        <p>The company said its income, adjusted for one-time charges, fell to $289 million, or 29 cents a share, down from $1.3 billion, or $1.33 a share. It had been expected to earn 31 cents a share, according to six analysts polled by First Call/Thomson Financial. Sales rose 3 percent, to 37.2 billion euros ($30.2 billion).</p>
        <p>In a conference call with industry analysts today, Daimler executives cautioned that problems in the United States would not end quickly.</p>
        <p>''Tough market conditions in the U.S. are expected to intensify,'' said Jurgen Schrempp, the chief executive. He said Daimler would probably continue its heavy use of incentives until it revitalized more of Chrysler's models.</p>
        <p>In another ominous sign, Daimler wrote off $400 million from its leasing business in North America. That reflects the expectation that it will not be able to resell vehicles turned in at the end of leases for as much as it had originally calculated. Manfred Gentz, DaimlerChrysler's chief financial officer, said today that huge discounts offered to new-car buyers had depressed the value of used vehicles of the same Chrysler models.</p>
        <p>Some analysts say the industry faces a broader problem with leasing. The market for sport-utility vehicles is so glutted that their resale value could decline precipitously.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schrempp said Chrysler would earn a profit in the final three months of this year, but he predicted that its annual profit would be less than half as big as in 1999. Though the company has had big success with a few new vehicles, like the PT Cruiser, Daimler does not expect to complete the replacement of its current models until 2004.</p>
        <p>''We liked Chrysler two years ago, three years ago, because it was setting the game for the industry,'' said Albrecht Denninghoff, an automobile analyst at Hypovereinsbank A.G., in Munich. ''What we are seeing now is that Chrysler is passively reacting to the competition by starting a price war. We do not have the feeling that the management is setting the rules in the U.S. market.''</p>
        <p>In Frankfurt, Daimler shares, which have already fallen by more than 30 percent this year, slipped 0.58 euro, to 52 euros, today. Indeed, nearly two years after Mr. Schrempp orchestrated what was seen as a historic merger between Daimler-Benz, the manufacturer of Mercedes, and the Chrysler Corporation, the combined company now has a lower market capitalization than Daimler-Benz had on its own.</p>
        <p>A long list of top Chrysler executives have left, but analysts say the problems are only partly a result of management defections and the inevitable clashes among executives from different corporate cultures. They note that Daimler took control of Chrysler just as Chrysler was at a peak in its own cycle. But its competitors have swooped in on its markets, particularly sport utility vehicles, minivans and light trucks, and transformed Chrysler from the industry's most profitable car manufacturer to a big loser in just a few years.</p>
