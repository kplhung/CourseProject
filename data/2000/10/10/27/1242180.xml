        <p>Ben Brantley reviews Broadway stage version of The Full Monty, hearty singing adaptation of hit British film about motley male troupe of amateur strippers, here transplanted to Buffalo; photo of cast, led by Patrick Wilson; book is by Terrence McNally, music and lyrics by David Yazbek; Jack O'Brien directs (M)</p>

        <p>SO what do you want to know first? Do they really take off all their clothes? Yes. Can you see, you know, everything? No, at least not from where I was sitting.

        <p>''The Full Monty,'' the hearty singing adaptation of the popular English film about a motley male troupe of amateur strippers, opened last night in a blaze of pure mass appeal. The show calculatedly pushes as many buttons as an elevator operator, but it mercifully doesn't hammer at them. With a winning, ear-catching pop score by David Yazbek and a lively gallery of performers who seem truly in love with the people they're playing, ''The Full Monty'' is that rare aggressive crowd pleaser that you don't have to apologize for liking.</p>

        <p>SO what do you want to know first? Do they really take off all their clothes? Yes. Can you see, you know, everything? No, at least not from where I was sitting. And -- oops, almost forgot -- is it any good? Well, put it this way: the Eugene O'Neill Theater won't have to look for a new tenant for a long, long time.</p>
        <p>''The Full Monty,'' the hearty singing adaptation of the popular English film about a motley male troupe of amateur strippers, opened last night in a blaze of pure mass appeal. The show calculatedly pushes as many buttons as an elevator operator, but it mercifully doesn't hammer at them. With a winning, ear-catching pop score by David Yazbek and a lively gallery of performers who seem truly in love with the people they're playing, ''The Full Monty'' is that rare aggressive crowd pleaser that you don't have to apologize for liking.</p>
        <p>Well, for the most part, anyway. ''The Full Monty,'' which began life at the Old Globe Theater in San Diego, is leagues away from the classic New York musical, the sort of urbane, witty fare created by Rodgers and Hart, on the one hand, and Stephen Sondheim, on the other, and currently represented among nonrevivals only by ''Contact'' at Lincoln Center. The book, by the multiple Tony Award winner Terrence McNally, is sometimes as lame and pandering as a midseason replacement sitcom, especially in the first act.</p>
        <p>Fortunately ''The Full Monty'' has more to do than just talk. And as long as it lets its ideally cast ensemble translate blue-collar blues into vigorous song, it's hard not to sigh in appreciation and relief.</p>
        <p>Hokey, formulaic, vulgar, preachy: ''The Full Monty'' is all that, but it redeemingly tempers these traits with an honest affection. The warmth the evening gives off has less to do with the titillation of its central premise than with its enormous good will. And it makes other Broadway adaptations of hit movies -- ''Saturday Night Fever'' and the late, unlamented ''Footloose'' -- seem as blank and sterile as an unilluminated computer screen.</p>
        <p>There are so many ways the production could have gone wrong, too. The original British film of the same title, which was directed by Peter Cattaneo and became the Cinderella sleeper of 1997, was a shrewd variation on the classic mainstream rooting movie (''Breaking Away,'' ''Rocky,'' ''Chariots of Fire'') in which underdogs triumph in a mist of sweat and tears. (It was made under the aegis of Fox Searchlight Pictures, which is a producer here, along with its former president, Lindsay Law.)</p>
        <p>The revitalizing gimmick was undeniably catchy: having a group of unemployed steelworkers in the North of England come together to raise money by taking off their clothes in a one-night performance, emulating the touring Chippendales-style companies that have bewitched the town's working women. The story was simple, predictable and brazenly sentimental, kept this side of both bathos and slapstick by low-key, idiosyncratic performances.</p>
        <p>There was something nervous-making in the idea of transplanting the plot to Buffalo for an all-American musical, a form that demands that everything be big. Scaling up the film's tear-jerking and ribald qualities and substituting the rah-rah antics of Buffalo Bills fans for scrappy soccer enthusiasts seemed to be a sure recipe for shattering charm.</p>
        <p>The transformation is not without casualties. The characters in the musical are drawn more in crayon than in charcoal: they are baldly exaggerated types, defined by two or three large personality traits and no discernible interior life. And the pleas for tolerance -- for the identity crises of men out of work, for less-than-perfect bodies, for homosexuality (part of a late plot twist) -- that the movie kept sotto voce have been rendered by Mr. McNally with the equivalent of a rebel yell.</p>
        <p>Yet while ''The Full Monty'' may not be subtle, it isn't shameless. Jack O'Brien's direction is disarmingly relaxed. And if Mr. McNally's book occasionally condescends to its characters, the performers themselves (led by Patrick Wilson as the earnest organizer of the strippers) never do. The broad mugging and rim-shot delivery that would seem to be unavoidable are consistently avoided.</p>
        <p>The show is stocked with figures you would expect to be caricatures, from the prim executive and his shopaholic wife to the salty old retired club pianist who accompanies the men in their routine. Yet as embodied by Marcus Neville, Emily Skinner and Kathleen Freeman, respectively, these characters acquire a touching reality through judicious restraint. No one is pushing too hard.</p>
        <p>There is also, conspicuously, Andre De Shields who, for the duration of his one big solo, seems to own the whole island of Manhattan. But more on that later.</p>
        <p>The cast is immeasurably aided by Mr. Yazbek's score and lyrics, the success of which is the production's most refreshing surprise. Mr. Yazbek is a novice to the world of musicals, having worked mostly as a television script writer and a pop composer and performer. But he makes a much smoother transition to Broadway than more celebrated artists from the realm of pop, like Paul Simon (''The Capeman'') and Elton John (''Aida'').</p>
        <p>Mr. Yazbek's ambitions are not lofty. He isn't trying to reinvent the organic musical or to out-Sondheim Sondheim. His formula is to infuse variations on top-40 styles, from the 1950's to the present, with Broadway brassiness. This gives his songs an air of immediate accessibility, even recognizablity. But they aren't the blatant pastiches that the numbers in, say, ''Grease!'' are.</p>
        <p>Mr. Yazbek devilishly sends up the feel-good ''You've Got a Friend''-style anthem with a terrific number in which three men consider how they might assist one another in committing suicide. A homage to lost masculinity slyly incorporates the cowboy theme from those old Marlboro cigarette ads.</p>
        <p>There's a propulsive, percussive rock drive in the opening numbers that set up the opposing camps of the hapless men and the women who, for once in their lives, are in economic control. The lyrics traffic in outlandish rhymes with open, silly self-delight, using brand names, celebrity names and a steady flow of obscenities.</p>
        <p>The show is weakest on ballads, which tend to flow in a treacly stream that brings to mind B-sides of discs played on easy-listening stations. But Mr. Yazbek knows how to bring down a curtain with memory-grabbing melodies, nicely complemented by Jerry Mitchell's choreography, which cleverly addresses the problem of creating dances for men who aren't supposed to be able to dance. And there is a flexible variety in the assorted character-defining solos, like the ones performed with bright panache by Ms. Skinner and with deadpan panache by Ms. Freeman.</p>
        <p>John Arnone's neon-toned sets, suggesting a coloring-book version of the industrial cityscape from the movie ''Flashdance,'' provide a fittingly bright frame for the performers, who are, after all, the main attraction. In the central role of Jerry, the young father struggling to scrape together money for child support, Mr. Wilson gracefully plays straight man to the eccentricities of the others, and he sings with shimmering sincerity. (His voice seems to emanate from his gleaming white teeth.)</p>
        <p>Jason Danieley and Romain Fruge are delightful as the loopiest of the strippers, who discover a common affinity for ''The Sound of Music.'' John Ellison Conlee is understated and touching as the group's token fat man, and Annie Golden matches him as his patient wife. The protean Ms. Skinner, seen to very different effect in ''Sideshow'' and ''James Joyce's 'The Dead,' '' here suggests a delicious hybrid of Nanette Fabray and Vivian Vance. But none of the performers strike false notes, even when the script does.</p>
        <p>There is also the formidable Mr. De Shields, who achieved fame on Broadway as a member of the top-drawer ensemble in the Fats Waller revue ''Ain't Misbehavin'.'' His character, nicknamed Horse, first shows up for an audition for the strip act. Arthritically gnarled, with the beaten, resigned expression of a man who expects nothing to go his way, Horse is not on the surface promising showbiz material.</p>
        <p>But by degrees the old fellow unbends, thawing into pantherine agility with a resonant voice that growls, twangs and purrs. His number, called ''Big Black Man,'' is a spirited sendup of and salute to James Brown. Watching Mr. De Shields perform it brings to mind those providential thrills occasionally afforded by karaoke bars, when some lumpy sad sack takes the mike and lets loose with the sound of a Sinatra or a Streisand.</p>
        <p>A loser becomes, for just a few minutes, a winner. That's the transformation that ''The Full Monty'' trades on, frankly and unpretentiously. Even those who go expecting to sneer are likely to be surprised by the smiles that keep sneaking onto their faces.</p>
