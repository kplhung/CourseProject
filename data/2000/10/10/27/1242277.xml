        <p>A remake of the ''Daisy'' commercial -- perhaps the most infamous of all political attack advertisements -- is being shown in several states today, but the target this time is Vice President Al Gore, not Barry Goldwater.</p>
        <p>The commercial contends that because the Clinton-Gore administration ''sold'' the nation's security ''to Communist Red China in exchange for campaign contributions,'' China has ''the ability to threaten our homes with long-range nuclear warheads.''</p>
        <p>It then shows a girl, counting down as she plucks daisy petals. Her counting is then replaced by a countdown of a missile, which is  followed by a nuclear bomb explosion.</p>
        <p>''Don't take a chance. Please vote Republican,'' then appears on the screen.</p>
        <p>The commercial is a copy of one that was made for President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964. The commercial created such a furor -- with its tacit suggestion that Mr. Goldwater's views were so extreme that they would lead to nuclear annihilation -- that it was withdrawn after appearing only once. But it has been remembered for decades.</p>
        <p>A Texas-based nonprofit organization, Aretino Industries, paid for the new commercial, which will run in several closely contested states, including Ohio, Michigan, Missouri and Pennsylvania.</p>
        <p>Carey Cramer, a spokesman for the organization, in McAllen, Tex.,  declined to identify any of its members or the source of its money.</p>
        <p>''These are people with real life jobs and they don't want to lose their jobs,'' said Mr. Cramer, who said the group was formed to produce political commercials in this campaign and to bring ''accountability'' to politics.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cramer said the initial advertisement buy was for $60,000, which is considered small by current political standards. He said that the group has raised $500,000 to buy more time.</p>
        <p>''It's an ad that is so inflammatory that it gets free news access,'' said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, dean of the Annenberg School of Communication.</p>
        <p>''This is a heavy-handed ad,'' Ms. Jamieson said. ''It lacks the subtlety of the original ad, it is not factually accurate and, if anything, it risks that the press coverage over it will produce a backlash against the Bush campaign.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Jamieson said that in the closing days of a political campaign it was not unusual to see such groups make small advertisement  buys with highly charged advertisements to gain attention.</p>
        <p>''You have these rogue groups, which have no disclosure obligation, go on the air with ads that can inadvertently hurt the candidates they are trying to help,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Tony Schwartz, the retired advertising executive who made the original ''Daisy'' advertisement, said of this new version: ''This troubles me. They are a bunch of thieves. It's a perversion of my ad.''</p>
