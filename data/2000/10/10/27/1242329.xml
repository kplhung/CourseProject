        <p>David Zwirner  43 Greene Street, SoHo  Through Nov. 18</p>
        <p>Enough is never enough for Jason Rhoades. The still youngish Los Angeles-based sculptor is famous for his absurdly excessive installations of machinery, food, furniture, tools, automotive equipment and electronics illustrating sophomorically grandiose ideas.</p>
        <p>By his own standards, Mr. Rhoades's current show is relatively contained, but it is, as his work usually is, about as impressive as it is annoying in its calculated extravagance. Using polished aluminum pipes and clamps salvaged from an immense installation called ''Perfect World,'' created in Hamburg last year, Mr. Rhoades has produced a partly sculptural, partly live performance work loosely based on Sutter's Mill, where the California gold rush began.</p>
        <p>A giant Tinkertoy-like model of a sawmill made of the fat, shiny pipes stand is in one room; it has a peaked roof, a water wheel and a cartoonish, sheetmetal saw. Another room holds an identical but incomplete version of the mill. During the exhibition, an assistant will always be building up or taking down one or the other mill, acting out an endless Sisyphean loop of construction and deconstruction, mirroring the constant state of flux that is modernity.</p>
        <p>The show has other elements -- wooden pipe racks, scattered laundry, slowly morphing photographs on laptop screens, a large Mephisto shoe box and an all-marble version of the same -- but it is the mill and its recycling that make the biggest impression. Sutter's Mill as a metaphor is not especially rich, but it does give Mr. Rhoades's avant-garde theater a certain all-American resonance.</p>
