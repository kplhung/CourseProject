        <p>Mexican Class</p>
        <p>Once dominated by Tex-Mex margarita mills and Cal-Mex burrito bars, the city's Mexican restaurants are evolving into more authentic expressions of regional cooking. These 12 restaurants show what has changed. (These summaries are taken from dining reviews, columns and articles in The Times by William Grimes, Eric Asimov and others.)</p>
        <p>1. Casa Mexicana</p>
        <p>+</p>

        <p>$ All major cards</p>
        <p>This may be the first Mexican restaurant in New York that owes as much to downtown Manhattan as it does to Mexico City. Casa Mexicana also owes something to Paris because  its chef, Luis Herrera, uses French techniques he learned at the Culinary Institute of America. The most surprising thing about the menu is how little it resembles the usual array of Mexican street foods. The 13 main courses include four steak dishes, a vegetarian plate, duck breast, sea bass, halibut and scallops, along with a couple of chicken dishes and a single pork dish.</p>

        <p>2. Los Dos Rancheros Mexicanos</p>
        <p>++</p>
        <p>(212) 868-7780</p>
        <p>507 Ninth Avenue, at 38th Street</p>
        <p>Clinton</p>
        <p>$ Cash only</p>
        <p>The dining room may be bare-bones, but the restaurant serves authentic, delicious Mexican fare. Pipian con pollo, tender pieces of chicken in a spicy green sauce made with tomatillos, chilies and toasted pumpkin seeds, is notable for the vivid flavors that seem to ricochet from one end of the mouth to the other, while pollo con mole poblano offers this more familiar sauce at its chocolatey, smoky best.</p>
        <p>3. Gabriela's</p>
        <p>+</p>
        <p>(212) 961-0574</p>
        <p>685 Amsterdam Avenue, at 93rd Street</p>
        <p>Manhattan</p>
        <p>$ All major cards</p>
        <p>The authentic Mexican regional fare belies the 1970's suburban diner decor at this bustling corner spot. The best dishes include taquitos al pastor, tiny corn tortillas topped with vinegary roast pork, pineapple salsa and cilantro; soft tacos with fillings like spicy chorizo, crisp fried pork skins simmered in green sauce and fibrous beef tongue, and a green salad with nopales, tender slices of baby cactus. Pozole, the traditional Mexican soup made with hominy, is a meal in itself, served in a huge bowl with chunks of pork or chicken and spiced with chilies. For a great buy, try the Yucatan-style rotisserie chicken.</p>
        <p>4. Hell's Kitchen</p>
        <p>+</p>
        <p>(212) 977-1588</p>
        <p>679 Ninth Avenue, near 47th Street</p>
        <p>Clinton</p>
        <p>$ All major cards</p>
        <p>Sue Torres specializes in creatively using Mexican flavorings and cooking techniques. At Hell's Kitchen, she has added ingredients and dishes from the global palette of contemporary American cooking and included a few throw-ins to satisfy a neighborhood clientele that may not be interested in experimenting. Among her exceptional dishes are an appetizer of tuna tostadas infused with coriander, seared and then placed on crunchy corn tortillas with guacamole and pineapple, a most harmonious combination. Ms. Torres devotes part of her menu to quesadillas, house-made flour tortillas layered with cheese and other fillings. In size, they approximate small main courses; in spirit, they succeed because they retain a clearly Mexican identity even with creative enhancements. Main courses are inconsistent, but desserts are exceptional.</p>
        <p>5. Maya</p>
        <p>** [Rating: 2 stars]</p>
        <p>(212) 585-1818</p>
        <p>1191 First Avenue, at 65th Street</p>
        <p>Manhattan</p>
        <p>$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>Richard Sandoval, chef and owner, has put his heart into Maya with the intention of showcasing the food of his native Mexico. While Maya is attractive and colorful, the food is what's most memorable, with unusual dishes like roasted corn soup with a dumpling made of huitlacoche, a corn fungus that is a time-honored Mexican ingredient, and seafood salad, a blend of watercress, cilantro and cactus leaves tossed with grilled shrimp, scallops and calamari rings in a Serrano-chili-and-apple vinaigrette. Even a familiar selection like chili relleno is given a twist: Mr. Sandoval stuffs his with seafood and cheese. Chicken in a mole poblano sauce is truly complex, while pipian de puerco, grilled pork in a pumpkin seed sauce, is also satisfying.</p>
        <p>6. Mexicana Mama</p>
        <p>+</p>
        <p>(212) 924-4119</p>
        <p>525 Hudson Street, near West 10th Street</p>
        <p>West Village</p>
        <p>$ Cash only</p>
        <p>This small, colorful restaurant offers a short menu of dishes that don't register high on a scale of authenticity but succeed in a more important measure: they taste good. The chef, Julietta Ballesteros, applies Gallic techniques to her dishes while allowing the classic flavors of corn, chilies and beans to shine through. She braises beef brisket, then cooks it slowly in a corn husk until it is fall-apart tender like pot roast and serves it with rice and excellent refried black beans. Her pollo con mole is made with a boneless chicken breast that is surprisingly juicy, with a terrific reddish-brown mole made with sesame seeds, chocolate and just enough chili heat to balance the sweetness of the chocolate. The restaurant's corn tortillas are fabulous. For dessert, vanilla flan served with impossibly rich cajeta, a caramel sauce made with goat's milk, is wonderful.</p>
        <p>7. Mi Cocina</p>
        <p>** [Rating: 2 stars]</p>
        <p>(212) 627-8273</p>
        <p>57 Jane Street, at Hudson Street</p>
        <p>West Village</p>
        <p>$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>The food at this colorful mom-and-pop restaurant is deeply flavored and deceptive, with complex dishes constructed from the simple building blocks of corn, chilies and tomato. Appetizers are excellent, including sauteed shrimp in a spicy adobo sauce, and a delicate corn tamale stuffed with guajillo chili sauce and white cheese. Even the fresh corn chips are wonderful, with salsas made of boiled tomatillos and roasted tomatoes. Main courses include cochinita pibil (shredded pork seasoned with achiote and sour orange and cooked in banana leaves) and terrific enchiladas.</p>
        <p>8. Rocking Horse</p>
        <p>+</p>
        <p>(212) 463-9511</p>
        <p>182 Eighth Avenue, near 19th Street</p>
        <p>Chelsea</p>
        <p>$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>This bright, crowded little restaurant serves the usual guacamole, frozen margaritas and huge baskets of chips, but if you look beyond the familiar items, you'll find some of the most exciting Mexican food in the city. The menu, which changes regularly, has included fabulous appetizers like confit of free-range duck in blue corn-epazote. Among main courses, double-rib pork chop mixiote, braised in dark beer and served in a spicy chili sauce with sweet plantain puree, is a marvelous dish. The pork is falling-off-the-bone tender and  moist. The current menu also includes chiltepe chile-glazed tuna with mushroom-barley risotto and pasilla chile sauce; and chorizo-stuffed poussin.</p>
        <p>9. Taco Taco</p>
        <p>+</p>
        <p>(212) 289-8226</p>
        <p>1726 Second Avenue, near 90th Street</p>
        <p>Yorkville</p>
        <p>$ Cash only</p>
        <p>Every neighborhood should have a restaurant like Taco Taco, where the atmosphere is casual and pleasant but the food is serious. Tacos, naturally, are a mainstay of the menu, with fillings like pork with sauteed cabbage, tongue and crumbled chorizo. More ambitious specialties include strips of tender pork marinated with smoky chipotle chilies and grilled, and pork chops pounded thin, marinated with lime, garlic and chilies, and grilled. Crisp, greaseless taquitos are the best appetizer. Soft tortillas are stuffed with chorizo and mashed potato, then deep-fried and topped with chunky guacamole. Nachos with black beans are neat and compact.</p>
        <p>10. Taqueria de Mexico</p>
        <p>+</p>
        <p>(212) 255-5212</p>
        <p>93 Greenwich Avenue, near West 12th Street</p>
        <p>West Village</p>
        <p>$ All major cards</p>
        <p>This handsome little taqueria is owned by Jose Hurtado-Prud'homme and Marzena Hurtado, who also own Mi Cocina. At first their meticulous care was devoted to Mexican street food like tacos and taquitos al pastor, which are particularly tasty. This appetizer -- small, fragrant corn tortillas filled with pork, cilantro and onions and topped with a wedge of pineapple -- is so good you want to make a meal of it. Slowly, though, the restaurant is enlarging its repertory, and it now serves more complex dishes like sauteed shrimp with cactus pads and grilled chicken with tequila vinaigrette. Fajitas and burritos are also solid choices.</p>
        <p>11. Tequilita's</p>
        <p>+</p>
        <p>(718) 492-4303</p>
        <p>5213 Fourth Avenue, near 53rd Street</p>
        <p>Sunset Park</p>
        <p>Brooklyn</p>
        <p>$ Cash only</p>
        <p>Sunset Park has a growing Mexican population, and Tequilita's, a cheerful little storefront, is one of the better taquerias in the neighborhood. The pozole is terrific, thick with hominy and pork, and the tacos are superb, with several unusual choices, like chewy pig's ears and blood sausage. Chicken enchiladas are served with a spicy, subtle mole sauce, and flautas are crisp and greaseless.</p>
        <p>12. Zarela</p>
        <p>+++</p>
        <p>(212) 644-6740</p>
        <p>953 Second Avenue, near 51st Street</p>
        <p>Manhattan</p>
        <p>$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>The fiesta at festive Zarela has been going for more than a decade with no sign of letting up. Favorite dishes include a fiery snapper hash, crisp flautas, tamales and fajitas. Several side dishes are considered essential, like creamy rice baked with sour cream, cheddar cheese, corn and poblano chilies; and pozole guisado, in which hominy kernels are sauteed with tomatoes, onions, garlic and jalapeno peppers.</p>
