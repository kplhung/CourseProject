        <p>He still wears the uniform: leather boots, leather jacket and a dark T-shirt. He is twitchy, he grooms his sideburns and he smokes a lot.</p>
        <p>Steve Fine is a dot-com guy without a dot-com and he'll accept a free drink. He is sitting in a bar on the Lower East Side in the middle of the afternoon pulling stolen software from his bag.</p>
        <p>''This is it,'' he says to the bartender. ''This is my severance package.''</p>
        <p>''How's your job hunt going, Steve?'' she asks. She serves a lot of out-of-work new economy types these days.</p>
        <p>''Not as good as I thought,'' he says. ''But I've got my unemployment check, $308 a week, and I've got five and a half months left to find one.''</p>
        <p>He drains his free beer and orders another.</p>
        <p>Steve Fine is a 30-year-old who has become a has-been before he ever became anything, on the unemployment line with 290,000 stock options worth nothing.</p>
        <p>He was the art director for pseudo.com, one of the most flamboyant addresses on the World Wide Web. The company closed operations in mid-September after spending millions of dollars without earning a nickel.</p>
        <p>Pink slips are blowing through Silicon Alley these days. According to industry trade sites, there have been about 3,000 reported layoffs at Manhattan technology companies since the beginning of September. Pseudo Programs, with 175 layoffs,  is by no means the largest of these companies to go under, but its crash has gotten a good amount of press coverage, since its acolytes had crowed so loudly and flown so high.</p>
        <p>Building a sort of online television network of video channels, its employees used to boast that they would destroy television as we knew it. Six years later, the networks are still here and Pseudo is nothing more than a memory of a brash company gone bad.</p>
        <p>It is 5 o'clock in the afternoon and the bar is filled with unemployed techies who listen as Mr. Fine retraces his rise and fall, from working stiff to master of the new technocratic universe -- and back.</p>
        <p>He grew up in Scotch Plains, N.J., a middle-class community where, he said, Italians lived on one side of the tracks and blacks on the other. Steve Fine called himself Steve D'Fino to anyone who did not know him, because being a Jew meant getting your head kicked in, he said.</p>
        <p>His father, an industrial roofer and asbestos remover, went by D'Fino too. ''There was more work that way,'' Mr. Fine said. It was a solid, middle-of-the-road childhood. There was a Cadillac in the driveway, but it was always aging and Steve Fine wanted out.</p>
        <p>''I always thought there had to be more to life than an old car and physical labor,'' he says.</p>
        <p>There was. It wasn't wealth, exactly; Mr. Fine never earned more than $70,000 a year at Pseudo. But in the new economy, a lot of money wasn't an essential for feeling rich. There were the trappings. In 1995, he began working in a hip 10,000-square-foot loft at Broadway and Houston Street, and spent time watching the European women walk by. Those women once would have laughed at him. Now they wanted to party.</p>
        <p>Wealth was a state of mind, Mr. Fine said. The dot-com sons and daughters of middle managers -- once dropouts and misfits and nerds -- were suddenly at the epicenter of a limitless technology. It was a job in which you didn't really have to work. You surfed the Net. In the office, there was the electronic water pipe that five people could smoke at once.  The scent was of marijuana, not the must of yellowing books. It was the way out of their fathers' 9-to-5 work world. Then there were those options that would be worth millions when some witless investor took the bait.</p>
        <p>''We really thought we were going to make it,'' says David Mulkey, an ex-lighting specialist who earned $40,000 at Pseudo and who now plays music in the subways. ''We were making art, we thought. And we were escaping the middle class.''</p>
        <p>''It was an amazing time,'' Mr. Fine remembers. ''Geeks got girls and people thought we were a club.''</p>
        <p>For the first few years, Mr. Fine did work hard, more than 80 hours a week, he says. He had, after all, been raised with his father's work ethic. And he believed the work he was doing was important. His job was to design the Web pages for the different channels, design the promotional materials and logos and eventually to manage the mess that went with an out-of-control staff.</p>
        <p>Employees smoked marijuana for lunch and snorted cocaine for supper. They slept under their desks. ''It was wild and the Wall Street suits would come to the parties and get high and write us a check in the morning,'' Mr. Fine says between beers, a hint of pride still lingering in his voice. ''We ate from the trough of the venture capitalist pigs.''</p>
        <p>Pseudo had started as an online radio station in 1994 before expanding to video, featuring boutique channels of hip-hop, punk rock and counterculture programming. It was one of the first Silicon Alley darlings and perhaps better known in the early days for its Warholesque parties, which were often held in the loft of Pseudo's founder, Joshua Harris.</p>
        <p>''CBS is our competition,'' Mr. Harris once boasted on television.</p>
        <p>Now, in the bar, the chalkboard reads: ''Quit your dot.com!''</p>
        <p>''No reason to quit,'' Mr. Fine says. ''Nobody has a job.''</p>
        <p>Back in his school days, Mr. Fine was a misanthrope who wore a green Mohawk and drank 151-proof rum at the local amusement park. Italian or not, he still got beaten up and the girls made fun of him. He dropped out his junior year but earned his equivalency diploma. He went on to art school and came out thinking he was going to be a famous painter.</p>
        <p>But no one was hiring famous painters at the time and he settled for working in a bookstore and then as a receptionist at an audiovisual company. He taught himself computer graphics there and went on to design T-shirts.</p>
        <p>''Then in '94 I met a guy at a party,'' he says. ''He told me about this joint called Pseudo.''</p>
        <p>With 300 employees, many of whom sat around doing little more than downloading pornography, the company ran through $18 million in 1999; it received $14 million more in  May. Investors wanted to see some action. David Bohrman, the former head of CNNfn, a financial news network, was hired to run Pseudo. The suits arrived and things changed.</p>
        <p>''It wasn't a freak scene anymore,'' Mr. Fine said. ''The parties faded away and the regular work world took over. In a way it's a relief that I don't work there anymore.''</p>
        <p>The use of drugs in the office was banned. The content was paired down into a one-channel, talk-show format. Pseudo spent a lot of money covering the political conventions in a grandstanding ploy to find new investors. Few tuned in.</p>
        <p>''Why would they?'' Mr. Fine asked. ''Cable does it better.''</p>
        <p>By the end, Mr. Fine was doing a whole lot of nothing. He was smart enough, however, to put a few thousand dollars in the bank. His savings plus his unemployment checks allow him to make rent, drink in the afternoons and wander the streets of Manhattan with his hands in his pockets mulling over his prospects.</p>
        <p>''It's over,'' he says. ''Now I'm crawling back to the corporate dog bowl.''</p>
        <p>A woman with two-tone hair walks into the bar. She, too, is an old Pseudo hand. She is an Internet consultant now. She ''puts people together.'' Steve Fine hands her his resume.</p>
        <p>He tells her he wants to start his own design firm. Then he regresses into talk about the Web and video-streaming technology. In the next breath he says he is a failure. And then it is dreams about a dog farm in Iceland. Then a farm upstate. He's shellshocked.</p>
        <p>''I'm just down on myself and the whole thing,'' he tells the woman  through cigarette smoke. ''I would have been an architect if I was smart.''</p>
