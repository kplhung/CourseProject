        <p>Peer down the list of job titles and responsibilities for pro football coaches and the glory jobs rank this way: first and foremost, head coach, followed by offensive and defensive coordinator. Among the rest, quarterbacks coach has a nice ring to it. Even special-teams coaches have gained the spotlight in recent years.</p>
        <p>Few coaches, however, enjoy tutoring the scout team.</p>
        <p>Usually that job is given to an assistant coach who already works in a specific area but is asked to take his team's backups, simulate the opponent with that group and then offer them as fodder for the first-team offense and defense. It is an important job, but often a thankless one. It is grunt work.</p>
        <p>Guess who coaches the scout team for the 7-0 Minnesota Vikings?</p>
        <p>''I do,'' the Vikings' head coach, Dennis Green, said. ''It is my job to give our first-team offense and defense the best look I can at what they will see each week. This week, I'm doing everything I can to make the scout teams look like Tampa Bay.</p>
        <p>''I guess when you're the head coach and you can have any job you want during the week the question is why would you choose to coach the scout team? It's hard work, but I love it. It's great for our team.''</p>
        <p>For a variety of reasons.</p>
        <p>Green shows the rest of his coaches and players he is willing to get his hands dirty. It helps him keep a finger on the pulse of his entire team. And this way he gains a chance to coach, to teach, to improve his younger players from the bottom up.</p>
        <p>Little wonder that Green had an unusual feel for quarterback Daunte Culpepper, who in his second pro season, after taking four snaps last year, has helped the Vikings remain the league's only unbeaten team.</p>
        <p>Green has had seven starting quarterbacks in his nine seasons in Minnesota, but the offensive system -- power running mixed with a deep-strike vertical passing game mixed with trinkets of the West Coast offense -- has remained intact. Culpepper is the newest leader but is in a special class, a hybrid quarterback (6 feet 4 inches, 250 pounds) who can run it, throw it, wing it.</p>
        <p>Green coaches outside the box. When others thought he had blown it by letting the quarterbacks Randall Cunningham and Jeff George go and then when he courted Dan Marino, Green had seen enough of Culpepper during the scout team workouts to know that he was capable.</p>
        <p>Cunningham left because he would not accept a pay cut. George gained a better deal with Washington. Marino balked and retired. It looked as if Green was simply left with Culpepper as his starter. He says no.</p>
        <p>''We drafted Daunte last year and had him rated the No. 1 player in the draft,'' Green said. ''If we had had the first pick in the draft, we would have taken Daunte over Tim Couch and all of the other quarterbacks. What I was trying to do with Marino was give him and us an opportunity; I have always done that and that was how we wound up with Randall and Jeff in the first place.</p>
        <p>''If Randall and Jeff had come back, Daunte would have competed with them for the starting job. If Marino had come here, he would have been the starter and Daunte would have had a second year to learn.</p>
        <p>''During the off-season, I talked with Daunte about it each step of the way. He kept telling me, 'Coach, I'm ready.' He said that when we drafted him, but I insisted on him sitting a year, watching and learning. Daunte might have been ready last year. He has shown that he is ready now.''</p>
        <p>In spectacular fashion.</p>
        <p>Culpepper has 14 touchdown passes and 7 interceptions. He has thrown for nearly 1,700 yards. He is an accurate passer. His mobility and powerful running are remarkable for a quarterback, and he has rushed for four touchdowns and averaged 4.9 yards a rush. He will look for more when Minnesota plays the Buccaneers at Tampa Bay (3-4) on Sunday.</p>
        <p>Receiver Cris Carter told Green during the off-season that he did not believe Culpepper was ready to start. Others around the Vikings said the same to Green. But Green knew that with Sherman Lewis as his new offensive coordinator he had a quarterback coaching messiah. He knew that with Carter, receiver Randy Moss and running back Robert Smith, Culpepper simply had to mesh, not shoulder the entire offense.</p>
        <p>''I had to show the coaches and the players that I was ready and I had to gain their respect,'' Culpepper said. ''I wasn't overwhelmed about the process because I knew that they had drafted me here as a first-round pick and my time would come sooner or later. I respect Coach Green for his belief in me; he is such a motivator, because just when he speaks at our 9 a.m. meetings, I'm ready after that to go play a real game and dominate somebody. Coach Green always tells me to just drive the car.''</p>
        <p>Not switch the tires. Not change the engine.</p>
        <p>Green was ripped last year for passing over defensive end Jevon Kearse in the draft (he went to Tennessee). Of course, 14 other teams did, too, but few of them drafted the quantity that is Culpepper.</p>
        <p>Green ranked Moss the No. 1 player in the 1998 draft and then Culpepper last year. Culpepper to Moss can be a staple for many years, or as Green puts it, ''eat the league alive.''</p>
        <p>Through seven games, that is what the Vikings have done.</p>
        <p>''We want to be 8-0,'' Green said. ''We've got a good group here in terms of their passion and chemistry, and that includes the coaching staff. We go with our history and our ability to put together a winning team. Some people are afraid in pro football to be independent in their thought process. I am not.''</p>
