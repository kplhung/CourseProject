        <p>Shawn Core and Retina Massey-Core, newlyweds from Athens, Tex., were shopping for their first car -- a Valentine's Day gift for each other -- when they found a used Lincoln Town Car at a local Ford Lincoln Mercury dealer in 1995. With no established credit history, they were grateful when the dealer declared that they had been approved for a car loan by the Ford Motor Credit Company.</p>
        <p>Ford agreed to finance the Cores' car at 14 percent. But that is not the rate they were told they got. Without their knowledge, Ford permitted the local dealer to add on two and a half percentage points. This increased the Cores' total finance charges by $466, which Ford immediately paid to the dealer.</p>
        <p>This industrywide but obscure practice is called the dealer markup. In today's increasingly transparent world of consumer credit, it is an anomaly, almost a throwback to an earlier era.</p>
        <p>Over several decades, laws and federal actions have pried open the credit process. Under fair housing laws, for example, all points and commissions must be specifically disclosed. More recently, banks and other major lenders have spend millions of dollars on credit systems that screen out subjective bias.</p>
        <p>But there is no legal requirement that car dealers or lenders must tell consumers about the role dealers play in setting the interest rate on dealer-arranged car loans. At the dealership, the ultimate decision about a loan's cost is left to the discretion of an employee who profits immediately by charging the highest possible rate, even though the dealer has no money at risk.</p>
        <p>Now this markup practice is coming under legal attack in at least five states, a joint investigation by The New York Times and ABC News ''20/20'' has found.</p>
        <p>The Cores are plaintiffs in one of two class-action lawsuits in Texas state court seeking to have the markup declared a fraudulent and deceptive business practice. ''If they're going to make money off the loan, then they need to tell people,'' said Mrs. Core in a recent interview.</p>
        <p>A similar class-action case has been filed in California, said Jack E. McGehee of Houston, one of the lawyers working on the cases. In New Jersey, lawyers are seeking permission to expand an earlier individual case against Chase Manhattan into a class action. Litigation is also being prepared in Pennsylvania, he said.</p>
        <p>''We're saying that this is a huge lie,'' Mr. McGehee said.</p>
        <p>The dealers and lenders named as defendants in those cases, which include the Bank of America and the Ford Motor Credit Company, described dealer markup as a legitimate business practice that in no way misleads or defrauds consumers. Texas courts have affirmed this position in the past, they noted.</p>
        <p>Dealer markups are also under attack in class-action cases pending in Nashville against the General Motors Acceptance Corporation and the Nissan Motor Acceptance Corporation, two of the nation's most prominent auto finance companies.</p>
        <p>Those lawsuits, filed under seal two years ago and recently made public, accuse the lenders of participating in arrangements that have resulted in black car buyers being charged higher dealer markups than whites, on average, regardless of creditworthiness.</p>
        <p>''There's two problems from a consumer perspective with dealer markup,'' said Gary Klein, a lawyer with the National Consumer Law Center in Boston, which is helping plaintiffs in the Nashville cases. ''The first is that it's secret. The second is that there's discrimination: blacks are typically charged more than whites in markup.''</p>
        <p>General Motors Acceptance, Nissan Motor Acceptance and the local auto dealers involved in the cases deny any discriminatory practices and say the plaintiffs' claims rest on flawed statistical analysis.</p>
        <p>Car financing is an enormous business. In 1998, the most recent year for which the Federal Reserve has figures, there were more than $450 billion in car loans outstanding in America. This year, according to industry surveys, about half of the 17.7 million new vehicles expected to be sold will be financed. More than 75 percent of those loans will be arranged through car dealerships.</p>
        <p>Industry experts say that the money dealers make on markups -- part of what dealers call ''finance and insurance'' income -- can make the difference between profit and loss for many dealerships.</p>
        <p>The National Automobile Dealers Association and the American Financial Services Association, which represents lenders, say that markups compensate dealers for the expense involved in offering consumers the convenience of dealer-arranged financing.</p>
        <p>Besides providing one-stop shopping for credit, dealer-arranged loans also give consumers access to more sources of credit than they would have on their own, especially if they have a poor credit history, these industry groups say. And they assert that the competition among lenders for each dealer's loan business keeps rates low even after dealers have added their ''retail markup.''</p>
        <p>Lenders and dealers say that consumers who know their creditworthiness and the rates available from other sources can negotiate an excellent dealer-arranged car loan.</p>
        <p>But consumer advocates dispute that, noting it is almost impossible, short of litigation, for consumers to find out the rates at which lenders approved them for dealer-arranged credit.</p>
        <p>''If the dealers honestly think that this is a service that customers are willing to pay for, then let them tell the customers what they're charging for it,'' suggested Kathleen Keest, Iowa's assistant attorney general for consumer protection and the former chairwoman of the National Association of Consumer Advocates.</p>
        <p>''I would very much doubt many people will think that it was a service worth three percentage points, or five, or even more,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The Mechanics of the Buy Rate</p>
        <p>With his strawberry-blond hair and blue eyes, Scott Zajaczkowski looks like a well-scrubbed choirboy. His earnest demeanor and college polish helped him succeed as a car salesman in the suburbs of Cleveland. ''People trusted me.  I'm an honest person, and I like to help people,'' said Mr. Zajaczkowski (pronounced Zage-ah-COW-ski).</p>
        <p>But in the months after he was promoted to finance and insurance manager at his dealership, he became uncomfortable with his new role.</p>
        <p>He said he was trained to persuade customers to pay the highest interest rates possible on dealer-arranged loans and to discourage them from paying cash or financing their car elsewhere. He was also expected to push other high-priced financial products, like extended service warranties and credit insurance policies that would pay off consumers' car loans if they died, he recalled.</p>
        <p>After about 18 months, Mr. Zajaczkowski resigned. ''I felt I was scamming people,'' he said. ''I was so depressed.''</p>
        <p>His former dealership is now under new management, and executives there declined to comment on his remarks.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zajaczkowski's reaction to his work is hardly typical, though. The finance and insurance manager -- or F &amp; I manager, in dealer parlance -- is usually one of a car dealership's highest-paid employees, earning commission-based incomes of $100,000 or more a year, Mr. Zajaczkowski said.</p>
        <p>Those paychecks reflect how important these ''back end'' products -- warranties, insurance and the loan markups -- are to dealer profits.</p>
        <p>''We were expected to average $400 to $500 on all transactions, which includes leases and deals that you can't mark up because of special promotions,'' Mr. Zajaczkowski said. ''So many are much, much more.''</p>
        <p>In his experience, he said, a customer's credit rating was entirely irrelevant to the size of the interest rate markup.</p>
        <p>Dealers arrange car loans by collecting credit information from the customer and submitting it, by fax or e-mail, to one or more lenders -- major banks, the finance arms of major automakers, even local credit unions. The lenders analyze the customer's credit history and arrive at a minimum interest rate, called the buy rate, at which they would be willing to finance the purchase.</p>
        <p>If the dealer quotes that minimum rate to the customer, and the customer accepts it, the dealer immediately sells or ''assigns'' that loan to the lender, which will typically pay him a small flat fee, between $50 and $150, for arranging the paperwork.</p>
        <p>If possible, however, the dealer will quote a higher interest rate to the customer. If the customer accepts it, the dealer sells the loan to the lender and collects, from the lender, all or most of the cash value of the difference between the buy rate and the higher rate set by the dealer.</p>
        <p>Some lenders, including Nissan, limit the number of percentage points a dealer can add to the loans they finance; other lenders, including G.M.A.C., will buy loans even if the dealer markup exceeds the fixed limit -- but will keep a share of the higher markup themselves.</p>
        <p>Some lenders, bidding aggressively for a dealer's business, may impose no limit on markups at all. In those cases, finance managers ''can charge whatever rate they want,'' Mr. Zajaczkowski said. ''There's no rhyme or reason.''</p>
        <p>David Robertson is the founder and executive director of the Association of Finance and Insurance Professionals, a trade association for finance managers. He sees their role very differently.</p>
        <p>In his view, endorsed by the trade associations for the dealers and lenders, finance managers are selling a service: the arrangement of credit.</p>
        <p>''A retail merchant buys products at wholesale, sells them at retail and hopes he has the products his customers need -- and one of those products happens to be money,'' said Mr. Robertson.</p>
        <p>Finance managers may work hard to find lenders willing to extend credit, especially to more marginal customers, he said. And finance managers have access to many more sources of credit than a typical consumer has, he added.</p>
        <p>No informed consumer, Mr. Robertson said, should expect the dealer to arrange vehicle financing free.</p>
        <p>Lawyers for the lenders and dealers point out that several earlier lawsuits challenging dealer markups have been largely unsuccessful.</p>
        <p>The exceptions have been a few cases where the consumers could argue -- as Mr. McGehee's clients do -- that the dealers promised to seek ''the best rate'' on their behalf. Dealers who make such promises may unwittingly assume a fiduciary duty to look out for the consumer's best interests, lawyers say.</p>
        <p>The Federal Reserve and Congress have declined to require dealers or lenders to disclose loan markups. The Truth in Lending Act requires only that consumers be informed about the actual interest rate and total finance charges they are paying. The loan documents that dealers use do that, although the dealers' own share is not disclosed.</p>
        <p>To Mr. Robertson, it is just as legitimate to mark up the price of the car loan as it is to mark up the price of the floor mats the dealer sells. Must a grocer tell shoppers how much he marked up the lettuce?</p>
        <p>No, consumer advocates answer, but the grocer bought the lettuce and is at risk if it goes bad before it is sold. Dealers have no money at risk in the car loans they arrange, they said, and are almost always free to cancel a customer's purchase if they cannot sell the loan immediately.</p>
        <p>Moreover, they argue, the grocer does not pretend that the farmer actually set the price of his lettuce, nor does the grocer arbitrarily mark up the lettuce by 50 cents a pound for one customer and by $1 a pound for the next.</p>
        <p>A Question of Discrimination</p>
        <p>But what if this hypothetical grocer were found to be charging a 50-cent markup to his white customers and a $1 markup to his black ones?</p>
        <p>That, in essence, is the allegation at the heart of the two class-action cases now pending against Nissan Motor Acceptance and General Motors Acceptance in Nashville.</p>
        <p>The case against Nissan's financing unit began in late August 1995 when Betty Cason, who is disabled, went to a Nissan dealer in Nashville to shop for a four-door vehicle to accommodate the five foster children she is raising with her husband, Robert.</p>
        <p>She selected a Pathfinder, trading in a two-door Chevrolet Blazer as her down payment and agreeing to finance the rest of the $24,292 purchase price through the dealer. She filled out an N.M.A.C. credit application.</p>
        <p>The Casons' credit history is pockmarked with problems. But the Nissan credit unit would finance the Pathfinder purchase for 16.49 percent. The finance manager at the Nashville dealership marked the Casons' loan rate up to 19.49 percent, adding $3,520 to the price they would pay over the loan's six-year term.</p>
        <p>Addie Coleman, a fragile-looking woman with two children, also went shopping for a new car in 1995, visiting a local Pontiac dealer. She, too, had a poor credit history and had been denied financing by several other lenders. The dealer arranged her loan with G.M.A.C., which agreed to finance the car purchase at 18.25 percent. The dealer presented her with a four-year contract showing an interest rate of 20.75 percent, which added $809 to her financing costs, and Mrs. Coleman signed it.</p>
        <p>Both women later consulted Nashville Legal Services about other complaints they had against the local dealers and were referred to Clinton W. Watkins, a local lawyer. Initially, the lawsuits he filed on their behalf simply challenged the legitimacy of the loan markup.</p>
        <p>But while litigating those cases, he and his co-counsel, Michael E. Terry and Wyman Gilmore Jr., obtained data on thousands of G.M.A.C. and N.M.A.C. loans in Tennessee. Using state motor vehicle records, they racially coded as many of the loan applications as they could.</p>
        <p>They then asked Dr. Debby A. Lindsey, a business professor at Howard University, to analyze the loans -- roughly 9,600 from N.M.A.C. and slightly fewer than 5,000 from G.M.A.C.</p>
        <p>Their theory was that the buy rate fairly captured all credit variables unique to individual consumers without respect to race.</p>
        <p>In the plaintiffs' view, the dealers had no money at risk and should have been indifferent to any variations in consumer creditworthiness. So how did they decide how much to add to the buy rate on each loan?</p>
        <p>What Dr. Lindsey found, in both cases, was that the amounts dealers added to the buy rates of black consumers were, on average, several hundred dollars higher than the amounts added to white consumers' rates.</p>
        <p>Nissan ordered its own studies of the loan data, conducted by Dr. Janet Thornton, an economist with a private research firm in Florida. Dr. Thornton disputed whether differences in creditworthiness were fully captured in the lender's buy rate. Indeed, she argued, it was exactly those credit differences -- not race -- that explained the markup disparities.</p>
        <p>Mark A. Cohen, a business professor at Vanderbilt University who confirmed Dr. Lindsey's findings, said that such differences were indeed examined, but they did not adequately explain the pattern.</p>
        <p>The plaintiffs' lawyers said the dealers have testified that they do not consider credit factors when they set markups. The discriminatory pattern is ''as bad, or worse'' among consumers within the best credit tiers, said Mr. Klein, one of the plaintiffs' lawyers.</p>
        <p>At a hearing in August, Anne Fortney, a former Federal Trade Commission member who is representing Nissan, dismissed the studies as unreliable.</p>
        <p>''If I thought there was a problem here such as the plaintiffs described, I would not be defending this action,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Defining the Dealer's Role</p>
        <p>In fact, the Nashville reports are only the latest in a decade-long series of studies that suggest there is pervasive discrimination against black car buyers, said Ian Ayres, a law professor at Yale University.</p>
        <p>Professor Ayres, who also has a doctorate in economics, has conducted two audits of car dealers' behavior toward white and black customers, one in 1991, another in 1995. In each experiment, matched pairs of shoppers, identical except for their race, used the same script to negotiate for cars at dealerships in the Chicago area. And in each experiment, black shoppers got poorer deals, he said.</p>
        <p>More recently, Professor Ayres analyzed five years of customer sales records from a Mazda dealership in suburban Atlanta. That data, too, showed that black customers paid higher car prices and larger finance charges than whites.</p>
        <p>Professor Ayres said he cannot say for sure what causes these patterns: ''There are lots of possibilities but none of them is inconsistent with old-fashioned racial discrimination by dealers.''</p>
        <p>The legal issues being tested in these cases are just as contentious as the statistical arguments.</p>
        <p>The key question is whether the dealers are acting as the lenders' agents when they arrange car loans, as the plaintiffs contend, or whether the dealers are actually negotiating the loans and then selling them after the fact, as the lenders insist. The lenders' view has prevailed in many court tests and has been endorsed by staff interpretations from the Federal Reserve.</p>
        <p>But the Justice Department, which recently has intervened in the Nissan case in Nashville, is arguing that the lenders actually exercise enormous control over the dealers as part of the loan process and should be held accountable for the outcome.</p>
        <p>At a court hearing in August, Carolyn A. Evans, a Justice Department lawyer, noted that lenders design the application forms and limit how many points dealers can add to loans. They forbid markups on certain promotional loan programs. They determine how much of the markup the dealer can collect up front and how much must be shared with the lenders.</p>
        <p>The Nissan finance unit makes dealers use its own forms to insure their loans comply with truth-in-lending laws, she added. ''Why can't N.M.A.C. take steps to insure that the loans it approves and funds comply with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act?''</p>
        <p>Getting, and Using, Information</p>
        <p>These knotty questions are anything but academic for consumers making what may be, after their homes, the largest purchase they will ever make -- as Natolie Davis, a working mother who lives with her husband and three children in Bedford Heights, Ohio, can attest.</p>
        <p>According to a lawsuit she has filed in Cleveland, Mrs. Davis had been assured by her local bank that she could get a 9.5 percent loan to finance her purchase of a new Ford Taurus she found at a Dodge dealership in November 1996.</p>
        <p>Her dealer still arranged financing for her -- without her knowledge or approval, she contends in her lawsuit -- and found a lender willing to finance her purchase at almost the same rate her bank had quoted. Then, she contends, he marked up that loan rate, charging her 12.5 percent and receiving $963 in markup from the lender.</p>
        <p>The dealer's lawyer contends that Mrs. Davis, who had taken possession of the car, did not provide proof of bank financing within the set time limit, and that the dealer had no choice but to seek financing for her.</p>
        <p>The dispute captures the debate about markups: The dealer did, indeed, get a competitive loan rate for Mrs. Davis.</p>
        <p>But that did not save her any money, since the loan's rate was raised. Over the term of the loan, the dealer's rate would cost $3,000 more than the bank rate, according to her complaint.</p>
        <p>At least Mrs. Davis knew what rate she could command in the marketplace before she shopped for her car -- knowledge any consumer with access to a computer and the Internet can obtain. Consumers with excellent credit can now even arrange their loans online, through Internet lending services.</p>
        <p>In the future, according to industry consultants, these developments could affect dealer-arranged car lending more than the litigation now making its way through the courts.</p>
        <p>''The Internet has made consumers more aware of what constitutes a fair discount from the dealer's price on the car,'' said Chris Denove, a partner with J. D. Power &amp; Associates, the customer-service consultants. ''It has the potential to have an even more powerful impact for consumers who are attempting to finance their vehicles.''</p>
        <p>Preparing to Make a Deal</p>
        <p>Consumer advocates offer these tips for car-loan shoppers:</p>
        <p>*Before shopping, check with a bank, a credit union or an Internet site to learn what rates they offer.</p>
        <p>*Ask credit agencies for a complete consumer credit history.</p>
        <p>*Take note of the annual percentage rate the dealer offers, not just the monthly payments.</p>
        <p>*Bargain for a lower rate; the dealer sets it and can change it.</p>
        <p>*Never sign blank loan documents, even if that delays driving the new car home.</p>
