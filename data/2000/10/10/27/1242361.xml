        <p>SUNDAY 1 P.M.</p>
        <p>Jets (6-1) at Buffalo (3-4)  Could the Jets still be exhausted from their comeback against Miami? Quite possible. But they are starting to believe they could be special, and they might be right. How can you explain some of the heroics? The team's 74 fourth-quarter points are higher than the team's fourth-quarter total in six of the past 10 years. They may be tired and a little sore, but as they have done in almost every game this season, the Jets will find a way to win. Jets, 28-17</p>
        <p>Carolina (3-4) at Atlanta (2-6)  Two of the most disappointing teams at midseason, mainly because of poor defense. The Falcons give up a shocking 389.1 yards a game. The Reggie White experiment in Carolina has been a disappointment. The only positive for Panthers has been quarterback Steve Beuerlein, a tough, solid passer. The Panthers have had a difficult time with Atlanta, but Beuerlein comes up big.  Panthers, 20-14</p>

        <p>Jets (6-1) at Buffalo (3-4)  Could the Jets still be exhausted from their comeback against Miami? Quite possible. But they are starting to believe they could be special, and they might be right. How can you explain some of the heroics? The team's 74 fourth-quarter points are higher than the team's fourth-quarter total in six of the past 10 years. They may be tired and a little sore, but as they have done in almost every game this season, the Jets will find a way to win. Jets, 28-17</p>
        <p>Carolina (3-4) at Atlanta (2-6)  Two of the most disappointing teams at midseason, mainly because of poor defense. The Falcons give up a shocking 389.1 yards a game. The Reggie White experiment in Carolina has been a disappointment. The only positive for Panthers has been quarterback Steve Beuerlein, a tough, solid passer. The Panthers have had a difficult time with Atlanta, but Beuerlein comes up big.  Panthers, 20-14</p>
        <p>Cincinnati (1-6) at Cleveland (2-6)  Dog game of the week. The only reason to tune in this one on the satellite dish is to see if Cincinnati running back Corey Dillon will smash another rushing record. Dillon, who ran for an N.F.L.-record 278 yards last week against Denver, has two of the top six rushing efforts in league history. He gets 150 against the Browns and the Bengals get their second consecutive victory. Bengals, 17-13</p>
        <p>Pittsburgh (5-3) at Baltimore (5-3)  The change from Tony Banks to Trent Dilfer will probably help the Ravens. It is always good to have a change of pace when the offense is struggling. But don't expect a Joe Montana performance. Pittsburgh, which ranks third in the A.F.C. in rushing (137.6 yards a game) facing the stingiest run defense in the league (61.9). Kordell Stewart starts. The Ravens have won 8 of 9 games against division opponents. Ravens, 20-10</p>
        <p>Detroit (5-2) at Indianapolis (5-2)  The Lions are a quiet team, keeping a low profile, stalking opponents from the underbrush. They make few mistakes, giving away a league-low two fumbles, and lead the conference with a plus-11 turnover ratio. Detroit's defense has 14 interceptions, tying Denver for tops in the league. The Lions will be able to move the ball against the Colts. Normally, Indianapolis, tough at home, would get the edge, but Detroit's defense is an advantage. Lions, 23-19</p>
        <p>Green Bay (3-4) at Miami (5-2)  The Dolphins had one of the most disheartening losses a team can suffer by blowing a huge lead Monday night. There is no way that team cannot be affected after blowing a 30-7, fourth-quarter lead to the Jets. To compound the problem, Miami defensive players are questioning why the coaching staff was so conservative when the team had a huge lead. The Dolphins are bound to have a hangover. They do and the well-rested Packers take advantage. Packers, 21-20</p>
        <p>Minnesota (7-0) at Tampa Bay (3-4)  If the Buccaneers lose, their playoff hopes are most likely extinguished. Even with their offensive struggles, it is difficult to pick against the Buccaneers. They have too much fight. But it will be close. The last four games between these two teams have been decided by 7 points or fewer. The Vikings are mentally tough but Tampa Bay makes a grand stand to get back in the playoff hunt. Buccaneers, 14-10</p>
        <p>SUNDAY 4:05 P.M.</p>
        <p>Philadelphia (5-3) at Giants (5-2)  The Giants are looking to win their eighth straight over Philadelphia, which would be the most against the Eagles since nine straight from 1938 to 1942. When will the Giants' dominance over the Eagles end? It must at some point -- just not this week. The Giants match up well with Philadelphia. The Eagles do not have a formidable passing attack, and pass defense is the biggest weakness of New York's defense. And without running back Duce Staley, the Eagles are one-dimensional. Giants, 25-10</p>
        <p>New Orleans (4-3) at Arizona (2-5)  Normally, one would expect the standings of these two teams to be reversed. The Saints have traditionally been doormats and the Cardinals were supposed to be the franchise on the rise. The Cardinals have fallen apart, firing Coach Vince Tobin, and are left wondering if Jake Plummer is the answer at quarterback. Meanwhile New Orleans is winning with healthy doses of running by Ricky Williams and one of the most underrated defenses. The Saints allow just 228.9 yards a game, best in the league. Saints, 17-15</p>
        <p>St. Louis (6-1) at San Francisco (2-6)  Quarterback Trent Green makes his first start of the season, replacing the injured Kurt Warner, and the league will be watching closely. Will the Rams' runaway offensive train derail or will it not skip a beat? It should move along just fine. One reason is Green is just as good as Warner if not better. The other is running back Marshall Faulk, who leads the N.F.L. with 1,182 total yards. Everything in that offense goes through him. So without Warner the Rams will score 28 points a game instead of 40. Rams, 28-24</p>
        <p>SUNDAY 4:15 P.M.</p>
        <p>Jacksonville (2-6) at Dallas (3-4)  The Cowboys' 48-point scoring bonanza against Arizona last week was somewhat of a mirage. The Cardinals were a dispirited group and Dallas took advantage. This is not to say that Troy Aikman, who took painkilling shots in his back this week, didn't play better than he did against the Giants when he tossed five interceptions. He did. There was more zip on his passes and they were more accurate. Dallas plays another team in a free fall, the Jaguars, and the Cowboys again take complete advantage. Cowboys, 21-14</p>
        <p>Kansas City (4-3) at Seattle (2-6)  The Chiefs' offensive coordinator Jimmy Raye, has turned around the offense, transforming it from a ground-oriented attack to a more pass-happy one. Kansas City has had a 100-yard receiver a team-record five straight times. The Seahawks will give up at least four big plays. Chiefs, 30-16</p>
        <p>SUNDAY 8:30 P.M.</p>
        <p>Oakland (6-1) at San Diego (0-7)  Somehow this always comes back to the goofiness of quarterback Ryan Leaf. He was recently spotted playing golf, which was curious, because he supposedly has an injured wrist. So the San Diego players were again spending time answering questions from the news media about Leaf's antics. Linebacker Junior Seau talked about distractions. He did not say specifically what they were, but it was clear he was referring to Leaf. Normally, this might be a dangerous game for the Raiders, but San Diego has more pressing issues to deal with off the field. Raiders, 30-9</p>
        <p>GAME OF THE WEEK</p>
        <p>MONDAY 9 P.M.</p>
        <p>Titans (6-1) at Redskins (6-2)  The key to this game is running back Eddie George. He is the soul of this team and is currently nursing a sore knee. He will most likely play, and that's the good news. The question is how much will that knee affect George? He is one of the toughest players in the N.F.L. and is a big reason why Tennessee has won 11 of its past 12 games. Without him the Titans become more one-dimensional. Washington, rather quietly, has steadied itself, relying on the legs of Stephen Davis (a league-leading 802 yards rushing) and the leadership of quarterback Brad Johnson. If George is near 100 percent, Titans win. Titans, 18-16</p>
        <p>Chicago, Denver and New England do not play this week. All times Eastern.</p>
