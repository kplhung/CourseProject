        <p>In the face of promised vetoes by President Clinton and with the election only 12 days away, the House today approved a $37.7 billion spending measure and a package of tax cuts and reimbursements to hospitals, nursing homes and health maintenance organizations.</p>
        <p>The House passed the tax and health care reimbursement measures by a vote of 237 to 134 and approved the spending bill to finance the Commerce, Justice and State Departments by a vote of 206 to 198. The votes set up a confrontation between Congressional Republicans and the White House in Congress's waning days.</p>
        <p>The votes in the House, which are expected to be mirrored in the Senate in the coming days, capped a day devoted to highly charged issues like taxes, health care, school construction, immigration and assisted suicide.</p>
        <p>The House's action and the promised veto all but assure that, although the new fiscal year began 26 days ago, it will be several more days before the Congress finally finishes work on all of the spending bills needed to fund government operations.</p>
        <p>''It's particularly troubling at this late stage in the budget process that Congress seems to prefer a path of partisanship to one where we could maybe find some compromise,'' said Jack Siewert, the White House press secretary.</p>
        <p>The tax package, estimated to cost about $240 billion over 10 years, includes breaks for small businesses, health care, pension plans, school construction bonds and corporations. It also includes a $1 increase over  two years in the minimum wage. The White House, however, strongly objected to the tax breaks, saying they were skewed to well-to-do people and affluent school districts.</p>
        <p>Before the vote, Republican leaders said that if Mr. Clinton vetoed the  tax cuts, they would not pursue the issue before adjournment.</p>
        <p>''If he vetoes the tax bill, there will not be another tax bill,'' said Rep. Roy Blunt, a Republican from Missouri, the liaison between House Republicans and the presidential campaign of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. ''Let the next president sign an even better tax bill.''</p>
        <p>That would mean that the 106th Congress would have, over two years, failed to enact any significant tax cut. It would also mean that going into the election, the Republicans would have one more opportunity to paint the Democrats as the obstacle to tax cuts.</p>
        <p>''Maybe the problem is we're going to pass this law just too close to the election,'' said Richard K. Armey, the House majority leader.</p>
        <p>In addition to tax cuts, the package includes payments under Medicare, estimated at more than $30 billion over five years, to health maintenance organizations, hospitals and nursing homes. Congress reduced Medicare payments to health care providers in 1997 as part of the move to balance the federal budget. But the cuts have proved far deeper than Congress intended. Today's action was designed to restore some of those cuts.</p>
        <p>Although these Medicare payments were supported by both Republicans and Democrats, Mr. Clinton objected -- and many Democrats agreed -- that too much of the Medicare money was going to H.M.O.'s.</p>
        <p>''The power that the managed care industry wields over the leadership of this body is absolutely staggering,'' said Rep. Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio. ''H.M.O.'s serve one-sixth of Medicare beneficiaries, but this bill gives them 50 percent of the funding.''</p>
        <p>The House also disregarded a pledge of a veto and pushed through  their version of a bill designed to make it easier for as many as 400,000 immigrants to become permanent United States residents.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton and Congressional Democrats said the Republican measure, while promising, was inadequate to address the needs of hundreds of thousands of other immigrants. The Republican measure was attached to a mammoth bill that funds the Departments of Commerce, State and Justice, as well as the District of Columbia.</p>
        <p>In a letter to House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois, Mr. Clinton said today that he would veto the bill, forcing another round of negotiations over the issue in the coming days.</p>
        <p>''Current Republican proposals would not help most of the people who need relief and would perpetuate the current patchwork of contradictory and unfair immigration policies,'' Mr. Clinton wrote.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton also expressed reservations about the bill's lack of funding for the Justice Department to pursue lawsuits against the tobacco companies and the fact that it did not  extend federal hate crimes legislation to crimes motivated by a victim's sexual orientation.</p>
        <p>The tussle over the spending measure is a pitched partisan battle, one that Democrats hope to use for political gain as they head into the November elections.</p>
        <p>Both Florida and California, two critical states in the presidential elections, have a large number of immigrants, many of whom would benefit from the immigration provisions.</p>
        <p>For months, Democrats have tried  to force a vote on their immigration bill, the Latino Immigration and Fairness Act, which would permit about one million immigrants to apply for legal residency.</p>
        <p>But this week, Republicans, seeking to shield themselves from the anti-immigrant label, cobbled together their own, more limited proposal, one they said did not reward immigrants who had entered the country illegally.</p>
        <p>''Republicans are suggesting a compromise,'' said Representative Dana Rohrabacher, Republican of California, who expressed outrage over the scope of the Democratic proposal. ''Do we then reward people who thumb their nose at the legal system and come here illegally?''</p>
        <p>Drafted by Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, the bill would allow as many as 400,000 immigrants who entered the country illegally before 1982 to reapply for green cards.</p>
        <p>Most of these immigrants are involved in class-action lawsuits against the Immigration and Naturalization Service, contending that the agency mishandled their requests for amnesty under a 1986 immigration law.</p>
        <p>The bill would also create a new category of visas for the spouses and minor children of legal residents, allowing them to live and work in the United States for a time while their applications are processed. Mr. Hatch estimates that 600,000 people could apply for those visas.</p>
        <p>The Republican proposal does not include relief for the 400,000 Hondurans, Guatemalans, Salvadorans, Haitians and Liberians who fled civil strife at home and arrived in the United States before December 1995.</p>
        <p>It also excludes a Democratic provision that would permit immigrants who are changing their legal status to pay a $1,000 fee and complete the process in the United States, rather than return to their home country and leave relatives here behind.</p>
        <p>''It's a pieced-together proposal which sounds good but does little to help families,'' said Representative Martin Frost, Democrat of Texas. ''It ignores the need to stabilize the immigration status of people who have lived and worked and paid taxes in the United States for years.''</p>
