        <p>''It is very important to me to know that the viewer is not just watching something, but is participating,'' said Julian Schnabel, the painter-turned-award-winning film director.</p>
        <p>He was reclining on his left side on a lounge chair, wearing only a bathing suit and waiting for his lunch to arrive on the fourth-floor pool deck at the Four Seasons Hotel in Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schnabel, who rose to international prominence as a painter during the 1980's art boom, was discussing his camera technique in ''Before Night Falls,'' his second film. It won him the grand jury prize at the Venice International Film Festival in September (as well as a best-actor prize for its star, Javier Bardem) before being similarly well received at festivals in Toronto and New York. In the film, the camera seems hyperactive, loath to stand still, whizzing across landscapes and through crowded rooms, almost as if it had a mind of its own and were trying to root something out.</p>
        <p>''I like the feeling that the camera is alive,'' Mr. Schnabel said.</p>
        <p>He financed the $12 million film himself, he said -- ''At least, I signed for it; I'm responsible for it'' -- and was particularly careful in choosing its distributor. He was less than pleased with the treatment Miramax  accorded his first film, ''Basquiat,'' in 1996. He felt it was marketed as almost an afterthought, not deemed capable of winning the big awards that one of Miramax's other films, ''The English Patient,'' collected that year. But now he is quite happy with the way his second movie is being treated by his new distributor, Fine Line Pictures.</p>
        <p>''I had a great time making the movie,'' he said. ''And now it is being received very well everywhere it is shown, and we have the two awards in Venice. What more could I ask for?''</p>
        <p>The film is based on the memoirs of Reinaldo Arenas, the Cuban-born poet and novelist who was persecuted by the Castro government for his writings and his homosexuality. His escape to the United States as part of the Mariel boat lift in 1980 failed to bring him the creative and personal happiness he craved. The film is filled with unexpected appearances by performers in unusual roles, some of whom are barely recognizable. Sean Penn, for instance, plays a peasant driving a horse wagon. Johnny Depp has two roles, as a transvestite prison smuggler and as a casually brutal interrogator.</p>
        <p>''What qualifies me to do this movie?'' Mr. Schnabel asked. ''A New York Jew making a movie about a Cuban writer? I don't know. You have to have a feeling about something. Something speaks to you. And then you try to do it.''</p>
        <p>Lunch arrived, in steady installments. A plate of boiled jumbo shrimp. A basket of onion rings. A softball-size cheeseburger with shoestring fries. And a vanilla milkshake. Mr. Schnabel sat up and pulled on a wrinkled, sleeveless shirt -- as dark green as the surrounding palm leaves, but splattered with bright blue and yellow paint.</p>
        <p>All in all, he said, he prefers the solitary life of the painter. ''I like not talking to people,'' he said. ''I like being alone. There is great freedom in that.''</p>
        <p>How does he reconcile his desire for solitude with the collaborations necessary in the filmmaking process?</p>
        <p>''I love the people I work with,'' he said. ''I surround myself with people I love. Johnny Depp, Sean Penn. My wife is the actress who plays Reinaldo's mother. I find that the best way to know people is to work with them.'' (His wife is Olatz Lopez Garmendia.)</p>
        <p>He shot for 60 days in various Mexican locations, then for 10 days in New York, beginning in August 1999 and ending in November. Then he and his editing team retired to his Manhattan studio on 11th Street and began to cut and shape and cut and shape. ''I was still making color and sound corrections a week before the film opened in Venice,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He had some private screenings, for friends like the actors Al Pacino, Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken. And some of them helped him in the shaping of some of the scenes, and in deciding which parts could be eliminated to make the film more trim.</p>
        <p>''Do I think I will make another movie?'' he asked. ''Yes. Do I know what it will be? No. I don't know what my next painting will be. I don't know what I will wear tonight.''</p>
        <p>In Shock, Happily</p>
        <p>Julie Walters was in Los Angeles for only a few days, with her husband and daughter, and she was trying to figure out what to do during the handful of hours she was to be set free by the Universal Pictures publicity machine. Ms. Walters is one of the critically acclaimed stars of ''Billy Elliot,'' a small English film about a poor lad who dreams of being a ballet dancer -- a film the studio feels, and many others agree, stands a solid shot at some Oscar nominations, much to her delight and surprise.</p>
        <p>''I think we'll do the Universal Studios tour, and then maybe to Venice Beach,'' she said. ''How far away is Disneyland? Can you get a taxi there?''</p>
        <p>Ms. Walters first became known to American audiences in 1983 with the release of ''Educating Rita,'' a film that won her a Golden Globe award and an Oscar nomination. But she never transplanted from England to Hollywood, preferring her life in a village in Sussex and a steady stream of film and television work in Britain. She also frequents West End stages, most recently in a Royal National Theater production of Arthur Miller's ''All My Sons.'' It's not that she has anything particularly against Hollywood, she said.</p>
        <p>''I don't mean to imply that if Quentin Tarantino were to call tomorrow and offer me a role in his next film, I wouldn't leap at it,'' she said. ''I would. Please print that. Shall I include my phone number?''</p>
        <p>Ms. Walters had been awake since 5 a.m., jet-lagged after a long flight from London, and was having her second meal of the day, a bowl of Irish oatmeal studded with strawberries and bananas and a small pot of herbal tea.</p>
        <p>''Billy Elliot,'' shown at the Cannes Film Festival in May and at the Toronto festival in September, is being given slow, deliberate treatment as the first release for Universal Focus, the studio's new specialty film division. It is the first film for the British stage director Stephen Daldry and includes a breakout performance by young Jamie Bell.</p>
        <p>''It's really stunning that this is happening because it was such wonderful fun to make,'' Ms. Walters said. ''None of us, I am sure, had any idea that it would come to this. Not until it was before audiences at Cannes did we turn to one another and say, 'God, they really like it, don't they?' ''</p>
        <p>But for her, it has been a particular triumph because the film has been playing for three weeks at the Regal, the only theater in her village.</p>
        <p>''I mean, I've nearly made it now, I'm on at the Regal,'' she said. ''And my name above the title, you know, with one of the letters a little wonky. But it's up there. I asked someone to take my picture in front of it.''</p>
