        <p>I.B.M., Sun Microsystems, Ericsson -- the list of companies reporting that their recently completed quarter's sales and earnings were crimped by component shortages is not only broad but it is led by many of the biggest names in the global communications and information technology sectors.</p>
        <p>The overall impact of the shortages appears to be down this quarter from earlier this year, now that tens of billions of dollars have been committed to expanding the component makers' capacity. While some of biggest projects, like I.B.M.'s $2.5 billion investment to build a new factory in East Fishkill, N.Y., will not be online for two or more years, the component makers' spending includes numerous smaller investments that are already boosting production. At the same time, the pressure is easing because some large cellular phone manufacturers like Motorola have cut back their projections of consumer demand and thus their anticipated component orders.</p>
        <p>Still, the prevailing view among analysts and industry executives is that constraints could continue to affect manufacturers of computers, cell phones and numerous other electronic devices well into next year.</p>
        <p>''We definitely have some products in short supply,'' said Judy Bruner, chief financial officer of Palm Inc., which reported last month that revenues rose 127 percent in the three months ending Sept. 1 from the same period a year ago. ''We could have sold quite a bit more.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Bruner said that supplies of memory chips, drivers, screens and radio processors for the Palm VII wireless hand-held computers had all been in short supply.</p>
        <p>For every company that is reporting that the shortages have cost them sales, there are many more saying that they have been hurt by being forced to pay higher prices to get the supplies they need. Companies have also sacrificed profits to carry higher inventories so they can keep serving customers if they run into more supply problems. Another big headache has been the need to continually tinker with production schedules and marketing plans.</p>
        <p>''We got a lot of supply late in the quarter but balancing production was very tough,'' said Michael Capellas, chairman and chief executive of Compaq Computer Corporation, the world's largest personal computer manufacturer.</p>
        <p>Plenty of companies that had no component problems of their own continue to be hurt by the shortages. Komag reported last week that it had to cut disk production in September because the disk drive manufacturers it supplies were unable to find all the other components they needed to keep up with their projected output.</p>
        <p>Components shortages are nothing new in the boom-and-bust world of electronics. Although the market for electronic products has been growing for decades, manufacturers of chips and other components tend to overinvest in new capacity when sales are especially strong.</p>
        <p>That leads to gluts and sharp price decreases, temporarily draining both the incentives and the resources for more large-scale investment. After a lull of two or three years in which weaker suppliers often drop out completely, the continually rising demand catches up and the boom times return, complete with shortages of popular components.</p>
        <p>Analysts note that not all of the component woes in the news recently are linked to the current cyclical shortage. Sony's problems meeting its production goals for its new PlayStation 2, which went on sale yesterday, appear to be related to internal manufacturing problems rather than general component supply issues.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, the current cyclical shortage is remarkable in several respects. For the first time since the early 1980's when VCR's and video games were factors in the electronics market, the cycle is not being driven by the personal computer business. Component manufacturers were caught off guard in 1999 as wave after wave of unexpectedly strong demand rolled in from the cell phone market, the numerous companies building the communications networks supporting the Internet, and wireless device makers like Palm. Still more demand arose from old-economy products like cars and toys. Earlier this year, Mattel Inc., whose products include the Elmo talking doll, said that shortages of microchips could cost it $100 million in lost sales by the end of this year and Hasbro Inc., Mattel's biggest rival, was forced to delay introduction of Shelby, a friend for its interactive Furby doll.</p>
        <p>''The growth rates for some of these things has been incredible,'' said Douglas Andrey, director of finance for the Semiconductor Industry Association. ''The second half of 1999 was one of the strongest we have ever seen.''</p>
        <p>Throw in economic recovery in Asia and the absence of a substantial slowdown that many expected from Year 2000 computer disruptions and the end result was a shock to the electronics supply chain.</p>
        <p>The component shortages have ranged across a far wider variety of components than in past cycles, according to many analysts. In some cases, manufacturers have found themselves scrambling for such commodity items as diodes and resistors.</p>
        <p>''I've been in the industry 40 years and I've never seen demand like this,'' said Glyndwr Smith, senior vice president at Vishay Intertechnology Inc., a leading producer of capacitors and resistors based in Malvern, Pa. Vishay has begun allocating its production capacity for next year among its major customers.</p>
        <p>''In January, we estimated we would be meeting demand by Thanksgiving,'' Mr. Smith said. ''Now we are estimating midsummer of next year.''</p>
        <p>The shortages have produced a wild ride for investors in the component companies. Vishay's stock, for example, closed at $26.88 yesterday, down 57 percent from its high in May when it was one of Wall Street's darlings, but still up 68 percent from a year ago.</p>
        <p>The component companies say current conditions have encouraged many customers to seek multiyear supply agreements. In the past, customers who sought such agreements were trying to lock in low prices. These days, they are trying to guarantee supplies.</p>
