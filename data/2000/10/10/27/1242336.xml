        <p>New York's attorney general, Eliot L. Spitzer, said he opposed Consolidated Edison's proposed merger with Northeast Utilities under the state Public Service Commission's current agreement, which allows Con Ed to pass on increases in energy rates to its consumers. The commission has already approved the merger, but yesterday Mr. Spitzer called for changing its terms, saying that it would be bad for consumers unless the commission rejected Con Ed's request to extend its ability to pass on incremental costs. That ability was responsible for a 30 percent increase in residential electric bills this summer, Mr. Spitzer said in a written statement submitted to the commission yesterday. Con Ed wants the commission to extend its rate agreement until March 2005.</p>
