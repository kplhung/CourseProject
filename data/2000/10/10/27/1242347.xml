        <p>There were two scuffles and a lot of shoving and shouting during Giants practice today. Perhaps Coach Jim Fassel's post-bye week scheme for his team is working after all.</p>
        <p>Fassel's teams are 0-3 in games they have played after the annual bye in their schedule. Since the bye system was installed, the Giants have a 2-9 record after a week off, the worst such record of any National Football League team.</p>
        <p>With the Giants coming off a bye as they prepare to play host to Philadelphia on Sunday, Fassel has tried to infuse his team's practices with a little more intensity, hoping to snap the Giants out of any idle-induced slumber. The first thing Fassel did when the Giants returned from their weekend off was put the players in full pads for Monday's workout. The Giants generally do not work out on Mondays at all, but Fassel had his charges fully suited and running through a spirited session.</p>
        <p>Today, the hitting during team drills was almost three-quarter speed, a level of contact not seen since training camp. Midway through practice, when free safety Shaun Williams dragged running back Joe Montgomery to the ground along the sideline and then fell on top of him, the two began wrestling.</p>
        <p>Running backs and receivers are not normally tackled in practice. Usually the contact is light, just enough of a nudge with the shoulder pads to briefly impede the ball carrier. Today, Williams and Montgomery went at it long enough -- with at least one punch thrown -- that Fassel had to walk halfway across the field to break it up.</p>
        <p>Earlier, defensive tackle George Williams and offensive guard Mike Rosenthal had to be separated, the two going face mask to face mask after a blocking drill, another confrontation that would be routine in training camp but uncommon during the regular season.</p>
        <p>Fassel has not, by any means, encouraged fighting this week since he knows such tussles can lead to injuries. But he is well aware of his record after the bye week -- he has been asked about it every day this week -- and he has tried to do some things differently.</p>
        <p>''I don't want to dwell on it,'' Fassel said. ''But yeah, I wasn't going to do all the same things. I wanted more energy. You try things.''</p>
        <p>Fassel also tried different things in previous years, but it didn't help. Most disconcerting to the Giants is that their last three games after the bye week have not just been defeats, but dreadful performances that spawned slumps.</p>
        <p>In 1997, the Giants had won five consecutive games, were in first place and had a 6-3 record when they came to the bye week. After the layoff, they won just one of the next four games, beginning with a 10-6 loss in Tennessee.</p>
        <p>In 1998, the Giants were 3-4 heading into the bye week, then lost the next three games, beginning with a 21-14 defeat at Washington.</p>
        <p>Last year, the Giants had won three successive games to apparently revive their season and took a 5-3 record into the bye week. They lost at home to Indianapolis, 27-19, afterward and were beaten in the next two games as well.</p>
        <p>''If you look at the record, it seems like it's been impossible for us after the bye week,'' running back Tiki Barber said. ''But this is a different team, a more veteran team. We came back knowing what we had to do in practice.''</p>
        <p>Barber was not referring to fisticuffs. And neither was Fassel when he called today's practice ''strong and focused.'' But he is a football coach and he had that boys-will-be-boys gleam football coaches get in their eye after certain practices.</p>
        <p>''I like the way we're preparing this week,'' Fassel said.</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>JIM FASSEL said Giants wide receiver AMANI TOOMER looks completely recovered from hamstring and toe injuries that Fassel believes inhibited Toomer's preparation for the game against Dallas on Oct. 15. Toomer, benched against the Cowboys, made a number of catches deep downfield in Thursday's practice. . . . JARET HOLMES, who is competing with BRAD DALUISO for this week's place-kicking job, did not practice Thursday because of a sprained right ankle that Holmes first injured in the game against Atlanta on Oct. 8. Holmes kicks with his right foot and will not have much of a shot at winning the job if he does not kick in Friday's practice. . . . Nickel cornerback REGGIE STEPHENS also did not practice because of a sprained ankle.</p>
