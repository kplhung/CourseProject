        <p>British Airways is in talks with Delta Air Lines and Air France about joining their international alliance, a move that would be expected to break up British Air's long-troubled partnership with American Airlines.</p>
        <p>Discussions among the three airlines began earlier this year, according to two industry executives close to the talks who spoke on the condition of anonymity.</p>
        <p>The talks broke off over the summer, when British Air was negotiating to buy KLM Royal Dutch Airways. But they began again after the KLM deal fell apart last month, the executives said.</p>
        <p>A Delta spokesman declined to comment on the talks. ''We talk with many carriers all the time about a variety of subjects, and we don't respond specifically,'' he said.</p>
        <p>An Air France official made a similar remark.</p>
        <p>Jeff Angel, a spokesman for British Air, said only that the airline was focusing on its OneWorld alliance with American, which is a unit of the AMR Corporation, and several other airlines.</p>
        <p>''We're trying to find ways to improve that alliance and make it better for our customers,'' Mr. Angel said.</p>
        <p>Chris Chiames, a spokesman for American, agreed. ''All of our discussions with B.A. have been about how to strengthen both OneWorld and our bilateral relationship,'' he said.</p>
        <p>British Air and American announced their partnership more than four years ago, but the two airlines have been unable to take full advantage of it because regulators in Washington have refused to give them antitrust exemption until the United States and Britain sign a new bilateral aviation treaty that opens London's Heathrow Airport to more United States airlines.</p>
        <p>Under the current treaty, only American and United Airlines have access to Heathrow. Washington is insisting that British Air give up hundreds of valuable takeoff and landing slots at Heathrow before it approves the deal, a move that would cost British Air millions of dollars.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, two rival partnerships, between United, which is a unit of the UAL Corporation, and Lufthansa and between Northwest Airlines and KLM, have received antitrust approval, enabling them to coordinate their schedules and pricing, siphoning passengers away from British Air.</p>
        <p>If the talks succeed, British Air would join SkyTeam, the alliance recently formed by Delta and Air France. The move would satisfy British Air's need for both a European and trans-Atlantic partner, the executives said.</p>
        <p>An alliance with Delta presumably would not face the kind of opposition that British Air's agreement with American did because Delta does not have access to Heathrow. But it would give British Air access to a domestic network nearly the same size as American's.</p>
        <p>One of the executives said that the relationship between British Air and Air France had improved recently in the wake of this summer's crash of an Air France Concorde. The crash forced both airlines to ground their Concorde fleets and cooperate on returning the planes to service.</p>
        <p>The two carriers may face difficulties obtaining approval for an alliance from European regulators, however.</p>
        <p>And a European partner is a more pressing need for British Air, according to some analysts, because it is losing more than $300 million a year in Europe.</p>
        <p>A British Airways-Delta combination would be a blow to American, leaving it without a major European partner at a time when the top candidates are already in other alliances. American has a successful alliance with Swissair -- a deal that has irked British Air. But that could not take the place of British Air, which is a much larger carrier.</p>
        <p>One person close to American said that the airline had been working closely with British Air in recent weeks on how to make their relationship work.</p>
        <p>But he was not surprised to hear that British Air was talking to Delta.</p>
        <p>''They were ready to dump American once,'' he said, referring to the merger talks with KLM. ''And they are realistic about what it is going to take to get their trans-Atlantic deal with American approved.''</p>
