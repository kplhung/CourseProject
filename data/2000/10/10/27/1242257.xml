        <p>A black New Jersey State Police detective has been suspended without pay after being arrested by white officers in Trenton in what he said was a case of racial profiling.</p>
        <p>The suspension of the detective, John F. Day, on Monday came a day before state prosecutors said they would drop an attempted-murder charge against one of two white state troopers who shot and wounded three black and Hispanic men on the New Jersey Turnpike in 1998. Noting the decision to drop that charge, the Rev. Al Sharpton accused the state yesterday of using a double standard in dealing with officers accused of wrongdoing.</p>
        <p>At a news conference with Detective Day in Trenton, Mr. Sharpton said he would resume the demonstrations he led just after the April 1998 turnpike shooting if he was not satisfied with the police accounts of the detective's arrest early Saturday morning and an explanation of the suspension from Col. Carson J. Dunbar Jr., the state police superintendent.</p>
        <p>''This case and the dropping of the murder charge makes me want to reintroduce the kind of mass demonstrations I did back around the time the New Jersey four case started,'' Mr. Sharpton said.</p>
        <p>In a statement, Colonel Dunbar said Detective Day's suspension was consistent with a departmental policy for conduct that he put in place on March 1. He said that a review of the arrest and the suspension would be conducted, and that, if acquitted of the criminal charges, Detective Day would be entitled to full back pay.</p>
        <p>The Trenton incident occurred about 1 a.m. on Saturday outside a club named Maxine's. After an encounter with local police officers who had been called to the club, Detective Day was charged with resisting arrest, obstructing the administration of justice and attempting to leave the scene of a riot. He was released without bail later that day.</p>
        <p>Trenton police would not release information on the case over the telephone yesterday.</p>
        <p>Detective Day, 35, a 12-year veteran of the state police, said in an interview that he did not resist arrest, but that he told the officers who he was and offered to help keep the crowd under control. He said he had just pulled up his pickup truck in front of the club, double parking amid a row of patrol cars, when officers yelled at him to move his truck, then sprayed him with mace and dragged him to the ground.</p>
        <p>''They was kicking me, beating me. I felt like I was in Selma, Alabama,'' said Detective Day, who pleaded not guilty to the charges in Trenton Municipal Court yesterday, and is due back for a hearing Dec. 6.</p>
        <p>In the turnpike case, yesterday a judge granted the state's request to drop an attempted murder charge against Trooper John Hogan, who had claimed he was acting in self-defense when he shot at a van carrying the three young men, as it rolled backward toward him. He and his partner, John Kenna, are still charged with aggravated assault and Mr. Kenna still faces the attempted murder charges.</p>
