        <p>WHEN the brutal blare of the Shea Stadium loudspeakers let up for even a few miserable seconds, you could hear another sound, far more insidious.</p>
        <p>Chomp. Chomp. Chomp.</p>
        <p>It was the relentless sound of Yankee fans eating Met lunches, followed by the Yankee players doing exactly the same.</p>
        <p>Accompanied by the cheers of many thousands of their fans, the Yankees beat the Mets, 4-2, last night to win this first Subway Series in 44 years, and also take their 26th world championship.</p>
        <p>They did it the traditional Yankee way -- with power, with fielding, with superb pitching by Andy Pettitte, by grinding down the gallant Al Leiter, and ultimately they won (shades of Billy Martin and Brian Doyle and other modest-hitting second basemen) on a single up the middle by Luis Sojo, just inserted in the game.</p>
        <p>There were more Mets fans than Yankee fans among the 55,292 paying customers, but the zeal and numbers of Yankee fans was impossible to miss.</p>
        <p>The incursion of Yankee fans -- at these prices, probably more arrived in private helicopters than via mass transit -- surely had next to nothing to do with the result.</p>
        <p>The Yankees have made themselves into one of the most resourceful and complete and likable teams ever to dominate a generation.</p>
        <p>This Subway Series was better than your average five-game World Series, with not a clunker of a game among them. Four were close all the way, while the second, now known as The Night Roger Clemens Went Batty, saw the Mets score five times in the ninth, only to lose by a run.</p>
        <p>This Series will also be remembered for the way the affluent Yankee fans just marched in and took over the place. Put their feet up. Hung their El Duque strikeout ''que'' over the railing. Cheered for the team from the other side of the Triborough Bridge. And won two out of three in the Mets' house.</p>
        <p>But it was done peaceably, in a sporting mood, according to John Franco, the Mets' reliever.</p>
        <p>''There were no fights, people were great, on both sides,'' Franco said. ''People around the country could see that New York fans are not a bunch of animals.''</p>
        <p>And George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' owner, had nothing but praise for the Shea crowd, saying, ''We were treated so well, and our people could walk around by themselves with no problems.''</p>
        <p>By starting games on the downward slope toward 9 p.m., baseball once again cleverly insured that young New Yorkers would not see the classic matchup of Mariano Rivera getting Mike Piazza to hit a long fly to Bernie Williams to end this Subway Series at around midnight.</p>
        <p>After beating out whatever is left of the public's brains early in the series, the Mets' management mercifully ratcheted down the killer sound system another notch or two.</p>
        <p>The public address announcer basically implored Mets fans to cheer, but Yankee fans sounded like the home crowd when Williams hit a homer to lead off the second and Derek Jeter hit a game-tying homer in the sixth.</p>
        <p>And when Pettitte struck out two batters to end the seventh, the cheer was like a home-team celebration. But Mets fans did make more noise for Leiter.</p>
        <p>It is understandable that Yankee fans would do whatever they could to get tickets right across the border in Queens. After all, the Yankee fans' presence for games in Baltimore, Toronto and even Boston is stunning.</p>
        <p>For this end of the World Series, thousands of tickets went up for sale via telephone. Stockbrokers and internet millionaires with personal secretaries and banks of phone lines were able to score the tickets. Capitalism at work.</p>
        <p>Theoretically, the free-floating market of World Series tickets could have turned off one prospective transient worker from signing on with the Mets. Alex Rodriguez, who spent the first four years of his life in the city, attended Wednesday night's Yankee victory, and was struck by the absence of ambience.</p>
        <p>''I didn't get that New York feel,'' Rodriguez said. ''Everything seemed so corporate here. The crowd seemed a little jaded.''</p>
        <p>Of course, it was impossible to hear anything Tuesday, due to the expensive new sound system that some baseball-hating lunkhead in the Mets' hierarchy imported for the postseason.</p>
        <p>There is a theory, rampant in sporting circles, that their target fans are preverbal young louts who need to be stimulated by idiocies every second.</p>
        <p>Heaven forbid you should turn to your neighbor and say, ''I'd play the infield in.'' There's no thinking in baseball. For one unpleasant night on Tuesday, the Mets actually outdid the aural assault perpetrated nightly in Yankee Stadium.</p>
        <p>Fortunately, one grumpy old man complained about the barrage. His name was Nelson Doubleday. Wednesday they turned it down just enough that you could hear interlopers chanting, ''Let's go, Yankees!''</p>
        <p>The players noticed. They were not making excuses. But they noticed.</p>
        <p>Will heads roll at Shea because of the assault by loudspeaker or the ticket bungle? It is hard to imagine any synchronized action since the owners are not exactly on the same page, or even in the same universe. Fred Wilpon has a lovely mock-up of a new stadium, complete with an Ebbets Field-style rotunda, that he wants to erect next to Shea. But Doubleday says, balderdash, we can fix up the old place.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Steinbrenner has not yet been able to take advantage of the Yankee obsession in City Hall to do anything constructive about the next Yankee ball park.</p>
        <p>What a group. Yet somehow, the New York owners -- made even more brilliant by oodles of New York cable loot -- have put together two compelling teams that thrilled the city from March through October, for a memorable week that ended with a lusty cheer of ''Yankee Baseball! Yankee Baseball!'' in the Mets' home.</p>
        <p>Chomp. Chomp. Chomp.</p>
