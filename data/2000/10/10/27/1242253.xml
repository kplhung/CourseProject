        <p>A year ago, BigStar Entertainment looked as if it was living up to its name.</p>
        <p>The New York City dot-com had just raised more than $20 million from investors excited by its plan to sell movies over the Internet. Some of its executives were paper millionaires. And with its offbeat advertising generating that all-important buzz, BigStar seemed well on its way to becoming a leading light in the city's Silicon Alley.</p>
        <p>Today, BigStar is in big trouble. It has burned through much of the money it raised, dismissed about 70 of its 110 employees, and may soon be kicked off Nasdaq because its stock is now trading  for pennies. David Friedensohn, 39, the company's  chief executive, says he thinks BigStar still has enough money to hang in there. But, he said, ''I can't make any promises.''</p>
        <p>BigStar has plenty of company. In the last few months, Silicon Alley's dot-coms have laid off about 3,000 people. They have given up acres of office space. A couple have gone bankrupt, and more seem headed that way. Even the big fish in the pond, DoubleClick, has announced that its revenues are likely to fall as Internet advertising drops (its stock, of course, has plunged).</p>
        <p>All this is quite a comedown for an industry that held itself up as the hottest -- and coolest -- business sector in New York City. Just a few months ago, a report commissioned by the New York New Media Association, a trade association, said that interactive cyberbusinesses employed more than 100,000 people in the city and were ''rapidly challenging many other traditional New York industry sectors as an essential cornerstone of the growth of the regional economy.''</p>
        <p>Or maybe not. The good news, perhaps, is that Silicon Alley is still not big enough to have much effect on the city's overall economic health.</p>
        <p>''As a share of income and employment, it's 2 or 3 percent,'' said Jason Bram, an economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. ''That's not bad, but Wall Street accounts for 20 percent of income in the city,'' not including all the lawyers and accountants and temps and black-car drivers and bartenders who, one way or another, work for Wall Street.</p>
        <p>Even economists who think Silicon Alley is important to the city's economy say the dot-com meltdown has had little measurable effect on overall jobs or unemployment data, at least so far. ''We actually don't have too much weakness yet,'' said John Tepper Marlin, chief economist for Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi.</p>
        <p>And for people looking for commercial real estate, the dot-com decline is actually a good thing. ''So far, it has not had any negative effect, but a positive effect,'' said L. Craig Lemle, corporate managing director at Julien J. Studley, a commercial real estate broker. ''The market is so tight many people cannot find places, and this is returning much needed space.''</p>
        <p>However you define Silicon Alley -- and some people define it so broadly as to include practically everyone in the city who uses a computer at work -- the industry was embraced by government officials. The Giuliani administration set up several programs to help foster dot-coms. Digital NYC strives to bring cyberbusinesses to Harlem and the boroughs outside Manhattan, while another program sponsors specially wired buildings in lower Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Now, those same government officials are less likely to talk about the economic benefits of Silicon Alley; in fact, they play down its importance.</p>
        <p>It ''is a facet of the city's economy, it is not the singular driving force,'' said Robert M. Harding, the deputy mayor for economic development and finance. ''You monitor it and encourage it, and encourage people to come and stay like other industries, but it is only part of the overall economic development policy of the city.''</p>
        <p>Part of the appeal of Silicon Alley to the public sector was that encouraging the technology industry would diversify an economy that was heavily dependent on Wall Street. But as it turned out, the most troubled denizens of Silicon Alley had less to do with technology than with raising and spending other people's money -- which is to say, with Wall Street.</p>
        <p>Enthusiasm among investors (and therefore investment bankers) for anything related to the Internet -- no matter how goofy -- helped create many of Manhattan's dot-com companies.</p>
        <p>Last year alone, venture capitalists -- the investors who finance fledgling companies -- poured $1.5 billion into New York City companies, according to the VentureOne Corporation, a research company in San Francisco. That's only 10 percent of the amount of money that surged into Silicon Valley, but it was more than triple the amount that New York companies got in 1998.</p>
        <p>One reason these financiers were willing to spend so much was their confidence that they could quickly recoup their investments -- and then some. That was because stock market investors were willing to pay huge amounts for stock that venture capitalists got on the cheap. In fact, investors seemed happy to fling money at companies that they could not understand (''We supply resource-rich sync solutions in the optical space''), that had never earned a penny, and that did not plan to make money for years. Last year, New York Internet companies raised almost $3.8 billion in initial public offerings, according to Thomson Financial Securities Data.</p>
        <p>The stock market party came to an abrupt end last spring, as investors suddenly slapped themselves on their collective forehead and said, ''What were we thinking?'' The Nasdaq composite index, which is heavy on tech stocks, has plunged 38 percent since its high last March. Silicon Alley stocks have been hit even harder, dropping 53 percent from their spring peak.</p>
        <p>Now, it seems that no one on Wall Street will touch Internet stocks with a barge pole. New York City companies have raised a mere $150 million in the stock market since April. More than a dozen companies here, including The New York Times Company, have postponed or withdrawn Internet-related stock offerings.</p>
        <p>This cycle is typical of Wall Street, and has been for decades, said Charles R. Geisst, a finance professor at Manhattan College and the author of ''Wall Street: A History''  (Oxford University Press, 1997). ''They did it with rocket fuel companies after Sputnik went up,'' he said. ''Everything that looked like it had any potential got financed; 80 percent of it falls by the wayside.''</p>
        <p>As a result of the drought on Wall Street, venture capital has become scarce, at least compared with  earlier this year. ''New York is being hit worst,'' said Bill Tucker, president of the Elevator Club, a networking group. ''The people who are being hurt the most are the ones who are overexposed. I am just telling people to lay low and weather the storm.''</p>
        <p>Even within the high-tech business, some people say that the problems in Silicon Alley were neither unexpected nor undeserved. Last year was a bubble, ''like the front end of the Dutch tulip problem,'' said Bruce E. Bernstein, president of the New York Software Industry Association. ''The technology sector is not going to go away, instead it will shake out some of the most extravagant pure Internet plays.''</p>
        <p>New technology companies are still springing up all over New York City -- but most of them are focused on things like computer animation, optical switching and gene sequencing, said Ken Perlin, director of the Center for Advanced Technology at New York University.</p>
        <p>''There isn't this whole idea that we'll hire a bunch of young kids and throw money at them and write a business plan later,'' he said. While he still sees companies that are more interested in throwing parties than in turning profits, he added: ''I worry about them. That's not a revenue model, that's a buzz model.''</p>
        <p>And the Internet is not going away -- it's going mainstream, like the telephone. There will still be Internet jobs, but they are likely to be at stodgy, old-fashioned companies that don't offer stock options (or in-house ping-pong tables). One joke going around is that the shorthand phrase B-to-B no longer refers to ''business-to-business''; it now means ''back to banking.''</p>
        <p>''A lot of folks who will actually make money on this are household names,'' said David S. Berry, research director of Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods, a Wall Street firm that specializes in banks and other financial institutions. ''The technology is real, and it is having a real impact -- but whether it will be wielded by start  ups with funny names is another question.''</p>
        <p>And the Silicon Alley stalwarts that survive are trying their best to cope. BigStar, for example, has cut costs so that its film Web site is breaking even, Mr. Friedensohn said, and is focusing on turning its e-mail marketing abilities into a new line of business. And like a lot of other Silicon Alley executives, he said, he is open to merging his company with another.</p>
        <p>As for no longer being a paper millionaire, Mr. Friedensohn said it did not bother him. In New York, he said, ''There's always somebody making a lot more money than you. New York keeps you humble.''</p>
