        <p>The Nets did not make any roster moves yesterday before leaving for Cincinnati for tonight's final exhibition game. They have until 6 p.m. Monday to set their final roster. That is the final time teams can set their 15-man roster with 12 active players. The Nets assumed a small financial burden, possibly up to $10,000, since it takes 48 business hours for players to clear waivers.</p>
        <p>The team must pay whomever they eventually waive a prorated fee for two days, or one day if they choose to waive a player today.</p>

        <p>The Nets did not make any roster moves yesterday before leaving for Cincinnati for tonight's final exhibition game. They have until 6 p.m. Monday to set their final roster. That is the final time teams can set their 15-man roster with 12 active players. The Nets assumed a small financial burden, possibly up to $10,000, since it takes 48 business hours for players to clear waivers.</p>
        <p>The team must pay whomever they eventually waive a prorated fee for two days, or one day if they choose to waive a player today.</p>
        <p>The rookie free agents Stephen Jackson and Kevin Freeman, along with the four-year journeyman guard Kevin Ollie are vying for the final roster spot. Jackson has had the best training camp of the three. The team's second-round draft pick, 7-foot Soumaila Samake, has a partly guaranteed contract.</p>
        <p>In addition, Coach Byron Scott is still deciding what to do about his overcrowded backup point guard position.</p>
        <p>''It's a tough decision,'' Scott said. ''I want to make sure I give everybody the opportunity they deserve.</p>
        <p>He spoke with, Rod Thorn, the Nets' president, who agreed to allow Scott to take the extra players with him to Cincinnati.</p>
        <p>Kenyon Martin, who starred at the University of Cincinnati for four years, will receive the keys to the city at a noon ceremony. ''It's not that big a deal,'' he said. ''I'll probably just go back to my room and get ready. I still have to play the game.''</p>
        <p>Martin ended his collegiate career in agony, breaking his right fibula in a Conference U.S.A. tournament game in Memphis. ''I think if I hadn't ended my career that way, they wouldn't have done all this,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Also yesterday, the Nets said center Jim McIlvaine did not make the trip to Cleveland because of a stomach virus.</p>
