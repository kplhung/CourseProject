        <p>Andersen Consulting said yesterday that it would be known as Accenture beginning in January. The new corporate name was required by an arbitrator's decision, announced in August, separating the consulting company from its parent, the tax and auditing firm Arthur Andersen. According to Joe W. Forehand, the chief executive of Andersen Consulting, the company plans to consider a partial public offering of its shares. The new name is part of Andersen's effort to present itself as a professional services company that can carry out the business proposals it presents to clients.</p>
