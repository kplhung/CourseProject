        <p>GASOLINE prices may rise, and the bubble of dot-com wealth may wobble precariously, but European makers of powerful cars for the powerfully wealthy are proceeding as if only the smooth roads of conspicuous consumption lay ahead. They are planning a new wave of muscular, luxurious cars that eclipse their predecessors in size and power and often evoke the legends of automotive history.</p>
        <p>Oddly, the push is coming not just from companies that have historically fed the high end of the car market, like Mercedes-Benz and Porsche, but from the likes of Fiat and Volkswagen, carmakers associated with small, fuel-efficient models.</p>
        <p>In recent years, VW has acquired some of Europe's most tradition-laden car brands, including Bentley, Bugatti and Lamborghini. Since it bought the Bugatti name two years ago, VW has rolled out concept cars with unusual names and shapes -- and jarring projected price tags. Lamborghini, now under the umbrella of VW's Audi division, plans a successor next summer to the brutish Diablo, and Audi is studying a possible sports model with the code name Project Rosemeyer, based on the designs of Audi's Silver Arrow racing cars of the 1930's. The name evokes a legendary driver of that era, Bernd Rosemeyer.</p>
        <p>Not to be outdone, Mercedes has announced that it will build the SLR, a sleek sports car in the tradition of its SL's of the 50's. At the recent auto show here, Porsche unveiled what may eventually be the top of its line, a low-slung roadster called the Carrera GT, with a top speed of more than 200 miles an hour.</p>
        <p>Partly, the wave of luxury sports cars is a result of the industry's consolidation, as mass carmakers like VW and Fiat vacuumed up brands with oversized reputations and, in some cases, troubles to match. Fiat now owns most of Italy's legendary names, including Alfa Romeo, Maserati and Ferrari. In 1998, VW acquired rights to Bugatti, after an Italian businessman's efforts to revive the brand, with a Bugatti sports car built in Italy, ended in bankruptcy.</p>
        <p>Ettore Bugatti, the flamboyant Italian-born designer, had built cars for Europe's gilded set between the world wars, and VW has restored the Bugatti family mansion, Chateau St.-Jean, near Strasbourg, France, and plans a factory nearby.</p>
        <p>At the Tokyo auto show last year, VW unveiled the Bugatti Veyron, named for Pierre Veyron, an early Bugatti race driver, that featured a monstrous 6.3-liter, 18-cylinder engine. Earlier, VW had shown a model called the Chiron, named for another Bugatti driver, Louis Chiron, that had been designed by Giorgetto and Fabrizio Giugiaro.</p>
        <p>At the recent Paris auto show, the Veyron was back, now with a 16-cylinder engine -- it seems that 18 had proved difficult to cool -- and VW says it could begin hand-building about 50 Veyrons a year by 2003, at a price of about $455,000 each.</p>
        <p>But VW's plans do not end with Bugatti. After securing the Bentley brand with its acquisition of Rolls-Royce Motor Cars two years ago, VW introduced a low-slung,  midengine prototype at the Geneva auto show. Called the Bentley Hunaudieres -- named for a famed straightaway on the legendary Le Mans race course -- it had a bizarre W-shaped 16-cylinder engine, essentially consisting of two V8's fitted side by side and sharing a crankshaft. Last year, Bentley took the Hunaudieres on tour in the United States to gauge buyer interest, but it says there are currently no plans to build it.</p>
        <p>By venturing into powerful cars like these, VW's chairman, Ferdinand Piech, is playing in family history. By testing a Bugatti with an 18-cylinder engine, Mr. Piech appeared to be challenging the prowess of his grandfather, Ferdinand Porsche, the auto pioneer who designed the Beetle.</p>
        <p>In the 1930's, Ferdinand Porsche had stuck a 16-cylinder engine in an Audi racecar. Indeed, in a yellowing photo from the 1920's that adorned Bugatti's stand at the Paris show, Ferdinand Porsche and Ettore Bugatti stood side by side at a race course in Italy. Curiously, Bugatti and the founder of Bentley, Walter Owen Bentley, were rivals between the wars. Bugatti, whose Type 41, dubbed La Royale, was a model of elegance, once maligned Bentley's more robust cars as the ''fastest trucks in the world.''</p>
        <p>VW is also moving upscale with its core brand, planning the D1, a direct competitor to the Mercedes S-Class sedan in the $80,000 range. And in 2003, Mercedes will bring back a storied name in coachbuilding, Maybach, for a line of ultraluxury sedans that will compete with Rolls-Royce at prices approaching $400,000.</p>
        <p>In comparison with VW's plans in the supercar segment, the Mercedes SLR seems modest. In concept form, the SLR had a 5.5-liter supercharged V-8 engine capable of accelerating from zero to 60 miles an hour in just 4 seconds, and to 120 m.p.h. in 11 seconds. It also had oddities like doors that swung up 75 degrees when opened. Mercedes plans to assemble the SLR in Britain with its Grand Prix partner, McLaren, in 2003. As many as 650 would be sold annually for $300,000 each.</p>
        <p>For mass manufacturers, such projects can burnish the images of their everyday cars. ''They're saying, 'We need a flagship, a really high-tech item that hits out,' '' said Nigel Griffiths, an analyst at Standard &amp; Poor's DRI. But with all these models coming to market, the risk of a glut increases. ''If you add all of them up, the Lamborghinis and the Bugattis and so on,'' Mr. Griffiths said, ''it's difficult to see that the scale of the market is going to expand at the rate everyone is taking products there.''</p>
        <p>That has not fazed Porsche, which drove a prototype of the Carrera GT down the Champs Elysees, then formally presented it in front of the soaring glass pyramid in the elegant courtyard of the Louvre. Featuring a 5.5-liter V-10 with a six-speed transmission in a low-slung carbon-fiber body, the Carrera GT boasts playful extras like a video camera that emerges behind the driver at the touch of a button to film the road ahead. If interest suffices, Porsche says production could start in 2003 with a retail price of around $350,000.</p>
        <p>The Carrera GT is a gamble. Though sales of its sports cars are booming, Porsche is pouring $450 million into developing its first sport utility vehicle, the Cayenne, which will debut as a 2002 model, probably for well under $100,000. And unlike its bigger competitors, Porsche cannot afford to write off money-losing vehicles as promotional expenses.</p>
        <p>''Others may be trying to create value for their brands,'' said Detlev von Platen, who heads Porsche's sales offensive in the lucrative French region, which includes pockets of affluence like Paris and Monte Carlo. ''If we do it, it will be only if it makes a profit.''</p>
