        <p>I'm looking out the window of my hotel room, and the first thing I see is the Eiffel Tower, which seems to have lost its bearings. For some reason, it's straddling the Louvre and the Palais Garnier. I can also see the Great Pyramid, the Statue of Liberty, the Bridge of Sighs and the Imperial Palace.</p>
        <p>As I look, I'm sipping a wee breakfast bracer, described on the room-service menu as a Corpse Reviver (no, I'm not making this up). It contains gin, Pernod, Lillet, Cointreau and lemon juice.</p>

        <p>I'm looking out the window of my hotel room, and the first thing I see is the Eiffel Tower, which seems to have lost its bearings. For some reason, it's straddling the Louvre and the Palais Garnier. I can also see the Great Pyramid, the Statue of Liberty, the Bridge of Sighs and the Imperial Palace.</p>
        <p>As I look, I'm sipping a wee breakfast bracer, described on the room-service menu as a Corpse Reviver (no, I'm not making this up). It contains gin, Pernod, Lillet, Cointreau and lemon juice.</p>
        <p>Tonight I'm planning to take my wife, Betsey, to watch a couple of crazies named Siegfried and Roy prance around a stage with their white tigers.</p>
        <p>Where am I? Well, it ain't Dubuque, Jack. Or Muskogee, either.</p>
        <p>And that's the whole point of Las Vegas. Unlike your ordinary city, this one is an enterprise built upon excess, where subtlety and understatement are orphans and nothing is quite what it seems. Travel a block or two from the gaudy rialto called the Strip and you come upon dilapidated motels, seedy apartments and raw, undeveloped land. From that vantage point, you see the big hotel-casinos for what they are: movie sets built in the vast Nevada desert.</p>
        <p>But of course. Las Vegas is selling escapism to ordinary folk like the 42 people from Pocahontas, Iowa, whom I met here once. They save their pennies every year for a long weekend of 25-cent slot machines, hotel buffets ($5.95 for all you can eat or, for that matter, lift) and a show or two -- ''the only entertainment we get all year,'' one of them said. The city's statistics show how much it depends upon working people, not plutocrats: 61 percent of visitors have no college degree.</p>
        <p>Las Vegas also appeals, in the words of J. Terrence Lanni, the chairman of MGM-Mirage Inc., which owns several of the classier resorts here, to ''the guy who's got plenty of money, wants to show it, but can't get into the country club, maybe because he's in the scrap-iron business.'' And it appeals mightily to the high roller from Dusseldorf or Hong Kong or Hollywood, who comes here to do things that for one reason or another he feels he cannot do at home.</p>
        <p>''You can have a great time there,'' said Philip Treacy, the London milliner who makes many of the loopy hats that women wear to Ascot, ''because you never meet anyone that you know.''</p>
        <p>Las Vegas is a never-ending party that has gained a new sophistication in the last decade. A 21st-century human comedy, it is thronged by all sorts of people -- well dressed, badly dressed and barely dressed. If you don't much like gambling, says Betsey, who doesn't, you just shut out the constant ding-click-clank of the slots and enjoy all the many things they subsidize.</p>
        <p>A Restaurant Boom</p>
        <p>The new marketing slogan of the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority is, ''Do what you want, when you want.'' Vegas -- not even hayseeds use the ''Las'' -- pulls them in these days not only with gambling but also with luxury shopping worthy of Rodeo Drive, and world-class restaurants, some of which move millions of dollars worth of wine every year. Not to mention golf and year-round sunshine.</p>
        <p>Top restaurateurs from around the country have invested here, though few have moved to Nevada. Todd English from Boston, Mark Miller from Santa Fe, Michael Mina from San Francisco, Ella Brennan from New Orleans, Nobu Matsuhisa from Los Angeles and Sirio Maccioni from New York have all cloned their establishments in the desert, along with a score of other big names.</p>
        <p>Soon, predicted Sig Rogich, a well-connected Las Vegas public-relations man who once worked in the Bush White House, legitimate theaters will be built here to house major musicals.</p>
        <p>Gambling (or ''gaming,'' to use the local euphemism) accounted for only 54 percent of tourist revenues last year, down from 62 percent 10 years ago, although three of four people who set foot here gamble at least a little. Rooms and food, once strictly loss leaders, are now profit centers.</p>
        <p>Of course, they still build hotels with no chairs in the lobbies, no clocks and no windows in the casinos, and no route from the front door to the elevators except through the casinos. Business is still business.</p>
        <p>Yes, People Also Live Here</p>
        <p>In addition to 35 million visitors a year -- ''that's like loading the whole population of Spain onto a plane,'' as Madrid-born Julian Serrano, the city's reigning chef, remarked wonderingly -- Las Vegas also attracts an endless stream of new residents, drawn by relatively low taxes, inexpensive housing and plentiful jobs.</p>
        <p>Nevada has been the nation's fastest-growing state, and Las Vegas its fastest-growing city, for some years now. The city's population in 1940 was 8,422; by 1999, 1.4 million people lived in the metropolitan area, more than 15 percent of them Hispanic.</p>
        <p>The newcomers come from everywhere. On one October weekend, I met a bellman from Cranbury, N.J., near Princeton; a casino cashier from Shanghai; a taxi driver from Tulsa, Okla.; and a drugstore clerk from Amman, Jordan.</p>
        <p>''People come to Las Vegas and the slate is clean,'' said a local television anchor, Paula Francis, in a recent piece in Las Vegas Life magazine. ''Whether you were high and mighty before, or lowdown and scratching for a living, you come here and start over again. No one looks at your pedigree or your jail record. You start anew.''</p>
        <p>By now, Las Vegas has more than 500 churches; seven full-fledged hospitals with dozens of doctors specializing in breast augmentation; nascent youth gangs; the highest suicide rate in the nation (18.91 per 100,000 people); one of the busiest airports in the country; a vigorous young symphony orchestra; and a university, the University of Nevada-Las Vegas, that is known far and wide for its unusually aggressive pursuit of young men who are good at putting the basketball into the net.</p>
        <p>Las Vegas also affords ample opportunity for escape. Formed by 726-foot-high Hoover Dam, which took 3.25 million cubic yards of concrete to build, Lake Mead is the largest freshwater reservoir in the world, ideal for boating and fishing. The Grand Canyon is not far beyond, and you can see it from a helicopter. In the other direction, beautiful Death Valley beckons, not dead at all but vibrant with surreal color and dazzling, platinum-colored light.</p>
        <p>Vital, you may say, but vulgar. Well, yes and no, as the politicians and the lawyers like to say.</p>
        <p>Sure, Vegas is the capital city of bad taste -- gaudy and garish, tacky and trashy, bedizened with gilt and rouge and spangles. It is as cheesy as Gorgonzola. It is so far over the top that it occasionally laughs at itself.  In the shopping arcade at Caesars Palace, a casino-hotel with enough ersatz Roman statuary to make J. Paul Getty himself drool with envy, the sign outside the Warner Brothers shop reads, ''Warnerius Fraternius Studius Storius.''</p>
        <p>The dancer and entertainer Tommy Tune gets paid $100,000 a week for starring in the MGM Grand Hotel's nightly extravaganza, ''EFX.'' When Priscilla Presley came to her high school reunion at the New Frontier recently, she had her Lincoln Continental flown in from Beverly Hills. The Barbary Coast sells 64-ounce margaritas, and Paris Las Vegas, not to be outdone, sells strawberry margaritas to go in 18-inch-tall plastic replicas of the Eiffel Tower.</p>
        <p>Some of the best entertainment is free: a bride charging through a casino at 2 p.m. in a snow-white wedding dress, with her mother in hot pursuit and her husband, pushing the baby in his stroller, struggling to keep up; a couple in late middle age soberly discussing the merits of Vegas and Paris as vacation sites and deciding that the Jersey Shore is much better than either.</p>
        <p>As everyone knows, the city's most popular cultural attraction is the Liberace Museum, where the visitor can see his minks, his cars, his pianos and of course, his candelabra. If that isn't your thing, you can take a drive down to Whiskey Pete's Hotel and Casino in Primm, 35 miles south of here, which presents for your delectation ''the bullet-riddled Ford where Bonnie and Clyde came to their bloody end.''</p>
        <p>As everyone knows, the nightclubs, which once featured the likes of Frank Sinatra and his Rat Pack buddy Sammy Davis Jr., as well as Marlene Dietrich and Noel Coward, now rely on entertainers who are more than a little long in the tooth, like Rodney Dangerfield, Wayne Newton, Jerry Lewis and (forgive me the lapse in gallantry) Debbie Reynolds. Only occasionally do the Joe Cockers and Tina Turners of this world show up, and it is said to have cost $10 million to lure Barbra Streisand to the MGM Grand Hotel for a millennium concert.</p>
        <p>As everyone knows, Las Vegas is where a hard case named Mike Tyson took a bite or two out of the ear of Evander Holyfield, his pugilistic rival.</p>
        <p>But high culture is slowly sticking its head above the parapet in Vegas, if you know where to look for it and you don't define it too snootily.</p>
        <p>Philharmonic at the Mall</p>
        <p>Take the Las Vegas Philharmonic. When we went on a shopping expedition to the Fashion Show Mall, an upscale mall anchored by no less than five department stores (soon to be joined by a sixth, Bloomingdale's), the strains of Bach's ''Sheep May Safely Graze'' led us to a string ensemble drawn from the orchestra's ranks. Saks, it turned out, was sponsoring an afternoon concert in the atrium.</p>
        <p>''Las Vegas has a reputation for having no culture,'' said Susan Tompkins, one of the orchestra's founders, along with Harold Weller, its music director. ''We're trying to change that. But people don't know about us, so we go to them. Besides our regular schedule, we play here and we play in schools.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Tompkins, chic, good-humored and born in Britain, told us that finding good musicians hereabouts was no problem. The town, she said, ''is full of them, a lot of them left over from the Sinatra days, when you didn't get work if you couldn't sight read everything.'' This season, the orchestra's second, it opened with Angel Romero, the Spanish guitarist, as guest soloist.</p>
        <p>Or take ''O,'' the extraordinary show at the Bellagio hotel, which fills 1,800 seats 10 times a week. An unlikely combination of circus and ballet, theater and pantomime, with synchronized swimming thrown in, ''O'' is a production of the Canadian troupe Cirque du Soleil that is performed in, around and above an enormous water tank. (''O'' equals ''eau'' -- geddit?) Pucci-like costumes, wondrous stage machinery and propulsive music lend it the same superb sense of spectacle that ''Miss Saigon'' brought to Broadway and the West End. Only an irredeemable snob could deny that this is a theatrical triumph of the first order.</p>
        <p>It is no accident that ''O'' is at the Bellagio. Steve Wynn, the son of an unsuccessful small-time gambler who ran Sunday bingo games in the Washington suburbs, created the Bellagio, and he is a man of no small dreams. A famous talker, he once said he wanted to build things that God would have built ''if only he'd had the money.''</p>
        <p>High-Rolling Investors</p>
        <p>Mr. Wynn, 58, talked with me about Las Vegas, past and present, in his office at the Desert Inn, with a Warhol portrait of himself on the wall and a gentle German shepherd named Paolo at his side. ''Socially acceptable crooks,'' most of them Jews financed by Italian-Americans, wrote Chapter 1 in the city's history, he said. Then came the first theme resort, Caesars Palace, inspired by the Fontainebleau in Miami and built by Jay Sarno, an Atlanta developer, partly with money from Jimmy Hoffa's Teamsters. And then, Mr. Wynn said, ''nothing -- nothing but a lot of boxes of rooms on top of boxes of slot machines, without a speck of style in sight.''</p>
        <p>He added: ''This has always been a place where stupid people could make more money than they could make anywhere else. Thirty percent, easy.''</p>
        <p>In 1989 Mr. Wynn set out to do something different. He built the Mirage, with 3,000 rooms and a fake volcano out front, hoping to capitalize on what he calls ''the wonder factor.'' The idea, he explained, was ''the same as the old circus sideshow -- something exotic to lure them into the main tent.''</p>
        <p>Having done that, Mr. Wynn reinvented Las Vegas in 1998 with the Bellagio, a $6.7 billion extravaganza packed with big-name restaurants and evidence of his passion for art.</p>
        <p>His former office there had a Rothko and a Rembrandt, among other ornaments, and walls made of the same burled walnut used on the dashboards of Rolls-Royces. An array of innovative fountains was installed in a 254-foot arc in front of the hotel, where the waters swing and sway every night to the strains of Copland's ''Simple Gifts.'' And Mr. Wynn installed a $300 million collection of modern paintings, including pieces by van Gogh and Matisse, in an art gallery -- a kunsthalle amid the crap tables.</p>
        <p>He reached too far. Shares in his company sank, shareholders moaned, and predators sensed an opportunity. Kirk Kerkorian, the Hollywood financier, bought Mr. Wynn out, took control of the casinos and sold most of the pictures, except for those that had belonged to Mr. Wynn, which went to his house.</p>
        <p>Venturi Then, Koolhaas Now</p>
        <p>But art and Las Vegas have proved a better match than most anticipated (though perhaps not the architects Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown, who argued 25 years ago that their trade had a lot to learn from Las Vegas, notably from its flamboyant neon signs). The Bellagio Gallery of Fine Art now displays traveling exhibitions (26 modern masterworks from the Phillips Collection in Washington have been drawing 7,500 visitors a week at $12 each and will be up through March 4).</p>
        <p>Seeking to go the Bellagio one better, the Venetian Hotel has hired Rem Koolhaas, the Dutch architect, to design a pair of exhibition spaces in which the Guggenheim Museum and the State Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, Russia, have agreed to show rotating selections from their collections. At first, said Thomas Krens, the Guggenheim's director, he thought the idea ''too tacky,'' but a visit to the Bellagio gallery in its early days changed his mind.</p>
        <p>And what of Mr. Wynn? He has bought the Desert Inn and most of the 218 acres behind it. He plans to pull it down, build a newer, grander hotel -- ''a place of ideal beauty and comfort,'' he called it -- and entice other developers to build apartments and casino-less hotels to feed customers to his place.</p>
        <p>''I guess that I've got developer's disease,'' he said sheepishly.</p>
        <p>Las Vegas was turned into a not-so-stately pleasure dome by the hoodlum Bugsy Siegel, and a certain air of moral iniquity clings to it to this day. A lot of other hoods followed Siegel to town, like Moe Dalitz from Cleveland, but things started changing when the reclusive, eccentric billionaire Howard Hughes arrived at 4 a.m. on Nov. 27, 1966. He took over the eighth and ninth floors of the Desert Inn, and as Christmas and New Year's approached the management asked him to leave so they could accommodate seasonal high rollers. Instead, he bought the place.</p>
        <p>Overt mob influence lessened as he bought other hotels and Nevada got a bit pickier about hoteliers. ''A lot of the original casino owners couldn't get drivers' licenses in Nevada today, let alone gaming licenses,'' one license-holder told me.</p>
        <p>Criminal influence has declined sharply, but it has not disappeared; gangland figures were suspected in the mysterious 1999 murder of Ted Binion, a defrocked casino operator, although nothing was ever proved.  Las Vegas remains a place of cheap booze, easy sex and omnipresent opportunities to be separated from one's dollars in games of ''chance'' in which the house seldom loses.</p>
        <p>Sin Sells</p>
        <p>Sin sells. Sin is fun. Mr. Lanni of  MGM-Mirage, a clean-cut professional manager with two degrees from the University of Southern California, told me that ''Las Vegas wouldn't be Las Vegas without at least the appearance of sin.'' Most Americans gamble, one way or another, but many feel a little ashamed of it, which is perhaps why Mr. Lanni added, ''If my mother had been alive when I came into this business, I probably wouldn't have.''</p>
        <p>A hint of sin is surely what brings the foreigners to Las Vegas in droves. Direct flights land here daily or weekly from Tokyo Narita, London Gatwick, Frankfurt, Paris, even Edmonton, Alberta. But it's easy to overstate this kind of thing. For the most part, what Las Vegas offers is a not very sinister form of sin, tame enough for grannies in wheelchairs, clutching their plastic coin cups at the nickel machines.</p>
        <p>Tame enough, furthermore, for more than 2,500 conventions a year, including those of groups conscious of their reputations for probity, including the National League of Cities, the National Association of Attorneys General and numerous church bodies. The largest is Comdex, the leading information-technology show, which attracts 200,000 people each fall. The convention center here is adding an additional 1.25 million square feet, which will vault it past McCormick Place in Chicago and make it the biggest in the country.</p>
        <p>Legitimate Enough, Thanks</p>
        <p>In recent years both major political parties, which are image-conscious to the point of neurosis, have approached Las Vegas to bid on their conventions. Las Vegas declined, according to Manuel Cortez, president of the convention authority, because delegates, journalists and hangers-on would displace regular hotel guests who spend more.</p>
        <p>But surely, I suggested, national political conventions would definitively legitimize the city at last.</p>
        <p>''I think we're already there,'' he said, ''although some might disagree. It's difficult to be morally incensed about Vegas when almost everyone in the United States lives within 200 miles of some form of gaming. Gaming is legal now, in casinos or elsewhere, in every state except Utah and Hawaii.''</p>
        <p>In fact, people here worry that the Internet and new Indian gambling establishments in Southern California will steal some of the action.</p>
        <p>To maintain its edge, said Mark Dodson, executive vice president of Park Place Entertainment, the nation's biggest casino operator, Las Vegas needs better marketing, better use of technology and more modern management techniques. Mr. Dodson, a soft-spoken former auditor for Ernst &amp; Young, said the city was still in the grip of an ''old-time mom-and-pop mentality.''</p>
        <p>People worry about other things as well. Growth has its darker side. It brings traffic jams, long lines at the supermarket, crowded schools and an inadequate tax base to do very much very quickly about an overstressed infrastructure. Retirees are the largest group among those moving here. Some buy million-dollar houses at Lake Las Vegas, a few miles east of the Strip. Having paid their dues in states where they spent their working lives, they are loath to pay much more than the bare minimum in property taxes in Nevada.</p>
        <p>The Ultimate Illusion</p>
        <p>Then there is water. This is the desert, after all. While there is water beneath the city -- it was founded because of springs here, and the area proved rich in artesian wells -- and while Lake Mead offers countless gallons close at hand, there are limits. Las Vegas is currently confident of adequate supplies only until 2030.</p>
        <p>Still, the city consumes the stuff with abandon, not only on lawns and in showers but as an integral part of Vegas dazzle. The tank in which the  damsels of ''O'' swim each evening holds 1.5 million gallons, no less.</p>
        <p>Early on, the place flaunted its hot, dry climate with hotels named the Dunes, the Sands and the Sahara. But the ultimate illusion, perhaps, is bringing the sea to the desert, so now you will find a ''rain forest'' and several waterfalls at the Mirage (the name is no accident), a ''shark reef'' aquarium at Mandalay Bay, a ''Grand Canal'' at the Venetian and of course all those remarkable fountains at the Bellagio.</p>
        <p>They like to gamble here.</p>
