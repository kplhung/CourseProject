        <p>Las Vegas is 2,530 miles southwest of New York City. A sampling of attractions, along with travel information:</p>
        <p>Where to Stay</p>
        <p>BELLAGIO, 3600 Las Vegas Boulevard South, (702) 693-7444. This is the epicenter of the Strip, and hence of Las Vegas. The 3,000 rooms are beautifully furnished in subdued tones of beige (subdued! in Vegas!). The lobby ceiling is an explosion of Dale Chihuly glass. And nothing equals the eight-acre lake and its captivating water-cannon fountains, which shoot columns of spray into the air like rockets and dance as if Busby Berkeley were in charge. Double rooms: $159 to $750.</p>

        <p>Las Vegas is 2,530 miles southwest of New York City. A sampling of attractions, along with travel information:</p>
        <p>Where to Stay</p>
        <p>BELLAGIO, 3600 Las Vegas Boulevard South, (702) 693-7444. This is the epicenter of the Strip, and hence of Las Vegas. The 3,000 rooms are beautifully furnished in subdued tones of beige (subdued! in Vegas!). The lobby ceiling is an explosion of Dale Chihuly glass. And nothing equals the eight-acre lake and its captivating water-cannon fountains, which shoot columns of spray into the air like rockets and dance as if Busby Berkeley were in charge. Double rooms: $159 to $750.</p>
        <p>FOUR SEASONS, 3960 Las Vegas Boulevard South, (702) 632-5000. An anomaly in Las Vegas, the Four Seasons has no casino. That eliminates the slog through the gambling hordes to reach your room and promotes a serene stay. The elegant, low-key public areas are in a separate low-rise; the 424 handsome rooms, including No. 36101, a princely suite with a matchless nighttime view up the dazzlingly lighted Strip, occupy the top floors of the Mandalay Bay Hotel's adjacent tower. The toasters in the rooms are nice, but the service is patchy. Rooms: From $225 for a standard to $625 for a suite.</p>
        <p>MIRAGE, 3400 Las Vegas Boulevard South, (702) 791-7111. Siegfried and Roy's tigers hang out in a Magic Garden just off the lobby, not far from the house volcano that ''explodes'' every 15 minutes from dusk to midnight. Stuff like that keeps the Mirage young. Its rooms have been brought up to date, and its palm-shaded, lushly planted pools offer a rare degree of privacy. Double rooms: $299 to $419.</p>
        <p>VENETIAN, 3355 Las Vegas Boulevard South, (702) 414-1000. The storied old Sands was bulldozed to make room for this 3,036-suite hotel (1,000 more are on the way). Its frescoes would make Tiepolo weep, and the gondolas plying its faux Grand Canal will make you laugh. But the rooms, less flamboyant, are among the town's best, the restaurants (Lutece from New York, Star Canyon from Dallas, Valentino from Los Angeles) carry impeccable credentials, and there is wit at work: note the copy of Caravaggio's ''Cardsharps'' above the slots. Suites: $199 to $399; after Nov. 17, from $109.</p>
        <p>Where to Eat</p>
        <p>AUREOLE, Mandalay Bay, 3950 Las Vegas Boulevard South, (702) 632-7401, scores on every count. The peerless Adam Tihany designed it, with a swan pond at one end and a 42-foot-high, steel-and-glass tower at the other. The tower holds 10,000 bottles of wine, which are fetched by black-clad ''wine angels'' who fly up, like Peter Pan, to get them. The German and Washington State collections, chosen by Andrew Vadjinia, an expert sommelier, are unmatched in this country. And Chef Joe Romano's delicate duck pot-au-feu is but one bell-ringer among many.</p>
        <p>CHINOIS, 3500 Las Vegas Boulevard South, (702) 737-9700. This Chinois, one of Wolfgang Puck's five Vegas properties, is a bit more chinois than the Santa Monica original, and it is the ideal place for a lunch break. The comic-strip Hiroshiges behind the bar help to set a casual, lighthearted tone, but there is nothing lax about the cooking. The chicken satay tastes of something besides the grill, the pot stickers are tender and juicy, and the passion fruit cheesecake topped with caramelized tangerines is quite unforgettable.</p>
        <p>EMERIL'S NEW ORLEANS FISH HOUSE, 3799 Las Vegas Boulevard South, (702) 891-7374. No, fish don't swim in the desert sands, but airplanes bring them to Emeril Lagasse's local outpost six times a week from all points of the compass. Add some tasso ham, Southern greens, a puddle of grits, and bam! there you are, way down yonder in New Orleans. Black-and-white photos of Cajun country on the walls and superb wines in your glass (Grace Family cabernet, sometimes).</p>
        <p>NAPA, 3700 West Flamingo Road, (702) 247-7923. The inventive Gascon chef Jean-Louis Palladin divides his time between Las Vegas and New York, and the food here is less consistent than it was when Mr. Palladin spent more time in this kitchen. But the boldly flavored rabbit, squab and suckling pig still shine, and they provide a fine foil for the jewels of Barrie Larvin, the wine director, who spent $500,000 for bottles from the cellar of Andrew Lloyd Webber.</p>
        <p>OSTERIA DEL CIRCO, 3600 Las Vegas Boulevard South, (702) 693-8150. The room is jolly, and Mario Maccioni is a charming chip off the old block -- Sirio is his dad. But alas, the basil on the pizza had no taste and the crust was not crisp enough; it needed a brick oven, as our Naples-born waiter conceded. The white beans with shrimp were mushy. But a ''carpaccio'' of paper-thin citrus slices flavored with thyme and served with a light, barely sweetened mango sorbet made me sing.</p>
        <p>PICASSO, Bellagio, 3600 Las Vegas Boulevard South, (702) 693-7223. Without doubt the city's best restaurant, and one of the best in the nation. Julian Serrano, who put Masa's at the top of the heap in San Francisco, moved to Las Vegas for keeps to open this deluxe room, filled with originals by the Catalan master. For us, he prepared a meal of refined intensity: multicolored heirloom tomato salad with tomato sorbet, tartares of three fish, day-boat scallops with jus de veau and immaculate lamb tenderloin. Everything tasted of itself, times two.</p>
        <p>PRIME, Bellagio, 3600 Las Vegas Boulevard South, (702) 693-7223. Jean-Georges Vongerichten running a steakhouse? Yep; anything goes in Vegas. A lavish iced shellfish platter, a zesty watercress-and-red-cabbage salad dressed with ginger vinaigrette, rosy-rare steaks cut from beef hung for 21 days, proper bearnaise or bordelaise or mustard (your choice), crunchy frites, bread pudding -- a classic American Saturday-night dinner, as seen through three-star eyes.</p>
        <p>RENOIR, Mirage, 3400 Las Vegas Boulevard South, (702) 791-7111. Created by Steve Wynn for Alessandro Strata, a protege of Alain Ducasse, Renoir evokes memories of Paris three-stars with its heavily padded banquettes and walls upholstered in Provencal fabrics. We found the turbot too firm, the sweetbreads not quite firm enough, but the foie gras with pineapple was perfect and the short ribs, with a rich, winy sauce and horseradish scalloped potatoes, were a tour de force.</p>
