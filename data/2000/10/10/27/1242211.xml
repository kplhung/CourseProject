        <p>In its waning days, Congress is squandering the burgeoning budget surplus on ill-considered spending projects and tax cuts that will go primarily to those who least need help. The wastage will strip Congress of the money it needs to do anything important for years to come and will deprive the two presidential candidates of the money they need to pay for their proposals. President Clinton promised yesterday to veto the tax bill, but his veto can force fixes of only the bill's worst features.</p>
        <p>The tax bill does a few things right. It raises the minimum wage by a dollar over two years, provides more money for the low-income housing tax credit and gives teaching hospitals and skilled nursing homes desperately needed relief.</p>

        <p>In its waning days, Congress is squandering the burgeoning budget surplus on ill-considered spending projects and tax cuts that will go primarily to those who least need help. The wastage will strip Congress of the money it needs to do anything important for years to come and will deprive the two presidential candidates of the money they need to pay for their proposals. President Clinton promised yesterday to veto the tax bill, but his veto can force fixes of only the bill's worst features.</p>
        <p>The tax bill does a few things right. It raises the minimum wage by a dollar over two years, provides more money for the low-income housing tax credit and gives teaching hospitals and skilled nursing homes desperately needed relief.</p>
        <p>But most of the tax cuts are lavished on people who need no favors. The bill would provide tax deductions for the purchase of health insurance by individuals not covered by their employers. For low-income families, the provision would reduce the cost of coverage by at most 15 percent, too little to make policies affordable. But for wealthy individuals who already buy coverage, the deduction would provide windfall savings of up to 40 percent.</p>
        <p>The pension provisions are worse. The bill would raise the amount of money that individuals could deposit in I.R.A.'s and other tax-subsidized retirement accounts. This would reduce taxes for families that can afford to save the maximum amount allowed in such accounts. But it would bypass the overwhelming percentage of families that save less than the current limits allow. In addition, the bill weakens rules that require companies to offer ample benefits to low-paid workers.</p>
        <p>On the spending side of the ledger, Congress appears intent on raising discretionary spending this fiscal year to about $640 billion, about $40 billion more than its self-imposed target. The extra spending would eat more than $300 billion out of the $2 trillion surplus that is expected outside of Social Security over the next 10 years. Medicare spending, tax bills and other budget changes will knock at least $600 billion more off the surplus. That makes it impossible for a future Congress to marshal enough resources to reach important goals, like providing universal health coverage (perhaps $800 billion) and prescription drugs to Medicare enrollees ($350 billion or more).</p>
        <p>But beyond the big-ticket items, Congress is on the verge of making scores of other legislative mistakes, many without the benefit of extended discussion. The G.O.P. leadership handled dozens of controversial issues in conference committees without debate on the floor of either house that could have drawn voter support or opposition. In the last-minute rush, Congress dropped tax subsidies for low-income savers and for small businesses to start pension programs. It also dropped provisions allowing states to extend Medicaid to some pregnant women and children who are legal immigrants.</p>
        <p>However, Congress can avoid at least one monumental error if it can figure out a way to rescue the $7.8 billion plan to restore the Everglades. This plan is now trapped in bickering over an unrelated bill. It has been seven years in the making, and should not be allowed to die.</p>
