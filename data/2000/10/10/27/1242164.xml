        <p>FORTY years ago, before people started thinking of her as that woman, Yoko Ono was 27, living in New York and an admirer of John Cage, creating conceptual art: she made up haiku-like instructions to be performed or just imagined. ''Light a match and watch till it goes out.''</p>
        <p>She had a cold-water loft on the top floor at 112 Chambers Street in Lower Manhattan, art world Siberia in those days, and with La Monte Young presented a series of performances and other avant-garde events there. Not many people came. Duchamp did. So did George Maciunas, an impresario of the avant-garde, a dreamer who ran the AG Gallery. This being her loft, Ms. Ono had her paintings around the room. ''Smoke Painting'' was a canvas people were invited to burn. ''Painting to Be Stepped On'' was what it sounded like.</p>
        <p>Maciunas noticed the work and invited her to have a show, her first.</p>
        <p>The eye roll, a vestigial reflex, has the effect of not allowing you to see what is in front of you. It is understandably used these days to respond to celebrity spectacles passing themselves off as art events in local cultural establishments. Occasionally, however, you will miss something.</p>
        <p>You should bear this in mind with ''Yes Yoko Ono,'' at the Japan Society, a retrospective that starts with those early years before John Lennon wandered into Ms. Ono's show at the Indica Gallery in London in 1966, climbed the ladder to a panel she had stuck to the ceiling with ''yes'' in tiny print on it, and in that instant changed her from an obscure figure into someone whose principal medium became celebrity itself.</p>
        <p>We see her as she was then, a mischievous, wry conceptual artist with a canny sensibility, cool but not dry, sometimes sweet, even corny -- and way ahead of her time in giving acute visual form to women's issues. As well as anyone, she encapsulated an evanescent and shifting moment in art. Fame distorts, and the new show helps set the record straight.</p>
        <p>This is good, of course. Ms. Ono has taken too much abuse. It's also chastening to encounter someone you thought you knew but didn't, because in art as in life we should never take anybody for granted.</p>
        <p>Ms. Ono came from a rich Japanese banking family on her mother's side and aristocracy on her father's. Her great-grandfather was a viscount. Her grandmother married a samurai who became president of a bank.</p>
        <p>Her father wanted to be a classical pianist before he became a banker, a revealing fact. Brought up half Buddhist, half Protestant, she was trained to sing German lieder and Italian opera and took piano lessons; she went to an exclusive school for children of the imperial family along with Akihito, Hirohito's son, now the emperor, and the writer Yukio Mishima. She and her family moved next to Scarsdale, N.Y., and she enrolled at Sarah Lawrence College. Culturally speaking, she had extremely mixed experiences, all privileged and basically traditional.</p>
        <p>Her background partly explains radical performance works like ''Cut Piece'' (1965), for which she sat impassively, a kind of bodhisattva, while people slowly cut off her clothes. It was an amazing feminist manifesto before most people knew what feminism was.</p>
        <p>It's about exhibitionism and about sex, like other works she did, so in that sense it rebuffed parental mores in a predictable way. But more important is the element of ritual violence -- not quite seppuku, maybe, but some theatrical version of self-sacrifice, a recurrent theme in Ms. Ono's public life.</p>
        <p>When she had her first show at Maciunas's gallery he was coming up with the idea for Fluxus, his name designating an anarchic multimedia movement that mixed Cage, happenings, Buddhism, vaudeville, guerrilla theater -- basically everything Ms. Ono was up to then. Her contribution is underestimated. Not that she has been exactly neglected over the years. But because other artists were doing similar things at the time and maybe because she was a woman (the avant-garde was hardly less sexist than the rest of the world in the 1960's) she hasn't been assigned the role that she deserves at the conception of Fluxus.</p>
        <p>So this exhibition is useful in that sense and in others, too: attacked by Beatles fans as controlling, she is shown to be cannily gentle in these early works. They frequently entail her removing herself, stepping aside, letting someone else take over. Incompleteness, displacement and whimsy are motifs.</p>
        <p>She designed a vending machine to dispense bits of sky. For a show in Tokyo in 1962, she translated her own earlier works, like ''Smoke Painting,'' into directions written in Japanese by her husband. (She was married at the time to the composer Ichiyanagi Toshi.) Ms. Ono then photocopied what he wrote. So the work became a copy of a thing written by someone else of an idea that required a different person to complete.</p>
        <p>There's a parallel here: the composer whose work is realized only by the musicians who play it. Music is a touchstone for Ms. Ono, clearly, and throughout her career she has tried to blur the distinctions between music, performance, writing and art.</p>
        <p>Music was a connection with Lennon, never mind that her sphere was less conspicuous than his, and performance as well. It really wasn't a big leap for her to regard the spectacle of their relationship as another performance. Only the audience had changed. In the early 60's she lighted  matches onstage in front of a few dozen art addicts. By the end of the decade she climbed into bed with her husband, alerted the media and called it a ''Bed-In for Peace.''</p>
        <p>Celebrity really did become her new medium, a timely one, as it was for Andy Warhol, who invented his celebrity from scratch while she acquired it instantly. Like Warhol, she turned to films, and she made recordings -- less ephemeral than her earlier work -- that allowed her to reach more people.</p>
        <p>The music is unbearable, and let's leave it at that. The films, however, include her best achievements. Lennon collaborated and acted. They sometimes extended what she had already done: ''Film No. 5 (Smile),'' in which he simply smiles at the camera in slow motion, is connected with her earlier sculpture ''A Box of Smile.'' For ''Rape'' (it's not in the exhibition but will be screened at Japan Society), a camera crew followed an unsuspecting woman into her apartment, to her mounting alarm. Like ''Cut Piece'' it was about violation, but now Ms. Ono's and her husband's celebrity was the obvious subtext.</p>
        <p>You either meet this sort of art halfway or fail to see the point. If you're predisposed to dislike it, maybe because your life has not been the same since the Beatles busted up, don't bother.</p>
        <p>I choose to acquiesce, appreciating the lightness of spirit and often delicate edge. I halt at the 1980's, when Ms. Ono started contriving heavy sculptures about death and making bronze casts of early work, cumbrous retreads of a former gossamer self.</p>
        <p>The show ends with precise little drawings, neither here nor there. The accompanying label explains that they were done to pass the time on the telephone. Organic shapes composed of hundreds of dots, they recall the work of early Yayoi Kusama without being on Ms. Kusama's obsessive level. Celebrity incubates narcissism. It smacks of narcissism to exhibit telephone doodles in public.</p>
        <p>But that's a quibble. Ms. Ono's art is a mirror. We see ourselves in our reaction to it. ''A Box of Smile'' (open the hinged top and find your reflection in the mirror inside) may be a simple, hokey idea but it's emblematic of her best work. Smile into the mirror. It is a tiny prod toward personal enlightenment, very Zen.</p>
        <p>''Yes Yoko Ono'' remains at the Japan Society Gallery, 333 East 47th Street, Manhattan, (212) 832-1155, through Jan. 14. It travels to Minneapolis, Houston, Cambridge, Mass., Toronto and San Francisco.</p>
