        <p>The world's largest manufacturer of fiber optic components, the JDS Uniphase Corporation, said its first-quarter sales more than doubled to $786.5 million, while net income excluding acquisition costs and amortization nearly tripled to $177 million. Including acquisition costs, JDS had a loss of $1.02 billion, compared with a $113.9 million loss in the year-earlier quarter. ''Acquisitions, just like product development, are part and parcel of our strategy,'' said Jozef Straus, the chief executive of JDS Uniphase. ''I expect us to continue acquiring as we grow.'' The results, which were closely watched after jitters over sales hurt the share prices of several fiber optic companies this week, fueled active after-hours trading in JDS Uniphase stock, which fluctuated between $70.56 and $77.63 after closing regular trading at $74.44, up $3.44.</p>
