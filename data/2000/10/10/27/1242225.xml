        <p>Kissinger on Mend After Heart Attack</p>
        <p>HENRY A. KISSINGER, the former secretary of state, had a heart attack on Wednesday and was admitted to New York Weill Cornell Medical Center, which said yesterday that he was doing well.</p>
        <p>The hospital said in a statement that Mr. Kissinger, 77, had had a ''limited heart attack.'' The statement, which did not provide information on the extent to which his cardiac functions had been affected or where he had been when he was stricken, said that Mr. Kissinger ''is expected to be in the hospital for a few days.''</p>

        <p>Kissinger on Mend After Heart Attack</p>
        <p>HENRY A. KISSINGER, the former secretary of state, had a heart attack on Wednesday and was admitted to New York Weill Cornell Medical Center, which said yesterday that he was doing well.</p>
        <p>The hospital said in a statement that Mr. Kissinger, 77, had had a ''limited heart attack.'' The statement, which did not provide information on the extent to which his cardiac functions had been affected or where he had been when he was stricken, said that Mr. Kissinger ''is expected to be in the hospital for a few days.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kissinger was hospitalized in Boston in June. At the time, his office said that a small blood clot had entered an artery in his eye and impaired his vision.</p>
        <p>Aguilera Is Sued</p>
        <p>Last week the 19-year-old singer CHRISTINA AGUILERA changed managers and sued STEVEN E. KURTZ, who had guided her career since she was 16. She accused Mr. Kurtz of exerting ''undue influence'' over her business and personal dealings.</p>
        <p>Yesterday Mr. Kurtz sued her in federal court in Manhattan, accusing her of improperly trying to break a management deal that was supposed to run through 2003 at the earliest. Mr. Kurtz's suit said that since March 1999, Ms. Aguilera had earned $15 million.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kurtz, who called Ms. Aguilera's charges against him ''wholly meritless,'' said that she owed him more than $1 million in commissions (Ms. Aguilera's lawsuit, filed in Superior Court in Los Angeles, said that he had been overpaid.) Mr. Kurtz's lawsuit also said that he had lent Ms. Aguilera's fan club more than $50,000, which he said had guaranteed a salary for Ms. Aguilera's mother. Mr. Kurtz's lawsuit said that the loan had not been repaid. A spokeswoman for Ms. Aguilera referred a reporter seeking comment to IRVING AZOFF, who is also named in Mr. Kurtz's lawsuit. Mr. Azoff said that he had not seen the lawsuit.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kurtz is Ms. Aguilera's second former manager to file suit against her. In July, RUTH G. INNISS, who said she discovered Ms. Aguilera as a 12-year-old Mouseketeer, sued Ms. Aguilera in State Supreme Court in Manhattan. That case is pending, Mr. Kurtz said.</p>
        <p>Shutter-Fielder</p>
        <p>And then there was GEORGE KALINSKY, the Mets photographer who wanted to be a center fielder.</p>
        <p>With the Yankees.</p>
        <p>That was before the 1962 season, when he went to spring training with the Baltimore Orioles. ''They offered me a $30,000 contract to play with Rochester,'' he said. ''I said to myself, 'You've reached a point where they offered you a contract, but you're not big like Willie Mays. You'll end up as a better artist than a baseball player, so concentrate on your artwork.' ''</p>
        <p>He had studied industrial design at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, and had learned photography as a sideline.</p>
        <p>He has now published seven books, including ''The New York Mets: A Photographic History'' (Macmillan, 1995), and works for the Mets as well as for Madison Square Garden and the Knicks. This week's games are next week's exhibit. More than 70 photographs, from WILLIS REED at the Garden in 1970 to something from the World Series, will be sold for charity at the National Arts Club in Manhattan next week. ''Since I can't be out there in center field, this is the next best thing,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Gypsy Handoff</p>
        <p>Half a century and many robes ago, a Broadway tradition was born. Yesterday MICHAEL DURAN of ''The Music Man'' and JASON OPSAHL of ''The Full Monty'' kept it going.</p>
        <p>The tradition is for the chorus member, or ''gypsy,'' with the most credits in the last musical to open on Broadway to hand over a robe to the chorus member with the most credits in the newest.</p>
        <p>A number of robes have been retired since the tradition began. The one that Mr. Duran handed over yesterday had patches from such musicals as ''Annie Get Your Gun,'' ''Aida,'' ''The Music Man'' and ''Saturday Night Fever.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Opsahl, who has appeared in ''The Will Rogers Follies,'' ''Once Upon a Mattress'' and ''Grease,'' among other musicals, followed the ritual. He circled the stage at the Eugene O'Neill Theater before the opening performance of ''The Full Monty.''  The cast and the playwright, TERRENCE McNALLY, watched.</p>
