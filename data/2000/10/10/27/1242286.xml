        <p>A white woman from Staten Island who gave birth to a black couple's baby after an embryo mix-up at a fertility clinic was denied visiting rights to the boy yesterday by an appeals court.</p>
        <p>A five-judge appellate panel of the State Supreme Court ruled unanimously that the case was similar to ''a mix-up at the time of a hospital's discharge of two newborn infants, which should simply be corrected at once,'' rather than one in which the birth mother retained some rights.</p>
        <p>The white woman, Donna Fasano, 38, was mistakenly implanted with the embryos of Deborah Perry-Rogers and Robert Rogers of Teaneck, N.J., as well as her own embryos, by a Manhattan clinic in 1998. In December 1998, she gave birth to two boys, one black, whom she named Joseph, and one white, named Vincent. Ms. Perry-Rogers, 34, was implanted with her own embryos, but none produced a fetus.</p>
        <p>Upon learning that Mrs. Fasano had given birth to their baby, the Rogerses sought custody and won. In July 1999, a State Supreme Court justice awarded them permanent custody of their biological son, whom they renamed Akiel Rogers, and ruled that they did not have to live up to a visiting agreement they had signed with the Fasanos. But the question of whether the Fasanos retained any visiting rights remained open until yesterday.</p>
        <p>The Rogerses' lawyer, Bernard E. Clair, said that his clients wept with happiness when they heard the ruling. The Fasanos' lawyer, David Cohen, told The Associated Press that they would appeal to the state's highest court, the Court of Appeals.</p>
        <p>There were many odd and tense twists to the case. After the Rogerses were awarded custody of Akiel in July 1999, a judge ordered that Akiel and Vincent should visit each other regularly in the presence of psychologists, who would determine whether they had formed links as brothers during 14 months in the womb and at  the Fasanos' home.</p>
        <p>But the judges ruled yesterday that the Fasanos should not have had Akiel during that time anyway, because they knew of the mix-up shortly after Mrs. Fasano became pregnant but avoided correcting it. This made any bonds that formed between the boys legally invalid, the judges said.</p>
        <p>Both families have filed negligence and malpractice lawsuits against the fertility clinic, IVF New York, at 230 Central Park South. The state has found that the embryologist, Michael Obasaju, knew that another couple's embryos had been implanted in Mrs. Fasano's womb but failed to take action.</p>
