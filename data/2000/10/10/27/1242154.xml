        <p>In many old legends, a church is a perfect refuge from goblins and ghouls. That sense of sanctuary, however, does not apply to the Cathedral of St. John the Divine. Enter the smoke-filled nave tomorrow evening, and the space will look less like a church than like a convention center for crypt dwellers.</p>
        <p>Why the unholy fuss? It's time for the cathedral's annual Halloween Extravaganza and Procession of Ghouls. Directed by Ralph Lee, the puppeteer, the celebration will include all manner of strange creatures, from a 20-foot spider scuttling across a window to the ghost of Bishop William Thomas Manning, who is buried in the cathedral.</p>

        <p>In many old legends, a church is a perfect refuge from goblins and ghouls. That sense of sanctuary, however, does not apply to the Cathedral of St. John the Divine. Enter the smoke-filled nave tomorrow evening, and the space will look less like a church than like a convention center for crypt dwellers.</p>
        <p>Why the unholy fuss? It's time for the cathedral's annual Halloween Extravaganza and Procession of Ghouls. Directed by Ralph Lee, the puppeteer, the celebration will include all manner of strange creatures, from a 20-foot spider scuttling across a window to the ghost of Bishop William Thomas Manning, who is buried in the cathedral.</p>
        <p>''It's like a big haunted house,'' said Andrea Yost, the cathedral's director of public education. ''There's a very tall skeleton hanging on one of the Gothic piers and it scoots across the nave and over people's heads.''</p>
        <p>There will be two visitations, so to speak, one at 7 p.m. and one at 10 p.m. Each will begin with a showing of ''Dracula,'' the 1931 horror classic starring Bela Lugosi. The 7 p.m. spectacle is geared to families, who are encouraged to come in costume.</p>
        <p>But if your children aren't ready for a huge monster mash, they can take part in the cathedral's ''Morning of the Gargoyles,'' a family workshop tomorrow. It will begin with a reading of Eve Bunting's ''Night of the Gargoyles,'' a storybook in which these creatures come to life. Then children will make their own clay gargoyles and paper masks, using the cathedral decor as inspiration.</p>
        <p>Gargoyles aside, isn't ghoulish activity in a cathedral just a little, well, sacrilegious?</p>
        <p>''People criticize us,'' Ms. Yost admitted. But, she added, Halloween does have churchly antecedents in All Saints' Day. ''Life is filled with scary things, so what do we do?'' she asked. ''We look toward God, prayer and a better life.''</p>
        <p>Gargoyle workshop, tomorrow from 10 a.m. to noon, and Halloween Extravaganza, tomorrow at 7 and 10 p.m., at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, 1047 Amsterdam Avenue, at 112th Street, Morningside Heights. Workshop: $5. Reservations required: (212) 932-7347. Extravaganza: $12; students and the elderly, $6. Box office: (212) 662-2133.</p>
        <p>In Tune With America</p>
        <p>A ghost will visit Carnegie Hall tomorrow afternoon. Its presence, however, is not to celebrate Halloween but the power of music.</p>
        <p>The ghost is that of Antonin Dvorak (1841-1904), the Czech composer. He is one of the characters in ''Dvorak's Discovery,'' a play by Scott Baker that explores the legacy of the composer's visit to the United States in the 1890's. Presented with music performed by the Minnesota Orchestra, the play opens the new season of Carnegie Hall Family Concerts.</p>
        <p>''It's called 'Dvorak's Discovery' because spirituals were one of the musical forms he discovered,'' said Lisa Halasz, the hall's program development associate. ''Native American music was important, too, and also the songs of birds.''</p>
        <p>The play takes place in 1941, the 100th anniversary of Dvorak's birth. Harry Burleigh (T. Mychael Rambo), an African-American singer who introduced Dvorak to spirituals (Burleigh's grandfather was a slave), is on his way to a centennial celebration. As he waits for a bus, he encounters a boy (Adam Romey) who offers him a shoeshine. He and the boy, a trumpet player, start discussing music, and soon the ghost of Dvorak (Stephen Yoakam) arrives to comment on the action.</p>
        <p>''You'll hear bits and pieces of all Dvorak's big works,'' Ms. Halasz said. ''He wrote his most famous symphony, 'From the New World,' as a tribute to what he learned here.''</p>
        <p>For an hour before the concert, children will be invited to hear related stories and to meet the musicians.</p>
        <p>''Dvorak listened to spiritual melodies and said, 'This is as good as Beethoven,' '' Ms. Halasz said. ''He was pretty forward-looking.''</p>
        <p>''Dvorak's Discovery,'' tomorrow at 2 p.m. at Carnegie Hall. (Preconcert activities at 1 p.m.) Tickets: $5; (212) 247-7800 (Carnegie Charge).</p>
        <p>Some Favorite Haunts</p>
        <p>Many of the famous sites in New York City are so familiar that it's hard to think of them as remotely spooky. But if you visit the Queens Museum tomorrow afternoon, you're likely to see them in a whole new light: preferably, dim and flickering.</p>
        <p>That's when Philip Jackson, the museum's community programs coordinator, will offer the Eerie Panorama Tour, a Halloween-theme walk through the museum's 9,335-square-foot model of the city. Recommended for children over 12 and their families, the tour will raise some intriguing questions, said Mr. Jackson, like, ''What horrible secret lies beneath Washington Square Park?'' Then there is ''Who or what haunts the Statue of Liberty?'' and ''What morbid activity occurred every night for decades throughout the city in the 1800's while everyone slept?''</p>
        <p>For the answers you will have to take the tour, he said, which will also include some fictional highlights.</p>
        <p>''I point out the birthplace of Rosemary's baby, on the Upper West Side,'' Mr. Jackson said. The building  ''has a few real-life hauntings associated with it,'' he added.</p>
        <p>Younger children interested in lighter fare can watch ''Puppet Tales for an Allhallows Eve,'' also at the museum tomorrow. Presented by the Puppet Art Troupe, the show will present some cheerful chills.</p>
        <p>''Puppet Tales,'' tomorrow at 2 p.m., and the Eerie Panorama Tour, tomorrow at 3:30 p.m., at the Queens Museum of Art, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, (718) 592-9700, Extension 222. Free with admission: $5; students and the elderly, $2.50.</p>
