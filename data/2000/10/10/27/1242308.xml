        <p>NOW that this World Series in New York, New York is over, the Mets -- not just the champion Yankees -- should also be in next week's parade up Lower Broadway to City Hall.</p>
        <p>In three of the previous four years, as every Yankee devotee knows, thousands of Noo Yawkers turned out to honor the Yankees at a Lower Broadway parade after World Series victories. Quite understandably, nobody cared much about the losing teams in those years because they represented Atlanta, San Diego and Atlanta again.</p>
        <p>But this time, some New Yorkers still care deeply about the losing Mets. Maybe more deeply than some who rooted for the Yankees.</p>
        <p>If you're a New York baseball fan who loves a parade, it has to be double the pleasure and double the fun if both the Yankees and the Mets are on the floats.</p>
        <p>The Mets are still a World Series team worthy of a Lower Broadway thank-you, if only for having won the National League pennant.</p>
        <p>Since there was a pep rally in Bryant Park for both teams before the World Series, there should be a parade for both teams.</p>
        <p>If it took two New York teams to create a Subway Series, then one of the teams couldn't have won it without the other.</p>
        <p>Let the parade begin with the Mets, followed by the Yankees, then honor both at the City Hall ceremony.</p>
        <p>Joe Torre, the Yankees' manager, indicated that both New York teams should be celebrated in next week's parade and City Hall ceremony.</p>
        <p>''The city was a winner,'' Torre said before Game 5 last night. ''Getting to the World Series is what should be celebrated.''</p>
        <p>Nelson Doubleday, the Mets' co-owner, said he ''wouldn't want to do that if the guys don't want to,'' meaning if the Mets players objected. Bobby Valentine, the Mets' manager, remembered how earlier in the postseason he talked to his players about the Broadway parade that salutes the World Series champion.</p>
        <p>''I told them how we're going to be the only team in it,'' Valentine said. ''I tried to keep up with the theme and not to confuse the dream.''</p>
        <p>But that was before this World Series developed into something more than another World Series with the Yankees or the Mets going against a team from another city. This has been a Subway Series, a Noo Yawk happening that stirred the baseball emotions of New Yorkers more than it ever did when a Subway Series occurred seven times from 1947 to 1956 -- six times between the Yankees and the Brooklyn Dodgers, once between the Yankees and the New York Giants.</p>
        <p>It happened so often then, it was expected. None of those Subway Series were appreciated as much as this one, after a 44-year absence.</p>
        <p>According to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's press office, none of the Yankees' six Subway Series champions from 1947 to 1956 were honored with what was called a ticker-tape parade as office workers tossed stock-ticker tape out the windows of the buildings along Broadway. Nor were any of the earlier Yankee champions with Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig and Joe DiMaggio so honored.</p>
        <p>Individuals have occasionally had a parade: Charles Lindbergh in 1927, Gen. Douglas MacArthur in 1951, astronaut John Glenn in 1962 and 1998, Nelson Mandela in 1990, as well as the golfers Bobby Jones and Ben Hogan.</p>
        <p>According to the mayor's office, the first Broadway parade for a local sports team occurred when the Mets, managed by Gil Hodges and featuring Tom Seaver, won the 1969 World Series after having been the laughingstock of baseball when they lost 120 games in their original 1962 season.</p>
        <p>Whenever a New York team has won the World Series since then, it has had a parade -- the 1977 and 1978 Yankees, the 1986 Mets, and the 1996, 1998 and 1999 Yankees. When the Rangers finally won hockey's Stanley Cup in 1994 after a 54-year drought, they were also honored with a parade.</p>
        <p>Even though City Hall didn't have a parade for a baseball team until 1969, the borough of Brooklyn did, in 1941.</p>
        <p>That year, the Dodgers, who were affectionately known in Brooklyn as dem Bums, lost a Subway Series to the Yankees in five games. But on the Monday between the end of the season and the Series opener, an estimated million people cheered as the Dodgers rode in open cars from Grand Army Plaza to Borough Hall. When the ceremony was over, Meyer Berger of The New York Times talked to a sanitation worker.</p>
        <p>''It's late and I'll miss my supper,'' the man told the reporter. ''But for the Bums, it's an honor. I'll tell my kids I swept up for the Bums.''</p>
        <p>And if both New York teams are in next week's parade, some sanitation workers will consider it an honor to have swept up for the Mets.</p>
