        <p>Last year, the Big East women's basketball coaches chose Svetlana Abrosimova of Connecticut as the conference's preseason player of the year.</p>
        <p>Abrosimova, a junior forward from Russia, responded by averaging 13.4 points and 6.2 rebounds a game, making the all-American team and helping the Huskies to a 36-1 record and the national championship.</p>

        <p>Last year, the Big East women's basketball coaches chose Svetlana Abrosimova of Connecticut as the conference's preseason player of the year.</p>
        <p>Abrosimova, a junior forward from Russia, responded by averaging 13.4 points and 6.2 rebounds a game, making the all-American team and helping the Huskies to a 36-1 record and the national championship.</p>
        <p>So what happened at today's Big East media day when the coaches announced this season's preseason player of the year? Instead of Abrosimova, they chose her senior teammate, shooting guard Shea Ralph, who averaged 14.3 points, 4.9 assists, 3.7 rebounds and 2.6 steals last season.</p>
        <p>Ralph, who was also a first-team all-American, Abrosimova and Sue Bird, UConn's junior point guard, were all named to this year's All-Big East preseason first team.</p>
        <p>Those riches indicate how well-stocked Connecticut is. The conference coaches picked the Huskies to repeat as league champion, giving them all but one first-place vote (that went to Rutgers). But as Harry Perretta, the Villanova coach, said, ''The second-best team in the conference may be UConn's second team.''</p>
        <p>Two weeks into preseason practice, Geno Auriemma, the UConn coach, actually seems pleased.</p>
        <p>''Our high is much higher than it's ever been at this stage,'' he said. ''This team is more talented than any team we've ever had. It gives us more options than we've ever had. But this is another team.</p>
        <p>''For now, the test is among ourselves, how well we practice. I'm anxious to see us in a game situation against a real good team on the road.''</p>
        <p>Auriemma's players seem to understand that past success is no guarantee. ''We have the talent to be very good,'' Bird said. ''It depends on what we do with it. What happened last year was last year.''</p>
        <p>In a recent poll by Women's Basketball Journal, last season's UConn team was voted the best women's college basketball team ever. Could this year's team, with only two graduation losses and a glowing freshman class of five, be even better?</p>
        <p>Auriemma did not blink. ''This team,'' he said, ''may be better.''</p>
        <p>REBOUNDS</p>
        <p>The coaches predicted this order of finish: Connecticut, Rutgers, Notre Dame, Boston College, Georgetown/Virginia Tech (tied), Villanova, Pittsburgh, Miami, Syracuse, St. John's, Providence, Seton Hall and West Virginia. . . . The preseason first team also included RUTH RILEY of Notre Dame and TASHA POINTER of Rutgers. DIANA TAURASI of UConn was named preseason rookie of the year.</p>
