        <p>The Brazilian real estate developer Mario Garnero, left, has canceled plans to build the world's tallest building in the center of Sao Paulo after the project's financial backers pulled out of the $1.65 billion deal. The Maharishi Global Development Fund, which is linked to Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, abandoned the project after the Sao Paulo city government appeared unlikely to approve the 108-floor, pyramid-shaped complex. The Sao Paulo mayor's office said that the project had stalled because of a lack of financial guarantees. The fund is in talks to relocate the complex to Dallas. It would hold 50,000 people with offices, apartments, a university, shopping malls, hotels and a convention center.</p>
