        <p>Striking teachers in Neptune Township, N.J., ended a two-day strike yesterday morning, returning to work after reaching a tentative contract settlement with the district's school board.</p>
        <p>After talks with the teachers' union broke down early Tuesday morning, district officials closed the schools just a couple of hours before classes were scheduled to start.</p>
        <p>But on Wednesday, both sides asked James Mastriani, a fact-finder appointed by the New Jersey Public Employment Relations Commission,  to help them resume negotiations. They met at 6:30 p.m. at a hotel in Spring Lake and by 12:45 a.m. announced a tentative settlement that allowed schools to reopen yesterday morning.</p>
        <p>Details of the agreement were not immediately available. The 500 teachers, aides, custodians and clerical workers in the union, the Neptune Township Education Association, were not expected to vote on it until next week.</p>
        <p>Dr. Michael Lake, the superintendent of the 4,500-student district, said the settlement included an agreement to withdraw an injunction ordering the teachers back to work. The union had defied that order for a day and could have been subject to  contempt of court penalties and fines.</p>
        <p>Judge Clarkson S. Fisher Jr. of Superior Court in Monmouth County dropped the injunction yesterday at the request of James Hundley, the district's lawyer.</p>
        <p>Karen Joseph, a spokeswoman for the union, said the court order, as well as pressure from parents, had helped to bring about an agreement.</p>
        <p>The union's contract expired in June, and talks and state mediation failed to resolve the differences between the parties. Mr. Mastriani entered the process about a month ago with the power to outline an imposed settlement if it proved necessary.</p>
        <p>Going into Wednesday's final round of talks, the union and the district were divided over three issues: salary increases for a three-year contract; increases in the deductibles for the union's medical, dental and prescription plan; and the addition of three ''staff development days'' to the teachers' school year.</p>
        <p>Dr. Lake said said all of those issues had been resolved, but probably ''not to either side's complete satisfaction.''</p>
