        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The headline ''Newscasters Leave Black Rock, the House Edward R. Murrow Built'' (news article, Oct. 21) seems to echo the common characterization of Yankee Stadium as ''the house that Ruth built.''</p>
        <p>In fact, Murrow's primary radio venue had been Studio Nine in the old, old CBS building at 485 Madison Avenue. By the time CBS moved to Black Rock on 52nd Street in 1964, Murrow was in the last months of his battle with cancer. After several years of strained relations with top management, he had been eased out of his job at CBS and into the directorship of the United States Information Agency in 1961.</p>

        <p>No one will question Murrow's importance in building the strong CBS News operation that persisted for some three decades. In contrast to Murrow's experience, however, Babe Ruth played at the stadium for many years and at the close of his career was honored, not rejected.</p>
