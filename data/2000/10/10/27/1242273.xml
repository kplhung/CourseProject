        <p>The police are investigating the mysterious disappearance of a former fashion model from the Upper East Side who they say has been missing for two weeks.</p>
        <p>The woman, Lourdes Gruart, 46, has not reported to her job at a Manhattan executive-recruiting firm since Oct. 13, the police said. On Monday, a co-worker reported her missing to officers at the 19th Precinct station house, they said.</p>
        <p>The police added that they did not know if foul play was involved.</p>
        <p>''At this point we don't have a crime, so there is no suspect,'' said Deputy Inspector John W. Cutter of the Manhattan North Detective Squad.</p>
        <p>Inspector Cutter raised an inconsistency between information that the police had collected so far and statements made by Ms. Gruart's brother, Mario, 31. Mr. Gruart told the police that he last saw his sister on Oct. 14, and that she told him she was leaving for a trip to Europe. But Ms. Gruart's passport has expired, the inspector said, adding, ''At this point we do not believe she has gone to Europe.''</p>
        <p>In an interview with The Daily News, Mr. Gruart denied any involvement in the disappearance of his sister. There was no answer last night at Ms. Gruart's East 83rd Street apartment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gruart, who the police said is unemployed, has been staying at his sister's apartment for about a month and a half, said their mother, who is also named Lourdes Gruart and who lives in Plantation, Fla.</p>
        <p>During her modeling career, Ms. Gruart lived in France, Italy and Japan and was a runway model for such fashion houses as Missoni and Armani, her mother said in a telephone interview.</p>
        <p>The elder Ms. Gruart said she had been in close touch with her daughter and had planned to visit her for Thanksgiving. She also said that she had spoken with Mario Gruart recently. ''He called here to know how I was doing,'' she said. ''He said Lourdes told him that she was going to Europe for a couple of weeks and that's it. He said she was going to an interview for a good job.''</p>
        <p>But Ms. Gruart added that ''Lourdes would never go to Europe or any place without telling me.''</p>
