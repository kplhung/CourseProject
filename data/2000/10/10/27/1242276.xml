        <p>It may be the ultimate political symbol for the coal fields of Appalachia: Just in time for the West Virginia governor's race, a slurry dam burst on the state's border with Kentucky, sending 250 million gallons of coal-dust sludge oozing down toward riverfront towns as a reminder of the environmental legacy of King Coal.</p>
        <p>Even as the black muck threatened water supplies, the two main candidates in the race, Gov. Cecil H. Underwood, a Republican and former coal company executive, and Representative Bob Wise, the Democrat supported by mine union locals, were debating on television how best to bolster the coal industry.</p>
        <p>Not included in the debate was a third candidate, Denise Giardina, creator of the Mountain Party, who complains that major-party politicians have been too long in the thrall of the coal industry to  confront its increasingly burdensome grip on the state.</p>
        <p>The mining job base is already vastly depleted, down to fewer than 16,000 jobs from the 100,000-plus of the industry's heyday in the state a generation ago. And the industry is further threatened by a federal court ruling that mountaintop strip mining has illegally blocked and polluted the state's rural streams -- a decision that both Governor Underhill and Representative Wise, for all their conflict over other issues, agree should be altered.</p>
        <p>''The future of the coal industry is not that dark,'' Mr. Underhill argued in a televised debate in which he contended that excessive federal regulation was the main problem with ''mountaintop removal.'' This is the controversial mining process by which mammoth machinery decapitates coal-rich hills and pours wastes into surrounding hollows, where alarmed residents have begun suing the industry and government.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wise, who has a slight edge in polls, told the broadcast audience he had worked in Congress for an ''alteration'' in the court decision, which found the industry in systematic violation of environmental and mining laws. ''I believe you can do mountaintop removal appropriately,'' said Mr. Wise of an industry that has maintained its political clout by doubling the state's coal output in the past 20 years even as the job base shrank.</p>
        <p>Two years ago, Mr. Wise, a nine-term congressman, proposed a moratorium on mountaintop mining. Critics, led by Governor Underwood, contend he is backpedaling now in fear of losing the miners' vote. But Mr. Wise insists that was a call for only a temporary moratorium caused by the ''chaos'' of Governor Underwood's signing a law that doubled the permissible dumping of certain wastes into streams.</p>
        <p>Listening closely to the debate, Secretary of State Ken Hechler, a Democrat who favors a total ban on mountaintop removal, found the two politicians more evasive than enlightening.</p>
        <p>''They're just sparring and are not really addressing the issue,''  Mr. Hechler said.</p>
        <p>He agrees with Ms. Giardina that the issue should not be how firmly the state protects the industry but whether it will ever truly control King Coal and make it pay for environmental damage exemplified by the gradual flattening of the West Virginia horizon across a generation of massive earth moving.</p>
        <p>''Denise is about the only one who is really speaking out on this, yet she's not attracting much attention,'' Mr. Hechler said.</p>
        <p>But miners feel no less aggrieved, said Dick Kembler, president of Local 2935 of the United Mine Workers. Mr. Kembler is a lifelong Democrat who said he was voting Republican this year and bucking the national union's endorsement of Vice President Al Gore and Mr. Wise. He accused the Clinton administration of trying to finesse the issue, first siding with the lawsuit victors but then shifting positions as the court ruling came under appeal and the election approached.</p>
        <p>''I'd still be working if it wasn't for the mountaintop lawsuit,'' said Mr. Kembler, who has been courted prominently this election season by Mr. Underwood and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas in his presidential campaign visits here.</p>
        <p>''I was forced into retirement a year ago when mining permits dried up,'' Mr. Kembler said, complaining that the local had more than 400 active jobs five years ago, but now has none.</p>
        <p>''This is such a close race that little places like West Virginia can settle it,'' Mr. Kembler said of this heavily Democratic state. ''Gore will be sorry because he's an extreme environmentalist and that's what started this problem.''</p>
        <p>But environmentalists are finding the governor's race to be an escape from the reality of the scarred landscape. They hear little mention of the mountaintop and dam slurry issues as the candidates put their emphasis on attack ads pegged to abortion, school prayer and health care.</p>
        <p>Ms. Giardina, a teacher and novelist born into a mining family, decided to turn to politics when, she said, she saw the hard lessons of mining's past being buried like the streams in the hollows. ''When you grow up in the mountains you can not imagine them not being there,'' she said outside the debate. ''With the political infrastructure kowtowing to coal, the state never got a fair shake. All we got were jobs, and now they're gone.''</p>
