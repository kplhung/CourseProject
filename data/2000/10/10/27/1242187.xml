        <p>A selective listing of new or noteworthy cabaret shows in Manhattan this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended show.</p>
        <p>''BERLIN TO BROADWAY WITH KURT WEILL,'' Triad, 158 West 72nd Street, (212) 239-6200. If this is not a flawless revue, it is nevertheless an ingratiating tribute to Kurt Weill's achievement.

        <p>BARBARA CARROLL, Bemelmans Bar, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, (212) 744-1600. This agelessly chic red-haired pianist and singer seems to know every important popular song ever written and to be able to perform from memory in any key. Her elegant, lyrical pianism is a compendium of 20th-century jazz styles, from Count Basie to Erroll Garner to Bill Evans and beyond. And her clipped, understated vocals, which verge on speech-song, approach lyrics from a wry but warmhearted point of view. Tonight and tomorrow night beginning at 9:30, through Dec. 31. Michael Devine, Tuesdays through Saturdays at 5:30 p.m., through Dec. 30. Cover: $15 at table and $5 at the bar; no minimum (Stephen Holden).</p>
        <p>* HOWARD FISHMAN QUARTET, Sardi's, 234 West 44th Street, (212) 221-8440. Powerful echoes of Stephane Grappelli and Bix Beiderbecke are among the influences rippling through the Howard Fishman Quartet's seamless swing. The group -- Mr. Fishman on guitar, banjo and vocals; Russell Farhang playing virtuosic Grappelli-style violin; Erik Jekabson on trumpet; and Jonathan Flaugher on bass -- folds elements of vintage jazz, swing and early bluegrass into rhythmically animated, richly allusive jazz chamber music. Whether the music is Stephen Foster (a bubbly ''Old Folks at Home''), Gershwin (''Soon'') or Romberg (''When I Grow Too Old to Dream''), it is all translated into lilting, fine-tuned ensemble music that transcends time and idiom. Fridays at 10:30 p.m. No cover charge, but $15 minimum at tables. The Howard Fishman Quartet also performs Sunday at 8:30 p.m. at Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 539-8778 or (212) 239-6200. Tickets: $12 (Holden).</p>
        <p>* ''OUR SINATRA,'' Reprise Room at Dillon's, 245 West 54th Street, (212) 239-6200. The rising young cabaret star Eric Comstock is the mastermind behind this utterly winning tribute to Ol' Blue Eyes. He focuses on what he calls the hidden gems and orphan songs that Sinatra made popular. Joined by Christopher Gines, whose creamy baritone echoes the voices of Dick Haymes and Steve Lawrence in their prime, and Hilary Kole, a perky swinger, Mr. Comstock conducts a witty and knowledgeable survey of the Sinatra canon. Mr. Comstock concentrates on the mature Sinatra, and Mr. Gines on the dreamy 1940's singer of ballads, with Ms. Kole bridging the gap. The memorable show proves that there are still young singers good enough to keep the tradition alive. Today and Monday through Wednesday at 8 p.m.; tomorrow at 2:30 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 3 and 7:30 p.m. Tickets: $50 and $55; ringside seating, $75 and $80 (Holden).</p>
        <p>* BOBBY SHORT, Cafe Carlyle, at the Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, (212) 744-1600. If his voice sometimes fogs up, and some nights are better than others, Mr. Short is still often capable of an exuberance that can make going to the Cafe Carlyle feel like attending the happiest and classiest private party in Manhattan. His new show includes a timely sequence of songs about money and a fresh selection of gems by Cole Porter, a longtime favorite of Mr. Short's. His excellent band gently kicks the material in a jazz direction. Through December. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 9 and 11 p.m. Cover: $60 at tables, no minimum; dinner available but not required, 6 p.m. to midnight. Monday nights at 8:45, through Dec. 17, Woody Allen with Eddy Davis's New Orleans Jazz Band. Cover: $60; no minimum (Holden).</p>
        <p>* WESLA WHITFIELD, Arci's Place, 450 Park Avenue South, at 30th Street, (212) 532-4370. As she has grown more expressively uninhibited, Ms. Whitfield has metamorphosed from a complacent living-room entertainer into a complex, subtle interpreter who brings a double vision to her material. When performing, she often gives the sense that she is scouring the lyrics with an acute critical intelligence. At the same time, she conveys feelings that run from a sly, almost needling humor to profound pathos when letting loose on a ballad like ''How Deep Is the Ocean.'' Fridays and Saturdays at 8:30 and 11 p.m.; Tuesdays through Thursdays at 9 p.m. Through Nov. 14. Cover: $30; $15 minimum. Sunday night at 8 and 10, Saundra Santiago, singer. Cover: $25; $15 minimum. Mondays at 8, through Dec. 18, Jim Caruso, singer, in ''Live and in Person,'' with musical direction and piano accompaniment by Billy Stritch. Cover: $25; $15 minimum (Holden).</p>

''Weekends With Sinatra,'' with Cary Hoffman and the 11-piece Carnegie Club Orchestra, features music made famous by Frank Sinatra in the 1950's, with the original arrangements by Nelson Riddle.
