        <p>If ''A Room for Romeo Brass,'' a loose-jointed wisp of a movie about the friendship of two 12-year-old boys in the English Midlands, seems so true to life that it might almost be a high-quality home movie, that's because it relates the story of its screenwriters' own childhood friendship at a certain moment in the recent past (the mid-1980's). Like the film's main characters -- Gavin Woolley (Ben Marshall), nicknamed Knocks, and Romeo Brass (Andrew Shim) -- Shane Meadows, who directed, and his screenwriting collaborator, Paul Fraser, were best friends and next-door neighbors in a cramped housing development.</p>

        <p>If ''A Room for Romeo Brass,'' a loose-jointed wisp of a movie about the friendship of two 12-year-old boys in the English Midlands, seems so true to life that it might almost be a high-quality home movie, that's because it relates the story of its screenwriters' own childhood friendship at a certain moment in the recent past (the mid-1980's). Like the film's main characters -- Gavin Woolley (Ben Marshall), nicknamed Knocks, and Romeo Brass (Andrew Shim) -- Shane Meadows, who directed, and his screenwriting collaborator, Paul Fraser, were best friends and next-door neighbors in a cramped housing development.</p>
        <p>Mr. Marshall and Mr. Shim, the superb unknown actors who play the boys, appear so natural in front of the camera that their portrayals scarcely seem like performances. Knocks, who is partly disabled with a bad back, is a sly practical joker who, while recovering from an operation, studies to be an amateur magician. Romeo is a self-styled tough guy, attracted to the martial arts, who defends his best friend when he runs afoul of older bullies.</p>
        <p>One afternoon during a playground brawl that the two friends are losing, they are rescued by an older stranger, Morell (Paddy Considine), who befriends them and takes them around in his van. At first, Morell appears to be a lovable, eccentric sad sack. And when he takes an instant shine to Romeo's beautiful elder sister, Ladine (Vicky McClure), who works in a jeans store, he enlists his younger friends to help him win a date with her.</p>
        <p>Knocks is dispatched to quiz Ladine on her tastes in men's fashions, and the boy, ever the prankster, mischievously turns her sartorial pet peeves into a list of recommendations. The movie's funniest scene shows Morell strutting around in a ludicrous purple sporting outfit, a cap with a clear plastic visor perched comically on his head. In these early scenes, Morell comes across as a sweet, wounded innocent and you root for him to win Ladine's affection.</p>
        <p>As part of his romantic campaign, Morell monopolizes Romeo and begins teaching him martial arts moves. Romeo becomes so caught up in his new obsession that he barely notices when Knocks goes to the hospital for a critical back operation, and their friendship is breached.</p>
        <p>Although Morell finally gets a date with Ladine, he never forgives Knocks for his practical joke, and eventually Morell reveals himself as an unstable, potentially violent menace to both boys and their families. Mr. Considine's Morell is an original and thoroughly believable creation. In playing him, the skinny, hollow-eyed actor dexterously balances quirky charm with an instability that is both pathetic and ominous. The movie also skillfully sketches in the boys' families. Knocks has a stern, strait-laced mother and a couch-potato father, while Romeo's parents are embattled.</p>
        <p>Beyond its remarkably detailed realism, ''A Room for Romeo Brass'' doesn't have much on its mind. It is essentially a personal reminiscence of daily life that captures with an astonishing precision exactly what it felt to be a 12-year-old boy growing up in a particular time and place.</p>
        <p>''A Room for Romeo Brass'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes profanity and sexual situations.</p>
