        <p>Tim McCarver's analysis is usually touched with an uncanny prescience, an ability to first-guess a play, even if he did not predict with precision that the Yankees would win the World Series with a 4-2 victory in Game 5 last night. Once or twice a game, McCarver, the Fox sportscaster, will foretell or suggest a play, followed quickly by that very thing happening.</p>
        <p>In Game 2 of the National League Championship Series, Mike Piazza had just been fooled badly by a slider when McCarver said, ''Mike Piazza is the only guy I've ever seen who can look so bad on one pitch and so good on the next.''</p>
        <p>Then, of course, Piazza creamed the next pitch, a fastball, for a home run.</p>
        <p>Last night, only two pitches after noting how the slumping Yankee Bernie Williams's swings against Al Leiter ''were the most authoritative'' of the Series, Williams slugged a home run to put the Yankees ahead, 1-0.</p>
        <p>McCarver still dispenses plenty of analysis after the fact, but first-guessing is his distinctive talent, one factor that persuaded the Twins in 1984 and the Expos in 1986 to explore hiring him to manage their teams.</p>
        <p>The first-guessing, he said in an interview yesterday, is derived ''from what emerges in the game over the course of talking for three and a half or four hours. I don't care if what I say doesn't happen. I don't mind. I'm not a seer.''</p>
        <p>During Game 3 of the World Series Tuesday night, McCarver said that the Yankees' David Justice was positioned too deeply in left field for the Mets' light-hitting Timo Perez, who would ''have to hit the ball twice to reach David Justice.'' Seconds later, the Yankees' first base coach, Lee Mazzilli, was on the top step of the dugout, summoning Justice forward.</p>
        <p>Later, McCarver noted that Yankee pitcher Orlando Hernandez's success with right-handed hitters hinges, in part, on weakening their swing by making their left leg ''turn in.''</p>
        <p>One pitch later, Todd Zeile struck out, and there was that turned in left leg.</p>
        <p>McCarver's talent is also for suggesting what should happen even if it doesn't -- and being proved right. In the third inning of Game 4 on Wednesday, with the Yankees' Derek Jeter on third base and Luis Sojo at bat with a 1-2 count, McCarver said, ''The infield for the Mets will break in with two strikes on the batter.'' But Sojo's grounded out to second base with the right side of the Mets' infield playing back, not in, and Jeter scored to put the Yankees ahead by 3-0.</p>
        <p>''Had it been in,'' McCarver said, ''Derek Jeter doesn't try to score and Alfonzo would probably have caught the ball in the air.''</p>
        <p>McCarver said yesterday that his suggestion was based on watching Sojo play and the possibility that a team trailing by two runs would take a defensive risk to keep a third run from scoring.</p>
        <p>''I've seen Sojo hit that way,'' said McCarver, the Yankees' analyst on Channel 5. ''The Mets wouldn't have lost a lot, and I've seen managers do that, just move the right side of the infield in.''</p>
        <p>Before Game 5, McCarver said he asked Mets Manager Bobby Valentine about the play, during which what proved to be the game-winning run scored in the Yankees' 3-2 victory.</p>
        <p>''I asked Bobby and he gave me a rather curt answer,'' he said. When Valentine elaborated, McCarver heard the kind of attitude toward his analysis he remembered from calling Mets games.</p>
        <p>Last night, Valentine seemed bent on proving McCarver's first-guesses wrong. In the fourth inning, with one out and the Mets' Jay Payton on first base, McCarver said, ''He's got to run.'' Twice, Payton did not.</p>
        <p>''It underlines the effect that Andy Pettitte's pickoff move has,'' said Joe Buck, his partner.</p>
        <p>''And the Mets are over-reacting,'' McCarver said. After Kurt Abbott walked and was picked off by Pettitte, McCarver recovered quickly, saying that with Leiter likely to bunt, Abbott should have detected a move afoot by the Yankees' first baseman, Tino Martinez, who was playing behind the runner, not rushing toward home for the bunt.</p>
        <p>McCarver was just as certain that Edgardo Alfonzo would be running from first in the seventh inning with one out and a 3-2 count on Todd Zeile. ''He's got to send him this time,'' McCarver said. Nope. And Zeile struck out.</p>
        <p>McCarver's only shortcoming last night was not suggesting that Leiter should have been removed after giving up a two-out walk to Jorge Posada in the ninth inning, the first step in the Yankees game-winning rally.</p>
        <p>The Lowest-Rated Series</p>
        <p>Riveting as last night's game was, this will go down as the lowest-rated World Series ever. Game 4 produced a 12.5 Nielsen rating, down 30 percent from a 17.8 for the comparable game in the Yankees-Braves Series last year. The four-game average was a 12.2. Each rating point equals 1.02 million television households.</p>
        <p>The championship will only make the Yankees more valuable and give the team more leverage, to create a new cable network to carry its games or to sell the rights to the MSG Network. The Yankees plan to present a new offer to MSG next week, replacing one valued at anywhere from $1.4 billion to $2.5 billion over 10 years.</p>
