        <p>The 30-second television ads and one-minute radio ads, which will begin running today in upstate New York, on Long Island and in Westchester and Rockland Counties, are seen as crucial by supporters of the act because bond proposals have traditionally fared poorly among voters outside of New York City.</p>

        <p>With less than two weeks to go until Election Day, supporters of a proposed $3.8 billion transportation bond act, by far the largest borrowing proposal in New York State history, have begun a television and radio advertising campaign to urge voters to approve the measure.</p>
        <p>The 30-second television ads and one-minute radio ads, which will begin running today in upstate New York, on Long Island and in Westchester and Rockland Counties, are seen as crucial by supporters of the act because bond proposals have traditionally fared poorly among voters outside of New York City.</p>
        <p>This transportation bond act may turn out to be an easier sell than previous ones, because $1.8 billion of the money would be invested in highway and bridge improvements statewide, projects that appeal to upstate and suburban voters.</p>
        <p>The ads appear to be intended to hammer home the message that the act, which critics have contended will push the state's debt load dangerously high, will prove a boon to many cities and communities, not only by making driving easier but also by providing jobs and expanding regional airports.</p>
        <p>''Traffic's bad and getting worse,'' intones an announcer at the beginning of each television ad, which shows a computerized image of cars jammed together on a highway.</p>
        <p>In one ad, the announcer continues: ''The transportation bond act will change that, adding new lanes to our busiest roads, repairing bridges and cutting down on air pollution.'' The ads in each region specify local projects that would get money, like improving Route 281 near Syracuse or the Elmira-Corning airport.</p>
        <p>About $1.6 billion of the bond act would aid the city and surrounding areas. Money would go to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority for upgrading subway, rail and bus systems, including the first work in decades on a Second Avenue subway line, and to start work on a connection between the Long Island Rail Road and Grand Central Terminal.</p>
        <p>The remaining $400 million would be divided among other state public transit systems, ports, airports and canals.</p>
