        <p>Directed by Ian Merrick  R; 96 minutes</p>
        <p>Back in the pre-cable heyday of UHF you could occasionally find, in the wee hours of the morning, a bafflingly obscure, strangely arty kind of horror film, which starred nobody you recognized and which made, even through the haze of insomnia, very little sense. This murky genre survives mostly on the USA cable network and in the straight-to-video market, but with ''The Sculptress'' it surfaces -- briefly, one assumes -- in theatrical release. The movie's relative restraint when it comes to gore, nudity and bad language makes late-night broadcast television its ideal venue, as does its air of solemn boredom.</p>

        <p>Back in the pre-cable heyday of UHF you could occasionally find, in the wee hours of the morning, a bafflingly obscure, strangely arty kind of horror film, which starred nobody you recognized and which made, even through the haze of insomnia, very little sense. This murky genre survives mostly on the USA cable network and in the straight-to-video market, but with ''The Sculptress'' it surfaces -- briefly, one assumes -- in theatrical release. The movie's relative restraint when it comes to gore, nudity and bad language makes late-night broadcast television its ideal venue, as does its air of solemn boredom.</p>
        <p>Katie Wright plays Sarah, a British art student studying in San Francisco, where she happens to live next door to a serial killer (Jeff Fahey) who dons outlandish costumes to stalk his victims. To make matters worse -- not so much for Sarah as for the audience -- this troubled fellow is not just your run-of-the-mill sexually frustrated, split-personality slasher but some kind of evil spirit who has, perhaps unwittingly, infiltrated his neighbor's mind.</p>
        <p>It takes a panicky fortune teller and a kindly (if vaguely lecherous) sculpture professor to figure this out -- the professor draws a helpful diagram featuring words like ''incubus'' and ''demon child'' -- but they can't do much to help poor Sarah, who must also fend off the advances of an aggressive classmate, struggle with the demands of her art and, in her modest contribution to the film's doomy atmosphere, light candles in a dim, spooky church.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, her neighbor, when he's not reciting ''Hamlet'' in his apartment, dresses up as some kind of 19th-century German baron, complete with fake beard, walking stick and kid gloves -- the kind of get-up women in San Francisco apparently find irresistible.</p>
        <p>''The Sculptress'' is so poorly written, badly acted and ineptly directed that it denies you even the modest pleasure of making fun of it. Since you know the identity of the killer well in advance, and since Ms. Wright's dull pouting and slack line-reading make it impossible to care what happens to her character, the only real mystery is why this film was ever made.</p>
        <p>''The Sculptress'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It contains brief sexual scenes and some gore.</p>
