        <p>Strange that something so extraordinary and enchanted had such a familiar ending. For Yankee fans, that accustomed rush of self-satisfaction in their hearts; for Mets followers, that old sunken feeling in the pit of the stomach.</p>
        <p>But as the Yankees finished off the Mets last night at Shea Stadium, shards of something special were still clinging to the Subway Series. New Yorkers had somehow managed to become friends with one another.</p>
        <p>At Shea, the vendors stopped selling beer sometime around midgame as a hedge against disorder. This made the night an especially long one for Eddie Sanchez, who went from concession stand to concession stand in the sixth inning in search of liquid anesthetic.</p>
        <p>''Not even for the No. 1 Mets fan?'' he asked a stadium worker, pulling out of the pocket of his Mets jacket a New York Post article describing his devotion. The stadium worker shook his head.</p>
        <p>But fears of rowdiness proved unfounded, as they had throughout a Series in which the only relevant violence took place on the field, and even that was potential rather than actual -- a piece of wood hurled by Roger Clemens that missed Mike Piazza, who may or may not have been his intended target.</p>
        <p>By the end last night, there seemed to be more screaming Yankee fans than silenced Met fans at Shea, but there was peace.</p>
        <p>''There are this many Yankees and Mets fans and there are no problems,'' said Steve Santanastasio, 32, of Jamaica Hills, Queens. ''That's the one encouraging thing about this.''</p>
        <p>Daniel Rush, 20, of the Bronx, a Yankee fan, pronounced it simply ''the most incredible game I've ever seen in my life.''</p>
        <p>At a pizzeria on East 83rd Street, not far from the apartment of Mets pitcher Al Leiter, three Yankee fans and a Mets fan took turns buying each other rounds of drinks all night.</p>
        <p>After the Yankees scored two runs in the top of the ninth inning, the Mets fan, Angelo Monterroso, said, ''Hey, we still got last licks.''</p>
        <p>His friend Louis Atanacao, 35, said, ''Yeah, you're right, you're right.'' There was a long pause. ''Next year.''</p>
        <p>Both of them started to laugh.</p>
        <p>As Bernie Williams pulled down Piazza's long fly ball to end the game, Atanacao and his two buddies jumped up and down and embraced.</p>
        <p>For one long week, there was a spell over New York City. The weather was perfect -- clean and crisp, never too cold to play, never too hot to feel un-Octoberish. It was a weeklong holiday of the sort usually found in places where go-go-go is not the overriding rule.</p>
        <p>If New York was not the center of the universe during that time -- according to the A. C. Nielsen ratings, most Americans watching television were not too interested in seeing the teams from the nation's most annoying city battle it out -- New Yorkers did not care. For one week, the games knocked the homestretch of a tight presidential contest and a crisis in the Middle East off the top of the news.</p>
        <p>While the Series may not have proved the economic boon that Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani promised -- after all, there was no out-of-town team to pull thousands of followers into the city -- it was a bonanza for the seeming thousands involved in the merchandising of baseball paraphernalia.</p>
        <p>Now it is all over, except for the parade on Monday. Now New Yorkers can go back to ignoring each other, back to real life.</p>
        <p>For Kevin Duffy, 25, a Mets fan who was slinking back home to the Bronx from Shea, this meant: ''I go watch the Giants. You know, football. You've got to move on.''</p>
        <p>Tomorrow it is supposed to rain.</p>
