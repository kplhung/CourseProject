        <p>A leading Wall Street firm, Sullivan &amp; Cromwell, opened the season of annual bonuses this week, announcing on Wednesday that its first-year lawyers, most of whom began practicing law last fall at an annual salary of $125,000, would receive a year-end bonus of $35,000 this year. That is more than double the $15,000 that first-year associates received last year.</p>
        <p>The size of the bonus demonstrates that the market for corporate lawyers is still extremely hot, and that keeping them remains a concern despite a round of salary increases of as much as 25 percent early this year. It also raises the bar for other top-tier law firms, which will have to decide whether to match Sullivan &amp; Cromwell's bonus.</p>
        <p>The timing of the announcement is sure to affect the firm's recruiting efforts both by attracting top law students who are deciding which firm to intern with next summer, and by impressing those law students who were interns last summer and were offered permanent jobs after they graduate but who may be thinking about going to other firms.</p>
        <p>Some of those prospective employees asked questions about how much they could expect to be paid, prompting Wednesday's announcement, said Benjamin F. Stapleton, a partner at Sullivan &amp; Cromwell. ''People wanted to know and we told them,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The bonus brings the total compensation for first-year lawyers at Sullivan &amp; Cromwell to $160,000. Second-year lawyers, whose base salary is $135,000, stand to earn even more when their bonuses are announced.  Sullivan &amp; Cromwell announced bonuses only for first-year lawyers.</p>
        <p>The bonus ''creates a buzz,'' said Stephen Gillers, a New York University Law School professor who studies the legal industry, and that buzz is critical to recruiting because Sullivan &amp; Cromwell is competing with other firms for the same narrow slice of the top of the class at leading law schools.</p>
        <p>Raising compensation to such levels may create risks for some law firms if the economy slows down.  Although firms are not obligated to pay a specific bonus, once given, it may be difficult to reduce in future years.</p>
        <p>Less profitable firms may be reluctant to match the $35,000 bonus, which may be to Sullivan &amp; Cromwell's advantage, Professor Gillers said.</p>
        <p>''If 5 or 6 firms do it, and another 10 or 15 are behind, then you are creating an exclusive tier, and Sullivan &amp; Cromwell will be the leader,'' he said. ''You're first or you're an also-ran.''</p>
        <p>News of the bonus at Sullivan &amp; Cromwell spread at the speed of the Internet among lawyers at top-tier firms in New York, filling them with anticipation of sizable bonuses of their own.</p>
        <p>''Everyone here is incredibly enthusiastic'' about the Sullivan &amp; Cromwell bonus, said one junior lawyer at Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore, another large corporate firm.</p>
        <p>''Everyone is thinking 'that's just the bar now,' '' and other firms will have to meet or beat it, he said.</p>
        <p>Partners at other firms were less enthusiastic about paying large bonuses, but sounded resigned to increases. ''We haven't made a decision about the year-end bonus yet,'' said Rhett Brandon, a partner at Simpson Thacher &amp; Bartlett, which usually announces bonuses in January. ''It is our full intention to remain competitive in the marketplace.''</p>
