        <p>In a close vote along strict party lines, the Nassau County Legislature approved a four-year fiscal rescue plan tonight that includes a 15.4 percent  increase in county property taxes next year.</p>
        <p>The plan, which needs the approval of the county executive and a state board overseeing Nassau's finances, was passed by the 10 Democrats who control the Legislature. The chamber's nine Republicans, who have proposed a 5 percent tax increase in the county portion of local property tax bills, all voted against it.</p>
        <p>County Executive Thomas S. Gulotta, a Republican who had requested a 3.8 percent tax increase, said he would not comment tonight on the plan, but scheduled a Friday news conference. He has 10 days to decide whether to approve it or to veto parts of it.</p>
        <p>''It is our hope that the county executive will approve this budget and four-year plan,'' Judith A. Jacobs, the Democratic presiding officer, said in a written statement released before the 8 p.m. vote. She said she believed the plan would be accepted by the Nassau Interim Finance Authority, the state board monitoring the county's effort to fix its fiscal mess.</p>
        <p>But that remained far from sure tonight, as Gov. George E. Pataki laced into the Democrats in a statement from Albany.</p>
        <p>''The governor is disappointed the Legislature's majority has voted for a significant property tax increase,'' said Joseph E. Conway, a spokesman for Mr. Pataki. ''New York State has shown that you can produce surpluses with a smaller, smarter government that controls spending.''</p>
        <p>It was Mr. Pataki who in May offered the cash-starved county a $100 million state bailout -- plus $5 million to help overhaul its antiquated property tax system and a restructuring of the county's $2.6 billion debt -- if Nassau officials would agree to trim the deficit by tens of millions of dollars through 2004, either through cuts or new revenue.</p>
        <p>And it was Mr. Pataki who handpicked Frank G. Zarb to head the state oversight board.</p>
        <p>For months, Mr. Zarb has urged the often-warring leaders in the county government -- Mr. Gulotta, Ms. Jacobs and Peter J. Schmitt, the Republican minority leader -- to work together to come up with a single fiscal plan. But the trio met only twice, and remain deeply divided over how to eliminate a deficit that is projected to reach nearly $400 million by 2004.</p>
        <p>Members of the state board would not say what they thought of the four-year plan that passed tonight. But a state official familiar with the talks said, ''It is highly unlikely that this budget is going to pass muster with the state board, unless there are dramatic changes in it.''</p>
        <p>If the state board rejects the plan, it can seize fiscal power from Nassau's elected officials. Tonight, the  board was still encouraging the three sides to meet and try to come up with consensus, and Ms. Jacobs said she was open to changing the plan.</p>
        <p>The Democrats said their four-year plan includes a $2.28 billion  budget for 2001 -- $60 million larger than the one proposed last month by Mr. Gulotta. The Democrats said their plan would balance the books by cutting about $110 million in spending and raising more than $65 million in additional property taxes.</p>
        <p>All told, the average household would pay about $155 more next year in the county portion of property taxes, which make up 19 percent of local property tax bills, aides to Ms. Jacobs said. The plan would also raise county property taxes by about 3 percent in each of the following three years.</p>
        <p>Democratic aides said the 2001 budget increases spending on some items and trims costs in other areas. The Democrats had called for a surplus of $18.9 million next year, but they reduced that to $15.8 million. They decreased a proposed reserve fund to $10 million from $13 million.</p>
        <p>Both sides in the Legislature -- as well as the state board -- criticized Mr. Gulotta's proposed rescue plan when he submitted it last month. But  policy rifts drove the two sides apart.  The Republicans opposed any increases in spending over what Mr. Gulotta requested. The Democrats said that while they were wary of increasing spending, they were not willing to limit financing for services, like clearing roads of snow or heating the county buildings, that would affect residents.</p>
        <p>Both sides agreed to oppose Mr. Gulotta's proposal to lay off more than 300 unionized county workers and to reject tentative contracts he negotiated with county police officers and detectives that would provide 22 percent raises over the next five years.</p>
        <p>In addition, the budget plan passed tonight would eliminate 64 nonunion positions in 12 county departments.</p>
        <p>The plan also includes money to hire entry-level replacements for  some of the roughly 800 county employees who are retiring or leaving the county payroll, including about 200 police officers.</p>
        <p>In the county Public Works and  Parks departments, the plan includes money to replace about 15 percent to 20 percent of the positions being vacated, though Democrats originally proposed 50 percent. That saved $1 million, they said, but made Anthony Giustino, the president of Local 830 of the Civil Service Employees Association, visibly angry.</p>
        <p>''We're watching the death of Nassau County, unless they provide the people who provide the services,'' Mr. Giustino said.</p>
        <p>All eyes are now on Mr. Gulotta.  The latest he can act on the plan is Nov. 6, one day before Election Day, legislative leaders said. If he vetoes an item, like a property tax increase, he cannot incrementally raise or lower that figure, but can only revert to the proposal he made last month.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schmitt said that he believed that Mr. Gulotta would not veto any part of the budget because he will be glad to have the extra money the Democrats put into it. ''He'll take the money and run,'' Mr. Schmitt said.</p>
        <p>If Mr. Gulotta exercises his veto power, the Legislature will have the following seven days to try to override any vetoes, lawmakers said. But  a 13-vote majority would be needed,  so some Republican support would be essential.</p>
        <p>Once a final plan is set, the state  board will review it. The board could suggest modifications be made by the Legislature. It has given no specific date by which it promises to act, Mr. Bloch said.</p>
        <p>''The story goes through November and into December,'' said Robert W. Lazaro, a spokesman for Mr. Schmitt, the Republican minority leader. ''The possibilities, the variations are limitless.''</p>
