        <p>Continuing a pace set by United States banks, UBS of Switzerland, one of Europe's largest banks, reported results yesterday that exceeded analyst expectations as profits at UBS Warburg, its investment banking arm, more than doubled.</p>
        <p>UBS said third-quarter profit rose 73 percent, to 2.08 billion Swiss francs ($1.14 billion), compared with 1.2 billion Swiss francs ($659.8 million) in the comparable period of 1999.

        <p>Continuing a pace set by United States banks, UBS of Switzerland, one of Europe's largest banks, reported results yesterday that exceeded analyst expectations as profits at UBS Warburg, its investment banking arm, more than doubled.</p>
        <p>UBS said third-quarter profit rose 73 percent, to 2.08 billion Swiss francs ($1.14 billion), compared with 1.2 billion Swiss francs ($659.8 million) in the comparable period of 1999. The consensus estimate had been for profits of 1.9 billion Swiss francs ($659.8 million), according to First Call/Thomson Financial.</p>
        <p>Profits at UBS Warburg doubled to 1.1 billion Swiss francs ($604.8 million), compared with 543 million Swiss francs ($298.6 million) in the third quarter last year, though they declined 15 percent from the second quarter of this year.</p>
        <p>UBS reported preliminary results, in order to provide transparency before its $12 billion acquisition of the PaineWebber Group closes in early November. The bank will report detailed results on Nov. 28.</p>
        <p>Romain Burnand, an analyst with J. P. Morgan, said he had expected investment banking fees to decline 30 percent from the second quarter. In light of that expectation, he said, results were very strong.</p>
        <p>Advising clients like Pacific Century CyberWorks on its $35.9 billion bid for Cable and Wireless, and Unilever on its $24 billion purchase of Bestfoods has helped UBS Warbug edge up in the ranking of deal makers. At the end of the third quarter, it jumped to third place in European target and acquisition advice, from fifth place in 1999 according to Thomson Financial Services. UBS shares rose 3.8 percent yesterday, to 240.50 Swiss francs ($132.24).</p>
        <p>In general, European bank stocks have been under pressure. An index of these stocks tracked by Datastream, a unit of Thomson Financial, has fallen 13 percent from its highs of nearly a year ago.</p>
        <p>In addition to concerns over the effects a slowing economy would have on bank stocks, investors have worried that some banks have lent too much money to telecommunications companies, which are now saddled with debt as they try to finance the ballooning costs of third-generation mobile phone licenses. European regulators, who have warned banks against lending these companies too much money, have echoed that fear.</p>
        <p>''The main long-term worry for the banking sector is the creditworthiness of telecommunications companies,'' Mr. Burnand said, though he pointed out that UBS, which he rates a ''market perform,'' is one of the least at risk.</p>
        <p>UBS is in a special position in that it is one of the few European banks, along with Credit Suisse First Boston, to have reduced its loan portfolio the last two years as returns in that area paled in comparison with more lucrative securities underwriting and investment banking fees.</p>
        <p>For the third quarter, profits from private-banking clients, traditionally one of UBS's strongest businesses, increased 3.5 percent, to 707 million Swiss francs ($388.7 million).</p>
        <p>Asset management showed some improvement. According to analysts, the company saw an inflow of money that reversed a downward trend created, in part, by the poor performance of Phillips &amp; Drew, the British fund manager owned by UBS.</p>
