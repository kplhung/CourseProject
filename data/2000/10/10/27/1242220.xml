        <p>Stumping through the socially conservative western reaches of this important swing state, Gov. George W. Bush today questioned the integrity, courage and moral character of Vice President Al Gore and called the presidential race a matter of values.</p>
        <p>With thinly veiled references to the ethical travails of the Clinton administration, Mr. Bush pledged to usher in ''a responsibility era'' in which government would be smaller, less intrusive and guided by clear morals.</p>
        <p>''In my administration, we will ask not only what is legal but also what is right, not just what the lawyers allow but what the public deserves,'' Mr. Bush told more than 1,000 boisterous supporters at the Soldiers and Sailors Museum here in Pittsburgh. ''In my administration, we will make it clear there is the controlling legal authority of conscience.''</p>
        <p>The Bush campaign plans to highlight the responsibility message in a television commercial that will begin running on Friday in Illinois and in California, a state that was considered in Mr. Gore's column just a few weeks ago but now seems in play.</p>
        <p>''I believe we need to encourage personal responsibility so people are accountable for their actions,'' Mr. Bush says in the 30-second spot. ''There's a big difference in philosophy between my opponent and me. He trusts government. I trust you.''</p>
        <p>Pennsylvania, with 23 electoral votes, is among the largest states still up for grabs, and the western end, once considered a Democratic bastion, has become fruitful territory for Republican candidates. The region, dotted by shuttered steel mills and coal mines, is home to many socially conservative Democrats who support New Deal-era programs like Social Security but also want a strong military and oppose abortion, political analysts say.</p>
        <p>''One of the reasons the race in Pennsylvania has tightened is that Gore is slipping in western Pennsylvania,'' said G. Terry Madonna, a political scientist at Millersville University.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush was accompanied today by a native of western Pennsylvania, Gov. Tom Ridge. And, to bolster his theme that he would deal better than Mr. Gore with military matters, he  brought along to the Soldiers and Sailors Museum three Medal of Honor winners and Gen. Colin L. Powell, who introduced him.</p>
        <p>''He understands,'' General Powell said, ''that the first responsibility of a president is to serve as commander of chief of the armed forces of the United States.'' Echoing Republican criticism of the Clinton administration's military policies, the general added that Mr. Bush would make sure American troops sent to fight overseas would go with ''clear missions'' and ''be given everything they need to win, to win decisively.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Bush touched only briefly on military issues, focusing instead on ''responsibility,'' a word he used in some formulation at least 25 times in a speech of roughly 20 minutes.</p>
        <p>The governor, who afterward met privately with the Roman Catholic bishop of Pittsburgh, Donald W. Wuerl, set the moral tone of his address early by talking longer than usual about his wife, Laura, who was at home in Austin. ''We've got a great, great relationship,'' Mr. Bush said. ''As a matter of fact, our marriage is even stronger than it was before, after this campaign. Yeah, it was strong to begin with.''</p>
        <p>Though he frequently criticizes Mr. Gore as a negative campaigner, Mr. Bush salted his speech with not-so-subtle digs at the vice president's  personality, which some critics describe as pedantic or overbearing.</p>
        <p>''Lectures don't replace leadership,'' Mr. Bush said at one point.</p>
        <p>But more often the governor attacked Mr. Gore's character, asserting that he lacked the constancy or vision to be a strong leader.</p>
        <p>''A good leader is predictable; he doesn't try to be all things to all people, or change personalities, say, for different debates,'' Mr. Bush said. ''I believe when it is all said and done, America will realize my opponent's campaign is a fitting close to the Clinton-Gore years. They are going out as they came in: their guide, the nightly polls; their goal, the morning headlines; their legacy, the fruitless search for a legacy.''</p>
        <p>Kym Spell, a spokeswoman for the Gore candidacy, derided Mr. Bush's speech as evidence that his campaign was ''getting very, very nervous'' about what she described as his declining poll numbers, although  in fact most national polls continue to show the race too close to call.</p>
        <p>''George Bush,'' Ms. Spell said, ''is trying to divert attention away from the fact that he lacks the experience and judgment to lead this nation.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush also used the themes of trust and responsibility to try to draw stark contrasts between his policy proposals and Mr. Gore's. He would trust taxpayers to invest part of their Social Security taxes in private investment accounts, he said, while Mr. Gore would not. He would give parents the freedom to use federal education aid for private schools or tutoring, while Mr. Gore would not. He would give all workers tax cuts, while Mr. Gore would give tax relief only to the ''right'' people, as determined by bureaucrats.</p>
        <p>''I believe government works best when it relies on the good judgment and the common sense of the people themselves,'' Mr. Bush said. ''In a responsibility era, government must trust the people. And in return, in a responsibility era, people should be able to trust their government.''</p>
        <p>Outside the soldiers museum, the Bush motorcade was met by 20 students from the University of Pittsburgh who were chanting: ''Sexist, racist, antigay! George W., go away!''</p>
        <p>Some of the students carried the green signs of Ralph Nader's Green Party ticket, while others waved blue Gore-Lieberman posters.</p>
        <p>''We're trying to convince the Nader people to vote for Gore,'' said one protest organizer, Brandon Harris, vice president of the University of Pittsburgh Democrats. ''But we're all against Bush.''</p>
        <p>In His Own Words</p>
        <p>GEORGE W. BUSH  Remarks yesterday at a rally in Pittsburgh:</p>
        <p>''For too long, our culture has sent the message, If it feels good, do it and if you've got a problem, just go ahead and blame somebody else.</p>
        <p>Each of us must understand that's not right. Each of us must understand that we are responsible for the decisions and choices we make in life. . . .</p>
        <p>In helping families and communities, we should give them options, not orders. We should trust people with responsibility. We should help them live their lives, not try to run their lives. . . .</p>
        <p>On the major issues before America, this is the choice. I believe younger workers, for example, should be trusted to invest some of their own payroll tax for their own retirement. It is necessary, and it's going to be part of a stronger Social Security system that will build personal wealth and independence. My opponent, he's opposed to trusting workers to manage some of their own money. . . .</p>
        <p>For decades, we have tried to solve problems with rules and mandates from distant bureaucracies and theories from far-away federal experts. But this doesn't solve communities' problems. It doesn't answer the need. My opponent is promoting a big buildup of big government. Make no mistake about it. More spending, more programs, more of Washington talking down to us and thinking on our behalf.''</p>
