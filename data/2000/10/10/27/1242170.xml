        <p>It's hard to dislike a romantic comedy that's infatuated with the concept of love, even if its hero is a guy who can't help pulling his pants down at the wrong time. In ''Loving Jezebel,'' that guy is Theodorus (Hill Harper), who has spent his whole life chasing currently attached women and starts the picture running from a jealous husband. Though ''Jezebel'' begins with Roy Ayers's song ''Love Will Bring Us Back Together'' -- part of a well-used score of old songs and new music that never becomes heavy-handed -- we should be hearing Joy Division's ''Love Will Tear Us Apart.''</p>
        <p>Theodorus is in a constant state of misery. From his dazed and self-dramatizing perspective, the movie follows his search for the right woman, starting with his first failed love affair in elementary school. Incapable of judging any romantic entanglement, he follows his heart and other parts of his anatomy into trouble. He falls in and out of love so often that he should buy kneepads for his heart, though the long-waisted beauties he pursues -- an exaltation of sylphs born to slink past a movie camera in slow motion -- would turn any man's head.</p>

        <p>It's hard to dislike a romantic comedy that's infatuated with the concept of love, even if its hero is a guy who can't help pulling his pants down at the wrong time. In ''Loving Jezebel,'' that guy is Theodorus (Hill Harper), who has spent his whole life chasing currently attached women and starts the picture running from a jealous husband. Though ''Jezebel'' begins with Roy Ayers's song ''Love Will Bring Us Back Together'' -- part of a well-used score of old songs and new music that never becomes heavy-handed -- we should be hearing Joy Division's ''Love Will Tear Us Apart.''</p>
        <p>Theodorus is in a constant state of misery. From his dazed and self-dramatizing perspective, the movie follows his search for the right woman, starting with his first failed love affair in elementary school. Incapable of judging any romantic entanglement, he follows his heart and other parts of his anatomy into trouble. He falls in and out of love so often that he should buy kneepads for his heart, though the long-waisted beauties he pursues -- an exaltation of sylphs born to slink past a movie camera in slow motion -- would turn any man's head.</p>
        <p>Kwyn Bader's story is a flirt, and when the movie seems in danger of taking itself too seriously, it grabs a laugh to offer relief, as when Theodorus becomes a street clown who leaves children mystified, too befuddled to cry. Or when he sleeps with the off-and-on girlfriend of his friend Necco (the nimble Andre Baker), and Necco snipes that Theodorus is just like the ''teardrop Jackie Wilson sang about: you always want what you can't have.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bader was lucky to get a good cast that includes his star, the boyish and intense -- and intensely boyish -- Mr. Harper, who seems created to turn his spaniel eyes into the lens. He can cajole when he has to; in the down-at-the-heels comedy ''Hav Plenty'' he was the embarrassingly low-down singer who could slip out of a silky marriage proposal to burst into a grin and sell his latest CD to any passer-by. Mr. Harper's quicksilver adroitness keeps Theodorus's search for love quizzical; his demonstrativeness prevents the proceedings from becoming too sticky, though being forced to deliver lines like ''Even a soul-touching love could not last'' are mushily soulful.</p>
        <p>Mr. Harper can almost get away with playing an overeager, undersexed high-schooler, in a flashback in which he aptly describes the suburbanites of 1986 he grew up around as ''girls who watched 'The Breakfast Club' 17 times.'' (''Loving Jezebel'' refers to other signposts of the 80's: Theodorus dances in his skivvies, doing splits and showing that he and Mr. Bader, who wrote and directed the film, have seen ''Risky Business'' once or twice. And his overprotective mother is played by Phylicia Rashad, mother of a Theo on ''The Cosby Show.'')</p>
        <p>''Loving Jezebel'' sometimes plays like a more earnest version of ''The Ladies Man'' (although it was completed earlier). The movie itself isn't on the make. Wisely, Mr. Bader doesn't try to overanalyze his hero or turn him into a graduate of the ''Def Jam's How to Be a Player'' school of film sleaze artists. (It's a Starz production, and it's a pleasure to see a film financed by a pay-cable outfit that is not a second-rate genre picture.)</p>
        <p>''Loving Jezebel'' becomes a good-natured boys' version of ''She's Gotta Have It,'' Spike Lee's first feature. Like that film, this one feels as if it comes out of a world close to the director's heart, with its biracial hero stumbling into coupling with women of all races and refusing to make a big deal of any of this, a totally modern gesture in today's dreamy Manhattan, where anything is possible. That includes catching the attention of a group of willowy, teasing drama queens, among them Nicole Ari Parker and Sandrine Holt.</p>
        <p>There are a few times when ''Jezebel'' is a little too obvious: for example when Theodorus tells his most recent crush, Samantha (Laurel Holloman), whose distraction makes her seem like a comedy heroine of the 1930's, that he has spent his entire life ''loving Jezebel.''</p>
        <p>When she asks, ''What's a Jezebel?,'' the screen goes black and -- sigh -- flashes the words ''Jezebel: a woman who engages in amorous activity with someone other than her declared mate.'' Mr. Bader shortchanges himself when he follows an urge to explain. A Candide who's too blinded by his pursuit of the purity of love to see how he's ruining his own life and others' doesn't need simplification.</p>
        <p>''Loving Jezebel'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes many scenes of romantic pursuit and strong language.</p>
        <p>LOVING JEZEBEL</p>
