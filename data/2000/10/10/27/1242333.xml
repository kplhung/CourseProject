        <p>Americas Society  680 Park Avenue, at 68th Street  Through Nov. 5</p>
        <p>In Canada before World War I, the prevailing styles of painting were still European. Some artists, however, dreamed of an art that would be both modern and distinctively Canadian. One of these was Lawren Stewart Harris (1885-1970). After the war, he and six friends formed the famous Group of Seven, a collective dedicated to the advancement of a truly national vision.</p>
        <p>The most compelling works in this engaging Harris retrospective are wilderness landscapes from the 1920's and early 30's. Snowy mountains, remote lakes and lonesome houses are depicted in a simplifying style like Georgia O'Keeffe's. In ''Isolation Peak'' (circa 1930), a coldly sunlit, pyramidal mountain rises from rolling green foothills against an ominous, dark gray sky, a monument of pantheistic conviction. Like other pictures from this period, it has a visionary radiance bordering on Disney-like animation.</p>
        <p>Before that middle period came colorful early landscapes and townscapes skillfully made under the influence of French Impressionism and Post-Impressionism. Later, in the mid-30's, Harris turned away from his heroic Canadianism and embarked on an approach that lasted until the end of his life -- one devoted to abstraction inspired by theosophy, transcendentalism and Kandinsky.</p>
        <p>First he combined hard-edged geometry with illusionistic space and light to futuristic effect; later his line became more fluid and forms flattened out into undulating patterns. Harris's abstract work is not totally uninteresting, but its hokey mysticism and busy graphic cleverness make one wish he had not abandoned nature.</p>
