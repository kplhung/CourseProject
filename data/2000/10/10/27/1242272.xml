        <p>The number of students applying to medical schools has shrunk by a fifth in the last four years, reflecting what health professionals described as a growing disenchantment with life under managed care, coupled with blossoming opportunities in other fields.</p>
        <p>According to the Association of American Medical Colleges, 37,137 students competed for 16,303 seats at medical schools, a 3.6 percent decline from last year's applications and 21 percent lower than the record 46,968 students who applied to medical schools in 1996.</p>

        <p>The number of students applying to medical schools has shrunk by a fifth in the last four years, reflecting what health professionals described as a growing disenchantment with life under managed care, coupled with blossoming opportunities in other fields.</p>
        <p>According to the Association of American Medical Colleges, 37,137 students competed for 16,303 seats at medical schools, a 3.6 percent decline from last year's applications and 21 percent lower than the record 46,968 students who applied to medical schools in 1996.</p>
        <p>''The application process is expensive, time-consuming and ego-bruising, so people don't apply to medical school unless they have a reasonable chance of acceptance,'' said Dr. Jordan J. Cohen, president of the association, which represents the 125 accredited medical schools.</p>
        <p>At the same time, the association, in a report released yesterday, cited  two trends that it called encouraging. The quality of this year's applicants, as measured by college grade averages, is improving, and scores on standardized tests remain high. And after shrinking for several years, the number of blacks, Hispanics and American Indians applying increased slightly.</p>
        <p>Dr. Cohen and others attributed the decline in those aspiring to become doctors to a strong economy that offered good salaries in fields requiring less onerous and costly training than medicine. The typical medical student faces several years of residency work at a hospital after completing medical school, which he or she leaves with an average debt of $90,000.</p>
        <p>Sindu Srinivas, president of the American Medical Student Association, said that many would-be doctors were discouraged by older physicians who expressed frustration with managed care and by media portrayals of a health care system in trouble.</p>
        <p>''As a student, you hear a lot of comments from practicing doctors: 'You shouldn't go into medicine now. It's not as good as it used to be.' And the media's played that up,'' Ms. Srinivas said.</p>
        <p>The decline was sharpest for white males, of whom 6 percent fewer applied to medical school this year than last. But this year's crop of applicants reversed a three-year decline in the number of black, Hispanic and  American Indian men seeking to enter medical school. The increase in black men was 5 percent, while the overall increase in minority men seeking admission to medical school was 4 percent. The numbers of non-Asian minority women applying fell slightly.</p>
        <p>Beth Bailey, director of admissions at the University of Virginia School of Medicine, said the applicant pool remained strong.</p>
        <p>''Nobody's terribly worried at this point,'' Ms. Bailey said. ''The decline is from an all-time historical high in '95, '96, when we had three times as many applicants as there were positions nationally.''</p>
        <p>But what does concern Ms. Bailey, and Dr. Srinivas and Dr. Cohen, is the general decline over time in black, Hispanic and American Indian students. According to the association's figures, even with this year's admission figures, the number of underrepresented minorities in medical school has dropped 15 percent since its 1994 peak, to 1,729 students from 2,022.</p>
