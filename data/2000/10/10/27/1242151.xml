        <p>HOOKING UP  By Tom Wolfe  293 pages. Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux. $25.</p>
        <p>The reader of the new Tom Wolfe anthology, ''Hooking Up,'' comes away with three impressions: that Mr. Wolfe is a keen observer and stylist, using his magnetic eye for social details and high-caloric prose to energize his reportage; that he employs those same gifts in his fiction, but frequently uses them to stack the deck against his heroes; and that he is even less fair-minded in his essays, substituting gross simplifications, dubious assertions and highly selective case studies for reasoned argument. The reporter as showman too often becomes the social critic as con man.</p>

        <p>HOOKING UP  By Tom Wolfe  293 pages. Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux. $25.</p>
        <p>The reader of the new Tom Wolfe anthology, ''Hooking Up,'' comes away with three impressions: that Mr. Wolfe is a keen observer and stylist, using his magnetic eye for social details and high-caloric prose to energize his reportage; that he employs those same gifts in his fiction, but frequently uses them to stack the deck against his heroes; and that he is even less fair-minded in his essays, substituting gross simplifications, dubious assertions and highly selective case studies for reasoned argument. The reporter as showman too often becomes the social critic as con man.</p>
        <p>A decidedly eclectic volume, ''Hooking Up'' consists of pieces spanning some three and a half decades in Mr. Wolfe's career, from the notorious Herald Tribune pieces on the New Yorker magazine, written back in 1965, through the short story ''Ambush at Fort Bragg'' (1996), which sends up the TV news business, to a new essay on America on the brink of the millennium. Among the pieces are a vivid portrait of Bob Noyce, a founder of Intel and a Silicon Valley pioneer; a self-serving account of Mr. Wolfe's reaction to the petulant (and self-serving) reviews of ''A Man in Full'' written by John Updike and Norman Mailer; two cursory meditations on sociobiology and the theories of Edward O. Wilson; and a high-decibel screed against intellectuals and the American left.</p>
        <p>It should come as no surprise to longtime followers of Mr. Wolfe that his writing is animated by an old-fashioned faith in the American Dream. He clearly admires entrepreneurs and engineers like Mr. Noyce -- small town boys, for the most part, from the Middle West and West -- who inherited ''the moral capital of the 19th century'' and embodied an old-fashioned pioneer spirit. And he clearly believes in a triumphalist vision of America. ''The country,'' he writes, ''turned into what the utopian socialists of the 19th century, the Saint-Simons and Fouriers, had dreamed about: an El Dorado where the average workingman would have the political freedom, the personal freedom, the money, and the free time to fulfill his potential in any way he saw fit.''</p>
        <p>In ''The Right Stuff,'' his last novel, ''A Man in Full,'' and many of his early nonfiction pieces, this outlook has helped produce some wonderfully vital examinations of the ''irresistibly lurid carnival of American life.'' In this volume, however, Mr. Wolfe spends less time heading ''out into this wild, bizarre, unpredictable, Hog-stomping Baroque country of ours'' and more time standing back and passing judgment on its denizens: fascination and bemusement have increasingly given way to a curmudgeonly anger; social inventories and satire to a demagoguery based on sweeping generalizations devoid of nuance or qualification.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wolfe peremptorily declares that by the year 2000 in America, ''the average electrician, air-conditioning mechanic, or burglar-alarm repairman lived a life that would have made the Sun King blink,'' guzzling pints of expensive designer water and spending ''his vacations in Puerto Vallarta, Barbados, or St. Kitts'' (never mind the millions of Americans without health insurance).</p>
        <p>He hails America as ''the International Haven of Democracy,'' opening ''her arms to people from all over the globe'' and making ''sure they enjoyed full civil rights'' (never mind the thousands of Haitians and other immigrants facing deportation).</p>
        <p>And he complains that the old term ''dating'' is ''now deader'' than the terms ''pornography'' and ''perversion,'' that ''cohabitation was now the standard form of American courtship'' (never mind the pockets of strict fundamentalism in the country, never mind talk of a ''new celibacy'' in the face of AIDS).</p>
        <p>Whereas Mr. Wolfe's earlier works of reportage reveled in the multifarious reality of America, his essays in recent years -- beginning with ''The Painted Word'' (1975) and ''From Bauhaus to Our House'' (1981) -- have grown more and more dogmatic, imposing on the reader a single and decidedly subjective way of looking at the world. It's an approach that steamrollers all distinctions, ignores all dissenting evidence and distracts attention from the valid points Mr. Wolfe wants to make about self-indulgence and political correctness.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wolfe characterizes the 20th century as making a Promethean ''start from zero,'' even though the democratic strivings of that era had roots in Enlightenment notions of individualism and progress. And he predicts that ''the 21st century will have a retrograde look and a retrograde mental atmosphere,'' despite the leaps in technology and science already being made.</p>
        <p>When it comes to the novel, Mr. Wolfe demonstrates an equally absolutist view, amplifying the call for social realism that he laid out in a controversial essay in Harper's magazine in 1989. In his view, only realistic novels based on reporting and a first-hand engagement with the world -- like his own novels ''Bonfire of the Vanities'' and ''A Man in Full'' -- are capable of fulfilling the medium's power. He shrugs off Henry James as a ''sensibility wafter,'' in thrall to decadent European ideas, and dismisses his critics -- John Irving as well as Mr. Updike and Mr. Mailer, whom he dubs ''my three stooges'' -- as ''insular, effete and irrelevant.''</p>
        <p>Despite remarkable novels published in recent years by writers like Don DeLillo, Thomas Pynchon and Philip Roth, Mr. Wolfe contends that ''the American novel is dying, not of obsolescence, but of anorexia,'' that it needs more writers (like himself, presumably) ''with huge appetites and mighty, unslaked thirsts for . . . America . . . as she is right now.''</p>
        <p>Such assertions leave the reader with the impression that Mr. Wolfe, in his guise as essayist, belongs to that species he dimissively calls ''the Intellectual'' -- a species, he claims, that has ''no knowledge of academic or scientific developments other than the sort of stuff you might pick up in Section 9 of the Sunday newspaper,'' a species purveying ''cynicism, irony and contempt'' and equipped only with indignation and an unpleasant sneer.</p>
