      <abstract>
        <p>Op-Ed column by Gail Collins appraises Gov George W Bush's campaign as it travels through central Florida; says Bush has improved his delivery, but his message is same one he delivered during primaries; says if Bush wins election, it will be because Vice Pres Al Gore ran sodden, plodding campaign, and Bush stretched just enough to leap across a three-inch bar (M)</p>

        <p>History will look back and remember this as the presidential campaign in which candidates finally understood the importance of combining the very best characteristics of participatory democracy and professional wrestling.</p>
        <p>GEEEEEEEOOOOOOORRRGE BUUUUUUUSH!!!!!!! Cue the balloons and the confetti. Here comes the candidate, into a state fair exhibition hall, driving right up to the platform in his big van while the colored lights flash and the cheerleaders from the Lakeland Christian School hop around and the crowd stamps its feet and waves pom-poms and Van Halen blares over the P.A. system. A couple of elderly people faint, and little kids swivel their hips and stick their fists in the air.</p>
        <p>''The next president of the United States! He's my brother and I love him more than life!'' cries Florida's governor, Jeb Bush.</p>
        <p>Jeb has got to feel as if the movie somehow got its reels mixed. He was always the serious son, the focus of his family's political hopes. Now it's as if Jimmy Carter woke up one morning and found they'd nominated Billy.</p>
        <p>As the Bush motorcade sped through central Florida this week, it was hard to decide who was having less fun -- Jeb, who got to hear himself referred to as ''my big little brother'' at every stop, or John McCain, whom George W. repeatedly thanked for his assistance in ''putting me through my paces'' in the New Hampshire primary.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCain, last February's hero, is now relegated to opening act for the only presidential candidate who is not in favor of the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform program. After all that talk about being a new kind of politician, the senator is in danger of going down in history as the man who gave American elections the confetti blower.</p>
        <p>''There is nobility in serving a cause greater than your self-interest, and that's what a Gore-Cheney presidency means,'' he told a crowd at Seminole Community College. It was what we in the Bush bubble like to call a subliminable moment.</p>
        <p>When George W. took the stage, he prowled back and forth, microphone in hand, shoulders just a little hunched, head jutting forward, talkin' trash about Al Gore as if they were scheduled for an upcoming rumble over the W.W.F. Intercontinental Television Championship Title Belt.</p>
        <p>''Unbelievably,'' he growled, ''when you add up all the promises, his promises are greater than when you combine the promises of Michael Dukakis and Walter Mondale combined. Yeah. That's going some.'' (It's not that the comparison means anything -- he just likes saying ''Dukakis'' and ''Mondale.'')</p>
        <p>The George W. Bush who's ending this campaign is a different candidate from the one who started it. Temperamentally, he's always been very even. (Given the fact that he's gotten virtually everything he's reached out for since his 40th birthday, a certain degree of sunniness seems like the least he could do.) But he no longer keeps referring every topic back to how they do things in Texas, and he's finally figured out how to explain his tax plan. At long last, he has applause lines. This has him so pleased and proud he's practically levitating.</p>
        <p>Except for a new fascination with prescription drugs for the elderly, Mr. Bush's issues are still the ones he was hammering away at during the primaries. The tax cut for wealthy Americans is still a matter of morality. (''It's the right thing to do! It's the right thing to give people's money back!'') He still avoids the sticky social issues, although in Florida the Boy Scouts suddenly popped up in his examples of the ''vast army of compassion'' the government has to encourage. He's still promising to end gridlock in Washington, as if he were an emissary from another continent preparing to negotiate a truce between the Gegs and the Tosks. He still promises to let the young'uns invest their Social Security money, and he is still not telling how much the government will cut their benefits in return.</p>
        <p>But if he wins the election, it will be because Al Gore ran a sodden, plodding campaign, and Mr. Bush stretched just enough to leap across a three-inch bar. Plus, he had much better fireworks.</p>
