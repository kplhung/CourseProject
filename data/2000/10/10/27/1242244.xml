        <p>Conservatives for Effective Leadership was set up last year with an urgent mission: to rain the fury of the right wing -- $10 million worth of fury, its founders promised -- on Hillary Rodham Clinton's Senate campaign in New York. The group would expose her record, condemn her agenda and impugn her ethics. Hound her back to Arkansas.</p>
        <p>''There's nothing that we won't do to keep Hillary out of office,'' it declared in a fund-raising letter in the summer of 1999.</p>
        <p>But with less than two weeks to go before the election, Conservatives for Effective Leadership has vanished, without playing any role in the campaign. And it is not alone.</p>
        <p>When Mrs. Clinton entered the race, many conservative groups huffed and puffed and vowed to defeat her. In all, the groups said, they would pour at least $35 million and probably more into the New York race. So far, they appear to have spent little -- and in many cases nothing -- against her.</p>
        <p>The groups include Save Our Senate, established by some political consultants in California, and ConserveAmerica, the brainchild of a 29-year-old in Westchester County who said he planned a $5 million war chest against Mrs. Clinton.</p>
        <p>Only one group, the Emergency Committee to Stop Hillary Rodham Clinton, seems to have had any fund-raising success. It had planned to collect $9 million, and by Sept. 30, had taken in $1.8 million.</p>
        <p>But nearly all those receipts have gone to direct-mail expenses, including fees charged by direct-mail companies with ties to the group's leaders, rather than to the New York race. The group is actually heavily in debt, and owes $2.4 million for direct-mail expenses.</p>
        <p>If anything, the conservative groups have been a liability for the Republican candidate, Representative Rick A. Lazio, who has sought to present himself as a moderate. The Lazio campaign, which has raised money easily, has begun criticizing the groups, saying they cared only about their own interests rather than his election.</p>
        <p>It is still possible that a spurt of spending could occur at the end of the race. Mrs. Clinton's aides, while acknowledging that these groups have not been a significant factor so far, say that they fear a sudden attack by an existing or little-known one. They note that just before the Republican presidential primary in New York in March, a newly created group that supported Gov. George W. Bush of Texas paid for commercials attacking Mr. Bush's opponent, Senator John McCain of Arizona.</p>
        <p>Created in a blaze of self-promotion, Conservatives for Effective Leadership apparently expired quietly earlier this year. Whether it harvested a major amount of money -- and if it did, what happened to that money -- is unclear. Though it described itself as a political action committee, it never filed disclosure documents with the Federal Election Commission.</p>
        <p>In July 1999, Gary Nolan, a nationally syndicated radio talk show host who was a founder of the group, said the response to its first mailing of 40,000 fund-raising letters was ''huge,'' though he declined to provide details. Mr. Nolan did not respond to three telephone messages seeking comment.</p>
        <p>Another founder, Craig Shirley, a political consultant in Washington, sought to distance himself from the group, referring questions to Mr. Nolan. ''I really haven't been involved with it in quite a while,'' Mr. Shirley said.</p>
        <p>Only the Emergency Committee to Stop Hillary Rodham Clinton -- an alliance of Washington elders like Edwin Meese III, attorney general under President Reagan -- appears to have raised significant sums.</p>
        <p>But new disclosure records filed with the F.E.C. show that the committee is $2.4 million in debt to direct-mail companies and consultants, including Richard A. Viguerie, the well-known conservative direct-mail expert with longstanding relationships to the committee's leaders. In other words, the committee has spent nearly $4 million on fund-raising, and little if anything against Mrs. Clinton.</p>
        <p>Oddly enough, in September, the committee made direct contributions of $1,000 to $2,000 each to the campaigns of seven Congressional candidates, but not to Mr. Lazio's campaign.</p>
        <p>Mark Montini, a spokesman for the committee, which is also known as the Conservative Leadership PAC, defended its expenditures, saying that it hoped to buy commercials attacking Mrs. Clinton before the end of the campaign. ''We have a pretty big donor list that we are obviously still working with,'' he said. ''I am very comfortable with where we are.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Montini said the group had sent a commercial to television stations in New York, though it had not yet bought air time.</p>
        <p>The committee paid Mr. Viguerie, the direct-mail consultant, and his associates and companies a total of $178,000, and owes them $684,000, the records show. An assistant to Mr. Viguerie said he was not available to comment.</p>
        <p>Another group, the American Conservative Union, had said it would spend $7 million in the race. Its political action committee has collected $44,000 this year, said the group's executive director, Christian Josi.</p>
        <p>Mr. Josi noted that the group had used other funds, which he declined to describe, to mail a slender paperback titled ''Hillary Rodham Clinton: What Every American Should Know'' to New Yorkers. He said two  million copies had been sent, but that figure could not be independently verified.</p>
        <p>While the conservative groups said they were dedicated to defeating Mrs. Clinton, they have been snubbed by Mr. Lazio and his predecessor, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who dropped out of the race in May.</p>
        <p>''The dirty little secret about all these groups all along,'' said a spokesman for the Lazio campaign, Dan McLagan, ''is that they were in it to line their own pockets and make sure that their pets were never in danger of having to eat real pet food. It was never about helping us. We knew that, and the Clinton people knew that. And the supposedly quick-witted New York media should have known that.''</p>
        <p>What has especially annoyed the Lazio partisans is that by boasting about their plans, the groups provided the Clinton campaign with a convenient foil for its own fund-raising.</p>
        <p>Some of Mrs. Clinton's appeals cast her as an underdog by contending that conservative groups were amassing millions of dollars to beat her. But they neglect to mention that such spending has not occurred.</p>
        <p>For several weeks in late summer, Mrs. Clinton parried Mr. Lazio's call for a ban on spending by outside groups in the race by noting that many conservative organizations had said they were planning to aid his candidacy. By doing so, she was able to delay a pledge not to accept so-called soft-money spending by Democratic committees.</p>
        <p>In late September, the two candidates agreed to a ban on spending on television and radio commercials by outside groups, though some groups have said they will not abide by it. Those conservative groups that do abide by it can buy newspaper advertisements, engage in direct-mail advocacy and help finance voter drives.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the Clinton campaign, Howard Wolfson, said the campaign was not being unreasonable in assuming that the conservative groups would carry through with their spending goals because there was still time left to go on the attack. ''We take them very seriously,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The founder of ConserveAmerica, Carlo Pellicciari, said in an interview that collecting money against Mrs. Clinton was harder than he expected because donors were more willing to give to candidates than to outside groups. While his goal had been $5 million, in the first six months of this year he took in only $762, he said, adding that he then stopped fund-raising.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pellicciari, who lives in Eastchester, N.Y., and is in the property management business, said most of the outside groups were self-serving because they were not based in New York.</p>
        <p>''They saw an opportunity,'' he said. ''I saw an opportunity as well, but you know what, I have a vested interest as a taxpayer of New York.''</p>
        <p>He acknowledged that in the end, Mrs. Clinton had used the groups to her political advantage.</p>
        <p>''I was trying to use her,'' he said. ''And in the same way, she used me. But because she's Hillary Clinton and I'm Carlo Pellicciari, we're not at the same level. And she was better at it than I am.''</p>
