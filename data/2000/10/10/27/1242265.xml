        <p>Offering a hero's welcome and pledging to use his country's vast oil wealth as a political weapon, President Hugo Chavez today greeted Fidel Castro, the international figure whom he regards as his main mentor, ally and friend, at the start of the Cuban leader's first official state visit to Venezuela in more than 40 years.</p>

        <p>Offering a hero's welcome and pledging to use his country's vast oil wealth as a political weapon, President Hugo Chavez today greeted Fidel Castro, the international figure whom he regards as his main mentor, ally and friend, at the start of the Cuban leader's first official state visit to Venezuela in more than 40 years.</p>
        <p>Neither man made any public remarks this afternoon at an arrival ceremony that was broadcast in almost reverential tones on every television channel here. But Mr. Chavez, a left-leaning 46-year-old former Army paratrooper, said on Wednesday that his objective was to ''give oxygen to Cuba'' and Mr. Castro, regarded as an antiquated figure in many other parts of Latin America.</p>
        <p>''This visit fits into the definition of a new international policy,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The most important feature of Mr. Castro's trip, aside from the geopolitical symbolism that it conveys, is a bilateral oil agreement generally expected to be signed on Monday. Though final details have not been worked out, the accord would let Cuba ease the crippling shortage of fuel that it has suffered since the collapse of the Soviet Union by importing up to 100,000 barrels of oil daily from Venezuela at heavily discounted prices.</p>
        <p>Reimbursement will apparently also be on highly favorable terms. Mr. Chavez has said Cuba, which is also short of hard currency, will be allowed to repay in barter with products or even medical services provided by Cuban doctors unable to find work at home. That suggestion has drawn sharp criticism from Venezuelan doctors, who complain of low salaries and lack of government investment in hospitals, clinics and medical training programs.</p>
        <p>''From a numerical point of view, it is absolutely irrational to send oil to someone who is going to pay by sending us doctors,'' said Jesus Mendez Quijada, president of the Venezuelan Medical Federation. ''If they want to give the oil away for free, then they shouldn't use that as an excuse.''</p>
        <p>Since taking office in February 1999, Mr. Chavez has repeatedly expressed his admiration for Mr. Castro and the Cuban Revolution. In remarks made on a visit to Cuba in November, he said Venezuela and Cuba were swimming together ''toward the same sea of happiness and of real social justice and peace.''</p>
        <p>At a news conference here on Wednesday, he lauded Mr. Castro as ''an example of dignity and courage.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Castro has in turn made it clear that he regards Mr. Chavez as a kindred spirit. ''Chavez is passionate, combative and a fighter, like me,'' he said recently to a group of Venezuelan reporters who have been invited to Cuba, adding that he regards his younger colleague as a leader of ''great nobility'' and ''a revolutionary, like Bolivar, Marti and Washington.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Castro's five-day visit is highly contentious here, and not just among members of the sizable Cuban exile community that arrived after he seized power in 1959 and declared himself a Communist. Many Venezuelans remember and still resent the training and support that he gave in the 1960's to guerrilla groups that tried to overthrow an exemplary democratic government.</p>
        <p>Francisco Arias Cardenas, once Mr. Chavez's closest comrade in arms and now his most unrelenting opponent, urged Venezuelans to turn their car lights on and to bang pots and pans, a traditional form of protest in Latin America, to repudiate Mr. Castro's presence.</p>
        <p>After a state dinner on Friday night, Mr. Chavez and his guest plan to spend most of the weekend away from Caracas. On Saturday, they are scheduled to visit Mr. Chavez's home state, Barinas. A rematch of a baseball game they played against each other last year in Havana, won by Cuba, is also set, along with a guest appearance by Mr. Castro on Sunday on Mr. Chavez's weekly radio program, ''Hello, President.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Chavez said on Wednesday that he did not plan to play in the baseball game ''because I am out of shape.'' But he promised he would be in top form for the radio show, which usually runs about four hours but may have to be expanded to accommodate Mr. Castro's notorious longwindedness.</p>
        <p>''It is unforeseeable how long this transmission could last,'' Mr. Chavez said.</p>
