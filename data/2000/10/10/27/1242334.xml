        <p>'Inflight!'  Deitch Projects  76 Grand Street, SoHo  Through Nov. 4</p>
        <p>''Inflight!'' is a disappointing follow-up to Johan Grimonprez's ''Dial H-I-S-T-O-R-Y,'' a riveting 1997 film sardonically documenting the history of skyjacking through found film and video imagery, pop music and words from Don DeLillo novels.</p>
        <p>This time around Mr. Grimonprez has created a magazine: a parody of an in-flight publication filled with excerpts from popular books and magazine articles that describe most of the recorded instances in which airplanes have been illegally commandeered since 1930. It also includes an interview with Mr. Grimonprez, a brainy Belgian steeped in French ideological theory, and amusing directions to passengers of Skyjack Air about what to do in case of a skyjacking. Like the film, the magazine's aim is to expose how the media turn the sociopolitical complexities of history into spectacular infotainment.</p>
        <p>To set a context for the magazine, which is free for visitors, Mr. Grimonprez has created a mock airline waiting room with black foam seats, internally illuminated orange plastic coffee tables and graphics from the magazine blown up to wall scale. Boomboxes play a manic sound track of samples from airplane-disaster and other movies.</p>
        <p>It is all interesting but unfocused. The magazine, filled with mostly low-quality journalistic prose and blurry video stills, is not nearly as compelling to peruse as the film is to watch; and the waiting room feels theatrically perfunctory. One gets the point about how the mainstream media obfuscate political reality, but Mr. Grimonprez's scattershot satire would benefit from tighter framing.</p>
