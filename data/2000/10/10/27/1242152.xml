        <p>Watch a movie by Tom Tykwer, the German director best known for ''Run Lola Run,'' and one wants to jog, sprint even. In a furious blast of energy, that film and its flamingly red-haired star, Franka Potente, represent the mad dash of young Germans from years of immobility under the administration of Helmut Kohl, Germany's former chancellor. Or such was the intent of Mr. Tykwer, who is 34. ''Go, Helmut, go,'' he reiterated this week on the telephone from Hamburg.</p>
        <p>''Lola'' arrived in 1998, the year Mr. Kohl left office, and was inspired, Mr. Tykwer said, by the ''sheer euphoria of movement.'' Before that, by way of illustrating what was bothering his generation, he made ''Winter Sleepers,'' available Nov. 7 on tape and DVD from Winstar. At a ski resort in Bavaria, two couples Mr. Tykwer's age often find themselves staring into foggy snowscapes, transfixed by ennui. It's tough to get a relationship, or much else, going under those circumstances, so Mr. Tykwer stirs the pot with unexplainable and tantalizing elements that signal the furious breakout ahead in ''Lola.''</p>

        <p>Watch a movie by Tom Tykwer, the German director best known for ''Run Lola Run,'' and one wants to jog, sprint even. In a furious blast of energy, that film and its flamingly red-haired star, Franka Potente, represent the mad dash of young Germans from years of immobility under the administration of Helmut Kohl, Germany's former chancellor. Or such was the intent of Mr. Tykwer, who is 34. ''Go, Helmut, go,'' he reiterated this week on the telephone from Hamburg.</p>
        <p>''Lola'' arrived in 1998, the year Mr. Kohl left office, and was inspired, Mr. Tykwer said, by the ''sheer euphoria of movement.'' Before that, by way of illustrating what was bothering his generation, he made ''Winter Sleepers,'' available Nov. 7 on tape and DVD from Winstar. At a ski resort in Bavaria, two couples Mr. Tykwer's age often find themselves staring into foggy snowscapes, transfixed by ennui. It's tough to get a relationship, or much else, going under those circumstances, so Mr. Tykwer stirs the pot with unexplainable and tantalizing elements that signal the furious breakout ahead in ''Lola.''</p>
        <p>''I never relate a film to one I did before,'' he said. ''I only see motives that are reappearing, although they have a different rhythm and pacing.'' What keep appearing are strange forces of nature, fate, coincidence, chain reaction.</p>
        <p>In ''Winter Sleepers,'' released in Germany in 1997 and this year in the United States, a ski instructor named Marco (Heino Ferch) leaves the key in his new sports car while he makes love to Rebecca (Floriane Daniel), a beautiful translator. The car is taken for a joyride by Rene (Ulrich Matthes), a movie projectionist periodically afflicted with amnesia. On an icy road there is a collision with a truck driven by a middle-aged farmer, Theo (Josef Bierbichler). Theo's young daughter, critically injured, lies in a coma, tended by Laura (Marie-Lou Sellem), a nurse who is becoming involved with Rene.</p>
        <p>After the accident, they all get to brooding. '' 'Winter Sleepers' tried to emphasize this stand-still, lost situation which my generation felt,'' Mr. Tykwer said. From there, though, the movie plays with the pieces much as ''Lola'' did. In that film, the same scenario is played through three times, mixing developments in different ways to get the desired result: if not happiness, then some measure of satisfaction in our pretty impossible time.</p>
        <p>If ''Lola'' keeps repeating the story until the heroine and her boyfriend (Moritz Bleibtreu) get it right, ''Winter Sleepers'' throws out happenstance and leaves everybody to make the best of it. ''They are forced to take their lives into their own hands and not accept being victims,'' Mr. Tykwer said. ''Some of them can handle it, some can't.''</p>
        <p>Later on, the fates convene. Like ''Lola,'' this is a strikingly good-looking film, with a score that laments at some points and pounds along ''Lola''-like when need be. Birth, death and revenge take a hand. Next time, take the keys out of the car.</p>
