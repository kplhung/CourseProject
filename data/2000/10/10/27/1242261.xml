        <p>During his decade in power, President Alberto K. Fujimori has been the master of feint, surprise and sleight of hand. But his secret weapon whenever he was in deep trouble was his spy chief, who built up an intimate knowledge of every Peruvian who could cause his boss trouble.</p>
        <p>Now Mr. Fujimori is in a high-stakes chase after that spy chief, Vladimiro Montesinos -- or at least that seems to be happening.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fujimori spent much of today in a police helicopter directing a manhunt against the former aide who is thought to be at large in the suburbs of Lima. All members of the armed forces who are not involved in the operation have been ordered to stay in their barracks, suggesting that Mr. Fujimori does not have full confidence in his army, particularly Mr. Montesinos's brother-in-law, who commands the troops around the capital.</p>
        <p>What Mr. Montesinos may be up to is not quite clear, but ever since the broadcast of a videotape last month showing him paying off a newly elected opposition legislator to switch parties, Peru has been in a state of severe turmoil. Mr. Fujimori was forced to announce that he would step down next July after new elections in which he would not be a candidate, and Mr. Montesinos quickly fled to Panama.</p>
        <p>But the former spy chief rushed back to Peru in a private jet on Monday, after it became clear that he could not be assured of a tranquil asylum in Panama. Now every Peruvian policeman is supposedly looking for the man who just a few weeks ago led their efforts against terrorism and drug trafficking.</p>
        <p>There was an element of theater to the search that left many people wondering what was really going on.</p>
        <p>''Fujimori and Montesinos would like the world to think there is a rupture,'' said Francisco Loayza, a former intelligence agent who wrote a biography of Mr. Montesinos. ''I hope I am wrong, but I think this is really a coordinated farce.''</p>
        <p>The operation began Wednesday afternoon with as much secrecy as a fireworks display. Mr. Fujimori donned a black leather jacket and combat boots and dashed out of the presidential palace, moving so fast that he lost his security contingent, though not a bevy of television cameramen and newspaper photographers covering the events.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fujimori was shown on national television barking orders and even directing traffic, as he made his way to a military club in the suburb of Chaclacayo where he took command of the operation.</p>
        <p>Buses full of rush-hour commuters screamed out ''Chino, Chino, Chino'' -- Mr. Fujimori's nickname -- as they passed the motorcade. And Mr. Fujimori found time to wave and smile as if he were on the campaign stump.</p>
        <p>Peruvian television reported a couple of hours later that Mr. Montesinos had been captured, news that opposition leaders celebrated.</p>
        <p>That line changed later in the evening when Mr. Fujimori told reporters that his forces had searched five locations, but that Mr. Montesinos had slipped away. Oddly, Mr. Fujimori said his forces were not trying to arrest Mr. Montesinos but merely to locate him to ''assure the tranquility of the country.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fujimori then took time off to visit his mother.</p>
        <p>When he returned to Chaclacayo today, he came with his butler, cook and his eldest daughter, Keiko Sofia, leaving the impression that he was preparing for a long stay.</p>
        <p>Little is known about the exact relationship between Mr. Fujimori and Mr. Montesinos, who came to know each other during the 1990 election campaign when the spy leaked government polls and other intelligence to the upstart candidate. Mr. Montesinos fixed a tax problem for Mr. Fujimori that was emerging as a campaign issue, and later he took care of his divorce and the government's relations with the Central Intelligence Agency.</p>
        <p>While the two have long been at the pinnacle of power, both come from outside the usual political establishment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fujimori is the son of Japanese immigrants. Mr. Montesinos comes from a family of Marxist labor activists, and his first name was chosen in honor of Lenin. Mr. Fujimori is an agricultural engineer by training. A former army captain, Mr. Montesinos became the lawyer for drug dealers after he was cashiered by the military and spent a year in jail for espionage.</p>
        <p>Much else is a matter of speculation, but there can be little doubt that Mr. Montesinos knows much about Mr. Fujimori's 10 years in power that the president would probably like to remain secret. Mr. Loayza, the former intelligence agent, who introduced the two, claims that Mr. Montesinos doctored immigration papers to hide the fact that Mr. Fujimori was born in Japan, rather than Peru, making his presidency illegal.</p>
        <p>The extraordinary events of the last 24 hours have left many in the opposition wondering whether Mr. Fujimori and Mr. Montesinos were not cooking up some kind of trick -- maybe to strengthen the former spy chief's claim for political asylum in Venezuela or Morocco.</p>
        <p>After all, opposition leaders pointed out, Mr. Montesinos returned to Peru after a month in exile with the explicit permission of the president,  and he was given protection at an air force base in the coastal city of Pisco.</p>
        <p>Alejandro Toledo, the former presidential candidate who dropped out of the race last May charging election fraud, expressed skepticism to reporters. ''As a head of state, what is he doing leading a police operation?'' he asked. ''This is an insult to all Peruvians.''</p>
        <p>Senior Clinton administration officials said today they believed that Mr. Fujimori was serious about capturing Mr. Montesinos as part of an effort to fortify his control over the chaotic state of Peruvian politics. ''I think he is trying to consolidate his support with the military,'' said one official.</p>
        <p>Those who take Mr. Fujimori at his word point out that opposition and government negotiators made a breakthrough late Wednesday in negotiations to set presidential elections for April 8, after which Mr. Fujimori will step down on July 28. The government dropped a condition that the opposition first had to go along with a sweeping amnesty for the security forces, one that would have covered Mr. Montesinos.</p>
        <p>If President Fujimori's manhunt for Mr. Montesinos is all theatrics, he has gone to great lengths to appear vulnerable and threatened.</p>
        <p>Since Mr. Montesinos's return, Mr. Fujimori has traveled around military installations as if he were rallying his forces, slept in his intelligence agency's offices for security, and kept his top commanders under his bodyguards' watch as a guarantee against any possible coups. The president's six personal bodyguards kept their guns out of their holsters as if an assassination attempt might be imminent.</p>
        <p>Several Montesinos aides were arrested, but were later released.</p>
        <p>''I am sure when President Fujimori clarifies his relationship with Mr. Montesinos,'' opposition Congressman Fernando Olivera said today, ''everything else will fall into place.''</p>
