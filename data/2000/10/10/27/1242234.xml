        <p>After a national search for its next president, Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts is poised to name one of its own, Gordon J. Davis, the chairman of Jazz at Lincoln Center and a former New York City parks commissioner, to lead the organization through the nation's biggest arts rebuilding project.</p>
        <p>Beverly Sills, the chairwoman of Lincoln Center, confirmed that yesterday a search committee had chosen Mr. Davis, 59, a real estate lawyer and former city official in administrations dating back to Mayor John V.

        <p>After a national search for its next president, Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts is poised to name one of its own, Gordon J. Davis, the chairman of Jazz at Lincoln Center and a former New York City parks commissioner, to lead the organization through the nation's biggest arts rebuilding project.</p>
        <p>Beverly Sills, the chairwoman of Lincoln Center, confirmed that yesterday a search committee had chosen Mr. Davis, 59, a real estate lawyer and former city official in administrations dating back to Mayor John V. Lindsay, to succeed Nathan Leventhal, who announced in March that he would step down in December after 17 years.</p>
        <p>A special meeting of the Lincoln Center board was called for today at 9 a.m. to vote on the panel's recommendation and, Ms. Sills said in a telephone interview, ''we're very optimistic the board will share our enthusiasm.'' She spoke after The New York Times had learned about the search committee's choice.</p>
        <p>In an interview, Mr. Davis expressed his clear excitement for the position, which  would put him in charge of what may be a decade-long, $1.5 billion reconstruction of the deteriorating 1960's arts campus between Columbus and Amsterdam Avenues and 62nd and 66th Streets.</p>
        <p>''Lincoln Center has been so much a part of my life and body and soul for so long that this is literally like a dream come true,'' Mr. Davis said by telephone. ''I cannot tell you how deeply moving this possibility is.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Davis said that at 6 feet 5 inches, he was ''not only the first black parks commissioner, but the tallest and youngest.'' He served in that post under Mayor Edward I. Koch from 1978 until 1983.</p>
        <p>Mr. Davis volunteered that he did not see yesterday's selection as any breakthrough for African-Americans, who, he said, were already scoring major achievements in culture, scholarship and business. ''It's not about the person at the top but at the bottom,'' he said. ''It's about how to make Lincoln Center relevant to the lives of those less fortunate.'' But he said it was premature to discuss any specific plans he might have until his selection was voted on.</p>
        <p>If named to the $525,000-a-year job, Mr. Davis would, on Jan. 1, take over the day-to-day operation of the world's largest performing arts organization, an umbrella group governing the common real estate and interests of 13 constituent arts organizations, including many of the country's premier institutions. Among them are the Metropolitan Opera, the New York Philharmonic, the New York City Ballet, the New York City Opera, the Juilliard School, the Film Society of Lincoln Center, and Jazz at Lincoln Center, whose board Mr. Davis runs. In addition to those organizations, Lincoln Center itself, with an annual budget of $70 million, has become a growing presenter of its own arts programs, sometimes to the discomfort of the other constituents.</p>
        <p>The scope of the huge refurbishment of the campus remains to be worked out. A confidential survey last December, a copy of which was shown to The New York Times, cited a host of needs, including wholesale repair of the pitted 18-acre grounds, rooftop additions for Avery Fisher Hall and Juilliard, an expanded lobby for the Met, a visitors center, and a new administration building in Damrosch Park. The capital projects added up to $1.49 billion, a larger sum in adjusted dollars than the original cost of Lincoln Center, and while some items were originally dismissed as little more than a wish list, Ms. Sills, who is raising money for the project, now says that the project list and dollar figure seem more realistic by the day.</p>
        <p>In July, Lincoln Center hired Rebecca Robertson, a former Shubert Organization vice president and city planner who led the redevelopment of West 42nd Street, as its manager of reconstruction. Mr. Davis will not only have to guide the renovation project, but also find alternate performance spaces while Avery Fisher Hall, the New York State Theater and perhaps other halls are torn apart.</p>
        <p>Mr. Davis would be Lincoln Center's seventh president, following figures like the center's founder, John D. Rockefeller 3d, and Gen. Maxwell Taylor, who left to become military adviser to President John F. Kennedy. The appointment would mark his return to public life after a 17-year hiatus in law practice, most recently at the Manhattan firm of LeBoeuf, Lamb, Greene &amp; MacRae.</p>
        <p>He has long kept an active hand in Lincoln Center, serving as a member of the board since 1983, and in 1989 becoming the founding chairman of what is now Jazz at Lincoln Center;  its artistic director is Wynton Marsalis. Mr. Davis said yesterday that while he did not know who might follow him there, ''I'm not leaving Wynton'' and would continue to work closely with the group.</p>
        <p>Mr. Davis's last fulltime job in city government was as parks commissioner. As the lord of the city's 25,000 acres of parkland, 900 playgrounds, 104 swimming pools, seven ice skating rinks and six beaches, he cast a large shadow, and not just because of his height. Whether creating a new corps of park rangers in snappy green uniforms or cradling a new sea lion at the zoo, rousting a hive of bees or cleaning up after a storm, Mr. Davis's magnetism attracted television cameras and put a can-do face on City Hall at a time of near municipal bankruptcy, budget cuts and headline-grabbing crime.</p>
        <p>Mayor Koch called him ''one of my stars'' and even setbacks like the long, bungled repair of Wollman Memorial Rink in Central Park did not seem to tarnish his appeal for long. Rather, at a time when the parks were trampled bare and vandalized, Mr. Davis and the privately financed Central Park Conservancy, run by Elizabeth Barlow (now Elizabeth Barlow Rogers), were widely credited with halting the decay, and restoring at least some of the city's most prized emerald belts.</p>
        <p>Mayor Koch had plucked him for the parks job from his post as a city planning commissioner, where he worked closely with Mr. Leventhal at City Hall. Both men began in city government under Mayor Lindsay, Mr. Davis as assistant to the budget director in 1967 when he was 26. Mr. Leventhal left for the Lincoln Center presidency in 1983.</p>
        <p>Mr. Davis was born on the South Side of Chicago in 1941 and said he was greatly influenced by his father, W. Allison Davis, the John Dewey Distinguished Professor of Education at the University of Chicago, who became, in 1947, the first African-American to be granted tenure at a non-historically black institution. The younger Mr. Davis attended  Williams College, where he earned his B.A. and played basketball; Columbia University, where he did graduate work in government and met his wife-to-be, Peggy Cooper, in a neighborhood Chock Full o' Nuts;  and Harvard University Law School, where he obtained his law degree.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Davis, also a lawyer and a retired Family Court judge, is now the John S. R. Shad Professor of Lawering and Ethics at New York University School of Law.</p>
        <p>Their daughter, Elizabeth, 25, a graduate of Brown University, is an actor. As Mr. Davis was learning of his selection for the Lincoln Center presidency, she called to say she had just been offered a good part -- in Arizona.</p>
