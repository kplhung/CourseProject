        <p>Shaken by two failed Mars missions last year, NASA spent most of this year trying to restore morale, reform management and formulate a new strategy for exploring the planet over the next 15 years, culminating in flights to bring back soil and rock samples from Mars.</p>
        <p>The space agency yesterday announced the results, a revised program for Mars exploration that officials characterized as more flexible, responsive and resilient than previous approaches. The plan includes six flights over the next seven years but stretches out the timetable for later flights to incorporate new technologies, more detailed investigation of the planet and possible joint ventures with France and Italy.</p>

        <p>Shaken by two failed Mars missions last year, NASA spent most of this year trying to restore morale, reform management and formulate a new strategy for exploring the planet over the next 15 years, culminating in flights to bring back soil and rock samples from Mars.</p>
        <p>The space agency yesterday announced the results, a revised program for Mars exploration that officials characterized as more flexible, responsive and resilient than previous approaches. The plan includes six flights over the next seven years but stretches out the timetable for later flights to incorporate new technologies, more detailed investigation of the planet and possible joint ventures with France and Italy.</p>
        <p>At a news conference in Washington, Dr. Edward J. Weiler, NASA's associate administrator for space science, emphasized that this was ''a science-driven, not a mission-driven'' program, meaning that to a large extent, its pace and direction would be decided by what is learned about the diverse and surprising planet as the flights unfold.</p>
        <p>''It's a program, not just a collection of missions,'' said Scott Hubbard, the Mars program director.</p>
        <p>The officials indicated that the slower-paced program could be carried out more comfortably, given engineering challenges and limited budgets. They estimated costs of as much as $450 million annually over the next five years, amounts that fall within budgets projected for NASA in that period. The sample-return mission alone could cost $2 billion.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hubbard said that a more thorough examination of cost estimates and engineering concepts would be made over the next 18 months. This will be crucial, he said, in deciding ''exactly what to do in the period beyond 2007.''</p>
        <p>Favorable opportunities for flights to Mars occur every 26 months, when it requires less rocket power and time for a spacecraft to reach the planet. The last two spacecraft, which arrived at Mars in 1999, failed at the last moments.</p>
        <p>The new schedule represents no change for the most immediate missions. The Mars Odyssey Orbiter, with remote sensors for studying the surface mineralogy in closer detail, is to be launched next spring.</p>
        <p>In 2003, NASA is to send two small roving vehicles to the planet, with the landings in January 2004. Their primary objective will be to investigate surface geology and likely sources of water beneath the surface.</p>
        <p>Other missions on the drawing board include these:</p>
        <p>*In 2005, a Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, modeled on the successful Mars Global Surveyor, still orbiting and mapping the planet.</p>
        <p>*In 2007, a ''smart'' landing craft outfitted with a precision guidance and navigation system and hazard-avoidance systems for improving the chances of landing in the right place and in one piece. In the same year, NASA plans to launch the first Scout mission, a low-budget scientific craft that could, for example, deploy instrument-bearing balloons or a small airplane.</p>
        <p>*In 2009, NASA may team up with the Italian Space Agency to use ground-penetrating radar for prospecting for water from orbit.</p>
        <p>NASA officials are also discussing with the Italian agency the possibility of a joint mission in 2007 to place a satellite in orbit around Mars, to relay the increasingly heavy communications load from spacecraft there. Earlier this week, France's Research Ministry signed a ''statement of intent'' with NASA to collaborate on small landers.</p>
        <p>The flights are being planned to search for the most likely places where water may exist or have been present in the past, places, that is, where life may have emerged.</p>
        <p>The plan is to launch the sample-return mission as early as 2011, but more likely in 2014.</p>
        <p>NASA emphasized that there were no plans for manned missions.</p>
