        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Linda R. Monk's concern that the Census Bureau will not be able to keep its data private, but will be forced to turn it over to Congress or government bureaus (Op-Ed, Oct. 23), is really irrelevant.</p>
        <p>Credit and medical bureaus collect hundreds of times more information on us than any Census Bureau form ever has. There are estimates that half these files contain inaccuracies. What is to stop the Internal Revenue Service or other government agency from going to a credit or medical bureau? Not much, although a court order might be necessary.</p>

        <p>Every time an American logs onto a Web site, data are being tracked and filed for marketers. If we really care about privacy, we will stop worrying about some quickie form containing information we have already given to the government and worry more about the threat to privacy from big business, credit bureaus and related interests.</p>
