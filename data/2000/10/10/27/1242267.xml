        <p>The U.S. ambassador to China, Joseph Prueher, was answering questions the other day after a lecture at Nanjing University, when an American student rose and asked him something like this: Why is it that whenever I'm back home Americans ask me what it's like to live in a Communist dictatorship that abuses its people, but when I'm here in China I feel that I'm living in a society that's becoming more open?</p>
        <p>The young man's question reflected an important truth. While views of China in America -- and particularly in Congress -- still remain frozen in many cases on the Tiananmen Square massacre, the reality here is now a much more complex combination of iron fists and Web servers, personal freedoms and political handcuffs. Here are the five biggest myths about today's China that the next U.S. president should know:</p>
        <p>Myth #1: The main threat to the Chinese regime is a resurgence of the coalition of pro-democracy students and intellectuals who led the Tiananmen movement. Wrong. The fact is, the students have been among the biggest beneficiaries of the stability and foreign investment in China in the past decade, and they are unlikely to rock the boat. The big challenge to the regime is the workers and farmers who will be laid off as a result of China's pending entry into the World Trade Organization. Many uncompetitive factories will be shut down and 10 million farmers alone could lose their jobs as superior U.S. sugar and wheat start flooding China. Unrest among this group is the biggest threat to the regime.</p>
        <p>Myth #2: The Internet will promote democracy in China. Wrong. Talk to Chinese dissident groups and they will tell you they can now send one million e-mails of uncensored information into China every day. That's true. But what can the recipients do with those e-mails? ''If you just have information, but can't use it for organization or action to promote change, its political impact will be limited, and for now the Chinese government is still very good at preventing people from turning information into political action,'' said Michael Chase, who with his colleague James Mulvenon has been researching the Internet in China for the RAND Corporation.</p>
        <p>Myth #3: The Internet will not promote democracy in China. Also wrong. Yes, it's true that the Chinese government has tried to block access, but it's not working. Come with me here in Nanjing and I will show you how to view online Tibet.com -- the official Web site of the Tibetan government in exile -- or NYTimes.com. No problem. Deep down, the leadership here knows that you can't have the knowledge that China needs from the Internet without letting all sorts of other information into the country, and without empowering more and more Chinese to communicate horizontally and create political communities. In the long run this will only give more tools to the forces here pushing for political pluralism.</p>
        <p>Myth #4: Every Chinese youth is building a replica of the Statue of Liberty in his basement. If only that were true. The most popular political attitude among students in China is nationalism, with an underlying sense that America is trying to keep China down. As one Nanjing professor said to me, ''I had a student tell me the other day that in 1989 he was in Tiananmen Square as a young boy and in 1999 he was outside the U.S. Embassy throwing stones after the Americans bombed the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade.'' A lot of people assume the next generation of Chinese will be more liberal and pro-American. In fact, a more democratic China that truly reflects public opinion will be a more nationalistic China.</p>
        <p>Myth #5: The natural successor to China's Communist system is Jeffersonian democracy. I wish. The most likely thing to come after the Communist Party is a mess -- unless the Communists can slowly introduce the rule of law and necessary governing institutions for a more open society. We may think the problem in China today is too much control, but in most cases it's too little control. Half the time the central government either has no idea what's going on in a province or is unable to get provincial leaders to apply laws. (Get ready for the fracas that is going to break out between the U.S. and China when every Chinese province tries to interpret W.T.O. rules on its own.) In the cold war it was China's strength that threatened us; tomorrow it will be China's weakness.</p>
