        <p>We need theater that joins history to ritual, and not because ritual should transcend history, but because ritual can transform it. You can witness this transformation if you are lucky enough to see Ratan Thiyam's Chorus Repertory Theater of Manipur, India, performing Mr. Thiyam's ''Uttar-Priyadarshi'' (''The Final Beatitude'') at the Brooklyn Academy of Music through tomorrow. The history is ancient, set in the second century B.C. and based on the life of Ashoka, the third in a line of cruel, brilliant warriors who had conquered much of northern India. The history is modern, too, lived out with patriotic gore in every part of today's world. A ruler (an emperor then, a president or general now) must choose between tyranny at home and abroad and the kind of justice and compassion that is based on liberation.</p>
        <p>The real Ashoka experienced this transformation. This play -- just 80 minutes, and a spectacle really, a spare but glorious assemblage of movement, speech, music, light and color -- shows how and why.</p>

        <p>We need theater that joins history to ritual, and not because ritual should transcend history, but because ritual can transform it. You can witness this transformation if you are lucky enough to see Ratan Thiyam's Chorus Repertory Theater of Manipur, India, performing Mr. Thiyam's ''Uttar-Priyadarshi'' (''The Final Beatitude'') at the Brooklyn Academy of Music through tomorrow. The history is ancient, set in the second century B.C. and based on the life of Ashoka, the third in a line of cruel, brilliant warriors who had conquered much of northern India. The history is modern, too, lived out with patriotic gore in every part of today's world. A ruler (an emperor then, a president or general now) must choose between tyranny at home and abroad and the kind of justice and compassion that is based on liberation.</p>
        <p>The real Ashoka experienced this transformation. This play -- just 80 minutes, and a spectacle really, a spare but glorious assemblage of movement, speech, music, light and color -- shows how and why.</p>
        <p>Buddhism was on the rise in India, and it changed Ashoka. ''Uttar-Priyadarshi'' begins with the sound of a horn. Four monks stand before the audience in orange robes. Nothing compels more than stillness.</p>
        <p>When they start to chant, more chorus members slowly move onstage carrying poles with bronze-gold disks. The excellent program notes explain that these disks bear the symbols of Buddha's Eightfold Path. But even if you are uninformed, you will be struck -- and held -- by the purity of this stage vision. You will believe utterly what these performers express with their potent voices and their agile, fiercely trained bodies: the peace that passeth all understanding; the hatred that does the same; the everyday sight of grief, pride and fear.</p>
        <p>The walls of the stage are black, and there is a low platform at the back. Ashoka is first seen on this platform, fresh from battle, flanked by his army and seated in triumph on an elephant (a huge puppet). They are still, too, and in darkness except for the blue light that strikes the jeweled cloth worn by the men and their animals. Here is the gleam and the shimmer of evil.</p>
        <p>Six more scenes tell the story of how this emperor, ridiculed by monks and haunted by the cries of war widows, drives dissenters into a hell of his own invention, only to enter it himself in the end, to free himself from the monster he has set loose. Ghor, the monster, is part of Ashoka and, once acknowledged, can be defeated. The two embrace, join hands, turn around together; then Ghor spins away and disappears.</p>
        <p>There is not a bit of religious piety here. Mr. Thiyam is giving us a parable about war and peace, about the power that corrupts absolutely, and the struggle against evil, within as well as around us. And he is from Manipur, an old kingdom next to Burma that was first conquered by the British, kept as a semi-autonomous kingdom, then merged with an independent India. Insurgent groups are now fighting for independence, the government maintains martial law and ethnic conflicts abound.</p>
        <p>In the hell onstage, torture instruments are painted white and wheeled out like playroom toys; they include the hangman's noose and the electric chair. Ghor's attendants, all in black with long white hair like fine straw, exchange greedy cries like people seen in photos and on television, turning electrocutions and army slaughters into spectator sports.</p>
        <p>The Chorus Repertory Theater has 23 members, and they use small groups to create worlds. There is a male chorus of eight and a female chorus of seven. When the war-proud Ashoka meets the war widows, we hear their high, awful cries when they move across the stage, some crawling, some carrying banners that spread across the floor, turning into a river of blood. Then, the women gone, the ghosts of Ashoka's enemies advance and wrap him in the red cloth. It is a whirlpool of blood.</p>
        <p>When Ghor, the chosen Destroyer and master of hell, comes forth, he is held on a rope by two men, howling and whining his fury. One scene later, ruling hell, he stamps and twirls in purple, pink and black, his chest bare, calling and rasping out his delight in conquest. (There are subtitles, and though I wished for more during speeches, Mr. Thiyam is right to say that his work can be understood without an exact translation.)</p>
        <p>The voices are amazing: this is carefully pitched, highly rhetorical speech. The actors chant, orate and sing like old Shakespeareans, with multiple rhythm changes and a range from high soprano to bass.</p>
        <p>The movement, too, is hieratic, and gorgeously rhetorical. You might know certain gestures and stances from Indian art or dance: the turned-out legs and feet that form one vertical triangle; the arms that form another, moving between vertical and horizontal; the hands with their snakelike ease. But again, there is no one technique or style -- these actor-dancers crouch, crawl, contort, or move with smooth, legato steps. Their limbs can do anything and their backs are strong enough to have been carved from obsidian.</p>
        <p>Mr. Thiyam has studied Eastern and Western forms, but there is no sense of pastiche here, only of integration and invention. He also wrote the music: his drums, gongs, bells and wind instruments enfold the work; they anticipate, underscore and embody the actions and emotions.</p>
        <p>I would call this composer-writer-director-choregrapher a genius. And I would call the experience of seeing ''Uttar-Priyadarshi'' transcendant.</p>
