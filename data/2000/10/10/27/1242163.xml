        <p>''Once in the Life'' begins with a flurry of fast cuts and quick, pungent scenes that effectively introduce its characters and milieu.

        <p>In rapid succession, we meet Manny Rivera (Paul Calderon), a stickball-playing drug dealer; his nervous, fulsome minion Freddie Nine Lives (Dominic Chianese Jr.); and two unlucky half-brothers named Michael Williams, one of them a drug addict who prefers to be called Torch or Billy (Titus Welliver) and the other a small-time hood nicknamed 20/20 Mike (Laurence Fishburne), who is ambiguously mixed up with Manny and his crew.</p>

        <p>''Once in the Life'' begins with a flurry of fast cuts and quick, pungent scenes that effectively introduce its characters and milieu. On an as yet ungentrified Lower Manhattan street, a skinny fellow, dapper in black leather, does a solo break dance next to a sleek sedan, as the orange, graffiti-style credits pop onto the screen.</p>
        <p>In rapid succession, we meet Manny Rivera (Paul Calderon), a stickball-playing drug dealer; his nervous, fulsome minion Freddie Nine Lives (Dominic Chianese Jr.); and two unlucky half-brothers named Michael Williams, one of them a drug addict who prefers to be called Torch or Billy (Titus Welliver) and the other a small-time hood nicknamed 20/20 Mike (Laurence Fishburne), who is ambiguously mixed up with Manny and his crew.</p>
        <p>Also mixed up with them is Tony (Eamonn Walker), who is trying to balance his responsibilities as a husband and father with his duties to ''the life'' -- the web of criminal enterprise and blood loyalty from which guys in movies like this one are always struggling to escape. Just as Torch and Mike are bound by ties of blood, Mike and Tony are connected by childhood friendship and a youthful stretch of prison time they served together. Eventually these conflicting loyalties will force the movie to its dramatic crisis.</p>
        <p>''Once in the Life,'' written and directed by Mr. Fishburne, is adapted from his play ''Riff Raff,'' which was performed at the Circle Repertory and also in Los Angeles a few years ago. While the opening scenes have the pace and visual variety of a movie (albeit a somewhat familiar one), the film quickly comes to feel wordy and stagebound.</p>
        <p>Most of the action takes place among the three main characters on a single set -- a cluttered, candlelit hideout in an abandoned building that looks, despite some very real rats, like an Off-Broadway stage. The occasional flashbacks to Tony and Mike's prison cell, and periodic visits to ancillary characters -- Tony's wife, Maxine (Annabella Sciorra); the hapless Freddie; and Manny's mismatched goons (Gregory Hines and Tiger Chen) -- don't do much to open up the picture, which feels uneasily caught between its themes and its story. Even though the plot involves a lot of double-crossing and a few surprise revelations, Mr. Fishburne seems less interested in generating suspense than in creating a mood. But without a coherent story to hold our attention, the mood of somber, lower-depths desperation soon becomes monotonous.</p>
        <p>The film's central triangle is set in place once Tony -- dispatched by Manny to kill the two Mikes, who have stolen some of his heroin -- arrives at his quarry's hideout. The shifting allegiances between the men might have been more vivid onstage, but here the situation just feels static. As if to compensate for the narrative thinness, Mr. Fishburne overuses Branford Marsalis's haunting score, and further crowds the soundtrack with long passages of the poetry Tony used to improvise in jail. Compelling as this may have been as a theatrical device (and lovely as some of the poetry is), Tony's recitation destroys the movie's momentum and compromises its realism.</p>
        <p>Mike's relationship with his half-brother (who hates to be called ''bro'') starts out antagonistic and by the end turns tender, but we never see in psychological terms how this transformation takes place. Nor do we see the depth of Mike and Tony's friendship conveyed in any chemistry between the actors, though both of them deliver lines that testify to it.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fishburne is an uncommonly insighful performer, capable of bringing a sense of emotional complication to every role he plays. His performance here, witty and profane, vulnerable and strutting, nearly holds the movie together. But Mr. Walker, who glowers and grimaces, and Mr. Welliver, who ping-pongs between slackness and rage, can't keep up with him, and unfortunately, neither can his movie.</p>
        <p>''Once in the Life'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has a great deal of profanity and a few scenes of violence.</p>
