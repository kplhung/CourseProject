        <p>A selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy pop and jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert.</p>
        <p>DAVE ALVIN, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side; Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 798-0406. ''Public Domain,'' the latest Dave Alvin album on Hightone Records, is a historical journey in the service of self-exploration. Mr. Alvin's territory is the wide plain of American folk and blues music as he applies his cowboy drawl to familiarities like ''Shenandoah'' and obscurities like ''Sign of Judgment'' by the spiritualist Kid Prince Moore. Mr. Alvin will probably focus on these treasures tonight, although he may throw in a few of his own from the Blasters and his solo catalog. Walter Salas-Humara, another outstanding cultivator of American roots rock, opens the Mercury Lounge show tonight at 8; the Tarbox Ramblers open at Maxwell's tomorrow night at 10. Admission for each is $12 (Ann Powers).</p>

        <p>A selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy pop and jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert.</p>
        <p>DAVE ALVIN, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side; Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 798-0406.

Admission for each is $12 (Ann Powers).</p>
        <p>* AT THE DRIVE-IN, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700. Onstage, this emo-punk band from El Paso works for its money: the musicians leap and kick and seem as if they're going to have 10 tantrums at once. They're capable of some pretty good rock songwriting, too, mixing up bits of Wire and the MC5 and Fugazi. It's sort of an agitprop act without using any of the actual vocabulary of politics. I'm not sure what it's all about, but it sure looks as if they're raging against something, probably a machine of some sort. Tomorrow at 8:30 p.m., with Murder City Devils and Bluetip opening; tickets are $12 (Ben Ratliff).</p>
        <p>STEVEN BERNSTEIN'S MILLENNIAL TERRITORY ORCHESTRA, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501. Mr. Bernstein, the wily slide trumpeter, is one of jazz's mad historians, and in this band, which includes a banjo as well as a horn section, you're likely to hear echoes of jazz from the 1920's to the present; Mr. Bernstein will provide the subversive historical links. Tonight at midnight; admission is $7 (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>MIGUEL BOSE, ANA TORROJA, Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, Manhattan, (212) 496-7070. Two of Spain's leading pop singers. Miguel Bose sounds like Spain's answer to Bryan Ferry, professing romance in a suavely vulnerable baritone. Ana Torroja, who has recorded with Mr. Bose and with the ethno-ambient group Deep Forest, has a light, breathy voice that whispers her own promises. Tonight at 8; tickets are $45 to $60 (Jon Pareles).</p>
        <p>BULGARI, Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400 or (212) 545-7536.  Bulgarian music bridges Europe and Asia Minor, with angelic melodies, pungent dissonances and speedy odd-metered dance tunes. Bulgari brings together leading soloists from Bulgaria's national ensembles, with singers from Thrace and musicians playing gaida (bagpipes), kaval (flute), tambura (steel-stringed lute) and tapan (two-headed drum); it also has four leaping, twirling dancers. Tonight at 8; tickets are $21, $15 for students (Pareles).</p>
        <p>CHURCH OF BETTY, BAMcafe, Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4139. Chris Rael, who leads Church of Betty, is determined to mesh East and West. Collaborating with downtown New York musicians who will take on anything, he mixes pop and ragas from India with funk, rock and hip-hop, coming up with a hybrid that radiates benign optimism. Tonight at 9; admission is $10 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>* COMMON, JILL SCOTT, Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212) 564-4882. Common has set out to be one of hip-hop's good guys: staying clear of gangsta rap, professing self-reliance and respect for women. He likes to work with a live band that backs him with smooth jazz vamps and light funk. Jill Scott pours out words, spoken and sung with jazzy timing, to detail the aspirations and loves of a sensual, intelligent and self-assured woman. Sunday at 8 p.m.; tickets are $25 in advance, $27 at the door (Pareles).</p>
        <p>* MARK DRESSER, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006. This bassist has been one of the finest musicians in jazz's experimental circles since the 1970's, with strong tone and rhythm, and as a composer, he pushes himself. For his weekend residency here, he is presenting two bands. Tonight it's two sets of his Moisture project, with the saxophonist Tony Malaby, the violinist Mat Maneri and the drummer Kevin Norton. Tomorrow and Sunday, he'll play with Moisture for the first set; the second will be House of Mirrors, his collaboration with the trumpeter Edwin Harkins. Sets through Sunday at 8 and 9:30 p.m.; admission is $10, with a one-drink minimum (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>ELIANE ELIAS, Iridium, 44 West 63rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 582-2121. Ms. Elias, the Brazilian pianist who fuses the main line of postwar jazz with Latin American rhythms and song form, has been one of the more interesting creolists in the New York scene. Sets are tonight through Sunday night at 8:30 and 10:30; tonight and tomorrow there is an additional set at midnight; cover charge is $25; $10 minimum (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>JOE ELY, SLAID CLEAVES, Bottom Line, 15 West Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 228-6300. Joe Ely's songs encompass a West Texas of cowboys and cockfights, honkytonks and wide open spaces, country and rockabilly and rhythm and blues. Since the 1970's, he has been a mainstay of Texas songwriting that merges the down-home and the mythic. Slaid Cleaves, sharing the bill, writes thoughtful songs about characters with pawn-shop wedding rings and cars that burn oil, trying to pull out of downward spirals. Tomorrow at 7:30 and 10:30 p.m.; admission is $20 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>* SHERMAN IRBY QUARTET, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 255-4037. The first musician out of the Smalls scene to be signed to a major label (his two Blue Note albums have had some pleasurable moments), Mr. Irby is a sweet-toned alto saxophonist whose style is as recognizably Southern as a twanging accent. Sets through Sunday night are at 9:30 and 11:30, with a 1 a.m. set tomorrow night; $15 cover Sunday; $20 for tonight and tomorrow; $10 minimum (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>LITTLE FEAT, B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144. Little Feat brought California surrealism to a deep affection for the American South; it came up with grooves that brought together blues-rock, country, New Orleans funk, gospel and Southern rock. After its guiding spirit, Lowell George, died in 1979, it broke up for nearly a decade, then reunited to revive its inimitable romping, strutting grooves. Tonight at 8 and 10:30; admission is $35 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>MIGHTY MIGHTY BOSSTONES, Roseland, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-1224. To kick off the mini-tour that includes this date, America's favorite ska band played to 50,000 fans at an outdoor show in its home town, Boston. It must have been quite entertaining to watch Dicky Barrett, the band's front ham, bask in the attention of that crowd. No matter what size the throng, though, Mr. Barrett and the band always reel it in with wild beats and good shtick. Tomorrow at 7:30 p.m.; tickets are $17.50 in advance; $20 the  day of show (Powers).</p>
        <p>MOONLIGHTERS, MARY LEE'S CORVETTE, BARBARA BROUSAL, C-Note, 157 Avenue C, at 10th Street, West Village, (212) 677-8142. Check out some fine local talent on this female-powered triple bill. The Moonlighters are an old-timey acoustic group with a lot of charm. Mary Lee's Corvette features the sultry Mary Lee Cortes on vocals. Barbara Brousal is an emerging talent with a limber sense of melody. Tonight at 8; admission is $5 (Powers).</p>
        <p>MAKOTO OZONE TRIO, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232. A fluid, versatile Japanese mainstream-jazz pianist who was a regular part of Gary Burton's bands in the 1980's, Mr. Ozone works here intermittently with the bassist James Genus and the drummer Clarence Penn -- two other good reasons to go hear live jazz. Sets today and tomorrow are at 8 and 10:30 p.m. and midnight; cover charge is $25. Sunday sets are at 7 and 9 p.m., with a $18 cover charge; $10 minimum all nights (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>OZRIC TENTACLES, Wetlands, 161 Hudson Street, at Laight Street, TriBeCa, (212) 386-3600. England has jam bands, too, and Ozric Tentacles may be the most well-traveled one of them. Its songs start with the suitelike complexities of progressive rock and take off from there. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8; admission is $20 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>* WILSON PICKETT, B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42d Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144. One of the great Southern soul singers of the 1960's, Wilson Pickett still has the power and bluesy grit to stoke songs like ''Midnight Hour'' and ''Mustang Sally.'' Sunday at 8 and 10:30 p.m.; $37.50 for table seats, $25 for bar and standing room (Pareles).</p>
        <p>* OMARA PORTUONDO, BARBARITO TORRES, New Jersey Performing Arts Center, 1 Center Street, Newark, (888) 466-5722, and Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street,  (212) 496-7070. The Buena Vista Social Club brought classic Cuban son back to the world's attention as an alliance of extraordinary musicians; now, those musicians are headlining on their own. Omara Portuondo is a torchy singer who imbues her songs with an aura of bygone romance. Barbarito Torres is a virtuoso of the laud, a Cuban lute; his group plays courtly, old-fashioned Cuban sones, while his solos are jagged, syncopated bursts of modern angularity. Tonight at 8 at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center; tickets are $14 to $48. Tomorrow at 8 p.m. at the Beacon Theater; tickets are $38 to $48 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>FARID AYAZ QAWWAL AND BROTHERS, Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street,  (212) 864-5400 or (212) 545-7536. The Sufi devotional songs called qawwali take the direct route to ecstasy: steady, driving rhythms, incantatory melodies and fervent call-and-response improvisations that rise to peak after peak. Farid Ayaz Qawwal and his nine-member group sing both driving modern qawwali and an older, more introspective classical style. Tomorrow at 8 p.m.; tickets are $25 and $30, $15 for students (Pareles).</p>
        <p>SALSA DE LOS 80, Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741. The 1980's generation of salsa singers had pan-Caribbean and pan-American ambitions, and they broadened Afro-Cuban salsa with regional styles, international pop elements and sometimes lessons in history and culture. This concert brings together a dozen of them, including Joe Arroyo, Luis Enrique, Jose Alberto (El Canario), Tito Nieves, Eddie Santiago and Nino Segarra. Tomorrow at 8 p.m.; tickets are $75 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>SASHA AND JOHN DIGWEED, Twilo, 530 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (212) 268-1600. A longing for rapture and transcendence is never far from the surface of dance music, particularly in the utopian pulsations set out by the English disk jockey team of John Digweed and Sasha. They are leaders in trance music, using steady repetition to hold time at bay and floating, whooshing sounds and voices to suggest freedom from the rigors of form. Doors open tonight at 11, with Sean Cusick warming up. John Digweed and Sasha start at 1 a.m. and continue well past dawn. Admission is $35 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>MARTIN SEXTON, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Union Square, (212) 777-6800. Singing about restlessness and love, plucking and strumming an acoustic guitar, Martin Sexton has an advantage over most folky songwriters: a voice that can groan like an alternative rocker, slide like a soul man or leap up to a pearly falsetto. He's not shy about using it onstage, bouncing it off his guitar parts to sound down-home at one moment, jazzy the next, and his improvisatory daring has earned him a devoted live following. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8; admission is $22 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>* ELLIOTT SMITH, GRANDADDY, Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 496-7070. Steeped in the Beatles, Elliott Smith knows all about how to hide sneakily convoluted harmonies behind seemingly natural melodies. They'd be the stuff of singalongs if Mr. Smith's instincts weren't so antisocial. In his songs, loners cast an impassive but attentive eye on friends, lovers and their own failings; his tunes sound friendly, but he spares no one. Grandaddy takes its time in wayward, countryish songs that wrap stately melodies around reflections around choruses like ''I gotta get outta here and find my way again.'' Sunday at 8 p.m. Tickets are $16; sold out but returns may be available (Pareles).</p>
        <p>TOBIN SPROUT, RICHARD DAVIES, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3055. There's no need to call Tobin Sprout a former member of Guided by Voices anymore. With three fine solo albums of sparkling psychedelic pop under his belt, and a blossoming alternate career as a Photo Realist painter, he gets to just be himself now. Enjoy his gifts at what surely will be a winning show. Sharing the bill is Richard Davies, another fabricator of fine, whimsical, homespun pop. Both appear with full bands. Tonight at 9; admission is $12 (Powers).</p>
        <p>STRING CHEESE INCIDENT, Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212) 564-4882. Constant touring has carried String Cheese Incident up the jam-band circuit. Its music roams happily from bluegrass and country-rock to organ-centered jazz. Tonight at 8; tickets are $22 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>SWEET HONEY IN THE ROCK, Carnegie Hall, (212) 903-9600. The living cultural institution that is Sweet Honey in the Rock brings its joyous, moving a cappella music to Carnegie Hall once a year. The women always have new insights to offer into the African-American musical tradition as it flows into the new millennium. Tonight at 8; tickets are $22 to $42.50 (Powers).</p>
        <p>TOM VARNER QUARTET, Columbia Faculty House, Morningside Drive and 117th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 854-6508. Imagining yourself as a French hornist in jazz is half the battle; after that, original ideas about composition and material must come easily. Mr. Varner has distinguished himself in recent years by shifting around from brainy, Europeanish improv to the purely American repertory of country and gospel. Tonight at 8; admission is free (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>MARK WHITFIELD QUARTET, Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080. If the late-80's boomlet in major-label jazz signings built him up only to knock him down, Mr. Whitfield has always been an excellent guitarist. In the last few years he has been showing up and sitting in at small gigs all over town, bringing back some of the spontaneous excitement of older generations in jazz. Sets are tonight and tomorrow night at 9 and 11; cover charge is $25; $10 minimum (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>ZEN TRICKSTERS, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111. The Zen Tricksters started two decades ago playing Grateful Dead songs. While they now have their own songs to jam on, they haven't forgotten their early repertory; no less a figure than Phil Lesh of the Dead has called on their expertise. Tonight at 9; admission is $14 (Pareles).</p>
