        <p>Directed by Julian P. Hobbs  Not rated; 80 minutes</p>
        <p>As desperate-to-be-noticed documentary filmmakers scour the earth for bizarre new topics to exploit, the line between serious investigation and tabloid trash has become awfully blurry. Take Julian P. Hobbs's rancid little documentary, ''Collectors,'' which opens today at Cinema Village (22 East 12th Street, Greenwich Village). The movie fastens on two self-proclaimed ghouls who solicit, collect and market artworks by serial killers. Watching the movie gives you the unpleasant sense that these collectors, Rick Staton and Tobias Allen, are prancing around and thumbing their noses, gleeful at the publicity and possible income it could generate for their enterprise.</p>

        <p>As desperate-to-be-noticed documentary filmmakers scour the earth for bizarre new topics to exploit, the line between serious investigation and tabloid trash has become awfully blurry. Take Julian P. Hobbs's rancid little documentary, ''Collectors,'' which opens today at Cinema Village (22 East 12th Street, Greenwich Village). The movie fastens on two self-proclaimed ghouls who solicit, collect and market artworks by serial killers. Watching the movie gives you the unpleasant sense that these collectors, Rick Staton and Tobias Allen, are prancing around and thumbing their noses, gleeful at the publicity and possible income it could generate for their enterprise.</p>
        <p>The consuming hobby of Mr. Staton, a funeral director from Baton Rouge, La., is corresponding with serial killers around the country, winning their trust, then persuading them to become artists and arranging the exhibition and sale of their work. Until they had a falling out, Mr. Staton was the exclusive dealer for John Wayne Gacy, whose clown paintings sold for $200 apiece.</p>
        <p>Mr. Staton's partner, Mr. Allen, invented a serial killer board game that was banned in Canada. In some ways he is the creepier of the two. The movie shows him reverentially gathering dirt and rock samples from a murder victims' burial ground in Houston. His pilgrimage to the Southern California site of Charles Manson's notorious bloodbath has an aura of grotesque religiosity.</p>
        <p>Mr. Staton says there are nice killers and some not so nice. Mr. Gacy is dismissed as insufferable; Elmer Wayne Henley, who is serving six consecutive life sentences, is his current pet. Mr. Henley was a collaborator in the abduction, sexual torture and murder of 27 teenage boys in the Houston area in the summer of 1973.</p>
        <p>The movie's shots of Mr. Henley's paintings and drawings show him to be a decent draftsman. And interviewed in prison, he seems mild mannered and articulate. Mr. Staton has even become a close friend of Mr. Henley's mother, whose appearance in the movie adds a creepy Texas Gothic touch.</p>
        <p>Mr. Staton's exhibitions haven't gone unnoticed. They have aroused the ire of some of the victims' family members, who appear on camera to remind the audience of the horrifying acts committed against their dead loved ones. The film's drama, such as it is, culminates at an exhibition of Mr. Henley's work in which outraged relatives invade the gallery, purchase one of his drawings, then ritualistically destroy it.</p>
        <p>If ''Collectors'' pretends to be a serious study of a certain kind of fetishism and its implications for the human condition, the movie has no soul. Watching it is like observing a macabre dog and pony show.</p>
