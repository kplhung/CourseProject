        <p>Four months after the Tony Awards broadcast registered its lowest ratings, the show's overseers are close to hiring a new managing producer, presumably to add some zip.</p>

        <p>Four months after the Tony Awards broadcast registered its lowest ratings, the show's overseers are close to hiring a new managing producer, presumably to add some zip.</p>
        <p>In typical Broadway fashion, however, the new blood is an old Broadway hand: Elizabeth Ireland McCann, Edward Albee's longtime producer. She will replace Edgar Dobie, who ran the show for two years. He's leaving to produce the coming Broadway musical ''Tom Sawyer,'' though it has been an open secret that the Tonys have been seeking a replacement.</p>
        <p>Ms. McCann's appointment was not final yesterday, though one member of the committee, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said it was nearly assured. The change, which was discussed by the Tony management on Wednesday, comes after several months of discussions between top officials for the two groups that oversee the awards, the League of American Theaters and Producers and the American Theater Wing, which founded the Tonys.</p>
        <p>As is often the case with the two groups, the decision has not come easily. Ms. McCann, known as a fiery negotiator, is considered a surprising choice by some industry types, considering the diplomacy needed to maneuver between the league, which sees the Tonys as a valuable merchandising device, and the wing, which favors a more traditional program (just the awards, please).</p>
        <p>But Ms. McCann said she was confident she was up to task. ''I'm an Irish politician,'' she said, ''and a moving target.'' Asked what she planned to do to improve the Tony show, she was blunt. ''I'm going to try to make it more entertaining,'' she said. Exactly how much creative control she enjoys, however, is one of the sticking points in negotiation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dobie seemed relieved when asked about Ms. McCann's appointment. ''I'm thrilled,'' he said. ''It's a hell of a lot of work.''</p>
        <p>While last June's broadcast was widely considered an improvement on 1999, when Rosie O'Donnell took the year off from her role as host, the 2000 show reached a disappointing audience of about 6.5 million viewers. Part of that was the competition: the Tonys were up against the N.B.A. championships and ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.'' But many in the theater felt the show -- and Mr. Dobie -- were hampered by the continued tension between the league and the wing. ''These people are like the Hatfields and the McCoys,'' one league member said. ''So you have to have someone who is acceptable to both sides. And Liz is that person.''</p>
        <p>West End Looks West</p>
        <p>Two British productions, one just opened, another set to close, are causing a bit of speculation on this side of the pond.</p>
        <p>The first is ''Madame Melville,'' the new play by Richard Nelson (''James Joyce's 'The Dead' '') that opened in the West End last week to strong notices, including several raves for its leading man, the former ''Home Alone'' imp, Macaulay Culkin. The Evening Standard, for instance, called Mr. Culkin's performance, as a teenager in lust with an older woman, ''an absolutely remarkable West End stage debut.''</p>
        <p>One of the play's producers, Gregory Mosher, seems cautiously confident about a New York transfer. ''We're still taking stock,'' he said. ''But I wouldn't be surprised if it ended up in New York.'' If so, look for a March or April opening.</p>
        <p>Also making waves is ''My Zinc Bed,'' the newest play by David Hare, which concludes its West End engagement tomorrow. The play, starring Julia Ormond, is produced by Robert Fox, who is eyeing a Broadway run though probably not till next season. British newspapers have suggested that Geoffrey Rush may be in a New York production, but Mr. Fox said it was too early to say. ''There are no definite plans yet,'' he said, ''but there is motion.''</p>
        <p>'That Moves Me'</p>
        <p>It has been three years since Lili Taylor, who has built a film career out of gritty characterizations, made her Broadway debut in a star-studded, critically slammed production of Chekhov's ''Three Sisters,'' at the Roundabout Theater Company. Now she's coming back to the stage in something closer to her tastes.</p>
        <p>Beginning in February, Ms. Taylor will be seen Off Broadway in ''The Dead Eye Boy,'' at the MCC Theater on West 28th Street. In the play, by Angus MacLachlan, Ms. Taylor portrays a single mother battling with a drinking problem, a sketchy boyfriend and a pubescent son.</p>
        <p>A Chicago native, Ms. Taylor, 33, has a long connection to the stage. A member of the Naked Angels theater company, she got strong reviews in 1993 in the acclaimed ''Aven' U Boys.'' As for ''Dead Eye Boy,'' Ms. Taylor said the script reminded her of ''older Sam Shepard.''</p>
        <p>''I think what grabbed me is the struggle of the characters,'' she said. ''How they were trying their best. That moves me, even when there are  obstacles they're not going to overcome.''</p>
        <p>Along the Way</p>
        <p>*The Henry Miller Theater will have a new tenant starting next month: ''The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant,'' by Rainer Werner Fassbinder. Written in the late 1960's, the play centers on Petra, a fashion designer who has a torrid affair with a younger woman. The production has been spearheaded by Anita Durst, an actress and the daughter of the developer Douglas Durst, who owns the Henry Miller and most of the block it sits on. The show begins a 12-week run on Nov. 30.</p>
        <p>*Warren Leight is getting back to his roots. Long before he won a Tony for ''Side Man,'' Mr. Leight was the author, with Cassandra Danz and Mary Fulham, of a cabaret act based on the trials of a fictitious all-girl comedy troupe. Now the the group's newest adventures are having a limited run at LaMama Etc. in the East Village. The new show, ''Fame Takes a Holiday,'' began last night and runs through Nov. 19. Information: (212) 475-7710.</p>
        <p>*Elevator Repair Service, one of downtown's smartest young companies, has a new show: ''Highway to Tomorrow,'' an oddball adaptation of ''The Bacchae.'' (Dionysus is portrayed partly by a silver Thermos.) The show runs through Nov. 18 at Here, 145 Avenue of the Americas, at Dominick Street, South Village.</p>
