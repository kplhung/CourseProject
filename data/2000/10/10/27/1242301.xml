        <p>Shares of Nextel Communications fell more than 20 percent as investors, worried about growth in the wireless telephone company's subscriber base, ignored a smaller-than-anticipated loss. Nextel, as expected, added fewer subscribers in the third quarter than analysts had predicted, contributing to a sell-off of its shares. Nextel said its net loss narrowed to $236 million, or 31 cents a diluted share, from $361 million, or 55 cents, a year earlier. Analysts had forecast a loss of 37 cents a share. Nextel's revenue climbed 59 percent, to $1.4 billion, in the third quarter.</p>
