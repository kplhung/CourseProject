        <p>'What, Are You Jealous?'  D'Amelio Terras  525 West 22nd Street, Chelsea  Through Nov. 4</p>
        <p>The slight buzz surrounding this solo debut by Delia Brown, who is 30 and from Los Angeles, a onetime aspiring rapper, might be annoying if it weren't clearly like so many other instantly forgotten pseudo-events. Fad, not coincidentally, is Ms. Brown's subject. She paints and draws fashion spreads: she asks attractive friends and hires models to pose in gaudy interiors or poolside -- topless sometimes, to scandalize us of course -- with bottles of Moet and bags of Doritos. Once in a while she joins in, too, in panties, bra, stilettos, sunglasses and a Betsey Johnson leopard coat, say, or dressed up like Marie Antoinette.</p>

        <p>'What, Are You Jealous?'  D'Amelio Terras  525 West 22nd Street, Chelsea  Through Nov. 4</p>
        <p>The slight buzz surrounding this solo debut by Delia Brown, who is 30 and from Los Angeles, a onetime aspiring rapper, might be annoying if it weren't clearly like so many other instantly forgotten pseudo-events. Fad, not coincidentally, is Ms. Brown's subject. She paints and draws fashion spreads: she asks attractive friends and hires models to pose in gaudy interiors or poolside -- topless sometimes, to scandalize us of course -- with bottles of Moet and bags of Doritos. Once in a while she joins in, too, in panties, bra, stilettos, sunglasses and a Betsey Johnson leopard coat, say, or dressed up like Marie Antoinette.</p>
        <p>She calls these setups performance works, believe it or not, because occasionally they're done in public. This is like shooting fish in a barrel, but let me quote the gallery's news release, which, never mind the hilarious grammar, tells you pretty much what Ms. Brown and her handlers expect of us. About a performance at her art school graduation: ''Exciting, enticing and exclusive, the event challenged the viewer to confront their parallel feelings of attraction and repulsion when faced with this seductive spectacle.''</p>
        <p>So there you have it. It's too bad that, to judge from what's here, she is not a particularly good fashion illustrator. The big paintings are slightly better, a couple of them capturing the crisp blue light of Southern California in a photographic style that can almost make you think of early Malcolm Morley. Almost but not quite. Ms. Brown throws in a few references to artists, as if anyone serious about art might take the work more seriously. It's certainly a spectacle.</p>
