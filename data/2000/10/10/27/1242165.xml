        <p>The album-size paintings often referred to as ''Indian miniatures'' have the look of deluxe collectibles.

        <p>The album-size paintings often referred to as ''Indian miniatures'' have the look of deluxe collectibles. Produced for rich clients who demanded the very best in workmanship, they were enjoyed in private, then shut away like high-security gems, so that their suave forms and brilliant colors retained their expensive bloom.</p>
        <p>And preserved along with pigment and paper were other, less tangible elements, which the owners themselves may well never have clearly perceived. These include moral values, spiritual longings, political ambitions and personal aspirations: things that have always made collecting art almost as consuming an activity as creating it in the first place.</p>
        <p>These ingredients all come into play in ''Power and Desire: South Asian Paintings From the San Diego Museum of Art, Edwin Binney 3rd Collection'' at the Asia Society. The 67 pieces on view are top-of-the-line examples of work produced in Hindu and Muslim courts from the 16th to 19th centuries.</p>
        <p>They also represent the legacy of a single acquisitive eye, that of Mr. Binney (1925-1986), heir to the Crayola fortune, a trustee of the San Diego Museum and apparently quite a character. (He went to board meetings on a motorcycle and had a thing for black leather jumpsuits.) His collection of more than 1,450 South Asian paintings was bought by the museum in 1990.</p>
        <p>As in any ''collection'' show, the stylistic emphasis is to some degree determined by the material available; in this case there's a heavy emphasis on Mogul-influenced work from the Punjab hills. And the contents are necessarily organized along fairly broad and well-tried themes.</p>
        <p>Within these parameters, though, the curators, Vishakha Desai, director of galleries at Asia Society; Kavita Singh, research editor of Marg Publications; and Caron Smith, curator of Asian art at the San Diego Museum, have made smart choices and shaped a vivid picture of the alternative universe that is Indian painting, a kind of grand theater, equal parts farce, melodrama and mystery play, where men strut like gods, gods have the failings of men and nature is a gorgeous curtain behind which infinity lies.</p>
        <p>Appropriately for an election year, the show starts with a section titled ''Rule and Domain'' and images of politicians trying to make themselves look good. In a largish painting from around 1720, for example, the ruler of the Rajput kingdom of Mewar, Sangram Singh, has himself depicted in a palace reception room that looks like a day care center. He's playing the part of Daddy, with his baby daughter on his knee and his spiritual adviser -- a Bill Clinton lookalike, I swear -- sitting nearby.</p>
        <p>Family values take an interesting twist in a 1640 picture of the Mogul emperor Shah Jahan, seen celebrating his 46th birthday. He sits in profile, his head surrounded by a halo -- the Mogul rulers considered themselves divine -- with two of his sons.  All's right with the world, the message seems to be, but it wouldn't stay right for long. A few years later, one of the sons killed his brother, imprisoned his father and took the throne for himself.</p>
        <p>Various macho scenes follow: rulers go hunting, smoke hookahs and lord it over this vassal or that. Then things relax a bit. In one madcap painting, a potentate named Bhim Singh is joined in the swimming pool of his summer home (which is now the Lake Palace Hotel at Udaipur) by his male staff. He wears a pearl choker; they play blindman's bluff. You can almost hear Bette Midler belting out ''Boogie-Woogie Bugle Boy'' with the girl-band in the foreground.</p>
        <p>And in a sexy picture across the room, Shamsher Sen, the king of Mandi, appears nearly nude and being rubbed down by five male courtiers. The scene is thought to depict a religious ritual in which the royal leader was worshiped as a deity, but the roaming hands and ogling eyes focused on his youthful body suggest all kinds of devotion at play.</p>
        <p>The merging of human and divine is a primary theme of Indian art, and it is the overarching subject of the show's central section, ''Love and Longing.'' Among the items here are some superb illustrations for the ''Ramayana,'' in which the divine hero, Rama, an incarnation of the god Vishnu, fights to save his wife, Sita, from the clutches of the 10-headed demon-king.</p>
        <p>This fantastic story is recited everywhere in India, has been dramatized countless times and has been turned into Bollywood films. But no cinematic wizardry can top the inventiveness of the Indian painters, whether they're showing the grisly, corpse-strewn aftermath of a battle or depicting Rama's gilded chariot transformed into an ark-size mother ship and floating through starry skies.</p>
        <p>Rama was the Rambo of Indian literature, brawny and brave but a tad short in the brains department. Krishna, with his pretty-boy face and blue-suede skin, was the Elvis. Also an incarnation of Vishnu, he was a mama's boy who teased the girls and played hard-to-get. But what he did most was yearn for true love.</p>
        <p>Artists never tired of recounting his amorous pursuits, particularly his affair with a young village matron, Radha, whom he adored. Their affair -- a fever chart of hesitation, despair and rapturous union -- is one of the great love stories, very beautiful, very Indian. It's also a metaphor for the relationship of the soul to God. No wonder certain Hindu rulers took Krishna, who embodied the force of erotic and spiritual love, as their model.</p>
        <p>One such devotee was Sawant Singh, an 18th-century king of the small state of Kishangarh, who abandoned his throne and retired with his favorite mistress, Bani Thani, to re-create the Krishna-Radha story in his own life. A wonderful painting attributed to the artist Nihal Chand is thought to depict the two lovers in the guise of the divine couple, sleeping on a bed of lotus blossoms deep in a forest that rises up like a dense tapestry behind them.</p>
        <p>A bright little strip of sky at the top of this painting, however, hints at another hemisphere peeking in from behind, one perhaps represented by the images in the show's last section where divinity rules and divergent forces merge.</p>
        <p>In one painting, Shiva and his wife, Devi -- a power couple if ever there was one -- are spliced together vertically. And in a devotional painting derived from the ''Mahabharata,'' Vishnu is shown absorbing all the gods of the universe into his body, their tremendous compressed energy conveyed by the heads that pile up on his shoulders and the dozens of arms like spinning pinwheels.</p>
        <p>This piece, with its pattern-intensive approach to naturalism, points toward a whole other realm of Indian painting: nonelite, ''popular'' work of a kind unrepresented in this show and in general absurdly understudied. (The American artist and scholar Barbara Rossi published a fine overview of the subject titled ''From the Ocean of Painting'' two years ago.) It's a huge field full of work that will knock your socks off, and one that can still offer bargains for collectors. Maybe the Asia Society will find a way to showcase some aspect of it, in depth, in the future.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the Binney paintings are in New York, the power-and-desire capital of the world, and they're worth savoring. They have something for everyone, swoony lovers, alpha-male strivers and covetous connoisseurs alike. And as is the case with Indian art right across the board -- can this be the reason such a great tradition has always felt strange to the West? -- they look at life in all its variety and say, unreservedly: ''yes.''</p>
        <p>''Power and Desire: South Asian Paintings From the San Diego Museum of Art, Edwin Binney 3rd Collection'' remains at Asia Society at Midtown, 502 Park Avenue, at 59th Street, (212) 517-2742, through Jan. 7.</p>
