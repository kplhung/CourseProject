        <p>The sensitive question about how much Paul O'Neill has thought about his deceased father during the World Series was asked, and O'Neill instantly started fiddling with the index finger on his left hand. There were two wedding bands on his finger, one thick gold band and a much thinner gold band resting beneath it.</p>
        <p>O'Neill separated them to show that there were two bands, but then pressed them back together to keep them close. With his voice wavering and his eyes trained on the concrete floor near the parking lot at Shea Stadium, O'Neill first answered the question with his action. Yes, his tinkering with the bands indicated, he has thought about his father. Yes, he feels his father, who died one year ago today, is still with him.</p>

        <p>The sensitive question about how much Paul O'Neill has thought about his deceased father during the World Series was asked, and O'Neill instantly started fiddling with the index finger on his left hand. There were two wedding bands on his finger, one thick gold band and a much thinner gold band resting beneath it.</p>
        <p>O'Neill separated them to show that there were two bands, but then pressed them back together to keep them close. With his voice wavering and his eyes trained on the concrete floor near the parking lot at Shea Stadium, O'Neill first answered the question with his action. Yes, his tinkering with the bands indicated, he has thought about his father. Yes, he feels his father, who died one year ago today, is still with him.</p>
        <p>''My Mom gave me this two days ago,'' said O'Neill, holding out his hand as if he were inspecting a manicure. ''It was my Dad's wedding ring. It was something that always reminded me of him. I wanted to have it. It was the first thing they took off him. She wanted me to have it.''</p>
        <p>After stopping the Mets, 4-2, in Game 5 of the World Series, the Yankees won their third straight title. O'Neill finished with 9 hits in 19 at-bats after sputtering through the first two rounds of the postseason and being removed twice for pinch-hitters. If this was O'Neill's finale in a glorious career with the Yankees, he drifted away in style.</p>
        <p>''He knows,'' Manager Joe Torre said, ''what a big game is all about.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees celebrated another title last night, but one image from the 1999 clincher is still memorable. When the Yankees recorded the final out last October, we saw Jorge Posada hug Mariano Rivera, we saw Derek Jeter jab a finger into the sky and we saw Torre get misty. We also saw O'Neill, who had learned hours before that his father, Charles, had died, cave into his emotions and weep uncontrollably as he buried his face in Torre's shoulder. The image is gripping.</p>
        <p>''I hate to go back a year ago,'' O'Neill said. ''I've always wanted to get back to this point where we had a chance to win it again so I could enjoy it a little more.''</p>
        <p>Charles O'Neill, a former minor league player, whose career ended after a paratrooping accident in World War II, died of complications from heart disease at age 79. Paul, the youngest of six children, began playing baseball as a 2-year-old to keep up with his four brothers and sister. Charles adored Paul's feisty approach, loved that his little boy called him Little Buddy or Old-Timer and was always thrilled to simply hang out with his son in the clubhouse.</p>
        <p>''You're born and raised with your father being your hero,'' O'Neill said. ''That's what you try to be. Every kid in my family feels that way. Anything you accomplish is because of what your parents did for you.''</p>
        <p>Walking with O'Neill and asking about his father was difficult and eerie because it was the fifth anniversary of my own father's death. I still remember getting the call from my crying wife at a hotel in Cleveland at 3 a.m. She said she was sorry to have to do this and then told me that my dad had passed away. I remember screaming ''no'' over and over.</p>
        <p>I left the World Series and flew to Newark that morning. I remember that the cabdriver was the first person to offer condolences. I remember writing a eulogy and crying while reading it. I remember a train delayed our procession to the cemetery, which we felt was a signal that my father, who loved trains, was telling us he was fine. I told O'Neill I was asking about his father because I understood how he felt, having lost my mother and then my father 53 weeks later. He nodded.</p>
        <p>''It's amazing, isn't it?'' O'Neill said, sounding in awe and in fear over something you cannot ever prepare for.</p>
        <p>The Yankees won their fourth championship in the last five seasons, but O'Neill conceded there would be a void because his father is not here. Like other sons and daughters, O'Neill spoke valiantly about moving on and being a dedicated son and father. But, sometimes, those valiant words sound scripted. It is what you feel you should say, but it is not always how you feel.</p>
        <p>''There's not a day that goes by, in anything that I do, where something doesn't remind me of him,'' O'Neill said. ''I wish he could be here.''</p>
        <p>The conversation was almost over. O'Neill's answers, though vivid, were growing shorter and he was approaching the team bus. I thanked him for sharing his thoughts on a painful subject and O'Neill, who can often be cranky when he is asked about himself, thanked me. O'Neill was happy that someone, besides his family, had remembered the importance of Charles O'Neill.</p>
        <p>''I'd much rather talk about my father than about what has changed for me at the plate,'' O'Neill said. ''He was my hero.''</p>
