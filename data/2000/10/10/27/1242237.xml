        <p>Sony's PlayStation 2 video game console made its long-awaited and predictably frenzied North American debut yesterday. But what should have been a banner day for Sony was clouded by reminders of the difficulties it has had in bringing the device to market.</p>
        <p>A month ago, Sony warned that it would have just 500,000 units in stores for the debut instead of the million originally projected. And in releasing its quarterly earnings yesterday, the company was clearly feeling the financial pain of fumbling the rollout. The expense of racing to recover from production problems contributed to a 57 percent decline in net profits in the quarter ended Sept. 30, compared with a year earlier.</p>
        <p>Moreover, Sony said the cost of developing PlayStation 2 would leave its games division with an operating loss for the current fiscal year, ending March 30. That division, led by the original PlayStation, produced 40 percent of the company's overall operating profit last year.</p>
        <p>All told, Sony earned 19.8 billion yen ($182 million) in the recent quarter, compared with 46.5 billion yen a year earlier. Analysts had expected the company to earn 26.6 billion yen, according to Bloomberg News.</p>
        <p>Despite Sony's plans to ship 100,000 of the new PlayStations each week from the end of October until Christmas, analysts estimated that sales will fall at least 700,000 units below previous projections for the Christmas season, costing more than $200 million in revenue. And that is not counting lost sales from game software and compact discs that can be played on the device, the first that lets users play video games, browse the Internet and play DVD-format discs on one machine.</p>
        <p>Sony said it still expected to catch up with its long-term plans to have sold 10 million PlayStation 2 devices by the end of March. But investors were either less confident or more short-term in their perspective. Sony's American depository receipts tumbled on the New York Stock Exchange, closing at $90.75, down $4.31. The results were announced after the Tokyo markets closed.</p>
        <p>One unknown is how committed potential PlayStation purchasers are to buying the device, which has a recommended retail price of $299.  For retailers like Jeff Ferentz, manager of the K B Toy Works store in West Orange, N.J., the early demand yesterday seemed strong.</p>
        <p>His store had received only 30 units, just enough for those who put down deposits as long ago as April.  ''There were 15 people waiting for it when we opened this morning, but only one of them was on our presold list,'' Mr. Ferentz said.</p>
        <p>Yesterday's shoppers quickly filled Mr. Ferentz's list for one of the next 30 arrivals, which he is selling as part of a $500 package including three games, along with a promise to deliver before Christmas. The rest went away to search at other stores, a quest almost certain to be fruitless for most for months to come. Mr. Ferentz said he had received more than 100 inquiries by midday.</p>
        <p>A rival game maker, Sega, has said it hopes that many game fans will decide to buy its less expensive Dreamcast system instead. But Mr. Ferentz said many of those turned away yesterday had not yet given up hope of finding a PlayStation 2 before Christmas. ''People have been saving money for this,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Sony needs to develop all the momentum it can for PlayStation before the middle of next year, when it will face the threat of sophisticated new game systems from Microsoft, which will be introducing its Xbox line, and Nintendo, which will be unveiling its new system, GameCube.</p>
