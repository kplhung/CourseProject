        <p>The girls were 2 and 4 when their mother abandoned them near a city park in Miami in 1986. Under federal law, the Florida Department of Children and Family Services was supposed to place them for adoption or return them home within 18 months.</p>
        <p>Instead, over the next 14 years the sisters were shuttled through more than 30 foster homes and institutions, beaten, raped and repeatedly separated from each other while a stream of caseworkers overlooked such obvious evidence of abuse as the diagnosis of syphilis in the older girl when she was 9.</p>
        <p>The sisters' ordeal could have been just another horror story in a national litany of foster care abuses. But last year a Florida Circuit Court jury awarded them $4.4 million in damages from the state.</p>
        <p>The case laid the groundwork for a new strategy in which advocacy groups for children and personal injury lawyers, some fresh from winning billions of dollars in legal settlements with the tobacco companies,  are using the threat of multimillion dollar damage awards to try to change the deeply troubled foster care system.</p>
        <p>In the past, individual damage suits for injured foster children were typically settled behind the scenes for small amounts. And efforts to win systemic changes through court orders have often been frustrated by failures of enforcement.</p>
        <p>But court rulings that make government agencies easier to sue and sizable jury awards in foster care cases like the one in Florida have encouraged advocates for foster children and personal injury lawyers to join forces over the past few months in two-track litigation. Their lawsuits ask the courts to change the system,  while separately seeking damages on behalf of children already harmed.</p>
        <p>''This is for change, and to get the attention of the powers that be -- any money will go to the kids,'' said Robert Montgomery, the lead counsel in the tobacco settlements in Florida and one of a dozen top trial lawyers who began working without pay on the foster care suits this summer.</p>
        <p>The sisters' case was filed by Karen Gievers, who has a lead role in both the lawsuits for damages and the class action seeking changes in the Florida system.</p>
        <p>Across the country, a similar pincer approach is typified by Tim Farris, a Bellingham, Wash., trial lawyer who has brought damage suits in state courts for 13 children shuttled  from foster home to foster home in a total of 208 placements. The California-based National Center for Youth Law, a nonprofit children's advocacy group, recently joined his effort to leverage those cases into a multimillion-dollar overhaul of the state's child welfare system.</p>
        <p>''In my own small-town way I said, 'Look, you can move these children as often as you wish, but if you do, you're going to have to pay for the  damages you do to them,'' Mr. Farris said, ''and it's going to be cheaper to treat them right.''</p>
        <p>Few suggest this kind of litigation is a shortcut either to riches or to an overhaul of the state programs that are trying to care for 600,000 children outside their homes. State agencies typically can only be sued for compensation, not punitive damages, and they can make it daunting in time and money to unearth confidential records needed to prove a case and collect. The $4.4 million Florida verdict is on hold pending an appeal.</p>
        <p>But at a time when child-friendly policies figure prominently in election campaigns, the political potency of such cases may outweigh the legal drawbacks, said John Coffee, a professor of law at Columbia University.  ''Plaintiffs' lawyers have learned that the class action can be very, very useful when the state agency has some vulnerability,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The vulnerability of government agencies has grown considerably in some states. Jeff Freimund, an assistant attorney general for Washington, said courts there had rejected legislative caps on negligence awards, and government payouts in civil cases in general have quadrupled in six years, to $38 million in the last three months alone.</p>
        <p>''The courts have opened the door to litigation on child welfare activities,'' Mr. Freimund said. ''They're very difficult cases to defend in front of juries because juries often have the benefit of 20-20 hindsight.''</p>
        <p>Some officials, including Kathleen A. Kearney, the secretary of the Florida Department of Children and Families, say such litigation unfairly detracts from continuing efforts to improve child welfare, diverting resources that legislatures, not courts, should control. But others, frustrated at the persistence of problems documented and denounced for 20 years, welcome the new strategy.</p>
        <p>''Money talks, and money makes policy,'' said Jean Soliz, who headed Washington's Department of Social and Health Services for three years, until 1995. She recalled that state legislators made all the right speeches during her tenure, but put $30 million into a new sports stadium rather than provide court advocates or mental health care for Washington's 11,000 foster children. Today, fewer than half have an advocate in court proceedings, and more than a third have been moved through three or more foster homes, studies show.</p>
        <p>''The torts give you leverage to make them take it seriously; the torts don't fix anything,'' said Ms. Soliz, who now directs the spending of a tobacco tax earmarked for children in Nevada County, Calif. She emphasizes the importance of enlisting national advocacy groups that can draw on lessons from court consent decrees they have won in suits against child welfare systems in at least 20 states.</p>
        <p>Bill Grimm, a lawyer with the National Center for Youth Law, said groups like his had become more open to alliances with personal injury lawyers because conventional strategies had run into obstacles. While Congress has enacted tougher foster care requirements -- foster care time limits, for example, are now set at a year rather than 18 months -- federal judges in some states have recently made it harder for children to seek enforcement of those laws in federal court. Their rulings hold that Congressional requirements intended to protect foster children do not constitute rights.</p>
        <p>''We are at a bit of a crossroads,'' Mr. Grimm said.</p>
        <p>Even in states already operating under sweeping settlements, damage suits are playing a more prominent role. In New York City, where an ambitious child welfare consent decree imposed a moratorium on new class-action lawsuits, the Administration for Children's Services has paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in settlements to fathers who were not notified that their children were in foster care. And city lawyers are negotiating to settle a multimillion-dollar lawsuit over a toddler who was beaten to death by foster parents with a known history of abuse.</p>
        <p>But there are perils to trying to turn such cases into a broader crusade in the absence of national allies or deep pockets, said Lawrence Berlin, an Arizona lawyer who has won settlements averaging $250,000 for a dozen children sexually abused in foster care. His motion to turn the cases of some children into a more powerful class action was denied in federal court after six years of litigation that consumed his practice, he said. The state rejected his offer to settle for systemic changes.</p>
        <p>''I'm not saying children haven't been abused,'' said Tom Prose, an assistant Arizona attorney general in charge of liability cases, who emphasized that the current administration had made child protection a top priority. ''The issue is, is it pervasive and are we ignoring it? And my answer to you is, in Arizona, it's neither.''</p>
        <p>In Florida, where the number of children in foster care has nearly doubled since 1998, to 15,000, the class-action suit contends that foster children are now in greater danger of emotional and physical injury from the state than from the families from which they were taken.</p>
        <p>''We had a toddler in a foster home so overcrowded the kid spent the weekend strapped into a car seat,'' said Marcia Robinson Lowry, the director of Children Rights, a national advocacy organization based in New York, which recently joined the Florida class action.</p>
        <p>Among the companion damage suits in Florida are some that highlight the harm flowing from one bad foster home, that of a couple in Hillsborough County. After the couple were arrested in May on 40 felony charges of child abuse and neglect, it emerged that the state had entrusted them with 28 foster children over four years, even as caseworkers recorded their abusive practices.</p>
        <p>''My brother has severe problems because of what happened in that home,'' said Ashley Rhodes-Courter, now 14, who entered foster care at 3 because of her mother's drug problems, and endured 14 placements. She was 7 and her brother 4 during their year in the couple's home.</p>
        <p>''He was abused,'' she said. ''He had hot sauce put on his tongue; he was dunked in a bathtub until he was nearly drowned. It was very frightening to watch someone you love being mistreated and you being able to do nothing about it.''</p>
        <p>For Ashley, a resilient and academically gifted child, there was a happy ending. A family with the love, money and persistence to extract her from the system adopted her in 1998.  But her brother, who entered foster care at birth, lives in a treatment center, still waiting for a family capable of coping with the damage he suffered. He is one of 22 plaintiffs in the class action.</p>
        <p>Separately, he and Ashley are plaintiffs in damage suits brought or  planned against the state on behalf of all the Hillsborough County couple's former foster children, including the 23 that the state has refused to identify, and 8 the couple adopted with state subsidies who are now back in the foster care system.</p>
        <p>Proponents of double-edged litigation say that even if institutional change remains elusive, at least financial help can be won for a few of the children the system has wronged -- children like the two Florida sisters, now 17 and 18, who are both illiterate and both mothers.</p>
        <p>''You all hurt me all my life,'' the older sister told officials in a deposition last year, declaring her determination to keep her own baby daughter out of foster care. ''I hate every last one of you.''</p>
