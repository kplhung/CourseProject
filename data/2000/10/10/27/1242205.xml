        <p>Rodolfo Montiel, a farmer from this dirt-poor town up a lawless road in the southern mountains, saw the forest around him being destroyed.</p>
        <p>The cause, he said, was clandestine logging, financed by corrupt deals cut by local political bosses in league with army officers. So two years ago, he and 100 friends and neighbors formed the Organization of Peasant Farmer Ecologists, protesting against the deforestation of their land and the destruction of their lives.</p>
        <p>A violent reaction followed. The politically connected men who control the land and their allies in the army, which polices this part of the world, have apparently killed four of Mr. Montiel's friends, tortured others and struck fear into the peasant farmers for miles around. No one has been prosecuted. No one here expects that.</p>
        <p>''This is a place were people can kill without fear,'' said Albertano Penaloza, 39, a farmer from nearby Banco Nuevo.</p>
        <p>Mr. Montiel and a friend, Teodoro Cabrera, are in prison -- framed by the army, according to the government's human rights commission, but convicted nonetheless.</p>
        <p>''Here there's no justice,'' said Jesus Sanchez, 37, who runs the local cantina. ''The strongest one, the one who can kill someone else, is the one who makes the law.''</p>
        <p>This kind of tale can be heard all over Mexico. The lack of the rule of law is ''the theme that worries Mexicans most,'' said the nation's next president, Vicente Fox Quesada. And that is ''the most difficult problem that Fox will face'' when he takes office on Dec. 1, said a senior diplomat in Mexico City.</p>
        <p>Members of the police and the military can bend and break the law without much fear of punishment. Killing, torture, kidnappings and false arrests by law-enforcement authorities are prominent features of the legal landscape, charted in recent reports by the United Nations, the United States State Department, the Organization of American States and human rights groups.</p>
        <p>Mexican soldiers increasingly act as police officers. In the last two years, Mexico's leaders have ordered at least 5,000 soldiers to take the place of law-enforcement agencies that the government concedes are corrupt or inefficient.</p>
        <p>In southern states like Guerrero, they are often the only law enforcers and are apparently all but immune from civilian justice.</p>
        <p>Mexico's former governing party, ousted from the presidency by Mr. Fox after seven decades, often used crooked police officers and corrupt courts to protect its loyalists and punish its enemies. Many Mexicans now perceive the justice system as little but a political tool.</p>
        <p>In Guerrero, Mr. Montiel said in a jailhouse interview, justice is whatever the politically powerful and their backers in the armed forces say it is. ''They're who people are afraid of,'' he said. ''They have a lot of power. Because they have made money from the wood, they can hire gunmen and pay off the government.''</p>
        <p>El Mameyal, a town of 400 people, stands far back in the soaring sierra, 40 miles up a very rough road from the Pacific Ocean, a long way from the modern world. It has no running water, no plumbing, no school, one store and one street, resembling a dry riverbed, trafficked mainly by pigs and chickens.</p>
        <p>The richest people in town own a few cattle and scratch out a living selling milk or cheese or meat or tacos. The poorest have almost nothing but the land around them. By law, they own the land. In reality, it is being stolen.</p>
        <p>In 1998, Mr. Montiel and his friends saw the land being systematically stripped of trees. With the trees went their way of life. The denuded hills were eroding, the arable land below was washing away, the springs that were the only source of drinking water were choking.</p>
        <p>What Mr. Montiel perceived has been confirmed by satellite photographs. They show that 38 percent of the forest, 215,000 acres, around El Mameyal has disappeared in eight years.</p>
        <p>''People can see with their eyes that everything's being destroyed,'' said Jesus Cortez, 32, El Mameyal's folk-singing bard, who has composed traditional songs about the wasting away of the land.</p>
        <p>Mr. Montiel's protests soon made him a target. First he and his wife, Uvalde, were illegally searched by soldiers and robbed of their savings in the process, she said. Death threats followed. They fled with their six children to Mr. Cabrera's house in Pizotla. On May 2, 1999, soldiers burst into the house, arrested Mr. Montiel and Mr. Cabrera and killed a friend of theirs, Salome Sanchez, another farmer.</p>
        <p>''There's been no investigation, there's been no justice, there's been no consequences -- there's been nothing, nothing,'' said Mr. Sanchez's wife, Hermalinda, 41.</p>
        <p>The two arrested men were convicted in August of possessing drugs and guns -- despite the fact that the National Human Rights Commission found in July that they had been framed. They were unarmed at the time of their arrest, the commission found, soldiers planted guns and drugs on them, and they were tortured into confessing. The judge who is weighing their appeal is widely expected to rule in days.</p>
        <p>Edgar Cortez, director of the Miguel Agustin Pro Juarez Human Rights Center in Mexico City, the organization defending Mr. Montiel, said that throughout Guerrero ''soldiers are carrying out investigative work, taking on the role of the police and prosecutors, a role that does not belong to the army.''</p>
        <p>The farmers' group is in disarray. A friend of Mr. Monteil here, Senso Figueroa, 38, said: ''We live in fear of the law here. They can accuse us of anything.''</p>
        <p>The federal judge who convicted Mr. Montiel, Maclovio Murillo Chavez, said it was an ordinary criminal case. ''I see a lot of weapons possession cases,'' he said in an interview. ''They're all the same. The police testify that the accused were in possession of a weapon. The prosecutors file an affidavit. And there is always a confession.''</p>
        <p>Law-enforcement workers in Mexico regularly obtain information through torture, and prosecutors use that evidence in courts, which accept confessions extracted with the help of electric shocks, beatings or sexual abuse, human rights groups say.</p>
        <p>Amnesty International, which has named Mr. Montiel a prisoner of conscience, says the torture and arbitrary detention that he experienced are widespread in Mexico. The worst violators have been the federal and state judicial police, the rights groups say.</p>
        <p>President Ernesto Zedillo has conceded that is true. ''Instead of preventing, investigating, fighting crime,'' the judicial police have become ''cruel and dangerous criminals,'' more so ''because of the impunity that follows their actions,'' he said two years ago.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fox's aides have proposed doing away with the judicial police and creating a new national police force under a new federal prosecutor's office. A top adviser to Mr. Fox, and a possible member of his cabinet, Jose Luis Reyes, a former federal prosecutor, said the aim was to create ''a true rule of law'' in which the police and the military would be ''genuine protectors of society and not the source of fear for its citizens.''</p>
        <p>The fear here has been growing since 1995, when 17 peasant advocates in Guerrero were killed by the authorities in a military-style ambush. A commission formed by the Supreme Court found that the governor of Guerrero had helped cover up the killing. Nothing became of the accusation.</p>
        <p>The fear became stronger after Mr. Montiel's arrest, when military patrols began serving as the law in El Mameyal. Now a platoon of soldiers camps outside town, its presence felt by every villager.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Montiel, who now lives in Iguala, where her husband is imprisoned, said even if he was freed, they  would be afraid to return home.</p>
        <p>Mr. Penaloza, the farmer, said: ''We're losing our land. We're losing our lives, and we don't even have anyone to complain to. We go to the local authorities, and they say it's not their problem. And when we go to the governor, we have even less chance of an answer. We sure won't get it from the president. Maybe it's better for us to be quiet now.''</p>
