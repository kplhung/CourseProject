        <p>With its concrete floor and exposed sheetrock, the small store near Grand Central Terminal looks like a bar with an under-construction motif or a place with no interest in a long-term lease.</p>
        <p>And in fact, it won't be around long. This store trades in baseball ephemera, and will be gone before that Subway Series sweatshirt goes through its first rinse cycle.</p>
        <p>There, and in temporary outlets throughout the metropolitan area, a Kansas company called Sportswon is peddling the gimmicks of the moment. There are Subway Series shot glasses, Subway Series pennants, Subway Series pins, Subway Series T-shirts seared with images of Derek Jeter's piercing eyes and Mike Piazza's Fu Manchu. For those with a spiritual bent, there are Yankee Christmas ornaments. For those with a romantic streak, Met earrings.</p>
        <p>''Business is fantastic,'' said Tom Horne, the store's harried manager,  whose forehead glistened like that of a base runner who had just gone from first to third. He was surrounded by items that were priced to make noses bleed. Most of his merchandise, as well as the Subway Series items being sold at stores everywhere, was feverishly slapped together in factories around the country so that people who live in the faraway city of New York could adorn their walls, their shelves and themselves with gaudy reminders and remnants of a certain baseball series.</p>
        <p>In Seattle, Indianapolis and a Minnesota town called Winona, printing presses hissed to the glory of the Mets and Yankees. In Buffalo, machines hummed to embroider subway designs onto novelty caps. In San Diego, 20 people recently worked 15 hours straight to glue tiny metallic Mets and Yankees hats to World Series souvenir pins that had been produced weeks earlier in China.</p>
        <p>Such nationwide dedication has allowed local businesses like the Grand Slam store in Times Square to push aside those Statue of Liberty cigarette lighters and make room for any inanimate object large enough to bear two phrases: ''World Series 2000'' and ''Subway Series.''</p>
        <p>Those are the money phrases. And they have combined to create a red-hot moment for the $525-million-a-year sports-merchandising business. A trade newsletter, Sporting Goods Intelligence, recently chose a vivid image to reflect the industry's excitement: ''New York Subway Series Has Retailers Salivating.''</p>
        <p>And even though the 4-2 triumph by the Yankees ended the formal playing of games in the series, the opportunity for making money will endure. It is an optimism undaunted by the claims of economists questioning the true impact of the series on the local economy. If need be, they said, they can show you the money.</p>
        <p>The Yankee triumph, in fact, was hardly a headache, for the Yankees generate more sports-apparel sales than any franchise in sports.</p>
        <p>All along, though, manufacturers worked overtime to meet the demand and to coin a catchphrase for the victorious team. The Mets victory on Tuesday thwarted the Yankees from winning four consecutive games for a third consecutive championship; that meant that Logo Athletic Inc. in Indianapolis had to reject tentative plans for T-shirts reading: ''Sweepeat!''</p>
        <p>Last month, the industry that brings material manifestation to hero worship and hometown pride began preparing for a harmonic convergence in baseball: a Yankees-Mets World Series. Beyond the shipping-cost savings from having two teams from the same sports-frenzied city, the matchup provided subtexts of nostalgia and rareness to exploit.</p>
        <p>''This Subway Series has that added marketing play that they couldn't do if it was St. Louis and the Yankees,'' Bob McGee, the editor of Sporting Goods Intelligence, said. ''They can convince consumers around the country that -- even if you hate the Yankees -- it's a once-in-the-lifetime thing.''</p>
        <p>Many major sports-merchandising businesses have New York consultants to advise graphic artists on which phrases and faces resonate with fans. This year, artists learned that Mr. Jeter of the Yankees and Mr. Piazza of the Mets had come to personify their respective teams; that the No. 4 subway line goes to the Bronx, while the No. 7 goes to Flushing; that Mets fans now claim ownership to the Baha Men song, ''Who Let the Dogs Out?''</p>
        <p>''We're looking into that,'' acknowledged Eddie White, a vice president for Logo Athletic.</p>
        <p>Two guiding principles of the trade are to secure the necessary approval of Major League Baseball for every design, and to get the merchandise to retailers within hours of a deciding game. ''You move in when the stuff is hot,'' Mr. McGee said. ''And then get out of there before the stuff gathers dust on the shelves.''</p>
        <p>For example, shortly after the Yankees ensured a subway World Series by winning the American League pennant last week, workers at the Peter-David factory in San Diego dived into piles of pins. ''We had all the Mets caps put on the day before,'' recalled Jerry Mischler, the company's general manager. ''Then, about two in the morning, after the Yankees won, we put those caps on.''</p>
        <p>Peter Lindenbaum, an executive for the Modell's sporting-goods conglomerate -- with 57 outlets in the metropolitan area -- said his company had ''if when'' orders placed with factories around the country.</p>
        <p>''The moment that the game was clinched, they started printing and producing the merchandise,'' he said. ''We had trucks and vans that already had their routes planned out to get the merchandise delivered to our stores so that by the time we opened the next morning, at 7 A.M., we had the merchandise on the racks waiting for sales.''</p>
        <p>A brief foray into Subway Series semiotics suggests that the Yankees name or logo almost invariably appears above those of the Mets. ''It is subtle,'' said Bill Whitlock, a Sportswon vice president. ''But obviously, the Yankees have won so many for so many years now, and are favored for this one.''</p>
        <p>Then there is the near-deification of Mr. Jeter and Mr. Piazza. At the Sportswon outlet near Grand Central Station, a baseball bat bearing the likeness of Mr. Piazza was available for $129.87. That was cheaper than the $179.87 being sought for a framed, one-square-inch piece of pinstripe fabric that accompanied a photograph of Mr. Jeter.</p>
        <p>Mr. Horne said the Sportswon outlets opened around the city a week ago, and will continue selling baseball ephemera for several days. And then, like the moments they try to exploit, they will vanish.</p>
