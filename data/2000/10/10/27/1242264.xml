        <p>Kate Michelman, president of the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League, says she is fighting a myth as much as anything else in this presidential campaign.</p>
        <p>Many voters, Ms. Michelman argues, simply do not believe that Gov. George W. Bush, as president, would try to end most legalized abortion.</p>
        <p>Anti-abortion forces counter that voters know exactly what they would be getting with Mr. Bush and are glad of it: an anti-abortion president and a fundamental shift in the abortion and reproductive health policies of the last eight years.</p>
        <p>''I think the proponents of abortion are frustrated because the American public will vote for him with his pro-life position, and they don't know how to stop that,'' said Carol Tobias, political director for the National Right to Life Committee.</p>
        <p>Rarely have the politics of abortion been more complicated than they are in this presidential election -- or involved higher stakes.</p>
        <p>On paper, the candidates offer a stark choice: Vice President Al Gore is a supporter of abortion rights, while Mr. Bush is on record supporting a constitutional amendment that would outlaw abortion except in cases of rape, incest or when the life of the pregnant woman was in danger.</p>
        <p>The abortion rights and anti-abortion groups take each candidate at his word, and have mobilized accordingly.</p>
        <p>Yet Mr. Bush has sent many signals, and has occasioned endless speculation about how energetically he would try to end abortion as president.</p>
        <p>He has carefully avoided saying he would appoint only Supreme Court justices who would vote against the constitutional right to abortion. But he has also said he would look for ''strict constructionists'' and has cited two opponents of abortion rights, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, as the Supreme Court justices he most admires. He acknowledges that ''good people can disagree'' on abortion, but argues that he wants to create a ''culture of life.''</p>
        <p>His critics say Mr. Bush has done a masterful job of neutralizing, if not burying, an issue that has tormented past Republican nominees, who are often torn between the party's anti-abortion base and the independent suburban voters who decide elections.</p>
        <p>Abortion rights groups contend that many voters, including many independent and Republican women who support abortion rights, are either unaware of Mr. Bush's stand or do not believe he would pursue it.</p>
        <p>David J. Garrow, a historian at Emory University and a scholar of the abortion rights movement, said, ''Abortion rights groups should not be surprised in the slightest that their voters do not seem frightened, because Governor Bush has consistently, for many months now, worked very hard to seem unfrightening to pro-choice voters.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's political adroitness on the abortion issue has also involved giving enough quiet reassurance to right-to-life advocates that they have not revolted when, among other things, he has said he would not have a litmus test on the issue for his federal court nominees.</p>
        <p>''Here's someone who openly professes to be pro-life, and on those issues that are politically possible, he's with us, whereas we know Al Gore to be hostile,'' said Richard Lessner, vice president of American Renewal, the lobbying organization associated with the conservative Family Research Council.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, Mr. Lessner added: ''There's never a guarantee.  We have to remember that the previous President Bush appointed Justice Souter, so there's a certain risk there.'' Justice David H. Souter proved to be a bitter disappointment to conservatives after he took the bench, often voting with the liberal bloc.</p>
        <p>The next president will have many opportunities to affect the more than one million women who obtain abortions each year. Two appointments on the Supreme Court could, theoretically, create a majority to overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision that recognized a constitutional right to abortion. The election could also affect a wide variety of federal policies involving abortion and contraception, from the availability of the abortion drug RU-486 to the level of financing for abstinence education programs.</p>
        <p>Gloria Feldt, head of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, the group's political arm, argued that a Bush presidency ''will be devastating to reproductive rights and health as we have come to know it in this country.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Tobias said, ''The next president will have a tremendous impact on whether millions of unborn children live or die.''</p>
        <p>Each side is campaigning hard at the grass roots. For the first time in its 84-year history, Planned Parenthood has plunged into presidential politics, with a $7 million advertising campaign focused on women in seven close states. ''I don't want government in my private life, telling me what to do,'' a woman says in one of the group's television commercials.  ''And that's why I have a problem with George W. Bush.''</p>
        <p>And this week the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League, or Naral, said it would begin running commercials in swing states where Ralph Nader, the Green Party presidential nominee, is strong. The advertisement warns that a vote for Mr. Nader would come at the expense of Mr. Gore, and could give Mr. Bush an opportunity to appoint anti-abortion justices.</p>
        <p>Ms. Tobias, while declining to discuss the details of her side's efforts, said, ''Grass-roots pro-lifers are excited and energized about George Bush'' and will ''do whatever they can to help him win.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, each candidate is a lightning rod to the other side. Mr. Gore has become an unswerving supporter of abortion rights, with the whole-hearted support of abortion rights groups. Although he opposed federal spending for abortions in his early years in Congress, he reversed his position after he entered the Senate and has supported such spending for many years. Anti-abortion forces assert he abandoned his principles because of his national ambitions.</p>
        <p>Governor Bush has engendered similar contempt from abortion rights advocates for embracing his party's anti-abortion platform plank.  ''I am pro-life,'' he said in a statement to the National Right to Life Convention in June 1999.</p>
        <p>With those moves, Governor Bush allayed most doubts on the right about his commitment to the cause.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Bush has also tried to allay the fears of more centrist voters by suggesting that a constitutional amendment is a very distant goal. (In fact, the last time such an amendment came to a vote in Congress was 1983.) In an interview on NBC last week, for example, he said, ''In America, it's not going to be outlawed until a lot of people change their minds. And there's going to be abortions, one way or the other.''</p>
        <p>To the abortion rights side, Mr. Bush is trying to have it both ways.</p>
        <p>''He has promised them what they want,'' said Gloria Feldt, ''and their troops are disciplined enough that they will be quiet while the election is taking place -- then after the election they will go and collect.''</p>
        <p>In a New York Times/CBS News poll conducted in early September, a fourth of Mr. Bush's supporters said they thought it was likely that he would appoint justices to the Supreme Court who would keep abortion a legal right. An additional 30 percent said they did not know what kind of justices Mr. Bush would appoint.</p>
        <p>While most of the focus on abortion is on the basics ---- the Supreme Court and the essential legality ---- the candidates' positions have more immediate implications for reproductive programs.</p>
        <p>For example, Ray Sullivan, a spokesman for Governor Bush, said the candidate ''does not support the use of federal taxpayers dollars for abortion or abortion counseling in the United States or internationally.'' Mr. Sullivan declined to elaborate, but abortion rights groups say they expect Mr. Bush to push for a ''gag rule'' on counseling about abortion in federally funded family planning clinics. President George Bush's administration pushed for such a rule. There has long been a ban on the use of federal money to perform most abortions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush is also advocating a much greater emphasis on abstinence; he argues that education programs urging sexual abstinence until marriage should get ''at least'' as much financing as teenage contraception programs.</p>
        <p>The newly approved abortion pill, RU-486, would also be treated very differently by a Bush administration.  The pill was banned in President Bush's administration, but was approved by the Food and Drug Administration this fall. Governor Bush said that he thought the approval was ''wrong,'' but that he did not believe a president could overturn it. Mr. Sullivan said, however, that Governor Bush would support the new restrictions on the drug now being pushed by Republicans in Congress, which would substantially reduce its availability.</p>
