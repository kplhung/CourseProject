        <p>The Ballet Folklorico de Mexico put on a very good show on Saturday night at the New Jersey Center for the Performing Arts in Newark. Dance purists might have wished for something more than skirt-swirling from the company's women and quick-footed cantering from the men. But the massed, stamping dancers, gliding formations and spectacularly beautiful costumes rightly drew cheers throughout the evening.</p>
        <p>''Tenochtitlan'' gave the program a powerful start with its hard-driving depiction of the founding of the Aztec culture. The huge dancing puppets and frothy white dresses of ''Festivity in Tlacotalpan'' were another highlight, as was the cannonade of footbeats in ''The Platform Dance From Tixtla.'' The first half also included a remarkable lasso dance, suave twosomes in which the men's serapes and huge hats hid their partners, and several women who appeared to have high-kicked their way onto the stage from a late 19th-century Parisian nightclub.</p>

        <p>The Ballet Folklorico de Mexico put on a very good show on Saturday night at the New Jersey Center for the Performing Arts in Newark. Dance purists might have wished for something more than skirt-swirling from the company's women and quick-footed cantering from the men. But the massed, stamping dancers, gliding formations and spectacularly beautiful costumes rightly drew cheers throughout the evening.</p>
        <p>''Tenochtitlan'' gave the program a powerful start with its hard-driving depiction of the founding of the Aztec culture. The huge dancing puppets and frothy white dresses of ''Festivity in Tlacotalpan'' were another highlight, as was the cannonade of footbeats in ''The Platform Dance From Tixtla.'' The first half also included a remarkable lasso dance, suave twosomes in which the men's serapes and huge hats hid their partners, and several women who appeared to have high-kicked their way onto the stage from a late 19th-century Parisian nightclub.</p>
        <p>The most dazzling stage patterns were to be found in ''The Matachines,'' a new dance that alludes to indigenous prehistoric rituals. It was choreographed, as was the entire program, by Amalia Hernandez, who founded the troupe in 1952. Dancers dressed in fuschia, lime and turquoise, with large white-feathered disks on their heads, filled the stage with racing, eddying processionals that ended suddenly in kneeling and a plaintive yell.</p>
        <p>Women in brilliantly colored diaphanous skirts resembled butterflies in ''Chiapas,'' which also included two hilarious duets for shy but feisty young lovers. And yes, the evening ended with an amusingly brief slice of that American favorite, the Mexican Hat Dance.</p>
        <p>A big part of the show's charm was the music, performed with savvy gusto on a harp, xylophone, guitars, fiddles, drums and trumpets. The staging was enjoyably theatrical throughout the 10 suites of dances and musical numbers. But ''The Deer Dance'' suffered from that theatricality in a stylized version that failed to communicate the desperation of a hunted animal.</p>
