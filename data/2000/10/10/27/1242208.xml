        <p>Jeffrey N. Vinik, manager of one of the nation's largest hedge funds, said yesterday that he would shut down his $4.2 billion Boston fund and return his investors' money by the end of the year.</p>
        <p>Though the dissolution of Mr. Vinik's fund is the latest in a string of shake-ups at big hedge funds this year, it is unrelated to the turbulence in the markets.</p>
        <p>In fact, Mr. Vinik's performance has been quite strong as his particular style of investing has come back into fashion. This year his fund was up 45.6 percent, after fees, as of Oct. 20, compared with a 4.2 percent drop in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index.</p>
        <p>Mr. Vinik, 41, said that a desire to spend more time with his family was the reason he was closing his fund.</p>
        <p>''I have three children at home, ages 10, 8 and 6,'' he said. ''My wife is pregnant, so I have another one on the way. This is a great time in their lives when they want to see me more.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Vinik's departure from the world of hedge funds, private pools of money that cater to institutional investors and wealthy individuals, is markedly different from the way he left his last job. In the early-  and mid-90's, Mr. Vinik ran Fidelity Magellan, the nation's largest actively managed mutual fund. Late in 1995, he moved much of the fund's investment out of stocks and into bonds, a move that backfired as the market gained force. He left in 1996 as the fund fell to the bottom of industry rankings. (It has since recovered.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Vinik has not lost his penchant for making aggressive bets on the direction of the market. One of his investors confirmed yesterday that Mr. Vinik had moved roughly half of his portfolio into cash in the middle of the year.</p>
        <p>''The volatility made him nervous,'' said Hal Lindquist, senior investment officer of Blackstone Alternative Asset Management, a New York firm that invests in hedge funds.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lindquist was not complaining -- like all the investors in Mr. Vinik's hedge fund, he has made a lot of money. Mr. Vinik raised $800 million at the end of 1996 and has since returned 52.9 percent annually, more than twice the performance of the S.&amp; P. 500.</p>
        <p>He has run his hedge fund much like a mutual fund, betting on domestic stocks and avoiding many of the financial instruments employed by other hedge fund managers -- futures, options, commodities and bonds. He also uses a small degree of leverage and is primarily a buyer of stocks, not a short seller who tries to pick stocks that will decline.</p>
        <p>Mr. Vinik subscribes to the growth-at-a-reasonable price investing style made famous by his predecessor at Magellan, Peter Lynch. Generally speaking, it is a style that seeks out companies with accelerating earnings growth but also pays close attention to how a stock is priced relative to its intrinsic worth. Such a style did not garner the highest of returns last year, when the market showered cash on earnings-free Internet companies.</p>
        <p>Last year, Mr. Vinik's fund beat the S.&amp; P. 500, but his investors could have done much better in several technology or growth mutual funds. This year, he has scored with picks like AmeriCredit, a Fort Worth-based lender to people with low credit ratings, which is up 32.1 percent year to date.</p>
        <p>''This year, there's been a lot of money to be made by owning cheap stocks with good fundamentals,'' he said. ''It's been a better year, versus last year, for stock-picking.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Vinik said his firm, Vinik Asset Management, would cut about half of its staff of 22 and continue to manage his own money and that of his two partners -- Michael S. Gordon, the former manager of the Fidelity Blue Chip Growth fund, and Mark D. Hostetter, a securities lawyer.</p>
