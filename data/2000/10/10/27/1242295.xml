        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>While I support nearly all of Ralph Nader's proposals, I deplore his using a presidential campaign to spread the word (front page, Oct. 25). He and we know that he has no chance of winning the White House.  Why, then, is he running? Mainly, as I see it, to gain the possibility of making a realistic run in 2004.</p>
        <p>The presidential campaign is not a game or a publicity machine. It is supposed to give us a choice between candidates. Whoever wins will profoundly affect the lives of every resident of the United States. If Mr. Nader's efforts give us George W. Bush as president, we will suffer profoundly in ways every Democrat is aware of.</p>

        <p>The bottom line is that Mr. Nader is asking us to suffer for four years in order to promote his program. This has made the most responsible figure on the political scene into its central villain.</p>
