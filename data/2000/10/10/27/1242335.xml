        <p>On the subway, their heads hung forward like so many wilted flowers, bobbing with the movement of the train. Around the office, their eyes were red and their coffee cups were filled to the rim. When the alarm goes off, many will still have smacked the snooze button a few extra times this morning.</p>
        <p>In the city that never sleeps, baseball fans spent this Subway Series in dire need of a nap.</p>
        <p>On one thing almost all Mets and Yankee fans did agree: the World Series games started too late, so they were all worn down by the almost-nightly vigils held in front of their television sets. Every game ended close to -- or well -- after midnight, and some even commenced later than the advertised 8 p.m. starting time to accommodate riveting pregame moments like fancy player introductions, ceremonial pitches and antics with a bald eagle.</p>
        <p>And the games, because of commercials, pitching changes and seemingly endless at-bats, lasted on average about an hour longer than the games of the last Subway Series in 1956.</p>
        <p>Last night the Yankees clinched the Series in the fifth game, winning 4-2.</p>
        <p>Some fans, like Dr. Gary Raize, sneaked in a bit of shut-eye at work -- napping between his hospital rounds. Maida Jones and her husband employed a strategy of default -- taking turns cat-napping toward the end of the games, and bringing each other up to speed as they went along. And plenty were like James Barnwell, who nodded out over the keyboard in his first-period typing class at New Utrecht High School in Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>Of course, New Yorkers are not the sort of people who are afraid of the dark. While they don't start dinner at 11 p.m. like, say, inhabitants of Madrid, the night is never empty of citizens here. Nightclubs hop until all hours, one is never far from an all-night pharmacy, and just try to get a seat at 1 a.m. on the L train.</p>
        <p>But the World Series forced a disparate, and often early-rising, set of residents into staying up way past their bedtime far too many nights.  From postal workers who start at 6 a.m. to the men and women who run the early shift at diners to the people who are responsible for the early morning call notes on Wall Street -- all wound up past their limit.</p>
        <p>''It's murder,'' said Robert Carmona, 25, who delivers Snapple between 6 a.m. and about 3 p.m. daily. ''I've got to get up at 5 a.m. for work.'' Monday morning almost did him in. ''I stood up and felt sore. I got to work a half-hour late. I almost called in sick.''</p>
        <p>While the fans at home certainly suffered, they did so in the comfort of an easy chair. For those who went to the games, the pain was more acute. No one over 10 could catnap in the stands, and then there was the parking lot mania or subway hell to endure after the game.</p>
        <p>Dr. Raize, who practices in Scarsdale, has gone to every single matchup with his wife, Debbie, as they are season tickets holders for both teams. Sneaking his between-rounds naps is the only way he gets by. ''I wouldn't want to put any patients in jeopardy,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Philip Barber, a lawyer in Manhattan and father of three, has almost hit the wall. Each night, he has either gone to the games or watched them on television, and then proceeded to watch the post-game coverage on ESPN.</p>
        <p>''I am exhausted, worn out,'' said Mr. Barber. ''It hit me yesterday afternoon. I think people are dragging all over the city more because they are emotionally drained.''</p>
        <p>When their team won, the adrenaline rush got fans through; when they lost, fans felt more tired.</p>
        <p>David Phillips, a process server, watched the Mets win Game 3 of the World Series Tuesday night and then had to wake up by 5 a.m. to stake out a house in Staten Island. ''I'm a little more grumpy than the other days because the Yankees lost,'' Mr. Phillips said on Wednesday. ''I'm drinking more coffee and a lot more Pepsi.''</p>
        <p>Could people have been more exhausted? In fact, they could have, if they were also Jets fans. Seth Kleinrock, an orthodontist in Hewlett, Long Island, shares Mets and Jets tickets with a cousin. With the Jets playing Monday night, the only break in the Series, he was in a sports arena every night, and barely clocked four hours of sleep. ''I think because of the exhilaration, it doesn't affect me,'' he said. He said he was never late for work.</p>
        <p>His receptionist, Patty Fabris, saw it a little differently. ''He is freaked out,'' she said. ''He was late two days in a row, and he is never late.''</p>
        <p>Indeed it is common for the sleep-deprived to never quite come to terms with their condition. ''Most Americans are in denial anyway about how tired they are,'' said Gary Zammit, who runs St. Luke's-Roosevelt's Sleep Disorders Institute in Manhattan. ''But for so many fans this does represent a stress on their sleep-wake schedule. Between staying up late, falling asleep in front of the television, commuting to work in an impaired state, all this can result in risks.''</p>
        <p>The people most vulnerable to on-the-job errors or random calamities are those who started off too tired, he said. He added, however: ''There are few times in life when accumulating a little bit of sleep loss is worth it. This is one of them.''</p>
        <p>That is not to say that people were not bitter about it. The World Series games started late because Major League Baseball and television executives wanted to attract viewers in other time zones. The problem was, other cities did not tune in the way that Fox Sports had hoped, and New Yorkers were left feeling like their needs didn't count.</p>
        <p>''People here are barely able to keep their eyes open and the ratings outside of the New York area are tanking,'' said Jim Mandler, a public relations executive. ''I think it's a shame that Major League Baseball and the Fox Network have chosen to make the game least accommodating to the sports fans who are most interested in them, namely New York area residents.''</p>
        <p>Even Joe Torre, the manager of the Yankees, claimed to be confounded by the late starts to some games. In a news conference this week, he told reporters: ''It's terrible, it's nuts. I don't know how anybody can think anything good of that thing.''</p>
        <p>Children, of course, were the most deprived by the late nights, although many still chose to stay up. ''Actually, we've been surprised the students have not been absent,'' said Father Joseph Calise, rector or Cathedral Preparatory Seminary in Elmhurst, Queens. ''They've been tired but they've managed to get here.''</p>
        <p>Some people were so sleepy, they were actually dozing off before the games. Greg Biascochea, 44, a service technician, fell asleep Wednesday night during the pregame program. ''I woke up, I thought it was the first inning and it was the second inning,'' he said.</p>
        <p>To combat the somnolence, most people brought on the extra coffee. Few had better strategies.</p>
        <p>Bart Scotto, 74, said that ultimately, he could not keep his eyelids from drooping. ''At 11 p.m., I don't care who is winning; I want to got to sleep,'' he said as a smile lit his face. ''When I go to bed, I dream the Mets win 8 to 2.''</p>
