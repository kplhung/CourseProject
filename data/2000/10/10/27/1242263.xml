        <p>Congress and the Clinton administration are still wrangling over the final pieces of this year's federal budget, but by the time they are finished they could spend more than 40 percent of the surplus that the two presidential candidates are counting on to pay for their own proposals, analysts from both parties said today.</p>

        <p>Congress and the Clinton administration are still wrangling over the final pieces of this year's federal budget, but by the time they are finished they could spend more than 40 percent of the surplus that the two presidential candidates are counting on to pay for their own proposals, analysts from both parties said today.</p>
        <p>Without even taking up most of the big-ticket promises made by Vice President Al Gore or Gov. George W. Bush in their race for the White House, the Republican-controlled Congress and President Clinton are negotiating over tax cuts and spending increases that could use up $900 billion or more of the projected non-Social Security surplus of $2.17 trillion over the next decade, the analysts said.</p>
        <p>Should the two sides reach agreement on the main provisions, they would effectively reduce the surplus to $1.27 trillion or less.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush has proposed tax and spending programs totaling at least $1.9 trillion over 10 years. Mr. Gore's budget proposal totals at least $1.5 trillion.</p>
        <p>Because the economy has remained relatively strong, the surplus projection is likely to be increased again when it is updated early next year, helping the new president as he submits his first budget to Congress. Early estimates circulating on Capitol Hill are that the surplus projection could be revised upward by anywhere from a few hundred billion dollars to $1 trillion.</p>
        <p>The effects of this year's budget on the surplus could be higher or substantially lower than $900 billion depending on how a number of disputes are resolved in coming days.</p>
        <p>For example, Mr. Clinton threatened today to veto a $240 billion tax cut bill, although he backs or has accepted many of its main provisions, including increases in contribution limits for individual retirement accounts and 401(k) retirement savings plans and tax breaks for economic development in poor neighborhoods.</p>
        <p>Whatever the final figure, the allocation of such a big chunk of the surplus even before voters go to the polls suggests how quickly unimaginably large sums of money can come and go in Washington. And it is an indication that the agendas set out by Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush could prove overly ambitious even in this age of fiscal plenty.</p>
        <p>''There's a disconnect between what's going on on the campaign trail and what's going on in Washington,'' said Robert Bixby, executive director of the Concord Coalition, a bipartisan fiscal watchdog group . ''The surplus number the candidates are using is unrealistic.''</p>
        <p>The Bush campaign said it was confident that money would be available for its $1.3 trillion tax cut and other initiatives and that if elected Mr. Bush would end the profligacy of both parties in Congress.</p>
        <p>''Each of the past three years, despite Congress and the president agreeing to spend more money, the surplus surged as a result of stronger than anticipated economic growth,'' said Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for Mr. Bush. ''The best way to stop politicians from spending more money is to put George W. Bush in the White House.''</p>
        <p>Doug Hattaway, a spokesman for Mr. Gore, said he did not want to comment on a situation that was still hypothetical.</p>
        <p>On the campaign trail, the candidates continued to attack each other today over their budget proposals. Much of the back and forth was about a report by the American Academy of Actuaries concluding that Mr. Bush's budget and Social Security plans would leave the nation unable to pay off the $3.4 trillion national debt.</p>
        <p>Aides to Mr. Bush said the report's assumptions were flawed and stood by their estimate that their proposal would pay off the debt by 2016. Mr. Gore, who says his plan would pay off the debt in 2012, said the report was evidence that Mr. Bush's agenda was fiscally irresponsible.</p>
        <p>It is unclear how the budget showdown between Mr. Clinton and the Republican leadership on Capitol Hill will play out. Some members of both parties say they expect deadlock on some of the biggest pieces of outstanding business, including the $240 billion tax cut package and a proposed increase in the minimum wage. Other Democrats and Republicans say there is still room for a deal in which both parties get most of what they want before Election Day.</p>
        <p>Either way, it is clear that Congress and the administration are unfazed by the prospect of allocating a substantial portion of the surplus in a flurry of last-minute horse trading.</p>
        <p>Asked for his assessment of the new budget, G. William Hoagland, the Republican staff director of the Senate Budget Committee, said the tax and spending legislation as it  stood would reduce the surplus by $910 billion over 10 years.</p>
        <p>Asked separately for his assessment, Thomas S. Kahn, the staff director for Democrats on the House Budget Committee, came up with a slightly higher estimate. Mr. Bixby of the Concord Coalition put the figure at $700 billion to $800 billion.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hoagland said the increase in discretionary spending for this year to around $647 billion -- about $20 billion more than the Congressional Budget Office assumed in calculating its latest surplus projection -- would reduce the surplus by $310 billion over 10 years.</p>
        <p>That figure assumes that spending in future years will rise at no more than the rate of inflation, even though spending in recent years has risen at a rate far higher than inflation. Discretionary spending encompasses everything from fighter planes to Head Start. This year the two parties have agreed to big increases for popular programs like medical research at the National Institutes of Health as well as for myriad election-year ''pork'' projects in districts all over the country.</p>
        <p>An additional $295 billion of the surplus would go to two tax cuts: the $240 billion package that Republicans and Mr. Clinton were battling over today, and a separate $55 billion reduction in taxes on long distance telephone calls.</p>
        <p>Increased payments to Medicare would use up $74 billion of the surplus, Mr. Hoagland said, with another $44 billion going to increases in pension benefits to military retirees.</p>
        <p>The tax cuts and spending increases would come to $723 billion over 10 years, Mr. Hoagland said. But the surplus would actually be reduced by an additional $187 billion in interest costs, he said, bringing the total to $910 billion.</p>
        <p>That is because the surplus projections assume that all of the surplus will go to reducing the national debt; to the degree that the surplus goes to other purposes, the debt, and the interest on it, remain higher than assumed in the projections.</p>
