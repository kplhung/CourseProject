        <p>The Belgian-born French poet and writer Henri Michaux began to draw and paint in 1927, when he was 28. By then he was living in Paris, thrilled to have escaped Brussels, had been in print for five years and was becoming known for idiosyncratic writings full of invented words, fantasy narratives and stream-of-consciousness musings. In 1925, exposure to the work of Paul Klee and Max Ernst had alerted him to the possibility that Western painting might not be a dead end, condemned to simply repeat reality. (''As if there weren't already enough . . . of that awful reality,'' he later wrote.) He took up art in earnest in the mid-1930's, building on inspiration gained on a trip to Asia.</p>
        <p>In his 1972 poem ''Emergences/ Resurgences,'' which retraces his artistic odyssey, he summarized his response to Chinese calligraphy: ''Lines flung into the air, veering this way and that as if seized by the momentum of sudden inspiration, and not traced out in laborious, prosaic, exhaustive, bureaucratic fashion -- this is what spoke to me, seized me and carried me away.''</p>
        <p>Michaux, who died in Paris in 1984, is not exactly unknown on these shores -- the Beat poets discovered his travelogues of journeys both actual and chemical in the 1950's. But the translation of his immense output remains spotty, and his achievement as a visual artist has yet to gain a solid foothold despite a retrospective at the Guggenheim Museum in 1978. He has had only four gallery shows in New York: first at Cordier &amp; Eckstrom in 1963, and most recently at Edward Thorp in 1985.</p>
        <p>Now, another beachhead is being attempted and may become permanent. More than 200 of Michaux's works are or will soon be on view in Manhattan, half of them in an exemplary exhibition at the Drawing Center in SoHo. This show has been organized by Catherine de Zegher, director of the Drawing Center, and Florian Rodari, a Paris-based independent curator and art historian who organized the Drawing Center's recent exhibition of Victor Hugo's ink drawings. It is accompanied by a thick, essay-filled catalog and a separate publication of ''Emergences/ Resurgences'' in its first English translation, by Richard Sieburth, professor of French and comparative literature at New York University. Containing works dating from 1927 to the late 1970's, the show concentrates on the relatively abstract, calligraphic, black-and-white side of Michaux's output.</p>
        <p>At the Michael Werner Gallery on East 77th Street, a show of more than 60 works includes some wonderful early gouaches and Ernst-influenced frottage drawings (also early) as well as the 17 sheets of animated calligraphy for ''Mouvements,'' an illustrated poem that Michaux published in 1951. And next Friday the Zabriskie Gallery on East 57th Street will open a show of 39 watercolors and gouaches dating from the early 1930's to the early 1980's.</p>
        <p>You don't have to read much of Michaux to see that he subverted every form he worked in with a combination of wit, fantasy and above all, an acuteness of perception that seems hallucinatory whether he was on drugs or off. The time may be right for his skeptical, searching, adamantly intuitive yet overtly fierce sensibility, his finely textured mescaline drawings, his raucous inkscapes and his preening calligraphies.</p>
        <p>He was the quintessential antihero: the un-Matisse, the non-Picasso, the other-than-Pollock, even though he was dripping ink onto paper as early as 1950. He worked small and intimate, usually turning out drawings at a stupendous rate and priding himself on never revising them. He declined to join art movements. (The Surrealists would have embraced him, given his seeming affinity for automatism.) And he turned down medals. (The Grand Prix National des Lettres would corrupt him, he said.).</p>
        <p>Although erudite as a writer, he celebrated his lack of education in the visual arts. He painted ''to decondition myself,'' he wrote in ''Emergence/Resurgences,'' and to escape from language, which he vividly compared to ''an immense prefabricated house handed down from generation to generation, ever demanding our faithful residence, ever forcing us into ostentation.''</p>
        <p>Michaux spent his life on a quest for consciousness, self-knowledge and a modicum of inner peace in which art was more the means than the end. He assiduously mined the fault line between language and sign, and calligraphy and mark-making; between his inner and outer realities  and between what seems to have been a congenital distaste for life and an unusual passion to reveal the most basic impulses of mental and physical energy.</p>
        <p>He was certainly not without contradictions. He gave few interviews and avoided being photographed. But there are striking pictures of his handsome, somewhat Mandarin face by Giselle Freund and Claude Cahun, who appropriately portrayed him in double exposure, as writer and artist. Brassai photographed him several times, and Hans Bellmer turned out a fine-lined portrait drawing.</p>
        <p>He may have been born neurasthenic. In ''Some Information About 59 Years of Existence,'' a cryptic chronology of his life that he wrote in 1958, he paints a third-person picture of withdrawn hypersensitivity. ''He avoids life, games, amusements and variation. Food disgusts him. Odors, contacts. His marrow does not make blood. His blood isn't wild about oxygen.'' He is especially miserable during the five years, starting at age 7, spent in a ''poor, tough, cold'' boarding school in a Flemish village.</p>
        <p>After he returned to his family in Brussels and a Jesuit school, a series of formative shocks stimulated an appetite for life and knowledge. At 15, the ''shock'' of French composition opened him to writing; then came the discovery of his preference for Chinese characters and for insects, which, as he later wrote, he would ''examine at length under a magnifying glass from which he was never separated.'' At 21, after his parents withdrew financial support because he had dropped out of medical school, he seems to have found his first happiness during several months in the merchant marine: ''What I know, what is mine, is the indefinite sea.'' Back in Brussels, reading Lautreamont's ''Chants de Maldoror'' is another ''shock . . . which soon brings on the long-forgotten need to write.''</p>
        <p>Despite the inherent spareness and wholeness of Michaux's art, all these experiences seem present in his work: the medical and the nautical as well as the linguistic and the Asian. The teeming surfaces of the mescaline drawings, visible in a hefty cluster at the Drawing Center but also represented at Werner, are full of quiet oceanic rhythms. Made in ink so finely stippled you may at first think you are looking at a grainy charcoal or some kind of rubbing, their patterns can seem tantric, vertebral, cellular, architectural or at times, dunelike in the manner of early Mondrian. At Werner the looping lines and radiant colors of the gouache drawings conjure the ocean's floor, jellyfish, the human body. Back at the Drawing Center, one can watch language disintegrate into always suggestive marks, beginning with the lexical scribblings of ''Alphabet'' and ''Narration'' of 1927, and then resurface in a series of bluntly cursive-like scrawls from the late 1970's.</p>
        <p>Nearly everything Michaux touched seems propelled by a desire to escape language and simultaneously reconstitute it in a new form, one that is pulsing with life, open to interpretation and universally accessible. Sometimes that life can be startlingly explicit. The ''Mouvements'' calligraphies at Werner can bring to mind Daumier's caricatures: nearly every one seems to depict some vaguely familiar, more or less Rabelaisian citizen of Paris. At the Drawing Center most of the drawings have some figural or landscape reference (or both), while others resemble musical staffs or stanzas of writing. In this regard Michaux was right in step with postwar European contemporaries like Giacometti, Wols, Fautrier and Dubuffet, whose work also always seems to teeter between pure matter and signification.</p>
        <p>The larger works from the 1950's and 60's that Michaux himself called ''Batailles,'' or ''Battles,'' suggest skirmishing troops and exploding bodies, echoing the mock violence of some of his writings. Two especially beautiful ink drawings (one with touches of pink gouache) are laid on in horizontal scriptlike lines that also evoke geological strata and the early biomorphic gouaches of Barnett Newman and Mark Rothko. Several other works imply vast Serengetis scattered with herds of animals, which Michaux loved. Among the show's last drawings is one that suggests the images of bison at Lascaux.</p>
        <p>Illuminating as they are, these shows are not definitive. A catalog of a 1998 exhibition at the Neue Galerie in Graz, Austria, suggests that one devoted exclusively to the mescaline drawings should be next. But they make it clear that within the tradition of the modern artist-writer, or writer-artist, that includes Antonin Artaud, Brion Gysin and William Burroughs, Michaux brought an unusal balance and integration to the two pursuits. His peculiarly self-revealing, self-effacing art also has astounding range and historical reach, from the silences of Redon and Seurat to the Situationist concept of drifting and the graphic outbursts of Louise Bourgeois, Cy Twombly and the German Neo-Expressionists. Americans should not lose sight of it again.</p>
        <p>''Untitled Passages by Henri Michaux'' is at the Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, near Grand Street, SoHo, (212) 219-2166, through Dec. 20. ''Henri Michaux: Works on Paper'' is at Michael Werner, 4 East 77th Street, Manhattan, (212) 988-1623, through Nov. 25.</p>
