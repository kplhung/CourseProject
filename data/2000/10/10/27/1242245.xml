        <p>Gary C. Wendt, the chief executive of Conseco Inc., the deeply troubled insurance and finance company, paced slowly in a gray-carpeted conference room at his company's sprawling headquarters here, speaking to 20 of his top executives gathered together for the first time.</p>
        <p>''Make no mistake,'' he said. ''You're going to have someone in charge.''</p>
        <p>That is a big change from the way Conseco was run by its founder, Stephen C. Hilbert, who resigned in late April as Conseco Finance -- his latest acquisition and one of the company's biggest units -- began to list perilously in a rough sea of rising corporate debt and customer defaults. Mr. Hilbert, who was as flamboyant and expansive as Mr. Wendt is blunt and impatient, was one to delegate. Mr. Wendt is hands-on.</p>
        <p>''I want direct contact with all the businesses,'' he told his top executives in that first meeting.</p>
        <p>As the executives worked their way through the details of reorganizing the company, discussing inevitable layoffs and other cost-cutting, none of them betrayed any doubt that Conseco would survive. And, Mr. Wendt insisted, in one of several conversations over three days in Indiana and New York, ''It ain't going to crash.''</p>
        <p>But many people outside the company are skeptical. Edward A. Spehar of Merrill Lynch, once a fan of Conseco, now is cautious about its prospects. Colin Devine of Salomon Smith Barney, who has been a persistent critic of Conseco, takes an even stronger position.</p>
        <p>''They're not making any money at Conseco Finance, and they're not making any money on their insurance operations,'' he said. ''So, they've got a franchise with really nothing there.''</p>
        <p>Earnings have been declining for several quarters and one-time charges in the second quarter contributed to a loss of $405 million.</p>
        <p>''They may pull through,'' said Patrick Finnegan, a senior vice president at Moody's Investors Service, ''but they face substantial obstacles.''</p>
        <p>[On Thursday, the company reported a net loss of $489.5 million for the third quarter, most of it beacuse of further writeoffs of $488.5 million. That compared with a profit of $155.6 million a year earlier. The company had a net operating loss of $63.7 million but it said its net income from continuing operations was $49.2 million.]</p>
        <p>Through a string of acquisitions, Conseco has become one of the country's largest life and health insurance companies. Conseco Finance, which Mr. Hilbert bought two years ago in hopes of achieving faster growth than is customary in insurance, is the leader in mobile home lending and a major player in consumer loans to high-risk customers. In both insurance and finance, Conseco caters to people earning $25,000 to $75,000 a year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wendt, who became a Wall Street star as he built GE Capital into General Electric's biggest and most profitable subsidiary, says he thinks he can eventually turn a good profit on most of the insurance operations. But he hopes to sell off Conseco's small traditional health care business as well as several money-losing or low-margin units of the finance company, formerly known as Green Tree Financial.</p>
        <p>He says he also wants to get rid of some exotic investments like the $225 million stake in the Argosy Casino and Hotel, a paddle-wheel steamer out of Lawrenceburg, Ind., and a 17 percent share in Tritel, a wireless phone company whose value has fluctuated wildly.</p>
        <p>While Conseco's ailing stock nearly doubled to a little more than $11 when Mr. Wendt's appointment was announced on June 30th, it has been hovering lately at $5 to $7 a share. ''The market is saying it is neither convinced that Gary will be successful nor convinced that he won't be successful,'' said the chief executive of a rival insurance company.</p>
        <p>One company that owns several million dollars worth of Conseco bonds said privately that it was so worried that Conseco would default on a $131 million bond payment that is due in December that it was selling out now -- just weeks before maturity -- at a loss.</p>
        <p>By now, Mr. Wendt said, he expected Conseco's stock would be climbing. He thought Wall Street would respond more positively to his plan to convert Conseco Finance to a cash producer rather than a cash drain  and to his success in persuading more than 25 banks not to foreclose on $1.2 billion in loans last month.</p>
        <p>''Unfortunately,'' Mr. Wendt said, ''this company developed a bad reputation, and rebuilding its reputation is going to take a little longer than I thought.''</p>
        <p>Not all the news has been bad. During the summer the rating agencies dropped Conseco's standings a couple of notches -- making it harder for agents to sell insurance, leading some customers to cash in their policies and raising the cost of borrowing. But in response to the renegotiation of the debt, A.M. Best, which specializes in insurance, shifted its outlook to ''positive'' from ''under review, developing'' -- a neutral stance.</p>
        <p>''We wouldn't have changed the outlook if we felt there wasn't a good chance he could turn the enterprise around,'' said Larry Mayewski, a senior vice president at A.M. Best.</p>
        <p>Moody's, however, was not impressed with the debt renegotiation. Figuring the banks would be as eager as Conseco to avoid default, Moody's assumed that the refinancing would go through and factored that into their earlier rating of the company's bonds, well into the junk-bond zone. Moody's also rates most of Conseco's insurance companies far below the market leaders.</p>
        <p>So important are ratings to a company like Conseco, that a condition of the loan extension was that it achieve an upgrade from A. M. Best of at least one notch.</p>
        <p>Now that he has dodged foreclosure, Mr. Wendt, 58, is turning to another of the specialities that inspired the Conseco board to give him a five-year pay package that could be worth at least $100 million. That is hard-nosed management, learned at the right hand of John F. Welch Jr., the chief executive of General Electric. In 21 years, Mr. Wendt led the transformation of GE Capital from a small unit into the parent company's biggest moneymaker. Two years ago, he resigned after a public and messy divorce, and some friction with Mr. Welch. Mr. Wendt never explained his departure and passed up another opportunity to do so for this article.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wendt received a $45 million signing bonus that some critics interpreted as a sign of desperation on the part of Conseco's board and as a neutralizer of any personal risk. But Mr. Wendt and Conseco board members said the $45 million simply replaced money he lost in breaking his noncompete agreement with G.E. The balance of his pay package is tied to stock-related benchmarks. ''If he makes his $100 million, we're all going to be very happy,'' said John M. Mutz, a Conseco director.</p>
        <p>In the meeting earlier this month with his top executives, Mr. Wendt focused on eliminating the centralized support services that had been the hallmark of Conseco as a merger machine that averaged nearly an acquisition a year over two decades. Now Mr. Wendt is setting out to make each of the company's units largely self-sustaining.</p>
        <p>In the Hilbert era, there had been two layers of senior managers between the operating units and the chief executive. ''I'm eliminating both of them and having them directly report to me,'' Mr. Wendt said. ''You've got to be with your people every day to get a sense of what's going on.''</p>
        <p>As Mr. Wendt plunges into day-to-day tasks, he must overcome the legacy of Mr. Hilbert, a former encyclopedia salesman who drove a jet-black Ferrari and liked hobnobbing at the owners' paddock at thoroughbred race tracks. Mr. Hilbert was a deal maker who made money by buying companies cheap and then cutting costs to the bone. As the price of Conseco's stock soared to nearly $58 in April of 1998, he was repeatedly accused of aggressive accounting.</p>
        <p>''Steve was not terribly involved in running the businesses,'' said Richard H. Kremer, Conseco's head of human resources who studied the company as a consultant during Mr. Hilbert's tenure. ''The businesses pretty much operated on their own.''</p>
        <p>Like Mr. Welch, his G.E. mentor, Mr. Wendt is all business. He likes short meetings. Sometimes 30 seconds will do. One recent morning he strode into a senior executive's office. ''What's this?'' he said, shoving some papers forward. He got his answer and left. No hellos, no goodbyes.</p>
        <p>In less than 15 minutes one afternoon, Mr. Wendt heard from a delegation he had sent to India, signed off on their plan to eliminate thousands of back-office jobs in the United States, appointed a project leader and laid out his marching orders. Then, with a pistol-shot clap of his hands, he was off to other things. Mr. Wendt keeps Mr. Hilbert's old SubZero refrigerator stocked with decaffeinated Diet Coke. And most days he gobbles down lunch at his desk.</p>
        <p>As he has been selling off assets, Mr. Wendt says he has sometimes been getting up to 15 percent more than expected. But the analysts and rating agencies worry that Conseco may not be able to get a good price for its investments in the gambling boat and Tritel. The company has entered arbitration on the sale of the casino with the majority owners. Conseco listed the value of Tritel at $500 million as recently as September. [The wireless company's stock was trading at $9.94 on Thursday, giving Conseco's 22.9 million shares a value of $228 million.] One solution for Mr. Wendt is to find an investor to put up several hundred million so that Conseco can avoid selling at fire-sale prices. Finding an angel, some analysts say, is not out of the question.</p>
        <p>Another concern is Conseco's $3.9 billion in good will, a legacy from its many acquisitions that accounts for nearly 80 percent of the company's $4.9 billion in equity. Deteriorating values in the acquisitions could lead to a write-down that would increase Conseco's ratio of debt-to-capital, which is already well above average.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wendt wears monogrammed shirts and gold cuff links and is obviously no stranger to wealth. But the lavish executive suite here that Mr. Hilbert decorated with gilded antiques, marble columns and elaborate old school European paintings makes his skin crawl. The art and antiques are soon to be sold. And Mr. Wendt is almost certain to get rid of the Conseco Air Force, a fleet of five corporate jets plus a helicopter, and to shut down the company's 27th floor offices on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, overlooking a corner of Central Park and Grand Army Plaza.</p>
        <p>From Conseco's board, to the company's toughest critics, Mr. Wendt appears to be, as Mr. Devine of Salomon Smith Barney puts it, ''the best guy for this job.'' But the question is whether anyone can restore Conseco to its old stature.</p>
        <p>''He's competing against all these major players,'' Mr. Devine said. ''It's not so much, Is Conseco viable from a solvency perspective? But is it viable from a business perspective? Can it ever become the major player it was?''</p>
