        <p>For four years the casino owner Stephen A. Wynn has been the most closely watched buyer of fine art at auction. His $285 million investment in masterpieces by artists including Degas, van Gogh, Picasso and Matisse filled the Bellagio Gallery of Fine Art, Mr. Wynn's mini-museum in Las Vegas. Some of the works were purchased by the Bellagio hotel and casino; Mr. Wynn bought others back from the casino and rented them to the gallery.</p>
        <p>But after MGM Grand Inc. bought Mirage Resorts for $4.4 billion in March, the art collection became the first asset the new owners decided to dispose of. In June MGM Grand sold 11 paintings for about $124 million.</p>
        <p>Kathleen Clewell, director of the Bellagio Gallery of Fine Art, said the gallery was now like a philanthropic kunsthalle, a museum without its own collection. The gallery is currently showing 26 works from the Phillips Collection in Washington. The net profit from that exhibition (gallery admission is $12) will go to the Phillips.</p>
        <p>Those 11 works sold in June weren't the Bellagio's only art holdings. Sotheby's is to auction four of its paintings as part of a sale of Impressionist and modern art on Nov. 9. And on Jan. 26 Christie's is to auction an important Rembrandt that also hung on the walls of the Bellagio.</p>
        <p>Why not sell everything at the same auction house? Because Sotheby's sold that Rembrandt, which it called ''Portrait of a Bearded Man in a Red Coat,'' for $9 million just two years ago. Now Christie's is doing everything it can to reinvent the work, even changing its title to ''Gentleman in a Red Doublet,'' and it has estimated that the work will sell for $6 million to $8 million.</p>
        <p>The Rembrandt is one of two old master paintings from the Bellagio. The other, a Rubens, was also bought at Sotheby's in 1998 and was sold privately to a New Jersey collector.</p>
        <p>Dealers who have worked with Mr. Wynn say that he is still buying art. (His office said he was traveling and could not be reached for comment.)  The Rembrandt, dated 1633, depicts an anonymous sitter, possibly a soldier, wearing a bright red jacket with a white collar. ''Normally men wore black,'' said Anthony Crichton-Stuart, who heads Christie's department of old master paintings in New York. ''Therefore it has been hypothesized that he was possibly a military man, either a foreigner or a Dutchman.''</p>
        <p>The portrait, painted just after Rembrandt moved to Amsterdam,  eventually reached the collection of Philip John Miles, an early-19th-century British collector. In 1884 Christie's sold the bulk of his collection, which included major works by Domenichino, Raphael, Murillo and Rubens.</p>
        <p>Two years ago, Mr. Crichton-Stuart said, 11 people tried to buy the Rembrandt when it was offered at Sotheby's. ''The market is stronger than it was two years ago, with a wider pool of bidders,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''Gentleman in a Red Doublet'' isn't the only Rembrandt Christie's is selling. At a London sale in December it is to auction his ''Portrait of a Lady, Aged 62,'' from the collection of Baroness Batsheva de Rothschild. That work, painted in Amsterdam a year earlier, depicts an anonymous woman in black with a white collar and cap. It is expected to sell for $5.6 million to $8.4 million.</p>
        <p>Asked which painting he thought would sell for a higher price, the one from the Bellagio or the one with a Rothschild provenance, Mr. Crichton-Stuart declined to speculate.</p>
        <p>Both Rembrandts can be seen at Christie's in New York through Wednesday and will then travel to Los Angeles, where they will be on view at its offices from Nov. 3 to 7.</p>
        <p>Russian Pardner</p>
        <p>The extraordinary wealth of art and objects from Russia's national collections have long been the envy of American museums. In June the Hermitage in St. Petersburg and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York signed an agreement on a long-term partnership that includes sharing collections, organizing joint exhibitions and developing a worldwide network of museums. Now the Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts in Moscow and the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, have announced a long-term collaboration.</p>
        <p>After a year and a half of discussions the two institutions have agreed on a program that involves the exchange of exhibitions, long-term loans of individual works, the first English-language editions of the Pushkin Museum's catalogs, and joint educational initiatives.</p>
        <p>Next year about 200 pieces from the Houston museum's Glassell Collection of African gold will be the first works exchanged. They will travel to the Pushkin for its first exhibition of African art. Then, in December 2002, ''Masterworks of French Painting From the State Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts'' will come to Houston. Philip Morris will sponsor the exhibition of 76 paintings from the Pushkin, from the 17th century to the 20th.</p>
        <p>''I keep pinching myself when I think about this exhibition,'' said Peter C. Marzio, director of the Houston museum. ''Fifty-five of these works have never been seen in the U.S. before.'' Mr. Marzio said that the two museums would work together on a other shows bringing American art to the Pushkin for the first time. They also plan staff exchanges in areas like conservation, education and development.</p>
        <p>''The Pushkin also has a nascent organization here that's a Friends of the Pushkin,'' Mr. Marzio said. ''We want to help them with this kind of development. They certainly have the goods. What they don't have is cash.''</p>
        <p>Update Your Rolodex</p>
        <p>After two years of reflection, the Walters Art Gallery in Baltimore has changed its name to the Walters Art Museum. The announcement comes a year before the reopening of its Center Street building, which has closed for renovations since the fall of 1998.</p>
        <p>''We did focus groups and kept hearing people were confused by our name,'' said Ann Wilson, director of marketing and communications at the Walters. ''A couple from New York who came here said: 'There's a gallery on every street corner in Manhattan. We almost passed you by.' This is a much clearer expression of our mission.''</p>
        <p>''We're concerned with people making a first contact with us,'' she added. ''They're our future.''</p>
