        <p>EUROPE</p>
        <p>GERMANY: BID TO BAN RIGHTIST PARTY -- Interior ministers from the 16 federal states voted to back a government bid to ban the far-right National Democratic Party. Hesse and Saarland, both governed by the conservative Christian Democrats, abstained, saying that they were not convinced that the party was threatening the existence of the republic and that bans had proved ineffective in the past. The ministers said they were sending a ''clear signal'' that far-right extremism was unacceptable.</p>

        <p>SCOTLAND: NEW LEADER -- The Scottish Labor leader, Henry McLeish, 52, was elected first minister of Scotland's Parliament, replacing Donald Dewar, 63, who died on Oct. 11. He won with 68 votes, followed by John Swinney, leader of the Scottish Nationalists, with 33, and the Tory leader David McLetchie with 19. The Liberal Democrats, who are in coalition with Labor, did not run a candidate of their own.</p>

        <p>NORTHERN IRELAND: WEAPONS TEST PASSED Monitors who made a second inspection of Irish Republican Army weapons as part of the peace effort said the arms had not been used since last examined in June. ''We plan to reinspect the arms dumps on a regular basis and to ensure that the weapons remain secure,'' said the observers, Martti Ahtisaari of Finland and Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa, in a report. The inspection coincided with Prime Minister Tony Blair's visit to bolster support for the 1998 Good Friday accord.</p>

        <p>BRITAIN: YOUTHFUL KILLERS ELIGIBLE FOR PAROLE -- The youths who killed James Bulger, a 2-year-old Liverpool boy, in 1993, will be eligible for parole in February, the lord chief justice, Lord Woolf, ruled. He said the boys, Robert Thompson and Jon Venables, now 18, had done all to redeem themselves, though their crime remained horrendous. James's mother, Denise Fergus, 33, expressed disgust and shock.</p>

        <p>FRANCE: NEW PARIS AIRPORT -- Preliminary approval has been given for a third major airport in the Paris area, government officials announced. The new airport is intended to relieve the heavy traffic at Charles de Gaulle airport, northwest of the city, and Orly, to the south. No location has been chosen yet, but a detailed plan is expected next summer.</p>

        <p>SPAIN: ANTI-E.T.A. GROUP GETS PRIZE -- A pacifist group, Basta Ya!, which campaigns against the Basque separatist group E.T.A., won the Sakharov human rights prize, given by the European Parliament and named for Andrei D. Sakharov, the Soviet dissident who died in 1989. Founded last year, Basta Ya!, or That's Enough!, organizes protests against E.T.A., which has killed almost 800 people in 32 years.</p>

        <p>VENEZUELA: ANGER OVER U.S. SHIPS -- Accusing the United States of ''contravening international law,'' the Foreign Ministry has formally protested what it describes as incursions into Venezuela's waters this month by two U.S. Coast Guard vessels, the Reliance and the Gentian. The U.S. Embassy has denied the accusation, saying that both ships, which are used in counternarcotics operations, were ''operating in accordance with international maritime law.''

        <p>VENEZUELA: 2 PROTEST LABOR REFERENDUM -- Two National Electoral Council officials have resigned to protest a national referendum scheduled for Dec. 3 that would abolish the country's principal labor confederation, which has criticized President Hugo Chavez, and replace it with a government-controlled group. The officials described the vote as illegal and unconstitutional state ''interference'' in the right of association, ''motivated by partisan interests.''  Larry Rohter (NYT)</p>
        <p>CANADA: HOW TO REDUCE TAXES -- In a political bidding war, the Tory leader Joe Clark has proposed abolishing the capital gains tax and raising personal exemptions so that 10 percent of the poorest taxpayers would no longer pay income tax. The proposal comes after Finance Minister Paul Martin, a Liberal, announced a tax plan, partly in response to a program pushed by the opposition Canadian Alliance. A national vote is set for Nov. 27.</p>

        <p>CHINA: FALUN GONG RALLY -- Members of the outlawed Falun Gong movement staged a brief but large protest on Tiananmen Square, scattering leaflets and raising banners before the police violently ended the demonstration. Plainclothes policemen in groups of 10 or more pounced on small bands of Falun Gong members spread throughout the plaza in central Beijing.</p>

        <p>JAPAN: KEY POLITICIAN QUITS -- Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori's closest ally resigned early today after a string of embarrassments turned him into a liability for the Liberal Democratic Party. Hidenao Nakagawa, who as chief cabinet secretary was the government's leading spokesman, was most recently battling accusations linking him to the extreme right wing. Previously, a weekly  printed a picture of him naked, supposedly taken by a former mistress, who said that he had paid for her abortion and that he took drugs. Mr. Nakagawa has denied the charges.</p>

        <p>PHILIPPINES: LEADER'S VOW -- President Joseph Estrada said he would step down if it were proved that he took bribes from illegal gambling syndicates, but he insisted on his innocence. Mr. Estrada said those calling for his resignation or impeachment had judged him without hearing his side. ''I will answer the charges at the proper time, and if I am proven a liar, if it is proven that I accepted a single centavo from illegal gambling or took it from the national coffers, I shall not stay a single minute longer in my position as your president,'' he said.</p>

        <p>ZIMBABWE: EX-LEADERS UNDER THREAT -- President Robert Mugabe said his government would try Ian D. Smith and other white former leaders for their roles in suppressing the movement that eventually won majority rule for the country's black population, according to reports from the capital, Harare. Mr. Mugabe, who often makes threats but fails to act on them, said the white minority was undermining a longstanding policy of reconciliation, leaving the state no choice but to shift its position.</p>
