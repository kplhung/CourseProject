        <p>A selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy opera, classical music and dance events this weekend in the New York metropolitan region.</p>
        <p>Opera</p>
        <p>''LA BOHEME,'' Metropolitan Opera. Yet again, all Paris descends on the Latin Quarter in Act II of Puccini's opera, and viewers will get their fill. Listeners are another matter. In Franco Zeffirelli's extravaganza of a production, from 1981, it is hard for any singer of less than Pavarottian amplitude in both voice and physique even to register, let alone make a vivid impression. Cristina Gallardo-Domas and Marcello Giordani try here in the lead roles. Marco Armiliato is back in the pit, where he fared well last year. Tomorrow  night at 8, Metropolitan Opera House, (212) 362-6000. Standing room tickets only at $12 and $16 (James R. Oestreich).</p>

        <p>A selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy opera, classical music and dance events this weekend in the New York metropolitan region.</p>
        <p>Opera</p>
        <p>''LA BOHEME,'' Metropolitan Opera. Yet again, all Paris descends on the Latin Quarter in Act II of Puccini's opera, and viewers will get their fill. Listeners are another matter. In Franco Zeffirelli's extravaganza of a production, from 1981, it is hard for any singer of less than Pavarottian amplitude in both voice and physique even to register, let alone make a vivid impression. Cristina Gallardo-Domas and Marcello Giordani try here in the lead roles. Marco Armiliato is back in the pit, where he fared well last year. Tomorrow  night at 8, Metropolitan Opera House, (212) 362-6000. Standing room tickets only at $12 and $16 (James R. Oestreich).</p>
        <p>''FIDELIO.'' Beethoven's only opera, at turns heavenly and deeply flawed, comes to the Met in a new production by Jurgen Flimm. Mr. Flimm, as is his custom, sets the opera's deeply political and moral struggles in a modern prison yard. Karita Mattila is a marvelous Leonore. Ben Heppner is strong as Florestan. James Levine conducts. The Met's chorus is worth the trip. Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m. Metropolitan Opera House, (212) 362-6000. Tickets: $180 and standing room, $12 and $16 (Bernard Holland).</p>
        <p>''MADAMA BUTTERFLY,'' New York City Opera. Mark Lamos's production of Puccini's great work, introduced at the Glimmerglass Opera in 1997 and at the City Opera the next year, holds up well, offering a clean canvas for the compelling lighting design of Robert Wierzel. The performance mostly did justice to the production on opening night, but the lead singers have changed here, with Liping Zhang in the title role, David Corman as Pinkerton and John Hancock as Sharpless. Brent McMunn conducts. Tonight at 8 and Sunday at 1:30 p.m., New York State Theater, (212) 870-5570. Tickets: $25 to $98 (Oestreich).</p>
        <p>MET GALA CONCERT. The acclaimed and hugely popular mezzo-soprano Cecilia Bartoli makes her only appearance at the Metropolitan Opera this season on Sunday afternoon in a gala concert with the bass Bryn Terfel, who has been busy at the company singing the title role of ''Don Giovanni,'' and is in superb voice. The concert, with the Met Orchestra conducted by James Levine, will benefit the Met's Pension Fund, which is directed to the hard-working orchestra musicians and choristers who make so many nights at the house memorable. Sunday at 5 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, (212) 362-6000. Remaining tickets at $90, $150 and $250 (Anthony Tommasini).</p>
        <p>''LE NOZZE DI FIGARO.'' New York City Opera. This John Copley production has been in the New York City Opera's repertory for about a quarter of a century, but it is attractive and compact and does what a ''Figaro'' production should, which is to foster the sense of ensemble and precision comic timing upon which the work depends. The youthful, balanced cast includes Sari Gruber as Susanna, Dean Ely as Figaro, Paula Rasmussen as Cherubino and John Hancock as the Count and Cynthia Clayton as the Countess. Steuart Bedford conducts. Tomorrow night at 8, New York State Theater, (212) 870-5570. Tickets: $25 to $98 (Allan Kozinn).</p>
        <p>''LA TRAVIATA,'' New York City Opera. Here is something increasingly rare at the City Opera: a work from the center of the repertory in a fully conventional production, this one, of Verdi's opera, by Renata Scotto. The sets, offering a certain Zeffirellian sumptuousness on a small scale, require singers with a strong stage presence, and Mary Dunleavy certainly filled the bill in the title role on opening night. But she is replaced here by Virginia Grasso, and the other leads are also new -- Gerard Powers as Alfredo and Brian Davis as Giorgio Germont -- so you're largely on your own. Joseph Rescigno conducts. Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., New York State Theater, (212) 870-5570. Tickets: $25 to $98 (Oestreich).</p>
        <p>''IL TROVATORE,'' Amato Opera. This scrappy people's opera company on the Bowery brings back its successful production of Verdi's ''Trovatore'' this weekend, conducted by Anthony Amato. Tomorrow evening opening night is a gala event. Tickets cost $50 and include champagne, a gourmet buffet and dessert. The mood will be celebratory, but wistful too, since Sally Amato, the company's co-founder died just before the season opened. On  Sunday afternoon there will be a regular performance, less expensive and with no champagne. Tomorrow night at 7 and Sunday at 2:30 p.m., Amato Opera Theater, 319 Bowery,  East Village, (212) 228-8200. Tickets: $50 for the Saturday gala; $25 ($20 for the elderly and children under 12) for the Sunday matinee  (Tommasini).</p>
        <p>''TURANDOT.'' Metropolitan Opera. The soprano Jane Eaglen, in her only appearances at the Met this season, brings her power and vocal luster to the demanding title role in Puccini's ''Turandot.'' She can certainly soar over the orchestra and amassed chorus in the glittery imperial palace scene. But Ms. Eaglen lacks the temperament and volatility to make this character, an icy princess in ancient Peking with an obsessive hatred of men, credible. Also new to the cast, the soprano Angela Gheorghiu, with her dark-haired diminutive beauty and dusky, plaintive voice, makes a memorable Liu. The vibrant-voiced tenor Richard Margison remains as the Franco Zeffirelli production's Calaf. As on opening night, Marco Armiliato conducts a perplexingly shaky performance. Tonight at 8, Metropolitan Opera House, (212) 362-6000. Standing room tickets only at $12 and $16 (Tommasini).</p>
        <p>Classical Music</p>
        <p>ANONYMOUS 4. In Corpus Christi's valuable program Music Before 1800, this excellent quartet of women's voices looks back a millennium, bringing to life its new album for Harmonia Mundi France, ''1000: A Mass for the End of Time,'' which has already climbed high on the Billboard classical chart (No. 12, at last glance). This program of chant and polyphony for the feast of the Ascension is said to evidence the fears of the end of the world and the Last Judgment that many Christians felt as they prepared to enter the second millennium. Sunday at 4 p.m., Corpus Christi Church, 529 West 121st Street, (212) 666-9266. Tickets: $25; $20 for the elderly; $15 for students (Oestreich).</p>
        <p>BARD MUSIC FESTIVAL. This year's summer festival at Bard considered the most neglected of all the great composers: Beethoven. Beethoven? Neglected? Well, yes, given how rarely you get the chance to hear either of the two big choral-orchestral works on this program, both dating from the midday of his creative career: the oratorio ''Christ on the Mount of Olives'' and the Mass in C major. Leon Botstein conducts the American Symphony Orchestra with choir and soloists. Tomorrow night at 8, Alice Tully Hall, (212) 721-6500. Tickets: $30. (There is also a lecture at 2 p.m. and a chamber concert at 2:30 p.m.; chamber tickets, $20. There is also a $40 ticket for both performances (Paul Griffiths).</p>
        <p>BARGEMUSIC. There is no better place in New York City to experience chamber music with the proper intimacy than at the concerts presented by Bargemusic, the rewarding weekly series that takes place on an acoustically ideal and commodious barge in the shadow of the Brooklyn Bridge. The program presented tonight and Sunday afternoon offers Paul Ostrovsky (pianist), Mark Peskanov (violinist) and Suren Bagratuni (cellist) in works by Beethoven and Schubert, including one of Beethoven's less-played but greatest chamber works, the Trio No. 2 in E flat (Op. 70). Tomorrow night Mr. Peskanov is joined by Doris Stevenson (pianist) and Stephen Kates (cellist) for a program of works by Bach, Bruch and Schubert. Enjoy the music while taking in a spectacular view of Lower Manhattan. Tonight at 8, tomorrow night at 7:30 and Sunday at 4 p.m.; Fulton Ferry Landing, Brooklyn (718) 624-4061. Tickets: $27; $25 for the elderly; $15 for students. Tonight's performance will be broadcast live on WNYC-FM (93.9) (Tommasini).</p>
        <p>CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETY OF LINCOLN CENTER. A performance of the Schumann Piano Quintet featuring the eloquent pianist Helene Grimaud is the principal draw here. Also on the program, the cellist Gary Hoffman and Ms. Grimaud offer the Brahms Cello Sonata No. 1, and a quintet that includes Mr. Hoffman, the violinists Cho-Liang Lin and Ani Kavafian and the violists Paul Neubauer and Naoko Shimizu will perform the Mendelssohn String Quintet No. 2. Tonight at 8, Sunday at 5 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, (212) 875-5788. Tickets: $27.50 and $37.50 (Kozinn).</p>
        <p>MINNESOTA ORCHESTRA. The Minnesota Orchestra makes one of its regular trips to Carnegie Hall on Saturday night led by its music director Eiji Oue. The program offers youthful and uncharacteristically Romantic Webern (''Im Sommerwind''), the Mahler First Symphony and Mozart's liquid and lyrical Piano Concerto No. 23 in A. The pianist is the young Andreas Haefliger. Tomorrow night at 8, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; Tickets: $20 to $78 (Holland).</p>
        <p>NEW YORK CHAMBER SYMPHONY. Gerard Schwarz leads his orchestra in a concert with many attractions. Brahms's ''Haydn'' Variations should, at least in theory, sound both transparent and buoyant when played by a chamber orchestra, and there are is no doubt a fresh perspetive to be gained from Andy Stein's recasting of Schubert's F minor Fantasy (originally a piano duet) as a concerto. There are joys to be had from Dvorak's too infrequently played ''Czech'' Suite as well, but perhaps the most promising piece on the program is ''Fields of Vision,'' a new score by Daniel Brewbaker, a young composer whose works are typically thoughtful and fresh. Sunday at 2 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, (212) 721-6500. Tickets: $35 (Kozinn).</p>
        <p>NEW YORK NEW MUSIC ENSEMBLE. The Sonic Boom Festival continues with an  ''American Tapestry,'' a program trying to take account of some of the huge variety in American music of recent decades. Featured composers include Elliott Carter, the much lamented Jacob Druckman, Melinda Wagner, David Rakowski and Jonathan Dawe. Performances by this expert ensemble should be excellent. Tonight at 8, Great Hall, Cooper Union, Third Avenue at Seventh Street, East Village, (212) 279-4200. Tickets: $12; $6 for students and the elderly.(Griffiths).</p>
        <p>NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC. Colin Davis makes a welcome return to the New York Philharmonic conducting a program of early Schubert (the First Symphony), late Haydn (the Symphony No. 98) and a relative rarity (although not among those who play the instrument), the Mozart Bassoon Concerto. Judith LeClair steps out of the orchestra to do the solos. Tonight at 8, Avery Fisher Hall,  (212) 721-6500. Tickets: $38 to $80 (Holland).</p>
        <p>ORCHESTRA DA CAMERA ITALIANA. Salvatore Accardo, one of the top fiddlers of the day, evokes the ultimate violin virtuoso, Niccolo Paganini, playing his Fourth Concerto on one of the master's own violins, a Guarneri del Gesu known as the Cannon and owned by Paganini's native city, Genoa. Not only did Paganini mania rage through Europe in the early 19th century; so did Rossini mania, reaching even Schubert in Vienna and affecting his style. Mr. Accardo conducts Rossini's ''Italiana in Algeri'' Overture and Schubert's  ''Tragic'' Symphony to fill out the program. Sunday at 3 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, (212) 721-6500. Tickets: $25, $35 and $45 (Oestreich).</p>
        <p>PHILHARMONIA VIRTUOSI. This orchestra, founded and directed by Richard Kapp, typically offers a combination of standard repertory and less familiar pieces that have attracted Mr. Kapp's attention. This program is largely a tribute to the classical guitar, and includes two of the first concertos written for the instrument in modern times: Castelnuovo-Tedesco's bittersweet Concerto No. 1  and Ponce's ''Concierto del Sur.'' The soloist is Eliot Fisk, a performer with a powerhouse technique and a probing musical imagination. Tomorrow night at 7, Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212) 570-3949. Tickets: $25 (Kozinn).</p>
        <p>MELVYN TAN. One of the foremost practitioners of the early piano, Mr. Tan has been specially associated with Mozart. Here he duly plays a Mozart sonata, K.570 in B flat, but then he goes on to late Beethoven (Op.101) and the second book of Debussy's Preludes. The delicacy of his playing, in touch and color, should be a delight -- especially in an intimate concert room. Sunday at 5 p.m., Frick Collection, 1 East 70th Street, Manhattan, (212) 288-0700. Free tickets have already been distributed, but a waiting line for returns forms one-half hour before the performance (Griffiths).</p>
        <p>TEMPERA QUARTET. These young players, Finnish-born and trained at the Royal College of Music in London, come with the prestigious endorsements to perform in the Distinctive Debuts series presented by a consortium of leading concert halls. They start with an early quartet by Mozart (K.159 in B flat), then go on to Bartok's desperate and haunting Sixth Quartet and the murmuring ''Intimate Voices,'' by Sibelius. Tonight at 8, Weill Hall, (212) 247-7800. Tickets: $21 (Griffiths).</p>
        <p>Dance</p>
        <p>AMERICAN BALLET THEATER. They're back, in a weekend of new works and golden oldies. The new pieces are Christian Holder's ''Weren't We Fools?,'' danced to rarely heard music by Cole Porter (tonight, tomorrow and Sunday nights), and the Australian choreographer Natalie Weir's ''Jabula'' (tomorrow night). The oldies include George Balanchine's ''Prodigal Son'' with Angel Corella in the title role tonight and Ethan Stiefel dancing his first Prodigal Sunday afternoon, with Michele Wiles new as the Siren.

        <p>MARY ANTHONY DANCE THEATER. Mary Anthony has quietly influenced several generations of dancers and choreographers through her teaching and her own choreography.

        <p>ARTHUR AVILES TYPICAL THEATER. An 80-minute program called ''The Little Dance Concert That Could'' will include Arthur Aviles's new ''Trio,'' a choreographic collage that incorporates trains, planes and Merce Cunningham and Janet Jackson, set to music by Justin Rodriguez. Mr. Aviles, who draws inspiration from popular art and the concert dance he has performed, describes his new ''Bach Solo'' as having smooth lines and ''a clean round and square approach'' akin to ''taking a very deep breath and exhaling, creating a kind, considerate quietness.'' Tonight and tomorrow night at 7, Bronx Academy of Arts and Dance Theater, 841 Barretto Street, Hunts Point, (718) 842-5223. Tickets: $10 (Dunning).</p>
        <p>BALLET NACIONAL DE CARACAS. ''The Firebird'' flies into the tropics in a new version of the Stravinsky classic choreographed by Vicente Nebrada. The work is the featured attraction of a program of one-act ballets. Mr. Nebrada's retelling retains the familiar leading characters of Firebird, Prince, Princess and Magician. But the cast also includes dragonflies and iguanas. Sunday at 2 p.m., Brooklyn Center for the Performing Arts, Brooklyn College, Flatbush and Nostrand Avenues, Flatbush, (718) 951-4500. Tickets: $25 and $30; $23 and $28 for students and the elderly; $10 student ticket on day of performance (Jack Anderson).</p>
        <p>BULGARI. A company of musicians and dancers from Bulgaria evokes the sights and sounds of village life. The presentation brings together works from Bulgaria's six regions that reflect cultural influences of both Western Europe and Asia Minor. Tonight at 8, Symphony Space, Broadway at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400. Tickets: $21; $16 for members  (Anderson).</p>
        <p>ANITA CHENG AND HEATHER HARRINGTON. In her new ''Daybreak,'' the choreographer and video artist Anita Cheng explores the film-style frames inherent in gestures as well as the dichotomy between fragmentation and continuity in movement.

Tonight at 9; tomorrow night and Sunday night at 8. Merce Cunningham Studio, 55 Bethune Street, SoHo, (212) 924-0077. Tickets: $12 (Dunning).</p>
        <p>CLOUDGATE DANCE THEATER OF TAIWAN. Lin Hwai-min, who founded the Cloudgate Dance Theater of Taiwan in 1973, was an early proponent of choreography that blended traditional Asian theater techniques and Western dance. Mr. Lin is represented here by ''Nine Songs,'' a two-hour dance that features ancient ritual songs and an onstage lotus pond. Sunday at 5 p.m. New Jersey Performing Arts Center, 1 Center Street, Newark, (888) 466-5722. Tickets: $12 to $48 (Dunning).</p>

Tomorrow night  at 8, Brooklyn Arts Exchange, 421 Fifth Avenue, at Eighth Street, Park Slope, (718) 832-0018. Admission by donation (Dunning).</p>
        <p>GARTH FAGAN DANCE. Garth Fagan celebrates the 30th anniversary of his company with a new dance, called ''Trips and Trysts'' and set to music by Wynton Marsalis. It will be performed by Steve Humphrey, a much admired charter member of the troupe, and other veteran Faganites. Mr. Fagan, the choreographer of the Broadway musical ''Lion King,'' will also present signature works like ''Easter Freeway Processional'' and recent works like ''Woza,'' set to music by Lebo M, ''Lion King'' composer. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8; Sunday at 2 and 7:30 p.m. Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800. Tickets: $38  (Dunning).</p>
