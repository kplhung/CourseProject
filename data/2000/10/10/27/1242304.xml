        <p>The 1970's nostalgia trend is claiming another convert as Jordache Enterprises said it would bring back the original television commercial that introduced the Jordache brand of designer jeans.</p>

        <p>Michael Riego, vice president for advertising at Jordache in New York, said the revival of the spot would promote the introduction of Jordache Originals, a brand of women's jeans similar in cut and fit to the original Jordaches. The commercial may run again nationally, Mr. Riego said.</p>
