        <p>''GIORGIO ARMANI,'' Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500 (through Jan. 17). The Guggenheim has served up another plateau of urban history: a retrospective of the Milanese fashion designer Giorgio Armani. What it lacks in depth it makes up for with sparkle, and Robert Wilson's architectural transformation of the museum's rotunda may be the best yet. In an inverted version of a life class, instead of the undraped body, the show offers just the drapes. The mannequins have been pared down to the edges of the costumes, and they cluster in groups in the building's structural bays, spatial modules with the proportions of shop windows. Hours: Sundays through Wednesdays, 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays, 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission: $12; $8 students and the elderly (Herbert Muschamp).</p>

        <p>''GIORGIO ARMANI,'' Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500 (through Jan. 17). The Guggenheim has served up another plateau of urban history: a retrospective of the Milanese fashion designer Giorgio Armani. What it lacks in depth it makes up for with sparkle, and Robert Wilson's architectural transformation of the museum's rotunda may be the best yet. In an inverted version of a life class, instead of the undraped body, the show offers just the drapes. The mannequins have been pared down to the edges of the costumes, and they cluster in groups in the building's structural bays, spatial modules with the proportions of shop windows. Hours: Sundays through Wednesdays, 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays, 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission: $12; $8 students and the elderly (Herbert Muschamp).</p>
        <p>''A BRUSH WITH NATURE: THE GERE COLLECTION OF LANDSCAPE OIL SKETCHES,'' Frick Collection, 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700 (through Nov. 12). Most of the artists in this show -- English, French, Italian, German, Belgian and Scandinavian, from the 17th to the 19th centuries -- are barely known today. In their own age they did something quite offbeat: they left studios to paint outdoors, registering transient moments of light and atmosphere by sketching quickly in oil from nature. Until recently it was assumed that this plein-air approach, used to train hand and eye for more ambitious compositions, began with the Impressionists. Mostly painted in Rome and the surrounding countryside, the works capture such painterly events as the seamed face of a rock, the rush of water through a valley, the play of sunlight on a ruin, the quirky architecture of a building or a wall. Tune your eye to small when you look at this show, and you'll find it a treasure. Hours: Tuesdays through Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Sundays, 1 to 6 p.m. Admission: $7; $5 for students (over 10) and the elderly (Grace Glueck).</p>
        <p>* ''THE CHINESE PAINTER AS POET,'' China Institute Gallery, 125 East 65th Street, (212) 744-8181 (through Dec. 10.) In China, painting, poetry and calligraphy were the dream team of art: the ''three perfections,'' they were called. Any truly evolved person was adept at each, and discussion of any of them was framed in the same terms: rhythm, touch, tone, spiritual energy. This eloquent exhibition examines the three-way partnership through some four dozen paintings, several of them of the first rank, ranging in date from the Song dynasty (960-1279) through the 20th century. In many cases the artist has inscribed his own poem on the surface of his painting in what amounts to a virtuoso multimedia solo performance. Hours: Mondays through Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Tuesdays and Thursdays, until 8 p.m.; Sundays, 1 to 5 p.m. Admission: $3; $2 for students and the elderly (Holland Cotter).</p>
        <p>* ''THE EMBODIED IMAGE: CHINESE CALLIGRAPHY FROM THE JOHN B. ELLIOTT COLLECTION,'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Jan. 7). In China the written word has traditionally been the highest art form and a source of political and emotional power. To see that power in action, check out this grandly scaled exhibition, which brings together two superb calligraphy collections -- from Princeton University and the Met -- in the most comprehensive survey yet seen in these parts. The dozens of scrolls covered with hand-written words collectively radiate a kind of conversational buzz and suggest a richly varied cast of personalities: fastidious court functionaries, impulsive social agitators, unworldly monks, visionary poets. Together they offer an ice-breaking introduction to an art that to non-Chinese speakers can all too easily seem unapproachable. Hours: Sundays and Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 9 p.m. Admission: $10; $5 for students 12 and older and the elderly (Cotter).</p>
        <p>''AN ENGAGEMENT WITH FOLK ART: CYRIL I. NELSON'S GIFTS TO THE MUSEUM OF AMERICAN FOLK ART,'' 2 Lincoln Square, at West 66th Street, (212) 595-9533 (through Jan. 7). This show celebrates the largess of Mr. Nelson, a book editor and folk art collector, who has given 113 objects to the museum with the promise of more. The works, from the late-18th to the mid-20th centuries, cover the traditional areas of folk art -- portraits, landscapes, sculptures, painted and decorated furniture -- but the focus is on American needlework: quilts, coverlets, blankets and the like. Among the quilt spectaculars is the ''Samuel Steinberger Log Cabin Quilt, Courthouse Steps Variation,'' by a 19th-century immigrant. Painted furniture, too, shines in this show. The painting and sculpture pieces make a more modest impression, but over all, what's on view represents a refined, solid ensemble that is very visitable. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 11:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. Free (Glueck).</p>
        <p>''HIP-HOP NATION: ROOTS, RHYMES AND RAGE,'' Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000 (through Dec. 31). The complex cultural amalgam of music, poetry, break-dancing, art and fashion that is hip-hop poses a serious challenge to any art museum, but with the proper resources and curatorial expertise, it could have been done. Instead this show offers a partial outline of hip-hop history, conveyed by photographs, posters, magazine and album covers, memorabilia and monotonous expanses of clothes that make the show nearly indistinguishable from the gift shop. Garnished with graffiti art, it bypasses many other equally interesting connections to contemporary art. Because the show omits music videos, it manages to be virtually devoid of the sounds, words and moving bodies that are the essence of hip-hop. The results are a cross between a mall and a mausoleum. Hours: Wednesdays through Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. (until 11 p.m. on the first Saturday of each month); Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $4; $2 for students and the elderly (Roberta Smith).</p>
        <p>''IN THE PRESENCE OF SPIRITS: AFRICAN ART FROM THE NATIONAL MUSEUM OF ETHNOLOGY IN LISBON,'' Museum for African Art, 593 Broadway, near Prince Street, SoHo, (212) 966-1313 (through Dec. 31). The more than 140 objects on view relate to the secular and the supernatural in African culture: masks, power figures, dolls, decorated stools and chairs, pipes, posts and other artifacts. Outstanding is a group of initiation masks made from wood and more fragile materials like feathers, fabrics and barkcloth fibers. Ranging from fierce to benign in expression, they are giddily imaginative. Impressive, too, is a selection of dolls, important in the socialization of girls, from the Ambo people of southwestern Angola. The objects in the show were chosen for their high aesthetic value, and it doesn't disappoint. Hours: Tuesdays through Fridays, 10:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $5; $2.50 for children, students and the elderly; free on Sundays (Glueck).</p>
        <p>LEE KRASNER, Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000 (through Jan. 7). Despite its restless energy and moments of formal power and elegance, Lee Krasner's career in this economical retrospective looks more like one of tantalizing frustration than real fulfillment. In the 1950's and early 60's, Krasner painted splattery, ambitious Abstract Expressionist works, but they look indebted to other artists, Pollock and de Kooning mainly. Where she looks most herself is in collage; a set of large collages on canvas from the early 50's have raw density or explosive buoyancy. Collages made in the 1970's using 40-year-old charcoal drawings have a beautiful Cubistic elegance; they are the best works of her career. Hours and admission: See above (Ken Johnson).</p>
        <p>''MOROCCO: JEWS AND ART IN A MUSLIM LAND,'' Jewish Museum, Fifth Avenue at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200 (through Feb. 11). When Arab Muslims arrived in Morocco, Jews had already been living there for centuries, and the two cultures formed a cooperative and uneasy bond. Their relationship is explored in this exhibition, which offers a little bit of many things, mostly dating from the 19th and 20th centuries. In elaborate jewelry, shimmery textiles, liturgical objects and folk amulets, Jewish and Islamic ingredients often form a distinctive hybrid blend. A selection of European Orientalist paintings, by Delacroix among others, provide a firsthand outsider view of a once-vibrant interaction. Hours: Sundays through Thursdays, 11 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Tuesdays to 8 p.m. Admission: $8; $5.50 for students over 11 and the elderly (Cotter)</p>
        <p>''OPEN ENDS,'' Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400 (through Jan. 2). The third and final cycle of ''MOMA 2000,'' the year-and-a-half-long millennium-marking rethinking of the Modern's permanent collection, is off and running, with the first of three staggered floor-through sections in place. The dates covered are 1960 to the present, so there's some sense of how a bastion of modernism is dealing with a postmodern world. Pretty well, judging from recent acquisitions of work by Pipilotti Rist, Matthew Barney and Cai Guo-Qiang. The real interest is in smart theme shows that play with such contemporary fixations as childhood innocence and adult experience, and the blend of art, abjection and design. (The third-floor galleries open on Nov. 5.) Hours: Saturdays through Tuesdays and Thursdays, 10:30 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Fridays, 10:30 a.m. to 8:15 p.m. Admission: $10; $6.50, students and the elderly (Cotter).</p>
        <p>''PIERRE ET GILLES,'' New Museum of Contemporary Art, 583 Broadway, near Prince Street, SoHo, (212) 219-1222 (through Jan. 7). No history of postmodern photography, fashion photography, celebrity portraiture, record album covers or the highbrow beefcake tradition would be complete without the work of the French photo team known as Pierre et Gilles, who have collaborated on over-the-top, tightly styled, hand-finished photographs since 1976 and become wildly famous in Europe in the process. In their first American museum retrospective, their work feels more than a little embalmed, existing behind a not-so-invisible shield of artistic conservatism. Certain images come to life as art objects -- most notably, one of a beautiful young sailor up to his chest in water with an iridescent night sky behind him -- but those  are few. Hours: Wednesdays and Sundays, noon to 6 p.m.; Thursdays through Saturdays, until 8 p.m. Admission: $6; $3 for students, artists and the elderly (Smith).</p>
        <p>* BRIDGET RILEY, ''Reconnaissance,'' Dia Center for the Arts, 548 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 989-5566 (through June 17). Once overly identified with Op Art, this British abstract painter never got her due in anti-Op New York, but this beautifully installed show of 40 paintings from 1961 to 1984 should change things. Concentrating on the early black-and-white paintings that made Ms. Riley famous, it presents stringently pure yet accessible works that have, at their best, extended the optical potential implicit in the work of Mondrian, Josef Albers and Ad Reinhardt. At their weakest, their meticulously calibrated patterns can be so aggressive that they virtually kidnap the eye, take it on a joy ride and leave it in a crumpled heap. Either way, the overall effect is of an artist of unusual dedication who has remained loyal to the original premises of her art and yet steadfastly refused to repeat herself. Hours: Wednesdays through Sundays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $6; $3, students and the elderly (Smith).</p>
        <p>* SCYTHIAN GOLD. ''The Golden Deer of Eurasia: Scythian and Sarmatian Treasures From the Russian Steppes,'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Feb. 4.). ''Gold of the Nomads: Scythian Treasures From Ancient Ukraine,'' Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000 (through Jan. 21.). Certain kinds of art are box-office gold. Art made of gold is one of them, and there's a Fort Knox-size supply of the precious stuff in these two opulent exhibitions. The Brooklyn show is a survey-style glimpse at some exquisitely wrought 14-carat objects drawn from museums in Ukraine, where the Scythians put down roots in the first millennium B.C. The Met has drop-dead museological rarities from the State Hermitage Museum, but the focus here, which gives the proceedings a kind of treasure-hunt thrill, is on a cache of objects excavated fairly recently from tombs belonging to non-Scythian people whose identity is something of a mystery. Ideally the two shows should be seen together: they offer a really substantial archaeological update on the last big Scythian showcase in these parts, the Met's smash-hot ''In the Land of the Scythians'' of 25 years ago. Hours and admission: See above ( Cotter).</p>
        <p>* EDWARD STEICHEN, Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676 (through Feb. 4). A big, thorough exhibition, maybe a little too big and glossy, of one of the great photographers in American history, a restless, benign, flawed genius. Steichen also painted, made films, designed textiles, organized aerial reconnaissance photography in two world wars and put together the most popular photography exhibition ever, ''The Family of Man.'' We'll see how people respond to someone whose eclectic work can look, if anything, almost too elegant and self-regarding. Steichen ultimately seemed to reduce everything and everyone to props to demonstrate his own refined and stage-savvy sensibility. But what refinement. His best work has a finesse that borders on the erotic. Hours: Tuesdays through Thursdays and Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, 1 to 9 p.m. Admission: $10; $8 for students and the elderly (Michael Kimmelman).</p>
        <p>Galleries: Uptown</p>
        <p>DAN FLAVIN, Zwirner &amp; Wirth, 32 East 69th Street, (212) 517-8677 (through Nov. 4). Flavin's simple fluorescent-light works from the 60's illuminate this posh new gallery to simultaneously matter-of-fact and mystically radiant effect. The white ones have classic Minimalist rigor; examples consisting of just two or three colors are almost hedonistically sumptuous (Johnson).</p>
        <p>''REMBRANDT AND THE VENETIAN INFLUENCE,'' Salander-O'Reilly Galleries, 20 East 79th Street, (212) 879-6606 (through Nov. 18). The Venetian influence in Rembrandt's later paintings has long been noted; this show is an attempt to demonstrate by specific examples. But the topic is more suited to a museum presentation; this one mounts only a dozen paintings, three by Rembrandt and one labeled ''Studio of Rembrandt,'' along with oils by Titian, Tintoretto and Veronese. It is too small and catch-as-catch can to make the case. The most salient example here of Venice in Rembrandt is his great painting ''Flora'' (circa 1654). Next to it, the other works in this show pale (Glueck).</p>
        <p>Galleries: 57th Street</p>
        <p>* JACQUES HENRI LARTIGUE, Edwynn Houk, 745 Fifth Avenue, (212) 750-7070 (through Nov. 4). This magical exhibition of more than 60 vintage prints was drawn from the private collection of the French photographer's widow, who died last May. Concentrating mostly on small, wonderfully lively pictures made when he was a teenager, it vividly conveys his boyish enthusiasm for childhood games and horseplay, his fascination with flying, racing cars and fashionable women, and his excitement about the miracle of photography itself (Johnson).</p>
        <p>TABITHA VEVERS, ''Flying Dreams,'' Kraushaar, 724 Fifth Avenue, (212) 307-5730 (through Nov. 11). Updating medieval manuscript illumination, Ms. Vevers combines handwritten texts and deftly painted narrative imagery to document dreams of flight, her own and those of friends. One of these small, mysterious works illustrates the artist's dream of running a seaside flying school for babies, who are equipped with little golden parachutes (Johnson).</p>
        <p>Galleries: SoHo</p>
        <p>DAVID RABINOWITCH, Peter Blum, 99 Wooster Street, (212) 343-0441 (through Nov. 18). Restricting his vocabulary to circles, ovals and straight lines, and his means to pencil, ink or colored pencil, this Constructivist-Minimalist sculptor produced this series of extremely spare drawings during the early 1970's. Called ''Construction of Vision,'' they are resolutely abstract and quasi-scientific. But the ellipses and angled lines, cleanly drawn with mechanical drafting tools, have a subtly playful animation (Johnson).</p>
        <p>CHRIS VERENE, American Fine Arts, 22 Wooster Street, (212) 941-0401 (through Nov. 11) and Paul Morris, 465 West 23rd Street, (212) 727-2752 (through tomorrow) With often piercing intimacy, this 31-year-old photographer chronicles the lives of friends and relatives in his hometown of Galesburg, Ill. Each of 60 richly colored, squarish images in this two-gallery show has a brief handwritten text added by the artist. Under the picture of a cousin, Steve, and his young daughter at a McDonald's, the text says, ''His wife had just left them to go to a battered woman's shelter.'' A dozen prints, at Paul Morris, tenderly document the daily existence of Mr. Verene's grandfather (Johnson).</p>
        <p>CINDY WORKMAN, Lennon, Weinberg, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 941-0012 (through Nov. 4). Laminated to the reverse side of Plexiglas panels that are attached to the wall by heavy bolts, Ms. Workman's layered, digitalized montages of found imagery -- little girls, scientific or technical diagrams, girly cartoons and old smut photographs -- meditate on innocence, experience, consumerism and modernity (Johnson).</p>
        <p>Galleries: Chelsea</p>
        <p>ROE ETHRIDGE, Andrew Kreps, 516-A West 20th Street, (212) 741-8849 (through Nov. 4). Mr. Ethridge's clever orchestration of his own almost hallucinogenically clear photographs includes portraits of UPS delivery men in their trucks, head shots of two pretty young female models, close-up studies of young pine trees and a big picture of an ambulance that had just crashed. Believe it or not, these disparate images are persuasively connected by the theme of perfection and its tragic impossibility (Johnson).</p>
        <p>DAMIEN HIRST, Gagosian Gallery, 555 West 24th Street, (212) 741-1111 (through Dec. 16). Welcome to the Damien Hirst Universe. It's a big shiny place with mathematical grid paper printed on the walls, pale pristine dot paintings and many large vitrine sculptures, including two outfitted as gynecological examining rooms and filled with water and fish. It shows the artist moving beyond the dead animals and putrefying flesh that catapulted him to fame while clarifying and enriching the grandiose themes of his art: life and death and their complex, sometimes oppressive relationship to science and commerce. It contains some undeniable duds, but if it doesn't win over those who have resisted the work of this notorious young British artist, it won't be for lack of trying (Smith).</p>
        <p>SHARON LOCKHART, Barbara Gladstone, 515 West 24th Street, (212) 206-9300 (through Nov. 4). This cerebral photographer accompanied two anthropologists to former rubber-producing regions in Brazil where she photographed the humble dwellings of villagers and rephotographed their family snapshots. Both are presented in groups in the gallery. Another series of large color prints show a worker repairing the glossy stone floor of an archaeological museum in Mexico. It is all about ''the ethnographic gaze'' and it makes one feel perplexed and defensive (Johnson).</p>
        <p>SCOTT RICHTER AND BILL SMART, Elizabeth Harris, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 463-9666 (through Nov. 11). In opposite but equally engaging ways these two artists address basic elements of painting. Mr. Richter piles up paint into great heaping stacks of viscous color, exaggerating its sumptuous materiality to the point of absurdity. Mr. Smart reduces paint to almost pure primary colors in a series of square monochromes that have rounded corners and white circles like punch holes, giving Minimalism a subtle Pop spin (Johnson).</p>
        <p>ALEXIS ROCKMAN, Gorney Bravin + Lee, 534 West 26th Street, (212) 352-8372 (through Nov. 11). Inspired by a trip into South American jungles, Mr. Rockman's Pop-realist paintings depict a Northerner's lurid fantasies of tropical adventure and danger. One shows the artist himself gripped in the tentacles of a man-eating plant; another portrays him surrounded by parasites and dangerous fish. Something political about tourism is implied, but the satire is less biting than it should be, and the painting looks like overblown magazine illustration (Johnson).</p>
        <p>JANE AND LOUISE WILSON, 303 Gallery, 525 West 22nd Street, (212) 255-1121 (through Nov. 4). The British twin-sister video makers here direct their haunting ultraformalist vision to sites of post-cold-war resonance: two centers of research, training and development for the Russian space program. Focusing mostly on architecture and high-tech equipment, their four projections take you on a mesmerizing Cubistic journey through places that seem at once futuristic and dilapidated, a mix of ''2001: A Space Odyssey'' and ''Blade Runner'' (Johnson).</p>
        <p>RANDY WRAY, Derek Eller, 526-30 West 25th Street, (212) 206-6411 (through Nov. 11). To make his oddly confounding paintings, Mr. Wray first creates a funky, coffee table-scale abstract sculpture that he then photographs; the photograph is in turn digitally transformed into a kind of paint-by-numbers diagram that the artist copies in paint using brushes and various sorts of extruders, adding three-dimensional canvas elements as well. The final products are ambiguously suggestive and slightly creepy, hovering between pixilated abstraction and surrealism (Johnson).</p>
        <p>Other Galleries</p>
        <p>''REDRAWING THE LINE,'' Art in General, 79 Walker Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-0473 (through Oct. 28). This unfocused show of works in which line figures, literally or conceptually, includes an invigorating giant doodle by Diana Cooper; whited-out ledger pages by Peter Wegner; the image of a scribble cut from brown felt by Arturo Herrera; a dripped line from a performance by Francis Alys; a string sculpture by Pae White; and tangled plastic zip ties by Mungo Thomson. The importance of line in obliquely conceptual works by Alessandro Balteo and Sophie Tottie is harder to see (Johnson).</p>
        <p>Last Chance</p>
        <p>MAGDALENA ABAKANOWICZ, Marlborough, 40 West 57th Street, (212) 541-4900 (through tomorrow). This pre-eminent Polish sculptor's regiment of 95 life-size headless shells of human figures in rough bronze confronts the visitor here, creating a theater of tragic existentialism. On the terrace, giant, simplified dinosaur heads suggest a deep background of primordial terror (Johnson).</p>
        <p>''AGAINST NATURE,'' Sperone Westwater, 142 Greene Street, SoHo, (212) 431-3685 (through tomorrow). This elegant exhibition presents three famous Italian avant-gardists who, during the 1950's, sought a raw and biting materialism. Alberto Burri created Cubist compositions from coarse, stitched-together burlap; Lucio Fontana punctured his canvases or cut into them with graceful knife slashes; Piero Manzoni, later famous for more provocative conceptual works, is here represented by all-white, small but aggressively physical pictures, like one made entirely of little Styrofoam balls (Johnson).</p>
        <p>''AMERICAN MODERN, 1925-1940: DESIGN FOR A NEW AGE'' (through Jan. 7) and ''A CENTURY OF DESIGN, PART 2: 1925-1950'' (through Sunday), Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710. ''American Modern,'' the larger and more interesting of these shows, deals with the period between two design extravaganzas,  the Exposition des Arts Decoratifs et Industriels Modernes in Paris in 1925 and the New York World's Fair of 1939-40. Drawn from the Met's own collection and that of a patron, John C. Waddell, the show presents furniture, appliances, clocks, radios, cameras, textiles, tableware, posters and parts of a snappy blue-and-chrome dining room, along with other work by Bel Geddes, Deskey, Dreyfuss, Frankl, Loewy, Noguchi, Teague and Wright. ''A Century of Design,'' Part 2 of a four-part survey focusing on European 20th-century styles, also draws from the Met's collection. Although studded with star names like Aalto, Breuer, Eames, Ruhlmann and Mies, the show is lackluster by contrast. There is no scarcity of famous chairs; other good things include a wonderful scale drawing for the Daimler-Benz sport convertible No. 3384 (circa 1933). Hours and admission: See above (Glueck).</p>
        <p>JOHN CONSTABLE, Salmagundi Club, 47 Fifth Avenue, at 11th Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 929-5800 (through Thursday). This exhibition of more than 60 small studies by the famous English landscape painter is not uniformly great, but it has enough gems to urge a visit. A lovely study of a dark gray wind-whipped cloud under white-streaked blue sky is a fine piece of meteorological observation and, in its painterly vivaciousness, looks forward to Abstract Expressionism. Best of all is Constable's small but spectacularly rich and luminous watercolor copy of ''The Mill'' by Rembrandt (Johnson).</p>
        <p>* RINEKE DIJKSTRA, Marian Goodman Gallery, 24 West 57th Street, (212) 977-7160 (through tomorrow). This Dutch artist's solo debut in the United States includes a video (much seen elsewhere) of dancing teenagers in European clubs and a series of photographs she has been taking since 1997 of children in parks. In the video the youngsters preen touchingly. The photographs, color pictures along the lines of Thomas Struth's but more casual and less chilly, are heroic portraits, acutely sympathetic (Kimmelman).</p>
        <p>* PETER HUJAR, ''Photographs, 1980 to 1987,'' Matthew Marks Gallery, 523 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 243-0200 (through tomorrow). A show of 98 photographs from Hujar's estate, some never shown before. The prints, on a particularly warm paper that is no longer made, are quite beautiful. One would not use that adjective for the images, which are powerful and quietly, deeply disturbing, full of pain but resolutely refusing to dramatize it, now and again touching, now and again amusing in an elegiac sort of way. They are portraits of friends, some nude, some in costume, some engaged in odd enterprises like biting into a strawberry. They are portraits -- they cannot be called anything else -- of animals. They are images of destruction: collapsed houses, the flayed carcasses of slain cows, a dead dog on a heap of trash. They are intense and reticent at the same time. They are memorable (Vicki Goldberg).</p>
        <p>''PARADISE NOW: PICTURING THE GENETIC REVOLUTION,'' Exit Art, 548 Broadway, near Prince Street, SoHo, (212) 966-7745 (through tomorrow). ''We are at a threshold,'' declares the text panel at the start of this show. And we are, you know. Never mind that most of the art isn't great, because with more and more artists tapping into science, something big is bound to happen soon. Think of this as a preliminary report. The works span a decade and run the gamut from paintings and sculptures to the collecting of sperm and the breeding of very tiny exotic frogs. The artists fret predictably about tampering with Mother Nature and stress identity politics, also predictably, but the spirit of the show, an intangible, tips the scales in a positive direction (Kimmelman).</p>
        <p>* NEIL WINOKUR, Janet Borden, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, SoHo, (212) 431-0166 (through tomorrow). For this delightful portrait of his hometown, Mr. Winokur has produced a series of 32 still-life photographs, each a crystal-clear deadpan picture of an ordinary but richly iconic object against a bright colored backdrop. A Greek-style paper coffee cup, a Chinese food container, a Giants pennant, an old Broadway playbill, a Con Edison orange cone, a hot dog, a rat, a toy-size Empire State Building: these images produce a resonantly evocative cross section of New York experience (Johnson).</p>
