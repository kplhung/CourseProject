        <p>KLINGER-Isaac. Beloved brother, father, grandfather, and above all, friend, died peacefully October 19, surrounded by his children. A quiet and genuine man who loved to laugh, Isaac always gave generously of himself. He had a rare and special soul, and he will be missed dearly by all who knew him. The family respectfully requests that in lieu of flowers, donations be made to the American Cancer Society.</p>
