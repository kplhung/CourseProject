        <p>An Oct. 20 news article about 13-year-old twins who were charged with raping their neighbor, and their experience in the foster care system, is a chilling reminder of the danger of turning child welfare into an either-or contest between child protection and family preservation.</p>
        <p>More than 85 percent of New York City children in foster care are there not as a result of abuse, but of neglect allegations related to poverty, homelessness, addiction or domestic violence.</p>

        <p>An Oct. 20 news article about 13-year-old twins who were charged with raping their neighbor, and their experience in the foster care system, is a chilling reminder of the danger of turning child welfare into an either-or contest between child protection and family preservation.</p>
        <p>More than 85 percent of New York City children in foster care are there not as a result of abuse, but of neglect allegations related to poverty, homelessness, addiction or domestic violence.</p>
        <p>Despite this, New York City child welfare practice remains lopsidedly focused on protective removal and placement. In effect, the city is telling families: We know what kind of help you need, but what we mostly have to offer is the involuntary removal of your children.</p>
