        <p>North America's largest laser vision correction company, TLC Laser Eye Centers of Toronto, has abandoned its e-commerce distribution venture and will take a one-time charge of up to $8 million in the current quarter. EyeVantage.com, was set last year to encourage 12,500 TLC-affiliated doctors in the United States to order ophthalmology products electronically. A $100 million investment in eyeVantage.com by a group of investment funds collapsed along with e-commerce share prices in the spring, and TLC could not find another buyer. The company also said that it had lost $2 million in the first quarter.</p>
