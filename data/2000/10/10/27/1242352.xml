        <p>In the end, the Mets were not the Subway Series' Little Engine That Could. They couldn't because the Yankees were the Super Chiefs.</p>
        <p>Each game of the five-game series was thisclose, but the numbers were really misleading. The Mets didn't have a chance. They were playing against a team whose players responded to moves their manager made. If everything that King Midas touched turned to gold, just about every move Joe Torre made turned into a victory.</p>
        <p>The ninth inning of last night's 4-2 victory was only the latest example. In the eighth inning, Torre had Chuck Knoblauch bat for his leadoff hitter and second baseman, Jose Vizcaino. The score was tied, 2-2.</p>
        <p>Knoblauch did not instantly hit a home run to win the World Series, but when the inning was over and the game was still tied, Torre sent Luis Sojo to second base. He did not put Knoblauch there for the same reason he had not started him at second in any of the three games at Shea Stadium, where there was no designated hitter.</p>
        <p>Knoblauch had not played defense in a long time, Torre felt, and he didn't want to subject him or the team to a rusty fielder who had experienced throwing problems much of the season.</p>
        <p>But in inserting Sojo into the game, he made a double switch, putting Sojo in the ninth, or pitcher's, spot in the batting order and the pitcher, Mike Stanton, in the No. 1 position. There was Sojo, then, going to bat against Al Leiter in the ninth inning with two out and runners at first and second.</p>
        <p>Remember, this was Sojo, the utility infielder who played in three previous World Series for the Yankees but who was considered too expensive to retain in a season in which the payroll would soar to a record $112 million. The Yankees knew they had made a mistake in letting him go and grabbed him back in a trade with Pittsburgh in August.</p>
        <p>So all Sojo did was stroke Leiter's 142nd pitch to center field for a single that sent Jorge Posada racing home with the tie-breaking run. Jay Payton's throw, a good one, met Posada at the plate and caromed off his body into the Mets' dugout. Talk about piling insult upon injury. Scott Brosius, who had singled following a walk to Posada, followed him home with the run that gave the Yankees their only victory whose margin was not a mere run.</p>
        <p>The Yankees scored 19 runs, the Mets 16. During this season in which offensive production continued to escalate, that score might have been one game's result. But the people who pitch for the Yankees and the Mets were remarkably stingy, not to mention good.</p>
        <p>Leiter was outstanding last night, into the ninth inning, in fact, but Andy Pettitte and the relief corps were just as parsimonious. In the immediate aftermath of the final game, some people who always look critically at Bobby Valentine's moves and decisions questioned the wisdom of leaving Leiter in the game that long. But the big-game left-hander ended the eighth inning by striking out Bernie Williams and he began the ninth by striking out Tino Martinez and struck out the next batter, Paul O'Neill, too.</p>
        <p>Leiter also had two strikes on Posada, but he threw him three balls as well, and it was the fourth one that cost him. Perhaps that was the time to relieve Leiter; if not then, after he gave up the single to Brosius.</p>
        <p>Asked why he didn't bring in a right-handed pitcher to face Sojo, Valentine said, ''I wasn't going to bring in a right-handed pitcher to face Polonia or for Sojo.'' He referred to Luis Polonia, whom he expected to pinch-hit if he had summoned a right-hander. But the manager said he didn't want to call for John Franco either.</p>
        <p>''Rather than Johnny going three days in a row,'' he said, ''I decided to go with Al. Striking out those first two guys and the pitches he threw to Posada made me think he had plenty. I was wrong. It was the wrong decision, obviously.''</p>
        <p>Then Valentine added sarcastically, ''If I brought somebody else in, they definitely would have gotten the guy out and we'd still be playing.''</p>
        <p>Nobody had reason to question Torre's moves. Take one he made in Game 4, for example. Looking for some extra production in the leadoff spot, Torre moved Derek Jeter there. Jeter hit the first pitch of the game for a home run, giving the Yankees an instant lead they would never relinquish. Then he lashed a triple as the first hitter in the third inning, scoring the run that would become decisive in a 3-2 victory.</p>
        <p>In that same game, Torre yanked Denny Neagle from the game one out short of the five innings he needed to qualify as the winning pitcher. He brought in David Cone, a bullpen novice, to pitch to Mike Piazza, who had hit two monster shots against Neagle, one foul, the other fair. Cone retired the dangerous Piazza on an infield popup and maintained the 3-2 lead. Torre's succession of relief pitchers also did their jobs immaculately.</p>
        <p>Not that he should have done anything differently, but Torre left Bernie Williams alone last night even though he had not had a hit in 15 World Series at-bats. Williams also had extended his Series hitless streak to 22 at-bats dating to the third game last year. He wasn't yet in danger of challenging Marv Owen's World Series record of 31 consecutive at-bats without a hit (1934-35), but he was closer to it than the Yankees wanted to see.</p>
        <p>So what did Williams do? In his first time up, he hit a home run, giving the Yankees a 1-0 lead. The run could be said to have propelled the Yankees to their third successive World Series championship, a feat they completed when Williams caught Piazza's drive to deep center field with a runner on base.</p>
        <p>He caught the ball precisely at midnight. Torre's team became champions again, and Valentine's turned into pumpkins.</p>
