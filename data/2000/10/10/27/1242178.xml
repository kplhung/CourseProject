        <p>''Stardom'' is another in the series of films -- collect 'em all -- that seem to use Andy Warhol's dictum that in the future everyone would be famous for 15 minutes. Would that ''Stardom'' lasted only 15 minutes. The writer and director Denys Arcand's social satire is torn from yesterday's screaming headlines, a fish-wrap comedy about the dangers of fame.</p>
        <p>The picture charts the resistible rise of a supermodel, Tina Menzhal (Jessica Pare), a young girl from the wilds of Canada launched into the -- yawn -- dizzying heights of notoriety.</p>
        <p>Someone had the idea of showing both Tina's entire life as it was being captured by television cameras and a documentary shot by Bruce (Robert Lepage), her photographer friend. During the incessant interviews, in which Tina's interrogators are constantly foisting their fantasies upon her, she never gets to finish a sentence. Ms. Pare's beauty lends itself to this conceit: you're constantly asking yourself which model she most resembles. The problem is, the story resembles so many other movies and short stories that it's hard to single one out.</p>
        <p>The picture starts when Tina is snapped by a photographer skating blissfully during a hockey game. Her rapt, fetching expression turns up everywhere, and a prattling V.J. from an MTV-like operation goes on about her. The V.J. needs to ease up on the iced cappuccinos, though most V.J.'s tend to be much cooler: a sign of just how out of touch the movie is.</p>
        <p>Tina's path toward the top begins, and man after man falls for her mystery; that mystique is abetted by the fact that none of them allow her to develop a personality.</p>
        <p>The guys who try to mold Tina into their particular dreams are the photographer (Charles Berling) who discovers her; a restaurateur (Dan Aykroyd, who has evolved into a clever, minimal actor; his technique is even drier than it was during his brisk days in the original cast of ''Saturday Night Live''); and a diplomat (Frank Langella), who uses his malignant purr to suggest acquisitiveness as a form of ardor. Thomas Gibson glides above everything as Tina's manager, an even-tempered power broker who is often filmed in austere black and white, and who speaks so softly he could be doing color commentary on the Golf Channel.</p>
        <p>Given that any number of models are coaxed onto the runway when they're barely old enough for braces, Tina seems a little old for the game at 18. A younger girl would have given Mr. Arcand, who has a sure hand at the comedy of insecurity, more ammunition for his picture. Not that 18 isn't young, but the babies who are turned into sexual fantasies are an aspect of the subject that eludes the picture.</p>
        <p>Mr. Arcand tries to show how unformed Tina is by bringing up her abandonment by her father and her fixation on older men. To his credit, he doesn't make too much of that; perhaps he's too busy displaying stereotypes of media jackals braying at Tina's heels. Everything is filtered through the media, allowing ''Stardom'' the opportunity to poke fun at material parodied so often that it's worn thin to the point of transparency. (This material was done more effectively in ''Robocop,'' when it was just part of the backdrop instead of being the center of the picture.) ''Stardom'' makes its metaphor of 15 minutes seem like a lifetime.</p>
        <p>''Stardom'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes strong language, sexual situations and a gallery show with objects made of feces.</p>
        <p>STARDOM</p>

Jacob Potashnik; director of photography, Guy Dufaux; edited by Isabelle Dedieu; production designer, Zoe Sakellaropoulo; produced by Denise Robert and Robert Lantos; released by Lions Gate Films.
