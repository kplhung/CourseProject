        <p>With a home run in each of the last two games and a .409 batting average, Yankee shortstop Derek Jeter was named the most valuable player of the Subway Series last night, but he deferred the honor.</p>
        <p>''You could've picked a name out of the hat; we have 25 M.V.P.'s,'' he said. ''First game, Vizcaino. What O'Neill's done, our pitching staff, our bullpen, Luis Sojo. You don't rely on one guy.''</p>

        <p>With a home run in each of the last two games and a .409 batting average, Yankee shortstop Derek Jeter was named the most valuable player of the Subway Series last night, but he deferred the honor.</p>
        <p>''You could've picked a name out of the hat; we have 25 M.V.P.'s,'' he said. ''First game, Vizcaino. What O'Neill's done, our pitching staff, our bullpen, Luis Sojo. You don't rely on one guy.''</p>
        <p>His cap on backward, Jeter, 26, was wearing a gray World Series champions sweatshirt that was wet with Champagne spray, but he entered the interview area carrying a bottle of water.</p>
        <p>''This is by far the best team we've played,'' he said, meaning the Mets as a World Series opponent. ''All the games could've gone either way. Every year is a different story, but I'd be lying if I said this wasn't more gratifying. Oakland was the hottest team when we played 'em, Seattle was tough, and the Mets were the best team I've seen in five years.''</p>
        <p>In his five seasons, Jeter has earned four World Series rings, including one in each of the last three years.</p>
        <p>For the Subway Series, he had 9 hits in 22 at-bats, including two doubles, a triple and two homers. His first-pitch homer off Bobby J. Jones set the tone for the Yankees' 3-2 victory in Game 4 and his one-out homer off Al Leiter created a 2-2 tie in the sixth inning of last night's 4-2 victory.</p>
        <p>The homers supplied his two runs batted in for the Series and sparked his .864 slugging average. He also walked three times. Jeter's 19 total bases set a five-game Series record. He tied five-game records with his nine hits and six runs scored.</p>
        <p>Asked if this Series victory was a last hurrah for this Yankee team's core group, he said: ''No one is focused on next year. We're going to enjoy this before we start thinking about next year.'' And when he was asked what his reaction would be if Joe Torre were to retire as manager, he smiled.</p>
        <p>''If he retires, I'm going to retire,'' Jeter said. ''He continues to push the right buttons. He's got a magic wand. You can't say enough about him as a manager. He's a player's manager. He lets you play. He doesn't get on you unless you make mental mistakes. He has a lot of confidence in everybody.''</p>
