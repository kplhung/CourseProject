        <p>Some of the most extravagant furniture in 18th-century Paris was produced by marchands-merciers, merchants as entrepreneurial in their way as today's Wall Street speculators. These merchants combined the roles of dealer and decorator. They produced sumptuous objects that employed the skills of several masters in the separate guilds of cabinetmaking, bronze casting and porcelain manufacturing.</p>
        <p>Today Christie's will put on display several of the marchands-merciers' 18th-century luxurious objects, as well as seven pieces made for the French royal family, at a sales preview of furniture and works of art formerly in the collection of Djahanguir Riahi, an Iranian businessman based in Paris.</p>
        <p>The viewing continues through Wednesday; the sale, on Thursday, is expected to raise $25 million. The collection is well known and is said to be comparable in quality to that of the collections of J. Paul Getty, Jayne Wrightsman and Stavros Niarchos. To auction the Riahi consignment, Christie's had to buy it, for an undisclosed amount. ''The collection is owned by Christie's,'' said Andree Corroon, a spokeswoman. ''We've had a long history with Mr. Riahi, who has been buying here since the 1970's. We're been interested in this well-known collection since 1995. We offered to buy it so we could sell it all together.''</p>
        <p>There are 59 lots in the sale, which comprises a virtual who's who of 18th-century French craftsmen. There are seven masterpieces by Andre-Charles Boulle (1642-1732), perhaps the most inventive French cabinetmaker; a vivid and colorful Louis XV Savonnerie carpet (circa 1750) designed by Pierre-Josse Perrot for the royal household; a Gobelin tapestry with the royal arms of France created by Charles Le Brun, Louis XIV's favorite decorator; rare 18th-century marquetry tables signed by the master ebeniste Bernard II van Risen Burgh; and a delicate round Louis XV marquetry table with  Sevres plaques from the 1770's stamped by Martin Carlin.</p>
        <p>''It's probably the greatest collection of purely French furniture we've had, with that number of masterpieces,'' said the Christie's specialist Alistair Clarke.</p>
        <p>The sale includes ormolu-mounted chinoiserie Sevres vases that Christie's says Queen Marie Antoinette bought between 1774 and 1776, and a pair of elaborate ormolu, bronze and marble candelabra that Count Alexander Stroganoff acquired in Paris around 1785.</p>
        <p>Mr. Riahi's affinity for the finest French furniture was well known to Paris's top dealers because he has outbid them at auction for the past 30 years. The gilded bronze chenets (end irons) are especially spectacular, particularly a pair of 20-inch-tall gilded swans that are thought to have been commissioned in the 1750's by Madame de Pompadour, Louis XV's mistress, for her home in Paris, now the Elysee Palace.</p>
        <p>Madame de Pompadour had a particular taste for birds. Amazingly lifelike, these beautifully chased bronze swans rest on rocks amid bulrushes but fluff their feathers as if they are about to take flight. They are not like American white swans. They are Cygnus olor, a breed native to Europe and Asia, with shorter necks. The estimate for the pair is $300,000 to $500,000.</p>
        <p>Deco by Leleu</p>
        <p>Prices for furniture designed by the great Art Deco masters are approaching the levels achieved by 18th-century French masterpieces. Ever since the late 1960's, when the international jet set rediscovered the serene beauty of works created between the two world wars by Pierre Chareau, Jacques-Emile Ruhlmann and Jean-Michel Frank, Deco has been chic.</p>
        <p>This is furniture for the rich and the brave. In its sale of ''Important 20th-Century Decorative Works of Art'' on Dec. 1 and 2, Sotheby's New York is selling a massive oak sleighlike bed that the Parisian designer Armand-Albert Rateau designed for his wife in 1921. A frieze of festooned drapery is carved on its headboard and footboard. The estimate is $300,000 to $400,000.</p>
        <p>Gerard Widdershoven, the owner of Maison Gerard, a gallery at 53 East 10th Street in Greenwich Village, is a pioneering dealer in Art Deco. He opened his gallery in 1974, when he was 22. He was taking a chance on East 10th Street, which was then occupied mostly by wholesale antiques dealers, importers and small auction houses.</p>
        <p>''I think I was the first one to deal strictly in Deco in the neighborhood, so I would get first crack at all their antiques coming to the States,'' he said. ''For most wholesalers, Deco was 'used furniture.' They would ship glass and pottery in Deco buffets instead of crates because they were so well made and so inexpensive. They thought they were unsalable.''</p>
        <p>It did not take long for interior designers like Vicente Wolfe, Robert Metzger, Thierry Despont and Jed Johnson to find Maison Gerard. Soon Deco pieces were showing up in the homes of such celebrities as Madonna, Yoko Ono and John McEnroe.</p>
        <p>Last week Mr. Widdershoven opened a new show of 40 works of Jules and Andre Leleu. (It runs through Nov. 6.) Born in 1883 outside of Paris, Jules Leleu was trained as a decorative painter. In 1909 he took over his father's business and started a decorating division. He often went to Paris to discover the best cabinetmakers and by 1924 set up his office there.</p>
        <p>His furniture creations for the international exposition that gave Deco its name in 1925 were such a success that he gained prestigious new clients. He employed his whole family in his Maison Leleu, offering interior decoration services, furniture, boiseries, textiles, rugs and lighting fixtures. He collaborated with Ivan Da Silva Bruhns on the rugs, Lurcat for tapestries and Dunand for lacquer.</p>
        <p>His furniture was simplified in line but was made out of the finest woods, such as macassar ebony, sycamore, burl walnut and palisander. Its spare decoration might be a floral motif of ivory inlay or a fanlike bronze adornment, always of high quality and restrained style. As he became known for his luxe creations he was hired to design interiors for the French president's train, for the ocean liners Ile-de-France and the Normandie and for film sets.</p>
        <p>Maison Gerard has several pieces of Leleu's Deco furniture. Highlights include a commode in amboyna wood from Indonesia with ivory inlays and pulls, a marquetry games table in mahogany with ebony, mother of pearl and sycamore inlay, a gigantic fluted bed that looks like a boat, a verre eglomise coffee table with bronze feet, a suite of upholstered furniture with its original tapestry, carpets designed by Leleu's daughter, Paule, and a complete executive office.</p>
        <p>Mr. Widdershoven has done his homework; archival photos are on display of some of the rooms for which the furniture he is selling was  made. The prices range from $6,000 to $50,000.</p>
