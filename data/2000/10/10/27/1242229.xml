      <block class="full_text">
        <p>The Kellogg Company, the maker of Eggo waffles and Rice Krispies cereal, announced today that it would acquire the Keebler Foods Company for $3.86 billion in cash.</p>
        <p>The deal would combine the leading breakfast cereal company in the world with the second-largest cookie and cracker maker in the United States, and unite several widely recognized marketing icons, including Tony the Tiger; Snap, Crackle and Pop; and the Keebler Elves.</p>
        <p>With about 40 percent of its business in cereals, Kellogg has been particularly hard hit as consumers have moved away from traditional sit-down meals in favor of convenience foods like breakfast bars. Kellogg's cereal sales have declined roughly 2 percent this year, weighing on the company's earnings and testing investors' patience.</p>
        <p>While Quaker Oats, a Kellogg rival, owns Gatorade, a dominant brand in the rapidly growing category of noncarbonated beverages, Kellogg has had little outside of its cereal business to propel it forward. Sales of its Pop-Tarts have increased about 8 percent in recent years, but the company has been unable to eke out enough momentum from its secondary products to generate the double-digit earnings growth many investors expect from food companies.</p>
        <p>Acquiring Keebler gives Kellogg a foothold in the fast-growing snack foods category, potentially easing the company's problem of being the dominant player in a dwindling segment of the food business.</p>
        <p>''This is transformational,'' Carlos M. Gutierrez, Kellogg's chairman and chief executive, said in an interview. With the addition of Keebler, Mr. Gutierrez said, cereals would represent no more than 25 percent of the company's total business.</p>
        <p>Sales of cookies and crackers, by contrast, have been increasing more than 5 percent a year, benefiting from the quest for convenience and a growing consumer realization that low-fat snacks do not always have fewer calories than the indulgent treats they are meant to replace. Keebler's stock has risen from a 52-week low of $21.75, reached in February, to a high of $46.19 last month.</p>
        <p>Under the agreement, Kellogg will pay $42 for each Keebler share, a slight premium over Wednesday's closing price of $39.38, and assume $550 million of the company's debt. Kellogg's stock rose $1.56, to $24.31.</p>
        <p>That is significantly lower than the price company officials had hoped to receive. Flowers Industries, which owns 55 percent of Keebler, put the cookie company up for sale last July, when it was struggling with mounting losses at its Mrs. Smith's pie business. At the time, a flurry of acquisitions in the food industry was under way, including the $10.5 billion purchase of Pillsbury by Diageo, a British conglomerate, and the $14.9 billion sale of Nabisco, the leading snack foods maker, by Philip Morris, the owner of Kraft Foods.</p>
        <p>Amid the consolidation craze, Keebler officials set a sales target of $48 to $52 a share, sources close to the deal say. But given the company's second place position in the market, its limited overseas presence, and the tremendous resources that Philip Morris can bring to bear in marketing Nabisco, many potential suitors sat out the bidding, leaving Kellogg as the sole contestant.</p>
        <p>Even as it announced the Keebler acquisition, Kellogg officials lowered their earnings forecasts for the fourth quarter and the coming year, advising investors that the company will have to spend heavily to revive its listless marketing campaigns. After cutting back on expenses to meet analysts' earnings expectations, Kellogg's advertising spending is at its lowest point in nearly 10 years.</p>
        <p>''That's exactly the cycle we're trying to break,'' Mr. Gutierrez said.</p>
