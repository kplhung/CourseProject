        <p>In a long-awaited effort to coordinate support for its online spinoff, Barnes &amp; Noble is installing barnes andnoble.com terminals in its 550 superstores and starting a joint membership discount program to encourage its biggest customers to shop at its online store.</p>

        <p>In a long-awaited effort to coordinate support for its online spinoff, Barnes &amp; Noble is installing barnes andnoble.com terminals in its 550 superstores and starting a joint membership discount program to encourage its biggest customers to shop at its online store.</p>
        <p>The three-year-old online store's failure to install online terminals in the company's stores was among investors' biggest complaints about barnesandnoble.com, in which Barnes &amp; Noble owns a 40 percent stake. The online store's stock has fallen 80 percent in the last 12 months in part because of analysts' worries that the store chain's executives feared losing sales to its online spinoff.</p>
        <p>But Leonard Riggio, chairman of Barnes &amp; Noble and barnesand noble.com, both based in New York, said they had moved as quickly as possible. ''It is just not something that you can turn on a dime,'' he said, calling integration of the company's stores, warehouses and inventory systems a ''massive undertaking.'' Installing ''Internet service counters'' in its stores will cost the company about $25 million, he said.</p>
        <p>Barnes &amp; Noble's clerks, not its customers, will enter orders to the online store, but the prices and shipments will come from barnesand noble.com. Shoppers could choose to pick up shipments and return online purchases at the retail stores. Mr. Riggio said the Web site would expand the selection in its stores.</p>
        <p>But the arrangement will also effectively raise Barnesandnoble .com's prices in many places. Unlike Amazon.com, barnesandnoble.com will have to collect sales tax in every state where it applies. Tax authorities consider its partnership with Barnes &amp; Noble to constitute doing business in every state. Because it has no bricks and mortar stores, Amazon collects sales tax only in the few states where it has warehouses and its headquarters.</p>
        <p>The new membership discount program will cost $25 annually and provide for discounts of 10 percent off store prices and 5 percent off Web site prices. But it is aimed only at  customers who spend more than $250 a year in the store or $500 online.</p>
        <p>The addition of the membership-discount follows a previous pullback from widespread discounts at both companies and elsewhere in the industry. Earlier this year the chain ended its last across-the-board 10 percent discount on all hard-cover books. Following price increases at Amazon, barnesandnoble.com lowered all its discounts by 10 percent of the cover price.</p>
        <p>Analysts said the increases in book prices at the online stores made it easier for Barnes &amp; Noble to install terminals in its superstores. Including shipping charges, only the most expensive books or large orders are now cheaper online than at cover price. Mr. Riggio said the average bookstore purchase was about $25, which would be about the same as online, including shipping.</p>
        <p>Addressing a common gripe among publishers, Mr. Riggio said the Web site would also help staff recommend books. ''Now the bookseller can print out reviews, see the best-selling books in the category, and speak with authority,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In a meeting with analysts, barnesandnoble.com executives also said the company expected to report third-quarter sales up 60 percent from 1999 and 10 percent from this year's second quarter. The company will report its earnings on Monday. Mark Rowen, of Prudential Securities, said the results showed the company was gaining market share from Amazon -- whose book, music and video sales rose 3 percent in the third quarter from the second quarter.</p>
