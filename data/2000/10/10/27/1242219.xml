        <p>Sister Theresa Torsone is a baseball nun.</p>
        <p>She has taught math at St. Matthias School in Ridgewood, Queens, for more than 20 years. She has been a rabid Yankee fan for twice that long. Her memories of the game stretch back to the eras of DiMaggio and Whitey Ford, and in recent days, she has used those memories as a bridge to link her students with baseball's past.</p>
        <p>During the last Subway Series, in 1956, Sister Theresa watched as Don Larsen, the Yankee, pitched a perfect game. She kept the ticket in her pocket for years, relinquishing it only when she entered the convent. She didn't want to part with the stub. She was forced to give away all of her earthly possessions.</p>
        <p>''A part of me died that day,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The soul of a true baseball fan, though, is an ageless thing, as durable as strike three and you're out. While the lineups may shift from year to year, Sister Theresa, like any true aficionado of the game, will tell you this: baseball heroes come and go, but baseball fans never completely let go of their love.</p>
        <p>Vincent Sinnott is 10 years old. He is a precocious fifth-grade student with a mouth that bubbles over with words. Although Vincent thinks that Reggie Jackson, the anchor of the Yankee outfield in the 70's, played third base, does it really matter? From his teeth to his toenails, Vincent is a baseball fan.</p>
        <p>''The Yankees are the best team ever because they work hard and they always struggle and they play great and they never give up,'' Vincent panted at lunchtime the other day as his classmates at St. Matthias spilled across a barricaded section of Catalpa Avenue.</p>
        <p>''They had Lou Gehrig, Mickey Mantle, Joe DiMaggio and my all-time favorite, Babe Ruth,'' he said with enviable erudition.</p>
        <p>They say that grown men were reduced to bawling children when Walter O'Malley yanked the Brooklyn Dodgers out of Ebbets Field and packed them off to California more than 40 years ago. So it stands to reason that today's children -- the fifth generation of New York baseball fans -- are approaching this year's Subway Series with the earnestness and passions of adults.</p>
        <p>At St. Matthias, a strict and successful Roman Catholic school where academics have always overshadowed sports, the students may not have been playing baseball on their lunch hour but they were certainly gabbing about the game. They are nearly split between the Yankees and the Mets, and their electric recess banter showed it. The girls screamed for the love of Derek Jeter. The boys deconstructed the moral minutiae of Mike Piazza, Roger Clemens and the bat.</p>
        <p>These days, baseball is the only game in town.</p>
        <p>''Baseball is fun and challenging and hard to play and it's better than football,'' Desiree Roman, 10, explained. ''In football, you get tackled and you could get hurt. If it's really bad, you could even die.''</p>
        <p>Freddy Rios, also 10, may not know who Mookie Wilson is -- he is a former Mets star who now coaches first base for the team -- but he was able to lay out his loyalty to the Bronx Bombers in a formula simpler than one plus one makes two.</p>
        <p>''The Yankees are good,'' he shrugged. ''The Mets are not.''</p>
        <p>One assignment at St. Matthias this week called for the students to write an essay praising the team they didn't favor, a task that produced some feats of imaginative flexibility.</p>
        <p>Robert Texter, a sixth-grade Mets fan, wrote that the only Yankee he could stand was the second baseman. ''I admit the only Yankee I like is Chuck Knoblauch,'' Robert wrote, ''because of his weird batting stance.''</p>
        <p>Since she came to St. Matthias more than two decades ago, Sister Theresa has seen baseball passions like Robert's wax and wane.</p>
        <p>''A few years ago, there was a whole group of kids in the school who had absolutely no interest in baseball,'' she recalled. ''It was after the strike in 1994. I suppose they picked it up from their parents, who had just lost heart.''</p>
        <p>But now, she said, the spirit has returned.</p>
        <p>''What is so great about the Yankees this year is that there are no real, real superstars,'' she said. ''They're a team. And a group of individuals, even if they're great players, will never beat a team.''</p>
