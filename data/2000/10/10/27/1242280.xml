        <p>IT has become tragically obvious this week how provincial the rest of Americans are. They have not been paying attention to the Subway Series, and they have no excuse.</p>
        <p>They know that a contest between two New York baseball teams is the most important event on the planet, for we told them so ourselves. It has been proclaimed endlessly on the network newscasts and talk shows originating in Midtown. It is on the cover of Newsweek. It is so important that a national newspaper based here has redesigned its sports section for the Series.</p>

        <p>IT has become tragically obvious this week how provincial the rest of Americans are. They have not been paying attention to the Subway Series, and they have no excuse.</p>
        <p>They know that a contest between two New York baseball teams is the most important event on the planet, for we told them so ourselves. It has been proclaimed endlessly on the network newscasts and talk shows originating in Midtown. It is on the cover of Newsweek. It is so important that a national newspaper based here has redesigned its sports section for the Series.</p>
        <p>And what thanks do we get for all our efforts to educate the rubes? The lowest television ratings in history for the World Series. During the first four games, only about 12 percent of the households in America were watching, according to the Nielsen ratings, which are down almost a third from last year.</p>
        <p>It's bad enough that Americans tuned out on the greatest World Series since the last time two New York teams met, but they can't even bring themselves to admit they have a problem. Instead of facing up to their own petty chauvinism, they're offering excuses.</p>
        <p>Some complain that the Series lacked the heartland-versus-the-big-city dynamic. Instead of a plucky team from a small market taking on the rich Yankee, it was a clash of two expensive payrolls from the same place. If there's no way for New York to lose, the rest of America doesn't want to watch.</p>
        <p>Some out-of-towners also have the bizarre belief that they do not need to hear anymore what a great sports town New York is. They may be intrigued by other aspects of the city -- the street life, the money, the ambition, the peculiar mix of people and industries -- but they don't see what's so unusual about the sports scene here.</p>
        <p>New York may have slightly better athletes, and certainly better-paid ones, but other cities have teams and rabid fans, too. New York's teams get more national publicity, but fans elsewhere suspect that is not necessarily because the teams are more interesting to the nation but because they're more interesting to the news media based in New York.</p>
        <p>How could the fans out there be so misguided? Why is there such a gap this week between New York and the rest of America? It's hard for New Yorkers to understand, but one way to start would be to reconsider that classic O. Henry story ''A Cosmopolite in a Cafe.''</p>
        <p>The man in the title is E. Rushmore Coglan, a self-proclaimed ''citizen of the terrestrial sphere'' who meets the narrator in a Manhattan cafe. The narrator, at first dubious, quotes Kipling's lines about the pride and rivalry of men from different cities: ''The men that breed from them, they traffic up and down, but cling to their cities' hem as a child to the mother's gown.''</p>
        <p>But Coglan will have none of it. ''Some day,'' he insists, ''all this petty pride in one's city or state or section or country will be wiped out, and we'll all be citizens of the world, as we ought to be.'' He departs for another table, leaving the narrator persuaded that at last there is a man who has moved beyond provincialism.</p>
        <p>BUT then the narrator hears glasses smashing and sees Coglan tossed out of the cafe for brawling with another man. A waiter explains that he started fighting after the other man said something about the ''bum sidewalks and water supply'' of Coglan's hometown.</p>
        <p>''Why,'' the narrator protests to the waiter, ''that man is a citizen of the world -- a cosmopolite.</p>
        <p>''Originally from Mattawamkeag, Me.,'' the waiter replies, ''and he wouldn't stand for no knockin' the place.''</p>
        <p>It's a classic O. Henry twist, and a typical New York gibe at small minds in the provinces. But is it fair? What kind of people actually sit around cafes proclaiming themselves cosmopolites -- people from Manhattan or Mattawamkeag? Can you imagine anyone from Maine actually making a scene like that?</p>
        <p>Even the most chauvinistic native of Maine would realize that there are places with grander sidewalks than his native burg. Why would he be so intent on defending them? He would probably be amazed that anyone cared. He would realize that most people outside Mattawamkeag are not all that interested in its sidewalks, or its water supply -- or, for that matter, its sports teams.</p>
        <p>In fact, that rube might consider it odd that people in any town would expect the rest of America to be fascinated by a game between two local teams. If you asked the man from Mattawamkeag to describe those people, he might even call them provincial.</p>
