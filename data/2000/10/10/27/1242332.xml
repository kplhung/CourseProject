        <p>Arena@Feed  173A North Third Street  Williamsburg, Brooklyn  Through Sunday</p>
        <p>Cotter Luppi's large colored pencil drawings on paper fit into a contemporary kind of organic abstraction that isn't really organic or abstract at all. Its forms tend to look simultaneously carnal and mechanical, decorative but packed with information. The result is an art about mutant, morphing, bionic things. It suits the new sovereignty of genetic codes and replacement parts.</p>

        <p>Arena@Feed  173A North Third Street  Williamsburg, Brooklyn  Through Sunday</p>
        <p>Cotter Luppi's large colored pencil drawings on paper fit into a contemporary kind of organic abstraction that isn't really organic or abstract at all. Its forms tend to look simultaneously carnal and mechanical, decorative but packed with information. The result is an art about mutant, morphing, bionic things. It suits the new sovereignty of genetic codes and replacement parts.</p>
        <p>Executed in a palette of pinks and excremental browns, with a draftsmanly finesse suited to scientific illustration, Mr. Luppi's shapes seem to refer to cartoons, mandalas and body parts. Intestinal loops and sliced-off arterial tubes float beside sprocket wheels bristling with nipples and Tantric flames. Polyp-like growths resemble Arabic characters. Molecular clusters suggest hooked rugs. A blobby gum-wad splat is also a spurt of vital juices dribbling chains of DNA.</p>
        <p>Mr. Luppi keeps all this shape-shifting under firm control with the pressure of his hand. He works his pencils so hard that the individual forms swell out in relief from the surface of the paper as if they were embossed, giving a satisfyingly adamant, assertive touch to this promising New York solo debut.</p>
