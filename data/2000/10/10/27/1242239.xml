        <p>Reacting quickly to pre-election pressure brought by steel companies, unions and 235 members of Congress, the Clinton administration has promised to take the first steps toward new limits on steel imports.</p>
        <p>The industry and unions maintain that they are facing a historic crisis, and they blame foreign steel producers, which, they say, receive direct or indirect subsidies from their governments. They say the situation has resulted in six recent steel company failures, thousands of layoffs and historically low stock prices.</p>
        <p>West Virginia and Pennsylvania, two of the largest steel-producing states, are seen as competitive in the presidential election. Vice President Al Gore needs union workers to turn out in large numbers in those states to beat Gov. George W. Bush.</p>
        <p>John D. Podesta, the White House chief of staff, told corporate and union leaders in a letter this week that the administration would send  emissaries to four nations -- China, India, Taiwan and Ukraine -- to warn them that the ''dramatic recent increase'' in their steel exports could soon be subject to higher duties or other restrictions. Mr. Podesta also promised that the government would take ''all reasonable steps'' to guard against import surges like those that damaged American manufacturers in the late 1990's.</p>
        <p>The measures promised by the White House will not necessarily lead to new duties on foreign steel. But that the administration acted so quickly -- little more than a week after the industry appealed for help -- and without waiting for the industry to file formal charges through the  International Trade Commission, an independent federal agency, indicates how politically sensitive the perceptions of a steel crisis have become.</p>
        <p>''This is an unprecedented response; they jumped right into this,'' George Becker, president of the United Steelworkers of America, said of administration officials. ''They recognize that there is a crisis in the steel industry, and intend to do something about it.''</p>
        <p>Administration officials acknowledge that they acted with unusual speed but deny that they did so for political reasons. They say they have learned to move quickly when confronted with the possibility of a steel crisis because earlier episodes made clear that the industry could not withstand prolonged import surges without vast job losses.</p>
        <p>''This is not because of politics, but because there is real hardship and bankruptcies in the industry,'' said Gene Sperling, White House economic adviser. He said the actions were interim steps that could be taken while the administration researched  whether broader legal action was needed.</p>
        <p>The White House has so far resisted invoking a provision that would allow the president to impose blanket import restrictions temporarily if the International Trade Commission determines that imports have contributed heavily to the woes of domestic producers.</p>
