        <p>SBC Communications Inc., which is known to most of its customers as Ameritech, Southwestern Bell or Pacific Bell, asked the Federal Communications Commission for permission to sell long-distance service to its customers in Kansas and Oklahoma. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 allows local phone companies to enter the long-distance market on a state-by-state basis as they convince the F.C.C. that they have opened their local networks in those states. So far, Verizon Communications Inc. has been allowed to offer long distance in New York and SBC in Texas. SBC is known as an aggressive company, and yesterday's application was an aggressive regulatory move. There is less local phone competition in Kansas and Oklahoma than in either New York or Texas, so the commission's approval could set a new and potentially lower bar for the other Bells to clear.</p>
