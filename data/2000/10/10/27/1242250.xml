        <p>Newly optimistic because of polls suggesting that Representative Bob Franks has drawn within striking distance of Jon S. Corzine in the New Jersey race for the Senate, Republican officials in Washington released $600,000 today to help Mr. Franks pay for campaign commercials, meaning the long-lopsided Senate race could appear an even match on television in its final 12 days.</p>
        <p>The 11th-hour help, the maximum allowed by law, could be as important symbolically as it is practically. It will allow Mr. Franks to increase his television presence by about half.

        <p>Newly optimistic because of polls suggesting that Representative Bob Franks has drawn within striking distance of Jon S. Corzine in the New Jersey race for the Senate, Republican officials in Washington released $600,000 today to help Mr. Franks pay for campaign commercials, meaning the long-lopsided Senate race could appear an even match on television in its final 12 days.</p>
        <p>The 11th-hour help, the maximum allowed by law, could be as important symbolically as it is practically. It will allow Mr. Franks to increase his television presence by about half. But it is also meant to broadcast the party's sudden shift in outlook about Mr. Franks's chances of victory.</p>
        <p>''It's moved from a race that we had crossed our fingers and wished for, to a race that's eminently winnable,'' said Stuart Roy, a spokesman for Senator Mitch McConnell, chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee.</p>
        <p>Mr. Franks was ebullient on the campaign trail today, describing the race in David-and-Goliath terms. ''I'm a real happy man,'' he all but shouted into his cell phone to an Atlantic City radio talk-show host while warming up in his van between bursts of hand-shaking at a Morristown train station this morning. ''A clear perception is developing that momentum is wearing a Bob Franks jersey.''</p>
        <p>Still, even if Mr. Corzine's lead, according to one Quinnipiac University poll, has shrunk to five percentage points, that is a wide margin by the standards of recent statewide elections in New Jersey.</p>
        <p>And Mr. Corzine, the Democratic candidate, received his own boost today: After several newspaper opinion pages backed Mr. Franks earlier in the week, it was Mr. Corzine who received two glowing endorsements, one from The Times of Trenton and the other from The Daily News.</p>
        <p>''So much for the big momentum that we heard about yesterday,'' said Tom Shea, Mr. Corzine's spokesman.</p>
        <p>Moreover, though the new money from the Republican National Committee will help Mr. Franks to pull even on television, television is not everything, as was illustrated today when the candidates released their latest campaign-finance reports.</p>
        <p>As of Oct. 18, with three weeks to go in the campaign, Mr. Corzine had spent $52.8 million on his Senate bid, and was on track to spend at least $62 million by Election Day. By contrast, Mr. Franks's total campaign expenditures fell just short of $3.8 million.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine's campaign spent nearly $500,000 a day in the first 18 days of October, his report showed. Mr. Franks spent about $70,000 a day.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Corzine has now spent more than $11 million on television in the general election campaign, and is expected to purchase another $4 million or more in commercials before Nov. 7, his financial advantage may have a more pronounced effect in getting out the vote.</p>
        <p>Much of Mr. Corzine's expenses, indeed, included polling, printing and postage for direct mail advertisements, telephone calls to voters, and fees and expenses for consultants and labor organizers who will be crucial to what is expected to be a $3 million, statewide canvassing operation on Election Day.</p>
        <p>It remains possible, albeit unlikely, that Mr. Corzine, who so far has poured $52.7 million of his own money into his campaign, could match the $65.6 million that Ross Perot spent running for president in 1992.</p>
        <p>Both candidates spent today gearing up in one way or another for what is likely to be an arduous campaign homestretch. Mr. Franks is set to begin a 12-day bus tour on Friday. Mr. Corzine, meanwhile, spent the early evening rallying Democratic troops in South Jersey at the party's Camden County headquarters and at an event in Voorhees.</p>
        <p>Mr. Franks began his day in Morristown at 6:30 a.m. ''Something's going on,'' he said, in between shaking hands with New Jersey Transit riders. ''Wherever we've gone -- street fair, firehouse, what have you -- people are responding more than they did. They're saying, 'Stay in there,' and 'Run! Run!' There's a David and Goliath outlook.''</p>
        <p>Of course, Mr. Franks could not have picked a better place to start his day on a cheerful note. Morris County is a Republican stronghold, and the commuters he met seemed to have Mr. Franks's message down cold.</p>
        <p>''I made my mind up about two weeks ago: I'm going to vote for Bob Franks,'' said Valerie Haus, an editor and writer for a financial house in New York. ''Listening to Corzine talk and all the money he's spending just annoys me. The idea of buying a Senate seat is intolerable.''</p>
        <p>But not everyone was convinced. Hamilton McLean, an Internet consultant also headed for Manhattan, said: ''I've only followed it as far as all the money Corzine has spent on his campaign, but I don't think it changes anything. At least I know more about where Corzine stands.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine, meanwhile, spent the early part of his day along the Jersey Shore, beginning just before 7 a.m. at a foggy New Jersey Transit station in Middletown, the largest community in Monmouth County -- an electoral battleground that heavily favors Republicans but which Senator Robert G. Torricelli, a Democrat, nearly carried in 1996.</p>
        <p>After a relaxed breakfast with local Democratic officials at a small diner in Middletown, he visited a retirement community in Lakewood in Ocean County. It was his third campaign stop among the elderly this week.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine bristled a bit during brief remarks before about 15 people in a small theater in the community. One man asked Mr. Corzine if the millions he has spent on television ads was an attempt to control voters.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine responded that he was not about to follow people into the voting booths. ''I don't think I control people when they go behind the curtain,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Then, as he has said several times in recent campaign stops, Mr. Corzine said he was beholden to no special interest groups. ''I am going to owe nothing to anybody but you,'' he told the small crowd. ''I have not sold my soul to any pharmaceutical companies.''</p>
        <p>On the endorsement front, Mr. Corzine, who was scored in several newspaper editorials this week for his campaign spending, was given a welcome lift today when the opinion pages of The Daily News and The Times of Trenton both endorsed him. ''Corzine's economic savvy, social conscience and personal integrity will bring to the Senate qualities it sorely needs,'' The Daily News said, calling him ''truly a man of and for the 21st century.''</p>
