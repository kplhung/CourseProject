        <p>A Palestinian suicide bomber, heading on his bicycle toward an Israeli Army outpost in the Gaza Strip, succeeded only in killing himself this morning. But he raised considerable anxiety in Israel that the violence was shifting into a new phase of terrorism.</p>
        <p>As street clashes in the West Bank intensified slightly after a very calm Wednesday, Israelis settled into an edgy waiting period, wondering how both the conflict and the emergency reorganization of their government would progress.</p>
        <p>Islamic Jihad, a militant Gaza-based group, claimed responsibility for the attack in which 13 pounds of explosives apparently detonated prematurely.</p>
        <p>The 24-year-old cyclist was carrying them in a backpack as he pedaled, without being stopped, past an Israeli Army checkpoint toward the outpost at the entrance to the Jewish settlement of Kissufim.</p>
        <p>An Israeli Army spokesman, Capt. Michael Vromen, said the incident represented ''the most serious event in the past few weeks'' because a significant number of Israeli soldiers and civilians could have been killed.</p>
        <p>In Gaza, the bomber's brother, Yassin al-Arair, spoke with tears in his eyes about his brother Nabil's suicidal act as ''honor for our family.'' Nabil al-Arair, his family said, was a preschool secretary, a faithful Muslim and now a ''martyr.''</p>
        <p>Acting Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami, bleary-eyed after a nearly four-week-long conflict, said late this afternoon, ''Today -- was it today? -- the suicide bomb in the Gaza made real the sense that we are in a state of high alert.''</p>
        <p>Avoiding shopping malls and public buses, many Israelis were already taking familiar but rusty precautions for an attack inside Israel before today's explosion. And, despite escalating protests from Palestinians who feel as if they are living in a state of siege, the Israeli Army had already locked its borders with the West Bank and Gaza Strip.</p>
        <p>For the last two years, a successful cooperative relationship between Israeli and Palestinian security officials has largely kept terrorism at bay. But that relationship has completely broken down, and the Palestinian Authority has released from prison many suspected terrorists whom it had been holding at Israel's request.</p>
        <p>Sitting in a bunker-style government office, shaking his head, Mr. Ben-Ami lamented that Israel and the Palestinians seemed to be traveling backward in time. ''It's really futile,'' he said. ''Where does this all lead us? I am sure, back eventually to the peace table. Why then should we wait until we cross a river of blood to resume negotiations? It's really shameful.''</p>
        <p>Prime Minister Ehud Barak has suspended peace negotiations while the violence rages and while he tries to merge with the right-wing opposition to form an emergency government. With both the right and left raising serious objections, the merger negotiations are not going smoothly.</p>
        <p>Ariel Sharon, the Likud Party leader, worked simultaneously today to line up enough votes to topple the government and to make the merger work despite the opposition of many in his party. Talks have snagged on the issues of how power would be shared, but especially on whether Mr. Barak aims to return to peace talks -- and specifically the Camp David proposals -- if the violence abates.</p>
        <p>In a stormy Labor Party meeting, Mr. Barak, the party leader, sought to convince his colleagues that an emergency government would not signal a departure from their peacemaking platform. ''It is not a turning away from Oslo or Camp David or from anything else that we believe in,'' he said, pounding the table. ''Forming a national unity government does not mean that we're going to stop trying to make peace. It is not a war-mongering government.''</p>
        <p>Opposing the union, Yossi Beilin, the justice minister, invoked the memory of Yitzhak Rabin, the late prime minister. ''You came to power in order to continue the path of the man who was killed with the song of peace on his chest,'' Mr. Beilin told Mr. Barak.</p>
        <p>''Believe me, you don't need any advice from that man from the Lebanon war,'' he continued, referring to Mr. Sharon, who as Israel's defense minister led the invasion of Lebanon in 1982.</p>
        <p>Associates said that Mr. Barak, whose minority government is on the edge of collapse, knows a political merger would not survive a return to peacemaking.</p>
        <p>They say that he is seeking to buy himself a couple of months before new elections are called, and to save the country from the tumult of a campaign season while violence between the Israelis and Palestinians continues.</p>
        <p>If a unity government is not formed this week, the Israeli Parliament would likely vote to dissolve the government and move to hold new elections. It might hesitate to do so when it initially reconvenes next Monday if the violence persists. But experts believe that it would move quickly in that direction if no broad government were formed.</p>
        <p>Influencing their calculations, both Mr. Sharon and Mr. Barak have a mutual interest in keeping former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu politically sidelined. Mr. Netanyahu stepped down as the Likud's leader after he lost the last election to Mr. Barak, and Mr. Sharon took over in what he said would be a caretaker capacity. But Mr. Sharon is not eager to give up his power, and Mr. Barak is not eager to face Mr. Netanyahu in another campaign.</p>
        <p>Mr. Netanyahu is talking, though, as if he has made a decision to return to politics. Weighing in from Paris this week, Mr. Netanyahu said that if the conflict with the Palestinians eases, a unity government would make no sense. Mr. Barak's Labor Party and the Likud, he said, are pursuing different strategies for Israel's future -- Labor's ''continued diplomatic concessions,'' he said, as opposed to Likud's ''rehabilitating our power of deterrence and the strengthening of Israel.''</p>
        <p>It sounded like a campaign platform to most listeners, including former Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, a fellow rightist but not a fan of Mr. Netanyahu. ''The sea is the same sea,'' Mr. Shamir said today, ''the Arabs are the same Arabs, and Netanyahu has remained the same Netanyahu. I wouldn't want Netanyahu to again be Israel's prime minister.''</p>
