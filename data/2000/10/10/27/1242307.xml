        <p>A selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy Broadway and Off Broadway shows this weekend.

        <p>Broadway</p>
        <p>''THE DINNER PARTY.'' Neil Simon, in an experimental mood, has come up with one of the more bizarre mutants in theater history. This strained comedy about a gathering of mysteriously interconnected Parisians in an opulent restaurant is a French farce with a Brooklyn accent, a Strindbergian sexual slugfest with a laugh track. Those unfamiliar with Mr. Simon's earlier work could be forgiven for assuming that Doc, his professional nickname, is short for Dr. Moreau, H. G. Wells's hybrid-making mad scientist. Directed by John Rando with lots of verve and little subtlety, the play features plenty of those familiar Simon one-liners, which keep going off at the oddest moments like tardy kernels of popcorn. The prevailing mood, however, is rueful as the play considers the casualties of the sex wars. The result is as ungainly as an entrant in a three-legged race. The creditable cast features Henry Winkler, John Ritter and, most notably, Jan Maxwell, who provides something otherwise utterly lacking here: emotional verisimilitude (1:40). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $20 to $65 (Ben Brantley).</p>

        <p>+ ''GORE VIDAL'S 'THE BEST MAN.' '' Whatever the weaknesses of this unsteady revival, it definitely makes you wish Mr. Vidal had written the dialogue for the presidential debates. Despite the notoriously short shelf life of satire in the theater, this 1960 morality tale of a national political convention still rings with the whip cracks of abiding worldly wisdom dispensed in quips. At its best the play brings to the back-stabbing world of campaigning some of the fiery verbal artifice that the movies ''All About Eve'' and ''The Sweet Smell of Success'' brought to the back-stabbing worlds of show business and journalism. Unfortunately, what those movies have that this production does not is a rousing, melodramatic vigor. Led by Charles Durning, Spalding Gray and Christopher Noth, directed by Ethan McSweeney, the starry ensemble often feels frustratingly tentative. Despite fine work from Mr. Gray, Mr. Durning and Michael Learned, the show lacks the necessary conviction to be big (2:20). Virginia, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $40 to $75 (Brantley).</p>
        <p>* ''PROOF.'' An exhilarating and assured new play by David Auburn that turns the esoteric world of higher mathematics literally into a back-porch drama, as accessible and compelling as a detective story. A mystery about the authorship of a particularly important proof, it is also about twin enigmas: genius and love. Without any baffling erudition, the play presents mathematicians as both blessed and bedeviled by the gift for abstraction that ties them achingly to one another and separates them, also achingly, from concrete-minded folks like you and me. Perhaps most satisfying, it does so without a moment of meanness. As directed by Daniel Sullivan with the pace of a psychological thriller, and performed by an exemplary cast, most notably Mary-Louise Parker, the play reaches into the most competitive and difficult intellectual terrain and finds -- guess what? -- good people (2:00). Walter Kerr, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets, $24 to $69 (Bruce Weber).</p>
        <p>* ''THE TALE OF THE ALLERGIST'S WIFE.'' The hard-working demons who possessed little Linda Blair in ''The Exorcist'' have nothing on the forces raging within one Marjorie Taub, the title character of Charles Busch's window-rattling comedy of midlife malaise on the Upper West Side. Marjorie, avid culture consumer and avid self-flagellator, is played to spectacular effect by Linda Lavin, who turns feeling blue into a study in Technicolor. She is the volcanic center of a nimble sitcom of a play that pushes at the edges of its form without ripping through them. Mr. Busch, best known as the leading lady of his own camp fests, has swum into the mainstream. And with the help of Lynne Meadow's graceful, low-key direction and an assured cast that features Tony Roberts and Michele Lee, he stays comfortably afloat. The evening has its overly synthetic moments, and it doesn't quite know how to resolve itself, but with the fierce Ms. Lavin in charge, it earns its wall-to-wall laughs (2:15). Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m. Tickets, $30 to $70 (Brantley).</p>
        <p>Off Broadway</p>
        <p>+ ''THE BEGINNING OF AUGUST.'' Playing a less-than-merry widow in this somber screwball comedy by Tom Donaghy, Mary Steenburgen has that grown-up waif look that makes sane people run for cover. She's Little Orphan Annie with cleavage, a manicure and an aggressive air of neediness, bringing new resonance to the words ''dangerously vulnerable'' and cleverly subverting this actress's trademark wide-eyed goofiness. Unfortunately, Ms. Steenburgen is lodged in a preachy work that devotes more time to cultivating themes than characters. Mr. Donaghy, the gifted author of ''Minutes From the Blue Route,'' specializes in the fractured suburban family, but here he has found little new to say on the subject. And Neil Pepe's straightforward staging never quite makes sense of the play's shifts between barbed dialogues and self-explanatory soliloquies. With Garret Dillahunt as an obsessive-compulsive father and Mary McCann as a runaway mom (2:00). Atlantic Theater Company, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $35 to $40 (Brantley).</p>
        <p>+ ''THE GOREY DETAILS.'' A musical anthology of genially macabre stories by the writer and artist Edward Gorey, many of them from previous shows. As in many an omnibus, the skits are variously successful, and you'll be particularly impatient if you're the sort who waits for a punch line or a concluding moment. That isn't where Gorey's imagination flourished. A sudden death offered with a hapless shrug is the most frequent curtain-closer in these tales, which is of course the kind of philosophical resignation that informed most of his work. The humor is, rather, largely dependent on mood, the sense that in this peculiar world, with its atmosphere of a gleefully haunted house, life will go on in all its bizarre idiosyncrasy until it doesn't. It's hard, of course, to escape the poignant underscoring of Gorey's death in April, and in the end the show is something of an animated headstone, a memorial he would doubtless have appreciated (2:00). Century Center, 111 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2:30 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $45 (Weber).</p>
        <p>+ ''JUNO AND THE PAYCOCK.'' Things are grievously stressed in the tenement home of the Boyle family when the curtain goes up on Sean O'Casey's bitter drama set in 1922 Dublin, during the Irish civil war. Then they get worse. Jack, the wastrel patriarch, is out of work and determined to stay that way. His wife, Juno, is in a state of perpetual fury at his laziness, which keeps them living in squalor. Their son, Johnny, who lost an arm in the failed Easter rebellion against the English in 1916, is a beaten man, emotionally haunted and, as is slowly revealed, fatally compromised. The only hope in the family resides in the daughter, Mary, a pretty young woman intent on maintaining her appearance, improving her mind and working for the cause of labor. Alas, she is no match for the male-dominated forces at work, both in her nation and in the household, and before the play ends she sees her virtue and her future sacrificed to the mindless, irresponsible pride that the playwright decries as the pathetic lifeline of the historically bedeviled Irishman. Under the direction of John Crowley this new production takes a pointed but dramatically risky tack, beginning at a feverish height of tension and determinedly ratcheting it tighter. The strategy creates some clamorously insular performances, which hinders the ensemble work but also has its power. The palpable effect of living in perpetual crisis is bruisingly rendered here; it's a production that succeeds in stringing itself taut and that, even now, makes O'Casey's angry howl vibrate with credibility (2:15). Gramercy, 127 East 23rd Street, (212) 777-4900. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 7:30 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2:30 and 7:30 p.m.; Sundays at 2:30 p.m. Tickets: $55 (Weber).</p>
        <p>''LES MIZRAHI.'' That Isaac Mizrahi is now the star of his own cabaret act is perhaps inevitable. Mr. Mizrahi, the designer whose clothing company folded in 1998, came along at a time when fashion had become more about presentation than about clothes. And as he demonstrated in the documentary film ''Unzipped,'' he has charisma and wit to spare. But while the flamboyant, neurotic starlight he gave off in the movie is in evidence in this evening of songs, reminiscence, dissing and venting, Mr. Mizrahi hasn't quite found his rhythms onstage. He is at his best in action, whipping up a coat in muslin on a sewing machine or sketching dresses as he gossips. A stunningly simple, heartfelt rendition of ''Baubles, Bangles and Beads'' suggests that Mr. Mizrahi has the makings of a real cabaret artist (1:30). Greenwich House Theater, 27 Barrow Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Thursdays at 8 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays at 7 and 10 p.m. Tickets, $30 to $35 (Brantley).</p>
        <p>''STRANGER.'' Craig Lucas, the ever-questing author of ''Prelude to a Kiss'' and ''The Dying Gaul,'' gives an extreme and bleak portrait of a couple suggesting that at the heart of all relationships are the urges to torture and be hurt. Yet despite its harsh (if less than original) premise, this lurid tale of a man and a woman (played by David Strathairn and Kyra Sedgwick) who meet on an airplane feels dismally free of tension. It doesn't even compel as the sort of tabloid, police-blotter tale on which ''Stranger'' is a variation. And what should be a tantalizing series of nasty teases in plotting registers instead as a pre-mapped, much-traveled path. The vibrant Ms. Sedgwick is miscast. But Mr. Strathairn, who has a profound gift for finding the sounds in silence, is superb as a quiet man acutely aware of his capacity to harm (2:00). Vineyard, 108 East 15th Street, (212) 353-0303. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 5 and 9 p.m. Tickets, $45 (Brantley).</p>
        <p>* ''TEXTS FOR NOTHING.'' The head decomposes and recomposes, a flesh-shedding skull one instant and a smooth rubber mask the next; the voice abruptly shifts its tones and rhythms from the primal to the mechanical. There's not a special-effects man in Hollywood who can rival what Bill Irwin is doing with his own unadorned face and voice. The body, of course, provides an equally compelling vision. Anyone who has seen Mr. Irwin's singular brand of physical theater in shows like ''Fool Moon'' already knows about his gravity-defying walk and wayward limbs. But in ''Texts for Nothing,'' his magnificent one-man interpretation of four short prose pieces by Samuel Beckett, every natural tool at an actor's disposal is enlisted to chart the murky, eternally changing space between the womb and the tomb that is life according to Beckett. A splendidly funny and haunting evening, and finally less cerebral than deeply emotional (1:05). Classic Stage Company, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 677-4210. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets, $25 to $40.  (Brantley).</p>
        <p>Last Chance</p>
        <p>+ ''THE CRUMPLE ZONE.'' This new play by Buddy Thomas is uneven, but it has a lot going for it: a nicely structured plot about a gay household with a love triangle coming to crisis at Christmastime, sequences of physical comedy that are antic without being overblown into slapstick, and an effective set that evokes a pleasantly chintzy apartment on Staten Island. Most of all, though, it has a bristling, funny performance by Mario Cantone, who plays the squeaky wheel, a clamorously lonely man on the outside of the triangle looking in. Mr. Cantone is known for his high-pitched stand-up comedy work, and he knows how to take over a room. In this case the room is a tiny apartment, but he works it as a diva would. He's the kind of actor who seems most in control when he's in a tizzy, with a voice that easily and naturally runs up to shrill. But this is not a shrill performance. Even in high dudgeon there's no tension in Mr. Cantone's face or his body language, no sense of Method acting when he's working up to a fever pitch, just the wicked glee of a man who loves to seize the spotlight. The magnitude of his neurotic charisma in such a small space gives his character the hilariously keening pathos that makes the play work (2:00). Rattlestick Theater, 224 Waverly Place, near West 11th Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 206-1515. Through Sunday. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 3 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $39 and $45 (Weber).</p>
