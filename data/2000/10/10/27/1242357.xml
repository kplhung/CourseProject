        <p>The instant Mets center fielder Jay Payton saw the Yankees' Luis Sojo gently slap Al Leiter's 142nd pitch of the night up the middle with two out in the ninth, he sprinted forward as he watched the ball bounce past the pitcher's mound and between the lunging shortstop and second baseman.</p>
        <p>''I was hoping one of the infielder's could knock it down,'' Payton said. ''But I kept charging, just in case. It got through and I got it as fast as I could.''</p>
        <p>He reached the ball quickly, whipped a nearly perfect throw toward home plate with such force that he landed flat on his stomach. But with catcher Mike Piazza slightly out of position, tucked just behind the base path at the side of the plate, the ball hit the Yankees' Jorge Posada as he crossed in front of Piazza at home.</p>
        <p>On a wild ricochet that landed in the dugout, not only did Posada score the go-ahead run, Scott Brosius, who had reached on a two-out single, scored, as well. It was a devastating sequence of events for the Mets, who soon watched the Yankees celebrate.</p>
        <p>''I saw the ball wasn't hit hard,'' said Payton, who went 2 for 4 on the night and scored one run. ''I came as hard as I could and went flying to get the throw off. I left everything I had out on the field. I came charging, and if I missed it, I missed it. But I got it and thought it was going to be bang-bang. I guess I was a split-second late or something. It may have been right, but I thought it had a chance. Unfortunately, it hit Posada.''</p>
        <p>Payton was so close to saving the moment. The 26-year-old rookie who had persevered through repeated arm operations and gritted out five seasons in the minors was within an inch of becoming a folk lore hero for his strong throw home.</p>
        <p>''It's difficult to have a situation like that end the way it did, but busted my tail to get there, just wasn't enough,'' Payton said. ''But I think every one of us went all out, left every ounce of ourselves on the field. Al Leiter was great; he went out fighting, scraping to keep us going. No one has anything to hang thier heads about.</p>
        <p>''It's disappointing and a lot of the guys are upset. But we did everything we could. We just got out-played, I guess. We did a lot of great things as a team this year. We have a lot to be proud of.''</p>
