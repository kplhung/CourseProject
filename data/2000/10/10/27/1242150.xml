        <p>One of the more amply documented episodes in the history of 19th-century American art arises from the determination with which Thomas Sully, a portrait painter solidly established in Philadelphia, set out for London in November 1837.

        <p>He had jumped at an invitation from an anglophile society in Philadelphia, the Society of the Sons of Saint George.

        <p>One of the more amply documented episodes in the history of 19th-century American art arises from the determination with which Thomas Sully, a portrait painter solidly established in Philadelphia, set out for London in November 1837. He had one object: to paint a portrait of the very young Queen Victoria.</p>
        <p>He had jumped at an invitation from an anglophile society in Philadelphia, the Society of the Sons of Saint George. The group wanted a full-length portrait of Queen Victoria for its meeting room. Would he do it? Never one to turn down a good business proposition, he said, ''Yes, I will,'' and on Sept. 19, 1837, he and his young daughter set sail for London.</p>
        <p>He had then no high-level backing, no influential friends in London and no firm idea as to how he should get into Buckingham Palace and paint the portrait. But he didn't hesitate. What came of it is the subject of ''Queen Victoria and Thomas Sully'' at the Metropolitan Museum.</p>
        <p>For some years, the Met has had on loan from Mrs. Arthur A. Houghton Jr. a majestic full-length portrait of Queen Victoria by Sully, dated 1838. For the present show, Mrs. Houghton lent a large group of pencil studies for the portrait, together with a piece of ribbon that was given to Sully to make sure that he got the queen's height exactly right. (It was 61 inches, by the way.)</p>
        <p>But how did he do it? How did he succeed when English painters of repute were toadying to no purpose? The show includes a portrait of Sully by his American colleague Henry Inman that has much to tell us. Sully in his middle 50's was fine looking, well kept and clearly at home with himself. To see that portrait is to say to oneself, ''That man is nature's networker.''</p>
        <p>Sully had spent time in England in 1809 and had worked in the studio of Benjamin West, the American president of the Royal Academy. West was hospitality itself where a young fellow American was concerned, and Sully got a feel for the London art world that was to be very useful to him 30 years later. He also became friendly with Thomas Lawrence, the dazzling English portraitist of the day.</p>
        <p>Even so, he had some anxious days when he and his daughter reached London in November 1837. (One of the most touching things in the show is Sully's watercolor of the by no means luxurious rooms they rented in London. There is a purity and a simplicity in it that come as a relief from the continual high ambition that flavors his voluminous diaries.)</p>
        <p>With her coronation imminent, the queen was in enormous demand as a portrait sitter. She was even said to have sat on occasion for painters twice a day and two at a time.</p>
        <p>None of that deterred Sully, who at the time was 55 and had been in the portrait business for 30 years. It was a business that he knew in its every detail, from the closing of the deal to the elaborate moneymaking of subsidiary rights for copies, reproductions, prints and miscellaneous licensing. He knew how to capitalize on success, and the residuals from a portrait of Queen Victoria would be big money in the bank.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, he was very popular with his fellow painters in Britain. He charmed them, one and all. (He may have sometimes gone too far: anyone who says, as Sully did, that the work of a minor English painter, Thomas Stothard, ''has the excellence of Titian, without his faults'' is really going over the top.) He saw everything and everyone who might be of use. Colleagues who had painted the queen gave him good advice. ''Dress as if for a party,'' said one, ''and never start the conversation.''</p>
        <p>But it was not through his fellow painters that he got to Buckingham Palace. It was through word of mouth from people in high places. Sully was received by the prime minister, Lord Melbourne, when Melbourne was hardly out of bed, ''sipping his breakfast'' and not yet quite dressed. Sully also owed much to Lord Francis Egerton, in whose house he set eyes on the victor at Waterloo, the Duke of Wellington. These were people from whom one word would be enough.</p>
        <p>Progress was slow, but after four months in London the right person said the right word to the Lord Chancellor. One evening when he came home from dinner, Sully heard that the queen would see him the next morning.</p>
        <p>And so it happened that on March 22, 1838, Queen Victoria wrote in her diary, ''I sat to a Mr. Sully, a painter who is come from America to paint me.'' As her coronation was just three months away, Sully's first sitting could not have been better timed.</p>
        <p>Contrary to what is now often said, Sully was not a very distinguished portrait painter. All too often in painting women, he was dogged by what has been called ''his occasional misunderstandings of female anatomy.'' In plainer words, the body parts of the women don't always seem to fit together.</p>
        <p>But no such misunderstandings marred his full-length portrait of Queen Victoria. The queen's pose is both informal -- she looks over her shoulder toward us while walking upstairs -- and specifically regal, in that she drags behind her a robe and a long train. The image is both private and public, in ways that were to give it a huge popularity and an auxiliary life in the decorative arts and in baubles of many kinds. (Many of these can be seen at the Met.)</p>
        <p>As the present queen of England lent a smaller portrait of Queen Victoria by Sully to the exhibition, we can conclude that his visits to Buckingham Palace left a favorable impression.</p>
        <p>The exhibition was organized by Carrie Rebora Barratt, an associate curator at the Met. She is also the author of ''Queen Victoria and Thomas Sully'' (Princeton University Press), which draws extensively on the daily diaries that Sully kept. To anyone interested not only in the London art world of the 1830's but also in the social niceties of the time, Ms. Barratt's book will be fascinating. Sully reacts to the great world of London in a way that Anthony Trollope would have immortalized. This book is a genuine contribution to social history, and every word rings true as a self-portrait of a painter who was irresistibly on the rise.</p>
        <p>''Queen Victoria and Thomas Sully'' is at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, through Jan. 7. It will then travel to the Wallace Collection in London. A complementary show, ''Thomas Sully in the Metropolitan,'' is also on view through Jan. 7.</p>
