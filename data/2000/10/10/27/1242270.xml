        <p>Calling the actions of the Minnesota Timberwolves ''one of the most far-reaching frauds we've seen,'' David Stern, the National Basketball Association commissioner, yesterday did not rule out further punishment of the team and some of its officials for entering into a secret contract with forward Joe Smith.</p>
        <p>Speaking during his annual conference call with reporters before the season begins next week, Stern said he hoped to schedule hearings within two weeks with Glen Taylor, the Timberwolves' owner, and other team officials -- which may include their vice president, Kevin McHale, and Coach Flip Saunders -- to determine whether they will be suspended. Anyone in the organization found to have taken part in the deal could be suspended for up to a year.</p>

        <p>Calling the actions of the Minnesota Timberwolves ''one of the most far-reaching frauds we've seen,'' David Stern, the National Basketball Association commissioner, yesterday did not rule out further punishment of the team and some of its officials for entering into a secret contract with forward Joe Smith.</p>
        <p>Speaking during his annual conference call with reporters before the season begins next week, Stern said he hoped to schedule hearings within two weeks with Glen Taylor, the Timberwolves' owner, and other team officials -- which may include their vice president, Kevin McHale, and Coach Flip Saunders -- to determine whether they will be suspended. Anyone in the organization found to have taken part in the deal could be suspended for up to a year.</p>
        <p>Stern ruled on Wednesday that the Timberwolves would forfeit five first-round draft choices and fined the team $3.5 million for entering into the deal with Smith, which an arbitrator found was intended to circumvent the N.B.A. salary cap. He also voided Smith's current $2.5 million contract and his past two contracts with Minnesota, making him a free agent and preventing him from signing a lucrative contract with the club after this season.</p>
        <p>The fine and penalty were the harshest ever meted out by the N.B.A. to a player or team, and the stripping of multiple draft picks could decimate any plans Minnesota had of becoming an elite playoff team over the next decade.</p>
        <p>Taylor told The Associated Press last night that he accepted full responsibility for the contract. He said he did not realize when he made the agreement that he was breaking rules of the collective bargaining agreement and that unusual circumstances were involved that he would not reveal.</p>
        <p>The Timberwolves are tethered to Kevin Garnett's $126 million contract through the 2003-4 season. Without the ability to build through the draft or pursue top free agents, Minnesota's chances of putting a playoff team around Garnett have dwindled severely.</p>
        <p>Garnett told The Associated Press that Stern's decision would not affect whether he stays with the team when his contract expires.</p>
        <p>''It's very, very easy to jump ship when things get hard,'' Garnett said. ''It's very, very easy to start thinking differently. I'm not that type of person.''</p>
        <p>Apologizing to Timberwolves fans for ''being forced to take such action,'' Stern wondered why Taylor could have put the team at such risk.</p>
        <p>''The fact is, we gave this a lot more thought than the parties in the Minnesota franchise who risked their future by engaging in one of the most far-reaching frauds we've seen,'' Stern said. ''This was a fraud of major proportions. There were no fewer than five undisclosed contracts tucked away, hoping they'd never see the light of day. This is fraud that ripped to the heart of the collective bargaining agreement. The magnitude of this stuff is shocking.''</p>
        <p>Kenneth Dam, the arbitrator, ruled Monday that Minnesota signed a secret agreement with Smith in January 1999 worth as much as $86 million over seven years. The N.B.A., however, was presented with a one-year contract by the team for $1.75 million, the amount allowable under the salary cap. In September, the league obtained copies of both Smith's one-year and secret seven-year contracts.</p>
        <p>Several teams are clamoring to sign Smith, according to an Eastern Conference general manager who spoke on condition of anonymity.</p>
        <p>Stern seems intent on not having Smith play for the Timberwolves this season and asserted yesterday that the arbitrator gave him authority to void any deal between the player and the club. However, the Players Association disputes that interpretation.</p>
        <p>Union lawyers believe Stern has the authority only to void any deal that was the product of an undisclosed agreement and maintain that Smith can still sign with Minnesota.</p>
        <p>Smith's agent, Dan Fegan, did not return a call to his Santa Monica, Calif., office yesterday.</p>
        <p>Several N.B.A. executives, speaking on condition of anonymity, talked about the proliferation of under-the-table deals they said plagued the N.B.A. But Russ Granik, the deputy commissioner, said that neither he nor Stern had ever seen or heard of a  ''wink and nod'' of such proportion.</p>
        <p>''I think we all were shocked at the level of what went on here,'' Granik said. ''David and I have been around long enough not to be shocked by very much. I would be shocked to learn that something of this level has happened before. I think this is a totally different level.''</p>
