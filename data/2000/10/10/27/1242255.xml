        <p>Before most of the players had even teed off today, Tiger Woods was at five under par.</p>
        <p>Starting his early morning round with five consecutive birdies, Woods looked intent on winning the National Car Rental Golf Classic at Walt Disney World for the second year in a row and for the third time since 1996.</p>
        <p>Why wouldn't Woods love this tournament? He lives about a 20-minute ride from the golf course. His friends are in the gallery. And with the tournament played on two wide-open golf courses that enable players to use their drivers often, the event is tailor-made for low scores.</p>
        <p>Shooting a nine-under-par 63 at Disney's Palm course, Woods shared the first-round lead with Steve Flesch, a solid left-handed player who is looking for his first victory on the PGA Tour.</p>
        <p>Bill Glasson, seeking his first victory since 1997, was tied for third at 64 with Mike Springer, who is 171st on the money list and fighting to keep his Tour card. Flesch played on the Palm course; Glasson and Springer played on the Magnolia course.</p>
        <p>For Woods, a victory would be the latest addition to his incredible year. With nine victories this year, including his last three starts, Woods can become the first player to reach 10 victories in one season since Sam Snead won 11 times in 1950. And while Woods has already won a record-setting $8.26 million, he could become the first golfer to surpass $10 million in a season by winning the Tour Championship next week, as well as the American Express Championship next month in Spain.</p>
        <p>With those goals still on the table, Woods is not about to let up. And though he was happy with today's opening round, he thought he should have done better.</p>
        <p>''Any time you start off with five straight birdies, you feel like you can really do some damage,'' Woods said after his bogey-free round, which included nine birdies. ''It's hard to be disappointed with a 63. But if you are a little greedy, I could have made a couple more here and there.''</p>
        <p>It was an entertaining day for Woods's gallery; the world's No. 1 player was paired with Bob May, who lost to Woods in their sudden-death duel at the P.G.A. Championship in August. May played well again, shooting a 65 that included a 65-foot eagle putt on No. 16.</p>
        <p>Why does playing with Woods bring out the best in May?</p>
        <p>''It's fun playing with him,'' said May, who is 29th on the money list and looking to secure a spot in the Tour Championship, which is limited to the year's top 30 money winners. ''If he gets it going like he did today, hopefully you can get towed along. You see somebody playing good and putting good, it puts you in a positive frame of mind, too.''</p>
        <p>Woods's frame of mind could not have been better after his first five holes. Beginning his round on the 10th hole, he made a 10-footer for birdie. On the par-5 No. 11, Woods was forced to lay up on his second shot after missing the fairway with his drive. But his next shot was a beauty, a wedge from 109 yards that stopped 2 feet from the hole. Woods made the easy tap-in birdie putt.</p>
        <p>Then, on the par-3 No. 12, he hit a 5-iron tee shot that stopped 12 feet from the hole, and made that putt as well. On No. 13, Woods made a 12-footer for another birdie, and his streak continued at the par-5 No. 14.</p>
        <p>After hitting his second shot at No. 14 into the front right bunker, Woods hit a superb bunker shot that stopped 18 inches from the hole for another tap-in birdie.</p>
        <p>At that point, the gallery sensed it might be witnessing something special, perhaps a 59, or even lower. But Woods missed a 6-foot birdie putt at No. 15 that temporarily broke his momentum. Nevertheless, he added four birdies before his round ended, and finished the day in a familiar position: first place.</p>
        <p>''I felt pretty comfortable,'' said Woods, who played in the Presidents Cup last week after taking a six-week break. ''I felt that my game was coming back to where I left it five, six weeks ago.''</p>
