        <p>Re ''The Heat of the Game'' (Op-Ed, Oct. 26), by Lionel Tiger, about Roger Clemens and the broken bat he threw at Mike Piazza in Game 2 of the World Series:</p>
        <p>Part of professional athletes' social responsibility, in light of all of their visibility and financial compensation, should be to serve as role models. The Yankees and the Mets are professional baseball teams, not gangs. Professional sports are a way to entertain and provide positive outlets to channel aggression.</p>

        <p>Clemens is a great pitcher and probably works on his pitching skills a lot, but where he needs improvement is in his emotional windup and delivery.</p>
