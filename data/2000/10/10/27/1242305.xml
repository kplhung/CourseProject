        <p>The Women's United Soccer Association in New York has named Amster Yard in New York, part of the McCann-Erickson World Group unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies, to handle the introduction of the league, which is scheduled to begin play in April 2001. Billings were estimated at more than $5 million.</p>
        <p>The decision came after a review that had been narrowed to Amster Yard and five other finalists: Camp/ Arbues in San Francisco; Publicis &amp; Hal Riney in San Francisco, part of the Publicis Groupe S.A.; the Richards Group in Dallas; Wieden &amp; Kennedy in Portland, Ore.; and Wong Doody in Los Angeles and Seattle.</p>

        <p>Amster Yard, meanwhile, lost the account for Lugz shoes, sold by Jack Schwartz Shoes, which is leaving the agency by mutual agreement. Billings were estimated at less than $1 million. A new agency will be named soon.</p>
