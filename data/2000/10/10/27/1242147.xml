        <p>On 44th Street, the Algonquin has always held sway over the Iroquois next door. But the Iroquois, in the final phase of its transformation into a chic boutique hotel, has trumped its old rival. It has created a restaurant worth eating at.</p>
        <p>Triomphe, situated in the compact rooms that used to be Judy's, is ambitious in a modest way, which suits its dimensions. The main dining room has a mere 11 tables and even the oversize mirrors on one wall can't really create the illusion of space. The sleek, semicircular bar in the front room can probably handle about six customers before things get out of hand.</p>

        <p>On 44th Street, the Algonquin has always held sway over the Iroquois next door. But the Iroquois, in the final phase of its transformation into a chic boutique hotel, has trumped its old rival. It has created a restaurant worth eating at.</p>
        <p>Triomphe, situated in the compact rooms that used to be Judy's, is ambitious in a modest way, which suits its dimensions. The main dining room has a mere 11 tables and even the oversize mirrors on one wall can't really create the illusion of space. The sleek, semicircular bar in the front room can probably handle about six customers before things get out of hand.</p>
        <p>But there's nothing puny about the food. Steven Sobel, formerly of Sign of the Dove, manages to give his dishes the little twist that adds distinction.</p>
        <p>It might be the chewy brioche croutons in his thick, briny oyster stew, flavored with vermouth. Or it might be the crepe ribbons in his winter-worthy braised rabbit in burgundy, adorned with mushrooms, pearl onions and barely cooked baby carrots (with better luck, the rabbit would have been nibbling them). Halibut, a fish whose meaty texture tempts chefs to lob the heavy artillery, gets a light Asian treatment here. It rests on a bed of fragrant jasmine rice, intertwined with strips of grilled leek and surrounded by an aromatic salad of green papaya and mint dressed with ginger-chili marinade.</p>
        <p>The menu is tightly edited but enticing, with appetizers like acorn squash wontons in herbed broth, and scallops served with cauliflower puree, sauteed green onions and white truffle oil. Main courses include New Zealand lamb with white beans, Swiss chard and pancetta crisps; roasted chicken with artichokes, lardons and spinach tomato butter; and salmon in a caviar beurre blanc with grilled shrimp and parsnip whipped potatoes.</p>
        <p>The dessert menu looks ordinary, but it pays to read the fine print. A poached Bosc pear, for example, comes with a small round of chestnut pound cake that is split in half, stuffed with whipped cream and surrounded by espresso-flavored creme anglaise. The pear may look big, but the little guy runs away with the show.</p>
        <p>Triomphe, 49 West 44th Street, Manhattan; (212) 453-4233. Dinner entrees, $23 to $27.</p>
