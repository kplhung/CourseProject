        <p>The scariest thing about ''Level 9,'' a slick new cybercop series that has its premiere tonight on UPN, is that it gives no clue which of the dazzling technologies in its stories actually exist and which are made up.</p>
        <p>Could someone parked in a car outside your house really tap into your home security system and use its motion detectors to tell which room you're in? Are satellites in fact taking pictures of us every 15 seconds and can they really zoom in on individual vehicles? Could a hacker indeed seize control of the nation's air traffic control system?</p>

        <p>The scariest thing about ''Level 9,'' a slick new cybercop series that has its premiere tonight on UPN, is that it gives no clue which of the dazzling technologies in its stories actually exist and which are made up.</p>
        <p>Could someone parked in a car outside your house really tap into your home security system and use its motion detectors to tell which room you're in? Are satellites in fact taking pictures of us every 15 seconds and can they really zoom in on individual vehicles? Could a hacker indeed seize control of the nation's air traffic control system?</p>
        <p>Level 9 is a supersecret group of technological wizards drawn from various federal agencies and given a ''BAM'' mandate -- ''by any means'' -- to deal with cyberterrorism and such. It is led by Annie Price (Kate Hodge), a former F.B.I. agent who was once burned by a hacker and is now on a no-nonsense mission to make up for it.</p>
        <p>Her half-dozen underlings include tracking experts, eavesdroppers and, of course, laptop jockeys. A strength of the show is that even though some of these characters are given looks that flirt with geek and cyberpunk stereotypes, they're all given personalities as well. It's as likable a bunch as you could want to have listening in on your conversations.</p>
        <p>The brain trust behind the show is an interesting one, consisting of John Sacret Young, a creator of ''China Beach''; Michael Connelly, a crime novelist; and Josh Meyer, a journalist who has covered cybercrime. They seem to have an ear for keeping things moving briskly without leaving the computer-illiterate behind.</p>
        <p>In the opening episode, hackers have cracked into the federal Witness Protection Program's database and put the identities and addresses of those in it up for sale on the Internet.</p>
        <p>This turns out to be the work of the elusive CrayZhorse, a master hacker who leads a group of malcontents called the Great Uprising.</p>
        <p>CrayZhorse is particularly interested in one protected witness and has her kidnapped. A Los Angeles police detective named Burrows (Tim Guinee), investigating her disappearance, stumbles upon Level 9, and Price has to let him in on some of the unit's secrets.</p>
        <p>The show is pulsating and foreboding, yet it doesn't take itself too seriously, flashing an occasional sense of humor. When the detective marvels that Level 9 has identified the kidnapper even though he left no fingerprints, Jargon (Esteban Powell) and Sosh (Kim Murphy), Level 9's techies, say in self-parody: ''Prints? We don't need no stinking prints.''</p>
        <p>The humor notwithstanding, anyone even slightly susceptible to paranoia will be on full alert after watching 15 minutes of ''Level 9,'' not so much because of the bad guys as because of the good guys, who seem able to peer in on anyone anywhere (except, of course, CrayZhorse). ''Go ahead,'' a savvy friend tells the still skeptical Burrows early in the show, ''underestimate the level of unauthorized government surveillance.'' We hear the conversation because Level 9 is eavesdropping on it.</p>
        <p>But we hear only a few snatches of it because the savvy friend is wearing a personal jamming device that thwarts the government peepers. It's unclear what form this personal jammer takes -- a tasteful tie clip? a fashionable pendant? -- but if this well-made show catches on, there's going to be a run on them down at the local spy-vs.-spy shop.</p>
        <p>THE LAST DANCE  CBS, Sunday night at 9</p>
        <p>The world portrayed in ''The Last Dance,'' Sunday's pleasantly smarmy television movie on CBS, is an almost perfect place.</p>
        <p>It's a world where a long-retired teacher (Maureen O'Hara) who checks into the hospital doesn't just remember the former student who is her nurse (Eric Stolz) but also recalls a specific paper he wrote. It's a world where the nurse and his lovely wife (Trini Alvarado) adopt an old lady who would otherwise die alone and where their irritating children are actually interested in her stories from the 1940's. It's a world where old people with fatal diseases look as great as Maureen O'Hara and where, when her character starts giving away the junk in her cluttered house, people actually want it.</p>
        <p>The only thing not perfect is this: we're asked to believe that Ms. O'Hara's Cicero-quoting character is a vibrant, articulate person but that she hasn't read a newspaper since the Truman administration. She's surprised that high schools have metal detectors and that the beach isn't idyllic anymore and that the old hotel of her courting days was torn down years ago. This is an insulting view of the elderly, but the ''Touched by an Angel'' crowd, at whom this film is aimed, will be too busy reaching for hankies to notice.</p>
        <p>LEVEL 9  UPN, tonight at 9  (Channel 9 in New York)</p>
        <p>Michael Connelly and Josh Meyer, creators and consulting producers; John Mankiewicz and Aaron Lipstadt, co-executive producers;  John Sacret Young, executive producer. Produced by Paramount Network Television.</p>
