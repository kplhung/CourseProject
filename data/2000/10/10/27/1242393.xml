        <p>The Yankees maintained their pre-eminence in New York last night, finishing off the Mets in the Subway Series by rallying in the ninth inning of Game 5, and established their place among the greatest baseball dynasties by winning their third consecutive title.</p>
        <p>Luis Sojo slapped a rolling single off the Mets' starting pitcher, Al Leiter, with two outs in the top of the ninth to score Jorge Posada with the tie-breaking run, and when the throw home bounced off Posada and rolled into the Mets' dugout, Scott Brosius also scored. The Yankees won, 4-2, at Shea Stadium, finishing off a breathless World Series in which three games were decided by one run, two others by two runs.</p>
        <p>When Mike Piazza flied out to deep center field to end the game -- coming within 15 feet or so of hitting a game-tying home run -- center fielder Bernie Williams dropped to a knee in prayer, then jumped and hugged left fielder Clay Bellinger, as teammates rushed from the Yankees' dugout to swarm the infield, to join the closer Mariano Rivera, and Derek Jeter, the World Series most valuable player, and the rest.</p>
        <p>Some players lifted Manager Joe Torre onto their shoulders and carried him off the field; the principal owner, George Steinbrenner, watching the final out in the clubhouse, burst into tears. ''The Mets gave us everything we could want,'' he said, ''and it was great for New York.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees recovered from seven consecutive losses at the end of the regular season and scares in the first two rounds of the playoffs to become the first team since the 1972-74 Oakland Athletics to win three consecutive championships, the first team since the advent of free agency, a change that has made it far more difficult for teams to maintain continuity.</p>
        <p>After winning the World Series 25 times in the 1900's, the Yankees have won again.</p>
        <p>The Mets advanced further into the postseason than they had in more than a decade, and there will be some solace in that. But for their fans, this is the worst imaginable fate: not only did the Mets lose the World Series, but they were also beaten by their cross-city rivals; this was the big brother whipping the little brother in a snowball fight and then rubbing his face in the slush, an indelible memory that can be mitigated only by revenge that may not come for years, or may never come.</p>
        <p>''There are a lot of heavy hearts in that clubhouse,'' Mets Manager Bobby Valentine said, ''and I have a heavy heart with them.''</p>
        <p>The Mets were in position to win this game, as they were in all the games. The Yankees misplayed a surprise bunt by Leiter in the second inning and the Mets scored twice, taking a 2-1 lead; Williams had homered in the top of the second, breaking a streak of 22 consecutive hitless at-bats.</p>
        <p>Trying to lead the Mets back into the Series, Leiter pitched aggressively, brushing back both Paul O'Neill and David Justice early. He drove back Jeter with a fastball in the sixth inning, and Jeter -- who led off Game 3 with a homer and later tripled -- bashed a game-tying homer, sending the ball into the back of the visitors' bullpen in left field.</p>
        <p>Andy Pettitte pitched the first seven innings for the Yankees and was relieved by Mike Stanton in the eighth, the score still tied at 2-2. Leiter threw 121 pitches in the first eight innings, but just as Yankees Manager Joe Torre stuck with Orlando Hernandez in the Yankees' Game 3 loss, Valentine stayed with his ace, and Leiter struck out Tino Martinez and O'Neill to start the ninth inning. ''I thought he was looking good at that point,'' Valentine said.</p>
        <p>But Posada fouled off three pitches with two strikes and coaxed a walk from Leiter, on his 138th pitch. Brosius lined a single to left on Leiter's 141st pitch -- six more pitches than Leiter had thrown in any other game this season -- and Posada stopped at second.</p>
        <p>John Franco was warming up in the bullpen for the Mets, ready to come in; Valentine was somewhat concerned about calling on Franco for a third straight day, for Franco pitched in Games 3 and 4.</p>
        <p>Sojo, who had entered the game in the eighth inning, was due to bat. But then Glenallen Hill stepped out of the Yankees' dugout, with 6 hits in 13 career at-bats against Franco, including three homers, and stood in the on-deck circle. Valentine considered his options: the tiring Leiter against Sojo or Franco, knowing that Hill could be used to pinch-hit for Sojo.</p>
        <p>Valentine stuck with Leiter, who threw a fastball to Sojo -- one of a horde of players acquired during the season by the Yankees' front office -- and Sojo bounced Leiter's 142nd pitch through the middle, a bounding ball.</p>
        <p>''I said to El Duque, 'I want to hit with a man on base,' '' Sojo said. He said the first-base coach, Lee Mazzilli, told him, ''Stay back, trust your hands, try to hit the ball up the middle.'</p>
        <p>''All my career,'' Sojo said, ''I don't hit Al Leiter good.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees' players rushed forward from the dugout, to the front steps, the whole play in front of them. Posada rounded third and looked over his left shoulder to see whether he might be able to beat the throw from center fielder Jay Payton. The ball and the runner would arrive at the same time.</p>
        <p>Waiting at the plate for the throw, Piazza had to make a choice in a millisecond. He could either hold his ground and try to block home, or he could step out in front of the plate and reach for the throw and give Posada an opening to slide across the plate.</p>
        <p>Piazza planted himself on the baseline, Posada veered toward the mound and the throw hit him and skipped into the Mets' dugout. Brosius was waved home by the umpires, though Valentine would argue about whether Brosius should have been awarded the extra base.</p>
        <p>Now Rivera jogged in from the bullpen to pitch the ninth inning. Players on other teams believe he has been the difference between the Yankees' being a great team, like the Atlanta Braves, and a team that wins the championship every year. Rivera, his fastball juiced a couple of miles an hour faster than in Game 4 by the adrenaline, struck out the pinch-hitter Darryl Hamilton.</p>
        <p>He walked Benny Agbayani, but Edgardo Alfonzo flied to right. Agbayani, uncontested by the Yankees, had advanced to third by this point, and Piazza went to the plate as the potential tying run. Jeter went to the mound, slapped Rivera with his glove, probably telling him he was the best and to finish it off, something Jeter tells him all the time.</p>
        <p>Rivera fired a fastball, and Piazza -- who had just missed several high fastballs during this Series -- blistered a high drive toward center field, a baseball riding a home run parabola. ''Nooo!'' Torre shouted in the dugout.</p>
        <p>But Williams said: ''I knew right away. I knew he didn't hit it.''</p>
        <p>Williams ran back toward the wall, then turned, set himself and made the catch, and at midnight, the first Subway Series in 44 years was over. The Yankees went crazy. Rivera turned and raised his arms and jumped, until Martinez reached him, and Posada; O'Neill ran in from right field, glancing at the sky, on the first anniversary of his father's death; Jeter and Sojo were hugging near second base, and Torre was in the dugout, hugging his coaches. After Torre was hoisted on his players' shoulders, he walked to the stands and summoned his wife, and they embraced and kissed, Torre's eyes watering.</p>
        <p>Steinbrenner has been emotional after each of the championships, but never more than he was last night, his mouth turned down as the championship trophy was handed to him, his words halted, tears running out of his eyes. It was a hard year for the Yankees, Torre said time and again as they straggled through the regular season, through the playoffs. They played poorly early, there were trade talks about Sammy Sosa and Juan Gonzalez, until Justice and Denny Neagle and others all came over and contributed and stabilized the team, before that late-season slump made them all doubt, just a little, about whether this was possible.</p>
        <p>''I'd be lying if I said this one wasn't more gratifying,'' Jeter said. ''I mean, we struggled this year. We had tough times.''</p>
        <p>Posada said, ''They don't get old, I'm telling you that.''</p>
        <p>A half hour after the game, many of the Yankees began to stream out of the clubhouse and onto the field, their shirts soaked with Champagne, and they held the championship trophy aloft, Roger Clemens and O'Neill and others. Fans who remained at Shea Stadium chanted O'Neill's named and thanked him, thanked all of them. Four titles in five years, a city's dynasty.</p>
