        <p>Midway through the season, the Yankees were struggling and everyone knew something was missing. Derek Jeter and Bernie Williams approached Brian Cashman, the general manager, and were blunt. They wanted Luis Sojo back.</p>
        <p>''Players and their wives came up to me and said, 'You've got to get Louie back,' '' Cashman recalled. ''Bernie's wife came up to me and said, 'You've got to get Louie and Louie's wife back.' ''</p>
        <p>In a business sometimes known for self-centered stars, Sojo is exceptional. He is a veteran utility infielder who fills in at a lot of positions, and helps form bonds off the field.</p>
        <p>''They truly love him as a friend and as a teammate,'' Cashman said of Sojo's teammates. ''He's made for our clubhouse.''</p>
        <p>Sojo is also made for the field and the batter's box. After entering the game at Shea Stadium last night as a defensive replacement in the eighth inning, Sojo batted for the first time in the ninth inning with two on and two out against the Mets' Game 5 starter, Al Leiter.</p>
        <p>His ground single through the middle scored what proved to be the World Series-winning run in the Yankees' 4-2 victory.</p>
        <p>''This is the happiest day of my life,'' Sojo said, moments after the game. A year ago, he was a member of the Yankees when they swept the Atlanta Braves. Sojo missed some of that Series to attend the funeral of his father.</p>
        <p>Referring to him last night, he looked up to the night sky and sent his fondest greetings to ''my dad up there.''</p>
        <p>He stood on the field, the sounds of celebration everywhere. Above the Yankee dugout a group of fans chanted: ''LU-is SO-jo! LU-is SO-jo!'' A television producer demanding an interview got two New York City police officers to help him pull Sojo away from a group of about three dozen reporters. After a few tugs, the officers backed off and smiled.</p>
        <p>''I thought I might have to retire,'' said Sojo, who is 34. ''And here I am talking to you guys and having a great time. We are going to have a big party tonight. I will enjoy every moment.''</p>
        <p>After last season, Sojo was not re-signed by the Yankees, and he moved to Pittsburgh during the off-season. He was placed on waivers by the Pirates around midseason and he figured his career might be over.</p>
        <p>He told his wife, Zulima, to prepare for his retirement. They were eating dinner with their children in a Chinese restaurant in August when the cell phone rang. It was Cashman. The Yankees got him back in a trade for a minor league pitcher, Chris Spurling. ''My family started screaming in the restaurant,'' Sojo said. ''We left the food there and we went to my apartment to get everybody ready. It was the moment we were waiting for for two months. Finally, it happened. I was in Pittsburgh, but my heart was in New York.''</p>
        <p>During the playoffs this month, Sojo took over the second base job for Chuck Knoblauch, whose throwing problems made it difficult for Manager Joe Torre to play him in the field. Sojo's most embarrassing moment came in the division series, against Oakland, when he tripped over his own feet while fielding a grounder. It was indicative of his teammates' regard that he was greeted in the dugout with good-natured ribbing. He responded with many embarrassed smiles.</p>
        <p>A husky man whose physique is not the most athletic in professional sports, Sojo projects an easy, approachable manner that endears him to fans and reporters as well as teammates.</p>
        <p>But when the World Series began, Sojo found himself on the bench because Jose Vizcaino had a productive record against the Mets' Leiter, who started two of the games. Sojo played as a replacement in the first two games, and was back in the lineup as a starter, with one hit, in the fourth game.</p>
        <p>Last night he was a hero.</p>
        <p>''I don't know how to explain this moment,'' he said. ''It is a dream come true.''</p>
        <p>In the corridor outside the clubhouse, Zulima Sojo and Waleska Williams, the wife of Bernie, were waiting and hugging. Waleska said: ''Luis is the heart of the Latin group on the team. I told the Yankees, You took our heart away when you let Luis go. My husband and I were crying. We were praying, we were really praying to get him back. I love Luis. I couldn't be happier for him. What a story this is!''</p>
        <p>Zulima Sojo added: ''I knew Luis was going to be the hero tonight. I could feel it coming.''</p>
        <p>Then she and her friend, arm in arm, skipped down the corridor to find their champion husbands.</p>
