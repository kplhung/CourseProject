      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Just when it seemed as if Barbara Cook had achieved a plateau of vocal perfection reached by only a handful of cabaret performers, this great American singer, who turned 73 on Wednesday, has made another artistic leap forward. The conceptual seed of her new show, which plays through Nov. 25 at Feinstein's at the Regency, is a recent article in The New York Times Magazine in which  Stephen Sondheim named songs he  wished he had written.</p>
        <p>From that list, Ms. Cook has astutely chosen a program that includes, in addition to classic ballads by Harold Arlen (''I Had Myself a True Love'') and Irving Berlin (''I Got Lost in His Arms''), such vigorous early 20th century tub-thumpers as ''Waiting for the Robert E. Lee'' and ''Hard-Hearted Hannah.'' To these she has added seven Sondheim songs, from the frantically tongue-twisting (''Everybody Says Don't,'' ''You Could Drive a Person Crazy'') to the heartbreaking (''Not a Day Goes By,'' ''Losing My Mind'').</p>

        <p>Just when it seemed as if Barbara Cook had achieved a plateau of vocal perfection reached by only a handful of cabaret performers, this great American singer, who turned 73 on Wednesday, has made another artistic leap forward. The conceptual seed of her new show, which plays through Nov. 25 at Feinstein's at the Regency, is a recent article in The New York Times Magazine in which  Stephen Sondheim named songs he  wished he had written.</p>
        <p>From that list, Ms. Cook has astutely chosen a program that includes, in addition to classic ballads by Harold Arlen (''I Had Myself a True Love'') and Irving Berlin (''I Got Lost in His Arms''), such vigorous early 20th century tub-thumpers as ''Waiting for the Robert E. Lee'' and ''Hard-Hearted Hannah.'' To these she has added seven Sondheim songs, from the frantically tongue-twisting (''Everybody Says Don't,'' ''You Could Drive a Person Crazy'') to the heartbreaking (''Not a Day Goes By,'' ''Losing My Mind'').</p>
        <p>A relative latecomer to Mr. Sondheim's music, Ms. Cook didn't begin investigating his songs until 1985,  when she sang the role of Sally in ''Follies in Concert.'' The chemistry of Ms. Cook's voice -- beautiful, aching and inflected with autumnal shades and rustlings -- and Mr. Sondheim's songs, which take a long view of life and death in the midst of furious emotional turmoil, is quietly shattering.</p>
        <p>Where other singers might focus on the details of Mr. Sondheim's wordplay or pump up the high drama in his emotionally fraught songs, Ms. Cook simultaneously lives inside the lyrics and sees beyond them. Her show's most exciting discoveries are two ballads, ''Happiness'' and ''Loving You,'' from the musical ''Passion,'' in which the composer's romantic minimalism and Ms. Cook's gift for distilling the essence of a song convey a profound empathy.</p>
