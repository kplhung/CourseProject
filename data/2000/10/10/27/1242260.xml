        <p>Shortly after announcing on Wednesday that AT&amp;T was going to split into four units, C. Michael Armstrong, the company's chairman, was asked in an interview if anything good would be lost as a result of the overhaul. He considered the question for at least 10 seconds, then responded, ''I can't think of anything.''</p>
        <p>But in fact, AT&amp;T may be losing something that if not necessarily good, has been a powerful force in its favor for more than 100 years: the fear that its size and power has inspired in competitors. The AT&amp;T-brand companies that remain after the breakup plan is completed by 2002 will be smaller than the AT&amp;T the communications world has known. And the competitive landscape will change accordingly.</p>
        <p>WorldCom, the nation's No. 2 long-distance company and AT&amp;T's main competitor for business customers, can only become more emboldened. The local phone companies, already formidable in wireless and eager to expand into long distance while continuing to roll out high-speed Internet services, will be countering AT&amp;T region by region and business by business. Even the merged AOL and Time Warner could end up as an AT&amp;T antagonist under certain circumstances.</p>
        <p>Many of the details, including the various units' contractual obligations to one another after the breakup, may not be known for months. Mr. Armstrong evidently means to stay to see the breakup plan through; he said as much during a news conference. But in 2003 he will turn 65, so it is doubtful that he will be on the job much beyond the breakup.</p>
        <p>By that point, though, the competitive implications of Wednesday's announcement will have become much clearer. Here is an early look at the competitive arena in each of the areas in which the new, smaller AT&amp;T's will be operating.</p>
        <p>CABLE -- The cable television operation that AT&amp;T intends to spin off as a separate company called AT&amp;T Broadband will still be the biggest cable company in the nation and still wield the formidable power of the AT&amp;T brand name.</p>
        <p>The unit will remain a leader in delivering high-speed Internet access, though it remains somewhat unclear how committed that unit will remain to offering local phone service over cable wires.</p>
        <p>In the local markets where it operates, the cable unit's core business -- television -- remains relatively safe. To be sure, the direct-broadcast satellite operations like DirecTV and EchoStar will remain aggressive. But the challenge they pose is negligible compared with the problem the cable unit would face if the Bell regional phone giants again became serious about television.</p>
        <p>Of course, the Bells have been down that road. In the mid-90's, they attracted a lot of attention expressing interest in getting into the video business. But the technology was premature and the Bells eventually decided that they would be better off spending their time acquiring one another and trying to get into the long-distance telephone business.</p>
        <p>City by city, the Bell companies will certainly continue to fight against the AT&amp;T cable business in offering high-speed Internet access. But the ability of the AT&amp;T cable unit to continue that battle will not be much affected by the spinoff; after the spinoff, the cable unit will continue to use the same tools of marketing and technology to advance its cable modem strategy as it used before.</p>
        <p>As for other cable companies, like the prospective AOL-Time Warner behemoth, it is important to keep in mind that the cable industry has long been more like a social club than a fight club. With their generally exclusive territories, there are few places where cable companies actually go head to head.</p>
        <p>The various cable operators have usually found that it makes more sense to make common cause in areas like lobbying than to battle one another. One possible way the AT&amp;T cable unit could find itself in conflict with AOL Time Warner, however, would be if AT&amp;T were to significantly expand its Excite@Home Internet content business and demand equal access for that information and entertainment on AOL Time Warner's cable systems.</p>
        <p>BUSINESS SERVICES -- WorldCom will remain competitor No. 1 for AT&amp;T's business services unit, which will be at the core of the remaining AT&amp;T. Since the company began operations in the 1980's, WorldCom and its predecessors have always been far more focused on serving business customers than has AT&amp;T. That is why WorldCom has the world's biggest Internet carrier, Uunet, as part of its portfolio. And that is why WorldCom, unlike AT&amp;T, is tearing up the streets of Europe to put in new fiber optic networks.</p>
        <p>When WorldCom acquired MCI in 1998, it inherited the MCI consumer long-distance business, but that was never where the company's heart was. Last week, it became clear that WorldCom was planning to spin off or issue a new tracking stock for its consumer business. [Page C6.]</p>
        <p>And yesterday, WorldCom said it would introduce a new business-oriented structure next week.</p>
        <p>Sprint is another competitor in the business services market, which may be the most profitable segment of the telecommunications industry. But Sprint cannot match the scale of WorldCom or AT&amp;T, and has had much less success serving the very biggest corporate clients.</p>
        <p>The Bell companies will certainly end up competing strongly at the top of the business services market, but they are limited by not yet being allowed to sell long-distance services, except in New York and Texas. Consequently, the Bells have not had the processes, product lines and people to provide all-in-one service to big corporate clients. Developing those necessary support elements may end up taking longer for the regional Bell companies than winning regulatory long-distance approval.</p>
        <p>An argument could be made that AT&amp;T's business services arm would be hurt by its separation from the AT&amp;T wireless business, since many business people use wireless phones. But not having a wireless unit has not appeared to significantly harm WorldCom. Besides, the selection of a wireless phone and wireless carrier is often an executive's personal choice, while the information system for his or her employer is a corporate decision.</p>
        <p>CONSUMER -- Perhaps the most intriguing piece of the company, AT&amp;T's consumer unit, will have to do some serious soul-searching to figure out just what it wants to be. The long-distance operation, which will dominate the the new AT&amp;T Consumer unit, is expected to see revenue shrink by more than 10 percent next year as the Bells get into that market and as prices continue to fall. AT&amp;T's Worldnet Internet-access operation, which is also to be part of the consumer unit, is unlikely to grow big enough to compensate for the erosion in the long-distance market.</p>
        <p>If it is any solace, similar problems are afflicting the consumer long-distance units at WorldCom and Sprint.</p>
        <p>But the consumer unit's new plan to offer high-speed Internet access using so-called digital subscriber line technology could provide a shot in the arm. To deliver D.S.L. service, which is carried by conventional telephone lines, AT&amp;T executives said yesterday that they would strongly consider working with outside companies like Covad, Rhythms and Northpoint, which have installed D.S.L. equipment in local phone offices around the country.</p>
        <p>Northpoint appears to be off the table; it is merging with the D.S.L. operation of Verizon -- the regional phone company created this summer by the merger of Bell Atlantic and GTE. But Covad and Rhythms may be fairly strong acquisition candidates for the AT&amp;T consumer unit. It does not hurt AT&amp;T that shares of those companies are low-priced right now, mainly because of the downdraft in telecommunications stocks.</p>
        <p>One potential problem, however, is that the consumer unit, with roughly $8 billion in cash flow, is likely to come away from the breakup with a big part of AT&amp;T's debt.</p>
        <p>The consumer unit will also bear almost the entire stock-dividend burden within the AT&amp;T constellation, as a way of keeping shareholders loyal. The wireless and cable units plan to pay no dividends, and the business services unit will pay a small one, if any.</p>
        <p>These dividend and debt obligations could hamper the company's ability to complete mergers or acquisitions.</p>
        <p>All the while, the Bell companies will continue their march into long distance. Verizon has signed up more than a million long-distance customers in New York since January, and SBC Communications has attracted more than a million in Texas since July.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Armstrong said on Wednesday, perhaps the most important factor affecting the consumer unit's long-distance prospects is how quickly the Federal Communications Commission allows the Bells into long distance in additional states. He said AT&amp;T had internal forecasts for that, but he was not sharing them.</p>
        <p>WIRELESS -- Just now, wireless appears to be the strongest unit at AT&amp;T. Despite its long-lamented coverage problems in the New York City area, the wireless unit serves almost the whole country and is adding customers at a torrid rate -- 750,000 in the third quarter alone.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, the wireless unit faces big competitors in Sprint, Verizon, Nextel, VoiceStream and the new Cingular joint venture of BellSouth and SBC, among others. And yet there is little reason to believe that the wireless business will much suffer from separation from the rest of AT&amp;T.</p>
        <p>It is true that AT&amp;T's long-distance operation has appeared to subsidize the wireless business in some ways; the wireless unit may end up paying more to the AT&amp;T parent for the use of its long-distance network. AT&amp;T said on Wednesday that the wireless unit had agreed to use AT&amp;T's network and brand for at least five years.</p>
        <p>But it would be a big surprise if John D. Zeglis, who runs the wireless unit, had not negotiated a deal under which the prices he pays would come down automatically as market prices fall. And in the end, he will be free to buy network capacity from anyone he wants to.</p>
        <p>Of course, this same freedom could end up sweeping the wireless unit (and the cable business, for that matter) out of the AT&amp;T family altogether. Once they are independent, the wireless and cable units will have an obligation to put their shareholders first, and if that means selling themselves to a traditional AT&amp;T competitor, so be it.</p>
