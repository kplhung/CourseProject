        <p>Officially, on their state-controlled television stations and in their newspapers, many Arab governments have turned down the volume this week on the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.</p>
        <p>But the tone -- one of unalloyed hostility toward Israel, deep distrust of American policy and certitude that the very survival of Muslim shrines in Jerusalem is at stake -- has remained as vigorous as it has been since the deadly clashes began almost a month ago.</p>
        <p>While the militant tone has been driven by the state media, it also mirrored the flood of public sympathy and political activity in support of the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.</p>
        <p>Long a distant and sometimes bothersome distraction for ordinary people in Arab countries, the Palestinian issue has become a daily fixation and a rallying point for a revival of pan-Arab nationalism, which had been dormant for decades.</p>
        <p>The fevered programming on nearly all Arab radio and television stations that began with the outbreak of violence at the end of September has eased off in the last few days. Archival film of Arab soldiers fighting Israelis in past wars is now shown only occasionally, and even the military songs of old have largely disappeared.</p>
        <p>But reminders of the conflict are everywhere, stirring a sense of solidarity, and if the grass-roots anger can be sustained, even at a low level, the impact on regional politics could be substantial.</p>
        <p>Although they show no signs of wanting to reach out to Israel now, for example, Arab leaders might find it hard to do so in the future. Attitudes toward the United States and American businesses in the region could also be permanently affected.</p>
        <p>In Jordan this week, the government ordered each of its 160,000 civil servants to donate one day's pay to a fund for what it called the Palestinian intifada, or uprising. In Egypt, many private companies and several government ministries have asked their workers to do the same.</p>
        <p>The Arab League conference in Cairo, which ended Sunday, had recommended that all Arabs give up a day's salary for the cause. It was a popular move, prompting the London-based newspaper Asharq al Awsat to describe the recommendation as ''a qualitative leap in cooperation between rulers and ruled in support of a cause, a cause which it is natural for citizens to view with zeal, and leaders to view with a measure of foresight and caution.''</p>
        <p>The bloodshed is still the leading  news in the region. Jordanian newspapers, serving a readership that has close family and business ties with Palestinians in the West Bank, print the names of every Palestinian casualty. Egyptian state radio has reduced but not eliminated its frequent broadcasts of old songs calling on Arabs to fight to recover Jerusalem from Israel. In Kuwait, the photographs of every Palestinian brought to hospitals in the country this week have been put on the front pages. Commentators have started using bluntly anti-Jewish language in articles about Israel.</p>
        <p>Arabic-language all-news satellite television stations have also continued to provide a platform for many of the most radical anti-Israel groups, which before the clashes had only limited audiences. Hezbollah, the Lebanese-based Islamic group that has called for war to drive Israel from the West Bank and Gaza Strip, also arranged to have its television station broadcast 24 hours a day on Arab satellite networks.</p>
        <p>The filmed death of Muhammad  al-Durra, the 12-year-old boy who was shot by Israeli soldiers in Gaza as he cowered next to his father, remains a staple image in the news media and on Arabic Internet sites.</p>
        <p>But in Cairo, unsolicited messages have also been showing up on mobile phones, urging people to boycott American products. ''We need your help to stop the murder of Palestinian women and children,'' the message says. ''Muhammad al-Durra! God is great!''</p>
        <p>Leaflets asking consumers to boycott American products have popped up in many countries. It is not clear that they have been followed in any organized fashion, but business people have expressed concern.</p>
        <p>''I think all our members are worried a lot,'' said Hisham Fahmy, executive director of the American Chamber of Commerce in Egypt.</p>
