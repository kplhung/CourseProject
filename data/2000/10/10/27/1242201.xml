        <p>AN agency responsible for perhaps the most notorious campaigns in the short, tempestuous history of Internet advertising, for the e-tailer Outpost.com, is taking on another high-risk, high-reward cyberassignment: promoting the substantial revamping of the Go.com Web site.</p>
        <p>The Go.com work is being introduced this week with a budget estimated at more than $30 million. It is produced by Cliff Freeman &amp; Partners in New York, which created the much-discussed campaign for Outpost.com, part of Cyberian Outpost, in 1998. That campaign featured wickedly funny television commercials centered on outrageous make-believe stunts like shooting gerbils from a cannon and unleashing wolves on a high school marching band.</p>
        <p>The Outpost.com spots, which won many awards for creativity, have come to symbolize the lengths to which dot-coms will go to draw attention to themselves -- attention that did not always necessarily result in generating sufficient revenue or profits. Sales of computers and other products on the Outpost.com site (www.outpost.com) improved after the stunt commercials were replaced with more prosaic pitches describing the merchandise available at the site and its policy of free overnight delivery.</p>
        <p>''That was a long time ago in Internet years, 100 years ago,'' said Arthur Bijur, president and executive creative director at Freeman in New York, which is also known for work for the Little Caesars pizza chain and Coca-Cola. ''Dot-com advertising has evolved a lot.''</p>
        <p>''Outpost.com was very much about getting the name out there and less about the content of the site,'' he added. ''This campaign is all about what you will find at Go.com.''</p>
        <p>And what computer users will find at the Go.com site (www.go.com) is markedly different from what had been offered when the site went up in December 1998. Originally, Go.com's parent, the Walt Disney Company, designed the site as an Internet portal intended to compete with the likes of America Online, Microsoft's MSN and Yahoo. It was at the center of a broad concept of a Go Network that linked all the Disney online services, including ABCNews.com, Disney .com and ESPN.com.</p>
        <p>But when Go proved unable to compete effectively against the far larger portals, executives who oversee Disney's Internet operations, now called the Walt Disney Internet Group, decided to narrow its focus. The site is now meant to serve as an Internet search engine for men and women 18 to 49, finding them relevant information about activities like entertainment, sports and travel.</p>
        <p>''Before, we had competed in the portal race, taking the stance 'You can do anything' and trying to appeal to everyone,'' said Doug De Vito, vice president for marketing at Go.com in North Hollywood, Calif.</p>
        <p>''While we were able to have a successful business, it was, however, not trending to a winning proposition,'' he added. ''We thought if there was something we could uniquely own, we'd have a strong, competitive advantage.''</p>
        <p>Shifting to what Mr. De Vito called ''the free-time market'' was a ''smart way to go,'' he said, for two reasons: ''consumers come to the Internet to get that exact type of information'' and it ''ties in with the offline and online assets'' of Disney.</p>
        <p>The Freeman campaign, including television and radio commercials and print advertisements, presents the Web site as ''Your guide to a better time'' by declaring: ''There's fun stuff all around you. You just have to know where to look.'' That is demonstrated by the device of having someone engaged in an everyday task like riding the subway, weeding the garden, walking around a farm or killing time at work surprised by a sudden encounter with an entertaining event like a circus, a concert or a sky-diving lesson.</p>
        <p>''There's a very simple message that's totally focused on the benefit of Go.com, what it is and what it does, which is pretty compelling,'' Mr. Bijur said.</p>
        <p>The campaign is funny, as the Outpost.com campaign was, but this time the hoped-for laughs are far more related to the purpose of the Web site. By comparison, it was difficult to determine what the offbeat images for Outpost.com had to do with buying software or cellular telephones online.</p>
        <p>''Finding a singer in the garden or a circus in the barn is a metaphor for how a search engine operates,'' Mr. De Vito said. The effectiveness of the device was demonstrated in testing the campaign, he added, which led him to ''feel very strongly consumers will not only pay attention but find it appealing, memorable and engaging.''</p>
        <p>The metaphor is not unlike one used by Freeman in 1995 -- which in Internet years must be 250 years ago if, as Mr. Bijur said, 1998 was 100 years ago -- for the content areas known as interest groups on the old Prodigy online service. In that campaign, the groups were depicted as buses filled with passengers all interested in a single topic like pets or fishing or music.</p>
        <p>There will also be online advertising to promote the revamp of Go .com, created in-house and by two San Francisco specialty shops, Pop Media and Tonic 360, which this week agreed to be acquired by the J. Walter Thompson unit of the WPP Group. In addition, elaborate promotional campaigns are planned with Go.com partners, both independent ones like Carsmart.com and Travelocity.com along with Disney-owned ones like Walt Disney World, ''Good Morning America'' and ESPN.</p>
        <p>For those nostalgic for outrageous Internet ads, there are what Mr. De Vito described as ''absurd'' jokes in the Go.com radio commercials, which use exaggeration for effect.</p>
        <p>For instance, in one spot, listeners are told that rather than using Go .com to find ''the best vacation and travel destinations,'' they could always ''crawl into the wheel well'' of a ''jumbo jet preparing to take off.''</p>
        <p>''Oh, and bring a parka,'' the announcer says in a perfectly deadpan manner, ''because at 34,000 feet, it's about 40 below zero.''</p>
        <p>Another radio spot pretends to suggest that an alternative to using Go.com for a man wanting to learn more about his ''favorite football team'' would be to impersonate a female cheerleader and trick a player into a romantic relationship. ''You'll soon get to know that sweaty, 300-pound lineman intimately,'' the announcer intones.</p>
        <p>The implication is clear that such a masquerade would be a fate worse than death. Some listeners, though, might consider it more favorably, perhaps as the blueprint for a movie script they could sell to the Touchstone division of Disney, updating ''Some Like It Hot'' by crossing ''Tootsie'' with ''Any Given Sunday.''</p>
