        <p>The National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League this week released a commercial, ''Think,'' that warns voters that a vote for Ralph Nader could help Gov. George W. Bush of Texas win the presidential election on Nov. 7.</p>
        <p>The advertisement is being released in closely contested states, starting with Minnesota, Oregon and Wisconsin, and will run until Election Day.</p>
        <p>PRODUCER -- Ratcliff Strategies.</p>
        <p>ON THE SCREEN -- The commercial begins with a photograph of Ralph Nader, the Green Party candidate for president, and the words ''Thinking of voting for Ralph Nader?'' followed by the exterior of the Supreme Court building with the words ''Narrow Decision protects Roe v. Wade.'' Then a picture of a statue outside the court of a man representing the authority of law, and the words ''A single vote.'' Then the interior of the courtroom and photos of Governor Bush and Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas. Mr. Bush's picture appears again, along with a gavel and the words ''Bush's Goal / End Legal Abortion.'' Then Mr. Nader's photo, Mr. Bush's photo and the Supreme Court exterior and finally the words  ''It's your choice.''</p>
        <p>SCRIPT -- The commercial is narrated by an announcer:</p>
        <p>''If you're thinking of voting for Ralph Nader, please consider: This year, a 5-to-4 Supreme Court decision narrowly protected Roe v. Wade. A single vote saved a woman's right to choose. As president, George Bush would reverse the Court with anti-choice Justices Scalia and Thomas in control. Bush's goal? Ending legal abortion. Voting for Ralph Nader helps elect George W. Bush. Before voting Nader, consider the risk. It's your choice.''</p>
        <p>ACCURACY -- Mixed. The 5-to-4 decision invalidated a Nebraska law on the late-term procedure that opponents call partial birth abortion, and some advocates of abortion rights have said this means that the underlying Roe v. Wade decision of 1973 is imperiled. But many students of the Court believe the Roe decision retains the support of six justices. Mr. Bush has said Justices Thomas and Scalia are the sort he would nominate. They believe Roe should be reversed, as does Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush has called for a constitutional amendment banning abortion except in cases of rape, incest or when the woman's life is threatened -- a policy that would prohibit almost all abortions. But he has also said he does not believe that an amendment will be enacted soon. In 1994, when he first ran for governor, he said, ''I do not like abortions; I will do everything in my power to restrict abortions.''</p>
        <p>SCORECARD -- This is a tough advertisement, translating the fears of abortion rights groups regarding Mr. Bush's attitude on abortion -- which he has kept almost invisible as he seeks to appeal to moderates -- into confident but unprovable predictions.</p>
