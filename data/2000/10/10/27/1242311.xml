        <p>Profit for Canada's largest airline, Air Canada, dipped 7 percent to 107 million Canadian dollars ($70.5 million) in the third quarter, the first period to include its former rival Canadian Airlines, acquired earlier this year. While share profit of 73 Canadian cents (48 cents), beat the latest 62-cent consensus estimate by First Call/Thomson Financial, it was well short of the 1.10 Canadian dollars (73 cents) several analysts expected before airline officials phoned them 10 days ago with a profit warning. Third-quarter revenue rose 11 percent, to 3.08 billion Canadian dollars ($2.03 billion), but higher fuel prices and the threat of a strike by Air Canada pilots cut expected operating income by a third.</p>
