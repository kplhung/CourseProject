        <p>Editorial endorses candidates in some New York Congressional races; backs Regina Seltzer, Democrat, in First District, Suffolk County; Steven Israel, Democrat, in Second District, Suffolk County; Rep Carolyn McCarthy, Democrat, in Fourth District, Nassau County; Larry Otis Graham, Democrat, in 19th District, parts of Westchester, Putnam, Dutchess and Orange counties</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>In most of New York's 31 Congressional races, the incumbents are heavily favored. But there is a hot contest for the Long Island seat held by Representative Rick Lazio before he left it to run for the Senate. Three other races for the House of Representatives also merit close attention.</p>
        <p>First District, Suffolk County: Representative Michael Forbes, who shed his Republican ties last year and became a Democrat, was defeated by 35 votes in this year's Democratic primary by a political outsider. The victor was Regina Seltzer, a retired school librarian who became a lawyer to tackle environmental issues in her community. A seasoned member of Brookhaven's planning board, Mrs. Seltzer has campaigned energetically, finding grass-roots support for her efforts on family planning and her criticism of recent cutbacks in the area by H.M.O.'s. Her opponent is Felix Grucci, a Republican who is Brookhaven's supervisor and head of the internationally famous fireworks business. Mr. Grucci has been faced with questions about his political mentor, John Powell, who was chairman of the Suffolk Republican Party and is now in jail for extortion. Local health officials are also investigating whether the Grucci family fireworks business has tainted ground water, and whether Mr. Grucci used public funds to pay for overtime at a school when Senator John McCain endorsed him. While Mrs. Seltzer has an uphill struggle in this race, she deserves to succeed and we endorse her.</p>

While Mrs. Seltzer has an uphill struggle in this race, she deserves to succeed and we endorse her.</p>
        <p>Second District, Suffolk County: The battle to replace Representative Lazio pits a Democrat, Steven Israel, the majority leader of the Huntington Town Board, against the Republican Joan Johnson, Islip's town clerk. Mrs. Johnson, who would be the first black woman elected to the House as a Republican, speaks on issues of equality and opportunity with admirable passion and conviction. She clearly offers an important asset to a national party struggling for more diversity. But Mr. Israel has an excellent grasp of local issues and a deeper understanding of national and international matters. He has a record of finding bipartisan solutions and deserves some credit for helping Suffolk avoid the budget problems now burdening Nassau County. Mrs. Johnson's unstructured views on taxes, school vouchers and abortion also raise questions about whether she would fall too easily in line with her party's stridently conservative leaders in the House. In this important race, we endorse Mr. Israel.</p>
        <p>Fourth District, Nassau County: This ought to be a safe seat for Representative Carolyn McCarthy, a Democrat who has become a vital national voice for gun control. Mrs. McCarthy won this Congressional seat in 1996, three years after a deranged gunman killed her husband and injured her son on the Long Island Rail Road. But this is a volatile district, and two years ago Gary Becker, the Republican and Right-to-Life candidate, came close to unseating her. Mr. Becker is back for a rematch, challenging Mrs. McCarthy from the far right on abortion and other issues. Mrs. McCarthy has steadily expanded her areas of expertise, adding care for the elderly and education issues to her repertoire. We back Mrs. McCarthy.</p>
        <p>19th District, parts of Westchester, Putnam, Dutchess and Orange counties: Representative Sue Kelly's credentials as a Republican moderate have begun to erode since she was first elected in 1994 and bravely bucked her party's conservative leadership. Although she supported campaign finance reform, her views have shifted on abortion as she supports narrowing the choices available. Her environmental record has slipped, leading the local League of Conservation Voters to withhold an endorsement she received in earlier campaigns. Her opponent, Larry Otis Graham, is a personable and intelligent campaigner with an impressive resume as lawyer, teacher and author. As a black journalist exploring racial issues, he became well known by going undercover as a waiter in a Connecticut country club to gather material for an article. More recently, he published a book on the black upper class. Mr. Graham has better stances not only on choice, but also gun control and education. We endorse Mr. Graham for this seat.</p>
