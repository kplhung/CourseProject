        <p>Market surveys by two major brokerage companies indicate that average sales prices for Manhattan apartments moderated a bit in this year's third quarter, with one report showing a 5 percent increase and the other -- coming off a record average price of almost $855,000 during the previous quarter -- indicating a 7.7 percent decline.</p>
        <p>Price increases at the luxury end remained strong, however.</p>
        <p>''My sense is that people have done a reality check and are more deliberate in their purchase decisions,'' said Jonathan Miller, president of Miller Samuel, an appraisal company that prepares one of the Manhattan reports, for the Douglas Elliman brokerage company.</p>
        <p>Even with its high-altitude price tags, the Manhattan market in the third quarter was a barometer of the wider economy, said James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University.</p>
        <p>''This is really consistent with the performance of the national and regional economy, where the long-awaited soft landing started to take effect in the third quarter,'' Dr. Hughes said. ''The first and second quarters of 2000 showed explosive growth, which slowed to simply strong growth in the third quarter -- but still a slowdown. So it's not surprising that this economic change was directly reflected in the Manhattan housing market.''</p>
        <p>In July, the Elliman survey of apartment sales below West 116th Street and East 96th Street reported a record average price of $854,704 in the second quarter. But the Elliman report released last week, for the period ended Sept. 30, indicated an average price of $789,225, a 7.7 percent drop. There were 2,089 sales surveyed for the new report.</p>
        <p>Mr. Miller pointed out that even with the decline, the third-quarter figure was up 38.7 percent from the average price of $569,005 at the end of 1999. ''The condo market, in particular, spiked during the prior quarters,'' he said, ''and now has resumed a more normal pattern.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Hughes welcomed the respite. ''The double-digit increases that we've had over the past year in Manhattan, if sustained, could ultimately yield a price bubble similar to what we experienced in the late 1980's,'' he said. ''The bursting of that bubble made the ensuing recession the worst downturn in the city since the Great Depression.''</p>
        <p>According to the second survey, the Corcoran report, which was released this week, the average price for apartments below 125th Street during the third quarter was $759,000, up 5 percent from $723,000 at the end of June and up 24 percent from $614,000 at the end of 1999.</p>
        <p>The surveys differ slightly in the neighborhoods they cover and the transactions they record. The Elliman report does not include condominiums, while the Corcoran report does.</p>
        <p>''Although the gains are still strong,'' said Barbara Corcoran, chairwoman of the Corcoran Group, ''it's a slower rate than in the first half of the year.''</p>
        <p>Asked what caused the slower rate, Ms. Corcoran said: ''People are exhausted by runaway prices. After looking at a handful of apartments for a lot of money, they are tired of saying: 'Is that all I can get?'</p>
        <p>''Also, there's a lot of change in the air: who will be the new president, what's going to happen with the stock market? Whenever there's a lot of change, people take a breath. They are praying that prices stop going up; thinking, 'Enough already.' And when enough people think that, they make it happen.''</p>
        <p>But there seems to be no brake on the high end of the market.</p>
        <p>In what the Corcoran report calls its super-luxury category -- apartments selling for more than $5 million -- the average price in the third quarter was $5,846,000, up 13 percent from $5,180,000 in December 1999. There were 145 super-luxury sales surveyed for the report. ''The most coveted apartment in Manhattan today is nine rooms and larger with a $4 million to $5 million price tag,'' Ms. Corcoran said.</p>
        <p>In the Elliman report, the average price of luxury co-ops in the third quarter was $2,621,667, a 12.7 percent increase over $2,325,850 at the end of 1999. The Elliman luxury survey was based on 117 co-op sales (of apartments with two or more bedrooms on Fifth Avenue, Park Avenue and Central Park West) in the third quarter. Neither report analyzed luxury sales on a quarterly basis because, Corcoran and Elliman officials said, the samples are small.</p>
        <p>In his assessment of the marketwide trends shown in the Elliman survey, Mr. Miller noted that besides average price, sales volume declined in the third quarter from the year-earlier quarter, dropping 15 percent, to to 2,089 transactions, from 2,447. But he attributed that slip in sales to factors other than lack of buyer interest.</p>
        <p>Citing what industry officials call the listing discount -- the difference between the last price listed by the seller and the actual sales price -- Mr. Miller said listing discounts averaged only 1.3 percent in the third quarter, ''which means apartments are still selling at just about full price.''</p>
        <p>''That tells me the decline in volume is attributable to the lack of inventory, not lack of interest,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Most new development in Manhattan has been aimed at the high-end market. ''As a result,'' Mr. Miller said, ''a building constructed today might contain 100 very large apartments whereas, if it was constructed in 1986, it might have had 300 units. So we have a lot fewer units coming on the market for entry-level and middle-level buyers. That's a factor in the decline in sales volume.</p>
        <p>''We're still seeing bidding wars.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  November 3, 2000, Friday  The Residential Real Estate column last Friday about two market surveys that showed a cooling in average sales prices for Manhattan apartments referred incorrectly to a sample used in one of them. The survey by the Douglas Elliman company omitted condominium sales in calculating average sales in the luxury apartment category only, not for all apartments in the study.</p>
