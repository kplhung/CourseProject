        <p>CERTAIN kinds of art are box office gold. Art made of gold is one. People are nuts about it. It's just one of those things.</p>
        <p>As it happens, there is a Fort Knox-size supply of the precious, malleable, untarnishable stuff in New York at the moment. The exhibition  ''The Golden Deer of Eurasia: Scythian and Sarmatian Treasures From the Russian Steppes'' is glowing away at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. And ''Gold of the Nomads: Scythian Treasures From Ancient Ukraine'' opens today at the Brooklyn Museum of Art.</p>
        <p>This overlap of shows on roughly the same subject was a scheduling fluke, but it works out fine. Together they offer a really substantial archaeological update on the last big Scythian showcase in these parts, the Met's popular ''From the Land of the Scythians'' 25 years ago. But they also come with contrasting attractions of their own.</p>
        <p>Brooklyn's ''Gold of the Nomads,'' organized by the Walters Art Gallery in Baltimore and the San Antonio Museum of Art, is a traveling, survey-style ''collections'' show giving United States audiences a first glimpse of 14-carat objects drawn from museums in Ukraine, where the Scythian nomads put down roots in the first millennium B.C.</p>
        <p>The Met also has museological rarities in the form of masterworks from the State Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg. But the focus here -- and it gives the proceedings a kind of treasure-hunt thrill -- is a cache of objects excavated fairly recently from tombs in Central Asia and belonging to non-Scythian people whose identity is something of a mystery.</p>
        <p>Not that the Scythians themselves are an open book; we don't know much about them. Horse-riding hunters and herders with a bellicose streak, they seem to have come from the mountains of western Siberia. From an early date, they were on the move westward. Around the seventh century B.C., they had contact with the Near East; Assyrian and Persian culture became part of their lively and eclectic art tradition. A bit later they settled in the area around the Black Sea that is now Ukraine.</p>
        <p>There they encountered Greek colonists, with whom they forged a working relationship. The Scythians took control of the east-to-west flow of grain and other staples into Greece itself, a profitable business. They gradually adopted a more sedentary lifestyle, embraced Greek culture and acquired sumptuous works of art, many of which ended up in tombs.</p>
        <p>Herodotus, the fifth-century-B.C. Greek historian, observed Scythians firsthand in his travels and reacted to them with fascinated distaste. To him they were barbarians: trigger-happy, party-hearty cowboys, a kind of Wild Bunch of the steppes, who drank too much and spiced up their steam baths with marijuana smoke, to predictably raucous effect.</p>
        <p>But for cowboys, they had excellent taste in art, as these exhibitions demonstrate. The Brooklyn show is the smaller and more neatly packaged. Cleanly installed, it is cast as a kind of walk-through historical narrative, with personable object labels written by Ellen D. Reeder, deputy director of art at the Brooklyn Museum and curator of the show along with Gerry Scott III of the San Antonio Museum. The exhibition even has an ambient PBS-ish soundtrack of bird cries, wind and music, which is nice.</p>
        <p>The story starts with a few works from the ninth and eighth centuries B.C. -- jewelry, horse ornaments -- by Central Asian people known as Cimmerians, whom the Scythians dislodged or perhaps simply absorbed. By the seventh century B.C., familiar Scythian motifs, mostly animal images, are in place. They include deer, felines and birds of prey, alone or locked in mortal combat, and hybrid creatures blending aspects of all three into intricate, abstract patterns.</p>
        <p>Patterns probably meant a lot to these people, who lived under the open sky and must have experienced the world in terms of endless organic links and cycles. Such concepts take visual form in their art: a hunting scene on an openwork gold plaque is rendered as an unbroken network of lines, all connected; a relief of horses' heads on a small, nugget-thick gold cup from the fifth century B.C. has a continuous swirling design that seems to burst open like a flower.</p>
        <p>Ms. Reeder suggests that these naturalistically rendered creatures are direct descendants of the horses on the Parthenon, and that sounds right. Still debated, however, is whether such works were actually made by Greek artisans or by Scythians, or whether they represent a collaboration between the two.</p>
        <p>Certainly both cultures contribute to one of the Brooklyn show's star attractions, a bow-and-arrow case cover of beaten gold on loan from the Museum of Historical Treasures of Ukraine in Kiev. Greek floral scrolls and Scythian beasts alternate in the borders. The figurative vignettes in the center are Greek in style, but according to some scholars they illustrate episodes from a Scythian epic.</p>
        <p>For anyone interested in pursuing such questions, this is an opportune moment. A virtually identical version of the Brooklyn piece, possibly hammered out on the same template, can be found in ''The Golden Deer of Eurasia'' at the Met, surrounded by superb examples of Greco-Scythian material.</p>
        <p>The Met show is bigger, more complicated and more adventurous by far than the one in Brooklyn, though it, too, covers the historical basics. Among the early entries is a seventh- century-B.C. gold shield ornament, on loan from the Hermitage, in the form of a recumbent stag, antlers unfurling across its back like ocean waves. Reproductions of a similar item have long been a staple of the Met gift shop, so it has become a sort of Scythian logo.</p>
        <p>Also here from the Hermitage are matchless fourth-century-B.C. works. A gold comb topped with a miniature battle scene, which includes figures in Scythian dress, surely earned its owner a first-class ticket to the afterlife. Scythian warriors also appear in relief on the side of a large gold vase. Here they seem to be recovering from a skirmish: one man bandages a companion's leg, and another strings a bow. But the two exhibition catalogs give conflicting interpretations of the vignettes, indicating yet again how much we have to learn about this culture.</p>
        <p>The Met show, organized by Joan Aruz, acting associate curator in charge of the department of ancient Near Eastern art, becomes particularly interesting, as one might expect, when it enters terrain unexplored or only lightly touched on in Brooklyn. Here, for example, one finds an array of Iranian items that illuminate Scythia's longstanding ties to the Near East and an amazing display of nomadic material from Siberia, including wooden furniture and appliqued textiles that survived, freeze-dried, under layers of permafrost.</p>
        <p>Most intriguing of all and making up two-thirds of the exhibition are more than 130 items excavated between 1986 and 1990 from non-Scythian burial mounds near the town of Filippovka on Russia's southern steppes. Built for a ruling elite, the graves were lavishly furnished with gold-fitted swords, cups and equestrian gear. The real find, though, was a suite of 26 sculptures of standing stags, each about two feet tall and made from wood covered with sheets of gold.</p>
        <p>They appear in the opening gallery of the exhibition, much as they did at the entrance to the tomb. With their Bullwinkle snouts and sometimes spotty workmanship, they are, frankly, a little uncouth. But they have striking features -- graphically bold surface designs, antlers that spiral up like toppling Carmen Miranda hats -- and they open doors to all kinds of archaeological inquiry.</p>
        <p>Although resembling forms used by Scythian artists for centuries, these sculptures were produced at a time when the Scythians were being replaced by new arrivals. These were the Sarmatians, with whom some art historians have associated the Filippovka people, at least tentatively. The Brooklyn show concludes with Sarmatian pieces, notably a tiny Greek-style gold, bronze and crystal pin in the form of a dolphin. Granted, it is of a very late date -- first or to second century A.D. -- but it also occupies a totally different aesthetic universe from that of the gold-sheathed stags.</p>
        <p>So we're left with mysteries. Do the Filippovka sculptures represent a distinctive style? Did they set the gold standard for a local school of artists still to be discovered and defined? Did a broader Sarmatian wave absorb that style, as Scythian art absorbed cultures it encountered and was absorbed by them in turn?</p>
        <p>Nobody knows for sure. But scholars in Russia and Ukraine are hard at work on finding answers. And with future excavations, and opulent exhibitions like these, more will be revealed.</p>
        <p>''The Golden Deer of Eurasia: Scythian and Sarmatian Treasures From the Russian Steppes'' is at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, through Feb. 4. It travels to Italy in the spring. ''Gold of the Nomads: Scythian Treasures From Ancient Ukraine'' is at the Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, through Jan. 21. It travels to the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto (Feb. 18-April 29); the Nelson Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City, Mo. (May 27-Aug. 11); and the Grand Palais in Paris (Sept. 25-Dec. 31, 2001).</p>
