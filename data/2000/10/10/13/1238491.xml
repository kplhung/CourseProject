        <p>The street and what happens (or doesn't) on it has long been the photographic province of Joel Meyerowitz, who quit his job as an advertising director one day in 1962 to go out shooting on Fifth Avenue. In most of these vintage dye transfers from the 60's and 70's (a few were recently made into larger Iris prints) he deals with the street as theater rather than as landscape.</p>

        <p>'Early Street Work: 1966-1976'</p>
        <p>Ariel Meyerowitz Gallery</p>
        <p>580 Broadway, near Prince Street</p>
        <p>SoHo</p>
        <p>Through Oct. 21</p>
        <p>The street and what happens (or doesn't) on it has long been the photographic province of Joel Meyerowitz, who quit his job as an advertising director one day in 1962 to go out shooting on Fifth Avenue. In most of these vintage dye transfers from the 60's and 70's (a few were recently made into larger Iris prints) he deals with the street as theater rather than as landscape.</p>
        <p>At first Mr. Meyerowitz focused on incidents like that in ''Fallen Man, Paris, 1967,'' in which a young man lies supine on the street as passersby stare or step around him. So real is the scene that it could have been posed; you're not quite sure. ''Fallen Horse, Spain, 1967'' is less likely to have been, with its upended horse, the purplish color of eggplant, and cart dominating the lens as a crowd watches solemnly.</p>
        <p>By the early 70's Mr. Meyerowitz was shifting his view of the street, from an arena for pointed incidents to a ''nonhierarchical'' field in which people, buildings and the flow of energy among them became the subject, with no single incident asserting itself. ''West 46th Street, NYC'' (1976) is one example, in which stores, signs and the bustle of street life become the action.</p>
        <p>Often enough, though, a bit of more focused drama sneaks in. ''Woman in Red Coat, NYC'' (1975), for example, depicts a crisscross flow of passersby before a bland architectural facade. The standout is an actressy-looking woman in a bright red coat and long black gloves who looms large at the left of the picture. But some of Mr. Meyerowitz's photographs from this period are a little on the flat side, like ''Tiger, Fifth Avenue, NYC'' (1975), in which jaded foot traffic ignores a snarling sculpture of a tiger. The best of his work vividly records the sheer nervous energy that pumps through New York streets, even when there's no one around. Incidentally, the similarity of names between dealer and artist is no accident. Ariel Meyerowitz is Mr. Meyerowitz's daughter.</p>
