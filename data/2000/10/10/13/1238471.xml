        <p>A former Republican candidate for secretary of the state, his sister-in-law and two Boston businessmen pleaded not guilty today to federal corruption charges linking them to Connecticut's former treasurer, who admitted last year that he had accepted bribes while in office.</p>
        <p>Appearing in United States District Court here, all four denied committing any of the crimes outlined in a 25-count indictment that a federal grand jury returned on Tuesday. Each defendant is charged with racketeering, bribery and mail and wire fraud related to a scheme orchestrated by Paul J. Silvester, the former state treasurer.</p>
        <p>In exchange for bribes and illegal payments made to his friends by brokerage firms, Mr. Silvester, who had sole authority over the state's pension fund, gave the firms lucrative investment contracts.</p>
        <p>The most prominent among the four who were indicted is Ben F. Andrews Jr., 59, a former adviser to Gov. John G. Rowland who ran for secretary of the state on Mr. Rowland's ticket in 1998. Mr. Andrews, of Simsbury, is also a former president of the Connecticut chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.</p>
        <p>Mr. Andrews, a business consultant to investment firms around the country, is also charged with witness tampering. The indictment says he accepted consulting fees worth about $1 million from an undisclosed investment firm, gave some of the money to Mr. Silvester, and during a subsequent F.B.I. investigation tried to persuade witnesses to the transaction to alter their testimony.</p>
        <p>After today's arraignment, Mr. Andrews said that he had been ''surprised and shocked'' by the charges and that he was innocent. ''This is a very difficult thing to go through for anybody,'' he said. ''I still believe that public trust is a very essential thing, and I want to make sure that everyone knows that I am honorable. Our innocence will prevail.''</p>
        <p>Asked about the fees the indictment says he received from the firm, Mr. Andrews said, ''I had marketing contracts and performed them according to the way you do business, and I performed them honorably.''</p>
        <p>The other three people charged in the case are Lisa A. Thiesfield, 30, of Hartford, who managed Mr. Silvester's 1998 election campaign, and Frederick W. McCarthy, 57, and Charles B. Spadoni, 52, both of Triumph Capital Group, a Boston investment firm. The United States attorney's office said Triumph and the two executives paid Ms. Thiesfield and another person $1 million each as a condition for Mr. Silvester's awarding the firm pension-fund contracts worth $200 million.</p>
        <p>Outside court, Ms. Thiesfield said only, ''I'm relieved after having seen the indictment, and I look forward to being exonerated at trial.''</p>
        <p>The case will be heard by Judge Janet B. Arterton of Federal District Court in New Haven. No preliminary hearing has been scheduled. Mr. Silvester and three other men who pleaded guilty to corruption charges last year are awaiting sentencing.</p>
        <p>Reporters, federal lawyers and elected officials, including Governor Rowland, have sparred over the meaning of two ambiguous paragraphs on Page 35 of the indictment. The passage says Mr. Silvester ''reached an arrangement'' with the chairman of the Connecticut Republican Party, Chris DePino, whom the document identified only by his title.</p>
        <p>The passage says the arrangement was that the state party would earmark a percentage of $100,000 that prosecutors said Mr. McCarthy had agreed to raise for the party, and give it to Mr. Silvester's campaign.</p>
        <p>Responding to questions on whether the indictment said Mr. DePino had done anything illegal, John H. Durham, the United States attorney's chief counsel, issued a statement on Wednesday: ''Mr. DePino is not charged in the indictment. There is no allegation that he violated any federal law.'' Mr. DePino would not comment on the passage.</p>
        <p>This morning, responding to reporters' questions about the meaning of any arrangement between Mr. Silvester and Mr. DePino, Governor Rowland testily dismissed questions, saying at one point, ''Write whatever story you want, all right?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rowland said earlier: ''The prosecutors went out of their way yesterday to say that Mr. DePino is not included in the indictment and is not a target in the investigation.''</p>
        <p>But Delcie Thibault, a spokeswoman for Mr. Durham, said his statement was not intended to exonerate Mr. DePino. She would not comment further.</p>
        <p>Regardless of the facts behind the passage, few people expect Mr. DePino, 48, to be charged with any federal crime. Privately, however, some state officials said this week that if Mr. DePino had agreed to use the state party to deliver cash to Mr. Silvester's campaign, he might have violated several state laws.</p>
