        <p>The World Trade Organization approved extending until Nov. 1 the deadline for the United States to comply with an earlier ruling to overhaul its system of tax breaks for American exporting companies. United States trade officials, who had asked for an extension, had already agreed with the European Union, which had brought the complaint that the United States Foreign Sales Corporation program was an export subsidy that violated global free trade rules. Legislation to change the program is working its way through Congress, but has yet to clear the Senate.</p>
