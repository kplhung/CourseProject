        <p>Lucinda Childs, always an experimental choreographer and increasingly luminous in her geometric eye-riveting patterns, has chosen ''Parcours'' as the title of her company's 25th anniversary program in the Brooklyn Academy of Music's Next Wave Festival.</p>
        <p>When you take a taxi in Paris, you can tell the driver you know the ''parcours,'' or way. The word was once associated with bus routes. The evening does, in fact, trace the course Ms. Child's choreography has taken since the 1970's.</p>
        <p>At the Academy's Harvey Theater (651 Fulton Street), where the Lucinda Childs Dance Company opened on Wednesday night and is to perform through Sunday afternoon, the audience will find the balance tipped toward recent work. The rigorous purity that has been Ms. Childs's minimalist signature is still present, but there are also new cloudbursts of dramatic energy.</p>
        <p>The effect is as refreshing as a summer shower, with occasional thunderclaps. Quite different from the consistency of an April downpour.</p>
        <p>Tenacity with respect to a single-minded aesthetic is not so much Ms. Childs's way as is integrity of aesthetic attitude. If ''Parcours'' is the theme, it is fair to say Ms. Childs found her way after encountering the minimalist music of Philip Glass and after her participation in the Glass-Robert Wilson opera ''Einstein on the Beach'' in 1976.</p>
        <p>''Radial Courses,'' the first piece on the Brooklyn program, dates from that year. With its lack of music and its use of ordinary steps (running, skipping, walking), the work has its roots in the plain-talk attitudes of Ms. Childs's beginnings in the 1960's avant-garde.</p>
        <p>As performed with extraordinary rhythmic precision by Bruce Jones, Garry Reigenborn, Keith Sabado and Dusan Tynek, this male quartet is already an exercise in repeated patterns and steps, with dancers constantly breaking away in pairs or as individuals. As they circle and fall back into unison, the dancer who was behind is often now in front.</p>
        <p>Pattern and permutation remain at the base of Ms. Childs's choreography and they embody the beauty of her work. It is a formula, nonetheless, that she continues to explore. To say that Pat Dignan's brilliant lighting literally renders her newer works more colorful is true. But to exchange ice-cold blue for a stage bathed in red or yellow also says something about the choreography, with its new sense of abstract drama.</p>
        <p>Yet ''Radial Courses,'' in which formal values predominate, is the most affecting work on the program. The men are seen as they are, dancers walking, running and then skipping as they catch up with one another, falling in and out of unison in increasingly complex ways.</p>
        <p>''Sunrise of the Planetary Dream Collector'' (1998) is a United States premiere named after its string music, by the pioneering minimalist Terry Riley. Tricia Brouk, Tamsin Carlson, Janet Charleston, Jennifer Lane Howard and Hope Mohr are seen in units of two and three, not all facing the same way. Nor does each dancer remain in the same unit. The dancers, in chic gray slacks by Gabriel Berry, give the work a tailored look. The ballet steps are less important than the way they affect the quality of the changing floor patterns. The dancers are immaculate and correctly placed. Purity prevails.</p>
        <p>As elsewhere in the program, the dancers stop abruptly with the music, and Ms. Childs does not so much enter into a dialogue with music as offer her visualization of it.</p>
        <p>Stephen Montague, an American composer, allows her to break out into an expansive mode in ''From the White Edge of Phrygia,'' a 1995 work named after its score. A stage flooded in red encases couples in black. They plunge into arabesques, introducing a dynamic interplay with dancers entering laterally and diagonally.</p>
        <p>Maria de Lourdes Davila stands out with her sharp articulation in the overlapping patterns. The music comes to a boil and the stage becomes bare and blue.</p>
        <p>Ms. Childs seems unsure of her ''parcours'' in the next section, which loses its organic logic. Dancers move in front and behind gauze panels and two pairs of bright headlights dim. Blue turns to red. The choreography remains light and aerial -- with the dancers giving it a typical spring.</p>
        <p>The local premiere of a solo, ''Commencement'' (1995), benefits from Ms. Childs's star presence. High-waisted black pants by Ronaldus Shamask and Suzanne Gallo give her an elegant exoticism as she moves back and forth within a short diagonal, bending while swinging an arm ferociously forward. Zygmunt Krauze's score uses a harpsichord, as does ''Concerto,'' a 1993 group work seen here in 1994. Set to Henryk Gorecki's score, it moves its dissolving patterns swiftly along. They are rich, with the seven dancers moving along autonomous paths.</p>
        <p>To see the choreography clearly, one has to follow a single dancer in his or her trajectory. Yet it is how these dancers mesh that makes the success of ''Concerto'' and the new ''Variete de Variete,'' set to excerpts from Mauricio Kagel's music.</p>
        <p>Ms. Childs ignores the humor of the score, although the gray jumpers on the women in the coed cast (with a brief solo for herself) go along with the initial cross-stepping advance that has more wit than usual. There is a provocative hint of undeveloped drama as a woman and a man look at each other, and a motif of one dancer replacing another. The image is of a society in flux.</p>
        <p>To say Ms. Childs is a special taste is no longer true. She has always known how to make things happen onstage and does so again in a different way.</p>
        <p>The company includes Philip Gardner, Krista Miller and David Zurak.</p>
