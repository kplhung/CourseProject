        <p>INDIA: EX-PREMIER GETS JAIL SENTENCE  Former Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao, 79, was sentenced to three years of ''rigorous'' imprisonment for his role in bribing members of Parliament to vote for his government in a 1993 no-confidence measure. Mr. Rao led the nation from 1991 to 1996, opening India's socialist economy to free-market reforms. He was fined $2,200 but will remain free after being given until Nov. 8 to appeal to the High Court.</p>

        <p>SRI LANKA: A TENUOUS VICTORY  The ruling coalition won the largest number of seats in parliamentary elections and will seek to form a government in the coming days. But its voting strength has eroded. And its ability to act swiftly on its plan to end an intractable civil war with the separatist Tamil rebels has also been weakened. President Chandrika Kumaratunga said she would call on the People's Alliance she leads to put together a government, though its victory left it six votes shy of a majority in the 225-member Parliament.</p>

        <p>INDONESIA: SUHARTO RELATIVE JAILED  The granddaughter-in-law of former President Suharto was sentenced to eight months in prison for drug possession. The case of Gusti Maya Firanti Noor was being watched closely as a gauge of the government's impartiality. So far, efforts to bring other Suharto family members to justice have failed. The former dictator was declared medically unfit to stand trial for corruption, and his son Tommy, convicted of fraud, remains free on a technicality.</p>

        <p>INDONESIA: BAN ON REBEL FLAGS  The government of President Abdurrahman Wahid announced a ban on displaying rebel flags in the province of Irian Jaya, the scene of clashes last week between security forces and separatists who want to break free of Indonesian rule. Cabinet Secretary Marsilam Simanjuntak said the government had also outlawed a pro-independence militia group, the Papua Taskforce. Security forces were bracing for a new round of violence.</p>

        <p>JAPAN: ARREST IN CASE OF MISSING HOSTESS  The police arrested a man suspected of involvement in the disappearance of a 22-year-old Canadian bar hostess whose case has drawn attention to Japan's large sex industry. Police sources said the suspect's cellular phone had been used by Lucie Blackman in her last known telephone call. The suspect, whose identity was not revealed, is being held on charges of molestation.</p>

        <p>MYANMAR: NEW MEETING WITH ACTIVIST  The United Nations special envoy to Myanmar, Razali Ismail, ended a four-day visit with a second two-hour meeting with the opposition leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. Mr. Razali, trying to mediate between Myanmar's military government and the pro-democracy movement of her National League for Democracy, declined to comment on the talks, but one of his aides said they had discussed ''future possibilities.''</p>

        <p>EUROPE</p>
        <p>GERMANY: A PLEA TO JEWS  Parliament condemned a surge in anti-Semitic violence, with attacks against Jews and synagogues, and pleaded with Jews not to leave the country. Legislators from across the political spectrum recorded their delight that Jewish life was flourishing in Germany half a century after the Holocaust. But the government reported that there were 1,112 crimes with a far-right, xenophobic or anti-Semitic motive in August -- almost double previous monthly averages.</p>

        <p>FRANCE: WOMEN IN THE LEGION  The Foreign Legion, a longstanding bastion of machismo, is to start accepting women into its ranks. As part of a plan to double the number of women in the military over the next 20 years, the Defense Ministry announced that women would be eligible for all but two jobs with the Legion -- submariner and the riot police.</p>

        <p>AUSTRIA, CZECH REPUBLIC: NUCLEAR DISPUTE  Austria and the Czech Republic are to ask the European Union at a meeting in Biarritz, France, this weekend to make a ruling in a heated dispute over a nuclear power plant in Temelin, 40 miles from the Austrian border. Austrian demonstrators have been blocking three Czech-Austrian border crossings for a week. Austria has threatened several times to block the Czech Republic's entry into the union if the plant is put into operation.</p>

        <p>ITALY: MOB SUSPECT SEIZED  After a seven-year manhunt, the police in Sicily arrested Salvatore Genovese, a suspected top Mafia boss, in a farmhouse outside Palermo. Mr. Genovese, 57, one of Italy's 30 most wanted criminals, is facing charges on seven homicides and other Mafia-related crimes. He is the nephew of Vito Genovese, who was a model for Mario Puzo's Don Corleone in ''The Godfather.'' The police believe Mr. Genovese served as the right-hand man of Bernardo Provenzano, the Mafia's leading fugitive.</p>

        <p>BRITAIN: GATES GIFT TO CAMBRIDGE  The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation presented a $210 million gift to Cambridge University, offering gifted students a chance to study at the elite institution. The money, given by the Seattle-based foundation set up by Mr. Gates, the billionaire chairman of Microsoft, will fund about 225 ''Gates Cambridge Scholars'' each year and will run in perpetuity, the university said. Scholarships will be awarded only to non-British students.</p>

        <p>CANADA: RIGHTISTS' MOVE IN QUEBEC  With Canada expected to hold federal elections in late November, the new right-wing party, the Canadian Alliance, has introduced 12 candidates in Quebec. Stockwell Day, leader of the western-based party, says he recognizes the Quebecois as a people and that he favors giving Quebec constitutional status as a ''distinct society.'' Seeking to win votes in the province, the alliance is showing commercials featuring Mr. Day's eight years as a youth in Quebec.</p>

        <p>CANADA: E. COLI OUTBREAK EXPLAINED  Heavy rain washing cow manure into a well caused Canada's deadliest outbreak of E. coli bacteria, according to a report by Dr. Murray McQuigge, medical health officer for the Ontario region that included Walkerton, the infected town. The contamination last May killed six people and sickened half of the town's population of 5,000. Five months later, town residents must boil their drinking water, and Ontario's government is inspecting the province's 630 water works.</p>

        <p>IRAQ: U.N. TOLD OF EXECUTIONS  The United Nations human rights monitor for Iraq said in a report to the General Assembly that more than 100 prisoners were executed last year in Iraqi jails, about a quarter of whom had been detained for political activities. Andreas Mavrommatis, a Cypriot diplomat, also said Iraqis appeared to stage traffic accidents in which religious leaders or political dissidents have died. Female relatives of opposition members in exile reported the loss of ration cards, sexual abuse and the taping of rapes to intimidate and dishonor families.</p>

        <p>SIERRA LEONE: DIAMOND BAN LIFTED  The government lifted a ban on diamond exports after it took delivery of specially printed certificates that should make it more difficult for rebels to benefit from gem sales. Mineral Resources Minister Mohamed Deen presented the certificates to the press at the central bank in Freetown. Sierra Leone imposed the ban in mid-July to back efforts by the United Nations and world diamond traders to cut off illegal sales by the Revolutionary United Front.</p>
        <p>(Reuters)</p>
        <p>SUDAN: U.S. ACCUSED IN U.N. ROLE  Defeated in a bid to win a Security Council seat from Africa, Sudan accused the United States of browbeating or paying off African nations to engineer the loss. President Omar al-Bashir was also quoted in Sudanese newspapers as accusing Washington of trying to turn Africans against each other. Mauritius won the seat, with the backing of southern African nations, Uganda and dozens of small island nations, along with the United States and Europe.</p>

        <p>RWANDA: SUSPECT AGREES TO TRIAL  A Rwandan war crimes suspect who has been living as a refugee in Britain for the last two years agreed to stand trial after abandoning his fight against deportation. Tharcisse Muvunyi, 46, dropped the High Court challenge after being assured steps would be taken to protect him in Africa, and that he would be able to return to Britain if he was acquitted. He is now expected to be sent to Arusha, Tanzania, seat of the tribunal investigating the Rwandan killing frenzy of 1994.</p>
