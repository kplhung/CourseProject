        <p>NEW YORK</p>
        <p>BRONX: SON CHARGED WITH MURDER  A 15-year-old boy stabbed his mother to death with a kitchen knife yesterday in their apartment in Co-Op City, the police said. The police said he told them that he stabbed her because she had been giving him a hard time about playing hooky from school. The boy, Douglas Wright, stabbed his mother, Geraldine Wright, 45, about 15 times in the head, back and arms around 6 p.m., said Detective John Giammarino, a police spokesman. Then he called 911 and reported the slaying, Detective Giammarino said. Officers went to the apartment and charged him with murder, weapons possession and manslaughter.</p>

        <p>STATEN ISLAND: ABUSE ALLEGED ON SCHOOL BUS  Two 12-year-old intermediate school students were arrested yesterday and charged with assault and sexual abuse in connection with reports that two 12-year-old girls were molested on a school bus en route from Intermediate School 61 in Staten Island earlier in the week. The names of the boys were not released because of their age. The police said that the parents of both victims arrived at the 120th Precinct station house on Wednesday evening to file complaints.</p>

        <p>QUEENS: CHARGE OF ASSAULT AT DAY CARE CENTER  The director of a private school for autistic children was charged Wednesday with assaulting a 3-year-old boy under her care, the police said yesterday. The boy's mother told the police that on Wednesday she went to the school, the Quality Service for Autism Community School on 150th Street in Whitestone, and saw the director, Debra Gruber, grab the boy by the arm and throw him down on a cot, bruising his left shoulder. Ms. Gruber, 35, of East 78th Street on the Upper East Side, was charged with assault and child endangerment, said Detective John Giammarino, a police spokesman.</p>

        <p>QUEENS: TEAMSTER PROTEST AT HOSPITAL  The Teamsters rallied yesterday in front of Elmhurst Hospital Center to protest plans to privatize some 850 security officers at city hospitals. Carl Haynes, president of Local 237 of the Teamsters, said the Health and Hospitals Corporation planned to take bids from private contractors Jan. 1. The deputized in-house police force would be replaced by security guards who would not have the power of arrest. ''H.H.C. is downgrading security to save money,'' Mr. Haynes said. Jane Zimmerman, a spokeswoman for the corporation, said that the force made few, if any, arrests and that the hospital could save $10 million annually because it could cut wages to as little as $12 an hour, from more than $21 an hour.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: UNION OFFICIALS PLEAD  Two vice presidents of the labor union District Council 37 pleaded guilty on Wednesday to grand larceny. The two admitted stealing hospitality money intended for union use, and taking vacations with it. One such trip included a $16,000 cruise to Alaska. The two officials may receive jail time: Mary Wilson faces up to six years and Lionel Scott more than four.</p>

        <p>TRUMBULL: COACHES DISMISSED  School officials have fired the coaches of the Trumbull High School wrestling team involved in hazing this year. A spokeswoman for the Trumbull school district confirmed that the coach, Josh Tolk, and the assistant coach, Glen A. Liscinsky, had been dismissed, but said that Superintendent Ralph Iassogna would not comment further. Eight members of the team were arrested in connection with a 15-year-old teammate's violent hazing.</p>

        <p>NEW JERSEY</p>
        <p>NEWARK: LIBRARIAN CHARGED WITH SEX ASSAULT  A middle school librarian was arrested yesterday and charged with sexually assaulting a 12-year-old boy, the police said. The assaults took place several times over the last few weeks at the Morton Street School, said Lt. Derek Glenn, a police spokesman. The police were contacted on Wednesday by doctors at Beth Israel Medical Center, who had found evidence that the student had been sexually assaulted, Lieutenant Glenn said. Yesterday, Lieutenant Glenn said, officers arrested the 39-year-old teacher, a Mr. Nash, whose first name was not immediately released, and charged him with aggravated sexual assault.</p>

        <p>TRENTON: SETTLEMENT IN PRISON STABBING  In a settlement reached with the state attorney general on Wednesday, a 32-year-old inmate paralyzed after being stabbed with a typewriter part by two other inmates in a maximum-security prison has been awarded $150,000. The victim, Richard Beltran of Jersey City, was serving a drug sentence at the New Jersey State Prison in Trenton three years ago when he was attacked with a metal blade fashioned from the bar that holds paper inside a typewriter. Mr. Beltran was injured four months after another inmate was attacked with the same kind of weapon. Mr. Beltran was released in 1998, halfway through his 10-year sentence. His lawyer, Kevin Orr, argued that prison officials failed to thoroughly search jail cells after the first attack.</p>
        <p>Andrew Jacobs (NYT)</p>
        <p>MORRISTOWN: KILLER SEEKS LIGHTER SENTENCE  Sam Manzie, 18, argued yesterday that a sentence that leaves him ineligible for parole until he is 76 was wrongly imposed. Mr. Manzie, left, was sentenced to serve at least 59.5 years of the 70-year term he received in 1999 for murdering 11-year-old Eddie Werner, a neighbor. Mr. Manzie's lawyer told a three-judge appellate panel that the sentencing judge did not adequately consider Mr. Manzie's mental condition, which was diagnosed as ''major depression with psychosis'' . Lisa Gochman, a deputy state attorney general, countered that Mr. Manzie willingly pleaded guilty in exchange for reduced charges.</p>

        <p>NEWARK: AIR MISHAP RECLASSIFIED  An air traffic controller on Long Island was to blame for directing a jet to a closed runway at Newark International Airport, the Federal Aviation Administration said yesterday. A Newark controller, looking out the control tower window, had stopped the plane from landing. Frank Hatfield, the agency's regional air traffic manager, said the Aug. 24 incident, originally classified as pilot error, happened because of an air traffic controller's slip of the tongue. The controller had a previously unblemished record and was ordered to undergo ''refresher training.''</p>

        <p>Correction:  November 2, 2000, Thursday  A report in the Metro Briefing column on Oct. 13 about the dismissal of two wrestling coaches at Trumbull High School in Connecticut, where eight team members were arrested in connection with the violent hazing of a 15-year-old, referred incorrectly in some copies to the resolution of the criminal case against three team members who were charged as adults. They did not plead guilty. The judge granted their request for ''accelerated rehabilitation,'' a form of probation that can lead to dismissal of the pending charges after two years if the terms of probation are met.</p>
