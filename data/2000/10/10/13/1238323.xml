        <p>Evenings of one-acts are like evenings at the blackjack table: you hope that the winners outnumber the losers, or at the very least that the overall entertainment value is worth dropping a little cash.

        <p>Evenings of one-acts are like evenings at the blackjack table: you hope that the winners outnumber the losers, or at the very least that the overall entertainment value is worth dropping a little cash. ''Snapshots 2000,'' the Worth Street Theater Company's third annual presentation of minimally budgeted one-acts, won't bankrupt the low-rolling gambler, but there isn't a big payoff to be had, either.</p>
        <p>The themeless show, at the tiny TriBeCa Playhouse, consists of seven works by five playwrights, the strongest of which are ''Stars,'' the opening vignette, by Romulus Linney, and ''Dreamin' in Church,'' by Robert O'Hara.</p>
        <p>''Stars'' concerns a middle-aged man and woman obliquely contemplating an affair on a penthouse balcony during a cocktail party. They trade melancholy stories of past seductions as a means of seducing each other. Hers is about an affair she pursues to avenge her husband's indifference that turns out to be squirmily unsatisfying and horribly guilt-inducing; his, more enigmatic, is about the sexual humiliation of a woman he cares for by another man and his own possible complicity in it. Each is an eerie and credible tale with surprising details and a resonant twist, rendered with delicacy by the actors, Diane Love and Jim Hazard.</p>
        <p>''Dreamin' in Church'' is a comic monologue, delivered from the pulpit of a black church by the Reverend Benson, who begins this carefully constructed piece with a warning against rumormongering -- there are gays in the church choir, it is said -- and mounts to his own joyous confession.</p>
        <p>Mr. O'Hara, who is black, is a promising and energetic playwright (his ''Insurrection: Holding History'' was presented at the Joseph Papp Public Theater in 1996) with a healthy sense of the comic possibilities of bigotry and racial stereotypes. He has a second offering here as well, a jokey skit in Wayans brothers' mode about black women talking on the phone about the decision by one of them to name her baby Genitalia.</p>
        <p>In ''Dreamin' '' Mr. O'Hara shows off a gift for deft pacing, withholding the comic underpinning of the story just long enough. Performed by Derek Lively with fervid, singsong mischief, the monologue ends up thundering on some obvious points, and once Mr. Lively strips off his robe to disclose his own secret, it goes on a bit too long. But Mr. Lively's delivery, particularly at his moment of revelation, is hilarious.</p>
        <p>The evening also includes two mildly amusing satiric sketches by Peter Hedges, both involving food. One, about a couple at a bar talking about sex, revolves around a celery stalk (gobbled amazingly in a single bite by Adam Hirsch). The other, set at the meeting of a cultlike support group, devolves into a collective sacrifice, substituting cream pies in the face for strychnine-laced Kool-Aid.</p>
        <p>The weakest elements of the evening are, alas, the longest. One, by the show's director, Jeff Cohen, is both overplotted and under-resolved, the story of a senator's daughter and the murder of her childhood friend, ostensibly by the C.I.A. It also includes an unnecessary, semipornographic simulation of sex. The other, by Mark Novom, a recent drama school graduate, consists of four interlocking monologues by seemingly unrelated characters -- a law student, an aspiring folk singer, a soldier in Vietnam and a convicted murderer -- and proves, with all the windy earnestness of a good student who hasn't actually seen a lot of theater, that there are only degrees of separation.</p>
        <p>SNAPSHOTS 2000  Seven one-act plays directed by Jeff Cohen. Lighting by Matthew Piercy; costume consultant, Allyson Lapidus; graphic design by Brian Boyce.
