        <p>Senator Joseph I. Lieberman visited this industrial city today to drive home the Democrats' accusation that Gov. George W. Bush, as president, would pose a national environmental threat.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman listened to the stories of residents who live with often foul-smelling air and water and worry that their health problems are linked to nearby industrial plants.</p>
        <p>Norma Nunez, 39, told of surviving thyroid cancer and pituitary cancer, and of seeing several family members suffer from cancer and other severe illnesses. She said of Mr. Bush, ''Him being the governor, being over the environment of Texas, he hasn't done nothing for us.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman said, ''The record here shows Governor Bush has failed to lead.'' He cited federal reports ranking Texas as allowing the highest level of toxic industrial emissions into the air and the third-highest rate into the water, and he noted Houston's status as nation's smog capital.</p>
        <p>''I think people have to ask themselves, What would he do in Washington?'' the senator said. In recent days, the Democrats have broadcast television advertisements in swing states with much the same message.</p>
        <p>A Bush campaign spokesman, Dan Bartlett, said the state's environmental problem long preceded Governor Bush's tenure, ''and he has taken significant steps to address it.''</p>
        <p>The poor neighborhood Mr. Lieberman visited is near a petrochemical plant, one of hundreds of older factories in Texas that are the subject of a long-running environmental dispute. Mr. Bush's detractors and supporters say the plants are central to his environmental record.</p>
        <p>Plants built before the 1970 Clean Air Act are largely exempt from federal emissions standards, but states can impose their own rules. For three years, Mr. Bush has promoted voluntary emissions reductions for most older plants, and last year that approach was used in a law written partly by industry officials.</p>
        <p>Indications from both the state and environmental groups are that the voluntary program has had no discernable effect on emissions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bartlett said that under Mr. Bush, toxic industrial air emissions had declined -- a drop traceable to newer plants -- but toxic emissions have declined nationally as well. Meanwhile, ozone levels have risen in Houston and other Texas cities.</p>
