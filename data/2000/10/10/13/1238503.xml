        <p>Bobby Valentine led a contingent of drained and delirious Mets up the dugout runway and through the gray metal doors to the visiting clubhouse last night, a pack of men pushing, shoving and shouting with every step.</p>
        <p>''Six more,'' they screamed. ''Six more.''</p>
        <p>Indeed. After the Mets survived a crazy night in which they wasted three two-run leads to defeat the Cardinals, 6-5, in Game 2 of the National League Championship Series, the Mets were reminding each other that they needed only six more victories to win a World Series title. Six more, they screamed, six more.</p>
        <p>The Mets showed why they are the most imposing team still alive as Jay Payton coolly lined a single to center field off Mike Timlin to knock in the pinch-runner Joe McEwing with the winning run in the ninth inning. Payton, who did not have a hit in his first three at-bats, has endured four operations in the last five seasons to get to a moment like this. Now, it was finally here and the rookie grabbed it to help complete the longest nine-inning N.L.C.S. game -- 3 hours 59 minutes -- in style.</p>
        <p>''This is what I came back for,'' Payton said. ''This is why I play the game. I didn't think it would happen this soon. For it to happen this quick makes up for all the time I've missed.''</p>
        <p>The Mets have a commanding 2-0 lead over the Cardinals, who have to wonder if their season might end in Flushing this weekend. The Mets would have been wondering about themselves if they had frittered away this game, but they prevailed. The Mets prevailed because they are better. Scheduling a World Series party and believing that the Mets will be playing would be a shrewd idea since they play the next three games at Shea Stadium, where they have gone 57-26 in the regular and postseason. One half of a Subway Series is halfway done.</p>
        <p>This is who the Mets are, a deep, talented team that is as resilient as any team could be. Rick Ankiel put the Cardinals in a 2-0 ditch because he could not locate the plate and left after throwing 34 pitches. The Mets must have felt like they would coast to the victory behind Al Leiter, but, of course, it got interesting. This is the Mets. ''I can't say you ever get used to these games, but we've played a lot of them,'' Mike Piazza said. ''I can't say you enjoy them. They're nerve-racking. But we didn't give up.''</p>
        <p>Ankiel's first pitch soared over Timo Perez's blue helmet, causing the tiny outfielder to crumple. It would have been an interesting purpose pitch if Ankiel were trying to intimidate the Mets in a game the Cardinals desperately needed to snare. But that would have meant Ankiel had even a modicum of control and he had none.</p>
        <p>The Mets would have been best served by resorting to their Little League days and resting their bats on their shoulders for at least one strike, or maybe even two, against Ankiel. Ankiel was that erratic, a 21-year-old in a sweaty red cap who was turning into another Mark Wohlers before 52,250 pairs of eyes.</p>
        <p>Twenty pitches into the game, Ankiel had already thrown five pitches that kissed the backstop about 50 feet behind the plate. Cardinals Manager Tony La Russa exhaled, then closed his eyes after Ankiel's first pitch almost beaned Perez. La Russa should have kept them closed because Ankiel continued to scare the fans sitting in the Bob Uecker seats at Busch Stadium and lasted two-thirds of an inning.</p>
        <p>This game was gift-wrapped for the Mets. The Cardinals had to summon Britt Reames after Ankiel faced six batters and threw one pitch to a seventh. But it got testy. Leiter could not hold a 3-1 lead in the fifth and John Franco and Turk Wendell could not protect a 5-3 lead. Perez, the Japanese League refugee, who might be older than the 23 years that the Mets think he is, scored from first on Edgardo Alfonzo's hit-and-run single in the eighth to put the Mets ahead, 4-3, and Todd Zeile's single made it 5-3. But the Cardinals quickly tied in the bottom of the eighth.</p>
        <p>''There's no die in this team,''  Franco said. ''We've played these types of games before. We know how to win them.''</p>
        <p>After Robin Ventura reached first when Will Clark misplayed his grounder to open the ninth, Benny Agbayani bunted him to second. McEwing replaced Ventura at second. Payton, who had 30 major league at-bats before this season, lashed a ball to center and the Mets immediately knew it would drop in and deliver McEwing.</p>
        <p>The music was pumping and Omar Minaya, the Mets' senior assistant general manager, was outside Valentine's office after the Mets won in dramatic fashion. General Manager Steve Phillips was smiling. So was Valentine. So was Minaya and everyone affiliated with the Mets. The best team still playing should smile</p>
        <p>''Typical Mets game, huh?'' Minaya said.</p>
        <p>Indeed. Six more is all the Mets need. Six more.</p>
