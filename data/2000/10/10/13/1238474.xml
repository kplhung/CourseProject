        <p>Five minutes before halftime of last night's exhibition game against the Philadelphia 76ers, Coach Jeff Van Gundy inserted a lineup that many expect to become the Knicks' staple.

        <p>Five minutes before halftime of last night's exhibition game against the Philadelphia 76ers, Coach Jeff Van Gundy inserted a lineup that many expect to become the Knicks' staple. Latrell Sprewell took over at point guard, Allan Houston joined him in the backcourt and Glen Rice played small forward.</p>
        <p>That is potentially one of the most dangerous threesomes in the league. And like nearly everyone else, Van Gundy wanted to see how the group would work.</p>
        <p>The first impression was horrific.</p>
        <p>With the Sixers' tiny and aptly nicknamed rookie, Craig (Speedy) Claxton, hounding him, Sprewell struggled to make an entry pass to Houston on the unit's first possession. While a flustered Sprewell looked for an opening, Claxton, a Hofstra product, knocked the ball out of his hands and flew downcourt for an easy layup.</p>
        <p>Fortunately for the Knicks, things improved.</p>
        <p>For the next three and a half minutes, the Knicks' explosive threesome, along with Kurt Thomas and Marcus Camby, played the 76ers' starting five evenly. The experiment ended when Sprewell left with a mildly sprained left ankle with 1 minute 11 seconds remaining in the half.</p>
        <p>''I took a few bumps and bruises out there, but it's going to take time, especially for me,'' Sprewell said of his time at point guard. ''I think I'm the key out there because I have to handle the ball. It was tough against a team that puts so much pressure on but it will only make us better.''</p>
        <p>The trials and tribulations of the big backcourt notwithstanding, the Knicks played well and improved to 2-0 with a 91-83 victory over the 76ers last night at Madison Square Garden.</p>
        <p>The Knicks' most impressive achievement was outrebounding the Sixers, who boast one of the best frontlines in the Eastern Conference, by 50-25.</p>
        <p>Larry Johnson led the Knicks with 11 rebounds. But Camby was the highlight down low, recording 13 points, 10 rebounds and 2 blocked shots. It was a welcomed about-face from his 3-point, 2-rebound outing Tuesday against Chicago.</p>
        <p>The Knicks, whose next preseason game is Monday in Hartford against the Washington Wizards, will open the regular season against Philadelphia on Oct. 31 at Madison Square Garden, and Camby said they wanted to send a message last night.</p>
        <p>''We made a conscious effort to come out and gang rebound and set the tone,'' Camby said. ''We're going to see them a lot and we wanted to let them know that we'll be better.''</p>
        <p>When Sprewell, Houston and Rice took the floor, the modus operandi was to get Rice the ball in the post. Rice, who came off the bench as the sixth man, was effective in establishing position on the low block, leaving the Sixers' no choice but to foul him. Rice, an 85 percent free-throw shooter for his career, made only 5 of 8 foul shots. However, he is still 21 for 24 in his two preseason games with the Knicks.</p>
        <p>The early indications are that Garden fans are going to love him.</p>
        <p>After scoring 20 points in a mediocre performance Tuesday, Rice dropped his first six shots last night, all of them jumpers, and finished 6 of 7 with a team-high 18 points in 27 minutes. And he was not discouraged by the performance of the big backcourt.</p>
        <p>''When the three of us are on the floor like that, who are you going to concentrate on?'' Rice said enthusiastically. ''The defense is going to have to play us straight-up man-to-man with no double teams, and we're going to be tough to stop.''</p>
        <p>While the big backcourt is the sexiest lineup, Charlie Ward is making it tough to consider keeping him off the floor.</p>
        <p>Playing with the offensive aggressiveness he displayed in last season's playoffs, Ward was exceptional. He drove past Allen Iverson several times, once fooling the Sixers' star with a wicked crossover dribble in recording 10 points and 4 assists.</p>
        <p>REBOUNDS</p>
        <p>The Sixers played without the injured MATT GEIGER. . . . Regarding gangsta rap, not particularly ALLEN IVERSON'S soon-to-released CD, CHARLIE WARD, a Christian, said: ''I refuse to listen to stuff like that. I call it garbage because that's where it needs to be. If they're not talking about anything positive, then it's garbage to me.''</p>
