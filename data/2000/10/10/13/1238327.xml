        <p>''Billy Elliot'' tells the story of an 11-year-old boy living in a coal mining town in northern England who dreams of becoming a ballet dancer. Billy's father (Gary Lewis), a miner locked in inarticulate grief after the death of his wife, is horrified and embarrassed at his son's terpsichorean bent, and so the boy must secretly train with a tough, kindly local dance teacher named Mrs. Wilkinson (Julie Walters), who pushes him to audition for a place in the Royal Ballet School.</p>
        <p>The day of the audition arrives, and with it the movie reaches a high pitch of suspense. Will Billy escape the confinement of working-class life? Will he abandon his family? Can dreams come true?</p>
        <p>This all may sound familiar. If you've been to see ''Girlfight,'' Karyn Kusama's new movie about a young female boxer from the housing projects of Brooklyn, ''Billy Elliot'' will seem very familiar indeed.</p>
        <p>These two movies are mirror images of each other: dead mothers; frustrated fathers; tough, kindly mentors; and main characters whose ambitions fly in the face of expected sex roles. The accents are different; the characters in ''Billy Elliot'' speak in the Scots-inflected dialect of northern England rather than in the Spanish-tinged rhythms of Red Hook. But the narrative idiom is the same.</p>
        <p>Like ''Girlfight,'' this movie, directed by Stephen Daldry from a script by Lee Hall, anchors its melodramatic formula in tough, heartfelt realism. Billy's struggle to express himself and to escape his oppressive surroundings takes place in 1984, in the midst of the bitter, sometimes violent and ultimately futile British miners' strike.</p>
        <p>In the first scenes, Billy, after leaping around his bedroom to the sounds of T. Rex's ''Cosmic Dancer,'' runs outside to fetch his grandmother. On the hill above their red brick public housing tract, almost out of the frame, a group of policemen are gathering, armed with riot shields and billy clubs. The police lurk around the edges of the movie, and the desperation of the strikers shows on the faces of Billy's father and his brother, Tony (Jamie Draven).</p>
        <p>Although the two of them initially ridicule, and even violently oppose, Billy's dancing, they are never made into monsters or scapegoats, and the movie never pretends that the brutal contradictions of the British class system can be healed by ballet.</p>
        <p>Billy himself is played by the skinny, jug-eared Jamie Bell, whose convincing mixture of sullenness and innocent charm helps the movie through its patches of thinness and predictability. The first half seems almost to acknowledge its own triteness; the scenes move quickly, as though being checked off a list, and the actors inhabit their roles like second-hand suits.</p>
        <p>But after a while the movie gains confidence in itself, and the fates of the characters, though still unsurprising, begin to feel real and consequential. Mr. Daldry, whose work in the theater has been widely praised, overcomes the occasional sententiousness of Mr. Hall's script. It helps that, as the film moves along, young Mr. Bell is given more opportunities to dance. In the film's best sequence, he stomps and kicks against the brick walls and metal barricades that form the boundaries of his childhood, and Mr. Daldry's camera, moving like Billy to the Beat of  Jam's ''Town Called Malice,'' captures both his imprisonment and his furious, temporary freedom.</p>
        <p>Ms. Walters and Mr. Lewis bring understated gravity to their roles as the adults contending for Billy's loyalty. Mrs. Wilkinson, clinging to the frayed edge of middle-class respectability, harbors a lifetime of compromise and frustration behind her businesslike demeanor, and Ms. Walters gets it across without a wasted word.</p>
        <p>As in so many British movies, class antagonism permeates ''Billy Elliot'' like coal soot in the air. But it's never a simple matter, and the climactic journey to London, in which Billy and his father are interviewed by the ballet school's admissions panel, is charged with nuances of shame, pride and confused good intentions. In this world, happy endings are not impossible, but they're also not unequivocal.</p>
        <p>''If you go out to find life, you lose other things,'' Mrs. Wilkinson tells Billy, and, like the movie at its best, her words are no less true for being platitudinous.</p>
        <p>''Billy Elliot'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes a lot of casual profanity.</p>
