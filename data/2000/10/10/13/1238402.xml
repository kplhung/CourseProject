        <p>Until recently, the sparkling new power plant in eastern Germany looked like a Taj Mahal of good intentions gone wrong.</p>
        <p>Built by VEAG, an eastern German power company owned by western German utilities, the coal-fired generators in Lippendorf hum almost silently inside spotless white buildings. Gone is the sulfurous black soot that the old Communist-era power plant here once rained down on the countryside. Today, the two giant white cooling towers emit little more than white clouds of water vapor.</p>
        <p>But for all its virtues, VEAG is reeling. Steered by both the hubris of its western German owners as well as political correctness, the company has spent nearly $8 billion rebuilding the dilapidated power system in the east.</p>
        <p>Now, thanks to abrupt deregulation of the electricity market here, it has been forced to reduce its prices by nearly half in the last year. With debt of more than $2 billion, VEAG lost nearly $800 million in 1999.</p>
        <p>Would anybody want to buy a company like this? Surprisingly, yes.</p>
        <p>In a battle that reflects the tumultuous change in Europe's power industry, at least a dozen potential bidders have emerged from Europe and the United States. One of the most determined suitors is the Southern Company, the Atlanta-based electricity conglomerate, which is already locked in a bitter legal battle for control of Berlin's electric utility.</p>
        <p>Southern's biggest rival is Hamburg's electric utility, whose biggest shareholder is the Swedish power conglomerate Vattenfall. Others circling the prey include NRG Energy, a Minneapolis power company; Enel, the Italian power company; Endesa, the Spanish electric utility; and a German utility backed by Electricite de France.</p>
        <p>The battle shows how little control easterners have over their economy. Until now, VEAG's fate has been dictated by the western German power companies that often had their own agendas. In the future, it may well be determined by companies in Atlanta, Stockholm, Paris or even Milan.</p>
        <p>''It will not be VEAG tomorrow,'' said Jurgen Stotz, VEAG's chief executive, in a recent interview at the company's headquarters in Berlin. ''It is clear we cannot do it alone. We are only one piece of the puzzle.''</p>
        <p>The pursuers of VEAG have been motivated by the rapid expansion of cross-border competition in Europe. As former national electric monopolies increasingly attack one another's territories, VEAG represents a rare opportunity for foreigners to enter Europe's biggest market.</p>
        <p>Despite the company's high debt, its gleaming new plants have some of the lowest operating costs in Europe. They also control a big source of cheap energy in their own backyard -- soft brown lignite coal that should last far beyond the lifetime of the new plants.</p>
        <p>There is an important strategic allure. VEAG owns the only power transmission network that links Germany with Poland and one of the very few that reaches Central Europe. As those nations prepare themselves for entry into the European Union, power executives are eagerly looking eastward.</p>
        <p>''If you can get past all the tangles, VEAG's variable costs are very low,'' one industry executive said. ''It can be a very competitive producer.''</p>
        <p>VEAG, which is an acronym for Vereinigte Energiewerke A.G., was a child of German reunification. Founded in 1990, its main shareholders were western Germany's biggest utilities: RWE, which dominates the western-most region of Germany; Veba, which dominates much of the north; and Viag, which serves Bavaria in the south.</p>
        <p>But the eastern German company was never really allowed to become a full-service company. Its western German utilities limited it to producing and transmitting electricity, while they and their affiliates actually sold the power and cultivated customers.</p>
        <p>They also locked the company into strange contracts, including a requirement that it sell the western German utilities electricity for about 6 pfennigs a kilowatt hour while ordering it to buy some of its electricity from the west for about twice that much.</p>
        <p>Today, VEAG is a pawn in the machinations of Europe's much bigger electric conglomerates. Its biggest shareholders -- RWE and what is now called E.ON -- were ordered by antitrust regulators to sell their VEAG stakes as a condition for winning approval of their own mergers. E.ON was formed by the merger of Veba and Viag's power businesses, and RWE acquired one of western Germany's distributors called VEW. German antitrust regulators also ordered E.ON to sell its stake in Berlin's electric utility, which has sales of about $1.5 billion.</p>
        <p>The upshot is that most of eastern Germany's power system is now the target of a nasty struggle, with the Southern Company right in the middle. Southern, which acquired a 26 percent stake in the Berlin utility Bewag in 1997, wants to buy majority control and then have Bewag acquire control of VEAG as well.</p>
        <p>''We are looking at being a player in Europe,'' said Jason Harlan, Southern's director of German operations. ''Germany is a key market. More than half of all electricity consumed in the European Union occurs here.''</p>
        <p>The two deals are closely linked, because German political leaders want to consolidate eastern Germany's power industry into a single company that can compete against the country's three other big producers.</p>
        <p>Two months ago, E.ON shocked Southern by announcing that it would sell its controlling stake in the Berlin utility to Hamburg's main power company, which is partly controlled by Vattenfall.</p>
        <p>Under the proposed deal, E.ON would receive Vattenfall's stake in a regional Swedish power company as well as the Hamburg utility's stake in a local distributor of natural gas.</p>
        <p>Southern angrily protested, arguing that it has a pre-emptive contractual right to approve any change in control. Supported by the city of Berlin, Southern won a court injunction that blocked the Vattenfall deal. But the two companies have thus far been unable to hammer out a deal, leaving them in a stalemate since late August.</p>
        <p>Both Southern and Vattenfall have made it clear that the battle over the Berlin utility is part and parcel of a bid to take over VEAG itself.</p>
        <p>Mr. Harlan, an American Southerner who speaks fluent German, asserts that the German companies are simply trampling over their legal obligations.</p>
        <p>''I would never have expected that in a branch of industry as big as this one, that anyone would behave in this fashion,'' he said in a recent interview. ''It plays to the German stereotype, that it's either my way or the highway.''</p>
        <p>E.ON executives say Southern is wildly exaggerating the validity of its claims. ''They absolutely do not have any sort of pre-emptive right,'' said Erwin Hayden, a spokesman for E.ON.</p>
        <p>Here in Lippendorf, a pastoral village just south of Leipzig, workers appear passively resigned. The staff has been cut from several thousand at the time of German reunification to just 313 today. Most of those workers are on shortened workweeks, to avoid the need for laying off even more people.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the plant seems almost devoid of people even in the middle of the week. Automated conveyer belts deliver brown coal in crumbly rocks, which are pulverized and then fed into burners that transform water into high-pressure steam around the clock. Though lignite is high in sulfur and generated tons of sooty dust in the old East German plants, the new plant has reduced those emissions to about 3 percent of what they were 10 years ago.</p>
        <p>As a result of stripping out particulates from waste gases, the plant produces about one million tons of gypsum a year, with about half sold for industrial uses.</p>
        <p>Company executives say they can produce electricity for less than 3 pfennigs, or a bit more than one penny, a kilowatt hour. That is well below the cost of most rivals, which analysts say are about 4.5 pfennigs a kilowatt-hour.</p>
        <p>The problem is VEAG's debt, which totals about 5 billion marks, or about $2.3 billion. VEAG executives suggest that the company is worth as much as 3 billion marks, including the debt. But the aspiring buyers have yet to disclose their bids.</p>
        <p>The stakes are bigger than just Germany. Southern has acquired power companies in several other European countries and it trades electricity across the Continent. Vattenfall has plants in many countries and it recently acquired a majority stake in the biggest electric company in Warsaw.</p>
        <p>Vattenfall is also bidding for a stake in Poland's nationwide electricity distributor, a link that could prove valuable if it were also to acquire control of VEAG.</p>
        <p>But as many as 10 other companies are interested. NRG Energy has said it wants to team up with a German partner on a joint bid.</p>
        <p>NRG tried but failed to form an alliance with Vattenfall and the Hamburg utility. Then it put out feelers to Energie Baden-Wurttemburg, a power company based near Stuttgart that is partly owned by France's state-controlled electricity conglomerate. But German antitrust regulators shot down that idea last week, saying they did not want VEAG to fall in the hands of another big German electric company.</p>
        <p>Under a bidding process supervised by Schroder Salomon Smith Barney, all the bidders need to submit offers by Nov. 15 and government officials have ordered VEAG's main shareholders to sell their stakes by Dec. 13.</p>
        <p>To be sure, there are risks for any acquirer. In addition to its debt burden, VEAG must also contend with extremely tough competition and very low electricity prices.</p>
        <p>VEAG is also locked into a number of long-term contracts that even seasoned industry executives describe as baffling and potentially treacherous when it comes to projecting future costs and profits.</p>
        <p>But at the right price, analysts say, VEAG could be a very good deal.</p>
        <p>''These are the most modern lignite plants in central Europe, and they fulfill all the norms for environmental standards,'' said Lynn Reinhardt, a power industry analyst at Merrill Lynch in Frankfurt.</p>
        <p>''If the plants were fully depreciated, you would be making big money.''</p>
