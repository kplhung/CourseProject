        <p>Wednesday night's debate between Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas was watched by fewer people than any previous presidential debate except one, the second debate between President Clinton and Bob Dole four years ago, according to figures released yesterday by Nielsen Media Research.</p>
        <p>This week's debate, the second of three between Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush, was seen by about 37.6 million people on commercial broadcast networks and all-news cable channels, the Nielsen figures show. That is almost 10 million fewer people than the 46.6 million who watched their first presidential debate on Oct. 3.</p>

        <p>Wednesday night's debate between Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas was watched by fewer people than any previous presidential debate except one, the second debate between President Clinton and Bob Dole four years ago, according to figures released yesterday by Nielsen Media Research.</p>
        <p>This week's debate, the second of three between Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush, was seen by about 37.6 million people on commercial broadcast networks and all-news cable channels, the Nielsen figures show. That is almost 10 million fewer people than the 46.6 million who watched their first presidential debate on Oct. 3.</p>
        <p>Four years ago, the second Clinton-Dole debate was seen by about 36.3 million viewers.</p>
        <p>The falloff from the first debate was somewhat unexpected, because the potential audience for the second was larger. On the night of the first debate, the Fox network showed entertainment programming, and NBC gave its affiliates the option of showing a baseball playoff game. This week, one network, Fox, did not carry the debate live, opting instead for baseball.</p>
        <p>PBS stations broadcast both debates, but their audiences were not included in the figures assembled by Nielsen, which monitors only commercial channels. PBS's own estimate of its audience was about 2.6 million, down from 3.7 million.</p>
        <p>Among the many reasons for the low interest cited yesterday by pollsters and political experts were the ever-increasing number of channels available to American television viewers and the lack of compelling issues in the current race.</p>
        <p>Frank Newport, editor in chief of the Gallup Poll, said the one bit of empirical data he had on the debate was that ''apparently far fewer Gore supporters than Bush supporters decided to tune in the debate.''</p>
