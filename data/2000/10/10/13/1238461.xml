        <p>TRYING FOR THE FAST LANE  Ralph Nader and Patrick J. Buchanan are not the only third-party candidates complaining of a lack of news coverage. But at least they are eating.</p>
        <p>Jeremy Friedbaum, a harp maker and conservative from Provo, Utah, who is running for governor under the American Independent Party banner, has fasted since Sept. 8 to call attention to his campaign. Several Utah newspapers have featured him in recent articles, though it is doubtful he will gain enough fame to overtake the leading contenders, Gov. Michael O. Leavitt, a Republican who is seeking a third term, and the Democratic challenger, Bill Orton, a former congressman.</p>

        <p>THE STATES</p>
        <p>TRYING FOR THE FAST LANE  Ralph Nader and Patrick J. Buchanan are not the only third-party candidates complaining of a lack of news coverage. But at least they are eating.</p>
        <p>Jeremy Friedbaum, a harp maker and conservative from Provo, Utah, who is running for governor under the American Independent Party banner, has fasted since Sept. 8 to call attention to his campaign. Several Utah newspapers have featured him in recent articles, though it is doubtful he will gain enough fame to overtake the leading contenders, Gov. Michael O. Leavitt, a Republican who is seeking a third term, and the Democratic challenger, Bill Orton, a former congressman.</p>
        <p>The grandson of a Bronx rabbi who converted to Mormonism, Mr. Friedbaum, 45, says he has lost 46 pounds (from 252) and plans to continuing fasting until Thursday, when he plans to drink fruit juice and eat bread at a news conference at the Capitol in Salt Lake City.</p>
        <p>''I do look better,'' he said. ''The only problem is I'm a little low on energy. But at least I don't look like Gandhi in the movies, with those skinny arms.''</p>

        <p>THE HOUSE</p>
        <p>SUCCESSOR SOUGHT  Representative Bruce F. Vento of Minnesota had lung cancer and planned to retire in January. So an election campaign to replace Mr. Vento, a 12-term Democrat, was already under way in his St. Paul district when he died on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Come Nov. 7, a full-time successor will be chosen in the Fourth Congressional District. But who will serve the three months or so still remaining in Mr. Vento's final term?</p>
        <p>Nobody. There is no need, or time, for a special election to pick an interim successor, Gov. Jesse Ventura said, because Congress will probably adjourn in a few days.</p>
        <p>As for the campaign leading up to Nov. 7, a close, three-way race is under way. The candidates are Tom Foley, an independent (like his friend Mr. Ventura); State Representative Betty McCollum, a Democrat, and State Senator Linda Runbeck, a Republican.</p>

        <p>THE RUNNING MATES</p>
        <p>CHENEY PONDERS ANOTHER CONTEST  Making a pitch for the not-inconsiderable segment of the voting public that preferred watching baseball to watching the presidential debates, Dick Cheney went to the Mets-Cardinals game in St. Louis last night. Mr. Cheney admitted to having divided loyalties earlier this week, when he was asked by a New Mexico high school student, ''Knowing the current gas situation in the United States, and the complicated drawbacks in lowering the prices, who do you think will win in the World Series this year?'' Mr. Cheney admitted being a New York Yankees fan, and said he was intrigued by the possibility of a Subway Series.</p>
        <p>Ever the politician, he then hedged his bets, saying: ''I know the people who own the Cardinals, so basically I'm going to duck the question. I would say one thing: I am told there is a close correlation between victory in the World Series for the American League and Republican presidential victories at election time. So that kind of points me in another direction.''</p>

        <p>TRAVEL LOGS BY THE NUMBERS  A day after the second presidential debate, the candidates headed back to closely contested states.</p>
        <p>The stats:</p>
        <p>Length of official day: Gore, 11 1/2 hours; Bush, 12 hours</p>
        <p>States visited: Gore, 2; Bush, 2</p>
        <p>Towns/Cities visited: Gore, 2; Bush, 3</p>
        <p>Official Events: Gore, 1; Bush, 2</p>
        <p>Diners visited/drop-bys: Gore, 0; Bush, 1</p>
        <p>Press conferences: Gore, 1; Bush, 0</p>
        <p>Oval office meetings on the Middle East: Gore, 1; Bush, 0</p>
        <p>Main message: Gore, the Texas governor's misplaced priorities; Bush, commitment to the ''greatest generation''</p>
