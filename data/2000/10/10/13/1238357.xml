        <p>Vulnerability is not becoming in a quarterback, even if it attracts attention.</p>
        <p>Facing Atlanta's injury-prone quarterback Chris Chandler last weekend, the Giants blitzed until Chandler took himself out of the game. As the saying goes, the Giants knocked Chandler into next week. With bruised ribs, Chandler will also miss Atlanta's game this Sunday against St. Louis.</p>
        <p>Next for the Giants is Dallas Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman, who has had nine concussions in his career, including one in the season opener.</p>
        <p>The Giants may not find this situation as enticing.</p>
        <p>As Giants strong safety Sam Garnes said: ''In this case, if you knock out one future Hall of Famer, you just get another future Hall of Famer.''</p>
        <p>Randall Cunningham is Aikman's backup.</p>
        <p>''So if Troy leaves the game,'' Giants cornerback Jason Sehorn said today, ''then we get another top quarterback and we have to adjust to an offense that's going to be run completely different. You don't have to look for a quarterback draw if Troy is in, but you do if Randall is.''</p>
        <p>The subject of causing harm to Aikman was a dicey one in the Giants' locker room after today's practice -- and not just because Cunningham is the wild card in the defensive game plan.</p>
        <p>No player wanted to seem eager to injure another player, especially one as respected as Aikman. Yet even Aikman acknowledged this week that putting pressure on the quarterback is a priority for every defense.</p>
        <p>''One of the goals for a defense is to hit the quarterback and to hit him hard,'' Aikman said in a conference call with New York reporters. ''What the Giants are trying to do is no different than every other team in this league every week.''</p>
        <p>But Aikman's history of concussions is particularly notable. He had two in an eight-day span last season, meaning he has had three concussions in his last 13 starts.</p>
        <p>''It is something I don't take lightly,'' Aikman said of his injuries. ''It's something I evaluate at the end of each season as far as where I'm at and what it all means.''</p>
        <p>Aikman, who will be 34 next month, said he has discussed the subject with Steve Young, the former 49ers quarterback who retired earlier this year after a series of concussions.</p>
        <p>''I've had some talks with Steve and I don't know that he's gone through anything that I have not gone through,'' Aikman said. ''But it's kind of the blind leading the blind as far as that goes because no one knows what the long-term effects of it are. But the things that Steve experienced last year are things that I've experienced over the last year and a half.''</p>
        <p>Yet Aikman says he does not consider the effect of his concussions when he thinks about retirement.</p>
        <p>''It's not in the context of retirement, it is just in the context of my well-being,'' Aikman said.</p>
        <p>Sehorn believes Aikman plays like someone whose history of head injuries is never far from his thoughts.</p>
        <p>''He knows in the back of his head what can happen,'' Sehorn said. ''I think the whole league knows he's had nine concussions. But we just play the game. I don't think anyone says, 'I want to give him another one.'</p>
        <p>''I never think that way. My job is to knock the other guy down. I'm not trying to drive people into the ground. That means I'm driving myself into the ground, too. I'd rather they hit the ground and I don't have to.''</p>
        <p>Giants free safety Shaun Williams is a tenacious tackler and delivered one of the hits that sidelined Chandler, but he said today that there has been no talk of knocking Aikman from Sunday's game.</p>
        <p>''It's not, 'Hey, give him a concussion,' '' Williams said. ''We've been cautioned about that. It's more like, 'Let's knock him down.' Putting hits on the quarterback is part of the job.''</p>
        <p>Then there is the perspective of Giants defensive tackle Keith Hamilton.</p>
        <p>''Hitting the quarterback?'' Hamilton said. ''I'm concerned with all the hitting that goes on in front of him. I've got to go through the center and the guard. That's the hitting I'm concerned with. After I get through them, I'll concern myself with the next guy.''</p>
