        <p>An estimated 15,000 people and much of New York State's political establishment gathered on the streets near the Israeli Consulate in Midtown Manhattan yesterday to angrily condemn recent outbursts of Palestinian violence and rally behind Israel during what several speakers and politicians called one of the most critical moments in Israel's history.</p>
        <p>Raw emotions -- from screaming demonstrators to tearful, apprehensive ones -- were evident up and down Second Avenue, as dozens waved Israeli flags or held signs with slogans like ''We will not tolerate Palestinian acts of war,'' and ''Arab children are Arafat's assassins.''</p>

        <p>An estimated 15,000 people and much of New York State's political establishment gathered on the streets near the Israeli Consulate in Midtown Manhattan yesterday to angrily condemn recent outbursts of Palestinian violence and rally behind Israel during what several speakers and politicians called one of the most critical moments in Israel's history.</p>
        <p>Raw emotions -- from screaming demonstrators to tearful, apprehensive ones -- were evident up and down Second Avenue, as dozens waved Israeli flags or held signs with slogans like ''We will not tolerate Palestinian acts of war,'' and ''Arab children are Arafat's assassins.''</p>
        <p>Speakers ranging from Elie Wiesel to Gov. George E. Pataki chastised the Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat and urged New Yorkers and other Americans to resolutely support any action Israel deemed necessary to combat the violence.</p>
        <p>''We have dreams of Israeli and Palestinian children playing together, studying together, laughing together,'' said Mr. Wiesel, the Nobel laureate and chronicler of the Holocaust. ''It is with a heavy heart that we say that our dreams of peace have gone up into the smoke of ransacked synagogues, with the lynching of Israeli prisoners and the bloodthirsty mobs.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Wiesel continued: ''I blame the supreme leader of the Palestinians, Yasir Arafat. . . . All of his promises were lies. All of his commitments were false.''</p>
        <p>The New York Senate candidates Representative Rick A. Lazio and Hillary Rodham Clinton were there, repeating their recent criticism of  Saturday's United Nations Security Council resolution censuring Israel for its perceived role in escalating the violence. While saying that the crisis superceded politics, both candidates worked to try to solidify support among Jewish voters, with Mr. Lazio even walking up Second Avenue, alongside Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, waving to the demonstrators while Mrs. Clinton waited for her chance to speak.</p>
        <p>Before leaving a stage set up on  Second Avenue near the consulate, Mr. Lazio said, ''This is an opportunity for us in a united way to tell the world, to tell America that we stand shoulder to shoulder with the people of Israel.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton clearly had the harder time, as she was loudly booed by some in the crowd throughout her speech, evidence of the still simmering anger among some Jews for her previous support of an independent Palestinian state and the kiss she offered Mr. Arafat's wife, Suha, during a visit to Ramallah on the West Bank last year. But she persisted, never pausing during her speech.</p>
        <p>''Israel must always be able to protect its citizens and put an end to violence,'' she said, defending the country's right to react to attacks.</p>
        <p>Hundreds of police officers monitored the event, one of what organizers said were more than 30 rallies around the United States and Canada yesterday.</p>
        <p>The Manhattan rally shut off the sidewalk in front of the consulate and blocked vehicle traffic in the area around the demonstration, which stretched from 41st to 48th Street.</p>
        <p>Arab civic leaders from the New York City area said yesterday that they felt much of the criticism of the Palestinians was unfair, given their belief that Israel was responsible for the escalating conflict. Arab leaders are planning their own rally and prayer session starting at 11:30 Friday morning near the United Nations.</p>
        <p>''People are very frustrated, obviously,'' said Abdullah Al Fawal, the director of the U.S. Islamic Center in Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>''Yes, Palestinians are throwing rocks, but rocks are not bullets. And children's rocks will not kill someone.''</p>
        <p>The demonstrators and speakers both emphasized their wishes for peace. But following the killing of two captive Israeli soldiers yesterday by a Palestinian mob, there were few who voiced opposition to the decision by the Israeli government to send its helicopter gunships to strike targets in Palestinian-ruled cities.</p>
        <p>Groups of students at the Second Avenue rally chanted verses such as ''Jews unite, stand up and fight.''</p>
