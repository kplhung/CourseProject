        <p>The Yankees' losses at the end of the season were one-sided, embarrassing. But from behind the batting cage, the Yankees' hitting coach, Chris Chambliss, could see at least one redeeming quality in those dark days: Tino Martinez had found the timing in his swing.</p>
        <p>Martinez has been a support beam for the sagging Yankee offense since the start of the playoffs, batting .421 in the first round, mashing a three-run double in the decisive Game 5 against Oakland, and opening the American League Championship Series against Seattle with hits in half of his at-bats in Games 1 and 2.</p>
        <p>The Yankees and the Mariners, tied at 1-1 in their four-of-seven-game series, will play Game 3 here Friday night. The left-hander Andy Pettitte will start against the Seattle right-hander Aaron Sele. Both teams worked out here late this afternoon after arriving early this morning from the East Coast -- the fifth cross-country flight in 12 days for the Yankees, who sang ''Happy Birthday'' to pitcher Orlando Hernandez on the plane.</p>
        <p>''I know we enjoyed the trip last night,'' Manager Joe Torre said, ''because we got in at a decent hour for a change, and the fact that we don't have to play a game today. This is the first off day.</p>
        <p>''I think when it is all said and done and our season ends -- hopefully our season ends when baseball ends -- I think everybody will be exhausted. But I think until that time, I think it is basically on adrenaline.''</p>
        <p>Martinez is responsible for some of that emotional juice, after contributing to the seven-run rally in the eighth inning of Game 2 on Wednesday night. After Bernie Williams singled home David Justice with the tying run, Martinez followed with a line drive to left field. Seattle's Al Martin came in cautiously and let the ball hit his glove and fall for a single, and the Yankees went on to score six more runs.</p>
        <p>What the left-handed-hitting Martinez did in that at-bat -- ripping the ball to left field -- was something that he struggled to do most of the season, when he batted .258 with 16 homers and 91 runs batted in, poor numbers in comparison to those he had put up in the past.</p>
        <p>''The last couple of weeks, he's been hitting pretty solid, keeping his weight back,'' Chambliss said. ''When he's staying back and thinking about hitting the ball to left-center, he's going to hit.''</p>
        <p>When Martinez is swinging the bat well, he enjoys talking about his hitting as much as someone with arachnophobia likes to discuss spiders.</p>
        <p>''I'm feeling good,'' Martinez said, turning his head away, physically distancing himself from the question. ''I haven't done anything different.</p>
        <p>''I haven't looked back on the year. I'm not going to talk about it, I'm not going to do that with you guys, because then I'll start thinking about the numbers.''</p>
        <p>One of Torre's longstanding theories is that Martinez thought a lot about numbers after slugging 44 homers in 1997, that he felt the need to repeat those numbers. Rather than maintain the approach of trying to drive the ball through the middle, Torre said he thinks Martinez felt some pressure to continue producing homers, tried to pull the ball and got away from what doing what had always made him successful.</p>
        <p>Martinez hit 28 homers in 1998, 28 in 1999, and those numbers declined this year. Scouts who followed the Yankees this year generally believed that Martinez, whose swing is more mechanical than loose and fluid, kept opening his front shoulder just a millisecond too soon, in an effort to drive pitches to the right side of the field.</p>
        <p>That ruined his timing, and hence, Martinez often hit weak pop-ups. ''He looked like he was just feeling for the ball,'' said one American League scout, waving his arms like someone searching for a light switch in the dark.</p>
        <p>Torre held a team meeting Aug. 25 and told the Yankees it was too late in the season to worry anymore about what their final statistics were going to look like. It was too late, for example, for Martinez to hit 30 homers and drive in 120 runs.</p>
        <p>Martinez kept working at his swing, trying to regain a comfortable feeling. His is a regimented approach to batting practice; Chambliss compared it to that of Don Mattingly, who took more batting practice than anyone Chambliss has ever seen.</p>
        <p>In an indoor cage, Chambliss will toss pitches to Martinez underhand, while Martinez hacks at them holding a bat in one hand. Martinez will hit off a tee, then hit soft tosses from Chambliss with two hands before he begins his regular rounds of batting practice.</p>
        <p>''He's like a lot of guys here -- he needs a lot of batting practice to keep that feel for what he's doing,'' Chambliss said.</p>
        <p>Martinez has at least one hit in each of the Yankees' seven playoff games, and in Game 2 of this series, he went 3 for 4. ''The fact that he didn't have the year he has come to expect, and he's doing what he's doing now, you've got to give him a lot of credit,'' center fielder Bernie Williams said. ''He didn't give up, and I guess this postseason has been a good stage for him to catch up on that frustration.''</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>JOE TORRE has not decided who will pitch Game 5. He could start DENNY NEAGLE, who pitched effectively in Game 1, and give his other three starters a chance to work with full rest. Or, if the Yankees are trailing, three games to one, Torre would have the option of turning to ORLANDO HERNANDEZ on three days' rest. The Yankees have never lost a game pitched by Hernandez in the postseason.</p>
