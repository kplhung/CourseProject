        <p>''You're not going to win too much in this league with two runs or one run,'' Manager Lou Piniella said. ''We've got to find ways to take advantage of opportunities. There's no question. But in the postseason, you are going to face better pitching, and the higher you go up the ladder, the better it gets.''</p>
