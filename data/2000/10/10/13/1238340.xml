        <p>A selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy opera, classical music and dance events this weekend in the New York metropolitan region.</p>
        <p>Opera</p>
        <p>''THE BALLAD OF BROKEN AX MOUNTAIN,'' Kunqu Society. Chen Shi-Zheng's production of ''The Peony Pavilion,'' which recently found its way to Aarhus, Denmark, put the kunqu variety of Chinese opera on the map in New York last year, though not in a way that satisfied members of the Kunqu Society, which considers itself a guardian of the tradition. Here the company offers another work from the 16th century, in which a poor woman is thwarted in her pursuit of wealth and happiness by those around her. Zhang Jiqing, an acclaimed kunqu performer, makes her New York debut in the lead role. Tonight at 8, Kaye Playhouse, 68th Street between Park and Lexington Avenues, (212) 772-4448. Tickets: $25 and $40; $20 and $35 for the elderly; $15 for students (James R. Oestreich).</p>

        <p>A selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy opera, classical music and dance events this weekend in the New York metropolitan region.</p>
        <p>Opera</p>
        <p>''THE BALLAD OF BROKEN AX MOUNTAIN,'' Kunqu Society. Chen Shi-Zheng's production of ''The Peony Pavilion,'' which recently found its way to Aarhus, Denmark, put the kunqu variety of Chinese opera on the map in New York last year, though not in a way that satisfied members of the Kunqu Society, which considers itself a guardian of the tradition. Here the company offers another work from the 16th century, in which a poor woman is thwarted in her pursuit of wealth and happiness by those around her. Zhang Jiqing, an acclaimed kunqu performer, makes her New York debut in the lead role. Tonight at 8, Kaye Playhouse, 68th Street between Park and Lexington Avenues, (212) 772-4448. Tickets: $25 and $40; $20 and $35 for the elderly; $15 for students (James R. Oestreich).</p>
        <p>''DON GIOVANNI.'' The Met's production of Mozart's ''Don Giovanni'' has been spruced up, restaged and admirably cast. Bryn Terfel makes the title role particularly sinister, but he sings like an angel. Likewise Renee Fleming as Donna Anna. James Levine conducts with his customary effect. Not to be missed if you can manage to get a ticket. Metropolitan Opera House, (212) 362-6000. Tomorrow at 8 p.m. Standing-room tickets available for $12 and $16 (Bernard Holland).</p>
        <p>''LUCIA DI LAMMERMOOR'' Amato Opera's new season opened last month and, sadly, for the first time in nearly 50 years the fans of this family-run opera company were not greeted in the theater lobby by Sally Amato, the co-founder, who died in August at 82. But the company, still run by Ms. Amato's husband, Anthony, goes on. This is the last weekend to catch the season-opening revival of Donizetti's ''Lucia di Lammermoor.'' Performances are tonight, tomorrow night and Sunday afternoon. Mr. Amato conducts. Amato Opera Theater, 319 Bowery; tonight and tomorrow at 7:30 p.m. and Sunday at 2:30 p.m.; (212) 228-8200. Tickets: $25; $20 for the elderly and children under 12 (Anthony Tommasini).</p>
        <p>''MADAMA BUTTERFLY,'' New York City Opera. Mark Lamos's production of Puccini's great work, introduced at the Glimmerglass Opera in 1997 and at the City Opera the next year, holds up well, offering a clean canvas for the compelling lighting design of Robert Wierzel. The performance mostly does justice to the production, with Andrew Richards a strong Pinkerton and Jake Gardner a worthy foil as Sharpless. The whole thing may be even better by now if Susan Bullock, effective in her middle range in the title role, has toned down the shrillness of her high notes on opening night, and Jorge Mester, the conductor, has arrived at a considerate balance for the singers. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., New York State Theater, (212) 870-5570. Tickets: $25 to $98 (Oestreich).</p>
        <p>''LE NOZZE DI FIGARO.'' This John Copley production has been in the New York City Opera's repertory for about a quarter century, but it is attractive and compact and does what a ''Figaro'' production should, which is foster the sense of ensemble and precision comic timing upon which the work depends. The company offers a youthful, well-balanced cast that includes Sari Gruber as Susanna, Dean Ely as Figaro, Paula Rasmussen as Cherubino, Pamela Armstrong as the Countess and John Hancock as the Count. Steuart Bedford conducts. Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., the New York State Theater, (212) 870-5570. Tickets: $25 to $98 (Allan Kozinn).</p>
        <p>''SAMSON ET DALILA.'' Placido Domingo is the main draw of the Metropolitan Opera revival of its 1998 production of Saint-Saens's ''Samson et Dalila.'' Mr. Domingo, who is approaching 60, is singing better than opera buffs have any right to expect. His sound retains its poignant timbre and charisma. And he takes the high notes fearlessly. In her Met debut, Irina Mishura, a Russian mezzo-soprano, sings Dalila. The production offers hanging scrims brush-stroked with lurid shades of red, orange and black, not to mention a stage-ful of gyrating, scantily clad men and women in the bacchanal scene. But the theatrics do not compensate for the long stretches of tepid music in this flawed score. Mark Elder conducts. Metropolitan Opera House, tomorrow at 1 p.m.; (212) 362-6000.  Tickets: $180 and $250 (Tommasini).</p>
        <p>''LA TRAVIATA,'' New York City Opera. Here is something increasingly rare at the City Opera: a work from the center of the repertory in a fully conventional production, this one of Verdi's opera, by Renata Scotto. The sets, offering a certain Zeffirellian sumptuousness on a small scale, require singers with a strong stage presence, and Mary Dunleavy, in the title role, certainly fills the bill with a lovely voice put at the service of an all-around dramatic intensity. Stephen Powell, as Giorgio Germont, stood up to her on opening night; Bruce Fowler, as Alfredo, fared less well in a colorless performance. Joseph Rescigno conducted loosely. Tonight at 8, New York State Theater, (212) 870-5570. Tickets: $25 to $98 (Oestreich).</p>
        <p>''TOSCA.'' The scrappy Dicapo Opera Theater, which opened its season last weekend with Puccini's ''Tosca,'' usually performs in a wonderfully intimate theater in the lower level of the Church of St. Jean Baptiste at Lexington Avenue and East 76th Street. But the director, Michael Capasso, has had the interesting idea  of moving upstairs to the sanctuary for the opera's first act, which is set in the Church of Sant'Andrea della Valle. Acts II and III will be performed downstairs in the theater. With these performances in the original Italian, the company will also inaugurate its Dicapotitles system, designed especially for the space. Michael Recchiuti conducts. Allison Charney and Susan Foster alternate in the title role. Dicapo Opera Theater, Lexington Avenue at East 76th Street, Manhattan; tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday at 4 p.m., (212) 288-9438. All performances are sold out, but standing-room tickets are available for $16 (Tommasini).</p>
        <p>''TURN OF THE SCREW.'' Mark Lamos's psychologically astute production of this Britten classic -- a setting of the Henry James story -- is back at the New York City Opera and is worth catching. The cast includes Amy Burton as the Governess, Maire O'Brien as Miss Jessel, Eugenie Grunewald as Mrs. Grose, Sandra Joseph as Flora, Jacob Ashforth as Miles and Jeffrey Lentz as the Prologue and Quint. Sunday at 1:30 p.m., New York State Theater. Tickets: $25 to $98; (212) 870-5570 (Kozinn).</p>
        <p>Classical Music</p>
        <p>AMERICAN COMPOSERS ORCHESTRA. Dennis Russell Davies conducts the orchestra in a tour of east Asia, perhaps finding ''Common Ground,'' to quote the title of the opening piece, by Melissa Hui. After that comes Chinary Ung's rhapsody ''Inner Voices,'' followed by a new piece from P. Q. Phan, ''When the Worlds Mixed and Times Merged.'' The theme of mixing worlds and times is continued, then, in Lou Harrison's part-Asian, part-American Piano Concerto, for which the soloist will be the estimable Ursula Oppens. Sunday at 3 p.m. Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800. Tickets: $16, $35 and $46 (Paul Griffiths).</p>
        <p>BARGEMUSIC. Schubert was to have loomed large at Bargemusic this weekend, but if you've circled the all-Schubert program scheduled for tonight and Sunday, that pleasure will have to wait: because of a reconfiguration of the performers, the program has been changed to include a Beethoven String Trio (Op. 3) and an Arensky String Quartet (Op. 35). The program tomorrow remains unchanged: it includes string quintets by Mozart and Mendelssohn. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 7:30 p.m. and Sunday at 4 p.m. Bargemusic, Fulton Ferry Landing, Brooklyn, (718) 624-4061 or (718) 624-2083. Tickets: $27; $25 for the elderly; $15 for students. Tomorrow's concert is sold out, but returns may be available (Kozinn).</p>
        <p>BEAUX-ARTS TRIO. After decades of stability, this group has undergone several changes of personnel in recent years. But a listener who has yet to hear its latest manifestation, with Young Uck Kim as violinist and Antonio Meneses as cellist, must assume that Menahem Pressler, the wise and energetic pianist, has kept a firm hand on its rudder. Although the group's ventures into the contemporary have never been particularly frequent, here it adds Alfred Schnittke's Piano Trio to more typical fare, trios by Mendelssohn (Op. 66) and Brahms (Op. 87). Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 570-3949. Tickets: $35 (Oestreich).</p>
        <p>CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETY OF LINCOLN CENTER. The society opened its season last month with a program of concertos by Vivaldi and Bach. Now, after one more Bach concerto (BWV 1055, reconstructed for oboe d'Amore and played by Stephen Taylor), it gets down to more typical business with Dvorak's ''American'' Quartet, performed by the Orion String Quartet. It also introduces a new commissioned work by Bruce Adolphe, ''A Thousand Years of Love,'' sung by Sylvia McNair. Mr. Adolphe, the society's education director and one of the most entertaining preconcert lecturers around, introduces the program at 4:30. Sunday at 5 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, (212) 875-5788. Tickets: $27.50 and $37.50; $10 rush tickets for students; 10 percent off both prices for the elderly (Oestreich).</p>
        <p>ENSEMBLE FOR EARLY MUSIC. The first concerts of this fine period-instrument band's season are devoted to the music of the Ars Nova, a compositional era (from roughly 1300 to 1400) that took its name from a treatise by the 14th-century bishop and composer Philippe de Vitry. Included on the ensemble's program are works by Machaut, Landini and Jacop da Bologna, as well as French rondeaux and ballades. Tonight and tomorrow at 8; Sunday at 3. The Cathedral of St. John the Divine, Amsterdam Avenue at 112th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 280-0330; www.  earlymusicny.org. Tickets: $25 (Kozinn).</p>
        <p>GERALD FINLEY. The first prominent appearance of the Canadian baritone Gerald Finley in New York came with his well-received 1998 Metropolitan Opera debut as Papageno in Mozart's ''Magic Flute.'' On Sunday, this young artist, with his attractive baritone voice and winning stage manner, makes his New York recital debut at the Frick Collection with the pianist Julius Drake in an interesting program of songs by Loewe, Wolf, Duparc, Ravel and the British composer Mark-Anthony Turnage. Mr. Finley returns to the Met next month as Papageno and later in the season as Puccini's Marcello. The Frick Collection, 1 East 70th Street; Sunday at 5 p.m.; the concert is free, but tickets ordered in advance are required; all tickets have been distributed, but returns may be available beginning at 4:30 p.m. For information: (212) 288-0700 (Tommasini).</p>
        <p>EVGENY KISSIN. Four days after his 29th birthday, this monumentally gifted piano virtuoso celebrates the 10th anniversary of his North American debut. Technically, it seems, Mr. Kissin can do anything, but his interpretations have occasionally proved wild and erratic in recent years. In the challenging but fundamentally unshowy program he plays here -- Beethoven's D minor Sonata (Op. 31, No. 2), Schumann's ''Carnaval'' and Brahms's Sonata in F minor (Op. 5) -- a listener is inclined to hope for the beginnings of a settled maturity. Tomorrow at 7:30 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800. Tickets: $23 to $116 (Oestreich).</p>
        <p>NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC. It's hard to believe: tomorrow is the 10th anniversary of the death of Leonard Bernstein, a father figure for a generation of listeners and as great a musical figurehead as the American orchestral world has had. The New York Philharmonic, long Bernstein's musical home, is celebrating its association with him this season, both with the release of a 10-CD set of his live recordings with the orchestra, and by performing some of his works. Leonard Slatkin opens this week's programs with Bernstein's ''Jeremiah'' Symphony, with Rinat Shaham as the mezzo-soprano soloist. Also on the program, Mitsuko Uchida is the soloist in the Mendelssohn G minor Piano Concerto, and the orchestra ends the evening with the Dvorak Symphony No. 8. Tonight and tomorrow evening at 8, Avery Fisher Hall, (212) 721-6500. Tickets: $19 to $80 (Kozinn).</p>
        <p>SOLO FLIGHTS 2000. In a series presented by Composers Collaborative a handful of the best new music pianists in New York are cutting a wide swath through the contemporary repertory. In the first of two concerts tonight, Anthony De Mare plays several works by Henry Cowell (''Exultation,'' ''Aeolian Harp'' and ''Tiger'') as well as Frank Zappa's piano introduction to ''Little House I Used to Live In'';  Louis Andriessen's ''Image de Moreau''; and works by Conlon Nancarrow, Lou Harrison, Toru Takemitsu, Guido Lopez Gavilan and Frederic Rzewski. After Mr. De Mare's concert, Kathleen Supove performs Philip Glass's ''Mad Rush,'' David Lang's ''Memory Pieces'' and the United States premiere of ''The Same Sky'' by Carolyn Yarnell. Tomorrow evening begins with a repeat of Ms. Supove's concert, and also offers a performance by Jed Distler, whose program includes his own ''Cordel,'' Mr. Rzewski's ''No Place to Go  but Around,'' works by Wendy Mae Chambers and Douglas Geers and the premiere of Tina Davidson's ''Mango Poem.'' Ms. Davidson's work is a collaboration with Regie Cabico, a  poet who is to participate in the performance in a staging by Valeria Vasilevski. Tonight at 7 (Mr. De Mare) and 9 (Ms. Supove), tomorrow at 7 (Ms. Supove) and 9 (Mr. Distler). The Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street. (800) 965-4827. Tickets: $15; students and the elderly, $8 (Kozinn).</p>
        <p>JOSE VAN DAM. The always elegant Jose Van Dam sings the second of two recitals devoted to the French song literature. Mr. Van Dam will go back to Berlioz, dwell on Debussy and Duparc and get as far toward the present as Poulenc. Maciej Pikulski is the pianist. A superior event for vocal music lovers. Alice Tully Hall, Sunday at 2 p.m., (212) 721-6500. Tickets: $42 (Holland).</p>
        <p>Dance</p>
        <p>AMERICAN REPERTORY BALLET. A spirited, well-trained classical ballet company will present new dances by Kirk Peterson, Mark Godden and the company director, Graham Lustig, set to film music by Bernard Hermann and scores by Poulenc and Copland.
