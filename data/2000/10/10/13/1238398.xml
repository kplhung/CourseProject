        <p>Investors' disenchantment with Internet investments prompted The New York Times Company to back away yesterday from its plans for an initial public offering of a stock that would track the performance of its online subsidiary, New York Times Digital.</p>

        <p>Investors' disenchantment with Internet investments prompted The New York Times Company to back away yesterday from its plans for an initial public offering of a stock that would track the performance of its online subsidiary, New York Times Digital.</p>
        <p>The company announced that it was withdrawing its registration of the proposed tracking stock until market conditions improved. ''This is a symptom of the marketplace's reaction'' to Internet companies, Martin A. Nisenholtz, the chief executive of New York Times Digital, said yesterday. ''It went from irrational exuberance to unqualified pessimism.''</p>
        <p>Earlier, in a prepared statement, Mr. Nisenholtz said, ''If we proceeded with the offering now, we would not receive the valuation we deserve.''</p>
        <p>The Times Company had been one of several media companies that planned or at least had laid the groundwork for issuing stock based on Internet assets. Some industry analysts applauded such strategies in 1999 and the early weeks of 2000, before the first sharp dip in technology stock prices last spring.</p>
        <p>The Times Company announced its intention to issue a tracking stock in January; it won shareholder approval of the plan at the company's annual meeting in May. At the time, a company statement said executives would ''carefully consider market conditions prior to proceeding'' with the offering.</p>
        <p>The Times Company made its announcement on the same day that another large media company, the Tribune Company, announced it was eliminating 80 jobs at its Tribune Interactive group, laying off 34 people, 20 of them at Los Angeles Times .com. The move was made to consolidate ''operating efficiencies'' possible because of Tribune's acquisition of the Times Mirror Company, said John Lyday, a spokesman for the company.</p>
        <p>New York Times Digital -- which includes the Web sites NYTimes .com, Boston.com, NYtoday.com and Abuzz, a unit which seeks to match user queries with expert answers -- posted third-quarter revenue yesterday of $12.1 million, a gain of 97.8 percent compared with $6.1 million in the period a year earlier. Operating losses grew to $20.7 million for the quarter, compared with $8.1 million in the quarter a year earlier.</p>
        <p>However, Mr. Nisenholtz said, the group expects to have positive cash flow in 2002 as the number of revenue sources continues to expand beyond the traditional banner advertising into new areas like classified advertising or advertising to special e-mail clients.</p>
        <p>NYTimes.com, the site with the largest single audience of the company's offerings, had 12.8 million registered users in August. About 4.2 million individual users visited the site that month and, on average, each of these visited the site about four times.</p>
