        <p>''Out of nothing, nothing'' is the theme of this show. Which is another way of saying, out of catastrophe, something. The work on view stems from a loss suffered by the French painter Charles Belle last year when a ship containing three of his very large paintings sank on the way back from a touring show that commemorated the 150th anniversary of the abolition of slavery in French Guiana.</p>

        <p>'Ex Nihilo Nihil'</p>
        <p>Denise Cade Gallery</p>

        <p>Through Oct. 21</p>
        <p>''Out of nothing, nothing'' is the theme of this show. Which is another way of saying, out of catastrophe, something. The work on view stems from a loss suffered by the French painter Charles Belle last year when a ship containing three of his very large paintings sank on the way back from a touring show that commemorated the 150th anniversary of the abolition of slavery in French Guiana.</p>
        <p>In tribute to his drowned works and their unsettling fate, Mr. Belle has filled the gallery with small, individual paintings of flowers and occasional fruits, among them purple figs succulently ripe to the bursting point, that seem to celebrate their own existence. With thick, lustrous brush strokes, he captures the blooms in their most dramatic moments of color -- irises in deep purple and white with tongues of yellow, white peonies with a touch of lavender, funnel-shaped freesia in white against a brilliant yellow-green ground.</p>
        <p>Although the works are in the still life tradition, that category is too stilted for them. Seeing the show is more like walking into a garden ablaze with life.</p>
