        <p>The Environmental Protection Agency effectively revoked the license yesterday for the genetically engineered corn that has now been linked to the nationwide recalls of two brands of taco shells.</p>
        <p>The agency said the developer of the corn, Aventis S.A., had agreed to voluntarily cancel its marketing license ''at the strong urging'' of the E.P.A. Stephen Johnson, a deputy assistant administrator of the E.P.A., said that the agency was planning to revoke the permit formally, but that a voluntary withdrawal was quicker.</p>
        <p>The corn, known as StarLink, was approved in 1998 for use as animal feed but not for human consumption because of concerns that it could cause allergic reactions. With yesterday's action, StarLink corn can no longer be planted for any agricultural purpose at all.</p>
        <p>The announcement came a day after Safeway Inc. said it would remove its house brand of taco shells from store shelves after a coalition of groups critical of biotechnology detected the StarLink corn in samples purchased from a Washington-area supermarket. In late September, Kraft Foods, a subsidiary of Philip Morris, voluntarily recalled its Taco Bell brand taco shells after they were found to contain the StarLink corn.</p>
        <p>At a news conference in Washington yesterday, the activist coalition Genetically Engineered Food Alert said that nearly three weeks after the Kraft recall, the taco shells were still being sold and that the group had purchased Kraft shells this week. The group showed a Safeway advertisement from The Washington Post on Sunday and a Giant supermarket ad from yesterday's Post, both advertising Taco Bell taco dinner kits for sale at reduced prices.</p>
        <p>''There appears to be absolutely no oversight of the recall,'' said Philip E. Clapp, president of the National Environmental Trust, one of the groups in the coalition.</p>
        <p>Brian Dowling, a Safeway spokesman, said the company was investigating the matter and had issued an ''all points bulletin'' to its stores to make sure the Kraft products were removed. A Kraft spokesman said the advertising inserts were printed before the recall. He said that Kraft had visited Washington-area stores to make sure the products were no longer on shelves.</p>
        <p>The E.P.A. action represents the first time a license for a biotechnology crop has been effectively revoked, Mr. Johnson said. Dow Agrosciences and Novartis recently canceled their license to sell a genetically engineered corn after some experts questioned its effectiveness. But Mr. Johnson said the E.P.A. had not pressured the companies to do that.</p>
        <p>Aventis, a big European drug and agriculture company, had already said it would voluntarily stop selling StarLink seeds, so the revocation of its permit might not have much practical effect. In cooperation with the E.P.A. and the Department of Agriculture, Aventis is also trying to buy up all of this year's harvest of StarLink to ensure that it does not get into the food supply.</p>
        <p>Mr. Johnson said Aventis had the responsibility to ensure that the corn did not get into the human food supply. ''The evidence indicates a clear violation of the terms and condition of their license,'' he said. Aventis said it required farmers who grew StarLink to sign agreements saying they would use the corn only for animal feed or industrial use. But Mr. Johnson said there was evidence that some growers did not sign such agreements.</p>
        <p>Safeway, the nation's third-largest supermarket chain, said the recall would affect 1,200 stores. It is also stopping sales of taco shells sold by Mission Foods, the manufacturer of the Safeway brand shells.</p>
        <p>Peter Pitts, a spokesman for Mission Foods, said yesterday that the flour for the Safeway shells came from the same mill in Plainview, Tex., that supplied the flour for the Kraft product. That mill belongs to Azteca Milling, which is controlled by Gruma S.A. of Mexico, the company that owns Mission Foods.</p>
        <p>That raises the prospect that there could be other contaminated products. Azteca is the largest producer of corn flour for use in tortillas and tacos in the United States. Mission Foods, based in Irving, Tex., is the largest tortilla manufacturer in the United States and makes private-label products for many supermarket chains, Mr. Pitts said, though he declined to name other customers. Mr. Pitts said Mission was testing its products for the presence of StarLink.</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman for Azteca said the company was still investigating whether the flour was contaminated and if so how it happened.</p>
        <p>Safeway said it was dismayed that when the Kraft taco shell contamination first came to light, Mission Foods had offered assurances that there was no problem with its taco shells. Mission Foods released a letter it had sent to its customers shortly after the Kraft recall saying, ''All the corn varieties used by our supplier of corn flour are F.D.A. approved.'' But the letter said the company was shifting its flour supply away from the Texas mill.</p>
