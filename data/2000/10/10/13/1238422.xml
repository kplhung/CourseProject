        <p>Urbanfetch, the online delivery service that was started in New York less than a year ago to compete with Kozmo.com, announced that it was shutting down its Web site and would lay off more than 160 employees.

        <p>Urbanfetch, the online delivery service that was started in New York less than a year ago to compete with Kozmo.com, announced that it was shutting down its Web site and would lay off more than 160 employees. Urbanfetch officials said they would continue operating its business courier company.</p>
        <p>Cities were initially considered ideal for companies like Urbanfetch and Kozmo, which offer free delivery of goods ordered online within an hour. But many online delivery companies have struggled in places like Manhattan because of traffic congestion, logistical problems, tough competition from bricks-and-mortar businesses and low consumer demand for large quantities and high-margin items.</p>
        <p>Urbanfetch is one of several desktop-to-doorstep service companies that have felt the effects of a drought in the market for initial public offerings and an unwillingness by investors to pour cash into unproven Internet businesses since the Nasdaq dropped sharply in April.</p>
        <p>Urbanfetch would not say how many employees it had, but company officials said they expected to lay off more than 100 workers in New York and about 60 in London. The Web site will operate for a few weeks until the inventory in Urbanfetch's warehouses is sold, the officials said.</p>
        <p>The demise of Urbanfetch's online service, which delivered everything from movie videotapes to DVD players in much of Manhattan and Brooklyn, raises further questions about that sector of the Internet industry, analysts said.</p>
        <p>Ross Stevens, the chief executive of Urbanfetch, said: ''We were unable to raise sufficient capital to continue with our business-to-consumer operation. I think that is a reflection of the current market situation right now. The financing markets have effectively shut down for companies like ours.''</p>
        <p>Kozmo had been in talks to buy Urbanfetch, but negotiations broke down on Tuesday. Mr. Stevens said the two sides could not agree on a strategy for delivering goods to consumers. But Kozmo officials said they pulled out of the talks because of concerns that Urbanfetch's finances were in worse shape than the company had indicated.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Urbanfetch said it was abandoning its consumer business entirely and focusing instead on its courier service for businesses, which was started six months ago. Urbanfetch officials had considered expanding deliveries to include wines and other goods, as well as offering its service farther into Brooklyn and Upper Manhattan. But that was several months ago, in a different market for technology stocks. Yesterday, the talk at Urbanfetch headquarters at 538 Broadway, in the heart of Silicon Alley, was more sober.</p>
        <p>''We are becoming just like any other courier service,'' one official said.</p>
        <p>Urbanfetch officials said its business service, called Urbanfetch Express, would place contract couriers in corporate offices. Many Urbanfetch employees held out hope yesterday that they would be transferred to the courier operation, but one company executive said that few of them would be retained.</p>
        <p>Unlike Urbanfetch, which operates in London, Manhattan and Brooklyn, Urbanfetch Express exists only in Manhattan. It has contracts with Conde Nast, Ernst &amp; Young, PriceWaterhouseCoopers and several other large corporations. Mr. Stevens said that Urbanfetch Express was already profitable and larger than its consumer operations.</p>
        <p>The company plans to sell its assets, including the leases on its corporate offices and its warehouse at 560 West 34th Street, officials said. Urbanfetch plans to retain the software and some of the technology behind the Web site although none of the courier business is conducted over the Internet.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stevens, a former hedge fund manager at Integrity Capital Management, started Urbanfetch last year soon after Joseph Park, a founder of Kozmo, sought money from him. Kozmo sued Urbanfetch, charging that it copied its business model, and the two sides eventually reached a settlement.</p>
        <p>Employees said yesterday that they had suspected for a long time that something -- either a merger or an acquisition -- was coming.</p>
        <p>Jean Lee, who has been the art director at Urbanfetch since the company opened, said that she was sad yesterday morning as she walked across the Brooklyn Bridge on her way to work and saw two Urbanfetch couriers.</p>
        <p>''The last six months, since the big scare in April, things were starting to come together, and in my own department, they were clicking very well,'' Ms. Lee said.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, officials at Kozmo, which operates in 11 cities, said that they expected to soon be profitable in markets they had been in longer, like New York, where it opened in 1998. Kozmo, which has raised more than $280 million from investors, is generally considered better financed than Urbanfetch, analysts said. Both companies are based in New York.</p>
        <p>The closure of Urbanfetch makes Kozmo the only game in town, and analysts said that it was likely to have some impact on investor confidence in the online delivery industry. The industry has been criticized for ignoring many of the obstacles for such services in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>But yesterday, some were optimistic. ''You have to have a profit-minded business model in these times,'' said Ned Vickers, the president of NedExpress, a new online service scheduled to operate in TriBeCa, Wall Street and Battery Park City. ''We have the benefit of learning from the mistakes of the old gold-rush companies.''</p>
