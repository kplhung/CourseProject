        <p>Aleksei Yashin is the most talented player on a good Ottawa hockey team. Two years ago, he was captain of the Senators and the runner-up for the Hart trophy as the most valuable player in the National Hockey League.</p>
        <p>But when Yashin touches the puck tonight in a home game against the Stanley Cup champion Devils in the Corel Center, many of the Canadian hockey sophisticates in the usually polite audience will probably boo and jeer him. Yashin says he will understand it and try to ignore it.</p>
        <p>''Business is business,'' Yashin said. ''Hockey is hockey. They can do whatever they want. They pay some money. It's a free country.''</p>
        <p>Even though Yashin is back in uniform after missing last season in a contract dispute, the team and the league are continuing a legal action against him for financial damages. League lawyers want Yashin to pay the team almost $1 million. They say the Senators would have advanced further in the playoffs last spring had Yashin played instead of trying to force a contract renegotiation for a wage higher than $3.6 million.</p>
        <p>''I don't understand them making an example of me or why are they trying to punish me,'' Yashin said. ''I didn't do anything against the law. I used my rights within the law.''</p>
        <p>Yashin said he is puzzled by the continued legal action against him, even though he lost his bid for restricted free agency in arbitration and returned, defeated, to play out his contract this season.</p>
        <p>''If I owed them another year, how can they get damages?'' Yashin said. ''In English, how do you guys say it, 'You can't have your cake to look at  and eat it at the same time.' ''</p>
        <p>More than just a battle between a player and a team, the Yashin case is a skirmish in the continuing cold war between the N.H.L. and the players association. Since Commissioner Gary Bettman ordered a 15-week lockout in 1994 to hold down salary escalation, the average wage has grown from $572,161 to $1.355 million.</p>
        <p>Despite league warnings that high wages would ruin the business, the N.H.L. has grown from 26 to 30 teams. More than two-thirds of them play in large, new arenas, and more are planned. Television revenue is up and so is exposure, with ABC and ESPN offering a higher profile. Management and labor are bound in a collective bargaining agreement until 2004. But that does not prevent bitter holdouts and other individual disputes.</p>
        <p>Yashin, underpaid by current market standards, took a hard line last fall and led with his chin into a combination of legal and image punches. The team chairman, Rod Bryden, is well connected in Canadian political circles. While fighting Yashin, Bryden also successfully lobbied for local tax breaks and raised ticket prices. He convinced some people he was doing his patriotic duty. Canada cannot afford to lose another team, he warned the fans. Many in the Canadian news media echoed his cry.</p>
        <p>Yashin is from Russia, which provided a real, but usually unspoken, undercurrent in the Canadian capital: they're taking our jobs! A few weeks after he failed to report to training camp, the Senators suspended him; they drew a line in the snow and froze him out. The union supported him, without notable enthusiasm. Some of his teammates spoke out against him. And the arbitrator ruled that he would not qualify for restricted free agency until he actually honored his contract. Yashin could not simply turn down his 1999-2000 salary, refuse to report and wait for the contract to expire last summer.</p>
        <p>Sure, the Senators could have saved face and avoided confrontation with a contract extension, a signing bonus and a higher wage for the future. Or, they could have traded Yashin for valuable players to help them immediately. Instead, with the strong backing of league headquarters, the Senators fought and won a significant victory.</p>
        <p>Yashin's defeat might not mean much for the next group negotiation in four years. But it gave club owners a sense of control and certainly set a precedent for any player who tries a similar ploy. In order to recover his market value, Yashin must play well this season, produce points and rebuild his image.</p>
        <p>William Daly, the N.H.L.'s chief legal officer, said the case ''was significant in the fact that it was very important for us to establish the precedent,'' but added that few players would try what Yashin attempted. Why continue to seek damages from him? ''He caused damages to a franchise that is struggling with being competitive and viable in that market,'' Daly said.</p>
        <p>Referring to the booing Yashin is hearing, Daly said, ''It doesn't really surprise me.''</p>
        <p>Regarding league finances in general, Daly was asked if teams are making money. ''Yes, I think the league is doing very well,'' Daly said.</p>
        <p>Bob Goodenow, the executive director of the union, spoke with reluctance and said: ''This case is very complicated. Bottom line, it is a narrow ruling in a specific and unusual set of facts.'' Would it create a chilling effect? ''No,'' Goodenow said.</p>
        <p>Yashin, still convinced that his strategy was right, spoke candidly and freely. ''It was just an experience I had to go through,'' he said. ''It's part of life. I don't have any problems with my teammates or fans or other people. I'm very happy to be back. I'm trying to concentrate on hockey.''</p>
