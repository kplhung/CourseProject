        <p>Kagan Martos</p>
        <p>515 Broadway, near Spring Street</p>
        <p>SoHo</p>
        <p>Through Oct. 21</p>
        <p>As much as it is a style, Pop Art is for contemporary artists a tool for investigating and analyzing modern culture. Peter Gould, a young Pop-Conceptualist having his first solo exhibition in New York, focuses on the place of nature in our pervasively artificial world.</p>
        <p>In a series called ''Famous Restaurants,'' deadpan black-and-white photographs mounted on Formica panels document the landscaping around fast-food establishments like Burger King and Pizza Hut. These images of miniature parks with gravel paths, neatly groomed shrubbery and picnic tables speak to a longing for pastoral experience diametrically opposed to the industrialized consumption that the fast-food restaurant actually promotes.</p>
        <p>Extending his project wittily into sculpture, Mr. Gould presents two small, parklike installations in which grass is represented by green Formica and bushes by free-standing silhouettes cut from thin panels and painted shades of green. Stacked red bricks provide architectural framing. These cartoonlike abstractions of the modern corporate oasis -- itself an abstraction of the centuries-old dream of Eden -- are quietly funny and, because they tap into our romantic yearnings for oneness with nature, oddly touching.</p>
