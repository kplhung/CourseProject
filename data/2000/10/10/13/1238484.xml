        <p>The General Motors Corporation said yesterday that it had expanded its agency roster by naming Modernista in Boston to handle the account of the Hummer brand of wide-body vehicles. Billings were estimated at $20 million to $35 million.</p>
        <p>Marc Hernandez, brand manager in Detroit for Hummer, for which G.M. recently acquired the marketing rights, said the decision came after a three-month review that had been narrowed to Modernista and three agencies he declined to name.</p>
        <p>Advertising Age and Adweek listed the other contenders as the incumbent agency, Pyro Brand Development in Dallas, which took part with its parent, the Richards Group, also in Dallas, and two agencies owned by the Interpublic Group of Companies: the Martin Agency in Richmond, Va., part of the Lowe Group, and the Troy, Mich., office of McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising, part of the McCann-Erickson World Group.</p>
        <p>Lance Jensen, who opened Modernista in January, helped create the popular ''Drivers wanted'' campaign for Volkswagen of America when he worked at Arnold Communications in Boston.</p>
