        <p>Luhring Augustine</p>
        <p>531 West 24th Street, Chelsea</p>
        <p>Through tomorrow</p>
        <p>The large, murky color photographs of Jenny Gage's first solo show suggest that youthful and especially female malaise may be wearing thin as an artistic subject. Or nonchalant technique, narrative vagueness, unkempt beauty and ersatz settings redolent of hardscrabble isolation have become generic enough to be avoided.</p>
        <p>Her characters, photographed largely with the light behind them, loom up as mysterious silhouettes -- almost always alone, whether leaning against a car at the races, standing near a campfire, loping toward the sunset or staring blankly from a bed in a run-down trailer. Because the work is a series, titled ''Ventura,'' and the images are numerous and closely spaced, one is encouraged to eke out a story. Something along the lines of ''A Coal Miner's Daughter'' may come to mind or, more optimistically, a female road movie about escape to another life. In one image, when a young women walking along the edge of a highway turns toward the camera with a combination of anger and fear -- a welcome sign of spiritedness -- you may feel like  urging her to keep going.</p>
        <p>Ms. Gage may want to make points about both the psychological and economic plight of women, or about the inevitability of narrative. These days, almost any photograph can read as a film still. Either way, she rarely gives her characters the will or personality necessary to involve us, just as she rarely achieves enough formal distinctiveness to hold the attention. One comes away with a sense of moody, sepia-toned desolation and adolescent yearning  that could amount to something, but hasn't yet.</p>
