        <p>Investors stormed the stock market's exits yesterday on news that oil prices were surging, turmoil in the Middle East was escalating and earnings at a major Untied States retailer would be worse than expected.</p>
        <p>The selling took the Dow Jones industrial average down 379.21 points, or 3.6 percent, to 10,034.58, its lowest level since March. The Nasdaq composite index lost 93.81 points, or 3 percent, closing at 3,074.68, its lowest point for the year. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index fell 34.81 points, or 2.6 percent, to 1,329.78.</p>
        <p>All of the major stock indexes are deep in negative territory for the year. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index is down 9.5 percent so far while the Dow Jones industrials have lost 12.7 percent of their value. The Nasdaq is down 24.4 percent for the year.</p>
        <p>''The uncertainties have escalated,'' said Mary Farrell, senior investment strategist at PaineWebber. ''And we're seeing the bluest of the blue chips coming up with disappointments.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Farrell said she was struck by the speed with which disillusioned investors react these days. ''Investors today are more inclined to dump the stock and ask questions later,'' she said, observing only ''an element of panic'' in what was fairly orderly trading. Volume was heavy but trailed that of Wednesday when the Nasdaq and Big Board both posted their fourth-biggest days on record.</p>
        <p>The stock markets struggled almost from the beginning of the trading session. Early in the morning, Home Depot, one of the nation's most popular companies and beloved growth stocks, said that its results for the current quarter and the remainder of the year would be lower than expected. Home Depot's was only the last in a long line of similar warnings in recent weeks from former stock market stars like Lucent Technologies, Intel and Dell Computer. Home Depot's shares lost 28.7 percent of their value during the trading session.</p>
        <p>On both the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq, decliners outnumbered advancers by almost 3 to 1. On Nasdaq, only 18 companies reached new highs yesterday, while 511 Nasdaq companies hit new lows. On the New York exchange, 227 stocks made new lows, while 36 achieved new highs.</p>
        <p>Telecommunications stocks were hit hard -- Qualcomm was down 8.7 percent -- and Internet stocks fell once again. Yahoo fell 13.4 percent yesterday, hitting a 52-week low.</p>
        <p>Earlier this year, when stock prices were rising, investors seemed convinced that outsized corporate earnings growth of recent years would go on forever. But, some strategists say, the stock market's recent retreat reflects a forced rethinking of that view. Of the 135 companies in the S.&amp; P. 500 that have made third- quarter earnings announcements so far, 79 have had bad news to tell according to First Call/Thomson Financial. That is certainly higher than during the same period last year, when 44 companies out of 105 made  their confessions.</p>
        <p>''What frightens me a bit here is if people think that these companies won't grow at 40 percent a year forever, there could be a lot of disillusionment,'' said David Dreman, of Dreman Value Management in Jersey City. ''That's why I think the Nasdaq is still very vulnerable.''</p>
        <p>From its peak on March 10 of 5,048.62, the Nasdaq composite is now down 39 percent. The Dow Jones industrials, which topped out last January, has lost 14.4 percent of its value.</p>
        <p>Oil surged to $37 a barrel after an explosion at a United States Navy ship in Yemen and the killing of two Israeli soldiers by Palestinians ignited fears of an interruption in Middle East oil exports. Crude oil for November delivery closed at $36.06, up $2.81, or 8.45 percent. As oil rises, investors are growing increasingly concerned that it will create inflation and put the brakes on economies around the world, some of which are already in distress. Japan, for instance, which imports all of its oil, can ill afford another hit to its already flattened economy.</p>
        <p>Nervous investors fled to the safety of the United States Treasury markets, focusing their buying on securities with two-year and five-year maturities. Concerned about what an economic slowdown might do to companies carrying substantial debt, investors abandoned the riskier areas of the bond market -- junk bonds, in particular. Shares of bank stocks also fell as investors worried that the quality of the loans might deteriorate if the economy turns down.</p>
        <p>To some longtime traders, yesterday's news and market action looked and felt like 1973, when oil prices were rising and investors were beginning to realize that the handful of glamour companies trading at high valuations could not keep up their earnings growth. ''One by one -- Avon, Polaroid -- they took them out and shot them,'' one longtime broker recalled. ''Only when the economy went into recession and the Fed lowered interest rates did the market stabilize.''</p>
        <p>Others said that this year's fall was similar to those that took place in the autumn months of 1998 and 1999. In both cases, the market rallied sharply when investors perceived that their fears were overblown and both years produced big gains in many investors' stock portfolios.</p>
        <p>''Each year, the story line has been some type of shock leading to worries about profits and fears about inadequate liquidity in the credit markets,'' said Christine A. Callies, chief United States investment strategist at Merrill Lynch. ''In that respect, it sounds very much like the other corrections that looked equally bad at the time but that eventually burned themselves out. This one will, too, and will prove a very attractive entry point in equities for investors late this year and then in 2001.''</p>
        <p>But some strategists believe the upturn will not arrive before some final obstacles are overcome. For instance, Ned Riley Jr., chief strategist at State Street Global Advisers in Boston, said that investors had to believe that the Federal Reserve Board's next move would be to cut interest rates, a prospect not enhanced by soaring oil prices or September's 3.9 percent jobless rate, announced last week.</p>
        <p>James Paulsen, chief investment officer at Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis, said that the spotlight at the moment had fallen on stocks that were down significantly. But many stocks, particularly those that are considered value plays, are up on the year. ''As money runs out of technology stocks, it's fueling a revitalization in other areas such as health care companies, utilities and consumer stocks,'' he said. ''We have had a big chunk of liquidation in technology without destroying the rest of the market.''</p>

        <p>Treasury Prices Rise  By Bloomberg News</p>
        <p>Treasury prices rose yesterday as violence in the Middle East and falling stocks sent traders and investors to the security of United States government debt.</p>
        <p>The current two-year note saw its biggest gains in almost three months, rising 6/32, to 100 10/32. Its yield fell to an 11-month low of 5.83</p>
        <p>percent.</p>
        <p>The 10-year Treasury note rose 15/32, to a price of 100 10/32. The note's yield fell to 5.71 percent from 5.77 percent on Wednesday. The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 7/32, to 106 7/32. The bond's yield fell to 5.81 percent from 5.82 percent on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>''When international crises arise the normal response is a flight to quality,'' said Robert Alley, who oversees $4 billion in fixed-income securities at AIM Advisers Inc. in Houston. While his portfolios are concentrated with corporate debt, days like this ''make the Treasury market a better place to be,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Junk, or below-investment-grade, bonds have also taken a hit. The average junk security yielded 7.16 percentage points more than the 10-year Treasury note late yesterday, according to a Merrill Lynch index.</p>
