        <p>In what is apparently the largest gift from a gay benefactor to a campus project for gays and lesbians, two men who began living together as undergraduates at the University of Pennsylvania in the 1980's have donated $2 million for a new gay and lesbian student center at the university.</p>
        <p>The gift came from David Goodhand, a retired 37-year-old Microsoft software designer, and his partner, Vincent Griski, a 36-year-old former employee of Goldman Sachs and Microsoft who is now a stay-at-home father, raising the son the couple adopted two years ago.</p>

        <p>In what is apparently the largest gift from a gay benefactor to a campus project for gays and lesbians, two men who began living together as undergraduates at the University of Pennsylvania in the 1980's have donated $2 million for a new gay and lesbian student center at the university.</p>
        <p>The gift came from David Goodhand, a retired 37-year-old Microsoft software designer, and his partner, Vincent Griski, a 36-year-old former employee of Goldman Sachs and Microsoft who is now a stay-at-home father, raising the son the couple adopted two years ago.</p>
        <p>''It is gratifying to know that Penn provided the environment that enabled these men to live openly as gay individuals and in a loving relationship,'' the university president, Dr. Judith Rodin, said on Wednesday at a ceremony announcing the gift and observing National Coming Out Day, a Human Rights Campaign project that encourages gays to be open about their sexual orientation.</p>
        <p>The gift will be used to renovate the historic Carriage House, which will house the university's Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender Center. The university, with the help of the two men, is hoping to raise $5 million more to endow the center.</p>
        <p>While gay and lesbian alumni groups are proliferating nationwide, the gift to Penn is still far larger than any other made to gay and lesbian campus groups, said Katherine Pease, executive director of the Gill Foundation in Denver, which focuses on gay and lesbian issues.</p>
        <p>''Penn was already taking a leadership role on gay issues when we were there,'' said Mr. Goodhand, who, like his partner, graduated in 1985. ''They hired a student activity adviser for gay and lesbian students back in 1982, and started a small center for gay students, just in one little office. What we found, when we started reconnecting with our alma mater, was that there are now 10 different gay student groups. And they really wanted a place where they could meet, where the gay medical student group could get together with the gay law school group.''</p>
        <p>Like many of the other new Microsoft millionaires venturing into philanthropy, Mr. Goodhand and Mr. Griski have been involved far beyond financing. They did research to see what students wanted, did strategic planning for the center and hired the architect to draw up the first plans.</p>
        <p>Their campus involvement has been deepening for several years.  They have financed programs at the university's gay center, and endowed two scholarships, one specifically for a gay or lesbian student.</p>
        <p>The ease with which the philanthropic relationship has evolved is a striking contrast to the brouhaha three years ago when Larry Kramer, the AIDS activist and author, sought to endow a professorship in gay and lesbian studies at his alma mater, Yale University, only to be rebuffed by the provost, Alison Richard, who said that Yale's academic priorities must be set by the faculty and that visiting professors would best fill the university's needs for gay studies, at least temporarily.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Kramer's proposed gift grew out of his unhappy experiences in college -- he tried to commit suicide as a freshman in 1953, believing he was the only gay student on campus -- the Penn benefactors have fond memories of college.</p>
        <p>''We met sophomore year,'' Mr. Goodhand said. ''It was a very comfortable place for us to be gay. It's not so much that we had close contact with the adviser for gay students or anything, it was more that knowing Penn had made that kind of commitment was very powerful. So it's exciting, now, to be thinking about taking that kind of commitment to another level for the next generation of students, by building this center.''</p>
