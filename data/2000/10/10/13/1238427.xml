        <p>More than three-quarters of New York City's eighth graders failed to reach acceptable levels on a statewide mathematics test last spring, raising serious questions about whether they will be able to pass a newly required Regents math exam before they graduate from high school in 2004.</p>
        <p>The results of the annual New York State test released yesterday showed that eighth graders in other parts of the state fared better on the math test. Over all, 40 percent of the state's eighth graders met or exceeded state standards, compared with 38 percent in 1999.</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>More than three-quarters of New York City's eighth graders failed to reach acceptable levels on a statewide mathematics test last spring, raising serious questions about whether they will be able to pass a newly required Regents math exam before they graduate from high school in 2004.</p>
        <p>The results of the annual New York State test released yesterday showed that eighth graders in other parts of the state fared better on the math test. Over all, 40 percent of the state's eighth graders met or exceeded state standards, compared with 38 percent in 1999.</p>
        <p>But New York City's 23 percent passing rate was exactly the same as the previous year's, suggesting that city schools have made little if any progress toward meeting the state's rigorous new graduation standards.</p>
        <p>''The clock is running and there is a great urgency here,'' said Richard P. Mills, the state education commissioner, as he announced the results yesterday at an Albany news conference. ''Far too many students are not learning math right now, and if we concentrate on this, we can change the situation.''</p>
        <p>State education officials also released the results yesterday of a fourth-grade math test and an eighth-grade reading test. School officials considered those results more encouraging, because a greater percentage of students met the standards. But scores on both tests were slightly lower than they were in 1999. In reading, as in math, more than half of the state's eighth graders failed to meet state standards.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mills said middle schools ''need to rethink what they are doing'' and quickly figure out how to teach students the skills they need to meet the new standards. He said he had no intention of backing down on the standards, which as of last June required every high school student to pass an English Regents exam to graduate, and by next June will require every high school student to pass a Regents math exam as well.</p>
        <p>In the past, the Regents exams were optional, and only the most motivated students took them. But the State Board of Regents voted in 1996 to require all students to pass Regents exams in five subjects by 2004, with new tests being phased in every year from 2000 to 2004.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mills said yesterday that the Class of 2000 had performed better than he had expected on the English Regents exam, with most passing in time to graduate. But the results of the eighth-grade reading test released yesterday suggest that this year's freshmen will need to work doggedly to meet the new graduation requirements. Only 45 percent statewide met state standards on the reading test, down from 48 percent in 1999. In New York City, the passing rate was 33 percent, compared with 35 percent in 1999.</p>
        <p>Results of the fourth-grade reading test were released in June, and showed a gain of 11 percentage points statewide over 1999.</p>
        <p>Scores on the statewide tests are grouped into four levels. Students whose scores are in Levels 3 and 4 performed at or above the state standards for reading, writing and listening, while those in Levels 1 and 2 failed to meet the standards, or even worse, demonstrated no evidence of proficiency.</p>
        <p>Harold O. Levy, the New York City schools chancellor, released a brief statement yesterday saying he was disappointed with the test results. Last week, he announced that he had appointed a panel to study how math is taught in city classrooms and recommend changes by next spring. In particular, he wants the panel to ensure that ''there is alignment between what is taught and what is tested,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''Currently, what is taught is different from what the state standards require and what the fourth- and eighth-grade math exams test for,'' Mr. Levy said. ''In my own view, it is also different from the kinds of math that students need later in life.''</p>
        <p>Results from the statewide math test for fourth graders were more heartening, although they were worse than last year's: 65 percent of the state's fourth graders met standards on that test, compared with 67 percent in 1999. In New York City, the fourth-grade passing rate was 46 percent, down from 50 percent in 1999.</p>
        <p>One way to interpret the trend in math test results from fourth to eighth grades is that students seem to fall further behind in math as they advance from grade to grade. Another explanation experts offer is that many middle-class and affluent parents pull their children out of the public schools when they reach middle-school age. Still a third factor could be that many middle-school math teachers, especially in New York City, are not certified to teach the subject. Mr. Levy is trying to attract more qualified math teachers, but the effort will probably take years, in part because so few college math majors are becoming teachers these days.</p>
        <p>And while Mr. Levy's math panel is to report back to him with recommendations in a few months, it usually takes at least three years to integrate major changes into curriculums, said Anne Wheelock, an education researcher in Boston who has written extensively about middle schools.</p>
        <p>''Nobody wants to admit that changing high-need schools takes very focused effort and a lot of time,'' Ms. Wheelock said. ''It doesn't just happen with a set of carrots and sticks and grandiose rhetoric about how we're setting the bar higher.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Wheelock said research suggests that when states introduce high-stakes tests, they do not automatically lead to improvements in what is taught. The schools that ''respond most readily to the pressure'' typically have a low teacher turnover rate, a high number of teachers certified in their subject area and ongoing teacher training, she said.</p>
        <p>Board of Education officials in New York City pointed out yesterday that the city's 40 lowest-performing schools adopted a new mathematics curriculum in the fall of 1999 that includes intensive, ongoing training for teachers. But they said it was too soon to tell whether the new curriculum would boost test scores.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Mills acknowledged yesterday that middle-school curriculums were weak, he said the state had made ''tremendous efforts'' to ensure that fourth and eighth graders passed the new tests. ''We have put in place standards, published curriculum guides, offered professional development, fought for and won more resources,'' he said. ''It's clear that we have worked on this.''</p>
        <p>The class of 2001 will get something of a reprieve on the Regents math exam, because the state lowered the passing grade to 55 from 65 for the first few years that the test is a graduation requirement. The passing grade is supposed to return to 65 in 2005. But Mr. Levy, clearly worried that many students will not be able to score a 65 by then, is considering lobbying the state to keep the passing grade at 55 indefinitely.</p>
        <p>''I am looking to the math commission to advise me on what is realistic,'' he said yesterday.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Mills said he was reluctant to keep the passing score at 55 beyond 2005.</p>
        <p>''If I were to lower the standard out of fear, what kind of message would I be sending?'' he said. ''It would be a big mistake to sell the kids short.''</p>
