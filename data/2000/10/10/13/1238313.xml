        <p>* ''ALMOST FAMOUS,'' starring Patrick Fugit, Billy Crudup, Kate Hudson and Philip Seymour Hoffman. Written and directed by Cameron Crowe (R, 120 minutes). Mr. Crowe's loose, affectionate look back on his earlier career as a teenage rock journalist overflows with wonderful performances and memorable moments. Mr. Fugit brings the perfect balance of intelligence and innocence to the role of William Miller, a San Diego teenager who takes to the road with a scruffy band called Stillwater, on assignment for Rolling Stone. ''Almost Famous'' isn't perfect -- it lacks a necessary dimension of demonic sleaze -- but Mr. Crowe's smart, compassionate writing and performances by Mr. Crudup, Ms. Hudson, Jason Lee and Frances McDormand (among many others) make it hum (A. O. Scott).</p>

        <p>* ''ALMOST FAMOUS,'' starring Patrick Fugit, Billy Crudup, Kate Hudson and Philip Seymour Hoffman. Written and directed by Cameron Crowe (R, 120 minutes). Mr. Crowe's loose, affectionate look back on his earlier career as a teenage rock journalist overflows with wonderful performances and memorable moments. Mr. Fugit brings the perfect balance of intelligence and innocence to the role of William Miller, a San Diego teenager who takes to the road with a scruffy band called Stillwater, on assignment for Rolling Stone. ''Almost Famous'' isn't perfect -- it lacks a necessary dimension of demonic sleaze -- but Mr. Crowe's smart, compassionate writing and performances by Mr. Crudup, Ms. Hudson, Jason Lee and Frances McDormand (among many others) make it hum (A. O. Scott).</p>
        <p>* ''BAMBOOZLED,'' starring Damon Wayans, Savion Glover and Jada Pinkett-Smith. Written and directed by Spike Lee (R, 135 minutes). Mr. Lee's answer to ''Network'' is a scaldingly funny satire of the television industry in which a failing network hits the ratings jackpot with an old-time black minstrel show that resurrects offensive stereotypes. Accepted as hip, ironic and liberating by mainstream audiences but reviled by black militants, it starts a national craze for wearing blackface. If this messy cinematic collage goes every which way, its anger at a television industry that largely excludes blacks and whose black programming (in the director's view) perpetuates minstrelsy is right on target. Mr. Wayans plays the black Harvard-educated executive who dreams up this Frankenstein monster of a show (Stephen Holden).</p>
        <p>* ''BEST IN SHOW,'' starring Christopher Guest, John Michael Higgins, Eugene Levy, Michael McKean, Catherine O'Hara and Parker Posey. Directed by Mr. Guest (PG-13, 89 minutes). In the mold of Mr. Guest's earlier cult favorites, ''This Is Spinal Tap'' and ''Waiting for Guffman,'' this semi-deadpan satire spoofs the world of dog shows. A cross section of American eccentrics gather with their prized pets at a Philadelphia competition. The humor in this largely improvised film is barbed and condescending but rarely vicious. Like most skit comedy, the whole is somewhat less than the sum of its parts. Great fun, nonetheless (Holden).</p>
        <p>''BRING IT ON,'' starring Kirsten Dunst, Jesse Bradford and Eliza Dushku. Directed by Peyton Reed (PG-13, 110 minutes). Even though it does feature young women bouncing around in skimpy outfits, this cheerleader comedy, directed with giddy, sometimes sloppy pep-rally intensity by Mr. Reed from a brisk, slangy script by Jessica Bendinger, is more than a low-minded appeal to male lechery. Though bound by the conventions of the sports movie and the teenage romantic comedy, ''Bring It On'' has a fine satirical edge and at least glances at some serious issues of race and sexuality. It's also a vehicle for the vibrant comic talents of Ms. Dunst, ably supported by Mr. Bradford as her cute, nonconformist love interest and Ms. Dushku as his sister (Scott).</p>
        <p>''DANCER IN THE DARK,'' starring Bjork and Catherine Deneuve. Directed by Lars von Trier (R, 134 minutes). Mr. von Trier's new musical, shot in raw, jumpy digital video, is a fascinating exercise in brutality, mitigated by the otherworldly charisma (and the music) of the Icelandic pop star Bjork. As Selma, a Czech immigrant factory worker going blind in the early 1960's in Washington State (the film was shot in Sweden), Bjork seems to be inventing a whole new style of film acting, and her performance is miraculous. Mr. von Trier, continuing his campaign to rescue the art of film from complacency and convention, follows Selma's utter annihilation with sadistic relish. ''Dancer in the Dark'' is both stupefyingly bad and utterly overpowering; it can elicit, sometimes within a single scene, a gasp of rapture and a spasm of revulsion. Go to the theater prepared, with a handkerchief in one hand and a rotten tomato in the other (Scott).</p>
        <p>* ''GIRLFIGHT,'' starring Michelle Rodriguez, Jaime Tirelli and Paul Caldron. Directed by Karen Kusama (R, 90 minutes). Ms. Kusama's debut feature is a fierce, sweet, somewhat predictable boxing picture, with a novel twist that makes all the difference: the contender is a young woman. What makes the movie something more than a smart, feminist sports movie (which is already something) is the presence of Ms. Rodriguez in the leading role, an angry Brooklyn teenager named Diana Guzman who finds dignity and discipline in the ring. Ms. Rodriguez is like a female Marlon Brando, with an overpowering, slow-burning charisma that few actresses of any era can match. Her performance is a knockout (Scott).</p>
        <p>''GOYA IN BORDEAUX,'' starring Francisco Rabal, Jose Coronado, Dafne Fernandez and Maribel Verdu. Written and directed by Carlos Saura (R, 94 minutes). There's nothing subtle about Mr. Saura's splashy, sensuous biographical montage of the great Spanish artist Francisco Goya, whom the movie portrays as an 18th-century raging bull. Crammed with surreal imagery that quotes from his paintings, the movie is a series of deathbed flashbacks, many of them recollections of his passion for the fiery Duchess of Alba. Gorgeously lighted and photographed by Vittorio Storaro (Holden).</p>
        <p>''MEET THE PARENTS,'' starring Robert De Niro and Ben Stiller. Directed by Jay Roach (PG-13, 105 minutes). Mr. De Niro's scowl has become the kind of cultural shorthand that generally presages entry into the Smithsonian, where it can lie in state next to the Fonz's jacket, Archie Bunker's chair and Cher's hair. He uses it in this likable paranoid comedy, where he plays every guy's worst nightmare: the father of his girlfriend. Mr. Stiller is the nervous, eager-to-please boyfriend, and the story plays out in a rustic suburban scenario that's too quiet: Martha Stewart's ''Night of the Living Dead'' (Elvis Mitchell).</p>
        <p>* ''NURSE BETTY,'' starring Morgan Freeman, Renee Zellweger, Chris Rock and Greg Kinnear. Directed by Neil LaBute (R, 112 minutes). Hilarious, poignant and gory, this modern fairy tale, which follows an aspiring nurse (Ms. Zellweger) with traumatic amnesia to Los Angeles to win the love of her favorite soap-opera character, is a contemporary ''Wizard of Oz.'' Hollywood is the Emerald City. Mr. Kinnear is the self-centered actor who plays her heart's desire on television. Mr. Freeman and Mr. Rock are a sadly introspective hit man and his hotheaded protege who follow her across the country with the intention of doing harm. This may be the deepest and funniest American comedy since David O. Russell's ''Flirting With Disaster'' (Holden).</p>
        <p>''REMEMBER THE TITANS,'' starring Denzel Washington, Will Patton, Donald Faison and Ryan Hurst. Directed by Boaz Yakin (PG, 113 minutes). Like the action blockbusters its producer, Jerry Bruckheimer, is best known for, this story of a Virginia high school football team's painful, ultimately triumphant struggle to integrate is a relentless, pounding succession of big moments. Mr. Washington and Mr. Patton play two coaches who must overcome their own differences to build a winning team, and their passage from hostility to respect to friendship is mirrored by the young men who play for them. The film, which takes place in 1971 and is based on a true story, is at times thumpingly corny, but it also offers some genuine, solid inspiration (Scott).</p>
        <p>* ''REQUIEM FOR A DREAM,'' starring Jared Leto, Ellen Burstyn, Jennifer Connelly and Marlon Wayans. Directed by Darren Aronofsky (not rated, 102 minutes). Mr. Aronofsky's adaptation of the Hubert Selby Jr. novel is both a knockout and a downer. ''Requiem'' looks at the lives of four addicts (played by Mr. Leto, Ms. Burstyn, Ms. Connelly and Mr. Wayans) connected to each other by the bonds of love, friendship and family; it also emphasizes the fact that the rituals of consumption are as important as the addiction. The tumble of imagery is powerful, almost overwhelming, and totally under the director's control, and though the material is bleak, ''Requiem'' offers the compensating high from an instinctive filmmaker (Mitchell).</p>
        <p>* ''SOLAS,'' starring Maria Galiana and Ana Fernandez. Written and directed by Benito Zambrano (not rated, 98 minutes). When a simple Spanish woman (Ms. Galiana) makes a rare journey to the city to be with her husband, who is having surgery, she stays with her embittered, alcoholic daughter (Ms. Fernandez), who works for a cleaning service. Ms. Galiana's eloquent, utterly unsentimental portrayal of a woman who expects little of life is an extraordinarily moving portrait of unconditional love gradually working its wonders (Holden).</p>
        <p>* ''SPACE COWBOYS,'' starring Clint Eastwood, Tommy Lee Jones, Donald Sutherland and James Garner. Directed by Mr. Eastwood (PG-13, 105 minutes). The second half of Mr. Eastwood's new movie is a pleasant reworking of the standard trouble-in-space movie, with Mr. Eastwood leading a heroic team of astronauts that also include Mr. Jones, Mr. Sutherland and Mr. Garner. But the first half, which consists of the comic tough-old-guy interplay among these four sublime actors, is a boisterous, easygoing tribute to manhood and maturity. Mr. Sutherland and Mr. Jones are in especially fine form, as are Marcia Gay Harden, playing a NASA engineer, and James Cromwell as (once again) the villainous bureaucrat who tries to deny the old-timers their shot at celestial glory (Scott).</p>
        <p>''TIGERLAND,'' starring Colin Farrell. Directed by Joel Schumacher (R, 110 minutes). Shot in gritty, handheld 16 millimeter, Mr. Schumacher's film about a group of Vietnam-bound G.I.'s in 1971 Louisiana looks raw and real. But beneath the rough visual surface and the pungent profanity of the script lurks a hokey, phony melodrama that might briefly have seemed fresh and relevant 30 years ago. Mr. Farrell, the young Irish actor who plays an alienated rebel named Bozz, brings a winning bad-boy energy to his part, but his talent, and the talented supporting cast, can't save the movie from drowning in the shallows of Mr. Schumacher's imagination (Scott).</p>
        <p>''THE WATCHER,'' starring Keanu Reeves, James Spader and Marisa Tomei. Directed by Joe Charbanic (R, 93 minutes). Mr. Reeves enunciates, Mr. Spader frets and Ms. Tomei just looks tired in this pretentious, incoherent compilation of serial-killer cliches and warmed-over MTV-style visual flourishes. Mr. Reeves is a sadistic, diabolically intelligent strangler, Mr. Spader the F.B.I. agent whose psychic torment is the killer's real turn-on and Ms. Tomei the agent's kindly therapist (Scott).</p>
        <p>''WOMAN ON TOP,'' starring Penelope Cruz, Murilo Benicio and Harold Perrineau Jr. Directed by Fina Torres (R, 85 minutes). It makes sense that the delectable Ms. Cruz would play a chef. This romantic comedy uses an amusing conceit, that she needs a magic spell to so enchant men that they won't bother to look down at their plates -- a case in which magic is as redundant as giving the lethal boxer Roy Jones Jr. a third fist. Ms. Cruz flees Brazil and her philandering husband to go to San Francisco. There, she becomes the host of a cooking show, where she delights the local male population and sambas waft in the background. Negligible but diverting (Mitchell).</p>
        <p>* ''YI YI (A ONE AND A TWO),'' starring Wu Nienjen. Directed by Edward Yang (not rated, 173 minutes). This nearly three-hour chronicle of the daily life and domestic turmoil of a middle-class Taipei family is so full of humor, life and delicate feeling that you may wish it were longer. Mr. Yang directs with classical precision and a relaxed, generous approach to storytelling. Wu Nienjen plays NJ Jian, a businessman whose midlife crisis is just one of a half-dozen stories that wind through this lovely film, which seems, in its unassuming, observant way, to cover the whole spectrum of human experience (Scott).</p>
