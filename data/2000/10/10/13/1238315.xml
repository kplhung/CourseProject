        <p>Any museum would rejoice in having a donor like Cyril I. Nelson in the wings, and the Museum of American Folk Art is rejoicing. Interested in art and antiques since his New England childhood, Mr. Nelson, a book editor in the decorative arts field, has given the museum no fewer than 113 objects dating from the late 18th to the mid-20th century and promised many additional works in anticipation of the museum's new building on West 53rd Street.</p>
        <p>His collection covers the traditional areas of folk art -- portraits, landscapes, sculpture, painted and decorated furniture, mourning pictures and the like -- but he has made a particular specialty of American needlework: quilts, coverlets and blankets. A substantial part of his gift has been in this field.</p>
        <p>What's more, as an editor for more than 50 years at E. P. Dutton (now Penguin Putnam Inc.) he has published a number of works on American antiques, decorative arts and folk art, joining with the museum to produce books on subjects ranging from samplers to sculpture. Quilt buffs know him as the founder and compiler of an annual big seller, the Quilt Engagement Calendar, published since 1975.</p>
        <p>In celebration of Mr. Nelson's largess, the museum has mounted ''An Engagement With Folk Art: Cyril I. Nelson's Gifts to the Museum of American Folk Art,'' a display of his donations along with a few given by others in his honor.</p>
        <p>The show leans heavily toward needlework, of course; besides a wide-ranging representation of quilts, there are double cloth and double-weave coverlets, twill and plain-weave blankets, a candlewick bedspread and such.</p>
        <p>But there are lots of other categories, too, from paintings to painted chests. What's on view represents a refined, solid collection with a few things that break through to the semispectacular.</p>
        <p>One is an exuberant extravaganza known as the ''Samuel Steinberger Log Cabin Quilt, Courthouse Steps Variation,'' thought to have been made by an immigrant from Hungary who came to New York City in 1884 and earned his living as a tailor. A densely packed field of small geometric figures in peach, orange, red, blue, yellows and more subtle hues, it rings changes in color and fabric that distinguish it from the usual regularity of quilts made in the popular Log Cabin pattern.</p>
        <p>Another is a solid color quilt of deep blue-black, probably made in New England from 1800 to 1820, of a material called calimanco, an imported worsted fabric with a shiny surface. Sternly monochromatic, it has a chic but funereal presence that would go well in a house designed by Charles Addams.</p>
        <p>A fine needlework specimen of a different breed is the ''Pot of Flowers Hooked Rug'' (1885-1900). Of wool sewn onto burlap, its main motif is a big flowerpot whose pink-leaved plant is surrounded on a darker field by a ring of stylized blossoms. And certainly not to be overlooked is the cozy-looking bed rug, dated 1803, whose ''Tree of Life'' pattern is sumptuously worked in blue and gold.</p>
        <p>Painted furniture shines, too, in this show, particularly a wonderful two-drawer blanket chest, probably made in Massachusetts between 1825 and 1835, and decorated in a far from timorous abstract pattern of spots and lines laid on with the aid of sponges and crinkled paper. It was given by the folk art collector and writer Jean Lipman, a specialist in painted furniture, in honor of Mr. Nelson.</p>
        <p>Another blanket repository, this one a chest-on-chest, has a more stylish and decorous presence. Made of pine, it is painted in black on rust to imitate wood grain, with decorative areas of burling on the top chest. Unusually, the top chest can lift off to stand alone.</p>
        <p>And there are several beautifully painted small wooden boxes, among them a document container with lively stylized decorations in green and white that suggest the patterning of painted tinware.</p>
        <p>Paintings and sculptures here make a far more modest impression. A strong, assertive portrait by Erastus Salisbury Field (1805-1900) depicts a gussied-up miller wearing a black bow tie and what we might today call a blow-dried hairdo. And there's a quaint charm to ''Mother and Daughter of the Chase Family'' (circa 1831), a small, stiff watercolor of a grim-looking mother and her child, painted full-length and in profile by a little-known artist named J. Evans. Its importance to the museum is that it's an ancestral relic from Mr. Nelson's own family of Deerfield, N.H.</p>
        <p>Several land and riverscapes, a mourning picture and a fine stylized urn of flowers (1848) made of shiny cut paper as a memorial tribute to one Benjamin S. Farret, round out the paintings in the show.</p>
        <p>In the sculpture category is a portrait in profile of Abraham Lincoln and George Washington. Carved in bas-relief around 1930 by a Midwesterner, Stephen L. Iwasko, it impresses with its stylized but precise detailing and the smug expressions on the faces of the two national heroes.</p>
        <p>The only other sculpture is a rather mundane carved wooden dove from the late 19th century that once topped the ridge pole of a Kansas granary. It's obvious that Mr. Nelson's heart belongs to needlework, but seen altogether, the show makes a very visitable ensemble.</p>
        <p>''An Engagement With Folk Art: Cyril I. Nelson's Gifts to the Museum of American Folk Art'' is on view at the museum, 2 Lincoln Square, at West 66th Street, Manhattan, (212) 595-9533, through Jan. 7.</p>
