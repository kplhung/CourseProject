        <p>Juniper Networks announced quarterly earnings that blew past Wall Street's expectations yesterday, as analysts said the company continued to whittle away at Cisco Systems' dominance of the Internet-switching technology market. Juniper reported net income of $58.1 million, or 17 cents a share, nearly double the 9 cents analysts had predicted. The company lost $1.59 million, or 1 cent a share, a year earlier. Sales were $201.2 million, up 78 percent from the prior quarter. Analysts had predicted revenue of about $147 million. Sales were $29.6 million for the period a year earlier. Christin Armacost, an analyst with SG Cowen, said the results exceeded even Wall Street's highest ''whisper'' numbers. Juniper said it now expected annual revenue of $625 million to $640 million, up from an earlier prediction of $520 million. Its shares had dropped $6.41, to $199.59, before the earnings release, which came after markets closed. After hours, the shares rose $3.26, to $202.87.</p>
