      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>For what it is, a 90-minute spinoff of a ''Saturday Night Live'' sketch, Reginald Hudlin's film ''The Ladies Man'' is not bad. If you have some familiarity with recent examples of this benighted genre -- like ''Stuart Saves His Family,'' ''It's Pat,'' ''A Night at the Roxbury'' or ''Superstar'' -- you will take this evaluation as a giddy rave. ''The Ladies Man'' has some funny, dirty-minded jokes, a few amusing cameos (including Julianne Moore in clown makeup) and a soundtrack loaded with juicy cuts of mid-70's vintage soul and funk: a lot of Gamble and Huff, a soupcon of Isley Brothers and a plateful of Parliament's ''Up for the Down Stroke.''</p>
        <p>Mostly it has Tim Meadows as Leon Phelps, a pint-size Don Juan with a foot-high Afro, a heavy lisp and a taste for the finer things in life: Courvoisier, scented candles, water beds and a special product called ''Pina Colada Butt Lotion.'' All these are, needless to say, the accouterments of his vocation, which is, as it were, getting freaky with the ladies, who find him irresistible.</p>

        <p>For what it is, a 90-minute spinoff of a ''Saturday Night Live'' sketch, Reginald Hudlin's film ''The Ladies Man'' is not bad. If you have some familiarity with recent examples of this benighted genre -- like ''Stuart Saves His Family,'' ''It's Pat,'' ''A Night at the Roxbury'' or ''Superstar'' -- you will take this evaluation as a giddy rave. ''The Ladies Man'' has some funny, dirty-minded jokes, a few amusing cameos (including Julianne Moore in clown makeup) and a soundtrack loaded with juicy cuts of mid-70's vintage soul and funk: a lot of Gamble and Huff, a soupcon of Isley Brothers and a plateful of Parliament's ''Up for the Down Stroke.''</p>
        <p>Mostly it has Tim Meadows as Leon Phelps, a pint-size Don Juan with a foot-high Afro, a heavy lisp and a taste for the finer things in life: Courvoisier, scented candles, water beds and a special product called ''Pina Colada Butt Lotion.'' All these are, needless to say, the accouterments of his vocation, which is, as it were, getting freaky with the ladies, who find him irresistible.</p>
        <p>Even though Leon's wardrobe and attitudes seem stuck in the 70's, he lives in present-day Chicago on a yacht called the ''Skank-tuary.'' An early flashback sequence, narrated by Billy Dee Williams, a ladies man of the old school, explains that Leon, a foundling, was raised, like Moses in Pharaoh's court, by a certain pipe-smoking swinger with a mansion in Chicago, from which he was evicted after getting freaky with the wrong lady. He now makes his living as a late-night radio talk show host, dispensing advice to the lonely and the lovelorn. ''How do I know when I'm in love?'' a caller asks. ''You feel it deep down in your pants,'' he explains. Unless, he adds, you aren't wearing any.</p>
        <p>And Leon, whose taste in pants runs to patterned hip-huggers accompanied by matching (that is, wildly clashing) ensembles of boots, navel-exposing polyester shirts and wide-lapel sport coats, is happiest wearing nothing at all. This gets him into trouble with a gang of cuckolded husbands, who know him only by the ''Have a Nice Day'' smiley-face tattoo on his rear end.</p>
        <p>One of the movie's plots traces their pursuit of him (which breaks for a show-stopping musical number); the other is a standard bit of romantic comedy business involving the unspoken love between Leon and his loyal, long-suffering producer, Julie, good-humoredly played by Karyn Parsons, formerly of ''Fresh Prince of Bel Air.'' The supporting cast, including Mr. Meadows's ''Saturday Night Live'' colleague Will Ferrell as the leader of the posse of wronged husbands and John Witherspoon as a barfly named Scrap Iron, have some good moments.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hudlin, directing from a rambling, gag-driven script by Mr. Meadows, Dennis McNicholas and Andrew Steele, keeps the story moving, pausing over some fine set pieces, like a soul-food eating contest between Leon and Julie's uptight ex-fiance (Rocky Carroll) that progresses from pickled pigs' feet through delicacies whose names cannot be printed here to something called ''gristle lumps.''</p>
        <p>It may cross your mind that this is a movie about a black man pursued by a mob of whites intent on castrating him for improper attention to ''their women.'' But Mr. Hudlin is not Spike Lee, and he smothers the potentially volatile political and sexual subtext of the movie in genial silliness.</p>
        <p>As it ambles toward its conclusion, and the plot takes precedence over the gags, ''The Ladies Man'' wears thin, as this kind of picture inevitably does. A sketch character is an embodied joke who never changes and requires no inner life or complex motivation. But the lead character in a feature film, by the iron law of Hollywood convention, has to undergo a transformation, has to grow and has to end up as a person with whom the audience can identify. So by the end of the movie Leon Phelps is no longer a freak with the ladies but just a nice guy with a speech impediment and curious taste in clothes.</p>
        <p>''The Ladies Man'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes many references to, and a few scenes of, getting freaky with the ladies.</p>
