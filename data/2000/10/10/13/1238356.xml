        <p>Jets quarterback Vinny Testaverde appears to have recovered enough from the pinched nerve that knocked him out of last week's game to start Sunday against New England.</p>
        <p>Testaverde had his normal starter's workload in Wednesday's practice -- which Coach Al Groh said went nicely -- and had no lingering physical aftereffects. He expected to go through a full practice today, too, which means he will probably take about 80 percent of the snaps.</p>

        <p>Jets quarterback Vinny Testaverde appears to have recovered enough from the pinched nerve that knocked him out of last week's game to start Sunday against New England.</p>
        <p>Testaverde had his normal starter's workload in Wednesday's practice -- which Coach Al Groh said went nicely -- and had no lingering physical aftereffects. He expected to go through a full practice today, too, which means he will probably take about 80 percent of the snaps.</p>
        <p>Testaverde, who is still experiencing some numbness in his left arm and hand, said he has none of the pain in his neck or behind his left shoulder that prevented him from turning his head and putting zip on his passes. That pain could return, though, if Testaverde takes another perfectly placed hit -- like the one he sustained against Pittsburgh.</p>
        <p>He also said that getting hit repeatedly is what caused the diminished velocity in earlier games. But when asked if he would start, Testaverde responded, ''I would think so.''</p>
        <p>Groh stopped short of saying Testaverde is his starter, indicating that, barring a setback, he was leaning toward starting him. Center Kevin Mawae said that, as far as he knew, Testaverde would start.</p>
        <p>''He's our starter and we want him to remain so,'' Groh said. ''There are lots of people who play football with stingers and they hurt on a repeated basis. But they don't hurt with every hit. It's an easy decision. If Vinny says he feels he can play well, that will help me make my decision.''</p>
        <p>Testaverde said later that he felt confident that he could play well and finish the game.</p>
        <p>Groh said he would not hold Testaverde out just to give him extra rest to save him for later in the season.</p>
        <p>''This is a now league,'' Groh said. ''You've got to win each one when you have a chance to win them.''</p>
        <p>Testaverde conceded that he felt better going into last week's game than he does now, but he added, ''That's not to say I don't feel good now.''</p>
        <p>Ray Lucas, Testaverde's backup, said he expected to get more repetitions in today's practice. Should he be thrust into action, he said, he needs to change little from what he did in last week's dismal performance against Pittsburgh -- except his behavior.</p>
        <p>''The only things I have to change are my emotions,'' Lucas said. ''Last year, I was a guy who was cool, calm and collected in the eye of the storm. I'm working hard this week to be that guy.''</p>
        <p>It was in the Jets' first meeting with New England that Testaverde first sustained the injury, in the fourth quarter of the Jets' comeback victory. One play before Testaverde completed a 2-yard touchdown pass to Wayne Chrebet that began the comeback, defensive end Willie McGinest came free on a blitz and, as Testaverde turned to his left to throw a pass, hit him in the right ear hole of his helmet.</p>
        <p>Testaverde felt nothing during the game but had spasms and soreness for the next few days, leading up to the game against Buffalo.</p>
        <p>Testaverde has grown weary this week of answering questions about his injury and of reading that perhaps, as he nears age 37, his body is beginning to break down. He grinned when asked if, among the reasons he wants to start this week, is a desire to quiet his doubters.</p>
        <p>''I hate opening the paper every morning and reading about an injury of mine,'' Testaverde said. ''It seems everybody wants to talk about my age. Maybe I'm stubborn, but I don't want to admit this has anything to do with my age. This is part of playing in the N.F.L, the risks of the job. Nothing that a win wouldn't help.''</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>Apparently, 15 is not enough on the Jets' voluminous injury report. They added nose tackle ERNIE LOGAN (calf) on Thursday, listing him as probable. ''I'm trying to negate any insinuation that by not reporting every player who gets normal treatment we're impugning the integrity of the league or marginalizing the competition on the field,'' Coach AL GROH said, explaining the Jets' list. Not appearing on the list is Groh, who strained his left elbow lifting weights and wore a wrap on it today. ''I'm a little slow to go to my whistle,'' he said.</p>
