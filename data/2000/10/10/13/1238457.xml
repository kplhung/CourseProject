        <p>I watched both debates. Yes, this time, Al Gore did not sigh or roll his eyes. Yes, George W. Bush knew a few names of world leaders and could pronounce them. But did he know one more name besides those he memorized and articulated? I doubt it.</p>

        <p>Re ''Candidates Meet in Restrained Debate'' (front page, Oct. 12):</p>
        <p>I watched both debates. Yes, this time, Al Gore did not sigh or roll his eyes. Yes, George W. Bush knew a few names of world leaders and could pronounce them. But did he know one more name besides those he memorized and articulated? I doubt it.</p>
        <p>A suggestion: Why not have an unscheduled debate? Locate the two opponents, get them on planes without their coaches, fly them to an undisclosed spot and sit them both down at a table before the cameras and ask them to have a pleasant (or nasty, whatever suits you) conversation. We might learn something from these two carefully programmed candidates.</p>
        <p>There was nothing new on Wednesday night except the results of hours upon hours of coaching.</p>
