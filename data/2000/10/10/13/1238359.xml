        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Peru is still dealing with the consequences of the relationship between the C.I.A. and Peru's former spymaster, Vladimiro Montesinos (Week in Review, Oct. 8). The network for corruption and intimidation that Mr. Montesinos created to serve himself and President Alberto K. Fujimori's regime is still in place.</p>
        <p>In the last elections, the Clinton administration appeared to support democracy in Peru. Now we realize that Mr. Montesinos's power extended as far as Washington. In the aftermath of Mr. Montesinos's fall, Mr. Fujimori was rescued from disgrace by Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright's recognition of him as a reliable conductor of a return to democracy in Peru.</p>

        <p>I deplore the misuse by irresponsible policy makers of United States influence in a country with a genuine desire for democracy.</p>
