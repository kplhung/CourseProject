        <p>After a recent midday rehearsal for the new Metropolitan Opera production of Beethoven's ''Fidelio,'' which opens tonight, the glamorous soprano Karita Mattila, dressed in casual slacks and sneakers, came bounding into the company's press room for an interview, beaming with the hearty, dimpled bloom of the Finnish farm girl she once was. In her shoulder bag she carried the opera's score along with apples, raw carrots and a bottle of spring water to keep her going on a busy day. Even in her soprano-at-work mode Ms. Mattila, who recently turned 40, looked stunning.</p>

        <p>After a recent midday rehearsal for the new Metropolitan Opera production of Beethoven's ''Fidelio,'' which opens tonight, the glamorous soprano Karita Mattila, dressed in casual slacks and sneakers, came bounding into the company's press room for an interview, beaming with the hearty, dimpled bloom of the Finnish farm girl she once was. In her shoulder bag she carried the opera's score along with apples, raw carrots and a bottle of spring water to keep her going on a busy day. Even in her soprano-at-work mode Ms. Mattila, who recently turned 40, looked stunning.</p>
        <p>But what had happened to her long blond hair?</p>
        <p>It was gone, cropped short by a Met hairdresser so Ms. Mattila could portray Beethoven's Leonore, the wife of a liberal-minded nobleman in late-18th-century Spain who has been imprisoned for vaguely specified reasons by a repressive local governor. To rescue her husband, Florestan, who will be sung by the tenor Ben Heppner, Leonore has disguised herself as a young man, Fidelio, and gone to work at the prison where Florestan is being held in a subterranean cell.</p>
        <p>Excited by the production concept of Jurgen Flimm, who is making his Met debut with ''Fidelio,'' Ms. Mattila threw herself into the role with her customary fervor. Hence the haircut. ''They are cutting my hair even more this afternoon, and coloring it dark,'' she said. ''And they are making me completely flat-chested.</p>
        <p>''I may not look beautiful, but I look so right. It's wonderful. That's what we try for.''</p>
        <p>When she made her Met debut in 1990 as Donna Elvira in Mozart's ''Don Giovanni,'' few opera buffs would have predicted that Ms. Mattila would someday sing Leonore, typically the province of dramatic sopranos who live on Wagner and Strauss. At the time, it seemed that a splendid lyric soprano with an unusually resonant voice had arrived.</p>
        <p>But just five years later Ms. Mattila (who pronounces her name kah-REE-tah MATT-ee-lah) triumphed at the Salzburg Festival in the vocally weighty role of Chrysothemis in Strauss's ''Elektra.'' She had been nervous about taking up the challenge, but during rehearsals, encouraged by the conductor, Claudio Abbado, and the director, Lev Dodin, she discovered a whole new dramatic dimension to her voice: a gleaming, unforced sound that could slice through Strauss's thick orchestra but retain its lyric hues and elegance. Last season at the Met she was a vocally luminous Elsa in Wagner's ''Lohengrin.''</p>
        <p>Dramatic soprano voices tend to come in big bodies. Ms. Mattila has the figure and charisma of a movie star. And as an actress she is willing to make all manner of physical and emotional demands on herself.</p>
        <p>But admirable as it is, the willingness to take dramatic risks has gotten Ms. Mattila into situations she regrets, like the new production by Hans Neuenfels of Mozart's ''Cosi Fan Tutte'' at the Salzburg Festival this summer. The opera tells the story of two cocksure young men who test the faithfulness of their fiancees.</p>
        <p>This updated production cluttered the stage with bizarre props, including monster-size insects, and distracted attention from the singers with background videos, some of them erotic. When Ms. Mattila sang Fiordiligi's fiery aria, ''Come Scoglio,'' in which she declares her constancy to be as unassailable as a fortress, she arrived onstage walking two men like dogs on leashes, both scantily clad in leather and chains, crawling on all fours. What was the point? There was none, Ms. Mattila said.</p>
        <p>''It was one of the worst experiences I've had for a long time,'' she said. ''I didn't believe in the production. Nobody understood what they were doing or why. I've done many crazy things, but there is also a line one cannot cross.''</p>
        <p>That production was especially unfortunate because Ms. Mattila had decided beforehand to retire this role, and she wanted her final performances to be meaningful. Such is the quandary of singers today who work hard to form interpretive ideas and then have no choice but to comply with a director's concept, however offensive.</p>
        <p>''I was so depressed,'' she said. ''I felt like a beaten dog after every performance.'' She was also deeply unhappy with the conductor, Lothar Zagrosek. She said the whole experience left her disappointed with Gerard Mortier, the festival's artistic director, who has made it a point of pride to bring radical stagings of Mozart operas to the composer's birthplace.</p>
        <p>Ms. Mattila was also disconcerted by the Robert Wilson ''Lohengrin'' last season at the Met. When the production was first presented in March 1998, critics and audiences were divided about the abstract scenic designs: against backdrops of shifting blues and grays, eerily illuminated white bars protruded from all sides of the stage. But the glacially slow, highly stylized hand and arm movements that Mr. Wilson devised for the singers and chorus were roundly criticized. You had to feel for the soprano Deborah Voigt, who sang Elsa, as she gamely tried to sing this demanding role while struggling to remember the series of poses she was supposed to strike.</p>
        <p>When the production returned last season, Ms. Mattila sang Elsa. This time Mr. Wilson was mostly absent. ''I met Bob Wilson only once during four weeks of rehearsal,'' she said, so the singers just decided to ''change things.''</p>
        <p>Working with Mr. Wilson's movement coordinator, they tried to simplify the gestures. There was still a posed, severely modern look to their portrayals, but the characters seemed more pliant and human, especially Ms. Mattila's. Radiating through her statuesque stances you could see Elsa's confusion, vulnerability and heartache.</p>
        <p>Although her work was widely praised, Ms. Mattila nevertheless found the production frustrating. She had hired a personal trainer to help her cope with the physical demands of the staging, but she always felt ''like an unfit ballet dancer,'' she said. ''I could not give as much energy to the movements as a dancer could. I had to leave strength for singing and not risk that balance.''</p>
        <p>After her first performance as Elsa, Mr. Wilson came backstage with hugs and congratulations. He has often described his directorial approach as simply providing a form for the performance to fill. But his forms can be terribly fussy and constraining. If Ms. Mattila's simplifications were so successful, then what was the point, one could ask, of the highly stylized movements in the first place?</p>
        <p>Given her recent experiences with avant-garde productions, Ms. Mattila approached the Met's ''Fidelio'' with some trepidation. She had never worked with Mr. Flimm -- also known for boldly modern conceptions -- whose new production of Wagner's ''Ring'' at Bayreuth this summer was generally praised.</p>
        <p>Having performed Leonore twice before -- first in a ''lousy production'' in Finland last year, she said, then in a musically rewarding concert performance in Paris conducted by Wolfgang Sawallisch -- Ms. Mattila said she felt that despite the opera's remarkable music, the character of Leonore was dramatically flawed.</p>
        <p>''I like playing real women,'' she said, ''not these idealized man-created women.''</p>
        <p>Yet from her initial meeting with Mr. Flimm, she was inspired by his vision. ''The work here started with a costume fitting,'' she said. ''I thought that the costumes looked too grim and ugly. Then I worked with Jurgen for six hours. By the evening I had totally changed. I thought: 'The costumes are perfect, but my hair is all wrong, too glamorous, too blond. What should we do?' ''</p>
        <p>The production is not exactly modern, Ms. Mattila said, but timeless in its imagery, powerfully real and relevant. Unjust political imprisonment still happens throughout the world, she said. The opera takes place entirely in the prison. In this production ''fear and death hang over everyone,'' she said: not just the prisoners but the prison workers who spend their days engaged in the numbing routine of running the place.</p>
        <p>Ms. Mattila has come to see Leonore as one of the ''real women'' she is drawn to. If you bring out only Leonore's self-sacrificing courage, she said, she becomes ''virtuous, pure and fleshless.'' Having worked with Mr. Flimm and with James Levine, one of her favorite colleagues, who will conduct, she hopes to show another side to this driven woman.</p>
        <p>''Leonore has a very hard and cruel plan to rescue her husband,'' she explained. Marzelline, the jailer's daughter, has developed a crush on the young ''man'' Fidelio. Leonore manipulates Marzelline's feelings to gain the jailer's trust.</p>
        <p>''She knows that she is going to crush Marzelline when it all comes out,'' Ms. Mattila said. ''But all is possible in love and war.'' Leonore has become obsessed with rescuing her husband. ''It has been two years since he was taken,'' she said. ''She has been at the prison for six months. She is getting so close. There is real desperation in her.''</p>
        <p>That Ms. Mattila has turned into such an impassioned opera singer sometimes surprises her, she said, for she was a latecomer to the genre who listened only to folk music and pop as a girl. She was raised on a farm with three brothers in Pernio, a town near the southwest coast of Finland. Soon she realized that the more she excelled at school the more she was excused from farm chores.</p>
        <p>Her parents, who both sang in local choruses, encouraged her musical studies and drove her to the regional music school some 10 miles away in Salo, where she took piano and voice lessons. But she didn't become interested in opera until after the Finnish equivalent of high school, when she entered the Sibelius Academy in Helsinki.</p>
        <p>Today Ms. Mattila and her husband, Tapio Kuneinen, a former car salesman who now tends to her career, have a residence in London, a good base from which to operate. But ''home home,'' as she put it, is Turku, a Finnish coastal town across the Gulf of Bothnia from Stockholm. They also have a cottage on an offshore island where Ms. Mattila could have spent her last two summers, had she not signed a three-year contract with the Salzburg Festival.</p>
        <p>In the summer of 1999, the first year of her commitment, she sang Donna Anna in ''Don Giovanni,'' another experimental production that failed: Mozart's characters are depicted as aging from impulsive youth to creaky senility. She has high hopes for next year's Salzburg opera, a new production of Janacek's ''Jenufa,'' with an interesting choice of conductor, John Eliot Gardiner, best known for his work in early music.</p>
        <p>The title role, which she will sing, is another vocally weighty challenge. Wisely, Ms. Mattila intends to return now and then to the more lyric roles from her repertory to maintain lightness and flexibility in her singing.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, additional dramatic soprano roles are in her future, she said, including Strauss's Salome in Paris in 2003. Wagner's Isolde has been suggested by some people she trusts, she added, though she thinks she will resist the temptation.</p>
        <p>''But you know,'' she said, ''in healthy circumstances, at a good age, maybe it will come.'' Her fans will have to wait and see. Ten years ago, even Ms. Mattila would not have guessed that she would be singing Leonore at all, let alone in a new Met production.</p>
