        <p>A Chinese factory near here will soon begin exporting to the United States RU-486, the abortion pill recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration, an official at the factory confirmed today.</p>
        <p>The Hualian Pharmaceutical Company, which owns the factory near the coast 25 miles south of Shanghai, has been making the drug since 1992 for use in the domestic market, where it is used to perform millions of abortions each year.</p>
        <p>The state-owned company and its parent, the Shanghai Pharmaceutical Group, declined to comment on the plans, but a company official said privately that the factory had recently received F.D.A. approval to export the drug to the United States.</p>
        <p>Because of strong opposition by anti-abortion activists, the F.D.A. has declined to identify the manufacturer that will supply the American market with the drug, which it approved for sale in the United States two weeks ago. But opponents of the drug reported weeks ago that the drug's United States distributor had contracted a Chinese factory to produce the RU-486 pills.</p>
        <p>RU-486 has inflamed passions on both sides of the abortion debate for years, and the idea that it is manufactured in China, where the government policy of limiting families to one child is anathema to social conservatives in the United States, is only likely to add to these tensions.</p>
        <p>Abortion opponents in the United States were quick to point out today that while the F.D.A. has kept the location of the RU-486 manufacturer a secret, the House of Representatives is investigating allegations that China has shipped tainted medicines to the United States.</p>
        <p>''China will add death and destruction to its list of imports,'' Senator Tim Hutchinson, an Arkansas Republican who is an outspoken abortion opponent, said in a statement today. Accusing the F.D.A. of jeopardizing the health of American women, Mr. Hutchinson said, ''It is telling that no U.S. firm would manufacture the drug and the F.D.A. had to look to the home of forced abortion and the notorious one-child policy to find a manufacturer for the U.S. market.''</p>
        <p>Another abortion opponent in the United States, Douglas Johnson of the National Right to Life Committee, complained that the F.D.A. could not possibly monitor a factory in China effectively. But an F.D.A. spokesman in Washington, declining to discuss the location of the factory, said it had received a thorough inspection.</p>
        <p>The identification of the Hualian factory as the supplier of RU-486 pills to the U.S. market was first reported today in The Washington Post.</p>
        <p>The pills, also known by the trade name Mifepristone, will be marketed in the United States by Danco Laboratories, a company set up by the nonprofit Population Council of New York. It was given the American rights to RU-486 from the French pharmaceutical manufacturer, Roussel-Uclaf, in 1995.</p>
        <p>Danco Laboratories, which is based in New York, declined to confirm that Hualian is the supplier of RU-486, saying in a statement that its contract ''prohibits us from discussing the identity or location of the manufacturer.''</p>
        <p>China already exports Mifepristone, which is manufactured by two other Chinese companies besides Hualian Pharmaceutical. Beijing No. 3 Pharmaceutical Factory exports the drug to India and Pakistan and other developing countries, according to Li Yong, a sales manager at the factory. And the Zhejiang Xianju Pharmaceutical Company, in Zhejiang province, lists the drug on its Web site among the pharmaceuticals it exports to Europe.</p>
        <p>Mifepristone has become an integral part of China's one-child policy since the drug was introduced on a wide scale here in the early 1990's. Gao Ersheng, director of the Shanghai Planned Parenthood Research Institute, estimates that 10 million abortions are performed in China each year, and says about half of those that are performed in the cities use the abortion drug.</p>
        <p>''Most unmarried women prefer Mifepristone, which is less painful and more private than surgical abortions,'' Mr. Gao said.</p>
        <p>He said the drug, which now requires a prescription in China, might soon be available over the counter for use as an emergency contraceptive, or ''morning after'' pill. Mifepristone blocks the action of progesterone, a hormone necessary to sustain pregnancy.</p>
        <p>But the drug is already widely available in unlicensed Chinese pharmacies, as is Misoprostol, a companion drug that forces the uterus to contract, expelling the dead embryo.</p>
