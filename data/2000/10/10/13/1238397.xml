        <p>Congress today approved permanent health care coverage for all retired career military personnel, at an estimated cost of $60 billion over the next decade.</p>
        <p>The new coverage, which was requested by the nation's senior military leaders, replaces a patchwork of benefits that relied on Medicare and a retiree's ability to use medical clinics at the nation's shrinking number of bases.</p>
        <p>''This is keeping America's promise to our veterans,'' said Representative Stephen E. Buyer, Republican of Indiana, who spearheaded the move in the House to guarantee the retirees this lifelong benefit.</p>
        <p>In proposing the program last February, Gen. Henry H. Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told Congress that recruiters and the country had promised lifelong health care to the men and women who made the military a career.</p>
        <p>''Keeping our promise of ensuring quality health care for military retirees is not only the right thing to do, it also is a pragmatic decision because it sends a strong signal to all those considering a career in uniform,'' General Shelton said.</p>
        <p>In this election year, when both the military and improved health care are popular issues, the House easily passed the program today as part of the $310 billion defense bill. The Senate vote tonight was 91 to 2, with Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, and Russell D. Feingold of Wisconsin, both Democrats, casting the opposing votes.. The House passed the legislation on Wednesday with a vote of 378 to 33.</p>
        <p>President Clinton has endorsed the legislation, and said he would sign it.</p>
        <p>''This health plan is absolutely vital because it demonstrates we keep our word,'' said Senator John W. Warner, the Virginia Republican who is chairman of the Armed Services Committee.</p>
        <p>Conferees from the House and Senate agreed last week to make the military retiree's health plan a new entitlement program, so the benefits will be as permanent as Social Security or Medicare.</p>
        <p>''Looked at from a federal budget perspective, it's troubling to make a significant new entitlement like this,'' said Robert Reischauer, president of the Urban Institute. ''But looked at from the perspective of equity, retired civilian bureaucrats already have similar coverage as this new plan.''</p>
        <p>The heart of the new program is the expansion of the military's huge health care plan, known as TriCare, to include those retirees who served at least 20 years in the military. Until now, they were dropped from TriCare as soon as they became eligible for Medicare and their only additional coverage was through military clinics or hospitals.</p>
        <p>But with the military trying to close more bases around the country, even that benefit was disappearing.</p>
        <p>Under the new plan, TriCare will pay most of the costs for treatments not covered by Medicare. Retirees and their families will be required to pay $3,000 annually for out-of-pocket medical expenses, less than half of the current $7,500 per family. In addition, the plan will give these older retirees a generous new prescription drug coverage that allows them to use mail order firms and retail pharmacies, paying no more than $150 in an annual deductible.</p>
        <p>''It's interesting that Congress recognizes that for this one group the Medicare benefit package isn't adequate,'' said Henry Aaron, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. ''One might well ask that if it isn't good enough for men and women who served in the armed forces, why is it good enough for men and women who spent a lifetime paying federal payroll taxes?''</p>
        <p>Representative John M. Spratt Jr., Democrat of South Carolina, said that the retired veterans are an exception who deserve more than Medicare because they were promised lifetime health care when they enlisted in the military years ago.</p>
        <p>While Republicans and Democrats said they had qualms about adding a permanent new entitlement, others saw this vote as a chance to promote expanded federal health care. Representative David R. Obey, a Democrat from Wisconsin, said he would vote for any improvement in health care.</p>
        <p>''I believe in health care from the cradle to the grave and voting to help this group may mean a higher level of shame for not covering every group,'' Mr. Obey said.</p>
        <p>Several analysts questioned the Pentagon's assertion that improving health benefits for retired veterans would prove the military keeps its word and help recruiters persuade more young men and women to join the armed forces.</p>
        <p>''This is a pretty expensive proposition,'' said Steven Kosiaic, director of budget studies for the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments. ''It's not likely to improve recruitment or convince people to stay in the military. The more effective way is to target pay increases that would have an immediate impact on people's families.''</p>
