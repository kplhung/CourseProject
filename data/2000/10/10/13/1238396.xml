        <p>The Rangers signed defenseman Vladimir Malakhov last summer so he could take pressure off Brian Leetch on the point during power plays. But it will be a month before Malakhov can rejoin Leetch.</p>
        <p>The Rangers yesterday announced that the 32-year-old Malakhov has a sprained anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee. He will be sidelined at least four weeks.</p>
        <p>Malakhov injured his knee midway through the season opener in Atlanta last Saturday while attempting to avoid a check. He signed a four-year, $14 million contract with the Rangers despite having been plagued by injuries through eight-plus seasons. Last year, he missed the Montreal Canadiens' first 54 games while recovering from reconstructive surgery on his right knee.</p>
        <p>Malakhov was traded to the Devils on March 1. He played only 24 regular-season games last season, but he played 23 in the postseason, and was an integral part of the Devils' Stanley Cup run.</p>
        <p>''I suppose Malakhov will be out four weeks,'' Sather said last night. ''He has a partially torn anterior cruciate ligament. But a lot of guys have played with this injury after re-habbing it.''</p>
        <p>Brad Brown took Malakhov's place alongside Kim Johnsson on the second defensive pairing and played well. ''He reminds me an awful lot of Beuk,'' Coach Ron Low said, referring to Jeff Beukeboom. ''With a little bit better foot speed, maybe.''</p>
        <p>Low was also pleased with his specialty teams. The Rangers, who opened last year 9 for their first 112 on the power play, are 4 for 12 this season. They have also killed all 13 power plays they have faced. And that is one reason the Rangers are 2-0 to open a season for the first time since 1989-90. That was also the last season that the Rangers won three consecutive games to start a season.</p>
        <p>Sather said yesterday that he did not anticipate making a trade. The Rangers have the option of recalling Mike Mottau, an offensive-minded rookie defenseman, from Hartford. But Sather said Mottau, who impressed the Rangers in training camp after missing the start as a holdout, is not quite ready to play in the National Hockey League.</p>
