        <p>Britt Jessen letter finds it disturbing that both presidential candidates, questioned in second debate, claimed not to know about their negative campaign ads (S)</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In Wednesday night's debate, Jim Lehrer, the moderator, asked both candidates to justify the name-calling in their ads -- Bush ads calling Al Gore a ''serial exaggerator'' and Gore ads calling Mr. Bush a bumbler (transcript, Oct. 12). Both acted as if they were unaware that these words had been used in their ads. Are we to believe, then, that if they don't know what is going on inside their own campaigns, they won't know what is going on inside their administrations? Will they simply pass the buck and say they were unaware?</p>

        <p>They had better be aware of what the people working for them are doing. This troubles me greatly.</p>
