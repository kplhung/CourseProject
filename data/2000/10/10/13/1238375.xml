        <p>In what might be called terminology inflation, penthouses are descending and town houses are levitating as architects, developers and marketers of new luxury buildings stretch definitions in seeking to sell their seven-figure wares.</p>
        <p>In a similar stretch, a building on Broadway that combines a residential component atop a commercial base is being billed as 70 stories high when there are actually only 49 floors, while the controversial Trump World Tower near the United Nations is advertised as 90 stories when it really bears only 72 floors.</p>
        <p>And, as variable as the vocabulary, reaction to the practice ranges from outright criticism to mild bemusement.</p>
        <p>''The issue is appropriation of quasi-architectural terms,'' said Reinhold Martin, a professor at the Columbia University Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation. ''Each reinvention reveals something. If somebody wants to buy an apartment and it's on the sixth floor of a 12-story building and it's advertised as a penthouse, what's being sold is the fantasy of the penthouse. If the person buys into it, that's their fantasy. I'm all for it.''</p>
        <p>But Andrew Alpern, an architectural historian, was not so sanguine. ''Talk about twisting language and reality,'' Mr. Alpern said. ''I write for a living, and I'm very aware of the need for precision in language. Words have customary meanings understood by ordinary people. Any unexpected use is deceptive unless completely explained.''</p>
        <p>The focus of the professionals' comments is the Beekman Regent, a 20-story condominium under construction at First Avenue and 51st Street. The first four floors incorporate the hollowed-out 1893 Romanesque Revival facades of what was once Public School 35.</p>
        <p>The terraced apartments on the fifth floor, just above the old school's facade, are being marketed as town houses -- a term commonly applied to row houses at street level. The top nine floors, each with wedding-cake style setbacks, are being called penthouses.</p>
        <p>Across town, at Broadway and 56th Street, a 630-foot-high building is rising -- its 26-story base to be headquarters for Random House, the publishing company, topped by a 23-story residential component called the Park Imperial.</p>
        <p>But the building is being marketed as 70 stories -- with the first residential floor labeled the 48th -- based on what the developer, the Related Companies, calculates as the number of floors it would have if it were entirely residential. (Generally, new office spaces have floor-to-floor heights of about 12 feet, while residential space is about 9 feet.)</p>
        <p>''They claim 'equivalent stories' is what counts,'' Mr. Alpern said. ''By that logic, the high-ceiling buildings along Fifth and Park would be several floors taller than they actually are. Paraphrasing Gertrude Stein: a floor is a floor is a floor.''</p>
        <p>The original meaning of penthouse was a structure on the roof, set back from the parapet. ''Thus, in the old days, when proper people wouldn't dream of living on a roof, penthouses were elevator superstructures, maid's rooms,'' Mr. Alpern said. Later, with Hollywood glamorizing the concept, the definition expanded to an apartment on the roof, ''but still always a one-story structure.''</p>
        <p>In 1929, new building regulations allowed higher structures if they were behind the building line. ''Those setbacks created terraced apartments, not penthouses,'' Mr. Alpern insisted. ''So eight stories of so-called penthouses atop the former P.S. 35 are not penthouses but terraced apartments.''</p>
        <p>The Beekman Regent is being marketed by the Marketing Directors, whose president, Adrienne Albert, said, ''They are unique homes with outdoor space enjoying the topmost levels of the building, as opposed to most high-rise buildings, which have a middle section with homes stacked one after another.''</p>
        <p>As to a town house being restricted to the ground floor, Ms. Albert said: ''That's a narrow interpretation. An important component of a town house is outdoor space. Our homes are configured similar to Upper East Side conventional town houses. They have outdoor space larger than most backyards. So, instead of accessing them from an exterior street, you are accessing them from an interior street -- the corridor.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Alpern, the strict constructionist, conceded some wiggle room, ''Whereas, the Beekman Regent is an apartment house effectively sitting on top of another building, it's not entirely unreasonable that that top serves like a street.''</p>
        <p>Other marketers took varying positions on variable definitions.</p>
        <p>Saying she preferred precision, Joyce West, vice president of the Charles H. Greenthal Group, pointed out: ''In the end, everyone sees the property they are going to buy. So, whether it's labeled town house or penthouse, loftlike or loft size, they're either going to like the space or not.''</p>
        <p>Frederick W. Peters, president of Ashforth Warburg Associates, particularly citing building-elevation reinterpretation, said: ''The notion 'big' is incredibly dear to the developer's heart. It's absolutely done for marketing. But not only to the community, it's also marketing to the industry -- impressing them with the size of your ambition and ability to deliver the goods.''</p>
        <p>By far the biggest stretch, Mr. Alpern said, is the word luxury, ''which developers use for anything beyond a public housing project and a 19th-century tenement that has not yet been gentrified.''</p>
        <p>Professor Martin at Columbia concurred: ''It's not only about square footage, nuts and bolts. This terminology game is, on one hand, a sort of ruse, on the other, an expression of something like the psychopathology of real estate.''</p>
