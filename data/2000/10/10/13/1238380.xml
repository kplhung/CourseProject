        <p>Vivendi S.A., the French conglomerate, has offered to sell its stake in the British Sky Broadcasting Group to secure European regulatory approval of its $34 billion purchase of the Seagram Company, a person close to the negotiations said tonight.</p>
        <p>The offer to sell the 23 percent stake in BSkyB, a large pay-television concern in Europe controlled by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, came on the eve of a decision by European antitrust regulators on whether to approve the Vivendi-Seagram deal, which would transform Vivendi into a leading entertainment power.</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Vivendi S.A., the French conglomerate, has offered to sell its stake in the British Sky Broadcasting Group to secure European regulatory approval of its $34 billion purchase of the Seagram Company, a person close to the negotiations said tonight.</p>
        <p>The offer to sell the 23 percent stake in BSkyB, a large pay-television concern in Europe controlled by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, came on the eve of a decision by European antitrust regulators on whether to approve the Vivendi-Seagram deal, which would transform Vivendi into a leading entertainment power.</p>
        <p>It is unclear tonight whether Vivendi's offer to sell the BSkyB stake, which is worth at least $6 billion, would be sufficient to allay the concerns of European regulators, who have asserted their authority in a number of high-profile global deals in recent months.</p>
        <p>Just in the last week, they forced Time Warner's music subsidiary and the EMI Group music company of Britain to scrap a joint venture that would have reduced the number of big competitors in the music business. And on Wednesday, European regulators approved Time Warner's $165 billion merger with America Online, but only after the companies pledged to sever ties with Bertelsmann A.G. of Germany, Europe's biggest media company.</p>
        <p>Publicly at least, Vivendi and Seagram have been proceeding on the assumption that their deal, first announced four months ago as a response to the Time Warner-America Online combination, will be approved by European regulators. Earlier today, they published for the first time forecasts of the value of the combination, saying they expected pro forma revenue of 24.6 billion euros, or $21.4 billion, this year, and 10 percent annual growth through 2002.</p>
        <p>The main concern of the European regulators is that the combined companies' store of entertainment programming and access to online customers could give them excessive bargaining power over both producers and consumers. Vivendi executives had said they would not distribute Seagram's music content exclusively through Vivendi channels for two years to allay the regulators' worries.</p>
        <p>Besides its interest in BSkyB, Vivendi controls wireless phone businesses in France and European cable television stations. It is also half-owner with Vodafone AirTouch of a system called Vizzavi that offers access to entertainment and the Internet through cell phones and other electronic devices. Seagram owns the Universal music and film studios.</p>
        <p>Speculation about the regulators' final decision was fueled here today after the Paris daily Le Monde ran a front page headline declaring ''Brussels Blocks the Vivendi-Seagram Merger,'' though the article beneath was far more equivocal.</p>
        <p>The planned merger has already cleared regulatory hurdles in the United States and Canada.</p>
        <p>Officials in Brussels and at Vivendi said Vivendi executives had met in Brussels with officials in the office of Mario Monti, the chief antitrust regulator. A Vivendi official said the meeting had involved ''questions and answers'' in which both sides apparently sought a solution to allow Mr. Monti to approve the deal Friday.</p>
        <p>Jean-Marie Messier, the Vivendi chairman, has described the deal as a European response to the merger of Time Warner and America Online. But the Vivendi deal poses sticky issues, including exclusive distribution deals that some Vivendi units, like the Canal Plus television services, enjoy with Vivendi's Internet service companies.</p>
        <p>Shares in Vivendi and Seagram have suffered, reflecting investor skepticism about the proposed deal. In New York, Seagram's stock dropped heavily today and analysts said it was in part because arbitragers, who had bought Seagram anticipating a sale, did not want to be stuck with the stock if European regulators blocked the deal. Seagram shares fell $2.75, or more than 4 percent, to $54 on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
        <p>In Paris, shares in Vivendi dropped 1.74 percent, to 84.50 euros, or about $73.52.</p>
