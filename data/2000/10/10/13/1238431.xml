        <p>Quiet attempts by the New York City Council to overturn part of a 1993 law on term limits appeared to gain momentum yesterday when Mayor Rudolph W.

        <p>Quiet attempts by the New York City Council to overturn part of a 1993 law on term limits appeared to gain momentum yesterday when Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said he might support such a measure. Under the law, 36 of the Council's 51 members would have to leave office on Dec. 31, 2001.</p>
        <p>''I am concerned about the fact that there will be a total and absolute turnover of city government, just about, in one day,'' the mayor said at a news conference when asked whether he would approve legislation to end term limits for Council members. ''I haven't made up my mind, but I would certainly consider some way to ameliorate that instant turnover.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani's comment followed reports, most recently in an article yesterday in Newsday, that several Council members hoped to amend or throw out the term limit law, which in most cases restricts them to two four-year terms.</p>
        <p>Council members said in interviews yesterday that they had had preliminary discussions about creating legislation to address term limits for the Council, but not those for the mayor, comptroller, public advocate or borough presidents, all of whom will have to leave office under the same 1993 law.</p>
        <p>Whether a Council bill to free itself from term limits would survive a court challenge in court remains in doubt, since the limits were imposed under a referendum on the City Charter. But the Council members said yesterday that they were convinced changes could legally be made before the 2001 election. They also said that the Council could override a mayoral veto, but that any assurance that Mr. Giuliani would support the changes increased the likelihood that the legislation would be introduced.</p>
        <p>''It has been talked about,'' said Madeline Provenzano, a Democrat of the Bronx who is one of 15 council members whose term limits are not up at the end of next year.</p>
        <p>The rule is complicated for members like Ms. Provenzano, who was elected in 1997 because of midterm redistricting, which occurs once every decade. It limits those members to six years in office, ending in 2003.</p>
        <p>''When you are limited to two terms, people tend to spend their second term just looking around for something else,'' Ms. Provenzano said. She said that she expected a Council resolution calling for changes in the term limits to be introduced in the next six months.</p>
        <p>Walter McCaffrey, a Democrat of Queens who has been on the Council since 1986 and cannot run for re-election next year, said: ''The problems with term limits are just beginning to sink in with people in neighborhoods that will be devastated.'' He said voters would benefit from a change in the law because they would retain seasoned Council members who had influence.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani said yesterday that he might decide to support a change in term limits because some veteran Council members had been helpful to him during his early days at City Hall.</p>
        <p>''It was very valuable,'' he said, adding that some of the members, including Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone, a 27-year veteran, ''deserve a lot of the credit for supporting things we had to do to get the city out of fiscal crisis.''</p>
        <p>But the mayor said that he would not support an end to mayoral term limits.</p>
        <p>''I think two terms as mayor of New York City, at least two in a row,'' he said, is ''the right way to do it.'' But he added that he would leave open the option of running for mayor again, ''maybe sometime later on.''</p>
