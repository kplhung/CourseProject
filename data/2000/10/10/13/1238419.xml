        <p>New York City, a place of abundance, has long been home to two baseball teams, two opera companies and two major airports. Lately, it has also seemed the home of two first ladies.</p>
        <p>On Monday, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani marched happily up Fifth Avenue in one of the city's major political shows, the Columbus Day Parade, with his frequent companion, Judith Nathan.</p>
        <p>Although Ms. Nathan at first walked between two mayoral security guards a step behind Mr. Giuliani -- and was not with him when he greeted Archbishop Edward M. Egan outside St. Patrick's Cathedral -- by the time the parade neared Columbus Circle she had moved abreast of the mayor and into the front row with Gov. George E. Pataki, Representative Rick A. Lazio and Mr. Lazio's wife, Patricia. Like a would-be first lady, Ms. Nathan smiled at spectators and chatted animatedly with Senator John McCain of Arizona.</p>
        <p>Less than 72 hours later, Mr. Giuliani's estranged wife, Donna Hanover, presented an award to Public School 321 in Park Slope, Brooklyn. ''I am the first lady of New York City,'' Ms. Hanover told the auditorium of excited second graders yesterday, after first saying that she was a journalist and an actress who appeared in movies and on television. Mr. Giuliani's name was never mentioned, although at least one faculty member, acknowledging the awkwardness, had tried to explain to the children beforehand.</p>
        <p>''I told them in the classroom that this woman is the mayor's wife,'' said Eileen Lynch, a second-grade teacher. ''I didn't know how to put it.''</p>
        <p>Neither do many these days in the city's political circles, where people  cannot help but notice that the two women in the mayor's life seem to be advancing more than retreating. Increasingly, Ms. Nathan is taking a public role at Mr. Giuliani's side while Ms. Hanover, who lives at Gracie Mansion with the mayor and the couple's two children, continues to perform many of her first lady duties. Next week, she will begin starring in ''The Vagina Monologues,'' the Off Broadway hit that features women discussing topics like orgasm and childbirth.</p>
        <p>Still, it is Ms. Nathan, a district sales manager for Bristol-Myers Squibb, who is the more frequently  visible. In the last three months, she has appeared with the mayor at a news conference after the surgical procedure to treat his prostate cancer, at a concert at Madison Square Garden and at a private fund-raiser for Mr. Lazio at the Republican National Convention.</p>
        <p>Last month, she gaily snapped pictures in the front row at the City Hall swearing-in ceremony for Police Commissioner Bernard B. Kerik.</p>
        <p>''She's the first lady de facto, and the other one is the first lady de jure,'' said Norman Adler, a political consultant who works for both Republicans and Democrats. Mr. Giuliani, he added, ''is one of the most liberated people in New York.''</p>
        <p>''He knows when his term is over,'' Mr. Adler said. ''He's not running for anything else, and he doesn't owe anybody anything. He can do as he pleases, and he is.''</p>
        <p>Representative Peter King of Long Island, a Republican, agreed. ''As far as Rudy's concerned, he's never really cared what people think about him,'' he said. ''And he's made it a part of his persona. I haven't always gotten along with Rudy, but he's never pretended to be something that he's not. He's never run as a great moralist, and he's never run as a nice guy.''</p>
        <p>The mayor's complicated personal life has so far had no effect on the workings of city government, although city police officers are sometimes watching over both women. At least one person in Mr. Giuliani's team of bodyguards keeps an eye on Ms. Nathan when she attends public events with the mayor.</p>
        <p>Ms. Hanover, meanwhile, continues to employ a first lady staff of four -- a part-time press secretary and a full-time chief of staff, coordinator of public affairs and executive assistant -- whose salaries cost city taxpayers more than $200,000 a year. She is driven to and from her events and her jobs in journalism and acting by plainclothes New York City police officers.</p>
        <p>Both women declined to be interviewed for this article.</p>
        <p>But friends of Ms. Hanover have described her as distraught by Ms. Nathan's public ascension and determined to remain at Gracie Mansion until the end of her husband's mayoralty in December 2001. ''She is really, profoundly sad, and she's very worried about her children,'' said Ellen Levine, the editor in chief of Good Housekeeping, the magazine that has hired Ms. Hanover to do occasional interviews.</p>
        <p>Friends of the mayor have in contrast described him as in love with Ms. Nathan and angry over Ms. Hanover's appearance in ''The Vagina Monologues'' and her insistence on maintaining a public role. The mayor, they add, is focused on his health and his mortality and remains unconcerned about the effect of his public behavior on whatever political future he may have.</p>
        <p>''The normal political reaction would be, 'Don't flaunt it,' '' a friend of Mr. Giuliani said. ''But he's never done anything that's in the normal, politically accepted routine. He's broken every rule in the book, and succeeded at it.''</p>
        <p>Political consultants added that President Clinton's affair with a White House intern had changed the rules in what was already a tolerant city. ''I think New Yorkers are yawning,'' said Hank Sheinkopf, a Democratic political consultant.</p>
        <p>''He's perceived as a guy who's on the way out,'' Mr. Sheinkopf said.  ''And because he's sick, he can get away with anything.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani's life began unraveling during three tumultuous weeks last spring, when he announced during his Senate race against Hillary Rodham Clinton that he had prostate cancer, had a close friend in Ms. Nathan and was separating from his wife. On Mother's Day weekend, when Ms. Hanover and the couple's two children were visiting Ms. Hanover's parents in California, Mr. Giuliani took an after-dinner stroll with Ms. Nathan in an explosion of flashbulbs up Second Avenue, flabbergasting state Republicans.</p>
        <p>Within a week, the mayor had withdrawn from the Senate race, citing his health. But one of his longtime friends, Msgr. Alan J. Placa, said later that Mr. Giuliani's marital problems had played a big role in his decision to drop out.</p>
        <p>The mayor's children, Andrew 14, and Caroline, 11, have been kept out of the spotlight.</p>
        <p>Ms. Nathan, who is divorced and has a teenage daughter, receded a bit from public view after the Second Avenue stroll, but by the Fourth of July resurfaced with Mr. Giuliani in a parade in Staten Island, where she waved to spectators and gave the mayor a wink. Earlier in the day, she appeared with Mr. Giuliani aboard the command ship Mount Whitney, anchored in New York Harbor -- at the same time that Ms. Hanover appeared in a ceremony on another ship in the city's waters, the Intrepid Sea-Air-Space Museum.</p>
        <p>By early that evening, Mr. Giuliani was heading back to Manhattan with Ms. Nathan, while Ms. Hanover spent her evening watching the Macy's fireworks display with her children at the Water Club on the East River.</p>
        <p>Since then, Ms. Hanover has presided over an event for the St. Mary's Hospital for Children, visited New York University Medical Center's neonatal intensive care unit with representatives of the March of Dimes and appeared on stage with the actresses Julianna Margulies and Marisa Tomei at a benefit for Project A.L.S., an organization that raises money for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, the fatal illness known as Lou Gehrig's disease.</p>
        <p>In the same period, Ms. Nathan has attended a town hall meeting with Mr. Giuliani, marched with him in the Steuben Day parade and appeared with him at an adoption fair in Central Park. She also stood with the mayor's closest advisers during Mr. Giuliani's news conference after his surgical procedure last month at Mount Sinai Hospital. ''I want to thank Judith for being here,'' Mr. Giuliani said, looking toward Ms. Nathan. ''Thank you.''</p>
        <p>Although the mayor has made few other public comments in recent months about Ms. Nathan, he did talk extensively about both women in his life when he abruptly said at a news conference that he was seeking a separation from his wife, who was caught unaware by her husband's announcement.</p>
        <p>''Judith Nathan is a very, very fine person,'' the mayor said then. ''She's been a very good friend to me, before I had to deal with the decisions that I have to make about my illness and what to do about it, and I rely on her, and she helps me a great deal. And I'm going to need her now more than maybe I did before.''</p>
        <p>Then the mayor turned his comments to his wife. ''Donna Hanover is a wonderful woman,'' he said. ''And she's a wonderful mother. She's someone that I respect tremendously. The fact that we've grown independent, we've grown more separate over the years, who knows why those things happen? But she is a very, very fine, wonderful person, and she's an extraordinary mother and I have tremendous respect for her.''</p>
