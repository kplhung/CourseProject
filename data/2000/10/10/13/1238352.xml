        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>An Oct. 7 news article reports that recent court rulings have invoked the First Amendment to block state efforts to impose ethics rules and finance restrictions on state judicial campaigns that have turned ''nastier and more expensive.'' The root cause of this contentiousness among candidates is that judicial elections are more closely resembling other political campaigns, as judges make political decisions from the bench. Most striking are rulings invalidating tort reform laws, with some even dispossessing legislatures of their historic role in regulating tort policy.</p>

        <p>When judges strike down laws for partisan purposes, the only recourse is to take the issue to the electorate.  That is why federal courts are protecting the right of judicial candidates to campaign vigorously.</p>
