      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>A selective listing of new or noteworthy cabaret shows in Manhattan this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended show.</p>
        <p>CHRISTINE ANDREAS, Cafe Carlyle, at the Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, (212) 744-1600. With her high sweet soprano and eager intensity, Ms. Andreas embodies an eternal ingenue who is just waking up to the realization that life doesn't have a fairy-tale ending. Although the smart Brazilian-flavored arrangements for a pop-jazz quartet led by Lee Musiker don't always match her floating Broadway lyricism, Ms. Andreas leaves her romantic imprint on songs like ''He Loves Me,'' ''How Insensitive,'' ''And So It Goes'' and Dave Frishberg's wonderful little-known ballad ''Listen Here.'' Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:45 and 10:45. Cover: $60 at tables, no minimum; dinner available but not required, 6 p.m. to midnight. Bobby Short opens on Tuesday and remains through December. Monday nights at 8:45, through Dec. 17, Woody Allen with Eddy Davis's New Orleans Jazz Band. Cover: $60; no minimum (Stephen Holden).</p>

        <p>A selective listing of new or noteworthy cabaret shows in Manhattan this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended show.</p>
        <p>CHRISTINE ANDREAS, Cafe Carlyle, at the Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, (212) 744-1600. With her high sweet soprano and eager intensity, Ms. Andreas embodies an eternal ingenue who is just waking up to the realization that life doesn't have a fairy-tale ending.

Monday nights at 8:45, through Dec. 17, Woody Allen with Eddy Davis's New Orleans Jazz Band. Cover: $60; no minimum (Stephen Holden).</p>
        <p>* POLLY BERGEN, Feinstein's, at the Regency, 540 Park Avenue, at 61st Street, (212) 339-4095. Ms. Bergen's first New York club appearance in 35 years is a revelation. The singer, whose pop contralto is in fine shape despite having picked up some gravel, pours her life into songs with an intensity and a dramatic force matched by hardly any other veteran cabaret performer. This woman has been around, and she knows the score and still has joie de vivre and a sense of humor. Her versions of ''The Party's Over,'' ''The Ladies Who Lunch,'' ''Here's That Rainy Day,'' ''I Don't Remember Christmas,'' ''Why Was I Born?'' and ''Stars'' (Janis Ian's excoriation of fame) are close to definitive. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:30 and 11; Tuesday night through Thursday night at 8:30. Through Oct. 21. Cover: $50, Tuesdays through Thursdays at 8:30 and for the late show on Fridays; $75 for the early show Fridays and early and late shows on Saturdays. Food and beverage minimum: $50 for early shows; $25 for late shows (Holden).</p>
        <p>''BERLIN TO BROADWAY WITH KURT WEILL,'' Triad, 158 West 72nd Street, (212) 239-6200. If this is not a flawless revue, it is nevertheless an ingratiating tribute to Kurt Weill's achievement. Fridays at 10:30 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 4:30 and 7:30 p.m.; Mondays and Tuesdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays at 3 p.m.; no performance Thursdays. Tickets: $45 (Lawrence Van Gelder).</p>
        <p>* HOWARD FISHMAN QUARTET, Sardi's, 234 West 44th Street, (212) 221-8440. Powerful echoes of Stephane Grappelli and Bix Beiderbecke are among the influences rippling through the Howard Fishman Quartet's seamless swing. The group -- Mr. Fishman on guitar, banjo and vocals; Russell Farhang playing virtuosic Grappelli-style violin; Erik Jekabson on trumpet; and Jonathan Flaugher on bass -- folds elements of vintage jazz, swing and early bluegrass into rhythmically animated, richly allusive jazz chamber music. Whether the music is Stephen Foster (a bubbly ''Old Folks at Home''), Gershwin (''Soon'') or Romberg (''When I Grow Too Old to Dream''), it is all translated into lilting, fine-tuned ensemble music that transcends time and idiom. Friday nights at 10:30. No cover charge, but $15 minimum at tables. The Howard Fishman Quartet also performs Sunday nights at 8:30 (through Oct. 22) at Joe's Pub, Joseph Papp Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 539-8778 or (212) 239-6200. Tickets: $12 (Holden).</p>
        <p>KAREN MASON, Arci's Place, 450 Park Avenue South, at 30th Street, (212) 532-4370. This high-strung, likable performer from Chicago still exudes the effervescent eagerness of a hometown drama student who has just arrived in New York bursting with starry-eyed ambition. Her new cabaret show concentrates on popular standards. High points include zany 60's cabaret numbers like Cy Coleman and Carolyn Leigh's ''When in Rome'' and Stephen Sondheim and Mary Rodgers's bossa nova spoof ''The Boy From . . .'' But her big ballads are undermined by a tendency to overbelt. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:30 and 11; Sunday night at 8. Cover: $30; $15 minimum. Also at Arci's Place, jazz brunch Sundays at noon, with Bill Wurtzel and Howard Morgen. Cover: $19.95, prix fixe or $15 minimum at the table; Mondays at 8, through Dec. 18, Jim Caruso, singer, in ''Live and in Person,'' with musical direction and piano accompaniment by Billy Stritch. Cover: $25; $15 minimum. Opening Tuesday, through Nov. 4, Wesla Whitfield, singer (Holden).</p>
        <p>SALLY MAYES, Firebird Cafe, 363 West 46th Street, Clinton (212) 586-0244. The platinum-haired sometime Broadway performer (''She Loves Me'') has a nice feel for the 1940's and 50's Broadway and swing music. One of the high points of her effervescent cabaret show (a best-of anthology of 10 years of her nightclub work) is the Savage Medley, a compendium of witty songs with elegantly salacious lyrics by Betty Comden and Adolph Green. Another is her signature song, ''Miss Byrd,'' from the Off Broadway show ''Closer Than Ever.'' Best when she's peppy, Ms. Mayes is a bland balladeer. The show has superb musical direction by Patrick Brady. Through Oct. 21. Tonight and tomorrow night at 11 and Wednesday and Thursday at 9 p.m. Also at the Firebird Cafe: Alexandra Haas, singer, tonight through Sunday night at 9. Cover: $30; $15 minimum. Sunday night at 7, Babbie Green, part of singer-songwriters series. Cover: $20; $15 minimum (Holden).</p>
        <p>* MAUREEN McGOVERN, Oak Room, Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, (212) 840-6800. Ms. McGovern's gorgeous voice and the melodies of Richard Rodgers were meant for each other. This singer's demureness and sense of proportion prevent Rodgers and Hammerstein ballads like ''Climb Ev'ry Mountain'' and ''You'll Never Walk Alone'' from turning to mush. She brings a fine mixture of wit and precision to Rodgers and Hart standards like ''To Keep My Love Alive.'' Not only is this singer the closest American equivalent to Julie Andrews in her vocal prime, but she also adds a jazzy coloratura panache. Tonight and tomorrow night at 9 and 11:30. Cover: $50, with dinner required for early shows on Fridays and Saturdays; $15 minimum for other shows; suggested dinner arrival for early show is 7. Also at the Algonquin, Sunday brunch at 2 p.m. (seating begins at 1 p.m.), Leslie Orofino, singer, in ''Moonlight Cocktails.'' $50, including the performance. There is also a performance next Friday night at 9:30, with a $40 music charge and a $15 food and drink minimum. International Festival of Cabaret: Monday night at 9, Michel Hermon, and Natalie Gamsu, singers; $40 cover and $15 minimum (Holden).</p>
        <p>BEMELMANS BAR, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, (212) 744-1600. Michael Devine, Tuesdays through Saturdays at 5 p.m., through Dec. 30. Peter Mintun, pianist, tonight and tomorrow night beginning at 9:30 p.m. Cover: $15 at table and $5 at the bar; no minimum.</p>
        <p>NEW YORK CABARET CONVENTION, Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, (212) 840-2824. Monday night at 6, gala opening, including Karen Akers, James Alexander, Chris Calloway, Claiborne Cary, Mary Cleere Haran, Jeff Harnar, Karen Mason, Rita Moreno, Donna Murphy and Wesla Whitfield.
