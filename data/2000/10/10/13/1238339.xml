        <p>IT takes perhaps 10 minutes to walk from the National Exhibition Center here to the headquarters of what is now known as the MG Rover Group. And yet, when a biennial motor show opens to the public at the center next Thursday, there will be no display of MG Rover's cars.</p>
        <p>This startling absence by the region's biggest automaker -- akin to General Motors not participating in the Detroit auto show -- is a sign of the huge challenges that confront MG Rover, the former Rover Group. After suffering huge losses, BMW sold the Rover operations to British investors this year for a nominal $14.</p>
        <p>MG Rover has limited cash that it must spend wisely -- not even on a display at the local auto show. It must also re-establish its credibility among car buyers. A central part of its new strategy, reflected in the name change, is to put greater emphasis on the long-moribund MG brand. But American car enthusiasts with recollections of all those MG B, A, TC, TF and TD roadsters of yesteryear should not reach for their checkbooks yet. None of the current MG Rover models have had the expensive crash and emissions tests that might allow them to be sold in the United States.</p>
        <p>Despite the tumultuous history of MG Rover -- known over the decades as British Leyland, BL and BMC, among others -- there is still value in the MG name, said Steve Saxty of FutureBrand, a brand-consulting firm in London. ''The real issue, though, is how much it appeals to today's customers,'' he said. ''A lot of the value is tied up in America, but it has no delivery mechanism in the U.S.'' He said the company was selling MG F's to customers in Europe ''in their 50's, not the twenty- and thirtysomethings it expected to.''</p>
        <p>The emphasis is different, and much friendlier to the American market, at the other marques that were once MG's stablemates. BMW, which sold Land Rover to Ford for a more impressive $2.7 billion, retained the Mini brand and will bring out an all-new model in Europe next fall, with American sales to follow.</p>
        <p>MG Rover will do most of its business in Europe, and in Britain in particular. Over the coming months, it will introduce sporty versions of Rover's 25, 45 and 75 sedans that will wear MG badges. The company will also endow the MG F, a midengine roadster, with much higher performance. That was a move that BMW seemed reluctant to take, perhaps to keep the car from stealing thunder from its own Z3 roadster.</p>
        <p>MG Rover's greatest challenge concerns economies of scale. It is committed to selling four lines of cars, which it makes in a single old factory in Birmingham, for a total of 200,000 cars a year. Global consolidation means big automakers now consider a million units as a starting point for mainstream models.</p>
        <p>MG Rover says it will sign a technology transfer agreement with an unspecified high-volume carmaker that will allow it to make its own cars using chassis, suspension and steering components designed by another company. Real independence would then disappear, but a partner with a global perspective could provide the long-term security that MG lacks.</p>
