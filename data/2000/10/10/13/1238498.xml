      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Israeli helicopter gunships rocketed Ramallah and Gaza City today after a Palestinian mob here stabbed and stomped to death two Israeli reserve soldiers and then paraded a mutilated body through town.</p>
        <p>Blaming the Israelis' vigilante killings squarely on the Palestinian Authority, Israelis described their rocket attacks as ''limited'' and ''symbolic'' responses, delivered with warning so the targeted sites could be evacuated and casualties kept low.</p>
        <p>But as Israeli tanks, warships and helicopters surrounded the Palestinian territories, as rotors chopped through the night and an acrid burnt smell perfumed the air, panicked Palestinians said they did not see anything symbolic in the Israeli actions.</p>
        <p>''If this is not war, I don't know what else it is,'' said Saeb Erekat, a senior Palestinian official. ''If these tanks and choppers firing missiles at a civilian population do not constitute war, then I don't know what war is.''</p>
        <p>What happened today was a collision of what each side sees as the other's core ugliness: the hate-filled Palestinian mob, in Israeli eyes, versus the arrogant Israeli military machine, in Palestinian ones. Together they combusted in a devastating blow to the seven-year-old peace effort, unraveling relations between the two sides to a new low.</p>
        <p>The Middle East was pushed to the brink of an open war.</p>
        <p>Before the rockets started falling, Palestinian youths danced on the bloody spot where one Israeli was tossed through floral curtains into the mob below. In a call and response, they chanted: ''Here is where we gouged his eyes! Here is where we ripped off his legs! Here is where we smashed in his face!'' One teenage boy joyously thrust in the air the oil dipstick from the charred carcass of the soldiers' car, which had been burnt by the mob and lay curled beneath a billboard that said, ''Rule of Law Project.''</p>
        <p>Less than an hour later, rockets demolished the police station where the mob attack had taken place. They also struck a police headquarters in Gaza and knocked out the transmitter for a Palestinian Authority radio station that the Israelis hold responsible for ''inciting'' Palestinian violence.</p>
        <p>About 16 people were wounded in the attacks by early evening, and Palestinians huddled in their homes, some in the dark.</p>
        <p>Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, was in Gaza when the Israeli rockets plowed into a guard post just 150 yards from his beachside headquarters. He was not hurt, and, afterward, he made an uncharacteristic trip outside his compound, to visit the wounded at a Gaza Hospital.</p>
        <p>Shlomo Ben-Ami, Israel's acting foreign minister, said, ''We defined this as a limited operation to send a message that Israel cannot tolerate such a humiliating attack on its citizens and soldiers.''</p>
        <p>Prime Minister Ehud Barak called it a ''pinpoint'' operation that was ''carried out with precision and success and a minimum of casualties.'' He also warned for the second day in a row about a possible revival of terrorism, and cautioned Israelis to display ''unusual alertness.''</p>
        <p>And Mr. Barak again suggested that all Israeli political parties join him in a national emergency government, specifically inviting the right-wing Likud Party led by Ariel Sharon late tonight. The prime minister's office said talks between the two leaders would continue.</p>
        <p>In Washington, President Clinton said: ''The alternative to the peace process is no longer hypothetical. It is unfolding today before our eyes.''</p>
        <p>The mood alternated between depressed and ugly on both sides.</p>
        <p>Israeli youths marched through Jerusalem chanting, ''Death to the Arabs!'' Gaza City residents stuffed suitcases into overfilled cars and fled. In Jericho, Palestinians attacked an ancient synagogue that has been protected by the Palestinian Authority for years; the police intervened and kept them from burning it, Palestinian officials said.</p>
        <p>Stunned by the rapid deterioration, world leaders urged each side to pull back from the brink. In Washington, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright expressed her outrage at the killing of the Israeli soldiers and called for international pressure on Mr. Arafat to curtail his people's violence. But she also urged the Israelis to stop bombing.</p>
        <p>''No matter how justified they feel by the mob violence against their soldiers, we are calling on the Israelis to bring an immediate end to the current operations by the I.D.F.,'' she said, referring to the Israeli Defense Forces. ''Now is the time for leadership. There needs to be a cease-fire by both sides.''</p>
        <p>The Israeli cabinet decided in an emergency meeting in Tel Aviv that it would stop the rocket attacks and  see how the Palestinians reacted.  Several ministers pushed for further military action, and one warned of punishment for the vigilantes.</p>
        <p>''We will find all of those who present at the lynching, the policemen, the civilians,'' Amnon LipkinShahak, the transportation minister, said at the meeting's end. ''We will find them if it takes a day, a week, a month, a year, and the state of Israel will settle its accounts with them.''</p>
        <p>Today's events were a climax of two weeks of street violence in the West Bank, Gaza and inside Israel that took more than 90 lives. Intensive diplomatic efforts were under way to bring the Israelis and the Palestinians if not back to the peace table at least to a truce agreement, and clashes went through a brief lull. But experts on both sides had predicted that it would take only one ''incident'' to escalate the situation into a new kind of conflict.</p>
        <p>That incident came today.</p>
        <p>There are different versions of what happened. The Israelis say a car full of reserve duty soldiers -- middle-age civilians called to uniform because of the crisis -- had gotten lost on the way to army headquarters at the Beit El junction outside Ramallah. Entering the Palestinian-ruled city by back roads, the soldiers were not stopped by the Israeli roadblocks turning back Israeli citizens because of the tensions.</p>
        <p>In the city center, near the traffic circle called Al Manara Square, a crowd was gathering for the funeral of a Palestinian man who had been killed by Israeli bullets this week. The Israeli soldiers accidentally and fatefully drove right into the middle of this angry, mournful crowd, according to witnesses. Mr. Barak said tonight that the soldiers had been abducted at gunpoint from a Palestinian roadblock.</p>
        <p>The Palestinians do not believe this. They say the soldiers were undercover agents. The Israelis say that no covert units have been used in the last two weeks, during which they say they have only defended themselves and their property. Also, a blurry videotape of part of the incident seems to show a man in uniform.</p>
        <p>And it is unlikely that an undercover agent would use a car with a yellow Israeli license plate, which stand out clearly among Palestinian Authority plates.</p>
        <p>But the Palestinian belief that the men were agents -- and that they had been sent to commit an assassination at the funeral -- circulated and riled up the crowd.</p>
        <p>The Palestinian police stopped the Israeli car to question the soldiers.</p>
        <p>They found guns and grenades inside, the Palestinians say. Because the unruly crowd was pushing in on them, they led the soldiers to the police station a block away, they say. Thousands then surrounded the station, a two-story stone structure with a flimsy blue gate. Quickly, they shoved past the Palestinian police, some of whom fired in the air while others just stepped aside.</p>
        <p>Israeli officials say they believe that the Palestinian police at best had lost control and at worst had facilitated the attacks or even committed them.</p>
        <p>In a second-story office, visible to the chanting crowd below, men beat and stabbed one of the soldiers. Witnesses said they then hurled his body into the frenzied group below. The crowd stomped his body and beat it with sticks. His clothing was set on fire. Two men grabbed his feet, two his wrists, and they marched him through the thronged streets to Al Manara Square. Men rode on one another's shoulders, whistling and clapping.</p>
        <p>Soon after, the Palestinian authorities transferred his body and that of a gravely wounded companion to the Israeli forces. The second reserve soldier soon died.</p>
        <p>An Israeli official identified the two soldiers as Vadim Norzech, 33, a recent immigrant from the former Soviet Union, and Yosef Avrahami, 38.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak said Israeli authorities were investigating the possibility that a third Israeli man had also been attacked.</p>
        <p>An Israeli Army spokesman said that three television crews had filmed the mob, but that Palestinian police had confiscated their film. An Italian television crew got away with their tape, and has been broadcasting it. The tape, the spokesman said, clearly showed that the police had handed the men over to the mob. But, he said, they would not allow it on the air here.</p>
        <p>''From a P.R. point of view, it would be excellent to show the mutilated bodies,'' said Raanan Gissen, the spokesman, who himself is on reserve duty and is usually a senior aide to Mr. Sharon, the opposition leader. ''But because of the sanctity of the dead, which is a big thing here in Israel, we cannot.''</p>
        <p>After the attack, the Palestinian police by loudspeaker urged schools and shops to close and civilians to go home. The center of this bustling town grew eerily deserted. A police officer urged a photographer to film the blood that dribbled out the station door and through the courtyard. ''We want their mothers to see this so they can understand what our mothers went through,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The burned hulk of the soldiers' Mazda became an ogling point, and youths claimed car parts as trophies.</p>
        <p>''Sharon, have a look,'' the youths sang. ''Barak, have a look. We are clearly killing your soldiers.''</p>
        <p>Talking to journalists who showed up later, one man said: ''Why are making all this hysteria? Hundreds of ours have died.''</p>
        <p>Later, Palestinian officials expressed regret for the mob killings.</p>
        <p>In the midafternoon, the Palestinian police began clearing the area in front of the police station. They cleared out of the building themselves, having been alerted by the Israelis that the gunships were on their way.</p>
        <p>The muezzin began the call for prayer over the central mosque's loudspeaker. The first rocket demolished half the second floor, sending its white stones flying into the street with sheets of glass. The police approached the building, running, as sirens screamed and gunshots popped. ''Anybody inside?'' a police officer screamed, jumping over the wall and back out after a quick search. After a second rocket, the cars beside the station were leaping with flames. After the third, the roof caved in.</p>
        <p>In clouds of smoke, the Cobra helicopters flew away. Tentatively, men lying on their stomachs or crouched in doorways approached the building. Marwan Barghouti, who is a leader of Mr. Arafat's Fatah party, inspected the building. When he came out, he said: ''This will not threaten the Palestinians. You can see that nobody in this street is afraid, even now.''</p>
        <p>Israeli officials said they hoped that Mr. Arafat would now take stock of the last two weeks of violence.</p>
        <p>''In army guttural language, we want to say to Arafat: 'Don't mess with us. Stop the violence,' '' Mr. Gissen said. ''These were limited, measured responses.''</p>
        <p>''Believe me, if we wanted to use the full measure, this is one-tenth,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Through the night, there were exchanges of fire reported in the West Bank, and Israeli helicopters shot at police targets in Nablus and Jericho.</p>
        <p>The Palestinian Authority released political prisoners, including Islamic fundamentalist group members, some of whom were being held without charges at Israel's request.</p>
