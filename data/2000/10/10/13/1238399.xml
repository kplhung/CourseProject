        <p>Gov. George W. Bush's accusation that aid money from the International Monetary Fund lined the pockets of a former Russian prime minister was denied today by the monetary fund and the former Russian official, raising questions about Mr. Bush's pointed charge in Wednesday's otherwise cordial discussion of foreign policy issues.</p>
        <p>The comments about misused aid reflect growing skepticism among many Congressional Republicans about the role of the I.M.F., which some critics have accused of wasting billions and supporting corrupt governments.</p>
        <p>Vice President Al Gore's campaign cited the dispute over the accuracy of Mr. Bush's statement as proof that the Texas governor ''does not meet presidential standards'' in foreign policy. The Clinton administration has defended the I.M.F. as vital in financial emergencies.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush on Wednesday named Russia as an ''egregious'' example of misspent aid. He said Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, the former Russian prime minister, had personally profited from I.M.F. lending. Some of the agency's money ''ended up in Viktor Chernomyrdin's pocket,'' Mr. Bush said.</p>
        <p>The barb was clearly aimed at Mr. Gore, who has had a prominent role in managing relations with Russia and reached numerous agreements with the longtime prime minister.</p>
        <p>The I.M.F., which acknowledges failing to stabilize Russia's economy and currency in the 1990's, has repeatedly denied that aid money -- at one point it had about $25 billion in outstanding loans to Russia -- was siphoned off.</p>
        <p>The Russian central bank hired the accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers L.L.P. last year to audit its I.M.F. loans. The auditors reported that the central bank had once lied about the size of its currency reserves and that it had stored some I.M.F. funds in offshore accounts. But it also asserted that all I.M.F. loans had been accounted for and that there was no evidence of theft.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chernomyrdin issued a statement in Moscow today denying the accusations and threatening to sue Mr. Bush for slander.</p>
        <p>''I think Mr. Bush Jr. should be getting ready for a court hearing on the issue,'' Mr. Chernomyrdin said.</p>
        <p>The Bush campaign said today that Mr. Bush stood by his statement.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Bush himself softened his tone today in an interview with Fox News. The governor said it was ''general knowledge'' that people in Russia had taken I.M.F. aid, but he raised the possibility that Mr. Chernomyrdin might have taken some other kind of aid money.</p>
        <p>''It might not have been; it might have been another aid,'' Mr. Bush said when asked if he had evidence to support his earlier accusation.</p>
        <p>Ari Fleischer, a spokesman, said that the I.M.F. had subsidized Russia's oil and gas sector, where Mr. Chernomyrdin exercised influence, and that after leaving the post of prime minister, he had served as an executive at the state-owned natural gas company. Mr. Chernomyrdin has been accused of profiting handsomely from ties with the gas company.</p>
