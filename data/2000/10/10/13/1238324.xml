        <p>A selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy Broadway and Off Broadway shows this weekend. Approximate running times are in parentheses. * denotes a highly recommended show.  + means discounted tickets were available at the Theater Development Fund's TKTS booth for performances last Friday and Saturday nights.  ++ means discounted tickets were available at the TKTS booth for last Friday night only.</p>
        <p>Broadway</p>
        <p>* ''CONTACT'' (Tony winner for best musical, choreography and featured actor and actress). The most potent antidepressant available in New York. Advertising has it that this show from the director and choreographer Susan Stroman is a ''dance play,'' but that hardly captures how it makes you feel. Aided by the dramatist John Weidman and a dream ensemble, Ms. Stroman has created the unthinkable: a sexy, polished work that restores the pleasure principle to the American musical. A theatrical portfolio of three seemingly un related vignettes set in different time periods, with top-drawer leading performances from Deborah Yates and the Tony winners Boyd Gaines and Karen Ziemba, ''Contact'' uses an ingeniously selected medley of recordings ranging from Bizet to the Beach Boys. But like a classic Rodgers and Hart musical it converts the messy daily ingredients of sexual attraction and conflict into something as smoothly sweet and tart as Key lime pie. Both the intoxication of love and the hangover of loneliness are given idealized, elegant form (2:00). Beaumont, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $55 and $85 (Ben Brantley).</p>

        <p>*+ ''COPENHAGEN'' (Tony winner for best play, director and featured actress). Who would ever have thought it: that three dead, long-winded people talking about atomic physics would be such electrifying companions? Michael Frayn's endlessly fascinating speculation on the ambiguity of human motives and the limits of scientific knowledge takes on a subject that would seem to have the sex appeal of a frozen flounder: a meeting in 1941 between the Danish physicist Niels Bohr (Philip Bosco) and Werner Heisenberg (Michael Cumpsty), his former protege and a German, during which no one, to this day, knows exactly what happened. Mr. Frayn turns the encounter among the men and Bohr's wife, Margrethe (the Tony-winning Blair Brown), into a wide-ranging, intensely emotional consideration of everything from quantum mechanics to the loss of a child, from the fate of the world in the atomic age to the nature of friendship. Under the meticulous direction of Michael Blakemore, with three fiercely passionate performances, the result is a most invigorating and ingenious play of ideas (2:20). Royale, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $40 to $65; $25 student rush at box office on day of performance (Brantley).</p>
        <p>+ ''GORE VIDAL'S 'THE BEST MAN.' '' Whatever the weaknesses of this unsteady revival, it makes you wish Mr. Vidal were writing the dialogue for the presidential debates. Despite the notoriously short shelf life of satire in the theater, this 1960 morality tale of a national political convention still rings with the whip cracks of abiding worldly wisdom dispensed in quips. At its best the play brings to the back-stabbing world of campaigning some of the fiery verbal artifice that the movies ''All About Eve'' and ''The Sweet Smell of Success'' brought to the back-stabbing worlds of show business and journalism. Unfortunately, what those movies have that this production does not is a rousing, melodramatic vigor. Led by Charles Durning, Spalding Gray and Christopher Noth, under the direction of Ethan McSweeney, the starry ensemble often feels frustratingly tentative. Despite fine work from Mr. Gray, Mr. Durning and Michael Learned, the show lacks the necessary conviction to be big (2:20). Virginia, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $45 to $75 (Brantley).</p>
        <p>*+ ''KISS ME, KATE'' (Tony winner for best musical revival, director of a musical, musical actor, costumes and orchestration). A mouthwatering revival, with ham as the plat du jour, of Cole Porter's sybarite's delight of a musical about battling egos in show business. As presented by a preening cast led by the wonderful Marin Mazzie and the Tony-winning Brian Stokes Mitchell, who wear a spotlight as if it were a dressing gown and vice versa, this ''Kate'' proves that ham can indeed make a banquet if the spices are zesty enough. Avoiding the attitudes that are anathema to lively revivals of vintage musicals -- reverence and condescension -- the director Michael Blakemore and the choreographer Kathleen Marshall have shaped a show that is broad, brazen and finally irresistible. The production, which doesn't seem to have a thought in its giddy head beyond entertaining us as much as it is entertaining itself, feels like one long ear-to-ear grin (2:20). Beck, 302 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $29 to $85 (Brantley).</p>
        <p>* ''PROOF.'' An exhilarating and assured new play by David Auburn that turns the esoteric world of higher mathematics literally into a back-porch drama, as accessible and compelling as a detective story. A mystery about the authorship of a particularly important proof, it is also about twin enigmas: genius and love. Without any baffling erudition the play presents mathematicians as both blessed and bedeviled by the gift for abstraction that ties them achingly to one another and separates them, also achingly, from concrete-minded folks like you and me. Perhaps most satisfying of all, it does so without a moment of meanness. Performed by an exemplary cast, most notably Mary-Louise Parker, the play reaches into the most competitive and difficult intellectual terrain and finds -- guess what? -- good people (2:00). Walter Kerr, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets, $24 to $69 (Bruce Weber).</p>
        <p>Off Broadway</p>
        <p>''ARABIAN NIGHTS.'' Oh, what wonders are to be beheld on the stage of the New Victory Theater: great hoards of gold and silver, a valley of diamonds, magical birds, ghouls, a wicked sorceress, men and women turned to stone and restored to life. Here are high adventure, low comedy, tales of peril and death and lessons to live by. The source of these wonders is the Young Vic Theater Company of London and its scintillating production of ''Arabian Nights,'' intended for audiences at least 7 years old. Adapted and directed by Dominic Cooke, this imaginative display of theater magic weaves its spell from rich strands of fine acting, riveting storytelling, music, dance, puppetry, design, lighting and costumes. Of course, the framing device for these enduring stories from ''Thousand and One Nights,'' also known as ''Arabian Nights,'' is the tale of the beautiful and brave young Scheherazade, who literally risks her neck for her despairing people after the sultan, embittered by his wife's infidelity, orders the beheading of each of her successors after a single night. With the women of the kingdom in terror, Scheherazade carries out a plan to so beguile the sultan with tales like ''Ali Baba and the 40 Thieves'' and ''Sinbad the Sailor'' that each morning he will postpone her execution. Much wisdom is to be found in ''Arabian Nights'' and much extraordinary entertainment (2:00) New Victory, 209 West 42nd Street, (212) 239-6200. Today and Wednesday through next Friday at 7 p.m.; tomorrow and next Saturday at 1 and 7 p.m.; Sunday and next Sunday at noon and 5 p.m. Through Oct. 22. Tickets, $10 to $25 (Lawrence Van Gelder).</p>
        <p>+  ''THE CRUMPLE ZONE.'' This new play by Buddy Thomas is uneven, but it has a lot going for it: a nicely structured plot about a gay household with a love triangle coming to crisis at Christmastime, sequences of physical comedy that are antic without being overblown into slapstick and an effective set that evokes a pleasantly chintzy apartment on Staten Island. Most of all, though, it has a bristling, funny performance by Mario Cantone, who plays the squeaky wheel, a clamorously lonely man on the outside of the triangle looking in. Mr. Cantone is known for his high-pitched stand-up comedy work, and he knows how to take over a room. In this case the room is a tiny apartment, but he works it as a diva would. He is the kind of actor who seems most in control when he's in a tizzy, with a voice that easily and naturally runs up to shrill. But this is not a shrill performance. Even in high dudgeon there's no tension in Mr. Cantone's face or his body language, just the wicked glee of a man who loves to seize the spotlight. The magnitude of his neurotic charisma in such a small space gives his character the hilariously keening pathos that makes the play work (2:00). Rattlestick, 224 Waverly Place, near West 11th Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 206-1515. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $39 and $45 (Weber).</p>
        <p>''IT AIN'T NOTHIN' BUT THE BLUES.'' This slick musical revue, a Tony nominee in 1999, has been slimmed down to a supper-club-brisk 80 minutes in its new cabaret home, but its strength remains in its high spirits and the marvelous voices on display. The six performers are the happiest blues singers you'll ever see -- it's thematic that the show begins and ends with ''Let the Good Times Roll'' -- and each brings a full throat and a flawless sense of pitch to standards like ''I'm Your Hoochie Coochie Man,'' ''I Put a Spell on You'' and ''I Can't Stop Lovin' You.'' Showbiz values keep things cheerful and the performers on a strict leash, and as a result longtime blues fans may miss the music's mordant spirit, its down and dirty heart. There's a blues-lite feel to the evening that wouldn't suit a roadhouse, but it's perfectly apt here: the blues for the new Times Square (1:20). B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200. Mondays and Tuesdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $50 (Weber).</p>
        <p>''LIFEGAME.'' The Improbable Theater, the inventive young British troupe that turned Scotch tape into ectoplasm in the haunted house play ''70 Hill Lane,'' is now turning instant biography into instant, multiform theater. This appealing show is based riskily on the classic premises that everyone has a story to tell and that no examined life is truly boring. Each evening a pre-selected volunteer is brought onstage and asked basic biographical questions. The answers are quickly turned into vignettes by the seven-member ensemble. The result is less Jerry Springer than Federico Fellini; that is, as in the later, warmer memory films of Fellini, like ''Amarcord,'' in which childhood recollections are recreated with both comic flourish and deep wistfulness. The overall effect is of a glowing gentleness, of curiosity coupled with respect. Any dry or awkward spots are easily overridden by your feelings of suspense and good will for the people onstage. (2:00). Jane Street Theater, 113 Jane Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 239-6200. Tuesday , Wednesday, Thursday and Friday at 8 p.m.; Saturday at 5 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 3 and 7 p.m. Tickets, $25 to $37.50 (Brantley).</p>
        <p>+ ''THE SYRINGA TREE.'' Because Pamela Gien plays most of the show in the persona of a little girl, she may try your patience. But it's a risk she takes willfully, and the payoff is a thoroughly persuasive transport to a time and a place. Most in the audience will be as innocent of the experience of living under apartheid as young Elizabeth is; that, of course, is the idea behind Ms. Gien's narrative strategy. And as we witness the evocation of a society where cruelty is both legislated and psychologically ingrained, the effect is deeply shocking. The indignities perpetrated on the blacks in Elizabeth's world, not to mention the genuine terrors that apartheid brings about -- among other things, a baby mysteriously and carelessly disappears from a hospital, and Elizabeth's grandparents are murdered -- may be disclosed obliquely, through the uncomprehending vision of a child, but they stun with the power of a gut punch. (1:30). Playhouse 91, 316 East 91st Street, (212) 307-4100. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets, $47.50 (Weber).</p>
        <p>Last Chance</p>
        <p>++ ''THE BUTTERFLY COLLECTION.'' Father and son, novelist and actor, both willing to betray their significant others out of lust for the same young woman, are twin villains, their testosterone-fueled rivalry portrayed as a cruel force that humiliates nicer people -- i.e., women -- and churns up a family like a cyclone in a barnyard. ''Why is it always about the man?'' the young sex object wails at one point, giving literal voice to the complaint that the play itself seeks to avenge. This is a play about the men, all right, and the playwright gives it to them good. Paul, the father, and his son, Ethan, are such awful guys in such predictably awful ways that if this weren't a contemporary domestic drama set in Connecticut, they'd be wearing black hats (2:30). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, (212) 279-4200. Through Sunday. Today at 8 p.m.; tomorrow at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 3 and 7:30 p.m. Tickets: $40 (Weber).</p>
