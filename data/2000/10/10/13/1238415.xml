        <p>Seattle Mariners pitcher Aaron Sele will start third game of American League Championship Series against New York Yankees (M)</p>

        <p>Aaron Sele's voice failed to crack or to reveal any emotion about his dark past against the Yankees. Calm and confident, Sele sounded as though he was again taking the mound for North Kitsap High School instead of pitching in the American League Championship Series against a team that has mostly dominated him.</p>
        <p>Indeed, Sele will be on familiar ground at Safeco Field when he starts Game 3 for the Seattle Mariners. He grew up in Poulsbo, Wash., a short ferry ride from Seattle across Puget Sound, and later played at Washington State University. His history also includes a career 4-8 record and a 4.34 earned run average against the Yankees, who particularly enjoy feasting on his curveball and a fastball that occasionally hits 90 miles and hour.</p>

        <p>Aaron Sele's voice failed to crack or to reveal any emotion about his dark past against the Yankees. Calm and confident, Sele sounded as though he was again taking the mound for North Kitsap High School instead of pitching in the American League Championship Series against a team that has mostly dominated him.</p>
        <p>Indeed, Sele will be on familiar ground at Safeco Field when he starts Game 3 for the Seattle Mariners. He grew up in Poulsbo, Wash., a short ferry ride from Seattle across Puget Sound, and later played at Washington State University. His history also includes a career 4-8 record and a 4.34 earned run average against the Yankees, who particularly enjoy feasting on his curveball and a fastball that occasionally hits 90 miles and hour.</p>
        <p>''I don't think there's anybody in particular that performs well against them,'' Sele, a 30-year-old right-hander, said today.</p>
        <p>''They have quality hitters from top to bottom, and you're always making adjustments whether it is during the regular season or the postseason. You just have to see how the guys have reacted to your pitches before, what you've had success with against them, and what they've done to be successful against you.''</p>
        <p>Sele has a bone-dry well of playoff success from which to draw on Friday night. As a pitcher for the Texas Rangers, he faced the Yankees in the 1998 and the 1999 A.L. division series and couldn't get past the sixth inning either time.</p>
        <p>In 1998, Sele was rocked for four runs on eight hits and was pulled after six innings. The next year he lasted five innings as the Yankees scored four runs on six hits.</p>
        <p>This season wasn't forgiving for Sele against the Yankees, either. On Aug. 30, he pitched only three and two-thirds innings and allowed four runs on six hits in a 5-4 loss. On Aug. 5, Sele lasted five and two-thirds innings and gave up two runs on six hits, but was not the pitcher of record. Paul O'Neill. Bernie Williams. Derek Jeter. David Justice. Chuck Knoblauch. All of them have hit .281 or better against Sele during their careers.</p>
        <p>Sele shrugged at the thought that the Yankees owned him. Familiarity, he suggested, often breeds extra base hits, especially against the defending World Series champions.</p>
        <p>''At this point, I've been facing these guys for eight years now. They know what I throw and how I throw it,'' Sele said.</p>
        <p>''I know what most of them like to do. It's just a matter of going out and  executing pitches. If you can execute quality pitches, then most of the time you'll get positive results. But then again, big-leaguers hit quality pitches, too. I'll take my chances on that.''</p>
        <p>Facing Sele could certainly be a slump-busting proposition for Paul O'Neill, who's hitting .160 in this postseason. O'Neill leads the Yankees with a .326 average against Sele. He is followed by Knoblauch at .317,  Williams at .310 and Jeter (.281). Justice has only 24 at-bats but has eight hits, including one each of the last four times he has batted against Sele.</p>
        <p>Still, Yankees Manager Joe Torre dismissed the notion that his hitters have any significant edge against Sele, who Torre chose as an All-Star this season.</p>
        <p>''I don't have any reason to believe he's going to pitch any different just  because he hasn't won in the postseason,'' Torre said. ''He has good, sufficient stuff.''</p>
