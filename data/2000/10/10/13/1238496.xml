        <p>HE was prowling the dugout, gripping the bat, waiting for the moment that, as it happened, would never quite come: the moment when he'd truly have a chance to, once again, tour the bases in triumph. Instead, Mark McGwire got into the game but was rendered powerless, as though someone had ripped off Superman's cape.</p>
        <p>The Mets would beat the Cardinals, 6-5, last night. The victory gave the Mets a 2-0 lead in their National League Championship Series, and gave the Cardinals a migraine.</p>
        <p>Return briefly, though, to the previous night, when John Stearns exclaimed: ''The monster's out of the cage! The monster's out of the cage!''</p>
        <p>The Mets' coach wasn't about to flee. He was delighted. Mike Piazza had just doubled against the Cardinals in the first inning of the opening game of the series. He had been having a rough go of it lately, but this hit may have been a sign that he was emerging from his lassitude. And last night, Piazza homered.</p>
        <p>On the other side of the field, however, the St. Louis monster, to extend the woolly metaphor, was still in his cage. When you looked into the Cardinals' dugout, you noticed a man built like Popeye or King Kong, depending on your angle, and concentrating intently on the game while blowing bubbles with his gum.</p>
        <p>Mark McGwire, who makes baseballs disappear faster than anyone in memory except David Copperfield, roams the dugout, waiting for a moment when he will be unleashed as a pinch-hitter. He sustained tendinitis in his right knee in early July, was put on the disabled list -- he had hit 30 homers and had a chance to challenge his single-season record of 70 home runs -- and didn't return until September, still unable to play first base, and still hobbled, but fit enough to pinch-hit.</p>
        <p>''He's the most dangerous pinch-hitter in history,'' Tony LaRussa, the Cardinals' manager, said before Game 2 yesterday.</p>
        <p>''It's a whole X-factor,'' Bobby Valentine, the Mets' manager, had said. ''I suspect that he will be used for that one at-bat that could give them an advantage offensively. He is, without doubt, a force.''</p>
        <p>Up on a board in deep right-center field is a listing of the greatest home run hitters, with Henry Aaron and Babe Ruth and Willie Mays at the top, and Mark McGwire, the lone active player, seventh, at 554 homers, 9 behind Reggie Jackson. And La Russa is wracking his nimble brain, deciding, ''Should I use him now or later?'' When should he release his awesome weapon?</p>
        <p>In Game 1, there were some moments when McGwire might have been sent in to hit, but La Russa decided, ''No, not now.'' McGwire was, said La Russa, ''primed.'' From the fifth inning on, McGwire gets his muscles ready. He stretches, hits a baseball off a tee into a net in the runway behind the dugout. And he scrutinizes the pitchers. ''He's thinking,'' said the Cardinals' hitting coach, Mike Easler. ''He's not just a big, strong, brute hitter.''</p>
        <p>When McGwire returned to action in September, he made a handful of appearances as a pinch-hitter. He got three hits, including a game-winning homer. In the N.L. division series against the Braves, he pinch-hit twice, walking once and homering once.</p>
        <p>Then, in the eighth inning last night, the Cardinals staged a rally, scoring one run, to bring them within one, 5-4. Two were out and St. Louis had a runner on second. The Mets replaced pitcher John Franco. Where was McGwire? On the bench, gripping a bat.</p>
        <p>La Russa decided, no, not yet. He sent Placido Polanco to pinch-hit. Then the Mets switched pitchers, bringing in Turk Wendell. Then La Russa switched pinch-hitters, replacing Polanco with J. D. Drew! Still, no McGwire! There was so much thinking going on by the managers.</p>
        <p>While the sellout crowed of 52,250 nearly gasped with disappointment when McGwire didn't bat, they were screaming with joy when Drew doubled to drive in Clark and tie the score. Now, just like that guy from Mudville, McGwire strode to the plate to hit for the pitcher, Dave Veres. The fans went bonkers.</p>
        <p>This was theater at its finest. The ballpark was dripping with drama. This was last scene of Hamlet, Macbeth and King Lear rolled into one. And what does the director do at this most gripping moment? He sends someone on stage to do the old soft-shoe. Valentine has McGwire walked intentionally! Casey -- er, McGwire -- takes the four pitches and has the decency to exit left, giving way to a pinch-runner.</p>
        <p>Sorry, but the rest -- the Mets scoring the winning run in the ninth -- was sweet, but as they say on the Great White Way, anti-climactic.</p>
