        <p>David Cone of New York Yankees expresses hope that he will get chance to pitch against Seattle Mariners in American League Championship Series (M)</p>

        <p>David Cone warmed up in the bullpen on Tuesday night, late in Game 1 of the American League Championship Series. The rookie Randy Choate was pitching, and as Jason Grimsley threw from one mound in the home bullpen, Cone got up and started throwing from the other one.</p>
        <p>Cone continued to throw after Grimsley went into the game, preparing to pitch just in case Grimsley's elbow problems manifested themselves, and he could not throw a strike. But Grimsley was fine and Cone did not get in the game.</p>

        <p>David Cone warmed up in the bullpen on Tuesday night, late in Game 1 of the American League Championship Series. The rookie Randy Choate was pitching, and as Jason Grimsley threw from one mound in the home bullpen, Cone got up and started throwing from the other one.</p>
        <p>Cone continued to throw after Grimsley went into the game, preparing to pitch just in case Grimsley's elbow problems manifested themselves, and he could not throw a strike. But Grimsley was fine and Cone did not get in the game.</p>
        <p>More than one round into the playoffs, and Cone has not pitched. ''I'm still looking for that chance,'' Cone said today, ''that might not ever come.''</p>
        <p>There was an established pitcher in a situation similar to that of Cone in 1929. Howard Ehmke of the Philadelphia Athletics was 35 years old and nearing the end of a career in which he won 166 games. The Athletics were in the process of winning the American League pennant and Ehmke asked the Philadelphia manager, Connie Mack, for a chance to pitch in the World Series. As the story goes, he told Mack that he had one more good game left in his arm.</p>
        <p>Mack sent Ehmke to clandestinely scout the Chicago Cubs, who would be the National League champions, and Mack surprised everybody by bypassing star pitchers like George Earnshaw and Lefty Grove to tab Ehmke as his Game 1 starter in the World Series. Ehmke pitched a complete game and got the victory while striking out 13.</p>
        <p>A Different Place</p>
        <p>The lasting images of the 1995 playoff series between the Mariners and the Yankees was Edgar Martinez pinballing a line drive into the corner of the Kingdome, Ken Griffey sprinting around the bases and scoring with a slide, and the Yankees finally succumbing in a stadium where runs came cheaply.</p>
        <p>But Safeco Field is much, much different, with wide open spaces in the power alleys, the fences remote from home plate. The Mariners moved from a sluggers' paradise in the Kingdome to a place that favors pitchers, making for a far different kind of game.</p>
        <p>''The Kingdome, it's really an offensive nightmare,'' said Lou Piniella, the Seattle manager. ''You could score runs over there very, very quickly. The ball traveled well, and you had the Astroturf. At the same time, you had that short porch in right field, where hitters would hit it almost like they do in Fenway Park.</p>
        <p>''If you can get the lead and add a run here, add a run there, they mean a heck of a lot, whereas in the Kingdome, one run didn't mean all that much.''</p>
        <p>Reds Interested in Randolph</p>
        <p>The Cincinnati Reds have asked for permission to speak with Willie Randolph, the Yankees' third-base coach, about their managerial opening.</p>
        <p>Randolph and the Yankees' hitting coach, Chris Chambliss, are each being considered for multiple openings -- Randolph by the Philadelphia Phillies, the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Reds, and Chambliss by the Arizona Diamondbacks and the Los Angeles Dodgers.</p>
        <p>Torre Is Undecided</p>
        <p>Yankees Manager Joe Torre has not decided who will pitch Game 5, and he said today that he would wait to make that choice. He could start Denny Neagle, who pitched effectively in Game 1, and give his other three starters a chance to work with full rest.</p>
        <p>Torre will also have the option of starting Orlando Hernandez on three days' rest in Game 5, which he may be more compelled to do if the situation is particularly dire -- if the Yankees trail, three games to one, for example, or maybe even if the series is tied at 2-2.</p>
        <p>If Torre uses Hernandez on three days' rest in Game 5, he will probably bring back Andy Pettitte on three days' rest in Game 6 and Roger Clemens on three days' rest in Game 7; and neither Pettitte nor Clemens responded well in the last round of the playoffs while pitching on shortened rest.</p>
        <p>Pettitte will pitch on four days' rest in Game 3.</p>
        <p>''I feel good,'' Pettitte said. ''This extra day, instead of going on three days and getting my full rest here. Physically, I'm feeling a lot better.''</p>
