        <p>For proper young women without fortunes, Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy certainly seem to get around. They have been through Hollywood more than once, they are supposed to arrive on Broadway soon, and right now they are appearing in Queens.</p>

        <p>For proper young women without fortunes, Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy certainly seem to get around. They have been through Hollywood more than once, they are supposed to arrive on Broadway soon, and right now they are appearing in Queens.</p>
        <p>The location is Queens Theater in the Park, where ''A Lady Named Jo'' (not the production destined for Broadway) is in the midst of a three-week run. An intimate musical, this latest adaptation of Louisa May Alcott's ''Little Women'' is well suited to the 99-seat lower-level Studio Theater, where the members of the audience feel as if they were guests in the March family's parlor.</p>
        <p>Ben Finn and Peter John Stephens, the co-authors of the musical's book, have wisely focused on Jo, the March daughter most appealing to modern theatergoers: a feisty tomboy with literary ambitions and suffragist sympathies. ''I wish I had been born a boy,'' she sings lustily.</p>
        <p>If this play took place in the 21st century, she might opt for transgender surgery and a life among the downtown avant-garde. But this being the 1860's, Jo only goes so far as New York, where she takes a job as a governess and falls in love with a man, albeit a much older one, who encourages her desires to become a writer. As the musical's title implies, she even becomes a lady, although not the delicate kind who dies young (with all due respect to Beth).</p>
        <p>Running just over two hours including an intermission, ''A Lady Named Jo'' is not for small children. Although Miriam Fond, the director, has introduced almost a surfeit of horseplay, there is no way to make a ''Little Women'' adaptation action-filled, short of moving it onto a Civil War battlefield.</p>
        <p>Children over 8 or 9, however, should enjoy the drawing-room dramas. Mr. Finn has written some lovely melodies, and the young actresses in the lead roles -- Kerri Lynn Jennings (Jo), Stephanie Gray (Meg), Karen Rockower (Beth) and Sarah Laue (Amy) -- manage to give these little women considerable stature.</p>
        <p>''A Lady Named Jo,'' through Oct. 22 at Queens Theater in the Park, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, Exit 9E off the Grand Central Parkway, (718) 760-0044. Shows: Saturdays at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m.; Oct. 18 and 19 at 2:30 p.m. Tickets: $12; members, $10.</p>
        <p>Having a Ball</p>
        <p>It wasn't so long ago that the objects floating in the Bronx River weren't subjects for polite conversation, much less celebration. But a lot has changed in the last two and a half years, and tomorrow the river will carry a piece of gold, bearing it to a destination appropriately festive.</p>
        <p>The treasure is the Bronx River Golden Ball, a sphere nearly three feet in diameter, covered in gold leaf. Created by the artists Mags Harries and Lajos Heder, the ball represents the sun as well as the energy and spirit of the river. Beginning at 9 a.m. volunteers in a boat will float the ball down the water from a point in Shoelace Park at 219th Street in Gun Hill, the Bronx. Between noon and 1 p.m. the ball will arrive in Starlight Park, where a festival will commemorate the efforts of the city Parks Department and Bronx community groups to clean up the river and make it safe for recreation.</p>
        <p>The ball's first symbolic voyage was in April 1999, and the organizations involved ''hope to do it once a year, to show what progress has been made,'' said Charles Rice-Gonzalez, a spokesman for the festival.</p>
        <p>The park activities will include dances by Contemporary Ballet Theater; performances by UPStage, a youth theater ensemble; lots of Latin jazz; and face painting. Most important, the festival will feature family canoe rides and fishing trips, ''all things that could never have been done on the Bronx River two years ago,'' Mr. Rice-Gonzalez said.</p>
        <p>Bronx River Golden Ball Celebration 2000, tomorrow from noon to 4 p.m. at Starlight Park, between 172nd and 174th Streets, West Farms, the Bronx. Free. Information: (718) 542-0267.</p>
        <p>Winged Victories</p>
        <p>New Yorkers have good reason to worry about what's hovering over their heads. Tomorrow afternoon, though, at least on the Great Lawn of Central Park, they can rejoice in the city's aerial inhabitants rather than fear them. There the dominant birds will be raptors, and any pigeons with instincts for self-preservation would do well to stay at home.</p>
        <p>The lawn will be the scene for the Urban Park Rangers' third annual Falconry Extravaganza, which is to include speeches, nature exhibits and some spectacular sky diving by birds like falcons and kestrels.</p>
        <p>''It's all about flying the birds and letting people see how incredibly amazing these animals are,'' said Michele Lariviere, a sergeant with the Rangers.</p>
        <p>Among the guests will be Parks Commissioner Henry J. Stern; Dr. Paul Kerlinger, the former director of the Cape May Bird Observatory, who will explain migration; and Enkhsaikhan Jargalsaikhany, Mongolia's ambassador to the United Nations, who will discuss endangered wildlife in Mongolia.</p>
        <p>The real stars, though, will be the birds, which will also include screech owls and Veedor, ''the world's only tame, free-flying Andean condor,'' Ms. Lariviere said.</p>
        <p>The event will kick off the Urban Park Rangers' Hawk Watch, a quest to spot migratory raptors. So if you miss tomorrow's festivities, don't worry: the creatures should be passing through until January.</p>
        <p>Falconry Extravaganza, tomorrow from 1 to 4 p.m. on the Great Lawn, Central Park (enter at 81st Street and Central Park West). Free. Information: (888) 697-2757.</p>
