        <p>A selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy pop and jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert.</p>
        <p>BERNARD ALLISON, CHRIS DUARTE, B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42d Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144. Bernard Allison, the son of the bluesman Luther Allison, updates his father's Chicago blues with dollops of funk and soul, and he knows how to work his wah-wah pedal. Chris Duarte plays Texas roadhouse rock along the lines of Stevie Ray Vaughan, with an aggressive, well-fuzzed guitar tone. His repertory holds slow blues, fast shuffles and expansive songs that give psychedelia a Texas drawl. Tonight at 8 and 10:30; admission is $30 (Jon Pareles).</p>

        <p>A selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy pop and jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert.</p>
        <p>BERNARD ALLISON, CHRIS DUARTE, B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42d Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144. Bernard Allison, the son of the bluesman Luther Allison, updates his father's Chicago blues with dollops of funk and soul, and he knows how to work his wah-wah pedal. Chris Duarte plays Texas roadhouse rock along the lines of Stevie Ray Vaughan, with an aggressive, well-fuzzed guitar tone. His repertory holds slow blues, fast shuffles and expansive songs that give psychedelia a Texas drawl. Tonight at 8 and 10:30; admission is $30 (Jon Pareles).</p>
        <p>* FRED ANDERSON, KIDD JORDAN ET AL., Society for Ethical Culture, 2 West 64th Street, Manhattan, (212) 874-5210. Mr. Anderson, a hometown fixture and jazz hero in Chicago, where he runs the jam sessions at the Velvet Lounge on the South Side and participates on tenor saxophone as an eminence grise in some of the young free-improvisation bands, isn't often seen in New York. He is a founding member of the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians but never found his way into one of the organization's more popular groups; he is in the middle of a late-career bloom. Here he'll be playing in a special quartet with the saxophonist Kidd Jordan, the bassist Elton Heron and the drummer Alvin Fielder. Mr. Anderson's style is heavy, wooly and visceral, about sound and texture more than melody, and his frontline pairings with the lighter-toned alto saxophonist Mr. Jordan -- one of them recently documented on ''Two Days in April'' (Eremite) -- have been effective. Tomorrow at 8 p.m.; tickets are $15 (Ben Ratliff).</p>
        <p>KEVIN AVIANCE, Fez, 380 Lafayette Street, at Great Jones Street, East Village, (212) 533-2680. What will Kevin Aviance, the drag-wearing dance diva behind hits like ''Din Da Da,'' do in this cabaret setting? It's unclear, but whatever he decides he will certainly sound and look glamorous while doing it. Sunday at 10 p.m.; admission is $12 (Ann Powers).</p>
        <p>KENNY BARRON TRIO, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 255-4037. Mr. Barron, the pianist, is one of the great utility musicians in jazz. Now that he is working with Sphere, his own trio gigs have become slightly rare. Sets through Sunday night are at 9:30 and 11:30, with a 1 a.m. set tomorrow night; cover charge is $20 on weekends; $15 on Sunday; $10 minimum (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>* BOMPLENAZO 2000, Hostos Center for the Arts and Culture, Hostos Community College, 450 Grand Concourse, at 149th Street, Mott Haven, the Bronx (718) 518-4455. It's a celebration of Puerto Rican music and dance, centered on the island's two great traditional dance-music styles, with their own instrumentation and rhythms: bomba (much older, with its roots in Africa, and distinguished by barrel drums) and plena (about a century old, and featuring the shallow, jingleless tambourines called panderos). Tonight there's a concert with three generations of the Cepeda family of musicians, as well as the neobomba and plena band Viento de Agua, which mixes the forms with rap and Cuban timba. Tomorrow the featured band is Los Pleneros de la 21, the foremost New York-based bomba and plena band; opening is the excellent Latin jazz trombonist Papo Vasquez and his group Piratas y Trobadores. Both shows start at 7:30 p.m.; admission is $10 or $12 (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>RAY BROWN, Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-0049. Mr. Brown, the bassist, has one of the best resumes in all of jazz: participation in some of the most important bebop sessions and long periods spent with Ella Fitzgerald and Oscar Peterson. His small group presents the sound of jazz as well drilled as it comes. Each piece operates around a strong, simple arranging idea; in his 70's, Mr. Brown is still one of the best musicians out there. His notes are shapely -- fat and round and well defined -- and his rhythm is so propelling that on uptempo pieces his eighth-notes are always blowing wind into the music. Sets through Sunday night are at 9 and 11:30; cover charge is $35; one-drink minimum (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>* CANNANES, Fez, 380 Lafayette Street, at Great Jones Street, East Village, (212) 533-2680. The Cannanes are a loose collective of Sydney-based musicians who are also busy people: the band's members have included an oceanographer, a lawyer, a maker of steel-welded furniture, an activist working to give land back to Australia's aborigines and the author of a tome on another Aussie cult band, the Go-Betweens. When they're not being real complicated people, these folks make utterly poignant, funny pop. Catch this rare appearance. Sharing the bill are the Pacific Ocean, Even As We Speak and Steward. Tomorrow at 8 p.m; admission is $10 (Powers).</p>
        <p>CLEM SNIDE, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501. Eef Barzelay and his mates continue their swooning path through dreams of Americana on Clem Snide's latest release, ''Your Favorite Music'' (Sire Records). Aficionados of drowsy pop particularly like the band's cover of the Ritchie Valens classic ''Donna.'' Tomorrow night at midnight; admission is $5 (Powers).</p>
        <p>HANK CRAWFORD, JIMMY McGRIFF, Bottom Line, 15 West Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 228-7880. Mr. Crawford, the alto saxophonist who was part of Ray Charles's mighty band of the early 1960's, made some of his own fine records on Atlantic. Here he is paired with Mr. McGriff, the organist who is a patron saint of the ever-renewing groove scene. Tomorrow at 7:30 and 10:30 p.m.; admission is $22.50 (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>* MARTY EHRLICH'S DARK WOODS ENSEMBLE, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501. Of the several bands led by Mr. Ehrlich, the reed player, this is the quietest and most dramatic: it has an elegiac mood, a pronounced low end (cello and two double-basses are at the core of the band, along with Mr. Ehrlich on clarinet) and no drums. Tomorrow at 10 p.m.; admission is $10 (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>FUNKY METERS, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Union Square, (212) 777-6800. The Funky Meters include Art Neville on keyboards and George Porter Jr. on bass from the Meters, the band that was the cornerstone of New Orleans funk. With Russell Batiste Jr. on drums, they still set up grooves and syncopations that carry every hip into irresistible motion. Tomorrow at 7:30 p.m. and midnight (with the Fred Jacobs Jazz Odyssey opening) and midnight (with Santa's Boyfriend opening); tickets are $25 in advance, $28 tomorrow. (Pareles).</p>
        <p>* LOUIS HAYES, Sweet Basil, 88 Seventh Avenue South, above Bleecker Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 242-1785. You've heard Mr. Hayes, the drummer, if you own a few Lee Morgan or Horace Silver albums from the 1950's and 60's. He leads one of the better hard-bop bands in town, but this gig presents a totally different lineup, including the seldom-heard trumpeter Charles Tolliver. Sets through Sunday night are at 9 and 11, with a 12:30 a.m. set tonight and tomorrow night; cover charge is $25; $10 minimum (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>EDDIE HENDERSON QUINTET, Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, (212) 864-6662. The trumpeter's hard-bitten attack keeps sounding better and better in this band, which has been together long enough to have a nice, intuitive flexibility. Sets are tonight and tomorrow night at 9, 11 and 12:30; cover charge is $15; two-drink minimum (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>* FLACO JIMENEZ, Lehman Center for the Performing Arts, 250 Bedford Park Boulevard West, at Goulden Avenue, Bedfod Park, the Bronx, (718) 960-8833. Flaco Jimenez is the best-known accordionist in norteno (or Tex-Mex) music, and deservedly so. Through waltzes and cumbias, polkas and boleros, his accordion lines scamper and stutter and leap, whether he's singing about a party or a broken heart. It's part of a low-priced concert series at Lehman College. Sunday at 2 p.m.; tickets are $2 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>* THE JOHN DOE THING, MARY LOU LORD, Mercury Lounge, 217 Houston Street, at Essex Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700. The sweetness that John Doe taps in his latest step away from the legendary band, X, sheds perspective on his gritty view of life. In X, he may have been a definitive punk, but he also wanted to be a great country singer. He is firmly headed in that direction with his appealing new songs. Mary Lou Lord is a singer and songwriter tough enough to break out her guitar and busk for coins wherever she sees fit, but she also offers delightful, intimate insights into love and limitation. Plus, she is an expert interpreter of the underground rock songbook. With Matt Nathanson. Tonight at 8:30; tickets are $12 (Powers).</p>
        <p>DAVID KRAKAUER'S KLEZMER MADNESS, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501. In a club that used to be the cellar of a kosher winery, the clarinetist David Krakauer, who splits his career between classical music and improvisatory styles including klezmer, updates klezmer music to reflect present-day New York City. Sunday at 1:30 and 3 p.m.; admission is $10 a set; $15 for both. (Pareles).</p>
        <p>* CHRIS LIGHTCAP QUARTET, Knitting Factory Old Office, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006. A well-rounded young bassist, Mr. Lightcap leads a two-tenor band that gets ferocious in its free-jazz-with-motifs style; luckily, both tenor saxophonists, Tony Malaby and Bill McHenry, are musicians with more to offer than pure energy. The band's first record, ''Lay-Up'' (Fresh Sound), is one of the year's winners. Sets tonight and tomorrow night are at 8 and 9:30; cover charge is $8 with a one-drink minimum (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>RUSSELL MALONE QUARTET, Brooklyn Conservatory of Music, 58 Seventh Avenue, near St. John's Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 622-3300. A lot of people heard Russell Malone play during his tenure as the guitarist with Diana Krall's trio and he has always been pretty stunning, reeling off rapid, elegantly virtuosic guitar solos. He is a commanding performer. His group includes the pianist Joe McKean, the bassist Richie Goods and drummer Ed Strickland. Tomorrow at 8 p.m.; admission is $20, or $15 for students and the elderly (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>* NADER-LaDUKE BENEFIT CONCERT, Madison Square Garden, Seventh Avenue at 33d Street, Manhattan, (212) 465-6741. Independent-minded artists turn out to support the third-party candidate who is fighting to join the debates with Al Gore and George W. Bush. Ralph Nader and his running mate, Winona LaDuke, will stump, but music fans may be equally excited by a rare acoustic performance by Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam and sets by Ani DiFranco and Ben Harper. Also rallying will be the actors Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins, the comedian Bill Murray and the filmmaker Michael Moore. Phil Donahue is the M.C. The event is general admission, which is an interesting experiment for the Garden; come early for the best view. Tonight at 8; admission is $20 (Powers).</p>
        <p>PERE UBU, SUE GARNER AND RICK BROWN, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006. Pere Ubu has been raising a ruckus since the mid-1970's, when it defined the avant-gardist edge of what would soon be called punk-rock. Its songs sputter, twang and lurch behind David Thomas's grandly idiosyncratic vocals, which are spoken, sung or sliding in between. As Pere Ubu creeps up on a quarter-century of existence, it's still thoroughly unpredictable. Sue Garner and Rick Brown have been mainstays of New York's avant-rock, touching on punk, country and broad territories in and around them. Tomorrow at 9 p.m.; admission is $15 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>NASHVILLE PUSSY, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700. These rising stars of shock-rock lost a major asset when their fire-breathing bassist, Corey Parks, departed for  a solo career and a possible jump to the wrestling circuit. The band has soldiered on, however, with a new exhibitionist, Tracy Almazon, on bass and the same old nasty attitude. If you like your rock obnoxious, you'll dig this band. Toilet Boys, a New York punk outfit, opens these shows, along with Supagroup tonight and Bottom Saturday. Tomorrow at 8 p.m.; admission is $15 (Powers).</p>
        <p>TARA JANE O'NEILL, TARA KEY, TIM HARRIS, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7503. Tim Harris and Tara Key, partners in life and in the band Antietam, collaborate with one-half of the winsome duo Retsin. Electronic tinkering may be involved, but one hopes Ms. Key will play a little kick-out-the-jams guitar. Opening this unusual set will be Chris Brokaw, who has been a guitarist and a drummer in too many bands to mention. Sunday at 8 p.m.; admission is $8 (Powers).</p>
        <p>ELLIOTT SHARP AND TERRAPLANE, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006. Named after a Robert Johnson song that was named after a car, Elliott Sharp's Terraplane is the avant-rock composer's blues outlet and naturally he does things a little differently. He plays various guitar, steel guitar and tenor saxophone with a group including Sim Cain on drums, Dave Hofstra on bass and tuba and Eric Mingus and Dean Bowman as guest singers. Tonight at 8; admission is $12 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>GEORGE SHEARING QUINTET, Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080. George Shearing at 80 isn't a far throw from George Shearing at 35. The structure of his quintet's sound, with guitar and vibraphone quadrupling melody lines that are already doubled by his parallel-hands style on the piano, is as light and sturdy as ever. Sets are tonight and tomorrow night at 9 and 11; cover charge is $40; $10 minimum (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>ANDY SUMMERS, Iridium, 48 West 63rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 582-2121. Mr. Summers, the guitarist, followed his job in the Police with a dive into his area of interest, jazz; he has become one of the pickers who come together at Charles Carlini's special JVC Festival guitar concerts each summer, and he has started to put out albums that reflect his interest in Mingus and Monk, among others. Sets are tonight through Sunday night at 8:30 and 10:30; tonight and tomorrow night there is also a midnight set; cover charge is $30; $10 minimum (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>* UPPER CRUST, JAYNE COUNTY, LAIKA AND THE COSMONAUTS, Brownie's, 169 Avenue A, between 10th and 11th Streets, East Village, (212) 420-8392. This show presents punk in all its gleefully aggressive weirdness, with the star coming in the middle of the bill. Jayne County, the last of Andy Warhol's Superstars and possibly the first transgender liberationist, still crosses lines of propriety at 53 with her glorious glam-rock noise. She shares space with the Upper Crust, the wigged purveyors of garage rock, and Laika and the Cosmonauts, Finland's greatest surf band. But none will rival sweet Jayne for the spotlight. Tomorrow at 9 p.m.; tickets are $12 (Powers).</p>
        <p>MIKE WATT AND THE PAIR OF PLIERS, Mercury Lounge, 217 Houston Street, at Essex Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700. The philosopher king of American indie rock recently survived emergency groin surgery, and on his Web site he has been complaining about having to wear underwear while playing bass. Reports from this tour with his latest power trio, however, allay any fears that Mr. Watt's personal constriction might dim the musical din. An additional treat for California punk aficionados: this group includes Tom Watson, the guitarist who made such fine fractured music with the band Slovenly. The excellent band Cobra Verde opens tomorrow's show. Tomorrow and Sunday at 9:30 p.m.; tickets are $12 (Powers).</p>
        <p>VICTORIA WILLIAMS, Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 539-8777. Victoria Williams, from Louisiana, moves from sun-dappled childhood memories to musings on age and mortality; she also dips into pop standards. With her sweet, cracked, quizzical voice and timing so leisurely it's almost otherworldly, she finds new private longings in the most familiar songs. She has recorded some homemade albums with her husband, Mark Olson, formerly of the Jayhawks, as the Original Harmony Ridge Creek Dippers, and he'll be joining her, perhaps to sing about his grandmother. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:30; admission is $25 (Pareles).</p>
