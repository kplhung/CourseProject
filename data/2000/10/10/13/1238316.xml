      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>TOM TOM CLUB: ''The Good, the Bad and the Funky'' (Rykodisc). The female bass player is a fixture in countless punk and indie bands. But the stereotypical role owes its existence to real pioneers, especially Tina Weymouth of the Talking Heads and the Tom Tom Club.</p>
        <p>A wicked funk groovemaker who, along with her husband, the drummer Chris Frantz, has created some of the most sampled bottom lines in hip-hop, Ms. Weymouth always projects the friendly cool of someone breaking barriers for fun. Pleasure is the point of the Tom Tom Club, and in its fifth album the group delivers plenty. Charles Pettigrew, Mystic Bowie and Toots Hibbert aid Ms. Weymouth in adding spice to the rhythmic curry of reggae, James Brown throwdowns and smooth soul.</p>

        <p>SARA LEE: ''Make it Beautiful'' (Righteous Babe). Sara Lee, another pioneering bassist, also enlists many notable friends for her solo debut. Lyricists include Ms. Lee's sometime employers Ani Di Franco and Emily Saliers of the Indigo Girls. Yet ''Make it Beautiful'' has the solitary feel of a personal breakthrough. Ms. Lee's vocal reserve complements her delicate playing on songs that stimulate reflection as well as dancing. Like the joyful Tom Tom Club, Ms. Lee plants her ideas in the rich rhythm beds of disco and New Wave. Both albums look backward to go forward.</p>
