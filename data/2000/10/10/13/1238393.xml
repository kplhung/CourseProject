        <p>LONG ago, back when a husband might refer to his wife as the little woman, there was a joke about who wore the pants (another quaint phrase from that era) in the typical American household. A couple sitting on the front porch is asked who makes the family's decisions.</p>
        <p>''I do,'' the husband proclaims. ''I decide how we vote in every election. You name an issue -- local politics, national defense, the economy, foreign policy -- and I'll tell you where we stand.''</p>

        <p>LONG ago, back when a husband might refer to his wife as the little woman, there was a joke about who wore the pants (another quaint phrase from that era) in the typical American household. A couple sitting on the front porch is asked who makes the family's decisions.</p>
        <p>''I do,'' the husband proclaims. ''I decide how we vote in every election. You name an issue -- local politics, national defense, the economy, foreign policy -- and I'll tell you where we stand.''</p>
        <p>The wife nods demurely. ''Yes, he makes all the important decisions,'' she says. ''The only thing I decide is how we spend our money.''</p>
        <p>Today the roles seem to be reversed, at least when it comes to spending the federal surplus. Men want to do it themselves, to judge from their support for tax-cutting Republicans, but women seem more interested in larger issues. They're supporting Democrats at the expense of the household budget.</p>
        <p>The expense is striking in the New York area because so many middle-class families here do not qualify for the ''middle-class tax cuts'' proposed by Al Gore and Hillary Rodham Clinton. The Democrats focus on families making less than $60,000 per year, a sum that buys a reasonably comfortable middle-class lifestyle in the typical American community.</p>
        <p>But that standard of living would cost about $85,000 in the New York suburbs, and $135,000 in the city. Middle-class New Yorkers earn relatively high salaries, which mean high tax brackets, so they would be prime beneficiaries of the broad tax cuts proposed by George W. Bush and Rick A. Lazio.</p>
        <p>In all, New York State residents would get back $11.1 billion annually from the Bush tax cuts, versus $3.5 billion from the Gore tax plan, according to a report released Wednesday by Edmund J. McMahon Jr., a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, a conservative group.</p>
        <p>Mr. McMahon's report points to the case of a family of four making the median income in Westchester County, $83,100, and itemizing deductions. The family would get no automatic tax break from the Gore plan, although it could save $1,210 if it was paying at least $10,000 a year in college tuition. It could also, by setting aside $3,000 in a retirement account, qualify for a $1,000 tax credit that would be locked in that account.</p>
        <p>Under the Bush tax plan, the Westchester family would save $2,628 per year, Mr. McMahon calculates. He also cites the example of a single person making $62,970 a year, the average wage in Manhattan. That person would save $1,180 under the Bush plan, but nothing under the Gore plan.</p>
        <p>Why, then, isn't Mr. Bush making more headway among women? One answer may be in the packaging of tax cuts.</p>
        <p>''Democrats have personalized the tax cuts,'' Mr. McMahon said. ''They've targeted them at college students, children in day care, retired people. Maybe that appeals more to women than broad tax cuts. But in most cases Bush will give even bigger tax cuts to those people, and he'll give everyone else tax cuts, too.''</p>
        <p>Another answer is that tax cuts mean less to women than other issues, like abortion rights or education. Women are generally more liberal than men, and New Yorkers are generally more liberal than the rest of America.</p>
        <p>THEY'VE been willing to pay high taxes for for the sake of the poor, even when the money ends up going to non-poor people in other states. As Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan has been pointing out for years, New York State has one of the highest rates of poverty in America, yet it gets back less from Washington than it sends in taxes.</p>
        <p>The export of tax dollars, Mr. Moynihan said recently, made sense when New York could spare the money. ''During the New Deal, New York was comparatively rich, and other regions were in crisis. We were happy to help. But that is no longer the case. We have gradually been impoverished. The transfer of wealth keeps working against us. We should be in favor of lower taxes and be very wary of supporting any social programs at the national level.''</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Mr. Moynihan said he was not surprised to hear of the new calculations on New York's savings from the Bush tax cuts. But he was not, of course, endorsing the opposition's plan.</p>
        <p>''At this point,'' he said, ''I'd rather use the surplus to pay down the debt than throw it away in programs or give it away in tax cuts.'' That is a common view among Democratic politicians and policy-makers, and maybe it makes economic sense in the long term. Or maybe it's the kind of big-picture thinking favored by that husband on the front porch.</p>
