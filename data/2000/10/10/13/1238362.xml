        <p>There aren't many  designers  not many human beings, actually -- who could, without a hint of irony, make people listen to Bette Midler sing the theme from ''The Rose'' and still retain citizenship in the republic of the unimpeachably groovy. But Veronique Branquinho, who opened her spring 2001 show here on Tuesday night to that recording, is so firmly entrenched in the world of those who are never left out of the loft party that she could have gotten away with playing the theme song from ''Beaches.''</p>
        <p>Creatively, Ms. Branquinho's subversions are neither grand nor all that defiant. They play out, as they did three days ago, in a shirtdress with an unfinished hem, barely perceptible, or a skirt whose conservative gray knife pleats were revealed through a cut shaped like an inverted V in front of its overlay.</p>

        <p>There aren't many  designers  not many human beings, actually -- who could, without a hint of irony, make people listen to Bette Midler sing the theme from ''The Rose'' and still retain citizenship in the republic of the unimpeachably groovy. But Veronique Branquinho, who opened her spring 2001 show here on Tuesday night to that recording, is so firmly entrenched in the world of those who are never left out of the loft party that she could have gotten away with playing the theme song from ''Beaches.''</p>
        <p>Creatively, Ms. Branquinho's subversions are neither grand nor all that defiant. They play out, as they did three days ago, in a shirtdress with an unfinished hem, barely perceptible, or a skirt whose conservative gray knife pleats were revealed through a cut shaped like an inverted V in front of its overlay.</p>
        <p>But in this collection, even more pointedly than in her last, Ms. Branquinho, whose bangs hover at her pupils, really distinguished herself as one of the few young designers working in these boom times who equate cool not with a small bank of ironic references to the near past but rather with the lamentable and morose. Ms. Branquinho seems like the sort of person to whom repressed anguish is the greatest virtue.</p>
        <p>In some regard, her collection seemed meant for the woman who might at any time be called upon to perform a reading of ''45 Mercy Street.'' But however adolescent her sentiments may have been, she voiced them with exquisite sophistication, taking the idea of a droopy raglan-sleeved shirt, for example, cutting it in satin and slitting the sleeves to articulate the shoulder.</p>
        <p>Alexander McQueen is another designer whose imprimatur of cool cannot be erased, even when he sends poodle skirts down the runway, as he did on Wednesday during his show for Givenchy. What Mr. McQueen managed to accomplish for the first time was a collection that bore some relationship to the image of the French house he works for and that at the same time did not make it look as if he tried too hard to suppress his own sense of twisted rebellion.</p>
        <p>In the weeks preceding Mr. McQueen's show, there had been rumors, ultimately quashed, that he and Givenchy were going to part ways. It was easy to believe that the marriage would come to an end in light of the near-astonishing ugliness of his biker collection last season. At the end of the show, Mr. McQueen made his runway appearance on a scooter, and you half expected him to be carrying a sign that read: ''Was it bad enough? Can I be fired now?''</p>
        <p>This season, Mr. McQueen seemed willing to assume the role of the good son. He opened his fine show with a series that incorporated partially sheer, boned bustiers in black. One announced itself discreetly in a perfect off-the-shoulder black cocktail dress; another proclaimed itself more aggressively with stockings, a garter belt and a bowler. You knew you were looking at a pared-down version of the ideal McQueen woman, one whose own notion of the sexually adventurous would be considerably less cliched and more perverse. All that aside, the looks were generally stunning.</p>
        <p>In the latter part of the show, Mr. McQueen seemed to be poking fun, however elegantly, at the notion of what happens to a woman who starts out as the life of the party and then lands in the monied world (the Givenchy world) and sees no reason to leave. She overcompensates in her effort to look proper; she borrows the most obvious references to conventional femininity. This seemed to be the thinking behind Mr. McQueen's exaggerated poodle skirts, some with stripes of plaid ruffles.</p>
        <p>A few hours later, when Marc Jacobs showed his spring line for Louis Vuitton, he, too, took a big step away from the bloodless looks of his last collection. He joined Mr. McQueen in embracing a part of the body that fashion has been ignoring: the waist. He used wide belts to articulate it, and his funnel skirts, many with floral prints, rested north of the belly instead of hanging low at the hip. Mr. Jacobs hired the designer Stephen Sprouse to do his prints and to create an alternative Louis Vuitton logo in graffiti that was splashed across the handbags on display. Even in a series of military looks -- cavalry jackets and whatnot -- Mr. Jacobs maintained a look of appealing womanliness.</p>
        <p>Renewed infatuation with the waist was also on display at Martine Sitbon's show on Wednesday afternoon, cinching it, for example, with a streamlined belt on a decidedly ungirly white flounced skirt suit. Ms. Sitbon, whose recent collections have been tiring, managed beautifully in this show to incorporate the uneven, draped lines that so many designers barraged audiences with this season, and yet kept the clothes from looking as they did in the early 80's, when 35-year-olds were in the 12th grade. The retro-ness of the ruching on a red skirt, for example, was offset by the placement of clean rectangular strips of fabric on top of it.</p>
        <p>There hasn't been all that much to complain about in Paris in recent days, but Michael Kors's show for Celine left little to be excited about. After paying campy homage to conspicuous consumption last season, Mr. Kors turned to the iconography of the not-very-well-to-do, though with nowhere near the level of mindless vulgarity that John Galliano displayed in his show for Christian Dior. For no explicable reason, Mr. Kors showed washed-out denim jackets, more pairs of cuffed leggings than a person could register and skirts that looked cut from sweatshirts. Goodbye ''Dynasty.'' Hello ''Married With Children.''</p>
