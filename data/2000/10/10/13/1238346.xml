        <p>Tomkins P.L.C., a British conglomerate with businesses that range from windshield wiper blades to Smith &amp; Wesson handguns, said today that its chief executive, Greg Hutchings, had resigned after the company learned of what it called ''corporate excesses'' involving corporate jets, company apartments and family members on the payroll.</p>
        <p>David Newlands, the chairman, said he had asked the auditing firm Arthur Andersen to investigate why Mr. Hutching's wife and housekeeper were on the company payroll and to investigate the use of four jets owned by the company but leased to a private operator.</p>
        <p>A company spokeswoman, who declined to be identified, said the investigation would also cover the use of two company apartments in central London.</p>
        <p>''There is evidence of some corporate excesses in the past,'' Mr. Newlands told reporters. He was appointed executive chairman at the same time that Mr. Hutchings's resignation was announced.</p>
        <p>In a telephone interview, Mr. Newlands said ''a lot of the substance'' in the allegations was correct. ''Wives were on the payroll; we own jets; we own apartments,'' he said. ''Now we will sell the apartments, sell the jets and will clean it up so that these things do not happen again.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hutchings made no immediate comment on the accusations. The 53-year-old businessman, who specialized in buying undervalued companies, is one of Britain's 1,000 richest people with compensation at Tomkins of about $2 million a year and stock holdings in the company worth about $24 million at today's prices.</p>
        <p>Shares of Tomkins rose 3.5 pence to close at 168.5 pence ($2.44) after Mr. Hutchings resigned. The stock had reached a high of 384 pence in 1998, but had fallen as investors lost interest in conglomerates like Tomkins and were pressing Mr. Hutchings to sell more businesses.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hutchings joined Tomkins in 1983 and by 1998 had turned the small company into a conglomerate worth $:4 billion, or about $5.8 billion at today's exchange rates. At that time, its interests included food, lawn mowers, auto parts and the Identikit facial imaging system. The United States accounts for roughly half of the company's annual sales of $:5.6 billion or about $8.2 billion.</p>
        <p>Mr. Newlands, the chairman, said the company would conduct a strategic review over several months before appointing a new chief executive and he said major investors would be contacted individually to be given assurances about the company's management.</p>
        <p>For the last few months, Tomkins has been disposing of assets including its Murray &amp; Hayter lawn mower division, which it agreed this month to sell to Summersong Investment Inc. of the United States for $220.9 million. It sold its European food business to Doughty Hanson &amp; Company.for $:1.1 billion or about $1.6 billion last July. It is also seeking a buyer for its Smith &amp; Wesson division which provides less than 1 percent of the company's annual earnings, but is seen as what one analyst called a ''poison pill'' because of litigation against gun makers in the United States.</p>
