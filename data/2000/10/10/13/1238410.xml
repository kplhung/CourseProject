        <p>Pieces of a meteorite that fell over a frozen lake in Canada last January appear to be the oldest and most pristine extraterrestrial material yet found, geologists say, and may carry telling clues about the early solar system and the origin of life on Earth.</p>
        <p>The first analysis of the exotic fragments, described in today's issue of the journal Science, showed that they came from an especially rare type -- or perhaps a new class -- of carbonaceous chondrites, the kind of meteorites that represent solar chemistry virtually unchanged over the last 4.5 billion years, since the birth of the solar system. Scientists called it the most important meteorite discovery in the last 30 years.</p>
        <p>Geochemists said the dark fragments, well preserved at subfreezing temperatures, were rich in carbon and nitrogen and included a scattering of tiny diamonds. These are grains of interstellar matter, debris from exploded stars that was implanted into asteroids at the time the Sun and its planets were formed. Scientists said the new object might  be richer in interstellar grains than any meteorite yet studied.</p>
        <p>In a commentary accompanying the journal report, Dr. Jeffrey N. Grossman, a geochemist at the United States Geological Survey in Reston, Va., wrote, ''This provides a unique opportunity to expand our knowledge of the nature and origin of organic matter that may have accreted on early Earth and played a role in the origin of life.''</p>
        <p>An international team of scientists studied about two pounds of the best-preserved pieces of the meteorite, which were recovered from the ice covering Tagish Lake in northern British Columbia, near the Yukon border. Dr. Peter G. Brown, a geochemist at the University of Western Ontario, in London, Canada, was the principal author of the team's report. To minimize contamination, the choice samples are kept frozen and otherwise protected at the Johnson Space Center in Houston.</p>
        <p>''This is the only meteorite, as far as we know, that has ever been recovered in a completely frozen state,'' Dr. Brown said in a telephone interview. ''These are the most pristine meteorite samples on the planet right now.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Gerald J. Wasserburg, a geochemist at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, who has specialized in analyzing meteorites and lunar rocks, said that if the discovery had been properly interpreted, ''that would be fantastic, and I would almost mortgage my house to study a piece of it.''</p>
        <p>The circumstances of the Tagish Lake meteorite's fall to Earth favored scientists. When it entered the atmosphere on Jan. 18, the object was probably more than 20 feet wide and weighed 220 tons. The friction of the atmospheric plunge shattered the meteorite and produced a spectacular fireball arcing across the northern sky. More than 70 eyewitnesses reported seeing the spectacle, and American military satellites closely tracked the trajectory.</p>
        <p>Armed with these observations, scientists calculated the meteorite's origins and entry velocity. They said it was probably a chunk off one of the many asteroids that orbit in a belt between Mars and Jupiter. It could have spent millions of years wandering through the solar system before being captured by Earth's gravity.</p>
        <p>Of the nearly 1,000 meteorites recovered from witnessed falls over the last two centuries, Dr. Grossman said, only five have been of the rare class known as CI chondrites. Such meteorites are extremely fragile, compared with the more common stony meteorites. The chondrites usually burn up before reaching the surface, or turn to mud or dirt when they come into contact with water.  But this one scattered pieces in the winter, mostly over a frozen lake, and the cold preserved them from disintegration or contamination. And the black pieces were easy to spot on the Tagish Lake ice.</p>
        <p>It so happened that Jim Brook, a bush pilot and outfitter for hunting and fishing parties, lived in a cabin near the lake. On Jan. 25, he went out on the frozen lake and picked up several dozen pieces, altogether about two pounds of meteorite material. He had heard about the proper handling of such pieces and diligently deposited them in plastic bags and kept them in his freezer until they could be turned over to scientists.</p>
        <p>All but one of the fragments has remained frozen since they were collected, Dr. Brown's team reported. This was critical, scientists said, because it prevented the escape of the meteorite's many volatile chemical compounds, which can evaporate quickly at room temperatures. Dr. Brown said that some other fragments, after they had gone through cycles of thawing and re-freezing, had crumbled or turned to mud.</p>
        <p>In their report, the scientists wrote, ''We tentatively conclude that Tagish Lake is a new type of carbonaceous chondrite.'' But they did not rule out the possibility, they said, that its unusual chemical characteristics reflected a pristine state of previously classified chondrites that had never before seen by scientists.</p>
        <p>Dr. Grossman said the Tagish Lake object ''will be the most important recovered fall'' since meteorites retrieved in 1969 in Allende, Mexico, and Murchison, Australia.</p>
        <p>Those events, Dr. Grossman said, ''touched off a revolution in our understanding of meteorites and what they tell us about the early solar system.''</p>
