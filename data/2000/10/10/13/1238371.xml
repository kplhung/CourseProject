        <p>The vice president of the Philippines resigned from her cabinet post today as pressure mounted for President Joseph Estrada to step down in a growing bribery scandal.</p>
        <p>Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, who is not a member of the president's party, said she would stay on as vice president but was resigning as secretary of social welfare because of what she called ''serious accusations'' against Mr. Estrada.</p>
        <p>The president denied the accusations today and said he would not step down despite a move in Parliament to impeach him and despite a call on Wednesday for his resignation by the influential Roman Catholic cardinal, Jaime Sin.</p>
        <p>The accusations and the outcry are the most serious crisis of Mr. Estrada's two-and-a-half-year tenure, and the pressure against him is fueled by months of discontent.</p>
        <p>In the current scandal, Mr. Estrada has been accused by a provincial governor who is also a gambling kingpin of receiving more than $11 million in payoffs, most of it from an illegal numbers game called jueteng.</p>
        <p>The governor, Luis Singson, provided a Senate hearing with documents he said he had kept detailing payments he had made to Mr. Estrada, two of the president's sons and several government officials. It is the latest and most serious of several allegations of corruption against Mr. Estrada.</p>
        <p>The president's standing has been hurt most seriously by accusations that he has mishandled the economy. A point of pride under his predecessor, Fidel V. Ramos, it has declined steeply during his tenure and is now one of the weakest in the region.</p>
        <p>The already slack peso and stock exchange slid further today as the attacks on Mr. Estrada grew. Before the central bank stepped in to halt its drop, the peso, the local currency, fell to a new low of 48.5 to the dollar.</p>
        <p>Analysts said the current scandal would only reinforce negative perceptions by investors that Mr. Estrada's government is incompetent, corrupt and riddled with cronyism. The president's pals include prominent underworld figures who often join him for recreation in what is known as his ''midnight cabinet.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Estrada is also accused, both because of his policies and lack of policies, of aggravating a Muslim insurgency that has flared during his tenure in the southern Philippines. Critics also say he has bungled a mass hostage taking in the same region.</p>
        <p>In a radio broadcast today -- his first public statement since the bribery scandal erupted last week -- Mr. Estrada insisted that he had not received ''a single cent'' in illegal money and called the accusations ''a politically motivated hatchet job.''</p>
        <p>In announcing her resignation, Mrs. Arroyo said that because of the allegations against the president, ''I regret that I can no longer continue to serve as a member of the present cabinet.''</p>
        <p>A popular politician who already is the leading candidate to succeed Mr. Estrada when his single six-year term ends, Mrs. Arroyo appeared to be moving firmly into the opposition with her resignation from the cabinet.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Arroyo, who would take over as president if Mr. Estrada resigned  or was impeached, has played a careful game in the past, resisting pressure from her allies to speak out against Mr. Estrada.</p>
        <p>Cardinal Sin, however, has long been a critic of the high-living president. A moral force particularly because of his crucial role in the ''people power'' revolt that ousted former President Ferdinand E. Marcos in 1986, the cardinal sharpened his language on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>''He has lost the moral ascendancy to govern,'' he said of Mr. Estrada. ''For the good of the people he should relinquish his office.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Singson, who leveled the accusations against Mr. Estrada, has been one of his cronies and a participant in his late-night happy hours.</p>
        <p>In Senate testimony Wednesday, he said he had personally managed the payments of $8.6 million in illegal gambling payoffs to Mr. Estrada over a 21-month period. In addition, he said, the president had received $2.8 million siphoned from the tax returns of his province, Ilocos Sur.</p>
        <p>Mr. Singson said he was speaking now because the president had cut him out of provincial revenues from a new legal form of gambling called Bingo 2-Ball. Jueteng is a huge illegal business in the Philippines.</p>
        <p>Mr. Singson said that when Bingo 2-Ball was instituted last month, ostensibly to put illegal jueteng out of business, Mr. Estrada had awarded the franchise to a rival crony, a gambler named Charlie Ang.</p>
        <p>Mr. Estrada suspended Bingo 2-Ball on Sunday after Mr. Singson made his allegations.</p>
