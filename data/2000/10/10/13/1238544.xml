        <p>STORPER-Sidney. Beloved husband of Charlotte; loving father of Marsha and Larry Brooks, Henry and Fran Storper; devoted grandfather of Scott, David and Andrew Storper, Beth and Seth Joseph, and Scott's fiancee Claudia Arzate; and bedazzled great-grandfather of Samantha Joseph, passed away Tuesday, October 10, 2000. Sidney Storper grew up in New York City where he was an accomplished swimmer and lifeguard. Subsequently, he was a brilliant chemical engineer who developed a fuselage coating that saved many U.S. planes during World War II and for years thereafter. Known as a ''problem solver par excellence'', he was also a successful real estate owner and manager, work he continued to do after moving to Florida in 1991. Adored by family and friends, he always had a firm hand shake, a winning smile, and a great one-liner. Services will be held Friday, October 13, 2000 at 11 AM at Beth Israel Memorial in Delray Beach. The family will receive friends on Saturday and Sunday at Henry and Fran Storper's home in Miami.</p>
