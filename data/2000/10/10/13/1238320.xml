        <p>Worlds apart in all other respects, two first-rate documentaries released on Tuesday are equally savvy in working their territories.</p>
        <p>In ''American Pimp,'' the Hughes Brothers (Allen and Albert) fan out from coast to coast for a sweeping survey of about a dozen alternately odious and hilarious managers of the world's oldest profession. And deep in the Mexican countryside, Nettie Wild plays a quiet waiting game in ''A Place Called Chiapas,'' her study of the Zapatista uprising in the 1990's.</p>
        <p>When ''American Pimp,'' on videocassette and DVD from MGM, opened in theaters in June, some critics said they wished it had focused on one or two pimps, rather than skipping around among so many. In an interview on the disc, Allen Hughes says filming all of them gives a fuller picture. Anyway, it would have been a shame to lose Filmore Slim or Gorgeous Dre.</p>
        <p>In name alone, pimps called Payroll and Sir Captain sum up a job that, it is suggested in the film, goes back to the days when intermediaries made arrangements between black women and white slave owners. In Chicago, Bishop Don Magic Juan takes the Hugheses home to meet his mother and show them pictures of himself with Donald J. Trump, Ike Turner and other celebrities. ''You have to know how to work the track,'' he says. ''Pimpology -- a whole science.''</p>
        <p>In 1997, Ms. Wild, a Canadian filmmaker, arrived in Mexico under loftier auspices. ''We were making a documentary called 'Modern Mexico Today,' dripping in CBC and National Film Board accreditation,'' she said in an interview. Ignored by the government, she and her film crew melted into the Chiapas countryside, where she became acquainted with the Zapatista resistance, named for the rebel leader Emiliano Zapata, who was killed in 1919, and the Zapatistas' charismatic leader, Subcommander Marcos.</p>
        <p>A masked pipe-smoking intellectual with bandoleers across his chest, Marcos not only sets the dress code for his fellows but also comes to epitomize a sophisticated form of rebellion referred to in the film as ''postmodern revolution.'' In part, the term refers to Marcos's photo sessions with French fashion magazines and to the Zapatistas' use of the Internet to spread their message, but it also relates to insidious new methods of manipulation by all sides of the struggle, which include the Mexican government and its Peace and Justice paramilitary organization.</p>
        <p>The rebellion started hot. In 1994, in reaction to decades of exploitation, the indigenous Zapatista National Liberation Army took over five towns in the southern state of Chiapas. Many were killed, but a cease-fire was quickly arranged. With it have come years of tinderbox standoff and slippery negotiation. ''Death by dialogue,'' it is called in this videocassette, released by New Yorker.</p>
        <p>Marcos himself is thought to be a philosophy professor from Mexico City. ''He brings this huge literary background, which mixes beautifully with the indigenous people's sense of political theater,'' Ms. Wild said. ''The combination drives the government crazy because your camera just eats it up.''</p>
        <p>New Video Releases</p>
        <p>Toy Story 2</p>
        <p>Standing tall among the computer-animated characters introduced five years ago in ''Toy Story,'' Woody the cowhand is kidnapped by Big Al McWhiggin, a toy dealer who recognizes him as the hero of an old television show and wants to sell him and fellow toy westerners to a museum in Japan. To spring Woody, the astronaut Buzz Lightyear (above) rallies comrades from the little boy Andy's room, who join forces with a Buzz Lightyear knock-off and some partying Barbie dolls from Big Al's superstore. In the ensuing fracas, a ''cutting-edge franchise,'' Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times, ''still has the power to enchant children while keeping adults entertained.''</p>
        <p>1999. Disney. $26.99; DVD, $39.99. 92 minutes. Closed captioned. G. Release date: Oct. 17.</p>
        <p>Rules of Engagement</p>
        <p>In Vietnam, Terry Childers (Samuel L. Jackson) made a command decision that saved Hays Hodges (Tommy Lee Jones). Now a grizzled and embittered marine lawyer about to retire, Colonel Hodges defends Colonel Childers against charges that a unit Childers commanded massacred civilians in Yemen. William Friedkin's film may reach for past triumphs (''The Exorcist'' and ''The French Connection''), but ''there's not much going on here, and since 'Rules' makes the tactical error of showing Childers's innocence at the outset, there's little suspense'' (Elvis Mitchell).</p>
        <p>2000. Paramount. $107.37; $29.99; DVD, $29.99. 123 minutes. Closed captioned. R. Release date: Oct. 17.</p>
        <p>Pitch Black</p>
        <p>The way Riddick (Vin Diesel) tears off his manacles suggests a hybrid of Hannibal Lecter, Harry Houdini and Hulk Hogan stomping out of a leather fetishist's private dungeon. Actually, there's another side to Riddick, or Mr. Diesel, who manages to inject wit and intelligence into the character of a murderer enlisted to save spacecraft crash survivors from shrieking batlike things. Buoyed by Mr. Diesel, the director David Twohy ''tweaks this formulaic escape-from-hell story with just enough original touches to give it a lift'' (Stephen Holden).</p>
        <p>2000. Universal. $107.37; DVD, $26.98. 107 minutes. Closed captioned. R.</p>
        <p>Love and Basketball</p>
        <p>Monica and Quincy meet as hoop-tossing 11-year-olds who grow up into basketball-playing sweethearts (Sanaa Lathan and Omar Epps). Both climb the basketball ladder through college and the pros. He's a star. She's more the journeywoman type, but she's angry and aggressive enough to make a good case for the proposition that girls should have as much chance to compete in sports as boys. Gina Prince-Blythewood's film doesn't dwell on big issues, however, often dipping into melodrama. ''It's in the small touches that this movie comes alive, and it's rare that directors can pull off this kind of thing'' (Mitchell).</p>
        <p>2000. New Line. $107.37; DVD, $24.98. 118 minutes. Closed captioned. PG-13.</p>
