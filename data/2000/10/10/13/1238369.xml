        <p>Prime Minister Zhu Rongji has given ''absolutely emphatic'' assurances that China will not back away from the market-opening commitments that it made to gain entry into the World Trade Organization, the American trade negotiator said here today.</p>
        <p>After more than five hours of discussions with Mr. Zhu and senior trade officials, the American negotiator, Charlene Barshefsky, sought to dispel reports that the application to join the trade body might be unraveling or that China was having second thoughts about the sweeping concessions that it had made in talks with the United States and Europe.</p>
        <p>''The issue of China's accession is no longer whether'' it joins the trade group, Ms. Barshefsky told reporters. ''It's when.''</p>
        <p>She said American and European officials still believed that it might be possible for China to achieve membership by the end of the year, but only if it hastens to complete the complex final negotiations under way in Geneva to set the detailed conditions of membership.</p>
        <p>Ms. Barshefsky flew here in a hastily arranged trip, hoping to give a jolt to stalled final negotiations at the W.T.O. headquarters in Geneva over the precise terms of China's membership. Those talks have to mesh together the previous agreements that China has signed with scores of countries on thousands of trade and investment issues and translate principles into precise rules and schedules.</p>
        <p>China has agreed, in talks with the United States, the European Community and others, to cut tariffs significantly on agricultural and industrial products and to open major industries like banking and telecommunications to foreign investment.</p>
        <p>Some Western officials contended that China was backsliding on some issues in Geneva, including the timetables to reduce tariffs. Some experts have speculated that China's desire to enter the group has flagged because of fears that a rapid opening of markets would cause a surge in unemployment and social turmoil.</p>
        <p>Although there is great apprehension in China about the social effects of lower tariffs and investment barriers, top leaders have repeatedly stated their firm desire to join the trade group. Mr. Zhu and many economists here say they believe that China has to endure the painful shock of global competition to speed its transformation to an efficient market economy.</p>
        <p>In the meeting this morning just before he left for a visit to Japan, Mr. Zhu provided the Americans with just the assurances that they sought, Ms. Barshefsky reported.</p>
        <p>''I stressed the absolute importance of full compliance,'' she said. ''Mr. Zhu was emphatic, absolutely emphatic, that China will not back away from the bilateral commitments it made to the United States and other trading partners.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Barshefsky said the main problems in Geneva arose from the incredible complexity and variety of issues on the table, as well as China's need to deal with an oversight group of 40 countries. Conflict and confusion in the final stages of joining the W.T.O., she said, are normal, adding, ''We see this all the time, and I'm not overly concerned.''</p>
        <p>But, hinting at more substantive disagreements, she also said: ''Every country that accedes would like to get in doing less rather than more, and the less specific the better. China is no exception.''</p>
        <p>She said the talks had become mired over a host of ''dry, not sexy issues'' like agricultural quotas and product standards, which differ for imported and domestic goods.</p>
