        <p>While Arabs have been involved in the growing violence between Israel and the Palestinians with furious street protests and growing outrage against Israel, moderate Arab leaders increasingly fear that the deadly cycle threatens not only the Arab-Israeli peace effort, but also their own stability.</p>
        <p>As official denounce Israel reprisal raids in the West Bank after two Israeli soldiers were killed by a Palestinian mob in Ramallah today, Arab leaders braced for demonstrations after mosque prayers on Friday that in some capitals could turn against their own governments.</p>
        <p>''Arab leaders are afraid,'' a Western diplomat said tonight. ''You can almost smell the fear.''</p>
        <p>Partly in an effort to appease fury over what Arabs see as military aggression against Palestinians, President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and King Abdullah II of Jordan, both of whose countries have made peace with the Jewish state, called on Israel to stop the ''violence against the Palestinian brotherly people'' and to ''withdraw'' from positions taken after the violence erupted on Sept. 28.</p>
        <p>Yet to retain their positions as potential mediators and peacemakers, both leaders said their appeal to Israel, as Foreign Minister Amr Mousa of Egypt said, was aimed at restoring calm ''so that one can later reactivate the peace process effectively.''</p>
        <p>Few Arab officials or independent experts said they thought that the violence would lead to a new Arab-Israeli war. ''The Arabs are too weak to go to war,'' said a senior Jordanian official.</p>
        <p>But, he added, it could well destroy for the foreseeable future what was left of efforts to negotiate a peace agreement, a development that would have profound implications for Arabs and their governments.</p>
        <p>If peace efforts cannot be revived, hard-liners like Saddam Hussein of Iraq and Islamic militants like Hamas in the Palestinian territories and Hezbollah in Lebanon would benefit.</p>
        <p>''Hawks within Israel and among the Arabs would say that they were right in arguing that their enemy only understands force,'' the senior official said. ''That would only trigger more harsh action by Israel and further violence.''</p>
        <p>The possibility that a final peace between Arabs and Jews might elude the region after seven years of promise and negotiations was particularly dispiriting to officials here in Jordan, a moderate stable state whose late ruler, King Hussein, and current monarch are extremely popular and whose officials have worked hard to achieve a peace on which Jordan's prosperity depends.</p>
        <p>The crisis also highlights a hallmark of Arab political life -- the huge gap between official pronouncements aimed mostly at shoring up their governments' nationalist credentials in the eyes of their people and what officials say privately about Israel and their fellow Arab governments.</p>
        <p>For example, although most Arab states assailed Israel today for what they called harsh overreaction to Palestinian protests and violence, senior Arab officials criticized in private conversations Yasir Arafat, his Palestinian Authority and Egypt. All were at least partly responsible for the collapse of peace efforts, a senior Jordanian official said.</p>
        <p>''Israel is militarily strong, but its psyche is fragile,'' the official said. ''Heated Arab rhetoric and Arafat's threats to declare war on Israel are not only lunacy. They are counterproductive. They panic Israelis and lead them to conclude that Arabs will never accept Israel in the region or live in peace with them.''</p>
        <p>Arab and Western officials here complained that Egypt had pressed Mr. Arafat to reject the ambitious peace proposals offered by Prime Minister Ehud Barak at the Camp David meetings, which many here said had helped lay the political ground for Ariel Sharon's trip to holy sites in Jerusalem's Old City, the violent protests that followed it and the growing confrontation. Unless the cycle is halted, the peace effort may face a situation where it cannot be revived, several feared.</p>
        <p>Similarly, a senior Arab official said, Egypt's call for an Arab summit meeting this month rather than next year could also heighten tensions with Israel, not to mention display what he called ''Arab impotence.''</p>
        <p>''Rash statements could put in jeopardy everything that Jordan and other moderate Arab states have worked for,'' the official said.</p>
        <p>Salameh Nematt, Amman bureau chief of Al Hayat, the Arab newspaper published in London, said it was impossible to talk about ''Arab reaction'' to the crisis, because ''there is no Arab world.''</p>
        <p>For Jordan, Mr. Nematt said, the crisis threatens to undermine an economy whose 4 percent annual growth rate and plans for future prosperity depend on regional peace and tourism revenues. More than half its population is Palestinian.</p>
        <p>Syria, he said, has been relatively quiet, because Bashar Assad, the inexperienced new president, was concentrating on consolidating his hold on power in Damascus and Syria's presence in Lebanon. Oman and several gulf states ''live in their own world, and this conflict, for them, is still remote.''</p>
        <p>But, he added, the crisis has shown that although there is no Arab world, there is an Arab satellite media. Throughout the week, Arab television networks and newspapers have repeatedly shown photographs and film of Muhammad Dura, 12, and other Palestinian children being shot, as well as other victims of Israeli soldiers and military actions. Such heart-wrenching photographs and footage have ''brought Palestinian suffering and their cause to Arabs everywhere in a new and dramatic way,'' Mr. Nematt said.</p>
        <p>The coverage has helped incite anti-Israeli and anti-American protests not only in the capitals of Israel's neighbors, but also in unlikely countries like Kuwait, which the United States helped free from Iraqi occupation in the gulf war in 1991.</p>
        <p>As a result, virtually all Arab governments have criticized Israel and taken steps to appease public fury. Oman announced that it was closing its commercial representation in Tel Aviv and Israel's trade office in Muscat. And although King Abdullah issued a moderate statement with Mr. Mubarak in Egypt, his cabinet issued a much harsher condemnation of Israel, saying that Jordan ''holds Israel responsible'' for the ''systematic killings and destruction of Palestinian property.'' It condemned ''extremist practices.''</p>
        <p>The mood in Amman and other Arab capitals was gloomy and anxious. But a minority of Arab officials and experts said that the violence could be contained and that there was still a chance that peace talks could be revised.</p>
        <p>''This could be the very painful labor before the delivery of a peace agreement,'' said Abdul Karim Kabbariti, a former Jordanian prime minister and chief of the royal court. The violence, he said, could bring home the potential ''costs of the failure of the peace process'' and, ultimately, result in a ''historic compromise.'' But such optimism was rare in Arab capitals tonight.</p>
