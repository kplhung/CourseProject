        <p>A man goes to the movies with a friend. Before the show starts, he buys popcorn. On the way to his seat, he struggles to get past the woman sitting by the aisle. They both get huffy, and then she accuses him of looking at her breasts, which aren't entirely tucked inside her low-cut dress.</p>
        <p>He insists that he wasn't looking. Then, as he squeezes by, he gives his parting shot. ''You wear that dress because you want people to look at your shoes,'' he says sarcastically. After the movie, the man discovers that the woman is dating his best friend.</p>
        <p>This comic scenario built around obnoxiousness and rudeness -- and their consequences -- may seem familiar, almost like a scene from ''Seinfeld.'' That's because it's the work of Larry David, a co-creator of the popular sitcom. Now he has moved in front of the camera, as the star of a 10-episode comedy series on HBO called ''Curb Your Enthusiasm.''</p>
        <p>''Curb Your Enthusiasm,'' which grew out of Mr. David's one-hour HBO special last year, may be even more idiosyncratic than ''Seinfeld'' because Mr. David is a very strange man -- and he's playing himself. It's easy to believe that when he was working as a stand-up comedian, his way of dealing with hecklers was to heckle back. No one could ever accuse him, a man who refers to the wife he loves as Hitler, of being ingratiating.</p>
        <p>On ''Seinfeld,'' this cranky sensibility was filtered through likable actors. Here, nothing stands between the audience and Mr. David's acerbic vision and morose face.</p>
        <p>There is every reason to despise the man, or at least to feel irritated by his narrowness and self-pity. Instead, for those who aren't immediately put off, Mr. David's comic brilliance becomes even more apparent in this unvarnished form. You find yourself laughing at the uncomfortable situations he creates for himself, and even sympathizing with him. Go figure.</p>
        <p>''Curb Your Enthusiasm'' pretends to follow Mr. David's actual life, although Cheryl Hines (who plays his wife, Cheryl) and Jeff Garlin (who plays his manager, Jeff) are actors. Mr. Garlin is also one of the show's executive producers. Real celebrities will appear as themselves. Richard Lewis plays Mr. David's best friend in the first episode; Ted Danson, Mary Steenburgen and Julia Louis-Dreyfus will appear in later episodes.</p>
        <p>The show is styled as cinema verite, with waggish musical interludes playing counterpoint to the deadpan humor. Mr. David lives in Los Angeles in a nice, spacious house, and he prefers driving to walking, but his New York neuroses remain intact.</p>
        <p>He is embarrassed by sex and also obsessed with it, and since his show is on HBO rather than a network, the jokes are more explicit and the language is more profane. In one of the later episodes, pornography is the comic thread tying Mr. David up in knots.</p>
        <p>''Seinfeld'' fans may experience ''Curb Your Enthusiasm'' as either an alternative to reruns of their favorite show or commentary on them. Mr. David seems most like the relentlessly insecure George Costanza, but he is actually an amalgam of all the ''Seinfeld'' characters, whose lives were shaped by his special warp for several years.</p>
        <p>In Mr. David's universe, suffering is the essence of life, so even success can be transformed into grist for humiliation and pain. When a restaurant hostess refuses to seat him and his wife because they've become a party of two instead of four, Cheryl informs the hostess that her husband Larry was a co-creator of ''Seinfeld.'' The hostess is unmoved. Things get worse when Larry's agent, Jeff, invites the couple to join the group at his table, where Cheryl learns about a lie that Larry has told.</p>
        <p>Mr. David operates by a strict moral code, whose rules aren't always obvious but which seems to revolve around the notion that all deeds, good and bad, will be punished somehow.</p>
        <p>In ''Curb Your Enthusiasm'' he has used this glum principle to turn his life into a very funny comedy of comeuppance.</p>
        <p>CURB YOUR ENTHUSIASM  HBO, Sunday at 9:30 p.m.</p>
        <p>Written by Larry David; Mr. David, Jeff Garlin and Gavin Polone, executive producers; Robert B. Weide, supervising producer and director; Sandy Chanley and Tom Bull, producers.</p>
        <p>WITH: Larry David (himself), Cheryl Hines (Cheryl) and Jeff Garlin (Jeff).</p>
