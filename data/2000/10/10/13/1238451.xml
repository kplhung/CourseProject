        <p>The Senate today approved four of the nine remaining spending bills needed to keep the government running, setting the stage for lawmakers and the White House to focus on the most contentious measures next week as Congress prepares to adjourn for the year.</p>
        <p>Senators voted, 87 to 8, to endorse and send to a conference committee a $107.9 billion measure to finance, among other things, veterans, housing, space and scientific research programs and the Environmental Protection Agency.</p>
        <p>A separate $23.6 billion measure to pay for federal energy and water projects was coupled with the housing bill after Senate Republican leaders gave in to the White House in a dispute over saving three endangered species in the Missouri River watershed. House and Senate negotiators will now meet to work out a compromise version.</p>
        <p>In a second vote that completed action on the four bills, senators approved, 58 to 37, a $2.5 billion spending plan for Congressional agencies and the Library of Congress, and $15.7 billion to finance operations at the Treasury Department and the Postal Service. The measure would also repeal a 3 percent telephone excise tax originally imposed during the Spanish-American War. This measure was sent to President Clinton for his expected approval.</p>
        <p>Today's action, capping weeks of tense negotiations, clears the legislative underbrush to allow Congressional and White House negotiators  to focus on three major spending bills -- the Labor and Health and Human Services Departments, foreign operations and one bill to finance the Commerce, Justice and State Departments -- that are hung up less over spending levels than politically charged policy issues.</p>
        <p>''The fact there's movement in the Senate is very, very helpful,'' said Representative C. W. Young, a Florida Republican who heads the House Appropriations Committee.</p>
        <p>Without a completed budget for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1, the House and Senate today approved a third stopgap spending measure to keep the government running at current levels through Oct. 20.</p>
        <p>With lawmakers from both parties urging their leaders to wrap up the session, Republican leaders clashed this morning over whether to set a final deadline for budget negotiations with the White House.</p>
        <p>At a meeting of Republican leaders, Senator Trent Lott, the majority leader, said the party should set Oct. 20 as the final deadline for completing work this year. But Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, the House majority whip, objected to the strategy, arguing that it would give too much leverage to the White House, said a person who attended the meeting.</p>
        <p>Today's biggest spending bill, which finances housing and veterans' matters, would provide 75,000 new vouchers for poor families to be used for affordable housing, according to the White House. It also would increase, by $18 million, the money given to states to combat pollution caused by the runoff of toxic chemicals from farms.</p>
        <p>Environmentalists won some and lost some on the bill for energy and water projects. A provision to block the Army Corps of Engineers from changing the flow of the Missouri River, to help two endangered birds and a fish -- the piping plover, the least tern and the pallid sturgeon -- was dropped, after Mr. Clinton vetoed an initial version that included the restriction.</p>
        <p>But the Senate today defeated two amendments by Barbara Boxer, Democrat of California, to strip out anti-environmental provisions. The first amendment affected air and water quality. The second amendment would have encouraged the E.P.A. to move quickly to clean up toxic chemicals from rivers and oceans.</p>
        <p>The White House said that the rider on dredging toxins had been substantially modified. Originally, the rider would have halted planning and cleanup activities on Superfund sites that involved contaminated sediments in river bottoms and sea beds  until a National Academy of Science study on the effectiveness of cleanup technologies.</p>
        <p>Under the agreement between the White House and Congress, current planning and cleanup activities may continue. Sites for which only planning is under way must wait until June or publication of the National Academy Study, whichever comes first, before they can move to the cleanup stage.</p>
        <p>White House officials say that sites like the Hudson River in New York and the Palos Verdes peninsula in California are not affected by the agreement since planners do not expect to move to cleanup before June.</p>
