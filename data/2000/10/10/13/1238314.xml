        <p>It's no surprise that Portugal has strong connections with African art, as for centuries the country -- an active explorer and colonizer in sub-Saharan Africa -- held vast tracts of land in wildly diverse cultural areas of the continent.</p>
        <p>What is surprising is that the art  associated with the former Portuguese colonies of Angola, Mozambique and Guinea-Bissau became part of a government program only in 1965, when the National Museum of Ethnology in Lisbon was conceived. Agents were dispatched to Africa to find and buy works, and some pieces were provided by existing Portuguese collections. It took until 1976 for the museum, which is devoted to other civilizations as well as African, to be built by the Portuguese Ministry of Culture.</p>

        <p>It's no surprise that Portugal has strong connections with African art, as for centuries the country -- an active explorer and colonizer in sub-Saharan Africa -- held vast tracts of land in wildly diverse cultural areas of the continent.</p>
        <p>What is surprising is that the art  associated with the former Portuguese colonies of Angola, Mozambique and Guinea-Bissau became part of a government program only in 1965, when the National Museum of Ethnology in Lisbon was conceived. Agents were dispatched to Africa to find and buy works, and some pieces were provided by existing Portuguese collections. It took until 1976 for the museum, which is devoted to other civilizations as well as African, to be built by the Portuguese Ministry of Culture.</p>
        <p>In the process some marvelous African art has been collected. But while the holdings have been well-exposed in Europe, they are little-known in the United States. Frank Herreman, now director of exhibitions at the Museum for African Art in SoHo, has done something about  that. He first saw the treasures in Lisbon in 1994, when he was associate director of the Historical Museums of the City of Antwerp, and promptly brought a group of them there. When he came to New York in 1995, he decided that a local viewing was a must and a result is ''In the Presence of Spirits: African Art From the National Museum of Ethnology, Lisbon.''</p>
        <p>The exhibition includes about 140 masks, power objects, figures, dolls, decorated stools and chairs, pipes, posts and other artifacts relating to the secular and the supernatural in African culture. It is the fourth in the distinguished series of exhibitions from African museums in Europe that the New York institution has organized since its founding in 1984.</p>
        <p>One of the show's most arresting sights is a group of initiation masks made from wood and more perishable materials like barkcloth fibers, fabrics and feathers. They are unusual for their high state of preservation. Representing ancestors whose supernatural powers are invoked in behalf of the initiates, the masks are worn in rituals that celebrate the attainment of male puberty among the Bidjogo people of Guinea-Bissau, as well as the Chokwe, Ngangela, Matapa and Mbwela of Angola. These longstanding rites of passage, preceded by circumcision, were compulsory for adolescents.</p>
        <p>The masks are gorgeous things, appearing in the form of human, animal and otherworldly incarnations, from fierce to benign in their expression and giddily imaginative in terms of shape and embellishment. One, a beautifully stylized hippo's head from the Bidjogo people, is an example of the zoomorphic masks they made in the belief that animals were the key to the supernatural world. Painted red to symbolize its glandular secretions, the hippo sports animal hair around its eye sockets, ears and ponderous muzzle. The weight of the masks forced wearers, bent toward the ground, to support themselves by leaning on crutches in the form of fanciful hippo legs with hooves.</p>
        <p>The rare fiber masks from the Kongo-Dinga peoples of Angola are  characterized by heavily emphasized, startled-looking mouths and eyes, set in abstractly painted faces framed by feather headdresses. Two beautiful Chokwe masks, carved in wood -- undoubtedly by the same anonymous hand -- with deep scarification on the faces, represent Pwo,  meaning ''woman.'' Pwo dances, although created and performed by men, reflect the elegance of accomplished female ancestors.</p>
        <p>As masks were associated with the initiation rites of adolescent boys, dolls played a very important role in the socialization of African girls, who underwent initiations, too. Some remarkable specimens are shown here, mainly from the Ambo peoples of southwestern Angola, who reckoned their ancestry in matrilineal terms. Respecting women as the guardians and nurturers of fertility, they considered childlessness a disaster.</p>
        <p>For little girls, dolls represented the promise of future children and so had to be handled gently. Older girls and women also carried doll-like ritual figures, seen as future offspring, and they were passed on from generation to generation. One of the most striking specimens here is a ritual doll from Manibe province in Angola, made from a corncob with its kernels intact.</p>
        <p>The doll, with studs for eyes stuck into the kernels, and chains of beads standing in for hair, represents an initiated woman. A necklace of beads and bullet shells encircles her neck,  and around her waist is a girdle of white beads. In earlier times mothers put several strands of ostrich eggshell beads around a female baby's waist, adding strands as she grew. At the girl's initiation the density of her waist beads represented the wealth of her clan.</p>
        <p>Power objects affiliated with the dead, called minkisi (plural) and nkisi (singular), were meant to call forth unusual abilities and strengths. They took the form of containers -- a figure, a clay pot, an animal horn, a bag -- for medicines, relics, cemetery clay or natural materials chosen for their relationship to what was desired. A vulture feather, for instance, was known for its ability to attack witches.</p>
        <p>Some of the power figures here are extraordinary in their expressiveness, particularly one from the Yombe people of Zaire province in Angola. A small statue of carved wood painted with various powders, it gazes beseechingly upward, its half-open mouth packed with filed teeth, which were considered beautiful. A cavity in its belly, which has lost the mirror that would customarily seal it, presumably was filled with medicines, and so was its head. Around its neck and bottom it wears many rag strips, probably torn from the garments of clients who entrusted this particular nkisi with assignments like witch-killing.</p>
        <p>One of the show's prized rarities is the representation of a Chokwe royal couple, two small but powerful-looking carved figures with bent legs, rigidly held hands and firmly planted big feet. Probably dating from the mid to late 1800's (the anonymity of African art makes it notably hard to date), the figure reflects the new political power of the Chokwe, who had gained wealth and access to weapons through trade. In 1887 they succeeded in overthrowing their rivals, the dominant Lunda, and re-proclaimed their royal lineage through icons like these.</p>
        <p>The male figure, who carries smaller male and female figures -- perhaps royal ancestors -- in each of his ham hands, stands for Chibinda Ilunga, a master of cultural innovations who introduced the concept of sacred kingship. The woman, equally ham-handed and large of foot, evokes Lweji, the first female chief of the Lunda. The two also symbolized the presence of powerful Chokwe chiefs -- male and female -- who established their political influence through a respectable swath of Africa.</p>
        <p>Many other objects stand out in this rewarding show. Among them are a brilliantly carved royal stool from the Luba people of Congo. It takes the form of a caryatid, a kneeling maiden with pointed breasts and a scarified body who supports the sitting platform on her head.</p>
        <p>A heart-rending funerary object is a small, sensitively wrought maternity figure of wood from the Yombe in Angola, at once stylized and highly personal. It holds a supine child across its knees. In another category a strong visual impression is made by a Bidjogo magic sawfish mask, of wood and fiber with a projecting sawtooth bill, worn by initiates into a stage of male maturity known as cabaro.</p>
        <p>In selecting the show, Mr. Herreman said, he focused on ''high aesthetic value.'' It's a pleasure to report that few objects here depart from that standard.</p>
        <p>''In the Presence of Spirits: African Art From the National Museum of Ethnology, Lisbon'' will remain at the Museum for African Art, 593 Broadway, near Prince Street, SoHo, (212) 966-1313, through Dec. 31.</p>
