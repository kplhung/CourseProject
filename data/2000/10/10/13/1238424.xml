        <p>POP QUIZ: During the debate on Wednesday night, Al Gore looked:</p>
        <p>A) Lobotomized.</p>
        <p>B) Like a hockey player stuck in the penalty box.</p>
        <p>C) Like Charlton Heston in that movie where the Spaniards prop him up on his horse after he's died and send the already stiffening corpse riding off into the sunset.</p>
        <p>''El Cid!'' shrieked a not totally disinterested Democrat over the phone. ''I'm watching the end of 'El Cid!' ''</p>
        <p>There is no joy in Goreville. At the very moment when the American people realize that they need a president who knows what he's doing in foreign policy, Mr. Gore managed to let George W. Bush hold him to a draw on international affairs. He even allowed the governor of Texas to beat him in this week's round of the hard-to-pronounce-name-dropping competition.</p>
        <p>The best news of the night for the Gore campaign was that since most undecided voters are not political junkies, the only swing votes watching this debate were the ones in the CNN focus group.</p>
        <p>O.K., I know you want equal time:</p>
        <p>POP QUIZ II: During the debate on Wednesday, George W. Bush looked:</p>
        <p>A) As if he'd been sucking lemons.</p>
        <p>B) Like a kid trying to hide the fact that he has to go to the bathroom.</p>
        <p>C) Weirdly euphoric when he talked about the death penalty.</p>
        <p>It's easy, given the way Mr. Gore seemed intellectually AWOL, to overestimate Mr. Bush's performance. This is a man who, when asked how he would exercise the ''enormous power'' of the presidency, basically said he would consult Dick Cheney.</p>
        <p>Talking about foreign policy, Mr. Bush volunteered: ''It's also important to keep a strong ties in the Middle East with credible ties because of the energy crisis we're now in. After all, all the energy is produced from -- from the Middle East. And so I -- I appreciate what the administration is doing. I -- I hope to get a sense of, should I be fortunate enough to be the president, how my administration will react to the Middle East.''</p>
        <p>Not long after, the moderator asked Mr. Gore how he and Mr. Bush differed in their approach to the Middle East. ''I haven't heard a big difference,'' Mr. Gore said.</p>
        <p>One babbled, the other agreed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore has spent the last few days trying to live down the devastating ''Saturday Night Live'' parody of his performance in Debate No. 1, as the guy begging for permission to give two answers to the question. His staff made him watch it, presumably under the assumption that what their candidate needed was a bracing dose of utter public humiliation.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday we saw the result: Omega Male.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore couldn't resist a temptation to sidle up to his opponent, to join hands in support of all the goopy generalities Mr. Bush was tossing into the hopper. Among the important points on which Mr. Gore felt compelled to agree:</p>
        <p>*That we should be a humble, but strong, nation.</p>
        <p>*That we ought to get our troops home from the Balkans as soon as we can.</p>
        <p>*That we can't allow ourselves to get overextended.</p>
        <p>*That we should follow the golden rule.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Gore wasn't agreeing, he was trying to explain what he wasn't. The moderator asked him to define the differences between himself and Mr. Bush on gun control. The old, mean Al Gore would have pointed out that he was the only candidate at the table who did not favor allowing people to carry concealed weapons into church. Gore Lite began with, ''Well, I'm not for registration. . . .''</p>
        <p>When the talk turned to pollution, Mr. Gore executed a double-capitulation, managing to simultaneously agree with Mr. Bush and announce that he was not for something. (''He's right that I'm not in favor of energy taxes.'')</p>
        <p>One of Mr. Bush's favorite lines on the Balkans is that the U.S. ought to get ''our European friends to become the peacekeepers.'' He used it twice on Wednesday night. The new Gore was too polite to point out that they already provide more than 80 percent of the troops and 90 percent of the cost of the peacekeeping operation.</p>
        <p>We've had one personality transfer too many in this campaign. No more class brain vs. class clown. Now everybody in the room is shooting for a gentleman's C.</p>
