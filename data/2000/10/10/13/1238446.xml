        <p>Halfway through the presidential debate on Wednesday, after Vice President Al Gore expressed support for hate crimes legislation and cited the 1998 slaying of a black Texas man, James Byrd Jr., the moderator Jim Lehrer turned to Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and asked his views on hate crimes laws.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush did not mince words.</p>
        <p>''We've got one in Texas and guess what,'' he said. ''The three men who -- who murdered James Byrd. Guess what's going to happen to them? They're going to be put to death. A jury found them guilty and -- it's going to be hard to punish them any worse after they get put to death.</p>
        <p>''And it's the right cause so it's the right decision.''</p>
        <p>The moment was noteworthy for two reasons. First, as his campaign later conceded, Mr. Bush had his facts wrong -- two of the three defendants were sentenced to death, the third received life in prison. But by seeming to endorse the executions, he also violated his own policy as Texas governor of maintaining his silence and impartiality about pending death penalty cases until court appeals are exhausted and the cases reach his desk.</p>
        <p>Whether his segue from hate crimes to the death penalty was spontaneous or a calculated response was a matter of speculation today. The Gore campaign accused Mr. Bush of trying to deflect attention from his unwillingness to push for an enhanced 1999 hate crimes bill named for Mr. Byrd that died in the State Senate. And Mr. Byrd's daughter, Renee Mullins, who lobbied Mr. Bush in 1999 to help pass that bill, said in an interview today that the governor pointedly told her that he would not work to do so.</p>
        <p>''I pleaded with him,'' Ms. Mullins recounted of her meeting with Mr. Bush. Ms. Mullins said she did not watch the debate on Wednesday but that she was offended when she learned that Mr. Bush expressed support for hate crimes legislation. ''He's not practicing what he's preaching,'' she said. ''I just went to him last year and he didn't support me. So how could he support one?''</p>
        <p>Dan Bartlett, a Bush campaign spokesman, attributed the governor's inaction on the Byrd bill in 1999 to several factors. He said Mr. Bush often did not get involved with bills that were not part of his own legislative package. He also noted that critics of the Byrd bill, which calls for stiffer penalties for crimes motivated by race, gender, religion and sexual orientation, argued that it might weaken a statute in effect since 1993. That statute says that penalties can be enhanced if a crime is committed out of bias or prejudice, but it does not specify which groups are protected.</p>
        <p>Advocates of the Byrd bill argued that the existing law was too vague.</p>
        <p>''He did not show any leadership,'' said State Senator Rodney Ellis, a Democrat who sponsored the legislation. Mr. Ellis and other Democrats attribute the governor's studious avoidance of the bill to concerns that specifying protections for gays and lesbians would offend Christian conservatives.</p>
        <p>By so bluntly invoking the death penalty, Mr. Bush brought attention to an issue that he had sought to play down in the campaign. Since taking office in 1995, Mr. Bush has presided over 146 executions, including 33 this year, by far the most of any governor in the nation.</p>
        <p>As governor, Mr. Bush's powers to stop an execution are limited. He can grant clemency only with the approval of the state parole board, though he does appoint its members. Otherwise, he can either grant an inmate a 30-day reprieve or approve the execution.</p>
        <p>Critics of the Texas capital punishment system have faulted Mr. Bush for defending a system that executes inmates who are mentally retarded, who committed slayings as juveniles and who, in many cases, have been represented by court-appointed lawyers regarded as inadequate. This year, Mr. Bush has interrupted his campaign to preside over the high-profile execution of Gary Graham, who was convicted of murder on the word of one eyewitness.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush also granted the first reprieve of his tenure to Ricky McGinn to allow additional DNA testing in the case. The tests later confirmed his guilt and Mr. McGinn was subsequently executed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's blunt endorsement of the executions of the defendants in the Byrd case -- even though the appeals process has only begun -- brought a swift response from some legal scholars and other critics who say the comments undermine the legal principle of due process.</p>
        <p>''There has been a thought that he doesn't really take the appellate system seriously,'' said a University of Houston law professor, David Dow, who has represented death row inmates. Of his comments on the Byrd defendants, Mr. Dow said: ''He was celebrating their death sentences. I think even most supporters of the death penalty do not celebrate death sentences. It's a somber event.''</p>
        <p>The seriousness with which Mr. Bush's undertakes his obligations toward the death penalty has been questioned before in the campaign. In an interview in Talk Magazine, Gary Bauer, the conservative who was then a Republican presidential candidate, criticized Mr. Bush for appearing to mock Karla Faye Tucker, the Texas killer of two, for pleading for her life in a television interview. Mr. Bush campaign aides said his comments were misinterpreted. Ms. Tucker was executed in 1998.</p>
        <p>In early March, in a Republican primary debate in Los Angeles, Mr. Bush laughed when a questioner asked about a case in which a Texas lawyer fell asleep while representing an inmate who later received the death penalty. Mr. Bartlett said the response was not laughter but an expression of incredulity at the question. He also said that Mr. Bush regards his review of death cases as ''his most important duty'' and addresses them in a very serious and factual way.</p>
        <p>Julian Bond, chairman of the board of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, yesterday joined Ms. Mullins via a telephone conference call and said the N.A.A.C.P. National Voter Fund would announce a national advertising campaign on Friday to publicize Ms. Mullins's story and bring attention to the issue of hate crimes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bond accused the governor of invoking the sentences in the Byrd case to distract attention from his unwillingness to support the Byrd hate crimes bill.</p>
