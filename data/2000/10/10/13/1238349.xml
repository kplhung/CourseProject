        <p>Vladimir Kramnik chose the same defense yesterday in Game 3 of the Brain Games Network World Chess Championship as he had in the first game Saturday in London, and once again it was good for a draw, but that's where the parallel ends.</p>
        <p>Whereas the first had been a matter of serene technique, this one was laced with agonizing complexities. And Kramnik did not make it easier on himself: in a situation in which he could have made an easy draw, he insisted on making a fight of it, and came close to losing before his madcap complications held up against everthing Kasparov through at him.</p>
        <p>Kramnik thus held his one-point lead, with the score 2-1 in his favor. It takes 8 points to win this best-of-16-games series and take the $1.33 million prize. Game 4 will be played tomorrow.</p>
        <p>Once again Kramnik uses the old-fashioned yet durable Berlin Defense to Kasparov's Ruy Lopez. After 9 . . .  Bd7, he has a compressed formation characteristic of this mode of play. The e5 pawn yields White an advantage in terrrain, but this was insufficient to produce any concrete result for Kasparov in Game 1.</p>
        <p>Through 11 . . . Kc8, the players were following their first game, but now Kasparov omits 12 h3 in favor of 12 Rad1.</p>
        <p>In Game 1, Kramnik kept his queen bishop on the c8/h3 diagonal and later used it in combination with his knight and king rook to set up a barrier against a pawn march with f4 and f5. He now departs from that plan with 14 . . . Bc6.</p>
        <p>After 15 Nf4, it would not be strong for Kramnik to double the white f pawns by 15 . . . Bf3 16 gf. With his queen bishop gone, Kasparov could start his attack with Nh5, Ng3 followed by the thematic f4 and f5.</p>
        <p>Kramnik's 17 . . . Rg8 discourages his opponent from trying a quick breakthrough with 18 e6?! by 18 . . .  fe 19 Ne7 Be7 20 Re6 Bd6 21 Rg6 Bf3 (the time is ripe) 22 gf Raf8.</p>
        <p>After 18 Nf4, Kramnik was pretty much forced to put some juice into his passive position with 18 . . . g5 19 Nh5 Rg6.</p>
        <p>The exchanges with 21 . . . Bf3 22 Rf3 Bf6 23 ef led, after 23 . . . Nc6 24 Rd3 Rf8 25 Re4 Kc8 26 f4 gf 27 Rf4 Re8 28 Bc3 Re2 29 Rf2 Re4, to a situation in which it was extremely difficult for Kasparov to find a way to force his g and h pawns forward to connect with his f6 pawn.</p>
        <p>After 29 Rf2, Kramnik could have drawn with 29 . . . Nd4 30 Bd4 Re1 31 Rf1 Rf1 32 Kf1 cd 33 Rd4 Rf6. In playing 29 . . . Re4, he must have been trying to bamboozle the champion.</p>
        <p>After 40 f7!?, a bloodbath ensued: 40 . . . Nf2 41 Re8 Kd7 42 Rf8 Ke7 43 Rc8 (43 Rd8 Kf7 44 Kf2 c3 does not  work for Kasparov) Kf7 44 Rc7 Ke6 45 Be3 Nd1! 46 Bb6 (46 Rc4? fails against 46 . . . Rg2!) c3.</p>
        <p>After 53 . . . Ke5, Kasparov cannot make progress. If either 54 Kf3 or 54 g3, Kramnik gets a drawn king-and-pawn ending with 53 . . . Rf5.</p>
