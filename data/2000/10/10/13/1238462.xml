        <p>In a highly unusual gesture designed to demonstrate their outrage over the latest Middle East violence, mosques in the New York area will be closed today so that Muslims from across the region can gather at the United Nations building at noon to protest in prayer.</p>
        <p>Mosques, where devout Muslims gather five times a day to pray, rarely ever close.</p>
        <p>In a sign of expectations about the size of the rally, one employer near the United Nations, Pfizer, the pharmaceuticals company, plans to shut its 42nd Street offices for the day.</p>
        <p>''We were advised by the New York Police Department that they are expecting a fair number of demonstrators near Pfizer at 42nd and Second Avenue,'' said Andrew McCormick, a spokesman for the company. ''Fridays this time of year we normally close at 1 p.m., and with that in mind and what the police said, we decided to close the doors.''</p>
        <p>The Police Department yesterday increased security around the city under a special security plan called Operation Bravo, according to a message distributed throughout the Police Department.</p>
        <p>The plan calls for increased security at all government and landmark  buildings, transportation hubs, bridges and tunnels, public utilities and prominent institutions. Security will also be increased at police facilities and what the department called ''sensitive and vulnerable properties,'' including all buildings associated with the Israeli government and the Palestinian authority and Jewish and Muslim meeting places.</p>
        <p>The police reported that a brick was thrown through the window of the Assafa Islamic Center on Allen Street on the Lower East Side at 5:30 a.m. yesterday. They were investigating the crime as a possible bias incident, said Detective John Giammarino, a police spokesman. The police had no suspects, he said.</p>
        <p>On Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn, a street with many Islamic markets, restaurants and houses of worship, Muslims were making plans to be at the United Nations, and talk of the violence between Palestinians and Israelis hung in the air.</p>
        <p>''We are tired and we are angry at the violence we are seeing over there every day,'' said Hamid Nabawy, who owns Fertile Crescent, a Middle Eastern market on Atlantic Avenue. ''The United States, the U.N., they should strongly condemn Israel for what has happened, especially firing bombs on people who have only rocks. That's war.''</p>
        <p>Like Mr. Nabawy, who is Egyptian-American, many of those who pledged to be at today's vigil said they had no biological ties to the Palestinians or to the struggle to create a Palestinian homeland. But as Muslims, they said, they felt a duty to let leaders know how the crisis threatened to sour relations between Arabs and Jews here, and how they disagreed with what they called the United States' blind support of Israel.</p>
        <p>''America cares only for Israel,'' said one man in a group of elderly Muslims as they headed into a restaurant that adjoins the local mosque, Masjid al-Farooq.</p>
        <p>Others said nothing at all, and they pointed instead at a flier announcing the protest, which bore a picture of the bloody Palestinian boy who had been fatally shot in the Gaza strip.</p>
        <p>Some Muslims expressed concern that escalating tensions would lead to hostility against them.</p>
        <p>One man from North Africa said he was sickened by the latest outbreak of violence and feared that the escalating violence would also dredge up stereotypes that Arabs are forced to endure whenever there is trouble in the Middle East or threats of terrorism in America.</p>
        <p>''When the World Trade Center was bombed, people at my job, they asked me if I kept fertilizer at home for bombs,'' he said. ''They thought it was funny, but that's how a lot of people see us, as terrorist, violent people waiting to fight.''</p>
        <p>On Atlantic Avenue, Abdullah Motana stood on the street sipping coffee and trying to decide what he would tell his 10-year-old son.</p>
        <p>''My son, he looks at the news, he sees the Palestinian kids with rocks and the Israelis with guns. He asks me why they are dying,'' said Mr. Motana, 40, who is from Yemen. ''What do I tell him today? I want to tell him that it's wrong,'' he said, referring to the killing of at least two Israeli soldiers by Palestinians rioters at a Palestinian police station. ''But I also want him to know that you can't push people around; they are human.''</p>
        <p>As he walked away, Mr. Motana said he was still not sure what to tell his son or how to cease being angry at Israel and America. The only thing he was certain of, he said, was that his voice would be among those calling on Allah today outside the United Nations.</p>
        <p>''We live here and we respect the rules of America,'' he said. ''All we can do is pray.''</p>
