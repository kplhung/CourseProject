        <p>HERE in rural Norfolk, 120 miles northeast of London and nearly in the North Sea, the weather is cold and overcast. But the rain eases long enough for workers in hard hats to emerge from temporary shelters and return to the job.</p>
        <p>These people are, literally, rebuilding Group Lotus, the British sports-car maker and contract-engineering company whose clients include the world's top automakers. A gleaming technology center and a new, fourth production area have just been finished. New access roads and entrances are under construction. The test track where Lotus hones the universally admired handling of its cars has been updated.</p>
        <p>The growl of the diesel excavator and the grating scream of the oxyacetylene cutter are sounds in an overture for the future of Lotus. The project is not a quick nip-and-tuck in pursuit of instant youth and beauty. The small company is on a path conceived to improve its fundamental business strength. Many in the industry say the changes are long past due.</p>
        <p>After the company's charismatic founder, Colin Chapman, died in 1982, Lotus had a string of owners, none of whom managed to turn it into a commercial success. It led a hand-to-mouth existence, handicapped by staff turnover, changes of strategy and a lack of capital. Lotus's reputation, won on the Grand Prix racetracks of the world, became greater than its reality. General Motors bought the company in 1986, but was glad to bail out eight years later.</p>
        <p>Today, in a post-Empire role reversal, the British company is 80 percent owned by the manufacturer of Malaysia's Proton national car, Perusahaan Otomobil Nasional. The remaining shares are owned by ACBN Holdings, a company registered in Luxembourg and controlled by an Italian entrepreneur, Romano Artioli, who owned Lotus between the regimes of G.M. and Proton.</p>
        <p>Proton, as the company is known, appointed a former British oilman, Chris Knight, as the chief executive of Lotus. Putting an outsider into such an insular, engineering-obsessed company was a bold move, but Mr. Knight and his team introduced new business disciplines and a dose of modernization. Malaysia's economic crisis in the late 1990's delayed the ambitious restructuring plans, but in June Lotus completed the first year of its five-year business makeover.</p>
        <p>The chief operating officer, Graham Peel, insists that everything is on track. Sales, profits, production and employment have all risen, and will continue to do so, he predicts. ''We've done a good job letting the spirit out of the box,'' he said during a tour.</p>
        <p>Lotus's plans for a rebirth include building the capacity to make 10,000 cars a year. That may not sound like many in Detroit, but it is three times the current level and more than twice Lotus's record production, in 1969. As recently as 1993, annual output had sunk to only 320 cars.</p>
        <p>The decline has been partly because the company's mainstay, the Esprit, is saddled with a chassis that dates to 1975, and had only, until four years ago, a turbocharged four-cylinder engine. In addition, the company's quality problems were so legendary that cynics said the company's name was short for ''Lots of Trouble, Usually Serious.'' Well-heeled potential customers turned to marques like Ferrari, which continually updates and fine tunes its models.</p>
        <p>The second-generation Elan, released under G.M.'s ownership, was a commercial failure. Much was expected of the Elan, an Isuzu-powered front-drive roadster, but it was late to market, of dubious quality and costly to build. It was abruptly withdrawn in 1992, only four years after its introduction.</p>
        <p>Still, Lotus scored a big hit in 1996 with its Elise, which has been a runaway success -- with sales quadrupling the original forecasts -- even though it was never certified for export to the United States. The Elise is expected to account for a third of Lotus's expanded production capacity.</p>
        <p>Lotus aficionados love the midengine Elise, a tiny, lightweight, minimal roadster with a clever chassis made of bonded extrusions -- formed by squeezing aluminum alloy into specific shapes. To them, it embodies the spirit of Chapman, an aeronautical engineer who achieved success after World War II by making and racing his own cars. He remains widely revered by sports-car lovers for his diminutive, nimble cars with names like Super 7, Elite and Europa that set a standard for affordable performance in the 50's, 60's and 70's.</p>
        <p>The Elise's popularity was spotted by G.M., which was looking for an eye-catching model to spice up its stodgy image in Europe. G.M. commissioned Lotus to transform the Elise into the Opel Speedster, a new model that went into production here this fall alongside the Elise. In Britain, G.M.'s car is called the Vauxhall VX220.</p>
        <p>The G.M. contract will fill another third of the new capacity. The remaining third will be taken up by a production version of the Lotus M250 coupe, a design study shown at the Frankfurt auto show in 1999.</p>
        <p>The M250 will go on sale at the end of 2001 or early 2002. It, too, is being developed around the same aluminum chassis concept, but will use an unspecified 2.5-liter V-6 rather than the Elise's small-displacement four-cylinder, a Rover design.</p>
        <p>Will the M250 move Lotus more seriously back to the American market, where its current annual sales amount to only about 100 Esprit V-8 coupes? Mr. Peel is circumspect. ''We'd love M250 to go to the States,'' he said. ''And we're working at the moment to confirm that it could be done.'' There is also speculation that the next-generation Elise will come to the United States.</p>
        <p>Proton says another Elise spinoff -- a coupe it is calling PU, for Proton Ultimate -- will be made in Malaysia. Lotus says its order book for the engineering contract work it does on behalf of other automakers is also healthy, though confidentiality agreements with its clients prevent it from naming specific examples. Mr. Peel says Lotus is working on 50 projects for 33 automakers or their suppliers.</p>
        <p>The new design and engineering center is part of the drive to win additional work. So were the recent purchases of small engineering companies in England and Michigan. Now, Lotus is looking for further specialist companies to buy, because consolidation in the automotive sector is driving up demand for its engineering services.</p>
        <p>Can a tiny car and technology company, founded in England, owned by Malaysians and run by a former oilman, compete in an increasingly overcrowded car market? All this expansion and reconstruction adds up to some of the most significant changes at Lotus since it was founded in 1951. The company is used to upheaval, but for the first time in years, the unfailing optimism usually found at Lotus is complemented by some real confidence in its future.</p>
