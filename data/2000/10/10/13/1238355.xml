        <p>A powerful car bomb exploded in the center of Grozny, the Chechen capital, today, killing a dozen or more people and wounding more than 20, hospital and police authorities said.</p>
        <p>The bomb, loaded into a military-style Russian jeep, exploded in front of a migration office run by Russia's Interior Ministry just after 10 a.m.</p>
        <p>The explosion, which killed at least seven people outright, set off a chaotic scene, according to witnesses, who said that police officials scrambled to load the wounded into civilian cars and rush them to Grozny's only functioning hospital. Power and equipment shortages there prevented medical personnel from treating some of the wounded for hours.</p>
        <p>The bomb attack was among the worst terrorist acts this year in the bomb-scarred Chechen capital.</p>
        <p>''We are sure that this explosion was aimed against civilians because the car carrying the bomb was parked next to the police department that was handing out Russian passports to civilians,'' said Gen. Nikolai Getman, deputy commander of Russian forces in Chechnya.</p>
        <p>When the smoke cleared, witnesses said, the street was littered with shrapnel, torn cars and bodies.</p>
        <p>''There were so many people lying in the street covered with blood that I shouted, 'What are you waiting for, we've got to get these people to the hospital,' '' said Suleyman Gemayev, a Chechen police officer who commandeered vehicles for ambulance service.</p>
        <p>Twenty-one people with serious shrapnel wounds went to the hospital, said the deputy medical director, Abdullah Ismailov. By late afternoon, he said, nine people had died. The hospital death toll may not have included as many as seven victims who died immediately, officials said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Ismailov said some victims were forced to wait on blood-soaked stretchers at the hospital, which has only one functioning operating theater. One of the hospital's respirators also broke down today.</p>
