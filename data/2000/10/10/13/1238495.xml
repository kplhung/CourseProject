        <p>You don't have to think that Jules Olitski is ''the best painter alive,'' as an unrepentant Clement Greenberg did as late as 1990, to appreciate his current show. Mr. Olitski, who has exhibited since 1951, has never given up on Color Field painting, the art movement that Greenberg promoted as the rightful heir to Abstract Expressionism; but he has made it quirkier, more complicated and, well, less Greenbergian. (So, in more slapstick fashion, has Larry Poons.)</p>

        <p>Ameringer Howard</p>
        <p>41 East 57th Street</p>
        <p>Through Oct. 21</p>
        <p>You don't have to think that Jules Olitski is ''the best painter alive,'' as an unrepentant Clement Greenberg did as late as 1990, to appreciate his current show. Mr. Olitski, who has exhibited since 1951, has never given up on Color Field painting, the art movement that Greenberg promoted as the rightful heir to Abstract Expressionism; but he has made it quirkier, more complicated and, well, less Greenbergian. (So, in more slapstick fashion, has Larry Poons.)</p>
        <p>While Greenberg may have almost single-handedly made ''decorative'' an accolade for postwar abstract painting, one wonders if he would have sanctioned a level of decorativeness that evokes Tiffany's favrile glass, Gustave Moreau (without the people) and Vincent Augustus Tack. Especially when combined with a sense of unleashed nature and flamboyant spatial illusion more usual to J. M. W. Turner and Frederic Edwin Church.</p>
        <p>They are all here in the opulent, often iridescent colors, surface cracklings and convulsive spatial drama (complete with occasional meteorlike chunks) of these paintings. The worst works have a Hollywood gaudiness; and there is a high frequency of attenuated lines echoing the canvas's edges -- in several paintings are a worn-out Olitski device and perhaps an attempt to placate Greenberg's ghost.</p>
        <p>But see this show anyway. Color Field painting has been scorned long enough to be a fairly active ingredient in what might be called, only half jokingly, the abstract painting underground. Mr. Olitski is simultaneously degrading and expanding its premise with unabashed flair.</p>
