        <p>There's an opportunity to do serious one-stop shopping today at Sotheby's. In fact, Americana fans could fill an entire house with these pedigreed treasures of American furniture.</p>
        <p>Sotheby's ''Important Americana'' sale today includes several lots from the collection of the late Dr. William S. Serri, a renowned collector from Woodbury, N.J. Of special note are a Queen Anne mahogany pie-crust tea table from Philadelphia, circa 1750; a Chippendale mahogany bonnet-top chest-on-chest made in the Boston area, circa 1775; a Chippendale mahogany drop-leaf table with carved claw-and-ball feet from New York, circa 1765; and a Chippendale mahogany dressing table from Philadelphia, circa 1765.</p>

        <p>There's an opportunity to do serious one-stop shopping today at Sotheby's. In fact, Americana fans could fill an entire house with these pedigreed treasures of American furniture.</p>
        <p>Sotheby's ''Important Americana'' sale today includes several lots from the collection of the late Dr. William S. Serri, a renowned collector from Woodbury, N.J. Of special note are a Queen Anne mahogany pie-crust tea table from Philadelphia, circa 1750; a Chippendale mahogany bonnet-top chest-on-chest made in the Boston area, circa 1775; a Chippendale mahogany drop-leaf table with carved claw-and-ball feet from New York, circa 1765; and a Chippendale mahogany dressing table from Philadelphia, circa 1765.</p>
        <p>Mr. Serri's dressing table has twice passed through Israel Sack, the renowned New York gallery. It appeared on the cover of Albert Sack's 1950 classic, ''The Fine Points of Furniture,'' a book commonly known as ''Good, Better, Best,'' where the table was described as ''a masterpiece of Colonial design and craftsmanship.'' The dressing table has a deeply carved shell drawer, claw feet and a fine patina. It is estimated to sell from $150,000 to $250,000.</p>
        <p>John B. A. Nye, a Sotheby's specialist in American furniture, said the Queen Anne tea table was ''earlier and therefore rarer than the Chippendale pieces and is in a remarkable state of preservation.''</p>
        <p>He pointed out that the underside of its carved claw feet still bore the scribe marks from the cabinetmaker. ''This is unheard of,'' he said. ''The feet never touched a floor. They were protected by castors.''</p>
        <p>He also pointed out that the table had an inverted baluster on its base. ''There are only a handful of such tables known,'' he added. The estimate is $150,000 to $250,000.</p>
        <p>Buying in Lyon</p>
        <p>When it comes to antiques dealing, Paris has attitude. Lyon doesn't. Paris is formal. Lyon is friendly. Paris is brainy. Lyon is down to earth. This approachable style -- and better prices -- may explain why many American dealers buy so much of their stock in Lyon and ship it home by container.</p>
        <p>Today is the opening of the 10th Salon des Antiquaires (through Sunday), an antiques fair sponsored by the 130 dealers in Lyon's Cite des Antiquaires, a permanent building on Boulevard Stalingrad that was designed as a pristine contemporary setting for antiques by the decorator Jean-Michel de Ambroggia.</p>
        <p>The city of Lyon has been accumulating antiques since it was founded in 43 B.C. as Lugdunum (''hill of the ravens''). It became the capital of Gaul and the western Roman Empire and was a trading port because of its position at the junction of the Rhone and Saone Rivers. (It retains a 4,000-seat Roman amphitheater and a Gallo-Roman museum filled with Lyon's own Roman bronze and marble statues and mosaics.)</p>
        <p>In the Middle Ages, Catholics making pilgrimages to Santiago de Compostela in Spain passed through Lyons, a crossroads near what are now the Swiss, Italian and German borders. The area around Lyon did not become part of France until 1275, when its citizens called on the French king for protection.</p>
        <p>The king granted the city certain privileges, including a tax exemption for furniture makers. By the time of the Renaissance, the city was a major trade center brimming with local vintners, Italian bankers and silk traders and German printers. Vieux Lyon, its Renaissance district, retains its imposing 14th-, 15th- and 16th-century buildings with 20-foot ceilings supported by elaborately painted beams.</p>
        <p>The evidence of this early wealth is on display in the antiques shops. The city has more than 300 dealers. The fall season opens early in October with an evening open house for 15,000 guests that is sponsored by the galleries straddling the Rue Auguste Comte. The street, like Madison Avenue, is in one of the best neighborhoods, with chic fashion boutiques. Unlike Madison Avenue, it has dealers who refuse to be squeezed out. Most of them have kept the same addresses for 50 years.</p>
        <p>Lyon has been famous for its furniture since 1500, especially imposing pieces with carved busts and Renaissance motifs.</p>
        <p>Bernard Vernay, a veteran dealer on Auguste Comte who works with his wife, Guillemette Chantrel, originally trained as a woodworker. ''You need 12 years to understand the formation of furniture,'' he said. ''Most early Lyonnais antiques are walnut and can be easily identified by their craftsmanship, motifs and sheer heft. They also have local gray and black marble from St. Cyr.''</p>
        <p>''The antiques of Lyon are imposing, not ostentatious,'' Mr. Vernay added. In his shop, which has Louis XIV carved oak paneling on the walls and a 17th-century oak and walnut parquet de Versailles floor, he is selling a large mid-18th-century three-drawer walnut commode whose front is meant to have the shape of an archer's bow. The piece is both deeper and higher than a normal chest of drawers.</p>
        <p>''Such an object is rare,'' Mr. Vernay said. ''An owner then or now would not treat it like part of an ensemble but as a precious object.'' The price is a bit over $9,000, a fraction of what it would cost in Paris.</p>
        <p>''That's why so many Paris dealers shop here,'' Ms. Chantrel said.</p>
        <p>Lyon is also known for its large architectural carved armoires from the 16th century. The motifs, caryatids, eagles and arabesques, were inspired by Renaissance engravings. As Edith Mannoni wries in ''Mobilier Lyonnais'' (Editions Massin, 1995): ''The decoration of such furniture was more like graphic art than sculpture. It looks like engraving on wood.''</p>
        <p>Gerard Rigot, a dealer at the Cite, is selling a tall walnut armoire from the beginning of the 17th century. It is a massive cupboard with flattened bun feet and large paneled doors adorned with small sculptured heads of a mother and child. Above them is an eagle, a symbol of Lyon that invokes Rome and the Pope as well as  the German empire that identified with Rome's victorious legions, whose emblem was the eagle.</p>
        <p>The insides of the doors and the sides are lined with a red fabric decorated with a pattern of crisscrossed silver braid. It is as nice as, or nicer than, the German armoires and cupboards made between 1500 and 1700 that are part of Sotheby's sale of overflow from German nobles' ''Ancestral Attics'' (through tomorrow) in Stuttgart.</p>
        <p>Finally, the big surprise in Lyon is its Art Deco furniture, whose stars are Christian Krass, Andre Sornay and Maison Chaleyssin. Alain Lavaud, for example, specializes in Lyonnais Deco (Web site: www.cite-antiquaires.fr/hadrien). His antiques may resemble those designed by Jean-Michel Frank but they are far more reasonably priced. He just sold a 10-piece Andre Krass dining room of Brazilian rosewood, including table, 10 chairs and sideboard, for $10,000. He currently has a Chaleyssin white oak commode for about $3,000.</p>
