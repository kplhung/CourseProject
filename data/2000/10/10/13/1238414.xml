        <p>Facing falling sales in Europe and stiff competition in the United States, General Motors said yesterday that its third-quarter profit dropped 5.5 percent, but its per-share earnings topped analysts' expectations by a penny.</p>
        <p>The company, however, warned that fourth-quarter earnings might fall short of analysts' forecasts.</p>
        <p>Over all, G.M. earnings were $829 million, or $1.55 a share in the quarter, down from $877 million, or $1.33, in the third quarter of 1999. Analysts had expected G.M. to earn $1.54 a share.</p>
        <p>Sales were $42.6 billion, down slightly from $42.8 billion last year.</p>
        <p>In trading yesterday, G.M. stock fell $1.25, to $57.38, a 2.1 percent drop.</p>
        <p>With auto sales in the United States, the most important market for General Motors, running at a record pace so far this year, the company's results were disappointing, analysts said.</p>
        <p>General Motors' market share in North America and Europe continues to fall, and it expects to cut  production in the United States slightly in the fourth quarter compared with the period in 1999.</p>
        <p>At the same time, the company's  inventories of unsold cars and light trucks in the United States crept up in the third quarter, reaching 105 days for trucks, compared with 82 days in 1999. Higher inventories can signal that General Motors is overestimating consumer interest in its vehicles and will have to increase rebates to spur demand, analysts said.</p>
        <p>''G.M.'s a lot better company than it used to be, but it's having a hard time keeping up with meaningfully improving competitors,'' said John Casesa, an auto analyst for Merrill Lynch.</p>
        <p>After the earnings report, a Lehman Brothers analyst, Nicholas Lobaccoro, cut his rating on General Motors to neutral from outperform.</p>
        <p>The company said slow sales in Germany and falling prices in Britain accounted for most of its problems in Europe, where it lost $181 million, compared with a profit of $32 million for the same period last year. In North America, G.M. earned $728 million, up from $671 million in 1999.</p>
        <p>G.M. has been under heavy pressure to raise its stock price, especially since August, when the investor Carl C. Icahn said that he might buy as much as 15 percent of the company. Mr. Icahn, who has a history of forcing change on companies with lagging share prices, later said he had abandoned his plans to take a meaningful stake in G.M. but did not rule out returning in the future.</p>
        <p>Earnings at General Motors reflected continuing ''cost reduction,'' said John Finnegan, G.M.'s acting chief financial officer. Mr. Finnegan said the company closely monitored its inventories and believed they were not too high. ''The dealers -- there's no reason they'd be ordering the trucks if they thought they had too many,'' he said.</p>
        <p>General Motors did not explicitly warn that its fourth-quarter profit would fall short of estimates. But it told analysts to expect a ''significant loss'' from its European division in the fourth quarter, compared with a $30 million profit in Europe in the period in 1999. At the same time, the company said its profits in North America and elsewhere were likely to be little changed for the fourth quarter. In addition, it said per-share earnings for all of 2000 would exceed those of 1999.</p>
        <p>That is conservative guidance. So far this year, General Motors has earned $4.3 billion, or $7.37 a share. As of yesterday, analysts expected General Motors to earn an additional $2.43 a share in the fourth quarter, according to IBES International, which tracks earnings estimates.</p>
        <p>In comparison, before some minor one-time charges, G.M. earned $5.7 billion, or $8.62 a share, in 1999, when it had more shares outstanding. So General Motors could earn as little as $1.25 a share in the fourth quarter of 2000 -- barely half of what analysts are estimating -- and still meet its public projections. Mr. Casesa cut his fourth-quarter earnings estimate last week to $1.75 a share from $2.55. Now he worries that even his revised estimate might be too high, he said.</p>
        <p>''There's clearly a decline in earnings going forward for the fourth quarter,'' said David Bradley of J. P. Morgan Securities. ''There seems to be one big issue that overwhelms all of the other issues generally, and that's Europe.'' Mr. Bradley said the European auto market, where G.M. has almost 15 percent of its sales, suffered from overcapacity, declining prices and high labor costs.</p>
        <p>''It used to be that the Europeans could charge 15 percent more for a car, and I would say they're now at parity,'' Mr. Bradley said. ''And costs haven't declined 15 percent.''</p>
