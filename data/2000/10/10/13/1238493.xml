        <p>Night has a magic that daylight will never have.

        <p>Robert Mann Gallery</p>
        <p>210 11th Avenue, near 25th Street</p>

        <p>Night has a magic that daylight will never have. The clamor stilled, the streets empty, the enveloping darkness all connive with the glow of ever-burning lights to soften and bring enchanting geometric shapes to a black-and-white world. Michael Kenna has long taken advantage of the gifts that the late hours offer a photographer. Here he deploys the long exposure and the resulting spectrum of amazing blacks and grays to show the otherworldly, romantic appeal of night.</p>
        <p>In ''The Rouge, Study No. 105, Dearborn, Michigan'' (1995), a cargo ship looks as if it were sheathed in silvery gray scales. The top half of ''Log and Plane, Boca Raton, Florida'' (1992) is an unremitting black, the bottom half a stark white dissolving mistily into gray and black. In the top half a sliver of gray marks the horizon, a plane leaving an L-shaped streak of light in the inky sky. In the bottom half, just below the plane's streak, a log leans into the mistily inchoate water.</p>
        <p>Of special note is Mr. Kenna's series on the vaguely hourglass form of power station towers. More images in this series are in the book ''Michael Kenna: Night Work'' (Nazraeli Press with the Friends of Photography). Under cover of darkness, these towers, simultaneously beautiful and menacing, take on a life of their own.</p>
        <p>In one image they loom like black columns against a light gray sky, the towers stalwart straight, the smoke they emit whooshing away at a uniformly sharp angle. In another picture the towers throw caution to the winds, wildly emitting circular puffs of smoke. In a third the seemingly fragile towers off in the distance release furiously big bursts of smoke into the black sky. Night cloaks the bulky three towers in ''Didcot Power Station, Study 1, Oxfordshire, England'' (1989) in elegant shades of gray, their curvy stateliness offset by three lamps marching toward them wrapped in thin, right-angled rectitude.</p>
