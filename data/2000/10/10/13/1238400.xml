        <p>At a grocery store tonight, watching televised scenes of the killing of two Israeli soldiers and the helicopter strikes in Ramallah, Chaim Bachar's old misgivings about peace with the Palestinians came flooding back.</p>
        <p>''The truth is that I never really trusted Yasir Arafat,'' said Mr. Bachar, 50. ''I think what happened was that when he faced the prospect of signing an agreement he decided to run amok, like someone getting cold feet at a wedding.''</p>
        <p>As the escalating Israeli-Palestinian violence seemed to move to the brink of war today, Israelis of all political persuasions appeared united in revulsion at the mob killing of their soldiers, but divided as ever about what should be done about it.</p>
        <p>Outside the Defense Ministry in Tel Aviv this evening, leftist protesters shouted: ''One, two, three, four, we don't want another war'' while rightists urged Prime Minister Ehud Barak to ''shell Ramallah.'' In Jerusalem a group of youths roamed the streets shouting ''Death to Arabs'' and ''We want revenge.''</p>
        <p>With the country in turmoil, many liberal Israelis seemed to be re-examining long-held convictions that peace with the Palestinians was within reach, while conservatives, who never trusted Mr. Arafat, said they felt vindicated.</p>
        <p>''There has been a huge break, a catastrophe, and this is the deepest down I can remember since the Oslo accords,'' said Janet Aviad, a leader of the Peace Now movement.</p>
        <p>Naomi Chazan, a member of Parliament from the leftist Meretz Party, said she had been fielding anguished telephone calls from her constituents. ''The initial reaction to the lynching was absolute horror. It was absolutely chilling,'' she said. ''As long as this continues, the number of those who have trust in the peace process is constantly dwindling.''</p>
        <p>Amos Oz, an internationally renowned author and for years an authoritative voice of Israeli doves, acknowledged in an interview this week that after two weeks of violent Palestinian unrest, his perspective was changing.</p>
        <p>''I have remained unshaken about the necessity and even the urgency of ending the conflict, and I think it can be done,'' Mr. Oz said. ''What is somewhat shaken within me is the assumption that Mr. Arafat and his colleagues are as eager as we are to reach any solution at all. He may be quite happy to remain a Che Guevara rather than becoming a Fidel Castro and dealing all day with sewage, drugs, corruption and inflation.''</p>
        <p>Shlomo Lahat, a dovish former general who heads a pro-peace lobby of retired army officers, said that he no longer believed that Israel could do business with Mr. Arafat.</p>
        <p>''I fear that we don't have a partner in him,'' Mr. Lahat said, adding that he was sure that the wave of Palestinian unrest was organized by Mr. Arafat ''to escape a political decision'' on peace.</p>
        <p>At Psagot, a Jewish settlement overlooking Ramallah, where homes have been hit several times by Palestinian gunfire in recent days, soldiers in a sandbagged trench hunkered down in bulletproof vests and helmets, preparing for possible gunbattles after dark. Residents stayed in their homes after nightfall, and traffic to and from the settlement was stopped.</p>
        <p>This was a war foretold, the settlers said. ''It was clear that this was coming because we know the hatred around us,'' said Meir Diamant, whose home had been hit. ''The fact that two leaders sign an agreement solves nothing. The hatred was bound to lead to an explosion, and it has come. And if we have to live by the sword, we will.''</p>
