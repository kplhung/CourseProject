        <p>Salander-O'Reilly Galleries</p>
        <p>20 East 79th Street</p>
        <p>Through Nov. 18</p>
        <p>Although Rembrandt never visited Italy, he had plenty of close-up contact with Venetian painting thanks to Amsterdam's 17th-century position as a bustling art center. The Venetian leanings in his later paintings have long been pointed out by art historians but less often demonstrated in specific examples.</p>
        <p>But the topic is more suited to a museum presentation; this small but overly ambitious gallery show does not really make the case. It mounts only a dozen paintings, including three by Rembrandt and one labeled ''Studio of Rembrandt,'' and oils by Titian, Tintoretto and Veronese, some religious, some secular.</p>
        <p>Still, any show that has the great Rembrandt ''Flora'' (circa 1654), borrowed from the Metropolitan Museum of Art, has to have a certain aura. There is also a kind of discovery here, a handsome but little-known Titian, ''Portrait of Francesco Duodo'' (possibly mid-1560's to early 1570's) on loan from French &amp; Co., the New York dealer, which recently purchased it at a Sotheby's auction in London.</p>
        <p>The Venetian influences on Rembrandt -- particularly those of Titian, Giorgione and Tintoretto -- are discussed in the show's catalog by Sir Kenneth Clark (1903-1983) and by David Rosand, professor of art history at Columbia University. Professor Rosand's contribution was written for the catalog; Sir Kenneth's is from a lecture he gave in 1964.</p>
        <p>But the show is also distractingly engaged in underscoring the attribution of Titian to the Duodo portrait. That is the subject of a third catalog essay, by Frederick Ilcham, a student of Professor Rosand who is preparing a Ph.D. dissertation on Tintoretto at Columbia. One could, in fact, be led to think that the entire exhibition was built around an effort to promote the Titian.</p>
        <p>''Flora'' provides the most salient example here of Venice in Rembrandt. A portrait of his companion, Hendrickje Stoffels, as the personification of Spring, the work was almost certainly affected by Titian and company, as seen in the looser and more daring application of paint. The smooth, finished brushwork of his earlier period gave way to much rougher surfaces thickly smeared with palette knife and finger. The work became less about illusion and more about the ''materiality of paint,'' writes Professor Rosand.</p>
        <p>In this breathtaking half-length image, Hendrickje's head is turned in one direction. She wears a filmy, frilly white blouse and yellow skirt and a black hat adorned with rose leaves, and in her right hand is a clutch of buds.</p>
        <p>While the portrait is built up solidly of paint, brilliantly worked and manipulated into folds and draperies and broad frontal planes, it has a magical lightness that comes from translucent layers of color. The body that shapes the clothes is robustly suggested beneath them, but the figure has an ethereality that defies the weight of paint. Unlike an earlier Titian version of Flora, sensuous and voluptuous, which Rembrandt obviously studied, this one has a kind of classical eloquence. A metaphor for spring, she is also very much the person Rembrandt loved.</p>
        <p>While the show has other interesting paintings, notably Rembrandt's ''Young Man in a Black Beret'' (1666) and Tintoretto's ''Raising of Lazarus'' (1573), a composition notable for its deployment of sinuous, writhing bodies, it is too small and catch-as-catch-can to be a substantial demonstration of Venice's impact on Rembrandt. Apart from ''Flora,'' whatever you learn about that is largely from reading the catalog.</p>
