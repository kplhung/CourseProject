        <p>At dusk, after the Israeli air attacks on targets in Gaza, a four-car convoy began making its way through the dusty side streets to inspect the damage.</p>
        <p>At the sites where Israeli rockets had plowed into a police headquarters, a power station and a guard post, just 150 yards from Yasir Arafat's beachside headquarters, the cars halted.</p>
        <p>Mr. Arafat, a leader who is often noted more for his absence on these streets, climbed out with a small retinue of bodyguards. He surveyed the damage, a pistol hanging on his hip, and acknowledged with smiles the expressions of support from those in the crowd. He ended his tour in Shifa Hospital, where the four people wounded in the attack were being tended.</p>
        <p>''The Palestinian people can take this,'' he said defiantly. ''We will continue our march to Jerusalem, the capital of the independent Palestinian state.''</p>
        <p>''It was good to see him at a time like this,'' said a police officer, Lt. Ehab Sahar, 29, as he cradled a snub-nosed machine gun across his stomach. ''We were all shaken by this attack. We are nervous, waiting for the next blow. And we all know another blow is coming. We are looking to President Arafat to help us rally and fight back.''</p>
        <p>The streets in the center of the city erupted at nightfall when thousands of youths, calling on the militant Islamic group Hamas to avenge the attacks, flooded down the main avenue.</p>
        <p>Faces were contorted with rage as the crowd, waving green Islamic banners, pushed, shoved, spat and shouted.</p>
        <p>''This is so painful for us,'' said Samil Aloushas, 20, as he stood bare-chested in the street with a group of friends. ''The world has left us powerless. We do not have these tanks, these missiles and these helicopters. How can we fight back? Yet we must.</p>
        <p>''We must defend Jerusalem from attack. All we have to sacrifice is ourselves. Everyone here is ready to do this. We are a nation now of suicide bombers. This is what the Israelis have done to us.''</p>
        <p>Palestinian security men in green uniforms hugged the sides of the streets. Many, especially near the border with Israel, lay crouched in clusters of scrub along the roadsides.</p>
        <p>Palestinian officials said Israel had warned them to evacuate certain buildings in Gaza and Ramallah. They said nearly all official buildings were empty at the time of the attack.</p>
        <p>The strikes came shortly after Mr. Arafat finished a meeting with George J. Tenet, director of central intelligence, who had come from Washington to try to work out security arrangements to quell the violence.</p>
        <p>Palestinian guards opened the door of the main prison in Gaza, freeing scores of criminals and Hamas activists.</p>
        <p>Sheik Ahmed Yassin, the spiritual leader of Hamas, promised revenge for the Israeli attacks, saying in a statement that his followers would ''spare no effort to retaliate for this aggression.''</p>
        <p>Palestinian leaders also said that should another strike come, they expected that it would be directed at the television building in Gaza City. The station in Ramallah was blasted today. Israeli officials have said the Palestinian radio and television is ''inciting the violence.''</p>
        <p>Hashim Miki, the head of Palestinian television in Gaza, said he had already begun to make plans should such a strike occur.</p>
        <p>''They can hit our radio and television building,'' he said, ''but they can not take us off the air. We have other ways of broadcasting and we will use them. This is a war now and one of the major instruments in any war is propaganda.''</p>
