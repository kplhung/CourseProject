        <p>Gov. Christine Todd Whitman said yesterday that she had no formal, factual information that some New Jersey troopers had engaged in racial profiling against black and Hispanic drivers until she received a report about the practice from the attorney general's office in April 1999.</p>

        <p>Gov. Christine Todd Whitman said yesterday that she had no formal, factual information that some New Jersey troopers had engaged in racial profiling against black and Hispanic drivers until she received a report about the practice from the attorney general's office in April 1999.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Whitman was responding to articles yesterday in The New York Times and The Record of Hackensack about newly released police records that show police officials had evidence of widespread profiling on the New Jersey Turnpike as early as 1996, three years before the state  acknowledged that troopers were singling out minority drivers for traffic stops and searches.</p>
        <p>The Times's article said the documents showed that despite the evidence of profiling in 1996, senior state police commanders rejected aggressive measures to halt the problem, instead pursuing a strategy of limiting the information provided to federal civil rights prosecutors.</p>
        <p>At a news conference yesterday in Trenton, Mrs. Whitman said the report she received in 1999 left her frustrated, disappointed and angry because she had previously put her ''credibility on the line'' and denied the existence of the practice, despite a litany of complaints in the mid-1990's from civil rights leaders, black ministers and legislators, and minority drivers and their lawyers.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Whitman said she ''didn't ever receive any kind of factual basis for backing up'' those complaints until her attorney general at the time, Peter G. Verniero, issued a report acknowledging that the practice took place.</p>
        <p>Yesterday's news articles told of a meeting in January 1997 in which Mr. Verniero and high-ranking New Jersey police officials discussed a strategy to limit the amount of data about profiling that the state would submit to investigators from the federal Justice Department's civil rights division. A month earlier, the division had opened an investigation into profiling.</p>
        <p>The news articles said that according to an internal state police document, a decision was reached at the meeting to restrict the information to be surrendered to the Justice Department to reports about searches of drivers conducted by troopers from only two stations -- Moorestown and Cranbury -- on the southern half of the turnpike. The articles said the overwhelming majority of drivers searched by those troopers were members of minority groups.</p>
        <p>Participants in the 1997 meeting included Mr. Verniero, now a justice on New Jersey's Supreme Court, and the head of the state police at the time, Col. Carl A. Williams.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Whitman said the news articles reaffirmed her belief that Mr. Williams was in ''very strong denial'' about the existence of racial profiling. As for Mr. Verniero, she said he addressed profiling in testimony before the State Senate's Judiciary Committee in April and May of 1999. Those hearings dealt both with profiling and Mr. Verniero's confirmation to the Supreme Court.</p>
        <p>In one of the hearings, Mr. Verniero said the potential existence of profiling had ''crystallized'' in his mind only after a much-publicized shooting on the turnpike in April 1998. In that incident, two troopers stopped a van containing four unarmed New York City men -- three of them black and one Hispanic -- and fired several shots inside because, they said, the vehicle had moved backward after the stop and they feared for their lives. Three of the men were seriously wounded.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Whitman was not asked about the January 1997 meeting during yesterday's news conference.  But asked whether she thought Mr. Verniero had provided her all the information she felt she was entitled to receive, she mentioned his responses to senators' questions about racial profiling during the 1999 hearings. ''He answered them in the fashion that he has always answered questions, which was honestly and straightforwardly,'' she said.</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman for the State Supreme Court said yesterday that Mr. Verniero would not comment on the news articles.</p>
        <p>But the Rev. Reginald T. Jackson, the head of the New Jersey Black Ministers Council, which represents about 600 churches, said he believed  Mr. Verniero was obligated in early 1997 to share with the governor the racial profiling information that the articles said he had at that time. ''It must be asked if the governor would have appointed him to the state's highest court if she knew what he knew,'' Mr. Jackson said in a statement. ''Just as importantly, it must be asked if he deserves to remain on the court in light of the information he withheld and did not act on.''</p>
        <p>The Justice Department's investigation lasted three years. Last December, the state agreed to ban profiling and overhaul training and supervision of the 2,700 members of the state police. Two federal monitors  commended the police force last week for its initial effort.</p>
        <p>The Justice Department would not comment yesterday on the news reports of the decision to limit the amount of profiling data investigators would receive. Kara Peterman, a spokeswoman for the department's civil rights division, said the department had never served the attorney general's office a subpoena specifying surrender of specific documents.</p>
        <p>Chuck Davis, a spokesman for New Jersey's current attorney general, John J. Farmer Jr., said the investigators were satisfied with the state's giving them profiling data from the two state police stations on the southern stretch of the turnpike.</p>
