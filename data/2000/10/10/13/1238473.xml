        <p>Representative Bob Franks, the Republican candidate for Senate from New Jersey, kept Jon S. Corzine on the defensive today throughout their second debate as he continued to accuse Mr. Corzine of trying to buy the election and of advocating big-government spending programs that the nation can ill afford.</p>
        <p>The hourlong encounter touched briefly  on such subjects as energy policy, the crisis in the Middle East and racial profiling. But it kept coming back, in one way or another, to the subject of Mr. Corzine's money: what he has spent so far as a candidate, why he declines to release his personal tax returns and how much his ambitious proposals in the areas of health care and education would cost.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine, a multimillionaire who spent $35 million in the Democratic primary alone, has dealt with these questions for months, and he parried each of Mr. Franks's thrusts today with a familiar response. He said New Jersey voters cared about candidates' ideas, not how much they spent. He said he was prevented from releasing his tax returns by a binding agreement he signed while an executive at Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company. And he said Mr. Franks had grossly distorted the costs of his proposals.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Franks, who has been hamstrung by a lack of money for statewide television commercials, nonetheless made the most of his time before the cameras, belittling Mr. Corzine as ''fiscally confused,'' calling his ideas ''dangerous'' and frequently addressing him only as ''Jon.''</p>
        <p>From the outset, Mr. Franks sought to turn Mr. Corzine's overwhelming financial advantage against him. ''My friend and opponent Mr. Corzine has no public record,'' he said. ''But what he has is money. Lots of money.''</p>
        <p>At one point Mr. Franks, his voice full of mock sincerity, artfully indicted Mr. Corzine in the guise of defending his right to spend freely on his campaign.</p>
        <p>''I have absolutely no objection to Jon taking his enormous personal wealth and trying to buy a seat in the United States Senate,'' Mr. Franks said, lingering over every word.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Franks went on to assert that Mr. Corzine's record-shattering campaign spending made it even more important for him to release his tax returns. ''Now, folks, this is an issue of trust,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''Is it more important to protect a small group of people at Goldman Sachs,'' Mr. Franks said, referring to Mr. Corzine's confidentiality agreement with the firm, ''or is it more important to win the confidence and trust of the eight million people who are proud to call New Jersey their home? Mr. Corzine should find a way to make this information available to the people of New Jersey. And if he can't, I question whether or not his entry into this race was fully considered.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine called the subject a diversion from more important issues, like health care and education, and said he was not about to enter into public service by ''breaking the law'' by violating a contract. ''That's breaking the public trust before you get started,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The debate, sponsored by The New York Times, was taped at the Trenton studios of the New Jersey Network, a state-owned public-television system, and shown tonight at 9. It will be rebroadcast on Sunday at 9 a.m.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Franks and the questioners -- two Times editors and a reporter for the network -- seemed to dwell on Mr. Corzine's money, Mr. Corzine, who has seemed flustered in earlier forums, took today's questions in stride. In fact, he seemed to welcome questions about the costs of his platform and used them as a chance to elaborate on his agenda.</p>
        <p>Mr. Franks hit Mr. Corzine hardest in this area, accusing him of trying to ''reinvent'' himself and his program after defeating former Gov. Jim Florio in the Democratic primary. He quoted from a television commercial from last spring in which Mr. Corzine promised to fight for ''universal health care'' and ''universal long-term care'' for the elderly and disabled.</p>
        <p>''When he mentioned the words universal health care, there was no caveat, no 'access,' no phase-in,'' Mr. Franks said. He added that months ago, Mr. Corzine had said his health care plan alone would cost as much as $65 billion. But more recently, Mr. Franks asserted, Mr. Corzine has been saying he could accomplish his entire program for the same amount.</p>
        <p>''The numbers don't add up, Jon,'' Mr. Franks said. ''Jon, I've got to tell you, if you did this kind of math at Goldman Sachs, I'd be standing here debating Jim Florio.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Corzine insisted he had not varied his stance. ''These things are all doable,'' said Mr. Corzine, who spent much of his career as a bond trader. ''I know numbers. I've been working with them all my life.''</p>
        <p>The two candidates also tussled over Social Security. Mr. Corzine accused Mr. Franks of wanting to ''dismantle'' the Social Security system because he supported Gov. George W. Bush's plan to allow individuals to divert a small part of their payroll taxes to investments in the stock market. Mr. Franks replied that Mr. Corzine's idea of letting the government invest Social Security Trust Fund money in the stock market, perhaps through the Federal Reserve System, was ''dangerous.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Franks said the Clinton administration lacked a cogent energy policy. But he said he, like Mr. Corzine and Vice President Al Gore, opposed opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for oil exploration.</p>
        <p>Mr. Franks also attacked Mr. Corzine for supporting the United States' abstention from a United Nations vote condemning Israel for its role in recent clashes with the Palestinians, saying the United States should have vetoed the measure.</p>
        <p>The candidates differed on the definition of a hate crime.</p>
        <p>Mr. Franks, sticking to a commonly held view, said that convicting someone of a hate crime required proving to a jury that the perpetrator was motivated by hatred for some characteristic or group of people, like race or ethnicity, and that the definition could be applied only to acts that were already considered criminal under the law.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Corzine went much further. ''You know, it doesn't have to be, though, just violence against an individual,'' he said. ''It can be burning of a church, or denigration of a particular point of view in an anti-Semitic or other manner in public discourse. I think these kinds of things need to be met by real action.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Franks, a law school graduate, seized on Mr. Corzine's apparent suggestion that some biased remarks could be deemed hate crimes.  ''I don't think we want to attach hate-crime penalties to people who engage in public discourse where they say things that are hateful and intolerant. I think that's what the Constitution of the United States serves to protect. I'm talking about people who break the law.''</p>
