        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As we celebrate the overthrow of Slobodan Milosevic, it is important to step back and realize what we are celebrating. As pointed out by Michael Ignatieff (Op-Ed, Oct. 10), the people of Serbia were moved to a popular uprising ''for what he did to Serbia: ruining the economy, terrorizing opponents and stealing elections.'' They were not so moved when ''all'' he was doing was ''ethnic cleansing'' in Kosovo and Bosnia.</p>

        <p>If not for the NATO intervention and economic sanctions, with the economic privation in Serbia that resulted, would the populace have felt the need to get rid of this indicted war criminal? It would appear that what we are celebrating is largely a revolt against economic suffering, not against barbarity.</p>
