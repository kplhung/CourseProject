      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Presumably, Allen Iverson did not set up his compact disc player and speaker on David Stern's desk yesterday and pump up the volume, as he did on the seat next to him in the visitors' locker room at Madison Square Garden.</p>
        <p>''Can you turn it down?'' a Philadelphia 76ers public relations person shouted, leading reporters in for a pregame audience, basketball questions only.</p>
        <p>Iverson looked up from his magazine, complied without acknowledgment to the request, then looked back down.</p>
        <p>First question: Is it hard to focus on basketball, given his new career as a controversial rap star?</p>
        <p>''Yeah, it's been hard, but my life is hard,'' he said, head still down. ''I'm pretty much used to being put in situations like this.''</p>
        <p>Any regrets then, he was asked, about ''being put'' in this current ''situation''?</p>
        <p>Iverson looked up from the magazine. ''No regrets,'' he said. ''No regrets at all.''</p>
        <p>Talk about a good role player.</p>
        <p>Presumably, Iverson's more remorseful alter ego expressed a regret or two when Stern, commissioner of dribblers and rappers, voiced his displeasure earlier in the day with the lyrics on the forthcoming CD that he would later refer to as ''coarse, offensive, antisocial and repugnant.'' Yet once again, a critic in a suit emerged from a hastily arranged sit-down with the recalcitrant All-Star guard to say he had been assured that Iverson was, in Stern's words, ''sensitive to the concerns expressed to him by various groups.''</p>
        <p>Iverson had already met with black community leaders this week in Philadelphia, apparently sounding sincere to the point where no one emerged to call for his deportment to some Siberian outpost. And this was a development that the 76ers' president, Pat Croce, had looked upon with great and bountiful cheer.</p>
        <p>''It's a step in the right direction and it shows how much he values the people of Philadelphia,'' Croce said.</p>
        <p>Of course, it meant nothing of the sort because if Iverson were truly remorseful, merely unsuspecting of how his gangsta lyrics were going to play, he would have ordered the recording label, Universal, to pull or restructure the song in question. In his statement, Stern said Iverson would now, under threat of potential punishment, ''take steps to eliminate from the final version those lyrics that many found to be so offensive.'' But then, Iverson and his underwriters already had what they wanted: months before the CD's scheduled release, they had created enough of a furor to achieve the desired promotional boost.</p>
        <p>The question now is how to deal with Iverson, as he succeeds in having it both ways. Oops, he is saying, he didn't mean to offend anyone with the load of trash he just dumped. In announcing yesterday that he was taking no present action, Stern touched on a most significant aspect of this story -- corporate accountability. Iverson may be a well-paid messenger, or what John Chaney, the Temple University coach and Philadelphia sports patriarch, has called him -- ''bad man.'' But how does his crime against morality compare with the record company executives who pitched him and will underwrite this project?</p>
        <p>''I have come, unfortunately, to understand that certain rap artists regularly spew such lyrics to a wide audience at great profit to some of America's most successful entertainment companies,'' Stern said, aware of the deleterious effect such publicity has on his.</p>
        <p>Predictably, Iverson has been compared to John Rocker, who was bombarded nationally with scorn last winter for his xenophobic remarks about New York City's heterogeneous culture. It's not as if Iverson has been given the key to Philadelphia. African-American civic leaders, along with representatives of women's groups, gays and the black clergy, have assailed him. Dr. Edward Robinson, chairman of the board of the Pan-African Federation Organization, said he would organize a fan boycott of 76ers games.</p>
        <p>For some scoring at home, these denunciations have fallen woefully short of those for Rocker and drawn simplistic conclusions, e.g., the liberal news media won't take on a young black athlete from the 'hood the way it did a white man from the South. Retrospect, however, tells us that much of the Rocker reaction had little to do with positions or politics, as much as it was a lot of knee-jerk screaming in response to a jerk screaming for attention.</p>
        <p>No matter what spin is put on Iverson's lyrics, his real message could be found in the locker room line that won't be appearing on his CD, the one about ''being put in situations like this.'' He didn't have a choice here, apparently. As usual, controversy went looking for a victim and stumbled upon him.</p>
        <p>What to do about someone like this? All the 76ers and Stern can do is wait for him to grow up, or get lost. More than music, more than morality, this is about another overindulged, self-absorbed jock who listens to no one and always thinks he got a bad rap.</p>
