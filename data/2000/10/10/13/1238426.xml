        <p>A smart murderer leaves no body behind, Robert Bierenbaum told his wife years ago, according to a witness who testified recently in the murder trial of Dr. Bierenbaum, a plastic surgeon.</p>
        <p>Claus von Bulow made this mistake, leaving his wife to linger in a coma, but Dr. Bierenbaum would not be so stupid, he purportedly said.</p>
        <p>Fifteen years later, Dr. Bierenbaum is on trial in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, accused of killing his wife, Gail Katz-Bierenbaum,  and disposing of her body without a trace. He has pleaded not guilty, and prosecutors are now trying a case with ''no body, no forensics, no murder weapon, no bloody clothes, no fingerprints, no brain matter, no body parts,'' as an assistant district attorney, Stephen Saracco, told the jury in his opening statement.</p>
        <p>Prosecuting any murder case requires meeting a burden of proof known as corpus delicti: proving that a death occurred and resulted from the criminal actions of the accused. Needless to say, having a corpus helps. But it is not essential.</p>
        <p>There are myriad murder cases -- many involving Mafia killings -- in which bodies vanished into car trunks or river bottoms, never to be seen again. Sometimes, eyewitnesses can testify that they saw the accused with car keys in hand and a large bag at his feet, or heard the buzz of a chain saw and the splash into the water. But what happens without such evidence? According to experts, a trial can turn on subtleties: Does the jury think the accused is capable of murder? Or that the victim might have been killed by someone else? Or even, most dramatic, that the person presumed to be dead really is alive?</p>
        <p>''You just have to rule out every possibility other than murder, and convince a jury that there is no other explanation for the person's disappearance,'' said Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney, whose office successfully prosecuted the mother-and-son con team Sante and Kenneth Kimes in the killing of an elderly Manhattan socialite whose body disappeared.</p>
        <p>The history of bodyless murder trials goes back at least to 1792 in England, in a case known as The King v. Hindmarsh. Hindmarsh was accused of throwing his captain from a ship.</p>
        <p>Successful convictions in the United States are hardly new.</p>
        <p>In 1957, for instance, an investment consultant, Leonard Ewing Scott, was convicted of killing his wife, Evelyn Throsby Scott, and hiding her body inside the concrete supports of a San Diego freeway. The evidence against him was largely circumstantial. Her alcoholism and medical problems, and his discovery that she had been married five times before, drove him to murder, prosecutors asserted.</p>
        <p>But several other successful convictions have relied on stronger direct evidence.</p>
        <p>Without such smoking-gun evidence, ''You must contend with the ambiguities of life,'' said David Rudovsky, a senior fellow at the University of Pennsylvania Law School. ''A lot of people make threats. A lot of people have motives to do bad things.''</p>
        <p>And so prosecutors in the Bierenbaum case have been piling threat upon threat, motive upon motive, bad deed upon bad deed.</p>
        <p>Friends and relatives of Ms. Katz-Bierenbaum have testified that her husband threatened to kill her and was violent several times in their brief, unhappy marriage. Aviation officials have testified that on the day Ms. Katz-Bierenbaum disappeared, in July 1985, Dr. Bierenbaum flew a small airplane over the Atlantic Ocean for two hours. It was an excursion he tried to conceal by altering flight log books, a prosecution witness said yesterday, and at first failed to mention to detectives.</p>
        <p>Earlier this week, Ms. Katz-Bierenbaum's psychologist testified that Ms. Katz-Bierenbaum showed no signs of being suicidal at the time of her disappearance, a likelihood suggested by the defense.</p>
        <p>There are few parallels for building this kind of case without direct evidence, like a trail of blood or an eyewitness to the killing, said Dr. David Davis, senior vice president of Decisionquest, a national trial consulting firm. And so the case may turn on the jury's ability to imagine that Dr. Bierenbaum -- who since the disappearance has built a successful plastic surgery practice in North Dakota and remarried -- could be capable of murder. His second wife has been at the trial every day.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, some defense lawyers said that circumstantial evidence could be more powerful than direct evidence because it could be harder to attack. Gerald Shargel, a Manhattan defense lawyer, explained that a single eyewitness could be discredited.</p>
        <p>By contrast, the accumulation of circumstantial evidence, when it points to a single, overwhelming motive, can be enough to allow juries a leap of faith.</p>
        <p>''It can be woven so tightly that it would defy human experience to suggest acquittal,'' said Mr. Shargel, who has represented some clients -- including the Teamster leader Tony Provenzano and a Westies gang member, Jimmy Coonan -- accused of great efficiency in disposing of corpses. (Mr. von Bulow, for the record, was acquitted at his second trial.)</p>
        <p>Of course, the best defense is reasonable doubt, even as to whether the supposed victim is dead. Michael Tigar, a law professor at the Washington College of Law at American University in Washington tells a widely known story of a Chicago defense lawyer who played that card.</p>
        <p>In his closing argument, the lawyer told the jurors that if they had any reasonable doubt they had to acquit the defendant. What if the victim was still ''wandering around,'' he asked aloud.</p>
        <p>Then, he cried out, ''Oh my god, there she is!'' The jurors, as one, turned to the courtroom door. Of course, no one was there.</p>
        <p>A slam-dunk, or so it would seem. Instead, the jury deliberated for 20 minutes and voted to convict. The forewoman praised the lawyer's tactic, except for one small oversight: The lone person who did not look up to the courtroom door was none other than his client.</p>
