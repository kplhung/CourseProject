        <p>Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, the Democratic candidate for vice president, said yesterday that he was apparently not related to Hillel Lieberman, an American-born settler killed last weekend in the violence between Israelis and Palestinians on the West Bank.</p>
        <p>Hillel Lieberman's father, Rabbi Sidney Zvulun Lieberman, of Congregation Beth Torah in Midwood, Brooklyn, had said in an interview with The New York Times on Sunday that he and the Connecticut senator were second cousins whose grandfathers had been brothers.

        <p>Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, the Democratic candidate for vice president, said yesterday that he was apparently not related to Hillel Lieberman, an American-born settler killed last weekend in the violence between Israelis and Palestinians on the West Bank.</p>
        <p>Hillel Lieberman's father, Rabbi Sidney Zvulun Lieberman, of Congregation Beth Torah in Midwood, Brooklyn, had said in an interview with The New York Times on Sunday that he and the Connecticut senator were second cousins whose grandfathers had been brothers. The rabbi called the relationship too distant to be personal, and said of the senator,  ''He would have no idea who we are.''</p>
        <p>Asked about the matter last Sunday, Senator Lieberman said that he was unaware of any relationship, but that he would look into it. Yesterday, campaigning in Texas, the senator said he had spoken with Rabbi Lieberman by telephone on Monday to convey his condolences and to clarify the relationship, if any.</p>
        <p>''To the best of my knowledge, I am not related,'' the senator said. ''I told him where my grandfather was from in Poland, and he said he was probably not the person that he had thought he was. In any case, it's a tragedy and I extended my condolences.''</p>
        <p>Hillel Lieberman, 37, grew up in Brooklyn, immigrated to Israel 14 years ago and lived in Elon More, a village near Nablus, with his Israeli wife and seven children. Last Saturday he set out to walk three miles to Nablus, after learning that rioting Palestinians had attacked a Jewish shrine called Joseph's Tomb.</p>
        <p>Israeli police said they believed that along the way, he was abducted and killed by Palestinians. Searchers found his body later near Nablus, and the authorities said he had been beaten and shot to death. He was buried on Wednesday after a funeral procession that was stoned by Palestinians, touching off hours of gun battles between Palestinians and Israeli soldiers.</p>
