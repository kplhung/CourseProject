        <p>Directed by Tony Barbieri  Not rated; 88 minutes.</p>
        <p>Tony Barbieri's small fine film ''One'' is permeated with a deepening sense of foreboding that seeps into your bones as its downbeat story glumly ambles along. The  movie's depressed spirit is reflected in a color scheme that sees the world largely in institutional grays and greens. Few films about American working-class life have portrayed it as this unrelentingly drab. Both in its look and in its tightly compressed acting, which is all nervous subtext, the movie is an effective, but self-conscious, exercise in contemporary neo-realism.</p>

        <p>Tony Barbieri's small fine film ''One'' is permeated with a deepening sense of foreboding that seeps into your bones as its downbeat story glumly ambles along. The  movie's depressed spirit is reflected in a color scheme that sees the world largely in institutional grays and greens. Few films about American working-class life have portrayed it as this unrelentingly drab. Both in its look and in its tightly compressed acting, which is all nervous subtext, the movie is an effective, but self-conscious, exercise in contemporary neo-realism.</p>
        <p>The central character, Charlie O'Connell (Jason Cairns), is a young ex-convict paroled to start life over in contemporary San Francisco. Almost from the opening scene, in which Charlie leaves prison, you worry that his rehabilitation will be compromised by some minor infraction. This sense of dread is aggravated by Charlie's soft-spoken gentleness and the revelation that he was convicted, not for a violent crime, but for helping his terminally ailing grandfather  kill himself.</p>
        <p>All we learn about Charlie's time in prison was that while behind bars, he fingered the killer of a fellow inmate and is now a target for revenge. And for most of the film, we wait for that inevitable other shoe to drop. Released from prison, Charlie goes to live with his  best friend from high school, Nick Razca (Kane Picoy), a gifted baseball player whose promising professional career was halted when he physically attacked a manager.</p>
        <p>Nick, who has been making a decent living as a garbage man, helps Charlie get a job hauling trash. Both men stay with Nick's parents, Iris (Gabriell Ruvolo) and Ted (Paul Herman), in a house seething with barely suppressed father-son strife. Although Nick  yearns for another shot at a professional career, he refuses to join another ball club unless he is guaranteed a large advance.</p>
        <p>Ted, who lives vicariously through his son's accomplishments,  can't keep himself from riding Nick. The advice he offers, though  practical, makes Nick more defiant and ultimately self-destructive in his unrealistic expectations.</p>
        <p>When Charlie announces that he wants to go back to school to become a teacher, Nick tries to undermine his friend's desire for self-improvement. As part of his community service, Charlie also takes a job delivering medical supplies to a  school for mentally disabled children. Here, he meets Sarah Jenkins (Autumn Macintosh), a pretty young woman with whom he cautiously begins a relationship. Methodical and introverted, Charlie is almost maddeningly passive, and it is only after Sarah makes the first move that he responds to her.</p>
        <p>Eventually, the personal tensions among the characters come to a boil. But the movie is so loath to show violence that the film's climactic scene is played off-screen, and the camera observes the aftermath from a leery distance as if the film were afraid of contamination.</p>
        <p>''One,'' which opens today at the Loews State, Broadway at 45th Street, is an impressive first feature for its director, who proves himself a master both at creating mood (the director's vision of San Francisco has an open-spaced Edward Hopperesque melancholy) and at evoking a macho blue-collar ethic where fiercely emotional men  keep their feelings bottled up until they threaten to explode.</p>
        <p>But in many places, especially in its scenes between Charlie and Sarah, the film's spareness and lack of words seem affected and ultimately unrealistic. At such moments, its refusal to put things into words and its crushing sense of gloom turn self-defeating.</p>
