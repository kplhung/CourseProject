        <p>Mikhail B. Piotrovsky is a man with multiple missions. On a five-day visit to New York, Dr. Piotrovsky, the director of the State Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, Russia, was on hand yesterday for the opening of ''The Golden Deer of Eurasia: Scythian and Sarmatian Treasures From the Russian Steppes'' at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. He also gave a lecture at the Met on its show and was honored at the annual dinner of the American Friends of the Hermitage.</p>
        <p>More pressing, however, were his meetings with Thomas Krens, director of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, to go over plans for the two institutions to share their collections, organize joint exhibitions and develop a worldwide network of museums.</p>
        <p>Dr. Piotrovsky also visited the sculptor Louise Bourgeois, 89, to discuss plans for a show of her work at the Hermitage, its first exhibition of a living artist.</p>
        <p>Ms. Bourgeois's show is to fill five rooms and include one of her signature ''Spider'' sculptures, similar to the gigantic one at the new Tate Modern in London. The show is being organized by Julie Sylvester Cabot, an independent curator and publisher of prints. ''The Hermitage is also talking about including film and video installations and possibly publishing limited-edition prints,'' Ms. Cabot said.</p>
        <p>The Bourgeois show was conceived before the Hermitage made its commitment to the Guggenheim in June. So were the Hermitage's plans for permanent exhibition space that is to open on Nov. 21 at Somerset House, the late-18th-century mansion on the Strand in London. Dr. Piotrovsky said another reason for his trip to New York was to talk about possible donations from Americans for exhibitions in London.</p>
        <p>At the Met, to which the Hermitage supplied some showpieces for ''The Golden Deer'' (review, Page 37), he was also discussing another collaboration that would center on the Hermitage's holdings of art and objects from royal collectors like Peter the Great and Catherine the Great.</p>
        <p>But Dr. Piotrovsky was most eager to discuss his relationship with the Guggenheim. ''It is the style of the next century to join brands,'' he said. ''Nowadays it is absolutely impossible to make a good collection from scratch. So working with the Guggenheim is good for both of us.''</p>
        <p>Besides discussing real estate issues, like the Hermitage's participation in a planned new Guggenheim museum, possibly to be built on Wall Street overlooking the East River, Dr. Piotrovsky said he was also exploring the possibility of more contemporary-art exhibitions for the Hermitage over the next few years.</p>
        <p>''We are considering mounting a show that would be 300 years of American art, to open in 2003, timed to celebrate the 300 years of the founding of St. Petersburg,'' he said. He is also talking about organizing a show that would join the Hermitage's 16th- and 17th-century Mannerist prints and drawings with the Guggenheim's photographs.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile the Hermitage, in its appeal for American financial support, has published an English version of its annual report. And for the first time it has released a guide to the Hermitage similar to the one the Met offers in four languages: English, Russian, German and French.</p>
        <p>''We are also doing special public relations to explain to the Russians that we are not selling our national heritage,'' Dr. Piotrovsky said. ''They bring us McDonald's. We bring them the Hermitage and the Kirov.''</p>
        <p>Drip Painting</p>
        <p>At the end of the summer the Museum of Modern Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art found themselves in an uncomfortable situation, news of which has only now filtered down through the gossipy art world.</p>
        <p>The two museums rent storage space in the same Manhattan warehouse, and the Modern's space is directly above the Whitney's. When one of the air conditioning units in the Modern's storage space broke, its water sensors failed, and the floor below was flooded.</p>
        <p>None of the Modern's art was damaged, but the water seeped through the floor to the Whitney's space, harming two works, Stuart Davis's ''Owh! in San Pao'' (1951) and Brice Marden's ''No. 1'' (1983-4). The Davis was only minimally damaged and is currently at a conservator for repairs. But the Marden, a Color Field work, appears more difficult to save.</p>
        <p>''We're very regretful,'' said Elizabeth Addison, deputy director for marketing and communications at the Modern. ''Unfortunately these were circumstances beyond our control.''</p>
        <p>Maxwell L. Anderson, director of the Whitney, said: ''We take care of over 12,000 works of art, and when something like this happens, we take it very seriously. It's a fact of life when caring for precious things that such unforeseen events might happen.'' He said he was optimistic that conservators could save the Davis. As for the Marden, he said: ''We're working with Brice to see what can be done. This is the third time this kind of thing has happened to him, and with a Color Field work like this it's especially difficult.''</p>
        <p>Beemer Shots</p>
        <p>BMW, the German car maker, has melded ideas about its corporate image with art photography. The company commissioned 11 photographers, including well-known names like Todd Eberle, Catherine Opie, Gillian Wearing and Sharon Lockhart, to investigate BMW's culture.</p>
        <p>The artists were allowed to take research trips around the world examining BMW's design, manufacturing and distribution operations. Each artist produced at least three pieces, all of which will be the focus of ''AutoWerke,'' an exhibition at the Deichtorhallen in Hamburg, Germany, from Nov. 9 to Feb. 2. BMW executives say they plan a tour for the exhibition and are looking at appropriate sites in the United States and elsewhere.</p>
        <p>''This began as an exercise in generating ideas about how people look at the company from a different perspective,'' said Stefan Krause, president of BMW Financial Services in Woodcliff Lake, N.J.</p>
        <p>The artists, chosen by a group of arts professionals, produced drastically different results. Mr. Eberle's panels portray the home and work environments of three designers from various parts of the world, while Ms. Opie documented the interior of BMW's Munich factory. Ms. Wearing advertised for BMW owners who were willing to share their car experiences; she selected three and produced a combination of portraits of the subjects and silkscreen reproductions of their handwritten submissions.</p>
        <p>After the show the photographs are to be hung in BMW offices around the world.</p>
