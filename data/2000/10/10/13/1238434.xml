        <p>Seeds of concern over Vice President Al Gore's campaign appear to be developing among House Democrats, some of whom said today that they were disappointed with his performance Wednesday night in the second presidential debate.</p>
        <p>The vice president, they said, missed opportunities to strike back at the Republican-controlled Congress and to help the Democrats regain control of the House.</p>
        <p>With an eye on independent voters, Mr. Gore has been speaking above the partisan fray. On the campaign trail, he tends to avoid direct references to Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, whom he calls ''my opponent,'' or to the Republicans, whom he calls ''the other side.'' He rarely blames them for foiling administration initiatives and he rarely tries to rally audiences to send local Democrats to Washington.</p>
        <p>To some degree, Gore supporters see the vice president as tripped up either way. His performance in the first debate with Mr. Bush was faulted as too aggressive, a criticism he tried to respond to with Wednesday's lower-keyed approach. But now he is perceived as having overcompensated, raising concern among House Democrats that he is not doing enough to help the party, even as such concern detracts from a serious evaluation of Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>As Representative Jose E. Serrano, a Bronx Democrat, put it: ''Gore was told by the world not to be aggressive. But now, if he's not aggressive, that's the criticism. The other guy can do whatever he pleases.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, some Democrats on Capitol Hill said today that in Wednesday's debate, Mr. Gore seemed to take the notion of bipartisanship too far. They worried that if he does not paint differences more starkly, Democrats will stay in the minority.</p>
        <p>Representative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of Manhattan, said, ''I think Al Gore should have been a little more aggressive.''</p>
        <p>Representative Eddie Bernice Johnson, Democrat of Texas, said, ''I would have been tougher.''</p>
        <p>Representative Dennis J. Kucinich, Democrat of Ohio, said Mr. Gore's strengths were evident when he went into details on health care, education and economic policy issues. But, Mr. Kucinich said, ''At the beginning, he was tentative, and he's not at his best when he's tentative.''</p>
        <p>Representative Carrie P. Meek, Democrat of Florida, said: ''In terms of substance, Gore did very well. But I was a little disappointed in his assertiveness. I think he should have nailed Governor Bush more. But he was constrained and just didn't go for it.''</p>
        <p>Representative Jim McDermott, Democrat of Washington, said Democrats were not abandoning Mr. Gore but wanted him to remember it was Democrats whose votes for a balanced budget in 1993 -- helping to bring about the economic boom -- cost the party the House in 1994.</p>
        <p>''We don't want him to be defensive about the Congress, because we have taken the hits, paid the price and brought about the prosperity that's out there,'' Mr. McDermott said. ''We want the credit. And we do better when he does better.''</p>
        <p>Surveys show that voters loathe the partisanship that has consumed Capitol Hill. And some voters are content with divided government, thinking that Washington could inflict as little damage as possible if it was gridlocked. On the Republican side, Governor Bush has severed himself from the Beltway battles.</p>
        <p>Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the minority leader, said bipartisanship was important. ''It is important to tell voters -- as he is, and as I am -- that if we win, we will try to operate in a much more bipartisan way than the present group,'' he said.</p>
        <p>And he said Mr. Gore had done much to unify the party by promoting targeted tax cuts and paying down the debt that most Democrats were comfortable with, unlike Mr. Bush, whose tax-cut proposal has been spurned by House Republicans.</p>
        <p>But, Mr. Gephardt said, feelings run deep among House Democrats that they had made political sacrifices and did not want to be forgotten. ''There's real heartfelt agreement among all the members that we paid a price for this, this is our accomplishment, we were a part of this and we aren't going to give it up.''</p>
        <p>Still, he said he doubted in today's multimedia environment, where voters get information about candidates from a variety of sources, that political endorsements meant much.</p>
        <p>''I don't think we can help him and he can't help us,'' Mr. Gephardt said. ''In today's world, these kind of endorsements don't amount to a thing.''</p>
