        <p>SUNDAY 1 P.M.</p>
        <p>Dallas (2-3) at Giants (4-2)  The Giants have won 3 of the last 4 at home against Dallas. Giant players always get fired up for the Cowboys at Giants Stadium and for running back Emmitt Smith in particular. He has averaged only 88.9 yards rushing in 19 career games against the Giants, the lowest numbers for Smith against an N.F.C. East opponent. Coach Jim Fassel will get the Giants' offense clicking this week. One wild card is former Giants cornerback Phillippi Sparks, now with Dallas. The Giants have been telling nasty stories about Sparks's days in New York to New York reporters. Sparks has been reading the reports and is said to be extra motivated.  Giants, 22-9</p>

        <p>SUNDAY 1 P.M.</p>
        <p>Dallas (2-3) at Giants (4-2)  The Giants have won 3 of the last 4 at home against Dallas. Giant players always get fired up for the Cowboys at Giants Stadium and for running back Emmitt Smith in particular. He has averaged only 88.9 yards rushing in 19 career games against the Giants, the lowest numbers for Smith against an N.F.C. East opponent. Coach Jim Fassel will get the Giants' offense clicking this week. One wild card is former Giants cornerback Phillippi Sparks, now with Dallas. The Giants have been telling nasty stories about Sparks's days in New York to New York reporters. Sparks has been reading the reports and is said to be extra motivated.  Giants, 22-9</p>
        <p>Atlanta (2-4) at St. Louis (5-0)  If you run to the bathroom or skip away to roast a hot dog, you might miss three touchdowns by the Rams. With a team that has scored at least 30 points in each of its last 11 regular-season games, there is little to analyze. The slow, banged-up Falcons have almost no chance. Their only hope is that St. Louis might be a little sluggish after a bye week. Fat chance. Rams, 40-12</p>
        <p>Carolina (2-3) at New Orleans (2-3)  Running back Ricky Williams finally is growing up, on and off the field. He has rushed for more than 100 yards in three consecutive games. He is also catching the ball well out of the backfield. Williams's productivity allows the Saints to control the ball, like they did last week against Chicago, for more than 38 minutes. The Saints' defense has prevented four of five opposing passers from throwing for 200 yards. Saints, 20-17</p>
        <p>Cincinnati (0-5) at Pittsburgh (2-3)  Quarterback Kent Graham gets the start, but look for Kordell Stewart to make an appearance for the Steelers. Three of the past four meetings between these teams have been decided by 7 points or less. The Bengals will eventually win a game this season, but it won't be this one. Cincinnati will see lots of Jerome Bettis, who has 931 rushing yards in 9 games against the Bengals in his career. Wide receiver Peter Warrick will return punts for the Bengals and he will score their only touchdown. Steelers, 21-7</p>
        <p>Oakland (4-1) at Kansas City (3-2)  The Chiefs are tough to beat at Arrowhead, Stadium but the Raiders will not be intimidated. Oakland knows it has the perfect formula to win there: a steady running game led by Tyrone Wheatley, solid wide receivers and a quarterback, Rich Gannon, who passes accurately. The Chiefs have beaten the Raiders 10 of the last 11 times at home, but not this time. Oakland has learned how to win close games, going 3-0 this year in contests decided by seven points or less. Last year the Raiders' record in those games was 5-8. Raiders, 30-29</p>
        <p>San Diego (0-6) at Buffalo (2-3)  It's official: Ryan Leaf is a bust. Jim Harbaugh gets the start at quarterback for the Chargers, but he will give way to Moses Moreno in the second half. Now that Leaf is out of the starting lineup, the team can relax a little, and sit back and watch another team deal with a problematic offensive starter. Buffalo running back Antowain Smith asked to be traded this week and the Bills' management, of course, refused. San Diego takes advantage of Buffalo's internal strife. Chargers, 17-14</p>
        <p>SUNDAY 4:05 P.M.</p>
        <p>Jets (4-1) at New England (2-4)  Who will get the start: Vinny Testaverde, with his pinched nerve, or backup Ray Lucas? When it comes to injuries, the Jets can mount a misinformation campaign that would make the C.I.A. proud. But Testaverde will likely start, with Lucas ready to go. A bigger worry could running back Curtis Martin, who is rumored to have knee problems, or wide receiver Wayne Chrebet, who has only 10 catches in his last three games. The banged-up Jets fall to Bill Belichick's defensive schemes. Patriots, 16-10</p>
        <p>Cleveland (2-4) at Denver (3-3)  The Broncos simply score too many points for the Browns and are too tough at Mile High Stadium. The Cleveland offensive line does a nice job of protecting young thrower Tim Couch, so he will move the football, but Couch can't keep up with his counterpart, Brian Griese, who has a 105.1 quarterback rating. Broncos, 30-18</p>
        <p>Indianapolis (3-2) at Seattle (2-4)  The Colts love this matchup. Quarterback Peyton Manning can pick apart a very soft Seattle defense. He'll have big numbers. The Colts' defense may not be challenged much; Brock Huard gets the start at quarterback for Seattle, and he is simply not a good player. His lack of mobility will make him an easy target for defensive lineman Chad Bratzke, who gets his first road sack of the season. Colts, 25-10</p>
        <p>SUNDAY 4:15 P.M.</p>
        <p>Philadelphia (3-3) at Arizona (2-3)  Philadelphia Quarterback Donovan McNabb is making excellent progress, but he has few weapons to utilize. Running back Duce Staley will miss the remainder of the season with a foot injury and the Eagles possess an average group of wide receivers. Still, the Cardinals are a mess, and Philadelphia's defense wins this game. Eagles, 14-9</p>
        <p>San Francisco (2-4) at Green Bay (2-4)  The 49ers have only two victories, but they are an impressive team, despite the rebuilding the franchise is going through. San Francisco has found its next franchise quarterback in Jeff Garcia, and it has a solid offensive line and good young receivers, including Terrell Owens, who leads the conference with 35 catches. But the defense is horrid, giving up 412 yards a game. Brett Favre exploits that weakness in a high scoring game. Packers, 38-30</p>
        <p>SUNDAY 8:30 P.M.</p>
        <p>Minnesota (5-0) at Chicago (1-5)  This is a potential roadblock for the Vikings. The Bears are a crippled, battered team with a struggling quarterback, Cade McNown. This game has trap written all over it. The difference between this Vikings team and others in recent history is a solid defense that can carry Minnesota when the offense takes a step back. Besides, this is an extremely mature Minnesota group. They simply won't lose to the sorry Bears , although the game will be close. Vikings, 28-21</p>
        <p>MONDAY 9 P.M.</p>
        <p>Jacksonville (2-4) at Tennessee (4-1)  Tennessee may be the most physical team in football. The Titans punish defenses with a brutal running attack and just when a defense is woozy from being battered, quarterback Steve McNair can throw a nice deep pass. Not to mention that Tennessee has Jacksonville's number. The Titans defeated the Jaguars three times last year, twice in the regular season and once in the playoffs. Jaguars quarterback Mark Brunell will play well after being benched in the fourth quarter last week against Baltimore. He has a chip on his shoulder. But it won't be enough. Titans, 18-14</p>
        <p>Game of the Week</p>
        <p>SUNDAY 1 P.M.</p>
        <p>Baltimore at Washington  The Redskins are beginning to come together quite nicely. The offense is clicking and the defense has held five of six opponents to 20 points or fewer. But there is something about the Ravens, a touch of destiny and a strong belief by the players that this team is special. Plus, on defense, few teams are playing better. Coach Brian Billick, a strong offensive tactician, has spent extra time this week trying to improve the Ravens' offense. When he brainstorms, the points start to flow. Ravens, 28-24</p>
        <p>Miami, Detroit and Tampa Bay do not play this week. All times Eastern.</p>
