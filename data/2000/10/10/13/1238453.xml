        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>George W. Bush and Al Gore have been so enthusiastic about the strong economy that they have overlooked the weakening economic reality all around them (front page, Oct. 12).</p>
        <p>Voters may be better off today than eight years ago, but not compared with the last 6 to 12 months. So far this year, there are clear signs that the economy is slowing. The stock market has had a sharp decline. Some interest rates are higher. Inflationary concerns in oil and gas are a reality. A powerful dollar is hurting domestic output and skewing the huge trade deficit.</p>

        <p>George W. Bush and Al Gore have been so enthusiastic about the strong economy that they have overlooked the weakening economic reality all around them (front page, Oct. 12).</p>
        <p>Voters may be better off today than eight years ago, but not compared with the last 6 to 12 months. So far this year, there are clear signs that the economy is slowing. The stock market has had a sharp decline. Some interest rates are higher. Inflationary concerns in oil and gas are a reality. A powerful dollar is hurting domestic output and skewing the huge trade deficit.</p>
        <p>One would hope that the presidential candidates in the third debate will finally get around to focusing on the current business and financial trends, which could be the main domestic issue for the next president's first year in office.</p>
