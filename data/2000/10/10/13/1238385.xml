        <p>Editorial says Clinton administration must respond firmly but carefully to attack on Navy destroyer Cole in Yemen; says Washington must work to uncover who is to blame and what appropriate response to make, and Navy must tighten its security procedures for refueling stops and port calls, especially in Middle East; says Pres Clinton is also struggling to keep conflict between Israel and Palestinians from flaring into wider war, and it is unclear how much cooperation he can expect from Prime Min Ehud Barak and Yasir Arafat; says Barak seems prepared to do what he can to halt bloodshed, but Arafat has shown no such inclination recently, even though he can break cycle of conflict; says Vice Pres Al Gore and Gov George W Bush must continue to avoid exacerbating tensions as they maneuver for advantage in presidential race</p>

        <p>The Middle East shuddered with new violence yesterday that spilled the blood of Americans, Israelis and Palestinians and brought the region to a level of instability it has not seen since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait a decade ago. The deadly attack on an American naval vessel in Yemen, the sickening lynch-mob murder of two Israeli soldiers in Ramallah and retaliatory Israeli air strikes against targets in Palestinian-ruled areas of the West Bank and Gaza unsettled Washington and Wall Street, introduced an unpredictable element into the presidential campaign and left little hope for a speedy revival of the Middle East peace effort.</p>
        <p>Handling the combustible confluence of events in the Middle East will require a steady hand by President Clinton, who must now deal with the attack on American sailors as he struggles to keep the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians from flaring into a wider war.

Moderate Arab leaders, concerned about the spreading violence, should press for a truce.</p>

        <p>The Middle East shuddered with new violence yesterday that spilled the blood of Americans, Israelis and Palestinians and brought the region to a level of instability it has not seen since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait a decade ago. The deadly attack on an American naval vessel in Yemen, the sickening lynch-mob murder of two Israeli soldiers in Ramallah and retaliatory Israeli air strikes against targets in Palestinian-ruled areas of the West Bank and Gaza unsettled Washington and Wall Street, introduced an unpredictable element into the presidential campaign and left little hope for a speedy revival of the Middle East peace effort.</p>
        <p>Handling the combustible confluence of events in the Middle East will require a steady hand by President Clinton, who must now deal with the attack on American sailors as he struggles to keep the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians from flaring into a wider war. It is unclear how much cooperation he can expect from Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader. The bloodshed of the last two weeks has hardened the positions of both men. Moderate Arab leaders, concerned about the spreading violence, should press for a truce.</p>
        <p>During this difficult time, Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush must continue to avoid exacerbating tensions as they maneuver for advantage in the presidential race. Mr. Bush responded to yesterday's events in a measured way, expressing appreciation for the Clinton administration's efforts to calm the situation in the Middle East and support for Israel. Mr. Gore broke off from campaigning to return to the White House to meet with Mr. Clinton and his top aides.</p>
        <p>The Clinton administration must respond firmly but carefully to the Yemen attack. The U.S.S. Cole, one of the Navy's advanced Aegis destroyers, was in the Yemeni port of Aden for refueling when a small vessel laden with explosives detonated alongside it in an apparent terrorist attack. The blast killed at least six American sailors and left several dozen more injured or missing. No organization has yet claimed responsibility.</p>
        <p>Washington must work to uncover who is to blame, and, assuming that it can do so, decide on an appropriate response. Washington needs to be more careful than it was in its possibly misdirected cruise missile attack against a Sudanese factory after the terrorist bombing of American embassies in Africa two years ago. While the investigation of the Aden blast goes on, the Navy must tighten its security procedures for refueling stops and port calls, especially in the Middle East.</p>
        <p>In the Palestinian-ruled West Bank town of Ramallah, two Israeli army reservists who had apparently lost their way were first taken into custody, then beaten to death by a Palestinian mob as they were held in a Palestinian police station. The sight of attackers violently assaulting the Israelis as other Palestinians cheered them on, and as the Palestinian police inexcusably did little to protect them, was horrifying to Israelis and Americans alike.</p>
        <p>Israel retaliated swiftly with air strikes in Ramallah and Gaza City against Palestinian targets, including some of Mr. Arafat's administrative offices. It gave advance warning of the attacks to limit civilian casualties. Prime Minister Barak also called for the formation of a national unity government that would include the Likud party leader, Ariel Sharon. At the same time, Israel stressed its desire to return to the negotiating table. But Palestinian leaders proclaimed that the Israelis had declared war on them and called for a mobilization of guerrilla fighters.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton is right to concentrate on ending the violence. There seems little chance that the peace talks that made so much progress at Camp David in July can be resumed any time soon. Even restoring tranquillity will be hard. As angry as he appeared yesterday, Mr. Barak seems prepared to do what he can to halt the bloodshed. Mr. Arafat has shown no such inclination in recent days, even though everyone knows that he can break the cycle of conflict.</p>
