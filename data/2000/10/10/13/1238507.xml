        <p>The plant, run by Outokumpu Copper Americas, which makes copper and brass products, has been involved in a $15 million program to upgrade its machinery and to add equipment to manufacture a new line of parts used in connectors for electrical wiring in products ranging from cars to computers.</p>
        <p>The state's Department of Transportation has agreed to finance $2.4 million of the cost of the road and rail improvements, and the Empire State Development Corporation has provided $500,000 in grants to help finance the plant's upgrading and to train workers to use the new machinery, officials said.</p>
