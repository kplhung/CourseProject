        <p>In Wednesday night's debate at Wake Forest University, both presidential candidates spoke out firmly against racial profiling, the police practice of stopping cars because of the race of their drivers. ''I can't imagine what it's like to be singled out because of race and stopped and harassed,'' George W. Bush said. ''That's flat wrong.'' Asked by the moderator, Jim Lehrer, if he would support a federal law to stop racial profiling, Mr. Bush said yes.</p>
        <p>Al Gore was more specific. Not only would he issue an executive order to stop racial profiling in federal law enforcement, he said, but if he were to win the presidency, a federal ban on racial profiling would be ''the first civil rights act of the 21st century.''</p>

        <p>In Wednesday night's debate at Wake Forest University, both presidential candidates spoke out firmly against racial profiling, the police practice of stopping cars because of the race of their drivers. ''I can't imagine what it's like to be singled out because of race and stopped and harassed,'' George W. Bush said. ''That's flat wrong.'' Asked by the moderator, Jim Lehrer, if he would support a federal law to stop racial profiling, Mr. Bush said yes.</p>
        <p>Al Gore was more specific. Not only would he issue an executive order to stop racial profiling in federal law enforcement, he said, but if he were to win the presidency, a federal ban on racial profiling would be ''the first civil rights act of the 21st century.''</p>
        <p>These statements -- echoing, at least in sentiment, the equally vehement denunciations by the vice presidential candidates, Dick Cheney and Joseph Lieberman, in their debate last week -- will only have meaning if they translate into real action when the campaign is over. So far, the national record on unequal treatment of minorities in the criminal justice system is discouraging, to say the least -- and not just where driving is concerned.</p>
        <p>Last month the United States submitted its first report to the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. In that document, our government made a historic acknowledgment that racism remains an obstinate American problem. The report describes the pervasiveness of racial bias in housing, education and other areas of American life, and we applaud the effort behind it. We note with dismay, however, that racial disparities in one crucial area -- the criminal justice system -- are far more widespread and profound than the report admits.</p>
        <p>In particular, it does nothing to outline remedies for racial profiling, racial disparities in sentencing and incarceration, or the racist application of the death penalty. It places undue reliance on the false defense of federalism, claiming the Constitution precludes federal action against state and local governments when they violate the rights of minorities.</p>
        <p>The United States ratified the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination in 1994, and under that agreement this country has a responsibility to remedy discrimination, both intentional and unintentional, that disproportionately affects minorities.</p>
        <p>Earlier this year, in anticipation of the report to the United Nations, 47 Americans, including civil and human rights leaders, urged the United Nations to appeal to the United States to honor its obligations under the Race Convention when the racial discrimination committee considers the American report early next year. By acting as a check on government behavior in the United States, the international community can play a constructive role in pressing this country to address these festering problems.</p>
        <p>Recent reports show that from 1995 to 1997, 70 percent of the drivers stopped by Maryland State Police on Interstate Route 95 were black, even though only 17.5 percent of all drivers were black. Nationally, although there are five times as many white drug users as black drug users, blacks make up 62.7 percent of drug offenders sent to state prison. Other minorities, too, are imprisoned at rates above their proportion in the population, and the rates are growing. Among all prisoners, Hispanics are the fastest-growing ethnic group, and the percentage of Asian-Americans in the federal prisons increased by a factor of four from 1980 to 1999.</p>
        <p>Sadly, African-American and Hispanic children are 2.5 times as likely as white children who engage in comparable behavior to be tried as adults, and 8.3 times as likely to be incarcerated.</p>
        <p>American rhetoric is strong in favor of racial justice at home, as the presidential and vice presidential debates once again showed. And internationally, the United States is a leader in calling for human rights. The two go together, and our actions must match our ideals. As President Clinton said in his State of the Union address in 1997, ''Our world leadership grows out of the power of our example here at home.'' Efforts to urge other nations to adhere to the rule of law will be undermined by the conspicuous American failure to achieve elemental fairness in the administration of its own laws.</p>
        <p>It is not enough for national leaders to throw up their hands and say that since criminal law is mostly state law, only the states can end the disparity in justice. We call on the federal government, no matter who is elected in November, to expand civil rights laws to outlaw racial profiling; to mandate federal standards and training for state and local law enforcement agencies that will help improve treatment of minorities; and to reform sentencing laws that have transferred sentencing discretion from judges to prosecutors, with disastrous consequences for minorities. Federal officials can press for suspension of capital punishment in the United States.</p>
        <p>We need national leaders committed to designing and acting on a substantive strategy for the achievement of justice that is truly just.</p>
