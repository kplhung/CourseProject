        <p>Fast start? What fast start?</p>
        <p>''It's been a roadblock,'' Islanders Coach Butch Goring said yesterday morning after the Islanders had fallen to Toronto, 3-2, the previous evening to start the season 0-1-1.</p>
        <p>''What's frustrating and disappointing is that we didn't seem to be in the game, emotionally or physically,'' Goring said.</p>
        <p>A lack of emotion should not be a problem tomorrow night in the Islanders' home opener against the Calgary Flames at the Nassau Coliseum, but a lack of scoring might be, especially on the power play. Four times in Toronto the Islanders had a man advantage, and four times they failed to score. So far, their power play is 0 for 12. They could not even score on a penalty shot that would have tied the game with 34 seconds left; Glenn Healy stopped Brad Isbister's backhander with his right pad.</p>
        <p>The Islanders were outshot, 33-20, against Toronto, mustering only 11 shots through the first two periods. They also could not avoid taking penalties, giving the Maple Leafs eight power-play chances; Toronto scored once.</p>
        <p>Making their first appearance in the Islanders' home jerseys will be forwards Taylor Pyatt, Oleg Kvasha, Mark Parrish and Mike Stapleton; the defensemen Garry Galley, Kevin Haller and Roman Hamrlik; and goalie John Vanbiesbrouck.</p>
        <p>''It's a different year, and there are a lot of new guys,'' Goring said. ''The only thing we want to carry over from last year is that enthusiasm and intensity. We were not nice to play against last year.''</p>
