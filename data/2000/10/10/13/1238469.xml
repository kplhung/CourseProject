        <p>Shares of Sycamore Networks surged yesterday after the company won a contract to provide BellSouth with new-generation optical switches and transport equipment for its planned Internet gateway service center in Florida. BellSouth and Sycamore did not disclose the terms of the deal, but analysts said its symbolic value was far greater than its dollar value. Sycamore expects to begin recording revenue from the BellSouth contract in 2001, but officials declined to specify in which quarter. Sycamore shares rose $3.45, to close at $76.14.</p>
