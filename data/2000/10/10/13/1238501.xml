        <p>The Mets were built to win this season. That was the mandate from ownership, and that is why the roster is loaded with veterans. In the grand plan, no rookies figured to play any significant roles.</p>
        <p>But sometimes a veteran starter cannot hold an early lead. Sometimes, veteran relievers crumble in the late innings. The Mets' youth delivered tonight, when two rookies sparked them to a 6-5 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals and a commanding two-games-to-none lead in the National League Championship Series.</p>
        <p>The rookie center fielder Jay Payton singled in the pinch-runner Joe McEwing in the top of the ninth inning, breaking a 5-5 tie.</p>
        <p>Armando Benitez closed the game with his first save of the postseason, and if the Mets win two of their next five games, they will advance to the World Series for the first time since 1986.</p>
        <p>Payton, who also drove in the winning run in Game 2 of the division series, became the hero after going hitless in his first three at-bats, stranding three runners.</p>
        <p>''There's no one on the team, maybe no one in the league, who has as much confidence in himself as Jay Payton,'' Mets Manager Bobby Valentine said. ''He didn't have any hits going into that at-bat, but I know he believed deep down in his heart, right down to his toes, that he was the best man in that situation.''</p>
        <p>Payton gave credit to the veterans who surrounded him, notably Edgardo Alfonzo, whose eighth-inning single scored the rookie Timo Perez from first and gave the Mets a lead they later gave up.</p>
        <p>''I watch Fonzie, and to me, he's my M.V.P.,'' Payton said. ''He comes up with big hits. I want to go out there and try to help my team and do the same thing.''</p>
        <p>By winning in their last at-bat, the Mets captured Game 2 in their preferred fashion. They have come back so often to win so many dramatic October games that the thrilling has become almost routine.</p>
        <p>The game finished one minute short of four hours, making it the longest nine-inning game in N.L.C.S. history. The Mets fought for every minute of it, which every team tries to do but which the Mets always seem to pull off.</p>
        <p>''That has something to do with the unity of this team,'' said first baseman Todd Zeile, who was 2 for 3 with two runs batted in. ''We're not relying on one particular guy, so you've got everyone pulling for everyone else.</p>
        <p>''But there's got to be more than that. A lot of guys in this room have great spirit and a lot of fight to them. We've played games like this so many times and had so much success, it gives us confidence that when our backs are against the wall, we're going to respond.''</p>
        <p>The Mets got a 2-0 lead in the first inning, but the Cardinals fought back against Al Leiter to tie the score at 3-3 through seven. In the eighth, Perez slapped a single with two outs and scored from first on another single, by Alfonzo, putting the Mets ahead, 4-3.</p>
        <p>They scored another run, but the Cardinals pulled even with a pair off John Franco in the bottom of the eighth. Mike Timlin, the Cardinals' fifth reliever, came on in the ninth, and Robin Ventura reached base when first baseman Will Clark could not handle his bouncer.</p>
        <p>It went for an error, and Ventura advanced to second when Benny Agbayani put down a sacrifice bunt -- something he did not do once in the regular season.</p>
        <p>McEwing ran for Ventura, and Payton smashed a single to center, the ball eluding the Gold Glover Jim Edmonds and bouncing over his head as McEwing dashed in for the winning run. Turk Wendell earned the victory.</p>
        <p>Mets relievers had allowed only two earned runs in 13 2/3 innings this postseason. They matched that in the bottom of the eighth, when Franco and Wendell gave up the lead. Carlos Hernandez walked with one out, and Clark singled. A wild pitch from Franco brought in one run, and Wendell relieved Franco with two outs.</p>
        <p>When the announced pinch-hitter, Placido Polanco, sat down, a buzz rippled through the 52,250 fans. The injured slugger Mark McGwire, they sensed, would come up.</p>
        <p>Instead, J. D. Drew came to bat, and he made the fans cheer, anyway. Drew drove a double to right center, bringing in Clark with the tying run. Now it was time for McGwire, who is hitless in eight career at-bats off Wendell.</p>
        <p>The crowd roared and the flashbulbs popped. Then, Valentine ordered an intentional walk.</p>
        <p>It was the right move: Wendell fanned the next hitter, Craig Paquette, sending the game to the ninth inning tied, 5-5.</p>
        <p>Wendell said he was shocked McGwire would bat in an obvious situation for an intentional walk.</p>
        <p>''I was totally surprised,'' Wendell said. ''Obviously, you just throw four pitches to him, walk him and go after the next guy. I give Tony La Russa a lot more credit than that. Obviously we were going to walk him. Why not pull him back and send somebody else up there?''</p>
        <p>La Russa, the Cardinals' manager, said he was down to only one other bench player, the little-used catcher Rick Wilkins.</p>
        <p>The only move La Russa said he may regret was starting the 21-year-old rookie Rick Ankiel, who was dreadful tonight and left in the first inning.</p>
        <p>''He said something about how he didn't feel the baseball, but it's the manager's responsibility to put guys in the right position,'' La Russa said. ''I blame myself. I don't blame Rick Ankiel -- he's too special.''</p>
        <p>There were no indications early that the game would become so close. The Mets pushed across two runs in the first off Ankiel, who suffered another postseason implosion.</p>
        <p>Ankiel, who threw five wild pitches in his division series start against the Atlanta Braves, fired his first pitch to the backstop, over Perez's head, and the crowd stirred.</p>
        <p>Was Ankiel trying to incite the Mets, whose general manager, Steve Phillips, said the Cardinals' Mike James had thrown at Mike Bordick in Game 1?</p>
        <p>No way. It quickly became obvious Ankiel could not put a pitch where he wanted it. Of his first 20 pitches, five went to the backstop and two were wild pitches. He allowed two runs before Britt Reames came in with four and a third innings of solid relief.</p>
        <p>Reames allowed only one run, a leadoff homer in the third to Piazza, who is 3 for 5 in this series and drove his homer to the opposite field. ''That's where I want to be,'' said Piazza, who was happier spreading credit to the rookies.</p>
        <p>''It's great to see Jay and Timo and the guys come through for us and execute,'' Piazza said. ''They want to be up there in those situations.''</p>
