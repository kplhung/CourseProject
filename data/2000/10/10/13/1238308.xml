        <p>First the meatpacking district, now the Lower East Side. In days gone by, it was artists who colonized the city's iffier neighborhoods, but they seem to have been supplanted by young chefs in search of nothing more than a little place to call their own.</p>
        <p>Barrio suggests a restaurant with a Latin bent, but the decor and the cuisine are aggressively global. There's a hacienda feeling to the stone staircase that leads upstairs, and the jumble of urns and vases above the open kitchen suggest a Mayan archaeological dig, but the artifacts are Asian. The menu, too, roams far and wide. The only rule is that ingredients must be organic and free of chemicals.</p>

        <p>First the meatpacking district, now the Lower East Side. In days gone by, it was artists who colonized the city's iffier neighborhoods, but they seem to have been supplanted by young chefs in search of nothing more than a little place to call their own.</p>
        <p>Barrio suggests a restaurant with a Latin bent, but the decor and the cuisine are aggressively global. There's a hacienda feeling to the stone staircase that leads upstairs, and the jumble of urns and vases above the open kitchen suggest a Mayan archaeological dig, but the artifacts are Asian. The menu, too, roams far and wide. The only rule is that ingredients must be organic and free of chemicals.</p>
        <p>Peruvian blue potatoes add a mildly Latin touch to the squid stuffing in a long, thin crispy roll that comes with pineapple and herb salad, but sirloin steak speaks with an Australian accent.</p>
        <p>It is served with a twice-baked potato and an earthy jus flavored with wattle seed, from an Australian bush related to acacia.</p>
        <p>Daniel Angerer, the executive chef, cooked most recently at Alouette, and before that at Bouley Bakery and Jean Georges, so his instincts are French but his range is global. For every dish like crustacean ravioli with a tamarind-basil pistou, there's a simple tomato tart with wild parsley, or seared bay scallops with peaches and pepper cress.</p>
        <p>In a reversal of the usual form, Mr. Angerer seems to get more adventurous with his entrees. Seared salmon, an unavoidable fish, takes on new signs of life with an accompaniment of butternut squash cubes, parsley spatzle and raisin-caper sauce. Roast chicken, another obligation, takes an unexpected turn with licorice jus.</p>
        <p>The dessert list is long, given the size of the restaurant, which operates around the clock. You can order simple -- poppy seed cake with coconut sorbet -- or you can go for the chocolate cone with avocado sorbet and mango mousse.</p>
        <p>Barrio, 99 Stanton Street, near Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 533-9212. Dinner entrees, $11 to $27.</p>
