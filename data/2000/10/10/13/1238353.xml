        <p>Of course the motoring public hasn't cut back. Just look around and what do you see? Roads clogged with more and larger sport utility vehicles, more and more cars with one occupant, and more and more people speeding. People are in a hurry to get somewhere two to five minutes faster.</p>

        <p>Of course the motoring public hasn't cut back. Just look around and what do you see? Roads clogged with more and larger sport utility vehicles, more and more cars with one occupant, and more and more people speeding. People are in a hurry to get somewhere two to five minutes faster.</p>
        <p>This is the generation that has no concept of what a shortage is, no concept of what it means to do with less or without.</p>
        <p>Before people learn to cut back, we will have to have a national shortage coupled with gas prices of up to $4 a gallon. The only way to get their attention is raise the price and limit the supply.</p>
        <p>Then perhaps they will slow down and think about smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles. It seems like the 70's all over again.</p>
