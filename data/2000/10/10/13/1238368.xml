        <p>The New York Times Company said yesterday that its third-quarter per-share earnings edged up, matching analysts' estimates, as the company faced higher newsprint costs and made a bigger investment in its Internet operations.</p>
        <p>Profit from operations was $63 million, or 37 cents a share, compared with $63.5 million, or 36 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. Sales rose 7.9 percent, to $787.3 million from $729.7 million.</p>

        <p>The New York Times Company said yesterday that its third-quarter per-share earnings edged up, matching analysts' estimates, as the company faced higher newsprint costs and made a bigger investment in its Internet operations.</p>
        <p>Profit from operations was $63 million, or 37 cents a share, compared with $63.5 million, or 36 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. Sales rose 7.9 percent, to $787.3 million from $729.7 million.</p>
        <p>Including special items, mainly a $22.2 million gain from the sale of four regional newspapers and nine telephone directories and a $3.8 million charge for work force reductions, net income rose 25 percent, to $75 million, or 44 cents a share, compared with $60 million, or 34 cents a share, in the period a year earlier.</p>
        <p>The earnings were bolstered by a 7.4 percent increase in advertising revenue at The New York Times, to $275.8 million, and a 5.3 percent increase in advertising revenue at The Boston Globe, to $118.4 million.</p>
        <p>Although growing advertising revenue continued to fuel the company's earnings, the rate of ad revenue growth at both The Times and The Globe was still below the sharp rate of increase in the 1999 third quarter. The slowdown comes after three quarters in which the newspaper industry as a whole -- and the Times Company and Dow Jones &amp; Company in particular -- experienced unusually strong advertising revenue growth.</p>
        <p>This trend, industry analysts said, is a reflection of the high performance levels of 1999, a gradual softening in some areas of the advertising market -- particularly the no-longer-highflying Internet sector -- and a recent increase in newsprint prices.</p>
        <p>William Drewry, an analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, said: ''Advertising trends are relatively sluggish versus earlier in the year, but they are not down and out. You have actually seen a little comeback in August and September from the air pocket in June and July. The signs continue to point to continued advertising growth, as long as the economy holds up.''</p>
        <p>Across the industry, said Michael Beebe, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs, ''what we're seeing is precisely what we expected -- a deceleration in top-line momentum combined with rising costs.''</p>
        <p>Shares of the Times Company fell $1.25, to $34.88.</p>
        <p>Dow Jones also posted third-quarter results yesterday and was able to improve upon the soaring numbers from the period a year earlier.</p>
        <p>Profit from operations rose to $48.4 million, or 55 cents a share, compared with $45.5 million, or 50 cents a share. Analysts had expected the company to earn 54 cents a share, according to First Call/ Thomson Financial, which tracks corporate earnings. Sales rose 6.7 percent, to $529.4 million from $496.2 million.</p>
        <p>But its bottom line was marred by a one-time write-off of $82.3 million, or 94 cents a share, on its convertible preferred stockholdings in Bridge Information Systems. It acquired the stake, originally valued at $150 million, as part of the $510 million sale of its Telerate unit to Bridge two years ago.</p>
        <p>Including the charge, Dow Jones reported a net loss of $33.9 million, or 39 cents a share. In the period a year earlier, a gain of $57.3 million, or 63 cents a share, from the company sale of its stake in United States Satellite Broadcasting, made net income $102.8 million, or $1.13 a share.</p>
        <p>Dow Jones's strongest growth came in its electronic publishing division -- which includes Internet properties like The Wall Street Journal Interactive Edition, the Dow Jones News Service and its 50 percent stake in Factiva, an online reference and information service. Electronic publishing revenue was $111.4 million, up 9.8 percent. Print publishing revenue at Dow Jones increased 5.4 percent.</p>
        <p>Shares of Dow Jones fell $1, to $56.19.</p>
        <p>The same overall trends affected the Gannett Company, which reported third-quarter earnings on Wednesday of $208.3 million, or 79 cents a share, up 5.3 percent from $197.8 million, or 70 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. The earnings matched Wall Street estimates.</p>
        <p>Gannett, which publishes 99 newspapers and has the industry's largest daily circulation, 7.4 million copies in the United States and 600,000 in Britain, achieved its gains despite the newsprint price increases, which tend to hit high-circulation companies hardest.</p>
        <p>Shares of Gannett were unchanged yesterday at $52.</p>
