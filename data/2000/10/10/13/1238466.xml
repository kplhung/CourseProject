        <p>Directed by Jonathan M. Flicker  Not rated; 87 minutes</p>
        <p>For a self-proclaimed hick from Nebraska, John Dietrich seems to have ingested a whole lot of yuppie philosophy before leaving home for college.</p>
        <p>First get into a Top-20 college. Then join a fraternity. Make the proper connections, get A's, and success follows.</p>
        <p>John (Sam Trammell) has a lot to learn, and his costly enlightenment is the subject of the well-intentioned but didactic and often heavy-handed film ''Followers.''</p>
        <p>Written, directed and edited by Jonathan M. Flicker, ''Followers'' is a cautionary tale worth telling to college students with the potential to figure in the annual headlines about fraternity excesses. And its lessons about the cost of remaining passive in the face of evil, of countenancing bigotry and of betraying friends bear reinforcement in any season. But while clearly rooted in pervasive truths, ''Followers'' -- which opens today at the Quad (34 West 13th Street, Greenwich Village) -- suffers from clumsy exposition and uneven acting, except in the case of Eddie T. Robinson. He plays Steven Trayer, a freshman from New York who becomes one of John's best friends at the fictitious Harrington College.</p>
        <p>With a third freshman, Allen Phillips (Jerry Laurino), they fancy themselves the new three musketeers. For a while all goes well. Steve has a red Mercedes Benz 380SL convertible and a sense of humor, though it often masks his hurts. Allen has some entree because his dad used to be a big man in the best frat. John soon acquires a sexually advanced girlfriend, Cynthia Gordon (Jessica Prunell).</p>
        <p>But a few things stand in the way of complete happiness. First and foremost is that best frat, Kappa Psi Lambda, which the three pals, especially John and Allen, hope to join. Another is its arrogant president, Jake Tyler (Mark Dobies), who also happens to be handsome, the captain of the football team and an academic all-American. Jake is a bigot, and Steve is black.</p>
        <p>But John takes one look at the goldfish swallowing, partying frat brothers of Kappa Psi Lambda, and the voice-over narration of his older, wiser self says, ''I knew I had to do whatever it took to be part of this.'' Just what he has to do becomes clear after he and Allen receive bids from the fraternity, and Steve does not. Despite protestations from John and Allen that this turn of events will not affect their friendship with Steve, it surely does, with a few assists from the evil Jake and despite the efforts of Cynthia to jolt John's better instincts back to life.</p>
        <p>''Followers'' may not be graceful or subtle; little of its action reflects the presence of classrooms or faculty at Harrington College. But there are always those who stand to profit from this film's instruction.</p>
