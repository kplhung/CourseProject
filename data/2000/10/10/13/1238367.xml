        <p>Advocates for more frequent disclosure of what mutual funds hold in their portfolios sparred with a top Securities and Exchange Commission official at a panel discussion here today.</p>
        <p>Don Phillips, chief executive of Morningstar Inc., which tracks mutual funds, told Paul F. Roye, the director of the S.E.C.'s division of investment management, that the agency had a double standard toward stockholders and mutual fund shareholders. Singling out Arthur Levitt, the chairman of the S.E.C., for criticism, Mr. Phillips said, ''He's brilliant when he talks about stocks,'' then added, ''When it turns to fund issues, he falls into patronizing platitudes about fund investing.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Levitt and the S.E.C. are about to start requiring companies to disclose material information to the public at the same time that they tell analysts and institutional investors. The new Regulation FD is to take effect on Oct. 23. But Mr. Phillips said that the S.E.C. had not applied similar rules to the $7 trillion mutual fund industry and that it should press the industry to disclose more frequently which stocks funds hold.</p>
        <p>Under current regulations, mutual funds are required to disclose their full holdings to the S.E.C. twice a year. Mr. Phillips thinks portfolios should be disclosed monthly, 90 days after the end of each month.</p>
        <p>For his part, Mr. Roye said he ''had to do a bit of an Al Gore'' and defend his boss's record.</p>
        <p>''The chairman is committed to protecting investors,'' he said, adding that it was ''an overstatement'' to say that all investors wanted more frequent disclosure of mutual fund portfolios. ''There's a group of investors that want more information, and there's also a group of investors who say they are inundated with information,'' Mr. Roye said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Roye suggested that large, closely watched funds like Fidelity's $104 billion flagship Magellan fund might have difficulty trading in and out of positions with too frequent disclosure and that there were higher priorities like making fund prospectuses easier to read and cracking down on efforts to manipulate fund performance figures just before the end of a quarter.</p>
        <p>Mr. Roye also said that his division would propose a rule requiring mutual funds to have 80 percent of their portfolios invested in the style, asset class or region indicated by the name of the fund, so that a European investment fund, for example, would have to be 80 percent invested in Europe. The current requirement is 65 percent.</p>
        <p>The panel discussion, which focused on the disclosure issue, was sponsored by Fund Democracy, a fund shareholder advocacy group founded by Mercer Bullard, a former lawyer for the S.E.C.'s enforcement division.</p>
        <p>Mr. Phillips and Harold R. Evensky, a financial planner, criticized the S.E.C.'s emphasis on simplification over portfolio disclosure.</p>
        <p>''You need to make the information available,'' Mr. Evensky said. ''Can you imagine a corporation just issuing a simple prospectus because the financials are too complicated?''</p>
