        <p>This morning we witnessed cold-blooded murder.

        <p>Following are excerpts from a statement today by Prime Minister Ehud Barak about the killing of Israeli soldiers and the military response, as recorded and translated by The New York Times:</p>
        <p>This morning we witnessed cold-blooded murder. A veritable lynching was perpetrated against two or perhaps three soldiers who accidentally found themselves at a Palestinian police roadblock. The two were abducted at gunpoint into Palestinian Authority territory and were held in a Palestinian police station in Ramallah. . . .</p>
        <p>An incited mob perpetrated a horrific and despicable lynching. . . .</p>
        <p>The responsibility for these grave actions is with the perpetrators and the Palestinian Authority, which exercises no control over its men.</p>
        <p>I therefore instructed the defense forces to strike at selected security targets in Ramallah and Gaza. The operation was carried out with precision and success, with a minimum of casualties.</p>
        <p>Chairman Arafat has apparently decided that he is not intent on reaching an arrangement and he is not acting -- and does not appear to us to be a partner -- for peace at this point.</p>
        <p>Regretfully, the Palestinian Authority is continuing to violate grossly the agreements we signed with American guarantees. Contrary to the agreements, it has released a number of prominent figures in Hamas and the Islamic Jihad. This is a grave step that attests to the possibility of renewed terror attacks. . . .</p>
        <p>The responsibility for terror attacks will be on the perpetrators, those who sent them and those who released them.</p>
        <p>We will know how to respond.</p>
