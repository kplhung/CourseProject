        <p>The great modernist sculptor David Smith produced ''The Last Nudes,'' a little-known series of paintings, in 1964, a few months before he died; they were not shown during his lifetime. On each white easel-scale canvas, Smith used an ear syringe loaded with black enamel paint to render the image of a naked woman. Deftly squirting, Smith was able to create loopy, blotchy, runny pictures that look like life-drawing exercises intended to help art students to loosen up.</p>

        <p>'The Last Nudes'</p>
        <p>Gagosian Gallery</p>

        <p>The great modernist sculptor David Smith produced ''The Last Nudes,'' a little-known series of paintings, in 1964, a few months before he died; they were not shown during his lifetime. On each white easel-scale canvas, Smith used an ear syringe loaded with black enamel paint to render the image of a naked woman. Deftly squirting, Smith was able to create loopy, blotchy, runny pictures that look like life-drawing exercises intended to help art students to loosen up.</p>
        <p>As drawings or paintings, these works have a certain graphic vitality, but they are otherwise barely worth a glance. It is amusing, on the other hand, to think about the Freudian implications -- the punning identification of painterly and sexual prowess, the emission of vital fluids. Adding another layer is a series of five of Smith's female nude photographs in a gallery hallway, all of which focus on a young woman's vagina. In two, she poses outdoors with one of Smith's monumental abstract sculptures rising up in the distance between her legs.</p>
        <p>There is a certain playfulness here, as there usually is in Smith's work, and the series was, after all, a respite from the labors of big steel sculpture making. Any sense of irony, however, is unfortunately absent. You get the feeling, rather, that Smith regarded himself as a veritable font of creative virility, in the image of Picasso or Pollock, which makes the squirt works seem all the more silly.</p>
