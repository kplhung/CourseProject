        <p>The United States and Yugoslavia signaled today that they would move quickly toward the re-establishment of diplomatic relations, which were severed as NATO began its 11-week bombing campaign here last year.</p>
        <p>A first meeting between James O'Brien, the special adviser to President Clinton for the Balkans, and Vojislav Kostunica, the newly elected Yugoslav president, produced no precise timetable for restoring diplomatic ties but demonstrated that a willingness to resolve the matter existed on both sides.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kostunica, who has criticized American ''meddling'' in Serbia before and since taking office, said there had been ''a gap in communication'' between Belgrade and Washington -- a tactful way of describing often bitter hostility. But he added, ''We hope we will bridge that gap and our relations normalize.''</p>
        <p>The meeting came as Mr. Clinton lifted the oil embargo and the ban on American flights to Yugoslavia that had been imposed in 1998 after President Slobodan Milosevic cracked down on Kosovo Albanians. Mr. Clinton said more significant sanctions, like the denial of much-needed lending from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, would be reviewed as the democratic transition that began last week with a popular uprising against Mr. Milosevic proceeds.</p>
        <p>In a statement in Washington, Mr. Clinton said: ''We have a strong interest in supporting Yugoslavia's newly elected leaders as they work to build a truly democratic society. The removal of these sanctions is a first step to ending Serbia's isolation.'' Yugoslavia is made up of the republics of Serbia and Montenegro.</p>
        <p>The United States is particularly eager to consolidate the fragile democratic change in Serbia because it is crucial to bolstering the chances of an enduring peace in the Balkans, where four wars in the last eight years have involved a sizable commitment of American resources to an unstable corner of Europe.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kostunica said today that he respected the 1995 Dayton agreement that brought peace to Bosnia, in effect committing himself to respecting Yugoslavia's border with Bosnia and the arrangement that grants Bosnian Serbs considerable self-rule in 49 percent of a Bosnia with a weak central government.</p>
        <p>He also committed himself to United Nations resolutions that provide for wide Albanian self-government in Kosovo.</p>
        <p>Speaking after a 90-minute meeting, Mr. O'Brien said Mr. Kostunica had agreed to ''work through some technical issues, with an aim to establishing diplomatic relations.'' Those issues include a need for him to consult with the Yugoslav Parliament over a decision that is delicate in the light of widespread anti-American feeling here.</p>
        <p>Any over-eager embrace of the United States would tend to undermine Mr. Kostunica's political standing at this stage because a majority of Serbs might see it as a form of moral surrender. Although the new president has enormous good will on his side after the uprising that forced Mr. Milosevic to finally concede defeat in last month's election, his hold on the levers of power is as yet partial.</p>
        <p>In the light of the delicate political situation and the enduring hostility over the NATO bombing, Mr. O'Brien said Mr. Kostunica did not want to appear to be ''picking favorites'' and favored a restoration of diplomatic ties with Washington that would be simultaneous with ''normalizing'' relations with Western European nations. This seems likely to occur within the next several weeks, officials said.</p>
        <p>The remaining sanctions provide Washington with some leverage in discussions over whether Mr. Milosevic, who has been indicated by the International Tribunal in The Hague, should stand trial for war crimes.  But it was clear that the United States, whose first priority is the consolidation of long-elusive democracy in Yugoslavia, would not push Mr. Kostunica to try the ousted leader or deliver him to The Hague in the near term.</p>
        <p>The Serbian uprising ended not with the violent removal of Mr. Milosevic but with a handshake between him and Mr. Kostunica that sealed an accord on the passage of power. What guarantees, if any, were given to Mr. Milosevic, who remains under guard in Serbia, are unclear.</p>
        <p>The former leader's domestic position appeared to weaken today as his Serbian Socialist Party said their hard-line secretary general, Gorica Gajevic, a woman intensely loyal to Mr. Milosevic, had been replaced by Zoran Andjelkovic, an official from Kosovo.</p>
        <p>The party called a special congress for Nov. 25, and one of its deputies in the Serbian Parliament, Miloje Mihajlovic, said Mr. Milosevic should quit on that occasion because he had lost the support of the members.</p>
        <p>It also appeared that a political rift had opened up between the Socialists and the Yugoslav Left Party of Mr. Milosevic's wife, Mira Markovic. The parties, allied in the election they lost to Mr. Kostunica, said they would run separately in Serbian parliamentary elections scheduled for later this year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kostunica appears quietly certain that his tempered political stance is steadily eroding Mr. Milosevic's support.</p>
        <p>While insisting that Yugoslavia must become more democratic and open to the West, the new president has been sharply critical of the NATO bombing campaign and of the war crimes tribunal, which he has described as a pawn of American political interests.</p>
        <p>Today, Mr. Kostunica renewed his criticism of the United States, but in far more muted terms, saying it had shown scant ''understanding'' of the political process in Serbia.</p>
