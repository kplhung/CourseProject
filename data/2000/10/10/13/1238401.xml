        <p>Congressional efforts to overhaul the nation's bankruptcy system appeared all but doomed today when the White House said that President Clinton would veto a last-ditch measure that sailed through the House.</p>
        <p>The bill, a compromise hammered out by House and Senate conferees, was adopted today by a voice vote and by all accounts enjoyed broad support by the House. A similar measure passed the House last year by a vote of 313 to 108.</p>
        <p>The central feature of the legislation is a provision imposing new income requirements on those in bankruptcy who wish to get a fresh start by making use of the debt-forgiveness provisions of the law.</p>
        <p>The bill generally provides that anyone able to make $6,000 to $10,000 in payments over five years would not be able to file for protection under Chapter 7 of the bankruptcy code, which enables them to have many types of debts forgiven.</p>
        <p>It offers an exception to those who make less than the median income in their region. For example, supporters of the bill said, a typical American family of four with an annual income of less than $51,000 would be able to have some debts forgiven.</p>
        <p>Lawmakers said the measure adopted by the House would be considered soon by the Senate, where three Democratic opponents -- Senators Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, Charles E. Schumer of New York and Paul Wellstone of Minnesota -- vowed today to try to kill it by a filibuster. Even if supporters of the bill overcome that obstacle and manage to get the legislation approved by the full Senate, where it enjoys broad support, the White House appears almost certain to have the last word.</p>
        <p>With votes on the final measure coming so late in the session, Mr. Clinton has the ability to kill the legislation by issuing his veto after Congress adjourns later this month, robbing the lawmakers of an opportunity to vote on an override.</p>
        <p>Still, backers of the bill hope it can become law this year by attaching it to an appropriations bill they believe the president must sign. The banking industry has spent tens of millions of dollars lobbying for the measure. Women's and consumer groups have spent far less opposing it.</p>
        <p>In a letter sent today to the Republican and Democratic leaders of the House, John D. Podesta, the White House chief of staff, said the bill failed to eliminate ''homestead'' exemptions in states like Florida and Texas. Those exemptions allow a person entering bankruptcy to shield an unlimited amount of money from creditors by investing it in an expensive home.</p>
        <p>''Unlimited homestead exemptions allow debtors who own lavish homes to shield their mansions from their creditors, while moderate-income debtors, especially those who rent, must live frugally under a rigid repayment plan for five to seven years,'' Mr. Podesta wrote.</p>
        <p>The measure adopted today would restrict, but not eliminate, the homestead exemption. It would cap the exemption at $100,000 if the home was acquired by the debtor in the two years before filing for bankruptcy. Home purchases before that period in homestead states would continue to be exempt from bankruptcy proceedings.</p>
        <p>Mr. Podesta also criticized the measure for dropping a provision in the Senate version of the bill that had been sponsored by Mr. Schumer. That provision would have prevented a person convicted of terrorizing or illegally blocking access to an abortion clinic from using the bankruptcy law to avoid civil and criminal penalties. The provision had been approved by the Senate, 80 to 17.</p>
        <p>Bank executives said they would continue to press the Clinton administration to reverse course and sign the measure, though they acknowledged that coming late in the session and near the end of the administration, they faced an uphill battle.</p>
        <p>''The White House is a problem,'' said Ed Yingling, the top lobbyist for the American Bankers Association. ''The truth is the objections raised by the White House were not central to the issues and are excuses.''</p>
        <p>But critics of the legislation applauded the White House's decision.</p>
        <p>''The proposed bankruptcy bill is a heartless attack on working families by powerful financial institutions and it has no place on the agenda of a Congress that has so much unfinished business and so little time,'' said John J. Sweeney, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.</p>
        <p>Supporters of the legislation repeated their view that the measure was essential to curbing abusive bankruptcy filings.</p>
        <p>''We guarantee a fresh start to any American who needs it,'' said Representative George W. Gekas, a Pennsylvania Republican who is the bill's main sponsor. ''But by the same token, we can't permit anyone to use bankruptcy as a financial planning tool.''</p>
        <p>As they have in the past, some Democrats today portrayed the legislation as a sop to banks and credit-card companies and spoke of hardships it would create, particularly for single parents and children.</p>
        <p>Under the legislation, credit-card companies could receive repayment of debt at the same rate as debts like child support. The bill's opponents also noted that in the last year, personal bankruptcy filings had been in sharp decline, dropping by more than 8 percent in the last year, eliminating the need for an overhaul.</p>
        <p>''As bankruptcy courts tell us, the bankruptcy filings are going down,  not up,'' said Representative John Conyers Jr., Democrat of Michigan. ''So what are we doing here? We are genuflecting to the awesome power of the credit lobby.''</p>
