        <p>New York City will pay a $20,000 settlement to a former police officer who claimed in a lawsuit that she was discriminated against for being gay, according to records released yesterday.</p>
        <p>Although the terms of the settlement with the former officer, Elizabeth Bryant, were kept secret when the deal was struck last month, a federal judge in Manhattan ordered the records made public at the request of The New York Times, The Daily News and The New York Post.  As part of the agreement, reached just after the lawsuit went to trial in Federal District Court in Manhattan, Ms. Bryant's lawyers will receive  $30,000 in fees, bringing the total value of the settlement to $50,000, the records show. The records also show that Ms. Bryant resigned immediately from the department as part of the settlement.</p>
        <p>News of the settlement drew widespread attention after the judge, Lewis A. Kaplan, sharply criticized the police department from the bench, based on the early testimony in the case, for apparently failing to investigate Ms. Bryant's claims adequately.</p>
        <p>Ms. Bryant, who was assigned to the 42nd Precinct station house in the Bronx, had testified that she was mocked and harassed by other officers and her supervisors after she and another officer, Marilyn Trapanotto, exchanged vows in Central Park in 1997.</p>
        <p>Ms. Bryant said her complaints to the department's Office of Equal Employment Opportunity were not investigated properly. The testimony of an investigator in that office, Sandra Williams, appeared to support her claim.</p>
        <p>The judge's criticism, the fact that Ms. Bryant had initially sought $10 million in compensatory and punitive damages, and the secrecy surrounding the settlement raised questions about whether she had obtained a large judgment against the city.</p>
        <p>The trial was also being monitored by the office of Mary Jo White, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York. In 1998, the Police Department reached an agreement with Ms. White's office to overhaul its system for investigating harassment complaints.</p>
