        <p>Karl Lagerfeld's show today for Chanel was literally switched on. ''I call it 'Walking on Light,' '' he said, referring to the latest cure for boredom, a platform sandal with a clear plastic sole that beams with neon light at each step. ''But it's not a red-light district.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lagerfeld likes his toys. In one of the photo diaries he keeps, there is a picture of his ideal pet, a robotic dog. At his house in Biarritz, turtlelike mowers roam the lawn, keeping it pristine. And amusement was what he had in mind for his spring collection, with its hyper mix of pearls and denim overalls, bathing suits and lace evening dresses, scuba tops and flounced cotton eyelet, and all on a runway of descending steps outlined with neon light.</p>

        <p>Karl Lagerfeld's show today for Chanel was literally switched on. ''I call it 'Walking on Light,' '' he said, referring to the latest cure for boredom, a platform sandal with a clear plastic sole that beams with neon light at each step. ''But it's not a red-light district.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lagerfeld likes his toys. In one of the photo diaries he keeps, there is a picture of his ideal pet, a robotic dog. At his house in Biarritz, turtlelike mowers roam the lawn, keeping it pristine. And amusement was what he had in mind for his spring collection, with its hyper mix of pearls and denim overalls, bathing suits and lace evening dresses, scuba tops and flounced cotton eyelet, and all on a runway of descending steps outlined with neon light.</p>
        <p>There were those signature Chanel tweeds and checks in pale green and orange but now in casual cotton and worn with ropes of pearls, maybe a pair of sunglasses with a neon wraparound visor and cork sandals, with Chateau Chanel stamped on the bottle-cork-shaped heels.</p>
        <p>How does a person think all this stuff up? Mr. Lagerfeld has a sixth sense for knowing what's in the fashion wind, and he responded to the current mood for deconstruction with jackets without sleeves and tweed tops whose multicolored seams looked like a catchy design detail but were, in fact, zippers.</p>
        <p>With the word ''Coco'' picked out in face veiling, Mr. Lagerfeld dashed off references to Chanel herself -- a pearly sequined camisole top over a black silk evening skirt; a sheer, striped beach coat in sunset hues. If there was a drawback to the huge production, it was that you couldn't make out the incredible details, like the tiny pearls on the models' manicured hands.</p>
        <p>Jean Paul Gaultier is a master of detail, too, but his show on Wednesday was a joyless ride through heavy-metal country. For a moment, it looked as if he were taking a swipe at John Galliano's rip-and-run style, with leather jackets reduced to just armorlike shoulders, and jeans cut down to one leg and shown with fishnets. The collection had great pieces, but on the dirt runway, with models chewing and spitting gum, the raunchy excess looked too easy.</p>
        <p>That Anglo-Saxon symbol of hospitality the pineapple, so resplendent on suburban door knockers, appeared as a tease on the pubic area of bikinis at Chloe. Stella McCartney's witty take on fruit also included bananas, as prints, bunched temptingly on a slouchy top, with the warning, ''Keep your bananas off my melons,'' on the back. These and Ms. McCartney's prints of horses -- rearing on shoulders of jackets or scattered in tiny herds across the fronts of dresses -- made for a very different Chloe show on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>It wasn't just the equine references, or the horse power displayed on a video screen, that gave Ms. McCartney's ladylike clothes a degree of heat not felt in previous collections, a deeper understanding of seduction. The difference was also in the cut -- the way a halter dress in steely gray linen draped extravagantly in the front and was shown with a mild-looking tweed coat the color of straw. The fact that many of the clothes were almost perversely pretty, often with mutton sleeves or sometimes with straight Saint Laurent shoulders and a jaunty fedora or fussy pillbox, suggested, too, that Ms. McCartney was pushing herself harder as a designer.</p>
        <p>Some of the rounded, Edwardian shoulders, exaggerated by narrow drainpipe sleeves and mean wasp waists, did scream of ''trying too hard,'' but then there were all those steed prints, and often on banal country-club dresses. Well, Ms. McCartney knows how to tell a good fashion joke. How straight can a dress really be if the horse's head is rearing up like a Ferrari hood ornament?</p>
        <p>Fake palm trees and a shallow reflecting pool were the props for Emanuel Ungaro's show on Wednesday. Was he suggesting that his salmon leather pants with a fringe of plisse silk down the sides was an oasis of chic in the middle of a fashion desert?</p>
        <p>Mr. Ungaro certainly has his whimsies. There were a lot of slithery, come-hither looks: draped tops, suede slips with bronze grommets, gauzy blouses that caused bosoms to spill out, tie-dyed animal stripes in fuchsia and pink, and the sort of cutesy headbands one associates with infant portraiture. Retailers will know how to pick the plums, but the monotonous presentation made one wish that one had taken up a craft, like knitting.</p>
        <p>Ann Demeulemeester opened her show on Wednesday night with miniskirts and roomy boyfriend coats swishing with long straight strands of black synthetic hair.</p>
        <p>The collection had a punk insolence, mainly for cummerbunds coated in what looked like metal dress snaps, but the overused reference didn't do justice to Ms. Demeulemeester's great sense of proportion (a metal-embroidered girdle worn low on the hips of a taupe jersey dress) or the boss elegance of a black wrap top worn with a hard leather belt and soft, low-riding pants.</p>
