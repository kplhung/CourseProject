        <p>Editorial says newly disclosed documents have revived racial profiling scandal in New Jersey, showing that police uncovered evidence of racial profiling by highway officers as early as 1996 and deliberately hid data from federal investigators; says Justice Dept must investigate matter vigorously to determine whether state police--or those to whom agency reported--illegally obstructed federal investigation</p>

        <p>The racial profiling scandal in New Jersey seemed to subside in 1999.

        <p>The racial profiling scandal in New Jersey seemed to subside in 1999. The Whitman administration admitted that some state police officers were stopping and searching motorists based on race and accepted a police monitoring procedure devised by the United States Justice Department. But newly disclosed documents have revived the scandal. They show that the police uncovered evidence of racial profiling by highway officers as early as 1996 and deliberately hid the data from federal investigators.</p>
        <p>The full extent of the deception is not yet clear. But the Justice Department needs to investigate the matter vigorously to determine whether the state police -- or those to whom the agency reported -- illegally obstructed the federal investigation.</p>
        <p>Minority motorists have long complained that state police officers along the New Jersey Turnpike single them out for drug searches based on race and ethnicity. These complaints were given credibility in 1996, when a Gloucester County judge ruled that state troopers had used illegal profiling along the southern end of the turnpike. The state police disputed that finding at the time and continued to insist that its officers operated without racial prejudice.</p>
        <p>Records supplied to lawyers who were suing the police for discrimination suggest otherwise. They show that the department's own internal audits produced evidence of racial profiling as early as the fall of 1996.</p>
        <p>The racial discrepancies in the data were so striking that the chief of internal affairs recommended a formal monitoring program that would have focused on officers who stopped disproportionate numbers of minority drivers. But according to a report in yesterday's Times by David Barstow and David Kocieniewski, senior officials rejected proposals aimed at ending the practice and instead pursued a strategy of withholding information from federal civil rights prosecutors. According to one document, the strategy of withholding information was discussed at the time with Gov. Christine Todd Whitman's attorney general, Peter G. Verniero, who has since been appointed to the New Jersey Supreme Court.</p>
        <p>The Times article was based on an analysis of 11,000 pages of newly released documents -- 40,000 pages are still to come. The record shows that the state police distorted the facts and violated the public trust. What the Justice Department needs to determine is whether the police also broke the law.</p>
