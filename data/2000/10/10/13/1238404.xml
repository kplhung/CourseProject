        <p>JUST after Kenneth Kimes, convicted murderer and confirmed mama's boy, put Court TV's Maria J. Zone in a stranglehold and jammed a black Paper Mate pen against her carotid artery during a Tuesday afternoon prison interview, he told the sobbing ''Crime Stories'' producer that she should realize he was doing her career an enormous favor by taking her hostage. They'd be infamous together.</p>
        <p>So what if her prior documentary subjects had included James Earl Ray, Dr. Martin Luther King's murderer, and Lynette Fromme, the Manson family follower who tried to assassinate President Gerald R. Ford. Mr. Kimes professed never to have heard of them, and had they ever turned an interview into a kidnapping, or sent a prison into a four-hour panic the way he did at the Clinton Correctional Facility in Dannemora, N.Y.?</p>
        <p>''This is your biggest story now,'' he said, tightening his grip and ordering her camera crew to make themselves scarce.</p>
        <p>''I don't want this story, Kenny,'' Ms. Zone protested. ''I want to go home to my two kids.''</p>
        <p>Two days later, the 115-pound Ms. Zone, 35 and running on what appears to be an inexhaustible stream of adrenaline, still isn't sure if Mr. Kimes meant to kill or maim her with his plastic pen. All she had wanted him to do was provide her ''with every journalist's dream, a confession.'' What she got was more, and less, drama than she bargained for.</p>
        <p>Her only souvenirs of the altercation are a stiff neck and shoulders; he didn't even leave an ink stain. There is also the revulsion at having spent so many hours in such an intimate position with a virtual stranger. No, worse than that: with a convicted killer who is serving a 125-year sentence for the 1998 murder of the socialite Irene Silverman and, with his mother, Sante, is awaiting extradition to California to face the death penalty in another murder.</p>
        <p>''I was sweating. He was sweating. I could feel his heart pounding against my back,'' Ms. Zone recalls, hair and makeup back to camera-ready perfection, chiffon scarf flung just so, perching on a chair in the office of Court TV's chairman, Henry Schleiff. ''And I was clutching him because I wanted to feel his every move, feel if he was going to stab me. It was disgusting.''</p>
        <p>Whatever his intentions, she knows that Mr. Kimes was right about their bizarre altercation putting her face front and center on the evening news. But Ms. Zone had wanted to play anchorwoman, not victim, on television. Now she says she wants to play neither.</p>
        <p>''I know people are going to say, 'Yeah, sure, Maria,' but I really did not think this thing would have the impact it did,'' says Ms. Zone, who manages to project an ingenuous air even after 13 years in broadcasting. (Must be the four years of doing kiddie shows in Scranton, Pa.) ''Since I wasn't hurt or killed, I thought it would be less of a story, and that was fine with me.''</p>
        <p>SHE spent Wednesday getting back to reality, changing her younger daughter's diapers and handling a deluge of media requests at home in Camillus, N.Y., where she lives with her husband, Joe, a sportscaster at WSTM-TV, the NBC affiliate in Syracuse.</p>
        <p>Besides seizing an unanticipated but obvious public-relations opportunity for Court TV, Ms. Zone says she did the interviews about her interview ''because I know what it's like to be on the other side, asking someone for their story. I hate to be turned down.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kimes's mother turned Ms. Zone down for this ''Crime Stories'' episode, the seventh she has done and the latest in a list that includes ''Fatal Encounter'' (about a convicted husband-killer) and ''Fatal Passion''(about the Delaware prosecutor Thomas Caputo's murder of his mistress).</p>
        <p>Why the fascination with murderers? Ms. Zone, a people lover, says she finds their motivation and audacity ''interesting.'' What about the argument that she brings them the attention they crave?</p>
        <p>''I don't think of it that way; I may be spreading their notoriety, but I wouldn't say I turn them into celebrities,'' she says, adding that her mother, Daisy, ''wants to know why I can't interview nice people.''</p>
        <p>''I know this sounds corny, but the morning I went to interview Kenneth, she warned me not to get into a hostage situation,'' says Ms. Zone. Instead of taking it as a premonition, she figured her mom had been ''watching too much TV.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Zone recalls herself as a television-crazed kid growing up in a Spanish-speaking single-parent home in Weehawken, N.J. By eighth grade, the news anchors Bill Beutel and Kaity Tong were her local role models and Barbara Walters her network icon.</p>
        <p>She graduated from New York University in 1987 with a degree in broadcast journalism. She worked briefly at WNYC-TV and WNYW-TV, then followed her spouse, ''the on-air person in the family,'' to Pennsylvania and Chicago, where she was hired for the A &amp; E Network's documentary series, ''American Justice.''</p>
        <p>Next up for Ms. Zone: she intends to finish her Kimes story. There are more interviews to do, though she will not, she says, take up the chat where she left off with Mr. Kimes. She never wants to see him again. But that doesn't mean she has given up on unraveling his motivation. Before Tuesday's ordeal, she had planned to rent ''The Grifters,'' the film about a team of mother-and-son con artists. She still does.</p>
        <p>PUBLIC LIVES  Correction:  October 17, 2000, Tuesday  The Public Lives profile on Friday, about Maria J. Zone, a television producer for Court TV's ''Crime Stories'' who was taken hostage at a New York prison last week by the convicted murderer Kenneth Kimes, misstated the outcome of a case covered in a previous episode of the program. The defendant, Terri Gilbert, was acquitted in 1998, not convicted, in the killing of her husband in New Mexico.</p>
        <p>The article also misstated the surname of a murderer from Delaware who was the subject of a different episode. He was Thomas J. Capano, not Caputo.</p>
