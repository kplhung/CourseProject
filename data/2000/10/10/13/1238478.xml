        <p>Egypt offered today to hold an emergency regional summit meeting, but President Clinton said that he would not attend until Palestinian and Israeli leaders had committed publicly to end the violence, a senior administration official said.</p>
        <p>''Both sides are saying, 'You first,' '' one official said, describing the tone of Mr. Clinton's conversations with Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel and Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader.</p>
        <p>The Egyptian leader, Hosni Mubarak, and King Abdullah of Jordan, who were also talking to the Palestinian and Israeli leaders, had not been able to extract such pledges either, an official said.</p>
        <p>''We have to get past the 'yes but,' responses,'' the official said. ''We are not yet at the 'yes' stage on stopping the violence.''</p>
        <p>After an intense day of telephone diplomacy, Mr. Mubarak, who had rebuffed a White House suggestion for a summit meeting in Egypt last weekend, shifted his attitude and offered to convene a meeting that would include Mr. Clinton, Israel, the Palestinians and Jordan.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mubarak spoke four times with Mr. Clinton today and issued the invitation with ''no strings attached,'' the official said.</p>
        <p>But the White House wanted both Mr. Barak and Mr. Arafat to announce publicly that they were stopping the cycle of violence before Mr. Clinton would agree to such a meeting, the official said.</p>
        <p>That task was proving so difficult, a senior official said, that the urgent goal of a summit meeting would be to stop the violence and find some measures to restore calm.</p>
        <p>The long-term goal of peacemaking, which the administration had been touting until today, would be secondary.</p>
        <p>Israeli helicopters had barely completed their retaliatory strikes against the Palestinians after the  killing of two Israeli soldiers today when Mr. Clinton went into the Rose Garden to appeal for calm.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton, seeing more than seven years of his Middle East peacemaking disappear in mob violence and retaliatory bombings, ''strongly'' condemned the killings.</p>
        <p>''While I understand the anguish Palestinians feel over the losses they have suffered, there can be no possible justification for mob violence,'' he said. Saying that now was the time to stop the violence, Mr. Clinton said: ''The alternative to the peace process is now no longer merely hypothetical. It is unfolding today before our very eyes.''</p>
        <p>Despite the lack of progress with the Israeli and Palestinian leaders, the White House appeared relieved tonight that they had been able to get the moderate Arab states of Egypt and Jordan involved in a mission to restore calm. Officials seemed reassured, for example, after engineering a three-way telephone call among Mr. Arafat, Mr. Mubarak and Mr. Clinton.</p>
        <p>In the last few days, administration officials have expressed fears that Egypt was more concerned with an approaching Arab League summit meeting than with ending the violence. The Arab League meeting is scheduled for Oct. 21 and 22 in Cairo, and Iraq has been invited.</p>
        <p>Mr. Arafat, they said, was looking toward the Arab summit meeting as a place where he could further cement the sweeping support he has received in Arab street demonstrations in the last two weeks.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Clinton worked the telephones, his director of central intelligence, George J. Tenet, was in Israel scrambling for ways to get the security forces of both sides to try and cooperate again.</p>
        <p>When the Israeli attack helicopters struck targets very close to Mr. Arafat's headquarters in Gaza, Mr. Tenet was on his way there to see him, an American official said.</p>
        <p>A delegation of senior United Nations officials from New York was in Mr. Arafat's headquarters when bombs struck at targets some 200 yards away.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tenet, whose agency has been the conduit for Israeli and Palestinian security forces to work together over the last two years, was scheduled to see Mr. Barak late tonight, the official said. He was also expected to see Mr. Arafat, with whom he has good relations, the official said.</p>
        <p>Operation centers that were established by both sides' security forces after a meeting in Paris last week had collapsed after today's events.</p>
        <p>Administration officials described grievances that were deeply felt by both Mr. Barak and Mr. Arafat and said that much of the conversation between them and Mr. Clinton was absorbed with each side blaming the other for the rapid descent into bloodshed.</p>
        <p>For the first time today, administration officials acknowledged what they have been saying privately for nearly a week: that getting the peace process functioning again would be a near impossibility during the remainder of the Clinton administration.</p>
        <p>''We have to look at this realistically,'' a senior administration official said in a White House briefing. ''First things first. First, stop the violence. Second, begin to find ways to build some confidence-building measures between the two sides and only then will you know whether or not you can go back to peacemaking in the way that we were.''</p>
