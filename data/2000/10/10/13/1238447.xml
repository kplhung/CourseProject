        <p>With two debates down and one to go, the presidential candidates returned to swing states today as Vice President Al Gore stepped up his assault on George W. Bush's record as governor of Texas and the Bush campaign exulted in what it characterized as a turning-point moment in the 2000 campaign.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore opened a two-front offensive while campaigning today in Wisconsin. As the vice president accused Mr. Bush of misplacing his priorities in Texas, particularly on health care, his campaign chairman sought to focus attention on the governor's misstatement in the debate about the racially motivated murder of James Byrd Jr. in Jasper, Tex.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush, meanwhile, traveled to Pennsylvania, where he accused Mr. Gore of making ''fear, division and misrepresentation'' the hallmarks of the final stage of his campaign. The mood of the Bush campaign was ebullient after Wednesday's debate in which aides felt that Mr. Bush had survived prolonged questioning about foreign policy, his biggest weakness.</p>
        <p>The confidence seemed to exceed the traditional post-debate spin. About an hour after the debate ended, an ABC News producer overheard Karen P. Hughes, Mr. Bush's communications director, speaking on the telephone to another aide who was with Mr. Bush, about instant polls showing that Mr. Bush had won the debate.</p>
        <p>''Tell him that he just became president of the United States,'' Ms. Hughes instructed the aide.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's campaign chairman, William M. Daley, predicted that the instant polls would prove meaningless. He pointed out that such polls favored Mr. Gore after the first debate last week in Boston, but that the numbers quickly turned toward Mr. Bush as news reports focused on Mr. Gore's factual mistakes.</p>
        <p>''If I were him, I wouldn't take a lot of comfort in that,'' Mr. Daley said of the post-debate polls. No single debate, he said, ''is going to be a determinant in this election and move big numbers.''</p>
        <p>If Mr. Gore was concerned about the debate, he showed no public signs of it today. He delivered a vigorous speech before a large crowd in Milwaukee, and joked in an interview with the NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw about his subdued performance. ''I put all my sighs in a lock box,'' he said. The third and final debate will be on Tuesday in St. Louis.</p>
        <p>In perhaps the ultimate demonstration of the political power of incumbency, Mr. Gore cut short his schedule in Milwaukee this afternoon and returned to Washington to monitor events in the Middle East and, in the process, to reinforce the notion of his foreign policy expertise.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore did not cancel any public events; he had been planning to fly to  Washington this afternoon to attend a high school football team dinner with his son, Albert.</p>
        <p>But he left Wisconsin after a midday rally, about two hours ahead of schedule, to join President Clinton in discussing America's response to today's attack on an Navy destroyer in Yemen.</p>
        <p>''He's vice president, he's part of the national security team, and a situation like this requires that the full team be in place,'' said Chris Lehane, a spokesman for the Gore campaign.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lehane said the schedule change was not a campaign stunt. ''This is not about politics,'' he said. ''This is about peace in the Middle East.''</p>
        <p>A vice-presidential spokesman, Jim Kennedy, said this evening that Mr. Gore did attend the dinner with his son.</p>
        <p>Earlier in Milwaukee, Mr. Gore spoke to several thousand people under brilliant skies in Cathedral Square. His wife, Tipper, was at his side as he offered one of his most cogent explanations of the choice to be made in the 2000 election.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore argued that Mr. Bush's record as Texas governor provided voters with ''an important window on to what his priorities are.'' And he said that record was particularly relevant because Texas enjoyed a large surplus at the beginning of Mr. Bush's first term, just as the federal government does now.</p>
        <p>''If you were governor of the state that ranked dead last, 50 out of 50, in health insurance for families,'' Mr. Gore said, ''and all of a sudden you found that you had the biggest surplus in the history of your state, wouldn't it occur to you to use some of that surplus to maybe move up in the rankings on health care for families from 50 to 45 or 40 or even better? That's not what happened there.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's aides have promised an intensified attack on Mr. Bush's record on health care, the environment, gun control and the minimum wage. But they had left the impression that the burden would be carried by television advertising, surrogates and Mr. Gore's running mate, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, who campaigned today in Texas.</p>
        <p>But today, Mr. Gore spoke for himself.</p>
        <p>''This is not a question about my opponent's heart,'' he said, referring to Mr. Bush's assertion in the debate that the vice president seems to consider him a hard-hearted person.  ''It's a question about his priorities. His priorities are different from mine and I think they're different from yours.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore said he readily acknowledged that his proposed menu of middle-class tax cuts, worth about $500 billion over 10 years, was far smaller than Mr. Bush's plan for a $1.3. trillion across-the-board tax cut.</p>
        <p>''Because my tax cut is smaller and doesn't give a huge windfall to the wealthiest of the wealthy,'' he said, ''it lets us take care of other urgent priorities like health care for all of our children. To me this is not an argument about numbers. It's an argument about values. It's an argument about who we are as our nation. Where are our hearts?''</p>
        <p>Shortly before Mr. Gore spoke, Mr. Daley held a conference call with reporters to argue that Mr. Bush should be held accountable for his misstatement in last night's debate in the same way that Mr. Gore's factual errors were scrutinized last week.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush, during a discussion of hate crimes legislation, said that all three men who were convicted of murdering Mr. Byrd, who was dragged to his death in 1998, were ''going to be put to death.'' In fact, one of the three was sentenced to life in prison, and all three are in the early stages of their appeals.</p>
        <p>''I think he exaggerated, and I think he didn't know what he was talking about,'' Mr. Daley said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Daley and other Gore representatives, including a Harvard Law School professor, Laurence H. Tribe, also maintained that Mr. Bush's assertion as the chief law enforcement official in Texas could be found prejudicial to judges or juries that consider the cases in the future.</p>
        <p>Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, acknowledged that Mr. Bush had erred.</p>
        <p>''The difference,'' Mr. Fleischer said, ''is that the voters differentiate between innocent mistakes and a pattern of exaggerations about yourself. There is no moral equivalence.''</p>
        <p>In a packed gymnasium at Neshimany High School in Langhorne, Pa., Mr. Bush spoke about ''the greatest generation'' and focused on his plans to change Social Security and overhaul Medicare by coaxing people into private insurance plans, some of which could include a prescription drug benefit.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Gore asserts that the Bush plan would fail to guarantee drug benefits to all of the elderly, it amounts to scare tactics, Mr. Bush said.</p>
        <p>''As the election nears, he has fallen back on a familiar strategy: fear, division and misrepresentation,'' Mr. Bush said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore, he said, ''represents the party of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, but all he has to offer is fear itself.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush also criticized the Clinton administration for rejecting the recommendations of a bipartisan Congressional commission that proposed to reform Medicare by encouraging private insurers to compete with government coverage plans.</p>
        <p>''That's exactly why the time has come for a new administration,'' he said. ''On Social Security and on Medicare, the routine of the Clinton-Gore administration is so predictable, so tired and so partisan.''</p>
        <p>''Meanwhile,'' he added, ''the problems grow deeper and the solutions get harder.''</p>
