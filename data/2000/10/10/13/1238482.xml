        <p>Following are excerpts from yesterday's  debate between the New Jersey senatorial candidates Jon S. Corzine and Representative Bob Franks, as recorded by The New York Times.</p>
        <p>Campaign Spending</p>
        <p>Q: Congressman, you have repeatedly said in this campaign that you have big problems with Mr. Corzine's decision to spend a record amount of money, what could amount to $60 million, for his campaign this year. But you supported Steve Forbes, who spent $70 million of his own money for two unsuccessful attempts at the presidency. What's the difference between that campaign and this one?</p>

        <p>Following are excerpts from yesterday's  debate between the New Jersey senatorial candidates Jon S. Corzine and Representative Bob Franks, as recorded by The New York Times.</p>
        <p>Campaign Spending</p>
        <p>Q: Congressman, you have repeatedly said in this campaign that you have big problems with Mr. Corzine's decision to spend a record amount of money, what could amount to $60 million, for his campaign this year. But you supported Steve Forbes, who spent $70 million of his own money for two unsuccessful attempts at the presidency. What's the difference between that campaign and this one?</p>
        <p>MR. FRANKS: I have absolutely no objection to Jon taking his enormous personal wealth and trying to buy a seat in the United States Senate. The Supreme Court of the United States has declared that, for the purposes of one's own candidacy, one's money is the equivalent of freedom of speech. But it is remarkable to measure the scope of the money that Jon is prepared to spend in an effort to buy this election. . . . When a candidate relies to that extent on their own personal wealth as a source of their own campaign financing, I think it's particularly important that they lay out all their personal finances in order that the people of New Jersey can make their own independent assessment as to whether or not, when Jon, if he gets to the United States Senate, will be facing a conflict of interest.</p>
        <p>MR. CORZINE: I think the people of New Jersey are smart enough, informed enough, to make a very clear decision about who's going to represent their interest with regard to the issues that matter to them: Who's going to work to provide access at health care and security for our hospitals, who's going to provide a prescription-drug benefit for seniors under Medicare that works? I think making sure that we invest in our educational system are the kinds of things that voters want to hear people talk about. Elections are about ideas. They're not about money. . . .</p>
        <p>Q: Mr. Corzine, during the primary, you said you needed to spend as much as you did, a record $35 million, largely to overcome decades of name recognition built by your opponent at the time, former Gov. Jim Florio. Yet in the general election campaign, you're continuing on a record pace, spending more on television commercials alone -- $19 million -- than both New Jersey U.S. Senate candidates spent combined in the 1996 contest. What's the rationale for your current high level of spending?</p>
        <p>MR. CORZINE: Well, first of all, Jim, I don't accept the assumption that we're going to spend $19 million on television buys in this election. I think the estimates that people have seen on the purchases put out or the buy orders, it's $12 million. I believe that we need to make sure that people have clear ideas about what it is I'm trying to represent to the New Jersey public. . . .</p>
        <p>MR. FRANKS: Let me say it again. Back in the primary election, Jon Corzine estimated the cost of just one of his universal programs, universal health care, to cost between $55 and $65 billion. Now he tells us today, months afterwards, that he can do his whole universal spending program on that myriad of programs and cost basically the same amount of money. Jon, I've got to tell you, if you did this kind of math at Goldman Sachs, I'd be standing here debating Jim Florio. You've got to be consistent. You've got to tell the people the truth. The reality is you've got the most aggressive expansion of the federal government in your plan in recent history.</p>
        <p>MR. CORZINE: Bob, I've been a businessman for 30 years, dealt with real numbers, real budgets, real accountability to a bottom line. And I think I know how to count very effectively. We've gone to outside sources and had our program assessed by people other than those in the campaign. I stand by the numbers.</p>
        <p>Financial Disclosure</p>
        <p>Q: Mr. Corzine, given the fact that you are using so much of your own money to finance this campaign, and given the fact that you have not been forthcoming about -- initially forthcoming about some of your charitable contributions to groups that later endorsed you, don't you think that you owe New Jersey's voters -- New Jersey voters full public disclosure here? Can't you go back to your former employer, Goldman Sachs, and find a solution ----</p>
        <p>MR. CORZINE: No. . . .</p>
        <p>Q: to let them out of this -- to let you out of this confidentiality agreement? Perhaps you could do what the F.B.I. does, redact parts of it.</p>
        <p>MR. CORZINE: we have gone to the people of Goldman Sachs, Congressman Franks has gone to the people of Goldman Sachs and asked them to release my tax return. I'm not going to enter public service by breaking the law. I signed a contract, people expect people to fulfill their obligations. I'm going to fulfill my obligations going forward as a United States Senator, fulfilling on the pledges, working to meet those pledges.</p>
        <p>You know, this whole issue is one where I have gone well beyond the letter of the law. We've put up on our Web site everything that our charitable foundation has given to. We've given information on what we've paid in taxes and what our deductions are. We filed a Senate ethics report which tells everyone what my assets are and what I'm going to spend on. You know, we've gone well beyond what Governor Bush or Secretary Cheney have done, and I don't hear the same kind of complaint coming out of my opponent with regard to their disclosure.</p>
        <p>MR. FRANKS: Now, folks, this is an issue of trust. What's more important? Is it more important to protect a small group of people at Goldman Sachs or is it more important to win the confidence and trust of the eight million people who are proud to call New Jersey their home? Mr. Corzine should find a way to make this information available to the people of New Jersey. And if he can't, I question whether or not his entrance into this race was fully considered.</p>
        <p>Race Relations</p>
        <p>Q: Mr. Corzine, racism continues to be a big problem in this country. Should you be elected, how would you go about attacking this problem and how would your approach differ from your opponent's?</p>
        <p>MR. CORZINE: Well, I haven't heard Congressman Franks speak explicitly about race relations, so I'll let him answer that question. I believe we ought to ban and outlaw racial profiling. I think we need to confirm our support for affirmative action in our society. I think we need to make sure there's equal pay for equal work. . . .</p>
        <p>MR. FRANKS: In terms of racial profiling, it's dead wrong. There should be a sweeping federal statute enacted immediately that gets rid of it at every level. It's not just about stops on the New Jersey Turnpike, it's a pattern of practice at the U.S. Customs Service. We have to root it out wherever we find it in this country. . . . I have written hate-crimes legislation with Bob Torricelli, passed it into law. Now college campuses across the country are required to report on the incidences of any hate crimes. . . .</p>
        <p>Q: . . . How do you separate, what's the difference between a violent crime that's a hate crime and a violent crime against an individual that is not a hate crime, by definition? . . .</p>
        <p>MR. FRANKS: It goes in my judgment to the question of motive on the part of the person perpetrating the crime. If an individual targets a victim merely on the basis of their race or their sexual orientation, I believe that aggravates the nature of that serious crime. The result may be the same, a severe beating or a killing. But in my judgment, attacking someone on the basis of what they are and who they are should bump up that crime to stiffer penalties. Those kinds of hate crimes tear at the very fabric of American society. . . .</p>
        <p>MR. CORZINE: Well, first of all, I'd agree with the definition of a hate crime. . . . I think these kinds of things need to be met by real action. Anti-hate crimes, I think, are strong statements that the federal government will be a partner with the states in seeking prosecution and solution to problems that may be harder to resolve than just at a local level.</p>
        <p>Education</p>
        <p>Q: Mr. Corzine, . . . your campaign literature said that what you would do is to double the current level of federal spending by combining money from the Head Start program and federal dollars now going into public schools. Well, the total across the nation, only 6 to 7 percent of school districts across -- only federal dollars are now only paying 6 to 7 percent of school district budgets across the nation. What is the price tag of your proposals? How would you pay for it? Would you support tax increases to sustain it?</p>
        <p>MR. CORZINE: Couple of points, first of all, it's K through 12, about 7 percent of the federal budget's expenditures on education go nationally to the states. Unfortunately, here in New Jersey is only about 3 1/2 percent of our K through 12 expenditures. I think New Jersey's getting short changed. . . .</p>
        <p>MR. FRANKS: I think this is more evidence that Jon's a little bit fiscally confused on some of these issues. . . . he's running for the Senate on a bold plan for the future: universal health care for all Americans; universal long-term care for all our seniors; universal licensing and registration of guns; universal access to quality education from preschool to a college degree. When he mentioned the words universal health care, there was no caveat, no access, no phase-in. Universal access, universal health care for all Americans and universal long-term care for all of our seniors. Now he's telling us he can do all of these programs for $65 billion when he estimated the price tag of just one of these programs in the primary at between $55 and $65 billion. The numbers don't add up, Jon.</p>
