        <p>Renzo Piano, who attained the highest formal honor an architect can achieve when he won the Pritzker Architecture Prize in 1998, once wondered if he should have been a contractor. After all, his grandfather, father and brother were all builders.</p>
        <p>Instead, Mr. Piano has become one of the world's foremost architects, whose buildings have maintained, perhaps in honor of family tradition, a visceral connection to the craftsmanship of building.</p>
        <p>Born in 1937 in Genoa, Italy, Mr. Piano studied at the Milan Polytechnic Architecture School before embarking on a partnership with Richard Rogers, at the time a young British architect interested in architecture that boldly expressed its structure. Together they began competing for work, most famously winning the assignment to design the Centre Pompidou in Paris, which was built in 1977.</p>
        <p>The over-scaled tectonics and blaring white tubes of the Centre Pompidou were confronted with outrage at first, and brought Mr. Rogers and Mr. Piano into the public eye. Mr. Piano once told Peter Buchanan, the author of a four-volume collected works on the architect, that he considered the building ''an act of loutish bravado.''</p>
        <p>It triggered a turning point, leading Mr. Piano back to Italy, where he operated for years outside the main currents of contemporary architecture. He became involved in historical reconstruction, and developed a career-long commitment to researching the impact of context and culture, especially when combined with new technologies, on architecture. His museum for the Menil Collection in Houston, built in 1987 with mechanized baffles responsive to temperature as well as light, established his ability to deploy engineering in the service of a poetic naturalism.</p>
        <p>In 1989, he formed the Renzo Piano Building Workshop, an office cum research and education center outside Genoa, glass pavilions descending by terraces down a rocky bluff above the Mediterranean. From there, and at another office in Paris, he employs more than 100 people and has undertaken a prodigious output of buildings -- apartment houses, factories, museums, terminals, theaters and churches -- scattered around the world.</p>
        <p>The buildings vary in scale from the intimate gallery for Cy Twombly paintings in Houston (1995) to the vast Kansai Air Terminal in Japan (1990-94), a megastructure that is more than a mile long but has the graceful simplicity of a glider. The terminal sits on an island in Osaka Bay that was made expressly for it. His Jean-Marie Tjibaou Cultural Center in New Caledonia has wood staves that look like the looming skeletons of huts belonging to the local Kanak people. ''It is on the edge between architecture and anthropology,'' Mr. Piano said last night.</p>
        <p>Known to be spectacularly charming, even by Italian standards, Mr. Piano works in teams that sometimes include his second wife, Milly. He has two sons, Carlo, a journalist in Milan, and Matteo, an industrial designer in Genoa; his daughter Lia is studying literature in Rome. Recently, the couple adopted a third son, 17-month-old Giorgio, whom visitors sometimes find proudly perched on his father's drafting table, perhaps already wondering if he should be architect, builder or both.</p>
