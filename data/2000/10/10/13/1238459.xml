        <p>Kendall Gill is enjoying the comforts of home this season. The 6-foot-5 Nets veteran has embraced his return to his natural position, shooting guard, after a four-year exile at small forward. He looks like a man who appreciates what he missed.</p>
        <p>Only Gill is not missing much so far.</p>
        <p>In the Nets' preseason victory over Miami on Wednesday, Gill made 7 of 10 shots from the floor, including two clutch baskets in the final five minutes. This was a rare performance for a spotty jump shooter whose shooting percentage hovered at 41 percent last season.</p>
        <p>And it was a promising, albeit premature, sign for a team entering the season weakened by injury and inconsistency at shooting guard.</p>
        <p>''Kendall has played very well all training camp, and then last night, not only was he shooting the ball well, he had seven steals,'' the Nets' president, Rod Thorn, said today. ''I think it's a good first step.''</p>
        <p>Gill is returning to shooting guard because Kerry Kittles, whose arrival as the first-round draft pick in 1996 caused Gill to be moved to small forward, will be recovering from knee surgery this season. But even before Gill knew that he would be switched this season, or even that he would stay with the Nets, he knew he had to make some changes.</p>
        <p>''Over the summer, I watched film because I said, 'There's got to be something going on,' so I checked it out,'' Gill said today. ''I wanted to go back to the way I used to play.''</p>
        <p>He shot 46.7 percent in 1991-92, his second season in the league, when he averaged 20.5 points with Charlotte. And he shot 44.3 percent in 1996-97 with the Nets, when he averaged a career-best 21.8 points while playing small forward.</p>
        <p>While watching tapes at his house in Chicago over the summer, Gill discovered that he had been swinging his right elbow out while setting his shot, instead of straightening it inside. ''I've always been able to shoot, but I've never had a really consistent jump shot,'' he said.</p>
        <p>His new coach, Byron Scott, recognized Gill's mechanical flaw immediately while poring over tape to prepare for the job. When he was with the Lakers, Scott would do the same thing. ''When I first saw Kendall, his mechanics weren't great,'' Scott said. ''Then, when I first saw him here, he made a change.''</p>
        <p>Early in training camp, Scott offered Gill some advice that he had received from Jerry West, the Lakers' former executive vice president for basketball operations. ''Jerry West would tell him the same thing when he was in a slump,'' Gill said. ''When he kept his elbow straight, he got out of the slump. Jerry West, Byron Scott, I think I'll take their advice.''</p>
        <p>While the Nets were looking to sign other free-agent shooting guards this summer, they wound up vying with the Lakers to re-sign Gill, who is 32. Gill signed a $7 million, one-year deal with the Nets in August, after listening to an appeal from Lewis Katz, the Nets' principal owner. He turned down a $2.5 million contract offer from the Lakers.</p>
        <p>Gill will be making $1.4 million more than last season, but said he was not trying to prove he was worth the investment. ''I really didn't think about how I'm going to make a statement,'' he said. ''It's all about having the confidence of a two-guard mentality. With the contract out of the way, I can focus on the season.''</p>
        <p>Gill sat out most of practice today with a mild toe injury.</p>
        <p>His change in arm angle seems to be complementing his change in position. ''It's easier, because I don't have to play against guys 5 inches taller and 30 pounds heavier than me,'' Gill said. The former small forward said he thought he had held his own at his old position. ''But I'm back at 2-guard, and hopefully I can continue to play well,'' he said.</p>
        <p>REBOUNDS</p>
        <p>Forward KEITH VAN HORN sat out practice Thursday with a strained ligament in his left knee. It is unlikely that he will play in the Nets' preseason game Saturday in Estero, Fla., against Miami. Van Horn will decide whether he will play, Coach BYRON SCOTT said. . . . The rookie free agent KEVIN FREEMAN sat out practice with a sore hip.</p>
