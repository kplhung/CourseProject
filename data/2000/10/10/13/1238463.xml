        <p>It's funny how the past tends to look rosier the more distant it becomes. Take the cozy little world of ''Just Looking,'' a tiny but endearing coming-of-age movie set mostly in Queens in 1955. The movie's picture of outer-borough New York City back then evokes a warmer, cleaner, more orderly way of life than you'll find anywhere in the city nowadays. At times it suggests an ethnically diverse, more densely populated urban answer to the Springfield of ''Father Knows Best.'' If Mickey Rooney was already being supplanted by James Dean as Hollywood's archetypal teenager, and ''Rock Around the Clock'' was rumbling on the horizon, the old clean-cut cultural order had yet to surrender to the grimier, more lubricious rock-and-roll future.</p>

        <p>It's funny how the past tends to look rosier the more distant it becomes. Take the cozy little world of ''Just Looking,'' a tiny but endearing coming-of-age movie set mostly in Queens in 1955. The movie's picture of outer-borough New York City back then evokes a warmer, cleaner, more orderly way of life than you'll find anywhere in the city nowadays. At times it suggests an ethnically diverse, more densely populated urban answer to the Springfield of ''Father Knows Best.'' If Mickey Rooney was already being supplanted by James Dean as Hollywood's archetypal teenager, and ''Rock Around the Clock'' was rumbling on the horizon, the old clean-cut cultural order had yet to surrender to the grimier, more lubricious rock-and-roll future.</p>
        <p>''Just Looking,'' directed by Jason Alexander from Marshall Karp's semiautobiographical screenplay, resurrects this moment with an almost anthropological precision. The movie's likable protagonist, Lenny (Ryan Merriman), is a naive, sexually curious 14-year-old Jewish boy who lives in the Bronx with his mother, Sylvia (Patti LuPone), and his stepfather, the local butcher Polinsky (Richard V. Licata), whom he loathes.</p>
        <p>Lenny pursues a sexual obsession that's a little racier than that of the average boy his age. He longs to watch a couple having sex, and goes to risky lengths, peeping through keyholes and lurking in the grass with binoculars in a futile effort to satisfy his curiosity.</p>
        <p>When Sylvia decides that Lenny should spend the summer with his pregnant aunt, Norma (Ilana Levine), and her Italian-American husband, Phil (Peter Onorati), in a more suburban section of Queens, Lenny pleads not to go. But his summer away from home proves to be an enchanted one. He befriends three teenagers -- two girls and a boy -- and joins their ''sex club,'' in which they solemnly (and amusingly) swap whatever scant information they've been able to glean about the birds and the bees.</p>
        <p>While working in Phil's store, Lenny also meets Hedy (Gretchen Mol), a beautiful nurse twice his age who once modeled underwear, and he begins scheming to find a way to spy on her and her doctor boyfriend (John Bolger) in bed. But gradually he and Hedy develop a mutually nurturing friendship that has an undertow of poignancy. The movie builds to a moment of medium-high drama in which family revelations pour out and Lenny learns something about adult fallibility.</p>
        <p>''Just Looking'' is a candy-colored, unabashedly sentimental movie whose characters, for all their flaws, are basically decent people doing their best in sparer times than today.  As in so many retrospective rite-of-passage movies, the film's view of the past is the smoothed-out double vision of a grown-up reliving his own adolescence but with an adult perspective that discerns structure and meaning in events. The film's lovely performances embody this double vision. Although realistic, they also have a glow of nostalgia. Ms. Mol, in her most captivating screen performance to date, is every inch the mid-50's working-class dream girl.</p>
        <p>But the storytelling (especially near the end) is a little too pat, and the tone of the movie a little too sugary for ''Just Looking'' to be a period classic like Barry Levinson's  ''Diner.'' In the end it feels like a warmhearted extended sitcom struggling to be something deeper and richer without quite making the grade.</p>
        <p>''Just Looking'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has sexual situations.</p>
