        <p>Egypt offered to hold an emergency regional summit meeting, but President Clinton said he would not attend until Palestinian and Israeli leaders had publicly committed themselves to end the violence, a senior administration official said.</p>
        <p>Administration officials said talks Mr. Clinton held with Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Yasir Arafat were dominated by each side's effort to blame the other for the bloodshed. And they acknowledged that reviving the peace effort would be a near impossibility in the administration's remaining time.</p>
