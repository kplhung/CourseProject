        <p>In worry and uncertainty, more than 100 spouses and children waited together through the day at the Norfolk Naval Base for some official word on precisely who perished and who survived the explosion on the destroyer  Cole.</p>

        <p>In worry and uncertainty, more than 100 spouses and children waited together through the day at the Norfolk Naval Base for some official word on precisely who perished and who survived the explosion on the destroyer  Cole.</p>
        <p>''There are some people very quiet, some people very upset, but everybody is just waiting,'' said Catherine M. Stokoe, director of the base's family service center, as the anxious vigil continued hours after what President Clinton said appeared to have been a terrorist attack.</p>
        <p>The Navy emphasized that it was taking time to carefully prepare the casualty tally to avoid the release of painful misinformation. Thus the family members waited together, not knowing who would ultimately be most stricken by the news of the explosion, in which at least six service members based here were killed.</p>
        <p>The base itself was tightly battened down to most visitors under what was described as a Threat Con Alpha state of heightened security. Navy officials said this extra level of caution was ordered for all coastal bases after the explosion on the Cole.</p>
        <p>''Oh Lord, this is going to bring on a lot of fear around here,'' said Catherine Thompson, a 31-year-old mother of four whose husband, Michael, is about to ship out for the Middle East as a cook aboard the aircraft carrier Harry S. Truman. ''Just his going away can scare you, depress you,'' said Mrs. Thompson, speaking on a street of suburban quietude lined with new off-post homes. ''But this terrible thing makes you think it's like going to war.''</p>
        <p>Across the street, Sylvester Robinson, a Navy man assigned to guard duty at the base brig in the final months of his 20-year career, warily tracked the tragedy at midday as he polished his car. ''They're still looking for 12 others,'' he said. ''This is upsetting. I mean, it could be someone I know here in the community. This story is not complete on that and on who is responsible. It can get people hysterical.''</p>
        <p>By all accounts, the large Navy community long rooted in this Hampton Roads hub instantly began rallying around family members of the crew as soon as the Cole was identified in morning news bulletins.</p>
        <p>''We're Navy, and it's hard for an outsider to see, but this community comes together at a moment like this,'' said Carlton Burch, a retired sailor. He and his friend John Van Ness, another Navy veteran, debated from experience the relative security risks of being in port or on the high seas in the course of Middle East duty.</p>
        <p>''I don't know, but in port, on liberty, there always seemed a chance to get up close,'' Mr. Burch said while the two waited as volunteers at the Christian Service Center on Hampton Boulevard, a drop-in spiritual shelter for visiting military personnel.</p>
        <p>''Yeah, but out at sea you had to be alert for aircraft and missiles over there,'' said Mr. Van Ness, who was reminded by the explosion on the Cole of one of his old Navy jobs, notifying the next of kin when a service member died.</p>
        <p>''Imagine what it's like over there,'' he said, peering across the boulevard toward the tightly secured base.</p>
        <p>The rotation of Navy crews to and from their world deployments is a seasonal spectacle here. Crew members bound ashore to families waiting on the piers while others bid goodbye in sadder tableaux. Word of the explosion on the Cole came as community leaders were preparing for the annual Fleet Week celebrations. They were to begin this weekend with the dedication here in Town Point Park of a seven-foot sculpture, ''The Homecoming.'' It depicts a young family exulting at being reunited after a long tour of sea duty, the sailor and his wife hugging tightly and their small son, in turn, embracing them both.</p>
        <p>The outward signs of Navy-town routine were largely unchanged as residents tracked the frightening news through the day. Shoppers packed the post's retail exchanges; golfers practiced shots on a driving range bordering the base. But at one point, dock visitors could see a destroyer flag quietly lowered to half-mast in honor of lost mates on the Cole. Outside the tightly secured base, a score of television news antenna trucks remained on the prowl, awaiting word on the casualties and their families.</p>
        <p>''We're seeing a lot of sad people around here,'' said Michelle Carr at the Triple A car insurance agency,  which serves Navy families. ''Wives are getting their husbands ready to go out on deployment next month and now they have to deal with this.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Thompson, one of those wives, firmly emphasized one saving grace, seen in the resilience of her friends who are Navy wives, the professional counselors always ready to help stricken base families, and the extensive e-mail network that allows families to communicate directly with relatives at sea. ''This community is Navy,'' she said. ''The Navy is always there for us.''</p>
