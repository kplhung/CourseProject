        <p>The George Soros hedge fund group plans to announce today that it is taking over the struggling Internet retailer Bluefly Inc., a person close to the situation said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The move is rare for hedge funds, which cater to wealthy and institutional investors. Hedge fund managers are generally low profile and not given to taking controlling stakes in companies. Mr. Soros, 70, first bought an interest in Bluefly in July 1999, leading a group of investors that included Peter Lynch, 56, the former manager of the Fidelity Magellan fund.</p>
        <p>Officials at both Bluefly and Soros Fund Management declined to comment on the deal.</p>
        <p>Mr. Soros and Mr. Lynch are arguably the best known money managers in the respective fields of hedge funds and mutual funds, but Bluefly has been a bracing disappointment for both of them.</p>
        <p>The company promotes itself as ''the outlet store in your home,'' a sleek blue Web site where online shoppers can order up pashmina scarves, Gucci shoes or Nautica bed sheets. But Bluefly has had a steady diet of losses and low cash reserves, and the market has grown unkind to such stories. The stock has fallen 73 percent this year, leaving the company with a minuscule market value of $13.5 million.</p>
        <p>Bluefly's share price has collapsed from near $16 in January and $10.13 in July 1999, when Mr. Soros and Mr. Lynch made their transaction. Shares closed at $2.75 yesterday, down 19 cents. That means a share of Bluefly stock is trading at an 86 percent discount to the $19.95 Calvin Klein fork the site was promoting this week.</p>
        <p>The takeover of the company by Mr. Soros appears to be peculiar at this time. The market in general and Internet stocks in particular continue to suffer broad losses, and the prospects for Internet retailers continue to dim. One reason might be that Mr. Soros has already spent heavily on Bluefly -- $21.2 million for preferred stock, short-term bonds and warrants to buy more shares. His firm has also made a commitment to provide $3 million more in financing this year.</p>
        <p>The investment was made through Soros Private Equity Partners, the $2.7 billion venture capital unit of the $10 billion Soros fund group.</p>
        <p>Soros Fund Management has representation on Bluefly's board and a 19 percent stake in the company, but warrants that it plans to exercise give it the right to buy a controlling stake.</p>
        <p>Though the Soros investment in Bluefly has been public knowledge for some time, Mr. Lynch's was disclosed earlier this week in a report by Edgar Online, an Internet company that tracks securities filings. Both Mr. Lynch and his philanthropic foundation, the Lynch Foundation, were listed as investors in an August filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. No amount was disclosed, and Mr. Lynch declined to comment.</p>
        <p>Perhaps individual investors can take some heart in the fact that two of the world's best-known money managers suffer along with them. Of course, neither man made his name picking new-economy stocks, and the  Soros firm was derailed by them. After the dot-com stock correction in April, losses stemming in part from positions in Internet stocks like Bluefly led Mr. Soros to reduce his hedge fund empire significantly and abandon many of the aggressive strategies that made him a billionaire. Mr. Lynch retired as manager of Fidelity Magellan in 1990 and now serves as a vice chairman of Fidelity Investments.</p>
