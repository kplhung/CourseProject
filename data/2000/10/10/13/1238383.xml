        <p>Edgar Marroquin has a dream. He wants to be a teacher, and nothing is going to stop him, not even the bitter month-old transit strike that has forced him and tens of thousands of other poor Angelenos to get to work, school and church by any means necessary.</p>
        <p>That often means hitching a ride with family or friends. Or walking. Or riding a battered bicycle. Or piling into an unregulated private car that operates illegally and paying the driver anywhere from $2 to $5 for a ride that would cost a buck and a half on the bus.</p>

        <p>Edgar Marroquin has a dream. He wants to be a teacher, and nothing is going to stop him, not even the bitter month-old transit strike that has forced him and tens of thousands of other poor Angelenos to get to work, school and church by any means necessary.</p>
        <p>That often means hitching a ride with family or friends. Or walking. Or riding a battered bicycle. Or piling into an unregulated private car that operates illegally and paying the driver anywhere from $2 to $5 for a ride that would cost a buck and a half on the bus.</p>
        <p>For Mr. Marroquin, a 20-year-old student at Santa Monica College, it means getting up every morning at 4:30 and returning every night at 7 or 8 and sometimes later, after his father, through with his own day's work, has driven him home from a friend's house.</p>
        <p>''I'm always tired,'' Mr. Marroquin said this morning on his long journey to school. ''Before, I used to get up at 5:30, and that wasn't too bad. I'd be tired, but I'd get home at 2:30 in the afternoon and maybe take a nap. Now I get home so late and I have to stay up and do homework, I only get a couple of hours' sleep. I can't stand much more of this.''</p>
        <p>As Mr. Marroquin tried to get to school on time today, and stay awake once he got there, the striking United Transportation Union, which represents some 4,300 bus drivers and train operators, rejected the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's  ''best and final offer,'' providing among other things a 9.3 percent wage increase over three years.</p>
        <p>The transit strike largely concerns the M.T.A.'s effort to deal with projected budget deficits of $438 million over the next 10 years, said a transit authority spokesman, Gary Mosk. Among other cuts, the agency wants to reduce overtime pay that can add as much as $20,000 to the $50,000 annual wage of the typical driver.</p>
        <p>As the transit walkout dragged on, there was some better news for strike-weary Angelenos this morning: more than 40,000 county employees who struck jails, libraries, beaches, health clinics, welfare centers and all manner of other offices on Wednesday were back on the job.</p>
        <p>That strike, in pursuit of a new contract for members of Local 660 of the Service Employees International Union, was suspended by labor leaders on Wednesday night, in part, a union spokesman said, ''because our members can ill afford to be off work'' but also because of a plea by Cardinal Roger Mahony, who said the walkout was affecting ''the poorest and most vulnerable'' people of Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>To most people in this city of cars and freeways, the idle buses and stranded passengers are barely noticeable. Only 450,000 people, 3 percent of Los Angeles County's population, use public transit.</p>
        <p>But for those who do normally use the bus to get to their jobs -- cleaning offices downtown, caring for elderly shut-ins of the Wilshire district, stocking grocery shelves in Venice --  the strike has been hard on their feet, their sleep and their pocketbooks.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mosk, the transit authority spokesman, said that more than 75 percent of bus riders reported being entirely dependent on public transit to get to work or school, that more than two-thirds did not have a driver's license and that almost 70 percent earned less than $15,000 a year.</p>
        <p>This morning Earl Johnson, a 49-year-old maintenance man, was waiting to get a ride with one of the small fleet of private cars or vans whose owners offer rides to the newly stranded. ''The strike is hurting my pocket bad,'' Mr. Johnson said. ''It costs me $10 a day to get to work and back. It should be costing three.''</p>
        <p>The private-car drivers -- ''bandit operators'' they are called by Martin Hernandez of the Bus Riders Union, a group of citizens concerned with public transit issues -- pull up to the curb, beep the horn and motion to those needing rides. The prospective customers approach.</p>
        <p>''Do you go to Wilshire?''</p>
        <p>''Yeah. Two dollars.''</p>
        <p>This morning at Pico and Rimpau, a tiny Toyota pulled up. Seven men and women piled in, like college fraternity pledges.</p>
        <p>''You never know who is going to pick you up,'' said one rider, Earl Williams, 38. ''If I was a woman, I'd worry about who these guys are.''</p>
        <p>Some of the bandit operators park down the block from spots where commuters gather, the better to avoid the police, who have been issuing tickets and chasing them off.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hernandez, of the Bus Riders Union, said he had heard reports that women had been assaulted by bandit operators. ''A lot of people have been driven to desperate measures to get around,'' he said. ''You have bandit operators giving rides to people, and the concerns about public safety are very real. But people have to get to work.''</p>
        <p>So today the Bus Riders Union started its own free shuttle service, providing rides to more than 200 people. ''A drop in the bucket, but it's a start,'' Mr. Hernandez said, adding that he hoped churches and other organizations would pitch in and ''rally around the passengers who are truly suffering.''</p>
