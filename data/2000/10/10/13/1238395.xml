        <p>The price of crude oil surged yesterday, as news of escalating violence on the West Bank and an apparent terrorist attack on a United States naval ship in Yemen stoked fears of a wider Middle East conflict that could disrupt the flow of oil from the region.</p>
        <p>Experts on Middle East oil producers cautioned against market panic, however, saying that Saudi Arabia and other members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries would face enormous diplomatic and economic repercussions if they chose to limit oil exports as a show of support for the Palestinians.</p>
        <p>But the bloodshed in the Middle East has startled a United States market already jittery because of lagging stocks of heating oil and crude oil. The benchmark contract, for November crude, closed at $36.06 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange yesterday, an increase of $2.81, or more than 8 percent, from Wednesday. Crude prices had jumped earlier in the day to $37 a barrel, somewhat shy of a 10-year high, after Israeli helicopters fired missiles at Palestinian sites in the West Bank and Gaza, in reprisal for the deaths of two Israeli soldiers by a Palestinian mob.</p>
        <p>''There's three to four dollars' worth of worry priced into the market right now,'' said John Kilduff, senior vice president for risk management at Fimat, the commodities trading unit of Societe Generale. ''The supply situation is so tight that any disturbance drives it up.''</p>
        <p>The price of crude oil appeared to be slipping to less than $30 a barrel just a week ago but edged up again after a cold snap in the Northeast a few days ago. At the same time, weekly statistics showed  heating oil inventories at half of last year's levels, a shortfall that has stirred concern that any disruption in the supply of crude oil could lead to price spikes or even shortages this winter.</p>
        <p>Concern over a supply disruption from the Middle East has been building all week, set off by a comment Monday from the Saudi crown prince, Abdullah, that Israel's prime minister, Ehud Barak, ''has to think before taking any step and nobody should think that the kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the whole Arab and Islamic nation would just watch with their hands tied.''</p>
        <p>About a third of United States imports, or about 2.53 million barrels a day, are from the Middle East. The country consumes about 19 million barrels of oil daily.</p>
        <p>Fears that the conflict in the Middle East  would overflow Israel's borders grew when word spread yesterday of an explosion on a United States Navy destroyer at a port in Yemen. The Defense Department also reported movements by elite military units outside Baghdad, and President Clinton put troops in the Persian Gulf on higher alert.</p>
        <p>Adding to the anxiety about crude oil supplies, three small companies that won a third of the 30 million barrels of oil from the country's Strategic Petroleum Reserve appeared to be having trouble arranging the financing needed to receive the oil. The White House tapped the petroleum reserve to try to ease supplies and prices of heating oil, a move that seemed to be having some impact until the violence began in the Middle East.</p>
        <p>One of the companies, Euell Energy of Aurora, Colo., failed to get a necessary letter of credit to receive the three million barrels of oil it won in a tender a week ago, thereby forfeiting the oil, which will be offered for auction again next Monday, the Energy Department said. Two other companies, Burhany Energy Enterprises of Tallahassee, Fla., and Lance Stroud Enterprises of New York, received extensions until midnight tonight to come up with the letters of credit.</p>
        <p>Despite all the news that has put oil traders on edge, industry analysts warn that matters in the Middle East would have to become far worse before the notion of a 1970's-type embargo should be taken seriously. Saudi Arabia's bellicose talk, they say, is mainly for domestic consumption. The kingdom, which is OPEC's de facto leader, sees the United States as its closest ally and certainly its largest client for crude oil.</p>
        <p>''It would be very bad for relations with the United States, what with the elections coming up and heating oil stocks so low,'' said Leonidas Drollas, chief economist for the Centre for Global Energy Studies in London. ''It's so dangerous a game.''</p>
        <p>But most analysts concede that while the OPEC countries do not really want to cut off exports because of the conflict in Israel, they might be pushed to drastic measures if the people in their own countries took to the streets over the issue. The hope is that over the weekend, diplomatic efforts will cool the tensions and the violence will subside somewhat. One New York trader said, ''The oil markets now are in the hands of the politicians.''</p>
