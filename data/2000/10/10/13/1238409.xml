        <p>The New York Times plans to stake a gossamer claim to the mid-Manhattan skyline with a faceted, shimmering, semitransparent headquarters by Renzo Piano, an Italian architect who has enjoyed the international spotlight since the construction of the Centre Pompidou in Paris 23 years ago.</p>
        <p>The skyscraper, planned on Eighth Avenue between 40th and 41st Streets, would be the seventh home of The Times since 1851 and its first -- in an era of electronic communication and transmission -- built without printing presses.</p>
        <p>Mr. Piano was chosen yesterday in a  competition, most unusual for a commercial real estate project, that involved some of the best-known names in architecture: Norman Foster, Cesar Pelli, Frank O. Gehry and David M. Childs of Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill. Although cultural institutions reach outside the New York architectural establishment in search of innovative design, office developers rarely take a chance on outsiders, no matter how renowned.</p>
        <p>This would be the first New York building for Mr. Piano, whose blend of lyrical structural expression and formal geometry has defined the modern face of Paris, Berlin and Houston. He would be associated with Fox &amp; Fowle of Manhattan, architects of the Conde Nast and Reuters Buildings in Times Square.</p>
        <p>Although a final design is a year away, Michael Golden, the vice chairman and senior vice president of The New York Times Company, said yesterday that Mr. Piano had been chosen in part on the strength of the distinctive facade he has proposed; in essence, a skin of clear glass enveloped in screens that seem almost to float in the air around the tower.</p>
        <p>''This building is about defying gravity,'' Mr. Piano said yesterday in a telephone interview from his Paris office. ''This is the idea. In some ways, it is like information. Information is immaterial.</p>
        <p>''It's always very dangerous to look for symbolism,'' he said. ''But in some way, I love the idea that the spirit of a newspaper like The New York Times is expressed semantically.''</p>
        <p>Even with the choice of the Renzo Piano Building Workshop and Fox &amp; Fowle, much about the Times's building project remains to be decided. Mr. Golden said he expected a decision on whether to proceed from the board of directors by the end of the year.</p>
        <p>By then, he said, negotiations with state and city officials should be completed to permit The Times and Forest City Ratner to lease a 200-by-400-foot development parcel across Eighth Avenue from the Port Authority Bus Terminal. The site is now in the hands of 11 property owners, but New York State would condemn it under its powers of eminent domain.</p>
        <p>In broad outline, the new building would be 600 to 700 feet tall, or around 45 stories, with 1.37 million square feet of space. The tower would rise from a broad base that might include a public atrium (Mr. Piano envisions a sculpture by Robert Rauschenberg there), a theater, a New York Times museum and stores.</p>
        <p>The Times would occupy the larger, lower floors, taking up a little more than half of the building. Forest City Ratner would rent the upper floors to other tenants. Mr. Golden would not estimate the development budget.</p>
        <p>Just designing the building will take a year, Mr. Golden said, and the results may be very different from Mr. Piano's competition entry, almost surely not as open and public at the base. ''We have said from the beginning that we were looking for an architect, not a design,'' Mr. Golden said.</p>
        <p>To reduce the transmission of heat, ordinarily a problem that plagues glass-walled skyscrapers,  Mr. Piano has proposed a screen of thin horizontal ceramic bars a foot or two in front of the clear glass. The bars would shade roughly half the facade but not extend across the windows, so views would not be obscured. The white ceramic, Mr. Piano said, would ''take the color of the moment'': blue in the early morning, cool tones during storms, warm as the sun sets.</p>
        <p>''For me,'' Mr. Piano said, ''the romance comes from the capacity of the building to sing in some way, to vibrate and to be a mirror of the weather.''</p>
        <p>He envisions the base of the building as a ''generous continuation of the street,'' a meeting place and a piazza. ''My real hope,'' Mr. Piano added, ''is that the building will be loved.''</p>
        <p>He invited Fox &amp; Fowle to join him last month, in part because of their long experience in New York and specifically around Times Square. ''They know the place,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Bruce S. Fowle praised Mr. Piano's overall vision for the new Times building as ''straightforward, elegant and timeless in the sense that it's not a style, it's not something you could possibly say was just a trend.''</p>
        <p>The only other partnership of architects in the competition, Mr. Gehry and Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill, withdrew last week before the final judging. ''I would just say our process was incompatible,'' Mr. Gehry said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Golden said he regretted the withdrawal but would not characterize it further. ''I think we had four great choices,'' he said of the competitors.</p>
        <p>The Times now occupies a building at 229 West 43rd Street that opened in 1913 and was expanded three times, most recently in 1947. Clad in white brick and terra cotta, it has ornate details borrowed from the Chateau de Chambord and an 18th-floor copper cupola that barely nicks the skyline.</p>
        <p>Times Tower, a slender trapezoidal structure at Broadway and 42nd Street, housed the newspaper from 1905 to 1913. It was given a new facade in the 1960's that is now lost under vinyl advertising banners and electronic displays.</p>
        <p>From 1889 to 1904, the Times occupied a ruggedly Romanesque style building at 41 Park Row, overlooking City Hall Park, that has been owned since 1951 by Pace University and was designated a landmark last year. Its previous building stood on the same site, while the one before that -- The Times's second building  -- was a block away.</p>
        <p>The Times's first home, 113 Nassau Street, between Beekman and Ann Streets, still stands, though in a state of some decrepitude. Its last ground-floor tenant was a McDonald's.</p>
