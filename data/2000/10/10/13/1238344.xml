        <p>To see New York City from the water is to see it anew, spread out serenely along the horizon in the shifting light, distorted by distance, blurred by haze, magically rearranging itself as you move in the muffled quiet toward someplace, anyplace or, better yet, no place at all.</p>
        <p>Contemplating New York in that way is a little like dreaming. The observer has the illusion of stillness while moving forward; the city seems to move while staying in place. The million insistent details that clamor for your attention on the sidewalks recede, fading into something more abstract.</p>

        <p>To see New York City from the water is to see it anew, spread out serenely along the horizon in the shifting light, distorted by distance, blurred by haze, magically rearranging itself as you move in the muffled quiet toward someplace, anyplace or, better yet, no place at all.</p>
        <p>Contemplating New York in that way is a little like dreaming. The observer has the illusion of stillness while moving forward; the city seems to move while staying in place. The million insistent details that clamor for your attention on the sidewalks recede, fading into something more abstract.</p>
        <p>Of course it is possible to live in New York -- a city of islands, conceived as a port -- and rarely experience New York from the water. Living in canyons, traveling underground, people go for long stretches barely focusing on the rivers, bays and harbor. We are rarely out there, gazing back.</p>
        <p>What we miss is a facet of the city that has inspired a host of painters, that resonates deeply in a nation of immigrants and their descendants. For many, the skyline from the harbor has become the iconic image of New York. Yet there are innumerable other ways to see it from the water.</p>
        <p>For several weeks, I made a point of traveling in and around the city by water -- something neither as easy as it once was nor as difficult as it was just a few years back. I saw the city from myriad angles, at dusk and near dawn, in sun, rain and haze, but always at a remove.</p>
        <p>I rode ferries across the Hudson, up the East River, out into Bowery Bay in Queens; sailed across New York Harbor on a replica of a 19th-century schooner; rode the Staten Island Ferry in a downpour, watching Lower Manhattan dwindle, disappear, then reemerge on the return trip, draped in fog. It is hard to imagine a more exquisite and accessible urban pleasure than skimming noiselessly along the water, sunlight glinting on the Chrysler Building's chrome-nickel steel crown, the air tinged with the sour smells of seawater or creosote, trucks clattering overhead as you pass under the Williamsburg Bridge.</p>
        <p>From the water, the city is almost always captivating: the luminous green breast of Carl Schurz Park dipping down to the East River below Gracie Mansion; Battery Park City climbing toward the World Trade Center towers; the Staten Island Ferry terminal pilings groaning against the weight of the boats; the water below the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge butter-colored in late afternoon light.</p>
        <p>What's more, catching the city's numerous ferries is disarmingly simple. Who would imagine you could stand at the edge of Manhattan and a craft would swing by and pick you up? No long lines, no elaborate plans. The ferries are mostly bow-loading, for efficiency: they slide into a slip, unload and load, back out and head off. No time-consuming parallel parking.</p>
        <p>The rides I took were smooth, no Dramamine needed. The ferries varied in size, their capacity ranging from 100 passengers, to 6,000 on the Staten Island Ferry. The small ones move lightly. The Staten Island Ferry feels indestructible and unwieldy; its central seating area has the feel of a jury assembly room in some big-city courthouse, but afloat.</p>
        <p>My fellow passengers varied depending on the route: a boatload of baseball fans fondling Budweisers, a couple of business people en route to La Guardia, a ferryful of working stiffs heading home to Staten Island after a long day. What they seemed to share was a certain mellowness. Maybe it was because they were a self-selecting group; maybe it was the rolling of the boat.</p>
        <p>I did make one mistake. I deviated from the purely practical and paid $35 to try a lunch cruise down the Hudson. I had already bought the nonrefundable ticket when I caught sight of the bingo cards on the butter plates. On board, in the dimly lighted dining room, a uniformed crew member began bellowing ''Come Sail Away.'' The average age of the passengers appeared to be 78.</p>
        <p>This seemed to be the plan: We would sit inside for most of two hours eating chicken teriyaki and potato salad and drinking margaritas that were Windex blue. I balked and fled to the upper deck. But the theme from ''Hawaii 5-0'' was blasting out of the public address system. The city was dazzling from up there. But the ship felt outsize and noisy. Dreaming, out of the question.</p>
        <p>On the East River</p>
        <p>In some ways, the most delightful excursions were the most mundane. Early one morning I caught the Delta Water Shuttle off a barge in the East River at 62nd Street, steamed north past Roosevelt Island, then veered east through Hell Gate, passed under the Triborough Bridge, skirted Rikers Island and docked behind the Marine Air Terminal at La Guardia Airport in Bowery Bay.</p>
        <p>It had seemed inconceivable, standing there alone at the southern end of the East River Walk, that a ferry would actually show up. The river looked empty that morning and the gate to the dock was locked. Then the boat materialized in the distance, steaming toward me. Suddenly she was there, the Amelia Earhart. A man in uniform hopped off, said hi and unlocked the gate. I went aboard.</p>
        <p>There were just two other passengers that morning, noses buried in work. I stood on the sliver of deck at the stern, watching the skyline flatten and the waterway widen as we rounded the northwestern flank of Queens, past sewage treatment and power plants, tank farms and cormorant-crowded markers. A single gull followed us up the East River. Ducks flapped low over the glistening bay.</p>
        <p>To the south and west, the Manhattan skyline came back into view, transected by the Triborough Bridge. Sailboats motored past in the windless morning, heading for the harbor and beyond. At La Guardia, jets were lumbering into position and arcing skyward against the glare. We disembarked up a rambling gangway and into the terminal. Reality abruptly resumed.</p>
        <p>Another afternoon, my husband, children and I sailed down the Hudson from Pier 62 at Chelsea Piers on the Adirondack, an 80-foot replica of the kind of schooner that once used to carry harbor pilots out to meet arriving ships. With two dozen other passengers we beat our way down the river against a southerly wind, zigzagging back and forth between Manhattan and New Jersey.</p>
        <p>Thick, white clouds towered over the Chelsea skyline as Midtown faded to a blur. Kayakers wended their way, like water birds, between rotting piers. We turned west and the aquamarine face of the old Erie-Lackawanna Terminal in Hoboken fell into focus. Turning again, we headed southeast past TriBeCa and toward Battery Park City.</p>
        <p>Our skipper appeared to be the real thing, a wiry man with a leathery brown face and salt-stained deck shoes. He kept up an easy banter with each of the passengers: ''You like Puccini?'' he asked a woman who said she was an opera singer. She beamed. ''I'm a Puccini specialist,'' she said. A crew member emerged from the galley to take orders: ''Ladies, something to drink?''</p>
        <p>This time we were riding just inches above the water. There was no engine humming, just the occasional flapping of the dacron sails. The city loomed above us with startling suddenness. There was the World Trade Center, just beyond the boat's jib. Then we turned again, beside the long greenness of Nelson A. Rockefeller Park, and headed out into the harbor toward Ellis Island, which was silhouetted against a now-blinding yellow-white sky.</p>
        <p>Humming With Traffic</p>
        <p>The harbor that day, a late-summer Sunday, seemed to hum with traffic. Cruise ships big enough to dwarf Governors Island came and went. There were tankers, barges, tugboats, cabin cruisers, sightseeing boats, ferries, private sailboats, Jet Skis. The Coast Guard estimates that, on average, 700 vessels more than 100 feet long move through the harbor each day.</p>
        <p>In addition, NY Waterway now operates 22 ferries on nine routes linking New Jersey and Manhattan, and Manhattan and Queens. Other ferries cross the harbor carrying commuters to Lower Manhattan from Monmouth County, N.J. There are plans for more ferries and more routes and talk of starting ferry service from the Upper East Side down the East River to Wall Street.</p>
        <p>On another day, I paid $14 to ride a NY Waterway ferry from the South Street Seaport to Yankee Stadium. It was late morning when we set off, carrying a cargo of middle-aged men in Yankees gear. Brooklyn Heights was just breaking through the haze as we headed north, past the vast apartment houses of the Lower East Side to the left and the Greenpoint piers on the right.</p>
        <p>The World Trade Center seemed for a while to stride along with us as we moved, the way transmission towers do on a highway. The city lay there as though on a table for examination: vest pocket park, power station, apartment tower, church, one on top of the other. Buildings slid past, exposing new ones; then other buildings slid into place, obscuring what had come before.</p>
        <p>Roosevelt Island from the water looked like an illustration from a children's book on, say, transportation: The tram coming and going overhead, tugboats passing on the river, trucks creeping across the Queensborough Bridge, the little red Roosevelt Island buses circling, cars surging along the F.D.R. Drive past the heliport next to the Delta Water Shuttle dock.</p>
        <p>Farther up near the Triborough, men sat slumped in lawn chairs beside the river, fishing. The sightseeing from the ferry markedly changed: an old concrete factory, a recycling plant, parking lots ringed with razor ribbon. Bridges came quickly now: Willis Avenue, Third Avenue, 145th Street. Then Yankee Stadium slid into view. We docked and filed down the gangway, through a parking lot, over a footbridge. Forty minutes after departing, we were there.</p>
        <p>An equally agreeable journey, but briefer, took me from the NY Waterway terminal at West 38th Street to Port Imperial in Weehawken, part of the stretch of Hudson River waterfront in New Jersey that Arthur E. Imperatore, a trucking company owner, was intending to develop when he began operating what was to become NY Waterway's first ferry line in 1986.</p>
        <p>From the ferry, the view extends from the George Washington Bridge to the Statue of Liberty and beyond, taking in the long leafy flank of Riverside Park stretching north, the glistening towers of Midtown, the southern end of the Palisades in New Jersey with traffic winding along the cliff top, and the rapidly transforming Hudson waterfront in New Jersey.</p>
        <p>The ultimate New York ride is still, of course, the Staten Island Ferry. From the deck after a rainstorm early one evening, Lower Manhattan could be seen emerging from the mist like a series of shadows. A thick roll of blue-gray cloud hung over it. As the ferry headed north from St. George, Manhattan seemed to transform itself minute by minute.</p>
        <p>For a while, the skyline looked hardly more imposing than the blurry outlines of Jersey City off to the left and Brooklyn to the right. But then those two seemed to dwindle as Manhattan swelled to dominate the view. Glass and steel crowned in a milky mist towered above us. The ferry eased into its slip, the gangways slid into place. I stumbled off, waking again from the dream.</p>
