        <p>The White House said today that President Clinton may travel to North Korea later this year, in what would be the first visit by an American president to the Communist country.</p>
        <p>The presidential trip, still tentative, would follow a visit by Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, who plans to visit Pyongyang by the end of the month, officials said.</p>
        <p>The announcement came as Gen. Jo Myong Rok, first vice chairman of North Korea's National Defense Commission, wound up talks in Washington with Mr. Clinton and his top national security aides. Developments were few but the very fact of the meeting signaled the changing relations between the United States and North Korea.</p>
        <p>During Mr. Clinton's first term, he ordered military reinforcements to South Korea after North Korean leaders refused to allow international inspectors access to its main nuclear weapons complex. The North eventually agreed to freeze its nuclear program.</p>
        <p>At a news briefing today, Dr. Albright described differences between North Korea and the United States as ''extensive and of long standing'' and noted that ''they will not be erased overnight.'' But she said recent talks had led to ''a very substantial step away from the frozen and distant relations of the past.''</p>
        <p>In recent months, the Clinton administration has lifted a broad set of economic sanctions against North Korea that had been in place since it invaded the South 50 years ago, setting off the Korean War.</p>
        <p>In a joint statement released today upon General Jo's departure, the two countries signaled their desire for a new direction. ''As a first step,'' it said, ''the two sides stated that neither government would have hostile intent toward the other.''</p>
        <p>The North Koreans pledged in the statement not to launch long-range missiles of any kind while talks continued on American demands for a permanent freeze on missile tests.</p>
        <p>In Seoul, South Korean President Kim Dae Jung said through a spokesman that he ''fully supports and welcomes'' the United States-North Korea talks. ''This is another step forward toward peace on the Korean peninsula and in the world,'' the spokesman, Park Joon Young, told The Associated Press.</p>
