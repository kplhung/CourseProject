        <p>Remember the Titans  Denzel Washington, Will Patton, Wood Harris, Ryan Hurst, Donald Faison  Directed by Boaz Yakin  PG 113 minutes</p>
        <p>The new black coach is nose to nose with a defiant white linebacker. ''Who is your daddy?'' asks Homer Boone (Mr. Washington). It may be the first day of racially integrated high school football in Alexandria, Va., but Gary Bertier (Mr. Hurst) already knows who his daddy is: Coach Boone is his daddy.

        <p>Remember the Titans  Denzel Washington, Will Patton, Wood Harris, Ryan Hurst, Donald Faison  Directed by Boaz Yakin  PG 113 minutes</p>
        <p>The new black coach is nose to nose with a defiant white linebacker. ''Who is your daddy?'' asks Homer Boone (Mr. Washington). It may be the first day of racially integrated high school football in Alexandria, Va., but Gary Bertier (Mr. Hurst) already knows who his daddy is: Coach Boone is his daddy. Now straighten that tie, son, and get on the bus -- not the bus with all the white players either but the bus that reflects the Titans' new black-and-white makeup.</p>
        <p>Still another football movie rolls out the usual heroics, but this one grabs on to a real-life situation. In 1971 Alexandria had a hard time mixing the races on its championship football team. On top of that, the team's revered coach, Bill Yoast (Mr. Patton), a shoo-in for the very white coaches hall of fame, had been replaced with a black man, and an assertive one at that.</p>
        <p>With bus seating settled, the team rolls off for a rugged training camp at Gettysburg College. After some hostility on the field and in the dormitory, the boys begin to get the idea that they're in this together.</p>
        <p>As relentless as the soundtrack, which never eases up on soaring uplift from first frame to last, Boone even takes the team for a little middle-of-the night run to the Gettysburg battlefield. There in a graveyard by dawn's early light, the coach tells the boys about ancestors lost to war and race hatred and announces that he and the team are about to put that kind of thing behind them.</p>
        <p>Like soldiers in combat, the players become devoted to one another, helped immeasurably by Yoast, who is demoted to an assistant coach but decides to get into the spirit of the project. From then on, it's a matter of winning a lot of close games against teams that are still totally white along with their nasty racist coaches. It would probably do the Titans good to lose a contest or two, but go ahead and bet the farm.</p>
        <p>VIOLENCE -- On the field the contact is exaggerated and the sound effects are amplified to the point where high school boys seem as if they're playing in the National Football League.  SEX -- None.  PROFANITY -- Locker-room talk.</p>
        <p>For Which Children?</p>
        <p>UNDER AGE 8 -- Too violent and too much movie all around for very young children.  AGES 8-11 -- For all its loud and obvious insistence, the movie has a gritty likability and does a reasonably good job with racial interaction. Parents might have reservations, but this is a family film.  AGES 12 AND UP -- Many teenagers will relate; others will avoid.</p>
        <p>Best in Show  Christopher Guest, Parker Posey, Michael Hitchcock, Eugene Levy, Catherine O'Hara, Jim Piddock, Fred Willard  Directed by Mr. Guest  PG-13 89 minutes</p>
        <p>''God loves the terrier!'' exclaims Gerry Fleck (Mr. Levy), a haberdashery salesman with two left feet (literally) from Fern City, Fla. Gerry is off to the Mayflower Kennel Club Dog Show in Philadelphia with his wife, Cookie (Ms. O'Hara), and a pooch named Winky.</p>
        <p>But God also loves the bloodhound Hubert, escorted to the show by Harlan Pepper (Mr. Guest) of Pine Nut, N.C.; the standard poodle Rhapsody in White; the Shi Tzu Miss Agnes. And God, not to mention the judges, had better love the Weimaraner Beatrice, the fixation of Hamilton and Meg Swan (Mr. Hitchcock and Ms. Posey), two riotously officious lawyers and J. Crew catalog readers from Illinois.</p>
        <p>All are housed at the Taft Hotel, which during show week maintains a ''hygiene room'' full of high-powered carpet cleaners. Before performing in the jam-packed auditorium, dogs and handlers battle nerves and putdowns behind tall blue curtains. Beatrice loses her squeaky bumblebee plaything, severely rattling the Swans. Cookie Fleck, a virtuoso handler on the show floor, injures her knee, leaving Winky's fortunes in the hands of the left-footed Gerry.</p>
        <p>Out front, Beatrice attacks a judge. Otherwise the film's little ensemble wins its share of ribbons. On the sidelines two television announcers, the erudite Trevor (Mr. Piddock) and the loutish Buck (Mr. Willard), recount the action for the folks at home. Buck notes that in some cultures dogs are eaten.</p>
        <p>VIOLENCE -- None.  SEX -- The Swans discuss Beatrices's reaction to their sexual activities, and there are references to Cookie's premarital habits.  PROFANITY -- Strongly off-color.</p>
        <p>For Which Children?  UNDER AGE 8 -- They would love the dogs, but the rest is often inappropriate and incomprehensible.  AGES 8-10 -- A parental decision, but children will enjoy themselves.  AGES 11 AND UP -- All told, there is nothing too objectionable.</p>
        <p>Beautiful  Minnie Driver, Joey Lauren Adams, Hallie Kate Eisenberg  Directed by Sally Field  PG-13 112 minutes</p>
        <p>During a desperate childhood, little Mona Hibbard fends off her lecherous stepfather and dreams of one thing: victory in beauty pageants. About this time she meets Ruby, a playmate of interest to the ruthlessly determined Mona primarily because she can sew and make costumes. Together the pair devote themselves to Mona's obsession.</p>
        <p>Cut to years later, though, and it's still the same story in every pageant's winner circle. ''Always Miss Texas,'' Mona snarls. Later she has a child, which would disqualify her from competition. So the saintly Ruby (Ms. Adams) poses as the little girl's mother while Mona (Ms. Driver) becomes Miss Illinois and a candidate for Miss American Miss.</p>
        <p>Ms. Driver as Miss American Miss? Anyway, on with the pageant and all the phoniness and back-stabbing found in all beauty pageant movies. But then Mona begins to experience doubts. After Ruby unjustly lands in jail, Mona is forced to take her daughter, Vanessa (Hallie Kate Eisenberg), to the pageant. When competitors notice the resemblance, a decision must be made.</p>
        <p>VIOLENCE -- None.  SEX -- Some joking and innuendo.  PROFANITY -- A fair amount but in keeping with the situation.</p>
        <p>For Which Children?</p>
        <p>AGES 3-7 -- The film would confuse, and parts of it, especially involving Mona's treatment of the little girl, could be upsetting.  AGES 8-11 -- Like ''Anywhere but Here'' with Natalie Portman and ''Tumbleweeds'' with Janet McTeer, this film features a child who is obliged to take charge of an immature parent. That alone could prove interesting for young viewers, who will also take to the pageant atmosphere.  AGES 12 AND UP -- It's hard to see the appeal for most teenagers.</p>
