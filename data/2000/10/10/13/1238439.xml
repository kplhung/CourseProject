At least 6 sailors died, 11 others were missing and presumed dead and dozens were wounded.</p>

        <p>Mideast Violence Intensifies  Israeli helicopter gunships rocketed Ramallah and Gaza City after a Palestinian mob stabbed and stomped to death two Israeli reserve soldiers and then paraded a mutilated body in the street. Blaming the killings squarely on the Palestinian Authority, Israelis described the response as ''limited'' and ''symbolic.''</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>President Clinton failed to get Israeli and Palestinian leaders to commit themselves publicly to ending the violence. President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt offered to convene a meeting that would include Mr. Clinton, Israel, the Palestinians and Jordan.</p>

        <p>Bush Camp Hails Debate; Gore Hits at Texas Record  The candidates campaigned in swing states. Vice President Al Gore pressed his attack on George W. Bush's record as governor of Texas, and the Bush campaign exulted in what it saw as a pivotal moment in the race -- Wednesday's debate.</p>

        <p>Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, visiting Odessa, Tex., to drive home the Democrats' charge that Mr. Bush would pose an environmental threat as president, listened to residents tell of foul-smelling air and water and fear that their health problems are tied to nearby industrial plants.</p>
        <p>A25</p>
        <p>Some House Democrats were disappointed with Mr. Gore's debate performance and expressed concern about his ability to help Democrats regain control of the House.</p>

        <p>Penalties for Disclosure  Congress voted to expand government authority to bring criminal charges against people who disclose classified data.
