        <p>Giants Coach Jim Fassel approached his offensive coordinator, Sean Payton, who was on the sideline in the second half holding the industrial-sized cue sheet of offensive plays that resembled a Christmas card with all the colors on it. Fassel wasn't angry, but was animated, communicating with Payton, his hands moving excitedly in a blur.</p>
        <p>Something about the previous series, in which the offense was quickly on and off the field, a common occurrence in recent weeks, irritated Fassel. He should have been annoyed, because this was not one of the Giants' better offensive performances. Those neat little plays on Payton's cue card might as well have been in pig Latin because few were working.</p>

        <p>Giants Coach Jim Fassel approached his offensive coordinator, Sean Payton, who was on the sideline in the second half holding the industrial-sized cue sheet of offensive plays that resembled a Christmas card with all the colors on it. Fassel wasn't angry, but was animated, communicating with Payton, his hands moving excitedly in a blur.</p>
        <p>Something about the previous series, in which the offense was quickly on and off the field, a common occurrence in recent weeks, irritated Fassel. He should have been annoyed, because this was not one of the Giants' better offensive performances. Those neat little plays on Payton's cue card might as well have been in pig Latin because few were working.</p>
        <p>That the offense was struggling against Dallas was puzzling, because last week the coaching staff and the players worked overtime to fix the problems.</p>
        <p>The hard look actually began last week after the Atlanta game, another offensive debacle, when offensive lineman Glenn Parker spoke to the team, saying the offense, from that moment on, was going to pull its share of the load. The self-analysis continued in this game when Fassel benched Amani Toomer for running errant pass routes.</p>
        <p>The Giants are a strange mix, a blend of great athletes and smart coaches, but on offense especially they are at times muddled, confused and inept. The team wins games, as it did yesterday against Dallas, 19-14, but there is always a feeling that the floor will drop out from under the offense. That a team, any team, can rip off the mask and expose the 5-2 Giants for what they are: a playoff team with bundles of pride, but possessing an offense that can be shut down with little effort.</p>
        <p>Don't blame the ugliness of this victory on the defense. The defense won the game by sacking Troy Aikman in the final seconds and then knocking down his last pass in the end zone with no time on the clock. Defensive end Michael Strahan was the best player on the field. The Giants lost Jason Sehorn, their top cover corner, on the first play when he broke a rib, and yet they still shut down the Cowboys' passing game.</p>
        <p>No question the offense is the problem. It needs emergency surgery because the Giants should have beaten Dallas by three touchdowns.</p>
        <p>Players and coaches say this sort of talk is another example of the news media playing the negative card. We won, the players and coaches say. We're at the top of the division. Why dwell on the bad things? On the surface that is all true. The Giants, with games next against Philadelphia and Cleveland, will probably be 7-2 when they play St. Louis on Nov. 12. That's pretty good. The Bengals would give up their stock options to win a game.</p>
        <p>''We won,'' Strahan said, ''that's all that matters. Don't make an issue out of something that's not.''</p>
        <p>But there is no question that in their hearts, when the coaches break down the game film and the players are eating their morning cereal and watching cable, many of them will be thinking the same thing, because coaches and players do not lie to themselves. They will be thinking: our offense stinks.</p>
        <p>We are winning. We're on top.</p>
        <p>But our offense stinks.</p>
        <p>Running back Tiki Barber put it this way: ''We have a bye week, so we can rest up and think about how to get better on offense. Think of it this way. As bad as we've played on offense, we're still on top of the division.''</p>
        <p>Maybe everyone should get used to the way the Giants are winning. They will get 10 or even 11 victories. Many will be close games, ugly games, low-wattage games, where the score is 3-0 at the half and Ron Dayne has five carries for 7 yards. Games where Fassel will yank out half of his hair in frustration.</p>
        <p>The Giants have a bye next weekend, and Fassel, a realist, will again spend most of his nights staring at game film in search of ways to improve the team's offense.</p>
        <p>This is not a situation where talent is absent. Quarterback Kerry Collins is solid, Barber is one of the best offensive players in the league, and the team has talent and speed at wide receiver, not to mention a veteran offensive line that is playing well. So it is up to the coaching staff to decipher this riddle. This has fallen in Fassel's lap with a loud thud.</p>
        <p>How Fassel and his staff handle this will be the difference between the Giants simply making the playoffs and doing something special once they get there.</p>
