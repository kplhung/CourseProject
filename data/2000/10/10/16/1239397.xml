        <p>After a race marred by charges of vote-buying and unethical control of the news media, the long-governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as PRI, faced the possibility of another stunning upset in elections today in the southern state of Tabasco.</p>
        <p>Newspaper opinion polls in the weeks leading up to the vote suggested that the PRI's candidate for governor, Manuel Andrade, would win comfortably in a field of 11 candidates.

        <p>After a race marred by charges of vote-buying and unethical control of the news media, the long-governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as PRI, faced the possibility of another stunning upset in elections today in the southern state of Tabasco.</p>
        <p>Newspaper opinion polls in the weeks leading up to the vote suggested that the PRI's candidate for governor, Manuel Andrade, would win comfortably in a field of 11 candidates. But surveys of voters leaving polling stations indicated that the gap between Mr. Andrade and his most important rival, Raul Ojeda of the Democratic Revolutionary Party, was much less conclusive. And early returns showed Mr. Ojeda with a slight lead.</p>
        <p>At 9:30 p.m. results from the state electoral institute indicated that, with some 150,000 votes counted, Mr. Ojeda was leading with 44 percent of the vote, while Mr. Adrade had nearly 43 percent.</p>
        <p>In television interviews, Mr. Andrade tried to keep up a positive front, but he said that his party would peacefully accept a defeat if the results did not go his way. Mr. Ojeda, however, beamed triumphantly and claimed an early victory.</p>
        <p>''The people of Tabasco have shown that they no longer have their hands tied by the PRI,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The race for governor was widely viewed as a critical test of survival for the PRI. The party has been rancorously divided since July, when it lost the presidency for the first time in 71 years. And a month later, the party suffered another bruising defeat when it lost the gubernatorial elections in Chiapas, a state that had previously been a solid bastion of support.</p>
        <p>About 1.1 million voters were eligible to cast ballots in the contest for governor, for 17 mayoralties and for 30 state congressional delegates' seats. And although Tabasco, an agricultural state, has been ravaged in recent weeks by torrential rains and flooding, the turnout was expected to reach 70 percent.</p>
        <p>In the weeks before the Tabasco vote, state and national opposition leaders charged that in the former governing party's desperation to win the elections, its leaders were committing numerous unethical campaign practices.</p>
        <p>Leaders of Alianza Civica, a citizen group that monitors elections across the country, charged that local media gave more favorable coverage to the party's candidates. And on election day, leaders of the citizen group accused the party and state government officials of distributing handouts to voters before they went to the polls.</p>
        <p>Although Gov. Roberto Madrazo Pintado was prohibited by law from running for a second term, the Tabasco elections were expected to determine his political future since he hoped that a victory would propel him to become the next president of the party. The governor portrays himself as a reformer who wants to help the party take part in the democratic movement sweeping the country by giving party members more control over the selection of its leaders. And he is popular among the groups at the party's base, including workers' unions and farmers.</p>
        <p>However, among the technocrats in his party - whose camps include the outgoing president, Ernesto Zedillo -- and among members of opposition groups, Mr. Madrazo is viewed as an old-style political boss who represents the corruption that has forced the party out of political favor. In their campaigns for governor, most of the opposition candidates focused their attacks on Mr. Madrazo.</p>
