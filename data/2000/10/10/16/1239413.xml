        <p>It is one of the great mysteries around the Mets, and the person in the middle of it never drops a clue. Does Mike Hampton want to re-sign with the Mets, or is he a mercenary about to leave town?</p>
        <p>Hampton starts Game 5 of the National League Championship Series tonight, and his effort will go a long way toward deciding if the Mets advance to the World Series. One of the many reasons his teammates want to keep winning is because they believe it could be harder for Hampton to leave a championship club.</p>
        <p>''The guys tend to think that the farther we go, the better the chances are he might stay,'' said first baseman Todd Zeile. ''But I think only he knows that. That's probably why he's given no indication.''</p>
        <p>A reporter asked Hampton about his future during a news conference yesterday, and Hampton quickly dismissed the topic. ''I've avoided that question for six and a half months,'' said Hampton, who threw seven shutout innings in his Game 1 victory against the Cardinals. ''I'm thinking another two weeks won't be hard avoiding.''</p>
        <p>But speculation has swirled despite his silence. On the last weekend of the regular season, Hampton laughed about it. He has never let his guard down about his intentions, and he seemed proud of it.</p>
        <p>''Nobody knows anything,'' Hampton said. ''I haven't thought one bit about where I'm going to play next year, because I've still got unfinished business here. When we're done here, that's when it becomes a thought.''</p>
        <p>Hampton's agent, Mark Rodgers, said he has assured Mets General Manager Steve Phillips that Hampton has not made up his mind. Respecting Hampton's wishes, the Mets have not negotiated during the season after preliminary talks in February went nowhere.</p>
        <p>The Mets plan to talk with Hampton after the season, before other clubs can negotiate with him as a free agent. Rodgers said Hampton will listen, though it may take an overwhelming offer to get Hampton to pass up free agency.</p>
        <p>This much is known: the outcome of the postseason will have an impact on Hampton's decision.</p>
        <p>''If this book has 20 chapters, I feel like we're in the middle of chapter 15 or 16,'' Rodgers said. ''To ask Mike how the book was now would be unfair. Part of the New York experience is still in front of Mike. The only people who truly know how Mike feels about the whole thing are Mike, his wife and me.''</p>
        <p>Hampton struggled early in the season, partly because of the expectations he put on himself when the Mets brought him in as their ace. But he was outstanding after early May, and although the weather and the media seemed to bother him at times, Hampton generally seemed to become more comfortable as the season went on.</p>
        <p>The Mets want him back, with the free-agent right-hander Mike Mussina another top-of-the-rotation option. But even if Hampton leaves, Phillips has said he will have no regrets about the deal that sent three young players -- Roger Cedeno, Octavio Dotel and Kyle Kessel -- to Houston for Hampton and Derek Bell last December.</p>
        <p>That trade was regarded as a coup in the industry, and other executives admired Phillips's daring.</p>
        <p>''I had a meeting last October with a lot of my staff,'' said Cardinals General Manager Walt Jocketty. ''Bing Devine, our former general manager, gave me a piece of advice: 'If you have a chance to win now, go for it.'</p>
        <p>''The Mets were in a situation where they thought they might be one starting pitcher away, and they went out and got a starting pitcher. They gave up some talent, but that helped put the team in position to go to the World Series. That's what we're here for.''</p>
        <p>Jocketty was in the market for starters last winter -- he acquired Andy Benes, Pat Hentgen and Darryl Kile -- and tried to work a three-way deal for Hampton. But the Astros did not want to trade Hampton within the N.L. Central, and when the Mets landed the left-hander, Jocketty said, ''They upstaged a lot of people.''</p>
        <p>Whether Hampton plays on the New York stage much longer is the multimillion-dollar question. For now, Hampton said, the only thing he loses sleep over is his performance on the mound.</p>
        <p>''I sleep maybe two or three hours after a start, regardless of how I pitch,'' he said.</p>
