        <p>Two advertisers are expanding relationships with agencies.</p>
        <p>Micro Compact Car in Renningen, Germany, part of DaimlerChrysler, has named Springer &amp; Jacoby in Hamburg, Germany, to handle marketing communications for its two-seat urban car in markets outside of Germany. Billings were estimated at $40 million. Springer &amp; Jacoby, which was chosen to handle Micro's Smart car account in Germany in June, also handles the German account for Mercedes-Benz, also owned by DaimlerChrysler.</p>
        <p>The decision came after a review that had been narrowed to Springer &amp; Jacoby and one other finalist, Leagas-Delaney in London. The account was previously at Weber Hodel Schmid in Zurich for three years.</p>
        <p>The decision is significant because last month Springer &amp; Jacoby agreed to sell an initial 35.5 percent stake to True North Communications in Chicago. The DaimlerChrysler Group in Auburn Hills, Mich., is considering units of either True North or the Omnicom Group, for the possible consolidation of the creative and media account for all Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep and corporate ads, with an annual budget of $1.8 billion.</p>
        <p>Also, Nestle USA has named the Dallas office of Publicis in Mid America, part of the Publicis Groupe to handle the account for Power Bar, which had been at Wieden &amp; Kennedy in Portland, Ore. Billings were estimated at $20 million.</p>
        <p>Alyssa Berman, a spokeswoman at Power Bar in Berkeley, Calif., confirmed a report of the decision in the online edition of Adweek, adding that the choice was made without a review. She said Nestle, which acquired Power Bar in March, has opted to move the account to one of its worldwide agencies. The Dallas office of Publicis in Mid America also handles United States ice cream and juice beverage advertising for Nestle.</p>
