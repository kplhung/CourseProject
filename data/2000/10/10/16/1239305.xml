        <p>Robert K. Brown, a retired Army colonel,  snatches a ringing phone while sitting amid strewn manuscripts, laundry, defused ordnance, plaques, pictures and a mock human brain in a clear bucket of bubbling water.</p>
        <p>''Maximus!'' he snaps.</p>
        <p>He is fielding a barrage of telephone assaults in his Boulder, Colo., office on a busy Saturday morning. The founder, editor and publisher of Soldier of Fortune magazine is not a patient man.</p>
        <p>Slam. The receiver goes down and Maximus -- Mr. Brown's self-assigned nickname, a reference to the Russell Crowe character in ''Gladiator'' who cheats death only to rise again and fight the Roman establishment -- spits a round of tobacco juice into an aging coffee mug.</p>
        <p>He is brash, cantankerous, egotistical, intelligent and always in your face. He never sees gray on an issue.</p>
        <p>This week, Mr. Brown celebrated his magazine's 25th anniversary at its annual Las Vegas convention. That makes him a survivor. But the convention drew only 250 people, half the number it did in the early 1980's.  It was further confirmation that though the world's first and only supermarket tabloid for mercenaries, mercenary-wannabes and anyone fascinated by combat and conflict remains one of the most identifiable military brands around, it no longer carries the impact it once did.</p>
        <p>Time and the world have caught up to the 67-year-old Mr. Brown. At the heart of his success was the magazine's unusual, but popular, editorial mission: Soldier of Fortune's foreign correspondents often do not simply report from trouble spots, they join the fight. And the magazine has consistently been one of the greatest media advocates for disgruntled Vietnam veterans. It was anger over their treatment that led Mr. Brown to start the magazine in 1975 after returning from two tours of duty.</p>
        <p>But times have changed. ''Now, the cold war is over,'' he said. ''You don't have the interest in those countries. And, the Vietnam veteran is  older, more mellow. He's gotten a certain amount of acceptance and the recognition that he didn't have 25 years ago.''</p>
        <p>The changes have left the magazine searching for its editorial place in face of a new world order and declining profits. While a steady base of 20,000 subscribers ''keeps the engines running,'' Mr. Brown said (the magazine's circulation is not independently audited), he acknowledges, and others at Soldier of Fortune confirm, his newsstand sales have plummeted the last 10 years to around 40,000 in a good month, far from its high of 150,000 during the cold war.</p>
        <p>''Soldier of Fortune has become an oxymoron,'' said Samir Husni, a professor of media studies at the University of Mississippi, who follows the magazine industry. ''There was once a fortune to be made in being a soldier. There is no place where those folks can go and fight the good fight and make some money.''</p>
        <p>Dan Goure, deputy director of the International Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a public policy research institution, said modern trends were not in the magazine's favor. A politically muddled world, job-producing economies, a fading romance with Rambo and a generation of young adults who were never drafted and never trained in war have inevitably whittled away Soldier of Fortune's market.</p>
        <p>''Today, America's image of war is an F-16 at 20,000 feet dropping a precision bomb,'' Mr. Goure said. ''High-tech conflicts and Soldier of Fortune are just incompatible.''</p>
        <p>But people who follow the magazine say Soldier of Fortune is likely to survive. Mr. Brown has already shifted its tone in light of bottom-line realities. Traditionally, the magazine practiced a particularly bloody form of ''participatory journalism.'' When he had the cash, Mr. Brown dispatched not just a reporter but small mercenary ''teams'' to deliver supplies, train, write and fight. In 1981, Mr. Brown and the magazine spent $350,000 in a failed search for prisoners of war in Vietnam. In 1992, he sent fighters and writers to support Croatian forces.</p>
        <p>But those efforts came when ''we had the luxury of money,'' Mr. Brown said. With revenue shrinking -- Soldier of Fortune grossed about $2 million last year, down from $7 million in the early 1980's, he said -- the magazine's teams are grounded. Its emphasis has often shifted to domestic, less expensive, somewhat wonkier topics, like opposition to gun control; columns like the ''Slick Willie Watch''; open-seas piracy; and warnings of Vietnam-like quagmires (''Colombia Burning: The Dark Future of Narco-Wars'').</p>
        <p>''Instead of shooting from the hip, they are shooting from the brain,'' Mr. Husni said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brown has also hedged his financial woes by licensing Soldier of Fortune's identity -- first to Hollywood in 1995 for a one-hour television action drama and earlier this year to Activision, which developed a Soldier of Fortune computer game. The series was canceled, but the game has grossed more than $5 million, according to PC Data, a market research firm.</p>
        <p>Still, the magazine will have trouble shaking its reputation. ''If you want to go find the mercenary to kill someone for you, you pick up a copy of Soldier of Fortune,'' Mr. Husni said. And that might be unfair: the magazine changed its policy regarding mercenary ads 15 years ago.</p>
        <p>In 1993, the magazine and the Omega Group, its corporate entity, were held negligently liable after an assassin hired through a classified ad in Soldier of Fortune murdered a Georgia man in 1985. Mr. Brown lost a $4.3 million judgment. He settled the case for $200,000, and Soldier of Fortune has not run a similar classified ad since the murder.</p>
        <p>Through it all, Mr. Brown says, he has been waiting patiently for the next big war or conflict to lift sales. In the meantime, back in his office, Mr. Brown's thoughts are on Sierra Leone and a September feature story in which his reporter (a South African mercenary) mans a machine gun on a Russian Mi-24 attack helicopter for the government. Sierra Leone is battling a notoriously brutal rebel group, the Revolutionary United Front, which killed one of the magazine's reporters in 1995. Like an old coach reminiscing of his playing days, he ponders his comeback.</p>
        <p>''I still may go to Sierra Leone,'' he said.</p>
        <p>To help fight or do a story?</p>
        <p>''Both,'' he said. ''I'm not going to bring a team. I'm just thinking of doing my memoirs and I can see that as an opener: The last hurrah! I'm too old to bust through the bush with a 60-pound pack, but I sure as hell can operate a machine gun out of an Mi-24. And nothing would give me more pleasure than some pay back for my guy.''</p>
