        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Paul Krugman (''A Retirement Fable,'' column, Oct. 11) pointed out the unreality of the current plans to save Social Security, but did not mention the obvious solution -- which is to apply the Social Security tax to the whole of our incomes, not just a part.</p>
        <p>Increasing the income subject to the Federal Insurance Contributions Act would enable us to reduce the rate of the tax, making it much less burdensome on the working poor and the middle class. Including investment income would garner additional money, as would taxing total Social Security payments to those retirees with substantial incomes from other pensions and investment.</p>
        <p>If the Federal Insurance Contributions Act is recognized for what it is, simply a tax on income, perhaps a change could be instituted. That those with higher incomes would contribute more than others is consistent with the income tax system we already have.</p>
