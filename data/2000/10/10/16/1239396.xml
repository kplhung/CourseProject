        <p>His mother remarked to Roger Clemens how calm he looked in Game 4, when he struck out 15 and allowed just one hit, and his wife and his manager said the same thing about Clemens. He usually stalks around the mound like a ravenous bear, but he admitted feeling strangely sedate.</p>
        <p>About 90 minutes before Saturday night's game, Clemens was on the trainer's table and caught himself yawning a couple of times. ''I was thinking, 'This isn't a good thing,' '' Clemens recalled this morning with a smile.</p>
        <p>It might have been the best game of his career, Clemens agreed, given the circumstances and the opponent, a playoff game on the road. Seattle left fielder Al Martin, who had the Mariners' only hit in the Yankees' 5-0 victory, said he had never seen anyone throwing forkballs at 90-91 miles an hour, as Clemens was. Edgar Martinez took a called third strike on an inside slider that he said he never really saw.</p>
        <p>Clemens's fastball reached as high as 99 m.p.h., and was consistently 95-97 m.p.h. The Yankees' David Justice played for years with Atlanta's Greg Maddux and Tom Glavine and has seen many games in which a pitcher shut down the opposing team. But as far as doing it with power pitching, ''there was nothing like Roger,'' Justice said.</p>
        <p>After the game, Torre called his pitching coach, Mel Stottlemyre, who is recovering from treatment for bone-marrow cancer, and handed the phone to Clemens. ''It was awesome,'' Clemens said. ''He sounded in really good spirits. I told him we miss him.''</p>
        <p>Clemens later spoke with his mother, Bess, who is staying in New York and hoping to attend the World Series if she is feeling well enough. ''She just started laughing,'' Clemens reported, adding that his mother said, ''Never count you out.''</p>
        <p>Clemens's one-hitter was the first in a League Championship Series, and he became the third pitcher in history to strike out 15 in a league championship game. Livan Hernandez of the Florida Marlins whiffed 15 in 1997, the day after Baltimore's Mike Mussina struck out 15 over seven innings in a game that eventually concluded in extra innings.</p>
        <p>Clemens has never thrown a no-hitter, and in the only other one-hitter in his career, a 6-0 victory over Cleveland on Sept. 10, 1988, the only hit tipped off the glove of second baseman Marty Barrett -- just as Martin's hit ticked off the glove of first baseman Tino Martinez in the seventh inning on Saturday.</p>
        <p>''I just can't jump high enough,'' Martinez said today, smiling as he passed Clemens and a horde of reporters. ''Sorry.''</p>
        <p>Seattle's All-Star shortstop, Alex Rodriguez, ducked away from a couple of fastballs in the first inning of Game 4, and Seattle Manager Lou Piniella flatly accused Clemens of throwing at him. ''He wants to throw at our guys, we'll throw at his guys, period,'' Piniella said.</p>
        <p>Torre has a good relationship with Piniella, but he took issue with Piniella's words and referred to Piniella's supposed feud with Paul O'Neill, the Yankee right fielder. ''I know Paul O'Neill over the past few years has had to clean his uniform off a few times when we've come in here,'' Torre said. ''I've never felt or accused them of trying to hit O'Neill, but it just so happened that just about every game, he was pitched under his chin.''</p>
        <p>Clemens said it was ''a joke'' that the brushbacks could cause such anger in the Mariners. In a pregame interview with Michael Kay of ABC Radio, Clemens responded to Piniella's remark, ''I'll defer to my mother, who said you should never getting into a hissing match with a skunk.''</p>
        <p>Torre knows that if the Yankees play the Mets in the World Series, there will be tension left over from when Clemens beaned Mike Piazza on July 8. He said he is not afraid to pitch Clemens in Shea Stadium, where Clemens would have to bat -- everybody would be holding their breath when Clemens came to bat, Torre acknowledged -- but he added that he ''is not looking for a confrontation.'' Torre could avoid the issue if he started Clemens in Game 2 and a possible Game 6, in Yankee Stadium, rather than Games 1 or 3.</p>
