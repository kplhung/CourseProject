        <p>Last week, I.B.M. announced a plan to pour $2.5 billion into constructing a new microchip factory in East Fishkill, N.Y., the biggest investment in I.B.M.'s history. It then underscored its intent to be a superpower in semiconductors well into the 21st century by committing an additional $2.5 billion to modernize chip plants in Burlington, Vt., and overseas.</p>
        <p>Despite the huge sums, I.B.M.'s risks seem remarkably modest.</p>
        <p>The East Fishkill factory is not scheduled to be ready before 2003, putting I.B.M. up to a year behind rivals like Intel and NEC in the industry's transition to making chips on 12-inch silicon wafers instead of today's 8-inch wafers. The bigger format should bolster profitability by yielding hundreds more chips per wafer. But I.B.M. says it is content to lag behind a bit -- so that others bear the brunt of any kinks in new machinery being designed for handling the bigger sizes.</p>
        <p>As for the rest of the modernizing, it is a  drive to capitalize on a recent burst of I.B.M. design and manufacturing innovations before competitors catch up.</p>
        <p>The innovations might seem obscure to those outside semiconductor circles -- techniques for replacing aluminum connectors with more efficient copper wire, novel insulating designs that allow processors to run faster while consuming less power and so forth. But the new wrinkles are cropping up in electronic devices from the largest mainframes to the slenderest cellular phones as well as communications routers, switches and countless other components that drive the growth of the Internet.</p>
        <p>Louis V. Gerstner Jr., chairman and chief executive of I.B.M., said last week that demand for the kinds of chips I.B.M. makes for itself and other electronics companies was ''white hot.'' With most of that demand stemming from the growth of the Internet and telecommunications, no end is in sight.</p>
        <p>''We've strapped ourselves to a rocket,'' said John Kelly III, the senior vice president for the I.B.M. microelectronics unit. ''The $5 billion is just to keep fueling it.''</p>
        <p>Chip making is a small piece of I.B.M.'s balance sheet. The company does not break out results for its microelectronics group, but analysts estimate it will contribute about $4.2 billion, or just under 5 percent, of I.B.M.'s projected revenues of around $90 billion this year. Thomas Kraemer, a Merrill Lynch analyst, estimates the unit is growing at a 30 percent clip and that profits are climbing almost as fast.</p>
        <p>No wonder longtime I.B.M. watchers like Sam O. Albert, an information technology consultant in Scarsdale, N.Y., said the $5 billion plan ''wasn't a tough call.''</p>
        <p>But the decision does reflect a tough call Mr. Gerstner made seven years ago, shortly after he arrived at I.B.M. to confront the  task of turning around what was then a loss-ridden company. After studying the work in I.B.M.'s laboratories and the cost structure of its manufacturing, Mr. Gerstner decreed that I.B.M. would no longer make electronic components like disk drives and microchips solely for its own use.</p>
        <p>That order freed executives in the components groups to produce as much as they could sell, even if some of those customers were outsiders who could use I.B.M. innovations to compete with other parts of I.B.M. To reinforce the mandate, Mr. Kelly moved researchers from the company's Yorktown Heights, N.Y., lab, as well as application developers from its chip plants, into a development center in East Fishkill with the assignment of rapidly pushing the most promising technology into production.</p>
        <p>Since then, more than $1 billion has been invested in the development center, which currently employs 1,400 workers in East Fishkill and 300 more technicians at other I.B.M. sites; some 200 technical experts dispatched from various customers and partners are also working at the center.</p>
        <p>The new strategy goaded the rest of I.B.M. to race ahead with products incorporating those components before I.B.M.'s competitors did.</p>
        <p>''Putting it in the marketplace put pressure on the rest of the company to adapt new technology rapidly,'' said Stephen C. Dube, an analyst who follows I.B.M. for Wasserstein Perella Securities.</p>
        <p>For much of the last decade, the strategy's perils were more prominent than its payoffs. I.B.M.'s microelectronics group invested heavily in joint ventures to design new memory chips and expand its dynamic random access -- or D-RAM -- memory chip production, then paid dearly for it when the market for such commodity chips crashed in 1996. Unwinding that mistake has taken years. The last step was I.B.M.'s pending sale of its share of a memory chip plant in Manassas, Va., to Toshiba, its partner.</p>
        <p>Nor has Mr. Gerstner's open-door strategy always helped I.B.M.'s product groups. The EMC Corporation, for instance, is using I.B.M.-made disk drives to battle I.B.M. for the data storage market. And I.B.M.'s agreement to sell Dell Computer $16 billion of components over seven years is strengthening one of the toughest competitors of I.B.M.'s struggling PC group.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kelly said, ''1999 was a key year.  That's when outside customers stopped asking me whether I.B.M. would get preferential treatment.''</p>
        <p>I.B.M. says that its hardware units are generally making better use of its chip innovations than any rivals are. The latest example, scheduled to be announced today, is a new line of large I.B.M. servers with a base price of $420,000 that run the Unix operating system.</p>
        <p>I.B.M. said the new computers used copper circuitry and chips with an innovative I.B.M. insulation design that allows transistors to work more quickly. It said its tests showed that the new server, using just 24 processors, performed transactions 40 percent faster than the more expensive ''flagship'' computer with 64 processors from Sun Microsystems, the Unix market leader.</p>
        <p>Such developments signal how the microelectronics unit hopes it can help I.B.M. far beyond the sales and profit it generates directly. But the unit's success is measured by more specific benchmarks, like whether the development center churns out enough leading-edge technology that the royalties, licensing and outside joint development contributions more than cover the center's costs.</p>
        <p>''The second guy pays the first guy,'' said Bijan Divari, vice president for technology and emerging products at the microelectronics unit. ''If you're not first, the whole thing unravels.''</p>
        <p>Lately, I.B.M. has been first or nearly so with an impressive number of microchip developments. The hit parade began in 1997 with I.B.M.'s announcement that it devised an economical method of laying copper circuits on microchips, a much more efficient conductor than aluminum. So far, I.B.M. is the only microchip maker mass-producing such chips, though Motorola and some others are striving to catch up.</p>
        <p>In 1998, in a similar breakthrough, I.B.M. said it had overcome the longstanding challenge of efficiently laying a very thin layer of silicon under the transistors on chips and insulating them from the thick substrate below. The technology, known as S.O.I. for silicon on insulator, bolsters chip performance up to 35 percent by allowing chips to handle power much more efficiently.</p>
        <p>I.B.M. also figured out how to use a soft insulating polymer from Dow Chemical to cram copper circuits more closely together, allowing chip designers to increase processor speed and reliability. Another series of innovations gave I.B.M. the technology lead in handling silicon germanium, a material especially suited for making the kind of compact, high-performance chips for handling radio signals used in cell phones and other wireless communications devices.</p>
        <p>But I.B.M.'s real advantage, according to analysts like Trevor Yancey at IC Insights in Scottsdale, Ariz., is coming from aggressively integrating so many of the new technologies. If things pan out as I.B.M. plans, that process will reach a new pinnacle at the new factory in East Fishkill.</p>
