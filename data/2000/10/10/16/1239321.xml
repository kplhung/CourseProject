        <p>It was on Sept. 30, 1996 that Lucent Technologies left the nest and began its new life as a maker of communications equipment independent from its parent, AT&amp;T. That day, Lucent's shares closed at a split-adjusted value a bit below $11.</p>
        <p>Last Tuesday, a little more than four years later, the company unnerved Wall Street, announcing for the third time this year that it would not meet its financial targets. The next day, Lucent's shares lost about a third of their value, falling $10 to $21.38. The stock closed on Friday at $23.25, down from almost $80 late last year.</p>
        <p>In this era, for the stock of a major technology company to merely double its price of four years ago amounts to an investing bust. What happened? How did this company, which as recently as a year ago was widely considered a model of success, sputter so badly?</p>
        <p>There may be concern among investors and analysts that a broad slowdown in spending on communications gear threatens the health of the entire communications equipment industry. But Lucent's problems seem largely of its own making.</p>
        <p>Led by Richard A. McGinn, originally the president and now the chairman and chief executive, Lucent's senior managers seem to have become blinded by their early success. Whatever the cause, it is now clear that the company got into trouble by promising too much to Wall Street, while being too slow to force money-making results from its vast and vaunted Bell Laboratories research operation.</p>
        <p>In the early going, freed by the AT&amp;T spinoff to sell equipment to telecommunications companies that had viewed AT&amp;T as a competitor, Lucent enjoyed fast sales growth, particularly with its optical networking gear. So brisk were sales in 1996 and 1997, in fact, that the following year Lucent decided to de-emphasize the development of a new generation of optical networking equipment known in the industry as OC-192 gear.</p>
        <p>Only in hindsight is it clear what a crucial misjudgment that was.</p>
        <p>OC-192 equipment can transmit 10 billion bits of digital information a second using a single wavelength of light. And Lucent's main rival, Nortel Networks of Canada, made that sort of gear a top priority.</p>
        <p>Now, Nortel is riding high on the strength of its optical business, one of the most robust segments of the communications equipment industry, as corporations and carriers demand gear capable of carrying not only voice and data, but also video and other high-speed traffic. In the meantime, Lucent relied too long on its lineup of older equipment, while deciding to invest in a new type of optical networking gear that has not been as successful as OC-192 technology.</p>
        <p>''It all boils down to kind of one fundamental thing,'' William T. O'Shea, Lucent's executive vice president for corporate strategy and business development, said Friday in an interview. ''And that is, we made a decision around OC-192 and 10-gigabit optical systems that, frankly, we're still living with. At that point in time, that stuff was just getting started, and we and Nortel were just about neck-and-neck in optical. Nortel now is several times our size. If we had made a different decision and had shown an optical business this year and this quarter the size of Nortel's, we wouldn't even notice the other things we've talked about.''</p>
        <p>Lucent declined to make Mr. McGinn available for comment.</p>
        <p>Another thing Lucent talked about on Tuesday was an increased exposure to bad debt, the result of lending to its own customers. But even that problem seems to reflect the corporate culture and engineering philosophy under Mr. McGinn.</p>
        <p>For decades, one of the biggest criticisms of AT&amp;T, and more recently Lucent, has been that the company did a great job of inventing new technologies but was sometimes slow to turn those technologies into revenue-producing, market-leading products. The older examples include the transistor, the laser and cellular wireless technology.</p>
        <p>And in the early 1990's, Bell Labs was a leader in technology for connecting optical communications rings to one another. Now, that market is dominated by Tellabs Inc. and Alcatel of France.</p>
        <p>Similarly, Lucent developed the best chips for a kind of communications technology called asynchronous transfer mode, or A.T.M., which is the foundation of many modern networks. But another company, Ascend Communications, used Lucent's chips to make what were widely viewed as the best A.T.M. switches. In the end, Lucent had to spend $20 billion of its shareholders' equity to acquire Ascend in order to stay competitive in that market.</p>
        <p>''Generically, Bell Labs is wonderful at inventing things,'' Steven D. Levy, an analyst with Lehman Brothers, said on Friday. ''Yet there are very few things that you can point to where the Bell Labs parent, whether it was AT&amp;T in the old days or Lucent today, has ever been the commercial market leader because they were the first to market. One of the biggest changes is that product cycles are getting shorter, so there is much more of a sense of urgency. In that environment, you cannot afford to make sure that everything is 120 percent correct.''</p>
        <p>Spend any time in Silicon Valley and you may hear people complaining that Cisco Systems does so little research and yet makes so much money. Cisco has thrived by acquiring companies with valuable technology and then turning that technology into products customers can buy.</p>
        <p>But Lucent's technology problem is not only a matter of being too slow to bring the fruits of Bell Labs to market. In the case of optical networking, the company also made a bet that has yet to pay off.</p>
        <p>Rather than stress the new OC-192 generation of products, Lucent concentrated on other sorts of gear that can transmit multiple colors of light over a single optical fiber using a technique called wave-division multiplexing. Equipment for this technology has become an important part of the communications industry, but it has not made up for Lucent's weakness in OC-192 business.</p>
        <p>Now, Lucent's researchers are working on technology for the next generation, equipment that will be able to transmit 40 billion bits of information a second. The question is whether that technology, known as OC-768, will make a timely leap from the lab to the market.</p>
        <p>Many companies guess wrong about the future direction of technology, of course. But Lucent's mistakes were magnified by the heightened expectations the company raised on Wall Street. After impressing analysts with revenue growth of 15 percent in the early going, Mr. McGinn said in 1998 that the company would move toward sustained annual growth of 20 percent.</p>
        <p>But Lucent has not been able to pull that off. Last Tuesday, the company said it would show year-over-year revenue growth of 14 to 15 percent for the quarter that ended last month. It had previously led analysts to believe that per-share earnings would increase by roughly 15 percent in the quarter. But on Tuesday, the company broke the bad news that those earnings would decline.</p>
        <p>As an indication of the compounding nature of corporate mistakes, some analysts have said that it was Lucent's self-imposed pressure to achieve overly ambitious revenue goals that led the company to offer ever more generous terms and credit to its customers. That practice contributed to the bad-debt problem that Lucent disclosed last week.</p>
        <p>How quickly the troubles have piled up for Lucent, a mere four years after the company's heady start. The question now is how long the company's board will give Mr. McGinn to fix the problems.</p>
