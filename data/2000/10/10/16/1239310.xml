        <p>THE annual conference of the Association of National Advertisers, which began here on Friday, is as notable this year for who the speakers are as for what they are saying.</p>
        <p>That's because the association, the trade organization of America's biggest marketers, has ended an unusual practice that fundamentally altered the speaker roster the last three years.

        <p>THE annual conference of the Association of National Advertisers, which began here on Friday, is as notable this year for who the speakers are as for what they are saying.</p>
        <p>That's because the association, the trade organization of America's biggest marketers, has ended an unusual practice that fundamentally altered the speaker roster the last three years. The conference, which ends tonight, is the first since 1996 for which the association did not sell sponsorships of daily general sessions and speaker slots to media companies seeking to promote themselves to an audience of potential customers.</p>
        <p>The sponsorships, which had cost companies $100,000 each to buy their way onto the conference agenda, were widely derided as corporate infomercials that limited more useful discussion of important issues that faced marketers -- from the increasing influence of the Internet to the growing power of and consolidation among traditional retailers.</p>
        <p>With the end of the sponsorships, a decision that the association made in June, the program for this conference -- the 91st annual gathering of the organization -- was more topical and timely, focusing on ''Brand Building in the New E-conomy.''</p>
        <p>An example of the more appropriate and relevant content of the conference came at the second general session, held yesterday morning, when the opening speaker was Alan G. Lafley, the new president and chief executive of Procter &amp; Gamble, the packaged goods giant that sets the pace for so much of American consumer marketing. It was Mr. Lafley's first major public speech since he took over Procter in June after the unexpected, forced departure of his predecessor, Durk I. Jager.</p>
        <p>''Make no mistake: the advertising industry is in the midst of revolutionary change,'' Mr. Lafley said because ''consumer expectations are changing.''</p>
        <p>''Consumers are becoming activists; less passive, more participative,'' he added. ''They expect more performance, quality and value. They demand more control.''</p>
        <p>''In the face of changes that so directly and so fundamentally impact brands,'' Mr. Lafley said, ''we have no choice but to lead. In fact, if we -- the global and national brand advertisers represented here -- don't lead changes with current and potential consumers of our products and services, then others will.''</p>
        <p>To that point, Mr. Lafley made an unusual reference for a Procter chief executive: he named a competitor, praising Starbucks, which he said ''shook up the coffee business by reinventing coffee and recreating the coffee experience.'' Procter sells Folger's, the nation's leading supermarket coffee.</p>
        <p>''Whenever established leading brands fail to stay close to consumers or fail to lead innovation, then someone else will step in to do it for them,'' he added pointedly. ''So it's up to us to change the way we brand and market and serve consumers.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lafley told the nearly 500 people at the general session yesterday morning that marketers ''also have to rethink the way we market our brands.''</p>
        <p>''Marketing has historically been about transactions,'' he added. ''We transmit a message and hope the consumer receives it. We provide a benefit and hope the consumer recognizes and appreciates it. In the future a consumer will expect more of a relationship with the brand in their lives.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lafley outlined plans by Procter to focus more on inventing brands, like Reflect.com, a line of custom-made cosmetics and beauty products sold on the Internet, and reinventing brands like Pampers and Tide.</p>
        <p>Not only is Procter doing that, Mr. Lafley said, the company, which sells 300 brands in 140 countries, is also reconsidering how it sells its wares through the media.</p>
        <p>''Over all, we're looking at a wider mix, more alternatives to TV,'' Mr. Lafley said.</p>
        <p>''We still very much believe in TV,'' he added. ''TV is tremendous for dramatization, telling a story, but we have to be where the consumer is, creating new ways to touch and interact.''</p>
        <p>Another well-received speaker, who in all likelihood would not have appeared at this conference were sponsorships still being sold, was Philip B. Dusenberry, chairman of the BBDO New York unit of BBDO Worldwide, part of the Omnicom Group.</p>
        <p>At the first general session, on Saturday morning, Mr. Dusenberry offered a provocative dissent from the philosophy that global advertisers ought to tailor their sales pitches specifically to local markets.</p>
        <p>''Intrepid U.S. companies with great successful brands have been sending them off to global glory for years,'' Mr. Dusenberry said. ''Is that the fate for a great American brand, to become a local pipsqueak?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Dusenberry called on global brands to strive for what he called ''the majesty of scale, never stinting on production values, never looking homegrown or second-rate, to have the stature that local brands cannot afford.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Dusenberry spoke from experience. Two big BBDO New York clients, the Pepsi-Cola and Frito-Lay units of PepsiCo, are strong supporters of global branding, while the principal competitor of the Pepsi-Cola soft drink, the Coca-Cola Company, has recently begun to encourage local adaptations of the worldwide Coca-Cola brand campaign, ''Enjoy.''</p>
        <p>The conference, held at the Ritz-Carlton Laguna Niguel Hotel here, also devoted time to the annual election of officers and the presentations of awards.</p>
        <p>John D. Hayes, executive vice president for global advertising at American Express, was elected chairman of the association for 2000-2001. He succeeds Joseph V. Tripodi, chief marketing officer at the Seagram Spirits and Wine Group, part of the Joseph E. Seagram &amp; Sons unit of the Seagram Company.</p>
        <p>Dawn Hudson, senior vice president for strategy and marketing at PepsiCo, was elected vice chairwoman for 2000-2001. She succeeds Mr. Hayes, the vice chairman for 1999-2000.</p>
        <p>On the awards front, Robert L. Wehling, was presented the Robert V. Goldstein Award for volunteer work, named after a former board member of the association and the Advertising Council. Mr. Wehling, global marketing officer at Procter, received the award for serving as president of, and campaign adviser to, the Education Excellence Partnership, which seeks to generate public support for raising academic standards in schools.</p>
        <p>Matt Wisk was given the Grand Marketer of the Year Award by the trade publication Brandweek at the opening dinner of the conference on Friday. Mr. Wisk, who oversees worldwide advertising for the European business-to-business unit of Nokia, was selected from winners of Marketer of the Year Awards in 12 categories for his work promoting the Nokia mobile telephone brand when he was vice president for national marketing for Nokia in the United States.</p>
        <p>Finally, the first All-America Award for Advertising, sponsored by Parade, the Sunday newspaper supplement, went to R. David Thomas, founder and senior chairman of Wendy's International. The award is meant to honor business achievement and humanitarian work; in Mr. Thomas's case, that work is his promotion of adoption services that includes forming the Dave Thomas Foundation for Adoption. Parade is owned by Advance Publications.</p>
