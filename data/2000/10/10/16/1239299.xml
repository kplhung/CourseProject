        <p>Verizon Communications sent letters to 250,000 customers in the state of New York earlier this month, telling them how the company was ''shaking things up.'' Little did the recipients suspect how truly hot the offer was.</p>
        <p>The Verizon pitch was for a lower-cost international calling rate plan, and a toll-free sign-up number was provided at the bottom of the letter. But callers to that number instead heard a recording directing them to another toll-free number. This second number is operated by a phone-sex company calling itself Intimate Encounters, which offers one-on-one discussions with women, on a variety of sexual topics, for $2.99 a minute, payable by credit card.</p>

        <p>Verizon Communications sent letters to 250,000 customers in the state of New York earlier this month, telling them how the company was ''shaking things up.'' Little did the recipients suspect how truly hot the offer was.</p>
        <p>The Verizon pitch was for a lower-cost international calling rate plan, and a toll-free sign-up number was provided at the bottom of the letter. But callers to that number instead heard a recording directing them to another toll-free number. This second number is operated by a phone-sex company calling itself Intimate Encounters, which offers one-on-one discussions with women, on a variety of sexual topics, for $2.99 a minute, payable by credit card.</p>
        <p>''It's a typo problem, we believe,'' said Eric Rabe, a spokesman for Verizon. ''I just wonder why typos like these don't refer people to a church or something of that nature instead of phone sex.''</p>
        <p>In an attempt at damage control, Verizon halted the mailing. But nearly 70,000 customers had received the letter as of last week. Representatives of Verizon, the company formed by Bell Atlantic's acquisition of GTE, called each of these customers to alert them of the mistake and provide them with the correct number.</p>
        <p>Investigating the matter, Verizon discovered that the company that created Intimate Encounters leases its toll-free number from AT&amp;T and is probably based somewhere in India, though its exact location has not been determined.</p>
        <p>The incident was reminiscent of mischief in August, when more than 80,000 employees of Verizon went on strike to demand easier union organizing rules and improved work conditions. Back then, the company was hit by several incidents of vandalism committed by striking employees.</p>
        <p>But ''we've ruled out intentional sabotage,'' said Mr. Rabe, who coordinated Verizon's public relations during the 18-day strike. ''We're happy to have those days behind us.''</p>
