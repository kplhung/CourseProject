        <p>A picture on Saturday with a capsule analysis of a new television commercial released by Jon S. Corzine, the New Jersey Democratic candidate for United States Senate, was published in error. It showed a scene from a new commercial in support of Mr. Corzine's opponent, Representative Bob Franks. A correction in this space yesterday misidentified the sponsor of the new commercial. It was paid for by the Republican Leadership Council, not by Mr. Franks.</p>
