        <p>One of the most tedious aspects of doing one's own income taxes is having to enter all the data from every W-2 wage statement and 1099 income report from banks and mutual funds.</p>
        <p>Now Intuit Inc. has taken a step in allowing users of its popular TurboTax and MacinTax software to download this data from the Internet.</p>
        <p>The company plans to announce today that the next versions of its tax software will have the direct-download capability. And so far Intuit has lined up eight financial organizations that plan to make their taxpayer data available over the Internet.</p>
        <p>Five of Intuit's partners are the investment firms Fidelity Investments, Salomon Smith Barney, TD Waterhouse, T. Rowe Price and the Vanguard Group. The other three are payroll-services companies: Ceridian, PeopleSoft and ProBusiness.</p>
        <p>The partners have the potential, Intuit said, of reaching a total of 20 million tax filers via the Internet with information that includes 1099 and W-2 forms, as well as data like interest income, dividend income, and stock sales.</p>
        <p>Besides reducing the need for taxpayers to key so much data into their computers and sift through so many financial statements, the system is meant to reduce the risk of error.</p>
        <p>Intuit's automated tax return, which took 18 months to develop, will be embedded in next year's TurboTax and MacinTax products and available in late January on the company's Web site.</p>
        <p>Harnessing the power of the Internet to exchange information electronically will help Intuit's partners cut costs, reducing paperwork and even the cost of postage, said Bob Meighan, a vice president and general manager of Intuit in San Diego.</p>
        <p>''Two years down the road, banks and mutual fund companies don't want to mail information to investors,'' Mr. Meighan said.</p>
        <p>One of the partners, Ceridian -- which provides payroll and benefits services to 40,000 employers nationwide, including Chrysler and Hewlett-Packard -- plans to give a discount on Intuit products, post banner ads on employer Web sites and alert employees to the service by printing a message on W-2 forms.</p>
        <p>''What we're finding is that the World Wide Web is creating the opportunity to have interactions with the employees of employers,'' said John Stauffer, Ceridian's senior vice president of marketing for tax operations.</p>
        <p>Privacy issues could be a potential stumbling block. Although Intuit said  the technology uses a secure Internet connection with military-grade encryption, employers must agree to participate before their tax data is made available to the system.</p>
        <p>But the approach is in keeping with the goal of the Internal Revenue Service, which has said it would like to see at least 80 percent of all individual tax returns filed electronically by 2007. So far, that total is only about 27 percent a year.</p>
