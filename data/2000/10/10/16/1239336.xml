        <p>If Europe's only remaining strongman of any note was shaken by the specter of Slobodan Milosevic's sudden fall from power in Yugoslavia, he showed no signs of it at the polls in his own country today.</p>
        <p>Aleksandr Lukashenko, the autocratic president of Belarus, all but mocked his critics as he cast his vote this morning in a parliamentary election that the United States and other Western nations have called meaningless and that he insisted mirrors the will of his subjects.</p>
        <p>''Now let us see the reaction by Western observers, and what kind of motivation they will have not to recognize the outcome of the election,'' he said on state television. ''Over 70 percent of voters will turn up at polling places, and this will be our victory.''</p>
        <p>And in fact, there was no doubt that Mr. Lukashenko's backers would sweep the contest for 110 seats in the Belarussian Parliament, even though preliminary results were not expected before Monday.</p>
        <p>Belarus's small democratic opposition, some of whose members sat in the Parliament before Mr. Lukashenko packed it in a 1996 constitutional referendum that outsiders say was rigged, has boycotted the election as a sham.</p>
        <p>Even if opponents had not staged a boycott, it is doubtful whether they would have mustered much at the polls. Despite a stagnant economy and a growing reputation as Eastern Europe's backwater, Belarus has remained mostly loyal to Mr. Lukashenko and his charismatic, vaguely Soviet style of rule.</p>
        <p>Opinion surveys indicated that only about 1 in 10 voters favored any sort of boycott of the elections.</p>
        <p>In the opposition daily Narodnaya Volya, Anatoly Lebedko, a leading opposition figure, sarcastically challenged voters to shed apathy. ''If you feel no need for change -- if you want Belarus to remain an enclave of lawlessness and poverty at the center of a fast-developing Europe -- then you are free to give your vote to those in power,'' wrote Mr. Lebedko, who heads the United Civic Party.</p>
        <p>Opponents staged rallies this weekend in a score of cities, but an anti-Lukashenko protest in downtown Minsk on Saturday drew only about 3,000 marchers, far below the turnout organizers had hoped for. Mr. Lukashenko called the protesters ''a bunch of windbags'' and said that ''the people will not let them get anywhere near power.''</p>
        <p>He said earlier this week that his government had taken all steps necessary to make the elections conform to the highest European standards of fairness. But the Minsk government has a history of suppressing dissent, including beatings of dissidents. In the last year, two prominent democratic activists have disappeared.</p>
        <p>Among more recent measures, the police are enforcing an administrative rule that prohibits protesters from advocating an election boycott. Anti-Lukashenko activists said this week that more than 100 persons had been detained for violating it.</p>
        <p>On Thursday, the Minsk correspondent for the English-language newspaper Moscow News was beaten in the stairwell of his apartment house, suffering a concussion. Newspaper officials said they believe that his critical reporting on Mr. Lukashenko was a factor in the attack.</p>
        <p>The European Union sent a small delegation to observe the voting, but  stressed beforehand that the presence of the group should not be interpreted as blessing the results.</p>
