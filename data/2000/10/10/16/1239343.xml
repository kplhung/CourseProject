        <p>Hezbollah guerrillas said today that they had captured an Israeli army colonel ''in a complicated security operation.''</p>
        <p>With Hezbollah already holding three Israeli Army sergeants, abducted along the border a week ago, a new Israeli captive can only ratchet up the tension in the area.</p>
        <p>While the wording of the announcement from Hezbollah, the Shiite Muslim guerrilla group that long battled Israel in southern Lebanon, appeared to indicate that the captive was some kind of intelligence operative, there were no specific details. And Israel contradicted the assertions.</p>
        <p>Nachman Shai, the chief spokesman for the Israeli government, said the missing person was a businessman who ''disappeared on his own initiative on personal circumstances a week ago in Europe.''</p>
        <p>And on television tonight, Prime Minister Ehud Barak said: ''A private Israeli citizen, a businessman, who has no connection with either the security establishment or branches beyond his being an officer in reserves, as are tens of thousands of other civilians in the Israel, was probably tempted to travel somewhere in Europe or elsewhere. He was abducted from there by means that are more reminiscent of Mafia tactics than of a legitimate international operation.''</p>
        <p>The leader of Hezbollah, Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, grinning hugely, made the announcement at a conference of Arab and Islamic nationalists here this morning. The session was called to urge Arab governments to support the Palestinian uprising and to reject any compromise at their summit meeting later this month.</p>
        <p>''I inform you gladly,'' he said. ''In a new qualitative achievement and in a complicated security operation, the Islamic resistance was able to take prisoner an Israeli Army officer with the rank of colonel who works with one of the Israeli security agencies.''</p>
        <p>''Let us not give any further details, to keep the Israelis in confusion,'' he added, as delegates to the conference, televised live to the the Arab world on Hezbollah's own station and the independent satellite network Al Jazeera, rose in applause.</p>
        <p>Sheik Nasrallah, wearing the black Shiite clerical turban that marks him as a descendant of the Prophet Muhammad, turned jokingly to the Lebanese prime minister, Selim al-Hoss, sitting beside him at the speaker's table, and added, ''God will help the prime minister for the many phone calls he will get from'' the American secretary of state, Madeleine K. Albright.</p>
        <p>The wording of the Hezbollah announcement appeared to indicate that the colonel had not been taken in a military operation like the abduction of the three soldiers in the Shabaa Farms border area, but in some more shadowy fashion.</p>
        <p>The immediate speculation here was that an Israeli operative -- either from army intelligence or the Mossad, Israel's foreign intelligence service -- had been captured in Lebanon, possibly betrayed by a local double agent. The supposed operative could have been trying to find the location where the three captives were held or sites for possible retaliatory strikes.</p>
        <p>In Israel the first reaction was a frantic search along the northern border, with patrols looking for signs of missing soldiers and a house-to-house check in the northern settlements of the whereabouts of reservists.</p>
        <p>Speculation in Israel then centered on the possibility that an Israeli businessman in Europe might be the captive. Israel's Channel 2 broadcast speculation that he might be a businessman who disappeared in Europe 12 days ago after a dispute with Arabs and might have been sold to Hezbollah. There were reports that the Swiss police were investigating a disappearance.</p>
        <p>In his statement, Mr. Barak said: ''Israel will know how to respond and to identify who is behind this and deal with the issue.</p>
        <p>''This is a norm that cannot be accepted internationally at the threshold of the 21st century. In any event, all of the rumors that were spread as if there had been any sort of abduction along the country's northern border or that a military man or a member of the security establishment or a member of the intelligence services had been abducted, all of these reports are baseless.''</p>
        <p>Israeli operations inside Lebanon are hardly unknown. In 1969, Middle East Airlines planes were blown up at Beirut Airport in retaliation for Palestinian actions. And in 1979, Ali Hassan Salameh, commander of Force 17, Yasir Arafat's top security unit, was assassinated in revenge for the killing of Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics.</p>
        <p>The Israelis were not always infallible. A Moroccan waiter was killed in Lillehammer, Norway, supposedly because he looked like Mr. Salameh.</p>
