        <p>Coach Tommy Bowden was bummed. His Clemson team had just defeated Maryland by 35-14 for a 7-0 record and its best start since the 1981 Tigers were undefeated and won the national championship. Why was the coach singing the blues? His offense gained only 464 yards and all five of its touchdowns were on the ground.</p>
        <p>This is an offensive genius, remember, the Gordon Gekko of college football. Like that character from the film ''Wall Street,'' he spreads his ruthless traders out on the field, most of the time without a huddle, and manipulates yardage until the scoreboard shows a hostile takeover.</p>

        <p>Coach Tommy Bowden was bummed. His Clemson team had just defeated Maryland by 35-14 for a 7-0 record and its best start since the 1981 Tigers were undefeated and won the national championship. Why was the coach singing the blues? His offense gained only 464 yards and all five of its touchdowns were on the ground.</p>
        <p>This is an offensive genius, remember, the Gordon Gekko of college football. Like that character from the film ''Wall Street,'' he spreads his ruthless traders out on the field, most of the time without a huddle, and manipulates yardage until the scoreboard shows a hostile takeover.</p>
        <p>''A lot of people could be happy with that,'' Bowden said glumly. ''Maybe we want too much.''</p>
        <p>When it comes to offense, this is a ''greed is good'' season for college football. Of the five remaining unbeaten teams, four are ranked in the top seven in total offense: Clemson is No. 2; Nebraska No. 3; Oklahoma No. 6; Virginia Tech No. 7; and Texas Christian is still potent at No. 15.</p>
        <p>What Bowden rarely talks about is a lesson often recited by his father, Bobby, who knows a thing or two about winning. It has been handed down on stone tablets from Amos Alonzo Stagg to Pop Warner to Knute Rockne to Bear Bryant to Dr. Tom Osborne to Bobby Bowden: defense wins national titles.</p>
        <p>Tommy Bowden is covered there, too. He has a defensive coordinator, Reggie Herring, who, not surprisingly, played for Bobby Bowden at Florida State. While Clemson's offense is averaging 504 yards a game, Herring's defense is allowing 237, making it the second-stingiest unit in all the land.</p>
        <p>Who is first? T.C.U., which has allowed 236.6 yards a game.</p>
        <p>If the stone tablets are correct, and look no further than the last two years to show that they are, the Tigers, who are ranked fifth in the Associated Press poll of reporters and 11th by the New York Times computer, and T.C.U. (No. 11 A.P.) should meet for the national championship.</p>
        <p>The title-game scenario is improbable because the Horned Frogs play a Western Athletic Conference schedule that is perceived as weak, and that could hurt them in the rankings. Still, those two teams fit the profile of the entrants in the last two Bowl Championship Series championship games.</p>
        <p>In 1998 Florida State had the top-ranked total defense when it met (and lost to) Tennessee, which had the nation's sixth-best defense against the run. Last season, Virginia Tech brought the nation's third-best defense to the Sugar Bowl and lost to the Seminoles, who had the fifth-best scoring defense.</p>
        <p>In short, championship-caliber teams excel in some facet of stopping good offenses.</p>
        <p>The rest of the unbeaten teams have yet to show that. Nebraska, the A.P.'s top-ranked team and the Times computer's No. 3 team, has given up 324 yards a game and is ranked 38th in total defense. Last year the Cornhuskers finished 11-1 on the strength of a defense that was fourth best in the country.</p>
        <p>In a 56-3 rout of Texas Tech on Saturday, the Nebraska defensive players reclaimed the right to call themselves black shirts, the traditional nickname of dread for the unit, by holding the Red Raiders to 200 total yards.</p>
        <p>''We went out there with an attitude and purpose; we went out there relentless,'' linebacker Carlos Polk said.</p>
        <p>Oklahoma (No. 3 A.P., No. 2 The Times) showed why it is ranked second in scoring offense with a victory over the leader in that category. The Sooners beat Kansas State, 41-31, on Saturday. But the Sooners gave up 355 yards, 61 more than their 294.17 average, which is ranked 19th in the nation.</p>
        <p>Virginia Tech Coach Frank Beamer is the first to admit that his Hokies cannot rely on Michael Vick and the offense to keep outscoring opponents. Long before it had Vick, the super sophomore, Virginia Tech played solid defense. But Beamer had to replace eight defensive starters from last year's team and is playing for time.</p>
        <p>The Hokies (No. 2 A.P., No. 1 The Times) moved up to No. 15 from No. 20 in total defense after holding West Virginia to 248 yards in a 48-20 victory.</p>
        <p>''All we need is for our guys to get more experience, to get more snaps and play more games,'' Beamer said. ''Of course, you want guys to get better faster. But these things take time.''</p>
        <p>Improvement on defense will determine which team stays unbeaten.</p>
        <p>In two weeks, Nebraska will travel to Oklahoma. In three weeks, Virginia Tech will go to Miami.</p>
        <p>The Hurricanes (4-1) are ranked No. 4 in the A.P. poll and by the Times computer, but there is a significant chasm between their offense and their defense. When they have the ball, the Hurricanes are the fifth-most-productive team, amassing 478 yards a game. When they do not, they give up 359.8 yards to rank No. 64 in that category.</p>
        <p>Also in three weeks, Tommy Bowden and Clemson will visit his father and Florida State (No. 6 A.P., No. 7 The Times) in Tallahassee. Clemson will find out if its No. 2 defensive ranking is credible. The Seminoles average a nation-high 535 yards a game. And Tommy Bowden will pit his Gekko against his father's Warren E. Buffett. The Seminoles' defense is ranked 14th over all but is sixth against the run and fifth in turning turnovers into points.</p>
        <p>Like Buffett, Bobby Bowden's two national championships say something about scoring and holding.</p>
