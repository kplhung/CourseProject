        <p>Vincent Canby dreamed up a mythical producer named Stanley, a long-running fixture in Arts &amp; and Leisure columns and a perfect, brash, ever-trendy personification of the manners and mores of Hollywood. This figment of Mr. Canby's imagination made a typically flamboyant appearance in a 1991 column:</p>
        <p>Aside from his uncharacteristic pallor, Stanley looked in good shape, trim of figure, freshly steamed, massaged, shaved and shiny.</p>
        <p>Long gone was the Stanley who used to travel with a sunlamp, who in the 1970's wore tailor-made jeans, turtlenecks and suede jackets and who, in the 1980's, affected Reaganesque suits and shirts with French cuffs.</p>
        <p>This Stanley was almost self-effacing in gray slacks, gray-and-white striped shirt and navy blue blazer. The only unusual touch was his tie, which was of a rich yellow satin, embroidered at the center with a pair of large dogs in a discreet embrace.</p>
        <p>''They're not dogs,'' said Stanley. ''They're wolves, and they're dancing.''</p>
        <p>We were having lunch at Le Cirque the day after the Oscar nominations were announced. From the moment he ordered his seltzer, through the drinking of the decaf espressos, Stanley was on the offensive.</p>
        <p>''You can say what you like,'' said Stanley. ''You can call me old-fashioned, maybe even sentimental, but 'Dances With Wolves' is a great picture, even if I didn't produce it myself.'' This was a joke at the expense of Stanley's reputation for being a notorious egomaniac.</p>
        <p>''It has heart,'' he said. ''It has conscience. It's pretty. It has a buffalo stampede. In short, it's a picture all Americans can be proud of. Especially today.''</p>
        <p>''Times being what they are.''</p>
        <p>''Exactly,'' said Stanley. ''But what you people back East don't seem to appreciate is that it's also a great art film.''</p>
        <p>''Because it has subtitles?''</p>
        <p>''Yes,'' said Stanley. ''Kevin [Costner] has guts. To be able to enjoy that picture, you have to be able to read English.''</p>
        <p>''Or understand Sioux.''</p>
        <p>''That's what I mean,'' Stanley said.</p>
