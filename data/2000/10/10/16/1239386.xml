        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Young Blacks Turn to School Vouchers as Civil Rights Issue'' (front page, Oct. 9):</p>
        <p>Civil rights leaders in the 1960's realized that such rights are exercised in the public arena, not in a voucher-financed retreat from it. Many of the people who now claim to care where poor children go to school used to tell us that welfare ''robbed'' the poor of their self-respect and initiative. What is a voucher, if not a food stamp for schooling?</p>
        <p>If vouchers were widely available, tuition costs at private schools would increase commensurately, as fast as medical premiums in recent years. Private schools know to the dime how much their clients can afford; their exclusivity, their primary appeal, is based on it.</p>
        <p>The will to succeed in any family is far more important than any voucher-financed change in venue or school program.</p>
