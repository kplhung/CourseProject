        <p>A showdown is shaping up within the dominant Protestant political party that could lead to the ouster of its longtime leader, David Trimble, and an end to the power-sharing government at the heart of Northern Ireland's peace accord.</p>

        <p>A showdown is shaping up within the dominant Protestant political party that could lead to the ouster of its longtime leader, David Trimble, and an end to the power-sharing government at the heart of Northern Ireland's peace accord.</p>
        <p>''This is more serious than it's ever been,'' Paul Bew, professor of Irish history at Queens University, said of the struggle to salvage the 1998 accord. ''Can the agreement be lost over the next few weeks? The answer sadly is yes, it's more likely to be lost than be saved.''</p>
        <p>The failure of the I.R.A. to begin disarming remains a principal complaint of disaffected members of the party, the Ulster Unionists, and a dispute over what the new police force for the province will look like and what it will be named has now assumed equal sticking-point status.</p>
        <p>Fresh electoral politics have added to the current pressures. The Ulster Unionists lost a seat in the British Parliament in a by-election last month to the hard-line Democratic Unionist party of the Rev. Ian Paisley, and they are anxious about losing additional ones in the election that Prime Minister Tony Blair is expected to call in May.</p>
        <p>In a series of votes in the party's ruling council in the last year, Mr. Trimble's support has been gradually ebbing, and now he faces a likely threat by the only rival thought capable of unseating him, Jeffrey Donaldson.</p>
        <p>An opponent of the 1998 peace agreement, Mr. Donaldson is putting out word that his seat and others in Parliament are in danger of being lost to Mr. Paisley's party unless the Ulster Unionists withdraw from the Northern Ireland Assembly, the centerpiece of the accord.</p>
        <p>''Donaldson's being able to play on the fear of electoral meltdown has given him the legs to make a challenge,'' Mr. Bew said.</p>
        <p>Since the home rule legislature was structured to function on a Catholic-Protestant power-sharing model, the departure of the largest Protestant party would bring it to an end. That in turn would most likely lead to a restoration of direct rule from London, an outcome that has become increasingly palatable to the pro-British Protestants.</p>
        <p>Their politicians long exercised unchallenged power in Ulster and have not fully embraced the notion that formally sharing authority with Catholics would produce a more stable society.</p>
        <p>''This has produced a mindset in which almost any move toward equality can be interpreted as yet another Protestant loss and another Catholic victory,'' said David McKittrick, author of ''Lost Lives,'' a book of personal histories of the victims of sectarian violence.</p>
        <p>Mr. Trimble's leadership test comes on Oct. 28 when the party's 800-member council holds an emergency meeting here to discuss its options. He has become tougher with party members in the last year as they have increased pressure on him to abandon the peace agreement.</p>
        <p>''Trimble has come out fighting; he's up for this,'' Mr. Bew said. ''Even though support for the agreement is down to 40 percent among Protestants, Trimble himself is vastly more popular.''</p>
        <p>Richard English, professor of politics at Queens, said he saw the coming vote as the ''final decider.''</p>
        <p>''Advocates of both sides in the party talk about it in boxing terms,'' he said. ''They want a knockout this time. This is the decisive moment, and it's very precarious.''</p>
        <p>The police debate has become so central to communal antagonism between Protestants and Catholics that even if the I.R.A. permitted another confidence-building inspection of its arms stocks in the weeks to come, as is being rumored, it will not have great effect. Cyril Ramaphosa, a former South African union leader, and Martti Ahtisaari, a former Finnish president, have conducted only one inspection since being selected as arms monitors in May.</p>
        <p>In September 1999 an international panel of law enforcement experts under the chairmanship of Chris Patten, the former Hong Kong governor, proposed that the police force reduce its size, shed its politically charged emblems and recruit more Catholics to make it better reflect the citizenry. The population of Ulster is 57 percent Protestant, while the makeup of the Royal Ulster Constabulary is 93 percent Protestant.</p>
        <p>In an example of just how uncomprehending of each other the two communities remain 18 months after the peace accord was adopted, Protestants are insisting on the retention of the designation R.U.C., three letters that are so reviled in Catholic neighborhoods that it would be unthinkable that Catholics would join a force known by them.</p>
        <p>A bill about to be taken up in the House of Lords and due for passage in the House of Commons by the end of the year proposes the name ''the Police Service of Northern Ireland, incorporating the RUC.'' The British government has said this minimal mention would honor the 303 officers killed and thousands others injured, mainly by the I.R.A. Catholics say it is too much of a concession to the Protestants; Protestants say it is not enough of one.</p>
        <p>Brendan O'Leary, professor of political science at the London School of Economics, said Britain had already watered down the Patten recommendations in ways that made the proposed legislation unacceptable to Catholics. ''They have tampered with it and played infantile compromise politics,'' he said. ''Patten was the compromise.'' He said the continuing Protestant demands were simply efforts to renegotiate the original agreement.</p>
        <p>Ireland, which with Britain is a co-sponsor of the agreement, has balked at giving in to the Ulster Unionist complaints despite pleas from Peter Mandelson, Britain's Northern Ireland secretary, that the stakes are perilously high.</p>
        <p>''Unless we go some way to assist David Trimble,'' he told the Dublin government last week, ''we won't have the Unionists, and in that case we won't have the Good Friday agreement, and that spells disaster for everyone in Northern Ireland.''</p>
        <p>Violence is an ever-present threat in Northern Ireland, but even those people most pessimistic about the future of the peace accord do not believe that its collapse would necessarily bring back the kind of systematic mayhem that convulsed the province for three decades and led to the deaths of more than 3,600 people.</p>
        <p>''Nobody wants it from either community,'' said Brian Feeney, professor of history at St. Mary's College. ''As far as the I.R.A. is concerned, that's over. What are they going to go to war for? While it was on, you had 'Brits out' and 'unite Ireland,' but now it would have to be 'return our devolved government with power-sharing,' and it's hard to think up a slogan for that one.''</p>
        <p>But even if the mainstream paramilitary groups maintained their cease-fires, Mr. Bew fears that renegade groups would bring back some of the murderous hostility that Ulster hoped it had consigned to history in the euphoric aftermath of the 1998 settlement. ''If not to the level of violence we knew before, it would slide back pretty horribly,'' he said. ''One reason I am very keen indeed that this thing be kept alive is because otherwise things will become very nasty here again.''</p>
