        <p>Medicare, the 35-year-old program that provides elderly Americans basic health coverage, is one of the 20th century's great legislative successes. But the program is not ready for the 21st century.</p>
        <p>Medicare does not cover prescription drugs or limit the amount of money any enrollee is forced to pay out of pocket. It does not, like good private managed care plans, monitor treatment so that enrollees do not take dangerous combinations of drugs or skip diagnostic tests. Medicare is also ill equipped to deal with rising costs. It cannot, like private plans, choose to do business only with hospitals that give steep discounts. Though it offers a semblance of choice -- about 15 percent of enrollees sign up with managed care -- the rules stifle competition from managed care plans, which are not even allowed to cut premiums to attract customers.</p>
        <p>The best proposal for redesigning Medicare comes from the Clinton administration, which improved upon a plan approved by a majority of a bipartisan Congressional commission led by Senator John Breaux, Democrat of Louisiana, and Representative Bill Thomas, Republican of California. Under the commission's plan, the elderly could stay in traditional Medicare or choose a private managed care plan. The government would cover most of the cost of joining an average priced plan -- which might be well below the price of Medicare's traditional fee-for-service coverage. The elderly would pay extra out of pocket for plans costing above the average and receive rebates for joining low-cost plans. Costs would be constrained through competition.</p>
        <p>The commission plan did not, however, guarantee that the elderly would get enough money from the government to allow them to stay in fee-for-service coverage. Mr. Clinton would fix that by pegging the reimbursement to the cost of traditional coverage, thus taking the fear out of reform.</p>
        <p>The important political development is that Mr. Clinton is no longer alone. Senator Breaux, along with Senator Bill Frist, an influential Republican from Tennessee, has adopted his approach.</p>
        <p>Both presidential candidates also agree that Medicare needs an overhaul and appear headed toward roughly similar solutions, except for prescription drugs. However, Mr. Gore's proposals are more generous, and more costly, than Mr. Bush's.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush proposes adding a drug benefit to Medicare, with large subsidies for low-income families and about a 25 percent subsidy for everyone else. He also proposes to cap each enrollee's annual out-of-pocket costs for all Medicare services, including drugs, at $6,000. He has embraced the broad outlines of the commission's original proposal and his advisers say privately that the Breaux-Frist-Clinton revision is consistent with his principles.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore also proposes a drug benefit with large subsidies for low-income families and about a 50 percent subsidy for everyone else. He would limit out-of-pocket drug costs to $4,000 a year, but he has not proposed a cap on non-drug spending. He embraces Mr. Clinton's proposal for overall reform.</p>
        <p>The chief area of disagreement -- and it is a major one -- is the mechanism for delivering drug coverage. Mr. Gore proposes that every enrollee be offered an identical drug benefit. Coverage would be administered by a single private benefits manager in each region. Republicans reject this idea because, they say, it turns health coverage over to a government-created monopoly.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush would first establish an interim plan in which drug coverage would be left to the states for four years, with Washington contributing subsidies to encourage state action. After that, Medicare would involve the private sector in providing drug coverage. Mr. Bush would not create a uniform benefit, nor specify what premiums, co-payments or deductibles the elderly would pay. Every health plan serving Medicare would simply be required to offer drug coverage costing about $800 an enrollee. He would rely on competition to make sure the elderly were offered affordable options. But the Bush subsidies look small, raising fears that many enrollees would find no affordable coverage.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's plan is preferable because benefits would not rely on uncertain action by the states or the private sector. But his approach could be modified to attract Republican support after the election. It could retain a uniform benefit but have the government hire several private managers in each region to administer the benefit and compete for customers. That would replace monopoly with competition as Republicans seek.</p>
        <p>The two sides, despite their opposing campaign rhetoric, are in a position to fix Medicare's problems for a generation or more. The administration that takes power in January can, with political adroitness, forge a consensus to give the elderly a 21st-century health program.</p>
