        <p>With violence raging in the Middle East and lofty oil prices drawing harsh criticism of petroleum companies, it might seem an inopportune time for Chevron and Texaco to announce a merger that opens them to the scrutiny of the federal government and the jittery stock market.</p>
        <p>But the timing has less to do with the high price of oil over the last several months and more to do with the trend toward larger oil concerns that has radically reshaped the industry in the last two years. In fact, the two companies tried to merge more than a year ago but were unable to work out the terms.</p>
        <p>As for the tensions in the oil-rich Middle East, Chevron and Texaco do not have a presence in the region, and so are unaffected by the turmoil there. In fact, some of the largest new oil fields in the world have been discovered far from the Middle East, mainly in the deep waters off Brazil and West Africa and in the Caspian Sea.</p>
        <p>The wide geographical range of the projects and their location below the sea reflect how high the stakes have become in the oil industry. Older fields like those in the United States are drying up, and the number of wells that are easy to drill and operate is winnowing.</p>
        <p>To feed the world's powerful demand for oil, companies in search of the ''elephant fields'' that contain hundreds of millions of barrels of oil must now take on new political and technical perils, from the spasmodic civil war in Angola to the depths of the Caspian. Those conditions, in turn, require oil companies to have far greater revenues than were necessary only a few years ago.</p>
        <p>''What all the oil companies have found out is that as you go deeper and deeper into the offshore projects, that you are a pioneer and, therefore, mistakes will be made,'' said Mehdi Varzi, director of research at Dresdner Kleinwort Benson, an investment bank. ''To exploit those reserves, you need the acreage and you need the money.''</p>
        <p>While Chevron and Texaco already have projects in the waters off West Africa and Brazil, their merger is largely motivated by the need to either pool their assets and expertise or risk being pushed aside by the biggest players in the industry: Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch/Shell and BP Amoco.</p>
        <p>''On a combined basis, especially in exploration and production, we'll really be in a league with those other companies,'' said a senior executive involved in the talks.</p>
        <p>Certainly, when the price of oil hovers above $30 a barrel as it has for much of this year, companies have greater resources for a merger and can use their income to go after sprawling projects. But much of the money companies expect to see from a merger will be in the savings they extract from cutting jobs, jettisoning less-profitable units and streamlining some operations, a process that oil experts say has been going on industrywide, in one form or another, since 1980. In creating a new, unified company, Chevron and Texaco expect to save $1.2 billion annually and to eliminate at least 4,000 jobs, senior executives said.</p>
        <p>''The hidden value in mergers is that you cut people and inventory,'' said Larry Goldstein, president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation. ''Companies have realized that they may not have control over the price of crude oil, but they do have control over costs.''</p>
        <p>Those cuts, in turn, have profoundly changed the main business of oil companies. The market giants now focus much more heavily on exploration and production rather than refining and selling gasoline, which they do primarily through joint ventures. Even now, for example, Texaco-brand gasoline is sold at filling stations in the United States through a joint venture with the Shell Oil Company called Equilon.</p>
        <p>High gasoline prices this summer may have unleashed accusations of profiteering against gas stations and refiners. But oil companies make most of their money at the well-head, where it might cost about $3 to $4 to pump out a barrel of oil that, on the world market, may sell for $35.</p>
        <p>''One of the dynamics happening in the oil industry is that the old vertically integrated structure is breaking down,'' said Dave Wilson, a recently retired partner in energy strategic consulting at PricewaterhouseCoopers. ''There's not so much balance between production and refining any more. The merged companies sold off much of their refining and marketing to joint ventures, because refining and marketing usually perform so poorly.''</p>
        <p>Senior executives involved in the negotiations said that Chevron and Texaco had traditionally placed great emphasis on exploration of new fields, but the merger would make it more economical for them to continue such projects. Most of the $1.2 billion savings from the deal, for example, are expected to come from streamlining projects each company has in the Gulf of Mexico, Nigeria, Angola, Britain and Kazakhstan.</p>
        <p>As with any merger, Chevron and Texaco will be playing up the hand-in-glove way they will fit together as they go about creating a new company. Indeed, the two have worked together for about 65 years through Caltex, a joint venture that sells petroleum products in Asia.</p>
        <p>For all their similarities in strategy, their corporate cultures are said to be quite different. Chevron is considered by some to be buttoned-up and staid, while Texaco is thought of as more free-wheeling.</p>
        <p>But it may be Chevron's culture that prevails. The new corporate headquarters will be in San Francisco, where Chevron is now based, and the combined company's chairman and chief executive will be David J. O'Reilly, now Chevron's chief. Texaco's chief executive, Peter I. Bijur, will become a vice chairman, with few operational duties.</p>
        <p>''I don't expect there to be much of a corporate clash,'' one analyst said. ''I think Chevron will be the surviving company and Peter Bijur and the others will be happy to take their money and sit on the board.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  October 25, 2000, Wednesday  Articles on Oct. 14 and 16 and a front-page chart on Oct. 16 about the acquisition of Texaco Inc. by the Chevron Corporation misstated the total 1999 revenue for the companies. Including their Caltex joint venture, which sells petroleum products in Asia, the combined revenue for the companies was $85 billion, not $66.5 billion.</p>
