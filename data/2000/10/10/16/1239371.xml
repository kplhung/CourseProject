        <p>Clinton Heads for Mideast With More Modest Goals  President Clinton will arrive in Egypt for a Middle East summit meeting to try to quell the violence that has left more than 100 people dead. The White House fears that the violence could spill across the region. Mr.Clinton is no longer playing the role of triumphant peacemaker that he had hoped for a month ago.</p>

        <p>Members of Hezbollah, the Shiite Muslim guerrilla group that has long battled Israel in southern Lebanon, announced that it had captured an Israeli Army colonel and appeared to indicate that he was an intelligence operative. Israel denied it.</p>
        <p>A15</p>
        <p>Both Israelis and Palestinians braced for more violence, though there were few more actual clashes, and neither side could muster much hope that summit talks could yield more than a shaky truce.</p>

        <p>France has stepped up security measures around many synagogues in Paris and other cities. More than 30 anti-Semitic acts have been reported in France in the last two weeks.</p>

        <p>Destroyer Bulkhead Collapses  The collapse of an underwater bulkhead on board the destroyer Cole sent tons of water flooding into parts of the ship. An explosion on Thursday ripped a hole in the ship's side, killing 17 sailors.</p>

        <p>The Pentagon suspended all naval refueling operations in Yemen until officials determine whether lax security in the port at Aden left the ship vulnerable to attack.</p>

        <p>Ulster Pact Threatened  A showdown is shaping up within Northern Ireland's dominant Protestant Ulster Unionist party that could lead to the ouster of its longtime leader, David Trimble, and an end to the power-sharing government at the heart of the peace accord.</p>

        <p>A Suspect Election in Belarus  Aleksandr Lukashenko, the autocratic president of Belarus, all but mocked his critics as he voted in a parliamentary election called meaningless by the United States and other Western nations. Belarus's small democratic opposition has boycotted the election as a sham.</p>

        <p>Talks Stymied in Peru  Talks between the government and the opposition to reset Peru on a democratic course have broken off over accusations that allies of President Alberto K. Fujimori have backed away from promises to conclude a Congressional session and set a new date for presidential elections.</p>

        <p>Vote Crucial to Mexican Party  After a race marred by charges of vote-buying and unethical control of the news media, the long-governing Institutional Revolutionary Party in Mexico faced yet another serious challenge in elections in Tabasco state. The party was hoping that its candidate for governor would win, and the current governor was hoping that a victory would let him take charge of the party.</p>

        <p>Democrats Cling to Hope For a Senate Majority  Democrats are likely to pick up at least a seat or two in the Senate in next month's elections and have an outside chance of winning a narrow majority, handicappers say. Whichever party ends up in control, its majority is likely to be the narrowest in more than 40 years, making the passage of major legislation in areas like Social Security, taxes and health care even more difficult. A 50-50 split is also possible, in which case the next vice president could cast tie-breaking votes.</p>

        <p>Gov. George W. Bush plans to send the nation's 28 Republican governors on a three-day campaign swing to hotly contested states. He will also deploy a team of women -- political wives and advisers -- and Senator John McCain of Arizona to woo swing voters.</p>
        <p>A24</p>
        <p>Three Texas state legislators, all Democrats, said Mr. Bush had exaggerated state spending on health care for uninsured people in Texas, taking credit for large amounts of charity care provided by private doctors and hospitals. The Bush campaign rejected the criticism.</p>
        <p>A27</p>
        <p>A review of Mr. Bush's daily schedules, correspondence and other documents underscores that as governor he has devoted himself remarkably little to policy details and instead spent most of his time wooing legislators, the public and the news media. Yet this may have made him more effective as governor, not less.</p>

        <p>Texas Death Penalty Criticized  A new report concludes that Texas' death penalty system is in dire need of changes because of problems like misconduct by prosecutors, racial bias, phony experts and inadequate lawyers for poor defendants. The report was written by the Texas Defender Service, a nonprofit group that represents death row inmates and has often been critical of the state's capital system. It follows another critical study, presented by a committee of the State Bar of Texas, that described the state's system of providing legal representation to the poor as ''a national embarrassment.''</p>

        <p>March for Families Set  Family caravans streamed into Washington, D.C., for a day of ''atonement, reconciliation and responsibility'' today, proclaimed by Louis Farrakhan, the Nation of Islam leader. He has invited marchers from all races and religions to create a ''Million Family March'' to bolster family life, which he has been warning is eroding in America.</p>

        <p>State Officials Investigate 2 Fund-Raisers' Conduct  Joseph Goldberger and Joseph Menczer became V.I.P.'s by helping to raise about $500,000 in 1994 for George E. Pataki's race for governor in New York. Later, they peppered state agencies with requests, implying that they represented a Hasidic group in Brooklyn. But a unit of the state attorney general's office and the state inspector general are now investigating whether the two men crossed the line from uncommon access to improper influence.</p>

        <p>G.O.P. Concerns About Lazio  The campaign of Representative Rick A. Lazio, the Republican nominee for the Senate in New York, is described by his own supporters as adrift and unfocused. There is growing evidence that Mr. Lazio is paying for some of his early tactical calculations.</p>

        <p>Deal for Times Square Tower  Arthur Andersen, the giant accounting firm, has signed a lease with Boston Properties that would enable the developer to build a 47-story, $600 million skyscraper at the south end of Times Square.</p>

        <p>Teaching Jobs Rejected  More than 1,200 newly certified teachers have turned down jobs in New York City this fall because of a court order that would have forced them to work in the city's lowest-performing schools, according to the schools chancellor.</p>

        <p>Chevron to Buy Texaco  Chevron has agreed to buy Texaco for $36 billion in stock, creating the world's fourth-largest oil concern. The companies' boards approved the deal, which is expected to be announced today. The deal is likely to come under scrutiny by regulators.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>The timing of the Chevron-Texaco deal has less to do with the high price of oil and more to do with the trend toward larger oil concerns that has radically reshaped the industry in the last two years.</p>

        <p>Judge Lets EBay Suit Continue  A California judge has allowed six people to proceed with a lawsuit that strikes at the core of how eBay runs its business. The lawsuit contends that eBay has a responsibility to ensure the authenticity of the sports memorabilia sold on its site. EBay says it merely operates a venue for sales and cannot be held liable for fake goods.</p>
