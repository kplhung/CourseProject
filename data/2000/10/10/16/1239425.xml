        <p>Rodriguez becomes a free agent after the Mariners' last game, and he reportedly will seek a contract worth $20 million a season. That would most likely send him to a large-market team.

        <p>Alex Rodriguez and Lou Piniella have offered few clues this postseason as to what they will do after this year, but the Seattle Mariners could soon be looking for a new shortstop and a new manager.</p>
        <p>Rodriguez becomes a free agent after the Mariners' last game, and he reportedly will seek a contract worth $20 million a season. That would most likely send him to a large-market team. Piniella's managerial contract expires at the end of October, and he intends to meet with General Manager Pat Gillick and the team's ownership group sometime in the next two weeks.</p>
        <p>''That's been understood all along,'' said Piniella, who in eight seasons has twice guided the Mariners to the American League Championship Series. Before joining the Mariners, Piniella managed the Yankees in 1986-88 and the Cincinnati Reds in 1990-92, winning the World Series in 1990.</p>
        <p>''This has been a wonderful place to work,'' Piniella said. ''It's a great city. As a baseball team, it is on the upswing. Our ownership group here doesn't want to make any money. They are wealthy enough. All they want to do is put a good product on the field and be in a competitive situation year in and year out.</p>
        <p>''It's been fun, it really has. I've learned a lot more about managing in this town than anywhere else. We'll just have to see what happens with my situation. I've had a lot of wonderful players.''</p>
