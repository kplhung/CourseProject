        <p>Setting an urgent goal of a truce between Israelis and Palestinians, President Clinton headed today for a Middle East summit meeting in Egypt that aides described as potentially the most difficult of his presidency.</p>
        <p>Instead of playing the role of triumphant peacemaker that he had hoped for just a month ago, Mr. Clinton will arrive in Egypt trying to quell the violence that has left more than 100 people dead and that the White House fears could spill trouble across the region.</p>
        <p>Officials rated his chances of success as ''fair'' and suggested that they were prepared for threats of walkouts by both Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel and the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat. But they said the consequences of failure were so high -- not only for Israel and the Palestinians, but also for the moderate Arab nations whose leaders will be in attendance -- that fear of wider conflict might force reason to prevail.</p>
        <p>''If this fails it may blow up the whole region,'' said one official.</p>
        <p>The summit meeting, formally co-chaired by the Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, and Mr. Clinton, will also be attended by United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan as well as King Abdullah of Jordan and -- at Palestinian insistence -- the European Union's top diplomat, Javier Solana.</p>
        <p>The first order of business will be to try to find a way to restore calm between the two sides. But in attempting that, administration officials said, Mr. Clinton will be dealing with two angry and aggrieved leaders in Mr. Barak and Mr. Arafat.</p>
        <p>Much like his attendance at the Camp David meeting in July, the Palestinian leader appeared to be going only reluctantly, agreeing to the summit meeting on Saturday morning after two days of pleading by Mr. Clinton, Mr. Annan and Mr. Mubarak. For a good amount of that time, Mr. Arafat would not return phone calls from Mr. Mubarak, officials said.</p>
        <p>The Middle East had never been so tense or dangerous during the Clinton presidency, an administration official said, adding that the potential for the current conflict to ripple beyond Israel and the Palestinian territories was very high.</p>
        <p>The region was on a hair trigger, the official said. American officials have been saying for several days that the Iraqi leader, Saddam Hussein, has deployed a division of troops into western Iraq, near Jordan, apparently in a move intended to unnerve the summit meeting.</p>
        <p>For Mr. Clinton, personally, who spoke at a fund-raising event in the United States on Saturday night of his severe disappointment over the situation in the Middle East, the summit meeting presents the difficult challenge of salvaging seven and a half years of peacemaking.</p>
        <p>A senior administration official said Mr. Clinton hoped to restore some ''equilibrium'' between the Palestinians and Israelis, especially before a scheduled meeting of the Arab League in Cairo on Saturday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Arafat was believed to have wanted to defer talks with Mr. Barak until after that gathering, the first by Arab heads of state in a decade, where he would be looking for a  heady confirmation of his grievances against the Israelis.</p>
        <p>But Egypt, as one of only two Arab states along with Jordan to make peace with Israel, is equally anxious about that gathering, which will be attended by representatives of radical Arab states, possibly including a senior lieutenant of Mr. Hussein.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mubarak initially turned down the idea of an emergency summit meeting when it was proposed by Mr. Clinton last weekend, officials said. But the Egyptian leader did an about-face on Thursday after a Palestinian mob killed two Israeli solidiers and Israel retaliated with strikes by helicopter gunships.</p>
        <p>That dangerous escalation of the conflict and the specter of even greater violence on the eve of the Arab League meeting, officials said, had persuaded Mr. Mubarak to go ahead with the emergency meeting on Monday at the Red Sea resort of Sharm el Sheik.</p>
        <p>With the Monday meeting, Mr. Mubarak will be seeking to re-establish a ''foundation'' of Arab opinion before an Arab League gathering where views may be polarized, a senior administration official said. An Arab diplomat said Mr. Mubarak would tell Mr. Arafat that it is now time ''to bite the bullet.''</p>
        <p>This sudden common commitment on the part of the United States and Egypt is one factor working in favor of a possible positive outcome, officials said, and the Egyptian president may play an important role in helping persuade Mr. Arafat that he must listen to Mr. Clinton for the peace effort to survive.</p>
        <p>In addition, Mr. Mubarak's public commitment to the talks and the venue of the largest Arab state could provide Mr. Arafat with the political cover needed for a compromise.</p>
        <p>Publicly, the Clinton administration has laid out three goals for the meeting. The first would be establishing a truce and the practical solutions for keeping it. The second would be setting up an inquiry -- whose composition would be acceptable to both sides -- for looking into the causes of the current explosion of violence, which began after a visit by Ariel Sharon, a right-wing Israeli opposition leader, on Sept. 28 to the plaza outside two Muslim holy sites in the Old City of Jerusalem. And the third would be suggesting a path, though not an exact timetable, for returning to the negotiating table.</p>
        <p>The administration expects Mr. Arafat to demand that the Israeli military pull back and open the passageways between the Palestinian territories and Israel. Mr. Clinton told Mr. Arafat that he would deal with those details at the summit meeting, not before, officials said.</p>
        <p>The Israelis, officials said, are expected to demand a public renunciation of violence by Mr. Arafat, whom they blame for failing to rein in the Palestinian rioting.</p>
        <p>The goal of an inquiry, which Mr. Arafat sees as vital, will be particularly difficult.</p>
        <p>The Palestinians want an international fact-finding commission with a heavy role for the United Nations. The Israelis prefer an American proposal for the United States to share a commission that would oversee individual inquiries by both sides.</p>
        <p>Some face-saving formula involving the Americans and Norway is being worked on, officials said.  ''There is no interest on our side to internationalize this,'' an American official said.</p>
        <p>Administration officials said they were ''realistic'' enough not to expect a peace conference to be reconvened for the rest of Mr. Clinton's presidency. ''We don't expect it to be a breakthrough to the peace process,'' an administration official said.</p>
