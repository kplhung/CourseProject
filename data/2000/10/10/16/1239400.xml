        <p>Although there were few actual clashes today, Israelis braced for Palestinian terror attacks, Palestinians were alarmed by Israeli warnings of fierce reprisals against any more mob violence, and neither side could muster much hope that the summit meeting in Egypt on Monday could yield more than a shaky truce.</p>
        <p>''Barak and Arafat are just going there to sign a piece of paper, and that is all,'' said Ghassan Abdeen, a Palestinian merchant, as he commiserated with a Jewish friend, Sara Heckelman, in his otherwise empty Jerusalem souvenir shop. ''But if they don't sign something, the whole region will be at war.'' Ms. Heckelman dispiritedly agreed. ''This has got to stop,'' she said.</p>

        <p>Although there were few actual clashes today, Israelis braced for Palestinian terror attacks, Palestinians were alarmed by Israeli warnings of fierce reprisals against any more mob violence, and neither side could muster much hope that the summit meeting in Egypt on Monday could yield more than a shaky truce.</p>
        <p>''Barak and Arafat are just going there to sign a piece of paper, and that is all,'' said Ghassan Abdeen, a Palestinian merchant, as he commiserated with a Jewish friend, Sara Heckelman, in his otherwise empty Jerusalem souvenir shop. ''But if they don't sign something, the whole region will be at war.'' Ms. Heckelman dispiritedly agreed. ''This has got to stop,'' she said.</p>
        <p>As they spoke, the Israeli military was digging trenches and installing barricades across once-heavily traveled crossing points between Israel and areas under Palestinian Authority control. With few exceptions, Palestinians were refused permission to enter Israel, while most Israelis who wished to enter Palestinian areas were turned back by Israeli security.</p>
        <p>''To get into the Palestinian side from the Israeli side is difficult, but possible,'' said Anton Mourah, a clerk at a Bethlehem hotel near a newly reinforced Israeli checkpoint.  ''To get into the Israeli side from the Palestinian side is a miracle.''</p>
        <p>Throughout Israel, the police were placed on high alert in anticipation of possible terrorist attacks, a warning Israeli officials said was prompted by the release from Palestinian jails in the last two weeks of scores of imprisoned members of the radical fundamentalist Hamas and Islamic Jihad movements. Reports of the abduction in Europe by Hezbollah guerrillas of an Israeli reserve officer further heightened tension.</p>
        <p>In West Jerusalem, normally bustling during the first days of this Sukkot holiday week, malls and shopping districts were nearly deserted today, and often-perfunctory security checks at movie theaters and department stories were carried out with deadly seriousness.</p>
        <p>But by late evening there had been no reports of any terror incidents, and clashes between Israeli forces and Palestinian protesters were limited to brief exchanges of stones and rubber-coated steel bullets, with no critical injuries.</p>
        <p>Prime Minister Ehud Barak and President Clinton concurred in a conversation today that ''there would be no preconditions'' for the summit meeting, according to Mr. Barak's office. But there were indications that that the two sides were trying to defuse tensions before the meeting.</p>
        <p>Palestinian officials and spokesmen for Hamas both reported that more than 30 Hamas members had been taken into custody by the Palestinian Authority in the last two days, a move that was widely interpreted as a gesture toward Israeli and American demands for tighter controls on armed Palestinian militants.</p>
        <p>The Israeli Army had warned in recent days that it would respond with greater force to further attacks from Palestinian snipers and rioters. Israeli military correspondents reported that the army had authorized  the use of live ammunition against rock-throwing protesters.</p>
        <p>But Gen. Shaul Mofaz, the Israeli Army chief of staff, said today that his forces were under orders to exercise extreme restraint in their confrontations with Palestinians.</p>
        <p>Still, he expressed skepticism that the meeting in Egypt would resolve the underlying causes of the recent outbreak of violence, warning that ''the army has to prepare itself for long-term confrontation as long as is necessary.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak today reiterated his intention to invite the Likud Party leader, Ariel Sharon, into a new ''national emergency'' government, a move that has infuriated Palestinians. Mr. Sharon has been blamed for detonating the recent outbreak of  violence with his visit two and a half weeks ago to the steps of Jerusalem's ancient mosques, a site over which Israel claims sovereignty but where Islamic clerics have long exercised effective control.</p>
        <p>Bringing Mr. Sharon into the government would be tantamount to suspending peace talks, many Palestinians and leftist Israelis say, a perception the Likud leader reinforced by vowing to ''bring down the government'' if Mr. Barak engaged in any substantive negotiations in Egypt.</p>
