        <p>GLENDON RUSCH essentially became Bobby J. Jones's stand-in last night, emerging stage left, about where he left off in June. This time in relief, and saving what might have been a shuddering experience for Mets fandom.</p>
        <p>It was Jones, through ineffectiveness, who relinquished his spot in the starting rotation while Rusch flourished. It was Jones who made a valiant recovery, finishing the season strong and then beating the San Francisco Giants with a one-hit shutout last Sunday -- there was a question of whether Rusch would get the start -- to clinch the division title. That was a performance that ranked with just about anything Tom Seaver or Walter Johnson or even Nuke Laloosh, that Bull from Durham, ever achieved.</p>
        <p>When the dust cleared last night, the Mets had beaten the St. Louis Cardinals, 10-6, to go up by three games to one in their four-of-seven-game National League Championship Series, with a possible deciding game tonight in Shea Stadium.</p>
        <p>But, in the end, little thanks to Jones. He gave up two runs in the first inning. Was given a 4-2 lead after one inning, 7-2 after two. But by the fifth, Jones was being slugged with impunity. Rusch arrived in the nick of time and retired the Redbirds, but the score stood at 8-6.</p>
        <p>But if the Mets are to continue this season, it is conceivable that Bobby J. Jones will yet play a significant role. He has demonstrated that he has the capacity to reconstruct himself.</p>
        <p>''Everyone earlier this season,'' John Franco recalled about Jones, ''had him on the next ticket out of town.''</p>
        <p>That ticket was not to that empyrean place known as the playoffs, but one-way to Oblivion, or, in this case, Norfolk, Va.</p>
        <p>Unable to prevent the multitudes from reaping base hits off his savory offerings, Jones, a veteran of eight major league seasons -- all of them with the Mets -- accepted an assignment to their Class AAA club last June 13. Could Jones, at age 30, be finished?</p>
        <p>He had missed most of the 1999 season with bursitis and a strain of his pitching shoulder and had been unavailable for the playoffs then. Though no longer troubled with those ailments this season, Jones strained his right calf muscle in April and was put on the disabled list. When he returned to action, he was cuffed around like a rag doll, running up a 1-3 record with an embarrassing 10.19 earned run average in eight starts.</p>
        <p>After his four starts at Norfolk, however, having performed well, he was back wearing Mets haberdashery. In some respects, he was a changed man.</p>
        <p>In sports, the dramatic virtues are as clearly circumscribed as the pitcher's mound. Jones exemplifies this to a marked degree. With what some assumed to be the beginning of the end of his career -- a career with such highlights as making the N.L. All-Star team in 1997 -- he was suddenly the toast of the town. It was Willy Loman picking up a big new account, Hamlet no longer confused, Harpo garrulous. Or the park statue come to life.</p>
        <p>''What I never could understand about Bobby is how he stays so stone-faced,'' Al Leiter, another Mets starter, said. ''He never showed any emotion. He was like a robot. So different from me. I'm all wound up. I'm like a psycho.''</p>
        <p>But, Leiter added, when Jones returned from his minor league sabbatical in Virginia, he detected something new. ''It was a look, a sense of things on the mound, like, 'I'm going to get you,' '' Leiter said. ''More aggressive. No matter what he did on the mound before, it was always the same look, whether he struck out a guy or a guy hit a home run off him. Nothing. But recently I saw a little pump of the fist when he got a guy. I'm on the bench, and it's: 'Hey, did you see that? Did you see what Bobby did?' ''</p>
        <p>Manager Bobby Valentine saw it from a somewhat different angle. ''It was a matter of mechanics,'' Valentine said. ''He was going slower into his windup, and that seemed to be taking something off his form. And then when he was losing effectiveness, he began thinking too much, which can hamper his delivery.''</p>
        <p>Jones responded when he returned to the Mets with an overall 11-6 record for the season, and lowered his E.R.A. to a more respectable 5.06.</p>
        <p>Jones is a big right-hander, at 6 feet 4 inches and 225 pounds, but he's not a power pitcher. ''He's the kind of pitcher who wants you to get yourself out,'' Fernando Vina, the Cardinals' second baseman, said. ''He's going to hit the corners of the plate on you, he's going to throw a fastball that looks fast only because his curveball is slow. But he's got great control. What you hope to do is try to get a good pitch to hit, be patient and don't go up there whaling at the ball.''</p>
        <p>True to his word, Vina, the first batter in the game, doubled off Jones. It was an omen.</p>
        <p>But while the Cardinals eventually dispatched Jones, they couldn't reach Rusch -- who pitched three innings -- or, his relief, Franco and closer Armando Benitez, for even one run.</p>
        <p>Even on Jones's stone face, there had to be, at the conclusion, a hint of a smile.</p>
