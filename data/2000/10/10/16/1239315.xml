        <p>The question has long been served on the canape trays circulating in Washington cocktail parties and journalistic confabulations: when will Charles Peters, founder of The Washington Monthly and neoliberal godfather to legions of journalists, retire from his position as editor in chief -- and grandfatherly but cranky mentor?</p>
        <p>Mr. Peters, who founded the magazine in 1969 and has edited it since, is stepping down in January. The new editor will be Paul D. Glastris, a speechwriter in the Clinton White House and a former correspondent and editor for U.S. News &amp; World Report, Mr. Peters said. He added that time alone, not ideological fatigue, had forced his hand.</p>

        <p>The question has long been served on the canape trays circulating in Washington cocktail parties and journalistic confabulations: when will Charles Peters, founder of The Washington Monthly and neoliberal godfather to legions of journalists, retire from his position as editor in chief -- and grandfatherly but cranky mentor?</p>
        <p>Mr. Peters, who founded the magazine in 1969 and has edited it since, is stepping down in January. The new editor will be Paul D. Glastris, a speechwriter in the Clinton White House and a former correspondent and editor for U.S. News &amp; World Report, Mr. Peters said. He added that time alone, not ideological fatigue, had forced his hand.</p>
        <p>''I am going to be 74 years old in December, and as much as you hate to face it, you have to make sensible provisions for an institution you love,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The Washington Monthly has been considered a proving ground for a certain type of political minded and ambitious young journalist. When he founded the magazine, Mr. Peters, who had just finished seven years in the Peace Corps, instituted a program that called for young writers to work for positively puny wages. Their reward: the chance to write for a political magazine with a small circulation (now about 21,000) but considerable influence.</p>
        <p>''We basically invited them in and then killed them for two years for absolutely no money,'' Mr. Peters said. Alumni include Taylor Branch, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author; James Fallows; Michael Kinsley; Gregg Easterbrook of The New Republic; Suzannah Lessard of The New Yorker; Jonathan Alter and Jon Meacham of Newsweek; and several reporters for The New York Times.</p>
        <p>The annual salary is still $12,000, Mr. Peters said, a level it has hovered at for about a decade. ''We started out with regular salaries but quickly realized that The Monthly would never be able to survive,'' Mr. Peters said. ''So I decided to apply the Peace Corps principle.''</p>
        <p>Nicholas Lemann, a writer for The New Yorker and an alumnus, is also involved in the post-Peters Washington Monthly. He has overseen the magazine's application to the Internal Revenue Service to transform itself into a nonprofit organization; if it was successful, Mr. Lemann would act as chairman of a board of directors while continuing to write for The New Yorker. Mr. Lemann said that once the new status was in place, he would approach foundations for grants. (Currently, Mr. Peters owns the controlling stock in The Washington Monthly; other investors include the billionaire Warren E. Buffett and Senator John D. Rockefeller IV, Democrat of West Virginia.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Glastris, who is 41, said he had no plan to change the magazine. ''I call The Monthly solution-oriented journalism,'' Mr. Glastris said. ''Reporters are relentless seekers-out of problems. And they will turn over every stone and shake down every source to find out what the next problem is. But the spirit of The Monthly has always been to use those same talents to seek out potential solutions. And I sort of think it is pretty darn good as it is.''</p>
