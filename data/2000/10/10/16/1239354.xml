        <p>As soon as Jason Sehorn went out, Emmanuel McDaniel knew he was in at right cornerback and Reggie Stephens knew he would be the nickel back.</p>
        <p>Emmanuel who? Reggie who?</p>
        <p>Until Jason Sehorn went for X-rays of a fractured rib under his right collarbone after his interception on the first play from scrimmage, not many Giants Stadium parishioners knew much, if anything, about Emmanuel McDaniel or Reggie Stephens.</p>
        <p>But as the Giants squeaked past the Dallas Cowboys, 19-14, those two new defensive backs helped keep Troy Aikman at bay in the final minutes yesterday.</p>
        <p>''John Fox didn't change anything,'' strong safety Sam Garnes said later, referring to the Giants' defensive coordinator. ''He believed in the guys coming in.''</p>
        <p>And they believed in themselves. E-Mac, as his Giant teammates call McDaniel, has been around. As a fourth-round draft choice out of East Carolina, he had been waived by the Carolina Panthers, the Indianapolis Colts and the Miami Dolphins before the Giants signed him a year ago. Stephens, out of Rutgers, was signed to the Giants' practice squad last season.</p>
        <p>But yesterday, the two 5-foot-9-inch defensive backs jumped out of the small print of the depth charts and turned into Giants. And for the two, three or more weeks that Sehorn is unavailable, they will stay out there.</p>
        <p>''As soon as we knew Jason was hurt,'' Garnes said, ''I told E-Mac: 'I know you can cover as good as anybody in this league. Just go do it.' Coming out of the huddle, about all I had to do was remind them of stuff like, 'Roll up, roll back, or short and flat.' I didn't want to talk to them too much. I didn't want to make them nervous.''</p>
        <p>In his 12 Cowboy seasons, Troy Aikman had never before thrown five interceptions in a game.</p>
        <p>''But he was still Troy Aikman out there,'' Garnes said. ''He still had a star on his helmet.''</p>
        <p>But that star had been scraped and scuffed. On consecutive plays just before halftime, McDaniel sacked him for a 10-yard loss and Stephens intercepted him at the goal line.</p>
        <p>''The ball was in the air,'' Stephens said. ''I thought I was beat. I just dove out with my 5-9 body -- make a play or get beat. I made a play.''</p>
        <p>With Sehorn out, the Cowboy offense had hoped to take advantage of the Giants' two inexperienced defensive backs. But on those two consecutive plays, the sack and the interception had blunted the Cowboys' opportunity for a field goal, if not a touchdown.</p>
        <p>''Great job,'' Stephens told McDaniel after the sack. ''A little guy got a big guy.''</p>
        <p>McDaniel had impressed Coach Jim Fassel the week before in the victory in Atlanta.</p>
        <p>''I really wasn't worried about E-Mac out there,'' Fassel said. ''The reason he made this team, the reason he's playing, is mental toughness. He steps into situations and he's going to battle you. Last week he got a hip pointer; most guys would be out of the game, but he went right back in the game. You know it had to be painful, but he's tough and he stepped up.''</p>
        <p>McDaniel and Stephens not only are roommates on Giant road trips, they also share a Hackensack apartment.</p>
        <p>''I'm from Louisiana and I played junior-college football in California before going to Rutgers,'' Stephens said. ''I'm a traveler. I've played every position -- quarterback, running back, wide receiver, safety, corner, punt returns, kickoff returns. And now I'm playing defensive back at the N.F.L. level.''</p>
        <p>When Sehorn returned to the bench after X-rays, he didn't try to advise McDaniel or Stephens.</p>
        <p>''E-Mac is a 5-9 guy; he's not going to do things the way I do,'' the 6-2 Sehorn said. ''I just wanted to see them play well and they did. When you can't play, the last thing you want to see is someone else not play well.</p>
        <p>''E-Mac took some undeserved heat earlier this year, but he played awesome against the Cowboys. It's nice to have someone backing you up.''</p>
        <p>The victory enabled the Giants, now 5-2 and still tied with the Washington Redskins for first place in the National Football Conference East, to enjoy their bye week before resuming the season against the Philadelphia Eagles at Giants Stadium a week from Sunday. But the Giants don't deserve to take themselves too seriously as a first-place team.</p>
        <p>''Five picks,'' Fassel said, ''usually add up to the Giants winning.''</p>
        <p>But with those five interceptions, the Giants should have won much more decisively than they did against a Cowboys team that is now only 2-4, even with a quarterback who still has a star on his helmet. Two new defensive backs helped hold the fort yesterday, but look for the Eagles' Donovan McNabb to test McDaniel and Stephens even more than the Cowboys did.</p>
