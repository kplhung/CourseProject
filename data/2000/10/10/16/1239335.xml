        <p>Talks between the government and the opposition to reset Peru on a democratic course have broken off over accusations that allies of President Alberto K. Fujimori have backed away from promises to conclude a Congressional session and set a new date for presidential elections.</p>
        <p>The negotiations, sponsored by the Organization of American States, began soon after Mr. Fujimori announced last month that he would cut short his presidential term after a videotape showing his intelligence chief apparently paying a legislator a $15,000 bribe was shown on a cable television station.</p>
        <p>The talks had appeared to be going well, with both sides expressing  hopes that an independent judiciary, news media and election apparatus would emerge in time for elections in the next few months. The negotiators  agreed two weeks ago that the current Congressional session would end today and that a presidential election date would also be announced.</p>
        <p>But Eduardo Latorre, a former Dominican Republic foreign minister and the O.A.S. mediator here, suspended the talks on Friday, just after allies of Mr. Fujimori in Congress voted to lengthen the legislative session until Oct. 31 without first going to the organization or the opposition to explain the decision.</p>
        <p>Opposition representatives expressed bitterness at the change, saying they fear that the government might use the extension to postpone  new elections, set election rules that would hamper the opposition or pardon the military and security forces for human rights violations. The leaders contended that they saw the hidden hand of Vladimiro Montesinos, the former intelligence chief, who is seeking asylum in Panama but who has continued regular telephone communication with Mr. Fujimori and other officials since he fled Peru last month.</p>
        <p>Alejandro Toledo, who ran against Mr. Fujimori for the presidency in the April and May elections, said Saturday that the opposition would restart mass street protests on Tuesday to pressure the government to negotiate in good faith. ''Vladimiro Montesinos continues manipulating and making decisions about the future of Peru from afar,'' he charged.</p>
        <p>Absalon Vasquez Villanueva, a leader of Mr. Fujimori's forces in Congress, said the government had no intention of stalling on the elections. ''We must continue working so that next July 28 a new president elected in transparent elections assumes power,'' Mr. Vasquez said.</p>
        <p>In the midst of the new political turmoil, Mr. Fujimori canceled a trip to the United States and Venezuela.</p>
        <p>There were signs last week that the government forces in Congress were retaking the initiative. The Congress speaker, Martha Hildebrandt,  one of Mr. Fujimori's close allies, beat back a censure vote on Friday, 60 to 56, that would have removed her from power. Opposition leaders accused Mr. Montesinos of using blackmail and extortion to manipulate the vote.</p>
        <p>In another sign of government strength, a Congressional subcommittee voted Friday to shelve an investigation into Congressman Alberto Kouri, who was videotaped taking the money from Mr. Montesinos, ostensibly to change parties before taking office in July. The subcommittee ruled that Mr. Kouri did not commit a corrupt act because he had not yet taken his oath at the time he took the money.</p>
