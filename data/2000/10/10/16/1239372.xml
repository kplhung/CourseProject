        <p>Giants Coach Jim Fassel had lost his star cornerback to injury and benched his top wide receiver. His special teams were in such disarray that a dropped snap that did not result in a blocked kick was a highlight. Twice he had turned to game officials to reverse a play via instant replay and twice the referee withdrew his head from the isolation of a sideline monitor and offered a head-shaking rebuke.</p>
        <p>It was a gloriously warm afternoon today at Giants Stadium, but as Fassel stalked the sideline, his disposition was anything but sunny. And it was still just midway through the second quarter.</p>
        <p>For the past week, the Giants had practiced a blueprint for a very traditional type of victory over the Dallas Cowboys. It featured punishing runs by the rookie Ron Dayne and turnovers created by an aggressive, blitzing defense. Now, with his team floundering in a scoreless game, came the test. Would the Giants stay with the game plan?</p>
        <p>On the next play, a fourth down inches from the Dallas goal line, a play-action fake to Dayne froze the defense because he had already pounded away at them for 51 yards. That pause allowed Kerry Collins to roll out untouched and throw a 1-yard touchdown pass to tight end Pete Mitchell, who was wide open.</p>
        <p>For the next two and a half quarters, the Giants' offense never looked adept or artistic, but it stayed with the plan. Dayne ran on, rushing for 108 yards and the winning touchdown in the fourth quarter. With help from a dependable, spirited defense that forced the Cowboys' Troy Aikman into five interceptions, the Giants held on to win, 19-14.</p>
        <p>If it was an inelegant victory, Fassel hopes it becomes representative. The Giants selected Dayne with their first draft pick this year to provide a stable rushing rhythm to their offense, and for the first time, Dayne had more than 100 yards on the ground.</p>
        <p>On a day when Collins was less than sharp and wide receiver Amani Toomer was yanked from the game because he was not executing his routes and assignments, the Giants gave the ball to Dayne 21 times, scored two touchdowns and two field goals and waited for the defense to protect the lead.</p>
        <p>It may be a style Giants fans will have to accept. It may be easier to swallow if the Giants remain tied for first place in the National Football Conference East. With a 5-2 record, the Giants have the best record after seven games since the 1993 team also went 5-2.</p>
        <p>''It's not always pretty,'' running back Tiki Barber said, ''but we're winning and there's a lot to be said for that. The way we should play is for Ron Dayne to get a lot of carries and then let me get in there and do my change-up thing.''</p>
        <p>Barber, whose quick, slashing style contrasts nicely with Dayne's rumbling forays, ran for 73 yards on 9 carries. For the last three weeks, the two backs had exchanged roles, with Barber carrying the football more often than Dayne.</p>
        <p>''We had gotten those two switched around and we had to get Dayne back as the workhorse,'' Fassel said. ''Ron Dayne has to be the starting point of our running game.''</p>
        <p>Dayne's impact was measured more in the settling effect it had. The Giants rushed for 203 yards, which helped keep the time of possession nearly even because Collins threw for only 119 yards. Toomer was not getting open, and though his replacement, Joe Jurevicius, led the team with four receptions, including a third-down catch in the game-winning drive, Jurevicius had just 25 receiving yards.</p>
        <p>''A lot of the time,'' Fassel said, ''our defense made up for a lot.''</p>
        <p>The game's first play was an interception 41 yards downfield by Jason Sehorn, the kind of leaping play that nearly made him a Pro Bowler three seasons ago. As Sehorn fell to the grass with his interception, the team said he sprained his sternoclavicular joint and fractured a rib behind his clavicle. The Giants did not say how long Sehorn would be out.</p>
        <p>''A week, two, three, I don't know,'' Fassel said. ''He's pretty sore.''</p>
        <p>Sehorn's absence did not deter the Giants from their attacking game plan. In the second quarter, Sehorn's replacement, Emmanuel McDaniel, sacked Aikman, and one play later another little-used cornerback, Reggie Stephens, intercepted Aikman. Free safety Shaun Williams and cornerback Dave Thomas also intercepted Aikman, whose five interceptions tied a Cowboys record.</p>
        <p>Thomas's interception set up Mitchell's touchdown, a score Dayne helped bring about with three successive runs that gained 19 yards.</p>
        <p>On defense, while the secondary was scrambling a bit to keep all its new parts in sync, it was helped by an improved pass rush. End Cedric Jones had a sack and his counterpart, Michael Strahan, had two pressures on Aikman and seven tackles.</p>
        <p>And yet, the Cowboys managed to take a 14-13 lead in the third quarter, in part because the Giants squandered two opportunities inside the Dallas 5, settling for field goals in both instances. In between those two scores, Jason Tucker returned the kickoff 90 yards to set up a 1-yard touchdown pass from Aikman to Robert Thomas. On their next possession, the Cowboys drove 61 yards, with Emmitt Smith's 3-yard run giving Dallas the lead.</p>
        <p>But the Giants' defense had one last big play in it. Linebacker Mike Barrow, who had his best game as a Giant with a team-leading 12 tackles, intercepted Aikman at the Dallas 31 early in the fourth quarter.</p>
        <p>Dayne and Barber soon alternated carries. Then Collins connected on two play-action passes, and soon, Dayne was bowling over two defenders at the goal line at the end of a bruising 3-yard touchdown run.</p>
        <p>That brought a thin smile to Fassel's face.</p>
        <p>''It wasn't clean in all parts,'' he said. ''But we showed some maturity in that we played the game we wanted to play. The bottom line is we finished it out, and finished it out with a win.''</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>Defensive tackle CORNELIUS GRIFFIN did not dress for the game because of a headache and dizziness. Griffin sustained a concussion last weekend at Atlanta but had practiced all week without any side effects. . . . The Giants won their second straight game heading into a bye week. They are 11-1 in games before a bye. They are 2-9 coming out of the break.</p>
