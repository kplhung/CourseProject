        <p>Chevron to Acquire Texaco In a $36 Billion Stock Deal  Chevron, the nation's third-largest oil company, has agreed to buy Texaco for $36 billion in stock, creating the world's fourth-largest oil concern. The company's boards approved the deal, which is expected to be announced today.</p>

        <p>Judge Allows EBay Suit to Continue  A California judge has allowed six people to proceed with a lawsuit that strikes at the core of how eBay runs its business. The lawsuit, filed by people who say they bought autographed sports memorabilia later found to be fake, contends that eBay has a responsibility to ensure the authenticity of the sports memorabilia sold on its site.

        <p>New Mission for Soldier of Fortune  The end of the cold war has left Soldier of Fortune magazine searching for its editorial place in the face of a new world order and declining profits. A steady base of 20,000 subscribers ''keeps the engines running,'' says Robert K. Brown, its editor, but newsstand sales have plummeted over the last 10 years to about 40,000 in a good month, far from its high of 150,000 during the cold war. [C16.]</p>

        <p>Apple Faces Future With Part of Past  At the heart of the new Apple Macintosh OS X operating system, expected to reach the market early next year, is Steven Jobs's 11-year-old Nextstep operating system. The fact that Mac users will be asked to move into the future by stepping into the past underscores the largest difficulty for Mr. Jobs since he returned to run Apple in 1997. A crucial question for Apple is whether it can successfully move its millions of customers from their current software systems to its yet-to-be-finished operating system. New Economy. [C5.]</p>

When such a surveillance device is in the area, a red light goes on and an alarm on the device sounds. In the two months since the device has been distributed in the United States, 100 of the gadgets have been sold. But so far, there have been no reports of customers' uncovering hidden cameras or bugs. [C5.]</p>
        <p>I.B.M. Invests to Profit From Chips  Underscoring its intent to be a superpower in semiconductors well into the 21st century, I.B.M. is spending $2.5 billion on a new microchip factory in East Fishkill, N.Y., and another $2.5 billion to modernize chip plants in Burlington, Vt., and overseas.
