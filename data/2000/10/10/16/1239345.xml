        <p>The leaves have turned cranberry red and mustard yellow in the Fox River Valley, and people are obsessing as usual about the Packers, the community-owned football team up in Green Bay.</p>
        <p>But something new has been added to the usual seasonal mix: Appleton, a pleasant city of 85,000 at the northern end of Lake Winnebago, finds itself squarely in the cross-hairs of the 2000 presidential campaign. This is the swing region in one of the handful of swing states in the neck-and-neck battle between Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.</p>
        <p>The region in eastern Wisconsin is rich in undecided voters. The candidates know it. They apparently think that women hold the key to the valley vote and that women care most about education. Mr. Bush came to Appleton on Oct. 5 for an event at McKinley Elementary, a public school with a charter school on the second floor; he favors charter schools, which are independently run institutions paid for with public funds. Tipper Gore, the vice president's wife, is due here on Monday for a visit to an all-public school.</p>
        <p>And when the candidates and their surrogates are off campaigning somewhere else, there are endless commercials on Green Bay television stations to ensure that Appleton does not forget the campaign and its role. Mr. Gore alone ran 2,322 spots in this region between June 1 and September 30, and one of Mr. Bush's education commercials appears several dozen times every week.</p>
        <p>''It goes on and on,'' said Donald Koteki, who runs the survey center at St. Norbert College in Green Bay.  ''It's nonstop. We had a furious campaign about whether to renovate Lambeau Field, where the Packers play, and just as that was ending, the presidential stuff started. People here are numb.''</p>
        <p>Numb they may be, but they, like other people in Wisconsin, are expected to vote heavily next month.  New registrations are up, and crowds -- like the throng of 6,000 to 8,000 that turned out for Mr. Gore in Milwaukee on Thursday -- are full of enthusiasm.</p>
        <p>The state still seems there for the taking. Jeff Mayers, a veteran political reporter in Madison, Wisconsin's capital, said the last month had ''seen a lot of action but not much change.'' The most recent statewide public poll, showing Mr. Gore up by five percentage points, was completed for The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel on Sept. 20 -- more than three weeks ago, and well before the two presidential debates and the recent intensification of violence in the Middle East.</p>
        <p>''We haven't gone up, they haven't gone up, we haven't gone down, they haven't gone down,'' said Teresa Vilmain, Mr. Gore's manager in the state. ''It's a struggle to the death here.''</p>
        <p>Republican strategists say they sense movement in their direction, and private polls taken by Democrats here before Wednesday night's debate showed Mr. Bush taking the lead in the Fox River Valley and cutting into Mr. Gore's lead in Milwaukee. Two additional factors cheer the Republicans: they have more money for the stretch drive, and Mr. Bush seems to many in Wisconsin to have bested Mr. Gore in the second debate.</p>
        <p>Appleton's and the Fox River Valley's pivotal role stems from some rough-and-ready electoral arithmetic. Democrats usually win Milwaukee, Republicans, the Milwaukee suburbs; Democrats usually win Madison, Republicans, the rural parts of the state. That leaves this region with a balancing role -- although such calculations are imprecise, omitting other cities like Racine and Kenosha.</p>
        <p>Though tucked away in a relatively remote corner of the United States, Appleton has had its share of famous citizens. There was Joseph R. McCarthy, the Red-hunting senator whose bust stands in the Outagamie County Courthouse; there was Harry Houdini, the illusionist, who grew up here; and there were two presidents of little Lawrence College (now Lawrence University) who moved on to major national educational roles -- Henry M. Wriston, who became president of Brown University, and Nathan M. Pusey, who became president of Harvard.</p>
        <p>But by and large, Green Bay and the valley are blue-collar places, good customers for the overalls made just south of here in Oshkosh.  Big paper mills (like the ones in Appleton and Neenah owned by the Kimberly-Clark Corporation, which makes Kleenex and Scott tissues) remain important employers, as do food packers.</p>
        <p>This district is ''the district of the pro-life, pro-family, Catholic deer hunter,'' said Mark Green, a Republican who represents it in Congress.</p>
        <p>''If you don't hunt, you don't fish and you don't milk cows in northern Wisconsin, what are you doing here?'' asked Susan Squires, a political reporter for The Post-Crescent in Appleton.</p>
        <p>Ms. Squires offered to bet that Mr. Bush would carry this area. Why was she so sure?</p>
        <p>''George Bush is the kind of guy you want to sit down and have a few beers with, and talk for an hour or so,'' she said. ''Gore isn't, not even the new, remodeled Gore. He's too much of an egghead for these people up here.''</p>
        <p>This region and Wisconsin as a whole do seem to have a certain affinity for low-key, not particularly electric politicians. Gov. Tommy G. Thompson, a Republican, and Senator Russell D. Feingold, a Democrat, both have reputations as unpretentious men of the people. Senator Herb Kohl, a multimillionaire and a Democrat, puts on fewer airs than many of his colleagues on Capitol Hill.</p>
        <p>Mr. Green argued that Mr. Bush, a governor preaching compassionate conservatism, would benefit from Mr. Thompson's innovative style of politics, which voters have grown accustomed to in electing him to four four-year terms. It is not that Mr. Thompson can deliver the state, Mr. Green said, but that he has made it receptive to Mr. Bush's ideas.</p>
        <p>By no means everyone buys his or Ms. Squires's analysis of this area.</p>
        <p>''This state votes on issues, not personality,'' said Bill Dixon, a Madison Democrat who runs a weekly political panel on a statewide public-broadcasting television program.  ''It's a political junkie's show. But people come up to me in the True Value hardware, or on the sidewalk downtown, and tell me what they think. Issues count in Wisconsin. They count in the Fox River Valley.''</p>
        <p>The valley has prospered during the Clinton-Gore years, others note, and there seems to be no particular reason for people here to want to change administrations. Taken together, the three area counties -- Brown (Green Bay), Outagamie (Appleton) and Winnebago (Oshkosh, Neenah and Menasha) -- voted for Mr. Bush's father in 1988, but supported Bill Clinton in 1992 and 1996.</p>
        <p>In fact, a woman asked Mr. Bush at McKinley school why an undecided voter should opt to switch parties in the White House, given current prosperity.</p>
        <p>''I'm groping for the right answer, as you can tell,'' he replied, stumbling over his words and syntax for four minutes or more until he finally managed to say, ''The economy's done more for this administration than the administration has done for the economy.''</p>
        <p>Ken Harwood, the mayor of Neenah, listened to Mr. Bush struggling and said: ''He has to be prepared to answer that question over and over again. He needs to say, I understand business and industry, and I can create a balance that will sustain this economy.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore never forgets to talk up the administration's economic achievements. But in his speech to the labor-dominated crowd in Milwaukee on Thursday, he pledged to create ''a better, fairer, stronger economy'' if elected.</p>
        <p>''Too many have been left behind,'' the vice president declared.</p>
        <p>So far, however, no issue has taken a dominant role, and a number of imponderables remain. One of the most important is Ralph Nader, the nominee of the Green Party, whose Wisconsin headquarters are prominently located on State Street, the funky pedestrian mall in Madison that links the State Capitol and the University of Wisconsin. Most politicians here thought that Mr. Nader would begin to lose strength as the campaign progressed, but he has held steady at 4 percent to 5 percent, which could cost Mr. Gore the state if it holds up at the polls.</p>
        <p>And what of the situation in the Middle East? Will it help Mr. Gore, who has more experience in international affairs, or Mr. Bush, whose party is trusted by more people, generally speaking, on foreign policy issues?</p>
        <p>Few here will risk a guess, and the candidates are taking nothing for granted. Mr. Bush will return to the state next week, on the day after the final debate, probably to visit La Crosse, on the Mississippi River, and Eau Claire in western Wisconsin. Mr. Gore is expected again, too, well before the end of the campaign. It's quite a lot of fuss over 11 electoral votes.</p>
