        <p>DEAR DIARY:</p>
        <p>In the swirl of commuters coming and going outside Grand Central Terminal, I found myself next to a young couple holding hands. Maybe newlyweds, I thought, based on the wee bit of air space between their bodies as they walked toward Park Avenue. At the corner of 41st Street, they stopped, apparently to head in separate directions. He gave her a peck on the mouth and started to head east. She ran toward him and grabbed his hand before he got away, and I heard her say, rather imploringly, ''Aren't you going to give me a Gore?''</p>

        <p>DEAR DIARY:</p>
        <p>In the swirl of commuters coming and going outside Grand Central Terminal, I found myself next to a young couple holding hands. Maybe newlyweds, I thought, based on the wee bit of air space between their bodies as they walked toward Park Avenue. At the corner of 41st Street, they stopped, apparently to head in separate directions. He gave her a peck on the mouth and started to head east. She ran toward him and grabbed his hand before he got away, and I heard her say, rather imploringly, ''Aren't you going to give me a Gore?''</p>
        <p>He threw his arms around her and planted a passionate kiss on her mouth. I guess this political campaign has been good for something.</p>

        <p>The recent ''Freshman and Reply'' poem reminded Sherman Siegel of the letter to a freshman from a dad with a sense of humor: ''Here is the $10 you asked for,'' he wrote. ''By the way, ten is spelled with one zero, not two.''</p>
        <p>COMPANIONS</p>
        <p>People ask me: ''Cats or dogs? Which do you like the best?''</p>
        <p>I like to answer: ''Cats, of course, they fit right in my nest.</p>
        <p>They don't jump up with muddy paws, they rarely share their spit.</p>
        <p>Their bills for vets and food supplies are cheaper by a bit.''</p>
        <p>But just between the two of us, when it's midnight, still and dark</p>
        <p>And there's a creak upon the stairs -- I wish my cat could BARK.</p>

        <p>Dear Diary:</p>
        <p>I got on an express train from Queens to Manhattan expecting a fairly normal ride. As soon as the train doors opened, I knew this would not be the case. Celine Dion was singing, courtesy of a large boom box. The owner of the boom box was clad all in yellow, with in-line skates with little lights, and he was putting on his protective gear. As soon as the gear was in place, he began to dance, using the poles as props and avoiding the bags and feet of his fellow passengers. We were all watching in a sort of stunned silence waiting to see if we would be asked for money or if we were simply his audience. The skater performed for two more songs, at one point doing a split on the floor of the car and impressing everyone. At Queens Plaza, he rolled out of the car -- we had obviously been simply an audience. When last seen he was spinning on the platform and waving at the departing train.</p>
        <p>EVE CARR</p>
        <p>More subway music: John Sweeney was on a southbound Lexington Avenue train, destination City Hall stop. As he entered, he heard the sounds of an Irish jig. To his left, sitting next to the last door, was a man in a gray tweed sweater and cap playing the violin. The other dozen or so passengers were smiling and tapping their feet, and Mr. Sweeney followed suit. When the train stopped at 14th Street, he moved next to the violinist to see where to drop a contribution. At the same time, the musician looked at his watch and started to put the violin away in a large black bag.</p>
        <p>''Practicing?'' Mr. Sweeney asked. ''Yes,'' the man replied. ''I'm a lawyer.'' Then the light dawned and the musician realized that Mr. Sweeney was asking about the music and not inquiring about his profession. Why the mini subway concert? No contributions, thank you. He had just bought an old violin, the lawyer said, and couldn't wait to try it out.</p>
        <p>Calculations like that by Allan Berlind help keep the price of gas and other fluids in perspective. Some 45 or 50 years ago, when their parents could not, or would not, buy it for them, Mr. Berlind and friends used their own hard-earned pennies to buy Nik-L-Nip, fruit-flavored sugar water packaged in tiny wax bottles. Recently, and much to his surprise, Mr. Berlind came across this treat of another era on the counter of his local deli-convenience store. When he said he hadn't seen the item in almost half a century, the owner insisted he take a package without charge. The five-pack of miniature bottles (''bite off the top, drink the liquid and chew the wax like gum''), about one-half ounce in all, sold for 79 cents. Mr. Berlind figured that would come to about $200 a gallon.</p>
        <p>DOUBLE STANDARD</p>
        <p>Andy, Randy, Syd and Ted</p>
        <p>Have seen me dressed in flaming red,</p>
        <p>And Peter, Skeeter, Bob and Jack</p>
        <p>Know every button on my black.</p>
        <p>Tonight I'm dining out with Joe,</p>
        <p>So what to wear, who's to know</p>
        <p>He loathes the green, he hates the gray;</p>
        <p>I'd better wear the gold today.</p>
        <p>It's worry, scurry, mend and press</p>
        <p>To match up man and date and dress,</p>
        <p>Though all the fellows think they need</p>
        <p>Is one unpressed and ancient tweed.</p>
        <p>PHYLLIS ROSENTEUR</p>
        <p>Communique from a man who does not wish to be identified:</p>
        <p>''While I was shining shoes at my job at a Midtown hotel, a man stepped up and was seated. I greeted him as I normally do, bent over and proceeded to give him my three-and-a-half-minute shoeshine. The customer began a friendly conversation with 'How are you today?' and went on to ask: 'What do you think of the weather?' 'How are your children feeling?' and 'What do you think of the Mets this year?' Of course, I responded and in return he answered with 'Uh-huh,' which seemed appropriate.</p>
        <p>''Finally the shoeshine was finished, and I said, 'It was nice talking to you,' when I suddenly realized that his conversation hadn't been addressed to me. He had been talking on his cellular phone the whole time. Needless to say, I was embarrassed. Thank goodness, the man never knew I was answering his questions.''</p>
