        <p>Scott Brosius dived to his left for Alex Rodriguez's liner, a desperate third baseman in flight. Brosius missed the ball by a few inches because he had to dive up and not straight across. After Rodriguez's single narrowly eluded him and drove in two go-ahead runs, Brosius remained squatting on his knees for about 30 seconds.</p>
        <p>So close, Brosius thought. So close to catching the ball, maybe turning a double play and maybe saving a crumbling Denny Neagle. The Yankees were so close to flying home last night with a berth in the World Series and five days of rest written in red on their calendars. They had a lead in the fifth inning, and the Mariners could not bruise a susceptible starter. They were 15 outs away.</p>

        <p>Scott Brosius dived to his left for Alex Rodriguez's liner, a desperate third baseman in flight. Brosius missed the ball by a few inches because he had to dive up and not straight across. After Rodriguez's single narrowly eluded him and drove in two go-ahead runs, Brosius remained squatting on his knees for about 30 seconds.</p>
        <p>So close, Brosius thought. So close to catching the ball, maybe turning a double play and maybe saving a crumbling Denny Neagle. The Yankees were so close to flying home last night with a berth in the World Series and five days of rest written in red on their calendars. They had a lead in the fifth inning, and the Mariners could not bruise a susceptible starter. They were 15 outs away.</p>
        <p>Instead, the sleeping Mariners awoke. After his crucial hit off the reliever Jeff Nelson, Rodriguez peered into the Seattle dugout, made a fist with his right hand and punched his left hand. Rodriguez was looking for a knockout punch and the Mariners took the sign literally. Edgar Martinez followed with a titanic two-run homer, John Olerud lashed another home run and the Mariners rumbled to a 6-2 victory in Game 5 of the American League Championship Series. Do not purchase those MetroCards just yet. The Yankees have to win one more.</p>
        <p>''You look at it as a missed opportunity,'' right fielder Paul O'Neill said. ''There's no doubt about it. The momentum can change. You don't want to give a team a chance. In the past, we wouldn't have let it happen. But this year has been different.''</p>
        <p>Do not extend the series. Do not let a good team breathe. Do not fritter away leads in a potentially decisive game. Manager Joe Torre had all of those reminders floating in his head as the Yankees hobbled along with a one-run lead after four innings.</p>
        <p>That was why Torre summoned Nelson, a setup man, with two on in the fifth. Win it now, Torre was thinking. The Mariners had scored five runs in the first four games, but they harpooned Torre's strategy and scored five off Nelson on six forgettable pitches. As O'Neill said, this year has been different.</p>
        <p>''I was brought in early to get out of that situation,'' Nelson said. ''There was no room for errors, and I made errors.''</p>
        <p>Six pitches from Nelson resulted in five runs and, once again, the Yankees have a postseason plea: El Duque, please save us. Orlando Hernandez, the Cuban defector who will start Game 6 tomorrow night, is 7-0 in October, so the Yankees should feel secure. Well, pretty secure.</p>
        <p>''I always feel pressure,'' Hernandez said. ''What I don't have is fear.''</p>
        <p>With Hernandez opposing John Halama at Yankee Stadium, it seems quite unlikely that the Yankees will collapse. If El Duque is finally mortal, the Yankees have Andy Pettitte for a possible Game 7. But the Mariners felt confident enough to send Halama to New York yesterday, 48 hours before a game that they knew might not be played, and they were more confident after their five-run outburst. Remember, the Yankees' seven-run explosion in Game 2 changed the series. Could Seattle's eruption change it again? The Yankees are wondering.</p>
        <p>One inspiring day last Wednesday turned into a second and a third victory for the Yankees. They fell short of a fourth consecutive victory because of several missed chances. With two men on in the fifth and the Yankees ahead, 2-1, Freddy Garcia went to 3-0 on O'Neill.</p>
        <p>Torre gave O'Neill the hit sign. Garcia had walked O'Neill on four pitches to load the bases in the fourth, then Sojo clubbed a two-run double. The same situation was awaiting the Yankees, but O'Neill lunged at an outside sinker and tapped it to shortstop. The No. 7 hitter behaved like the No. 3 hitter he used to be and expected a fastball.</p>
        <p>''Is that the turning point of the game?'' O'Neill wondered.</p>
        <p>On almost any day in their careers, the Yankees would have preferred to have the slugging O'Neill swinging at a 3-0 pitch with two men on than to have the pesky Sojo batting with the bases loaded. Not yesterday. Sojo has knocked in seven runs in 10 postseason games and O'Neill has one run batted in. O'Neill should have made Garcia throw at least one strike.</p>
        <p>''I was trying to do too much,'' O'Neill said. ''Next time, I'll take.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees had a chance to execute the Athletics in Game 4, but Roger Clemens fizzled and they had to journey to Oakland for Game 5. The Yankees weathered the 3,000-mile flight, they defeated the A's and they bulldozed ahead by winning three of the first four games in the A.L.C.S.</p>
        <p>The Yankees had a chance to drown the Mariners, but the Mariners had the kind of inning that propelled the Yankees four days ago. While the Yankees have El Duque to try to stop Seattle, they would have felt much better if Hernandez were sitting in his apartment tomorrow instead of standing on the mound at Yankee Stadium. They would have felt like A.L. champions.</p>
