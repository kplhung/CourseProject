        <p>Arthur Andersen, the world's largest accounting firm, has signed a lease with Boston Properties that would enable the developer to build the last of four office towers at the core of an 18-year-old plan to transform Times Square from a dowdy and foreboding crossroads into a vibrant, neon-drenched entertainment and commercial district.</p>
        <p>The 47-story, $600 million skyscraper would sit on an island at the south end of Times Square, bounded by Seventh Avenue and Broadway, between 42nd and 41st Streets. Designed by David M. Childs of Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill, the tower would offer a distinctively different face to Broadway, Seventh Avenue and 42nd Street.</p>

        <p>Arthur Andersen, the world's largest accounting firm, has signed a lease with Boston Properties that would enable the developer to build the last of four office towers at the core of an 18-year-old plan to transform Times Square from a dowdy and foreboding crossroads into a vibrant, neon-drenched entertainment and commercial district.</p>
        <p>The 47-story, $600 million skyscraper would sit on an island at the south end of Times Square, bounded by Seventh Avenue and Broadway, between 42nd and 41st Streets. Designed by David M. Childs of Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill, the tower would offer a distinctively different face to Broadway, Seventh Avenue and 42nd Street.</p>
        <p>The site is now occupied by the Times Square Brewery and a nearly vacant office building, both of which would be demolished.</p>
        <p>Executives on both sides of the deal said that the lease, signed late Friday night, commits Arthur Andersen to taking more than 500,000 square feet in the 1.2 million-square-foot tower. The deal is dependent on Boston Properties' obtaining full control of the site from Prudential Insurance Company and on Arthur Andersen's completing its negotiations for about $10 million in tax breaks from city officials.</p>
        <p>Some officials have questioned the wisdom of providing subsidies to the company to go into what has become one of the most desirable locations in the city.</p>
        <p>But Charles A. Gargano, chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation, said: ''You couldn't get a better example of a public-private partnership than what's happened in Times Square. That's the role government should play, and it works.''</p>
        <p>The office of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani did not return telephone calls seeking comment.</p>
        <p>The accountants from Arthur Andersen would be the latest in a wave of corporate employees to move to an area that less than a decade ago was populated mainly by pimps, prostitutes, drug dealers and wary tourists.</p>
        <p>The old denizens of Times Square have been replaced by investment bankers from Morgan Stanley, entertainment executives from Viacom and Bertelsmann AG, boisterous teenagers who flock to the MTV music studios and millions of visitors to Broadway theaters, the new movie palaces and other entertainment sites.</p>
        <p>Later this month, Madame Tussaud's plans to open its wax and audioanimatronic museum on 42nd Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenues.</p>
        <p>''It's both the end and the beginning,'' said Rebecca Robertson, the former president of the state's 42nd Street Development Project, who oversaw the development for a decade ending in 1997. ''Forty-second Street and Times Square has become E-squared. It's amazing how in tune it is with this new world. It's business, it's entertainment and it's quintessentially New York.''</p>
        <p>Executives from Arthur Andersen and Boston Properties said neither side expected problems in moving forward with the deal. And with the vacancy rate in Midtown office buildings at a barely perceptible 3 percent, real estate brokers say they do not expect Boston Properties to have any trouble filling the rest of the building.</p>
        <p>Both sides expect construction to begin early next year.</p>
        <p>''It came together very quickly,'' one person involved in the negotiations said. ''It's the last piece of the puzzle in Times Square.''</p>
        <p>Mortimer B. Zuckerman, the chairman of Boston Properties and the publisher of The Daily News, has told friends he hoped that Times Square Tower, the name he has given the skyscraper, would become an international icon. It would loom over One Times Square, home of the New Year's Eve ball drop, and dominate the southern view of the ''crossroads of the world,'' the subject of millions of tourist photographs every year.</p>
        <p>According to one real estate broker who has been briefed on the project, Boston Properties plans to hold space at the top of the skyscraper off the market for a while and then rent its panoramic view for a premium, more than $100 a square foot annually. Brokers said that Arthur Andersen would be paying about $70 a square foot.</p>
        <p>Taxpayers have also had a stake in the revival of Times Square since state and city officials have provided hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks and other incentives to developers and tenants. The incentives continued even after corporations began migrating to the area in the late 1990's.</p>
        <p>Boston Properties has already received an incentive package valued at $236 million over 20 years for the site where Arthur Andersen plans to move. In asking for additional tax breaks, Andersen has threatened to move some workers to Roseland, N.J., where it has offices.</p>
        <p>Boston Properties' project would cap a redevelopment plan that began in 1982, when city and state officials announced that they would offer developers huge tax breaks and the opportunity to build four office towers in the once vibrant neighborhood, which had fallen on hard times. In return, the developers were to restore a half-dozen live theaters on 42nd Street and improve the huge Times Square subway station.</p>
        <p>The developer George Klein and later, Prudential Insurance, were chosen, but progress was slow as the state's effort to gain control of 13 acres along 42nd Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenues ran into 47 separate lawsuits and a devastating recession in the early 1990's.</p>
        <p>Because the city was littered with vacant office towers in 1991, Prudential, which had put up more than $400 million to acquire the land, did not want to go forward. That provided the state with an opportunity to redesign the project. Instead of wiping out the bustling, brightly lighted past of Times Square and replacing it with something akin to a suburban office park, a new plan called for restoring the district's ''razzmatazz,'' with large illuminated billboards, entertainment venues and office towers that reflected the street life of the area. Prudential ultimately decided to sell the development rights for the four office sites.</p>
        <p>It was a huge gamble, Ms. Robertson said, and no one knew if it would work. Suddenly, the redevelopment project took off in 1995, as the the city's economy was starting to boom. First, the Walt Disney Company renovated the dilapidated New Amsterdam Theater on 42nd Street.</p>
        <p>In 1996, the developer Douglas Durst signed a deal to build the first of the four towers, a 48-story, 1.6-million-square-foot skyscraper that is now home to Conde Nast Publications and the law firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom. The next year, Reuters and the Rudin real estate family began work on the Reuters Building, a 32-story, 855,000-square-foot tower that is nearing completion on the west side of Seventh Avenue between 42nd and 43rd Streets.</p>
        <p>Boston Properties started demolition last year for what is known as Five Times Square Tower, a 37-story, 1.1-million-square-foot headquarters for Ernst &amp; Young, the accounting firm, at the southwest corner of 42nd Street and Seventh Avenue, next door to the New Amsterdam Theater. And now Arthur Andersen, plans to move onto the street that hustlers once called the Deuce.</p>
        <p>Along with the office towers, multiplex theaters, game rooms, a Hilton hotel, the B. B. King nightclub, the MTV music studios and the largest video screen in the world have gone up along 42nd Street and elsewhere in Times Square.</p>
        <p>''It was a wonderful coincidence of planning and market,'' Ms. Robertson said.</p>
