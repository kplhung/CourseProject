        <p>Re ''Sirimavo Bandaranaike of Sri Lanka Dies at 84; First Woman Premier'' (obituary, Oct. 11): Mrs. Bandaranaike, who became the world's first female prime minister in 1960, was the widow of the previous prime minister. Indira Gandhi, who became prime minister of India in 1966, was the daughter of Jawaharlal Nehru, that country's first prime minister. Golda Meir, who became prime minister of Israel in 1969, was another first: none of her male relatives had ever held her seat before her.</p>
