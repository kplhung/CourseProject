        <p>BUFFALO: RURAL ECONOMY STRENGTHENING  Economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York report that rural areas of the state grew in population from 1990 to 1999 compared with urban areas, which shrank or remained the same, and that nonfarm employment from 1975 to 1999 rose 41 percent, compared with 32 percent in urban areas. Economists in the Buffalo office said businesses may be moving to rural areas in search of less expensive labor, land and housing.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: STRICTER FUEL STANDARDS URGED  Senator  Charles E. Schumer, a Brooklyn Democrat, yesterday announced a plan to encourage nationwide energy conservation, including  reclassifying what he called gas-guzzling sport utility vehicles as cars instead of trucks. He noted that sales of the vehicles had more than tripled to 3.1 million in 1999 from 976,000 in 1989 and that their fuel efficiency had dropped to 19.6 miles per gallon from 20.9 during the same period. Reclassifying them as cars would force them to adhere to a standard of 27.5 miles per gallon. He also proposed $1 billion in tax credits to encourage the development of energy sources other than petroleum.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: THE CASE OF THE SUSPICIOUS SUITCASE  The hustle and bustle of the 26th Street flea market was interrupted yesterday morning by the sort of find no one wants -- a suitcase left unattended long enough for the Police Department's bomb squad to be called. The black case, which turned out to be empty save for three AA batteries, had been left on the sidewalk in front of one of the market's busiest sites, on the Avenue of the Americas between 25th and 26th Streets. According to the police, an anonymous man called to report a ''suspicious suitcase, standing upright and unattended'' at 10:23 a.m. The police evacuated the 26th Street site and cordoned off the Avenue of the Americas between 23rd and 27th Streets for about an hour.</p>

        <p>HAUPPAUGE: SUPPORT FOR IMMIGRANT LABORERS  Just before dusk yesterday, a crowd waving a multinational sea of flags gathered outside a Suffolk County office building here to urge county leaders and other officials to address the problems faced by day laborers, most of whom are immigrants from Mexico and Central America. About 3,000 people attended the rally, the police said. Organized by the Suffolk County Human Rights Commission and Paul J. Tonna, the presiding officer of the Suffolk Legislature, the candlelight rally came a month after an attack on two day laborers in Farmingville, and the day after a town hall meeting in Centereach, where 200 Suffolk residents demanded tougher enforcement of immigration laws.</p>

        <p>ALBANY: FEWER HUNTING LICENSES ISSUED  Sales of hunting licenses in New York have dropped every year since 1991 before rebounding slightly last year. A common lament from hunters is that young people are more interested in video games than the outdoors. Charles Mowatt, who encourages deer hunting in his woods in Cattaraugus County, said hunters are getting old and ''they're like me -- they don't shoot so straight.'' It is too early to draw a link between fewer hunters and the thriving deer population, estimated at one million in New York, said William Porter, a wildlife biologist at the State College of Environmental Science and Forestry in Syracuse. But he warned that there might be trouble if hunting continues to decline.</p>

        <p>HARTFORD: PHARMACIST SHORTAGE  A shortage of pharmacists in Connecticut has forced many drugstores to close during regular business hours because Connecticut laws require drugstores to close when there is no pharmacist working. The University of Connecticut, home of the state's only pharmacy program, usually graduates more than 90 new pharmacists annually. But it has extended its pharmacy training to six years from five, so no pharmacy students graduated from its program this year.</p>

        <p>BLOOMFIELD: LATINO EPISCOPAL BISHOP INSTALLED  The Episcopal Diocese of Connecticut has consecrated its first Latino bishop. The ceremony in Bloomfield on Saturday for the bishop, Wilfrido Ramos-Orench, was delivered in English, Spanish and French Creole. Bishop Ramos, 60, has served in a regional ministry in Hartford as well as in the Spanish-speaking congregation in New Britain.</p>

        <p>BRISTOL: EMISSIONS CLEANUP  Taxpayers in 14 central Connecticut towns will have to share the more than $3 million cost of altering a Bristol incinerator to make it less polluting. Leaders of the towns whose trash flows into the Odgen Martin incinerator are negotiating a contractual change that will pass the cleanup cost plus $55,000 annually on to taxpayers. The 13-year-old plant needs updated scrubbers and equipment that strips poisonous mercury from its emissions.</p>

        <p>NEW JERSEY</p>
        <p>PISCATAWAY: NADER SPEECH DISRUPTED  Reports of a suspicious package at Rutgers  University's Busch Campus Center yesterday disrupted the campaign speech of Ralph Nader, the Green Party presidential candidate, officials said. Sgt. Ron Brown of the state police said the agency's bomb squad was called to the campus center around 3:30 p.m. Sergeant Brown had little additional information about the package, and the university police declined to release information about the incident.</p>

        <p>TRENTON: SLAVERY REPARATIONS FRAUD  Almost 600 people in New Jersey have been bilked by con artists who tell black residents they can receive money for a phony ''slave reparations'' tax credit. Although the Internal Revenue Service has issued warnings nationwide, regional officials worry that many New Jersey residents are still unaware of the fraud. The number of claims sent from state residents to the I.R.S. dropped from 512 in July to 30 in August. But the filings increased to 51 in September, despite a summer campaign to warn people. The hoax usually involves con artists posing as tax preparers who tell blacks they can receive credit for slavery reparations in exchange for a fee of $30 to $50.</p>
