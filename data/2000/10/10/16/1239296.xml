        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>An Oct. 9 front-page article about  Rick A. Lazio's debate with Hillary Rodham Clinton reports that he said the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League ''wants to kick the Vatican out of the U.N.'' The article says Naral wants ''the Vatican's role weakened at the U.N.'' In fact, the ''See Change'' Campaign --  which is endorsed by Naral and 600 other groups worldwide -- would neither kick the Vatican out nor weaken its role. It would level the playing field by changing the Vatican's status from nonmember-state permanent observer to permanent observer or nongovernmental organization.</p>

        <p>Some would say that being recognized as a religious organization rather than a putative state is far more significant. The church has much more to offer the world as a moral voice than as a political one.</p>
