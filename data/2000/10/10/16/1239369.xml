        <p>Vinny Testaverde came back today and the Jets were back to being themselves.</p>
        <p>They were back to a smothering defense that had been embarrassed last week by Pittsburgh, but which bludgeoned New England quarterback Drew Bledsoe with seven sacks, the most by the Jets in eight years.</p>
        <p>Linebacker Mo Lewis, who has complained about not playing frequently on third-down situations, produced an awesome game. Today, he played more and tipped a pass that led to an interception and touchdown by Victor Green, ran the ball for a first down when the Jets lined up in a field-goal formation, had a sack of Bledsoe for a 12-yard loss on third down in the third quarter when the Jets pinned the Patriots deep in their own territory and then, for good measure, a late-game interception.</p>
        <p>The Jets went back to Curtis Martin, who has made a career of having big days against the Patriots. He had  one of his biggest ever with 143 yards and 3 rushing touchdowns, the latter for the first time as a Jet.</p>
        <p>They went back to what works in a dominating 34-17 victory.</p>
        <p>If Testaverde provided more heart than yardage in a game that he hoped would quell speculation that his age was catching up with him, then the Jets showed that, even if Testaverde does not return to his Pro Bowl form this season, they are surely a playoff-caliber team. They are at 5-1, and tied atop the A.F.C. East with the Dolphins, whom the Jets play next Monday night at home.</p>
        <p>The Patriots had been rejuvenated with two upset victories leading up to this game, but they were thoroughly overmatched today. The Jets were coming off a devastating loss with an injured quarterback and entering a string of critical and difficult division games.</p>
        <p>They produced their most complete victory, and, with it, a resounding display of determination, completing a season sweep of the Patriots and Bill Belichick, who admitted to being outcoached.</p>
        <p>''I think we need that every week,'' said Testaverde, who completed 15 of his 23 passing attempts for 139 yards after leaving early in the Steelers game with an aggravation of a previously undisclosed pinched nerve in his neck. ''We have a pretty good football team but not a great team. In order for us to win, we have to play as a team. One of the things we have that others don't is mental toughness. That alone is going to give us a chance to win games.''</p>
        <p>A few years ago, then Coach Bill Parcells told Testaverde that he did not have to win every game alone, that it was O.K. to rely on other parts of the team. Today, Martin had an especially large burden.</p>
        <p>Testaverde said the Jets go as Martin goes and he was facing a run defense that had not allowed a 100-yard rusher all season. With Testaverde's durability unknown (Coach Al Groh said he wasn't sure Testaverde would play until Saturday morning), the offense focused largely on him and on an offensive line that had been beset by missed blocks and penalties last week.</p>
        <p>Groh had disparaged the toughness of the offensive line. Center Kevin Mawae said the line wanted to prove Groh wrong. It opened gaping holes for Martin and kept pressure largely away from Testaverde, who was sacked three times, all of which he bounced up from.</p>
        <p>''The offensive line made it look easy,'' Martin said. ''They made my job easier, not easy.''</p>
        <p>The defense, too, had been manhandled by Pittsburgh last week.</p>
        <p>But today, using waves of blitzes and a stunning effort from the rookie defensive end John Abraham, who had two sacks and a forced fumble before leaving with a stomach muscle pull, the Jets held the Patriots to 249 yards of offense, and befuddled Bledsoe with nearly constant pressure. The Jets forced six turnovers, including four interceptions, that led to four scores.</p>
        <p>The first, a fumble by running back Kevin Faulk, forced by Bryan Cox, led to a nine-play drive that ended in Martin's first touchdown of the day, a 2-yard run for a 7-0 lead.</p>
        <p>Two plays later, Bledsoe reared back to throw. But the ball went almost nowhere, tipped instead high in the air by Lewis, who was rushing from the strong side. Green grabbed the ball as if fielding a pop fly and ran 21 yards for a touchdown and a 14-0 lead.</p>
        <p>Green intercepted Bledsoe again at the start of the fourth quarter, but that drive ended in John Hall's failed 46-yard field goal attempt.</p>
        <p>The Patriots then ran off 10 points, scoring first on a 23-yard field goal after an 81-yard, 10-play drive and then a 9-yard touchdown run by Kevin Faulk on a drive that started on the Patriots' 44 yard line.</p>
        <p>That brief comeback inspired the gambler in Groh.</p>
        <p>With the Jets facing fourth and 2 on New England's 22-yard line, Groh called for a play that the Jets had practiced just a handful of times this week. He lined the Jets up as if they were going to kick a field goal. Then, Tom Tupa, who was the holder, moved behind center and Lewis, who is usually in on field goals, moved into the backfield.</p>
        <p>Martin had watched Lewis practice this play this week and wondered what would happen if he ever had to make a move to elude a defender. Lewis took a pitch from Tupa and ran 3 yards for the first down.</p>
        <p>''I thought it was something they would hold in their pocket,'' said Lewis. ''I didn't think we'd do it this week.''</p>
        <p>Martin scored his second touchdown of the day, on a 4-yard run, four plays later. Four plays after that,  Bledsoe was sacked and stripped by Abraham, and fellow rookie Shaun Ellis recovered at the Patriots' 45. With 10 seconds remaining in the first half, Hall kicked a 38-yard field goal. The lead was 24-10 at the half and the brutal pattern of the game had been established: use the defense to pound the quarterback and then let Martin pound the ball when the Jets have possession.</p>
        <p>The Jets added Martin's third touchdown run, a 2-yarder, in the third quarter, and after Bledsoe scrambled 13 yards for a touchdown in the fourth, added another Hall field goal on a drive that began after Lewis picked off Bledsoe.</p>
        <p>Afterward, the Jets were exuberant. They had fed off the toughness of their quarterback and turned their back on a potential slide.</p>
        <p>''We needed this,'' said Green, ''for  our confidence.''</p>
