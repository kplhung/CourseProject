        <p>FOR many corporations these days, coping with e-commerce is a lot like coming to terms with death. Executives are past the stages of denial and anger, and have moved beyond the bargaining stage, where they pondered ways to stave off a complete rethinking of their businesses. Most are now either slogging through depression -- brought on by technology spending forecasts and the futile search for skilled workers -- or are finally arriving at acceptance.</p>
        <p>But rather than an end stage, acceptance is just the beginning. For large companies made up of a tapestry of disparate business units, the most difficult task often is creating a management structure that can weave e-commerce through the various divisions smoothly, without seeing the entire effort unravel.</p>

        <p>FOR many corporations these days, coping with e-commerce is a lot like coming to terms with death. Executives are past the stages of denial and anger, and have moved beyond the bargaining stage, where they pondered ways to stave off a complete rethinking of their businesses. Most are now either slogging through depression -- brought on by technology spending forecasts and the futile search for skilled workers -- or are finally arriving at acceptance.</p>
        <p>But rather than an end stage, acceptance is just the beginning. For large companies made up of a tapestry of disparate business units, the most difficult task often is creating a management structure that can weave e-commerce through the various divisions smoothly, without seeing the entire effort unravel.</p>
        <p>And though companies are starting to get smarter about so-called e-governance issues, such intelligence is often the hard-won result of some harsh experiences. The question becomes: How can a big company avoid having each of its business units go through the same growing pains as each unit adopts e-commerce?</p>
        <p>''Most companies started with committees'' to manage their e-business initiatives, said Carol Rozwell, an analyst with the Gartner Group, a research and consulting firm. ''But the committee structure is notoriously weak,'' she said, partly because e-commerce is a consensus-resistant topic, and partly because committees are better at making plans than carrying them out.</p>
        <p>As a result, Ms. Rozwell said, businesses have recently begun tinkering with a number of alternatives. Two of the more popular approaches, she said, are either to appoint an e-business czar with the authority and budget to foist change on the entire organization, or to create a team of e-business evangelists who can spread the Internet religion one corporate division at a time.</p>
        <p>Whatever the approach, Ms. Rozwell and others said, an e-governance plan can fall on its face if it does not indicate how a company with thousands of employees and unrelated Internet initiatives can quickly get better at e-commerce when corporate structures tend to thwart both speed and collaborative learning.</p>
        <p>''That's the $64,000 question,'' Ms. Rozwell said. ''If anything is a new frontier for businesses these days, it's that.''</p>
        <p>Executives and employees of the Raytheon Company have begun crossing that frontier already, said Eric Singleton, the company's director of global e-business. Last summer, Mr. Singleton set up a three-person team responsible for bringing e-commerce, where appropriate, to the company's seven divisions.</p>
        <p>After surveying a company with more than 94,000 employees in more than 70 countries, Mr. Singleton said, his first move was to build an e-commerce World Wide Web site for Raytheon's marine products division. That unit makes radar systems, radios and other equipment for boaters -- and, incidentally, is one of the few Raytheon divisions that makes consumer products.</p>
        <p>The move was intended not only to extend Raytheon's brand onto the Web with something other than an online brochure, he said, but also to provide a high-profile example of his team's Internet capabilities for other Raytheon divisions to see.</p>
        <p>The result of that effort is Boaters .com, a boating information and commerce site that features Raytheon products as well as competing goods, with links to more than 4,000 marine supply merchants. The site has succeeded in referring visitors to those merchants at a rate that is four times the industry average, Mr. Singleton said.</p>
        <p>But more important, Mr. Singleton's team took the experience of creating that site in cooperation with PricewaterhouseCoopers and other consultants, and boxed it -- literally -- for other divisions to use.</p>
        <p>Among other things, that box contains a stripped-down version of the Boaters.com business plan, Web site development software and process maps for building the site, and a checklist for determining whether a given Raytheon division is well suited for e-commerce.</p>
        <p>''When we designed Boaters.com, we knew that if we did it the right way, we could springboard other sites within Raytheon and get to market much faster,'' Mr. Singleton said. ''So if another division wants to start an e-business, 70 percent of it is already done and in the box, and the rest can be tailored to fit them.''</p>
        <p>The tailoring process, he said, now takes 90 days or less, depending on the complexity of the business, and involves help from Mr. Singleton's team, Pricewaterhouse and a host of smaller consulting firms.</p>
        <p>To further refine his own team's e-business expertise and share that knowledge with employees, Mr. Singleton said, early next year his team will roll out a corporate Intranet site with a database of all the e-commerce information his team has gathered. Rather than call the corporate office for help in finding creative services for a Web site, for instance, a division leader will be able to log onto the Intranet, type in a query, and receive suggestions that are suited to his budget and timetable.</p>
        <p>Mr. Singleton would not disclose the total expense of the company's e-commerce effort; nor would he estimate the money it might save. But he said Raytheon had given him the go-ahead to see if there might be a commercial market for his e-commerce start-up kit, which is called E-novation in a Box. ''We want to see if the external community shows interest,'' he said. ''It's definitely worthwhile to look into.''</p>
        <p>Fulton Wilcox, who directs the North American e-commerce efforts of BOC Gases, an industrial gas producer, said that managing a company's e-business initiatives required ''both a loose and tight approach.''</p>
        <p>''On the one hand, in the early days you want people to take the initiative,'' Mr. Wilcox said. ''But on the other hand, you also don't want them to be reinventing things or confusing large customers by doing things differently.''</p>
        <p>Through the BOC Group, its parent corporation, BOC Gases began a far-reaching e-commerce program five years ago that, among other things, links its suppliers and customers to the company via the Internet. The company's e-commerce knowledge ''is in multiple people and places,'' Mr. Wilcox said.</p>
        <p>''We're starting to have senior-level coordinating sessions on this, because it's becoming part of the basic managing of the business,'' he said. ''But we've also set up Web pages to share experiences, projects, who's doing what.''</p>
        <p>According to Steven J. Johnson, a partner with Andersen Consulting,  few companies build Intranet sites to capture and spread their e-commerce knowledge as it grows. ''They're doing it a lot more informally, with committees and task forces,'' he said. ''There's no question that can be amplified through the use of technology.''</p>
        <p>''E-commerce has taught us, and our clients, that organizations that are to survive have to be very agile, which in a lot of cases means a more flattened organizational structure,'' Mr. Johnson said. ''So you have to equip people with the best knowledge, or else you can get thousands of loose cannons going off.''</p>
        <p>Things were never quite that chaotic within Andersen, Mr. Johnson said, but in the early 90's ''it was pretty informal, where if you wanted to know something you had to phone around to people who might know, and hope that person would be available,'' he said. ''Individuals were human encyclopedias,'' he added, ''so clearly there were limitations.''</p>
        <p>So Andersen Consulting created a ''knowledge exchange'' site on its Intranet where the company's 65,000 employees could submit e-commerce-related queries and read advisory material that had been gleaned and vetted by Andersen's e-business team. ''This sort of thing is critical,'' he said. ''Because if somebody isn't doing it actively, all of that expertise falls through the cracks.''</p>
