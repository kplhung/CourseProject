        <p>Re ''Clinton Plans to Issue Rules Expanding Patients' Rights'' (news article, Oct. 9): The proposed new rules should be helpful, but are no substitute for a strong patients' bill of rights like the Norwood-Dingell bill, which passed the House by an overwhelming margin last year. The administration rules do not address  critical issues like emergency services, timely access to needed specialty care and making sure that medical decisions are left to patients and their doctors.</p>

        <p>Re ''Clinton Plans to Issue Rules Expanding Patients' Rights'' (news article, Oct. 9): The proposed new rules should be helpful, but are no substitute for a strong patients' bill of rights like the Norwood-Dingell bill, which passed the House by an overwhelming margin last year. The administration rules do not address  critical issues like emergency services, timely access to needed specialty care and making sure that medical decisions are left to patients and their doctors.</p>
        <p>The rules also do not give patients the right to hold H.M.O.'s accountable for injuries or death resulting from improper delay or denial of care. H.M.O.'s are the only entity in our society that cannot be held legally accountable when they do harm. Americans know that's wrong; 87 percent support a strong patients' bill of rights. Yet a few lawmakers in the Senate beholden to insurance companies continue to block passage.</p>
