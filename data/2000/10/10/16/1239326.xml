        <p>George Rothman, the music director of the Riverside Symphony, works closely with the composer Anthony Korf, who serves as artistic director, in putting together the orchestra's concerts. Giving a composer and conductor equal input into the process may be one reason that the Riverside Symphony's programs are so stimulating, as was Wednesday night's at Alice Tully Hall.</p>
        <p>There was a recent work, ''Shulamit's Dream'' by Mario Davidovsky, in its New York premiere, Sibelius's Symphony No. 6 from 1923 and Tchaikovsky's seldom-heard symphonic poem ''Hamlet,'' first performed in 1888. One new work, one early 20th-century work and one old work, all of them substantive: that's the kind of programming balance more major American orchestras should emulate.</p>
        <p>It wasn't just the mix of repertory but the way the works commented on one another that was so interesting. Though Tchaikovsky's 20-minute ''Hamlet'' meanders structurally, the music is a volatile mix of impassioned outbursts and elegiac melodies. In one developmental section, an arching theme in high strings breaks off, and inner voices scurry every which way, a sort of barely controlled chaos: disturbing, exciting and almost modern. Heard in this context the piece prepared the listener for ''Shulamit's Dream,'' first performed by the San Francisco Symphony in 1993.</p>
        <p>To those who associate Mr. Davidovsky with his formidable contemporary works that combine standard instruments and electronic elements, this lush, vividly scored dramatic scene for soprano and orchestra will come as a surprise. The composer has described ''Shulamit's Dream,'' which sets verses from the biblical ''Song of Songs,'' as the ''closest I have come to a piece for the theater.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Davidovsky does not mute the poetic eroticism of the text, an exchange between lovers intended as a metaphor for the courtship of God. The vocal lines shift from passages of sustained, languid lyricism to agitated outbursts with daring leaps. The impressive soprano Susan Narucki handled the part with technical command and no loss of tonal richness. The arresting musical language is beholden to Berg and permeated with dissonance but tempered with softly ecstatic, quasi-tonal harmony.</p>
        <p>The concert concluded with Sibelius's Sixth Symphony, a remarkable and still radical work in which the composer at once conjures up pastoral geniality and makes a headlong assault on linear logic. Heard in the context of this program, the work's discontinuities sounded as shocking as anything written in the tumultuous 1920's.</p>
        <p>Under Mr. Rothman the mostly young musicians made up in eagerness what they sometimes lacked in precision. All three performances were full of ideas and engaging, which could also be said about the overall programming of the Riverside Symphony.</p>
