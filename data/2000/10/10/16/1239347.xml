        <p>The Pentagon today suspended all naval refueling operations in Yemen until officials determine whether lax security in the port at Aden left the American destroyer Cole vulnerable to a presumed bombing attack that killed 17 sailors and wounded more than three dozen others.</p>
        <p>The security at the port -- and with the private contractor that oversaw the refueling -- has become a focus of the widening investigation into what officials have called a suicide attack. Since the attack is believed to have involved a harbor boat helping the Cole moor at a refueling site in Aden's port, officials say they believe that those involved skillfully infiltrated the port's operations or the contractor itself.</p>
        <p>In addition to a criminal inquiry, led by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Navy and the Department of Defense have begun separate investigations into how a small harbor boat packed with explosives could have managed to blow a gaping hole in one of the Navy's most sophisticated warships, senior officials said today.</p>
        <p>''We will find out through this inquiry as to whether there was any laxity, any failure to measure up to the very highest standards that we insist upon for force protection,'' Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen said in an interview on the CBS News program ''Face the Nation.''</p>
        <p>The Pentagon today identified the company hired to provide fuel to visiting American warships as the Arab Investment Manufacturing and Trading Company Ltd., based in Aden. The company's role and that of Aden's government-run port agency are subjects of the F.B.I.'s investigation, officials said.</p>
        <p>A Pentagon spokesman, Lt. Col. Paul S. Phillips, said the contract for refueling -- negotiated between the company and a division of the Defense Logistics Agency -- did not specify the company's responsibilities for security of operations at the port. It did, however, detail responsibilities for the company's own facilities, like requiring a fence around its pipelines to the harbor, Colonel Phillips said.</p>
        <p>Pentagon officials also revised some of the details about the refueling visits. Today they said two dozen American warships had stopped to refuel in Aden since the Navy began using the facilities there in early 1999 -- double the 12 visits that officials had originally cited.</p>
        <p>The extent to which the company had been vetted was not clear. And American officials in Washington and in Yemen continued to provide conflicting accounts of which American agency, if any, oversaw the company's security, as well as that of the port itself.</p>
        <p>''We'll have to see whether or not anything more could have been done -- should have been done -- to prevent this,'' President Clinton's national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, said on the NBC News program ''Meet the Press.''</p>
        <p>In Aden, American investigators and forensic experts scoured the Cole for evidence that could be used to find those involved in an attack. Officials said investigators had found small fiberglass fragments on the Cole believed to be from the harbor boat that is thought to have exploded as it sidled up to destroyer's port side.</p>
        <p>The officials said they now believed that the boat was 21 to 26 feet long and packed with several hundred pounds of high explosives. Investigators also found fragmentary bits of what seemed to be human flesh on the Cole's deck, perhaps the remains of two men who were seen standing on the boat in the moments before it apparently exploded.</p>
        <p>Mr. Berger, Mr. Cohen and Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright defended the decision to use Aden as a refueling point despite concerns about security in a country the State Department itself called ''a safe haven for terrorists'' earlier this year.</p>
        <p>''For well over a decade, we've had a strong military presence in this region,'' Mr. Berger said. ''Now, if you're going to have a strong military presence, that means you're going to have to be dealing with some countries with whom we don't agree in all respects.''</p>
        <p>For American warships passing through the Suez Canal and the Red Sea on their way to operations in the Persian Gulf, the port in Aden is strategically situated, Mr. Berger and other officials said. They also said there were few alternatives.</p>
        <p>The architect of the plan to use the port, Gen. Anthony C. Zinni, who recently retired as the commander of American forces in the region, said in an interview today that Aden actually provided greater security than the alternatives. The reason, he said, was that Aden's port has a new refueling site in the middle of the harbor, which means that ships do not have to dock at a pier, where security is even harder to police.</p>
        <p>''This was one of the best ports in the region security-wise,'' General Zinni said.</p>
        <p>But others raised questions about the wisdom of using Aden, a dilapidated, bustling port with only a limited sense of law and order.</p>
        <p>''Well, I think we should look at that very carefully,'' Senator Trent Lott, the Republican majority leader, said on ''Meet the Press.''</p>
        <p>''I've been asking some questions about that,'' Mr. Lott said. ''Obviously, it's a dangerous area. We should have reason to suspect that terrorism exists there and could affect our ships, but, you know, I don't want to second-guess it at this point.''</p>
