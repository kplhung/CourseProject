        <p>More than 1,200 newly certified teachers have turned down jobs in New York City this fall because of a court order that would have forced them to work in the city's lowest-performing schools, according to the schools chancellor, Harold O. Levy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levy disclosed the figure in a sharply worded letter to the state education commissioner, Richard P. Mills, who sued the Board of Education this summer to ensure that only certified teachers would fill vacancies in 94 schools defined as ''failing.'' A resulting court order forced Mr. Levy to comply. In the letter to Mr. Mills, written on Friday, the schools chancellor complained that the order was deterring hundreds of qualified teachers from working in New York City.</p>

        <p>More than 1,200 newly certified teachers have turned down jobs in New York City this fall because of a court order that would have forced them to work in the city's lowest-performing schools, according to the schools chancellor, Harold O. Levy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levy disclosed the figure in a sharply worded letter to the state education commissioner, Richard P. Mills, who sued the Board of Education this summer to ensure that only certified teachers would fill vacancies in 94 schools defined as ''failing.'' A resulting court order forced Mr. Levy to comply. In the letter to Mr. Mills, written on Friday, the schools chancellor complained that the order was deterring hundreds of qualified teachers from working in New York City.</p>
        <p>''I remain concerned that while discussions continue, we are rebuffing certified teachers every day,'' Mr. Levy wrote in the letter, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times. ''In a seller's market, it is simply not feasible to require teachers to work where they will not go.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mills said in an interview yesterday that he had no intention of lifting the hiring restrictions, which he said had helped failing schools recruit the certified teachers they desperately needed. Mr. Mills also said that Mr. Levy was interpreting the order incorrectly -- that, in fact, it had not been not intended to prevent nonfailing schools from hiring certified teachers this year.</p>
        <p>''It appears to me that their implementation does not reflect what the judge ordered,'' Mr. Mills said.</p>
        <p>According to Mr. Levy's letter, 1,312 teachers walked away from opportunities to work in low-performing schools in the weeks after the court order was issued on Aug. 24. Of those, about 100 eventually were assigned to regular schools.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levy would not comment on the letter yesterday. But a high-ranking Board of Education official said that the number had been based on interviews with people who expressed interest in teaching positions but withdrew from applying after learning that they would have to work in a low-performing school. Earlier this year, Mr. Levy sent a letter to every certified teacher in the state offering them jobs in city schools.</p>
        <p>Of the 1,312 certified teachers who refused to work in failing schools, 311 had applied for a city teaching license but ''abandoned the process once they learned that they would be required to accept a position'' in a failing school, the letter said.</p>
        <p>An additional 676 certified teachers had expressed preliminary interest in teaching in the city, in interviews at job fairs or in letters or calls to the Board of Education. But they told board officials that they would not accept an assignment in a failing school, according to the letter. Finally, 325 certified teachers accepted jobs in the 94 schools but never showed up, Mr. Levy wrote.</p>
        <p>He also wrote in the letter that he had hoped many of the applicants who refused to teach in low-performing schools would wait until all the vacancies in those schools were filled, so that the city could assign them to regular schools. But as of Oct. 10, he wrote, only about 100 of them had been assigned to regular schools.</p>
        <p>''As a result of having lost these certified teachers,'' Mr. Levy wrote, ''the Board of Education hired fewer certified teachers overall compared with last year.''</p>
        <p>Specifically, he wrote, the school system hired about 600 fewer certified teachers overall this fall than last fall. As of Oct. 10, it hired 2,832 certified teachers and 2,959 uncertified teachers, according to the letter. An additional 1,000 new teachers, who are not yet officially on the payroll, will increase the number of certified teachers but only marginally, board officials said yesterday. Most of the newest employees, they said, are uncertified.</p>
        <p>The Board of Education predicts that it will need to hire an additional 5,000 teachers before the school year is over to fill unexpected vacancies. But Mr. Levy wrote that the court order was severely hampering hiring efforts systemwide because vacancies in regular schools could not be filled with certified teachers unless not a single vacancy existed in a low-performing school.</p>
        <p>But while the court order does require that all vacancies in low-performing elementary schools be filled by certified teachers, it gives the city more wiggle room concerning vacancies in low-performing high schools. The city must fill those vacancies with certified teachers by next fall, but for now it can fill them with uncertified teachers as long as the state approves. That is why Mr. Mills said yesterday that Mr. Levy's complaints were unwarranted.</p>
        <p>''His letter basically describes a system that stops every time there's a vacancy'' in a failing school, Mr. Mills said. ''But the order certainly doesn't require that.''</p>
        <p>However, the high-ranking board official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said yesterday that most vacancies that arise during the school year are in elementary schools, which are required to hire only certified teachers.</p>
        <p>The hiring restrictions for low-performing schools are part of a Regents policy that will require all New York State public schools to hire only certified teachers by 2003. Mr. Levy voted for the policy as a member of the Board of Regents in 1998. He has continued to support the policy publicly since becoming chancellor but has repeatedly warned that it may be impossible to meet the deadline.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mills yesterday defended the order yesterday, calling it ''a reasonable action in response to the city's inaction in staffing the lowest-performing schools with qualified teachers.'' He added, ''It had a very positive effect.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, tucked in Mr. Levy's four-page letter to Mr. Mills was the news that 727 new certified teachers had been hired in the 94 failing schools as of Oct. 10, compared with 438 as of the same date last year. But more than 300 of those new hires are part of a special program called New York City Teaching Fellows, in which the city pays for them to get master's degrees in education and gives them an alternative form of certification on the condition that they work in low-performing schools for at least two years.</p>
        <p>So even despite the court order, the number of new certified teachers who chose to work in low-performing schools this year -- rather than be assigned there through the fellows program -- is about the same as last year, according to Mr. Levy's data.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Levy hopes that an expanded alternative certification program will help him to staff every failing school with certified teachers, he wrote in the letter to Mr. Mills that the only permanent solution would come through collective bargaining with the teachers' union. In other words, he believes that the only way to draw enough certified teachers into failing schools is by offering them higher salaries than they receive under their current contract. That contract expires next month, but serious negotiations with the union have yet to take place. Mr. Mills said yesterday that the city could not afford to wait.</p>
        <p>''The children in the poorest communities and the poorest schools should not have to wait for collective bargaining to take care of the problem,'' he said.</p>
