        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I regret the comments of my physicist colleagues who referred to the achievement of those who won this year's Nobel Prize in Physics as ''an engineering feat, not a scientific one'' and as having ''little to do with fundamental science'' (''3 Men Vital to the Internet Share Nobel Prize in Physics,'' news article, Oct. 11).</p>
        <p>The will of Alfred Nobel reads that the prize should go to ''the person who shall have made the most important discovery or invention within the field of physics.'' That reference to ''invention'' indicates that this year's choice is certainly appropriate. In fact, Nobel awards for inventions are rather rare; recognition of wireless telegraphy and holography are among only a handful awarded for inventions.</p>
        <p>My colleagues' comments do not well serve those of us who pursue fundamental physics. In most cases it is the development of technology that permits the very experiments that advance fundamental science. Congratulations to the Nobel committee as well as this year's recipients!</p>
        <p>JAMES W. CRONIN  Chicago, Oct. 12, 2000</p>
        <p>The writer, professor emeritus at the University of Chicago, was awarded the 1980 Nobel Prize in Physics.</p>
