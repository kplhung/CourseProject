        <p>Sing, Sing, Sing  Bobby Short, Karen Akers and Julie Wilson are among the more than 100 performers lined up for the 11th New York Cabaret Convention. The event, which starts tonight at 6 and continues through Sunday at Town Hall, is sponsored by the Mabel Mercer Foundation, which promotes the art of cabaret. Information: (212) 980-3026.</p>
        <p>Three R's in Art  In the 19th century the evolution of German art through Romanticism, Realism, Expressionism and Symbolism was carried out by artists like Caspar David Friedrich and Wilhelm Leibl. And many talented young Americans brought the influence of such artists home from their studies in Germany. Beginning on Sunday the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston offers a rare chance to view the masterworks of 19th-century German artists. On loan from Houston's sister city, Leipzig, the 89 paintings, drawings, prints and sculptures in ''Romantics, Realists, Revolutionaries: 19th-Century German Masterpieces From the Museum of Fine Arts, Leipzig,'' will be on view through Jan. 28. Information: (713) 639-7300.</p>
        <p>Journey's Beginning  On Oct. 16, 1888, a baby was born in a third-floor room in the Barrett House, an eight-story hotel on the northeast corner of 43rd Street and Broadway. He was Eugene O'Neill, destined before his death in 1953 to win four Pulitzer Prizes and become the only American playwright to win a Nobel Prize in Literature. The Times Square Plaza building, at 1500 Broadway, now occupies the site. At noon today a ceremony will be held to unveil and rededicate the plaque that marks O'Neill's birthplace. First dedicated in 1953 by Circle in the Square but thought lost, the plaque was recently found in the offices of Cushman &amp; Wakefield, the property manager for Times Square Plaza. Participating today under the auspices of the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center will be Theodore Mann, the Circle in the Square producer; Jason Robards, the actor; and Arthur and Barbara Gelb, O'Neill's biographers. Information: (212) 382-2790.</p>
