        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''How to Recruit Police Officers'' (editorial, Oct. 9):</p>
        <p>Police Commissioner Bernard B. Kerik's decision to roll back age and education standards for newly hired police officers in New York City is appalling. The commissioner's action will reverberate far and wide, as the competition for qualified recruits has become very keen all over the state.</p>
        <p>This emergency was foreseeable. It would have been manageable if we had better prepared law enforcement leadership. But we did not.</p>
        <p>A welcome effort is under way to change that. The New York State Association of Chiefs of Police and the State University of New York are putting together a Leadership Institute for Police Executives for the state's 600-plus police executives, each of whom has the same headaches as Commissioner Kerik.</p>

        <p>The writer was an adviser to Gov. Mario M. Cuomo.</p>
