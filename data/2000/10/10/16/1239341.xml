        <p>Family caravans streamed into the capital's downtown today on the eve of a day of ''atonement, reconciliation and responsibility'' proclaimed by Louis Farrakhan, the Nation of Islam leader who organized the Million Man March here five years ago.</p>
        <p>This time Mr. Farrakhan, whom critics denounce as a race-baiter and anti-Semite, has invited marchers from all races and religions to create a Million Family March to bolster family life, which Mr. Farrakhan has been warning is eroding in America.</p>
        <p>''Whenever you have a great society or civilization, as the United States of America, and 50 percent of those who marry get divorced within the first three years, these are signs of the decline of a civilization,'' Mr. Farrakhan contended today on  NBC's ''Meet the Press.''</p>
        <p>Still dogged by controversy for his past denunciations of Jews as ''bloodsuckers'' and organizers of the slave trade, Mr. Farrakhan planned the family march with the cooperation of the Rev. Sun Myung Moon, leader of the Unification Church. Mr. Farrakhan is to preside on the Mall at a mass wedding ceremony of thousands similar to the connubial rallies sponsored by the Unification Church. The dawn-to-dusk march is to close with a speech by Mr. Farrakhan.</p>
        <p>In the television interview, Mr. Farrakhan defended his recent questioning of whether Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, the Democratic vice-presidential nominee, would, as an observant Jew, be more faithful to the Constitution ''than to the ties that any Jewish person would have'' to the state of Israel.</p>
        <p>''I can't regret saying that which is the truth,'' Mr. Farrakhan declared on NBC while insisting once more that Jews control black artists, athletes and other professionals.</p>
        <p>''The Jewish people have that kind of control,'' he maintained in calling for a more equitable and reciprocal relationship rather than ''that paternalistic relationship of the one who has the money to fund black organizations, to fund black newspapers, to fund black magazines so that it quiets our voice.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Farrakhan added, ''When I talk to the Jews, I am talking to the segment of that quorum that holds my people in their grip.''</p>
        <p>City officials prepared for at least 300,000 marchers, while march organizers insisted the million-member call would be met. The Million Man March proved to be a considerable success five years ago as hundreds of thousands of black men gathered from across the nation and  pledged greater solidarity and personal responsibility.</p>
        <p>Mr. Farrakhan's latest call has been greeted with far less wariness than the 1995 march. A wide variety of black entertainment figures are scheduled to perform. The Black Congressional Caucus is planning a dinner gala. Five years ago, some caucus members hesitated to join the day until the large throng affirmed the event as something more than a platform for Mr. Farrakhan.</p>
