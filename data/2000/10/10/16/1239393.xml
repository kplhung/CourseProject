        <p>Yasid Abu Abed, a veteran fighter in Yasir Arafat's wing of the Palestine Liberation Organization, stepped over the chunks of concrete, broken beams, twisted iron reinforcing rods and mangled furniture strewn about his headquarters in Gaza City.</p>
        <p>As he surveyed the wreckage, caused by Israeli missile attacks last week, bodyguards who clutched an eclectic collection of weapons, including American-made M-16 assault rifles and outdated black snub-nosed Russian machine guns, clustered around him.</p>
        <p>Some of his entourage had covered their faces with Palestinian flags or hoods, some wore uniforms and some had strapped web belts with green cartridge cases over their jeans. These motley fighters, members of a Palestinian militia known as the Tanzim, increasingly visible in street demonstrations and gun battles, will perhaps determine whether the battles with Israel continue or come to a halt.</p>
        <p>In the last two weeks, when more than 100 lives, mostly Palestinian, have been lost, the police of the Palestinian Authority -- whether out of sympathy or impotence -- have often watched passively as militia members have fired off bursts toward Israeli positions in spots like the Netzarim junction in the Gaza Strip or the city of Ramallah in the West Bank.</p>
        <p>The bursts of fire, uncommon in the intifada -- the Palestinian uprising that began in 1987 and ended after the Oslo accord of 1993 -- have often drawn a withering, sometimes deadly, Israeli response.</p>
        <p>''I do not have much hope,'' Mr. Abu Abed said today, nodding to men who called him general. ''The only thing I am getting ready is my coffin.''</p>
        <p>''When I saw the Israeli helicopters attack our headquarters I felt proud,'' he said, referring to the assault on Thursday that followed the killing of two Israeli soldiers by Palestinians in Ramallah. ''It stripped away the mask of the Israeli war machine, one that has killed so many of our people and our leaders. I knew the final battle had begun.''</p>
        <p>The formation of militias -- authorized by the leadership of Al Fatah, the largest component group of the Palestine Liberation Organization -- troubles many Israeli leaders.</p>
        <p>They have asked Mr. Arafat, who heads Al Fatah as well as the P.L.O. as a whole, to disarm the militias. Israel's acting foreign minister, Shlomo Ben-Ami, accuses the Tanzim of spearheading violent clashes in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. He has questioned whether Mr. Arafat has, or wants, control over the activities of those units.</p>
        <p>Fatah leaders have said the militias will be deployed to provide protection from the 200,000 or so Israeli settlers in the West Bank and Gaza, many of whom are armed.</p>
        <p>Most of those joining the Tanzim were members of the Fatah Hawks, a group that was formed during the Israeli occupation of those territories. It was disbanded after the Oslo peace accord was signed.</p>
        <p>The re-emergence of the militias, which have joined forces with a host of other armed factions, including the one run by the Islamic militant group Hamas, has become one of the morale-raising displays of force by Palestinians. As many as 200 to 300 fighters have paraded daily through the dusty streets in Gaza vowing to liberate Palestine, and by all appearances they have no shortage of guns.</p>
        <p>In 1993 groups of Fatah Hawks used to share a pistol or an AK-47, often seeming to spend most of their time holding it for photographs. Now guns, some of them antiquated, are much more common and are being used against the Israelis.</p>
        <p>The Palestinian Authority was permitted by Israel to obtain some light weapons, but many more have been smuggled in from Jordan, Egypt and even Israel, Palestinian militia leaders say.</p>
        <p>Like other militia members, Rayad Zaid, 21, has spent most of his life fighting Israelis. As a child during the intifada he often missed school to stone Israeli soldiers on patrol.</p>
        <p>He has been wounded three times in the leg with live fire and carries a scar in his forehead from a rubber-coated bullet. His father spent 13 years in Israeli jails. His mother, an asthmatic, died when he was 11 after inhaling tear gas. He said he joined the Fatah Hawks nine years ago.</p>
        <p>''I will make any sacrifice for my people and my country,'' he said in the Jabaliya refugee camp, ''and I will strap explosives on my body and blow myself up to attack the Israelis if it is required.''</p>
        <p>A large rally by hundreds of armed militia members from nearly a dozen factions is scheduled for Monday, just as the Israeli and Palestinian leaders are to meet President Clinton and other mediators in Egypt. In a march in the Jabaliya refugee camp on Saturday night, a few hundred members of the Tanzim joined forces with other radical factions like Islamic Holy War -- all part of the high-voltage grid of competing armed groups that Mr. Arafat placates and plays off against one another.</p>
        <p>The young men squeezed the triggers of their weapons, pointed in the air, unleashing deafening blasts as the crowd cheered and clapped.</p>
        <p>''We know that the Israelis have powerful weapons,'' said Mr. Abu Abed, who spent five years in Israeli jails, ''but we are willing to take losses they would never accept. Hezbollah, with little more than light weapons, drove Israel out of Lebanon. We, with nothing more than rocks, forced them to return part of our land. With our guns, we are ready to liberate all of Palestine and our capital, holy Jerusalem.''</p>
