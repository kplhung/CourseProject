        <p>A pop review on Tuesday about the country singer Merle Haggard misstated the day of his appearance at Irving Plaza. It was Oct. 8, not last Monday. The review also misstated the title of his new album and its lead song. It is ''If I Could Only Fly,'' by Blaze Foley, not ''I Wish I Could Fly.''</p>
