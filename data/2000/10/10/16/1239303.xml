        <p>Devolution has become popular in Britain in recent years. Not only do Scotland and Wales have their own parliaments, they also have their own bridge teams in international competition, as does England.</p>
        <p>This came into operation for the first time at the world championships last month at Maastricht in the Netherlands, and the devolved teams did rather well. England finished fourth in the open series, losing to the United States in a playoff for the bronze medals. The Scottish women's team came within a hair of reaching the quarterfinal of its event, losing by just 7 imps in the round of 16 to the American team that eventually took the title.</p>
        <p>A Welsh player, Tim Rees, reached a sensible slam on the diagramed deal but was outwitted by his Tunisian opponent. He should perhaps have bid the six-spade slam directly when he received a spade preference. The chance of a sound grand slam contract was remote, and his four no-trump bid, seldom a good move holding a void suit, gave East a chance to double the five-heart response. West now knew what to lead. After a black-suit lead, South would have had an easy time. An unlikely diamond lead, however, puts the defense in control, because East can continue diamonds when he wins the spade king, cutting South's communications.</p>
        <p>South won the heart lead and led the spade queen, finessing. He would have been happy if this had lost to the king, for dummy's spade ace can deal with another heart lead. The declarer cannot be prevented from drawing trumps and running diamonds.</p>
        <p>But Hassouna ben Abdelmalek for Tunisia refused to take his king, a shrewd move. Now there was nothing South could do. There was no way to draw trumps without permitting the defense to score at least one heart trick, and the slam failed. Tunisia, which had rested safely in four spades in the other room, gained 11 imps.</p>
        <p>In the post-mortem South discovered that he could have made his slam by ruffing two hearts in the dummy. This succeeds because East has no more hearts to lead when he eventually wins the spade king. Which play is right in theory is hard to say. The ruffing plan requires the defender with the spade king to be short in hearts. The immediate trump play requires a doubleton king somewhere or a defensive error, with a slight extra chance that a defender holds a tripleton trump king plus four diamonds.</p>
