        <p>Warren Spears's ''Black'' is an intriguing dance: subtle and larger than life and full of flashes of dark light that may or may not be ironic. Presented by the Dayton Contemporary Dance Company on Saturday afternoon at the Joyce Theater, this 1989 piece drops three men and three women into a deserted party room on a summer night, then settles back to watch the action.</p>
        <p>The place is Detroit, according to program notes, and the time is the summer of 1968. The sounds of gunshots and sirens blast into the room, eventually replaced by hit rock music of the time.</p>

        <p>Warren Spears's ''Black'' is an intriguing dance: subtle and larger than life and full of flashes of dark light that may or may not be ironic. Presented by the Dayton Contemporary Dance Company on Saturday afternoon at the Joyce Theater, this 1989 piece drops three men and three women into a deserted party room on a summer night, then settles back to watch the action.</p>
        <p>The place is Detroit, according to program notes, and the time is the summer of 1968. The sounds of gunshots and sirens blast into the room, eventually replaced by hit rock music of the time.</p>
        <p>The men eye the women. The women eye the men. They sit alone and dance together, then brutally split. They reunite, but nothing is the same. Outside the gunfire erupts again.</p>
        <p>Mr. Spears, who danced with Alvin Ailey and has choreographed for his own company and the New Danish Dance Theater in Copenhagen, has a feel for fast-paced and imaginative staging. But the greatest fascination of ''Black'' is the ways he uses cliches of recent modern dance by black American choreographers with a knowing affection and respect that makes them fresh.</p>
        <p>The three women might be the sisters of the world-weary, slightly foolish singers in Ailey's ''Quintet.'' The male bonding is also familiar.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Spears's men talk to one another and the women are believably hungry for love. The ending is a little melodramatic, but that might be the ultimate irony of ''Black.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Spears keeps his audience guessing as it parties along. The performers -- Julius Brewster Jr., Ricardo J. Garcia Cruz, the lovably gangly Greer A. Reed, David Reuille, Sheri Williams and Monnette Michiyo Bariel, who has one of the most stylish faces in dance -- maintain the tricky balance between the familiar and the new with impressive grace.</p>
        <p>Also new on the program was a duet from Kevin Ward's 1999 ''Job's Kitchen,'' danced to his own music. Mr. Ward became artistic director of the Dayton troupe following the death last year of its founder, Jeraldyne Blunden.</p>
        <p>The duet says a lot about Mr. Ward's skills as a choreographer and also about Blunden's extraordinary warmth and endearing practicality.</p>
        <p>Short and to the point yet psychologically astute, the duet suggests how hard it can be for love to grow, even in the most fertile earth. G. D. Harris's every move was informed by an unconditional love from which DeShona Pepper must walk away in a dance that rises only fitfully from the floor.</p>
        <p>The program opened and closed with bursts of giddy glory, beginning with Mr. Ward's ''Sets and Chasers'' and ending with ''Children of the Passage,'' choreographed by Donald McKaye and Ronald K. Brown and danced to music composed and performed live by the irresistible Dirty Dozen Brass Band.</p>
        <p>Lucky Dayton.</p>
