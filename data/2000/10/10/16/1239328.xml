        <p>When demand for new stocks wanes, investment bankers look for ways to repackage and sell stocks that are already on the market. In that regard, Epoch Partners, while billing itself as a new breed of investment bank, is taking a page from the Wall Street playbook.</p>
        <p>Epoch, a fledgling firm in San Francisco conceived by executives of the Charles Schwab Corporation, has gained attention for its efforts to distribute more shares of initial public offerings of stock to individual investors. Now, Epoch wants to create exchange-traded baskets of stocks for sale to customers of Schwab and the Ameritrade online brokerage firm.</p>
        <p>''We are not just an I.P.O. shop,'' said Scott Ryles, Epoch's chief executive. Mr. Ryles, who was an investment banker at Merrill Lynch &amp; Company before he joined Epoch, said the firm intended to offer a range of securities that could be sold to institutions and individual investors.</p>
        <p>Schwab, Ameritrade and another online brokerage firm, TD Waterhouse, own stakes in Epoch, giving Epoch access to several million investors with about $1.5 trillion in assets, Mr. Ryles said. He declined to discuss the proposed baskets, a form of exchange-traded fund, before they were approved for sale.</p>
        <p>The baskets would be called New Era Trust Securities, or Nets, and would trade on the American Stock Exchange, according to a registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Epoch is proposing that the first offering of Nets, which would probably  contain shares of about 20 companies in a particular industry, would raise about $10 million.</p>
        <p>Customers of Schwab and Ameritrade would pay about $5,000 for each lot of 100 Nets. About $100 of that amount, or 2 percent, would be an underwriting fee collected by Epoch, which would also trade to acquire the underlying shares.</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman for TD Waterhouse said that company was not prepared to be involved at the time of the filing but expected to have a role in offerings of Nets, either as an underwriter or distributor.</p>
        <p>Nets appear to be modeled on a batch of popular products called Holdrs that Merrill Lynch created and sold and for which it is seeking patent protection. Investors have more than $9 billion invested in 14 types of Holdrs, including biotechnology Holdrs and Internet Holdrs. Most of those products have been introduced over the last year, and most of them have lost at least 10 percent of their value this year.</p>
        <p>Like Holdrs, Nets would represent claims on shares of preselected stocks in baskets assembled by the underwriters. After their initial sale, they would be listed for continuous trading on the exchange and their owners would have the option of exchanging them for shares of the underlying stocks.</p>
        <p>In its registration statement, Epoch cites several reasons why it might decide to liquidate Nets and return money to investors. One of them is ''patent infringement claims arising from similar financial products originated by unaffiliated third parties.''</p>
        <p>A Merrill spokesman declined to comment on the firm's reaction to Epoch's plans.</p>
