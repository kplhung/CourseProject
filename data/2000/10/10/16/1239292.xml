        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''As Homework Load Grows, One District Says 'Enough' '' (front page, Oct. 10):</p>
        <p>I feel sorry for the children who will have no homework or a reduced level of homework in some school districts. These students will spend a year of college just trying to figure out how to study and catching up on material they should otherwise have known.</p>
        <p>It's especially sad that the reason they won't have homework is that some of their parents are too busy or too lazy to help, which, when you get down to it, is the real problem.</p>
        <p>And to the parents who have been finishing their children's homework for them: Remember, homework is not for you, it's for your kids. Answer an occasional question, or solve an example. But please don't do their work for them.</p>
