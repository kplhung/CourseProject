        <p>Today's emergency summit meeting in Sharm el Sheik, Egypt, will have to overcome long odds even to achieve agreement on restoring calm in Israel, the West Bank and Gaza. More than two weeks of bloodshed have hardened attitudes and pulverized trust between Israelis and Palestinians. It is hard at this point to imagine going further and resuming progress toward a negotiated peace. But the fact that Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel and Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, will be meeting, along with President Clinton and other international figures, is cause for muted optimism.</p>
        <p>All of the participants have a strong interest in halting the violence. Kofi Annan, the United Nations  secretary general, deserves credit for helping to bring the parties together. Though a relatively new factor in Mideast diplomacy, he has thus far been a constructive one. The Palestinians hope that he might be sympathetic to their concerns. But Israel is also open to greater U.N. involvement.</p>

        <p>Today's emergency summit meeting in Sharm el Sheik, Egypt, will have to overcome long odds even to achieve agreement on restoring calm in Israel, the West Bank and Gaza. More than two weeks of bloodshed have hardened attitudes and pulverized trust between Israelis and Palestinians. It is hard at this point to imagine going further and resuming progress toward a negotiated peace. But the fact that Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel and Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, will be meeting, along with President Clinton and other international figures, is cause for muted optimism.</p>
        <p>All of the participants have a strong interest in halting the violence. Kofi Annan, the United Nations  secretary general, deserves credit for helping to bring the parties together. Though a relatively new factor in Mideast diplomacy, he has thus far been a constructive one. The Palestinians hope that he might be sympathetic to their concerns. But Israel is also open to greater U.N. involvement.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak comes to the meeting knowing that Israel's parliament, when it convenes at the end of this month, is likely to press for new elections or a new coalition including hawkish right-wing parties. Mr. Barak has already invited Ariel Sharon, the Likud leader, into a temporary unity government. Mr. Sharon has so far declined. A credible agreement on halting the violence would give Mr. Barak more freedom of action over the next two weeks.</p>
        <p>Mr. Arafat showed some flexibility by consenting to go to Egypt without prior agreement to his demand for an international commission of inquiry on the violence, although he is expected to raise that demand again at Sharm el Sheik. Mr. Arafat's commitment to peace seems uncertain, and many Israelis now suspect that he would rather proclaim Palestinian statehood than negotiate it, inviting further clashes between Palestinians and the Israeli Army. The summit meeting is likely to turn on his willingness to bring hostilities to an end.</p>
        <p>The meeting's host, Hosni Mubarak, the Egyptian president, knows that continued violence could destabilize Egypt. He also understands that Cairo's stature in the Arab world largely depends on expanding the peacemaking with Israel begun by Anwar el-Sadat two decades ago. His peacemaking efforts have been aided by King Abdullah of Jordan, who has been quick to assume the enlightened role played by his father, King Hussein.</p>
        <p>The meeting is also crucial for the United States, and Mr. Clinton personally. America's security interests are deeply involved in the Mideast. Mr. Clinton has invested seven years of his presidency in laborious efforts to achieve peace between Israelis and Palestinians. The recent events have unraveled much of what he achieved. But in his final months in office Mr. Clinton still has an important role to play in containing the conflict and preserving the possibility of future peace.</p>
        <p>Sharm el Sheik can begin that process if Mr. Barak and especially Mr. Arafat commit themselves to ending the violence and relying exclusively on negotiations in shaping the long-term peace. To give substance to those pledges, Mr. Arafat should rearrest the dozens of violent Islamic militants he released last week, order his followers to pull back from further confrontations and see to it that the Palestinian police are no longer passive bystanders or participants in combat but a force for restraint. Mr. Barak should reciprocate by withdrawing Israeli tanks from Palestinian population centers. With good will, and an absence of new clashes between Palestinians and Israelis as the leaders meet, it may be possible to establish a durable truce.</p>
