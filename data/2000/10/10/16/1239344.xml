        <p>In the wee hours every weeknight, Alan Cohen sits hunched over his computer in his cluttered third-floor Treasury Department office, tapping out what many in his trade consider to be the daily bible of the budget wars in Washington.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cohen is a revered if slightly eccentric budget analyst extraordinaire who works for Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers.</p>
        <p>Overnight, he puts out a snappy summary of the day's budget highlights that is a must-read for senior Treasury officials before their 8:30 a.m. senior staff meeting at the White House.</p>
        <p>With administration and Congressional negotiators hoping to put the finishing touches on budget and tax deals later this week, this is Mr. Cohen's season to shine. As a consummate senior aide toiling in the trenches -- and every Cabinet secretary has at least one -- Mr. Cohen arms his bosses with the facts, figures and inside information they need to wage the bureaucratic battles of the day.</p>
        <p>''He's one of the real insightful guys behind the scenes,'' Mr. Summers said. ''And because he is insightful, he's influential.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cohen's summary, usually two to four pages long and prosaically titled ''Today's Update,'' typically contains a pithy status of spending bills, remarks from top officials and Mr. Cohen's succinct analysis of arcane budget issues and processes that he has mastered over two decades in government.</p>
        <p>He has been writing them since early last year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cohen said he collected items for his summary throughout the day, poring over several publications and the Internet, and then filling in gaps with phone calls to budget sources around town. ''It's a combination of policy, process and the political world,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Treasury officials say they rely on Mr. Cohen to interpret everything from the latest Congressional Budget Office surplus estimates to a new proposal for Social Security to political infighting among key members of the Senate and House Appropriations committees.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cohen sends his summary by electronic mail to about 30 top Treasury officials (except Mr. Summers, who has his report faxed to his home), but bootleg printouts enjoy a surprising circulation inside the department.</p>
        <p>There's nothing confidential in his memos (Mr. Cohen sends his most sensitive remarks in a separate eyes-only memo to Mr. Summers or Deputy Secretary Stuart E. Eizenstat). Nonetheless, Mr. Cohen expressed disappointment that an outsider had learned of their existence, and agreed to let a reporter view a few recent copies only on the condition that their contents would not be published.</p>
        <p>For this reason it's no wonder that Mr. Cohen is virtually anonymous outside the budget cognoscenti in the administration and on Capitol Hill.</p>
        <p>''Alan is a budget genius,'' said Robert E. Rubin, the former treasury secretary, who recalled at least one time when Mr. Cohen bailed him out of a tricky budget problem hours before he had to testify before Congress.</p>
        <p>Rubbing shoulders with cabinet secretaries aside, Mr. Cohen, a heavyset, bespectacled, 50-year-old bachelor, is hardly your typical civil servant.</p>
        <p>His marathon work hours are legendary. ''Because I'm often up late, I'm often the receiver of a midnight call from Alan Cohen, who's realized a major flaw in a Republican budget document or a major procedural move that we'd missed at an earlier meeting,'' said Gene Sperling, the White House's economic policy director.</p>
        <p>Legendary, too, is Mr. Cohen's office, which colleagues say is stacked with mountains of papers, books and other detritus of a self-proclaimed ''budget wonk'' who hates to throw anything away. (Mr. Cohen refused to show a visitor his office, just down the hall from Mr. Summers's suite, saying he was ''too embarrassed. It's a total mess.'')</p>
        <p>Born and raised in Manhattan, Mr. Cohen earned a bachelor's degree in physics from Grinnell College in Iowa, followed soon after by a master's degree in public policy from the University of Michigan and a doctorate in economics from the University of Wisconsin.</p>
        <p>He spent four years at the Health and Human Services Department working on anti-poverty programs before moving in 1983 to Capitol Hill, where he was a staffer for nine years on the Senate Budget and Finance committees.</p>
        <p>When President Clinton tapped Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, the Finance Committee chairman, to be treasury secretary in 1993, Mr. Bentsen brought Mr. Cohen with him.</p>
        <p>Now serving his third secretary, Mr. Cohen said his insider's job has given him the perfect perch from which to negotiate official Washington: ''One thing I've learned here is that it's hard to be successful in the policy world unless you understand and work in the political dimension.''</p>
