        <p>The doctor at the central blood bank advised Nagwa Omar not to donate because she is breast-feeding her fourth child. But the 37-year-old university professor was adamant.</p>
        <p>''I insist,'' Dr. Omar said, as she rolled up her sleeve today, offering her right arm to the nurse who would draw her blood. ''If I could even go to Palestine to fight, I would.''</p>
        <p>In the last two and a half weeks, as television stations, newspapers and mosque preachers have bombarded the Arab public with images of Palestinians dying in clashes with Israelis, a surge of popular anger has mobilized thousands of people to do and act in similar fashion.</p>
        <p>The new sense of social engagement evident in Arab countries from Egypt to the Persian Gulf seems to reach far beyond the anti-Israeli and anti-American street demonstrations that have become near-daily occurrences and which can be stage-managed, either by governments or political movements.</p>
        <p>The recent violence, in which nearly 100 people, most of them Palestinians, have died, has aroused passion and fury that have embraced even normally apolitical middle-class people like Dr. Omar, a teacher of comparative literature at Ain Shams University in Cairo.</p>
        <p>She had donated blood only once before, as a student 20 years ago during a Health Ministry drive on campus. She volunteered today, she said, because Israel ''provoked our religious feelings.''</p>
        <p>Some 200 Egyptians have been coming to the Red Crescent Society blood bank each day. Cairo parents bring their children to hospitals to shake the hands of wounded Palestinians brought here for treatment. In Jidda, Saudi Arabia, where women rarely involve themselves in public activities, a group of veiled women from the city's richest families walked through the streets in a silent anti-Israeli procession after midday prayers on Friday. Business owners in several countries have pledged to donate part of their revenues for the next month to Palestinian aid groups.</p>
        <p>For the most part, careful Arab governments have monitored the anger and tried to ride it. The Egyptian authorities have set up a government bank account to receive donations for Palestinians. In gulf countries, which expelled Palestinian residents at the time of the Persian Gulf war nine years ago, kings and princes have pledged millions of dollars to Palestinian aid groups. In Jordan, where more than half the population is Palestinian in origin, some mosque preachers have declared that waging war on Jews and on Israel is a religious duty. The Jordanian prime minister has met with anti-Israeli protesters to declare his sympathy.</p>
        <p>The popular anger has been fueled not only by horror. Satellite television, virtually nonexistent in the self-contained Arab world 13 years ago when the first Palestinian intifada, or uprising, began, now brings pictures of the bloodshed into Arab living rooms 24 hours a day.</p>
        <p>To a degree, the anger is also fed by misinformation, by deep-seated suspicion of Jews in general, and by frustration at the disarray and fractiousness of the Arab world.</p>
        <p>''This is one opportunity for people to say we are all Arabs,'' said Bassma Kodmani, a political analyst who works for the Ford Foundation in Cairo. ''And what also comes up is frustration with their own governments.''</p>
        <p>The sense of rage is deeply colored by religious feelings that were aroused by the visit of Ariel Sharon, a right-wing Israeli leader, to the plaza in the Old City of Jerusalem that contains Al Aksa Mosque and the Dome of the Rock, two of the most revered sites in Islam.</p>
        <p>The compound, called by Muslims the Noble Sanctuary and by Jews the Temple Mount, sits on top of the remnants of the main synagogue of ancient Jerusalem, the Second Temple, a site revered by Jews.</p>
        <p>Some militant Jews in Israel do talk of building a temple where Al Aksa and the Dome of the Rock now stand, and they sell architects' renderings of what it would look like in shops in the Old City. Since Mr. Sharon's visit, mosque preachers have treated that vision as a real threat.</p>
        <p>''Without the religious factor, Arabs would have put up with more stalling for three more years,'' said Musa Keilani, editor of Al Urdon, a Jordanian newspaper. ''But this incident reminded people of the old theory that the Jews were going to destroy the mosques and build the Third Temple there.''</p>
        <p>Last week, for instance, a prayer leader in the Saudi Arabian city of Medina, one of the holiest cities of Islam, railed against what he called ''the Jewish conspiracy'' to destroy Al Aksa.</p>
        <p>''Its sanctity has been violated, its walls burned, the blood of worshipers has been spilled in its courtyard and the emotions of Muslims have been provoked by brutal tyrants,'' said the Medina sheik, Abdulbari bin Awad al-Thebeiti.</p>
        <p>Such accusations -- that Israelis conspire to destroy the Muslim sites or that an Israeli hard-liner penetrated one of Islam's holiest mosques -- resonate in all segments of Arab society. Both government and opposition newspapers in Egypt, Jordan and other countries write that Mr. Sharon entered Al Aksa, when he actually walked around, heavily protected, outside it.</p>
        <p>''Our sheik says that Jews are burning Korans and burning Al Aksa Mosque,'' said Yasir Garbawy, a 26-year-old kindergarten director from a Cairo suburb who came to the blood bank today to offer his help.</p>
        <p>Many of the Arabs who have flocked to donate blood, money and sympathy to the Palestinians express what they call their disgust at the Israelis and the peace effort.</p>
        <p>Ahmed Farid Seif has been doing business with Israel since 1986, importing Israeli-made irrigation equipment to Egypt. Now, he said, many of his Egyptian customers have canceled their orders.</p>
        <p>''They say they want any other product but not an Israeli product,'' he said. He depends for his news on many Western and English-language sources, like CNN and the BBC, and said he based his own shock at the recent bloodletting on a measured view of reality. ''Anyone even watching those will get angry,'' Mr. Seif said. ''It's the attitudes of the Israeli authorities, so arrogant and aggressive.''</p>
        <p>He will continue to import equipment, he said, and he will not stoop to turning his back on his Israeli acquaintances. ''You don't change toward the people you've known for a long time,'' Mr. Seif said, ''but you can't help changing toward the people and the situation in general.''</p>
