        <p>As global leaders move toward welcoming Serbia into the community of Western nations, the White House is considering the issue of aid to Belgrade's fledgling democratic government. The urgent question, as Congress heads toward adjournment, is whether to tie such aid to the prosecution of Serbia's war criminals.</p>
        <p>Both the European Union and the United States have moved swiftly to reward the Serbian people for their ouster of Slobodan Milosevic by taking steps to recognize President Vojislav Kostunica and resume normal diplomatic relations with Belgrade. Steps have also been taken to lift the embargoes on oil and civilian flights and to meet urgent humanitarian needs in Yugoslavia.</p>

        <p>As global leaders move toward welcoming Serbia into the community of Western nations, the White House is considering the issue of aid to Belgrade's fledgling democratic government. The urgent question, as Congress heads toward adjournment, is whether to tie such aid to the prosecution of Serbia's war criminals.</p>
        <p>Both the European Union and the United States have moved swiftly to reward the Serbian people for their ouster of Slobodan Milosevic by taking steps to recognize President Vojislav Kostunica and resume normal diplomatic relations with Belgrade. Steps have also been taken to lift the embargoes on oil and civilian flights and to meet urgent humanitarian needs in Yugoslavia.</p>
        <p>The Serbian people -- exhausted by war, corruption, inflation and unemployment -- deserve such political and economic rewards. But further support, directly or through the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, should hinge on Belgrade's willingness to surrender war criminals harbored in Serbia to the International Tribunal at The Hague. Those indicted -- including Slobodan Milosevic, Ratko Mladic, Radovan Karadzic and Milan Milutinovic -- must be held accountable for the atrocities that scar lives and landscapes from Srebenica to Suva Reka.</p>
        <p>The European Union and the Clinton administration are equivocating on whether further aid should be linked to Belgrade's surrendering these men to the tribunal. They are wrong to do so. The failure to hand over these suspected war criminals will decapitate the tribunal's efforts and set back the cause of international humanitarian law. The extradition of Mr. Milosevic and his cronies is also crucial to building trust in Serbia's neighboring governments.</p>
        <p>Indeed, such trust is fundamental to stability in the region -- and the only sure basis for an exit strategy for American troops. Kosovars, Montenegrins, Albanians and Macedonians have ample reason to be concerned about the durability of any agreements with Belgrade as long as Mr. Milosevic lurks in the shadows.</p>
        <p>Serbia must soon come to terms with these neighbors: Belgrade must end its support of those who have undermined the full integration of Bosnia Herzegovina. Mr. Kostunica's government must also assure regional leaders, especially in Kosovo, that it will respect the aspirations and political rights of minorities.</p>
        <p>If Mr. Kostunica and his coalition partners advance on such a course and comply with the war crimes tribunal, the United States and Europe should be generous with aid to help rebuild Serbia's tattered economy. Serbia's membership in international and regional organizations should also be on the agenda.</p>
        <p>History will be unkind and unforgiving in judging us if we fail to support the work of the war crimes tribunal at this critical time. The European Union, the Clinton administration and Congress should set a course that brings a democratic Serbia into Europe while affirming a collective commitment to international law and justice.</p>
