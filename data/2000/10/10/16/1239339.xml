        <p>HASAN ABDEL RAHMAN, the de facto Palestinian ambassador to the United States, understands the power that a single photograph can wield. When he thinks of the Vietnam War, he says, ''I am always reminded of that image of the young Vietnamese girl running down the street after being burned by the napalm.''</p>
        <p>So in explaining the violence that has pushed the Middle East back to the brink of war, Mr. Abdel Rahman found an early ally in the camera's lens, especially in the haunting image of a 12-year-old Palestinian boy slumped against his father after the boy was shot and killed last month by Israeli soldiers in the Gaza Strip.</p>
        <p>Mr. Abdel Rahman, who has been the Washington representative of the Palestine Liberation Organization and Palestinian National Authority since 1994, said he received more than 100 phone calls about the photograph of the dead boy, many from Jewish Americans who wanted ''to express their shame.''</p>
        <p>But the camera is fickle, and on Friday Mr. Abdel Rahman picked up his newspaper with well-justified trepidation. Splashed across the front page was another horrifying photo, this one of a Palestinian man with his hands in the air, apparently dripping with the blood of an Israeli soldier murdered on the West Bank.</p>
        <p>''It was awful,'' Mr. Abdel Rahman said. ''Nobody in his right mind would accept the lynching of another human being.''</p>
        <p>But while the photograph is being cited by some Israelis and their American supporters as proof of Palestinian savagery, Mr. Abdel Rahman said he saw something else in the image of the man with bloodstained hands.</p>
        <p>''I'm not trying to justify it,'' he said. ''But I felt very sorry for him, and I'll tell you why. I think the Israelis have turned our young people into this 32 years of occupation.'' He said the result of ''this culture of violence'' is a young man ''who is so mad, so angry, so frustrated, that he's capable of doing something like this.''</p>
        <p>For now, Mr. Abdel Rahman seems to be losing the battle for support among Americans who make and influence Middle East policy. He sat at his desk beneath a large framed photograph of Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, and patted a stack of clippings, many of them newspaper editorials blaming Mr. Arafat for the bloodshed.</p>
        <p>''I feel a sense of frustration that all of this seems to be orchestrated in such a way to put the blame on the Palestinian Authority and on Chairman Arafat,'' he said. ''I read what is being written. And it's very superficial and unfair.''</p>
        <p>''Yes, there were two Israelis killed,'' he said of the soldiers who were stabbed and stomped to death after their car turned into the funeral procession for a Palestinian man killed by Israelis earlier in the week.</p>
        <p>''But you also have to remember there were 100 Palestinians killed over the last two weeks,'' he said. ''The Israelis have made a declaration of war against the Palestinians. What is war? When you use tanks, when you use helicopters, when you use mortars.''</p>
        <p>While Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel may have gone further than his predecessors in pursuit of peace, his offers ''still fall short of what is necessary to reach an agreement,'' Mr. Abdel Rahman said. ''We cannot live with what he has offered us.''</p>
        <p>''We are not here to assess the character of Mr. Barak,'' he continued. ''The kind of agreement we need to reach with Israel has to be a good agreement that future generations of Palestinians and Israelis can live with, not one custom-tailored to suit Mr. Barak's needs.''</p>
        <p>This compact, intense 56-year-old Palestinian is used to being outgunned in the battles of public relations.</p>
        <p>His staff of nine works in a small suite of offices in a nondescript building near the White House. His ''adversary,'' as he calls it, is the large Israeli Embassy and its lobbying and press operation. ''I am not supported by the network that Mr. Barak has,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Abdel Rahman has lived nearly half his life in the United States. The fifth of nine children of a West Bank farmer, he said he left home as a teenager in search of adventure and wound up in Rio de Janeiro. ''I loved Latin America, Latin culture,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He said he wanted to learn Spanish (he is fluent in both Spanish and Portuguese, the language of Brazil) and was accepted for studies at the Catholic University of Puerto Rico. In 1972, he left for the United States, where he was a doctoral candidate in politics at the City University of New York.</p>
        <p>GLOBAL politics interrupted his studies in 1974, when he was hired by the P.L.O. to help prepare for a visit by Mr. Arafat to the United Nations. When the organization received formal observer status later that year, Mr. Abdel Rahman became its deputy representative in New York.</p>
        <p>At a time when the word Palestinian was often equated with the word terrorist, Mr. Abdel Rahman learned firsthand of the potential threat when his offices on Park Avenue were attacked in October 1974 by a group of Jewish American extremists. ''I had a few stitches in my head,'' he said, rubbing the area on his scalp where he was hit.</p>
        <p>It is a sign of how much has changed for Palestinians and for Mr. Abdel Rahman that today he is married to an American-born lawyer of Lebanese descent, and that their four children, aged 14 to 21, consider themselves dual citizens and proudly carry American passports.</p>
        <p>''They live in America, they were born in America, they are as American as any other kids,'' he said. ''But they are still Palestinians.'' And not once, he said, have the children been taunted over their Palestinian roots. ''No, they are very assertive,'' he said. Like their father, he said, ''they wouldn't take nonsense from anyone.''</p>
