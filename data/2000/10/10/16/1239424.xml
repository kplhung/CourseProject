        <p>THE CUB BECOMES A HISTORIC TIGER  David Splithoff became the first freshman to start at quarterback in Princeton's 132-year history. He completed 13 of 17 passes for 289 yards and 3 touchdowns to lead the Tigers to a 55-28 victory over Brown.</p>
        <p>BY AIR, BY GROUND  Air Force scored on five of its first six possessions in a 51-34 victory over Wyoming. The Falcons rolled up 625 yards, including 432 rushing, and Mike Thiessen ran for four touchdowns and threw for another. The Falcons did not punt until 6:16 remained in the third quarter.</p>
        <p>FREQUENT FLYERS  Chris Weinke threw for a school-record 536 yards and 5 touchdowns as Florida State beat Duke, 63-14.  J.T. O'Sullivan passed for 439 yards and 5 touchdowns as Cal-Davis beat Southern Utah, 56-20.  Mike Cerchio completed 29 of 49 passes for 410 yards and 3 touchdowns to lead Fairfield's 24-10 victory over St. Peter's.  Dan Pincelli threw for 6 touchdowns and 420 yards to power Hartwick to a 57-19 victory over Alfred.</p>
        <p>THE PAST IS PRESENT, Part I  Barry Switzer, the former Oklahoma and Dallas Cowboys coach, was on the sideline for the Sooners' 41-31 victory over Kansas State, and the current players appreciated it.  ''It was a great feeling,'' safety Roy Williams said. ''After I got my interception, I looked to the sideline and I see Coach Barry Switzer right in my face saying, 'Good job.' That was a good feeling having one of the greatest coaches in college history say 'good job' to you.''</p>
        <p>Part II  Minnesota had not beaten Ohio State in Columbus since 1949 -- until Saturday, when Glen Mason, who played and coached under Woody Hayes, led the Golden Gophers to a 29-17 victory. Minnesota is in a four-way tie for the top spot in the Big Ten at 3-1.  ''Before you even ask, 'Is it more meaningful to me because it's here?' sure it is,'' Mason said. ''I have great feelings for this university. If Ohio State wouldn't have recruited me out of Jersey and given me a scholarship, and if Coach Hayes hadn't hired me to come back and coach, I probably wouldn't be sitting here today as head coach at the University of Minnesota.</p>
        <p>''I'm deeply indebted to this place. I have a lot of memories about this place, a lot of memories, very good memories. When we were riding in the bus coming down High Street today, I had tears in my eyes. I don't make any bones about it. They trained me well here.''</p>
        <p>SATURDAY IN AND SATURDAY OUT, THE FUNNIEST COACH IN AMERICA  ''I looked at those suckers again and I looked at my arms. I thought I might be out there all day.'' -- South Carolina Coach Lou Holtz of his promise to personally tear down the goal posts if the Gamecocks beat Arkansas. They did, 27-7, to go to 6-1.</p>
