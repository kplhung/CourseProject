        <p>Hillary Rodham Clinton urged Bronx and Harlem churchgoers yesterday to pray for peace in the Middle East, while her opponent, Rick A.

        <p>Hillary Rodham Clinton urged Bronx and Harlem churchgoers yesterday to pray for peace in the Middle East, while her opponent, Rick A. Lazio, stumped for votes in western New York, visiting tailgaters assembled for a Buffalo Bills game and Italian-Americans gathered in Geneva for a lasagna dinner in his honor.</p>
        <p>The contrasting schedules illustrated once again the two campaigns' strategies. Mrs. Clinton has spent four of the last five Sundays at predominantly black churches, working to generate a large turnout among black voters. Mr. Lazio, meanwhile, invested his seventh day in upstate and western New York, seeking to shore up his support in the state's more conservative, and predominantly white, corners.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton, in discussing Middle East affairs yesterday, was careful not to interject herself too much into her husband's dealings. Yes, she said, she had spoken with President Clinton yesterday morning, wishing him well before he left for a summit meeting with Middle East leaders.</p>
        <p>But no, she said, she did not offer him any particular advice. Instead, she asked the congregations she visited yesterday to pray for him.</p>
        <p>''It is a time of peril and danger,'' Mrs. Clinton said to the congregation at the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem, where she was joined by prominent black leaders, including Representative Charles B. Rangel and the state comptroller, H. Carl McCall.</p>
        <p>In her church visits, Mrs. Clinton has offered a relatively consistent message. Despite the economic growth in recent years, too many people do not have health insurance, too many schools are overcrowded or poorly equipped and too many of the elderly and their families cannot afford medication or specialized care, Mrs. Clinton repeatedly says.</p>
        <p>By using techniques common to ministers -- carefully modifying her cadence, raising and lowering her voice, repeating certain refrains that seem almost designed to evoke cries of ''amen'' from the congregations -- she generally succeeds in working  the crowds into a fervor.</p>
        <p>''No matter what, keep going,'' Mrs. Clinton said yesterday, recalling the advice she said the freed slave Harriet Tubman offered as she helped other slaves escape to the North. ''If you hear gunshots, keep going. If you hear footsteps and shouts behind you, keep going. If you hear the barking of the dogs that are trying to hunt you down, keep going.''</p>
        <p>Her 13 minutes of remarks at Goodwill Baptist Church in the Bronx elicited applause 17 times. At Abyssinian, applause came 15 times, along with two standing ovations. And at Emmanuel Baptist Church in the Bronx, the congregation sang a hymn with the words ''Victory is mine, victory is mine. Yes, I told Lazio, get thee behind,'' substituting Mr. Lazio's name where the traditional lyric calls for a reference to Satan. Mrs. Clinton, at least for this song, did not appear to sing along.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio encountered his own share of enthusiastic crowds at stops his campaign bus made in Buffalo, Geneva, Auburn, Skaneateles and Tully yesterday, a journey in which he was joined by his wife, Patricia, and their two daughters.</p>
        <p>At the ''Lasagna with Lazio'' dinner in Geneva, held by the Sons of Italy Post 2397, Mr. Lazio spoke of his grandmother, an immigrant from Italy, and the values she instilled in the family. Then he turned to his campaign.</p>
        <p>''Nobody from Washington, D.C., or Little Rock or Hollywood is going to tell us New Yorkers who's going to represent us in the United States Senate,'' he said, echoing the theme of two new television advertisements his campaign is running, emphasizing Mrs. Clinton's newcomer status.</p>
        <p>In an interview yesterday morning on Fox News, Mr. Lazio asserted that during his upstate campaign stops ''75 percent of the people were Democrats,'' a claim that Mrs. Clinton's aides challenged, noting that a large portion of upstate residents are Republicans.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio visited the Ukrainian National Club in Auburn and a bowling alley in Skaneateles, and spent about two hours in the parking lot of Ralph Wilson Stadium greeting people on their way to the Buffalo Bills game.</p>
        <p>The reaction to Mr. Lazio was characterized as much by apparent disdain for Mrs. Clinton as by genuine support for Mr. Lazio.</p>
        <p>''You've got to stop her,'' several Bills fans yelled to Mr. Lazio. He responded generally by smiling and asking for the support of voters.</p>
        <p>In a question-and-answer session with reporters, Mr. Lazio defended the tone of his campaign literature, which describes Mrs. Clinton as ''extreme'' and ''radical.''</p>
        <p>''I stand by that language,'' Mr. Lazio said. ''Anytime somebody puts forth proposals that would spend $2.5 trillion over 10 years,'' a figure that a spokeswoman for Mrs. Clinton's campaign called inaccurate, ''that's not exactly a fiscal conservative.''</p>
