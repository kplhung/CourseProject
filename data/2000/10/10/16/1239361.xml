        <p>Gov. George W. Bush has written that ''by far the most profound'' decision he or any governor can make is whether to proceed with an execution.</p>
        <p>''I get the facts, weigh them thoughtfully and carefully, and decide,'' Mr. Bush wrote in his autobiography. What he did not say is that he normally does this in 15 minutes.</p>
        <p>A review of Mr. Bush's daily schedules, correspondence and other documents, obtained after requests made under public-information laws in Texas, underscores that he has devoted himself remarkably little to policy details -- including whether to go ahead with executions -- and instead spent most of his time wooing legislators, the public and the news media.</p>
        <p>Yet this may have made him more effective as governor, not less. Even many Democrats in Texas praise Mr. Bush, saying he has appointed unusually well-qualified people, avoided disabling scandals or controversies and succeeded in getting a popular agenda passed into law.</p>
        <p>It is impossible to know clearly what a Bush presidency would be like from his years as governor, in part because Mr. Bush has held office for just five years and has never been tested by a recession or other crisis. But his experience here in Austin can help form some tentative ideas about how he might operate as president.</p>
        <p>The 900-page stack of Mr. Bush's schedules and correspondence obtained from the governor's office portrays a governor who works short hours and spends little time studying specific issues or working on executive matters. The schedules show that Mr. Bush typically had his first office meeting about 9 a.m., took two hours of ''private time'' at lunch for a run, and then wrapped up his last meeting by about 5 p.m.</p>
        <p>A large portion of the officially scheduled meetings were ''photo opportunities,'' interviews with reporters, or meetings with school groups or other ceremonial occasions. Relatively little of the day was devoted to hard-core examination of the issues.</p>
        <p>Aides acknowledge Mr. Bush's impatience with long meetings and briefing papers. But they praise this as a Reagan-style assertion of a chief executive's responsibility to dictate broad principles and then delegate minor matters.</p>
        <p>The detachment from policy details may arise in part because Texas law gives a governor very limited powers -- he cannot commute a death sentence, for example, but only delay its implementation for 30 days. And it may partly arise because Mr. Bush shows great trust in those to whom he delegates authority, such as the people he appoints to the board of pardons and paroles. He almost always follows the board's recommendations.</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman for Mr. Bush, Linda Edwards, said he might spend more than 15 minutes reviewing a death penalty case -- the meeting might go longer than scheduled, or he might make a follow-up call later -- and that the time schedule reflected Mr. Bush's confidence in his legal advisers. Ms. Edwards said the advisers might have spent hours reviewing a death penalty case before discussing it with the governor.</p>
        <p>The schedules examined were for 1997, because that was a year in which the Texas Legislature met (there is no legislative session in even years) and thus gave Mr. Bush the chance to be more involved in policy, and he had not yet begun traveling widely in pursuit of the presidency. These days, Mr. Bush is rarely in the governor's office.</p>
        <p>The schedules do not, of course, tell the full story. Long chunks of time were left blank, and just because nothing was scheduled does not mean that Mr. Bush was playing solitaire on his computer (although he sometimes did). Aides say that during periods when his schedule was blank, Mr. Bush made phone calls, read and answered correspondence, talked to staff members, met visitors and dropped in on legislators.</p>
        <p>These visits with legislators -- which Mr. Bush made much more frequently than past governors had -- have generated enormous good will for him and helped increase his effectiveness in getting legislation passed.</p>
        <p>An Unusual Partnership</p>
        <p>It was a quiet morning in October 1994, three weeks before Election Day, as a car pulled up at 3001 Gilbert Street in a residential area of Austin. The unlikeliest of visitors got out, stepped quickly up the walk and rang the bell of the ranch-style home.</p>
        <p>It was George W. Bush, then the Republican candidate for governor, and he was making a secret visit to a legendary Democratic kingmaker, Bob Bullock. They had never met, and even their aides did not know of that first meeting.</p>
        <p>It would have been natural for them to sit down together after the election, but it was extraordinary for Mr. Bush to reach out in this way in the middle of a campaign that many thought he would lose. Yet Mr. Bullock, a craggy, explosive man, a Rodin statue come to life, invited Mr. Bush into the kitchen and sat down at the table.</p>
        <p>Jan Bullock, Mr. Bullock's widow (he died last year), recalled that Mr. Bush first walked to the counter and, without invitation, poured himself a mug of coffee. Then he sat down at the small table and made a plea for a truce instead of a political war.</p>
        <p>''He just explained that if he was elected he had no intention of playing the political game,'' she recalled. ''He said, 'I'm here to tell you that I want to work with you.' ''</p>
        <p>''Of course, my husband was wary and skeptical, but he liked him,'' Mrs. Bullock said, adding that the two men talked for three or four hours about their ideas for state government.</p>
        <p>That meeting, recounted by Mr. Bush's aides as well as by Mrs. Bullock, helped lay the groundwork for one of Mr. Bush's proudest achievements as governor -- the spirit of bipartisan cooperation that hugely multiplied his effectiveness. Many politicians and consultants say that so far, at least, Mr. Bush has not left any fundamentally new imprint or legacy in Texas, but that he did succeed in uniting Republicans and Democrats behind an agenda that took Texas several steps toward bolstering schools and creating a more pro-business environment.</p>
        <p>One of Mr. Bush's campaign themes has been his boast, which many Texas Democrats say is justified, that as governor he worked particularly closely with Democrats. Thus a central question about Mr. Bush is simply how transferable his style would be to Washington.</p>
        <p>Many here in Austin say the bipartisanship was possible largely because of a special circumstance: Democrats in Texas are like Republicans anywhere else. Democrats from rural Texas, in particular, tend to be fiscally conservative, supportive of the death penalty, very tough on crime and suspicious of environmental regulation.</p>
        <p>As a result, the two parties were divided by rivalry and distrust in Texas, but not by their positions on the issues, as is true in most of the nation. Mrs. Bullock, for example, says there were no ideological differences between her husband and Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>''Texas politics has been based more on friendship than party lines,'' she mused as she sat in her living room here. ''Texas must be extremely unique in that respect.''</p>
        <p>Yet while there are doubts about whether Mr. Bush could achieve a similarly harmonious relationship in Washington, this bipartisanship remains a real and unexpected achievement in Texas. No one would have anticipated his partnership with Mr. Bullock, and the two men's cooperation became a reason Mr. Bush could get things done and a source of his tremendous popularity.</p>
        <p>His critics accuse him of being a terrible governor on the issues -- keeping poor children off the health insurance rolls, backing polluters as they destroy the air and water, doing little to improve the quasi-third world conditions in the communities known as ''colonias'' close to the Mexican border. But few critics try to argue that Mr. Bush has been ineffective or unpopular.</p>
        <p>''On his own terms, taking his goals to measure him against, he's been a successful governor,'' said Bruce Buchanan, a political scientist and presidential scholar at the University of Texas at Austin.</p>
        <p>Professor Buchanan said Mr. Bush would be remembered as an incrementalist who had achieved modest progress on his own limited agenda -- more progress than his Democratic predecessor, Ann Richards -- but that he would leave a much smaller imprint on Texas than such predecessors as John B. Connally, who helped build the state's university system, or Mark White, who worked with Ross Perot to begin an overhaul of the state's education system.</p>
        <p>Holding His Temper</p>
        <p>Back when Mr. Bush began his campaign for governor, just about everybody thought he was crazy. Ms. Richards was a national figure and media star with high popularity ratings. Even Mr. Bush's own mother, Barbara, urged him not to run against her.</p>
        <p>Yet Mr. Bush was determined, and he ran a shrewd race while keeping his hot temper in check. Ms. Richards tried to aggravate Mr. Bush into self-destruction by needling him and belittling him as a dull-witted daddy's boy who had never accomplished anything on his own.</p>
        <p>If Mr. Bush had detonated in front of a television camera, such an explosion would have been particularly costly because it might have been seen as confirmation of what many Texans suspected: that he was running against Ms. Richards partly for personal reasons, to seek revenge. Ms. Richards had made a famous speech to the Democratic National Convention in 1988, ridiculing Mr. Bush's father as ''born with a silver foot in his mouth.''</p>
        <p>Yet Mr. Bush, whose temperament in the past had resembled a string of firecrackers popping, simply grinned amicably when Ms. Richards goaded him over the course of the campaign as a ''shrub'' and a ''jerk.''</p>
        <p>His cousin Elsie Walker said she watched Mr. Bush and Ms. Richards debate on television, periodically cowering behind a bathroom door as she waited for Mr. Bush to blow up. But he had matured, and he came across as the cooler candidate.</p>
        <p>''As I watched, she was needling him and he wasn't needling back,'' Ms. Walker recalled. ''So I sent a telegram to Barbara, something like 'What's he on, animal tranquilizers?' And then I realized he'd really developed a lot of discipline.''</p>
        <p>One of Mr. Bush's insights was that while Texans liked Ms. Richards, they did not much agree with her and regarded her as too liberal. And so he ran an exceptionally focused, tight campaign that hammered home his themes day after day: better schools, a tougher juvenile justice system, tighter restrictions on welfare and new limits on tort lawsuits.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's greatest asset in life, with the possible exception of his name and connections, has been a winning personality, and he used it to great effect in the campaign. On the opening day of dove season, Sept. 1, Mr. Bush went out -- with 30-odd reporters in tow -- to shoot a dove. A bird flew up, he blasted away with his shotgun, he held up the bird proudly for the news photographers. Then the reporters pointed out that he had shot not a dove, but a protected songbird known as the killdeer.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush promptly confessed, paid a $130 fine and began a news conference that afternoon by saying: ''Thank goodness it wasn't deer season. I might have shot a cow.''</p>
        <p>The humor and discipline of the campaign worked: Mr. Bush defeated Ms. Richards with a healthy 54 percent of the vote.</p>
        <p>A Lesson From Billy Graham</p>
        <p>During the campaign, Mr. Bush had told a reporter of his belief that the path to heaven comes from acceptance of Jesus as one's personal savior. Mr. Bush later recalled: ''It was, of course, picked up and politicized -- you know, 'Bush to Jews: Go to Hell.' It was very ugly. It hurt my feelings.''</p>
        <p>So one of the first things he did after becoming governor, he recalled, was to meet a group of Jewish leaders in Houston and give a speech that he remembers this way: ''I know, really, why you all are here. You're here to know whether this governor condemns you to hell. I can tell.''</p>
        <p>''It hurt me,'' Mr. Bush recalled saying. ''It hurt to think that you think I've condemned you to hell, because I would never do that. That's not my role in life.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush later explained that the Rev. Billy Graham had helped him reach this position. As he recalled in a 1998 interview, the issue arose when he was visiting his parents in the White House and the discussion turned to religion: he argued that only Christians had a place in heaven, while his mother disagreed.</p>
        <p>''I said, 'Mom, look, all I can tell you is what the New Testament says,' '' Mr. Bush recounted. ''And she said, 'Well, surely God will accept others.' And I said, 'Mom, here's what the New Testament says.' And she said, 'O.K.,' and she picks up the phone and calls Billy Graham. She says to the White House operator, 'Get me Billy Graham.'</p>
        <p>''I said, 'Mother, what are you doing?' '' Mr. Bush said. ''Seriously. And about two minutes later, the phone rings, and it's Billy Graham, and Mother and I are on the phone with Billy. And Mother explains the circumstances, and Billy says: 'From a personal perspective, I agree with what George is saying; the New Testament has been my guide. But I want to caution you both. Don't play God. Who are you two to be God?' ''</p>
        <p>The issue reflects Mr. Bush's penchant for holding to views whose implications some might find offensive, while doing all he can to avoid giving any offense. The logical conclusion of Mr. Bush's theology may be that non-Christians cannot enter heaven, but he consciously steps aside before reaching that conclusion and insists that it is not his role to be gatekeeper.</p>
        <p>A similar pattern arises on gay issues. While campaigning in 1994, Mr. Bush opposed an effort to repeal an anti-sodomy law making homosexual acts a crime in Texas. The effort to repeal the bill failed very narrowly, and it remains on the books, apparently with Mr. Bush's support.</p>
        <p>The sodomy law is rarely enforced. But in 1998 police officers entered a home in Houston after getting a report of an armed intruder, and arrested a gay couple they said were having sex. The couple appealed, and in June an appeals court agreed that the law violated the Texas Equal Rights Amendment. The state has appealed.</p>
        <p>Yet Mr. Bush has avoided trumpeting his views about homosexuality.</p>
        <p>Glen Maxey, a gay Democrat in the Texas House of Representatives, recalled an occasion when Governor Bush was visiting the House floor to support a bill that would have banned adoption by gay couples. ''We had a short talk on the House floor,'' Mr. Maxey said. ''He said, 'Glen, I value you as a friend, and what I say about gay people doesn't apply to you personally.' And I said: 'Governor, when you say you're against gay adoption, you're talking about me. And I take that very personally.' ''</p>
        <p>''George Bush was totally comfortable with me,'' Mr. Maxey added. ''But it's all those other gay people out there. I think that mentality runs through him, whether it's race or sexual orientation. Up front, he's a great guy. But when you move to policy things, it's a great danger.''</p>
        <p>Friendly Headlocks</p>
        <p>Elliott Naishtat, a Democratic member of the state House of Representatives, was walking down the steps of the Texas Capitol one day. Suddenly, a man seized him from behind and put him in a headlock.</p>
        <p>Mr. Naishtat looked through the tangle of arms and identified the mugger.</p>
        <p>''It's Bush, and he's very friendly,'' recalled Mr. Naishtat, a liberal who is the chairman of the House committee that was then considering welfare legislation. Some Capitol police officers were nearby, and Mr. Naishtat jokingly called out to them for help, but they did not interfere. So the governor walked Mr. Naishtat down the steps, keeping him bent over and in the headlock.</p>
        <p>''And he said, 'Elliott, I hear we're hung up on welfare,' '' Mr. Naishtat recalled. '' 'You know how important this is, I hope we can work it out.' ''</p>
        <p>This aggressive bonhomie is very much Mr. Bush's style, and it has been very effective in Texas. Mr. Naishtat, for example, admits that it was ''seductive'' to be mugged by the governor, although he quickly adds that this aggressive approach did not work: he did not allow the welfare bills out of committee.</p>
        <p>Still, what is striking in talking to Texas politicians, even Democrats, is how much they like Mr. Bush. He invites them to the governor's mansion, he drops by their offices, he praises them in the press, he puts them in friendly headlocks.</p>
        <p>''His strength is not policy, not details,'' said Paul Sadler, a Democrat who is chairman of the House education committee. ''His strength is that you like him and you want him to succeed.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sadler worked very closely with Mr. Bush on changes in the education system, and when the new school law was signed in June 1995, Mr. Bush scheduled the ceremony in Mr. Sadler's hometown, Henderson, and then praised him for his work. It would be difficult to imagine such an event at the federal level, with a president traveling to the hometown of the other party's congressman to thank him for his work on a bill.</p>
        <p>One result of this gesture is that Mr. Sadler describes himself as a friend of Mr. Bush and is not taking sides in the presidential race. That is remarkably common: many Texas Democrats are steering clear of Vice President Al Gore and remaining on the sidelines.</p>
        <p>Yet the Texas Democrats are sometimes also a bit irritated that all the credit for bipartisanship goes to Mr. Bush. They emphasize that Mr. Bush's success was in large part a consequence of his extraordinary partnership with Mr. Bullock, who was the lieutenant governor and arguably held more power under the Texas system than Mr. Bush. The two men developed almost a father-son relationship, with Mr. Bullock doing much of Mr. Bush's heavy legislative lifting. And while it was Mr. Bush who reached out, Mr. Bullock responded with equal enthusiasm.</p>
        <p>Likewise, Democrats say Mr. Bush's agenda was partly drawn from measures that were already bubbling up in the Legislature, which would have been passed even under a different governor.</p>
        <p>''Was he significant?'' Mr. Sadler said, referring to Mr. Bush's role on the education bill. ''Absolutely. But were the ideas his? No, that's not the way it happened. There were a whole bunch of people, Democrats and Republicans alike, working to get it done, and he was a part of that team. He was no more significant than any member of my committee or of the Senate committee.''</p>
        <p>'He's Looking for Perfection'</p>
        <p>A Texas governor's main powers lie in making appointments and using the bully pulpit. On both counts, Mr. Bush gets high marks from many Democrats as well as Republicans.</p>
        <p>State records show that Mr. Bush has appointed many fewer members of minority groups than Ms. Richards -- 80 percent of his appointees have been white, compared with 66 percent of Ms. Richards's and 55 percent of the Texas population as a whole. In addition, 63 percent of Mr. Bush's appointees have been men.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Bush's appointments have been less diverse over all, his choices have mostly been well-respected moderates rather than hard-line ideologues (although a couple of appointees have aroused criticism because of their remarks about blacks and Hispanics). And Mr. Bush's judicial appointees say they were never asked about their positions on issues like abortion.</p>
        <p>''It's the toughest appointment process I've ever seen,'' said George Christian, a former aide to President Lyndon B. Johnson and now a Texas political consultant. ''He's looking for perfection. I handled appointments for two governors, and the way we did it was we checked with local campaign people and state Democratic Party folks. It was a much more political process.''</p>
        <p>In contrast to this traditionally political approach, Mr. Bush appointed an old friend from the business world, Clay Johnson, to head the appointment process. Many of his appointees are financial contributors or cronies, but many others are simply experts in their field who are not politically active, or even Democrats.</p>
        <p>''I have clients who want appointments,'' said Bill Miller, a prominent lobbyist in Austin who works with Democrats and Republicans. ''And one of the gripes I hear from them is 'What the hell, these guys are trying to get somebody right for the job.' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's one effort to leave a major legacy in Texas showed just the kind of vision that critics often said his father lacked in the White House. It was a far-reaching tax proposal that would have addressed weaknesses in public finance in Texas by reducing property taxes, raising the sales tax and levying a new tax on partnerships of professionals like doctors, lawyers and accountants.</p>
        <p>It was a bold move that reflected a measure of political courage: Mr. Bush, not surprisingly, was promptly denounced for trying to raise new taxes. The proposal failed ignominiously, for while there was widespread agreement that Texas' emphasis on property taxes was outdated, reflecting an era when most wealth came from the land, Mr. Bush could not build a consensus on how to replace the lost revenue.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush never mentions the proposal these days, perhaps because it failed, or perhaps because it could remind voters that he had once favored raising the sales tax. He said afterward that the failure demonstrated how hard it was to achieve dramatic change without a crisis to force it.</p>
        <p>Since then, he has concentrated on less sweeping proposals but has not seemed chastened by the failure. On the contrary, he comes across as exuberant simply at waking up each morning as governor, and at times he seems surprised that his wandering course through life has led him to the governor's mansion and, perhaps, on a path to the White House.</p>
        <p>An old friend and high school roommate, John Kidde, recalled visiting Mr. Bush for a 50th-birthday celebration in July 1996.</p>
        <p>''All of a sudden he comes over, and he's dripping wet,'' Mr. Kidde recalled. ''I thought he'd been dunked in a pool, but it turned out that he'd just come back from jogging. So he comes over and gives us hugs.</p>
        <p>''And then he stands up and throws up his hands at the governor's mansion behind him, as if to say: 'What's this? How could this have happened to us?' ''</p>
