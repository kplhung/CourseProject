        <p>Eric Davis barely raised his voice. He stood in the rear of the St. Louis Cardinals' clubhouse at Shea Stadium last night surrounded by television cameras and everyone could hear him. Outside of Davis, the room was dead quiet. The few players at the food table had finished picking through their chicken, showered, dressed and left.</p>
        <p>''What do you want us, to start crying? It's not going to happen,'' Davis said after the Cardinals' 10-6 loss to the Mets left them trailing the National League Championship Series, three games to one.</p>
        <p>''It's time for us to make history. It's never been done before. Someone's got to do it. Why not us?''</p>
        <p>Actually, there is one exception. The 1996 Cardinals squandered a 3-1 advantage over the Atlanta Braves to become the only team with that lead that failed to make the World Series.</p>
        <p>St. Louis finds itself in the opposite position after its starting pitcher, Darryl Kile, allowed a League Championship Series-record five doubles to the Mets in the first inning last night. That negated the Cardinals' two runs in the top of the inning and left them trailing, 4-2.</p>
        <p>The Mets added three runs off an ineffective Kile in the second inning to take a 7-2 lead and led by 8-6 in the sixth inning, when things fell further apart.</p>
        <p>The Cardinals' Ray Lankford led off with a single, but Fernando Tatis, J. D. Drew and Carlos Hernandez made outs, leaving Mark McGwire waiting on deck to bat for the pitcher. McGwire never got closer to the plate.</p>
        <p>In the bottom of the inning, Mike Timlin walked the Mets' Mike Bordick to lead off before Glendon Rusch bunted back to the mound. Timlin intended to throw to second base to get at least the lead runner, if not a double play, but said he slipped on the slick grass. He got only Rusch at first base.</p>
        <p>Tatis made two errors at third base in the inning, throwing wide of first base on one play and then bobbling a ball. The second error scored one run and Robin Ventura's sacrifice fly scored another as the Mets regained a four-run lead, essentially ending the Cardinals' hope and minimizing McGwire's chances to bat.</p>
        <p>Tatis declined to speak after the game. So did McGwire. Manager Tony La Russa said he wanted to save McGwire to bat when the tying run was at the plate and did not want to use him in the sixth inning.</p>
        <p>McGwire, who has been reduced to being a pinch-hitter because of knee tendinitis, waited in the corner of the dugout with his helmet on and clutching a bat as St. Louis rallied against Armando Benitez in the ninth. The Cardinals got two runners on and Benitez went to a full count on Jim Edmonds before Edmonds flied out to right field to end the game.</p>
        <p>''It's not like we just got walked over,'' Davis said. ''We have a lot of things to be upbeat about. We scored on their bullpen. We have a lot, except the outcome isn't what we wanted to be, so we have to be upbeat. If we were just getting assaulted at the game of baseball, then we'd have reason not to be optimistic. The first four games, we could easily be up, 3-1.''</p>
        <p>So the Cardinals leave their fate with the starting pitcher Pat Hentgen, who has yet to pitch this postseason. (His last playoff appearance came in the 1993 World Series with the Blue Jays.) La Russa raved about his ability to pitch in tough environments, something Hentgen hopes he can count on tonight.</p>
        <p>''I've pitched in World Series games before,'' he said. ''I think that's to my advantage.''</p>
        <p>St. Louis did have a rejuvenated Edmonds, who has been slowed by a sprained back. Edmonds went 2 for 5 with a home run and three R.B.I. He hit a two-run homer in the first inning and added a run-scoring single in the fifth that drew the Cardinals within two runs. Edmonds also threw out Todd Zeile trying to score from second to end the second inning.</p>
        <p>In the first three games of the series, Edmonds had only 3 hits in 14 at-bats after hitting .571 with 2 homers and 7 R.B.I. in the Cardinals' three-game sweep of Atlanta in the division series. But Edmonds tripped and fell on his tailbone while catching a fly ball in the first game of that series.</p>
        <p>''I don't know how to put a percentage on it, but he's not the same,'' La Russa said before last night's game. ''You can see he's not playing his normal game, but at this time of the year you have to deal with it.''</p>
        <p>Edmonds said the discomfort was not constant, but ''when it flares up it's everything.''</p>
