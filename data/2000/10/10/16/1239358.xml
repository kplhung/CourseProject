        <p>Over the summer, some 500 homeless families found themselves sleeping on the floors of New York City's emergency assistance office for lack of room in the homeless shelters. This desperate situation made it impossible to maintain any normal routine, such as getting children to school or holding down a job. It also violated a court order that requires compliance with a city ordinance banning the practice of having the homeless sleep on office floors.</p>
        <p>Last month, the Legal Aid Society went to court to force the city to address this problem. The Giuliani administration is now proposing to start a pilot program giving rent subsidies to homeless families that participate in city work programs. The new program is expected to offer some 550 homeless families rent subsidies of between $300 and $400 a month, for up to two years.</p>

        <p>Last month, the Legal Aid Society went to court to force the city to address this problem. The Giuliani administration is now proposing to start a pilot program giving rent subsidies to homeless families that participate in city work programs. The new program is expected to offer some 550 homeless families rent subsidies of between $300 and $400 a month, for up to two years.</p>
        <p>Even this emergency program cannot solve the growing problem of family homelessness. An increasing number of families that end up in the shelter system are working but cannot afford soaring market rents. Yet public investments in subsidized housing have declined steadily in recent years. Fewer homeless families are being moved into permanent housing and the average length of stay in homeless shelters has gone up.</p>
        <p>The administration's proposal for rent subsidies is a step forward. But ultimately, the city needs to have a broader housing policy that creates more subsidized housing for low-income families teetering on the edge of homelessness.</p>
