        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Linda Waite (''Staying Married and Paying a Price,'' Op-Ed, Oct. 12) captured perfectly the unkindness and hypocrisy of those who challenge Hillary Rodham Clinton's decision to stay with her husband -- a very personal decision that must have been profoundly difficult to make. No one has any business asking Mrs. Clinton, especially in a public forum, why she chose to stay in the marriage. A great many marriages survive anguishing conflicts and crises and are often the stronger for it.</p>

        <p>Putting Mrs. Clinton in the position of having to explain and defend her private choice is a cheap tactic to embarrass and humiliate her  during the campaign. Fortunately, she is brave enough and strong enough to withstand such assaults with dignity and honesty.</p>
