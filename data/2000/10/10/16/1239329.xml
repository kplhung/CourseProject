        <p>What would be the plot line if television tried to capture the rocky relationship between William E. Kennard, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, and the nation's largest broadcasting companies?</p>
        <p>If it were produced by Mr. Kennard, the series might be called ''Lost in Place.'' It would be the saga of a crass industry that, swimming in a sea of profit and consolidation, has forsaken its obligations as trustees of the airwaves, corrupted children through sexually explicit and violent programming, ignored the political weal by refusing to provide adequate air time for candidates, and pretty much forgotten about opening its ranks to minorities.</p>
        <p>If the script were written by the broadcasters, about Mr. Kennard, they might call it ''As the Regulator Burns.'' It would be the biography of a frustrated and antagonistic Washington bureaucrat hell-bent on imposing his skewed public-interest vision of what's best for the marketplace by unfurling rolls of red tape, impeding the technological advancement of digital television and chilling free speech.</p>
        <p>In recent weeks, the clashing story lines have been playing out in public, as the acrimonious relationship between Mr. Kennard and the broadcasters has bubbled over into the courts and Congress.</p>
        <p>Consider these:</p>
        <p>*On Monday, the F.C.C. will conduct a day-long hearing that examines the public-interest obligations of broadcasters, but both sides have already staked out irreconcilable claims. Mr. Kennard maintains that the industry has neglected its responsibilities to protect children and provide more airtime to candidates. The broadcasters have responded that the current rules are too onerous, and in any event, should not be applied to digital television.</p>
        <p>*Last Wednesday, the broadcasters won a decades-long legal battle when a Federal appeals court repealed two rules that were the last major vestiges of the fairness doctrine. The rules had required television and radio stations to provide free reply time to candidates and others attacked on the airwaves. Mr. Kennard had hoped to avert the repeal when he moved a week earlier to temporarily suspend the rules to demonstrate why they were necessary.</p>
        <p>*A day earlier, Mr. Kennard delivered a broadside against broadcasters reminiscent of the excoriation of television as a ''vast wasteland,'' in 1961 by another F.C.C. chairman, Newton N. Minow. Speaking at the Museum of Television and Radio in New York, Mr. Kennard derided the ''disarray and disinterest of our mass media towards fulfilling its crucial democratic commitments'' and criticized the broadcasters for ''increasingly elevating financial interests above the public interest.'' He proposed that they rapidly accelerate their conversion to digital television or face a special tax.</p>
        <p>Edward O. Fritts, the president of the National Association of Broadcasters, replied: ''Chairman Kennard has failed the test of leadership. Sadly, he is trying to shift the blame for a faltering DTV transition.''</p>
        <p>*Earlier this month, the broadcasters were once again in court, challenging the heavily watered down F.C.C. guidelines for eliminating discrimination by broadcasters. Those guidelines had came after earlier court setbacks for Mr. Kennard, a Clinton appointee who, as the agency's first African American leader, has strived to open the industry to those who have historically been shut out.</p>
        <p>*A centerpiece of Mr. Kennard's agenda, a plan to issue licenses to hundreds of low-power FM radio stations run by schools, churches, civic groups and others, has also come under heavy assault by the broadcasters' association and may be killed by Congress in the next few days.</p>
        <p>What makes the wide gulf between Mr. Kennard and the industry so surprising is that, for more than a decade before he entered government, Mr. Kennard was a lawyer who worked for the National Association of Broadcasters. Mr. Kennard said in a recent interview that, as chairman, he had reached out to work with the industry, but he more recently found their complaints about the agency to lack consistency.</p>
        <p>''The broadcasters play a blame game,'' he said. ''They argue against government intervention in their industry. But then they demand that we become as intrusive as possible in other industries.'' He cited the must-carry rules that require cable companies to carry the signals of local television stations and the technical standards for manufacturers of TV sets.</p>
        <p>''There's a fundamental disagreement on the terms of engagement,'' he added. ''I feel that I have a responsibility to ensure that broadcasters fulfill their public trustee obligations. But when I want to engage on what those obligations are, all I get is a brick wall. They insist that the public-interest obligations are what they decide they are.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fritts, the association president, said that while there were many legitimate policy disputes and that the broadcasters had been singled out, the industry was hardly alone in its regulatory battles with the F.C.C.</p>
        <p>''Maybe it's just our turn in the barrel,'' he said. ''There is a fundamental premise that if you lack competition, you need regulation and if you have competition, you need less regulation. We have an F.C.C. that is attempting to layer more regulation. If you look at cable, satellite, telephone services, broadcasting is the only one that is offered for free, and the only one that offers the most localism, local news, local entertainment, local programming.''</p>
        <p>Washington politics are also a factor, Mr. Fitts said. ''It is the end of an administration,'' he said. ''Some people are putting their stake in the ground for the future, for their legacy.''</p>
        <p>Still, there is more to the disputes between Mr. Kennard and the broadcasters than either legacies or philosophical differences.</p>
        <p>To Mr. Kennard and his supporters, the bitter disagreements are a byproduct of fundamental power shifts in Washington, of a Republican Congress generally supportive of broadcasters who have come to play such a life-and-death role in elections. The lawmakers, in turn, are an easy avenue to apply pressure on the agency, and that has only soured already bitter relations. The Republican Congress has been unsympathetic to Mr. Kennard's agenda of civil rights and more open access on the airwaves for diverse voices and political debate.</p>
        <p>''While the N.A.B. has done reasonably well at the F.C.C. over the last few years on a whole bunch of issues, it has been in most cases not by convincing Kennard, but by politically beating on him, by using their muscle,'' said Andrew Jay Schwartzman, president of the Media Access Project, a nonpartisan organization devoted to promoting diversity on the airwaves that also has often found itself at odds with the broadcasters.</p>
        <p>''The nature of Washington and the nature of the independent agencies has changed because of money and politics,'' Mr. Schwartzman said. ''The Congressional oversight role has changed from an occasional review of agencies to a micromanagement of an agency on a day-to-day basis, fueled by campaign contributions and political influence and that runs to the N.A.B.'s strength.''</p>
        <p>From their perspective, the broadcasters see an agency that has been paralyzed by indecision, delaying final rule making on crucial issues for years, and then blaming the industry for problems.</p>
        <p>''There is blame on both sides on some of these issues,'' said Richard E. Wiley, who was chairman of the F.C.C. in the 1970's. ''The commission needs to get its act together. The industry needs to get its act together. It's too bad, because they are talking past each other.''</p>
        <p>It was Mr. Wiley's law firm, Wiley, Rein &amp; Fielding, which now represents a number of major broadcasters, that won the fairness doctrine case last week. He said that one of the biggest failures of the F.C.C. was that, rather than confronting issues, it sometimes tried to side-step them, which ultimately offends both Congress and the courts.</p>
        <p>''Decisions put off are always going to come back to haunt you,'' Mr. Wiley said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kennard's supporters said the agency had not intentionally delayed its rule making, but had moved cautiously as a matter of internal politics. With the two Republican commissioners often voting together, Mr. Kennard has had to make fundamental compromises to keep the two other Democrats in line.</p>
        <p>For his part, Mr. Fritts is looking forward to the election, which, regardless of which party prevails, will inevitably lead to a turnover in regulators by the middle of next year.</p>
        <p>''We are proud of what we've accomplished and would like to continue to do it unencumbered by red tape,'' he said, noting that he is fond of observing in speeches how, ''they cut the red tape lengthwise here in Washington.''</p>
