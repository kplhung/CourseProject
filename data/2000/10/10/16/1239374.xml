        <p>The Chevron Corporation agreed yesterday to acquire Texaco Inc. for about $36 billion in stock, creating the world's fourth-largest oil concern.</p>
        <p>The companies' boards approved the deal, which is expected to be announced today, senior executives involved in the talks said. The acquisition comes during a period of high oil and gas prices and much political jostling, both in the United States and abroad, to keep those prices in check. The acquisition will probably receive intense scrutiny from regulators, who could force the combined company to divest itself of some assets, especially in states like California, where the company would dominate the retail gas station business.</p>
        <p>At the same time, oil companies like Chevron, the nation's third-largest, and Texaco face enormous pressure to merge to remain competitive with the new breed of oil giants like Exxon Mobil, BP Amoco and Royal Dutch/Shell Group, the three largest oil companies in the world. While the combined company would operate nearly 50,000 gas stations worldwide, it would still be less than half the size of Exxon Mobil, based on revenue.</p>
        <p>The proposed giant, to be called Chevron Texaco, would bring together two of the nation's most storied companies in the former Standard Oil Company of California, now known as Chevron, and Texaco, which was founded in 1902 by ''Buckskin Joe'' Cullinan and whose advertising slogan, ''You can trust your car to the man who wears the star,'' became part of the country's consciousness in the 1940's.</p>
        <p>The boards of Chevron, based in San Francisco, and Texaco, based in White Plains, met yesterday afternoon and approved the deal after negotiations that began in the spring, the senior executives said.</p>
        <p>Chevron will swap 0.77 share -- the equivalent of $64.87 based on Friday's closing price -- for every share of Texaco. That represents a premium of about 18 percent over the $55.13 that Texaco's stock closed at on Friday. Chevron will also assume about $7 billion of Texaco's debt.</p>
        <p>The new company will be based in San Francisco, the executives said. It is unclear how deep the job cuts will be at Texaco's headquarters in White Plains, but Chevron Texaco plans to eliminate 4,000 positions across the combined company, mostly from overlapping management and back office operations, the executives said, to save $1.2 billion a year. Before job cuts, the new company would employ about 55,000 people.</p>
        <p>This is not the first time Chevron has tried to buy Texaco. In June 1999, Texaco's board rejected a $37.5 billion offer from Chevron after the two companies clashed over the price and management structure of the proposed deal. Kenneth T. Derr, then the chairman of Chevron, demanded that he head the new company, leading to friction, executives close to the deal then said. Mr. Derr retired early this year and was succeeded by David J. O'Reilly.</p>
        <p>Under the deal reached yesterday, Mr. O'Reilly, 53, would become chairman and chief executive of the combined company, while Texaco's chief executive, Peter I. Bijur, 58, would become a vice chairman. Chevron's vice chairman, Richard H. Matzke, 63, would also be a vice chairman. Chevron will control 9 of the company's 15 board seats.</p>
        <p>Analysts have long thought that a Chevron-Texaco deal would be a logical move if the companies wanted to compete against the ''supermajors'' -- Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch/Shell and BP Amoco.</p>
        <p>''If you want to be a big player, you have to have big money,'' said Mehdi Varzi, director of research at Dresdner Kleinwort Benson. ''The main thing that drives all of them is how do you enhance shareholder return and shareholder interest? And these two companies realized they would make more money together than apart.''</p>
        <p>A combined Chevron and Texaco would have $66.5 billion in revenue, based on 1999 figures. The combined company would be able to produce about 2.7 million barrels of oil a day, with combined reserves of 11 billion barrels.</p>
        <p>Analysts said the union would benefit both companies, but it is clear that Texaco, considered a troubled concern for the last few years, would receive the bigger boost.</p>
        <p>Recently, Texaco's production has been falling and the company's performance under Mr. Bijur has not lived up to the expectations of shareholders and analysts.</p>
        <p>The company has been trying to eke out oil from old fields in the United States and abroad, said Bruce Lanni, senior oil analyst for CIBC World Markets. It divested itself of some oil and gas fields to focus on others. But it never replaced those assets, which further cut into production. Finally, some fields it had banked on ended up being dry holes.</p>
        <p>''Texaco was producing more than they were developing new fields,'' Mr. Varzi of Dresdner Kleinwort Benson said. ''Ultimately, that means you will contract rather than grow.''</p>
        <p>Although it posted mediocre results last year, Chevron's earnings this year rivaled those of Exxon Mobil. But the spate of mergers that created the ''supermajors'' in the oil industry made Chevron a potential takeover target, some analysts said. Moreover, to continue competing in the lucrative but highly risky deepwater offshore projects in West Africa, Brazil and the Caspian Sea, Chevron needed to get bigger.</p>
        <p>''Through this deal, Chevron will get a boost in their long-term growth,'' Mr. Lanni said. ''Texaco has these projects in Africa, Venezuela and the Philippines that will kick up in 2003.''</p>
        <p>The high price of oil has dominated political discussion around the globe in recent months, with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreeing to increase crude oil production by 3 percent, or 800,000 barrels, in September in an effort to decrease prices, which reached more than $37 a barrel earlier this year. President Clinton released 30 million barrels of oil from the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve a week and half later to further dampen the price of oil after Vice President Al Gore injected the issue into the presidential campaign.</p>
        <p>Reacting broadly to news of Chevron's acquisition of Texaco, Mr. Gore's spokesman said: ''Given the fact that oil companies saw their profits rise by more that 300 percent in the past year, it raises the question whether big oil is getting too big.''</p>
        <p>A spokesman for Gov. George W. Bush, whose business career began in the oil fields of West Texas, said,  ''These are legal and technical matters and should be decided by regulators without political interference.''</p>
        <p>While it remains unclear what effect the deal would have on gasoline prices, a senior executive involved in the deal provided a rationale for the acquisition, saying, ''In the long term, the key to low prices is lower costs.''</p>
        <p>The deal is likely to face regulatory hurdles, but analysts suggested that it would probably be approved. Nonetheless, the Federal Trade Commission may force the combined company to divest itself of some assets, including Texaco's stake in Equilon, a joint venture with the Shell Oil Company that refines and markets petroleum products. Executives close to the deal said they had already spoken with Shell about dismantling the joint venture. The F.T.C. was highly critical of BP Amoco's acquisition of ARCO last year, a sentiment that led to the divestiture of ARCO's fields in Alaska. Chevron and Texaco have a joint venture of their own, Caltex, that dates back to the early 1930's. Caltex is expected to be folded into the unified company.</p>
        <p>Senior executives close to the talks hope to close the deal within six months and to begin seeing savings six months after that.</p>
        <p>Chevron was advised by Lehman Brothers, while Texaco was advised by Credit Suisse First Boston and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.</p>
