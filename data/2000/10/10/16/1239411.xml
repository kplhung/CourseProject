      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Roger Clemens knocked the Mariners off their feet in October's tug of war in Game 4 on Saturday, and when Luis Sojo ripped a two-run double early in Game 5 this afternoon, he could feel Seattle tumbling and collapsing once and for all. One big hit; that's all that was needed to finish the job.</p>
        <p>But the finishing blow never came today, and Seattle regained its footing in the American League Championship Series, coming back to beat the Yankees, 6-2, when reliever Jeff Nelson surrendered three consecutive hits in the fifth inning: a two-run single by Alex Rodriguez and back-to-back homers by Edgar Martinez and John Olerud.</p>
        <p>The Yankees are in excellent position to eliminate the Mariners and advance to the World Series. They lead the series, three games to two, and will play host to the remaining games. Orlando Hernandez, undefeated in postseason play, is scheduled to pitch Game 6, against Seattle's John Halama.</p>
        <p>But the Yankees could have closed out the Mariners here. They could have opened the 15 cases of Moet Champagne, poured most of it on one another, sipped a little of it, and enjoyed a cheery flight home before having a week of off-days and workouts before the World Series.</p>
        <p>Now it is more complicated than that; there is work to be done. George Steinbrenner, the team's principal owner, walked out of the clubhouse sternly. ''See you in New York,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''We blew it,'' Sojo said. ''We had the bases loaded, I hit that double, and we didn't score after that. I thought we had it.''</p>
        <p>The Mariners might have thought so, too. They mustered only five runs in the first four games, and Clemens made them look like Little League rejects in his one-hitter in Game 4. It was dreary and damp and cold today, and Seattle Manager Lou Piniella might have sensed the gloom in his team, screaming about an inside pitch to Martinez in the first inning that seemed harmless.</p>
        <p>But the Yankees' starter, Denny Neagle, was tedious in his caution today, pitching as if he did not want to risk any contact by the Mariners; later he said that he felt he had made a lot of good pitches, that he pitched better than the results indicated.</p>
        <p>Neagle reached three-ball counts against 7 of the first 13 batters he faced. He walked Mike Cameron, Rodriguez and Martinez in order in the first inning and got away with allowing just one run in the frame, but Neagle threw 30 pitches. The circumstances seemed to control him, and the count often favored the Seattle hitters.</p>
        <p>The Mariners' Freddy Garcia had a similar outing. He was in trouble early, but the big, fatal hit eluded the Yankees, who had runners on base in each of the first three innings and could not score.</p>
        <p>The Yankees loaded the bases with nobody out in the fourth inning, and Sojo slammed a two-run double to give them a 2-1 lead. They could sense that one big hit was all that was needed.</p>
        <p>But Scott Brosius, who stranded two runners in the second inning, popped up for the first out, Chuck Knoblauch struck out and Derek Jeter grounded out.</p>
        <p>The Yankees had a runner at second and one out in the fifth, and that did not produce any runs. The game was there for the taking and the Yankees passed. ''We had a chance to put them away early in the game,'' Jeter said, ''and we didn't do it.''</p>
        <p>Mark McLemore led off the Seattle fifth with a bunt single on the third-base side. When Neagle fell behind Rickey Henderson, Nelson started throwing in the bullpen.</p>
        <p>Nelson usually pitches in the seventh and eighth innings. But with the Yankees ahead by 2-1, both teams scheduled for a day off on Monday and three consecutive right-handed hitters set to follow Henderson, Yankees Manager Joe Torre was going for the kill. If Neagle could come back to close out the inning, or if Nelson could shut down the Mariners, then the Yankees would be four innings removed from their 37th pennant.</p>
        <p>Neagle walked Henderson, however, giving the Mariners first and second and nobody out. After both runners advanced on Cameron's sacrifice bunt, Torre summoned Nelson, and Neagle's shoulders sagged visibly; the reality is that he has not engendered the full measure of Torre's trust. ''The competitive side of me would love to stay in,'' Neagle said, ''but that's not my call.''</p>
        <p>Torre has relied heavily on Nelson in the postseason in his five years as the team's manager, and with Rodriguez and Martinez coming to bat, Torre was looking for Nelson to contain the damage.</p>
        <p>But Nelson did not feel right; his fastball had been sluggish as he warmed up in the bullpen, and Nelson thought he was pitching with less than his best.</p>
        <p>Rodriguez -- 5 for 12 in previous at-bats against Nelson -- lined a single to left field for two runs, pushing Seattle to a 3-2 lead and revitalizing the Safeco Field fans. ''I know everybody was real pumped when Alex got that hit and we took the lead,'' Olerud said.</p>
        <p>Rodriguez led off first base with one out. He stole a base effortlessly in Game 3 with Nelson on the mound, taking advantage of the right-hander's deliberate windup, and now, in Game 5, Nelson worked hard to try to hold Rodriguez at first. Nelson threw to first five times and shortened his stride to the plate.</p>
        <p>Nelson, however, was creating a problem for himself, falling behind Martinez, two balls and no strikes. Martinez saw all of this and took it in: Nelson was concerned with Rodriguez and might be more apt to throw a fastball to give catcher Jorge Posada a chance to cut down the runner.</p>
        <p>With the situation and the count in his favor, Martinez looked for a fastball, and when Nelson threw a 91-mile-an-hour fastball, Martinez crushed a two-run homer to straightaway center field as the Mariners came alive again, leading by 5-2.</p>
        <p>Nelson looked on impassively as Martinez rounded the bases, but his first fastball to Olerud was only 89 m.p.h., the diminished velocity a sign of discouragement: Olerud, too, slugged a home run to center field.</p>
        <p>Nelson allowed two homers during the regular season and surrendered back-to-back shots in the fifth inning today; two of the four homers he has allowed this year were hit by Martinez. ''I just made some bad pitches and it cost me,'' he said.</p>
        <p>There were a few failed rallies late in the game. Glenallen Hill struck out while pinch-hitting for Paul O'Neill with the bases loaded and two out in the seventh. But the Yankees had botched the game before that when they could not score. The Mariners will go on for at least one more game.</p>
