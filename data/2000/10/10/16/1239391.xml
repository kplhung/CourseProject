        <p>As the sabbath approached last week, Michel Mimouni was busy turning a conference room into a makeshift synagogue, collecting prayer shawls and other items from concerned Jews in nearby neighborhoods.</p>
        <p>The small stucco synagogue where Mr. Mimouni usually prays in Trappes, a blue-collar Paris suburb, had been burned to the ground by arsonists three days before. As the flames lit up the night, a firefighter helped the men from the congregation to get the sacred scrolls out, but nothing else was saved.</p>
        <p>''We are not giving up the fight,'' Mr. Mimouni said, laughing at the size of the city-owned conference room, which is four times that of the synagogue. ''We will be rattling around in here. But we will not be kept from our services.''</p>
        <p>The attack on the Trappes synagogue, which served 30 Jewish families, was one of more than 30 anti-Semitic episodes reported in France in the last two weeks. The violence in the Middle East has taken its toll here too, increasing the tensions between France's small Jewish population and the country's growing number of Muslims.</p>
        <p>This weekend alone, four attacks were reported to the police.</p>
        <p>In Strasbourg, a bakery owned by an Alsatian Jew was set on fire and the words ''Jewish assassins'' were painted in black across the storefront. In the south-central city of Lyon, a stolen car was driven into the wall of a synagogue and set on fire. Nearer to Paris, two other synagogues were attacked by youths, who hurled gasoline bombs through their windows.</p>
        <p>In Trappes, as in some of the other smaller towns, the attacks came as something of a surprise to the Jewish residents. Mr. Mimouni, the president of the local Jewish Association, said there had never even been an incident of vandalism before in the 28 years since the synagogue was built. Like many other Jewish leaders, he believes the arson to be the work of young Arabs, who are often disadvantaged in France.</p>
        <p>''They have no jobs and they are angry and their leaders do not have much control over them,'' Mr. Mimouni said. ''Or at least, so it seems. Everyone must speak out to condemn this sort of thing.''</p>
        <p>On Saturday, Prime Minister Lionel Jospin promised that every effort would be made to end the violence. He advised prosecutors to deal severely with anyone who took part in such attacks and said the police would act aggressively to prevent ''all acts and all attempted acts that are racist in character or anti-Semitic.''</p>
        <p>President Jacques Chirac also condemned the attacks, saying, ''They question in an inadmissible way the values and traditions of the republic.''</p>
        <p>Stepped-up security measures were easily visible around many synagogues in Paris and elsewhere. Nevertheless, attacks were reported throughout the country.</p>
        <p>In Lille, three large stones were heaved through the stained glass over the a synagogue's front door. Near Nanterre, two small towns reported graffiti saying ''Death to Jews,'' ''Long live Palestine'' and Death to Barak.'' In the Paris suburb of St.-Ouen, which has a large immigrant population, a Jewish school  was firebombed, though no one was hurt. In several areas, worshipers leaving sabbath services were met with stone-throwing youths and cries of ''Death to Israel.''</p>
        <p>The police said they had very few reports of violence committed against France's Muslims, though two incendiary devices, one with a Star of David attached, were placed in front of a Muslim butcher's shop in Paris.</p>
        <p>Events in the Middle East have set off violence in France before.</p>
        <p>In the early 1990's, bombings attributed to terrorists, largely in Paris, killed more than half a dozen people and wounded nearly 100.</p>
        <p>Some groups of people who had banded together then met again this week. In Marseille, for instance, Jewish, Muslim and Christian religious leaders who belong to a forum set up in 1991 when the Persian Gulf war caused similar tensions gathered once more to discuss the new attacks.</p>
        <p>''Confrontation here does nothing to help solve the problem of peace over there, '' said Bachir Dahmani, a Muslim imam, after the meeting.</p>
