        <p>FOR the first time in his young life, Alex Rodriguez had trouble sleeping Saturday night. He thought about picking up his cell phone and calling somebody, but there was nobody awake in any time zone familiar to him.</p>
        <p>He said his restlessness had nothing to do with the two pitches Roger Clemens had busted right up under his handsome young chin on Saturday night. Rodriguez does not want baseball stitches across his handsome jawbone, like some old fencing scar of honor that German college students used to value at Heidelberg.</p>
        <p>Even worse than the possibility of being maimed was the reality of having been beaten. Rodriguez and everybody in the global ballpark knew that he and his teammates had been intimidated not only by Clemens's stuff, but also by his overpowering persona.</p>
        <p>The only thing to do was come back and play another day, which in Rodriguez's case could very well have been his last game in Seattle. He is 25 years old, and about to become very, very rich. His contract with the Mariners runs out the day they are eliminated, which could have been yesterday, except that Rodriguez spanked a two-run single to put the Mariners ahead as they beat the Yankees, 6-2, sending this American League Championship Series back to New York.</p>
        <p>Afterward, the Mariners' lineup card, all marked up with substitutions, was in the auxiliary locker next to Rodriguez, the fringe benefit of being the biggest star in the clubhouse.</p>
        <p>''A gift from Coach John McLaren,'' Rodriguez said -- that is to say, a thoughtful memento to a valued player, even if he chooses to take the money and depart.</p>
        <p>Rodriguez was dressed in a blue suit that was so beautiful it must have been very expensive. He was willing to figuratively tear open that garment and show the heart beating underneath.</p>
        <p>''You don't know what will happen,'' Rodriguez said somberly. ''Life is full of different things.''</p>
        <p>He did not want to get into what Clemens had done to him in the first inning Saturday, but that night he did not deny that he was annoyed by Clemens's intimidation:</p>
        <p>''He only misses up and in,'' Rodriguez said.</p>
        <p>This is still a lodge, a fraternity, a union. Rodriguez and Derek Jeter are still pals. And there wasn't much Seattle Manager Lou Piniella could do about Clemens anyway.</p>
        <p>''I'll tell you, in the National League, you can take care of it, certainly a lot different than you do in the American League,'' Piniella said early yesterday. ''A pitcher has got to come up to hit, and instead of having to throw at anybody, you just throw at the pitcher, and that's how you stop it.''</p>
        <p>Piniella declined to buzz the Yankees hitters yesterday because he had a game to win. Rodriguez said his goal was to defer his feelings of sadness and change.</p>
        <p>''You never want to see the other team celebrating in your ballpark,'' he said. ''We won 91 games this year by doing things right. We didn't want it to end this way. I haven't had too many chances with runners on base. People weren't booing me. I was booing myself in the car mirror.''</p>
        <p>Yesterday was -- as somebody once said -- a whole new ballgame.</p>
        <p>''Cy Young could come back from the dead, we're still going to battle,'' Rodriguez had said, not needing to mention that neither Young himself, nor the man who had won five Cy Young awards, would be available yesterday.</p>
        <p>The variety of starting pitchers is yet another cool thing about baseball. In hockey, the same goaltender comes out the next day in a Stanley Cup series. In basketball, the same power forward comes out and lays his body on the opposition, game after game. In the baseball postseason, one day you get big, burly, nasty Roger Clemens, and the next day you get finagling, nibbling, nice-guy Denny Neagle.</p>
        <p>It does not diminish what Rodriguez did yesterday to note that he accomplished this against the relief pitcher, Jeff Nelson, rather than the enforcer, Roger Clemens.</p>
        <p>Rodriguez did not hit 40 home runs in three straight seasons by having a fearful streak. The Braves would turn over their roster like a fall garden to free up some mulch and fertilizer for him. Rodriguez has been asking John Olerud what it's like to play for the Mets and live in New York. (Nice, Olerud said to both.)</p>
        <p>Rodriguez could be another prince of the city, but he is not likely to move to third base or command that kind of loose change with the Yanks. Besides, Rodriguez said Saturday that he would never play on the same team with Clemens. Put that in the category of statements he would retract if the Yankees came after him.</p>
        <p>''There are some classy guys on that team, but we still want to beat their brains in, just like they want to beat in ours,'' Rodriguez said Saturday.</p>
        <p>Rodriguez has also promised he would come back to the Mariners if they won the Series. That promise is still on the record as they fly back to New York.</p>
        <p>''It would have been easy for us to fold and let them go to the World Series,'' Rodriguez said. ''But now we have the opportunity to go into that environment and spoil the party.''</p>
        <p>The Mariners also know that they cannot see Roger Clemens until very, very deep into a desperate seventh game. Alex Rodriguez would settle for that opportunity.</p>
