        <p>After Edward Gorey died in April, Andreas Brown, one of the executors of his estate, visited Gorey's 200-year-old 15-room house in Yarmouth Port, Mass. Mr. Brown began searching through closets, crannies -- in Gorey's words, ''beneath the floor, behind the door'' -- and possibly up the chimney.

        <p>After Edward Gorey died in April, Andreas Brown, one of the executors of his estate, visited Gorey's 200-year-old 15-room house in Yarmouth Port, Mass. Mr. Brown began searching through closets, crannies -- in Gorey's words, ''beneath the floor, behind the door'' -- and possibly up the chimney. Amid the cosmic disarray, he discovered hundreds of stories and sketches, some finished, some unfinished, left behind by this grand master of the macabre.</p>
        <p>This is, Mr. Brown said, a trove of Goreyiana, with ample material for many future books and for plays based on his work.</p>
        <p>On one trip to the Gorey house, he was accompanied by Kevin McDermott, a producer and actor who has been involved in several theatrical anthologies of Gorey's work, including one called ''Amphoragorey,'' a musical presented in 1999 in Provincetown, Mass. Among the items they found were drawings Gorey had started for ''The Admonitory Hippopotamus,'' an unpublished story that was a featured part of the Provincetown show.</p>
        <p>''The face of the hippo was stern,'' Mr. McDermott said. ''It was more admonitory than we imagined.''</p>
        <p>The show, with some revisions and now titled ''The Gorey Details,'' is scheduled to open tonight at the Century Center for the Performing Arts in Manhattan. Presumably the hippo will be more admonitory than it was on Cape Cod.</p>
        <p>''The Admonitory Hippopotamus, or Angelica and Sneezeby'' is a vintage Gorey story. A girl of 5 is playing cards with her brothers in a gazebo when suddenly she sees a spectral hippopotamus ''rising from the ha-ha.'' ''Fly at once!'' commands the hippo. ''All is discovered!''</p>
        <p>In a journey that covers her entire life in cameo, Angelica travels the world from St. Torpid's (''to buy forbidden jujubes'') to the Indian Ocean, where she has an ''assignation with a Eurasian Stoker'' on a ship. Repeatedly the animal appears and delivers its message, acting as a kind of constant and peripatetic conscience.</p>
        <p>The narrator of this musical is Ogdred Weary, one of Gorey's anagrammatized alter egos (along with Dogear Wryde and Regera Dowdy). He is played by Mr. McDermott, who bears a passing resemblance to the artist. He is tall (though shorter than Gorey) and has a piratical mustache (though no beard) and a properly sepulchral voice.</p>
        <p>During the last decade of his life Gorey was involved in a series of theatricals on Cape Cod, including a puppet show of his own invention. He gave his permission for the Provincetown musical but did not participate in it. After he saw it, however, he returned many times and made some suggestions, one that the title be changed to ''Hidden Turnips.'' There are frequent allusions to that vegetable in his work. Apparently he looked forward to the New York version but died before the production could be arranged. ''The Gorey Details,'' directed by Daniel Levans, credits Gorey as author.</p>
        <p>Several pieces in the revue derive from ''Tinned Lettuce,'' an earlier Gorey anthology presented at New York University. These include ''The Object Lesson'' and ''The Nursery Frieze'' and, as a refrain, the mysterious letters ''Q.R.V.'' Through countless references, ''Q.R.V.'' became a Gorey signature, letters chosen, he said, precisely because they had no meaning.</p>
        <p>''Gorey Details'' begins with Ogdred Weary riding onstage on a bicycle, reciting words from ''Q.R.V'': ''Haiku, Glue, Seppaku Maru, Wiggle, Wuggle, Wuggily Ump,'' followed by his comment, ''I really must write something today.''</p>
        <p>''The play is Ogdred Weary's writer's block,'' Mr. McDermott explained before a recent rehearsal. ''He doesn't really have any desire to write, but he knows he should. Then he finds objects in the basket on his bicycle and tries to get inspiration from them: a piece of driftwood, a brown china doorknob, a little urn that has Q.R.V. written on it.''</p>
        <p>The first act, he said, is narrative, and the second act is ''more of an open landscape and a bit more abstract and darker in tone.'' It moves from ''The Insect God'' to ''The Inanimate Tragedy,'' which Mr. McDermott characterized as a puppet show that is ''our little tribute to Julie Taymor.''</p>
        <p>The musical is a tribute to Gorey's long involvement with theater, which began when he was a student at Harvard University in the late 1940's. He and his roommate, the poet Frank O'Hara, joined the Poets Theater in Cambridge, where Gorey was active as a playwright and designer. His books have an irrepressible streak of theatricality, but it was not until ''Dracula'' on Broadway in 1977 that he immersed himself (somewhat) in a large stage project. The concept and the design of that show were based on his crosshatched art. His major interest at the time, in addition to his work, was the ballet. During this period he attended every performance of George Balanchine dances at the New York City Ballet.</p>
        <p>He remained stage-struck as well as balletomaniacal, which is why so many of his tales have references to those performing arts and to opera. In ''The Weeping Chandelier'' (in the first act of ''Gorey Details''), Theodora runs away from her home with three bats, Flip, Flop and Righty-ho. As a quartet, they create a variety act in which she plays the castanets while the bats perform on a tightrope. Together they become the rage of Europe until Theodora marries the Duque de Sangre y Trueno in the Church of the Whited Sepulcher. Then she retires from the stage, as do her batty partners.</p>
        <p>Throughout his life Gorey had a great affinity for creatures other than human and lived with an entourage of cats. (After his death they were given to cat-loving friends and relatives.) Significantly, the primary beneficiary of his estate is a charitable trust to be established for animals and other creatures. Money will go to needy cats and dogs, various invertebrates including insects, and, of course, bats like Flip, Flop and Righty-ho. One probable recipient is a bat conservancy in Austin, Tex.</p>
        <p>Just before the afternoon rehearsal began, Mr. Levans described Gorey's art as ''eccentric, honest, extreme and very precise: there's little room for embellishment, and if one begins to embellish, you've left the Gorey world.'' In performance, he said, the approach was to ''flip the page, next picture, flip the page, move on.''</p>
        <p>Onstage were three urns, the middle one labeled ''Hundreds of Thousands,'' which could serve as a slight exaggeration of the number of drawings produced by the artist. As Ogdred Weary began telling the story of the hippo, Allison DeSalvo danced across the stage to rippling music. Exiting and re-entering, she was pursued by Daniel C. Levine, proclaiming: ''Fly at once. All is discovered.''</p>
        <p>Overseeing the action, the director advised his actors, ''Can we get a little more Goreyesque?,'' and they performed the piece again. After her final voyage Ms. DeSalvo climbed aboard Mr. Levine's back. At 86, Angelica, now the dowager Duchess of Paltry, was last seen riding away on an admonitory hippopotamus.</p>
