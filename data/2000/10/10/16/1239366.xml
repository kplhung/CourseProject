        <p>On the day after Lemon Drop Kid and other favorites faltered at Belmont Park, the 3-year-old grass star King Cugat overcame several problems of time and pace, caught Mandarin Marsh after a duel down the homestretch and won the Jamaica Handicap by a nose yesterday.</p>
        <p>It was the sixth victory in nine starts in a dazzling career for King Cugat, who has not finished worse than second. He won this one despite an outside post position, a crawling pace and a rival who took the lead and held it most of the way.</p>
        <p>King Cugat gathered his resources and made his run on the final turn. He is a bay colt sired by Kingmambo, owned by Centennial Farms, trained by Bill Mott and ridden by Jerry Bailey. King Cugat sprang from the starting gate as the heavy favorite, but it took him about a mile to find his stride. Then he came flying on the outside from the sixth spot, caught Mandarin Marsh in a head-to-head run for home and won by a bob of the head.</p>
        <p>''There was a slow pace, and the race wasn't set up ideally for him,'' Mott said. ''But he was good enough to run the leader down.''</p>
        <p>Bailey, too, reported that the pace was agonizingly slow for King Cugat. ''He's a special horse, and he's got a great kick,'' he said.</p>
        <p>King Cugat, who is headed for the Hollywood Derby on Nov. 26, ran the mile and an eighth in 1:493 5  after dawdling fractions of 514 5  seconds for half a mile and 1:381 5  for a mile. He paid $2.90 for a $2 bet to win and earned $120,000 for his late rush.</p>
        <p>The Breeders' Cup preview weekend came to a rousing close with a pair of stakes for 2-year-olds with ambitions.</p>
        <p>In the Cowdin for colts, Fistfite won for the second time in three starts when he outran Todd Pletcher's highly regarded American Century, who lost second place by a nose to Windsor Castle. The winner took the lead after the first quarter-mile and stayed there to prevail by 2 1/4 lengths.</p>
        <p>Fistfite's trainer, Bill Badgett, said: ''I thought he might have been a shade farther back, but he is a pretty quick colt. We're still not sure how far he will go.''</p>
        <p>John Velazquez, who rode American Century, said, ''When I called on him, he had no run.''</p>
        <p>Fistfite ran the six and a half furlongs under Richard Migliore in 1:153 5 , and returned $10.80 for a $2 bet to win.</p>
        <p>The weekend came to a close with another upset, in the Astarita for juvenile fillies, as Xtra Heat won for the sixth time in six starts. She moved through on the rail to outduel the favored Gold Mover, who had won her first four starts but had not raced since July because of sore shins.</p>
        <p>Xtra Heat ran the six and a half furlongs under Mark Johnston in 1:16 3/5 and returned $17.80 on a $2 bet to win.</p>
        <p>''She's never been beaten in the stretch,'' said Ken Taylor, Xtra Heat's trainer. ''But at the eighth pole, I couldn't take it anymore and had to look the other way.''</p>
