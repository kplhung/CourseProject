        <p>A WOMAN UNKNOWN  Voices From a Spanish Life  By Lucia Graves  288 pages. Counterpoint. $25.</p>
        <p>The translator's deepest question is, ''Who am I?''</p>
        <p>It is deeper though less obvious than other questions: how to find equivalent meanings and tones and (because language remembers itself over the life of an individual and the generations of a culture) an equivalence of association and implication.  Language is identity. Two languages are two identities in shifting and often confounding struggle.</p>
        <p>''A Woman Unknown'' tells of the struggle. Lucia Graves could as well have titled it ''A Woman Translated.'' A daughter of the poet Robert Graves, raised in his Majorca home and married for 20 years to a Catalan musician, she is a professional translator in English and Spanish and someone in whom Britain and Spain have always coexisted and contended.</p>
        <p>Her writing is brainy and at times ravishing. It can also be repetitious and disjointed, losing hold of itself (of herself, that is) and delivering set pieces of uneven quality on assorted Spanish and Catalan topics. Losing hold of oneself is part of the point for this woman who feels herself a double expatriate in a single body.</p>
        <p>Lucia Graves was one of the poet's four children by his second wife, Beryl Pritchard. They lived in Deya, a Majorcan hill village, and in Palma.  At 14 she was sent to an international school in Geneva; later, after returning to Palma and helping Ramon, her future husband, run a jazz club, she studied Spanish literature and translation at Oxford.</p>
        <p>Still later, she returned once more to Majorca, married Ramon in 1970, moved to a village south of Barcelona, raised their children and did translations into Spanish, mainly of her father's novels. Gradually she and her husband drifted apart. After the children were grown they divorced and she moved to Britain.</p>
        <p>As much as a memoir, her book is a protracted meditation on her doubled life: the Spain that was a part of her and the English spirit and culture that kept it from being more than a part and that drew her to move back to Britain when she was in her 40's.</p>
        <p>Childhood in Deya was agreeably free: wandering the hills with her Majorcan playmates and absorbing both the village's pagan lore and its pagan-tinged Catholic traditions. She writes of water sprites in the upland rivulets and Good Friday bonfires, lit one by one in a spreading nighttime circle around the bay.</p>
        <p>When she was 10, the family moved down to Palma, and the untinged and penitential Catholicism of 1950's Spain took over. It was only a dozen years past the civil war, and the church, pro-Franco at the time, preached horrors about the defeated satanic republic. A young Falangist teacher at her school gave the girls marching drill instruction and told of nuns and priests burned to death, and worse.</p>
        <p>By contrast, the school nuns recounted the beauties of heaven so appealingly that 12-year-old Lucia desperately longed to go there. Being Anglican, she couldn't, of course.  Noting that 12 was the age of reason, a priest urged her to convert secretly. This was tempting but troubling:  a betrayal of the English home that offered ''The Girls' Own Annual'' instead of saints' pictures, and hot cross buns instead of unbelted street processions at Easter.</p>
        <p>Lucia laid the quandary before her father. He suggested waiting two years; it was a huge relief. By the time the cooling-off period was up, she had been shipped off to Geneva -- Calvin's town, not incidentally.</p>
        <p>It was the first doubleness of many. Her new school was secular and multinational, though culturally dominated by the Americans, ''who knew exactly how to be 15 1/2.'' They came with rigorously casual outfits, Elvis records and a missionary inkling that teenage was about to become a country of its own.</p>
        <p>Children from other cultures were less sure. Lucia, though smitten with Buddy Holly, longed for Majorca and plastered her room with Spanish posters. ''At night, when the lights went out in the bedrooms and the photographs on the walls darkened into squares of absence, we each revisited our private Ithaca.''</p>
        <p>As Ms. Graves recounts parts of her adult life, trying to assay her shifting balances, Spain is more materially and sensually present than Britain. This is in the very British tradition of such writers as Kipling, Norman Douglas and Gerald Brenan, only able to locate themselves in a soil other than their own. She is the Englishwoman contemplating the Spaniard inside herself; in no way could she be a Spaniard examining her internal Briton.</p>
        <p>The Spanish history and culture she feels closest to are Catalan and Majorcan, above all, its older, dying elements. She welcomes the democratic transformation after Franco's death but feels little kinship with the homogenized prosperity of recent decades. She writes of the raw new town south of Barcelona, a developer's dystopia, where her marriage gradually cooled over 20 years.</p>
        <p>Ms. Graves evokes the loss of savor in a Spain where identity and tragedy are, at long last, no longer intertwined. Sometimes she stumbles into plain nostalgia. Her doubleness, though, is memorably fixed; and never more so than in her translator's cosmology. Take the words for death:</p>
        <p>''In my experience, 'dead' was like a dull pain, like the quiet end of a smile.'' She thinks of her half-brother who vanished in Burma during World War II. ''Mort,'' on the other hand, ''was the sudden tolling of bells, deep mourning, the whole village scuttling up the hill to the church and the young men carrying the coffin on their shoulders, their hair plastered down with brillantina, their spotless Sunday clothes the pride of their mothers or wives.''</p>
        <p>The two words finally touched hands years later, she writes, ''when the strongest young men in the village arrived at the house looking smart and smelling of eau de Cologne, to help my brothers and my husband carry my father's coffin, first along the winding road to the village and then up the steep hill to the church; when at the door of every house people stood silently and watched the funeral cortege of the old English poet who had chosen to live among them for 50 years.''</p>
