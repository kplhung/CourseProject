        <p>Kindergartners are discussing the shapes they see at the ballpark: the square bases, the round ball, the oblong bullpen.</p>
        <p>Third graders are figuring out which surface is best for base stealers by sliding a blackboard eraser, felt side up, along a wooden desk, a carpet and a sheet of sandpaper.</p>
        <p>Sixth graders are studying compound words (bullpen, shortstop, southpaw), figures of speech (squeeze play, fly ball, hot corner) and words with multiple meanings (sacrifice, batter, goat).</p>
        <p>These are some of the special lessons this week in School District 28 in Queens, home of 30 public schools, 26,000 children and a superintendent and deputy superintendent who have been decked out in warring team colors for days, babbling statistics and childhood baseball memories.</p>
        <p>Schools throughout the region are accommodating baseball madness. A Jewish day school in White Plains, whose eighth graders are on a field trip to Washington, has arranged for a big screen television in their hotel  so the students can watch the games. A middle school in Manhattan has scheduled ''Wear Your Colors Day.'' One in Westchester has painted a stripe down the hallways to separate Mets and Yankees fans. A Catholic school in the Bronx had a contest to pick the winner of the Subway Series.</p>
        <p>But District 28 has mobilized with unusual fervor. Beginning with a memo to principals last Wednesday, Neil F. Kreinik, the superintendent, made it clear that he considered classrooms full of sleep-deprived, overexcited children a pedagogical opportunity, not a noisy nuisance.</p>
        <p>''Instead of fighting it,'' said Ron Levine, a district spokesman, ''we're going to make it work for us.''</p>
        <p>The result is a mini-curriculum,  put together in the space of one day by 20 staff development experts and teachers who assembled in district headquarters last Friday.</p>
        <p>''We don't usually operate in this mode,'' said Mr. Levine, with a nod toward the Board of Education's reputation for inefficiency. ''The reaction was 'You want us to do this in one day?' Then it became fun.''</p>
        <p>Fortified with urns of coffee and assisted by three secretaries, the teachers huddled at tables littered with newspapers, baseball books and Internet research. They brain-stormed in their subject areas, convened periodically as a group, brainstormed some more, wrote a rough draft and produced a final curriculum all in time for Monday morning distribution in classrooms. Students could adopt a player, write journal entries about his performance and design a baseball card, using both math and art skills. Homework could include a year-by-year history of the Subway Series plotted on a time line. Children could keep score, exchange the inning-by-inning hieroglyphics with a classmate and turn ''symbolic language'' into ''narrative.''</p>
        <p>What about assigning essays on baseball sketches or movies, from Abbott and Costello's ''Who's on First'' routine to Kevin Costner's ''Field of Dreams''? Or discussing the colorful, idiomatic language of headlines? Or making a list of careers related to baseball, without including the athletes?</p>
        <p>Math problems came easily. Two  schools get tickets to a game. The Queens school has 829 students, the one in the Bronx 788. If a bus has 43 seats, how many buses will it take to get them there? Or parking. A lot charges $10 for the first hour and $6 for every hour, or increment, thereafter. If your car is there from 7:30 to 11:15 p.m., how much do you pay?</p>
        <p>''Too much,'' two teachers said in unison.</p>
        <p>Once school resumed on Monday, the games themselves were grist for lessons. Mr. Kreinik urged each classroom teacher to use the bat-throwing incident in Game 2 as a means to discuss sportsmanship. In Stephanie Rosenblum's fourth-grade class at Public School 99 in Kew Gardens that meant a rousing debate about whether Roger Clemens had thrown a splintered bat at Mike Piazza on purpose or in the instinctual heat of competition.</p>
        <p>The consensus was the latter, and last night's homework assignment was to watch the news, digest the commentary, discuss the event with parents and siblings and write an essay. ''This is what real learning is,'' said Judith Ibrahimi, the school's principal.</p>
        <p>In planning the baseball curriculum, each lesson was designed to advance the new state performance standards. Students must learn the properties of objects, for instance. So this week they calculated the length of a bat and the weight of a ball. They must be prepared to answer ''document-based questions'' and practiced by interpreting newspaper articles about the changes in subway ridership since the last Subway Series.</p>
        <p>Hewing to the standards seemed less on the mind of Mr. Kreinik, his eyes round with excitement, his Mets' cap askew and his store of baseball trivia inexhaustible. Some of it is sure to make its way into the curriculum, so students, take note.</p>
        <p>There have been three intra-city World Series, besides the 14 in New York: Chicago vs. Chicago in 1906; the St. Louis Cardinals vs. the bygone St. Louis Browns in 1944; and the Bay Bridge Series, interrupted by an earthquake, in 1989.</p>
        <p>Should this question show up in multiple choice form do not be taken in. When there were two teams in Philadelphia and two in Boston they never faced off in a championship. Nor have the Angels and the Dodgers, dem bums who made all this possible.</p>
