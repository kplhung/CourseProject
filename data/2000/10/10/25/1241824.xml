        <p>Shares of Pacific Century CyberWorks plunged in Hong Kong, as a stock and bond offering announced by its founder, Richard Li, seemed to stoke, rather than soothe, fears about the company. Mr. Li said Pacific Century CyberWorks would seek to raise $1.8 billion through a $500 million rights issue and up to $1.3 billion in convertible bonds. Investors were not comforted, even though Mr. Li himself will underwrite the share sale and buy $500 million worth of the bonds. Analysts said the financial maneuvers indicated that CyberWorks was under mounting pressure to pay down $9 billion in debt. The stock fell 11.5 percent, to 74 cents a share, 80 percent off its high.</p>
