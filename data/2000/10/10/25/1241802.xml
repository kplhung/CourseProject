        <p>Qwest Communications International said third-quarter earnings rose 18.5 percent, easily surpassing Wall Street's estimates, on strong demand for its Internet and data services. The results, as expected, pleased Wall Street. Shares of Qwest rose $2.31, or 5 percent, to $47.69, after the earnings announcement. Qwest said that excluding merger-related costs and other nonrecurring items, it earned $231 million, or 14 cents a diluted share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30, compared with $195 million, or 12 cents a share, a year earlier. The Denver-based Qwest said sales rose 12.4 percent, to $4.8 billion, as the company opened five new Web host centers across the country and recorded more than $450 million in revenue from new contracts.</p>
