        <p>WHEN Damian Ivers, a tour-boat owner here, injured his back in August, he didn't go to a doctor's office; he logged on to eSalveo.com, an e-health Web site. He sent a description of his symptoms to his family doctor, who replied through eSalveo, a privately owned site that allows patients to communicate electronically with their doctors for a fee, opting out of the free government health care.</p>
        <p>''My doctor diagnosed it as a muscle injury and suggested putting ice on it,'' Mr. Ivers said, who is 31. ''It cost me $20, but my time is worth a lot more than that.''</p>
        <p>Americans may not think of Canada as a center of innovation  in medicine or in computers, but it is a leader in combining the two. Projects like regional health networks and standardized electronic medical records are further along here than in the United States, in large part because the bulk of health care does flow through government agencies that have a relatively unified system.</p>
        <p>''Canada-wide, we are not facing the institutional barriers that our colleagues may be facing in the United States with H.M.O.'s,'' said Dr. Alejandro Jadad, the director of eHealth Innovation at the University of Toronto. But e-health has its critics, who fear that the system may increase the number of malpractice lawsuits and make it easier to invade patients' privacy.</p>
        <p>Canada's health industry operates on a system of transfer payments. The government passes financing on to its 10 provinces and 3 territories. The provincial health ministries then set policy and deliver care through regional health authorities.</p>
        <p>Over the last five years, Health Canada, the federal agency responsible for health education, has created an Office of Health and the Information Highway and produced the Web site Canada-Health-Network.ca, a portal to more than 500 government-approved sites. And a study by PricewaterhouseCoopers found that more than half of Canadians seeking health information online go to Health Canada-sponsored sites.</p>
        <p>Federal and provincial governments are also forming Internet partnerships to provide medical services and save money. A federal-provincial health agreement reached last month earmarked $500 million to accelerate the use of information technology, particularly electronic health records.</p>
        <p>Dr. Jadad points out that the explosion in online medical information can make patients who do not have computer access feel disenfranchised. To help bridge the gap, he works with cancer patients, clinicians and researchers at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, to develop computer kiosks with information on studies and treatments. Volunteers are bringing the mobile kiosks to waiting rooms, hoping that technophobic patients will try to learn computer skills.</p>
        <p>While Canadian e-health technology has benefited from the country's centralized system, it is provinces like Alberta, which favors adopting a system combining public and private insurance, that have been aggressively putting electronic options into place. Among the innovations Alberta has pioneered is Alberta Wellnet, Canada's most comprehensive provincewide health information network.</p>
        <p>The network allows patient information to be shared among authorized doctors, hospitals, pharmacists and continuing-care facilities -- who use PIN numbers to obtain records -- reducing test duplication and administrative costs. Alberta Wellnet estimates that by linking the financial systems of just 4 of Alberta's 17 regional health authorities, the government has saved more than $10 million Canadian dollars (about $6.6 million), in initial costs, said Dr. Tom Noseworthy, a clinical adviser to the network.</p>
        <p>There are medical benefits, too. Oncologists at the Tom Baker Cancer Center in Calgary use Wellnet's hand-held computers, which have the latest treatment protocol. The computers retrieve patient records from the central network and alert doctors if their proposed treatment differs from the best-known practice or if it conflicts with the patient's other conditions.</p>
        <p>But not everyone thinks that network databases are the answer. Richard Morochove, a computer consultant in Toronto, said that a smart card, whose use is being studied in Ontario, is a more pragmatic solution.</p>
        <p>''You can pack a lot of information onto a card, and it will stop problems currently in the Canadian system, such as overmedication,'' said Mr. Morochove. ''Right now, you can see two doctors and get two prescriptions. By putting information on a smart card the doctor will be able to see the recent history of the patient.''</p>
        <p>The card would also sidestep the main vulnerability in the electronic networking of records: the threat to privacy. According to a recent poll by Ipso Reid (formerly called Angus Reid), 84 percent of Canadian Internet users were concerned about providing personal details online, and the PricewaterhouseCoopers study found that just 5 percent of Canadian visitors to health-related sites had provided personal information.</p>
        <p>''There have been cases in Canada where medical records have ended up in garbage bags on streets,'' observed Mr. Morochove.  He also thinks that e-health could spawn more lawsuits. ''I think it's only a matter of time before lawsuits are filed against some of these sites where someone has side effects they weren't advised about or interactions with other medications,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Yet as far as Damian Ivers is concerned,  he has used eSalveo.com two more times and recommended it to his wife and his business partner. Still, the Internet has its limits. ''If I started getting chest pains and numbness in my arm, I don't think I'd go online,'' he said.</p>
