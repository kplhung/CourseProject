        <p>IT three o'clock this afternoon, give or take an hour, countless employees will pick up the telephone and make a most unbusinesslike call.

        <p>With all the talk in the workplace lately about the needs of parents, it is striking how much of that talk is about the needs of new parents rather than those whose children are in school. Corporate America is justly proud of its maternity-leave policies and its child care centers. But, as my grandmother used to say ''little kids, little problems; big kids, big problems,'' and less attention is being paid to those of us who are paying less attention once school lets out.</p>
        <p>''Nearly all the progress has been around infancy and preschool, as if children have no problems once they start kindergarten,'' said Carol Maxym, a psychotherapist and author of ''Teens in Turmoil'' (Viking Penguin, 2000). The mother of one of her patients, she said, ''won't make an appointment after 2 because she might not know where her daughter might be.'' Another told me she would sneak out of the office for an hour every afternoon to pick up her teenage son so she could be certain he would make it home from school.</p>
        <p>The 3 o'clock phone call has its roots in the 19th century, back when most families lived on farms. There were crops to be tended during the summer, so schools necessarily closed for three months. There were chores to be done before dark, which is why schools let out in the middle of the afternoon.</p>
        <p>''Our society is still living on a schedule that made sense then but makes no sense now,'' said Dr. Jody Heymann, director of policy for the Harvard University Center for Society. She is the author of ''The Widening Gap: Why American Working Families Are in Jeopardy and What Can Be Done About It'' (Basic Books, 2000).</p>
        <p>''Our children, for the most part, don't live on farms anymore, and their parents aren't back on the farm waiting for them to come home,'' she said. ''Still, we're stuck with a situation where school days are two-thirds shorter than workdays and the school year has 30 percent fewer days than the school year.''</p>
        <p>The result of this temporal gap are children like 9-year-old Josh Ray, who is profiled by Laura Sessions Stepp in ''Our Last Best Shot'' (Riverhead Books, 2000), her book about the rocky terrain of adolescence. Josh's mother, Gail, works in the loan department of a bank in Ulysses, Kan., and his father at a meat-packing plant. The local middle school doesn't offer any after-school activities, and because this family actually does live on a (nonworking) farm, there are few other children close enough to visit. After a bad experience with an inept baby sitter, Josh and his 8-year-old brother began to stay home alone in the afternoons, and their mother checked in by phone as often as she could.</p>
        <p>''I spent a lot of time thinking about all the trouble they could get into when I wasn't there,'' Mrs. Ray told me. Those visions turned all too real one afternoon when the boys played with matches and accidentally set fire to a couch. After that, the calls came more often, and she found it even harder to concentrate on making bank loans.</p>
        <p>As Dr. Heymann points out, as stressful and unsatisfying as the 3 o'clock call might be, workers like Mrs. Ray are lucky that they are able to call at all. ''Sitting in your white-collar cubicle, listening to parents calling home, you forget that for many workers, that call is not an option,'' she said. ''They have no access to a telephone, or they're not allowed to leave the factory floor.''</p>
        <p>The solution, she believes, lies not with the telephone, but with the clock and the calendar. ''We need a longer school day and a longer school year,'' she said. ''It's that simple.''</p>
        <p>Other countries, she points out, have done this ''and their economies certainly haven't collapsed.'' American children go to school  180 days, while those in the Netherlands and Luxembourg have a 220-day school year, with Germany close behind at 213. If school textbooks and equipment were 100 years out of date, she said, parents would protest. So why do they accept a school schedule that is a century behind the times?</p>
