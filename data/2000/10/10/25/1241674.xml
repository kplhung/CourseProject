        <p>The transfer to London from Montreal was Sophie Bouchard's for the asking. And Ms. Bouchard, 31, the top sales representative in Canada for TMP Worldwide Inc., an executive recruiter based in New York, wanted it badly.</p>
        <p>But what about her husband? Stephane Licari, 29, had a promising sales career of his own at an Internet company. Was he supposed to just quit his job and start over in a foreign country?</p>
        <p>When Ms. Bouchard told her boss about their situation, she set up an interview for him with TMP's head of European sales that same day. A job offer soon followed.</p>
        <p>''I never thought they'd think about my husband,'' marveled Ms. Bouchard, who moved to London with her husband and two sons, aged 7 and 8, this month.</p>
        <p>Employers are thinking about every angle they can these days to keep employees happy, creating incentives from flexible working hours to signing bonuses and even discount shopping programs.</p>
        <p>And now the latest perk: finding jobs for their employees' significant others.</p>
        <p>''I wanted to make sure we retained Sophie,'' said Katherine Corrado, her boss, a senior vice president of global sales and marketing at TMP. ''Her husband was perfect for the job.''</p>
        <p>The trend is most pronounced at the hiring stage, when counteroffers from rivals abound. A decade ago, most employers would have done little more than send out the help wanted section from the local newspaper to an applicant's spouse, recruiting specialists say. But with some key executive positions taking months to fill, companies are adding new inducements to their mix of pay and perks.</p>
        <p>And the more desperate they are to fill a position, the bigger the boost they are willing to give to the spouses' careers, said Thomas Bloch, the owner of Southern Research Services, a recruiting firm in Tampa, Fla. Mr. Bloch cites the example of one of his clients, a South Carolina company, which was so eager to hire an executive in Michigan as its director of benefits and compensation that it offered to spend thousands of dollars to relocate her husband's car-renovation business.</p>
        <p>The wife ended up turning down the six-figure job largely because of her husband's reluctance to start over. But nobody can fault the company for not trying. ''Companies are to some extent going to extremes,'' Mr. Bloch said.</p>
        <p>According to the most recent study by the Employee Relocation Council in Washington, about half of employers surveyed in 1998 provided some sort of spouse/partner employment assistance and of those, 34 percent had formal programs in place to address the issue, up from 22 percent in 1990. The average cost of the assistance was $1,545, the study found, though some employers spent up to $20,000 for expenses like hiring head hunters.</p>
        <p>And those figures do not count the hours clocked by employees at companies that are trying to lure new talent. Kelsey Berg, a recruiting strategist at Microsoft in Redmond, Wash., recalled doing research to see if the local school system had any openings that would appeal to a job candidate's wife. ''I even pulled a favor with my sixth-grade daughter's teacher so she could talk to someone who worked in the Seattle school district,'' Mrs. Berg said.</p>
        <p>The growth of the two-career family, and the increasing self-confidence of skilled workers in the current hot economy, are driving the trend. ''People don't operate today out of fear and trepidation,'' said Mordean Taylor-Archer, an associate provost at Kansas State University in Manhattan, Kan., who deals with career issues. ''They are more willing and open to talk about their needs -- their spouse, their kids.''</p>
        <p>And their standard of living. The economy may be hot, but the dark side is a low savings rate and high levels of personal debt. Many families cannot afford even a temporary dip in their income. ''People can't survive long these days without the second income,'' said Patrick Lennahan, director of the career center at Roger Williams University in Bristol, R.I.</p>
        <p>Some companies are even plunging in with tips for spouses without being asked. Michael Honig, who moved to Seattle from Denver to start a job as a training specialist for Microsoft this month, said he thought the company was paying lip service to career of his wife, Emily, when it asked for her resume in his final job interviews.</p>
        <p>But Mrs. Honig, who worked in human resources for a Denver company, is being considered for two jobs at Microsoft and for an opening at another Seattle company, thanks to Microsoft's help, he said.</p>
        <p>While such employment assistance is becoming more prevalent, recruiting experts say, many companies are reluctant to talk about the practice, fearful of setting a precedent they will be unable to live up to for every new hire.</p>
        <p>In September, the University of Alabama in Birmingham started the Spouse/Partner Relocation Network, a consortium of local employers that helps match job openings at member organizations with the spouses of new university hires.</p>
        <p>''It's a lot better than just looking at the Monster.com listings,'' said Connie McLernon, an administrative assistant for a Montgomery design firm, who is getting career help from the university's network. Her husband, Dennis, accepted a job as an acting instructor at the University of Alabama in August but he has been commuting from Montgomery until the couple sells their home and she finds a job.</p>
        <p>Whether a company has a formal policy or not, Damian Birkel, executive director and founder of the Professionals in Transition Support Group in Winston-Salem, N.C., suggested job seekers take the initiative and ask about partner help. But, he advised, wait until a potential employer is close to making a job offer.</p>
        <p>In any case, he added, ''You're not going to get it if you don't ask.''</p>
