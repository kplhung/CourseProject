        <p>ONE executive went to a start-up called Elemica. One founded the Internet company CheMatch. Another heads Fob.com, a purchasing hub.</p>
        <p>After decades of working at the Dow Chemical Company, these old-timers have dispersed, joining the free-for-all world of online exchanges.</p>
        <p>As in other industries where business-to-business e-commerce is upsetting the old order, the chemical industry is spawning dozens of companies, with almost as many business models. These start-ups fall into two broad categories: independently led, venture-capital-backed marketplaces, usually called dot-coms, or large consortiums led by the sector's behemoths.</p>
        <p>The three Dow alumni illustrate the division, with those at CheMatch and Fob.com choosing the dot-com model, and the third selecting Elemica, a consortium founded by Dow, the DuPont Company, BASF A.G., Bayer A.G., BP Amoco, the Atofina unit of Elf Aquitane, Rohm &amp; Haas and the Royal Dutch/Shell Group.</p>
        <p>This division is also playing out in other industries -- forest and paper products, metals, computing and energy -- where business-to-business e-commerce has spurred both Internet companies and joint ventures among big, established companies.</p>
        <p>In the chemical industry, the story has been typical.</p>
        <p>''The first dot-coms looked at the business-to-consumer model,'' said Andy DuPont, the director for electronic channels at Dow and not related to the duPont family of chemical fame. ''They looked at Amazon and thought, 'There's a model I can exploit in the chemical industry.' ''</p>
        <p>Such was the case at CheMatch, a dot-com that Fred Cook, a former vice president of Dow, began developing in 1997.</p>
        <p>''When we put this thing together,'' Mr. Cook recalled, ''B-to-B wasn't even an acronym; e-commerce wasn't even a word. The new consortia weren't even envisioned.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cook and other entrepreneurs built trading sites that ranged in complexity from searchable catalogs of products to  reverse auctions to anonymous trading rooms like those offered by CheMatch.</p>
        <p>Back then, the major players were merely curious. DuPont and Bayer took equity stakes in CheMatch. Dow, BASF and others invested in ChemConnect, an e-marketplace. Eastman Chemical bought into Commerx PlasticsNet, a trading site.</p>
        <p>But soon, as in other sectors, the big guys became concerned that they were falling behind.</p>
        <p>''Lots of chemical companies invested in the pure-play dot-coms, learned how they operated and realized the implications of an outside company having access to their transaction data,'' said Mike Roberts, the editor in chief of e-Chemmerce, a Web site that covers the chemical industry's forays into e-commerce. ''They thought, 'Wait a minute, they own the store -- why don't we all take small stakes in a new company and get maximum control and profits?' ''</p>
        <p>In the last year, three chemicals consortiums have formed: Envera, for chemical and petroleum companies; Omnexus, by leaders in plastics; and Elemica, which includes several founders of Omnexus.</p>
        <p>But analysts and chemical industry insiders argue that the two styles of e-business are more than a contest over territory. The battle, all agreed, is over what services the different marketplaces can and will provide.</p>
        <p>The dot-coms have focused on negotiations and transactions. For example, Richard Payne, the president of Fob.com, speaks frequently of ''price discovery,'' or bidding. If sodium laureth sulfate is needed to make dandruff shampoo, buyers can ''discover'' the prices of different suppliers by comparing multiple bids. At Fob.com, a company can join a buying group that will negotiate lower prices for larger quantities. A company can also make spot transactions, one-time purchases to try a new supplier or quick buys that fill a need.</p>
        <p>Similarly, CheMatch has been an innovator in pricing. The site was the first to introduce anonymous trading in February 1998, which meant that rather than spending days on the phone spinning and counter-spinning prospective partners, buyers could go to CheMatch and engage in a streamlined, straightforward process.</p>
        <p>In a Web ''trading room,'' buyers can negotiate with suppliers whom they have already approved. Both buyers and suppliers, however, remain anonymous during the negotiations. Traders can shift their bids, but their competitors can see the changes.</p>
        <p>These dot-com marketplaces can link more buyers and suppliers, spur competition and speed negotiations. But as major players have begun trying to leverage the Internet to their own ends, a new set of goals is taking precedence. The mandate for e-commerce has become grander: hook up everything. Entire companies -- from their in-house billing systems to their warehouses -- have to blend with the Internet.</p>
        <p>The move stems partly from the last phase of the computer revolution when, in the 1990's, companies invested in companywide systems that often entailed vexing, chaotic fulfillments and questionable returns. The current thinking is that if those upgrades have not yet paid off, the Internet could be the last link in the system to finally make them productive.</p>
        <p>With this in mind, the consortiums are rushing to deepen connectivity -- not just allowing a buyer and seller to agree on a price, send out an invoice and make payments over the Web, but moving that information into each company's databases.</p>
        <p>''The vision that leading industrialists have,'' said Mr. Roberts of e-Chemmerce, ''is hyperefficient digital supply chains, where direct electronic links stretching from, say, the oil field to the shampoo buyer let companies and entire industries move from production-push and its myriad inefficiencies -- bad forecasts, big inventories, idled factories, etc. -- to demand-pull.''</p>
        <p>The huge joint ventures are promising  businesswide change, which would eventually lead to something close to production on demand.</p>
        <p>David Pleasance, a chemicals expert in management consulting at PricewaterhouseCoopers, used the example of ''a major chemical manufacturer supplying paint, plastics or lubricants into the auto industry.''</p>
        <p>''What the consortia model of e-business will enable,'' Mr. Pleasance said, ''is, one, the processing of today's business -- better ordering, scheduling, billing, collection -- but, two, much greater information flows allowing the companies to collaborate more seamlessly about creating new products, managing inventory, handling logistics.''</p>
        <p>Elemica promises to be a hub for this communication, and its first traders should be plugged in by the second quarter of 2001.</p>
        <p>''Once a producer connects to the backside of Elemica,'' said Dennis Campbell, the chief operating officer of Elemica and a Dow alumnus, ''we can hook them into thousands and thousands of customers.'' Elemica plans to integrate order processing and fulfillment with companies' existing systems, and it will focus on long-term business relationships.</p>
        <p>Mr. DuPont of Dow described the contrasts between dot-coms and Elemica as follows: ''The dot-coms saw an opportunity to provide spot markets with anonymity, focusing on aged inventory, excess supply. When Dow wants to sell or procure on a spot basis, then we use ChemConnect. But if we want to have a committed contractual supply from someone, and know exactly what it is and when it's going to be available, that's the way Dow will use Elemica. If I'm a Dow buyer, will I go out to ChemConnect to see what's happening there and get a better price there? Sure. But Elemica is focused on other efficiencies -- payment terms, future demand, availability.''</p>
        <p>Of course, in the online world, planning and guessing can be interchangeable. ''Trying to predict what the Internet is going to mean for the chemical industry,'' Mr. DuPont said, ''is like the Wright brothers at Kitty Hawk predicting frequent-flier miles.''</p>
        <p>For now, the dot-coms are struggling to respond to the behemoths that are threatening their lead, by promising more services, hoping to interconnect with the consortium's networks or emphasizing the value of their specialization.</p>
        <p>At CheMatch, Mr. Cook argued that niches will persist. ''For bulk commodity chemicals, you probably will go to CheMatch; for specialty chemicals, somewhere else,'' he said. But he also wondered whether his and other ventures would eventually form one giant marketplace.</p>
        <p>''We might link up with any number of these different types of consortia,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Payne of Fob.com had a similar conclusion. When it came to hooking up corporate computer systems, a huge task requiring a lot of capital, he said, Fob.com might piggyback on the consortiums. ''We would connect through them to the supplier base,'' he said.</p>
        <p>If that were the end of the story -- that as e-business in the chemical industry matures, the best of the early dot-coms interconnect with the come-lately consortiums -- it would provide an Internet-style twist to the narrative. The big guys would join with the small, data flowing through everyone's wires simultaneously, and before long, the Dow alumni would find themselves working together again.</p>
