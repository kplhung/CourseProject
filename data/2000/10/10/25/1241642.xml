        <p>CONVERSATIONS in the boardroom are using the language of the bedroom -- openness, commitment, vulnerability and trust -- as e-nabled companies give one another come-hither looks. It isn't mergers they want, but partners. With the Internet cutting the cost of information exchanges and transactions, e-commerce executives say networked partnering is the best way to create goods and services.</p>
        <p>But declaring yourselves an item, even in business, always raises certain expectations of intimacy. In an Internet context, these expectations are higher. After all, the premise of the promised supply-chain revolution is that manufacturers and their suppliers can become vastly more efficient if the chain becomes see-through and everyone knows how things are going.</p>

        <p>CONVERSATIONS in the boardroom are using the language of the bedroom -- openness, commitment, vulnerability and trust -- as e-nabled companies give one another come-hither looks. It isn't mergers they want, but partners. With the Internet cutting the cost of information exchanges and transactions, e-commerce executives say networked partnering is the best way to create goods and services.</p>
        <p>But declaring yourselves an item, even in business, always raises certain expectations of intimacy. In an Internet context, these expectations are higher. After all, the premise of the promised supply-chain revolution is that manufacturers and their suppliers can become vastly more efficient if the chain becomes see-through and everyone knows how things are going.</p>
        <p>In this world, knowledge -- information, expertise and more -- is not just power. It is an asset to be appropriated, refined, enhanced and then sold. No wonder the demand is high among Internetworked partners to bare it all.</p>
        <p>''Prepare to be naked,'' said Don Tapscott, the chairman of Digital 4Sight, a strategy consulting and research firm in Toronto, and a co-author of ''Digital Capital,'' a guide to corporate survival in the new economy. ''To succeed on the Internet, especially in these groups we call B-webs, companies must prepare to reveal information about themselves, their products and their business processes, even previously sacrosanct information, and even to sometime competitors, because it will be in their common interest.''</p>
        <p>It makes sense for businesses to want to give each other advice where and when it can do the most good. ''You need your partners to be able to ask the right questions, to elicit the information they need to give you their best service or product,'' said Jakob Nielsen, a principal of the Nielsen Norman Group, a Silicon Valley company that specializes in making the Internet easier to use.</p>
        <p>But many companies are, well, prudes. Justifiably so, say some business consultants, noting that no company wants to hand informational crown jewels to competitors. ''Not everyone should whip off their clothes and hop into the hot tub,'' Mr. Tapscott said. ''Companies need to think through what information do we need, and what do we have to provide? What are the safeguards? What deals do we make so that information is not used by our competitors? What is the level of trust here?''</p>
        <p>Even in a trusting relationship, partners may want to keep some fig leaves strategically in place. ''You may have supply-chain problems internally that you don't want to reveal,'' said Ken Ouchi, a corporate vice president at the Solectron Corporation, one of the nation's leading providers of electronic manufacturing services.</p>
        <p>Or you may want to augment information with your knowledge. ''That becomes your added value,'' Dr. Ouchi said. A customer orders 120 components, for example. You have 100 on hand and, in reality, you know only 90 will be needed. ''Pure transparency, being stark-naked,'' Dr. Ouchi said, ''would result in your telling your partner you don't have enough. But managing the relationship, and the information, means saying you can fill the order.''</p>
        <p>That information must be managed within a process, like invoicing or product servicing, that is also a relationship, consultants and e-business executives say. Witness the efforts of Fadi B. Chehade, the chairman and chief executive of Viacore Inc., which allows supply-chain trading partners to exchange and manage real-time business processes using the Internet. Mr. Chehade spearheaded RosettaNet, an industrywide consortium that built consensus among computer and electronic component supply chains to standardize information processes.</p>
        <p>''Companies don't understand that information sharing is really business process /relationship-centric, not information/transaction-centric,'' he said. ''From this ignorance, or maybe fear, they relegate information sharing to the technical side of the house, to people who can manage information but who cannot manage relationships, people who will take your knowledge currency and squander it.''</p>
        <p>An example: ''Formulating RosettaNet, we gathered people from throughout the industry to discuss warranty management,'' Mr. Chehade said. ''Some companies sent information technology people. What we needed were warranty experts who could determine what information is needed to guarantee warranties, what should the work flow be and its time constraints.'' Standardizing B-to-B dialogues in this way, he added, makes them replicable and gives participants a measure of control and security.</p>
        <p>''It's all about the business process,'' said Eric S. Michlowitz, the director of supply- chain e-business solutions at the Dell Computer Company. ''You have a set of objectives in mind. You need a process to achieve them. The process will involve Dell, a build-to-order computer company, and its suppliers, along with the information needed to support that process to meet the business objective.''</p>
        <p>By moving the process and the relationship to the Internet, Dell did more with the information it already shared, like quality deviation -- the number of components rejected on assembly lines. ''Dell and its suppliers could see problems in real time at the same time, as they were forming,'' Mr. Michlowitz said, ''so we could decide how to act.''</p>
        <p>But Dell went further, shedding some information inhibitions. ''We gave suppliers access to the link between our planning side -- here's what we think we'll need in terms of components -- and our execution side -- here's what we're really consuming -- so that they can shift inventory to the factories in need,'' Mr. Michlowitz said. ''Now, we can see the train wrecks coming and work to prevent demand outpacing supply.''</p>
        <p>And since Dell ships its own computers directly to customers, suppliers who introduce new products can immediately see how they are performing and where. ''Internet technology allows our entire supply chain to capitalize on our information,'' Mr. Michlowitz said. ''We think that makes us more attractive to suppliers.''</p>
        <p>Dell, however, does retain some modesty. ''We won't show suppliers their share of our business -- what percentage of our hard drives any one company provides, for example,'' Mr. Michlowitz said. ''We don't want them to be able to leverage that. We do give them score cards indicating how they are doing against the best in their class, without naming names.'' Nor will Dell share cost data. Of course, Dell would derive more than voyeuristic pleasure from learning what percentage of a supplier's business it constitutes. Not all suppliers are willing to show or tell, however.</p>
        <p>As for security, Dell puts its trust in nondisclosure agreements and its own high standards. ''We constantly remind people here that supplier information is sacrosanct,'' Mr. Michlowitz said. ''Sharing it inappropriately is a firable offense.''</p>
        <p>AT I.B.M., the historically tight security is tighter still for its Dell service account, and includes a jointly held database external to both companies' computer systems. After all, in PC production, the two companies are competitors. It took ''executive involvement on both sides'' to open communications, said Tom E. Conway, director for global services at I.B.M., who negotiated the agreement for the company.</p>
        <p>Nowadays, it seems that I.B.M. Global Services and Dell are playing ''getting to know you,'' sharing information weekly, sometimes daily, regarding service calls; the warehousing of Dell replacement parts; which parts are needed for a repair, as against the ones Dell supplies; and how I.B.M. performs in the field. ''Obviously, we see performance data about their products,'' Mr. Conway said, noting the ''contractual fire wall'' -- with stiff financial penalties -- requiring that that information stays within Global Services.</p>
        <p>The safeguards don't end there. Not only are Global Services and the PC division housed in two different cities (Atlanta and Raleigh, N.C., respectively), but there is also the so-called DMZ database that holds all transactions and information moving between the two companies. ''Only 57 people in all of I.B.M. worldwide have the ability to see those data,'' Mr. Conway said. And those 57 people, he added, are restricted from switching to I.B.M.'s PC company for at least three years after they finish with Dell.</p>
        <p>It was yet another way, he said, to change I.B.M.'s culture regarding Internet-interfirm cooperation and to ensure that both sides were comfortable exposing themselves.</p>
        <p>''We long ago learned that the most effective way to work with others in a firm is to let down your guard and share knowledge,'' Mr. Tapscott said. ''Now, we're learning that the same is true for working with other firms. Before, we needed to break down the silos within the firm. Now, we need to break down the silos that are the firm.''</p>
