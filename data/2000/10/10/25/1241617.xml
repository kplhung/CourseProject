        <p>Signature Toys offers kits like treasure chests and birdhouses, which parents and children can build together. A new series of holiday ornament kits will join the lineup.</p>
        <p>Most sales of the Signature lines have been generated through traditional retail outlets, said Rob Cowin, the president of Signature Tools. He also said they were reorganizing and would have a new Web site by the end of the year. ''Our goal is to channel more sales activity through the Web site while maintaining direct contact support,'' Mr. Cowin said.</p>
