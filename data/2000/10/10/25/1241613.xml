        <p>SOME worry that fraud on the Internet will spread like kudzu, choking the growth of e-commerce. Others worry that the Internet's spectacular growth will become its greatest barrier as infrastructure strains and incompatible systems proliferate globally.</p>
        <p>Concerns like these fall under the decidedly unsexy heading of technical standards.

        <p>SOME worry that fraud on the Internet will spread like kudzu, choking the growth of e-commerce. Others worry that the Internet's spectacular growth will become its greatest barrier as infrastructure strains and incompatible systems proliferate globally.</p>
        <p>Concerns like these fall under the decidedly unsexy heading of technical standards. They have reached a sufficient level to lead international consumer organizations and those who develop standards to call for global rules to govern e-commerce. The European Commission, for example, recently announced the creation of the E-Confidence Forum to address these issues. And the Online Voluntary Codes Research Forum, which is sponsored by the Canadian Office of Consumer Affairs, is also inviting volunteers to work on e-commerce standardization.</p>
        <p>After a spring meeting in Kyoto, Japan, 25 international consumer groups and standards organizations, like the American National Standards Institute and the Committee on Consumer Policy of the International Organization for Standardization, agreed to form a global forum. Called the E-Commerce Standards Solutions Forum, the group has been determining how to standardize e-commerce practices and provide consumer protection.</p>
        <p>The committee released a statement after the session citing ''mounting evidence that many consumers are reluctant to engage in electronic commerce due to a lack of confidence in the reliability of e-commerce merchants, concerns about privacy and security, and confusion about the reliability of online codes and seals, programs which claim to protect and promote the consumer interest.''</p>
        <p>Linda Golodner, the president of the National Consumers League, a nonprofit advocacy group in Washington, attended the Kyoto session and is participating in continuing efforts to bring some order to cyberspace purchasing. She elaborated here on the issues and offered her views about the new global e-commerce forum.</p>
        <p>Q. Why do we care about standardizing e-commerce practices?</p>
        <p>A. From the consumer's viewpoint, we're participating in this global marketplace that's been expanded by our ability to purchase through the Internet. Obviously, people have been buying around the world for a number of years, but the number of people and the opportunities to purchase from different companies and different people has certainly escalated with the use of the Internet.</p>
        <p>As a consumer organization, we've been working with consumer groups both here and abroad, and with the Federal Trade Commission, trying to sort out what consumer protection exists, including that for small business and business in general. There are different levels of protection: there's security on confidentiality, privacy on sharing personal information, fraud. But I also think the general concern for consumers would focus on being able to use e-commerce with as much confidence as you would walking into a store.</p>
        <p>The first thing you look at is the information that's available to make a purchase -- what you're buying, whether the whole price is there, trying to find out the quality of the purchase and understanding the add-ons to prices, like fees. If you're going country to country, there is the whole area of foreign fees, taxes, shipping costs, duties and tariffs.</p>
        <p>Even more important for the consumer would be policies for returning the merchandise or canceling the contract if it's a service. Consumers need to know at what level they're responsible and whether or not they'll get a piece of paper after making the transaction. They also need off-line contact information, an address or telephone number.</p>
        <p>Take the example of prescription drugs. What happens now is sometimes you get on a site that's based in the United States, but soon find yourself in another country. A lot of consumers don't realize that.</p>
        <p>Q. Can you give an example of how standardization helps?</p>
        <p>A. One level is legal issues. Which jurisdiction applies, especially when buying state to state in the United States or purchasing worldwide? There are a lot of similarities to purchasing from a catalog. The consumer feels more in control there, though that may be just a perception. And we'll be looking to alternatives to speed up dispute resolutions, which may be the answer to settling claims across borders. This would be online, in your own language and with lawyers you would accept who could mediate or arbitrate. There's a company that eBay uses to handle disputes; it is being studied as a good model.</p>
        <p>Q. What are other things that would help standardization?</p>
        <p>A. Obviously, if a consumer would be confident to flow from country to country on the Internet -- or surf from site to site -- you need standard information available. The consumer should be able to look at any Web site and be able to seek information about the purchase. It should be as easy as looking at a box of food that lists the nutrition facts. They should know where to look on any site for the price, additional fees, quantity and quality of ingredients, information on off-line contacts, on product return and shipping time frame. This is standard disclosure information that should be on every Web site.</p>
        <p>The working group will also be exploring applying third-party marks and labels to provide consumer confidence. At a meeting in September, the forum continued to review priorities. The bottom line is there should be assurance to consumers whether it's an F.D.A. symbol on prescription drugs or something like the well-known safety marks. But because of fraud, you have to ensure you aren't welcoming too many symbols that the fraudulent operators can counterfeit.</p>
        <p>Q. What about fraud?</p>
        <p>A. It's very difficult. We've talked about having portals where consumers can go to gain confidence. But the Web is almost too big to handle. It would also be easy, I'm sure, to hack into portals and change all those sites around. I don't know what the answer would be other than the age-old reliance on brand names, good service contracts and warranties.</p>
        <p>Q. How do technical standards figure into fraud?</p>
        <p>A. Being able to purchase is only one level. On the next level, obviously we need to assure that technology is there to protect the security and confidentiality that also has to be standardized. The Consumers League and other groups would encourage the development of international standards that protect anyone -- individuals or businesses -- making purchases on the Internet.</p>
        <p>We're hoping to see the technology issues sorted out in the marketplace. We don't want to see people losing out by buying technology that won't function in an e-commerce world.</p>
