        <p>The New York office of TBWA/ Chiat/Day, part of the TBWA Worldwide unit of the Omnicom Group, said yesterday that it would relinquish part of the Kmart Corporation account, which the office was awarded last month.</p>
        <p>The assignment being relinquished is for Route 66, a private-label brand of jeans sold only in Kmart stores.

        <p>The New York office of TBWA/ Chiat/Day, part of the TBWA Worldwide unit of the Omnicom Group, said yesterday that it would relinquish part of the Kmart Corporation account, which the office was awarded last month.</p>
        <p>The assignment being relinquished is for Route 66, a private-label brand of jeans sold only in Kmart stores. The San Francisco office of TBWA/Chiat/Day is the agency for the Levi's brand of jeans sold by Levi Strauss &amp; Company. Advertising Age reported this week that Levi Strauss executives said they would consider it a conflict if the New York office were to work on another jeans brand.</p>
        <p>Brent Hodgins, a spokesman for the agency's New York office, said the decision was unrelated to the Levi Strauss account. ''Since the very first meeting with Kmart,'' he said, ''we've involved several Omnicom communications resources.'' The Route 66 assignment will now be handled by an Omnicom sibling agency, Zimmerman &amp; Partners in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., Mr. Hodgins said. Kmart spent about $15 million on a fall campaign for Route 66, Advertising Age reported, which was created by the previous Kmart agency, Campbell Mithun in Minneapolis, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies.</p>
