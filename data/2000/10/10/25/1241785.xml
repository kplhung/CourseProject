        <p>Spike Lee hates television. So he has signed on to change it.</p>
        <p>Studios USA, which produces ''Law and Order,'' ''Law and Order: Special Victims Unit'' and ''Deadline,'' among other programs, has completed a development deal with Mr. Lee. Under the terms of the deal, he will develop new programs for broadcast television in conjunction with the studio.</p>
        <p>David Kissinger, president of Studios USA programming, said that Mr. Lee approached him after he completed his latest film, ''Bamboozled,'' which satirizes network television's treatment of black people.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kissinger said that after making the deal he received mixed messages from network executives.</p>
        <p>''In all candor, some were not interested and others were really jazzed about it,'' Mr. Kissinger said. ''There are people who think that he is too inflammatory and there are others who call me and say, 'We want to be first in line.'''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lee did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kissinger said he had discussed possibilities with Mr. Lee, from a half-hour show shot with a single camera to a more traditional hourlong drama.</p>
        <p>''Do I expect that it's going to be, necessarily, the most mainstream and risk-free kind of project?'' said Mr. Kissinger. ''No. But that's not what you sign on for when you get into business with Spike Lee.''</p>
