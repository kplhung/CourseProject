      <abstract>
        <p>Correction of Oct 23 article on investments by large companies in sexually explicit entertainment: News Corp has been cutting its holdings in EchoStar Communications Corp, has no direct control over company and no direct investment in 'adult' films</p>
      </abstract>

    <body.content>
      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>An article on Monday about investments by large companies in sexually explicit entertainment referred incompletely to the relationship between the News Corporation and the EchoStar Communications Corporation, which provides explicit films by satellite to subscribers. The article quoted a lawyer for a video store owner in Provo, Utah, as saying that his client's prosecution was unfair because many companies that provided ''adult'' entertainment were heavily backed by large corporations, including the News Corporation.</p>
        <p>At the time of the trial, which ended on March 31, 1999, the News Corporation owned about 37 percent of EchoStar, but by the next reporting period, in June 1999, the holding was reported as 14 percent. The News Corporation's last federal filing shows an 11 percent stake, but a spokesman said the corporation's share in EchoStar was now down to 6 percent. The spokesman also said the News Corporation had no direct control over EchoStar and no direct financial investment in ''adult'' films.</p>
