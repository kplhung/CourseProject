        <p>A jury has awarded $750,000 to the Metropolitan Museum of Art's former assistant banquet manager after finding that the museum's food contractor, Restaurant Associates, had fired him illegally. The jury made the award Thursday after finding that the company's dismissal of the manager, Luke Davis, was illegal on the ground that it had constituted discrimination because of his disability. Mr. Davis has Tourette's syndrome, a neurological disorder that causes involuntary motor and vocal tics. During the trial in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, Mr. Davis testified that Restaurant Associates managers had referred to him as a ''cripple'' and a ''disturbing element.'' Mr. Davis testified that he was fired after he was forced to leave work ill on a day that a manager had insulted him because of his symptoms. Larry Jones, the general counsel for Restaurant Associates, said that the company planned to appeal the verdict and that Mr. Davis had not been discriminated against.</p>
