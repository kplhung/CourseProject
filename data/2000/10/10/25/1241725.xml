        <p>Major stock market indexes were mixed yesterday.</p>
        <p>Blue chip issues rose for the fourth consecutive session, powered by a big jump in J. P. Morgan shares. But high-technology stocks slumped after a leading semiconductor manufacturer said profits might be under pressure for the next two quarters.</p>
        <p>The Dow Jones industrial average gained 121.35 points, or 1.2 percent, to 10,393.07, led by J. P. Morgan, Procter &amp; Gamble and General Electric. And the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index managed to rise 2.35 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,398.13.</p>
        <p>But the Nasdaq composite index slumped 48.90 points, or 1.4 percent, to 3,419.79, after National Semiconductor issued a profit warning.</p>
        <p>''The news from National Semiconductor was not good, and that leaned on almost all the chip companies,'' said Al Goldman, chief market strategist at A. G. Edwards Inc. in St. Louis.</p>
        <p>''When you have had your brains beaten up for seven weeks, you don't get up and dance immediately.''</p>
        <p>National Semiconductor lost one-third of its market value after it said profits might fall in coming quarters. The stock closed at $24.38, down $11.63 a share.</p>
        <p>Chip makers that shared in the suffering included Applied Materials, which fell $4, to $49.44; Teradyne, which closed at $29.25, down $1.25; and Texas Instruments, which makes semiconductors for wireless phones. Texas Instruments shed $2, to $45.50.</p>
        <p>National Semiconductor was one of the few companies that talked about disappointing earnings yesterday.</p>
        <p>Tyco International rose $2.81, to $54.31, after reporting a fiscal fourth-quarter profit that beat Wall Street estimates by 2 percent.</p>
        <p>Hershey Foods gained $1.81, to $51.56, after the chocolate candy maker beat consensus third-quarter earnings forecasts.</p>
        <p>Qwest Communications rose $2.31, to $47.69, after the long-distance telephone company reported earnings before special items that beat estimates by 56 percent.</p>
        <p>And Amazon.com provided a pleasant after-hours surprise. The online retailer reported after the market closed that sales during the period rose 79 percent, resulting in a loss that was much narrower than anticipated.</p>
        <p>In regular trading, the stock fell 44 cents, to $29.56. But in after-hours trading the stock rose as high as $32.63.</p>
        <p>''Investors are getting some confidence back,'' said Bill Allyn, head of listed trading at Jefferies &amp; Company. ''And valuations are a lot better than they were six months ago.''</p>
        <p>Among Dow components, J. P. Morgan rose $6.63 a share, to $145.13. General Electric gained $3.33, to $53.31. And Procter &amp; Gamble rose $4.06, to $73.63.</p>
        <p>But Intel and Microsoft, two of the Dow's technology stocks, moved lower. Intel closed at $42, down $1.31, while Microsoft slipped 63 cents, to $61.50.</p>
        <p>Forest-products stocks had a good day.</p>
        <p>The Philadelphia Stock Exchange Forest and Paper Products index gained 7.2 percent, after Bowater Inc. posted strong earnings.</p>
        <p>Bowater, a newsprint maker, gained $3.69, to $49.38.</p>
        <p>MarchFirst was the session's most actively traded stock. Shares of the Internet consulting company's stock dropped $6.94, to $4.88, after its third-quarter earnings fell far short of expectations.</p>

        <p>10-Year Treasury Falls</p>
        <p>By Reuters</p>
        <p>A stabilization in blue-chip stocks hurt Treasury bond prices yesterday, bucking a trend seen over the last several weeks in which investors, fleeing stocks, had flocked to the safety of government-backed debt.</p>
        <p>Traders said that a planned $10 billion sale of new two-year notes on Wednesday from the Treasury also depressed prices in that sector as dealers tried to price down current issues to make the new notes more attractive to investors.</p>
        <p>The 10-year Treasury note fell 10/32, to a price of 100 30/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.62 percent from 5.58 percent on Monday.</p>
        <p>The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 14/32, to 107 22/32. The bond's yield rose to 5.71 percent from 5.68 percent on Monday.</p>
