        <p>NBC has won this season's dubious achievement of being the first network to cancel a new series, announcing yesterday that the comedy ''Tucker'' had been dropped from its schedule after just four weeks on the air.</p>
        <p>But the ratings for ''Tucker,'' which had been dismissed by critics as a woeful imitation of the Fox hit  ''Malcolm in the Middle,'' had moved close to invisibility this week, sinking to a 3.1 national rating. (Each ratings point represents 1.02 million homes.) That will almost surely make it the lowest-rated episode of any show on one of the four big networks so far this season.</p>

        <p>NBC has won this season's dubious achievement of being the first network to cancel a new series, announcing yesterday that the comedy ''Tucker'' had been dropped from its schedule after just four weeks on the air.</p>
        <p>But the ratings for ''Tucker,'' which had been dismissed by critics as a woeful imitation of the Fox hit  ''Malcolm in the Middle,'' had moved close to invisibility this week, sinking to a 3.1 national rating. (Each ratings point represents 1.02 million homes.) That will almost surely make it the lowest-rated episode of any show on one of the four big networks so far this season.</p>
        <p>The 8 to 9 p.m. hour on Monday -- the other show is the comedy series ''Daddio'' -- has performed so weakly that NBC also shelved ''Daddio'' indefinitely yesterday and called in its ever-ready replacement, the news magazine ''Dateline NBC.''</p>
        <p>Starting next Monday, ''Dateline,'' which is already on three nights a week, will fill in from 8 to 9 p.m. for at least the next two weeks. NBC made no further commitment, probably because after two weeks the November sweeps month begins and the network may try to fill the night with special programming.</p>
        <p>''Dateline'' may be NBC's best long-term option in the time period, however, even though for the moment it will face off against another news magazine, ABC's ''20/20 Downtown.'' But ABC's schedule will change after December when ''Monday Night Football'' comes to an end.</p>
        <p>NBC executives say they expect ABC to start the night off in January with a new reality series, ''The Mole.'' That would make ''Dateline'' the only news magazine at 8. Even though NBC cut back ''Dateline'' to three weekly editions this week, its executive producer, Neal Shapiro, has been told to keep his staff at the same level and to be ready to expand to four nights a week.</p>
        <p>Garth Ancier, president of NBC Entertainment, said yesterday, ''We had to get those shows out of there because we have to give 'Deadline' some kind of lead-in.''</p>
        <p>''Deadline,'' a new NBC series about a newspaper columnist and crime fighter, got off to a good start in the 9 o'clock slot on Monday in its first week but has descended sharply ever since, though always doing better than the two comedies that preceded it.</p>
        <p>NBC's problems at 8 p.m. Monday may be compounded by the newest Fox entry at that hour, ''Boston Public,'' which posted the best overall rating performance for any new series this season in its first outing on  Monday night.</p>
        <p>Proving that the producer David E. Kelley can apparently draw in an audience on his name alone, ''Boston Public,'' while not the highest-rated new series over all, was competitively the best performer because it beat all its competition at 8 p.m. on Monday in virtually every category of viewer.</p>
        <p>Fox also got some relatively promising news from ''Ally McBeal,'' which returned to the schedule with higher ratings than it was posting at the end of last season, though not as high as those it started with last season. Mr. Kelley has introduced the actor Robert Downey Jr. to try to stir some new interest in the show. In its first week that seems to have worked, at least modestly.</p>
        <p>An executive at a competing network said yesterday, ''In terms of what we were projecting, 'Boston Public' did better than we expected but 'Ally' did a little less well than we expected.''</p>
