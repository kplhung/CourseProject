        <p>Todd Zeile looked into the Mets' dugout, pleading with Manager Bobby Valentine. There were two runners on and nobody out in the sixth inning, with the Mets trailing Game 3 of the World Series, 2-1. Zeile had failed in his first bunt attempt, and he wanted no more of that exercise.</p>
        <p>To Zeile, the call was puzzling, and not only because he had not been called on to bunt all season. Zeile is one of the rare right-handed batters who feasts on Orlando Hernandez, who limited right-handers to a .210 batting average this season. Zeile came into this game with 5 hits in 12 career at-bats off Hernandez, but he had struck out looking his first two times up last night.</p>

        <p>Todd Zeile looked into the Mets' dugout, pleading with Manager Bobby Valentine. There were two runners on and nobody out in the sixth inning, with the Mets trailing Game 3 of the World Series, 2-1. Zeile had failed in his first bunt attempt, and he wanted no more of that exercise.</p>
        <p>To Zeile, the call was puzzling, and not only because he had not been called on to bunt all season. Zeile is one of the rare right-handed batters who feasts on Orlando Hernandez, who limited right-handers to a .210 batting average this season. Zeile came into this game with 5 hits in 12 career at-bats off Hernandez, but he had struck out looking his first two times up last night.</p>
        <p>''I literally asked if they would let me swing the bat,'' Zeile said, after his two hits played a major role in the Mets' 4-2 victory. ''I did not want to bunt in that situation. I'm certainly grateful for Bobby -- he called it off. On the next pitch, I was able to get it done.''</p>
        <p>Zeile knocked Hernandez's next pitch into the left-field corner, scoring Mike Piazza with his double to tie the score, 2-2. Zeile sparked the game-winning rally two innings later, when he singled just over the glove of a diving Derek Jeter at short.</p>
        <p>Zeile scored the go-ahead run when Benny Agbayani doubled to the gap in left-center field, and the Mets added another run on a sacrifice fly by Bubba Trammell. It was Agbayani's second game-winning hit of the postseason; he also had a game-winning homer in Game 3 of the division series against the San Francisco Giants at Shea Stadium. Agbayani has hit in all 12 games this postseason.</p>
        <p>''He can just flat-out hit,'' said Mets center fielder Jay Payton. ''He hasn't done anything now that he hadn't been doing all season. He's a great hitter; he's proven it time and time again. I guess he's stepped it up a notch, but he's turned himself into one of our best hitters, if not the best.''</p>
        <p>After hitting .333 in the division series and .344 in the National League Championship Series, Agbayani is batting .364 (4 for 11) in the World Series.</p>
        <p>''He also had a pretty good postseason for us last year,'' said General Manager Steve Phillips, remembering Agbayani's .300 average in the first round last year against Arizona. ''He's had some big hits for us at big times. Rarely does he give away at-bats where he chases a bad pitch. He usually gives you a pretty good hack.''</p>
        <p>Agbayani had only three career at-bats against Hernandez coming into the game, and he praised the Yankees' right-hander, who lost for the first time in 11 postseason appearances. Before he batted in the eighth, Agbayani talked with the Mets' hitting coach, Tom Robson, who told him to look for a pitch low in the strike zone. ''I went up there thinking, 'Get the ball down,' '' Agbayani said. ''Let him throw something where I can drive it to the outfield.''</p>
        <p>The Mets were just a bit better than Hernandez, in large part because of Zeile. The numbers showed that if the Mets were going to beat Hernandez, Zeile would have to play a role; the Mets' second and third hitters, Edgardo Alfonzo and Piazza, were a combined 3 for 21 off him coming into the game.</p>
        <p>''I was punched out the first two times tonight, and I think I was a little overanxious, going after sliders off the plate when I'm usually able not to do that,'' said Zeile, who is batting .462 (6 for 13) this series.</p>
        <p>''Maybe that's the answer: in the past, I haven't chased that slider down the middle and off the plate, and I've gotten myself into counts were I could get a fastball I could hit.''</p>
        <p>To Phillips, who signed Zeile to a three-year, $18 million free-agent contract after John Olerud signed with Seattle last winter, it was not surprising to see Zeile come though in a big spot. Phillips signed him for his run production, and though Zeile's 79 runs batted in this year were his fewest in a season since 1995, Phillips considers him a clutch performer.</p>
        <p>''After we signed him, Tommy Lasorda told me, 'He's the kind of guy that, if the score is 11-3, he's not going to make it 12-3,' '' Phillips said, relating an anecdote from the former manager who observed Zeile with the Dodgers in 1997-98. ''But when it's a 4-3 game, he's a guy who's going to make it 5-3, get that big R.B.I.''</p>
        <p>For Zeile, a 12-year veteran making his first World Series appearance, no R.B.I. has ever been as big as the one that tied the score last night. There will be no more talk of the Yankees' 14-game World Series winning streak or Hernandez's postseason magic.</p>
        <p>''The good news,'' Zeile said, on a night when there was much of it for the Mets, ''is now we're able to get a couple of streaks off our backs.''</p>
