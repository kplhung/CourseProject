        <p>In a surprising twist in the embassy bombings case, a second defendant appeared yesterday in Federal District Court in Manhattan and said he wanted to plead guilty to the conspiracy charges against him. Just Friday, another defendant in the terrorism prosecution pleaded guilty after making a deal with the government.</p>
        <p>But yesterday, Judge Leonard B. Sand took the unusual step of rejecting the guilty plea that was sought by Wadih El-Hage after he said his reasons for pleading guilty did not turn on his culpability in the case.</p>
        <p>''Do I understand,'' Judge Sand asked, ''that you are offering to plead guilty because you believe that you are guilty?''</p>
        <p>''No -- some other legitimate reasons,'' replied Mr. El-Hage, 40, who has maintained his innocence. He said that he was pleading guilty because he saw no chance of winning his case and did not want to undergo the humiliation of coming to court daily, waiting in cold holding cells, and undergoing routine strip searches.</p>
        <p>The government has described Mr. El-Hage as a close associate of and former personal secretary to Osama bin Laden, the wealthy Saudi financier who has been accused of leading a terrorism conspiracy that included the August 1998 attacks on two United States embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The nearly simultaneous blasts killed more than 200 people and injured thousands.</p>
        <p>In the two years since Mr. El-Hage's arrest, his lawyers have mounted an aggressive defense of the conspiracy charges against him and were preparing for trial. He and four other co-defendants are scheduled to go to trial next January. Last Friday, a sixth defendant in the case, Ali A. Mohamed, admitted to being a top aide to Mr. bin Laden after entering into negotiations with the government and pleading guilty to terrorism conspiracy charges.</p>
        <p>But Mr. El-Hage's decision to try to plead guilty was clearly a surprise to all others involved. A federal prosecutor, Patrick J. Fitzgerald, told Judge Sand that there was no plea bargaining or agreement reached with the government. And one of Mr. El-Hage's lawyers, Sam A. Schmidt, said he had advised his client against such a move.</p>
        <p>In court, Judge Sand also seemed troubled by Mr. El-Hage's proposed plea as the defendant began to respond to the judge's questions -- an inquiry mandated by federal law whenever a defendant pleads guilty.</p>
        <p>''There is a whole ritual for pleading guilty,'' said Stephen Gillers, a legal ethics professor at New York University School of Law, ''that requires the defendant to state, on the record, the truth of the facts that establish the crime.''</p>
        <p>He added, ''If you get up before the judge, and say you are not guilty but want to plead guilty, that is a contradiction the law almost never recognizes.''</p>
        <p>The colloquy between defendant and judge at times recalled a law school seminar, touching on issues of guilt and innocence, the rationale behind a plea bargain and, as the judge suggested bluntly, the usual tactic of pleading guilty in order to obtain something beneficial in return, like a reduced sentence. In response to one of the judge's questions, Mr. El-Hage said he understood that by pleading guilty without a deal with the government, he faced life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.</p>
        <p>The problems with the plea surfaced more clearly when Judge Sand asked whether Mr. El-Hage was acting ''by reason of any fear, force, pressure, anything of that nature?''</p>
        <p>Mr. El-Hage replied, ''Well, there are reasons that are forcing me to plead guilty.''</p>
        <p>He said the restrictive jail conditions had made it impossible for him to prepare an adequate defense for trial. Like his co-defendants, Mr. El-Hage is barred from communicating with outsiders, except for his lawyers and family. He said he could not contact business associates, friends and neighbors who might assist him, but who were unwilling to confer with his lawyers.</p>
        <p>He was convinced, he said, that he would lose at trial, ''which is the same as if I am pleading guilty.''</p>
        <p>Later, after court, Mr. El-Hage's lawyers, Mr. Schmidt and Joshua L. Dratel, said their client was not being held under the normal conditions of pretrial confinement. And they cited the report of a Harvard Medical School psychiatrist who examined Mr. El-Hage last year and found that he was so mentally devastated by the conditions of his imprisonment that he might not be able to assist meaningfully in his defense.</p>
        <p>At yesterday's hearing, Judge Sand noted that in asking to plead guilty, Mr. El-Hage was not receiving anything in return.</p>
        <p>''What I gain from pleading guilty right now,'' Mr. El-Hage said, ''is that I save myself the agony and humiliation of going back and forth between the prison and the court for one whole year, every day.'' That, he said, ''would be a great benefit for me.''</p>
        <p>But Judge Sand said the jail conditions, which have been upheld on appeal, had nothing to do with whether a jury would find him guilty or acquit him.</p>
        <p>''You are saying that, although you are innocent, the cards are so stacked against you that it is not worth even the effort of trying to convince a jury that you are not guilty?'' Judge Sand asked.</p>
        <p>When Mr. El-Hage complained about the strip searches he must undergo whenever he is taken to court, the judge recalled a June 1999 incident in which Mr. El-Hage leapt out of his chair and charged toward the bench, before being subdued by a federal marshal. The judge said he would not second-guess security measures in the case.</p>
        <p>Asked for his opinion, Mr. Fitzgerald, the prosecutor, said the government was against the judge's accepting the plea.</p>
        <p>Judge Sand told Mr. El-Hage that it would be easy for the court to accept the plea, which would save taxpayer money, reduce the burden on jurors and shorten the trial. ''The only reason why I would not accept the plea,'' the judge said, ''is because we do think that we are engaged in a process of administering justice.''</p>
        <p>The judge ultimately rejected the plea request. ''I do that not out of malice or any desire to inflict pain or suffering,'' he said. ''I do that because, regardless of your view as to whether it is worth it or not, I can't equate the avoidance of the unpleasantness associated with coming to court on a daily basis with a relinquishment of any possibility, however remote you may believe it to be, of your not being found guilty.''</p>
