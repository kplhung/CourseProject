        <p>Chief of infectious diseases, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine</p>
        <p>The Web site will be a source of information. Our Web site already has resources, including books, that are frequently updated, conferences that can be played on the Web and chat rooms that answer up to 2,000 questions a year. The drawback is that the peer review system is lost. Anybody can write anything and put it up on the Web. It takes nine months for a piece to appear in a journal, but you know it's been thoroughly reviewed.</p>

        <p>DR. JOHN BARTLETT</p>
        <p>Chief of infectious diseases, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine</p>
        <p>The Web site will be a source of information. Our Web site already has resources, including books, that are frequently updated, conferences that can be played on the Web and chat rooms that answer up to 2,000 questions a year. The drawback is that the peer review system is lost. Anybody can write anything and put it up on the Web. It takes nine months for a piece to appear in a journal, but you know it's been thoroughly reviewed.</p>
        <p>The real future lies in point-of-care decision-support tools. Doctors will soon have concise information delivered to them on a hand-held device like a Palm Pilot. Symptoms and diagnosis will be entered and, in concurrence with national guidelines, a doctor can receive all the information he needs: what he needs to know about a disease, what kind of tests he should run, what kind of antibiotics are needed and in what amount and F.D.A. alerts and updates. The whole system will be much more efficient.</p>
        <p>DR. BROOK EDWARDS</p>
        <p>Editor in chief, Mayoclinic.com, and a professor of medicine at the Mayo Clinic</p>
        <p>We are no longer talking about the informed consumer; it's already happened. The Internet has become the de facto second opinion. Our challenge is going to be to identify the needs of the user and to package information in a usable way. It's not that helpful to do a search on breast cancer and get thousands of responses. Future Web interaction will go beyond just providing information and become more personalized to a patient's specific needs. The Internet will not replace the doctor-patient relationship but enhance it. The average doctor visit is now down to about seven minutes, and a well-informed consumer can make the most of that time.</p>
        <p>DR. JEFFREY P. KOPLAN</p>
        <p>Director, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</p>
        <p>It was inconceivable five years ago, the amount of information we are now sharing with a worldwide audience. People have said that they visit the C.D.C. site every day from places like Indian villages. What we are working on now is getting all local health offices online. Even in the year 2000, some disease reporting is done by hand or telephone and goes at a snail's pace. We hope to get disease reporting online, almost in real time, so that we can better recognize outbreaks.</p>
        <p>DAVID KIRSHENBAUM</p>
        <p>General manager, e-health, Aetna U.S. Healthcare</p>
        <p>The ideal goal of health care and the Web is putting someone in a position to act. Consumers will get tired of going to the Internet for a glut of information that does not really enable them to take action. The key will be integrating all the information out there so it will be useful to consumers.</p>
        <p>SANDY BERGER</p>
        <p>Host of the AARP Computers and Technology Web site</p>
        <p>Health care is one of the leading motivators in getting older people on the Internet. Years ago, people didn't think as much about their health; they went to the doctor, the doctor made his proclamation, and that was that. Now people are talking about their health and researching things, increasingly online.</p>
        <p>One of the major concerns with older people doing research on the Net is that they are able to be discerning users. Many do not realize that all the information on the Web is not completely accurate. They need to ask themselves who wrote it, and is someone trying to sell me something here? It always comes down to education, though. We should make sure that older people are more comfortable with the technology and develop more user-friendly computers.</p>
