        <p>A Manhattan jury yesterday found a plastic surgeon guilty of killing his wife in 1985 and disposing of her body by dropping it from an airplane into the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
        <p>The surgeon, Dr. Robert Bierenbaum, 45, remained expressionless as the jury forewoman stood and read from the verdict sheet on the sole count of second-degree murder: ''Guilty.''</p>
        <p>At that declaration, the victim's older sister, Alayne Katz, a lawyer who has waged a 15-year crusade to bring Dr. Bierenbaum to trial, yelled ''Yes,'' then put her head in the lap of her younger brother, Steven, and sobbed. The body of their sister, Gail Katz-Bierenbaum, 29, who vanished on July 7, 1985, has never been found.</p>
        <p>''The jury was not divided,'' said Jason Hauf, 32, who served on the panel of seven men and five women.  ''People were pretty much in agreement. All the facts, in totality, kind of drew you in the direction'' of guilt, he said by telephone after the verdict was announced.</p>
        <p>Dr. Bierenbaum faces 25 years to life in prison and is to be sentenced on Nov. 20.</p>
        <p>Though Dr. Bierenbaum was a suspect in Ms. Katz-Bierenbaum's disappearance for more than a decade, it seemed to some that he had committed the perfect crime. The wife he had fought with and threatened to kill had disappeared without a trace. He moved on, setting up successful plastic surgery practices in Las Vegas and then in Minot, N.D.</p>
        <p>But as he dated, remarried and had a child, an investigator with the Manhattan district attorney's office re-examined the cold case. A search of local airfield records produced evidence that on July 7, Dr. Bierenbaum had flown a Cessna 172N alone over the Atlantic Ocean, but had failed to tell detectives this. Investigators theorized that, after strangling his wife in the couple's apartment, he loaded her body into a duffel bag and dumped it from the plane.  Evidence of his flight and contradictory statements he had made to several girlfriends were enough to bring him to trial.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors were then faced with the task of presenting a murder case with only flight logs, a videotaped reconstruction and recollections of an abusive marriage from friends and family as evidence. One witness testified that Ms. Katz-Bierenbaum had said that Dr. Bierenbaum had told her he would not make a mistake like Claus von Bulow did and leave her body behind.</p>
        <p>This was the second murder case without a victim's body that the office of the Manhattan district attorney, Robert M. Morgenthau, has prosecuted successfully this year. In May, a mother-and-son con artist team, Sante and Kenneth Kimes, were convicted of killing an Upper East Side socialite and disposing of her body. In that case, Ms. Kimes's journals outlined the plot against the victim.</p>
        <p>In this case, the evidence was entirely circumstantial, and some of the most potentially damaging evidence against Dr. Bierenbaum was excluded from the trial. Shortly before Ms. Katz-Bierenbaum's disappearance, Dr. Bierenbaum consulted three psychiatrists about his violent treatment of her; he had choked her to the point of unconsciousness once, and even tried to drown her cat.</p>
        <p>All three psychiatrists warned Ms. Katz-Bierenbaum that she was in danger. But the constraints of medical confidentiality led Judge Leslie Crocker Snyder to exclude the psychiatrists' testimony from the jury.  Alayne Katz and several other witnesses testified that her sister had shown them a letter written by one of the psychiatrists urging her to leave the marriage. Ms. Katz-Bierenbaum had planned to use the letter in a divorce proceeding.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors were left to present a tapestry of recollections that pointed to Dr. Bierenbaum's motive for murder and his subsequent efforts to cover his tracks: he was violent and angry about his wife's desire to leave the marriage; he did little to look for her and appeared relieved after she vanished; he sent a rug in their apartment out for cleaning and denied the police access to a full forensic search.</p>
        <p>Another juror, Henry Lumpkin, said yesterday that the absence of a body was ''a holdback'' for the jury and that the verdict ''took a lot of heads coming together.''</p>
        <p>In the courtroom, after the verdict was read, Dr. Bierenbaum hunched over the defense table, consulting with his lawyer, Scott Greenfield.</p>
        <p>His current wife, Dr. Janet Chollet, who sat through every day of the trial, wished her husband luck and slipped from the courtroom just before the verdict was read. The couple have a 2-year-old daughter and live in Minot.</p>
        <p>''She chose not to be present; it was too emotional for her,'' said another of Dr. Bierenbaum's lawyers, David Lewis. He added that Dr. Bierenbaum was ''extremely disappointed'' with the verdict and planned to appeal. ''There are significant issues, evidentiary issues, things that were admitted,'' he said, without elaborating.</p>
        <p>In the hallway outside the courtroom, an alternate juror who refused to give her name and did not participate in the deliberations sobbed and embraced Alayne Katz.</p>
        <p>''I have a sister who I'm close to, and I can't imagine what she's going through,'' she said, referring to Ms. Katz, 42.</p>
        <p>Standing nearby, Steven Katz, 30, also wept in the hallway and said, ''I think of my mother,'' who died in 1990. ''She never had a happy day'' since her daughter disappeared.</p>
