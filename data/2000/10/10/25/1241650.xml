        <p>ON March 6, the first artificially inseminated African elephant was born in the Indianapolis Zoo. The birth was broadcast live on the Web, as has been its babyhood.</p>
        <p>Such live continuous images of animals are fast becoming a staple of zoo Web sites, as more powerful computers, broadband and slicker marketing take hold.</p>
        <p>The San Diego Zoo and Zoo Atlanta show their pandas chewing bamboo and pursuing other panda pursuits -- live. The Central Park Zoo shows penguins continuously, but aficionados have learned to tune in at 10:30 a.m. and 2:30 p.m. for feedings. The London Aquarium shows sharks.</p>
        <p>And that is only the beginning. The Bronx Zoo will soon focus a camera on gorillas, and the Phoenix Zoo plans to showcase giraffes, waterbucks, ostriches, vultures and gazelles.</p>
        <p>Beyond that, EarthCam.com, a company that began showing live images of Times Square in 1996 on the Internet and has broadened its mission to zoos and museums, has an idea that could threaten the very concept of a traditional zoo: it plans to place a camera on the west side of San Juan Island in Washington State to show killer whales as they pass through Haro Strait.</p>
        <p>The question thus arises: why go to the zoo or aquarium if the zoo can come to you?</p>
        <p>The answer, zookeepers say, is that the Internet is making zoos ever more compelling, current and able to finance their larger conservation mission by blending entertainment, education and commerce. Richard Lattis, the president of the American Zoo and Aquarium Association, which includes 185 of the nation's major zoos as members, said that the Internet has become important in everything from recruiting zookeepers to sharing scientific and conservation information to recruiting thousands of new members to selling stuffed animals.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lattis, who as a senior vice president and general director of the Wildlife Conservation Society operates New York City's zoos and aquarium, said zoo Web sites amplify a zoo's reach, drawing more people. In essence, he says people like to actually smell the animals. ''There's nothing like seeing a tiger up close and in person,'' he said. ''The ambience of a zoo is more than an image on a wall.''</p>
        <p>The Bronx Zoo faced the question directly when its $43 million Congo Gorilla Forest opened last year. Should the zoo offer a virtual tour of the new attraction? The decision was a nervous yes. Patrick Milliman, the Wildlife Conservation Society's director of communications and marketing, said, ''At first we thought, 'Maybe we don't want to give away the tour,' '' which cost $3 in addition to the $7.75 admission to the general grounds.</p>
        <p>But ultimately, zoo officials became convinced that the Internet, as well as advertising, sparked record attendance. Nearly 2.5 million people have come to the Bronx Zoo since the expansive and intricate recreation of an African rain forest habitat opened. Even more to the point, the society's larger mission of conservation is being furthered. Part of the reason is that at the end of the tour, each visitor contributes $1 of his Congo admission fee to the African conservation project of his choice.</p>
        <p>''By advertising the baby gorillas, you get people to come to visit the zoo,'' Mr. Milliman said. ''By coming to the zoo, they realize that the Congo is an area that should be preserved.''</p>
        <p>Moreover, shrewd partnerships with corporations help strike a sharper Internet presence. The Wildlife Conservation Society, for example, has bonded with Jaguar automobiles to save jaguars and uses video clips and reports from the field as part of its site's educational thrust.</p>
        <p>''Once you put a co-branded Web site out there, it's very public,'' said Marjorie Federici, the society's manager of online services. ''You're not just talking to a New York market, you're talking to the world.''</p>
        <p>The San Diego Zoo and Wild Animal Park also strikes a particularly activist image, as it uses vivid images to link conservation and commerce on its Web site. On the ''cybersafari,'' in addition to pandas, are videos of the new Condor Ridge exhibition, showing condor chicks hatching. There are pages and pages of information about pandas.</p>
        <p>There is also information about zoo programs like the Park at Dark, allowing members to visit at night. The ''Your World'' section provides regular updates of global conservation initiatives. Corporate partners get due credit, including Pacific Bell for sponsoring a Giant Panda Research Station, and Starbucks for marketing a limited edition San Diego Zoo tumbler.</p>
        <p>Indeed, commercial possibilities abound on zoo Web sites. The Brookfield Zoo in Chicago suggests black-tie dinners at its Habitat Africa and catered barbecues in the zoo's grove. Zoological trips are offered, including ''Kenya Under Canvas'' for $3,165. A combined zoo and hotel package is available, with nine participating hotels.</p>
        <p>The St. Louis Zoo's Web site is also ambitious. ''We're going buggy'' is the headline for the opening of its new insectarium. A zoo-hotel deal is offered at the 14 St. Louis-area Drury Inns. St. Louis also sells many plush toys, a standard at zoo sites. Among the merchandise: a 24-inch squirrel monkey, a 19-inch tree frog and three sizes of the raja elephant plush toy.</p>
        <p>But there is also a seriousness of purpose, even with all the trinkets. The Monterey Bay Aquarium, which peddles plenty of penguin toys, nonetheless provides a look at actual continuing pictures from a deep-sea exploration vessel. It also gives a long explanation of which seafood an environmentally concerned diner might deign to eat.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lattis, of the Wildlife Conservation Society, suggests other intriguing missions, saying field veterinarians are able to use the Web to communicate from such locations as Tibet and Argentina to virtually all of the world's important zoos. In emergencies, this can be done in real time. Similarly, a major conservation conference held at the Bronx Zoo linked scientists in contemporaneous discussion. ''Actual activities between zoos and aquariums continue on a 24-hour basis just because of the Internet,'' Mr. Lattis said.</p>
        <p>Where all this is leading is unclear. On the most basic level, people just like looking at animals. With technology surging in popularity and plunging in cost, more and more people, said Brian Cury, the chief executive officer and founder of EarthCam, do things like display a live image of their goldfish bowl on the Internet. Others put cameras on their dogs' and cats' bowls to check when they're empty.</p>
        <p>EACH month, according to Mr. Cury, there are 150 million page views of continuous cameras. He said millions of these are of pictures emanating from zoos, and he has received many approving e-mails. ''People just love the fact they can experience those moments through the Internet.''</p>
        <p>So far, EarthCam has provided cameras to zoos and museums without charge. The strategy is to make money through advertising on the sites. Several of the zoo sites Mr. Cury has created have a large blinking banner offering $200 in free gasoline as a come-on to join Discounts USA, which offers lower costs on things from groceries to appliances to travel. There is also a deal to buy five jazz CD's for $4.95.</p>
        <p>From the perspective of the zoos themselves, the Web is best seen as a useful tool. At Woodland Park Zoo in Seattle, a new Web site, which features streaming videos of Komodo dragons, has been used to recruit 10 to 50 new memberships a day since it was put up two months ago. Renewals are also coming in by means of mailings with a special code that members then send in by e-mail.</p>
        <p>Adoptions of zoo animals are encouraged, but you can't keep the beasts. ''You're not really adopting an animal, but a species of animal,'' cautioned Ric Brewer, a publishing and Web site manager who worked on the Web site of the Woodland Park Zoo in Seattle.</p>
        <p>Corporate sponsorship is, of course, available, as well as a trip to Kenya. And so is ''Zoo Doo,'' a blend of animal manures mixed with straw bedding, grass, leaves and wood chips.</p>
        <p>''Elephants, of course, are the most generous,'' the Web site reports.</p>
