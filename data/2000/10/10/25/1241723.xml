        <p>As the Gore campaign seized on the news that a grand jury was investigating whether a subsidiary of a company that Dick Cheney led until this summer billed the federal government too much, the Cheney campaign countered today with the suggestion that the investigation had been politically motivated.</p>
        <p>The investigation centers on whether Brown &amp; Root, a subsidiary of the Halliburton Company, the oil and energy services company that Mr. Cheney led, overbilled the government for its work decommissioning Fort Ord in California.</p>
        <p>The Gore campaign called on Mr. Cheney to provide a full reckoning of the matter. ''He owes the American people an honest answer whether, under his watch, his company defrauded taxpayers,'' said Kym Spell, a Gore campaign spokeswoman.</p>
        <p>The Cheney campaign noted that Halliburton had denied any wrongdoing and suggested that the investigation was politically motivated.</p>
        <p>The investigation stemmed from a suit filed in 1997 by a former Brown &amp; Root employee who asserted that the company had overbilled the government by $6 million and used shoddy materials. Government prosecutors originally declined to join in the case, but a federal grand jury subpoenaed witnesses to begin testifying next month, The Los Angeles Times reported today.</p>
        <p>If the former employee proves his case, the paper said, he will get a percentage of the damages, under the Federal False Claims Act of 1986.</p>
