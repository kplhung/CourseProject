        <p>Fogdog, a high-profile online sporting goods retailer, agreed yesterday to be acquired by Global Sports, which provides e-commerce services to retailers, for $38.4 million in Global Sports stock, the companies said.</p>
        <p>The deal comes on the heels of the sale of CDNow to Bertelsmann in July and the closing of Value America in August, two other stand-alone publicly held consumer e-commerce companies.</p>
        <p>Under the terms of the deal, Fogdog shareholders would receive 0.135 share of Global Sports common stock for each of their shares in Fogdog. Shares of Fogdog closed up 13 cents to 88 cents yesterday. Shares of Global Sports closed up 34 cents to $8.09. The companies said they expected the deal to close early next year.</p>
        <p>Michael Rubin, chief executive of Global Sports, said the company would lay off most of the roughly 150 Fogdog employees, retaining only Fogdog's 25-member technology team, which developed a Web site that repeatedly won kudos from industry analysts. Global Sports, based in King of Prussia, Pa., sells about 60,000 sporting goods products on behalf of other retailers. It will keep the Fogdog Web site running but will eliminate most of Fogdog's marketing programs.</p>
        <p>For executives of Fogdog, a Redwood City, Calif., company that went public in early December last year and quickly gained a market value of nearly $800 million, the deal brings to an end a two-year rise and fall that mirrored the fortunes of scores of other e-commerce retailers. Despite an aggressive marketing campaign and the fact that the site was among the only Web stores authorized to sell brands like Nike and Callaway, the company failed to generate significant sales. After the markets closed yesterday, Fogdog released third-quarter results, showing revenue of $5.9 million, and a net loss of $8.5 million, or 23 cents a share.</p>
        <p>''When you look at long-term value, it's the right proposition,'' said Tim Harrington, chief executive of Fogdog. ''It is now a layup in terms who the dominant player is in this category. It's exciting.''</p>
        <p>For Global Sports, meanwhile, the deal brings several benefits. First, because Fogdog had about $43 million in cash, as of Sept. 30 the sale will further build the coffers of Global Sports, which were bolstered two weeks ago by a $41 million joint investment from Comcast and QVC.</p>
        <p>Global Sports operates the e-commerce operations for Athlete's Foot and the Sports Authority, among others, and has signed agreements to run the online sporting goods operations of Toysrus.com, iQVC and Kmart.</p>
        <p>Global Sports executives also said Fogdog's technology team would help improve the company's existing technology, and analysts said it would help the company add new partners more quickly and perhaps expand into other product categories.</p>
        <p>''Fogdog shareholders get a chance to get some appreciation via a stock with more open-ended opportunities than they had,'' said Lauren Cooks Levitan, an analyst with Robertson Stephens, which advised Global Sports in the transaction. ''Global Sports gets to eliminate a competitive threat and they gets lots of cash so they can move on to other categories.''</p>
