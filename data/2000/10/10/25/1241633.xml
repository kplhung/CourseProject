        <p>NORM WESTON makes his living taking fishermen through South Florida mangrove swamps to pursue big fish in shallow waters, fish that only the most experienced anglers can catch.</p>
        <p>Having tourists in his flat-bottom boat pretty much rules out ''exciting fishing,'' Mr. Weston said. But there are those for whom his trips are heaven. And one of the purposes Mr. Weston had in mind when he designed his Web site, www.fishinflat.com, is to help the two groups sort themselves out before they sign up.</p>
        <p>''Tourists are tough to fish,'' he explained. ''If I have tourists, I can get within 40 to 50 feet of these fish, but they usually can't cast well enough to put the bait in front of them.''</p>
        <p>As planning for winter vacations intensifies, Web users are logging on in search of information more complicated than how to find the cheapest fare or Caribbean cruise. Travel niche sites are growing, particularly those that cater to tourists in search of a so-called adventure travel -- trips built around scuba diving, surfing, fishing, skiing, rock-climbing, kayak</p>
        <p>ing and other exotic activities.</p>
        <p>Behind that trend is a profitable overlap. Travel purveyors from Mr. Weston to big adventure sites like Gorp.com and iExplore.com that offer thousands of trips have discovered that the people most likely to go on such trips are also the most Web savvy. A result is a profusion of specialized sites that not only allow for entertaining browsing but help trip providers and trip consumers to be more sure that their interests are matching up.</p>
        <p>Mr. Weston thinks his site has helped with that. ''From my perspective as a guide, I'm looking to attract the top-shelf guy who can pick up a spinning rod, pick up a fly rod in one of 10 or 12 weights and just do whatever he wants to do with it,'' he said. ''About 50 percent of my business is at that level now, and I'm thinking that maybe the Web site has something to do with it.''</p>
        <p>Many of the bigger sites also provide search and booking functions, destination descriptions and sporting goods and services for sale.</p>
        <p>Technically, adventure-travel sites are becoming quite sophisticated, with many offering streaming video, click-and-drag 360-degree images and other features designed to appeal to the Web -- and perhaps the real -- surfer. Another advantage offered by these sites is community. There are many interactive features, including chat rooms where surfers, for example, can share information about where, when and how to catch the best waves anywhere.</p>
        <p>Novices can get in on the act, too, using the sites as an introduction to a sport that intrigues them. ''Over the last few years, people have actually started going to Web sites and living adventures kind of vicariously,'' said Christopher Elliot, an online travel writer and avid scuba diver in Annapolis, Md. ''The best adventure-travel Web sites are themselves becoming destinations.''</p>
        <p>One such site is www.padi.com, a scuba diving site operated by the Professional Association of Diving Instructors, based in Rancho San Margarita, Calif. Padi.com is sponsored by diving centers and resorts, tour operators, trainers and others in the leisure-diving industry. Like other Web sites devoted to specialized adventure-travel services, it features striking visuals and detailed information and booking services. It also has diving news, schedules of events, reader evaluations, archives, merchandise sales, information on environmental issues and projects, and links to training clinics.</p>
        <p>A regular browser at the site, Mr. Elliot clicked on the training clinics link and ended up becoming certified as a diving instructor. The reason, he said, was not because he was looking for a new job: ''I did it merely because they made it so compelling online.''</p>
        <p>Hyperambitious adventurers who want multiple sports and destinations are the focus of AirTreks.com, a site run by High Adventure Travel Inc., an Internet company in San Francisco. The president and founder, James Gray Pillar, started the business in college in the mid-80's as a small online service specializing in the Himalayan backpacking treks that he himself loved to take. One link on the site features a virtual tour of the Mount Everest base camp.</p>
        <p>''Over the years, my clients began saying, 'Hey, I want to go on your trip to the Everest base camp, but I also need to go to Sydney and want to go to Nairobi, too,' '' he said.</p>
        <p>Such multiple-destination journeys, sometimes including elements of business and pleasure on several continents, were dauntingly difficult and expensive to arrange before the Internet, Mr. Pillar said. ''Then, when the Internet came along, we said, 'Why not build software that facilitates this type of demand for complex international air fares and destinations, and makes it as affordable in many cases as a single destination?' ''</p>
        <p>AirTreks designs technology that searches worldwide air fares and devises the best price for multiple destinations, he said.</p>
        <p>AirTreks also developed a tool called trip journal. Mr. Pillar said: ''It allows our customers, as they travel around the world, to drop into an Internet cafe anywhere and file a virtual postcard. They post their own photos and write their impressions of places as they move around the world. There's a map with a line that shows their journey.''</p>
        <p>Michael Santella, traveling in China wrote, ''The food here was better than Bejing, but I'm getting tired of steamed buns.'' Staying at a beach-side shack for $9 a day, Chris Kerber, who was traveling in Cape Town, South Africa, wrote, ''The decor of this place is anything that is washed out of the Indian Ocean.''</p>
        <p>Like other sites, AirTreks links to hundreds of exotic adventure-travel trips. These include a 23-day ''Hike the John Muir Trail'' trek by foot and on mules from Yosemite National Park to the summit of 14,495-foot Mount Whitney in California for $3,245, and an eight-day fishing trip in Belize for $2,416</p>
        <p>Those who want a more down-home vacation can always visit the Web sites of smaller operators like Mr. Weston, the ''Fishin' Magician,'' who describes himself as a ''world-class fisherman who has wet a line in every corner of this hemisphere.'' Try what the Web site promises is ''some of the best back country fishing'' in southwest Florida.</p>
        <p>Just don't tell him you're a tourist.</p>
