        <p>Of the many goals of the managed care revolution, few had as much resonance as the push to get people out of the nation's emergency rooms.</p>
        <p>With health maintenance organizations, everyone was supposed to have a primary care doctor who would manage routine aches and pains. Preventive care would stave off emergencies like acute asthma attacks, and better use of family doctors would help make emergency room business dwindle.</p>
        <p>It has not worked that way. Visits to emergency rooms grew about 3 percent a year from 1997 to 1999 and have risen 6 to 8 percent in the last year, a figure that was expected to continue, said an emergency doctors' group.</p>
        <p>The reasons are similar to those behind other problems in health care: the lack of access to primary care doctors among the poorest Americans and a large number of Americans who are without insurance, often because of higher premiums. In addition, there are those who simply find the emergency room more convenient.</p>
        <p>In New York City, three out of four visits to an emergency room are for nonemergencies, according to a new study by the Commonwealth Fund, a private philanthropic organization.</p>
        <p>The promises of primary care have been dashed in large part, health care experts said, because insurance reimbursements for primary care doctors are so low that too few are willing to be in the field or to extend themselves to late hours or weekends when emergency care is required.</p>
        <p>''The situation is grave,'' said Dr. Michael Gerardi, a spokesman for the emergency doctors' group, American College of Emergency Physicians. ''We are a symptom of the disease that is the health care system.''</p>
        <p>In many areas of the country, especially in cities with large numbers of uninsured, emergency rooms are being crushed under the increased volume and patient care is often compromised, doctors said.</p>
        <p>''We are not adapting very well,'' said Dr. Daniel Higgins, the medical director of emergency service at St. Francis Medical Center in Lynwood, Calif., where 27 percent of the patients are uninsured and emergency room visits have risen 13 percent in five years.</p>
        <p>But in regions where hospitals still compete for business, like New York City, and in areas with large numbers of insured residents, emergency rooms are learning to accept and even welcome the increased patient load. Hospitals are making emergency rooms feel like a private doctor's office where waits are short, coffee is pouring and the first question a patient hears is about their condition rather than their payment method.</p>
        <p>''Five years ago there was all this talk about inappropriate uses of the E.R.,'' said Dr. Dan Wiener, chairman of emergency medicine at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan. ''All we were focused on was how to get them out. Now we are looking at how to give these patients better service.''</p>
        <p>The emergency department is economically complicated. It is the entree for large numbers of patients for most hospitals -- about 52 percent on average in New York and as many as 80 percent in some hospitals. In addition, a hospital routinely earns more from an emergency room visit than from one to a clinic.</p>
        <p>But doctors and hospital executives said that insurance companies have gradually lowered payments for visits to emergency rooms, often resorting to what is known in H.M.O. argot as ''downcoding,'' or paying for the diagnosis -- say, indigestion -- rather than the medical tests to reach that conclusion -- say, tests for a heart attack.</p>
        <p>A patients' bill of rights, which is lingering in Congress, would make this practice illegal; insurance company executives insisted that it was more often the result of poor billing practices by hospitals than anything sinister on their part.</p>
        <p>Uninsured patients have little choice but to get even the most routine care in emergency rooms, which by law must treat every patient who shows up. The number of uninsured Americans rose by an average of more than a million a year from 1987 to 1998 until it declined last year, according to Census Bureau figures.</p>
        <p>''A good one-third of our population is uninsured so we would not expect any change in utilization with that group,'' said Virginia Hastings, the director of the Los Angeles County Emergency Medical Services Agency.</p>
        <p>Danyelle Lee was one such person. The other day, she took her 2-year-old son, Cartier, to St. Luke's in Manhattan because he had diarrhea. She was so accustomed to getting care that way that she has almost stopped thinking about it, she said.</p>
        <p>''I would like him to see just one person,'' Ms. Lee said, ''but they are friendly and nice here, so for now it's cool.''</p>
        <p>In the presidential campaign, Vice President Al Gore has hammered at Gov. George W. Bush's problems with the uninsured in Texas. In the second debate, Mr. Bush said: ''We've spent $4.7 billion a year in the state of Texas for uninsured people. And they get health care. Now, it's not the most efficient way to get people health care,'' likely an allusion to the emergency rooms.</p>
        <p>As it is, many primary care clinics are having trouble staying afloat and new clinics are not opening as quickly as hoped. The costs of running the clinics have started to exceed revenues since government funding has been reduced, managed care has become dominant and many patients have moved off Medicaid as a result of welfare reform. Doctors routinely complain that they are reimbursed in the area of, say, $12 for a pediatric visit.</p>
        <p>Many hospitals that run their own clinics do so at a loss.</p>
        <p>''The reimbursement in primary care is pathetic,'' said Jeff Spartz, the chief executive officer of Hennepin County Medical Center, a public hospital in Minneapolis. ''It really frustrates us because we would like to be aggressive about prevention and early intervention, but the financing doesn't work.''</p>
        <p>As such, there remains a lack of access to doctors in some of the poorest urban and most rural areas.</p>
        <p>In New York, the Commonwealth Fund found that the greatest number of people using the emergency room for primary care tended not to be those with the worst insurance, but those who lived in the poorest neighborhoods, where there were few doctors and more language and cultural barriers.</p>
        <p>One of the study's authors, John Billings, said patients were frustrated with long waits and inaccessible doctors.</p>
        <p>''Patients are not happy with the primary care delivery system,'' said Mr. Billings, director of the Center for Health and Public Service Research at New York University. ''The hours are no good, waits are too long, and the people are rude. We have designed a health care delivery system more or less for the convenience of the system not the patients.''</p>
        <p>Often, even people who have doctors prefer to use the emergency room.</p>
        <p>''I have done it myself,'' said Ms. Hastings in Los Angeles. ''It is easier than talking to two or three nurses on the phone who then decide whether you get to talk to a doctor or not. You know the E.R. is there, that the doctor is there. I think in health care, it is the one thing the public knows they can count on.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Charles M. Cutler, the chief medical officer for the American Association of Health Plans, a trade group representing managed care companies, said that claims of poor reimbursement were overstated and doctors were paid for the services they provided, not at a flat per-patient fee.</p>
        <p>''So I don't buy the argument that there is no financial incentive,'' Dr. Cutler said.</p>
        <p>Some hospitals are actually trying to capitalize on the increase in emergency room visits.</p>
        <p>When St. Luke's in Manhattan saw that it was losing emergency room patients to other hospitals, it decided to do something. The hospital found that more than 7 percent of patients were walking out because they had to wait too long. So several steps in the admission process were streamlined to cut the wait.</p>
        <p>The hours of a clinic within the emergency room were extended to speed care to nonurgent patients. Patients also go almost immediately to a bed, and an administrator will come to them to get insurance information, rather than have that person be the first stop.</p>
        <p>Patients are now covered by a team of doctors and nurses rather than by a system of catch as catch can. The wait to see a doctor at St. Luke's has been reduced to 22 minutes from an hour and 15 minutes, while patient volume has risen 10.3 percent. If there is no X-ray technician, one is called from the main hospital.</p>
        <p>''In this city, you have to be out there as being the best at something,'' said Claudia Caine, senior vice president of operations for St. Luke's. ''We decided this is ours.''</p>
        <p>Many hospitals are actually marketing their emergency departments. At Oakwood Hospital and Medical Center in Dearborn, Mich., patients are given free movie passes if they have to wait more than 30 minutes, even as volume has increased. At Sinai Hospital of Baltimore, patients are assigned to advocates who help them cope with nonmedical problems, like finding family members or even someone to walk the dog.</p>
        <p>Faster service to nonemergencies has also become a priority.</p>
        <p>''A very major trend right now is to segregate those patients who have urgent illnesses,'' said Dr. Michael Carius, vice president of the American College of Emergency Physicians.</p>
        <p>The Hennepin County Medical Center has gone in another direction, using a $900,000 federal grant to help keep nonurgent patients from having to rely on the emergency room, which, unlike the suburban counterparts, does not want more patients. The center offered a nurse triage line, and had workers doing outreach to help people get insurance and into primary care clinics.</p>
        <p>''We are trying to work with the neighborhood clinics,'' said Mr. Spartz, the chief executive. ''They are often not recognized as part of the safety net and if they go out of business it is a big problem for us.''</p>
