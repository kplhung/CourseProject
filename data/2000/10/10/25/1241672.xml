        <p>Jose Saramago, the Portuguese writer praised by the Swedish Academy for ''parables sustained by imagination, compassion and irony'' when he won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1998, will deliver his first New York reading since he became a laureate, at 8 tonight at the 92nd Street Y. Mr. Saramago will read from his new novel, ''All the Names'' (Harcourt), about Senhor Jose, a downtrodden clerk in the Central Registry of Lisbon. Mr. Saramago will read selections in Portuguese. The American writer Edmund White is to read the English translations. A book signing will follow.</p>

        <p>NEWS</p>
        <p>Author of Destinies</p>
        <p>Jose Saramago, the Portuguese writer praised by the Swedish Academy for ''parables sustained by imagination, compassion and irony'' when he won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1998, will deliver his first New York reading since he became a laureate, at 8 tonight at the 92nd Street Y. Mr. Saramago will read from his new novel, ''All the Names'' (Harcourt), about Senhor Jose, a downtrodden clerk in the Central Registry of Lisbon. Mr. Saramago will read selections in Portuguese. The American writer Edmund White is to read the English translations. A book signing will follow.</p>
        <p>Uncommon Beethoven</p>
        <p>Beethoven (1770-1827) wrote only one oratorio, ''Christus am Olberge'' (''Christ on the Mount of Olives''). That work is one of two Beethoven rarities for vocal soloists, chorus and orchestra to be heard when Leon Botstein leads the American Symphony Orchestra at 8 p.m. on Saturday at Alice Tully Hall. The second half of the concert, titled ''The Spiritual Beethoven,'' will be devoted to his Mass in C. Both pieces were written not long after the onset of the affliction that cost Beethoven his hearing and during the time he wrote his fifth and sixth symphonies. The performance will be preceded by a chamber recital at 2:30 p.m. titled ''The Poetic Beethoven.'' Saturday's performances bring to an end to ''Beethoven and His World,'' the 11th annual Bard Music Festival, which began in August at Bard College.</p>
        <p>Past Times</p>
        <p>With the vocalist Bobby Short and the soprano Priscilla Baskerville as its guest artists, the Carnegie Hall Jazz Band will salute the Harlem Renaissance when it opens its 2000-2001 season at 8 p.m. tomorrow at Carnegie Hall. Led by its music director, the trumpeter Jon Faddis, the band will feature music associated with the explosion of literary and artistic creativity in Harlem from the aftermath of World War I to the mid-1930's.</p>
        <p>'New Sounds'</p>
        <p>From the interior of a grand piano emerges the sound of harps, mandolins and orchestral strings. Moving around the instrument in choreographed patterns, the players draw nylon filaments, rosinated sticks and an array of other devices called exciters across the strings to evoke composed music. This innovative instrumentation is in prospect at 6:30 tonight when Stephen Scott and the Bowed Piano Ensemble perform in the World Financial Center Winter Garden as part of the ''New Sounds'' series with John Schaefer of WNYC-FM as host.</p>
