        <p>WHEN Nancy Petralia wants to rev up the sales agents at Verizon Communications, she doesn't dangle a trip to Aruba. She just goes to the corporate account at Flooz.com and sends her team online gift currencies.</p>
        <p>''This offered a wide selection,'' said Ms. Petralia, the manager of channel development in Philadelphia for Verizon, which was recently formed by the merger of Bell Atlantic and GTE. ''And it's very convenient.''</p>
        <p>Scott Plantowsky clicks on the luxury site Ashford.com when his company is in the market for gifts. ''Every month, we buy about a dozen Tag Heuer watches as prizes for our sales staff,'' said Mr. Plantowsky, the vice president and chief financial officer of BindView, a network-management software company in Houston. ''And we've just ordered about a dozen gold presidential Rolex watches for salespeople who've reached certain revenue goals.''</p>
        <p>While online gift shopping has been a boon to individuals, it's becoming a rapidly growing market for corporate business. After all, companies buy gifts year-round -- for their employees, clients, customers and partners -- a fact that has caught the attention of many e-tailers.</p>
        <p>''Increasingly, online merchants are turning toward the corporation as a means of customer acquisition,'' said Mike May, a senior analyst at Jupiter Research, an Internet research company in New York.</p>
        <p>Mr. May added, ''My expectation is that those who have positioned themselves as gift merchants are going to do well with the corporate audience.''</p>
        <p>Put simply, business is where the money is. ''When an individual buys for two people on her Christmas list, that's great, but when a client services manager buys for 150, that's even better,'' Mr. May said. ''With corporations there is more discretionary spending and less price sensitivity.''</p>
        <p>According to a 1997 study by the Incentive Federation, a nonprofit trade group in Westfield, N.J., corporations spent $22.8 billion on consumer and trade incentives, a category that includes corporate gifts. Still, the online market is small -- a 1999 survey found that 11 percent of companies use the Net for gift-giving while 71 percent buy directly from a manufacturer. Jupiter projects, however, that $200 million will be spent for online specialty gifts this year and the number will increase to more than $1 billion by 2003.</p>
        <p>''After our ad campaign last year, corporate clients started calling, and we realized that Flooz was not just a solution for gift-giving for consumers but a fantastic solution for corporations,'' said Robert Levitan, the chief executive of Flooz.com, which provides online ''currency'' that can be used at more than 75 retailers. To address the demand, Flooz started a site called Flooz for Business, at www.flooz.com/business. ''Now over 60 percent of our business is corporate in terms of gross sales, and we think it will grow to around 70 percent,'' Mr. Levitan said.</p>
        <p>One of the first corporate clients to call was Ms. Petralia of Verizon. ''I was looking for something that would be a different kind of incentive for our sales agents, so I decided to use Flooz,'' she said. ''The agents can earn Flooz dollars as a special incentive when they sell certain products. It's very easy -- I can e-mail 50 people $100 worth of Flooz with one click.''</p>
        <p>Other gift-related sites are also addressing corporate business. Ashford.com, which has 11 high-end product categories, has a site called Cgashford.com. Sites like Giftcertificates.com and Redenvelope.com have specific corporate gift sections.</p>
        <p>''We expect the corporate gift business will be something like 20 percent of sales next year,'' said Kenny Kurtzman, the chief executive of Ashford.com. ''We think it will grow faster than the rest of our business. It's a great market for us.''</p>
        <p>For time-is-money-conscious companies, the convenience of online gift shopping cannot be measured. ''Before, we had to stop what we were doing, hop in the car, go to a shop and pick it out,'' said Mr. Plantowsky of BindView. ''Now we just get on the Web, choose what we want, and they deliver it.''</p>
        <p>Even the old-guard offline gift stalwarts are expanding their online corporate activity. This fall, Tiffany &amp; Company, which has a consumer site called Tiffany.com, is introducing Tiffany for Business, a section on its Web site. And Steuben.com, the Web site for the glass company, has a corporate catalog section.</p>
        <p>''We think of Tiffanyforbusiness.com as an added service for our clients,'' said John Petterson, a senior vice president for direct marketing sales at Tiffany in New York. ''We're not looking at it as a way to generate huge sales revenues and drive the top line,'' he said. ''It's a good business approach because a lot of our clients are using the Internet. We think the business-to-business application is going to work well, because it saves time, and time is so valuable to people.''</p>
        <p>For Steuben, it is also a way to reach new customers. ''Our business is primarily in retail, but we are not in every state,'' said Andrea Miles, the director of sales and marketing at Steuben, which is based in Corning, N.Y. ''We also have a large catalog business. Now we have an additional component, the Web site, and corporate customers all over the world can access our brand.''</p>
        <p>With the holidays just around the corner, gift sites should be busy.  ''Christmas is, without question, the biggest time for corporate gift buying, especially for clients,'' noted Mr. May of Jupiter.</p>
        <p>What corporate gifts are in demand these days?</p>
        <p>The big sellers at Ashford.com are crystal, watches, writing instruments and leather items. At Tiffany, desk accessories like a 2001 leather diary, an international brass clock and crystal globes are popular. Steuben says among the hottest tickets are crystal hand coolers, which are based on 18th- and 19th-century marble or porcelain eggs that young ladies at dances would hold to calm their nerves. Which hand coolers are the most popular? ''We find our corporate clients buy a lot of eagles,'' said Ms. Miles. ''And the bull and the bear are very popular with Wall Streeters.''</p>
