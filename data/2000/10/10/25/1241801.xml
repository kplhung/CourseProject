      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Nortel Networks, the Canadian maker of telecommunications equipment, reported a third-quarter loss of $586 million, or 20 cents a diluted share, far wider than a loss of $79 million, or 3 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. Excluding the costs of acquisitions in the quarter, Nortel said it would have had earnings of $574 million, or 18 cents a share. Fueled by sales of fiber optic and wireless equipment, Nortel's revenue climbed 42 percent in the quarter to $7.31 billion. Among large telecommunications equipment companies, Nortel is considered to have been the most prescient in deploying fiber optic technology, which allows huge amounts of data to be transmitted on wavelengths of light. But the market was disappointed in the sales figures. Nortel's shares dropped 20 percent in after-hours trading, to $50, after closing regular trading at $63.31, off $3.13, or 5.4 percent.</p>
