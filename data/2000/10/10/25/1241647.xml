        <p>THE nation's health insurance companies are rushing, belatedly in most cases, to transfer their exasperating, clunky dealings with doctors and patients to the Internet.

        <p>THE nation's health insurance companies are rushing, belatedly in most cases, to transfer their exasperating, clunky dealings with doctors and patients to the Internet. After 10 years of trying to save money by spending less on care, they hope to squeeze savings from their bloated administrative costs.</p>
        <p>The companies also hope that by delivering information to patients and doctors in real time over the Internet, they will ease some of the frustration with denials of care and months of delays in payments that have stoked public anger against managed care. And the insurers think they can greatly increase their productivity by reducing misunderstandings online and promptly answering questions from doctors and patients about whether a particular treatment is covered.</p>
        <p>Some managed care companies are also using advanced technologies, including cellular telephones, to help members deal with a handful of costly ailments -- including cardiovascular disease, diabetes and asthma -- that generate disproportionate costs.</p>
        <p>Ten patients in New Hampshire who have a history of congestive heart failure regularly check their heart rhythms, take their blood pressure and weigh themselves on their bathroom scales. The readings are transmitted by cellular phone to a database at Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield of New Hampshire. ''Their physicians and case managers can go into that system and monitor their progress,'' said Dr. Alan Hinkle, the chief medical officer of Anthem New Hampshire.</p>
        <p>''Having this system in my house has changed my life,'' said Thomas Danna, 80, of Auburn, Mass., one of the first to try the wireless system. It sends reports to UMass Memorial Hospital in Worcester.</p>
        <p>''It's given me more independence and more satisfaction, knowing that I'm doing all right,'' said Mr. Danna, who is a member of a Medicare health maintenance organization operated by Harvard Pilgrim Health Care. Mr. Danna, a retired factory worker who has had three major heart operations, has been reporting by the wireless system for almost a year.</p>
        <p>Most insurers are striving to create and improve portals that help consumers stay healthy and track their own benefits. There are also Internet links to doctors that could save time and money for companies and doctors. And there are services for insurance brokers on the Web to provide comparative details of coverage and prices promptly for smaller employers.</p>
        <p>''We are trying to Web-enable everything that we do,'' said James Hudak, an executive vice president of UnitedHealth Group, a large managed care company based in Minneapolis. He said the Internet would be ''like the telephone, one of the major vehicles for communicating with our customers, suppliers and partners.'' But he acknowledged that doctors and many consumers were reluctant to trust sensitive information to the Internet.</p>
        <p>United is installing a national system that combs through millions of computerized records of medical services to identify individuals who seem in danger of having episodes of serious, expensive illnesses. Already tested in eight states, the system finds, for example, a heart patient who is not taking appropriate medicines or a diabetic who did not have a prescribed annual eye exam. A nurse contacts these patients and their doctors and suggests treatment.</p>
        <p>The system, called predictive modeling, will be in all of the company's health plans by December, said Dr. Archelle Georgiou, the chief medical officer of the United Healthcare unit of UnitedHealth.</p>
        <p>''The industry has finally woken up and begun to build technology to build a better product,'' said William Copeland, a managed care expert at Deloitte Consulting. ''There is a race to lay the groundwork, just like in the cable and telephone industries. Each health insurance company has a component, but no one has knitted it all together yet.</p>
        <p>''Historically the industry viewed itself as being able to contain medical costs,'' he went on. ''That model has been pretty soundly rejected by the consumer.'' Now the objective is to let consumers pick and choose their health plans, doctors and hospitals with guidance from their employers.</p>
        <p>Although employers are reluctant to make changes that might provoke objections from workers in a tight labor market, many companies are considering an eventual shift to so-called defined contribution plans. In these, employees are given a cash account to pay for all noncatastrophic health expenses directly. Some sites are experimenting with methods to allow patients and providers to link up under these systems in a way that some experts say could virtually eliminate insurers.</p>
        <p>To anticipate the trend, Highmark Blue Cross and Blue Shield, based in Pittsburgh, took a step toward the defined contribution idea last April. It offered workers at small and medium-size businesses up to 16 combinations of coverage. The employer determines the number of choices -- at least five -- and the plan member's share of costs.</p>
        <p>The program asks employees to indicate their priorities on a scale of 0 to 10 on, for example, the importance of costs and choice of doctor or hospital. In a few seconds, the program lists the alternatives and the cost for each, in order of the employee's preferences.</p>
        <p>''We tried it in April with three employers with 3,000 Highmark members,'' said Dr. Jim Klingensmith, a group executive vice president of Highmark. ''It is now being marketed to 100 employers.''</p>
        <p>Most of the big insurers are trying new approaches, often in partnership with Web technology companies.</p>
        <p>This month, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Michigan mailed user identification numbers to 3.1 million members, which they can use to log on to a Web site that will provide information related to their health status. The information is selected based on their medical claims by PersonalPath Systems, in Upper Saddle River, N.J. There will be no advertising.</p>
        <p>To guard the privacy of plan members, PersonalPath will not be able to connect that information with members' names, Michigan Blue Cross said.</p>
        <p>In January, Aetna U.S. Healthcare will begin providing information from Harvard Medical School to members of its open-access health plan. Joyce Oberdorf, a spokeswoman, said members would have a ''password-protected home page'' where they could check on claims and sign up for help with chronic illnesses.</p>
        <p>''If we can get people to get their health care transactions online, we will have gigantic productivity gains,'' said David Snow, the chief operating officer of Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield in New York. It will offer three million members ''real time access'' to claims information later this year. If they have trouble using the site, they can click on a button and an Empire representative will call them.</p>
        <p>For doctors, Empire is testing a system provided by OneHealthBank.com that will tell doctors within minutes what services a patient's insurance covers. Some doctors have long suspected that insurance companies deliberately delay payments so they can add that money to their interest-bearing investments. Mr. Snow said Empire would pay participating doctors by mail or by wire within 48 hours.</p>
        <p>''It costs a doctor today 12 to 14 percent of gross revenues to collect his money,'' Mr. Snow said. Doctors would pay a 5 percent transaction fee and still have a net gain of 7 percent to 9 percent, he said.</p>
        <p>Health plans ''can't do everything at one time,'' said Jody Voss, the executive director of business development for the national Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association. ''It's a re-engineering process, not just creating a front-end Web site. We want to ensure consistent, accurate information for that consumer.''</p>
        <p>Doug Williams, a vice president for health care consulting at I.B.M., said: ''It's a major issue for the insurance companies to get online. They have to get their legacy systems to talk to the Internet. It's one of the most complex problems that they are solving.''</p>
