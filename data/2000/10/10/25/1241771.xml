        <p>An appeals court handed the Giuliani administration a major victory yesterday, ruling that Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi overstepped his authority in March when he rejected $104 million in welfare-to-work contracts while raising what the court called unfounded allegations of corruption.</p>
        <p>The unanimous decision by the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court, sitting in Manhattan, overturned a lower court ruling in April, and cleared the way for the city to reinstate Maximus Inc., the Virginia contractor selected by the city to help thousands of welfare recipients find private jobs.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hevesi had claimed that Maximus improperly took advantage of special access to top Giuliani administration officials, among other improprieties, while it pursued what would have been the largest welfare contract in its history.</p>
        <p>The comptroller also alleged that the city improperly disregarded its rigorous contracting rules in using an abbreviated review process for all the welfare-to-work contracts.</p>
        <p>''There was no evidence of favoritism by the use of this process,'' the appellate ruling said. ''There was no evidence that Maximus was afforded unfair access.''</p>
        <p>The five appeals court justices  also reasserted that the City Charter establishes the mayor's power as the final arbiter on city contracts. They said Mr. Hevesi had a ''mandatory duty'' to approve the Maximus deal after the mayor had dismissed Mr. Hevesi's objections in March.</p>
        <p>The Maximus contracts were the cornerstone of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's far-reaching plan to overhaul work requirements for welfare recipients. The company had proposed establishing neighborhood work centers, where applicants would be evaluated and, if necessary, get job training to prepare them for placement in jobs at businesses. Mr. Hevesi's action and the lower court ruling effectively suspended operations by Maximus in New York, although other smaller contractors were providing similar services.</p>
        <p>The Giuliani administration claimed yesterday's ruling as vindication of the mayor's long-running and oft-contested drive to trim hundreds of thousands of poor people from the welfare rolls, and of Jason A. Turner, the commissioner of the Human Resources Administration.</p>
        <p>''It is a victory for this administration and it is a victory for the City Charter,'' said Corporation Counsel Michael D. Hess, one of several top Giuliani officials who gathered at a City Hall news conference to celebrate the decision. ''It is a setback for all the people in this city who have vigorously opposed welfare reform and their position has been beaten down by this decision.''</p>
        <p>Maximus officials also expressed pleasure with the decision.</p>
        <p>''We were always confident that the decision of the court would vindicate Maximus,'' David V. Mastran, the company's chief executive, said in a statement.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hevesi's office said it needed time to study the ruling before deciding whether to appeal, but, because the decision was unanimous, his own staff acknowledged late yesterday that such a step would be difficult.</p>
        <p>''We are disappointed with this decision,'' said David Neustadt, a spokesman for Mr. Hevesi. ''We think it was in error.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Neustadt said the comptroller still stood by his original allegations regarding Maximus and the contracting process. Those allegations were based on documents that showed that company officials met with Mr. Turner and others even before the contract was advertised, and the revelation that Maximus did not fully disclose that it intended to subcontract about $30 million worth of the $104 million award to a company set up by a former Giuliani official, Richard J. Schwartz.</p>
        <p>Maximus and Mr. Turner are also still the subject of criminal investigation by local and federal authorities related, in part, to the allegations Mr. Hevesi first raised in February. And Mr. Turner paid a $6,500 fine this month after acknowledging that he violated city conflict of interest rules by using an aide and city office equipment to complete work on a personal business matter.</p>
        <p>''We have had 10 to 12 violations of federal, state and city law,'' said City Councilman Stephen DiBrienza, a Brooklyn Democrat and frequent critic of the mayor and Mr. Turner. ''This case speaks more to questions over the comptroller's power versus the mayor power, rather than the legacy of Jason Turner.''</p>
        <p>But Deputy Mayor Joseph J. Lhota said late yesterday that Mr. Hevesi owed the Giuliani administration an apology for what Mr. Hess called the comptroller's ''grave error,'' in refusing to approve the contracts.</p>
        <p>Mr. Neustadt, who handled all inquiries for the comptroller yesterday related to the ruling, declined to offer an apology, but he disputed suggestions by Mr. Hess that the comptroller opposes efforts to move welfare recipients toward self-sufficient lives. ''That is nonsense and he knows it,'' Mr. Neustadt said.</p>
        <p>The ruling coincidentally came on the same day that about 125 critics of the Giuliani administration's welfare policies, including Mr. DiBrienza, assembled on the City Hall steps to call for Mr. Turner's resignation. The rally organizers said late yesterday that they still wanted Mr. Turner to resign, citing nearly a dozen other rulings or lawsuits against the administration in recent years regarding its treatment of the homeless, AIDS patients and others in need.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani, speaking before the court issued its ruling, scoffed at the notion, and defended Mr. Turner's management of the welfare-to-work programs, saying that objections to his style surface ''because he is taking on a political mentality that was very different, and was very much attuned to the idea that you help people by making them dependent.''</p>
        <p>The court's ruling did not indicate whether the justices considered allegations that surfaced after Mr. Hevesi rejected the contract, including an admission by Maximus that it made a mistake in judgment by hiring Mr. Turner's father-in-law for a job in Wisconsin while it was seeking the New York City deal. Maximus also hired and then placed a family friend of Mr. Turner into a contracting job within the Human Resources Administration as it prepared to bid on the city welfare-to-work deal.</p>
        <p>Officials have said those matters are under review by the criminal investigators, although spokesmen for the United States attorney's office and the Manhattan district attorney's office have consistently declined to discuss the inquiries.</p>
        <p>Even if Mr. Hevesi does not appeal yesterday's ruling, it is not clear if the city and Maximus want to reinstate the deal. Maximus pulled its staff out of the city in April after the ruling by Justice William J. Davis of the Supreme Court, who agreed with Mr. Hevesi that the contracting process had been ''corrupted.''</p>
        <p>The city is not under extraordinary pressure to immediately reinstate Maximus because Mr. Hevesi approved 15 welfare-to-work contracts with other companies. A top official from one of the other winning contractors said last week that the city had been having a hard time finding enough welfare recipients to keep all the other contractors busy.</p>
