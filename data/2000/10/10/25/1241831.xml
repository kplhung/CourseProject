        <p>The pregame atmosphere outside Shea Stadium was more like a morgue than a madhouse. The home team was down two games to none and the fans still had visions of Roger Clemens dancing in their heads. That was, of course, before the Mets beat the Yankees, 4-2, in Game 3 to make this a series again.</p>
        <p>Earlier in the day, when the Yankee team bus arrived somewhere around 4 p.m. and as the players entered through the press gate, there were a few choice words for Roger Clemens, but he did not accept the bait and the fans offered little more in return.</p>
        <p>''He's a hot-headed hick,'' said Chris Huber of the Texas-bred Clemens. Huber, a 24-year-old meter reader from the Richmond Hill section of Queens, accused Clemens of redneckery, of drinking too much moonshine, of plain bad sportsmanship. ''Still, I'd love to have him on my team,'' said Huber, who had no tickets to the evening's game.</p>
        <p>Even the afternoon news that Major League Baseball had fined Clemens $50,000 for his bat-throwing did little to buoy the spirits of Mets fans, which sagged like a wet sheet.</p>
        <p>''We're down two games,'' said Dennis Dunn, 37, who works in a New Rochelle supermarket that is part of a chain that calls itself the official supermarket of the Subway Series. ''But the more interesting thing to me is that it seems that not only did Clemens intimidate the Mets, he intimidated the Mets crowd.''</p>
        <p>And so it went. Yankees fans marched around the perimeter of Shea, waving brooms and hurling insults and getting little comment in return. ''The Yankee fans are cocky and we're sullen and it hurts to see it,'' said Huber, the meter reader, who was holding a sign that said: ''Sweep? Not In Our House.''</p>
        <p>''Everybody seems lethargic,'' he said. ''Hopefully, when we get one under our belts, it will all turn around.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, as Armando Benitez was closing in on that victory, the fans were going wild.</p>
        <p>Perhaps another reason for the sluggishness was that there were more than 700 police officers in attendance. According to police officials stationed in a large trailer in the parking lot, there were undercover officers trying to buy scalped tickets, officers combing the parking lots for beer-drinkers, marijuana smokers and illegal barbecues, beat officers on bicycles and sharpshooters.</p>
        <p>One sergeant was challenged by a Mets fan. ''Are you for the Mets or the Yankees?'' he wanted to know.</p>
        <p>''I'm a fan of overtime,'' the sergeant said. When asked his name for publication, he amended his statement, and said: ''I'm for New York. If one team wins, we all win.''</p>
        <p>As game time approached, it was clear that there were a lot of Bombers fans in the house. Both teams assembled along the foul lines and Clemens was there, too, although his No. 22 was concealed by a warm-up jacket, making him harder to spot from the stands.</p>
        <p>''He shouldn't even be in the stadium,'' said the Mets booster Terry Tranguch, 40, who came all the way from Hazleton, Pa. ''He got away with a crime.''</p>
        <p>The stadium itself was ringed with signs challenging the manhood of Clemens, placards that said unsociable things and others containing unprintable diatribes.</p>
        <p>But the Yankee fans were noticeable, too, a bigger, and more vocal, minority at Shea than Mets fans were in the first two games at Yankee Stadium. And some of them left after the bottom of the eighth, when the Mets scored two runs to take the lead.</p>
        <p>One of the more colorful Yankee fans at Shea was Freddy (the Fan) Schuman of the Bronx was also there, banging his pot with a spoon and letting all the Mets fans know that he was not here to brag, he just wanted the Yankees to win. Besides, what were Mets fans going to do? Give a 75-year-old man a real hard time? ''I'm not making no predictions, no nothing,'' said Freddy the Fan. ''It's just a sport. When they come by and yell at me, it's off my back like water off a duck.''</p>
        <p>If you've never seen Freddy, he has a gravel voice and eyebrows of steel wool. He wears a button that says ''God Bless America'' and he saw his first Yankee game at 9.</p>
        <p>But he has never watched a Yankee game objectively, because he loves them too much. And he has never seen them with full vision, because he lost an eye in a stickball game before he ever made it to Yankee Stadium.</p>
        <p>''Awww, it's all right about the eye,'' Freddy the Fan said. ''I had friends who didn't come back from the war. And if people are going to get all crazy about a ball game, they should first remember something like that.''</p>
