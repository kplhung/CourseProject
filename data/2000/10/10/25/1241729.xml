        <p>When the Counseling Is Troubled</p>
        <p>EDMUND W. GORDON, the interim dean of Teachers College at Columbia University for three months, has taken on the chairmanship of the troubled Department of Counseling and Clinical Psychology, replacing DR. ROBERT T. CARTER (left). In a letter to the department's faculty last week, Dr. Gordon said that the department was ''not functioning well'' and that he would begin a formal inquiry.</p>
        <p>The decision followed the resignation of LISA MILLER, one of the assistant professors brought in to help strengthen the clinical psychology program, which had been put on probation by the American Psychological Association. In a letter to ARTHUR E. LEVINE, the college's president, she said that Dr. Carter ''has made what would otherwise be an exceptionally exciting, intellectually rich working environment one that is full of hate and fear.''</p>

        <p>When the Counseling Is Troubled</p>
        <p>EDMUND W. GORDON, the interim dean of Teachers College at Columbia University for three months, has taken on the chairmanship of the troubled Department of Counseling and Clinical Psychology, replacing DR. ROBERT T. CARTER (left). In a letter to the department's faculty last week, Dr. Gordon said that the department was ''not functioning well'' and that he would begin a formal inquiry.</p>
        <p>The decision followed the resignation of LISA MILLER, one of the assistant professors brought in to help strengthen the clinical psychology program, which had been put on probation by the American Psychological Association. In a letter to ARTHUR E. LEVINE, the college's president, she said that Dr. Carter ''has made what would otherwise be an exceptionally exciting, intellectually rich working environment one that is full of hate and fear.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Carter said yesterday that he could not comment on personnel issues, but that the faculty was composed of ''fairly strong-minded individuals'' and that he had been working to ease the frictions. Other students and faculty members, like CHRISTINE YEH, an assistant professor, said they found Dr. Carter's manner direct, but supportive and nurturing.</p>
        <p>Dr. Gordon has asked the Center for Conflict Resolution at Teachers College for assistance and set up a committee to advise him, including Dr. Carter, BARRY A. FARBER, who heads the clinical psychology program, and MORTON DEUTSCH, an emeritus professor of psychology and education at the college.</p>
        <p>Contest at Principals' Union</p>
        <p>JILL LEVY, the incumbent president of the New York City principals' union, the Council of Supervisors and Administrators, is facing a contest for the presidency. Her challenger is ROBERT G. SPATA, the principal of Middle School 180 in Rockaway Park, Queens, until he was removed at the end of last school year by the acting superintendent of District 27, MATTHEW BROMME. Mr. Spata, now assigned to the district office, is under investigation for how he handled a sexual assault at his school, according to MARGIE FEINBERG, a spokeswoman for the Board of Education. Although Mr. Spata has never held union office, some union officials said he might win protest votes from members unhappy with their current contract, which requires them to work a longer year for more pay and under which they gave up some tenure protection. Mr. Spata was not in the office late yesterday and could not be reached for comment. Balloting is set for the first two weeks of December.</p>
        <p>Betting on the Chancellor</p>
        <p>It is hardly unusual to receive an honorary degree. But last week, ROBERT L. KING, the chancellor of the State University of New York, received a different kind of honor. The SUNY College of Technology at Morrisville named a young colt after him in recognition of his support for the college's equine science and management program, which maintains about 150 horses. The standardbred colt, Chancellor King's Crown, born on May 23, is brown with a black mane and white markings near his hooves and will be trained for harness racing.</p>
        <p>$250 Million Goal at Buffalo</p>
        <p>The State University of New York at Buffalo has announced a $250 million capital campaign. Although public university campuses in Arizona, California, Illinois, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Texas and Virginia are seeking to raise $1 billion or more, according to the Chronicle of Higher Education, Buffalo said its goal was the largest yet for a public campus in New York State. Buffalo's president, WILLIAM R. GREINER, said that donors had already given or pledged $130 million.</p>
        <p>New Faces at Fordham and Fashion Institute</p>
        <p>Three new administrators have recently been named at local universities. DR. PETER B. VAUGHAN has started work as the dean of the Graduate School of Social Service at Fordham University. He was formerly the acting dean of the University of Pennsylvania School of Social Work and replaces MARY ANN QUARANTA.</p>
        <p>At the Fashion Institute of Technology, REGINETTA HABOUCHA, formerly of Marist College in Poughkeepsie, is the new dean of the School of Liberal Arts and Sciences. And DR. J. C. SPENDER is the dean of F.I.T.'s School of Business and Technology.</p>
