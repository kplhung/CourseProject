        <p>At the Battle Shooting Range, Kady Harari, 36, stood with her feet planted wide, raised a semiautomatic weapon, set her sights on the target's heart and trembled. Then, feeling sick, she later said, she squeezed the trigger of a pistol for the first time in her life and sent a bullet ricocheting off the padded ceiling.</p>
        <p>Wearing a long khaki skirt and a baseball cap -- a uniform of the modern religious woman here -- she looked like an unlikely sharpshooter. But several spent magazines later, she had considerably improved.</p>
        <p>And in a single hour Ms. Harari, of Flatbush, Brooklyn, and three other primly dressed women qualified to apply for gun permits so that, as they see it, they will be able to defend themselves in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>
        <p>''We feel like if it could happen in Gilo, it could happen anywhere in the city,'' Ms. Harari said of the fighting in a southern Jerusalem neighborhood. ''We also feel that the army isn't doing what it can do. The army is holding back. At a funeral last week I personally saw soldiers crouched behind boulders while the settlers were running after the Arabs. That was the trigger point for me, so to speak.''</p>
        <p>Although the United Nations has condemned Israel's use of force during this protracted conflict as excessive, most Israelis believe that their army has acted with considerable restraint.</p>
        <p>Some, in fact, say it is the perceived restraint that has been excessive. Inside Israel, this feeling has provoked much debate about the strategic virtue of the army's ''holding back'' and some moves by private citizens to arm themselves as a backup defense system.</p>
        <p>Gun shops report a substantial rise in weapon and ammunition sales. The owner of Battle, located in a strip shopping center here, said that he had sold three times as many guns as usual in the last month, and that target practice sessions had increased fivefold. Another owner, of the Magnum 88 Gun Shop, called his increased business the reflection of growing personal insecurity in Jerusalem, where the explosive sounds of shooting and shelling fill the night.</p>
        <p>In the political and security establishment, there is alarm about civilians' arming themselves and possible vigilantism. Nonetheless, a parallel debate has raged about whether the Israeli Army is losing face and deterrent power in the region.</p>
        <p>Many rightists first voiced this concern after Israel's troop withdrawal from Lebanon last spring, which the Hezbollah guerrillas proclaimed as their victory against the mighty Israeli Army. During the present conflict, the anxiety surfaced even among some centrists after two separate incidents in Nablus during which Israelis bled to death while waiting many hours to be evacuated by the army.</p>
        <p>In the second Nablus incident, in which a Palestinian man also died, a settlers' excursion provoked a firefight in the hills above the Palestinian city last week. Israeli television showed images of Palestinians shooting while settlers hid behind rocks and called in to the stations on cellular phones pleading for the army to rescue them.</p>
        <p>That raised considerable questions among some Israeli viewers about the army's overall approach during this conflict.</p>
        <p>''It seems that this will be the first war in the history of the state of Israel in which a government is avoiding or, if you will, is holding back from saving the lives of Israeli citizens only in order to avoid hurting Arabs,'' Nadav Shragai, a conservative columnist, wrote in the newspaper Haaretz.</p>
        <p>In contrast, some Israelis applauded the military for its ''restraint'' while excoriating it for allowing the settlers to set out on a hike above Nablus during such a volatile time.</p>
        <p>''The army should get a medal for its handling of the incident,'' Shlomo Gazit, a former general, wrote in The Jerusalem Post, ''for its success in locating the sources of fire and evacuating the hikers with minimum casualties on both sides.''</p>
        <p>To Palestinians, the Israeli perception of restraint in that incident and any other sounds ludicrous and offensive. Palestinian officials point out their death toll and the relative balance of fatalities -- more than 125 people have been killed, almost all of them Palestinian.</p>
        <p>''What kind of restraint is this?'' asked Saeb Erekat, a senior Palestinian official.</p>
        <p>In a recent ABC News ''Nightline'' town meeting program in Jerusalem, Ephraim Sneh, Israel's deputy defense minister, summed up the Israeli establishment's thinking. He argued that the unbalanced nature of the conflict was awkward for Israel, which clearly has superior military power and the technical means to do far greater damage.</p>
        <p>''When you take the Israeli-Palestinian confrontation, or dialogue, away from the negotiating table to the street, we are always in an inferior position because we are stronger,'' said Mr. Sneh, a Labor Party politician, as Palestinians in the audience hooted and booed. ''At the moment that you start the cycle of violence, our strength becomes our weakness.''</p>
        <p>International groups have criticized Israel for too much shooting during riots, and for stepping up its response too quickly from nonlethal riot control techniques to lethal ones. Amnesty International, in a recent report, said Israel was using combat techniques when it should be using policing methods to disperse violent disturbances.</p>
        <p>Israeli military spokesmen say they have adhered to very specific rules of engagement. They say they have used tear gas and stun grenades first and then proceeded to rubber-coated metal bullets, which are supposed to be shot at the lower body and from a distance of more than 25 meters (82 feet) from the subject.</p>
        <p>They say they use live ammunition in response to firebombs -- when they shoot at the lower body -- and to shooting and grenades, when they shoot to kill.</p>
        <p>Acknowledging that there ''can be errors,'' Israeli spokesmen insist that they aim at ''those who deserve it'' -- in the military language, those who are aiming equivalent force in their direction. The Israeli casualties are few because the soldiers are trained and well-equipped, they say, but also because, unlike the Palestinian militiamen, they wear protective gear from head to toe.</p>
        <p>The Palestinian authorities dispute the Israelis' account, referring to what they say is a disproportionate use of live fire into crowds, close-range shooting of rubber bullets, rubber-bullet shooting at the chest and head and excessive casualties involving children.</p>
        <p>Most Israelis do not weigh in on the army's handling of the clashes with Palestinians. They speak up when the fighting comes closer to home and involves Israeli civilians. They have particularly criticized the army for what Dore Gold, a former Israeli ambassador to the United Nations, called its ''pale response to Jerusalem being attacked'' -- that is, to the firing on Gilo from the Palestinian town of Beit Jala.</p>
        <p>Palestinians do not think the response -- shelling from tanks and helicopters at sources of fire -- is pale. It has terrorized Beit Jala, even if it caused no casualties. But the Israeli Army does, in a sense, agree with its Israeli critics that it is being cautious.</p>
        <p>''Yesterday we had a shooting that we didn't even respond to, because we couldn't identify the source of fire,'' a military official said. ''It's a very delicate situation. We don't want to be dragged into a vast response there, where we destroy 10 or 15 houses, and there are civilian casualties, and then they call for international forces to be sent to Jerusalem.''</p>
        <p>Critics of Prime Minister Ehud Barak say he has threatened too many times that Israel ''knows what to do'' without following up his threats. They point to the 48-hour ultimatum that Mr. Barak gave for the Palestinians to halt the violence or face a tougher military response. After the 48 hours passed, the ultimatum was dropped.</p>
        <p>From Ms. Harari's perspective, the picture is grim and frightening. Native Israelis tell her that they have not known this kind of fear for decades, she said.</p>
        <p>Standing in the shooting range, near a Glock Pistols poster, Ms. Harari said her neighbor had recently returned from military reserve duty. ''He was told to run,'' she said. ''That should be his first response. And to me that pretty much summed things up.''</p>
        <p>Standing amid a litter of bullet shells, she removed the ear protectors from around her neck. ''I'm a vegetarian,'' she said. ''I was so against, screaming against, guns. And now look at me.''</p>
