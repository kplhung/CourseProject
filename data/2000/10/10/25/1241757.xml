        <p>Vice President Al Gore laid claim to being the candidate of limited government today, rebutting Gov. George W. Bush's labeling of him as a big spender by promising that he would not increase the number of federal employees while he was in office.</p>
        <p>He also toughened his critique of Mr. Bush by suggesting that his Republican rival would be ''a pliant president'' who would mold public policy to please the special interests that have underwritten his campaign.</p>
        <p>Two weeks before Election Day, Mr. Gore explained his views on government in an address in Little Rock, Ark., the former home of the man who asked him to join his ticket eight years ago. But now fearful of standing beside a tarnished Bill Clinton, Mr. Gore did not invite the president to join him in Little Rock, and he mentioned his name only in passing today.</p>
        <p>Administration officials said today that Mr. Clinton was considering campaigning for Mr. Gore, but not with Mr. Gore, in Arkansas and Louisiana sometime next week.</p>
        <p>The rally at River Market Square in Little Rock was two blocks from the planned site of Mr. Clinton's presidential library. But with national network cameras trained his way, Mr. Gore repeatedly passed up opportunities to pay homage to Mr. Clinton before the home folks, though he did praise other Arkansas politicians in attendance, like former Senator Dale Bumpers and current Senator Blanche Lincoln.</p>
        <p>And yet, Mr. Clinton's spirit and legacy pervaded Mr. Gore's speech, the first of a set of issue-oriented addresses the vice president plans to deliver between now and Nov. 7.</p>
        <p>''I don't ever want to see another era of big government,'' declared Mr. Gore, the Democratic nominee, echoing Mr. Clinton's 1996 declaration that ''the era of big government is over.'' Mr. Gore added, ''But I certainly don't want to ever see another era of special interests who wield more power than the American people have.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore bookended his day with appearances in Mr. Clinton's home state and his own, greeting workers at his national headquarters in Nashville this evening and then attending  fund-raisers here. In between, he held a rally on a steamy airport tarmac in Shreveport, La. Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore carried all three states he visited today in 1992 and 1996.</p>
        <p>The vice president hopes to spend the rest of the campaign making the policy distinctions between himself and Mr. Bush as stark as possible, and he began that task with today's address. His goal, he made clear, was to undercut the Republican depiction of him as ''a mythical big-spending, big-government candidate, a cartoon image from campaigns past.''</p>
        <p>''I'm opposed to big government,'' Mr. Gore declared, speaking to a crowd of invited guests in a convention center meeting room. ''I'm for a smaller, smarter government, one that serves people better, but offers real change and gives more choices to our families.''</p>
        <p>Told of Mr. Gore's remarks tonight, Mr. Bush responded, ''He's the biggest spender we've ever had in the history of politics.''</p>
        <p>Following in Mr. Clinton's ideological footsteps, Mr. Gore said he was the only candidate who believed in limited government. ''I have believed in it long before it was fashionable to do so in the Democratic Party,'' he said. ''I don't believe there's a government solution to every problem. I don't believe any government program can replace the responsibility of parents, the hard work of families or the innovation of industry.''</p>
        <p>To drive home the point, Mr. Gore equated the consequences of government expansion with those of Mr. Bush's proposed $1.3 trillion income tax cut, which Mr. Gore has derided as foolhardy fiscal policy.</p>
        <p>''A return to big government,'' Mr. Gore said, ''would be as wrong for our economy as a return to big tax cuts for the wealthy.''</p>
        <p>To that end, Mr. Gore vowed: ''I will not add to the number of people doing work for the federal government, not by even one position, and there will be more who leave those ranks than the ones who are replaced.''</p>
        <p>He also said he would shrink the federal government to its smallest share of the economy in 50 years and would begin a second phase of the ''reinventing government'' initiative that he had directed for Mr. Clinton. That round of consolidations and agency reductions cut the number of federal jobs by more than 300,000, Mr. Gore said.</p>
        <p>Dan Bartlett, a Bush spokesman, said it ''strains credibility'' for Mr. Gore to take credit for job cuts because the vast majority of those resulted from the post-cold-war retrenchment in the armed forces.</p>
        <p>In His Own Words</p>
        <p>AL GORE  Remarks yesterday in Little Rock, Ark.:</p>
        <p>''Empowering people means giving them the power to shape their own lives. Because he gives most of the tax breaks and all the power to powerful interests, Governor Bush will leave millions of families powerless and broke, left to the tender mercies of big impersonal interests and institutions.</p>
        <p>I don't ever want to see another era of big government, but I certainly don't want to ever see another era of special interests who wield more power than the American people have. We went through that stage back in the 1890's before the Progressive era.</p>
        <p>Now, let's be clear about one thing. The more than $100 million raised by Governor Bush before the campaign really got into its homestretch came in significant part from a new generation of special-interest power brokers, who would like nothing better than a pliant president who would bend public policy to suit their purposes and profits, a president who would turn the decisions over to them. They know that I would fight for you, no matter what. . . .</p>
        <p>In this tale of two candidates, I'm the one who believes in limited government and I have believed in it long before it was fashionable to do so in the Democratic Party. I don't believe there's a government solution to every problem. I don't believe any government program can replace the responsibility of parents, the hard work of families or the innovation of industry.''</p>
