        <p>BACK when the idea of e-health seemed fresh and inevitably lucrative, three companies were often described as the sector's sure winners: Medscape, Healtheon and WebMD. In a new and already crowded field, the three promised to go beyond the popular patient information sites and change the nature of medical communication, restructure the nation's health care systems and, oh yes, save lives.</p>
        <p>Investors in 1999 reacted with Pavlovian shouts of ''buy'' for these and many other health-related dot-com stock offerings. But doctors and consumers yawned, and Wall Street quickly pulled the rug out, just as it had done with so many other Internet companies. So the question is: What will they do now?</p>
        <p>Become different companies, analysts said.</p>
        <p>And indeed, they have -- and in similar ways. Healtheon and WebMD not only merged, under the name of WebMD, but they also spent billions to acquire non-dot-com companies to secure a steady revenue stream and establish a stronger foothold in the medical community. Medscape, meanwhile, merged with MedicaLogic, a software company, for the same reasons.</p>
        <p>While these moves do not necessarily signal that WebMD and Medscape have given up their grand ambitions, they do reflect the sober reality that investors will not subsidize grand dot-com visions without seeing some real revenue. In this case, that means injecting a Web company with executives and the business methods of a non-dot-com and building the company from a traditional model outward.</p>
        <p>In that respect, the story echoes similar tales from the retail world, where bricks-and-mortar merchants with Web components are in most cases dominating their ''pure play'' competitors. WebMD and Medscape have mirrored that situation by buying or merging with established companies that wanted to capitalize on the Internet. And if that is the price of doing business in this era of investor skepticism, executives and analysts said, so be it.</p>
        <p>Which is not to say that their stock prices have flourished even during their metamorphoses. The stock of WebMD, which merged with Healtheon late last year, has dropped from a high of about $105 last year to the mid-teens earlier this month. Medscape never reached such heights, but its stock has also dropped sharply.</p>
        <p>Analysts said the sell-off was due in part to the tremendous momentum trading last year and early this year, during which the market values of Internet companies with minuscule revenue rivaled those of multinational banks. More rational valuations were inevitable, they said, but analysts stressed that the task of revolutionizing health care had been harder than anyone initially thought.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, analysts said, there are indications that they can deliver at least part of their promises. ''If anyone's going to be left standing, it's these two companies,'' said Thaddeus Grimes-Gruczka, a vice president of Cyber Dialogue, a consulting firm. ''It's just a matter of time.''</p>
        <p>WebMD is the product of the merger between Healtheon and WebMD. Healtheon was started by Jim Clark, the founder of Netscape, while WebMD was founded by Jeffrey T. Arnold, a former medical equipment executive. The two men had hoped to connect the various parts of the health care system -- hospitals, doctors, patients and managed care companies and insurers -- through one site. To attract patients, WebMD's site brimmed with medical information.</p>
        <p>Medscape's ambition was to build an information site focused on medical professionals. Because medical professionals have tremendous purchasing power, particularly with pharmaceutical companies, Medscape would be able to charge high advertising fees, provided it could get enough users to come to it and its companion site, CBSHealthwatch.com.</p>
        <p>While Medscape attracted millions of users and was recognized for its content, the advertising and sponsorship dollars were not enough to cover the tens of millions in costs.</p>
        <p>As cracks were appearing in Medscape's plan, so, too, were fault lines spreading through the plans of WebMD and Healtheon. Both companies realized that doctors were unwilling to invest time, money and effort in Internet-based office systems, and without the doctors, WebMD and Healtheon had little chance of success.</p>
        <p>The two merged last November, betting that one business could solve the e-health-care problem more effectively, and began a buying spree. WebMD bought  Medical Manager and its subsidiary, CareInsite, for $2.3 billion. Medical Manager helps doctors manage patient schedules while connecting doctors' offices, insurance companies and health maintenance organizations through a proprietary network.</p>
        <p>The company also spent $2 billion in its stock to buy Envoy, a clearinghouse for transactions between doctors and insurance companies. With these and other acquisitions, analysts said, the company established enough leverage within the medical and insurance industries to make a meaningful push into the market.</p>
        <p>Medscape was also evolving -- and, like WebMD, the company was using mergers and acquisitions. The most important of these was its merger with MedicaLogic, which took place earlier this year.</p>
        <p>Like Medical Manager, MedicaLogic, which began in the early 90's, sold software to doctors. Unlike the physician management services, MedicaLogic was more focused on doctors than on office operations, selling software that helped create digital records of patients.</p>
        <p>With MedicaLogic as its cornerstone, Medscape's new corporate mission was sealed: the plan was to connect every doctor to the Web, preferably with a hand-held device, and give them a way to create digital medical records.</p>
        <p>As with WebMD, Medscape's consumer Web site provides a vehicle for reaching doctors and selling them software, and it remains an important source of advertising and sponsorship revenue. And, as with WebMD, Medscape has become more of a business-to-business company than a consumer site. Analysts said the improved versions of the companies were perhaps closer to the mark than their earlier versions, but they still face hurdles.</p>
        <p>''They're both depending on a radical shift of automating and wiring the doctor's office,'' said Claudine Singer, an analyst with Jupiter Research. ''When you talk about it in theory, it makes complete sense, but health care is not a reasonable industry. Some might call this a Herculean task. Some might call it Sisyphean.''</p>
        <p>Executives of the companies think that theirs is not a futile effort, but they are quick to point out the obstacles.</p>
        <p>''This industry has the lowest spending on I.T. of any major industry,'' said Mark Leavitt, a doctor who is the chairman of Medscape. On average, he said, health care companies spend 3.9 percent of their revenue on information technology systems. For financial services companies, by contrast, the figure is more than 10 percent.</p>
        <p>As a result, he said, ''you can't hope to create an efficient market by just applying the Internet to it. You have to pick a piece where you can get leverage, then stick to it for years and years.''</p>
        <p>Among other things, Medscape's software, which Dr. Leavitt developed for MedicaLogic, lets doctors type their notes into a computer or hand-held device and then creates a digital record and a database. Because the software is Web based, doctors can gain access to those records from wherever they have Internet access. The software subscription fees range from $100 to $300 a month. Medscape has enrolled 19,000 doctors, a small number considering there more than 400,000 doctors practicing in the United States.</p>
        <p>But Dr. Leavitt said that with the growth of handheld computing devices, doctors will be much more inclined to use the service. ''We're going to run as hard as we can with Palms and laptops,'' he said, ''but the appearance of new Web devices are going to give a kick to this.''</p>
        <p>Kevin Berg, a research analyst with the First Albany Corporation, an investment firm, said he expected Medscape to make a profit in the second quarter of 2002 -- which was the same time he forecast profitability for WebMD, which in late September laid off 1,100 employees -- 20 percent of its work force. WebMD's stock continued to languish after Mr. Arnold resigned as co-chief executive earlier this month. (Mr. Clark resigned from the board the same day.)</p>
        <p>The linchpin of WebMD's business is its relationship with physician management services like Medical Manager. In addition to owning Medical Manager, WebMD has agreements with several other physician management service companies to market WebMD. But before it can do that successfully, analysts said, WebMD must integrate its Internet system with those of the physician management companies.</p>
        <p>That is because rather than distributing information over the Web, these services use proprietary networks that link each party directly to the others. WebMD hopes to route these communications through its Web site, giving access to all parties involved in a medical transaction. That way, a doctor who has finished a patient appointment could, through one site, send a prescription request to a pharmacy, submit a claim to the insurance company, order laboratory tests and send an e-mail message to the patient.</p>
        <p>WebMD has said it is moving to knit together its management services and will be rolling out the service soon through its Medical Manager clients. But such projections have done little to win the hearts of investors.</p>
        <p>On the day the company announced that Martin J. Wygod, Medical Manager's chairman and WebMD's co-chief executive, would become WebMD's sole chief executive, the company also held a conference call with investment analysts. Among other things, analysts questioned WebMD executives about the company's 2001 revenue. Within 24 hours, several analysts had downgraded WebMD's stock.</p>
        <p>''Arnold's move wasn't at all unexpected,'' said Mr. Berg of First Albany. ''Marty Wygod's got his team in place now, and it's very respected. The reason for the downgrades was that people were expecting more positive news about 2001.''</p>
        <p>In particular, Mr. Berg said, analysts were hoping for  projections of revenue growth for 2001 in the range of 20 percent, and instead heard numbers closer to 6 percent.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wygod, meanwhile, defended the company by saying that he would sell off or eliminate some of the dozens of businesses acquired by WebMD and Healtheon over the last few years and that the remaining revenue would only come from those business units with long-term potential. Mr. Wygod declined to say which units would be sold off.</p>
        <p>''The vision of the combined companies will remain the same,'' Mr. Wygod said. ''But our execution is going to be much more focused than before.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Wygod added that his tenure in the medical industry would help in this respect. ''The fact that I spent the last 20 years working with the major players on cost containment brings a lot of comfort to them.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Berg of First Albany was cautiously optimistic that Mr. Wygod could make good on his word. ''If you're going to bet on this company, you're betting that this management team will be able to sprinkle its magic dust on it and turn it around,'' he added. ''There's no question it's the best management in the e-health space. But it's just going to take longer than some people expected.''</p>
