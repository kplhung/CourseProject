        <p>President Clinton and King Abdullah of Jordan signed a free trade agreement today that commits them to safeguard worker rights and the environment, an unprecedented step that won praise from labor unions and environmental groups that have opposed every major trade initiative of Mr. Clinton's presidency.</p>
        <p>The agreement is the first one in American history that includes labor and environmental standards as part of the main text, essentially putting the rights of workers to form unions or the duty of companies not to pollute rivers on the same plane with tariffs. The accord requires both sides to fully enforce their labor and environmental laws so that companies cannot gain a trade advantage by ignoring them.</p>
        <p>The United States sells Jordan less than $300 million in goods each year -- approximately the value of two Boeing jumbo jets -- and Jordan sells this country far less. But the Clinton administration called the accord a new template for trade that, if implemented broadly by the next administration, has the potential to lower the political temperature on trade agreements and speed passage on Capitol Hill.</p>
        <p>But Republican lawmakers said that while they supported the idea of free trade with Jordan, trade agreements as a rule should deal with trade alone and should not be used as tools to advance a social agenda.</p>
        <p>The issue has resonated on the campaign trail. Vice President Al Gore, whose campaign depends heavily on labor support, has said that any future trade deals he negotiates as president will address workers and the environment. Gov. George W. Bush has said that he considers such issues impediments to free trade.</p>
        <p>The agreement, if passed by Congress, would make Jordan only the fourth nation to eliminate tariffs with the United States. The others are Mexico and Canada, partners with the United States in the North American Free Trade Agreement, and Israel.</p>
        <p>Jordan, which borders the West Bank and has a population that is half Palestinian, is considered an important player in the Middle East peace process. Clinton administration officials said they hoped the trade agreement would lift Jordan's stagnant economy.</p>
        <p>''By opening markets we can help ease poverty that makes peace hard to achieve and harder still to sustain,'' Mr. Clinton said this evening after the United States trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky, and Jordan's Deputy Prime Minister Mohammad Halayqah signed the pact.</p>
        <p>The Clinton administration has addressed the link between labor and environmental issues before. It negotiated side agreements to Nafta in which Mexico promised to protect workers and the environment.</p>
        <p>But labor unions and environmental groups fiercely opposed Nafta because they argued that Mexico had weak labor and environmental safeguards and that the side agreements did little to improve matters. The groups have also opposed Mr. Clinton's attempts to win ''fast track'' trade negotiating authority and the recent China trade accord.</p>
        <p>The Jordan agreement goes a step further because it addresses workers' rights as part of the text. The two nations reaffirmed their commitments under the International Labor Organization and promised not to lower standards to encourage trade. Any disagreements about labor practices could be addressed through a dispute settlement process and could potentially result in penalties. The provisions related to the environment are similar.</p>
        <p>''This is a basic and important step forward in making globalization work for working families,'' said John J. Sweeney, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. president. ''This agreement does not relegate workers' rights to second-class status.''</p>
        <p>The Sierra Club, the National Wildlife Federation and other environmental groups also praised the agreement.</p>
        <p>But several Republicans said they did not see the accord as a model, saying that most developing nations are steadfastly opposed to allowing the United States to dictate labor and environmental standards.</p>
        <p>''Any effort by the United States to determine standards for developing countries would make negotiations a nonstarter,'' said Bill Archer, Republican of Texas and chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. He said he feared the Jordan agreement was done for domestic political reasons.</p>
        <p>Mr. Archer said he supported the idea that a nation should enforce its own laws and not lower standards to gain a trade advantage, but said he would have to read the fine print before deciding if this agreement went beyond that principle. He said he did not like the concept that one side would have the right to apply sanctions if the other was seen as not doing enough to protect workers or the environment.</p>
        <p>Senator Charles E. Grassley, an Iowa Republican, said most lawmakers were likely to support the Jordan agreement because of the link to Middle East peace. But he cautioned that the precedent could be harmful.  ''If you favor free trade you can't leave developing countries out of the process, and developing countries don't like this,'' he said.</p>
