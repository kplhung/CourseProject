        <p>Coach Byron Scott of the Nets wanted to see the real Kenyon Martin -- the top overall pick in the 2000 draft, the consensus college player of the year -- and not, as Scott warned his rookie on Monday, ''his twin brother who plays real bad.''</p>
        <p>Scott saw double again tonight. But for the first time, at least it was reflected in the box score.</p>
        <p>Martin has been consistently inconsistent this preseason as he adjusts to the National Basketball Association. But he was different tonight during the Nets' fifth preseason game, a 90-81 loss to the Knicks in the other metropolitan rivalry in the area, albeit with a little less allure. For Martin it was important, however, to respond to his coach's criticism. He did so, in spurts, scoring 14 points and pulling down 11 rebounds in 33 minutes, his first double-double, as the Nets lost their fourth straight game.</p>
        <p>''He accepted the challenge, he came to play,'' Scott said. ''I was very pleased he went out after the ball and had a double-double. It's a stepping-stone for him.''</p>
        <p>Martin shot 6 for 9 from the field, but was quiet on the court in the final five minutes.</p>
        <p>Before a pro-Knicks crowd of 10,432 fans at the Continental Arena, Larry Johnson and Marcus Camby shut down the Nets in the stretch as the Knicks opened a 10-point lead with just under two minutes to play. Johnson led the Knicks with 18 points.</p>
        <p>On a night when Scott started a young lineup for the Nets -- Martin along with the rookie Stephon Jackson, 23-year-old point guard Stephon Marbury and 25-year-old center Evan Eschmeyer -- it was the 32-year-old Kendall Gill who excelled, leading all scorers with 24 points.</p>
        <p>Gill, the Nets' shooting guard who returned to the lineup after missing two games with a scratched cornea, was seeing double because of blurred vision. But he was able to focus on the basket long enough, making 9 of 17 from the floor. The Nets, however, shot only 40.5 percent for the game.</p>
        <p>Gill's return was a bright note on a night Martin was offering glimpses of the player the Nets thought they had drafted out of the University of Cincinnati last spring. Martin had six rebounds in 10 minutes in the first quarter, and scored the Nets' first basket, backing up Johnson and hitting an eight-foot jumper.</p>
        <p>But in the third quarter, Martin also had a key turnover that led to a flagrant foul on Charlie Ward's breakaway layup.</p>
        <p>''I played pretty decently,'' Martin said. ''It was not just what coach said, it's what I wanted to do.''</p>
        <p>With forward Keith Van Horn out for at least the next four weeks with a broken left fibula, Martin's immediate development becomes more urgent.</p>
        <p>''We've been very cautious with him, understanding he hasn't played basketball in six months,'' Scott said, referring to the broken leg Martin suffered in March. ''We've had to bring him along slowly,''</p>
        <p>REBOUNDS</p>
        <p>Nets guard LUCIOUS HARRIS was at practice Tuesday morning, shooting for the first time since hernia surgery on Oct. 5. He said he still feels tightness in his midsection, but began rehabilitation in the swimming pool this week and hopes to be back in ''no less than three weeks.'' Coach BYRON SCOTT of New Jersey was more cautiously optimistic, predicting Harris would return in four weeks. . . . MARCUS CAMBY, who missed Monday's practice with a lower back strain, started for the Knicks and recorded 14 points and 11 rebounds in 34 minutes. The Knicks were 10 for 18 (55.6 percent) on 3-point attempts.</p>
