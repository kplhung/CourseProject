        <p>John J. Sweeney, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., plans to meet several thousand union members early today in a parking lot in Tacoma, Wash., and lead a march on a relatively obscure and financially troubled company in the business of supplying temporary blue-collar workers.</p>
        <p>Since July, the Building and Construction Trades Department of Mr. Sweeney's union has been attacking the company, Labor Ready Inc., in the courts and through federal regulators, accusing it of mismanagement and taking advantage of the mainly unskilled laborers it hires to fill day-to-day jobs with building contractors, manufacturers, freight handlers, landscapers and others.</p>

        <p>John J. Sweeney, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., plans to meet several thousand union members early today in a parking lot in Tacoma, Wash., and lead a march on a relatively obscure and financially troubled company in the business of supplying temporary blue-collar workers.</p>
        <p>Since July, the Building and Construction Trades Department of Mr. Sweeney's union has been attacking the company, Labor Ready Inc., in the courts and through federal regulators, accusing it of mismanagement and taking advantage of the mainly unskilled laborers it hires to fill day-to-day jobs with building contractors, manufacturers, freight handlers, landscapers and others.</p>
        <p>Today, after Mr. Sweeney confronts senior executives at Labor Ready's annual meeting, aides to the labor leader plan to make public A.F.L.-C.I.O. research suggesting that the company has been cheating on its payments to workers' compensation systems in at least two states, Washington and Ohio.</p>
        <p>Dick King, who joined Labor Ready in mid-May and became chief executive in July, said if there had been any shortfalls in the company's workers' compensation payments, they were unintentional. ''We have no intention of being dishonest,'' he added.</p>
        <p>While financial analysts say they have been surprised at the force of the union campaign, it clearly reflects concern that Labor Ready and other suppliers of temporary workers have become a threat to the unions and their members. And there may be an element of anger and revenge as well. Terry O'Sullivan, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s Laborers' Union, said Labor Ready had sent temporary workers across picket lines in at least six strikes the last few years.</p>
        <p>While union ranks have been stagnating, temporary work has been growing by leaps and bounds. Labor Ready, a Tacoma company with operations nationwide, says revenue from the temporary worker industry is expected to reach $140 billion this year. Annual growth, according to the American Staffing Association, has been running at 18 percent, with 90 percent of American companies now using temporary workers.</p>
        <p>The union campaign has had a limited effect on Labor Ready, Mr. King said. But the company, which grew rapidly from its beginnings in 1989, has had plenty of trouble of its own. Largely because of a miscalculation that Labor Ready could do without a sales representative at each of its offices to attract new business, revenue growth began slowing in mid-1999; profits began declining as well. The company is now rebuilding its sales force. In July, the founder and chief executive, Glenn Welstad, was forced to resign after the board accused him of taking an unauthorized loan of $3.5 million to cover a margin call on his Labor Ready stock. The stock, which peaked at about $28 in mid-1999, closed yesterday at $3.94.</p>
        <p>Labor Ready says it is the top provider of manual laborers for temporary tasks, but it remains a niche player with revenue only now approaching $1 billion.</p>
        <p>Jeff Grabelsky, the organizing director of the Building and Construction Trades Department, said the A.F.L.-C.I.O. zeroed in on Labor Ready because its biggest segment was the construction business.</p>
        <p>''They are No. 1 in sending workers into our industry in ways that undermine the standards of the industry,'' Mr. Grabelsky said. ''What happens when we negotiate with union contractors, is, they say, 'We can't afford to pay union workers decent wages because nonunion contractors are going to win every job because of lower costs.' ''</p>
        <p>Union officials said their members working as laborers were paid $15 an hour plus benefits. Mr. King said Labor Ready supplied laborers for $11 an hour and last year paid workers an average of $6.94 an hour. It also pays for their workers' compensation coverage, Social Security and Medicare contributions but makes no provision for current health care and has no pension fund.</p>
        <p>The A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s goal, Mr. Grabelsky said, ''is to unionize the workers'' of the temporary agencies. But Wayne Lottinville, an analyst for Red Chip Review in Portland, Ore.,  said the Labor Ready employees might be among ''the hardest population or workers to organize.''</p>
        <p>''They are at the very low end of the unskilled labor market,'' he said. Referring to the company by its New York Stock Exchange symbol LRW, Mr. Lottinville said: ''If you can dig a ditch and need a little cash, LRW has a job for you.''</p>
        <p>Several analysts said they had been contacted by the union about Labor Ready. ''They told me they're fighting for the workers,'' said Jeanne M. Ernst, an analyst for First Security Van Kasper in San Francisco. ''But I don't see that these workers are being mistreated.''</p>
        <p>Officials in Washington and Ohio said yesterday that, after hearing from the A.F.L.-C.I.O., they were auditing Labor Ready's workers' compensation payments. But in Ohio, Jim Samuel, the spokesman for the Bureau of Workers Compensation, said ''no red flags jumped out'' immediately.</p>
        <p>The A.F.L.-C.I.O. first moved against Labor Ready in July. Based on A.F.L.-C.I.O. research, two former employees accused Labor Ready in a suit in Georgia of charging workers an average of $1.50 to withdraw their daily pay from cash dispensing machines. Similar suits were later filed in New York and California.</p>
        <p>Analysts said they doubted the suits would succeed because using the cash machines is not mandatory; workers can choose to get their pay in a check or in cash from a machine.</p>
        <p>The A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s Building and Construction Trades Department, which owns 515 shares of Labor Ready stock, has also peppered the company with letters about management decisions and potential liabilities and then broadcast its queries in news releases.</p>
        <p>In one line of questioning, followed by a suit that was quickly dismissed, the union demanded that Labor Ready set a date for its annual meeting, which was not held as usual in August. But Mr. King said that before the letter arrived and the suit was filed, the Labor Ready board had already scheduled the annual board meeting for today.</p>
