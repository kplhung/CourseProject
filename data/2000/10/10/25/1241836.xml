        <p>THERE is a growing perception that the Yankees are a dynasty in decline.</p>
        <p>Last night's 4-2 loss in Game 3 gives credence to the perception, and the Yankees front office is not disputing it. They just say ''decline'' with an asterisk.</p>
        <p>Before Game 3, Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman conceded that there is the appearance of slippage.</p>
        <p>''I know that's what people are talking about,'' Cashman said. ''The perception is that this team is getting older and it's starting to wind its way down. There's a lot of talk about: 'This is the old champion fighting it out one more time.'</p>
        <p>''I think that's a fair assessment. But that doesn't change the fact that we believe that we have one more fight left in us.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees let the Mets back into that fight last night. They still lead the Subway Series, two games to one, but the momentum is shifting to Flushing.</p>
        <p>Last night, the Mets were held in check by Orlando Hernandez until they finally wore him down in typical Mets fashion.</p>
        <p>Regardless of what happens in the Series, after this season the Yankees will once again remake themselves. The franchise, with resources and an apparatus for mining talent, is an ocean with its own flow, its own current, its own way of replenishing itself.</p>
        <p>El Duque symbolizes the changes of a franchise that reinvents itself from one decade to the next.</p>
        <p>In 1997, Hernandez was on a boat defecting from Cuba. Three years later, he is the ace of the Yankees staff, drenched in Yankees pinstripes and Yankees lore.</p>
        <p>The Yankees have remade themselves in short spurts: from 1996 to 1998, then 1998 to 2000. Cashman, the 33-year-old general manager, has engineered at least three Yankees transitions, making crucial personnel decisions along the way.</p>
        <p>David Cone, who went to the Yankees in a trade in 1995, pitched a perfect game 15 months ago; he was recently relegated to the bullpen in favor of Denny Neagle. Ricky Ledee, the promising young outfielder, was traded for David Justice.</p>
        <p>In May 1998, the fun-loving David Wells pitched a perfect game for the Yankees. Nine months later, he  was shipped to Toronto for Roger Clemens, and the franchise assumed another brass-knuckles identity.</p>
        <p>So the questions persist, even as the Yankees try for a 26th world championship: who will the Yankees be in 2001? What will become of Cone? Will the Yankees stick with Paul O'Neill and Tino Martinez for one more season?</p>
        <p>Cashman thinks about holes and how to fill them all day, all night, but he doesn't want to talk about his business. Nevertheless, you can see a sliver of the metamorphosis already in motion. Chuck Knoblauch, the second baseman for the past three seasons, is apparently giving way to Jose Vizcaino.</p>
        <p>In 1998, Cashman became the second-youngest general manager in baseball when he was appointed at age 30. His movement through the organization is a behind-the-scenes microcosm of the team's metamorphosis. He worked for no fewer than seven different general managers, most of whom burned and crashed in the process of contending with George M. Steinbrenner III, the Yankees' principal owner. Steinbrenner has seen generations of managers come and go, from Billy Martin to Buck Showalter.</p>
        <p>Cashman joined the Yankees in 1986 as an intern. Three years later, he became a full-time assistant in baseball operations. He was promoted to assistant general manager for baseball operations, and in 1992 he became the assistant general manager for baseball administration. He has seen enough of the Yankees' evolution to know that what you see is not only what you get, but is temporary at best.</p>
        <p>''Every winter is tough,'' he said. ''I have sleepless nights and wrestle over decisions. It seems like every winter there's a position or two or more on that field that you have to make a very tough choice on. Decisions that, until the season plays out the next year, you're not going to know the outcome, but they're agonizing.''</p>
        <p>In 1995, the Yankees let Showalter go, as well as Don Mattingly, Randy Velarde and Mike Stanley. They had to decide between Cone and Jack McDowell and chose Cone.</p>
        <p>After the 1996 championship, the Yankees made the tough decision to let their closer, John Wetteland, go and commit to Rivera in that role. After the 1998 season, the burning questions were whether to keep Bernie Williams, and re-sign Scott Brosius and Cone. Then, last year, the Yankees decided to let the popular Joe Girardi go and turn the full-time catching duties over to Jorge Posada; they decided to give Cone a one-year, $12 million contract.</p>
        <p>Now the Yankees, win or lose, are faced with another compelling makeover. ''We're not going to look at our situation and say, 'Well, we're going to take a step back and rebuild,' '' Cashman said yesterday, with just the slightest hint of attitude.</p>
        <p>There's no rebuilding with the Yankees. ''We're not going to take a step back,'' he said. ''We're going to have a meeting in the winter, try to put this thing together again and go for the jugular in 2001.''</p>
