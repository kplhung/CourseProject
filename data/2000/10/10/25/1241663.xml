        <p>Zagat Adds Cozy Spots</p>
        <p>Zagat released its 2001 New York Restaurant Survey today, its 22d edition. Alain Ducasse is listed, but as too new to be rated. The restaurants rated as the most popular are unchanged at the top of the list, headed by Union Square Cafe, Gramercy Tavern and Gotham Bar &amp; Grill. As respondents continue to complain about service, the survey has added a category of places that ''make you feel at home.'' They range from the Four Seasons and Rao's to ONEc.p.s., open six weeks.</p>

        <p>Zagat Adds Cozy Spots</p>
        <p>Zagat released its 2001 New York Restaurant Survey today, its 22d edition. Alain Ducasse is listed, but as too new to be rated. The restaurants rated as the most popular are unchanged at the top of the list, headed by Union Square Cafe, Gramercy Tavern and Gotham Bar &amp; Grill. As respondents continue to complain about service, the survey has added a category of places that ''make you feel at home.'' They range from the Four Seasons and Rao's to ONEc.p.s., open six weeks.</p>
        <p>Staking Out a Name</p>
        <p>With so many restaurants opening it was inevitable that some would bump into each other when selecting a name. The new owners of what was Astor at 316 Bowery (Bleecker Street) wanted to call the place Eatery but were trumped by a spot on Ninth Avenue. So the restaurant became City Eatery. Azucar, a tapas spot at 462 Amsterdam Avenue (82nd Street) did not keep its name for long. It became Sabor because there was a New Jersey Azucar.</p>
        <p>Other names are being recycled. Man Ray was a popular French bistro in Chelsea, but in January the name will go to a new spot at 147 West 15th Street. And Campo, which was what Stephen Picker called his Greenwich Village restaurant before he changed the name to Good, is now the name of a small Latino spot on Amsterdam Avenue and 84th Street.</p>
        <p>Concourse Cuisine</p>
        <p>The dining options at La Guardia have just improved with the opening of Todd English's Figs cafe. While waiting for your boarding call, you can order fig and prosciutto flatbread pizza, pastas and panini.</p>
        <p>Proud Packets</p>
        <p>Among the more clever promotions celebrating restaurant milestones is that for Sono's first, or paper, anniversary. The restaurant, at 106 East 57th Street, has a $57 four-course menu this week featuring foods in ''paper'': shrimp and avocado in rice paper, foie gras napoleon in phyllo, Mediterranean sea bass en papillote and a chocolate origami swan.</p>
