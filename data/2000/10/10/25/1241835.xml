        <p>Some fans may overlook Paul O'Neill's performance last night because his Yankees lost by 4-2 to the Mets in Game 3 of the World Series at Shea Stadium. But it is a sure thing that the Mets pitchers paid attention.</p>
        <p>O'Neill, slumping late in the regular season and early in the playoffs, had three hits in four at-bats last night and knocked in one run. He had a single, a double and a triple. Over all, he is 7 for 12 in the Series, which resumes tonight with the Yankees holding a two-games-to-one lead in the four-of-seven-game series.</p>

        <p>Some fans may overlook Paul O'Neill's performance last night because his Yankees lost by 4-2 to the Mets in Game 3 of the World Series at Shea Stadium. But it is a sure thing that the Mets pitchers paid attention.</p>
        <p>O'Neill, slumping late in the regular season and early in the playoffs, had three hits in four at-bats last night and knocked in one run. He had a single, a double and a triple. Over all, he is 7 for 12 in the Series, which resumes tonight with the Yankees holding a two-games-to-one lead in the four-of-seven-game series.</p>
        <p>''It doesn't matter,'' O'Neill said of his personal statistics. ''The only thing that matters in the playoffs is when you win. Sure, when you're playing the game, it's fun to be part of the game. But the bottom line in the playoffs is whether you win or lose.''</p>
        <p>That is from a team perspective. From a personal perspective, O'Neill's bottom line, his statistics, could determine a great deal about his future. At the age of 37, O'Neill's Yankees contract is coming to an end. He will be a free agent this winter.</p>
        <p>Earlier in the playoffs, Manager Joe Torre pulled him for pinch-hitters. Perhaps hobbled by injuries, O'Neill seemed uncertain at the plate and less than his best while playing right field. Torre demoted him to the seventh spot in the batting order. The fans at Yankee Stadium, who have cheered him for years, have recently been giving him warm ovations when he comes to the plate. Perhaps some of them might be saying thank you and goodbye, just in case.</p>
        <p>But O'Neill's performance has perked up considerably lately. Should he choose to continue playing, he might get another contract, if not from the Yankees, then from someone else. But this did not seem to be a good subject to bring up after last night's game. He brushed aside all questions about himself and urged reporters to go to the interview room to talk to the Mets, who won the game.</p>
        <p>When asked how much he would like to see O'Neill return in 2001, Torre said: ''O'Neill possibly wants to come back. And certainly, he would be missed if he wasn't here.''</p>
        <p>O'Neill also said he was irked that the Yankees did not capitalize on another marvelous pitching performance by Orlando Hernandez, who lost the first game of his postseason career despite pitching well. He retired three hitters with the bases loaded in the sixth inning after giving up the tying run.</p>
        <p>''He was awesome,'' O'Neill said of Hernandez. ''Getting out of a bases-loaded jam like that should win it for him. It didn't. He's a great big-game pitcher. He finds a way.''</p>
        <p>Regarding the Series in general, O'Neill noted that every game has been close and that the Yankees, the two-time defending champions, are not overconfident against the Mets, the National League wild-card team that went on to win the pennant.</p>
        <p>''Every game has been close, it could have gone either way,'' O'Neill said. ''This was no different, and I expect the next one will be no different. We don't assume we're just going to take the field and win. We're playing a good team. We know that right now we're up in the Series, but tomorrow is a big game for both teams.''</p>
        <p>Before this year, O'Neill had played 17 World Series games in his career. In those games, he had batted .172 with 10 hits in 58 at-bats.</p>
