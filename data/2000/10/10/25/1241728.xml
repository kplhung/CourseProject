        <p>IN announcing its second-quarter earnings yesterday, Computer Associates posted some big numbers.</p>
        <p>The company, which makes the software used by many big companies to manage their computer systems, reported profit of $321 million, before amortization charges, on revenue of $1.55 billion. Profit was down 23 percent, but sales rose 5.4 percent.</p>
        <p>Luckily for Computer Associates, which is based in Islandia, N.Y., its earnings report lacked a place for it to disclose another important number. That would be the company's credibility with investors and analysts, which hovers near zero after years of missteps.</p>
        <p>Computer Associates has been an off-and-on target of short sellers for more than a decade, but its problems began in earnest in May 1998, when it gave three of its top executives a $1 billion stock grant, becoming a symbol of management greed to many investors. The award was tied to the performance of the company's stock, so investors felt doubly bruised when the company announced a big sales shortfall one month later, sending its shares down 31 percent. A judge later ordered the executives to return shares worth nearly $558 million because the plan did not contain a clause stipulating that the number of shares would be adjusted in case of stock splits. During an appeal, company officials and lawyers agreed to settle the case for the return of shares worth $234 million.</p>
        <p>Earlier this year, Computer Associates announced another shortfall. This time, the bad news came just before midnight on Monday, July 3, when many analysts were on vacation, leaving investors to wonder whether the company hoped its announcement would go unnoticed. If that was the company's plan, it failed. When markets opened for trading on July 5, the company's stock fell nearly 40 percent, costing investors about $12 billion.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the Center for Financial Research and Analysis in Maryland, which examines corporate balance sheets and income statements for signs of problems, warned in a report in June that Computer Associates might be using accounting gimmicks to overstate its earnings and growth rate. The company may also have shifted receivables off its books to make its balance sheet look healthier, according to the center.</p>
        <p>The company has refused to respond specifically to any of the issues raised in the report.</p>
        <p>''I think investors tend to be somewhat wary of C.A.,'' said Peter Goldmacher, a software analyst for Merrill Lynch, who has a ''hold'' rating on shares of Computer Associates. He is not alone. Ten of the 28 analysts who follow the company rate it as a ''hold,'' while two rate it as a ''sell,'' which is highly unusual. Even bulls acknowledge that Computer Associates' management has hurt its stock.</p>
        <p>''Management credibility has always been an issue,'' said Melissa Eisenstat of CIBC World Markets, who rates the company a ''buy.'' Based on expected earnings for its 2001 fiscal year, which ends in March, Computer Associates trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of only 10, far below average for a technology company. Shares of the company rose $1.06 yesterday, to $26.69, about its level five years ago.</p>
        <p>So it might seem to be in Computer Associates' interest to clear up questions about an unusual transaction in September 1998 that may have increased its reported profits for the 1999 fiscal year by as much as $74 million. But the company apparently disagrees.</p>
        <p>The deal is mentioned in a criminal fraud case brought against top executives of the former HBO &amp; Company by the United States attorney for the Northern District of California. The executives are accused of pumping up HBO's stock by inflating the company's reported results. Computer Associates has not been accused of any wrongdoing. Under the deal, according to the indictment in the case, Computer Associates bought $30 million in software from HBO, a Georgia-based company that makes software used to run hospitals. The software was supposedly for resale. In return, HBO, which approached Computer Associates about the deal, bought $73.8 million in software from Computer Associates.</p>
        <p>On its face, the agreement is odd. Both Computer Associates and HBO, which has since merged with McKesson, a drug wholesaler in San Francisco, were primarily in the business of selling their own software, not reselling software developed by other companies.</p>
        <p>In addition, though the two companies were both in the software business, they made very different products. Computer Associates develops enterprise management software used mainly to make sure that other kinds of software work together efficiently, while HBO made specialized medical billing and records software used mainly in big hospitals.</p>
        <p>Michael Murphy, editor of the California Technology Stock Letter, said he could not understand why Computer Associates, which has 5,600 sales people of its own, would turn HBO into a potential competitor by giving it the right to sell its software. ''That doesn't make any sense to me at all, frankly,'' said Mr. Murphy, who has neither a short nor a long position in the company. ''That starts to smell.''</p>
        <p>Computer Associates neither used nor sold any of the $30 million in software that it bought from HBO, according to the indictment, and HBO used only a tiny fraction of the software it bought from Computer Associates. It is unclear when Computer Associates recorded revenue from the HBO sale or how much revenue and profit it recorded. It is also unclear whether Computer Associates has ever written off the software it bought from HBO or whether the company continues to hold it as an asset on its balance sheet.</p>
        <p>Considering the deal may have represented as much as 1.6 percent of Computer Associates' sales and 6 percent of its profits for the 1999 fiscal year, those questions seem worth answering.</p>
        <p>But not to Computer Associates. Asked to explain the deal, the company responded in a statement: ''Both McKesson Corp. and HBOC licensed and used C.A. software prior to the one transaction referenced in the indictment. The combined company continues to use C.A. software internally in its operations. C.A. cooperated fully with authorities in their investigation of this matter.''</p>
        <p>Answers like that will not close Computer Associates' credibility gap.</p>
