        <p>American naval officials said today that the destroyer Cole, at the moment of the bombing that killed 17 sailors, was at a medium-level alert, no different from that routinely in force in the Persian Gulf, despite the violence in Israel and a general warning of a possible terrorist attack on an American warship.</p>
        <p>The alert level meant there were only a handful of sailors with rifles mounting a watch on deck as the Cole entered Aden harbor, the officials said. There were no sailors manning the ship's machine guns or cannons, and no American or Yemeni boats guarding the waters around the billion-dollar ship as a flotilla of service boats moved in to assist with mooring and refueling.</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>American naval officials said today that the destroyer Cole, at the moment of the bombing that killed 17 sailors, was at a medium-level alert, no different from that routinely in force in the Persian Gulf, despite the violence in Israel and a general warning of a possible terrorist attack on an American warship.</p>
        <p>The alert level meant there were only a handful of sailors with rifles mounting a watch on deck as the Cole entered Aden harbor, the officials said. There were no sailors manning the ship's machine guns or cannons, and no American or Yemeni boats guarding the waters around the billion-dollar ship as a flotilla of service boats moved in to assist with mooring and refueling.</p>
        <p>The Navy's account, given at a briefing here today, was the most detailed so far of the security arrangements in effect on Oct. 12 when two men in a small fiberglass boat slid alongside the Cole and detonated a cargo of high explosives that blew a 40-by-40-foot hole in the hull.</p>
        <p>American officials have said the Federal Bureau of Investigation has a ''working theory'' that the attack was carried out by Islamic militants who have repeatedly attacked American targets as part of a holy war against the United States, possibly inspired or directed by Osama bin Laden, an exiled Saudi financier who tops the F.B.I.'s most-wanted list.</p>
        <p>In a fresh revelation today, Yemeni security officials confirmed that they had found a house overlooking the Aden harbor from which the conspirators appeared to have monitored previous Navy ships entering Aden for refueling and possibly watched and directed the attack.</p>
        <p>The Yemenis said investigators had found a pair of binoculars in the house, and that with these, conspirators would have been able to keep a moment-by-moment watch on the area where the Cole was moored.</p>
        <p>The officials said the house, at least the fifth one in the Aden area now identified by investigators as having been used in the attack, was empty when it was raided last weekend. F.B.I. experts are examining it, using fingerprinting, DNA tests and other evidence-gathering techniques.</p>
        <p>The latest information appeared likely to reinforce the F.B.I.'s conclusion that the attack involved more than the two suicide bombers, that they spent weeks and possibly months preparing the attack, and that they were amply financed and technically sophisticated.</p>
        <p>The details disclosed today about the alert level on the Cole added significantly to what the Navy had previously disclosed. The risk status in effect, known as Bravo, is the second lowest on an ascending scale; the lowest level is Alpha, and the scale ascends through Bravo, Charlie and Delta.</p>
        <p>From the outset, Navy officials had said that the Cole was at Bravo level. But the officer commanding the Navy-led force assisting the investigation, Rear Adm. Mark Fitzgerald, had first described this as the second-highest risk status, instead of the second lowest.</p>
        <p>Because Admiral Fitzgerald made this observation while saying any American ship in the region knew it was operating in ''a dangerous area,'' this seems to have been an inadvertent slip made under the pressure of dealing with the attack's aftermath.</p>
        <p>Today Cmdr. Hal Pittman, a spokesman for the Fifth Fleet, which directs operations in the Persian Gulf area, attempted to place the facts surrounding the Cole attack in a wider perspective, rather than revising the earlier version.</p>
        <p>From the facts given by Commander Pittman and what is now suspected about how the attack was carried out, it is still not clear that a higher alert level would have foiled the attack. Indeed, a senior Pentagon official said the little skiff would not have been perceived as a threat. In any alert status of Bravo or higher, the Cole's guards would have been authorized to open fire if it was clear an attack was under way.</p>
        <p>The Pentagon official said the Cole's captain reported that the crew believed the skiff was part of the flotilla of harbor boats helping the destroyer moor.</p>
        <p>''In order to exercise deadly force, you have to perceive a deadly threat,'' the official said. ''The questions of whether they were right not to have perceived it as a threat will all be part of the investigation.''</p>
        <p>Today the Cole, listing and low in the water, was on a Delta alert, and looking at it from shore suggested that this made it much less vulnerable than when it was attacked.</p>
        <p>Under awnings erected on the bow and tern, crew members were in position near machine guns and cannons, and a large inflatable picket boat, about 60 feet long and carrying two machine guns of its own, patrolled with about 15 sailors in helmets and flak jackets, back and forth along the Cole's port flank about 300 yards of the ship.</p>
        <p>Delta alerts are currently in effect for American troops and officials in Bahrain and Qatar, in the Persian Gulf, because of threats of another attack, according to Adm. Craig Quigley, a Pentagon spokesman.</p>
        <p>Navy officials have said they did not cancel the Cole's refueling stop in Aden because there had been no ''credible and specific'' threat to the vessel of the kind necessary to enforce a Delta alert. The ship's fuel tanks were still 50 percent full.</p>
        <p>The Navy has also played down the significance of two stark warnings that military and intelligence officials heard before the attack here.</p>
        <p>The first, on Sept. 22, came in a videotape apparently made by Mr. bin Laden in his hideout in Afghanistan and delivered to Al Jazera Television in Qatar, a satellite station that Mr. bin Laden has chosen before as a conduit.</p>
        <p>On the tape Mr. bin Laden, wearing a dagger in his belt in a tribal tradition widely favored in Yemen, where his family originated, vowed to free an Egyptian Islamic leader, Sheik Omar Abdul Rahman, who was jailed for life after being convicted in New York of ordering the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center.</p>
        <p>Mr. bin Laden, accompanied by two Egyptian militants who are thought to be among his closest aides and by Assad Allah, Sheik Rahman's son, vowed new attacks on the United States to achieve the sheik's release.</p>
        <p>''Enough of words!'' he said. ''It is time to take action against this iniquitous and faithless force that has spread troops through Egypt, Yemen and Saudi Arabia.'' Assad Allah could be heard saying ''Forward to shed blood!'' three times.</p>
        <p>Officials in Washington have said another warning, of an impending Islamic attack on an American warship, was also received in the weeks before the Cole attack, but that risk levels were not raised because the warning did not say what kind of ship would be hit, where or when.</p>
        <p>With more than 300 ships around the globe, Navy officials here have said, this was too unspecific to have served as a basis for changing threat levels in the Persian Gulf area, despite the upsurge of passion in the Arab world after the violent clashes in Israel and the Palestinian lands.</p>
