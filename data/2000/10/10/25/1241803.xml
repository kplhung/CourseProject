        <p>President Clinton is missing an opportunity to promote breast and cervical cancer awareness, Representative Rick A. Lazio said today, by deciding to privately sign a bill that Mr. Lazio had backed.</p>
        <p>Speaking to reporters here before touring a breast cancer screening center at a hospital, Mr. Lazio said he believed politics might have influenced the White House's decision not to hold a public bill-signing ceremony.</p>
        <p>''I think it's a missed opportunity for the president,'' Mr. Lazio said, standing before a poster promoting breast cancer awareness month. ''I don't have to be there at the bill signing if he feels it's not a politically wise thing for him to do. But it is an opportunity for us to promote breast cancer awareness and cervical cancer awareness.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio, however, said he believed the priority should be for the president to sign the bill, the Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment Act, into law. The president did sign the bill sometime today, doing so without ceremony or even a simple announcement by the White House.</p>
        <p>The congressman was a leading advocate for the bill as chief sponsor of the original legislation and manager of the debate in the House that led to its approval in May, although Democrats complained that he had lost interest until he surfaced as a Senate candidate that month. Mrs. Clinton, the president said, was also  a major advocate for the bill, which authorizes states to provide Medicaid coverage to low-income women whose breast and cervical cancer is diagnosed in free screenings set up under a 1990 law.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton, after speaking on the upstate economy in Syracuse, said today that she was not aware of a decision by the White House to forgo a public ceremony.</p>
        <p>''I didn't know about the decision until I read about it,'' Mrs. Clinton told reporters. ''The president signs hundreds of bills and they make those decisions. I was also actively involved on behalf of that legislation.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio has championed his role in the legislation as he seeks to court women.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio started the day with a ''Women for Lazio'' event at a convention hall in Syracuse that drew 1,300 women, who paid $20 each to dine on quiche and listen to Mr. Lazio deliver his stump speech for about 45 minutes. In the works for about three weeks, the event produced one of the largest turnouts at any of his campaign events, and Mr. Lazio and his advisers said the size of the audience was a sign of momentum.</p>
        <p>''For me, this is a great kickoff for the last two weeks of the campaign,'' Mr. Lazio told the audience members, who among the usual bumper stickers and fliers also received nail files with Mr. Lazio's campaign logo on them. ''To all the people who talk about a gender gap,'' he added to laughs and applause, ''I wish you would please tell your male friends to make sure they're supporting me, would you?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio then flew to Buffalo for a campaign stop similar to one Monday in which he deplored Mrs. Clinton's 1993-94 attempt to remake the health care system.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio does not have a health care plan of his own but favors passing legislation that would provide tax credits to help people pay for their own insurance. Mrs. Clinton released new radio ads in upstate markets to counter ads Mr. Lazio is running there criticizing her health care proposal.</p>
        <p>After his event here, he met his obligations as a Mets fan and attended the third game of the World Series at Shea Stadium. Even this was a campaign event; he rode the No. 7 subway to the game with Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Gov. George E. Pataki -- in the front car with the Mets logo painted on the front. At the game, his campaign aides handed out masks made from a blown-up picture of Mrs. Clinton wearing a Yankee cap as a way to mock her claim to be a Yankee fan.</p>
        <p>Traveling in Syracuse and Rochester today, Mrs. Clinton kept a focus on the upstate economy, criticizing Mr. Lazio for what she has said has been his insensitivity to economic troubles upstate. She said her plan for the region would provide lower utility costs, tax incentives and business partnerships with the state and federal government to create jobs.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton, speaking to about 75 people at a community college in Syracuse about an hour after Mr. Lazio left, stood before a large poster that highlighted population losses upstate.</p>
        <p>''We've lost all this population in the last 10 years,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ''We've kind of gotten ourselves into a bind because, among the people who have left, are young people who are seeking their fortunes elsewhere. We don't have the work force with the skills we need to attract, in a critical mass, some of the new economy, information technology jobs that I think upstate is natural for.''</p>
