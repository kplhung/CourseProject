        <p>A daylong suspense drama played itself outside the ticket window at Shea Stadium. By 9 a.m., a handful of the faithful had gathered in hope of grabbing tickets, some of them good ones, made available by last-minute cancellations. By 9:30, the handful had grown to a couple of dozen.</p>

        <p>A daylong suspense drama played itself outside the ticket window at Shea Stadium. By 9 a.m., a handful of the faithful had gathered in hope of grabbing tickets, some of them good ones, made available by last-minute cancellations. By 9:30, the handful had grown to a couple of dozen.</p>
        <p>''We should form a line,'' one of the first arrivals, a lumpy guy in a Mets jacket over a Jets jersey, kept repeating worriedly.</p>
        <p>The stadium worker begged for order. ''There are enough tickets for everyone who's here right now, so just relax,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In the jockeying, the Mets-Jets guy had fallen back a few places in line. So had Nancy Lindeberg, 52, an actress who had arrived early, too.</p>
        <p>The stadium worker was wrong. After about 10 people had gotten tickets, the man two spots in front of Ms. Lindeberg came back from the window empty-handed.</p>
        <p>''That's all we have right now,'' the worker said. ''There may be more in 20 minutes, or there may be no more all day. You can take your chances.'' Morning dragged into afternoon, and not one ticket was offered. But Ms. Lindeberg was cheerfully fatalistic about being cheated of her chance at the holy grail.</p>
        <p>''Once I got here and saw the line was jumbled, I figured that however the line formed that's where I'd end up,'' she said. She was willing to wait all day. At 12:45 p.m., much to the relief of the crowd, which was now about 100 people long, the Mets brought out a portable toilet.</p>
        <p>At 2 o'clock, the Mets-Jets guy went to move his car and never returned. At 2:34, the ticket window reopened.</p>
        <p>Ms. Lindeberg scored a pair of loge seats just past first base for herself and her friend Cynthia. She said she had never had a doubt.</p>
        <p>''I just had this feeling,'' she said, grinning behind her sunglasses. ''My friend Cynthia tells me I have good ticket mojo. I think she's right.''</p>
