        <p>Bobby J. Jones starts Game 4 for the Mets tonight in what he understandably described yesterday as ''one of the most important games of my life.''</p>
        <p>Back in June, Jones had one of the poorer games of his career, and it came against the Yankees. In that game, he allowed seven runs in four and two-thirds innings to raise his earned run average to 10.19 for the season and raise questions about just how much he had left as a pitcher after a 1999 season in which he was sidelined much of the time with arm trouble.</p>
        <p>Following that Yankee blowout, Jones accepted a minor league assignment to work on his repertoire, and several weeks later he came back a changed pitcher.</p>
        <p>When he faced the Yankees again in July, he held them to three runs in seven innings, although he again took the loss.</p>
        <p>In the postseason, Jones had a remarkable one-hit shutout in the clinching victory over the Giants in Game 4 of the division series, perhaps the best game he has ever pitched for the Mets in his eight seasons with the team, the only one he has pitched for in the major leagues.</p>
        <p>But Jones allowed six runs in four innings to the Cardinals in Game 4 of the National League Championship Series, a game that the Mets won despite Jones's ineffective work. The Cardinals were tough on right-handers all season long, and Jones wasn't able to buck that trend. Tonight, the Mets hope Jones will pick up where he left off against the Giants, or at least be as effective as a fellow right-hander, Rick Reed, was in Game 3.</p>
