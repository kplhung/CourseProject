        <p>Seeking to avoid a pre-election confrontation with President Clinton, Congressional Republicans agreed today to remove legal restrictions inhibiting private family planning groups that receive federal funds from spending their own money to provide abortions or promote abortion rights in foreign countries.</p>
        <p>The negotiators agreed to increase the money going to such family planning groups, but they also made sure that the money could not be used before next Feb. 15 -- after the next president takes office.</p>
        <p>Abortion opponents are hoping that if Gov. George W. Bush wins the presidency, he will reinstate the restrictions.</p>
        <p>Abortion-rights advocates anticipate that should Vice President Al Gore win, he will do nothing, letting stand today's action removing the limitations.</p>
        <p>''Everybody's betting on the election,'' said Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the ranking Democrat on the Subcommittee on Foreign Operations of the House Appropriations Committee.</p>
        <p>Representative Nita M. Lowey, Democrat of New York, said: ''This is a great victory for women and democracy around the world.''</p>
        <p>''It also points up how critical this election is,'' Ms. Lowey said. ''For those who support family planning, it is absolutely essential that we elect Al Gore. And for those who would destroy family planning, then George Bush should be their person.''</p>
        <p>Ray Sullivan, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, would not speculate on whether Mr. Bush would reinstate the restrictions if he is elected. But as a matter of principle, Mr. Sullivan added, ''Governor Bush does not favor using federal funds for abortion or abortion-related counseling at home or abroad.''</p>
        <p>The agreement was reached in House-Senate negotiations on a $14.9 billion spending bill that covered foreign aid. In those negotiations, Republicans also agreed to allocate as much as $425 million to international family planning groups, up from the $385 million that is currently provided.</p>
        <p>President Clinton had vowed to veto the spending bill if the restrictions on family planning groups remained, but the agreement leaves it up to the next president to decide, through executive order, whether to spend the money or continue the limits on abortion-related activities of family planning groups that operate in foreign countries.</p>
        <p>Today's action must still be approved by the House, which will vote on the foreign aid bill on Wednesday, and by the Senate. Passage in the Senate is somewhat more problematical since the measure contained an amendment raising the ceiling that Congress could approve for discretionary spending to $637 billion, from the current $600 billion. Because of that provision, the measure must garner 60 votes in the Senate, rather than a simply majority.</p>
        <p>The restrictions have been a major ideological battle between abortion opponents and those who favor abortion rights.</p>
        <p>They were first imposed during the Reagan administration and often are known as the Mexico City limitations because it was during a 1984 international family planning conference in the Mexican capital in that the Reagan administration announced the policy.</p>
        <p>One of Mr. Clinton's first acts after taking office in 1993 was to sign an executive order removing the restrictions. But last year, the president in return for a commitment by Republican leaders to begin to pay off the United States arrears to the United Nations, agreed to a law that reinstated the restrictions, but gave the president the power to waive them.</p>
        <p>Under the law, groups receiving American funds had to certify that they were not using their own money to provide abortions or to lobby foreign governments on abortion policy.</p>
        <p>Any group that refused to adhere to this policy could still receive American aid if the president issued a waiver.</p>
        <p>But once the president waived the restriction, which Mr. Clinton did, the amount of money to be allocated to international family planning groups was reduced by $12.5 million. Also the total amount of money for groups that did not agree to the restrictions was $15 million.</p>
        <p>According to the Agency for International Development, which disburses American foreign aid funds, 448 organizations engaged in family planning activities overseas agreed to the limitations as of August. Nine organizations, however, refused to abide by the limitations.</p>
        <p>Today's action did not affect current law that bans the use of American funds for any abortions in foreign countries.</p>
        <p>Abortion rights advocates were clearly buoyed by the action, though they did their best not to gloat since it was still unclear whether they had the political muscle to push the agreement through, especially in the Senate.</p>
        <p>And abortion opponents were strangely quiet. Representative Christopher H. Smith, Republican of New Jersey and the leader in the fight to keep the restrictions, ignored several efforts to solicit a comment on today's action.</p>
        <p>The foreign operations bill, generally one of the most hotly debated of the annual spending bills that are needed to finance the government, also provides $435 million to help impoverished countries reduce their debt and $300 million to help stem the H.I.V. epidemic in Africa.</p>
        <p>Both are significant increases in the amount of money the United States currently spends in this area.</p>
