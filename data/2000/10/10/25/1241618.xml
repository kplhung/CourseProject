        <p>TRY to buy a toy on the Internet, and it is shocking what you find: violent battles, shotgun marriages, painful excess, sudden death.</p>
        <p>The latest video game or action figure? Hardly. Just the stories of the online toy stores themselves.</p>
        <p>Millions of people bought toys during the last holiday season from about a dozen online toy stores that were aggressively courting their business with advertising and stockings full of discount coupons. But the aftermath of that indulgence is a wasteland that would make any Grinch proud.</p>
        <p>Some companies, like the Walt Disney-backed Toysmart.com, have simply closed. Amazon.com wrote off millions of dollars from toys it could not sell. Toysrus.com had to send $100 gift certificates by overnight express to thousands of customers because it could not deliver their orders by Christmas. Even eToys.com, the top toy seller online last year, has seen its stock fall by 90 percent this year.</p>
        <p>''A year ago, we had wild ambitions to do as much business as possible so we could raise as much as we could from Wall Street,'' said Michael Glazer, the chief executive of KB Toys, the No. 2 chain of toy stores. KB and its parent, Consolidated Stores, had looked enviously at Internet stock prices, like, well, a child in a toy store, hoping to take its KBKids.com unit public. But after spending $50 million in advertising last Christmas season, only to bring in sales half that amount, KB is returning to basics.</p>
        <p>''We've started to run KBKids as a real business,'' Mr. Glazer said. ''Now we need to make a profit.'' So this year, the only promotion will be tag-alongs on the store's ads.</p>
        <p>An even greater sign of how little fun there is in the toy business came in August when Amazon and Toysrus.com combined their online toy stores. That way, Toysrus .com does not have to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to build a Web site and warehouses that run at peak capacity for only one month a year. And Amazon can rely on the world's biggest toy-store chain to pick and buy the toys. The downside of the deal is that the two companies must split profits in what is shaping up to be a business that does not look as if it will produce many.</p>
        <p>John Eyler, the chief executive of Toys ''R'' Us, said that possibility was a sacrifice worth making in light of more sober predictions about how important the Internet will be.</p>
        <p>''We have to serve our guests any way they want to be served, but even this year the Internet will only be 2 or 3 percent of the market,'' he said. ''Fifteen years ago, catalogs had gone crazy and everyone said they would be 25 percent of sales. They settled in at 6 percent. Then home shopping on television was going to take over, but it didn't. The Internet is going through the same evolution.''</p>
        <p>Toys, moreover, are as difficult to sell on the Internet as books are easy. The business is supremely seasonal. Toys have low prices, but many are bulky and expensive to ship. Most important, they must be ordered, mostly from factories in Asia, months before they arrive. If they do not sell, they can't be returned, and if they are hot, there is no way to get more.</p>
        <p>''Toys are the hardest category on the Web,'' said Chuck Davis, the chief executive of BizRate and a former Disney executive who is involved in the company's investment in ToySmart.</p>
        <p>So this year, parents will find a much calmer market, largely dominated by eToys and the Amazon-Toysrus.com venture. There will be some low-key specialty players, like the online store of F. A. O. Schwarz, the emporium for indulgent grandparents, and SmarterKids.com, which specializes in educational toys.</p>
        <p>Perhaps more significant will be newly energized Web stores from such high-volume mass merchants as Wal-Mart, the nation's No. 1 toy seller, and Kmart, No. 3 after Toys ''R'' Us. Both will concentrate on selling the most popular toys at rock-bottom prices. For example, each mass merchant has boatloads of scooters for less than $50. The hot Razor scooter sells for $99, online and off.</p>
        <p>The mass merchandisers, in fact, may be the only good source of toy bargains for Web shoppers this year, a sharp contrast with last year, when discount coupons and offers of free shipping abounded. ''We've got to make a profit, so the customer is going to have to pay the cost of delivery'' this year, said Mr. Eyler of Toys ''R'' Us.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the sites are devoting rigorous attention to the intricate art of what is known as logistics, fine-tuning their warehouse and shipping operations and the intricate computer systems that run them so that millions of toys go in the right boxes with the right address labels on the right day. EToys, for example, canceled a contract with Federated Department stores to handle its fulfillment and spent the year building a warehouse in Virginia.</p>
        <p>For Amazon and Toysrus.com, hopes for an orderly year to prepare for the holiday rush were dashed when they agreed to their joint venture. Suddenly, Toysrus.com was closing three distribution centers and diverting millions of toys it had ordered to Amazon's warehouses instead of its own.</p>
        <p>All this work on logistics can help prevent some of last year's gaffes, but success this Christmas will ultimately rest on the toy stores' acumen in buying and merchandising. Will they have enough of what kids want without having too much of what they don't? The buyers must make big bets because the business has become so concentrated.</p>
        <p>That is especially true online. When customers go to a store and discover a certain toy has been sold out, they may buy something else, said John Barbour, the chief executive of Toysrus.com. ''On the Internet, if your kid wants a Tekno electronic dog, and we don't have it, they will keep searching until they buy it somewhere else.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Barbour argues that the power of Toys ''R'' Us gives its venture with Amazon an edge over eToys. ''If you are a manufacturer with short supply, which e-commerce player gets the orders? The one affiliated with the biggest toy company in the world.''</p>
        <p>Toby Lenk, the chief executive of eToys, argues that his site can get enough of almost every toy except for items like the Sony PlayStation 2, which no retailer can get enough of.</p>
        <p>What is important, Mr. Lenk says, is that his company's strategy is not built on selling hot toys in high volume, which is how Toys ''R'' Us and Wal-Mart operate.</p>
        <p>''When I conceived this business plan four and a half years ago at home at 2 a.m., I said, 'Rule No. 1: Don't go head-to-head with Wal-Mart,' '' Mr. Lenk said.</p>
        <p>While it carries the mass-market toys, eToys focuses on specialty items and private-label toys that have profit margins as high as 70 percent. It fills its site with chatty features like recommendations of such toys for children of various ages.</p>
        <p>Not only does this approach increase the store's margins, it also cuts the risk of inventory gluts and shortages.</p>
        <p>Of course, Mr. Lenk acknowledges that it will take a big pile of popular items like toy safes before eToys, which had sales of $150 million last year, can reach the $750 million it needs to be profitable and guarantee its place among its bigger and stronger rivals.</p>
