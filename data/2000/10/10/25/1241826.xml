        <p>The Japanese Fair Trade Commission has begun an investigation into allegations that a unit of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, Japan's former telephone monopoly, has tried to prevent competitors from setting up lines for faster access to the Internet. The commission said it was looking into whether NTT East, which provides local telephone services, had worked to slow the rollout of digital subscriber lines that offer connections to the Internet that are more than 10 times faster than the service provided by N.T.T. Junichiro Miyazu, N.T.T.'s president, confirmed that the commission was conducting an investigation but said he did not know what it was looking into. The commission said the inquiry might take as long as a year to complete and could result in penalties against N.T.T. Tokyo Metallic, a small DSL provider that is partly owned by J. P. Morgan, and other providers of new ways to connect to the Internet, as well as consumers, who have complained that N.T.T. takes an inordinate amount of time to get their services hooked up.</p>
