        <p>A local political group criticized the Nassau County executive today for awarding more than $23 million in no-bid contracts to 33 companies that donated money either to him or to the county Republican Party.</p>
        <p>The group, the Long Island Progressive Coalition, is urging voters to approve a ballot proposal on Nov. 7 that would restrict the county executive's ability to award certain personal-service contracts without competitive bidding. The coalition said the awarding of contracts to donors amounted to a conflict of interest.</p>
        <p>County Executive Thomas S. Gulotta, a Republican, who has a $2.5 million campaign fund, called that assertion ''reckless, irresponsible, misleading and inaccurate.''</p>
        <p>In a 21-page report, the nonprofit coalition detailed donations made by engineering, law, planning and other kinds of professional firms between July 1996 and January 2000. It said 29 of the 33 businesses were awarded lucrative contracts within six months of donating. All 33 gave a total of $170,655 to Citizens for Tom Gulotta or the county Republican committee.</p>
        <p>The coalition examined only law firms that received contracts totaling $100,000 or more and other businesses that received contracts of $200,000 or more. Those contracts for which corresponding contributions were found represented 22 percent of the $106 million worth of work awarded between October 1996 and November 1999 that did not require competitive bidding, the report said.</p>
        <p>''It is the repeated pattern of contracts and contributions coinciding within a few days that creates this enormous conflict of interest that is most troubling,'' said Richard Kirsch, the author of the report and the executive director of Citizen Action of New York, which is affiliated with the Long Island group.</p>
        <p>Lisa Tyson, the coalition's associate director, said the report was released partly to draw attention to the Nov. 7 referendum. But she said the group was also urging public disclosure of all campaign donations by personal service contractors.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gulotta said the campaign contributions were on public record at the county Board of Elections in Mineola. The county attorney and other department heads make recommendations about which firms to hire, he said, and the awarding of no-bid or personal service contracts is made public through the county's legislative calendar.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gulotta said he had signed a local law enabling the referendum to reach voters on Election Day and planned to vote for the initiative.</p>
        <p>Since September 1997, the Rules Committee of the Nassau County Legislature has, by informal agreement, reviewed and approved many no-bid contracts worth $25,000 or more and contracts awarded to any firm once it receives more than $100,000 in a one-year period, said Chuck Cutolo, counsel to the Democratic legislative majority. If the ballot proposal is approved by the voters, the agreement would become law and lower the one-year threshold to $50,000, he said.</p>
        <p>Democratic and Republican leaders in the County Legislature would not comment today on the report.  Anthony J. Santino, a spokesman for the county Republican Party, criticized the report. ''It's desperate campaign rhetoric, which they don't even bother to back up with any facts as it pertains to the Republican Party,'' he said.</p>
