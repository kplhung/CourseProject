        <p>Two of Japan's top steel producers, the NKK Corporation and the Kawasaki Steel Corporation, said that they were in talks about sharing research and development facilities but denied a report in Yomiuri Shumbun, a Japanese newspaper, that they are in merger talks. The speculation of the merger comes amid global consolidation of the steel industry. Facing competitive pressures at home and abroad, NKK and Kawasaki have been struggling under the weight of over 1 trillion yen of interest-bearing debt and looking for ways to cut costs and capacity, analysts said. A merger of the two companies, the No. 2 and No. 3 steel makers in Japan, would create the largest steel producer in the world.</p>
