        <p>WHEN Sasol Ltd., a world leader in energy resources and a powerhouse of South African industry, decided earlier this year to start buying its paper and pens online, it went to its longtime supplier and fellow Johannesburg company, Waltons Stationery, and outlined its plans.</p>
        <p>If Waltons, the country's biggest office supplier, wanted to be part of Sasol's future, the 70-store Waltons chain had to change the way it did business.</p>
        <p>Today, Waltons receives Sasol's orders, worth more than $2 million a year, over the Internet. For South Africa, a country where television first appeared little more than two decades ago, the arrangement would seem to have been a breakthrough.</p>
        <p>Waltons's entry into e-commerce, however, is for the moment benefiting only Sasol and a few other big customers. It will be next year, the company said, before small businesses and individuals will be able to  order a case of paper or a box of pens online from Waltons.</p>
        <p>The reasons help illustrate the peculiar potential of e-commerce in South Africa, where first-world wealth and third-world desperation coexist in an uneasy amalgam of inequality.</p>
        <p>Although South Africa's economy is only about the size of Belgium's, it dwarfs other African nations. Under President Thabo Mbeki, inflation has dropped and the country's credit rating has climbed.</p>
        <p>But efforts to streamline its consumer economy are hampered by a huge gap between rich and poor, a legacy of the apartheid era, compounded by heavy nationalization. Adult illiteracy was estimated at 30 percent in 1995, and 4.2 million people out of an estimated total population of 45 million are currently thought to be infected with the virus that causes AIDS.</p>
        <p>Waltons sells mostly to businesses, from small outfits to huge conglomerates. It began its business-to-business and business-to-consumer Internet effort about a year ago. But about six months ago, after the big companies came calling, it decided to make business-to-business its priority and postponed its consumer shopping site until next year. Its revised timetable suggests that Waltons is not fretting that it will lose many of its ordinary customers.</p>
        <p>Not only do the big companies have the infrastructure to make business-to-business e-commerce and its enormous savings a reality, but they also have well-established relationships with their suppliers. These include systems for receiving regular orders, collecting payments and making deliveries. Often, the only step left is shifting much of that onto the Internet.</p>
        <p>But South Africa has nothing like Sears, Roebuck &amp; Company, Victoria's Secret or L. L. Bean and the mail-order culture that in the United States helped pave the way for Amazon.com and its imitators. Buying or selling -- whether it's a power drill or panties or a parka -- any place but a store is a new concept here and is only slowly taking hold.</p>
        <p>''We are actually quite far behind,'' said Allison Mills-Daggatt, a former executive with the office-supply store Staples who is now the e-commerce director for Waltons. ''There is so much potential in this whole business, but we're not even where Staples was four years ago. It's a bit frustrating how slow it is.''</p>
        <p>There are reasons for the reluctance to order online, or even over the phone.</p>
        <p>Topping the list is a notoriously unreliable national mail service, which often forces the use of costly courier services. Then there is Telkom, the South African telecommunications monopoly, which is undergoing privatization. A 30 percent stake in Telkom has been sold and the company is set to face competition within several years.</p>
        <p>That is way too long for a business revolution, so many people are looking beyond fixed-line phones and personal home computers.</p>
        <p>Optimists are attaching their hopes to mobile phones, which have more than five million users, including a fair share in the impoverished townships.</p>
        <p>Indeed, for every high-speed data line coursing through the corridors of the country's high-powered investment banks and industrial conglomerates, there are hundreds of homes that have never been connected to traditional telephone lines. And they are unlikely to be any time soon.</p>
        <p>According to the 1996 census, only 11 percent of blacks, who make up just more than three-quarters of the population, had a telephone in their home or a cell phone. The figure for whites was 89 percent.</p>
        <p>As a result, e-commerce has been an uneven exercise in South Africa. Big companies have plunged in at Pentium speed, while ordinary customers and the businesses that serve them have been far slower.</p>
        <p>One argument says that too few people are shopping online to make noticeable discounts and speedy service economical; the counterargument says that more people would shop online if retailers offered more.</p>
        <p>It is, however, possible to buy everything from cereal to books online in South Africa, and more sites are opening monthly. But it may be a less-than-satisfactory experience, leaving a shopper longing for a local shopping center.</p>
        <p>Certainly the share of South Africa's 45 million people who have online access -- estimated at one million to two million -- is paltry. But it is hardly surprising, considering the apartheid regime's neglect of the black majority.</p>
        <p>And for their part, many businesses in South Africa are still finding their way in a world in which they were isolated for so long. Big businesses with considerable international exposure, like Sasol, have been among the most aggressive, seizing on e-commerce.</p>
        <p>With its office supplies now being ordered over the Internet, Sasol is poised to move on to more sophisticated and more expensive supplies like drill bits, grinders, electric motors and pipe fittings.</p>
        <p>''It's early day for us, but at least we can say we're doing it,'' said Alex Zwiegelaar, the general manager of Sasol's information and logistics division.</p>
        <p>And Waltons has benefited from its big customers' demands. ''It made us make things happen,'' said Tina Piccione, the marketing director. ''It was definitely a blessing in disguise.''</p>
