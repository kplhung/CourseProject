        <p>Prosecutors dropped the attempted murder charge today against one of the two state troopers involved in the 1998 New Jersey Turnpike shooting that wounded three unarmed minority men and made racial profiling on the state's highways a national issue.</p>
        <p>James J. Gerrow Jr., a special prosecutor, said two new witnesses had made statements in April that supported some of Trooper John Hogan's claims of self-defense. That new evidence caused him to ask the judge to dismiss the most serious charge against Mr. Hogan. The trooper still faces charges of aggravated assault for his role in the shooting, and his partner, John Kenna, is still charged with attempted murder and aggravated assault.</p>
        <p>The decision was criticized today by many civil rights leaders and black elected officials, who said a jury should have been allowed to decide the merits of the charge.</p>
        <p>A grand jury indicted both troopers after hearing evidence that they fired 11 shots into a van on April 23, 1998, after stopping the vehicle near turnpike Exit 7A, in Mercer County.</p>
        <p>The officers have contended that they stopped the vehicle for speeding and opened fire only after it backed toward them, knocking Trooper Hogan to the ground. But civil rights advocates said the officers stopped the van because its four occupants were black and Hispanic and the state police had a policy of singling out minority drivers in their effort to intercept drug couriers.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors pressed for an attempted murder charge because, they said, forensic evidence cast doubt on the troopers' version of the incident and suggested that the troopers fired at the van as it rolled away from them, not toward them. One of the passengers, Danny Reyes, was wounded in the back.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gerrow said the new witnesses, two drivers for United Parcel Service, indicated that neither officer fired once the van began moving away from them. ''It was not only the act of shooting Mr. Reyes, but more importantly, the timing of same that was crucial to the charge of attempted murder,'' Mr. Gerrow wrote.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hogan's lawyer, Robert Galantucci, said he was heartened by the prosecutor's decision. ''But it's only the first step,'' he said. ''Until both troopers are vindicated on all charges, we'll continue to work as hard as we can.''</p>
        <p>Both officers have also been charged with falsifying documents to conceal the race of drivers they stopped in other cases.</p>
        <p>The Rev. Reginald T. Jackson, executive director of the Black Ministers Council of New Jersey, said today that he was stunned because the prosecutors' decision means that the two new witnesses' credibility will not be weighed by a jury.</p>
        <p>''The whole fallacy of this is, why couldn't these new witnesses -- who did not come forward on their own, but only came forward because they were stopped for some violation -- why couldn't they be called as witnesses during the trial and properly cross-examined?'' Mr. Jackson said.</p>
        <p>Assemblyman LeRoy J. Jones Jr. questioned whether the decision to drop the attempted murder charge was an attempt to limit the public relations damage the case has caused the state. He said recent talks to negotiate a plea agreement with the troopers had the same purpose.</p>
        <p>''The prosecutor's job is to administer justice, not to make deals, and this is an absolute failure to live up to that responsibility.'' said Mr. Jones, an Essex County Democrat.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gerrow, the special prosecutor, was out of town and did not return calls requesting comment. But the state attorney general, John J. Farmer Jr., who took office in May 1999, issued a brief statement supporting the decision. ''This action was taken in the interest of justice, which is our obligation,'' he wrote. ''It was not part of any negotiation or plea bargain discussion.''</p>
        <p>A hearing is scheduled for Oct. 31 on the defense lawyers' request that Judge Andrew Smithson dismiss all charges because of what they called ''prosecutorial misconduct.'' Lawyers for the troopers have argued that prosecutors announced that the troopers had been indicted on charges of falsifying records to conceal their racial profiling while a separate grand jury was still weighing evidence in the shooting case.</p>
        <p>Trooper Kenna, who Mr. Reyes said shot him four times even though his hands were raised as he sat inside the van, has also filed suit against the state. In court papers, Mr. Kenna said he had been involved in an on-duty shooting a month before the turnpike incident but was pressured to return to patrol duties after receiving little counseling for  trauma.</p>
        <p>The turnpike shooting brought intense scrutiny to law enforcement practices in New Jersey, where minority drivers have complained for years that they are pulled over solely because of their skin color.</p>
        <p>State police officials denied that the problem existed, even as they collected detailed statistical evidence of profiling and withheld it from the public and federal investigators, according to internal memos.</p>
        <p>Gov. Christine Todd Whitman has said she had believed the claims of state police commanders that there was no evidence of racial profiling until early 1999, when she ordered her own investigation into the department. She later became the first state official to acknowledge the problem publicly, and agreed to let a federal monitor oversee the state's effort to overhaul the force.</p>
        <p>Lawyers for the victims of the turnpike shooting reacted calmly today to news that charges against Trooper Hogan had been reduced.</p>
        <p>''This doesn't affect our civil suit at all,'' said Johnnie Cochran Jr. ''Clearly, any time you have four men shot during a racial profiling stop, they are still victims.''</p>
