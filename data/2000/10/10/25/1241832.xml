        <p>IT is now officially safe for Mets fans to invoke names like Rocky and Mookie, Cleon and Nails, Tug and Bobby O.</p>
        <p>At the very least, the current World Series still retains the hope of respectability -- not for the Mets or Yankees, who both will have had a fine year and will need no apologies, but for the hype of the long-awaited Subway Series.</p>
        <p>Poor New York. We all puffed up our collective chest and accepted this Subway Series as our due, after 44 years of suffering without one. For the last chunk of October, New York would be the center of the universe, featuring a long and epic struggle between the Yankees and the Mets.</p>
        <p>After the first two games, the Subway Series was in danger of growing stale faster than yesterday's onion bagel. However, last night the Mets held off the Yankees, 4-2, in the Mets' brutally noisy ballpark.</p>
        <p>Strange eighth-inning things happened in the park where Tommie Agee once made a spectacular catch in 1969 and Ray Knight made a desperate romp around the bases in 1986.</p>
        <p>Derek Jeter couldn't quite hold Todd Zeile's single up the middle. Benny Agbayani, the new people's choice, broke the tie with a ringing double. And Bubba Trammell, evoking Dusty Rhodes, the Giant pinch-hitter deluxe of 1954, drove in an insurance run with a sacrifice fly.</p>
        <p>At the very least, the Mets stopped the Yankees' World Series winning streak at 14 games, and ended the eight-game postseason streak of Orlando (El Duque) Hernandez and guaranteed a fifth game tomorrow night.</p>
        <p>And perhaps, just perhaps, the Mets may have opened the door for sliding, Swoboda-like catches and Dykstra-like home runs that marked their two previous world championships.</p>
        <p>Until last night, this Subway Series was about to be remembered for the crude behavior of Roger Clemens, who was fined $50,000 yesterday for his bizarre act of throwing a jagged bat end in the direction of his nemesis, Mike Piazza, on Sunday night.</p>
        <p>It would have been an injustice to the Yankees for baseball to suspend Clemens during the Series, but the fine will not affect Clemens, this creature of the designated hitter rule, who throws inside at batters without worrying about retribution.</p>
        <p>The truth is, pitchers can be athletes, too. Rick Reed, the Mets' starting pitcher, actually slapped a single and laid down a sacrifice bunt, but at least he had practice during the real season, when traditional baseball is practiced in the National League.</p>
        <p>Reed's opponent, the redoubtable Hernandez, not only struck out 12 Mets, but even laid down a sacrifice bunt, even though he insists he was never a good batter, even as a child in Cuba.</p>
        <p>El Duque performed all these deeds with a cold, or flu symptoms -- and he performed his heroics without once plugging an opponent under suspicious circumstances or heaving a dangerous piece of wood.</p>
        <p>The Mets may have been helped by the return to their ballpark, but also to real baseball, rather than the bogus brand played in the American League. Like a rogue elephant, the designated hitter rule squats in the center of the World Series, leaving its odoriferous presence.</p>
        <p>With the Series moving to Shea, the Yankees could no longer hide the dysfunctional fielder, Chuck Knoblauch, as the designated hitter, so Joe Torre chose to bench him completely. Jose Vizcaino, playing second base, went hitless.</p>
        <p>Torre doesn't hide his disdain for the designated hitter rule.</p>
        <p>''Well, it's a lot more complicated,'' he said the other day. ''You have to be a lot more on your toes when you make pitching changes.''</p>
        <p>After two games, the Subway Series was in danger of being remembered for a pitcher who needs not fear lex talionis in the form of an opposing manager pointing a forefinger at an aural appendage.</p>
        <p>''If somebody should get hit, it's Roger Clemens,'' Reed had said, adding, ''But I've never seen him hit.''</p>
        <p>It would appear that Clemens has carefully slotted his career to avoid going to home plate with a whole piece of lumber in his hand. He has batted 14 times in interleague games and four other times in two 1986 World Series games in Shea Stadium. (He did hit a double for Toronto at Shea, and when the Mets ran three pickoff attempts, he threatened Rey Ordonez, ''If you do that again, I'm going to plug you next time.'')</p>
        <p>Baseball is said to be looking into the future of the designated hitter. Right now the investigation is on hold. The Subway Series lives. And Roger Clemens may yet pitch a sixth game -- in his own ballpark, where he is safe from having to bat, under the strange two-headed rules of the game.</p>
