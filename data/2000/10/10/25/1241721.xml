        <p>Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's visit to North Korea this week illustrated the opportunities and risks of defrosting relations with the world's last Stalinist state. Dr. Albright was given a gracious reception and spent six hours in constructive talks with Kim Jong Il, the North Korean leader. But she and the reporters accompanying her saw a highly regimented society organized around a slavish personality cult even as it struggles with severe shortages of food, electricity and most of the basic conveniences of modern life.</p>
        <p>Coaxing North Korea out of its long international isolation and limiting its development of advanced weapons are important American goals. The Clinton administration has handled North Korea well, but diplomacy has now reached a critical stage as President Clinton weighs whether to visit Pyongyang in the waning days of his presidency.</p>
        <p>Dr. Albright reports ''important progress'' toward agreement on restraining the North's development, testing and export of longer-range missiles. Firm agreements on these and other subjects, like a North Korean commitment to distance itself from international terrorism and return abducted Japanese nationals, could justify a Clinton trip. But Mr. Clinton should go only if concrete results are assured in advance.</p>
        <p>North Korea has good reasons for cultivating improved relations with Washington. If Pyongyang wins removal from America's list of countries supporting terrorism, it will become eligible for badly needed loans from the World Bank and other international institutions. North Korea also wants the prestige of establishing formal diplomatic ties with the United States.</p>
        <p>For the past six years North Korea has frozen its nuclear weapons development program in exchange for American and international help in constructing two civilian power reactors. For more than a year the North has abided by an agreement to suspend long-range missile testing. More recently it offered to abandon its missile development effort in exchange for foreign help in launching space satellites. Specialists from both countries will soon meet to discuss specific steps North Korea can take to limit its missile program.</p>
        <p>The North also enhanced its credibility when Kim Jong Il met with South Korea's president, Kim Dae Jung, in June, although it has lagged in following up with further gestures of reconciliation. Dealing with North Korea remains full of uncertainties, as Dr. Albright discovered when Kim Jong Il brought her to an elaborate tribute to the achievements and military strength of North Korean Communism. That is not the kind of spectacle Mr. Clinton should attend if he travels to Pyongyang.</p>
