        <p>A group of major international banks, stung by the growing reputation of the banking industry as a haven for ill-gotten gains, is pledging to form a global front against money laundering.</p>
        <p>They plan to issue guidelines to toughen their practices to shut off dirty-money deposits by organized crime and corrupt political leaders. While the details will not be released until next week, a significant provision in the new code of conduct will require banks to bring the activities of offshore banking subsidiaries in line with tougher rules on financial crime.</p>
        <p>Switzerland's largest bank, UBS, is leading the effort, which will initially be joined by a group of banks from the Netherlands, Spain, England, Germany, France and Hong Kong.</p>
        <p>Starting in the 1980's, when the late Philippine president Ferdinand Marcos deposited more than $500 million in Swiss accounts, major banks have  repeatedly disclosed that they have accepted deposits from dictators. The latest cases involve the former Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic and the late Nigerian leader Sani Abacha. Swiss officials say Mr. Milosevic and associates have deposited more than $57 million in accounts here.</p>
        <p>Mr. Abacha's deposits, which totaled more than $670 million in banks in Switzerland, were a particular embarrassment because they came after stricter money laundering rules were established. Swiss banking regulators publicly scolded six banks, including Credit Suisse and two of its subsidiaries, for accepting questionable Nigerian deposits.</p>
        <p>Dr. Mark Pieth, a money laundering expert who helped draft the new code, said the rules would be tougher than those already adopted by the Paris-based Financial Action Task Force to single out countries that do not effectively guard against money laundering.</p>
        <p>''We can issue blacklists, but short of closing a bank down, what can you do?'' Dr. Pieth asked. He said tough regulations could end the practice of companies setting aside offshore bank accounts to bribe foreign officials. ''It's not just money laundering,'' he said, but the banks want to prevent people from using banks for illegal ends.</p>
        <p>The banks that have signed on include UBS; Credit Suisse; ABN-Amro of the Netherlands; Banco Santander of Spain; Barclays Bank of Britain; Deutsche Bank and its New York-based Bankers Trust unit; HSBC of Hong Kong; and Societe Generale of France. Three American banks, Chase Manhattan and its merger partner J. P. Morgan and Citibank, are also expected to sign on, according to UBS.</p>
        <p>The guidelines, named Wolfsberg after a UBS training center, were drawn up with Transparency International, an anticorruption organization.</p>
