        <p>AT first glance, the Midtown Manhattan studio of Eyada.com seems like a typical radio station. A hallway cluttered with posters and photocopied notices leads to a cramped room where an engineer prepares for the next station break. But on this particular evening, Eyada's computer game server has been hopping. Players have gathered from around the Internet for ''The Totally Intense In-Your-Face Thumb-Twitching Joystick-Vibrating Hard-Drive-Crashing Videogame Show.''</p>
        <p>Video? On radio? Yes, interactive video at that. ''Totally Intense'' offers something unheard of on regular radio or on TV: the ability to play the game in real time with other listeners and the host.</p>
        <p>After existing for five years, Internet radio is no longer an online version of what Web types like to call terrestrial radio. It's live game-playing, it's community, it's chat, it's TV, and it's as many channels as a site has servers.</p>
        <p>Propelled by technology and the chance to present more interesting fare than on-the-air stations offer, Internet-only Webcasters have proliferated, offering every imaginable kind of music, talk and news. A typical American city has 20 to 50 broadcast radio stations. According to BRS Media, which has been compiling a directory of Internet radio stations since 1995, the online listener now has access to more than 13,000 sites.</p>
        <p>That's not to say that all Web radio has gone the way of ''Totally Intense.'' Many of the most popular sites are still regular radio stations using the Internet to build an audience beyond the geographic limits of their signal. So far, the audience for Internet-only radio is small. At any moment, the most popular Internet-only stations may have 200 to 300 listeners compared with 45,000 for a regular major market station. The Internet-only audience, however, is growing rapidly.</p>
        <p>When Arbitron released the first Info stream Webcast ratings last October, the top site was TexasRebelRadio.com, which plays Americana, alternative country, Texas and roots music. That format wouldn't carry a commercial station in most markets, but TexasRebelRadio sends the signal of KFAN-FM in Austin, Tex., a city with a reputation for a progressive music scene.</p>
        <p>Other Internet-only sites are virtual jukeboxes that give listeners a remarkable degree of control over what they can hear. NetRadio.com and Spinner.com offer channels with more than 100 subgenres of music. Such sites limit expenses by hiring professional programmers to select the music, then playing canned audio for visitors. Live365.com, Radio.sonicnet.com and Shoutcast also allow users to program their own stations, to which other listeners can tune in. The music comes from either the house server or is uploaded by the user programming the station, with guidelines on the type of music it is permissible to upload. These companies say they have have either negotiated licensing agreements with the recording industry or are doing so.</p>
        <p>Still other stations, like Eyada.com, are betting on the appeal of live, exclusive programs. Every Thursday night in San Francisco's Mission District, dance music fans gather for the Webcast of BetaLounge.com. The show is archived on the site for replay throughout the week, but when it is live, there is a chat room and studio cameras relaying images of the dancers and the disc jockey. ''It's about taking the nightclub environment online,'' said Ian Raikow, president and program director of BetaLounge.</p>
        <p>Mr. Raikow's role in booking guest D.J.'s is more like a party promoter than a radio program director. ''None of us sit there, track to track, and say, 'Well, you've got to play this, you've got to play that,' '' he said. ''Some D.J.'s are known for playing a certain style, so you know when you book them, you're going to get that. Others are a little more flexible, and you can say, 'Why don't you play a drum and bass set tonight?' ''</p>
        <p>Rob Jones, the founder and general manager of Enigma Digital's KNAC.com, calls his station Club Med for metalheads. KNAC.com ranked No. 3 in the Infostream Webcast ratings released in September. In addition to heavy metal music, the station offers users free personal home pages, music news and features, message boards and a studio camera. There is a chat room where fans talk to the D.J. and one another.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jones says KNAC specifies four songs an hour that the D.J. must play. The rest of the music is selected based on the interaction between the host and audience.</p>
        <p>''As we're bringing the Net to life,'' Mr. Jones said, ''FM radio is becoming more and more automated. It's really funny. You have one guy in one city who is now on eight different radio stations in eight different markets. Go ahead and call him and make a request. The guy's not there.''</p>
        <p>Kurt Hanson, publisher of Radio and Internet Newsletter and chairman of Strategic Media Research, says Internet-only stations have the luxury of experimentation because they are cheaper to start. Conversely, broadcast radio is expensive to get into, but access is cheap and easy for customers.</p>
        <p>''The biggest cost for radio stations, by far, is servicing the debt to buy the radio station from the previous owner,'' he said. ''They're paying for that F.C.C. license. They're paying tens of millions of dollars.''</p>
        <p>IT remains to be seen whether Internet-only stations can make money. The sites have an advantage over regular radio in that they can find out exactly how many computers are tuned in at a given moment, and through user registration can gather more precise demographic information on their audiences. New technologies that allow online stations to identify listeners by demographics and that insert advertisements for them within an audio stream could help the stations turn a profit.</p>
        <p>Bill Rose, vice president and general manager of Arbitron's Internet Information Services, worries that once broadcasters begin to take Webcasting seriously, it may be too late for them to have a stake. ''A number of years ago, when cable TV began, the network and affiliate part of the business said, 'Oh, it's only that wacky guy in suburban Atlanta broadcasting old movies over and over again.' If you ask them now, they'll say they made Ted Turner rich, and they lost an opportunity.''</p>
        <p>The Internet radio audience is growing quickly. At the National Association of Broadcasters convention in September, Arbitron/Edison Media Research presented its fifth Internet study, ''Twenty Startling Insights About the Internet and Streaming.'' According to the report, which is posted at www.arbitron.com, one of every five Americans has listened to online simulcasts of broadcast stations, and 13 percent of the population has listened to Internet-only radio. But radio stations have had 75 years to build a following; Internet-only stations have had less than three years.</p>
        <p>Three years is like three centuries for video game fans. After ''Totally Intense'' starts, the program's host, Pete Hallen, enters the fray on Eyada.com's game server, an Internet arena where the audience can play against the host and one another. Tonight's competition is Unreal Tournament, a popular first-person shooter game where contestants battle within a surreal, intricate three-dimensional landscape, using an arsenal of weapons.</p>
        <p>But at 8 p.m., Mr. Hallen can't catch up to the players who have been online since 6. As he is destroyed by a player named ''JennyMcCarthy-33.6,'' the audience watches through a video stream from the show's home page. Finally, Mr. Hallen flips the Webcast feed to another monitor, where he indulges in a few lazy rounds of Ms. Pac-Man and Galaxian, all to demonstrate Dreamcast's latest retro-game releases.</p>
        <p>''The show's been going since August,'' Mr. Hallen says. ''The game server didn't go up until February. There's other multiplayer games online, but I've never seen anything like this.''</p>
        <p>Appliances That Keep a Beat</p>
        <p>THERE are software developers who want to make Internet radio run on pagers, mobile phones and hand-held computers. They are using W.A.P., or wireless application protocol, a global standard for transferring data from the Internet to wireless devices.</p>
        <p>W.A.P.-enabled streaming audio is several years away, but a few wireless phones and personal digital assistants are playing MP3's and FM radio.</p>
        <p>Compaq sells a personal digital assistant, the iPaq, with an MP3 player, for $499.</p>
        <p>Other companies are betting on dedicated Internet radio appliances, a box that plays Internet radio.</p>
        <p>Sonicbox's iM remote tuner, which costs about $100, beams an Internet audio signal from a personal computer to a stereo system or portable receiver. The tuner can pick up an iM radio signal usually up to 100 feet from the PC.</p>
        <p>Audioramp.com's iRad stereo connects directly to the Internet without a personal computer and plays audio streams, MP3's and regular CD's. The company began taking orders for the $399 device at its Web site,  www.audioramp.com, in July.</p>
        <p>3Com is developing the Kerbango Internet radio, and RCA has licensed its technology to create its own such device. 3Com expects to begin selling the Kerbango in time for the holidays.</p>
