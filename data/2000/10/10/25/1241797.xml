        <p>Teachers in this shore township went on strike this morning after state-mediated talks broke down just two hours before school was to open.</p>
        <p>Parents of the district's 4,500 students had little warning of the action, which led to schools being closed about 6 a.m. today. Although notes were sent home on Monday alerting parents of a possible strike, many were left to scramble this morning to find child care.</p>
        <p>Teachers here have been working without a contract since June.</p>
        <p>Late this afternoon Judge Clarkson S. Fisher Jr. of State Superior Court ruled that the action by the district's 400 teachers and 100 teacher aides, clerical and janitorial workers was illegal, violating a state law banning strikes by public employees.  He ordered them to return to work Wednesday morning or face contempt of court sanctions.</p>
        <p>It was not immediately clear whether members of the union, the Neptune Township Education Association, would return to work. A union spokeswoman, Karen Joseph, said that despite the impasse in the negotiations, the union remained ready to bargain and believed it had been locked out by the district.</p>
        <p>In most such strikes in the state, public employee unions do not comply with court orders and force contempt citations, most of which are dismissed when a settlement is reached.</p>
        <p>Dr. Michael Lake, superintendent of the district, said that the administration would announce to parents that the schools would reopen Wednesday and that officials would wait to see if teachers return. If they do not, the district will not hire substitutes to keep the schools open, meaning parents would have to find  child care and students would face added school days to make up for the lost time.</p>
        <p>Dr. Lake said that the district would ask Judge Fisher to cite the union and its members for contempt if they did not return. He also said that a state-appointed fact finder  who had been helping to negotiate  was expected to submit his report on Sunday. That report might form the basis for an imposed settlement of the labor dispute.</p>
        <p>That prospect was troubling to Ms. Joseph, who noted that the union had been faced with a fact finder's imposed settlement in its last two contracts and found the outcome unsatisfactory.</p>
        <p>Dr. Lake said that the two sides had been unable to agree on salary increases over the next three years, a district demand to add three workdays to the school year for teachers and an effort to increase the deductible on the district's medical, dental and prescription benefits.</p>
        <p>The two sides were also deadlocked over efforts to increase classroom time for teachers by 20 minutes a day, according to union officials.</p>
        <p>Neither side would discuss its position on the pay increase, but Ms. Joseph and others in the union said that efforts to lengthen the school year and increase deductibles would amount to unacceptable givebacks.</p>
        <p>Parents and students in this largely working-class shore town expressed both anger and grudging support for the teachers.</p>
        <p>Joan Richardson, who was drafted by her daughter to take care of her 9-year-old grandson, Devon, during the surprise vacation from school, seemed stoic as she entered a supermarket here with the boy in tow.</p>
        <p>''The teachers have issues that need to be met,'' she said. ''It's a bit of a hardship, but what's really on our minds is how long will it last.''</p>
        <p>A customer service representative at the ShopRite supermarket, Dawn Breining, who has a daughter and a son in high school, said the notes sent home by the district Monday about a ''threatened illegal strike'' by the union had given them warning and she was not completely surprised.</p>
        <p>''I was kind of expecting it since I know that they have been working without a contract since June,'' said Ms. Breining. ''My husband and I are both in unions and we just don't think it is right that they are trying to take the benefits from these people who have families.''</p>
        <p>Teachers picketed briefly this morning at some of the district's seven schools, but they later met privately with the union leadership and stayed away from the schools.  During hearings before Judge Fisher, James T. Hundley, the lawyer for the school district, pointed to the picketing, and signs carried by some reading ''On Strike,'' as proof that the union was striking illegally and was not simply locked out, as some in the union suggested.</p>
        <p>Later, Joseph Krimko, Neptune's  deputy mayor, stopped by union offices to offer his support. He criticized the school board and Dr. Lake for what he said was perennial brinksmanship in negotiating with the teachers union.</p>
        <p>''It's tough for them to work on a wing and a prayer and promise,'' Mr. Krimko said.</p>
