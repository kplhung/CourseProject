        <p>In its early years the Steppenwolf theater troupe was known, if it was known at all, as a gang of wild men and women whose stage work consisted largely of shrieking, smashing furniture and beating one another up. They set out to revolutionize American theater, but it seemed far more likely that they would soon be consumed by the fire of their emotions and disappear.</p>
        <p>Today, 25 years after its first performances in a church basement, Steppenwolf enjoys the admiration and envy of actors everywhere. It is among the world's most influential performing ensembles, and although many of its members have gone on to film and television stardom, they still come back regularly to perform the kind of emotionally charged drama that made the company famous.</p>
        <p>Having succeeded beyond all expectations except its own, the Steppenwolf company is looking toward new horizons. It now aims to find and encourage new playwrights and produce their work, open a year-round theater school and, most ambitiously, begin producing its own films and television shows. But the company's most daunting challenge is to shape a new approach to theater that would replace the hyper-energetic style that no longer suits its aging members.</p>
        <p>''In the old days we performed what some people called rock 'n' roll theater,'' said Martha Lavey, the company's artistic director. ''We were visceral, muscular, intense, brash, rebellious. We're still those things, but with the increasing sophistication of our ensemble members it's a bit more nuanced.  We're getting more interested in brain rather than brawn. There's more emphasis on telling stories and less on nonlinear work or work that's spectacle-based.''</p>
        <p>No important American theater ensemble has survived for even close to 25 years with the same core of performers. The troupe has expanded from its original 9 members to 33, but every one of the original members is still active. There is no such thing as a former member.</p>
        <p>That is all the more remarkable considering that the troupe includes stars like Joan Allen, who has won a Tony Award on Broadway and been nominated for two Oscars; Gary Sinise, an Emmy winner whose film credits include ''Forrest Gump'' and ''The Green Mile''; and John Malkovich, whose eerie and intense acting style embodies the Steppenwolf approach to theater.</p>
        <p>For years Steppenwolf's ensemble members worked, lived and in many cases slept together, married, divorced and otherwise shared an almost unbearable intimacy. Their ensemble meetings sometimes resembled primal scream therapy sessions. One meeting became so angry that worried neighbors called the police.</p>
        <p>Today only about a dozen of the ensemble members live in Chicago, with the rest in New York, Los Angeles and, in Mr. Malkovich's case, southern France. Some shifted their focus away from Steppenwolf when they began tasting stardom in the late 1980's, and the bonds that held the company together started to weaken.</p>
        <p>Sometime around the mid-1990's the ensemble's stars began realizing that what they had built at Steppenwolf was too valuable to lose. One by one they returned to embrace the company with renewed fervor.</p>
        <p>''People call us a family and that's what we are, one big dysfunctional family,'' said Rondi Reed, an ensemble member who lived for a time in Los Angeles and appeared in television shows including ''Roseanne'' and ''Seinfeld'' but who has returned to Chicago.</p>
        <p>''What happened for a while was that people wanted to spread their wings, and of course the ego also gets that little tug,'' Ms. Reed said. ''New York and especially Hollywood are great seducers. Once you get there you have agents telling you not to break your career momentum by going back to the Midwest to act onstage. But at some point even our bigger stars realized that they wanted to come back and recharge. Over the last five or six years they've reinvested in the company, and that's given us a new charge of energy.</p>
        <p>''We're a blue-collar theater company really. We're workaholics. We love to work and work together. The question is how you pass that on. How do you relate it to younger audiences and younger performers? We're all getting perilously close to 50. You read a play and think to yourself, 'Well, there's no character here who's over 35.' It's something we think and talk about a lot.''</p>
        <p>The five plays on Steppenwolf's program this season reflect the variety of theatrical projects that the company now presents. Its current offering is its first musical, an ambitious new work called ''The Ballad of Little Jo,'' the story of a woman who dresses as a man to make her way through the American West in the late 19th century. In its efforts to explore the themes of sex roles, racism and mob violence, it is a departure from the traditions of the American musical.</p>
        <p>Any member of the Steppenwolf ensemble can produce a work in which he or she believes strongly, and in the case of ''The Ballad of Little Jo'' it was Tina Landau who fell in love with the project, won approval to bring it to the stage and directed it.  In its roughness and imperfection it reflects the company's preference for striking out on new paths, however perilous.</p>
        <p>Later this season Steppenwolf will present ''The Weir,'' by Conor McPherson, the critically acclaimed play set in a rural Irish bar; ''David Copperfield,'' a specially commissioned adaptation of the classic novel; ''The Drawer Boy,'' by the Canadian playwright Michael Healey, in which a young Toronto actor visits a farm in preparation for a role; and ''Hedda Gabler,'' which will star Martha Plimpton, the newest member of the ensemble.</p>
        <p>''I joined in late '98, and I have to say that when they asked me I was honored to the point of being overwhelmed,'' said Ms. Plimpton, 30, who has been acting since she was a child. ''Film and television work can be fulfilling but it can also be limiting, and Steppenwolf is the ultimate place for an actor to stretch and take risks.''</p>
        <p>''Its work has a special style based on fearlessness and truth,'' she said in a telephone interview from New York. ''There's nowhere in this country where an actor can work so intensely and at such a consistently high level.''</p>
        <p>In addition to the five major productions planned on Steppenwolf's 510-seat main stage this season, more than a dozen others will be presented in different series on that stage, in the smaller studio theater upstairs or in a 60-seat space carved out in a nearby garage.</p>
        <p>One series is devoted exclusively to new plays. Another allows smaller Chicago-based ensembles to present their work in conjunction with Steppenwolf's staff, sometimes with members of the Steppenwolf ensemble in the cast. A third presents works for young people (the current one is a dramatization of Studs Terkel's ''Division Street: America''),  and a fourth brings quirky artists in for one-time shows, starting with Ramblin' Jack Elliott.</p>
        <p>Steppenwolf's reputation grew steadily after its incorporation in 1975, but the troupe did not burst into national prominence until 1982, when it brought a production of Sam Shepard's ''True West'' to New York with a cast featuring Mr. Sinise and Mr.  Malkovich. It has since sent plays not only to New York but elsewhere in the United States and to Britain, Ireland and Australia. The company is hoping to bring last season's biggest hit, a new production of ''One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,'' to New York in the spring.</p>
        <p>At home in Chicago, Steppenwolf has a large and passionate audience that considers it a kind of home team and roots for its success. This year, for the second time in a row, its 23,000 available subscriptions were sold out before the season opened.  Many subscribe without waiting to see what plays are on the schedule.</p>
        <p>The company generates two-thirds of its $9 million annual budget itself, mostly through ticket sales. The rest is covered by donations from individuals and corporations including United Airlines, American Express and Mercedes-Benz.</p>
        <p>but now the secret's out,'' ''In the old days we had an incredible arrogance,'' said Timothy Evans, a Steppenwolf producer. ''We were the bad boys, and we mocked everyone else.  At some point you mature out of that.  You want to keep the same edge, not necessarily by trashing the establishment the way we used to do but by mining the experience of life in a way that can be just as edgy but in a different and hopefully more meaningful way.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Evans is working with writers, network executives and Hollywood producers to get the company's film and television project started. If it suceeds, it will bring Steppenwolf's passionate style of ensemble acting to a vastly larger audience.</p>
        <p>''The goal is to present Steppenwolf as an entity, not to have Gary Sinise in someone else's show,'' he said. ''We have to do it in a way that lets us keep our identity. There's a lot of interest in the idea: within the next year we hope to have something in production.''</p>
        <p>Although Steppenwolf is the most enduring ensemble of American actors, it is hardly the first. Others,  from the Provincetown Players to Orson Welles's Mercury Theater, produced distinguished work but eventually dissolved as members went their separate ways. Having survived so many trials, Steppenwolf's members now dare to believe their troupe will exist indefinitely.</p>
        <p>''Our greatest achievement is that we survived for 25 years with our  personnel and our ideas pretty much intact,'' Mr. Sinise said by telephone from Los Angeles, where he is producing and starring in a film he described as a science-fiction thriller.</p>
        <p>''The principle of ensemble theater is to put people together over a period of time in a collective way, without the sense that the lead character in a play is the star and the smaller roles are not important,'' he said. ''The actors listen to each other and learn from each other and develop as actors together.'' ''The nature of our ensemble is now quite different from what it used to be,'' he added. ''We live apart, and there are some newer members of the company who have never even been onstage with some of the older members. But something happens when we get up there. The feeling of Steppenwolf somehow shines through.''</p>
