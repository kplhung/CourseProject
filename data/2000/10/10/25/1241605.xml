        <p>HERE are some tips on using a Web concierge service:</p>
        <p>* If you do not have a personal e-mail account, open one that you can use at home to contact your bank, dry cleaner, auto mechanic and other merchants. You may receive coupons or notices of sales and special offers. And with a personal e-mail account, you can avoid conflicts that might arise from using your work e-mail.</p>

        <p>HERE are some tips on using a Web concierge service:</p>
        <p>* If you do not have a personal e-mail account, open one that you can use at home to contact your bank, dry cleaner, auto mechanic and other merchants. You may receive coupons or notices of sales and special offers. And with a personal e-mail account, you can avoid conflicts that might arise from using your work e-mail.</p>
        <p>* Ask the merchant whether your calls or e-mail messages are being handled by employees or whether they are handled by the corporate office. Some companies hire customer service centers that are less familiar with your area. Decide which level of service you prefer.</p>
        <p>* Be sure you know the merchants' policy on privacy. If you are uncomfortable with them saving your credit card number for every purchase, you can pick different cards for different uses. Keep records of who has your information in case of billing discrepancies.</p>
        <p>* Ask whether your transaction history or credit card purchases will be shared with, or sold to, another company. It's possible to ask whether you can ''opt out'' of a customer database. Remember that you are trading information for convenience sake or to save money. If you prefer to pay in cash and not disclose your phone number, e-mail or street address, be sure the vendor understands your concern.</p>
