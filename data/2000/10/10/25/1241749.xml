        <p>In New Jersey, the Senate candidates plead and the voters yawn.</p>
        <p>Consider: About 1,000 people turned out for a rally for Israel at Temple B'nai Abraham in Livingston last Tuesday, but before Bob Franks and Jon S. Corzine began to speak at the candidates' forum following the rally, about 900 people got up and left. On television, the Yankees were playing the Mariners and the presidential candidates were having their final debate.</p>

        <p>In New Jersey, the Senate candidates plead and the voters yawn.</p>
        <p>Consider: About 1,000 people turned out for a rally for Israel at Temple B'nai Abraham in Livingston last Tuesday, but before Bob Franks and Jon S. Corzine began to speak at the candidates' forum following the rally, about 900 people got up and left. On television, the Yankees were playing the Mariners and the presidential candidates were having their final debate.</p>
        <p>George E. Pataki, the governor of New York, came to Trenton on Monday to give a lift to the campaign of Mr. Franks, a Republican, but even with a State House dominated by fellow Republicans 100 yards away, no more than a handful of the party faithful bothered to show up.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine, a Democrat, brought Senator Max Cleland of Georgia to a mini-mall set among retirement villages here in Ocean County this afternoon for a planned speech on veterans' benefits. There were all of 7 men in V.F.W. hats, and perhaps 20 passersby who stopped and paid attention.</p>
        <p>And Mr. Franks presented a campaign address to students at St. Peter's College in Jersey City this morning. In a hall seating 600, fewer than two dozen came to listen.</p>
        <p>Although it is easily the most expensive race for the United States Senate anywhere this year, the contest between Mr. Corzine, the former Wall Street financier, and Mr. Franks, the Main Street Republican, has so far generated all the excitement of a turtle race. The candidates are both drawing embarrassingly small crowds, voters are giving shrugs to reporters who ask about the race, and polls are showing a lower than usual level of attention to the race.</p>
        <p>What is going on?</p>
        <p>To hear the experts tell it, Mr. Corzine's lavish spending, upward of $60 million of his own fortune so far, has discouraged so many Republican donors that Mr. Franks has been cast into media darkness by his inability to buy more television and radio time, preventing him from making himself known on his own terms.</p>
        <p>Then there is the evidence that, in the presidential campaign, both national parties have already awarded New Jersey to the Democrat, Vice President Al Gore, leaving the state without a good race at the top of the ticket to spill over to the Senate race.</p>
        <p>And for the majority of the state that lives within New York City's electronic orbit, the race for the Senate might as well be between Hillary Rodham Clinton and Representative Rick A. Lazio: not only does the television present ads about the New York candidates, but the news programs cover their campaigns.</p>
        <p>Finally, there is no figure with a statewide reputation, a fiery Jim Florio, whom Mr. Corzine defeated in the primary, for example, or a Christine Todd Whitman, who buoyed Republican hopes when she toyed with running, but then dropped out.</p>
        <p>Still, the New Jersey Senate race is for one of only five open seats this year, and open seat races usually generate special excitement. In addition, both parties know that a gain of only six seats for the Democrats, from the current line-up in the Senate, would shift control to them.</p>
        <p>For all that, however, the voters are acting as if the race were happening someplace else.</p>
        <p>''It's pretty obvious why Corzine and Franks are not attracting any attention,'' said Maurice Carroll, director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute. ''One, people figure they've already seen enough of Corzine because every time they turn on their TV, there he is with his beard. Two, Bob Franks they wouldn't know if they stepped on him. If you put up a sign 'Meet Bob Franks' they wouldn't know what you're talking about.</p>
        <p>''And three,'' Mr. Carroll concluded with only a little characteristic hyperbole, ''everybody in New Jersey thinks Rick Lazio and Hillary Clinton are the ones running.''</p>
        <p>(New Jerseyans are not the only ones confused. Pollsters in eastern Pennsylvania are picking up signs of support for Mr. Corzine even though he is not running against Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, the Republican incumbent. Mr. Corzine's television commercials, meant for South Jersey, are broadcast from Philadelphia and cover a large part of Pennsylvania.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Carroll's most recent New Jersey poll, released Oct. 4, found that 55 percent of likely voters, and 44 percent of Republicans, said they did not know enough about Mr. Franks to have an opinion of him.</p>
        <p>Clearly, the Senate campaign could still turn into a race, said Ross K. Baker, a Rutgers political scientist.</p>
        <p>''It's very hard to draw crowds to a prizefight when there're only one  boxer,'' he said, alluding to Mr. Corzine's domination of the race so far. ''But Franks's visibility has started to increase, and I think you may see a change going into the election.''</p>
        <p>Still, conversations around the state seem to show an electorate more absorbed in the presidential  race or the battle between Mr. Lazio and Mrs. Clinton than two newcomers vying for the Senate.</p>
        <p>''I'm enthused about Lazio,'' said Peter Marchesi, 59, an auditor who lives in Fort Lee. ''But that's the wrong state.''</p>
        <p>Others insist that they will begin to pay attention before Election Day on Nov. 7.</p>
        <p>''I know the Senate is important, but I believe that electing a decent president is more beneficial to the country,'' said Colleen Mjorie, 32, a Princeton resident who described herself as politically independent. ''I'm sure they have been out campaigning and getting their messages out, but it's just not as interesting as the presidential race.''</p>
        <p>Others say they cannot be bothered.</p>
        <p>''I know everyone has the right to vote and that it's one of the freedoms U.S. citizens enjoy, and by not being informed one of our freedoms slips away,'' said Rich Ryan, 24, a bartender from Lawrenceville, a Trenton suburb. ''But there is just not enough time to fit politics into my life.''</p>
        <p>Jennifer Duffy, a Washington political analyst, said neither candidate had yet captured the imagination of the voters.</p>
        <p>''They're just not paying attention,'' Ms. Duffy said. ''I see the campaign skeds every day, and every day Corzine seems to spend his time doing labor-oriented meetings, and Franks seems to spend his time in diners. Those are tried and true strategies but a lot of people just aren't paying attention.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Franks's public schedule until now has also shown large gaps in time each day, time he has had to spend in private fund-raising, a task that has taken him away from the hustings and left the field more open for his opponent. Indeed, many voters' knowledge of the race seems to come from Mr. Corzine's ads.</p>
        <p>''Franks, according to Corzine's ads, does not look like a good person for the job,'' said John W. Ferro, 74, a retiree from Hamilton.</p>
        <p>Some voters, like Les Hergenrother of Berkeley Township, simply blame the candidates, wishing there were figures with stronger identities in the race.</p>
        <p>''I think the interest is there,'' Mr. Hergenrother said as he watched Mr. Corzine speak on veterans' benefits, ''but not as much as with Bradley and Lautenberg.'' Bill Bradley gave up his Senate seat from New Jersey in 1996, while Mr. Lautenberg's pending retirement opened up his seat.</p>
        <p>What people with long memories know is that New Jersey races have a history of taking wild swings late in the game, as Mrs. Whitman, then a relative unknown, showed in her last-minute surge past Mr. Florio to win the governor's seat in 1993.</p>
        <p>''Among people who are paying attention, this is a very close race,'' Ms. Duffy said. ''Even if they don't know Bob Franks well, the media have raised enough questions about Corzine to affect the race.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  October 27, 2000, Friday  An article on Wednesday about New Jersey voters' sparse interest in the Senate race, as shown in polls and in attendance at campaign events, misstated the contest's nationwide rank for spending. It is not the most expensive Senate race this year; the contest in New York is. The article also misstated the amount the Democratic candidate, Jon S. Corzine, has spent so far. It is about $56 million, not more than $60 million.</p>
