        <p>For George W. Bush, compassionate conservatism has been a fair-weather campaign theme. When he was dominating the Republican field in 1999, or maintaining a sizable lead over Al Gore most of this summer, Mr. Bush could afford to spend all his time talking about his innovative programs for the poor and what they said about his heart.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Bush has twice jettisoned compassionate conservatism when sharply challenged. After John McCain defeated him in New Hampshire, he came back as an unmodified conservative, suspicious of federal campaign-finance regulations, disdainful of Washington and eager to cut taxes. He has fought Mr. Gore similarly, running as a reformist outsider against a big-government Democrat.</p>

        <p>For George W. Bush, compassionate conservatism has been a fair-weather campaign theme. When he was dominating the Republican field in 1999, or maintaining a sizable lead over Al Gore most of this summer, Mr. Bush could afford to spend all his time talking about his innovative programs for the poor and what they said about his heart.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Bush has twice jettisoned compassionate conservatism when sharply challenged. After John McCain defeated him in New Hampshire, he came back as an unmodified conservative, suspicious of federal campaign-finance regulations, disdainful of Washington and eager to cut taxes. He has fought Mr. Gore similarly, running as a reformist outsider against a big-government Democrat.</p>
        <p>There's a reason that when the going gets tough, compassion goes. It has proved to be a limp and expendable campaign theme, especially for a conservative Republican.</p>
        <p>The danger of a candidate's describing himself as compassionate is that it enables his opponents to portray him as self-involved, morally vain and softheaded. Senator McCain attracted many voters because he appeared to be a tough, plainspoken leader. And Mr. Bush, as long as he was promising to be a uniter, not a divider, and to touch every willing heart, didn't have that appearance. Nor could he refute Mr. Gore's contention that he was running on a warm and fuzzy personality rather than on ideas that would benefit the public.</p>
        <p>Of course Mr. Bush all along presented his political philosophy, and not just himself, as compassionate. But that didn't work, either. Conservatism practically begins with the fear that the attempt to express compassion through the state is likely to backfire. It insists instead on the importance of judgment in moral matters and self-reliance in economic ones. Both virtues are in tension with compassion, and even more with the sentimentality that often mistakes itself for compassion. People sense all this instinctively, and recent surveys show that the public considers Mr. Bush no more compassionate than any other Republican and thinks he ''cares'' less about people than Mr. Gore does.</p>
        <p>Compassionate conservatism fails, finally, as a political strategy. It might have worked if the public were so eager to leave the Clinton years behind that it would vote for any reasonably competent Republican who showed that he didn't have fangs. There was no shortage of would-be strategists who believed that the weariness with President Clinton did go that far. But especially after Mr. Gore established himself as his own man at the Democratic Convention, it became necessary for Mr. Bush to advance a more compelling argument.</p>
        <p>Since Labor Day, he has been doing that. He has not stopped claiming that as president he would govern with the interests of all Americans, including minorities and the poor, in mind; nor should he. But he has also made the argument, much more clearly than in the past, that he would serve the values and interests of the middle class better than Mr. Gore would. And those values and interests point toward a smaller federal government.</p>
        <p>So do those of the successful Americans Mr. Gore denigrates as the wealthy. In the national elections in 1998, Republicans lost crucial ground among people in households making more than $75,000 a year -- a quarter of the electorate that year. Now, according to at least one poll, Mr. Bush is winning their votes by 23 points.</p>
        <p>If Mr. Bush is elected, it will not be primarily because of his personality, compassionate or otherwise. It will be because America remains, in crucial respects, a conservative country that wants energetic conservative leaders. Mr. Bush would be wise to remember that, should he move to the White House. After a tumultuous year, he surely appreciates a bedrock truth of conservatism: It's not always fair weather.</p>
