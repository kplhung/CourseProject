      <dateline>SOMEONE left a window open in our clinic one Friday last fall and the Internet blew in over the weekend. So it seemed, at least one week we were plodding along with a single vintage monochrome program on the computers for scheduling and record-keeping; the next week we had every monitor suddenly ablaze with 256 colors, the infinite medical resources of the Web only a push of a button away.
&lt;p&gt;
 Has it made much of a difference?

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>After a year, the jury is still out. We are probably not practicing any better medicine than we were a year ago, wisdom and judgment not being commodities that are easy to download. For lesser things, though, instant Internet access has proved to be a handy, although not entirely risk-free, tool.</p>
        <p>Harvesting medical information off the Web is no less tricky for professionals than it is for anyone else. The snake oil salesmen may be easier to spot, but steering around them still takes time, which is what you don't have in a medical office. No matter the speed of the office computer, long cozy sessions spent browsing interesting links on an unfamiliar topic are still mostly done at home. Work demands simple answers to specific questions -- accurate, complete and delivered instantaneously.</p>
        <p>And, judged by these criteria, even the best parts of the Web can prove a little thin.</p>
        <p>Consider the National Library of Medicine's invaluable site (www.nlm.nih.gov), which allows free searches through more than 11 million articles from 4,000 international medical and scientific journals. Every article written in every important medical journal in the last 45 years has a place on that site -- the contents of every medical library in the world, one might think.</p>
        <p>One would be mistaken. With some exceptions, the articles are not on the site. What it contains are the abstracts of the articles, the short summaries in which the authors of a study outline its bottom line.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, medical articles are long and tedious for a very good reason, which is that every detail of a study, from how participants were selected to how the data was analyzed, can support or invalidate its findings, particularly if they are to be used to guide the treatment of a particular patient.</p>
        <p>A study finds that one heart drug is far more effective than another. But were the people studied fat or thin, black or white, sick or well? How many of them were taking other medications, and which ones were they taking? Was the study by any chance designed and financed by the manufacturer of the very drug it found so useful?</p>
        <p>All these details may influence how seriously a doctor is inclined to take the research, but none of them are likely to make it to the abstract on the computer screen. The only way to get them is to trudge over to the library, dig out the article and read it.</p>
        <p>But how very tempting it is to stay put instead, slumped comfortably in front of the computer, and make decisions from those hundred words on the screen.</p>
        <p>Practicing medicine from the partial information on the Web is as dangerous and addictive a habit for doctors as it is for anyone else. Fortunately, a Web-based recovery program for this vice is on the way. More and more journals are putting every bit of themselves on the Web, from the shortest letter to the longest, most convoluted study, complete with links to relevant commentary.</p>
        <p>Sometimes their contents are free, and sometimes accessible only to subscribers, but medical libraries will often subscribe for patrons. Basic textbooks and collections of so-called practice guidelines that summarize how experts recommend evaluating and treating specific medical problems are also increasingly available for a fee.</p>
        <p>In time, then, the Internet will be able to deliver complete data to the office desk, instead of just detailed instructions on where to look.</p>
        <p>For the moment its big strength may not be its still rather unconvincing imitation of a library, but its much better impersonation of an amiable, dedicated assistant, who takes care of the irritating details that can otherwise bring an afternoon to a screeching halt.</p>
        <p>I have logged on to the Internet hundreds of times at work over the last year -- usually to find articles, sometimes to look at proceedings of conferences I could not attend, occasionally to look at treatment guidelines, and once -- only once -- to take a quick look at a pair of shoes. Only a few times, though, have I really registered a heartfelt surge of gratitude for its existence.</p>
        <p>It let me quickly check the credentials of a plastic surgeon who was heavily pressing one of my patients to undergo an expensive procedure. (His education and training were unimpeachable, it turned out, and the surgery went fine.) It knew the dose adjustments to make when a pair of drugs were used together. It obligingly provided the last name of a doctor whose research I knew well, even if I remembered him only as ''Bob.'' It offered up, with nary a snicker, the bizarre brand name of drug newly approved by the government.</p>
        <p>These may be trivial footnotes to the grand enterprise of the practice of medicine, but they are still the cogs that move the whole business along, and all thanks to anything that can speed them up a bit.</p>
