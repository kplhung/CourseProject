        <p>WHEN Gov. George W. Bush of Texas made a rare visit to Manhattan last week, he did not make time for Leticia Remauro.</p>
        <p>No hurt feelings. Mrs. Remauro, who heads the Bush campaign in New York, knows that she is promoting a candidacy without a candidate. ''George Bush is concentrating on states that are considered swing states,'' Mrs. Remauro said. ''You have to keep your eye on the prize and the prize is the presidency.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush is trailing Vice President Al Gore by a wide margin in New York, according to the polls. Mrs. Remauro is too careful with her words to say so, but the governor has essentially given up on the state. Her job is to soften the defeat (12 points would be much nicer than 20) and worry about the scores of local races that Republicans could win.</p>
        <p>It has been that way since July, when Mrs. Remauro, 37, gave up a job as assistant to the president at Battery Park City to become executive director of New York Victory 2000, the statewide election effort for Mr. Bush and the other Republican candidates. Since then, she has not spoken with him at all. Indeed, the only time she has ever spoken with him, and then only for a few moments, was before the March primary, while waiting to be photographed at a fund-raiser.</p>
        <p>They also hugged, which made a far greater impression on Mrs. Remauro than the chitchat. Mr. Bush embraced her, Mrs. Remauro said, because he saw Gov. George E. Pataki do the same and thought it would be funny.</p>
        <p>Apparently it was.</p>
        <p>''Governor Bush said: 'Leticia! I want one of those hugs!' '' she recalled, laughing about it all over again. ''He showed me his sense of humor and his warm side right there. We had hysterical smirks on our faces when the photograph was taken.'' (It now hangs on the wall of her Republican chairwoman's office in Staten Island, which she visits in the evening after finishing work at the New York Victory 2000 headquarters on Park Avenue in Manhattan.)</p>
        <p>Mrs. Remauro is not slighted by Mr. Bush's apparent lack of attention to her work. Indeed, she goes out of her way not to get in his way. She has made no effort to appear on his schedule and sent others on her staff to cheer him on at the ''Late Show With David Letterman'' last week.</p>
        <p>Why bother? is the obvious question. He has more important things to do, is her emphatic answer.</p>
        <p>AND she is comfortable on the sidelines. Her volunteer post as the party chairwoman for Staten Island rarely attracts the spotlight. She has also worked in low-visibility political jobs as community representative in Staten Island and Brooklyn for both Mr. Pataki and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.</p>
        <p>The only time Mrs. Remauro ran for public office, for State Assembly in the 60th District, she took a thrashing. She considers her proudest political accomplishment having managed a victory for Mr. Bush in Staten Island in the March primary despite Borough President Guy V. Molinari's support for Senator John McCain.</p>
        <p>''It was very wise for our next president to pick someone from Staten Island for this job,'' she said, not the least bit boastfully. ''You can say what you want about Staten Island, but Staten Island is a microcosm of the state and we win races for Republicans.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Remauro says her greatest insights into politics came from working behind the bar at an Italian restaurant that she and her parents once owned in Staten Island. The frustration of fighting government red tape at the restaurant, along with her struggle to arrange schooling for her physically disabled son, now 17, propelled her into politics, she said.</p>
        <p>''Being a bartender, you get to know what is on people's minds,'' she said. ''It does prepare you. This business is about people and understanding how to relate to people. I draw on that experience often.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Remauro, no matter how capable (or huggable), might not be Mr. Bush's point person in New York if New York were one of those swing states she talks about. But that does not bother her. She works as if New York is a battleground. When she was hired for the job, which pays $1,730 a week, Mr. Bush was nearly 30 points behind Mr. Gore in some polls. Mrs. Remauro could have resigned herself to a yawner.</p>
        <p>But Mrs. Remauro has refused to go to sleep. Indeed, she is lucky if she gets five hours a night. (Her definition of an early evening is when she makes it home in time to watch ''Friends'' at 11.) Her cigarette habit has grown from one pack a day to two. She has also put on 20 pounds. (She blames her husband's cooking.)</p>
        <p>And then there's the abuse that comes with being a political maven: She was recently pelted with popcorn at a restaurant when she asked that one of the televisions be switched from a Yankees game to a Bush-Gore debate.</p>
        <p>Can this campaign possibly be worth it?</p>
        <p>''The perk to this job is knowing that I can sleep at night because I will have a good president,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Without a presidential contender on hand, delivering the votes for Mr. Bush has meant worrying about a lot of little things. Her outer office in Manhattan is piled high with wooden stakes for lawn signs. The problem is that she is out of signs. She also has requests for Bush-Cheney campaign buttons, but she has run out of them as well.</p>
        <p>Except for a button on her bulletin board, Mrs. Remauro does not have a picture of Mr. Bush at her Park Avenue office. Instead, when she needs inspiration, she opens a toy coffin on the windowsill. Inside are newspaper clippings showing Mr. Gore, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman and Hillary Rodham Clinton.</p>
        <p>The coffin lid reads: R.I.P.</p>
