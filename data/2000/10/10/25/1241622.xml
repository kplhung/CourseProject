        <p>MIA HAMM FOUNDATION,</p>
        <p>(www.miafoundation.org)  Soccer star raises bone-marrow disease awareness</p>
        <p>In the annals of sports stars, Mia Hamm is a bona fide legend. At 15, she was the youngest woman to play on the United States women's soccer team and led squads to an Olympic gold medal in 1996, a World Cup championship in 1999 and an Olympic silver medal this year. In 1997, Ms. Hamm's brother Garrett died of aplastic anemia, a bone marrow disease. In 1999, she formed the Mia Foundation to heighten awareness for such diseases and to promote opportunities for young women in sports.</p>
        <p>The Mia Foundation Web site was designed as a ''functional tool to learn about the causes we support and to find ways to work with us to further our mission,'' said Dan Levy, the executive director of the foundation. The site includes information on bone marrow diseases; it also provides links to organizations that work with patients and links to places where people can donate bone marrow.</p>
        <p>In addition, there is a ''Girls in sports info'' section.</p>
