        <p>''Proof,'' a Manhattan Theater Club production that was presented off Broadway last spring, reopened on Broadway yesterday at the Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street. Following are excerpts of a review by Bruce Weber that appeared on May 24.</p>
        <p>''Proof,'' an exhilarating and assured new play by David Auburn, turns the esoteric world of higher mathematics literally into a back porch drama, one that is as accessible and compelling as a detective story. The play is fundamentally a mystery about the authorship of a particularly important proof, a mystery that is solved in the end; it is also, however, about the unravelable enigma of genius, and the toll it can take on those who are beset with it, aspire to it or merely live in its vicinity.</p>

        <p>''Proof,'' a Manhattan Theater Club production that was presented off Broadway last spring, reopened on Broadway yesterday at the Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street. Following are excerpts of a review by Bruce Weber that appeared on May 24.</p>
        <p>''Proof,'' an exhilarating and assured new play by David Auburn, turns the esoteric world of higher mathematics literally into a back porch drama, one that is as accessible and compelling as a detective story. The play is fundamentally a mystery about the authorship of a particularly important proof, a mystery that is solved in the end; it is also, however, about the unravelable enigma of genius, and the toll it can take on those who are beset with it, aspire to it or merely live in its vicinity.</p>
        <p>In that service, the play takes great pains to depict the study of mathematics as a painful joy, not as the geek-making obsession of stereotype but as human labor, both ennobling and humbling, and in so doing makes the argument that mathematics is a business for the common heart as well as the uncommon brain.</p>
        <p>As directed by Daniel Sullivan and performed by an exemplary cast, ''Proof'' has the pace of a psychological thriller, and if its resolution tilts toward the sentimental, the characters deserve to be hopeful.</p>
        <p>At the center of the play is Catherine, a young woman who is about to bury her father, a once-great mathematician at the University of Chicago whose final years were beset by madness. Played with stirring unsettledness by Mary-Louise Parker, Catherine has inherited her father's handwriting, his humor and, to an indeterminate degree, both his genius and illness.</p>
        <p>''A taste for the mysteries of numbers is excessively rare,'' the German mathematician Karl Friedrich Gauss wrote to Sophie Germain, a gifted young French woman, some 200 years ago. Catherine has the letter memorized. Its acknowledgment that such a predilection is particularly rare in women is a source of pride and inspiration to her, but it makes her fearful as well; she has witnessed firsthand the jumble that mathematics can make of a working brain.</p>
        <p>Having quit her own studies years earlier to care for her father, she is, as we see her first on the eve of the funeral -- and her 25th birthday -- at the intersection of a haunting past and blank future. Drinking cheap Champagne from the bottle on the back porch of the house she now lives in alone -- to anyone who knows Chicago, John Lee Beatty's staunch, brick set will locate the play precisely -- she is disheveled, bitter, immobilized by depression.</p>
        <p>She is herself only with her father (Larry Bryggman), who appears intermittently in both flashbacks and dreams, scenes performed by Mr. Bryggman and Ms. Parker with the sad -- and occasionally droll -- resignation of people holding on to a lifeline of mutual understanding. With everyone else, Catherine is an intimidating presence, except that her body language, in Ms. Parker's performance, can't help but be a fetching plea for salvation. Her inner conflict determinedly keeps at bay her well-meaning sister, Claire (Johanna Day), a nonmathematician who is understandably exasperated by her sister's obstinate antics.</p>
        <p>Fortunately for Catherine, she is being courted, shyly but insistently, by Hal Dobbs (Ben Shenkman), a former student of her father's who has been going through the great man's notebooks hoping to find unpublished revelations. In a role written both to acknowledge and debunk the stereotype of the socially inept math nerd, Mr. Shenkman wonderfully evokes the hesitant charm of a young man whose self-awareness tells him that he is more than brainy but less than suave.</p>
        <p>Do Catherine and Hal belong together? That, pardon the expression, is a complex equation for any two people to solve. As their mutual affection and trust waxes and wanes over the course of an autumn weekend, the issue of genius -- who has it and what does it portend? -- turns out to be the elusive variable. Ultimately this is emotional math, the sort that everyone and no one understands. Without any baffling erudition, ''Proof'' reaches into remote cerebral terrain and finds -- guess what? -- good people. Intelligence a virtue? Q.E.D.</p>
