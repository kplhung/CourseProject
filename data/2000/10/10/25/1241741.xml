        <p>An off-duty police officer fatally shot a 21-year-old Brooklyn woman after she and her mother attacked him with a baseball bat and a pool cue, the police said.</p>
        <p>The shooting took place in the first-floor hallway of an apartment building at 1185 DeKalb Avenue in the Bushwick section, where the woman, Carmen Valentine, lived with her family on the fourth floor, the police said. Relatives of the officer, Hailoon Wang, live on the first floor, and the two families have feuded for about a year and a half, the police said.</p>
        <p>Investigators said that as Officer Wang was leaving the building at about 9 p.m. Monday, he encountered Ms. Valentine and her mother, Benigna Valentine. The three exchanged words, although it is not clear what was said.</p>
        <p>As the off-duty officer was getting into his car, a porcelain figurine was thrown from the building, narrowly missing him. Officer Wang went back inside. Carmen and Benigna Valentine met him in the foyer and began to assault him with a bat and a pool cue, the authorities said. It was not clear which woman carried which weapon.</p>
        <p>Hearing the commotion, Officer Wang's stepfather, William Vargas, 61, stepped out of his first-floor apartment and intervened in the dispute, the authorities said. The women then began to assault him as well, continuing to beat the men after Officer Wang identified himself as a police officer.</p>
        <p>At that point, the officer pulled out the 9-millimeter pistol he carries while off-duty, firing twice and hitting Carmen Valentine in the chest and abdomen, the authorities said. The wounds perforated several major organs, said Ellen S. Borakove, a spokeswoman for the city's chief medical examiner. Ms. Valentine was pronounced dead at Woodhull Medical and Mental Health Center.</p>
        <p>The two men were treated for bruises at Wyckoff Heights Medical Center and released, the police said.</p>
        <p>Benigna Valentine was charged with second-degree assault, the authorities said. A spokesman for the Brooklyn district attorney said no bail would be set.</p>
        <p>Police Commissioner Bernard B. Kerik said Officer Wang's use of force appeared justified, although the police were investigating.</p>
        <p>Officer Wang, who joined the department in 1995 and is assigned to the 23rd Precinct, has not yet been formally questioned, but was taken off patrol duty, the police said.</p>
        <p>He has not been involved in shootings before, said Sgt. Gerry Falcon, a police spokeswoman.</p>
        <p>One building resident, Milagros Candelaria, described a volatile feud in which Mr. Vargas and Carmen Valentine would insult and curse each other. In particular, she said, Mr. Vargas complained that Carmen Valentine and her twin sister played loud music and stomped noisily through the building.</p>
        <p>The feud intensified about a year and a half ago, Ms. Candelaria said, when Carmen Valentine returned home at 3 a.m. without her keys and rapped on Mr. Vargas's window, waking him and asking that he let her into the building. A week or two later, the two had their first ''huge blowup'' after Carmen Valentine blasted music from her car, which was parked outside the building, she said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Vargas could not be reached at his apartment yesterday afternoon.</p>
