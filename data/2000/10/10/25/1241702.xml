        <p>A former prime minister of the Netherlands, Ruud Lubbers, will be nominated to be United Nations high commissioner for refugees by Secretary General Kofi Annan, Dutch government officials said today.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lubbers, who was an unsuccessful candidate for NATO secretary general and for president of the European Commission in recent years, would be a surprise choice for the agency, which assists 30 million refugees and people displaced within their own countries. His name did not figure in a list of candidates circulating here for several months.</p>
        <p>The high commissioner for refugees, who is based in Geneva and is appointed to five-year terms, holds one of the most important jobs in the United Nations. The role of the commissioner's large agency, with a budget of nearly $1 billion and staff of about 5,000 working in more than 120 countries, has grown in importance during the last decade of civil war, as millions of people have been driven from their homes in Africa, Europe and Asia.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lubbers would replace Sadako Ogata, a Japanese academic and diplomat whose term is ending. She has held the job for nearly a decade.</p>
        <p>The secretary general's nominee must be approved by the 189-member General Assembly.</p>
        <p>At the United Nations, Mr. Annan's spokesman, Fred Eckhard, said that an appointment would be announced on Wednesday, but he declined to identify the nominee. However officials here and in The Hague said that Mr. Lubbers had been asked to come to New York as soon as possible.</p>
        <p>''In all likelihood, the Netherlands will lay claim to the post,'' the Dutch prime minister, Wim Kok, said on Dutch television today.</p>
        <p>The appointment of Mr. Lubbers, 61, prime minister of the Netherlands from 1982 to 1994, would add another high-level political leader to Mr. Annan's team of administrators. In 1997, the secretary general named Mary Robinson, a former president of Ireland, as high commissioner for human rights. Dr. Gro Harlem Brundtland, a former Norwegian prime minister and public health expert, was elected director general of the World Health Organization in 1998 by that body's board.</p>
