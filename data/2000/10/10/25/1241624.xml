        <p>FELICIA GRIFFIN intends to hoard a little holiday cheer for herself this year when she buys gifts. Her strategy is to shop with a select group of online merchants -- those who share a percentage of the purchase price in a rebate that will be invested in a choice of mutual funds.</p>
        <p>''This way I can be a consumer and reward myself,'' said Ms. Griffin, a 34-year-old business-conference planner from Dallas. Since last spring, she has been accumulating shares in a growth mutual fund offered through SaveDaily.com of Irvine, Calif.</p>
        <p>SaveDaily is among a handful of start-up financial-service companies that are using the Internet to convert shopping loyalty programs into something more substantial than frequent-flier credits. They may also be a tool to draw lower-income households online and into the financial mainstream.</p>
        <p>''Isn't it about time, if we're the locomotive of the global economy, that we get something back?'' asked Eric A. Solis, the chairman and chief executive of SaveDaily. ''If we can get back just 4 percent on our planned consumption, we can double the savings rate.''</p>
        <p>The notion of using everyday shopping for online microinvesting, of pennies or dollars, is surfacing at a time when politicians and public-policy experts are pushing to provide lower-income and low-saving customers access to financial tools.</p>
        <p>''One of the things that stops banks from developing products for this market is because the costs are too high relative to the balances,'' said Michael A. Stegman, the author of ''Saving for the Poor: Hidden Benefits of Electronic Banking.''</p>
        <p>Whether the account is for check writing, stock trading or mutual funds, the rule of thumb in the financial services industry is that it costs as much to service a $100,000 account as a $1 million account. A result is financial products geared mainly for higher-income people.</p>
        <p>''Our competitive advantage is being built from Day 1 to be a very low-cost provider'' to small savers, said Mr. Solis, a former financial adviser in Indian Wells, Calif., who grew frustrated at having to turn away advice-seeking friends because they lacked what are considered adequate resources.</p>
        <p>By comparison, little is required of SaveDaily's microinvestors, other than a checking account and a credit card.</p>
        <p>SaveDaily's site offers its 6,000 clients two ways to invest with its mutual fund partners. Clients can make direct deposits of any amount from their checking accounts by electronic transfer. Or clients can earn retail credits of 1 percent to 10 percent at SaveDaily's 80 retail partners, like J. C. Penney, Barnes &amp; Noble and the Sharper Image. In the last year, SaveDaily clients cumulatively invested about $2 million in funds managed by the Pacific Investment Management Company, or Pimco; Berger Funds; and ING Group. Investors never see a paper statement or a transaction charge, though they are charged an annual fee of 1 percent of assets, comparable to the fees banks charge their best customers.</p>
        <p>''It's virtually no cost to us,'' said Greg A. Bishop, a vice president for Pimco in Newport Beach, Calif., explaining that SaveDaily customers are pooled into a single account. ''It's another distribution opportunity,'' he said. Pimco funds are generally marketed through financial planners and broker-dealers, who charge a fee or a commission, unlike SaveDaily. ''If we do our job and deliver good financial results, potentially there's an opportunity for brand building'' with SaveDaily customers, he said.</p>
        <p>For people who realize they are under-saving, these loyalty rebate programs appear to be a way to start a nest egg without changing one's buying habits. A Citicorp survey showed that 80 percent of the population is interested in saving for either college or for retirement.</p>
        <p>Mary L. Bennett, a self-employed recruiter in Redondo Beach, Calif., has retirement accounts elsewhere, but uses SaveDaily as a place to save for quarterly estimated tax payments and a house-buying kitty. ''Since it's so easy to put it in and out, that's how I feel it's best utilized,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Yet, with such tiny investments, ''a lot of people are going to get discouraged because they won't see very much growth,'' said Shaw Lively, a financial services analyst for International Data Corporation in Boston. But with a long investment horizon, even a 3 percent rebate off a $100 weekly shopping tab compounded at 8 percent over 15 years amounts to about $8,000. ''Providers must put as much or more effort into nurturing a customer as they put into acquiring one,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The challenge, Mr. Lively said, will be to keep customers investing, to have a stable of national merchants in which people will shop and not suffer a nose dive in the stock market. ''I think they're well aware a downturn is a risk to their business model,'' Mr. Lively said, although none of the companies he has looked at have yet to focus on a plan for investor hand-holding and education.</p>
        <p>Another risk would come from a competitor who already has high name recognition in either Internet commerce or finance, which could quickly dominate the nascent industry. ''If AOL or Fidelity decides to do it, they're dead,'' Mr. Lively said, referring to SaveDaily. (Fidelity says it wouldn't consider such a rebate plan, but it is making one of its funds available to clients of UPromise.com, a competitor of SaveDaily based in Boston.)</p>
        <p>UPromise has a slightly different microinvesting strategy: to help families save for college by accumulating retail rebates online and off-line in a tax-deferred fund. The brainchild of a marketing entrepreneur, Michael Bronner, the site is to be activated in November and expects to be available nationally in the first quarter of 2001. It will adapt the idea of pooling frequent-flier spending credits offered by participating merchants.</p>
        <p>Once enrolled, UPromise users can direct their purchase credits from a wide variety of merchants, even grocers and gas stations, into mutual funds managed by Fidelity; Citigroup's Salomon Smith Barney; TIAA-Cref, a teachers' pension fund; and Merrill Lynch. Among merchants UPromise has signed up are a computermaker, telephone company and major credit card merchant. Besides getting a rebate from UPromise retailers, customers using the credit card, whose identity UPromise has not disclosed, will get a second rebate from the card company. Customers will also be able to invest cash directly in mutual funds offered through UPromise.</p>
        <p>ALTHOUGH college-savings plans, also known as 529 plans, came into law in 1996, they are still little known because of inadequate marketing by the 41 states that offer them, said Liz Carpenter, a UPromise spokeswoman. Yet in a May survey underwritten by UPromise, only 29 percent of parents said they felt prepared to cover the cost of sending their children to college. On average, to send two children to college costs $87,000 for a public college and $189,000 to a private campus, according to the College Board.</p>
        <p>''It seems like a good marketing device for their partners, and a nice benefit for consumers who get the rebate tacked onto their college savings account,'' said Joseph Hurley, a Pittsford, N.Y., accountant who established a Web site, savingforcollege .com, which focuses on 529 plans.</p>
        <p>Another wrinkle comes from Customerowner.com and Stockback.com, both sites still under development, which plan to offer e-commerce patrons rebates that are actual shares of a merchant or in a mutual fund.</p>
        <p>State Street Global Advisors will manage the proposed fund for patrons of Customerowner.com, which is currently in registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission, according to a report by Mr. Lively, the analyst. About 35 retailers, including CVS Pharmacy, Lands' End, Office Max and Sony are offering rebates to Customerowner.com's customers.</p>
        <p>Stockback and Customerowner will be attractive to customers with strong retail loyalties, but a drawback is that customers end up with little diversification in their portfolios.</p>
        <p>''It's innovative, but is it sustainable?'' asked Matt Carrick, a financial services analyst for Gomez Advisors, an Internet research company in Lincoln, Mass. ''I'm not sure it can take off without a lot of marketing money,'' he said.</p>
