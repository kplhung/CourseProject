        <p>I DIDN'T bat an eye when I learned that my Web site would be on a server company called Laughingsquid.net. Stranger things had crawled across my computer screen along the way.</p>
        <p>I had never created a Web site. Even though I live in rural Nevada, I recently produced a video documentary about Brazil, far from any dot-com hub. But I rely on the Internet to stay in touch with that world, and I hoped the Net could bring the film to other people who live off the beaten path.</p>
        <p>Becoming a video producer had been accidental. As a photojournalist, I had spent a year in Brazil. So I was captivated by the autobiography of Benedita da Silva, a powerhouse of a woman who had risen from the shanties of Rio de Janeiro to become  the first black woman to be elected to the Senate in Brazil. When I met her at a book party in San Francisco, I knew her story would make a great film.</p>
        <p>Global Exchange, a nonprofit group in San Francisco, agreed to sponsor the film. I offered to raise money to send a crew to Rio during the annual carnival. There, a 3,000-member samba school was honoring Mrs. da Silva, Pele, Nelson Mandela and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Our crew spent three weeks filming Mrs. da Silva in her shantytown and in the Senate.</p>
        <p>The film, ''I Was Born a Black Woman,'' was a daughter of the Internet. E-mail messages flew between Maisa Mendonca and Vicente Franco, the directors in California, and me in Nevada. We received digital photographs from Rio. We ordered archival film over the Net. After their day jobs, the directors spent countless nights editing on the computer.</p>
        <p>So it made sense to use the Internet to promote our documentary. I was confident about using e-mail to announce screenings. But I still had questions about creating a Web site. I knew that it had become a must for commercial films. But for our film (total budget about $100,000), was it worth the time and expense? Or would it just be a filmmaker's vanity project?</p>
        <p>In New York, where our movie had its premiere as part of the Human Rights Watch International Film Festival, filmmakers were enthusiastic about Web sites, although no one could quite quantify their benefits. I thought I detected a healthy dose of the blind faith so many filmmakers bring to their craft.</p>
        <p>Andrea Holley, the manager of the Human Rights Watch traveling film festival, was especially encouraging. She gave me a list of film Web sites to check out and urged me to use streaming video, which allows Web site visitors to see a little bit of your film online.</p>
        <p>At the film festival, I gained an appreciation for the connections among people doing human rights work. There were films from India, Lebanon, Argentina and other countries, many extending their message with Web sites. I realized that such sites can slip quietly across borders and directly into people's homes and offices. In some places, they are the most democratic medium available.</p>
        <p>This tipped the scales for me. I believed that our Web site could bring our message on race and human rights to people in situations I couldn't even imagine. I took the leap.</p>
        <p>Back home in Nevada I did some research. On the Film Arts Foundation Web site (www.filmarts.org), I read transcripts of forums on how to use the Web. I perused lists of Web experts, search engines and how-to articles. I looked up the film sites that Ms. Holley had recommended. The first one crashed before the home page made it onto my screen. Others took five minutes to load. The broadband revolution has not yet made it to my house, and I resented waiting for overly artsy Web sites.</p>
        <p>On one site, I clicked on the video clip option and settled back, ready to be entertained. Instead, my computer gave me a lot of back talk about why it couldn't show me moving pictures. This harangue was followed by the aimless arrow indicating that I had crashed once again.</p>
        <p>After bouts of extreme frustration, I asked my husband for help in downloading QuickTime and Real Player, which took 45 minutes each to do. Using this free software, I could now see and hear a video image the size of a postage stamp. It had been squeezed through eight miles of phone line to my laptop and a 56K modem. After such a rough trip, the video was naturally jumpy and distorted.</p>
        <p>One Web site that worked well was www.garageolimpo.it, for an Italian film about the people in Argentina who disappeared during the military junta from 1976 to 1983. It is elaborate and mostly in Italian, but is easy to navigate, with great graphics and clearly marked information that any system can retrieve. There are lots of stills and audio and video options.</p>
        <p>Looking at sites that worked and those that didn't helped me plan ours. I wanted it to be informative and quick, even for the digitally impaired. It would tell all about our film and where to see it, and about the crew and how to contact us. It would offer a one-minute video clip, photographs and music. It would link to our film's sponsor, Global Exchange (www.globalexchange.org), which distributes the autobiography of Mrs. da Silva, and to other human rights and film groups.</p>
        <p>Then I needed a Web address, the site's name. I wanted something simple and memorable, but searching through Network Solutions, which registers domain names, I found that sex sites had snapped up most of the Brazil film names. I finally decided on www.iwasbornablackwoman .com, for which I pay $35 a year. I also grabbed www.imagesofbrazil .com for possible future use.</p>
        <p>We now had a video, a domain name, text and stills ready to post on the Web site. Then came the next crucial decision in building a site -- deciding to pay an expert to design it. I called my friend Chris Carlsson, a Web designer in San Francisco. He agreed to work at a cut rate -- $1,500 for the whole site -- for a good cause and because he wanted to learn some new software. He cursed streaming video but agreed to find a hosting company, which would make the site available through its computer servers, that could run it.</p>
        <p>Chris told me what we would need. For the site's one-minute video clip, I chose three parts lasting less than 20 seconds each. Longer segments take forever to materialize and cause crashes. I sent the site's text to Chris by e-mail and took the video and stills to his office in San Francisco.</p>
        <p>We wanted a dynamic beginning that would reflect the vitality of Benedita da Silva and life in her shantytown neighborhood above Rio's famous beaches. Using Flash animation, Chris designed an opening sequence that explodes with music and features the film's title in huge yellow words appearing and disappearing on a green field. These are the national colors of Brazil, and they're lively and easy to read. The title appears in Portuguese, ''Nasci Mulher Negra,'' with the English title popping up below. Even though the introduction is short, we added an option for skipping it.</p>
        <p>Chris scanned the printed photographs, and lifted others from CD-ROM and Zip-drive disks I had brought. After the titles, still photographs of Mrs. da Silva and African-Brazilian life move in and out, while a voice-over describes the film. Stills let you dominate the screen and offer much more detail than you can with streaming video.</p>
        <p>One goal was to offer video that would stream nicely on less computer power. To lighten the video load, Chris reduced the number of frames per second. The video should work well for most computers but may seem jagged to broadband viewers.</p>
        <p>It took time to find a server that could handle video at a good price. Laughingsquid.net would do it for $20 a month, so we signed on. In a few days www.iwasbornablackwoman .com was online.</p>
        <p>Even before our Web site was up I was receiving requests for it. People from a Korean film festival wanted information. The United Nations Association Film Festival wanted to link to it. Global Justice, a Brazilian human rights group, asked for our Web address. I was thrilled to realize that people around the globe could learn about ''I Was Born a Black Woman'' on the Web.</p>
