        <p>The Cadillac Of Chronographs</p>
        <p>BERNIE CHASE, the classic-car dealer who bid $340,000 for ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER'S wristwatch on Monday, did not get what he wanted yesterday: He dropped out of the bidding on a 10-karat diamond at $150,000. It went for $195,000.</p>
        <p>That left him to talk about what to do with the titanium-and-gold chronograph he had bought at a charity auction at Christie's on Monday. He said he was considering putting it in one of his car showrooms in California.</p>
        <p>''When it started getting crazily priced,'' he said, ''I told myself, 'Jump out or just buy it for the cause.' I kind of didn't know I was going to buy it. I went in looking at the inexpensive watches.''</p>
        <p>The inexpensive watches were in the five-figure category.</p>
        <p>One from JON BON JOVI went for $20,000; another, from MARIAH CAREY, sold for $21,000. One donated by MUHAMMAD ALI sold for $220,000.</p>
        <p>Like Kicking Sand In Their Faces</p>
        <p>This sounds like a ''Beach Party'' movie from the 1960's: carefree images of certain young people with gleaming white teeth rocking and rolling on the beach, followed by the inevitable complication involving FRANKIE AVALON and ANNETTE FUNICELLO.</p>
        <p>The carefree images appeared in a brochure for Macy's employees. The complication is a lawsuit that Ms. Funicello and Mr. Avalon filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court, accusing Macy's and its parent company, Federated Department Stores, of using the photographs without their permission. They demand payments of $250,000 apiece.</p>
        <p>The Associated Press said the lawsuit contended that Mr. Avalon and Ms. Funicello would ''continue to suffer embarrassment and humiliation from being exploited in such a reckless and cavalier manner'' if Macy's did not stop using the photographs.</p>
        <p>RINA NEIMAN, a spokeswoman for Macy's, said: ''All we know is there was a complaint filed, but we haven't see it, so I have nothing to tell you. I don't even know what the brochure was.''</p>
        <p>He's Just Faking It</p>
        <p>The question for the actor ADAM GOLDBERG, one of the hard-charging financial types on the new Fox drama ''The Street,'' was whether he understood Wall Street and the stock market terms he had to use on camera.</p>
        <p>His answer was, ''I have no idea.''</p>
        <p>He said at a Manhattan party after the screening of the first episode that he had tried for a lifeline. He bought a book about the market, but reading it was ''an exercise in futility,'' he said.</p>
        <p>DARREN STAR, the producer who created ''The Street'' (and whose credits also include ''Sex and the City'') said he started learning the financial lingo when he went to his first meeting with his new broker.</p>
        <p>''In walked this great-looking 26-year-old guy,'' Mr. Star said. ''I thought, 'These are the guys running up real estate prices.' I had expected to see a guy who looked like my father.''</p>
        <p>Cocktail Accessory</p>
        <p>On the way into the preview party for the International Fine Arts and Antiques Show at the Seventh Regiment Armory the other night, the soprano JESSYE NORMAN greeted MUFFIE POTTER ASTON, MARY CARPENTER, NAN KEMPNER, PAT BUCKLEY and JAMIE NIVEN, all of whom had helped organize the preview, a benefit for Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. Then Ms. Norman moved toward BARBARA de PORTAGO, the vice president of the Versailles/Giverny Foundation, and took a blue drink.</p>
        <p>''I'm not drinking it,'' she announced. ''I'm just carrying it because it matches.'' The drink was, indeed, the color of her blue Givenchy suit.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Buckley accepted a green drink from a waiter, took a sip and announced with delight, ''It's melon-flavored.'' She got it just in time. Someone jostled the waiter and his tray went down with a crash.</p>
        <p>Gridiron Blahs</p>
        <p>After a barrage of questions about the Subway Series, TIKI BARBER countered with a question of his own.</p>
        <p>''Does anyone know it's football season?'' Barber, the running back for the New York Giants, said at a party  for the Inner-City Games Foundation at Club New York the other night. Then he brightened: ''This is what it would be like if we ever had a Giants and Jets Super Bowl.''</p>

        <p>Correction:  October 26, 2000, Thursday  Because of an editing error, a report on the Public Lives page yesterday about a party for the International Fine Arts and Antiques Show at the Seventh Regiment Armory referred incorrectly to two guests. The soprano Jessye Norman declined the red, blue and green drinks that were being served in martini glasses. It was Barbara de Portago, vice president of the Versailles/ Giverny Foundation, who joked about her blue drink's matching her Givenchy suit.</p>
