        <p>ROSIE O'DONNELL  (www.rosieo.warnerbros.com)</p>
        <p>Talk show host mixes show business with social conscience</p>
        <p>Rosie O'Donnell has steered her show to the top of daytime TV by combining star power and friendly banter with issues that are important to her. Her enthusiastic promotion of the theater has helped to bring Broadway to mass audiences, while her support for children's causes -- including the For All Kids Foundation, a charity she founded in 1997 to help disadvantaged children -- is apparent to any regular viewer.</p>
        <p>This blend of entertainment and issues can be found on the show's official site at Warner Brothers Online. It promotes her guests and provides ticket information, backstage gossip, recipes from Ms. O'Donnell, a crafts corner, penny arcade games and a frequently asked questions link. The home page also features ''Rosie's Views,'' a section that provides links to information on topics including adoption, foster care, breast cancer, voter registration, gun control and charities.</p>

        <p>The site provides a link to a continuing For All Kids charity auction, in partnership with eBay, which sells autographed merchandise from the show. A holiday compact disk called ''Another Rosie Christmas,'' featuring Ms. O'Donnell and musicians including Ricky Martin, Jewel, Donna Summer, Barry Manilow and the Dixie Chicks, will be promoted on the show and the Web site, with part of the proceeds going to For All Kids. Ms. O'Donnell also maintains a site on America Online (keyword: Rosie).</p>
