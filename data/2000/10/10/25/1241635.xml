        <p>IT is a paradox of the new Internet economy. Thousands of companies have begun to participate in hundreds of new business-to-business exchanges, buying and selling supplies and products and achieving new economic efficiencies, creating a more transparent marketplace that holds great promise for better prices, lower costs, faster production and greater competition.</p>
        <p>But experts have been warning that the same technological advances that make such exchanges more popular and efficient also could make it easier for there to be collusion among rivals, price fixing and other anti-competitive conduct that could  lead to higher prices and less competition -- and would be harder to trace.</p>
        <p>''To the extent there may be a serpent in the Garden of Eden, it is this,'' said Robert Pitofsky, the chairman of the Federal Trade Commission. ''Whenever you put competitors together in a joint venture, you have to ask what information is being exchanged? Will it facilitate collusion?''</p>
        <p>When the business-to-business markets are formed as joint ventures by traditional rivals, they cannot operate without government approval, and in recent weeks, officials in Washington and Europe have announced their views on the first of what promises to be a long line of proposals.  American and European antitrust officials have moved cautiously, approving in principle the formation of the first joint ventures for the exchanges with caveats that they will be closely watched as they come online.</p>
        <p>In approving the establishment of Covisint, an online venture that would allow five major automakers to buy supplies through a single Internet portal, the trade commission warned that it would continue to monitor the venture for possible anti-competitive issues after it opens . Automakers are expected to use the site to list parts they seek from suppliers, which would then offer bids to secure a contract in a procedure commonly referred to as a reverse auction. The participants include Ford, General Motors, DaimlerChrylser, Nissan Motor of Japan and Renault of France. They have said Covisint may wield enormous purchasing power, accounting for $240 billion each year.</p>
        <p>A few weeks before that, the European Commission approved the formation of MYAircraft.com, a joint venture by United Technologies, Honeywell and the software company i2 Technologies that would allow aerospace companies to trade parts and services.</p>
        <p>Antitrust experts say that they have three main concerns about the rise of such exchanges, which are appearing in industries ranging from steel, construction and chemicals to retailing and consumer goods. First, they may exclude some companies, limiting competition. Second, they may require that companies use one exchange exclusively and shun all others, creating one dominant exchange that would have too much power.</p>
        <p>But the largest concern among consumer advocates and some experts is that buyers or sellers would collude on pricing and take steps to set prices in unison. The experts worry that because rival companies can see pricing information faster than in other markets, it is easier to coordinate prices without ever speaking to one another.</p>
        <p>''The biggest fear is that there is a coordination of prices by companies and that, as a result of the new technology, the companies will leave no tracks,'' said Albert A. Foer, president of the American Antitrust Institute, a Washington research organization. ''With these exchanges, we're seeing a Cambrian explosion of new animal forms, in all industries, and all at once. If we allow it to happen with businesses calling all the shots and no government intervention, it may be impossible to curtail problems later.''</p>
        <p>Lawyers working on these ventures for the companies say there is little to worry about as long as the exchanges are structured properly and adequate safeguards are put in place.</p>
        <p>William Baer, a former antitrust official at the trade commission who has advised health care companies and retailers on business-to-business antitrust issues, said that the potential antitrust issues posed by exchanges were not novel to the Internet but had been seen in more traditional markets.</p>
        <p>The biggest concern, he said, is if competitors are able to coordinate their pricing by learning in advance of the prices being offered by their rivals.</p>
        <p>''As long as you aren't disclosing in advance your pricing information, then you should be able to deal with that antitrust risk,'' said Mr. Baer, a partner at the law firm of Arnold &amp; Porter.</p>
        <p>The issue is hardly novel. In 1994, six large airlines settled charges brought by the Justice Department that they had used a computerized reservation system to fix fares. The airlines agreed to end the practice of communicating proposed fare increases through the system maintained by the Airline Tariff Publishing Company.</p>
        <p>To some extent, Mr. Baer and other experts said, the experience with the slightly older business-to-consumer exchanges is instructive of antitrust issues confronting the business-to-business marketplace.</p>
        <p>In recent months, several companies with online operations have begun to face scrutiny by antitrust officials for possible anti-competitive conduct. The investigations often involve complaints filed by rivals and occasionally reflect tensions between Internet start-up companies and older, more established businesses.</p>
        <p>Orbitz, an online travel agency being formed by five major airlines, has drawn scrutiny from the Justice Department and Capitol Hill after rivals like Travelocity and Expedia complained that the company would receive preferential treatment, and better fares, from its owners. The owners -- American Airlines, Continental Airlines, Delta Airlines, Northwest Airlines and United Airlines -- deny that they would steer more favorable fares to their online company, which they plan to introduce next summer.</p>
        <p>And other business-to-consumer Web sites in the marine and real estate industries have denied accusations made by more traditional rivals of forming possible anti-competitive relationships.</p>
        <p>Those experiences have not dampened the enthusiasm for business-to-business exchanges, although they have highlighted the need for taking great care in forming them. They have also led to a new and lucrative avenue of business for antitrust lawyers who are called at the formation of such exchanges to provide advice, set up safeguards and head off regulatory concerns.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pitofsky of the trade commision said that when he spoke at a recent conference of general counsels of American companies, he asked how many were setting up business-to-business exchanges, and more than one-third of those in the audience raised their hands.</p>
        <p>''Probably more than 900 companies are now making such plans,'' he estimated, a rise of more than 50 percent in the last few months alone. ''It's amazing how trendy and fashionable these exchanges have suddenly become.''</p>
