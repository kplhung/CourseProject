        <p>A new study questioning the validity of rising student test scores in Texas roiled the presidential race today as aides to Gov. George W. Bush sought to discredit the findings while the campaign of Vice President Al Gore and other Democrats used them to attack Mr. Bush on his signature issue,  education.</p>
        <p>The study, issued by the RAND Corporation, a research organization in Santa Monica, Calif., found that Texas students had demonstrated greater improvement in recent years on the state's Texas Assessment of Academic Skills exam than on the leading national assessment test. The report said these ''stark differences'' in performance raised ''serious questions'' about the credibility of the state test as a meaningful gauge of academic progress.</p>

        <p>A new study questioning the validity of rising student test scores in Texas roiled the presidential race today as aides to Gov. George W. Bush sought to discredit the findings while the campaign of Vice President Al Gore and other Democrats used them to attack Mr. Bush on his signature issue,  education.</p>
        <p>The study, issued by the RAND Corporation, a research organization in Santa Monica, Calif., found that Texas students had demonstrated greater improvement in recent years on the state's Texas Assessment of Academic Skills exam than on the leading national assessment test. The report said these ''stark differences'' in performance raised ''serious questions'' about the credibility of the state test as a meaningful gauge of academic progress.</p>
        <p>The report also found that the achievement gap between white and minority students grew on the national test from 1994 to 1998, even as it narrowed on state test results.</p>
        <p>The report speculated that the state test scores might have been artificially inflated by, among other things, a practice known in educational circles as teaching to the test, or drilling that helps students prepare for specific types of questions but does not result in real learning.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush has made education a centerpiece of his campaign, regularly boasting about the rising test scores in his state, including among black and Hispanic students, as he portrays Texas as a national leader.</p>
        <p>Outside a suburban Chicago middle school where Mr. Bush campaigned today, Karen P. Hughes, the campaign communications director, called the new findings biased and ''dead wrong.'' Ms. Hughes noted that other studies, including a larger July report by RAND, have portrayed Texas students in a good light, particularly in math.</p>
        <p>The ''indisputable independent data all show without a doubt that Texas leads the nation when it comes to improving student performance,'' said Ms. Hughes, who also described the release of the report so close to Election Day as ''highly suspect.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's running mate, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, said the RAND study showed that Mr. Bush had  overstated the progress made by Texas students during his tenure.</p>
        <p>''We all hope and pray for miracles, but they are not occurring in the Texas school system,'' Mr. Lieberman said in a conference call with reporters.</p>
        <p>The reaction to the study reverberated at the headquarters of RAND, which has contended throughout its 52-year history as an independent  organization that it is not influenced by partisan politics. The group not only found itself in the awkward position of explaining how two of its own studies had seemingly reached opposite conclusions but also of justifying the timing of the latest report.</p>
        <p>''If we had sat on it and held it until after the election, we would have been slammed for that,'' said a RAND spokesman, Jess Cook, noting that the release followed the organization's policy.</p>
        <p>In an unusual step, RAND's president and chief executive, James A. Thomson, citing the ''intense controversy, as we expected,'' issued a statement endorsing the findings in the study released today and the July report cited by the Bush campaign. In doing so, he rebutted Ms. Hughes's claim that the July report officially carried the RAND imprimatur but not today's smaller study, which is technically called an Issue Paper.</p>
        <p>''We stand behind the quality of both this paper and of our July report,'' Mr. Thomson said.</p>
        <p>He also emphasized that while the new study ''suggests a less positive picture of Texas education'' than the July report, the two are not actually in ''sharp conflict.''</p>
        <p>The two RAND reports both used the National Assessment of Educational Progress, the nation's leading standardized assessment exam, as a barometer of academic achievement. The studies had some overlap, but essentially had different scopes and methodologies. They agree that Texas students have improved on the  national test during the 1990's, as have students in most states.</p>
        <p>Yet there is disagreement as to whether Texas students surpassed or lagged behind their peers across the nation in terms of progress.</p>
        <p>The 300-page July report, written chiefly by David Grissmer, a RAND scholar, was the larger of the two studies. It grouped students in 44 states by socio-economic status and compared them to their peers based on scores on the national exam from 1990 to 1996.</p>
        <p>The study found that in many categories, Texas students ranked high nationally, particularly in fourth-grade math. In fact, black fourth graders in Texas made bigger gains than their peers in every state on the math portion of the national test in 1996, according to the Grissmer study. The Bush campaign immediately embraced the findings. Laura Bush even mentioned the study in her address to the Republican National Convention.</p>
        <p>The RAND study released today,  at 14 pages, was chiefly written by another RAND scholar, Stephen P. Klein. Using broader categories of race but not economic status, the study examined the gains made by Texas fourth and eighth graders on the national test in reading in 1994 and 1998 as well as in math in 1992 and 1996. It agreed that Texas fourth graders outperformed their peers nationally in math, but found that otherwise student improvement was about average for the nation.</p>
        <p>Unlike the July report, the new study compared the scores on the national test with student performance on the standardized Texas exam, which serves as Texas' principal measuring stick for academic progress. Looking at scores on the Texas test in 1994 and 1998, the study found strikingly large gains in scores, including by minorities. By contrast, the student gains on the national exam were far smaller. And the gap between whites and minorities on the national test grew larger rather than smaller for fourth graders in reading, and for fourth and eighth graders in math.</p>
        <p>''The gains are so much larger on the T.A.A.S. than the N.A.E.P. that you start asking questions about what is going on with the T.A.A.S.,'' Mr. Klein said.</p>
        <p>The study offered no concrete explanation for the scoring differences but speculated that it could be the result of teachers in Texas ''devoting a great deal of class time to highly specific T.A.A.S. preparation.''</p>
        <p>The Gore campaign said the second RAND report was more significant because it included scores from the middle of Mr. Bush's tenure in 1998. Mr. Bush took office in 1995.</p>
        <p>Amy Wilkins, a policy analyst at Education Trust, a liberal group that has praised the Texas system, said Texas was not the only state where gains on the national exam did not match those on state tests. She agreed that Texas lagged in reading but argued that the state ranked among national leaders for improvement on math and writing.</p>
        <p>''Something must be going right in these schools,'' Ms. Wilkins said.</p>
        <p>In Washington, Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the House Democratic leader, and Senator Tom Daschle, the minority leader,  pounced on the study and questioned whether Mr. Bush had exaggerated his record, as his campaign aides have accused Mr. Gore of doing.</p>
        <p>''What Governor Bush has run his whole campaign on is now found to be an exaggeration,'' Mr. Gephardt said outside the White House. ''The students in Texas did not have better scores on the tests than other students around the country.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Daschle added: ''Well, as Dick said, I think really the so-called Texas miracle,'' referring to the nickname that some education groups have given Texas, ''is nothing more than a tall Texas tale.''</p>
