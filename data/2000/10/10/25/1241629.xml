        <p>IT was inevitable, practically preordained. A marriage made in cyberheaven: matchmaking and the Internet.</p>
        <p>''To me it's one of the most valid and appropriate uses of the Internet,'' said Michael Welch, 56, of San Francisco, a development officer at Stanford University, who has subscribed to two matchmaking sites in the last year. ''As opposed to the newspaper personals, it gives people an opportunity to see what someone looks like and to read answers to meaningful questions about values and interests.''</p>
        <p>Janice Benes, 49, an occupational therapist and mother of four, uses matchmaking sites because she doesn't ''have time or the desire to go to bars,'' she said. She described the Cleveland area site on which she posted a profile as ''cheap and convenient.''</p>
        <p>She said she was reluctant to put her picture on the site. ''It's risky throwing your face on the Internet -- it's another piece of information someone has about you -- but I didn't want to waste time,'' she noted.</p>
        <p>Nor do millions of others.</p>
        <p>Media Metrix Inc., a New York company that collects data on Internet and digital media, estimates that 5.3 million people visited such sites in August, with Friendfinder.com ranking first, attracting 1.1 million visitors.</p>
        <p>PC Data, a Web measurement firm in Reston, Va., tracks 40 to 50 matchmaking Web sites that post personal profiles for men and women who can then contact one another through e-mail.</p>
        <p>On these sites, those looking for dates  are often offered a free short-term subscription to the service, but are then billed about $20 a month to post their own profile and reply to others' profiles (browsing is usually free). To post one, participants respond to an online questionnaire -- selecting their age, height, body type, religion, astrological sign and hobbies, among other things.</p>
        <p>They also have an opportunity to write their own answers to questions; for example, they can tell more about themselves, their perception of an ideal relationship, a perfect date or what they have learned from past relationships. Subscribers can include photographs to accompany their profiles and look through other profiles, narrowing their search by choosing the criteria that is important to them.</p>
        <p>Along with the profiles, the sites include advice columns, chat rooms, even singles trips and cruises. The sites are reasonably priced, compared with personalized dating services or voice-mail services in newspaper advertisements. They allow anonymity, and rejection can seem less painful.</p>
        <p>Like all matchmaking services, the Web sites raise questions of privacy or safety -- most e-mail messages are sent via anonymous addresses or through the sites' central systems. Several sites include sensible advice, like not giving out phone numbers right away. But bad stuff can happen, as evidenced by this self-explanatory Web address: www.saferdating.com/badstuff.htm, where sadder-but-wiser stories can be posted.</p>
        <p>Not only are matchmaking Web sites attracting more single people who are looking for Mr. or Ms. Right (or Mr./Ms. Right Now), they are also proving to be good business ventures.</p>
        <p>''From an investment standpoint, they're very appealing,'' said Peggy O'Neill, an Internet principal analyst for Nielsen/NetRatings. ''These can be very lean companies with low overhead.''</p>
        <p>She added, ''They're selling hopes and dreams.'' But along with membership fees, the sites are selling advertising banners, sponsorships and partnerships.</p>
        <p>''There are all sorts of e-commerce opportunities connected with dating sites,'' Ms. O'Neill said. Dating rituals, whether online or in person, involve flowers, candy, cards, dinners, movies, theater, a new outfit, facials, all the way to wedding gowns and Caribbean honeymoons -- products or services provided by businesses that would like to target this audience.</p>
        <p>And those who visit these sites seem to stay awhile, a fact that appeals to advertisers, and which the Internet industry calls ''stickiness.''</p>
        <p>''The initial race was for reach,'' said Jeffrey Fieler, an equity research analyst covering Internet businesses for Bear, Stearns &amp; Company, referring to the numbers of visitors to a site. ''Now it's for depth, how long people stay online.''</p>
        <p>Of the top 10 matchmaking Web sites ranked by Nielsen/NetRatings for August, in the category of average total monthly time spent online per person for the month, Personals@Yahoo.com was at the top with 28 minutes, 10 seconds; Match.com was second with 22 minutes, 27 seconds; and Relationships.com was third with 20 minutes, 45 seconds. The average time spent on a shopping site in August, according to Nielsen/NetRatings, was 6 minutes, 46 seconds.</p>
        <p>The sites that draw substantial numbers of visitors are, not surprisingly, owned by or have established partnerships with the large portals. So along with the Yahoo personals site, you can click to matchmaking Web sites from the home page of America Online. Lycos recently acquired Matchmaker.com. And Match.com, which, with One-and-only.com, was bought by Ticketmaster Online/CitySearch from Cendant, is now linked to MSN's home page.</p>
        <p>But there are also smaller sites designed for people with specific interests. Sites exist for seniors, sports or astrology enthusiasts and gay men and lesbians. There are so many sites that XmeetsY.com helps people ''navigate the complex landscape of matchmaking sites,'' said Mary Dickinson, the president.</p>
        <p>Other traditional approaches to dating are feeling the effect of the Internet.  In its latest survey of members, the Association of Alternative Newsweeklies reported that revenue from personal ads dropped more than 13 percent in just one year.</p>
        <p>There is one inherent business problem that the Web sites face along with any other matchmaking service, Mr. Fieler of Bear, Stearns pointed out: the more successful a site is at making matches, the more unsuccessful it is at holding on to its subscriber base. But with customers like Mr. Welch, the development officer in San Francisco, there is no shortage of clientele.</p>
        <p>After spending $2,000 on a personal matchmaker, hundreds of dollars a month on voice-mail services for personal ads in newspapers and enduring  fruitless fix-ups by well-meaning friends, Mr. Welch has been looking for love on SiliconMatchmaker.com and Match.com. He said he had communicated with more than 100 women, met dozens for coffee and seriously dated two.</p>
        <p>That he has not found a match is hardly the sites' fault, he noted. ''You have to kiss just as many frogs on the Internet as through other methods,'' he said.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, Sandra-Leigh Serio, a 50-ish professional astrologer from Boulder, Colo., subscribed to Match.com in January 1999. Within the first 10 matches, there was Elliot Crawford, 48, who lived only 10 miles away.</p>
        <p>''I didn't like his picture at first, so I ignored him,'' she recalled. But Mr. Crawford, a sales representative for a Denver printer, had read Ms. Serio's profile and sent her a message.</p>
        <p>''He was a good writer and, though I didn't generally date Tauruses, he pleaded for equal consideration,'' she said.</p>
        <p>They started corresponding and agreed to meet. After dating for two months, she invited him to her apartment for dinner. ''Basically, he never left,'' she said. The couple recently bought a house together.</p>
        <p>Among younger subscribers, the online dating world is often ''just another form of entertainment,'' said Jenya Kimlat, 22, of Orlando, Fla., who works for an interactive media consulting firm. A Russian-Jewish immigrant whose parents encouraged her to meet and marry a Jewish man, she put her profile on two Jewish sites, Jdate.com and Jewishpersonals.com.</p>
        <p>''To me it's a kind of an ego booster to see how many responses I get,'' she said. ''But I don't see myself as someone who would e-mail somebody. That's kind of desperate.''</p>
        <p>But some Internet dating veterans insist that people can begin to fall in love just by reading each other's messages. Prof. Andrea Baker, a sociologist at Ohio University, has been testing that notion. ''I don't want to say appearance is not important, but I have some evidence that shows that once they start liking someone for their thoughts and how they express themselves, they widen what they consider their range of acceptable appearances,'' she said. ''If they've communicated for a while, then only the total absence of chemistry would prevent them from falling in love once they actually meet.''</p>
        <p>If so, it may not be long before the Internet enables two people to find each other, fall in love, marry -- who knows, maybe even divorce? -- without ever meeting.</p>
        <p>What's Your Sign-On? I've Been Admiring Your Beautiful Pixels</p>
        <p>SO what's a nice guy like me doing in a story like this?</p>
        <p>Was I increasing my chances of meeting someone? Was I giving up that meeting-at-a-bus-stop-in-the-rain fantasy to play Internet roulette with my heart?</p>
        <p>But enough about me. Let's talk about how I set about looking for you. There was no shortage of yous, since I had followed my friend Mike's advice and subscribed to not one or two but four matchmaking Web sites.</p>
        <p>Sitting at my computer one night, I must have read 200 profiles. Like every other looks-obsessed guy, I considered only women whose photographs were posted (confirming the Web companies' findings that those who include pictures get three times as many e-mail messages as those who don't). By the end of the evening I was exhausted. Imagine meeting 200 people in one night. What pressure! And the fact that I found only about four who appeared worth e-mailing made me feel like a judgmental slug.</p>
        <p>I quickly learned to skip the multiple-choice answers and determined compatibility by reading the essays. I ruled out those who included smiley faces or too many misspellings. I had been told men lie about their income and their height, and women about age and weight. I also found most people take liberties with the pictures, submitting shots as old as 10 years.</p>
        <p>When all the smoke of technology cleared away, I discovered, it was the same old same old  boy-meets-girl ritual. I encouraged my friend Arlan, who is also single, to sign up. After the first day I asked her how it was going. She said: ''My profile is up; now let's see who contacts me. How about you?'' I said I had already sent several e-mail messages. It was clear that men are still the hunters, women the gatherers.</p>
        <p>Maybe it was because the photograph I posted was taken on a day my hair was doing a bad Elvis impersonation, but only five women responded to my missives. Two were G.U. (that's geographically undesirable); one, Judy, was coming out of an unhappy 28-year marriage and just looking for a friend; one was using matchmaking Web sites as a sly come-on for her own porn site; and one, Linda, was a sincere woman of Japanese and Italian descent with two teenage sons.</p>
        <p>Lively e-mail dialogues ensued with both Judy and Linda. Just as in the film ''You've Got Mail,'' I suddenly couldn't wait to log on and scan for their screen names. I found that a theory put forth by Prof. Andrea Baker, a sociologist at Ohio University, was true: it is possible to get a sense of someone and whether you like her through e-mail before actually meeting. Judy seemed thoughtful and funny, but I could tell her  marriage had left her with insecurities that only time could heal. Linda, divorced nine years, was at a different stage, more playful and comfortable talking about anything, even a subject most people save until last: religion.</p>
        <p>Messages turned to phone calls. Voice contact led to planning get-togethers.</p>
        <p>I met both on the same day. After that, Judy and I agreed she was not ready for a relationship, but we said we would stay in touch. Linda was perky and bright-eyed, and we seemed comfortable with each other. We agreed to a second date. That second date, though almost anticlimactic, was quite enjoyable. We planned another outing.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, I kept scanning the matchmaking  sites and stumbled upon the profile of Suzanne, who happened to live in my hometown. She was perfect: creative, ready for a relationship, from the same background and with a daughter almost the same age as mine. The trouble was, she wasn't replying to my messages. (Suzanne, write me back!)</p>
