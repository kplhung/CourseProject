        <p>Researchers this week said they had hacked into several of the Secure Digital Music Initiative's proposed technologies, which are designed to encode music so it cannot be pirated over the Internet. Researchers at Princeton and Rice universities and Xerox Parc claimed to have defeated four of the six technologies. But initiative officials said they had yet to verify the researchers' claims. The hackers' efforts came as part of a contest sponsored by the Secure Digital Music Initiative, which is made up of 200 record, consumer electronics and technology companies, to test the security of the proposed technologies. The contest, which offers an award of $10,000, has drawn 447 entries.</p>
