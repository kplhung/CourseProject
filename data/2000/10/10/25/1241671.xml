        <p>IT'S a beautiful, beautiful animal,'' Frank Hederman said, holding up a silvery 12-pound salmon, bright of eye and red of gill, less than 10 hours out of the sea.

        <p>IT'S a beautiful, beautiful animal,'' Frank Hederman said, holding up a silvery 12-pound salmon, bright of eye and red of gill, less than 10 hours out of the sea. ''These guys swim 4,000 or 5,000 miles to get here. By comparison, the farmed salmon, the ones who live in those cages off the coast, are essentially goldfish.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hederman smokes fish, which is a little like saying Steinway makes pianos. Savvy fish fanciers in England and Ireland -- many of them, anyway -- prize his smoked haddock, his smoked eel and especially his smoked wild salmon above all others. Which is what makes you shake your head a bit when you drive up to his place of work.</p>
        <p>To get there you cross a small stone bridge onto Great Island, which sits like a cork in the bottle of Cork Harbor. Mr. Hederman, a fit, droll 40-year-old, has lived on the island all his life. You turn right at the evocative remnants of Belvelly Castle, built in the 13th century, towards Cobh (pronounced cove), once called Queenstown. Cobh is the port where hundreds of thousands of nearly penniless emigrants boarded ships in the late 19th and early 20th centuries for North America; it was also the Titanic's last port of call on her fateful final voyage in 1912.</p>
        <p>You're not headed for Cobh itself, or at least my wife, Betsey, and I weren't. We turned off the road at a roofless house, with a bunch of ramshackle buildings behind it -- just old limestone walls with corrugated metal roofs thrown over them. They had been the kennels for a previous owner's hunting dogs, Mr. Hederman told us.</p>
        <p>But this is about flavor, not architecture, and Mr. Hederman's salmon has that in spades -- a subtle, elegant, elusive flavor, with a slight tang of salt and an uncommon balance between the clean taste of the fish and that of the smoke, which sneaks up on you. The color, a pale, appetizing hue that reminded me of cantaloupe, and the texture, smooth without a hint of oiliness, are equally appealing. The three elements -- color and taste and texture -- are uniform right through the side.</p>
        <p>It took time to get it right. Mr. Hederman rejected, right at the start, the chipboard sawdust many smokers use, because it contains glue particles as well as wood. He tried burning staves from old whiskey barrels, but that, he concluded, deposited too many tars and tannins on the finished product.</p>
        <p>Some tarry substances are an integral part of smoking; deposited on the fish, they form a barrier against airborne bacteria, helping to retard spoilage. That has been the main goal of smoking food, as well as drying it, for thousands of years. Flavor is a fringe benefit.</p>
        <p>But as he worked amid smoke from the oak, Mr. Hederman found dark stains on his forearms -- ''like a deep suntan,'' he said. Too much tar, he decided, and he switched to beechwood chips, which not only cut down the tars but gave the fish a milder flavor. Each smoker has favorite woods; Bill Casey of Ballycotton imports his from England.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hederman also decided that laying fish in trays, to be smoked horizontally, tends to produce a hard crust on top, which results in turn in uneven penetration of the smoke. So he leaves the ''collar'' -- a ring of cartilage at the ''neck'' of the salmon -- on the fish when he guts them and beheads them. That way, he can anchor a hook firmly in the collar to suspend the fish for processing.</p>
        <p>The hook, a fearsome-looking steel gadget, is called a tenterhook, by the way. It was adapted from the linen trade. So why do we say we're ''on tenterhooks'' when we're nervous? I asked the expert. Sometimes, he explained, things fall off, ''but you never know when that's going to happen, so you're apprehensive.''</p>
        <p>You learn something new every day.</p>
        <p>Like Norway, whose blandly flavored smoked salmon is favored by the French, and Scotland, where the smokiness is more pronounced, Ireland is famous for its smoked salmon, often eaten with buttered soda bread. We went to see Mr. Hederman partly because of the results of a comparative tasting arranged for us by Myrtle Allen, the owner of Ballymaloe House at Shanagarry.</p>
        <p>All of the samples she provided came from County Cork, Ireland's gastronomic heartland. In addition to Mr. Hederman's wild salmon, which we liked best, we tasted (in order of preference) a wild salmon, almost mahogany in color, from Anthony Creswell in Timoleague, which had a punchy, oaky flavor and a texture we found just the slightest bit mealy; a farmed salmon from Mr. Casey of Ballycotton, coral in color, thrillingly silky in texture but, to us, one-dimensional in flavor; and a much less satisfying salmon from Sally Barnes in Castletownshend. It tasted slightly of petroleum; Mrs. Allen did not know if it was farm-raised or wild.</p>
        <p>We're talking here, of course, about Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), whose range runs from Portugal to Norway to Greenland and down the Atlantic Coast of North America, though the population has been reduced by pollution in the rivers where the fish spawn. Norwegian, Scottish and Irish smokers all use the same fish, as do those that produce the Nova so beloved of New Yorkers; smoked salmon from the Pacific Northwest is altogether different, made from fish -- whether coho or chinook or sockeye -- that are distant cousins of Mr. Salar.</p>
        <p>Time was, the best Irish salmon, indeed most of the best Irish fish, was either exported or netted by Spaniards working here. Although surrounded by water, the Irish had no special affinity for fish and none of today's passion for freshness and quality.</p>
        <p>''It was poor people's food, Friday food,'' said Maire Flynn, an owner of  the Tannery, just up the coast from here, one of the best of Ireland's new restaurants.</p>
        <p>Just so, Mr. Hederman said.</p>
        <p>''When I was a kid,'' he said, ''what was available was really appalling. The smoked salmon was low cost, high volume, so I decided when I was 22 to try for low volume, high value. I knew our main resources here, our coasts and our grasslands, were underused. But it took a certain amount of passion, a lot of years of being penniless and my wife leaving me not once but twice, to get this business built and running.''</p>
        <p>Now, he smokes about 25 tons a year, an average of half a ton a week.  Besides salmon, he does cheese, mussels, chicken, haddock, mackerel and eels. His eels, by far the best I have ever tasted, come from the local power company, which takes them from the warm water at the intakes of its generators.</p>
        <p>Hederman products are available at the English Market in Cork, the Farmers Market in Midleton, near here, and the Temple Bar Market in Dublin, as well as Fortnum &amp; Mason in London. They are not sold in the United States or on the Internet. But Mr. Hederman is happy to ship salmon by DHL Worldwide Express (about $30 a side, excluding freight) on receipt of faxed orders (011-353-21-4814-323). To limit the freight charges, it is best for several people to combine orders. Mr. Creswell's excellent smoked wild salmon from Timoleague can be ordered on the Internet at www.ummera.com; it is also air-freighted by DHL.</p>
        <p>NO one doubts that wild salmon tastes better, whether fresh or smoked. Because it gets so much exercise, it has none of the unpleasant fattiness that plagues some farmed salmon. But wild salmon may be legally caught and sold in Ireland for only 32 days a year -- eight weeks of four 12-hour days each. During that period, which falls in June and July, Mr. Hederman smokes the shining fish as they are delivered by fishermen, who catch them on lines trailed from small punts when the fish gather offshore before heading upriver.</p>
        <p>''They fish out of Ballycotton, Cobh and Cork,'' one of Mr. Hederman's workers said. ''They all talk out of the side of their mouths in an impenetrable accent. I'm from Dublin, and I need subtitles to understand them.''</p>
        <p>The rest of the year, Mr. Hederman and his colleagues in the trade have to rely on farmed salmon or frozen wild salmon, which works fairly well, if it is frozen fast enough and soon enough after it is caught, though there is always some damage to the fish's cellular structure. Lately, improved salmon raised organically in deep-water cages in Bantry Bay, where it develops muscles struggling against the strong tides, has begun to come on the market.</p>
        <p>Salting, an intermediate step, cures and preserves the fish, helping to kill bacteria and to draw moisture from the fish. At Mr. Hederman's Belvelly Smoke House, coarse-grain Spanish salt is poured sparingly onto the split salmon, left there for four to six hours, then washed off. Next the sides go into a drying room, where a fan pulls fresh air across them.</p>
        <p>Inside the smokehouse, the beechwood chips smolder in a barrel, which contains the smoke. Mr. Hederman built the smoker to a design he picked up in Scheveningen, a Dutch port and resort town near the Hague, from a man who had brought it from Germany.</p>
        <p>How long the fish stay inside depends on the temperature outside. At Christmas, which is not only the coldest time of the year but also the busiest at Belvelly, the salmon can take up to 35 hours to finish smoking.</p>
        <p>''You start with the best raw material you can get,'' Mr. Hederman said, as if the whole process were easy as pie, which it obviously is not. ''The rest is just salt, smoke and time.''</p>
