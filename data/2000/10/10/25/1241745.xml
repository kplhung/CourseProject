        <p>The Xerox Corporation, which lost money in most of its businesses this quarter, said yesterday that it would sell pieces of most of its operations -- from inkjet printers to its finance businesses to its share of Fuji Xerox.

        <p>The Xerox Corporation, which lost money in most of its businesses this quarter, said yesterday that it would sell pieces of most of its operations -- from inkjet printers to its finance businesses to its share of Fuji Xerox. It is even looking to sell a majority stake in its most prestigious asset, its ground-breaking Palo Alto Research Center.</p>
        <p>If it is successful, the company will accomplish what few Xerox-watchers expected it could: extricate itself from a deep financial hole without abandoning any of its core businesses. ''Xerox is trying to monetize portions of its assets, but the face of the company will not change much,'' said Jonathan Rosenzweig, an analyst with Salomon Smith Barney.</p>
        <p>Xerox said it expected to reap $2 billion to $4 billion from the sales. The company also said it would cut $1 billion of costs, a move that suggests the third round of large-scale job reductions in two years, and analysts calculate that it would have to eliminate as many as 8,000 jobs to meet that target. Most would come from manufacturing and service operations, but many management jobs are vulnerable as well.</p>
        <p>Xerox, its gross margins plummeting as costs soar, clearly needs the cash. The company lost $167 million in the third quarter, and does not expect to see black ink until 2001. The loss translated to 26 cents a share, including a 6 cent-a-share charge relating to accounting problems in its Mexican operations. Analysts had predicted a loss of 19 cents a share.</p>
        <p>''The need to urgently improve cash flow and the balance sheet is obvious,'' Paul A. Allaire, Xerox's chairman, said. ''That means disposing of assets that in better times we'd have preferred to keep.''</p>
        <p>Quarterly revenue was down 4 percent, to $4.46 billion, from the corresponding quarter of last year. Even without the adverse impact of converting sales of the weak euro into dollars, Xerox's sales would have been 1 percent lower.</p>
        <p>In a conference call with analysts yesterday, the company reassured investors that its cash and liquidity positions were sound. Xerox's net worth, at $4.2 billion, is $1 billion above the minimum net worth its banks insist on.</p>
        <p>Although it has drawn down $4.8 billion of a $7 billion line of credit, much of that has gone to reduce short-term debt. ''They still have borrowing capacity left,'' said Peter J. Enderlin, an analyst with Ryan, Beck Southeast Research.</p>
        <p>Xerox's sales of color printers and copiers were up 34 percent. Counting sales from Tektronix, the printer company Xerox bought earlier this year, color sales were up 74 percent.</p>
        <p>''Color is our strategic core, and we are going to protect that,'' Anne M. Mulcahy, Xerox's president and chief operating officer, said in a telephone interview.</p>
        <p>But the sparks of good news were not enough to reassure Wall Street. According to First Call/Thompson Financial, three analysts lowered their recommendations on Xerox stock this morning, and now every analyst that follows Xerox rates it a hold. The shares closed yesterday at $8.94, down 31 cents.</p>
        <p>''They are survivors, but the question is: are they going to flourish again,'' said Jack L. Kelly, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs.</p>
        <p>Mr. Allaire's insistence that he ''would not fire-sale'' anything also troubled some analysts. ''It appears that nothing will happen until 2001, and we'd have liked the sales to go quicker,'' said Benjamin A. Reitzes of PaineWebber.</p>
        <p>If the sales take too long, it could crimp Xerox's cost-cutting plans. Few analysts expect the company to take the special charges associated with substantial job cuts until they could be offset by the asset sales.</p>
        <p>Thus, the asset sales are the key to making Xerox's other strategies work. Xerox is talking to several finance companies -- many analysts say GE Capital is high on the list -- about selling parts of its equipment-financing business, even though it is easier to sell a $250,000 machine if financing is an element of the package. ''We will provide financing in ways that do not involve our balance sheet,'' Mr. Allaire said.</p>
        <p>Xerox is talking with Fuji Photo Film about a sale of Xerox's $200 million China operations. Xerox also seeks buyers for its European paper operations, and for its share of ContentGuard, Inxight and other software companies it helped to create.</p>
        <p>Xerox, which is based in Stamford, Conn., is looking to joint-venture operations that it wants to keep. It wants to sell equity in its nascent inkjet business -- a line it once highlighted as a major source of growth. And it hopes to lure noncompeting manufacturers into picking up two-thirds of the cost of running the research center, in exchange for the center's spending two-thirds of its time exploring products that fit the partners' core businesses, not Xerox's.</p>
        <p>Xerox has sound reasons for wanting to keep at least a toehold in all of its asset classes. While the Palo Alto center represents only 10 percent of Xerox's research budget, it has generated laser printers and other core technologies. Retaining 25 percent ownership in Fuji Xerox gives Xerox access to printer products, and will make it easier to maintain the technology-sharing agreement it has with the joint venture.</p>
        <p>Even as it peddles some of the family jewels, Xerox is tinkering with its in-house structure. It still suffers from the effects of a misconceived sales force reorganization early in 1999, in which it began assigning sales territories by industry rather than geography. Confusion ensued, and many sales representatives left. Although Ms. Mulcahy said the attrition rate had slowed, the company still lacks experienced salespeople in key territories.</p>
        <p>Xerox also consolidated many back-office operations last year, causing backlogs in accounts receivable and billing problems.</p>
        <p>And Xerox had become a bloated machine, with some departments organized around products, others around regions, still others around industry groups. When sales and earnings started to fall apart, it was easy for managers to dodge responsibility.</p>
        <p>The chaos has driven customers away. ''Sometimes I felt like they were arrogant, they just weren't listening to me,'' said John N. Harrison, president of the Free Press Publishing Company, a commercial printer in Tampa, Fla., that recently replaced its high-speed Xerox printers with competing products from Heidelberger Druckmaschinen A.G.</p>
        <p>Xerox is streamlining its convoluted reporting structure, eliminating many product and industry management slots. Salespeople will still be organized by industry, but they will report to regional chiefs.</p>
        <p>The company will use more outside distributors to sell all but its highest-end products, and will farm out many service contracts.</p>
        <p>Xerox may also farm out many of its manufacturing operations, a move that would enable it to sell some huge plants -- including its mainstay plant in Webster, N.Y.</p>
        <p>''I am definitely worried,'' said Gary Bonadonna, director of the Rochester joint board of the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees, which represents Xerox employees in Webster.</p>
        <p>Correction:  October 26, 2000, Thursday  An article in Business Day yesterday about Xerox's reorganization plans misstated the relationship between the company and Tektronix, which makes testing and measurement devices. Xerox bought Tektronix's color printer business this year, not the entire company.</p>
