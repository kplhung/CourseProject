        <p>List of outlets for smoked Irish salmon in New York City (S)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>NOT nearly as common as Norwegian, Scottish or other varieties, Irish smoked salmon can be found in many New York restaurants and food shops.</p>
        <p>The wild smoked salmon of Ireland is generally considered superior to the farmed kind. It can be found on the menus of some restaurants featuring Irish foods, like Half King (505 West 23rd Street, 212-462-4300), a new restaurant and bar in Chelsea. It is served on top of warm goat cheese potato cakes, and in a salad with horseradish, cucumbers and capers. Neary's (358 East 57th Street at First Avenue, 212-751-1434), an Irish pub, serves its smoked salmon with capers and onions. At Tir Na Nog (5 Penn Plaza, on Eighth Avenue at 34th Street, 212-630-0249) you'll find a lunchtime sandwich made with the salmon on brown bread with prosciutto and dill sauce. At dinner, it's layered with blini and dilled creme fraiche.</p>
