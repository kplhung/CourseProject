        <p>Editorial calls for some World Series games to be played during day</p>

        <p>If you believe in fairy tales, and most baseball fans do, you know that it is always possible to make one wish too many. Who could ask for anything more than a Subway Series? Well, there is just one more thing -- a Subway Series played, at least in part, during these still-lingering autumn afternoons. Call it a nostalgic impulse, or simply the way the game was meant to be played, but you can almost imagine what it might be like. Someone would dream up a special promotion -- fedora day -- so that when the cameras glanced over the crowd, you might almost imagine you were looking back in time to the 1930's or 40's, when a baseball stadium was invariably a sea of hats.</p>
        <p>The first night World Series game took place in 1971, Pittsburgh vs. Baltimore. That was 36 years after the first night game ever in major league history, which occurred in Cincinnati on May 24, 1935. It took only 16 years for day games to disappear entirely from the World Series. The last -- or, optimistically, most recent -- Series day game was the sixth game between the Twins and Cardinals in 1987. Since then, every World Series game has been played at night, a concession, of course, to the financial needs of television and Major League Baseball.</p>

        <p>Certainly the Subway Series has filled New York City with excitement, even, or perhaps especially, when the games run into early morning. But the prime-time Series schedule means that late October baseball is less public than it might be, and that is a loss not only for baseball and its fans, young and old, but for the city too.</p>
        <p>Just imagine an afternoon Series game between the Yankees and the Mets. It would feel as though the whole city, at the office and at school, were collectively listening for the sound of roars from Queens or the Bronx. People would watch the game by glances, work by snatches, eavesdrop as the innings passed, corral the scores from total strangers. The afternoon would be measured out in strikes and balls. In the early innings the sun would warm the field, and just as the final outs came, the cool of evening would rush in. On the rail lines out to the suburbs, conductors would announce the final score, as though it were an unscheduled stop.</p>
