        <p>BRITAIN: HEATH TO QUIT COMMONS -- Former Prime Minister Sir Edward Heath said he would give up his seat in the House of Commons at the next general election, which is expected sometime in 2001.

        <p>BRITAIN: NEW SPEAKER -- The House of Commons chose Michael Martin, a Labor member of Parliament from Glasgow, to be its new speaker. Mr. Martin, a bona fide member of the working class who met his wife in a factory, was chosen in a cumbersome election in which 12 candidates were considered, two by two, late into Monday night. He succeeds Betty Boothroyd, 70, the first woman to hold the post.</p>

        <p>ITALY: REDUCING THE MILITARY -- Seeking to reduce the Italian military, the Senate approved a law abolishing obligatory military service. The changes will go into effect over seven years, gradually bringing down the number of Italian service men and women from 270,000 to 190,000. Men born in 1985 will be the last to be drafted.</p>

        <p>TURKEY: PLEA ON GREEK TIES -- Foreign Minister Ismail Cem said a dispute with Greece over military boundaries in the Aegean Sea should not derail yearlong efforts to bring the two countries closer together. Greece withdrew its forces from joint NATO maneuvers on Sunday after its military jets were refused permission to fly over two disputed Aegean islands. Turkey had objected, claiming the flights violated airspace designated as demilitarized.</p>

        <p>ROMANIA: DEATH SENTENCE ANNULLED -- The Supreme Court has annulled a death sentence against Mircea Raceanu, a former diplomat, acquitting him of charges that he passed state secrets to the United States in the Communist era. The decision, issued Monday, closed a chapter of the cold war that had burdened Romanian-American relations since Mr. Raceanu's arrest in Bucharest on Jan. 31, 1989.</p>

        <p>RUSSIA: SWITCH IN ESPIONAGE TRIAL -- The espionage trial of the American businessman Edmond Pope took an unexpected turn after a court agreed to allow a key witness to testify. The court had previously rejected the defense's request to call Anatoly Babkin, who Russia's Federal Security Service says sold Mr. Pope blueprints of a torpedo. Mr. Pope, who says the court is biased, continued his testimony.</p>

        <p>THE AMERICAS</p>
        <p>MEXICO: AMERICANS FACE EVICTION -- The Supreme Court threatened to remove a cabinet secretary from office unless he enforces its rulings in a land dispute, which could lead to the forced evictions of more than 500 Americans on the Baja California coast. The court said the land, including a hotel, houses and cabanas, was inhabited by foreigners who in good faith bought it from illegitimate sellers. The residents say the government told them the sales were legal. Though there are loopholes, foreigners are generally barred from buying land within 35 miles of the coast.</p>

        <p>CANADA: 30 HELD IN PROTEST -- Montreal police arrested 39 people protesting a meeting of finance ministers from industrialized and developing nations. Brandishing signs that read ''Stop the Corporate Greed'' and ''Eat the Rich,'' the demonstrators threw rocks and horse manure at the police.</p>

        <p>ASIA</p>
        <p>INDONESIA: SUHARTO APPEAL -- The Jakarta High Court has appointed three judges to consider an appeal by prosecutors to reinstate the corruption case against former President Suharto, whom a lower court ruled medically unfit to stand trial. A court spokesman said the judges would issue a decision in about a month, although many legal scholars doubt Mr. Suharto will ever be brought to trial.</p>

        <p>INDIA: A FIRST FOR NATIONALISTS -- The Bharatiya Janata Party, the Hindu nationalist movement that leads the nation's ruling coalition, has for the first time taken power in the western state of Goa. The state party leader, Manohar Parrijkar, was sworn in as the new chief minister.</p>

        <p>UZBEKISTAN: 12 ACCUSED -- Prosecutors in Tashkent accused 12 members of two outlawed Islamic groups of murder and terrorist acts. The accusations are the latest effort to stop what the government says are religious extremists intent on overthrowing President Islam Karimov. Human rights advocates say the rights of peaceful Muslims have been violated.</p>

        <p>MIDDLE EAST</p>
        <p>EGYPT: ELECTION DEATH -- Angry at being turned away from polling stations, supporters of opposition candidates backed by the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood clashed with the police in the first stage of runoff elections for Parliament. At least one man was killed when policemen fired into a crowd in Ashmun, about 25 miles north of Cairo. Similar disturbances were reported in Port Said and Ismailia.</p>

        <p>IRAN: MORE PAPERS BANNED -- The judiciary announced ''temporary'' bans on two more reformist weekly newspapers, raising the total of recently banned publications to more than 30, the state radio said. The weeklies Mihan and Sepideh-e Zendegi were banned for ''press offenses,'' the radio said.</p>

        <p>AFRICA</p>
        <p>UGANDA: F.B.I. JOINS SEARCH -- A team of F.B.I. agents has arrived in Uganda to help track down Rwandan rebels who killed foreign tourists on a visit to view rare mountain gorillas. The rebels killed four Britons, two Americans and four park rangers in the Bwindi Impenetrable Forest National Park on March 1, 1999.</p>
