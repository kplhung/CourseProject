        <p>IT'S well known that all self-respecting Greek diners serve the same rice pudding. The question is why.</p>
        <p>As one who considers a bowlful heavily dusted with cinnamon a logical encore to a tuna melt, I was happy to find the answer in a warren of dark-paneled rooms on West 33rd Street, the headquarters of Estiator magazine. Not that I found any discussion of rice pudding in the magazine's pages -- its name means restaurateur in Greek -- or even among the five recipes for Greek desserts on www.estiatoronline.com, its companion Web site.</p>

        <p>IT'S well known that all self-respecting Greek diners serve the same rice pudding. The question is why.</p>
        <p>As one who considers a bowlful heavily dusted with cinnamon a logical encore to a tuna melt, I was happy to find the answer in a warren of dark-paneled rooms on West 33rd Street, the headquarters of Estiator magazine. Not that I found any discussion of rice pudding in the magazine's pages -- its name means restaurateur in Greek -- or even among the five recipes for Greek desserts on www.estiatoronline.com, its companion Web site.</p>
        <p>The editor, Peter Makrias, told me the answer. Eventually. But first, he said I had to understand a little about the Greek-American restaurant owners who are the bulk of the monthly's 24,000 subscribers.</p>
        <p>''They are mostly immigrants,'' said Mr. Makrias, who before he founded Estiator 12 years ago was the editor of The National Herald, a newspaper in Greek. ''After World War II they jumped ship and came here without speaking the language.''</p>
        <p>Estiator is their Vanity Fair. Mr. Makrias and his staff of nine produce a spicy mix of gossip and news, with updates like ''New Brine Treatment Promises an End to Soggy Pickles.'' The magazine tackles questions like, What decor is trendy among coffee shop owners? The answer is upholstered booths with backs that fan out like seashells. Have people always loved garlic? Yes, at least since the days of Homer, who mentioned garlic in the ''Odyssey.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Makrias says that Estiator's subscribers make up more than a third of the 60,000 Greek-Americans who own restaurants across the country. Most of those are family businesses, many run by second-generation Americans. Half the articles are written in Greek.</p>
        <p>Following the path of the French and Italians who came ashore in earlier years and opened modest bistros and spaghetti houses, Greek immigrants worked their way up from dishwasher to boss in coffee shops across the country.</p>
        <p>''And they brought their rice pudding recipes with them?'' I asked.</p>
        <p>''The rice pudding,'' Mr. Makrias repeated. ''Yes.'' He sighed. ''Basically, it is the same because they use a basic recipe. Myself, I go for the dishes you can really get in Greece. Grilled octopus. Or yiouvetsi, that is chunks of lamb cooked with orzo in small clay pots.''</p>
        <p>But those were not the dishes that helped Greeks dominate the coffee shop business in this country.</p>
        <p>''To Americans, the coffee shop is comfort food, and some of the food that the Greeks brought fit right in,'' said Michael Batterberry, a food historian and the author, with his wife, Ariane Batterberry, of ''On the Town in New York'' (Routledge, 1998). ''But it's not as if they superimposed all their own dishes. They adapted to America, and they cooked food like pasta until it was really cooked, the way Americans liked it. And they had that great rice pudding.</p>
        <p>''I think the success of diners or coffee shops owned by Greeks can be explained by the fact that they made the food very accessible,'' he added. ''They are the last holdouts for cantaloupe, cottage cheese and Jell-O. They were happy to serve nice entrees that are not at all scary to Americans.''</p>
        <p>Estiator champions the immigrant who made good. The celebrity profiled in September's cover article, for example, was Steve Tenedios, under the headline ''Owner of Many Restaurants in Manhattan.'' Mr. Makrias summarized the story: ''This guy, he came here from a village in Greece, by invitation from his uncle, when he was 5 years old. When he was 18, he went with his brother-in-law in a doughnut shop in Brooklyn. Now he owns 14 restaurants.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Tenedios has three Cafe Metros in Midtown, with a fourth due in November, and is an owner as well of Munchelino's, also to open in November, at Seventh Avenue and 36th Street. When I read my notes to him, he laughed.</p>
        <p>''It loses a little in the translation,'' he said. ''To be honest, the language in Estiator is a little heavy even for me. It's written in almost a formal dialect. But we all read it because it keeps up with what other people are doing. It's everything from deaths to gossip to new happenings. It's our Bible.''</p>
        <p>And, yes, Mr. Tenedios serves rice pudding in all of his restaurants.</p>
