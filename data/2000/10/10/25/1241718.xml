        <p>It is no secret that for many Manhattan parents, getting a child into the Ivy League starts in nursery school. And as competition to get into the city's most elite private schools has stiffened, a growing number of parents are doing something that would have seemed bizarre or just plain silly a decade ago: spending as much as $300 an hour for private counselors to guide them through the nursery and elementary school application process.</p>
        <p>''Schools have become very selective, and parents are often very anxious about the process,'' said Nina Bauer, 29, who began running a service this fall called Ivywise Kids out of an office on West 57th Street.</p>

        <p>It is no secret that for many Manhattan parents, getting a child into the Ivy League starts in nursery school. And as competition to get into the city's most elite private schools has stiffened, a growing number of parents are doing something that would have seemed bizarre or just plain silly a decade ago: spending as much as $300 an hour for private counselors to guide them through the nursery and elementary school application process.</p>
        <p>''Schools have become very selective, and parents are often very anxious about the process,'' said Nina Bauer, 29, who began running a service this fall called Ivywise Kids out of an office on West 57th Street.</p>
        <p>Like other counselors in her field, Ms. Bauer says her role is that of a matchmaker and a social worker, helping parents to find an appropriate school for their child and relieving parents' anxieties by preparing them for the application process. She begins by meeting with the parents and discussing their child and the kind of school they are looking for. She then offers them information on the city's various private schools, practices admission interviews with them, and gives them tips on what a given school is looking for.</p>
        <p>She charges $600 for nursery school applications and $1,500 for elementary, and that includes two 90-minute sessions in person. Extra time is billed at a rate of $300 an hour.</p>
        <p>Counselors say that they cannot offer influence or connections, and that they cannot guarantee that a child will get into any given school. School admissions officers tend to be skeptical about the role of private consultants.</p>
        <p>''It saddens me to think that people feel they have to have a coach to help them come to my office and talk about their child,'' said Dr. Elisabeth Krents, the director of admissions for kindergarten through 12th grade at the Dalton School on the Upper East Side. She added that if she knew a given child's parents had seen a consultant, it could harm the child's chances. ''I would question that,'' she said. ''A little red flag would go up in my mind.''</p>
        <p>Partly for that reason, the private consulting business is a somewhat secretive one, though it seems safe to say that the number of preschool and kindergarten clients is in the hundreds. Consultants do not generally tell admissions directors about their work with any given child, for fear that doing so would harm the child's chances.</p>
        <p>Parents are equally uneasy about letting anyone know they have spoken to a consultant. The parents interviewed for this article who are now seeing consultants insisted that their names not be used, and several consultants said none of the parents they had worked with would speak to the press at all or agree to let a reporter sit in on any consultations.</p>
        <p>Several parents, however, said they had found the consultants helpful. ''You only have a fixed number of hours to focus on the school issues,'' said one parent, a financier who is working with Ms. Bauer. ''She's like the CliffsNotes of the process.''</p>
        <p>Another parent, an entrepreneur, said Ms. Bauer had helped him and his wife to understand a process that had more to do with social connections than with money. ''You can't buy your way into a school,'' he said, adding that he thought that was a shame. He said he and his wife had failed to get their child into the nursery school they wanted last year, and they wanted to make sure they got him into the right kindergarten.</p>
        <p>Ms. Bauer appears to be the only consultant working exclusively at the nursery and elementary school level. (Ms. Bauer runs Ivywise jointly with Dr. Katherine Cohen, who works with students applying to college.) But several other private educational consultants, most of whom have worked as preschool or elementary school teachers, said young children were a growing part of their business as well.</p>
        <p>''This year, a lot of the work is in kindergarten,'' said Elaine Vipler, who runs School Consultants on Private Education, on the Upper East Side. Ms. Vipler charges $500 per child to work with a family through the application process.</p>
        <p>Another competitor, Jane Ellen Weltz, who runs Educational Directions, also on the Upper East Side, said the number of parents of 3- and 4-year-old children calling her had increased markedly in the past two years. She would not give her prices.</p>
        <p>She and other consultants attributed the growth to an increase in the number of 3- and 4-year-olds and a growing number of wealthy parents who are willing to stay in the city. Such families pay $15,000 to $20,000 a year to send their children to private nursery and elementary schools, said Victoria Goldman, co-author with Catherine Hausman of ''The Manhattan Family Guide to Private Schools.''</p>
        <p>The application process includes an interview with the parents and child at the nursery school level. In kindergarten it includes an intelligence and development test administered by the nonprofit Educational Records Bureau (generally called the E.R.B. test), a requirement for private schools, as well as a nursery school report.</p>
        <p>The consultants say that they do not tutor children on how to answer questions on the E.R.B. test. Prepping children for that test has become increasingly common in recent years, and admissions officers will throw out an application if they sense that a child has been coached, Dr. Krents said. ''I know it's going on, and I'm quite wary about it,'' she added.</p>
        <p>In addition to looking for high E.R.B. scores, Ms. Bauer said, the most selective private schools are seeking children ''who have something special about them.''</p>
        <p>''It sounds strange to say that about a 4-year-old,'' she said, ''but it's true.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Krents said her criteria for choosing kindergartners were often intuitive. ''I look for well-rounded kids, kids who are curious and ask lots of questions,'' she said. ''It's an almost indescribable gut feeling one has with kids.''</p>
        <p>Deborah Ashe, the director of admissions for the Lower School of Trevor Day School, said the interviews were not an exact science. ''We know we're seeing a snapshot of the child,'' she said. ''Were they grouchy on that day? Were they sleepy? Were they feeling the anxiety of their parents?''</p>
        <p>Schools also interview parents and try to ensure that they share the school's values, Ms. Ashe said. ''We want to know who they are, what they value, what they're looking for,'' she said.</p>
        <p>To some, private counseling is a waste of money, or worse. ''They feed off parents' anxieties,'' said Ms. Goldman, the author. There are other ways of getting information about private schools, she added, including reading books like her own.</p>
        <p>The Parents League of New York, founded in 1913, offers publications, workshops and a school advisory service for parents seeking information about city schools, all for an annual fee of $75 per family.</p>
        <p>Ms. Goldman said that the notion of a bottleneck in Manhattan schools was a myth. Although the number of children applying to kindergarten did increase last year, the only schools that are really turning away children are the 14 ''baby Ivies'' -- the city's most prestigious private schools, she said. ''Those consultants are hyping this,'' and scaring parents who want their children at one of those schools into buying their services, she said.</p>
        <p>The consultants counter that they strongly advise parents against focusing only on a narrow range of prestigious schools. ''If a parent says, 'I only want him to go to Dalton,' I say that's not what this is about,'' said Jane E. Kolber, a private consultant who works on the Upper East Side.</p>
        <p>But most parents who hire private consultants have unrealistic ideas about the importance of getting into the right nursery and kindergarten programs, said Mark H. Sklarow, the executive director of the Independent Educational Consultants Association, a professional association based in Virginia.</p>
        <p>''Parents generally have a very skewed perception of the private school world,'' Mr. Sklarow said. ''They're convinced that if they don't get into a good nursery school, they're never going to get into the right prep school, they won't get into Harvard, and their life is over.''</p>
