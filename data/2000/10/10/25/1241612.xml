        <p>ROBERT McKINLEY, the chief executive of Cardweb.com, which tracks the payment card industry for consumers and issuers, long ago shed his fear of using a credit card to buy goods online. But he remains puzzled as to why so many people are still Web-wary.</p>
        <p>One friend, he said, has no qualms about trading a large portfolio of stocks through an online brokerage firm yet will not buy a book from Amazon.com for fear of having his credit information intercepted. And he is not alone. Several surveys have shown that most Americans still worry about losing some privacy -- and possibly much more -- if they use credit cards online.</p>
        <p>Those fears persist even though online security experts say that the number of serious online thefts of credit information has been low. Widespread publicity of a small number of security breaches has exaggerated consumers' fears, they say.</p>
        <p>''People are sort of waiting for the big one, the first big online heist,'' said James Van Dyke, a senior analyst with the Jupiter Research office in San Francisco. ''Consumers are concerned that this thing could be lurking right around the corner.''</p>
        <p>So merchants and card issuers keep trying new schemes to assuage those fears, however irrational they may be. This fall, American Express and Visa are making high-profile attempts to help Americans get over their concerns about online security.</p>
        <p>Three companies are issuing Visa ''smart cards,'' which contain microchips that can hold information about their owners and encrypt it before it is transmitted over the Internet.</p>
        <p>American Express is taking a simpler approach by offering its customers disposable numbers they can use in place of their card numbers when buying online.</p>
        <p>Internet security experts say that neither system is foolproof but that both, if they catch on, could help turn online browsers into online buyers. In a survey early this year, Datamonitor, a research firm in New York, found that about one of every four people who decided to make a purchase online would complete their transactions offline, mostly because they were afraid that their credit information might be stolen or that they would not receive what they were buying. More troubling for merchants, 58 percent of those people who would not buy online said nothing could be done to change their behavior.</p>
        <p>But card issuers and merchants have not stopped trying. In addition to reassuring shoppers that they can return some items they buy online, most retailers remind visitors to their Web sites that credit card holders are liable only for the first $50 in unauthorized charges on their cards. And some card issuers are now promising complete protection from fraudulent use of their cards.</p>
        <p>In fact, merchants have more reason to fear online shoppers than vice versa, credit card experts say. That is because they often have little recourse after shipping goods that were fraudulently bought online with a credit card.</p>
        <p>''Merchants have been eating a lot of the losses online,'' Mr. McKinley said.</p>
        <p>Banks and other card issuers place an added burden on merchants for transactions in which the buyer does not present an actual card, known in the industry as ''card not present'' transactions, he said. Growing use of smart cards, those that contain computer chips, could be a boon for merchants, saving them at least half the fee they pay on each transaction, he noted.</p>
        <p>The idea behind smart cards, like the Blue card that American Express introduced last year and the new Visa cards, is that consumers can run them through a reader attached to a computer, just as a store clerk would. In a single swipe, shoppers can transmit their credit card numbers and passwords, as well as information about where to ship the goods, saving the effort of typing in that data each time. In essence, the transaction takes place at the customer's keyboard instead of on a server that could be a target for hackers seeking to steal credit information on hundreds of thousands of people.</p>
        <p>For those on the other end, that transaction is significantly different. The presence of the card, especially if it was swiped in a familiar place, reassures the merchant and the card issuer that the purchase is valid.</p>
        <p>''That's why there is a quest for finding a way to make these transactions like a card-present transaction,'' Mr. McKinley said.</p>
        <p>Some day, he said, ''we may get to the point where the card is not necessary.'' But for now, he said, the card is the thing.</p>
        <p>Anne-Laure Degove, a senior analyst with Datamonitor, said that American Express might have hit upon an elegant, if only interim, solution, with a new system called Private Payments. Citing research that showed as many as 75 percent of consumers worry about online security, American Express said it would generate random numbers that its customers can use in place of their card numbers when filling out purchase forms online.</p>
        <p>''That's probably a pretty good solution,'' she said, because it breaks the transaction into two parts -- the assignment of the number to the card holder and the purchase -- that would be harder for a thief to track. To steal usable credit information, hackers would have to break into American Express' servers, which presumably would be more difficult than hacking into a small online merchant, Ms. Degove said.</p>
        <p>But experts seem to agree that none of these systems is the final answer that will make most consumers as comfortable shopping online as they are in a crowded mall.</p>
        <p>''There is no one provider that has the complete security puzzle in place,'' Mr. Van Dyke said, ''The complete solution doesn't exist, and we don't even know what it looks like.''</p>
