      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The regular-season opener is one week away, and Jeff Van Gundy acknowledged today that he was sitting on a potentially explosive situation. The Knicks' coach realizes that his decision to play Glen Rice off the bench for the first time in his 12-year career could upset the three-time All-Star. But he is thankful that Rice has thus far accepted the situation with a smile.</p>
        <p>''I told him, if he chooses to be a jerk, he could be,'' Van Gundy said. ''He's got his money, so there's nothing you can do there. He could be a total jerk and there's nothing anybody can do about it. I don't think he's ever come off the bench in a game. We'll see how it works over time.''</p>

        <p>The regular-season opener is one week away, and Jeff Van Gundy acknowledged today that he was sitting on a potentially explosive situation. The Knicks' coach realizes that his decision to play Glen Rice off the bench for the first time in his 12-year career could upset the three-time All-Star. But he is thankful that Rice has thus far accepted the situation with a smile.</p>
        <p>''I told him, if he chooses to be a jerk, he could be,'' Van Gundy said. ''He's got his money, so there's nothing you can do there. He could be a total jerk and there's nothing anybody can do about it. I don't think he's ever come off the bench in a game. We'll see how it works over time.''</p>
        <p>Everything has been harmonious so far. Rice, who signed a four-year, $36 million contract with the Los Angeles Lakers before being traded to the Knicks in September, has been the model teammate, cheering for those players in front of him and saying all the right things. Rice has also missed the last three games with a sore left knee and said he may not be ready to play in the opener on Oct. 31. Whenever he does return -- which will be sooner rather than later -- he will do so as a sixth man, playing behind Latrell Sprewell.</p>
        <p>''Those three guys and I have talked and there's no doubt that there are sacrifices to be made,'' Van Gundy said. ''Latrell made one when he didn't start. Glen's making one by not starting. Allan's made one before when John Starks was here because sometimes he didn't finish games. They're all starting players. Certainly they've all proven a lot in this league.''</p>
        <p>Van Gundy said today that he would not disrupt the rotation to ensure that Rice gets 30-plus minutes a night. Last season, Rice averaged 15.9 points in only 12 shots and 31 minutes a game. Despite starting, Rice complained about his limited role.</p>
        <p>Rice, who admitted that he had trouble adjusting to being the third offensive option in Los Angeles, said that experience would help him adjust to being a reserve for the Knicks. ''When I said what I said in Los Angeles, it was only because I said, 'Hey, look I want to be in the game during crunch time, in the fourth quarter,' '' Rice said. ''Where people came up with the idea that Glen Rice is selfish, I have no idea.</p>
        <p>''It's something that I've been through, and I know how to deal with it. Hopefully the other guys will know how to deal with it as well. You have to be supportive of each other and you have to understand that that's a part of trying to get to the next level to win.''</p>
        <p>Rice's few memories of coming off the bench -- he did so for a few games immediately after being traded to the Lakers in 1998 -- are not all bad. He scored 26 points, including records of 24 points in one half and 20 in one quarter, as a reserve in the 1997 All-Star Game and was named the game's most valuable player.</p>
        <p>''If we can do that off the bench,'' Rice said with a smile, ''we'll have something else to cheer about at the end of the season.''</p>
        <p>Van Gundy is keeping his fingers crossed.</p>
