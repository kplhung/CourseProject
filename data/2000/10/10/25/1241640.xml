        <p>WHEN Congress last passed an important insurance law, back in 1996, e-commerce was barely taking its baby steps and had not yet toddled anywhere near a hospital, doctor's office, pharmacy or claims center.</p>
        <p>But that law has begun to accelerate the introduction of electronic commerce into the health care industry by setting national standards for the electronic exchange of information. Such information is needed to submit insurance claims and pay for care provided by doctors and hospitals.</p>
        <p>The main purpose of the measure, known as the Kassebaum-Kennedy law, was to make health insurance coverage more available to people who change or lose their jobs. Tucked inside the law, however, were provisions specifically intended to encourage ''the electronic transmission of certain health information'' in hopes of making the health care system more efficient.</p>
        <p>In August, the secretary of health and human services, Donna E. Shalala, set standards for eight electronic transactions including the submission of claims, the payment of premiums and the process of enrolling people in health plans.</p>
        <p>Elisabeth Belmont, general counsel of Maine Health, which operates the Maine Medical Center and other hospitals, said: ''The law does not require health care providers to conduct transactions electronically. But if they do, they must comply with the standards'' adopted under the 1996 law, known officially as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act.</p>
        <p>The law does not require doctors to buy computers. But, federal officials said, more doctors may want to use computers to submit claims and receive payments because there will be a more uniform way of doing such things electronically.</p>
        <p>Today, officials said, health care providers and health plans that conduct business electronically must use many different formats for electronic transactions. About 400 different formats exist for claims.</p>
        <p>''With a national standard for electronic claims and other transactions,'' Dr. Shalala said, ''health care providers will be able to submit the same transaction to any health plan in the United States, and the health plan must accept it.''</p>
        <p>The rules will therefore encourage many health care providers to buy new technology. But Dr. Shalala said the greater use of electronic transactions could save the industry $30 billion over 10 years.</p>
        <p>Richard D. Marks, a lawyer at the firm of Davis Wright Tremaine, said the 1996 law ''will accelerate the use of information technology in the delivery of health care and will be a catalyst for hospitals and doctors to develop e-commerce strategies.''</p>
        <p>The industry will have two years to comply with many of the new rules. But Mr. Marks said, ''Hospitals, doctors and other health care professionals -- along with employers, insurance companies and all others who handle individual health care information in electronic form -- should begin preparing now to meet the high security and privacy standards'' being adopted by the government.</p>
        <p>The administration is also adopting stringent rules to protect the privacy of medical records and the security of health information that is stored or transmitted electronically.</p>
