        <p>TRACEY ULLMAN,  (www.purpleskirt.com)  Award-winning performer brings fashion to ''every woman''</p>
        <p>Tracey Ullman has achieved success in movies, television, theater, music and publishing. She is known for her comedic skills as a satirist and her repertory of characterizations, relying on a keen sense of fashion and costuming. She has brought her design expertise to Purpleskirt.com, a fashion Web site started with Stephanie Cone and Jeannine Braden, which also donates money to research for ovarian cancer.</p>

        <p>TRACEY ULLMAN,  (www.purpleskirt.com)  Award-winning performer brings fashion to ''every woman''</p>
        <p>Tracey Ullman has achieved success in movies, television, theater, music and publishing. She is known for her comedic skills as a satirist and her repertory of characterizations, relying on a keen sense of fashion and costuming. She has brought her design expertise to Purpleskirt.com, a fashion Web site started with Stephanie Cone and Jeannine Braden, which also donates money to research for ovarian cancer.</p>
        <p>Purpleskirt.com emphasizes individuality in fashion and offers choices for all sizes and shapes -- not just supermodel slender, Ms. Ullman said. ''I'm proud of Purpleskirt.com because it encourages individualism in the way women dress in a non-sizeist, non-ageist way,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Users can design their own outfits, choosing from a variety of designers, and can obtain advice from entertainment industry stylists and costume designers.</p>
        <p>Purpleskirt.com gives a 10 percent donation to the Ovarian Cancer Research Fund for any purple item that is purchased. During the week of Nov. 12, 10 percent of all sales will go to the research fund, and the site will be the host of the first ''O.C.R.F. Super Saturday'' garage sale of designer clothing and accessories on Nov. 12 in Los Angeles.</p>
