        <p>FEW meats are as tender, juicy and flavorful as good roast beef, yet none are easier to prepare. It needs nothing beyond salt and pepper and proper cooking. And while it is most commonly sliced thin, it can also be carved thick and served like steak, especially if you start with sirloin.</p>
        <p>Fillet, or tenderloin, which is supremely tender, is not only expensive but also nearly tasteless. If you cook it, you will need a sauce. Standing rib, the other common cut, is great but is usually sold in unwieldy cuts.</p>
        <p>Most supermarkets are aware of these challenges and offer cuts of round as ''roast beef.'' Round is the top part of the rear leg of the steer, and round by any name -- eye round, top round, bottom round -- is simply not tender enough to roast.</p>
        <p>Sirloin strip, though, is ideal for roasting. Also called New York strip, it has great texture and flavor, a reasonable price and can be cooked quickly and easily. This is the same cut that makes for some of the best steaks.</p>
        <p>The only drawback is that larger pieces are not routinely offered for sale. You have to tell the butcher you want a two- or three-pound piece of sirloin strip, essentially a steak cut as a roast. (I've done this in even a  mundane supermarket with no trouble.)</p>
        <p>Roasting is simple: Brown it in the oven, first on top, then on the bottom, and finally on each side. This method should leave it as crisp on the outside as if it had been grilled; the inside will be rare and juicy. A meat thermometer can help you judge doneness. It pays to undercook the meat slightly and let it sit for a few minutes before carving; this step not only makes carving easier but also prevents overcooking.</p>
        <p>This technique will work for larger roasts of sirloin strip as well; the cooking time will not be appreciably longer for a roast of four or five pounds because the meat is of relatively uniform thickness.</p>
        <p>The meat is excellent plain, but you can also make a quick red wine sauce for it after you remove the meat from the skillet. Just combine two cups of red wine with a quarter cup of minced shallots in the pan and reduce over high heat until about half a cup of syrupy liquid remains. Stir in a tablespoon of butter and some salt and pepper and spoon the sauce over the sliced meat.</p>
        <p>ROAST SIRLOIN  Time: 45 minutes</p>
        <p>1 2 1/2- to 3-pound piece sirloin strip  Salt and freshly ground black pepper.</p>
        <p>1. Place a heavy skillet, large enough to hold the roast, in the oven. Preheat the oven to 500 degrees.</p>
        <p>2. Sprinkle the meat liberally on all sides with salt and pepper. Place in the hot pan, with top (fatty) side down. Ten minutes later, turn and roast with the fatty side up. After 10 more minutes, turn and roast for 5 minutes on each side. The total cooking time is 30 minutes for meat to brown nicely all over.</p>
        <p>3. Test with a meat thermometer inserted into the center of the meat, about 1 inch from one of the ends. When it registers 120 degrees, meat will be rare to medium-rare. Cook longer if you like, but beware that from this point on it will increase a stage of doneness every 3 to 5 minutes.</p>
        <p>4. Let roast rest 5 to 10 minutes, then carve and serve with its juices, or with a simple pan sauce (see article).</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 to 6 servings.</p>
