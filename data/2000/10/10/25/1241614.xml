        <p>WHEN Taco Bell introduced a new tortilla chip last March, the company's public relations firm, Edelman Public Relations Worldwide, knew it would not be easy to generate coverage.</p>
        <p>''Let's face it, a new tortilla chip is not the most exciting thing in the world,'' said Nancy Ruscheinski, president of Edelman Interactive Solutions in Chicago.</p>
        <p>But Ms. Ruscheinski, whose division specializes in online strategies, knew she could circumvent the old-media gatekeepers by using the Internet to take a promotion campaign directly to the public.</p>
        <p>Initial public offering fever was raging at the time, so Edelman, one of the few public relations firms with a dedicated new-media unit, devised a timely ploy: the company sent 100,000 e-mail messages announcing that ''a hot new chip'' was coming on the market and directing people to a temporary Web site, www.new-chip.com. The site, designed by Edelman, offered vague promises of ''an incredible new opportunity'' and announced that the new chip ''would go public'' on May 1. Edelman also planted teaser messages in various online discussion groups dedicated to technology stocks.</p>
        <p>When the site opened, 75,000 people visited in the first 48 hours and learned that the chip in question was the kind used for dipping. Though the company received some complaints, including one angry letter from a man who had skipped work to get in on the initial offering, Edelman and Taco Bell were pleased with the flood of attention the campaign produced. And to Ms. Ruscheinski, it served as more evidence that the Internet was changing public relations.</p>
        <p>''In the traditional public relations model, you were at the mercy of the media when you wanted to reach your target audience,'' Ms. Ruscheinski said. ''But with the Internet, we suddenly have the luxury of being able to take our messages directly to the audience.''</p>
        <p>The nature of the World Wide Web -- where information flows with less filtering by media gatekeepers -- in some ways opens the floodgates. Companies like Edelman, the largest independently owned public relations firm in the world, are using the Internet to generate positive buzz and to respond to the negative kind.</p>
        <p>In terms of generating interest, publicists are becoming increasingly adept at promoting clients through e-mail campaigns, online newsletters and e-magazines (often written by the public relations firms) and news bulletins or ''info-bytes'' supplied to Internet portals.</p>
        <p>At the same time, Edelman keeps up with what others are saying about its clients by using a chat room monitoring system called I-Wire, which serves as a kind of early detection system for rumors. And if a rumor develops into a problem, Edelman and other firms are using the Internet as a first line of defense for clients by setting up rapid-response Web sites.</p>
        <p>It was during one such incident four years ago that Edelman began using the Internet as a primary tool.</p>
        <p>A client, Odwalla Inc., a fruit juice company based in Half Moon Bay, Calif., had produced apple juice containing E. coli bacteria, which was linked to the death of a 16-month-old girl and the illnesses of at least 70 other people in several states in 1996.</p>
        <p>Because Odwalla had relatively young customers who were media-smart, Edelman focused its response on a Web site that it created in one day. The site contained questions and answers about the situation, invited visitors to submit questions and provided links to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and to the Food and Drug Administration for information.</p>
        <p>Odwalla, which in 1998 pleaded guilty to violating federal food safety laws, began pasteurizing its juices after the outbreak and hired experts to help overhaul its safety systems.</p>
        <p>Edelman found that the site enabled Odwalla to present its case and reassure customers in a manner that was more timely and more manageable than holding news conferences and sending news releases. Odwalla survived the crisis and is still in business. Meanwhile, the experience was a turning point for Edelman in terms of the company's attitude toward the Internet.</p>
        <p>''Suddenly, we realized the value of the Web in crisis management,'' said the firm's president, Richard Edelman. ''From that point on, we began to think of it as the predominant way to release information in situations like that.''</p>
        <p>Edelman has since refined its rapid-response approach so clients can react even more quickly. The company has set up ''dark sites'' for each client, serving as place holders on the Web, and did some advance work by adding basic information about the company and products. If trouble arises, Edelman adds information pertaining to the situation.</p>
        <p>''We can have the site ready to go in two hours,'' Ms. Ruscheinski said.</p>
        <p>Edelman's interactive unit also uses the Web as a marketing tool. For example, to promote a flea-control product for the Bayer Corporation, Edelman created a Web site called Nofleas.com, intended to resemble a site designed for pet enthusiasts, with information on pet care and a section for veterinarians. Edelman manages the site and sends periodic e-mail messages reminding visitors to reapply flea-control treatment.</p>
        <p>''In that sense, we've moved beyond P.R. and almost are involved in the sales of the product,'' Ms. Ruscheinski said.</p>
        <p>Edelman is not the only firm using the Web to take a message directly to the public. Brodeur Worldwide in Boston, a unit of the Omnicom Group, creates online newsletters and magazines for its clients. A magazine may have 20 or more articles, some promoting client products and others providing industry news. The online publications are sent by e-mail to people considered to be part of a client company's main audience, including customers.</p>
        <p>Amos Kermisch, an executive vice president at Brodeur, said he considered these publications to be a form of news, ''though I would put the word news in quotes.''</p>
        <p>''What we're presenting is of interest to a company's customers, though it might not necessarily be interesting to the general news media,'' Mr. Kermisch added.</p>
        <p>The movement of public relations onto the Web has been a boon for firms like Edelman, whose interactive division generates $7 million a year, about 3 percent of the company's revenue.</p>
        <p>Moreover, the Internet is helping Edelman and other public relations firms to compete with advertising agencies, Mr. Edelman said. While most clients' advertising budgets have traditionally dwarfed their public relations budgets, he said the Internet might begin to change that because the medium lends itself less to advertising sound bites and more to informational promotions packaged like news reports.</p>
        <p>Because of this, ''public relations is starting to grab more of the Internet marketing turf right now,'' Mr. Edelman said, adding, ''As we become online content creators for our clients, the Internet could help us close the gap with ad agencies.''</p>
        <p>But the prospect of public relations firms' bypassing media outlets and going directly to the public has raised some concerns.</p>
        <p>''It's a problematic trend,'' said Stuart Ewen, author of ''PR! A Social History of Spin'' (Basic Books, 1996). Mr. Ewen noted that while publicists have always tried to disguise promotional campaigns, the Internet is rife with opportunities to deceive  because communication is often unfiltered and anonymous.</p>
        <p>''This is an environment that lends itself to disguise,'' Mr. Ewen said. Indeed, ''news stories'' generated by public relations firms can be difficult to distinguish from the real thing; many news portals now run online news releases from the PR Newswire and Businesswire services, with one-line identifiers that may be missed by some readers.</p>
        <p>AND sometimes, as in the tortilla-chip case, promotional messages are being planted anonymously on Web sites and in e-mail boxes. ''Now, everybody will need to become more conscious than ever before that the information they're receiving may be part of a promotional campaign,'' Mr. Ewen said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Edelman acknowledged that the Internet sometimes enabled public relations companies to mislead. And while he said he did not think the Taco Bell campaign's teaser messages were improper, he did think it was wrong for publicists to participate in online chat groups or discussions without identifying themselves.</p>
        <p>''I've told our people that they have to identify themselves or they'll be discovered, and then you lose all credibility,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''I think when you're communicating directly with the audience,'' he added, ''you must have a higher standard for accuracy and disclosure.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ewen said the efforts to use the Internet to circumvent media gatekeepers might raise problems beyond the ethical concerns.</p>
        <p>Traditionally, public relations campaigns have succeeded by channeling messages through established and trusted media.</p>
        <p>''The assumption by some P.R. people that they will benefit by bypassing the gatekeeper misses an important point,'' he said. ''The fact is, the gatekeeper provides legitimacy and credibility that is needed for the message to be effective.''</p>
