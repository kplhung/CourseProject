        <p>Seeking to restore its reputation for safety and respond to high gasoline prices, the Ford Motor Company announced today a half-dozen high-technology approaches to improving traffic safety and gas mileage.</p>
        <p>Among the devices demonstrated at a news conference were tiny cameras that will send images from all around a vehicle to the dashboard as well as bumper-mounted air bags for the protection of pedestrians. Ford also showed off a six-speed automatic transmission and computer-controlled engine cylinders that are designed to help the company meet its pledge, made last July, to improve the average fuel economy of its sport utility vehicles by 25 percent by 2005.</p>
        <p>Ford executives and engineers refused to say when the safety gear would go into mass production, a common tactic among automakers for competitive reasons, and acknowledged that some of the equipment could be 5 or 10 years away. All the engine and transmission changes are scheduled for introduction by 2005, however.</p>
        <p>General Motors and other automakers are racing to develop similar safety and fuel-efficiency technologies, although Ford went further in disclosing the progress it had made. Priya Prasad, Ford's top safety engineer, said he began working on today's announcement half a year ago -- long before Firestone announced on Aug. 9 the recall of 6.5 million tires mounted mainly on Ford Explorer sport utility vehicles and blamed for more than 100 deaths. The tire problems nonetheless came up repeatedly during the news conference, particularly because many of the technologies previewed today were aimed at addressing problems created by the growing number of sport utilities on the roads.</p>
        <p>None of the technologies are designed to prevent tire failures or reduce the odds that a sport utility would roll over if the tires fail, the combination of events that has led to most of the deaths linked to Firestone tires. Ford said in August that it would begin offering optional, computer-controlled stability systems on all its sport utilities, and it said last January that it would start equipping sport utilities with ceiling-mounted air bags to reduce the odds that occupants would be thrown through side windows during rollovers.</p>
        <p>Helen Petrauskas, the company's vice president for safety and environmental technologies, said today that Ford, like other automakers, was also working on technology to monitor tire pressure or temperature continuously. Firestone has said that its tires failed partly because of underinflation, which can cause tires to overheat and come apart.</p>
        <p>Some of the safety technology may raise privacy issues. G.M. has been criticized for installing ''black boxes'' as standard equipment in some luxury cars for the last two years to record the details of crashes.</p>
        <p>Ford demonstrated today a camera that takes a picture of the interior of a vehicle's passenger compartment every 15 seconds. When a crash occurs, the vehicle transmits to an emergency dispatch center the last photo taken before the crash plus a photo taken after the crash. Receiving both photos allows dispatchers to assess whether any occupants have been ejected from the vehicle and whether the occupants were wearing their seat belts before impact -- two considerations in deciding whether to send one or more ambulances to the site of the crash, said Srini Sundarajan, Ford's supervisor of safety research and development.</p>
        <p>Ford also showed cameras the size of a pencil eraser that can be mounted around a vehicle so as to provide drivers with views in all directions, including forward-facing cameras on the side mirrors to help drivers see around trucks ahead. Engineers showed that the forward-facing cameras would even allow motorists in a Lincoln Navigator sport utility to look around a Ford Excursion, which is so big that if it was a fraction of an inch wider, it would have to carry special running lights on the sides like those of freight trucks.</p>
        <p>Rear-facing cameras will include zoom lenses that will allow motorists to observe people and objects behind them in great detail.</p>
        <p>Only police vehicles will be manufactured with the ability to record images from the any of the exterior-view cameras, but other customers may choose to buy off the shelf and install their own recording ability on their vehicles, said Gary Strumolo, a Ford engineer who helped develop the system.</p>
        <p>Kary Moss, the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union in Michigan, said she was troubled by some of these features, particularly the zoom lenses. ''It certainly has Big Brother overtones,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Sara Tatchio, a Ford spokeswoman, said the system that takes pictures of a vehicle's interior, for transmission to rescue dispatchers, would be optional. As for the use of cameras on a vehicle's exterior, she said that was no different from mirrors, while adding that she was not aware of any discussion within the company on whether zoom lenses raised particular privacy concerns.</p>
