        <p>Executives are leaving agencies to open shops of their own.</p>
        <p>Two executives who had headed the Charlotte, N.C., office of the Martin Agency, each with the title of vice president and associate creative director, are leaving to open an agency there. John Boone, 39, and David Oakley, 38, are starting the agency with clients like the Charlotte Hornets and 123Hire.com.</p>
        <p>A billboard the agency produced, which gained national publicity, depicted a photograph of George W. Bush but carried the logo for Al Gore. The billboard was changed to reveal that it was an ad for 123Hire.com; the headline read, ''Today's job opening: proofreader.'' Computer users may vote to decide what Mr. Boone and Mr. Oakley will name the agency, by visiting either www.booneoakley.com or www.oakleyboone.com.</p>
        <p>Dean Jarrett, a spokesman at Martin in Richmond, Va., part of the Lowe Group unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies, said that Martin would continue to have a Charlotte office, to serve the Alltel account, but was not looking at this time to replace Mr. Boone and Mr. Oakley.</p>
        <p>And two executives from Messner Vetere Berger McNamee Schmetterer/Euro RSCG in New York, part of the Euro RSCG Worldwide unit of Havas Advertising, left to form Strategy Department in New York. Jim Huffstetler, 36, account director, and Nicole Minore, 29, senior account supervisor, become managing partners at Strategy Department, which will offer marketing and development strategies for new ventures.</p>
