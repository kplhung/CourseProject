        <p>Baseball isn't only about testosterone, of course.</p>
        <p>It can be about estrogen.</p>
        <p>A girlfriend of mine in New York decided to root for the Mets because she knows more cute guys she wants to date who are Mets fans. ''Some women pick their team based on the reproductive possibilities,'' she says.</p>
        <p>But on the subway to Yankee Stadium Sunday night there was an unbelievable whoosh of testosterone, as big, bristling guys piled on the D  train and loudly discussed Piazza vs. Jeter, Ali vs. Foreman and other assorted v's.</p>
        <p>It was worth the trip to the World Series if only to see this gratifying gender-bender: a blocklong line  slouching toward the men's room, and women streaming in and out of the ladies' room with no wait at all.</p>
        <p>Munching on some jumbo peanuts, I watched something I hadn't seen during a whole year covering presidential politics -- a moment of real, raw, electrifying ''Lay on, MacDuff'' testosterone: Roger Clemens throwing that jagged-edged bat, like a dagger, at Mike Piazza.</p>
        <p>I figured the cranky Yankee would get thrown out. But the pitcher who mistook a bat for a ball was only fined.</p>
        <p>I guess even when a player becomes totally unglued, it's hard to know how much testosterone is too much. The stuff, after all, is the fuel of sports, war and politics.</p>
        <p>Alan Dundes, a professor of anthropology at Berkeley, writes in his essay ''From Game to War'' that all games and sports are based on one theme that ''involves an all-male preserve in which one male demonstrates his virility, his masculinity, at the expense of a male opponent. One proves one's maleness by feminizing one's opponent. . . . No male wants to be considered a 'sissy' (from 'sister'). Thus males must aggressively seek to parry any such threatened thrusts.''</p>
        <p>So the innocent victim, Mike Piazza, ended up sounding defensive in his New York Post diary headlined ''Selfish or Gutless?'' implying that he could have beat up Roger Clemens if he had wanted to.</p>
        <p>Seeing real raging hormones made it clear just how trompe l'oeil the campaign's raging hormones are.</p>
        <p>All year Al Gore, W. and Rick Lazio have been contriving, on the advice of consultants and focus groups, to elaborately stage gender moments, some meant to appeal to women, some to men -- a lot of estrogen for the Oprah-Rosie-soccer-mom crowd, a lot of testosterone for all the voters who want to choose the top gladiator:</p>
        <p>A rooster-chested Al Gore, making up for his prissy sighs by trying to bear down in an intimidating way on W. and the audience at the final  debate; a squeaky Little Ricky, attempting to escape his soft good looks and Gingrich-lapdog image by getting in Hillary Rodham Clinton's face in their first debate.</p>
        <p>There was something that smacked of overcompensating, of trying too hard to be a Texas macho guy, in the way W. mocked an executed woman in a Talk magazine interview and gave that weird proud smile in the second debate while discussing prisoners to be executed in his state.</p>
        <p>A governor who usually schedules only 15 minutes to review death penalty cases, even as he makes more time for napping and jogging, should never indulge in smirking and swaggering when he talks about the high number of executions on his watch.</p>
        <p>Being wimps, being flighty, being uncompetitive, being pegged as Eastern effete elite -- this has long been the bete noir of the Bush dynasty. The Texas migration of the Connecticut clan was an attempt to prove mesquite manliness in the face of pampered Greenwich values.</p>
        <p>The Bush team has tried to make the most of Al Gore's Mike Piazza moments. It has delighted at the hopeless attempt of Mr. Gore to escape the Clinton shadow, even as the Shadow second-guesses and critiques from the sidelines, making it humiliatingly clear that the president does not think his vice president is cutting the mustard.</p>
        <p>And W. is still milking the flap over Naomi Wolf's alpha-male advice to Mr. Gore, the spectacle of a woman instructing a man how to be a man.</p>
        <p>At the Al Smith dinner, Mr. Bush joked that he had run into a woman coming off the elevator at the Waldorf, ''I think her name is Naomi or something like that,'' who had suggested that he wear more earth tones, less white tie.</p>
        <p>''Can you imagine a grown man,'' he asked to the roar of the crowd, ''paying $15,000 for somebody to tell you what to wear?''</p>
