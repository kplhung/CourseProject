        <p>THERE'S a shiny new face in the parade of glossy food magazines: Taste, a well-mannered publication just introduced by Williams-Sonoma. It is pretty enough, and it covers a broad territory: cooking, entertaining, wine, travel and chefs. But it lacks the depth or distinctive voice of Saveur or Cook's Illustrated.</p>
        <p>Its editor, Andy Harris, ran the Australian magazine Vogue Entertaining. In Taste, he writes articles and develops recipes -- this month on ''posh squash'' and ''distinctive desserts,'' among others. The first issue has articles on Parisian flea markets and cooking schools and on Christmas with Jean-Georges Vongerichten. The next issue -- there will be five a year -- will focus on American cooking.</p>

        <p>THERE'S a shiny new face in the parade of glossy food magazines: Taste, a well-mannered publication just introduced by Williams-Sonoma.

        <p>Deborah Madison and Joyce Goldstein are regular contributors, and so is Chuck Williams, 84, the founder of Williams-Sonoma, who writes a column and advises Mr. Harris. The store's products are occasionally promoted. For example, a food news feature includes two Williams-Sonoma items and one from Pottery Barn, a unit of Williams-Sonoma.</p>
        <p>For the first issue, 250,000 copies were printed. It costs $5 at Williams-Sonoma, Barnes &amp; Noble and Borders Books; by subscription, $20 a year: (800) 541-2233.</p>
