        <p>Never before have Vermont's autumn colors blazed so hot, some here are saying proudly these brilliant gilded days. Unfortunately, the same goes for Vermont's politics, others are saying with concern.</p>
        <p>From local races to the three-way contest for governor, this campaign season has a supercharged feel to many Vermonters, and not in a pleasant way.</p>
        <p>''The state of Vermont has never been more polarized,'' said Sean McKeon, a Republican candidate for the State Senate. ''This polarization is not like Vermont; it's very unrecognizable sometimes.''</p>
        <p>Two words explain the heat: civil unions. Though other issues are also at play, many people are calling the coming election a referendum on the civil unions law that made Vermont the first state in the country to offer gay couples virtually all the legal rights and benefits of marriage.</p>
        <p>The law, which went into effect in July, has galvanized opposition to some other changes here lately, including environmental rules and a law that revamps the school financing system. ''Take Back Vermont'' signs have sprouted in yards, and polls leave in question whether Gov. Howard Dean, the moderate Democrat who has governed for nine years, will keep his seat.</p>
        <p>A survey last week found that 48 percent of voters supported Governor Dean, a doctor, while his Republican challenger, Ruth Dwyer, a farmer, had support from 33 percent. Anthony Pollina, the Progressive Party candidate, logged 6 percent. The two men support civil unions;  Mrs. Dwyer opposes them.</p>
        <p>If no candidate wins more than 50 percent of the vote, then under Vermont law, the Legislature will choose  the next governor.</p>
        <p>But what kind of Legislature? Slim Democratic majorities control each house, but they may not survive November.</p>
        <p>''This is going to be one heck of a close election,'' said Don McGee, a tutor who attended a gubernatorial debate here tonight. Vermont ''is split down the middle.''</p>
        <p>''What happens on Nov. 7 is one thing,'' Mr. McGee said. ''What happens in January when the Legislature meets is going to be a donnybrook.''</p>
        <p>The state's split was not lost on any of the candidates tonight. Mr. Pollina called on Vermonters to put their division behind them. Dr. Dean said that ''the No. 1 task of the next governor is to establish a dialogue'' on the issue, because ''we can't continue as a state where the feelings are so strong on either side.''</p>
        <p>And Mrs. Dwyer said she believed that the state might not be able to reach ''closure'' on the civil union issue until people had a chance to vote on it.</p>
        <p>''I thought the state was divided two years ago,'' when educational financing was the big issue, she said. ''That's nothing compared to where we are today.''</p>
        <p>Some members of the ''Take Back Vermont'' camp say they are driven not by the single issue of civil unions, but by a broader anger at laws that seem alien to them.</p>
        <p>''The liberals have come into our state and they're intelligent but they have no hearts, they don't care about working people,'' said Corey Field, a baker who carried a Ruth Dwyer sign at the debate. ''We're losing our values of what we were. We were an agricultural state.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Dean, for his part, described the anger and hostility toward civil unions as the phenomenon alien to Vermont, saying: ''Our fundamental trust and respect for each other is the bedrock of any community, any community.''</p>
        <p>All the political tension carries one notable benefit for Vermont's democracy. As Chris Graff, the debate moderator, put it, ''I don't think voter apathy is going to be a problem this year in Vermont.''</p>
        <p>If Vermont's right wing is moved by opposition to civil unions, its left wing seems energized by the presence in the race of Mr. Pollina, a longtime organizer and lobbyist. Under new campaign finance rules in Vermont, Mr. Pollina qualified for nearly $300,000 in public money by gathering small donations from 1,500 Vermonters around the state.</p>
        <p>That gives him unusual financial leverage to compete with the major party candidates; Governor Dean, in particular, has worried aloud that Mr. Pollina will siphon off votes he needs. The arrangement also allows Mr. Pollina to play a role something like the campaign finance conscience of the race, frequently telling voters that his rivals were beholdened to special interests and represented ''politics as usual'' because they had taken money from their parties' national committees.</p>
        <p>Dr. Dean is playing the classic incumbent's role, pointing to the achievements of his tenure: the best record on child health insurance in the country, moves toward universal health care coverage, hundreds of thousands of acres of open land preserved. But, he says, he has more to do, beginning with healing the rift  caused by the civil-union law.</p>
        <p>Although he said he wanted to reconcile the two sides, he was not conciliatory about civil unions themselves. In the debate, he recalled a moment in college when he suddenly realized he was the only white in a room of African-Americans, and got a glimpse of how it felt to be in the minority. He also offered his medical opinion that most studies indicated that most gay men and lesbians were born that way, and he argued that people should not be castigated for choices they did not make.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Dwyer did not dwell on civil unions themselves, but rather used the passage of the law as an example of how, she said, the state government did not listen to the people. The Legislature passed the civil unions bill in response to a ruling by the State Supreme Court, despite calls from opponents for a referendum on the issue. Supporters argued that a referendum was not appropriate because the Supreme Court had found that gay couples' civil rights were being infringed upon, and basic rights should not be subject to a majority opinion.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pollina supported civil unions unequivocally, saying he was amazed at the morass of misinformation about homosexuality that the state had become mired in lately.</p>
        <p>He seemed to capture the urgency of the current campaign as he discussed how important it was to keep outside money out of it. The election, he said, ''is about the heart and soul of Vermont.''</p>
