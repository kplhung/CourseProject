        <p>THE 20 doctors in the Katonah Medical Group in northern Westchester County are not anti-technology. Some even describe themselves as techies, eager to try new gadgets and regularly surfing the Internet.</p>
        <p>They know that the Internet is the future, that it will ultimately improve the speed and accuracy of what they do, from billing insurance companies to prescribing drugs.</p>
        <p>So it is not out of ignorance that the doctors disregard most of the e-mail messages and phone calls from companies trying to sell Web design services or research databases. As the doctors see it, they are being prudent.</p>
        <p>They are getting wired slowly. So far, they have been transferring their medical records onto an electronic database that can be retrieved in-house and shared with laboratories. They are planning to send prescriptions to pharmacies over the Internet because their information technology consultant has convinced them that it could save time and reduce prescription errors.</p>
        <p>But the doctors were skeptical about much of the technology that their consultant, Larry Rabinowitz, had recommended. They did not see the need for a Web page. They were dubious about the value of personal digital assistants helping to obtain and update patient records when they visited patients at a hospital. And they gave mixed reviews to the electronic databases that supplied medical information.</p>
        <p>''At this point, we don't have a good way to assess what's good and what isn't, since there are so many twists to each product,'' said Dr. Narasimha Swamy, a surgeon with the practice. ''There will be a shakeout. I just want to stand by and see which products are really worthwhile.''</p>
        <p>Among the doctors, there was a range of opinions on how quickly to proceed, with some being more intrepid than others. Dr. Swamy and two of his colleagues discussed their views, revealing many of the obstacles that technology companies faced in wiring doctors' offices.</p>
        <p>Dr. Sheldon Axelrod, the president of the Katonah group, said he was among the most cautious there. He did not have a computer in his office -- just four doctors do -- and did not feel the need for one.</p>
        <p>''I'll find more use for a computer when all of the medical records are in electronic form, which will probably happen within a year,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Axelrod, who has been practicing for 12 years, also did not think he needed a personal digital assistant. He was happy taking notes on file cards that he carried with him.</p>
        <p>Dr. Harold Federman, an internist in the practice, has embraced information technology and urged his colleagues to be more open about trying new technology. He uses a digital assistant, as well as several electronic databases, among them the electronic version of the Physicians Desk Reference, the leading reference book of prescription drugs.</p>
        <p>''I can look up drug interactions in the blink of an eye, which I could never do before,'' Dr. Federman said.</p>
        <p>He praised the Internet for enabling him to take continuing education courses online and to keep up with medical news. He uses the Reuters health news service, but he is less pleased with other Internet services he has tried, like electronic access to journals.</p>
        <p>One concern that the Katonah doctors share is privacy. They know that if they  make patients' records available online, they could save time submitting insurance claims and sharing information with specialists who were treating their patients. And they know that companies like Healtheon and MedicaLogic say that they have the technology to keep records confidential.</p>
        <p>But the doctors will not consider making patient records available over the Internet until there are federal guidelines to ensure that the information remains private. The Department of Health and Human Services is expected to issue such guidelines this fall.</p>
        <p>Dr. Swamy questioned how secure information was on the Internet. ''Fifteen-year-old kids are stealing items over the Net,'' he said. ''Credit card numbers are being spirited away. All patient interactions should be confidential.''</p>
        <p>Even if privacy were not an obstacle, money would be. Mr. Rabinowitz said it would cost $100,000 to $300,000 for the group to get what he called ''a full Internet solution,'' which means having electronic medical records; sharing data with insurance companies, laboratories and outside health professionals; and communicating by e-mail message with patients.</p>
        <p>''Because of managed care, doctors really have to look at their costs,'' Mr. Rabinowitz said. He estimated that the electronic upgrades that the doctors were making cost $10,000 to $20,000.</p>
        <p>Perhaps more than most other professionals, doctors have reason to be wary when salesmen try to persuade them to buy new equipment.</p>
        <p>''Several years ago, we spent about $250,000 on a laser machine to do laparoscopic gall bladder surgery,'' Dr. Swamy said. ''But we found no advantage over the less expensive machine that we had been using, and some articles suggested that it might do more harm than good. We ended up using it as a doorstop.''</p>
