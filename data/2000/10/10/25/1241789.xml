        <p>When Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright arrives here on Wednesday to brief her South Korean and Japanese counterparts on her ground-breaking visit to North Korea, behind their smiles and obligatory congratulations, they will also have serious questions.</p>
        <p>Already there have been signs of concern in both countries, the United States' closest Asian allies, that the breakthrough could upset South Korea's own diplomacy with the North and make the possibility that Japan will obtain satisfaction on its longstanding grievances toward North Korea even more remote.</p>
        <p>The disparate displays of public enthusiasm and private concern about Dr. Albright's trip, and about a possible visit by President Clinton, vividly illustrate the awkward geometry of diplomacy, even among close allies, in northeastern Asia.</p>
        <p>Each partner is eager to see North Korea emerge from its cocoon and cease being a threat to stability. But for reasons of domestic politics and priorities, each ally might like to see events unfold in a slightly different sequence. It is a measure of the concern for sequencing and, above all, for avoiding major surprises that present and former officials in Japan and South Korea privately warn against repeating the so-called Nixon shock that they felt when the United States established high-level contacts with China nearly 30 years ago.</p>
        <p>For South Korea, by far the most enthusiastic about engagement with the North since President Kim Dae Jung took office more than two years ago, a quickly arranged visit by Mr. Clinton is being discussed as North Korea has frozen substantive cooperation with the South on a series of recent agreements.</p>
        <p>On Monday, Mr. Kim's office issued a statement saying, ''Inter-Korean and North Korea-U.S. relations are mutually complementary, and an improvement in one has the effect of boosting the other.''</p>
        <p>But given that it was Mr. Kim who started the ball rolling by pushing hard to bring the two longtime enemies into closer contact, the dramatic improvement in North Korea's relationship with the United States is reviving fears in foreign policy circles here of seeing inter-Korean ties relegated to the distant background. Indeed, for years before their summit meeting in June, North Korea had treated South Korean governments as nonentities and insisted on direct negotiations with the United States.</p>
        <p>The scant movement by North Korea on issues like regular visits between separated families, military and economic cooperation and a return visit here of the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Il, has become an embarrassment for the South Korean president. Many here fear that North Korea's success in engaging the United States at the highest levels will only worsen things.</p>
        <p>''There is that concern among people, because that is the pattern that Pyongyang has been following through the years,'' Han Seung Joo, a former South Korean foreign minister, said. ''Even now, North Korea is not carrying out the promises already made such as on issues like family reunification, economic cooperation, railroad development and on other things. Of course, there has been no progress at all on military issues.''</p>
