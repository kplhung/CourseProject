        <p>President Clinton called Yasir Arafat today to urge him to bring rioting in the West Bank and Gaza under control quickly. But Mr. Clinton received no assurances and no response to an invitation for Mr. Arafat to travel to Washington soon to map a way back to peace talks, administration officials said tonight.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton planned to speak with Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel promptly, the officials said, with a similar call for restraint and an invitation to a separate meeting with the president. But officials said the two leaders had not been able to speak.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton did not ask the leaders to visit at the same time, because, a senior administration official said, ''nobody thinks that would work right now.''</p>
        <p>Instead, the official said, Mr. Clinton hoped to bring quiet to the streets long enough for small steps to be taken toward resuming ''some kind of dialogue.''</p>
        <p>President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia also called Mr. Arafat, after having heard from Mr. Barak. Mr. Putin asked the Palestinians to demonstrate a ''maximum restraint to prevent a worsening of the crisis,'' the Kremlin said.</p>
        <p>The White House made its calls as Palestinian rioting abated somewhat for the second day today. But Israeli military officials were offering their assessment that the violence in the West Bank and Gaza was likely to continue for months.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the Israeli army said the nature of the conflict was changing from street battles to low-level warfare, ''with fewer incidents but harder ones involving roadside bombings, nighttime shootings and more accurate shootings.''</p>
        <p>Although some Palestinian militants had called for protesters to break through Israeli checkpoints into Jerusalem today, that did not occur. But one Palestinian was killed in Gaza, and another in the West Bank.</p>
        <p>White House officials who are watching the violence from afar are clearly concerned that the cease-fire accord that they reached last week in Egypt is in danger of complete collapse. ''The clear thrust of the call was that we need to see more progress on getting the Palestinian security forces to stop the violence,'' one senior official said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Arafat's diminishing control over the Palestinians in the streets  and a reluctance to compromise on the status of Jerusalem has driven Mr. Clinton to fits of anger, one official said, adding that on the telephone Mr. Arafat ''basically said he's happy to get together and talk sometime, but he doesn't want to take strong measures now.''</p>
        <p>In asking Mr. Barak to travel to Washington, Mr. Clinton may be seeking to head off the creation of a broad emergency government run by Mr. Barak and the Likud Party leader, Ariel Sharon. Although American officials have been careful to say publicly that the creation of an emergency government was Israel's business, officials here clearly believe that any such deal would end any hope of resuming peace talks.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, one official said, Mr. Clinton's message to Mr. Barak would be, ''We know you can't control every settler, but please keep the military's reactions commensurate'' to the Palestinian actions.</p>
        <p>Some Palestinian experts said it appeared that senior officials had made a quiet effort to calm the streets. School was out, in honor of the Muslim holiday for the prophet Muhammad's ascension to heaven. That put the youths who tend to congregate and throw rocks at home with their parents, many of whom frown on such a degree of involvement.</p>
        <p>In Israel, Mr. Barak continued his talks with Mr. Sharon. They were stumbling over two issues, how to share power and whether Mr. Barak will agree to renounce the peace proposals made in July at Camp David.</p>
        <p>Complicating matters, former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called Israel Radio from abroad to weigh in. Mr. Sharon and Mr. Barak have an interest in keeping Mr. Netanyahu politically sidelined. Mr. Netanyahu said he endorsed an emergency unity government for a limited time if the intense conflict with the Palestinians continued.</p>
