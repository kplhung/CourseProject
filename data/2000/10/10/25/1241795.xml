        <p>Angelo, Gordon &amp; Company, a New York hedge fund management company, has filed suit against Covad Communications, saying that the provider of high-speed Internet services misled investors about its financial situation. In a lawsuit filed in California Superior Court in Santa Clara, where Covad is based, Angelo, Gordon is seeking the rescission of more than $46 million of convertible notes it bought from Covad only days before the company revealed problems with overdue payments this month. The hedge fund manager claims the subsequent decline in Covad's stock price, to about $6.66 yesterday, deflated the potential value of holders' investment, which would have allowed investors to convert the securities at a price of $17.775.</p>
