        <p>President Clinton convened Democratic lawmakers on the South Lawn today for another in a series of events  promoting his budget proposals. Today, the topic was school construction. Last week, he played up the minimum wage and hate-crimes legislation. Before that, he spoke of the need to hire more teachers for the public schools.</p>
        <p>Each time, however, White House officials left the events feeling somewhat unsatisfied. News coverage has been sparse. Other events -- the World Series, violence in the Middle East, the defeat of Slobodan Milosevic, the latest from the campaign trail -- largely drowned out Mr. Clinton's words.</p>
        <p>For a president eager to do what he can to help Democrats triumph in November, this budget fight has been a bust. Major clashes have been minimal. Even the many skirmishes ending in White House victories do not seem to provide an appreciable lift to the Gore campaign. White House aides lament that nobody seems to be watching as the president tries one last round of legislative brinkmanship.</p>
        <p>''It's not on anybody's radar screen,'' a White House official involved in the negotiations grumbled this week.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton loved nothing better than the end-of-the-year budget wars when Newt Gingrich ran the House.  Negotiations were pitched battles. Even when he lost, which he occasionally did, the president turned differences between the parties into campaign issues that worked.</p>
        <p>But this year the White House is struggling even to engage the opposition. Staying above the fray is exactly the goal of Congressional Republicans, who have jumped back every time the president moves in to attack. Again and again, they have backed away from long-held views just to avoid a fight. That happened today on abortion, when Republicans agreed to drop restrictions for family planning groups that offer abortions or promote abortion rights.</p>
        <p>''We dare to be dull,'' said John Feehery, spokesman for House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois. ''We don't want a gun-slinging showdown at the O.K. Corral, like in the days of Newt Gingrich. We're just getting the nation's business done.''</p>
        <p>So far it seems to be working, although with dozens of administration officials blanketing the Hill to settle the remaining appropriations bills, it remains too early to declare this a harmonious budget session.</p>
        <p>''This is not over yet,'' cautioned Norman Ornstein, a Congressional expert at the American Enterprise Institute. ''The Republicans have so far shown a political skill that has been utterly lacking in the past. But if you end up with a confrontation and the president goes on national television 10 days before the election and says, 'I've tried everything I can do,' it could be the worst possible embarrassment for the Republicans.''</p>
        <p>So far, though, this year's fight has been a fender bender in contrast to  the train wrecks of past years. Four years ago, Mr. Clinton had used the budget battle to frame, and ultimately win, his presidential race. He tied his opponent, Bob Dole, to Mr. Gingrich and denounced Congressional Republicans' efforts to eliminate the Department of Education and cut spending for other popular programs.</p>
        <p>This year, much to the frustration of the White House, the Republican presidential candidate, Gov. George W. Bush, successfully distanced himself from the wrangling on Capitol Hill. And despite White House efforts to use the annual budget standoff to frame the issues in the campaign, the negotiations have so far resulted in little more than a yawn.</p>
        <p>The White House has been bending over backward to attract attention.</p>
        <p>Today, Mr. Clinton climbed a ladder and hammered some nails into a mock schoolhouse on the South Lawn. He was flanked by schoolchildren and construction workers in hard hats.</p>
        <p>''The little red schoolhouse behind me was erected as evidence of the commitment of all of us here to give our children the safest and best schools in the world,'' Mr. Clinton said. ''In its unfinished state, it's also a symbol of the unfinished work still before the Congress. Nearly two months into the new school year, the majority leadership still hasn't given a single dime for school construction and modernization, not even enough to build a one-room schoolhouse.''</p>
        <p>Still, major disagreements loom and Mr. Clinton has not given up his efforts to paint all Republicans -- from Mr. Bush on down -- as conservative extremists.</p>
        <p>The government will shut down on Wednesday night unless the White House agrees to extend its operation. Mr. Clinton has said he will sign a resolution that keeps the government operating for no more than 24 hours. Any longer, he has said, would  encourage more Republican delay.</p>
        <p>Before Mr. Clinton staged his education event today, Congressional Republicans called their own news conference to say they were willing to match the president's $1.3 billion demand for school renovation funds. Mr. Hastert, however, insisted that each school district have the right to use the money for its most pressing needs.</p>
