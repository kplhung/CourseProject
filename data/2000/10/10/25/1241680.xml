        <p>The Silk Road Project, a multicultural brainchild of the cellist Yo-Yo Ma that has long been a subject of vague rumor and speculation in the music business, takes on shape today with a public announcement of its various activities.</p>
        <p>An exploration of the multifarious musical cultures centering on the Silk Road, the ancient network of trade routes between East Asia and the Mediterranean, the project pulls together native performers and existing music from many countries and newly commissioned works in mixed instrumentations and idioms. Sixteen such works exist, and some have been performed in workshops, including one last July at the Tanglewood Festival in Massachusetts.</p>
        <p>The project's high-profile activity is a series of festivals in ''partner cities'' around the world, scheduled to begin next August at the Salzburg Festival in Austria. Further events are to take place in October 2001, in Washington, in collaboration with the Washington Performing Arts Society, and in Central Asia. Then, after festivals in Japan and around Europe, the tentative schedule calls for outings at Cal Performances in Berkeley, Calif., in April 2002, and at Carnegie Hall and with the Seattle Symphony the next month. The major event occurs in Washington in June and July 2002, when the Silk Road Project takes over the Smithsonian Folklife Festival, extending beyond music to crafts, sport, dance and cuisine.</p>
        <p>''The living events are merely the tip of the iceberg,'' Mr. Ma said last week from Tampa, Fla., where he was performing. Other features of the project include recordings, expected to be released by Sony and Folkways; a Web site, to be up in about six months; and a variety of educational activities. More workshops are scheduled, and more commissions are being contemplated.</p>
        <p>''We're trying to see whether it is possible to create a social and cultural currency that doesn't take away any of the essentials of the various idioms,'' Mr. Ma said. ''In a way, it's no different from what composers have always done, finding ways of referring to and acknowledging other cultures.''And how much of an advance will this project represent over pop music's longtime involvement with other idioms around the world? ''We're trying not only to locate talent and traditions but also to create pocket communities and other sustainable factors,'' Mr. Ma said.</p>
        <p>''We're trying to create culture bricks,''  Theodore Levin, the project's executive director, elaborated in a separate conversation at his office in Midtown.</p>
        <p>''The project is nothing new,'' he said. ''But it's a question of scale, of the global nature of the project. And we're completing the circle, taking the programs back to the lands of the Silk Road themselves. Yo-Yo's involvement was important, to give the project stature.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, the many grants in hand include one from the Aga Khan Trust for Culture, to finance the programs in Central Asia.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ma conceived the project in 1998 after venturing into Appalachian music and the tango. It took shape through informal discussions with friends and colleagues, and formal symposiums with experts in diverse fields. At one such symposium, in Paris in 1998, Mr. Ma met Mr. Levin, the author of ''The Hundred Thousand Fools of God: Musical Travels in Central Asia'' (Indiana University Press), who is on a three-year leave from Dartmouth.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levin is an ethnomusicologist, in standard parlance, though he prefers ''musical ethnographer.'' His point is that ''ethnomusicology'' implies a Eurocentric viewpoint, there being no such thing as ''ethnomusic,'' and ethnography can be applied to any music, including Western classical.</p>
        <p>Similarly, Mr. Levin said: ''Success in our project would make the term 'world music' obsolete. It is simply a catchall for everything but Eurocentric music. Instead, we would talk about just 'music.' ''</p>
        <p>At a time when international travel and free exchange have mitigated national and regional styles in, say, Western singing and orchestral sound, is there danger here of a larger homogenization of styles?</p>
        <p>''We hope to amplify the voices of local musicians trying to represent authentic traditions that are in danger of being drowned out by popular culture or nationalism,'' Mr. Levin said. ''We want to be allies of these people in their pursuit of the spirit of the ancestral, but also to acknowledge their desire to be contemporary people.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ma, for his part, said: ''My experience of working with traditional cultures is that as I learn to appreciate the different styles and forms that give rise to expression, it makes everything I do more distinct.''</p>
