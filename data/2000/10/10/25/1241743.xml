        <p>Vice President Al Gore is in excellent health and has not taken a sick day in eight years in the White House, Mr. Gore and his doctor said in their first full interviews about Mr. Gore's health. Mr. Gore is ''fit for duty,'' Dr. Richard J. Tubb, a White House physician and Mr. Gore's personal doctor since mid-1995, said of his patient on a flight on Air Force Two from Milwaukee to Washington on Oct. 11.</p>
        <p>The Democratic presidential nominee has put off a physical exam. ''I have been begging Dr. Tubb to schedule it,'' he said drily. Speaking of checkups, Mr. Gore went on: ''I love them! Doesn't everybody?''</p>
        <p>Turning serious, Mr. Gore said he and Dr. Tubb had discussed the recommended intervals for routine checkups. Mr. Gore's last two checkups were about 18 months apart, on May 7, 1999, and Dec. 23, 1997. Dr. Tubb said he followed general medical guidelines that in recent years have focused more on the timeliness of performing certain screening tests like measuring blood pressure and detecting early colon cancer than on general physical exam.</p>
        <p>''I opted to go close to the outer boundary because I am involved in a national campaign where every day and every half-day means a lot,'' Mr. Gore said. ''So I don't feel I am sacrificing anything by maximizing all the hours I have between now and Nov. 7.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore, who has never suffered a serious illness, looks younger than his 52 years. He attributed his current good health to a vigorous daily exercise program that has included running a marathon in 1997 and climbing Mount Rainier in Washington State in 1999. Vitamins are the only medicines he takes regularly, he said as he sat on a couch in his cabin with this reporter, who is a physician. Also present were Dr. Tubb and Chris Lehane, a press aide.</p>
        <p>To relieve stress, Mr. Gore said, he exercises, listens to music, prays and meditates. ''If I've got a negotiating session or I have got a meeting that has a very high stakes outcome,'' Mr. Gore said, ''instead of using the last four or five minutes to cram more details into my head, I will just relax and just slow down.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore said he smoked a pack a day as a senior at Harvard and quit five years later because ''I realized that it was just awful for me, quite some time before I finally stopped.''</p>
        <p>He is also a nail-biter. In the interview his nails were bitten to ragged edges. Asked if this was a lifetime habit, Mr. Gore said he did it ''every once in a while'' and did not link it to nervousness or anything else.</p>
        <p>In May 1999 Mr. Gore's blood pressure was a normal 140/85 and a treadmill test showed his heart function was excellent.</p>
        <p>Dr. Tubb said he would check Mr. Gore's cholesterol and other blood lipids at his next exam because his cholesterol and one blood lipid had been in the borderline high region.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's total cholesterol of 231 was higher than the ideal of less than 200, and his L.D.L. (low density lipoprotein, or bad cholesterol) was an unfavorable 157, higher than the ideal of 130 or less. His H.D.L. (high density lipoprotein, or good cholesterol) was a favorable 55, above the ideal of 35.</p>
        <p>Dr. Tubb said he had not prescribed a cholesterol-lowering drug because Mr. Gore had no other risk factors for heart disease and did not meet criteria in national guidelines for such therapy.</p>
        <p>The interviews continued the practice of The New York Times of questioning candidates for president and other high political offices and, with their permission, their doctors about their medical conditions.</p>
        <p>Dr. Tubb, a family practitioner in the Air Force, was extensively interviewed separately in the White House before the interview and again by telephone after it.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's running mate, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, has also agreed, through his aides, to an interview with The Times about his health.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, after months of requests, a spokesman for Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the Republican nominee, said Mr. Bush would permit his doctor to be interviewed by The Times. But the governor has so far declined to be interviewed. His running mate, Dick Cheney, has released doctors' letters summarizing his health but has not responded to repeated requests for interviews with him and his doctors.</p>
        <p>Every other day, Mr. Gore said, he does a strength workout. ''I do 150 push-ups and 100 sit-ups'' and other exercises, including lifting weights. ''Then,'' he went on, ''I run or sometimes Stairmaster five to six days a week.'' Mr. Gore said he was bad at downhill skiing and mountain climbing, but climbed because it is ''something my son and I can do together.''</p>
        <p>He added, ''Both require every erg of mental energy that I have so that when I have completed a few days of it, I find that I am completely refreshed from not having been able to think at all about my job.''</p>
        <p>Asked whether a president should take the risks of mountain climbing, he said he would not take any that were unreasonable. Climbing can be  ''perfectly reasonable,'' depending on the experience and skill of the climbing party, the mountain, routes taken and weather, Mr. Gore said.</p>
        <p>The vice president has escaped lasting physical limitations from broken bones, torn tendons and pulled muscles suffered in sports. He tore his Achilles' tendon playing basketball on Saturday, Aug. 20, 1994, underwent surgery the same day and on Monday was working at home.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore and his family went through a terrifying ordeal in 1989 when his 6-year-old son, Albert, was struck by a car and suffered a serious head injury. At the time, they participated in family counseling on the advice of doctors at Johns Hopkins Hospital ''because the great stress associated with an incident like that is something that sometimes can affect the entire family,'' Mr. Gore said. Referring to his wife, Mr. Gore went on:</p>
        <p>''They had a session for Tipper, me and the siblings while my son was recovering and just went through the reasons why some families find it useful to sit down and talk about the way each family member is handling a challenge of that kind.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore said he did not remember the specific details but thought that a psychologist had led the talk. ''It wasn't a psychiatrist,'' but ''it would have been fine if it was,'' Mr. Gore said. ''I am glad that we did it.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Tubb said Mr. Gore had not sought care from a psychiatrist, psychologist or counselor other than after his son's accident.</p>
        <p>In discussing Mr. Gore's family medical history, Dr. Tubb said he had not examined Mr. Gore's father, Albert Sr., but he believed that his death at age 90 in 1998 was from complications of Alzheimer's disease. Asked about the possibility his father had Alzheimer's, Mr. Gore rose forward on the couch and expressed surprise, saying, ''He did?''</p>
        <p>Speaking of his father, a former senator from Tennessee, Mr. Gore said, ''There is no doubt that he had some form of dementia before he died, but I really do not know exactly what kind it was.''</p>
        <p>He said he attributed his father's dementia, which he said was present for a year or two before his death, to a severe head injury his father suffered in his late 80's. A bull was acting up and the senior Mr. Gore whacked it on the nose. ''The bull upended him and my father landed on his head,'' Mr. Gore said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore said no other blood relatives had suffered dementia.</p>
        <p>Even if Mr. Gore's father also did have Alzheimer's, the son's chances of developing the disease in the next decade are less than 1 percent, about the same as any other individual the same age, Alzheimer experts said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's schedule influences how long he sleeps. He works best when he sleeps eight hours, but he usually gets only seven, he said. He catches up by sleeping longer the next night or taking a catnap, and envies others who can take a nap at will. ''I can't,'' Mr. Gore said.</p>
        <p>At his last physical, Mr. Gore stood 6 feet one inch and weighed 195 pounds -- a pound less than when he entered Congress in 1977 and 15 pounds less than his heaviest weight, 210 pounds, in January 1994. Aides said they could not provide a more recent weight.</p>
        <p>Dr. Tubb, a nutritionist and a physiologist jointly recommended that Mr. Gore eat a diet of high complex carbohydrates, low saturated fats and high fiber to control his cholesterol. Mr. Gore said he ''very rarely'' drank alcohol and usually chose his menus. Referring to the salad and baklava that were served on the flight, Mr. Gore said he ate ''only 3 pieces of baklava today instead of the five I wanted.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore, who began using contact lenses for distance last year, said he ''can go perfectly well without them, but if I want to make sure that I can pick up details at a distance, like when I go to my son's football game, I will put two contacts in.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore tested negative for H.I.V., the AIDS virus, as part of applying for a life insurance policy in 1997, Dr. Tubb said.</p>
        <p>The year before, he had a generally nonspreading type of cancer, a basal cell, removed from his skin. In his last physical, there was no evidence of prostate cancer and his P.S.A. was a normal 0.55. He also had a normal examination of the lower part of his colon and is due for another exam this year.</p>
