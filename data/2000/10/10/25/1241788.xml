        <p>Over the last week, the No. 4 train has had more than its share of baseball-related attention. Even the unsung D train to Yankee Stadium has garnered a little. But perhaps no New York subway line associated with the game of baseball has been placed under quite so intense a worldwide gaze as the No. 7 train.</p>
        <p>It all started, of course, with Atlanta reliever John Rocker's crudely creative sociological observations about the No. 7 line's polyglot ridership. But the attention -- newspaper reporters prowling the platforms, television crews from Brazil and Japan and Germany joining sleepy riders on their morning commutes -- seemed to endure in part because the No. 7 train, maybe more than any other, does seem to have sprung right from the mind of a movie set designer.</p>

        <p>Over the last week, the No. 4 train has had more than its share of baseball-related attention. Even the unsung D train to Yankee Stadium has garnered a little. But perhaps no New York subway line associated with the game of baseball has been placed under quite so intense a worldwide gaze as the No. 7 train.</p>
        <p>It all started, of course, with Atlanta reliever John Rocker's crudely creative sociological observations about the No. 7 line's polyglot ridership. But the attention -- newspaper reporters prowling the platforms, television crews from Brazil and Japan and Germany joining sleepy riders on their morning commutes -- seemed to endure in part because the No. 7 train, maybe more than any other, does seem to have sprung right from the mind of a movie set designer.</p>
        <p>In Queens, its rusty Redbird trains travel not underground but along high trestles, weaving through warehouses and graffiti-covered rooftops with the Manhattan skyline looming in the distance. The train's interior lights oscillate off and on like a scene from ''The Taking of Pelham One Two Three,'' and its riders look like a public service poster for the United Nations.</p>
        <p>And now, with the World Series shifting to Shea Stadium, the focus on the No. 7 is back. And more than a few regular No. 7 riders are already wishing for it to go away. They would like the world to give them their train back, please.</p>
        <p>''There has been so much attention on this one train,'' said Lesley Ingram, 29, a New York City Transit worker who was catching the train at Shea Stadium-Willets Point to go home yesterday. ''You know, this train really isn't any different from any other train in the city. All of them go through places where you've got people from all over the world living, right? Why is this train so special?''</p>
        <p>As she spoke, seven still photographers and a television crew paced up and down the opposite platform. Many passengers emerged from the train explaining that they had no tickets, were not particularly interested in baseball and were just trying to get home.</p>
        <p>''At first,'' said Ms. Ingram, ''it's kind of fun, all the television. But then you get tired of it.''</p>
        <p>Her opinion was shared by about a dozen other regular No. 7 riders interviewed yesterday. But the sentiment did not seem to slow down any of the journalists, who at times, several hours before Game 3, actually outnumbered waiting passengers.</p>
        <p>A film crew working for the National League buttonholed passengers near one stairwell. Masayo Kawaguchi, a Japanese television reporter, and her cameraman positioned themselves near another. Some riders decided, shrewdly, to use the attention to do a little lobbying for their cause.</p>
        <p>''The No. 7 train in the rush hour does not have good service,'' announced Aslan Mohamed to a reporter. ''For regular customers, it is very, very bad. Please put that in your story.''</p>
        <p>And, of course, there were others who did not believe they had quite used up their 15 minutes of fame.</p>
        <p>''I think this is kind of nice myself,'' said Irving Bynum, 37, a No. 7 train conductor who was trying to steer television crews his way and away from a fellow conductor, Mike Pettinato, who was interviewed by four television crews after the John Rocker episode.</p>
        <p>''Look at those trash cans,'' Mr. Bynum said. ''They just got repainted. You can almost see yourself in those trash cans.''</p>
        <p>He then yelled across the platform at a photographer: ''Hey, aren't you going to take a picture of me?''</p>
        <p>Bismil Khan, a 54-year-old auto body shop worker, was also craving a little attention, but he was more selective.</p>
        <p>''No TV?'' he asked a reporter. ''Newspaper? Oh, too bad.''</p>
