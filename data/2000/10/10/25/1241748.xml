        <p>The embattled mayor of Union City, N.J., resigned yesterday, allowing a county official who had been pushing for a mayoral recall election to take office.</p>
        <p>Mayor Raul Garcia, who has been under fire recently for his economic decisions and his political ambitions, handed his resignation to the city clerk at 3 p.m. Four hours later, Brian Stack, a Hudson County freeholder, was appointed by the Union City Board of Commissioners to the office abandoned by Mr. Garcia.</p>
        <p>Mr. Garcia will retain the State Assembly seat from the 33rd District, which he has held since 1993.</p>
        <p>No one in the mayor's office answered telephone calls seeking comment last night. A city spokeswoman said the city had no comment.</p>
        <p>''I was shocked at this turn of events,'' Mr. Stack said. ''I'd heard these rumors for the past couple of days, but I never expected it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Stack has criticized Mr. Garcia, 36, saying he ignored the city's financial realities by granting raises to municipal employees and a tax cut to residents that have contributed to what he says is a $12 million budget deficit -- a gap that Mr. Garcia contends is only $5 million. Mr. Stack was trying to raise the necessary 6,700 signatures on a petition for a recall vote.</p>
        <p>The resignation of Mr. Garcia ends his two-year reign as mayor, even though most of his real political power was already taken from him in July. That was when Mr. Garcia's four fellow members on the Board of Commissioners stripped him of his position as commissioner of public safety and recreation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Garcia, a graduate of New York University Law School, was tapped at age 28 for his State Assembly seat. But since becoming mayor, he has found himself at odds with Robert Menendez, his former mentor, who is now the fourth-ranking Democrat in the House and holds the Congressional seat that Mr. Garcia has been coveting.</p>
