        <p>Roger Clemens survived an inquiry into his bat-throwing incident, avoiding suspension for the rest of the World Series. But the Yankees' controversial pitcher was fined $50,000 yesterday, matching the stiffest non-drug-related fine ever levied against a player.</p>
        <p>Frank Robinson, baseball's vice president of on-field operations, said Clemens was fined for inappropriate conduct in the first inning of Game 2, when Clemens fielded the jagged barrel of Mike Piazza's broken bat and fired it across the first-base line, just ahead of where Piazza was running.</p>
        <p>The umpires did not eject Clemens, saying they didn't believe he had thrown the barrel at Piazza, whose bat broke into three pieces when he hit a foul ball.</p>
        <p>''It was an emotional reaction,'' Ed Montague, the umpiring crew chief, said after the game.</p>
        <p>But Robinson, who had a good view of the incident from his second-row seat behind home plate, deemed it an inappropriate reaction, just as the Mets had in their comments after the game and the next day.</p>
        <p>''It was a reckless type of action on his part,'' Robinson said at Shea Stadium before Game 3.</p>
        <p>He said that he did not look to see if there was intent behind the toss. ''I looked at the action itself,'' he said. ''I don't think intent was the important thing to try to prove.'' However, he added, ''If we felt there was intent, it would have been a much more severe penalty.''</p>
        <p>Robinson said he spoke with Clemens and Piazza, among others, before making his decision.</p>
        <p>Clemens has the right to appeal the fine but made no immediate decision on whether he would take that step.</p>
        <p>''I want to stay focused on the task at hand, helping my team win the World Series,'' the pitcher said in a statement, ''so I do not intend to consider the question of an appeal or respond to questions about the fine or the incident itself until this series is over.''</p>
        <p>The $50,000 penalty matches the amount Albert Belle was fined for an incident during the 1995 World Series. Belle unleashed an abusive tirade at an NBC reporter before Game 3. Belle accepted the fine rather than a 10-game suspension that Commissioner Bud Selig held out as an alternative. He was also ordered to undergo counseling.</p>
        <p>Steve Phillips, the Mets' general manager, said he was satisfied with the Clemens fine.</p>
        <p>''I certainly wasn't calling for his suspension from the Series,'' Phillips said, ''and I don't think any of our players are looking for him to be suspended.'' He added, ''Our preference is that if we have a chance to win the World Series, we'd like to do it with both teams at full strength.''</p>
        <p>The bat toss has taken over the World Series. It is a subject that promises not to go away and will most likely become full blown again if there is a Game 6 and Clemens starts it, as he is scheduled to do.</p>
        <p>The Yankee players have declined to discuss the incident. They had more to say last night about the fine than they had said about the bat toss.</p>
        <p>''That's ridiculous,'' Jeff Nelson said. ''If they're going to fine Roger for doing that, they should fine Mike Hampton for throwing at Justice. Everyone knew he did it on purpose.'' Hampton hit Justice with a pitch in the sixth inning of Game 2 with two out and a runner at second base.</p>
        <p>Jose Canseco did a double take when he heard about the fine. ''I'm in shock,'' he said. ''That's a very large fine. I think it makes this issue bigger really. Now the issue is just going to keep going. I thought it was over with. There was no contact. No one got hurt -- this time.''</p>
        <p>Manager Joe Torre basically declined comment, saying only, ''What did he do, miss curfew?''</p>
        <p>Alan Hendricks, one of Clemens's agents, chided reporters, particularly those from New York newspapers, for what he felt was their prolonging the matter.</p>
        <p>''We want to let the players play the game,'' he said. ''Let them play the game. This should be the absolute neatest World Series, and the focus on this has taken on a life of its own.''</p>
        <p>Clemens, of course, gave birth to the issue when he threw the bat.</p>
        <p>''What he doesn't have is the same respect from people within this game that he used to carry with him,'' Todd Zeile of the Mets had said the day before. ''If that was me, that's something I would care about. I don't know if he cares about it. It's not only the incidents, but it's the reaction to them and the excuses he has given. That has created some doubt in people's minds about his character and the respect people had for him.''</p>
