        <p>A common theme is emerging on newspaper opinion pages as they begin issuing their endorsements for the Senate race in New Jersey. Those that favor the Democratic candidate, Jon S. Corzine, do so in spite of what they call his campaign spending excesses. Those who favor the Republican, Representative Bob Franks, do so largely because of Mr. Corzine's spending.</p>
        <p>The New York Times editorial board endorsed Mr. Franks while acknowledging that ''if political philosophy were the only consideration, we would be for Mr. Corzine.'' [Editorial, Page A26.]</p>
        <p>The Times called Mr. Corzine ''a commendably compassionate liberal,'' but asserted that he ''has not labored to master details about the costs and administration of his ambitious proposals on health care.'' The editorial condemned Mr. Corzine's political tactics, calling him ''tone-deaf to the need to restrain his own spending'' and saying his campaign contributions to Democrats and others ''recalled the abuses of old-time machine politics.'' It referred specifically to  a $25,000 donation Mr. Corzine's foundation made to a church whose minister later helped secure an important endorsement for him.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine on Sunday received the endorsement of the editorial page of New Jersey's largest newspaper, The Star-Ledger of Newark, which described the race as ''a choice between a polished professional who wants a promotion and a restless rookie with an ambitious agenda.''</p>
        <p>The editorial called Mr. Franks ''a competent conservative'' and ''an insider who will vote with the Republican leadership on most issues,'' but added: ''The problem with Franks is that he doesn't stand for much. His vision for the future America is a nation pretty much as you see it today -- except that he would be sitting in the Senate.''</p>
        <p>The Star-Ledger called Mr. Corzine's spending ''obscene,'' and criticized him for making ''exaggerated claims'' about his proposals for expanded government programs. But it praised him for supporting a ''politically dangerous'' health insurance plan.</p>
        <p>On Monday, Mr. Franks was endorsed in an editorial in The Courier-Post of Cherry Hill, which called him ''far more representative of the New Jersey populace than Corzine,'' and one in The Press of Atlantic City, which blasted Mr. Corzine as ''an unabashed liberal'' who was out of step with his own party. Both editorials focused on Mr. Corzine's campaign spending.</p>
        <p>The editorial board of The Philadelphia Inquirer, which circulates in the southern third of New Jersey, endorsed Mr. Franks today, noting his ''deep experience'' and calling him ''a smart, articulate, moderate lawmaker who would chart a sane path for using any surpluses: Don't risk huge tax cuts, pay down the federal debt, invest in children and entitlements, do some targeted tax relief.''</p>
        <p>The editorial cast doubt on whether Mr. Corzine could accomplish his ''worthy goals'' in the Senate. About his spending, it asked, ''Will liberals who wink at this sale of a Senate seat because they like Mr. Corzine's politics feel so comfortable when a conservative tycoon adopts his playbook the next time around?''</p>
