        <p>LET the timid eat candy corn. Kitchen Market in Chelsea is importing chocolate and jellied sweets this month that are just as sugary and even more symbolic than the harvest kernels, but it takes nerve to pop them into your mouth.</p>
        <p>The little candies look like nothing more than brown and blue blobs, but on closer inspection they are edible skulls, some of chocolate and the others on the firmer side of Jell-O. Each has a festive appearance, thanks to a flower or scroll of hard sugar icing on top -- an odd combination of cute and ghoulish.</p>

        <p>LET the timid eat candy corn. Kitchen Market in Chelsea is importing chocolate and jellied sweets this month that are just as sugary and even more symbolic than the harvest kernels, but it takes nerve to pop them into your mouth.</p>
        <p>The little candies look like nothing more than brown and blue blobs, but on closer inspection they are edible skulls, some of chocolate and the others on the firmer side of Jell-O. Each has a festive appearance, thanks to a flower or scroll of hard sugar icing on top -- an odd combination of cute and ghoulish.</p>
        <p>They are in the Mexican tradition of edible symbols for the Day of the Dead, or All Saints Day, Nov. 1. Breads are common for the observance, but candy skulls have a long history in Mexico. Dona Abramson, the owner of Kitchen Market, said the candies, and toy skeletons and coffins, are a playful way to involve children in honoring the dead. ''It teaches them that death is part of life, and it's not something to be afraid of,'' she said. ''That's why the skulls are often made to be funny looking.''</p>
        <p>The candy skulls used to be made only from a white paste of egg whites and sugar, dried and elaborately decorated. Ms. Abramson said those were meant to be placed on the altar honoring a particular soul. But the chocolate and jelly skulls are meant to be eaten.</p>
        <p>The jellied skulls are covered in coarse sugar. The chocolate ones are waxy. Both should appeal to the kind of candy eater who likes biting the head off a chocolate Easter bunny.</p>
        <p>Chocolate skulls are $1.50 each and jellied skulls are $2 each at Kitchen Market, 218 Eighth Avenue (21st Street), (212) 243-4433.</p>
