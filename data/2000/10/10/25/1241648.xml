        <p>THEIR euphoria has waned, but some venture capitalists remain hopeful about e-health companies, which use the Internet to disrupt antiquated ways of doing business in the specialized and fragmented health care industry.</p>
        <p>''There's a deep-seated inefficiency and disorganization in health care, and a deep-seated resistance to change,'' said Barbara Santry, a partner at Capstone Ventures, a venture capital firm in Menlo Park, Calif. ''If you could make a difference, the prize is probably the biggest, because health care is the largest single industry in the U.S. economy.''</p>
        <p>Yet e-health's promise has its perils. Memories are still fresh of the high-concept consumer health Web sites that went public at valuations that burned white-hot, then crashed. ''The e-health stocks were a Wall Street event, as opposed to a health care event,'' Ms. Santry said. ''People like myself have become much more interested in the path to profitability.''</p>
        <p>Accordingly, many of the e-health companies that receive venture financing sell proprietary technology aimed at streamlining the health care infrastructure. High on the list are services that eliminate tedious manual labor and paperwork, thus reducing costs and bureaucracy. These intermediaries tend to pocket a regular fee for their work, which provides them with a relatively predictable stream of earnings.</p>
        <p>''We're trying to look for these broad waves of innovation,'' said Eugene Hill, a general partner at another venture capital firm, Schroder Ventures Life Sciences in Boston. ''If it's really valuable, somebody's willing to pay for it.''</p>
        <p>Health care investors also have a high degree of patience for deals to play out, especially compared with venture capitalists who back the momentum-driven information technology start-ups that have made headlines and overnight fortunes. ''We don't think in terms of a good deal having to return $1 billion,'' said Barbara N. Lubash, a partner at Versant Ventures, a health care venture firm in Newport Beach, Calif. ''We're trying to return 10 times our money on a success. The information technology V.C. might be thinking in terms of 100 times.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, the phenomenal returns from venture investments in technology and telecommunications over the last couple of years have dimmed the health care sector's status as a durable long-term holding.</p>
        <p>The latest results of the quarterly PricewaterhouseCoopers Money Tree Survey of venture capital show that health care-related investments in the second quarter of 2000 represented just 2.3 percent of the $19.5 billion of total venture financing, the smallest share recorded for the sector since the firm began collecting health care data in the first quarter of 1997.</p>
        <p>''It's a more complex environment,'' Ms. Lubash said about health care. ''Incumbent companies have a great advantage compared to newcomers.''</p>
        <p>One of Versant Venture's main bets is eHealthContracts, a Hayward, Calif., enterprise that helps doctors, hospitals and insurers negotiate and manage their fee-based service contracts. ''Health care is such a tight-margin business,'' said Helen Wilmot, the chief executive of eHealthContracts.</p>
        <p>''You live and die by your contracts,'' she said.</p>
        <p>One of the company's underlying strengths is its neutrality in dealing with providers (doctors and hospitals) and payers (insurers and employers), Ms. Wilmot said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hill of Schroder Ventures described health care infrastructure companies similarly, as ''selling picks and shovels to the miners,'' a reference to the purveyors who were big winners during another gold rush 150 years ago in California. ''We like those kinds of businesses,'' he said.</p>
        <p>For example, Schroder has invested in Phase Forward, which uses the Web to automate complex clinical trials of both existing and new drugs and medical devices. ''All the pharmaceutical company has to do is get on with the business of running the actual trial, while we do all of the back-office work,'' said Shiv Tasker, the chief executive of Phase Forward in Waltham, Mass. He said that his company can shave at least $50 million and as much as two years off a clinical trial timetable, which can often last seven to nine years, he said.</p>
        <p>Venture capitalists are methodical about how they spend money, but health care investors are especially deliberate because blockbuster successes are rare. Before Capstone Ventures commits to a new health care product or service, Ms. Santry said, she and her partners want to understand a few crucial points, including: can the product be quickly and widely adopted? Are top managers and engineers capable of delivering what they promise? How much money will the company realistically require to succeed?</p>
        <p>''The need for knowledge is on the high end,'' said Ms. Santry, who was once a nurse in the Navy. ''It takes longer to know health care well because it is a fairly complex industry with a lot of government regulation.''</p>
        <p>AND as the health care sector has become less popular, raising money for ventures has become more difficult. Companies that require less capital are more attractive to investors than those with higher demands.</p>
        <p>''Many venture capitalists have eliminated health care or moved away from it,'' Ms. Santry said. Such lack of interest, she noted, suggested that health care could be one of the better investments around. ''Straw hats in the winter,'' Ms. Santry observed.</p>
        <p>Either an off-season bargain, or not much covering from the cold.</p>
