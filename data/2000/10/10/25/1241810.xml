        <p>Carnegie Hall has been swept by a wave of resignations and dismissals as its new executive director prepares to present a strategy that will bring significant change to this 109-year-old landmark institution.</p>
        <p>In an unusual atmosphere of apprehension and resentment, five of the hall's top executives have resigned or been dismissed in the past six weeks, two yesterday. None of those who left would comment on the reasons, but a growing resentment directed at the management style of the executive director, Franz Xaver Ohnesorg, has manifested itself in widespread grumbling among employees, anonymous letters to the news media and ugly graffiti scratched on the inner door of Mr. Ohnesorg's concert box.</p>
        <p>The anxiety ran so high that staff members were informed yesterday that the hall's board had hired an outside consultant to speak with them privately about their concerns and to report back to the trustees.</p>
        <p>The announcement of this hiring came at an extraordinary private meeting with 30 hall employees called by Isaac Stern, the revered violinist who spearheaded the campaign to save Carnegie Hall from the wrecker's ball 40 years ago and who has since served as its president. Mr. Stern, still recovering from heart surgery, traveled from his home in Connecticut to meet with the employees, many of whom he has known for years.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stern helped recruit Mr. Ohnesorg from the Cologne Philharmonie, in Germany, last year and described him in an interview as ''the most gifted man in the world for this kind of work.''</p>
        <p>During the half-hour meeting, two employees said, Mr. Stern pledged his firm support for Mr. Ohnesorg, who was not there, and said, ''You can't change change.''</p>
        <p>They reported that he was aware of the rumors and gossip. He asked for a show of hands of those who  believed that morale was deteriorating. Almost half of those present raised their hands, said the employees, who requested anonymity, citing fear for their jobs.</p>
        <p>In a recent interview Mr. Ohnesorg said that change had to come to Carnegie Hall to broaden its audience and keep it up to date.</p>
        <p>''It is our idea to provide the very best music under the very best-run conditions for a well-informed audience and to celebrate existing music and the new,'' he said. ''That means that we will go through a process of change. Change itself is certainly an art.''</p>
        <p>Asked about employee complaints that he was unusually demanding and autocratic, Mr. Ohnesorg said he had tried to analyze the hall's operations carefully and to make changes with dignity. ''I give them more than 100 percent, and for some it sure might be too demanding,'' Mr. Ohnesorg said of the employees, adding,  ''I am here to make some change.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ohnesorg is poised to present a five-year plan to the trustees. He described it broadly, and it includes proposals to revamp the way performers are booked, to open the hall to more contemporary music and to eliminate part of one of Carnegie Hall's most fabled elements: the network of studios where artists, who in the past included Marlon Brando, Leonard Bernstein and Isadora Duncan, have lived and worked for more than a century.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ohnesorg's efforts come as a $50-million project to convert a basement movie theater into a concert hall is running at least $20 million over budget, by his estimate.</p>
        <p>Although his plan is still a few months from presentation to the Carnegie Hall board, the most striking sign that a shift is under way is that the hall has declined to renew the leases of some longtime tenants of the studios, putting them on a month-to-month status.</p>
        <p>Yesterday Bob Fumo, the hall's longtime director of real estate operations, who ran the studio system and was popular with the tenants, was dismissed.</p>
        <p>The studio enclave, which is in two towers of 12 and 15 floors at the north and south ends of the hall's Renaissance-style building, is sometimes labeled Upper Bohemia for its unconventional citizenry. Al Jolson took his voice lessons there. Isadora Duncan rehearsed dances in Studio 61. Leonard Bernstein lived in Studio 803 while he was an assistant conductor at the New York Philharmonic.</p>
        <p>Jeanne Beauvais, a cabaret singer who directs young performers in the finer points of stage comportment from an apartment cluttered with the flotsam of a 55-year career, recalled hiding away Marlon Brando, the bongo-playing star of ''A Streetcar Named Desire,'' as fans stalked him to his studio on the eighth floor.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ohnesorg said he planned to clear out some studios to make room for administrative offices and a growing educational wing. He said he also wanted to reduce outside bookings in order to assume more control of programming, to expand online marketing and to cash in on the name of Carnegie Hall, through credit card tie-ins or Carnegie Hall books, for example.</p>
        <p>Finally, he also plans to widen contemporary offerings with rap, world music and cutting-edge acts with the downtown feel of locations like the Knitting Factory.</p>
        <p>''We are not only a building,'' said Mr. Ohnesorg, 52, who added that he wasn't interested in renting out the hall like a mere ''garage.''</p>
        <p>An eclectic professional flutist who is equally comfortable playing ''Ave Maria'' on a musical bicycle pump, Mr. Ohnesorg was hired after his predecessor, Judith Aaron, died of breast cancer two years ago.</p>
        <p>Over more than 15 years, through a combination of showmanship and musical risk-taking, he built up the Cologne Philharmonie, making its new hall one of Europe's leading homes for music.</p>
        <p>But his year-old regime here has caused an uproar within Carnegie Hall, which is owned by the City of New York and leased back to the nonprofit Carnegie Hall Corporation.</p>
        <p>On Sept. 28 some employees sent an anonymous letter to news organizations, criticizing Mr. Ohnesorg's stewardship and raising questions about his spending and his approach to the tenants.</p>
        <p>The allegations in the letter were supported by several Carnegie Hall employees who talked to The New York Times but declined to be named, citing fear of reprisals.</p>
        <p>The five departures by top executives, all in the last six weeks, were unprecedented. Those leaving included the director of marketing, the director of public relations, the artistic administrator and the director of hall operations, in addition to the director of real estate operations. This month, Mr. Ohnesorg's executive assistant left, the fourth one to do so.</p>
        <p>Last week swastikas were found scratched in several of the hall's public bathrooms and on the door to the executive box in the main hall, symbols that many employees said were directed at Mr. Ohnesorg, a German citizen. The scratchings were sanded away and reported to the police.  Richard Malenka, Carnegie Hall's associate director of development, declined to reveal any details about the graffiti or the investigation.</p>
        <p>The construction overrun, Mr. Ohnesorg said, was caused by the complex nature of the excavations. James Nomikos, the director of hall operations who managed that project, was forced out abruptly yesterday but will remain on as a construction consultant.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ohnesorg said that he expected expansion to be completed on schedule by 2002 and expressed confidence that the extra money could be raised. He called the expansion and overhaul of operations necessary to make Carnegie Hall more vibrant.</p>
        <p>In interviews in which they requested anonymity, also citing fear of reprisals, several employees complained about what they said was excessive spending, including $65,000 devoted to decorating Mr. Ohnesorg's office, including custom-built furniture. There was also a Carnegie Hall party that took place on the day of Mr. Ohnesorg's birthday in March that several employees said cost between $20,000 to $30,000.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ohnesorg dismissed such complaints, saying that the expenses for his office came in under budget and that the party was not for his birthday, but actually a post-concert dinner for artists who requested the presentation of his birthday cake as a surprise.</p>
        <p>To make room for his new initiatives, like expanded education programs, the staff will have to expand into territory now occupied by some tenants, he said. The turnover is not likely to happen until 2002, with the  expected completion of the basement theater, which will be named the Judy and Arthur Zankel Hall.</p>
        <p>In an atmosphere of anxiety, the studio tenants have traded rumors about the future because Carnegie Hall has not issued a formal notice explaining what is happening to their spaces. It is not clear how many tenants will ultimately be affected, although Mr. Malenka, the associate director of development, said the majority would not be.</p>
        <p>Some tenants, though, are not comforted. Mr. Ohnesorg ''told us that he was taking the sixth, seventh and eighth floors,'' said Frank Williams, an architect who has maintained his offices on the eighth floor for more than 20 years. ''That's a major deal,'' he said. ''The eighth floor has always been the most public floor.''</p>
        <p>On the 13th floor, the nonprofit French-American Conservatory of Music lost its lease for one of its two studios, although it continues to rent the space on a monthly basis.</p>
        <p>Mr. Williams kept detailed minutes of a sometimes tense meeting last August between Mr. Ohnesorg and the eighth-floor tenants in which, he said, the executive director criticized the ''destructive attitude'' of tenants who raised questions. ''When we tried to come up with constructive ideas'' Mr. Williams said, ''he would just say, 'You don't care about Carnegie Hall.' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ohnesorg said he intended to restore the grandeur originally envisioned by Carnegie Hall's first architect, William Burnet Tuthill. ''I am deeply in love with this building,'' he said. Tuthill fought an unsuccessful battle to keep out the studios, which were part of Andrew Carnegie's grand design.</p>
        <p>Mr. Carnegie then fired Tuthill and turned to another architect, Henry J. Hardenburgh, who also designed the Dakota apartment building. But Mr. Ohnesorg noted that Carnegie's intent for the studios was to generate income, not to nurture struggling artists.</p>
        <p>Today the studios contribute about $2 million a year to the Carnegie corporation's most recent budget of almost $40 million; most rents run slightly below market rate, averaging about $30 a square foot.</p>
        <p>''It used to be just like Paris on the Rive Gauche,'' recalled Ms. Beauvais, who arrived at Carnegie Hall in the 1940's with her parents, both painters. ''We were all struggling artists and we would all share everything. Someone would have an audition and we would get together to talk. One person would bring some apples, another a bottle of wine. We would talk about our dreams and hopes. I cry about it because now it's gone.''</p>
        <p>The tenants demonstrated to save the hall from demolition in the late 1950's, and in 1978 they fought a losing battle against rent increases that caused the departure of some residents and an increase in commercial tenants.</p>
        <p>There are also still a number of residents, small schools and acting and vocal coaches, whose students fill the corridors with piano music and sometimes with fierce, dramatic screams. Among them is Shmuel Tatz, a ''body tuner'' or physical therapist for opera singers and other musicians with aching backs or joints.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Stern, who in 1978 supported preserving the studios, said last week that the current tenants were not the type of artists he had in mind in 1978. He said, ''I was thinking of people like Leonard Bernstein,'' describing him as representative of ''artists who have had a part at Carnegie Hall and are in their formative years and needed to be where the action was.''</p>
        <p>''This is a commercial area in which I have no voice and very little interest,'' he continued. ''It has very little to do with artistic enterprise as far as Carnegie is concerned. Mr. Carnegie didn't give a 'woofing pif' about these studios. They were built for the support of the hall.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  October 26, 2000, Thursday  An article yesterday about administrative changes and dissension at Carnegie Hall under its new executive director, Franz Xaver Ohnesorg, misspelled the surname of his predecessor, who died in 1998. She was Judith Arron, not Aaron.</p>
