        <p>With no fanfare and no ceremony, President Clinton signed the bill to provide medical care to thousands of low-income women with breast cancer.</p>
        <p>In a statement issued by the White House press office, Mr. Clinton said, ''I am extremely pleased to sign the Breast and Cervical Cancer Prevention and Treatment Act of 2000, which invests over $990 million over 10 years in an important new health option for thousands of low-income, uninsured women with breast or cervical cancer.''</p>

        <p>With no fanfare and no ceremony, President Clinton signed the bill to provide medical care to thousands of low-income women with breast cancer.</p>
        <p>In a statement issued by the White House press office, Mr. Clinton said, ''I am extremely pleased to sign the Breast and Cervical Cancer Prevention and Treatment Act of 2000, which invests over $990 million over 10 years in an important new health option for thousands of low-income, uninsured women with breast or cervical cancer.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton said that women without health insurance were 40 percent more likely to die from breast cancer than those who were insured.</p>
        <p>The president and Hillary Rodham Clinton have strongly supported the bill for months. But on Monday, White House officials said Mr. Clinton would not hold a public signing ceremony, in part because it would have been awkward to invite Representative Rick A. Lazio, Republican of New York.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio, the sponsor of the original House version of the bill, introduced in March 1999, is running against Hillary Rodham Clinton in the Nov. 7 election for a seat in the United States Senate.</p>
        <p>Elliot J. Diringer, a White House spokesman, said, ''The bill is a major achievement.'' But he said there was no public signing ceremony today because ''this issue was too important to let it get tangled up in the politics of the moment.'' Mr. Diringer said the administration would hold a reception after the election to celebrate enactment of the breast cancer bill and several other health care bills. ''We would intend to invite Mr. Lazio and all the others who have worked hard to pass the legislation,'' the spokesman said.</p>
        <p>Under a 1990 law, low-income women with no health insurance can receive free screenings for breast cancer and cervical cancer. But if cancer is detected, the women often have no way to pay for treatment. The new law authorizes states to provide Medicaid coverage for these women, to help pay for surgery, chemotherapy and other cancer care.</p>
        <p>Advocacy groups had urged the White House to hold a public signing ceremony.</p>
        <p>Ilisa M. Halpern, director of federal government relations at the American Cancer Society, said: ''We are pleased that the president moved quickly to sign the bill. It gets us one step closer to assuring treatment for women screened for breast and cervical cancer.''</p>
