        <p>The parties and the presidential candidates are concentrating their campaigns in Florida in these last, tense days before the election on the cities and towns along Interstate 4.</p>
        <p>The nearly three million voters who live more or less along the maddeningly overcrowded, 100-mile-long highway that bisects the state from Daytona Beach on the Atlantic Coast to the Tampa Bay on the Gulf of Mexico are the swing voters in this, the largest of the swing states.</p>
        <p>They may be getting more attention these days than any other voters in the country as the candidates compete for Florida's 25 electoral votes. Hardly a day goes by when one of the presidential or vice-presidential candidates, or a family member, or a prominent supporter from outside the state is not campaigning somewhere along this narrow corridor.</p>
        <p>''This state is the key to this election,'' Vice President Al Gore declared at a rally in Orlando earlier this month, ''and Central Florida is the key to this state.''</p>
        <p>On Wednesday morning, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, his brother Jeb, the governor of Florida, and Senator John McCain of Arizona are to attend a rally in Daytona Beach, then board a bus to campaign the length of the I-4 corridor, stopping at midday near Orlando to appear on television there, and finishing up with an evening appearance at the state fairgrounds outside Tampa.</p>
        <p>''This is the critical area for Republicans in any statewide election,'' said Representative Charles T. Canady, a Republican from Lakeland, a town along the Interstate about halfway between Orlando and Tampa.</p>
        <p>Much of Florida is already locked up by one party or the other. The Gold Coast, from Miami to Palm Beach, is solidly Democratic. The dominant voters moved down from the Northeast, especially from New York and New Jersey. Many are Jewish, and the politics are decidedly liberal.</p>
        <p>The Cuban vote in South Florida, which is overwhelmingly Republican, and the black vote, largely Democratic, tend to offset each other.</p>
        <p>North Florida, from Jacksonville across the Panhandle to Pensacola, is almost indistinguishable in its politics from Alabama and South Georgia. A recent Democratic poll showed Mr. Bush winning the region by better than 2 to 1, according to Buddy Dyer, Democratic leader of the Florida Senate.</p>
        <p>Southwest Florida, with a large number of affluent retirees from the Middle West, is also strongly Republican.</p>
        <p>In fact, Susan MacManus, a political scientist at the University of South Florida in Tampa, has calculated that in all but 8 of the 67 counties in Florida, one party or the other has an advantage in voter registration of more than 3 percentage points. Of those eight most closely divided counties, she found, five are in the I-4 corridor.</p>
        <p>In 1992, Ross Perot won more than 25 percent of the vote for president in some counties in the area. No one has tabulated who won along the corridor in the last two presidential elections, because there is no consensus on exactly which communities to count and which to exclude. But the best guess, the authorities say, is that President George Bush probably won a narrow plurality in 1992 and that Bill Clinton may have won a majority in 1996.</p>
        <p>Few other places in the country have changed more than this area. A generation ago, the Tampa area was beginning to grow. Daytona Beach was already famous for spring-break frolicking and stock-car races. Slightly south of Daytona, the economic boom and population growth stimulated by the space program at Cape Canaveral had begun.</p>
        <p>But between the coasts, I-4 was a sparsely traveled highway through mile after mile of orange groves, small lakes, pine woods and prairie.</p>
        <p>Then, on Oct. 1, 1971, Disney World opened, and Central Florida was changed forever. The groves became theme parks and hotels. The pine trees with their gray Spanish moss were thinned to accommodate golf courses. The flat prairie land was turned into one subdivision after another.</p>
        <p>And in the last decade, high-technology businesses have sprouted throughout the region, bringing high-paying jobs and conspicuous affluence. The unemployment rate along the corridor is almost nil.</p>
        <p>For the politics of the state, this has meant a great deal of uncertainty. The people who have moved to Central Florida are not primarily retirees, like those in, say, St. Petersburg or Naples, but young families with children. And they mainly brought with them the suburban values of northern sprawl, not the values of the big cities in the East or the small towns of the Middle West.</p>
        <p>The prevailing view among politicians is that these voters, much more than others in Florida, cast votes based on their pocketbooks, not their ideology, and are more concerned about education than Medicare.</p>
        <p>So politicians cannot rely on one-note speeches and advertisements the way they can take stands on Social Security in retirement communities or against gun laws in the Panhandle. They have to articulate their entire range of positions if they expect to appeal to a substantial number of voters along the I-4 corridor.</p>
        <p>''They don't adhere to party labels,'' Bob Poe, the state Democratic chairman, said of residents along the corridor. ''Their vote is completely up for grabs.''</p>
        <p>Al Cardenas, the state Republican Party chairman, agreed with that assessment and said that was the reason the Bush campaign was placing so much emphasis here.</p>
        <p>''In any election in Florida,'' he said, ''if you know who wins the I-4 corridor, you can pretty much predict what the outcome of the election will be.''</p>
