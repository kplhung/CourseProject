        <p>The Subway Series threatened to become an express, a Yankee sweep. But last night, the Mets beat a pitcher who had been unbeatable in the postseason and won a game they had to win.</p>
        <p>The Yankees' Orlando Hernandez struck out 12 batters and pitched out of a bases-loaded jam in the sixth inning, but in the eighth, Benny Agbayani snapped a 2-2 tie with a run-scoring double off El Duque, and the Mets prevailed, 4-2, in Game 3 of the World Series at Shea Stadium. The Yankees lead the series, two games to one, but the Mets could even the four-of-seven-game series tonight at Shea, when their right-hander Bobby J. Jones faces the Yankees' Denny Neagle, a left-hander.</p>
        <p>''It seems like light years difference between 3-0 and 2-1,'' said Mets Manager Bobby Valentine, ''and it's 2-1.''</p>
        <p>The defeat broke the Yankees' 14-game World Series winning streak, the longest such streak in championship play among the major sports, and Hernandez's perfect postseason record was blemished.</p>
        <p>Hernandez had been to baseball what Joe Montana was to the Super Bowl, or what Bill Russell was to the National Basketball Association playoffs. When he pitched, the Yankees won, every time. He had made nine playoff and World Series starts and pitched in relief once, and the Yankees were 10-0 in those games. Hernandez was 8-0 -- the most victories without a loss in postseason history, two games better than Lefty Gomez, who went 6-0 for the Yankees from 1932-1939.</p>
        <p>There was some question among his teammates about Hernandez's condition for Game 3, for he felt poorly Monday. Asked after the Yankees' workout about whether he was sick, El Duque said he felt O.K. as he dropped a towel over a bag of medication that had just been handed to him.</p>
        <p>But the air was warmer than expected at Shea, and Hernandez looked quite comfortable. He and the Mets' Rick Reed, pitchers with superlative control, both took advantage of the large strike zone being called by Jeff Kellogg, the home-plate umpire. Hernandez struck out eight in the first four innings, Reed six in the first two innings.</p>
        <p>Robin Ventura crushed a home run off Hernandez in the second, but David Justice drove home Derek Jeter with a two-out double in the third -- the relay man Edgardo Alfonzo hesitated on the throw for a moment -- and Paul O'Neill tripled to score Tino Martinez in the fourth, giving the Yankees a 2-1 lead.</p>
        <p>The Mets still trailed in the sixth, and Mike Piazza led off for the Mets. Hernandez had thrown sliders to Piazza on the first pitch of his two previous at-bats, and Piazza wound up striking out both times. Hernandez threw another first-pitch slider and Piazza seemed ready, reaching down and smacking a low liner over third base, the ball raising chalk as it struck the baseline before rolling into the corner for a double. Ventura walked. First and second, nobody out.</p>
        <p>Todd Zeile pulled a double into the left-field corner, Piazza jogged around third and across home with the tying run while Ventura rambled into third, Zeile into second. The Mets were in business.</p>
        <p>Agbayani worked a tough base on balls, ignoring a couple of sliders low and away, and the bases were loaded, the noise level in Shea rising. Jay Payton, Mike Bordick and Reed were due to hit.</p>
        <p>Hernandez quickly got ahead in the count against Payton and dispatched him with a slider for a swinging strikeout; one out. He struck out Bordick, whipping a fastball. And he retired the pinch-hitter Darryl Hamilton on a fielder's choice groundout. Hernandez -- almost always stoic when he pitches -- shouted and raised both fists, pumping them once, twice, three times, short jabs as he walked off the mound, staring toward the ground.</p>
        <p>''He took away my aggressiveness and got me out,'' Payton said. ''Then he made some great pitches to Bordick. He's smart, he's got great stuff, and that's why he's so successful.''</p>
        <p>Hernandez breezed through the seventh inning, easily retiring the top of the Mets' order. But his spot in the lineup was coming around in the top of the eighth inning, his pitch count was high, about 120, and Yankees Manager Joe Torre was thinking about replacing him.</p>
        <p>Hernandez pleaded his case, imploring Torre to leave him in the game, and Torre went along with that, holding up one finger: One more inning. One more inning, for a pitcher in whom he has so much trust, who had never done anything but win in the postseason, high pitch counts or not.</p>
        <p>''I was willing to try something else,'' Torre said afterward, referring to his bullpen, ''and he wasn't into that.</p>
        <p>''He deserved the right to get a decision in this game. He was pumped, and with what he has done for us, it was tough for me to deny him what he wanted.''</p>
        <p>Ventura led off the eighth inning and Hernandez struck him out, his 12th of the game, the most ever by a Yankees' pitcher in the World Series, and Torre felt very good about his decision at that point. Zeile, who came into the game with five hits in 12 at-bats and had doubled home a run in the sixth, bounced a single through the middle that just bounced over Jeter's glove. Torre still felt comfortable with Hernandez; to the Yankee manager, Zeile hadn't really hit the ball that hard.</p>
        <p>Agbayani was next. All he had heard about the last two days, he said afterward, was how the Yankees hadn't lost a World Series game in four years, and how Hernandez had been so extraordinary in the postseason.</p>
        <p>With one swing, Agbayani changed all that. Hernandez threw a fastball over the middle and Agbayani tagged it, driving the ball all the way to the wall in left-center, rolling and rolling, Zeile running and running, scoring, the stands at Shea Stadium shaking with emotion. Agbayani looked once at the sky, one very long look. Hernandez stared around the field. He had an unfamiliar feeling in the postseason: he was losing.</p>
        <p>Joe McEwing pinch-ran for Agbayani and, after Payton's infield hit knocked out Hernandez, Bubba Trammell pinch-hit against Mike Stanton and lifted a sacrifice fly, increasing the Mets' lead to 4-2.</p>
        <p>John Franco had pitched the eighth inning, but he stayed in the dugout to watch the ninth, jacket pulled up high. Armando Benitez, who had blown a one-run lead in the ninth inning of Game 1, jogged in from the bullpen. Trouble began immediately for the Mets: Chuck Knoblauch, pinch-hitting, rifled a single to center.</p>
        <p>But Benitez retired Jose Vizcaino on a fly to center, and struck out Jeter on a fastball across the outside corner. Benitez fell behind Justice three balls and one strike, but battled back, and when Justice popped the ball to the right side, Benitez pointed a finger into the air happily, pointing at the pop for all to see.</p>
        <p>The Mets had gone where no team had gone before and conquered El Duque in the postseason. They will know, in the next five days, if they can do the same to the Yankees.</p>
