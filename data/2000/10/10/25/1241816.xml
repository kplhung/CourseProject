        <p>Two office towers totaling 1.5 million square feet will be added to the Harborside Financial Center office complex on the Jersey City waterfront, with Charles Schwab &amp; Company to occupy a fifth of the new space, the developer announced yesterday. The developer, Mack-Cali Realty Corporation, based in Cranford, N.J., held a groundbreaking ceremony for the larger building, a 915,000-square-foot  tower that will rise 33 stories when completed in fall 2002. Schwab has signed a 15-year lease on 300,000 square feet in the smaller building, which will be 19 stories, with 575,000 square feet of space, said Virginia Sobol, a Mack-Cali spokeswoman. The space would house Schwab's newly expanded East Coast headquarters. Construction costs for the two buildings are estimated at $400 million.</p>
