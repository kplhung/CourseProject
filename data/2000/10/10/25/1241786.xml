        <p>When she took over as president and chief executive of PBS last year, Pat Mitchell, formerly an executive at CNN, promised big changes.</p>
        <p>The first attempt at major change came in late spring, when Ms. Mitchell announced an experiment in which PBS would rearrange its prime-time programming schedule in seven major cities.</p>
        <p>Yesterday PBS announced more changes.</p>
        <p>First, in a move Ms. Mitchell said she hoped would draw more teenagers to public television, PBS has picked up ''American High,'' the reality series developed for the Fox network about life at a suburban Chicago high school.</p>
        <p>The program did not do well when it was shown on Fox in the summer. It was watched in just about 2.4 million households during its third and final showing on Aug. 9, which was not nearly a large enough audience to justify its continuation on the network. But that audience was just fine by the standards of PBS, which is, on average, watched in 2 million or so households a night.</p>
        <p>''We wanted a new series that would appeal to teenagers and their parents,'' Ms. Mitchell said. ''We think that's a group that's hard to reach, but public TV ought to try, and we hadn't tried.''</p>
        <p>The program will make its debut on PBS in April, and PBS executives said that two of its half-hour installments would be shown back to back each week. There are 14 new episodes that will be shown, PBS said.</p>
        <p>PBS announced that it would also begin showing a new prime-time hourlong magazine program next fall called ''Life in Bold,'' about extraordinary feats of everyday people in various fields. It is to be produced by ABC's ''Nightline'' and Oregon Public Broadcasting. Michel Martin, the ''Nightline'' correspondent, is to be its host.</p>
        <p>PBS also announced yesterday that it would invite its member stations to produce their own local segments for ''Zoom,'' the popular program for pre-teenagers, starting in 2002.</p>
