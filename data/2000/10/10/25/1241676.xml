        <p>After a decade of stumbling through false starts and failures, Russia seems to be making progress in its hoped-for transition to a market economy. Now a 36-year-old colleague of President Vladimir V. Putin is getting his turn to steer.</p>
        <p>German O. Gref, Mr. Putin's economic development minister since the new administration was elected in March, is under orders to cut taxes, simplify the bureaucracy, and revamp courts and monopolies in hopes of sustaining growth and restoring the faith of skeptical investors.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gref confronts a vast challenge. But he has gained a good deal of respect for aggressively pushing a reform plan that he and a team of Russian policy makers designed. This contrasts with previous programs -- written by Western lenders like the International Monetary Fund to release billions of dollars in loans for financial or budget targets that often went unachieved.</p>
        <p>In an interview, Mr. Gref said that Mr. Putin, who remains popular in Russia, is the force behind the economic program and has given him wide authority to carry it out. And though much of the program requires Parliament's approval, Mr. Gref expressed confidence that he would succeed.</p>
        <p>''The only real medicine for the lack of investor confidence is real action,'' said Mr. Gref, a Russian of German descent, who also heads the Center for Strategic Research, a Moscow-based institute that put together the program of economic change. ''If, through our actions, we can show that we're not just talkers but also implementers of what we say, really protect investors rights, then everyone's relations to our country will change.''</p>
        <p>Many investors fear that these plans will languish and that their property will be as vulnerable to political whim as it has always been. That deep skepticism was reinforced last month at an investor conference here, when participants fired questions at senior government officials about a series of corporate property abuses, a shareholder dilution in the country's leading metals company, and the temporary revocation of previously awarded frequencies to mobile phone companies.</p>
        <p>In another indication of investor disaffection, direct foreign investment in the first half of this year fell 22 percent from the corresponding period last year, despite a rise in overall investment, government figures show.</p>
        <p>Previous programs for structural change under Mr. Putin's predecessor, Boris N. Yeltsin, stalled by the mid-90's after public support waned and many big businesses fell into the hands of a few wealthy Russian entrepreneurs -- people who became known as the oligarchs because of their power and political influence. State ownership was smashed, but little was erected in its place, giving the country a wild capitalism with few rules. The economy became addicted to borrowing on a huge scale, culminating in a currency collapse and a default in the summer of 1998.</p>
        <p>Now, with the economy growing again, Mr. Gref said, the new reform task lies in building an institutional infrastructure for business, like an effective court system and laws governing the behavior of companies and protecting property rights.</p>
        <p>Changes in two of Russia's monopolies -- the national power grid operator Unified Energy Systems and the railroads -- will begin this autumn, Mr. Gref said, while the government will wait to deal with Gazprom until the second half of next year. With Gazprom, a giant that supplies Western Europe with more than 20 percent of its natural gas, the government intends to break out its transport functions and allow all companies equal access to the pipeline that Gazprom now dominates, Mr. Gref said.</p>
        <p>Critics of the gas monopoly, among them foreign investors, have said that the long-entrenched management is taking assets out of the company through subsidiaries, and Mr. Gref hinted that the government is also concerned about this.</p>
        <p>''We now are watching closely all the companies that are connected to Gazprom and the movement of assets,'' he said. ''I can't say there's been a massive moving of assets, but we are getting signals and we are following these carefully.''</p>
        <p>Changes in the courts is another of the government's priorities. Many businesses have little in the way of fair legal recourse in settling disputes, partly because powerful regional politicians easily influence judges. Regional governors give federal judges in their areas perks like housing, cars and monetary bonuses.</p>
        <p>The government's 2001 budget for the first time allots housing funds for judges, who will also be given a modest wage increase, Mr. Gref said. Officials are also working on a computerized database that can retrieve all court decisions and help guard against abuses. Judges will no longer be appointed for life, as now, he said.</p>
        <p>So far, all the proposals for court reform remain on paper. Mr. Putin has yet to approve a broad plan, which will include a package of legislation for passage by the Russian Parliament.</p>
        <p>''We have to break the financial connection between judges and regional authorities,'' Mr. Gref said.</p>
        <p>Another important change, to take effect on Jan. 1, reduces and simplifies Russia's complex import tariffs. The bewildering array of tariffs -- seven categories for every item -- encouraged bribes and hampered efficient business. The seven categories have been thinned to four and the average import tariff rate has been reduced to 20 percent from 30 percent.</p>
        <p>Beyond that, government bureaucracy is to be trimmed, and a commission led by Mr. Gref and Finance Minister Aleksei L. Kudrin has been formed to recommend to Mr. Putin what needs cutting. Despite the vast official ranks, Mr. Gref said, there is still a shortage of professionals to help draw up reforms.</p>
        <p>''Many bureaucrats, for the most part the old ones, are doing what they are used to -- check and give fines,'' he said. ''We need to bring in government influence in places and cut it out altogether in others.''</p>
