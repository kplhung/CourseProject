        <p>IN many ways, Dr. Anne Seger could not be happier. From her home or office, she can key any of her patients into her computer and instantly spy almost every piece of information she needs -- results from a blood test and X-rays, the operating room's report from recent surgery and the patient's next appointment.</p>
        <p>Nurses and doctors on the labor and delivery floor of her hospital, UMass Memorial, can monitor patients' labor from their computer screens. Doctors can plug drug orders into a computer program that will check the drug against a patient's other medications and immediately warn of possible dangers or unexpected interactions. And billing is electronic.</p>
        <p>All this is light-years from where Dr. Seger and her hospital were just five years ago. But it is also far, far from where she and her colleagues in information technology at the hospital want to be. ''We are not there yet,'' said Dr. Seger, an internist who is the medical director of system integration. Neither are most other hospitals.</p>
        <p>There are perhaps few industries that have more to gain from the Internet revolution than medicine. Rapid advancements in biotechnology and medical research, increasingly curious patients who shop the Web for medical information and pressures from managed care companies to contain costs and speed treatments are just the central components driving, in the industry patois, ''e-health.''</p>
        <p>What is more, medicine's most dirty open secret -- the glut of errors that occur in hospitals -- has become a high-profile and politicized issue, and many proponents of information-sharing technologies think that their products can help prevent tragic bedside errors.</p>
        <p>''Hospitals are real laggards'' when it comes to the Internet, said Dr. Russell Ricci, the general manager of global health care industry at I.B.M. ''What e-health has to be used for is to transform the whole process of delivering care. But unfortunately, what most hospitals are doing is trying to go from bricks to clicks, but the system is still based on bricks, which is not going to get us there.''</p>
        <p>Computer types are even more dismayed when they look elsewhere in the notoriously inefficient health care system, particularly at the task of persuading the nation's harried, technology-averse doctors to wire their practices. Stocks of companies like WebMD and Medscape soared last winter, then dropped even faster when the gap between medical and Silicon Valley perspectives became apparent.</p>
        <p>In the case of hospitals, the reasons for the delays are as complex as they are ubiquitous. The first, of course, is money. Hospitals, especially academic medical centers, which enjoyed years of unfettered spending until managed care reared its head a decade ago, are having a difficult time adjusting to the new lean years in medicine.</p>
        <p>Cuts by the government in Medicare and Medicaid spending, combined with constantly declining reimbursements from managed care companies and skyrocketing drug costs, have made it difficult for medical centers to find the budget to expand their information systems as much as they would have liked. Mergers -- a staple activity for major medical centers over the last few years -- have further complicated matters. Hospitals love technology when it means complicated new machines to help diagnose and treat diseases, but they are not always attracted to software that calls for changes in age-old routines.</p>
        <p>As a result, many centers entered the 21st century with the finest surgical talent and equipment in the world, but patients were still giving their social security number to seven different people, who were all scribbling it on paper.</p>
        <p>And as hospitals attempt to evolve, they  are also confronting new federal regulations  on the privacy of medical information, which presents new problems in the electronic world: how can you be in the business of sharing information when, in some cases, that sharing might be illegal?</p>
        <p>Keeping the finest technology minds on staff is also difficult when companies with far deeper pockets are within a few miles of every hospital's front door. UMass loses about four people a month to other companies.</p>
        <p>In addition, those who make and sell e-health products often contribute to the problem, hospital technology executives argue. The dot-com world is unstable, with constant mergers threatening to render many costly systems obsolete. Systems quickly become outdated and are too costly to replace, and many of the most highly promoted items are not as practical as their companies proclaim. ''It really is easy to be seduced by the dot-com of what is coming and what may be,'' Dr. Seger said.</p>
        <p>UNTIL recently, dot-coms enamored of their own software were reluctant to tweak products in ways that doctors wanted. ''It used to be that vendors had the attitude, 'If we don't make it, you don't need it,' '' Dr. Seger said. ''They have gotten a lot better about that, but it has taken time.''</p>
        <p>Some centers saw the revolution coming years ago and built their own systems, literally at home. The most highly recognized is Intermountain Health Care, which runs 22 hospitals in Idaho, Utah and Wyoming. Intermountain has been building its systems internally since the 1960's, long before it could buy the technology in the marketplace. Its highlights include computerized drug monitoring, electronic bedside charts and a robotic pharmacy delivery system, as well as a system in which doctors can enter orders for patient care into a hand-held computer. Right now, these features are available only at Intermountain's flagship LDS Hospital in Salt Lake City, but they are being peppered throughout the system. Rural hospitals already have the capacity to send high-quality images and information to specialists at LDS for consultations, something most big medical centers around the nation lack.</p>
        <p>''We feel that real-time information on patients is absolutely critical,'' said Jess Gomez, a spokesman for LDS Hospital.</p>
        <p>Fine hospitals in the Boston region are like fast-food stands at the mall -- abundant and fiercely competitive. In terms of technology, UMass Memorial -- the product of a 1998 merger between UMass and Memorial Health Care -- is considered one of the more advanced centers among those connected to a medical school. It serves a large and diverse population that includes a heavy dose of patients in Medicare or Medicaid.</p>
        <p>The hospital does not have the fat budget of Massachusetts General in Boston, the envy of Dr. Seger and others in the area. But UMass has invested $40 million in infrastructure over the last five years and expanded its information technology staff to 140 from 20. Many of those people had worked delivering care, Dr. Seger said.</p>
        <p>The center has particularly benefited from the new ability to integrate vast amounts of patient information into a single chart stored online. With X-rays and blood tests and other data centralized, decisions can be made more quickly and confidently.</p>
        <p>Having an entire patient record also allows doctors to walk families through their loved one's entire medical history after a death, right there on one screen, to help them make sense of it all.</p>
        <p>Drugs can now be ordered directly from the pharmacy without going through a  clerk. Ditto for other supplies. All doctors have access to an online library, so research that once took librarians two days to collect can be downloaded much faster. Outside the two campuses, the hospital's 120 off-site doctors are also connected to the system, as is the center's new ambulatory surgical center.</p>
        <p>When patients are admitted to the hospital, they are electronically checked for their insurance type, doctor and history with the center and assigned a bed in one fell swoop. Bills are submitted and paid electronically, and when they are not, insurance companies are nudged electronically, as well. The effect of such efficiencies cannot yet be quantified, but the center expects to save several million dollars a year, much of that coming from a more expedient and accurate payment process.</p>
        <p>These transactions take place almost exclusively on an intranet, a private network that uses Internet technology but is not part of the Web. (The center does not have its own public Web site.) The center does not put any patient information online and will not until the privacy issues become clearer, said Richard F. Bretagne, a vice president and chief information officer at UMass.</p>
        <p>''There are a lot more opportunities to share information going forward,'' he said, adding that the hospital does share information with the state's insurance companies and other health care providers. ''The caveat is that we need the privacy and confidentiality regulations to become clearer and for the encryption details to become clearer,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''That is happening pretty quickly,'' Mr. Bretagne said. The first thing that will be over the Internet will be billing information, he noted.</p>
        <p>More important than any cool gadget or groovy program, Dr. Seger said, was simply preparing the hospital's technological guts for business in the new century. ''Our infrastructure is better than most,'' she said. ''Having guys with their behinds hanging out of the ceiling with a whole bunch of wires is not what people in this business want to talk about. It isn't sexy. But it is very important, and we think we are in good shape.''</p>
        <p>It has not been easy.</p>
        <p>One of the biggest challenges by far, Dr. Seger and others at the center said, was not strictly technical. Hospital mergers tend to result in huge cultural and political conflicts -- which hospital's head of cardiology will get the job at the merged center? Who gets to sit on the new board? When UMass and Memorial joined, each center wanted to keep its own computer system and way of delivering care. In the end, the decision was made to meld the two into a new system, at a cost of $14 million, which left hard feelings on both sides.</p>
        <p>''There were huge turf battles,'' Dr. Seger said. ''Computer systems represent a culture.'' But now the two centers with two campuses could communicate. Technology purchasing became centralized, so departments could no longer buy renegade software that was incompatible with the network.</p>
        <p>Then there were systems that needed tweaking before they were brought online. Why did a certain procedure, for instance, take 13 steps when to an outside observer it could be done in three? Often, the answer was ''just because.'' ''This was a way of pulling back the rug and looking at how you do business,'' Dr. Seger said. ''We don't want to automate bad systems.''</p>
        <p>And at times doctors have resisted change. Some still refuse to put a patient's identification number into the digital dictation system that goes to patient records. They punch in a series of 9's instead, which requires it to be corrected on paper. And even though $60,000 a year has been saved by putting lab reports online, some doctors still protest. Most doctors love the system, Dr. Seger said. ''But there is a bell-shaped curve. Some doctors still think that faxes are a Communist plot.''</p>
        <p>Instability among makers of all things technical has also presented problems. For instance, the center does lab work for the state's prisons and bought a system that connected the two. The company that provided that technology, however, recently went bankrupt -- a story line that has played out with other systems at the hospital. Vendors of e-gadgets often promise more than they can deliver and do not listen to feedback from doctors. ''Frankly, many are more hype than reality,'' Mr. Bretagne said.</p>
        <p>FROM one such vendor's point of view, doctors are not easy customers, although he can see their point. ''For the most part, physicians are fairly risk-averse, and there has been a slow adoption time,'' said Dr. David Grayzel, the chief executive of Catalyst Medical Solutions, which makes a note-writing system for doctors that translates procedures into billing language and makes the notes ready for review in an academic setting. ''Part of why I left academic medicine to go into this was because many products that are developed don't take into consideration physician work flow. You really have to understand how the doctors work on the front line.''</p>
        <p>On the front line at UMass, old tools are still in far too much use, administrators acknowledge.</p>
        <p>A patient's electronic medical record is still not totally complete -- M.R.I.'s, for instance, do not yet mesh with the system, and the hospital is still trying to work with a vendor to make that happen. Bone density tests are not online, nor are electrocardiograms. And as useful as the fetal monitoring system is, the center is waiting for one that allows doctors to monitor a patient's progress from home or an office miles away. In the mundane department, there is no real way to rectify the problem of two patients with the same name. Just the other day, a CAT scan went into the wrong patient's electronic chart. The department that handles the formal, legal, full patient records still keeps them on paper, putting that department in another century.</p>
        <p>Some hospitals are sending images like chest X-rays over the computer, but not UMass -- the hospital's network does not have enough capacity for high-speed transmission. A system that projects diagnostic-quality images has proved too expensive for any place but the emergency room and intensive care unit, even though it would hugely benefit doctors if it were hospitalwide.</p>
        <p>And the center is a long way from a system in which a doctor puts in orders from a hand-held device like a Palm. Such systems are thought to be the most effective way to flag errors in drug dosage, which is a chief cause of medical mistakes. These systems, however, are used by centers with a lot of money.</p>
        <p>''The Institute of Medicine study says that we kill 100,000 people a year with hospital errors,'' said Dr. Ricci of I.B.M. ''Yet most of the hospitals still do not have an electronic point-of-care order-entry system. With it, that number of errors would never happen.  But instead of investing in that, many hospitals are out building new buildings or buying new M.R.I.'s.''</p>
        <p>Executives at UMass say they are not spending unwisely. They simply have no more money, they argue. The hospital no longer receives state financing under the merger. ''We lose money on every admission,'' said Dr. Seger, who figures the hospital will not be able to buy new products this year, upgrading what they have instead. It cannot afford Windows 2000.</p>
        <p>On Mr. Bretagne's wish list is a system that would collect billing information into a marketing analysis and forecasting system; more online clinical information that can complete a true patient record; and a way to look at ultrasounds and other images from anywhere so that specialists can consult over the phone with community hospitals and one another. Oh, and products that live up to their sales pitches. The way some imaging systems are sold, he said, ''People think they are on AOL at home and want to see a patient's radiology image, and they will click and there it will be. In reality, these are very dense, and we tell people if you want that image, click on it and go make a cup of coffee.''</p>
        <p>His all-time favorite technological product: e-mail.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ricci of I.B.M. can barely hide his disgust with most of this -- it is as if he were living on the Starship Enterprise and he just landed on a strange little planet where the natives etch prescriptions on stones and use leeches to rid themselves of disease.</p>
        <p>His vision of e-health goes far beyond the patchwork of in-house systems UMass is cobbling together. In fact, he wants e-health to take care almost completely out of the hospital.</p>
        <p>Medical devices that use the Internet to connect home and doctor open vast new possibilities for improving care and lowering costs, he said. For instance, ''A bathroom scale is a medical device,'' he said. ''If someone has congestive heart failure and we give them a bathroom scale with a modem, it would decrease costs. They go to a party, gain two pounds because they're retaining fluid, and that scale calls to my case managers, locks the fridge, says order a diuretic. The bathroom scale is a pervasive computing device that decreases admissions, but if congestive heart failure is my biggest profit center, that could have a huge negative impact.''</p>
        <p>He added: ''A hospital of the 21st century is an I.C.U. and an organization whose unit is knowledge and expertise, not necessarily health care delivery.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Seger said that her center did have a pilot program to use patient home devices that operate much like a bathroom scale. More such tests are ''absolutely'' coming, she said, even if she does not envision hospitals disappearing the way Dr. Ricci wants.</p>
        <p>''Quality medicine is in prevention for sure,'' she added. ''But saying that we don't want home devices is like saying we want more people to smoke so we can have more lung cancer patients. The issue is financial and human resources, and that is a never-ending struggle.''</p>
