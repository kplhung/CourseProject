        <p>LAST year, when Oliver Schwarz and his partner, Bertram Hesse, founded their Internet software start-up in Berlin,  they needed a name for the company.

        <p>LAST year, when Oliver Schwarz and his partner, Bertram Hesse, founded their Internet software start-up in Berlin,  they needed a name for the company. Mr. Schwarz and Mr. Hesse, both from the East German town of Jena, brainstormed with their core team -- most of whom were also originally from the former East Germany -- and found themselves rejecting cyber-sounding names like ''SiteSprint,'' one of their earlier choices, in favor of terms from the Communist era.</p>
        <p>They settled on Subotnic. It's from ''Subbotnik,'' which means ''working on Saturday for free,'' explained Mr. Schwarz, who left East Germany, which was formally known as the German Democratic Republic, for political reasons in the early 1980's. ''Subbotnik was a Russian term used by the G.D.R. to get people to work on Saturdays 'for the freedom of the Socialist revolution,' or something like that.'' Part inside joke about the nature of a start-up, which generally entails working Saturdays, and part ironic reinterpretation of a Socialist term for the Internet age, the name Subotnic is also a play on the computer terms ''SU''  (super user); ''bot'' (shopping bot); and ''NIC'' (Network Information Center). ''Everybody from the East gets it,'' Mr. Schwarz said, grinning.</p>
        <p>Subotnic, which developed a proprietary system for managing content on the Internet, did not keep its name for long: in August, Intershop A.G., a successful East German Internet software start-up, bought Subotnic. But Subotnic, now Intershop Berlin, did keep its East German edge. Founded in 1995 in Jena, Intershop is (also not without irony) named after Intershops, which were stores in the former East Germany that sold high-quality goods to Western visitors or privileged East Germans for West German marks.</p>
        <p>The sale of their start-up secures a spot for Mr. Schwarz and Mr. Hesse in the ranks of former East German high-technology entrepreneurial success stories -- a category essentially created by Intershop's founder, Stephan Schambach. Mr. Schwarz said he met Mr. Schambach in the mid-90's through Mr. Hesse's connections in Jena's technology community. ''We have similar roots,'' said Mr. Schwarz about the two companies. ''We have matching cultures, so we felt very good about selling our company to Intershop at such an early stage.''</p>
        <p>According to Soren Schuster, an investment manager in the Leipzig office of 3i Germany, a division of 3i, the venture capital firm based in London, the former East Germany -- with its tradition of quality technical higher education, its dearth of competitive old-economy industry, and new role models like Mr. Schambach of Intershop -- will see more and more high-tech start-ups in the future. Earlier this year,</p>
        <p>3i Germany acquired Technologieholding, the venture capital firm that funded Intershop in 1996; Technologieholding also funded Subotnic in 1999.</p>
        <p>Entrepreneurship is a recent phenomenon in Germany, which has a history of large, corporate business structures in the West and socialism in the East. Mr. Schuster of 3i Germany said that high-tech business people from former East Germany have certain advantages over their West German counterparts when it comes to adopting entrepreneurial attitudes. But while former East Germans typically have had less ready cash to seed their companies and a smaller professional network than the West Germans, Mr. Schuster said, coming from East Germany is an opportunity, too. ''The Intershop guys didn't know too much about the Western world when they started, but that meant that, unlike many West Germans, they weren't blinded by the ways of the old economy.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Schwarz also attributes his high-tech success in part to his East German roots: people who grew up in a very secure situation in the West often want to wait for perfect professional situations before they act. He observed, ''In the new economy, you can't wait for the perfect situation -- you need to deal with improvised situations and make decisions that aren't perfect. That's certainly something I've had experience with in my own history.''</p>
        <p>Now 35, Mr. Schwarz said that when he was a teenager in Jena in the early 80's, he was part of a group of dissident artists. At age 18, angered by the government's restrictive policies toward artistic expression,  he said that he wrote a letter of protest to Erich Honecker, the former president of East Germany. As a result, Mr. Schwarz said, the Stasi (the East German secret police) ransacked his apartment and, finding his handwritten draft, arrested him. Mr. Schwarz said he was sent to prison for two years together with his girlfriend at the time and a dozen other artists who had signed the letter. Of his time in prison, he said, ''It was hard, but you work and you sleep. At first it was all criminals, but then there were more and more political prisoners, so we made our own group.''</p>
        <p>While Mr. Schwarz was in jail, dissident friends who had already left East Germany for the West publicized his group's arrest and lobbied the West German government for their release. After six months of political negotiations between the two countries, Mr. Schwarz and his girlfriend were freed and moved to West Berlin; his friends were also released.</p>
        <p>In West Berlin, Mr. Schwarz studied art, art history and media design -- subjects that he had been prohibited from studying in Jena, and that would provide a segue into multimedia art and, then, Internet business. In 1988, he received a grant to go to California Institute of the Arts, near Los Angeles. There, he spent a year working in an Apple computer lab and learned English. He happened to be in Berlin for a visit when the wall fell and decided to stay in Germany instead of going back to Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>After finishing his degree in media studies and design in Germany, Mr. Schwarz worked in Berlin as a multimedia artist and curator. In 1997 he founded a Web consultancy with Mr. Hesse. For a meeting with their first potential client, the two asked their friends to come to their office (in Mr. Schwarz's apartment) and to bring their laptops. ''They all sat down with their laptops, like they were working. We wanted it to look like we were already big, like we were already 20 people,'' Mr. Schwarz said. ''I guess it worked -- we got the client.''</p>
        <p>While working as Web consultants, Mr. Schwarz and Mr. Hesse came up with the Web content management system that was later the basis for Subotnic.</p>
        <p>''Things are always happening in your life,'' Mr. Schwarz added. ''You just have to be aware of the opportunities.''</p>
