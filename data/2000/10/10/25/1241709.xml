        <p>THERE are two issues I want to discuss about the CNN Airport Network, the service that has been pumping television news and feature programming into airport departure lounges since 1992, when airports began clamoring for it in the aftermath of the Persian Gulf war.</p>
        <p>The first is that it's growing. Having saturated the United States market, where the customized airport programming is now piped into 1,600  gates and other public areas at 35 of the busiest domestic airports, CNN is  planning to expand the service to foreign airports. Tomorrow, CNN Airport Network will officially begin programming at Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam, where it has been installed at more than 80 viewing areas.</p>

        <p>THERE are two issues I want to discuss about the CNN Airport Network, the service that has been pumping television news and feature programming into airport departure lounges since 1992, when airports began clamoring for it in the aftermath of the Persian Gulf war.</p>
        <p>The first is that it's growing. Having saturated the United States market, where the customized airport programming is now piped into 1,600  gates and other public areas at 35 of the busiest domestic airports, CNN is  planning to expand the service to foreign airports. Tomorrow, CNN Airport Network will officially begin programming at Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam, where it has been installed at more than 80 viewing areas.</p>
        <p>The second issue, which we will return to, is that CNN is aware that some of us don't want to be forcibly subjected to a braying television set as we wait in an airport lounge for however many hours of torture the  airlines are already subjecting us to. To that end, CNN, a unit of Time Warner, says it has been working on its technology to ensure that there are areas in every gate where it's possible to get away from television.</p>
        <p>But first, the expansion. The CNN Airport Network, which started out as a 30-minute news loop that repeated constantly during the day, now features a day-long selection of news, weather and features chosen from the regular CNN cable services.</p>
        <p>Business travelers, who spend the most time in airports, are the major  market for advertisers. In fact, CNN's decision to go international is a reflection of the sustained growth in global business travel, said Deborah L. Cooper, the senior vice president of Turner Private Networks, which runs the airport network.</p>
        <p>At first, the programming will remain exclusively in English.</p>
        <p>''The nice thing about launching this in the Netherlands is that the great majority of people there speak English,'' said Ms. Cooper. But she said the Amsterdam expansion, which CNN is undertaking in partnership with Royal Philips Electronics, which installed and will operate the audio and visual hardware, is a prototype for a planned multilingual rollout of CNN Airport Network throughout Europe and possibly in Latin America and elsewhere.</p>
        <p>Frankfurt will be next, starting early next year. There, the network, in partnership with a German news channel, will program a mix of news and other features in both German and English, she said. At airports in Spain, where the service will be offered sometime later, ''we think we may wind up being upwards of 80 percent in Spanish,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Long-term, said Ms. Cooper, ''we really want to partner with media  companies so that we can program in their native languages.''</p>
        <p>The CNN Airport network, Ms. Cooper said, got its start from the high demand for CNN news during the gulf war in 1991, ''when passengers were stuck in airport terminals during an international crisis'' and began clamoring for access to CNN's live coverage of a war that had everyone glued to television.</p>
        <p>Initially, when airports began adding the service after the war, passengers complained mostly about its ''redundancy,'' as growing numbers of passengers cooling their heels for longer than 30 minutes tired of seeing the same news repeated over and over, she said.</p>
        <p>''So we went from a half-hour wheel to an hour wheel,'' Ms. Cooper said. ''And lo and behold, the next year we had to go to a two-hour wheel. Then after that, we found that we really needed to simulcast -- that is, take the best of all of the CNN services'' and run them constantly.</p>
        <p>Which brings us to the other issue -- that is, those airline passengers  stuck for increasing periods of time in departure lounges who consider being involuntarily subjected to a television set annoying at best, and  pestilential at worst.</p>
        <p>Ms. Cooper says that she hears you. In fact, she is sometimes among you. In airports, ''there are times when I just want to read, or just zone  out,'' without having to listen to a television, she said.</p>
        <p>''We understand that in order for us to be successful, it has to be a discretionary viewing situation. It is not something that should be forced  down somebody's throat,'' she said. ''We work with the airlines to determine which gates we should go into. We stagger the gates.''</p>
        <p>She said CNN deliberately placed its television sets in waiting areas to  ensure that only part of the area is the ''viewing'' section. Another part, she said, is called the ''enticement zone,'' meaning waiting passengers can see the television set and keep an eye on it to decide if they want to move within hearing range. And another section is the ''quiet zone,'' she said, where the television should be neither seen -- nor heard.</p>
        <p>''One of the things we really believe we've pioneered is audio technology in public places,'' she said, because of early complaints about  television programming from people who'd rather not be subjected to it.</p>
        <p>''But now we've got sensing microphones throughout the ceilings that pick up the ambient noise levels,'' she said. ''And our audio systems track that and raise or diminish the audio levels to nine decibels above background noise, and also lowers the audio during airport-wide or airline paging,'' she said.</p>
        <p>So you don't miss that announcement of your delayed flight.</p>
