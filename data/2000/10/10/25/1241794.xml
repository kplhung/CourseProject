        <p>No one goes to work in a clothes-hanger factory to have fun or make a lot of money. The 275-odd employees of the plant that Tyco International acquired here in 1996 earn $5.75 to $9.55 an hour to churn out plastic hangers. In each 8-hour shift, just two 15-minute rest periods, plus a 5-minute ''water break'' are allowed. No lunch. Every other week, they are required to work an extra Saturday.</p>
        <p>''The reason people came here was the benefits were good,'' said Jody Geist, a 13-year veteran who makes $8.93 an hour. ''The work was bad. The money wasn't good. But we have a good health insurance plan. And now, that's what they want to take away.''</p>
        <p>The hanger-makers of tiny Ringtown, tucked away in the mountain fastness of central Pennsylvania, are among the dwindling ranks of Americans who still enjoy traditional indemnity health insurance. For a $7.50-a-week premium, all their ''ordinary and reasonable'' medical bills are paid, and they can go to any doctor they want.</p>
        <p>But now, Tyco is leaning on them to give that up and approve a managed care plan that it says could save the unit, A &amp; E Products, $500,000 a year. That might not be a large sum for a Wall Street powerhouse that has bought more than 200 companies in the last eight years and that today announced operating earnings of $1.1 billion on revenue of $7.8 billion. [Page C4.]</p>
        <p>But Tyco's specialty is whipping creaky, old-economy manufacturing companies into shape for the global era, often doubling the profit margins of acquisitions in the first year. And bringing labor costs under control is a key element of that strategy.</p>
        <p>The use of managed health care to rein in labor costs is not new. Across the country, nine out of 10 Americans who receive health coverage at work are now enrolled in some form of managed care, and the proportion with indemnity plans has fallen by more than half, according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute in Washington.</p>
        <p>But to the workers at this faded crossroads deep in Pennsylvania coal country, who are represented by a union in Philadelphia that their own shop steward criticizes as ineffectual, Tyco's methods come across as particularly heavy-handed. In essence, the company has told them that they must either accept managed care or undergo mass layoffs.</p>
        <p>Unless they change their health coverage, they have been told, only 60 of them will still have jobs by December. The plant might even close.</p>
        <p>''I wasn't expecting these people to be so mean and cold,'' said Dianne Mourer, a 28-year employee who saw four other managements come and go before Tyco took over. Like other employees, she fears that managed care will make it hard to obtain affordable health care at all, because network doctors can be scarce in these remote hills and hollows.</p>
        <p>A Tyco spokeswoman said she could understand that the hanger-makers might feel pressured. ''But there is pressure on the company, too, just from the dynamics of the industry we operate in,'' said the spokeswoman, Judith Czelusniak, who was willing only to discuss the situation in broad terms, citing the unsettled labor dispute.</p>
        <p>The company's problems elicit little sympathy from Ms. Mourer, however. To make ends meet, she works 12-hour shifts several days each week, making $9.55 an hour, plus overtime, loading hangers onto shipping pallets.</p>
        <p>''Being that it's a big corporation, I was expecting that we'd have to pay a little more on our insurance,'' she said. ''But I was also expecting a little more on our paychecks.''</p>
        <p>Few shoppers may pause to consider the hangers on the racks of any Gap or Kmart, but those billions of clacking bits of plastic constitute a half-billion dollar business. And through shrewd acquisitions, Tyco has nearly cornered it; retail executives estimate that it commands sales of more than $400 million, or 70 percent to 80 percent of the market.</p>
        <p>It was the quest for hanger dominance that brought Tyco to Ringtown. Immigrant labor here once produced coal mining fortunes for the financiers of New York and Philadelphia, but the market for anthracite collapsed after World War II, leaving a landscape of plunging green hills punctuated with ugly abandoned slag heaps.</p>
        <p>When mining departed, local officials courted new industry, and secured some of the garment shops that were fleeing high-wage New England and New York. They also landed the hanger factory.</p>
        <p>Tyco, which is registered in Bermuda, but has headquarters in Exeter, N.H., made a good first impression on the locals when it bought the factory's parent four years ago. Ms. Mourer notes that a year after that, the company made the Friday after Thanksgiving a paid holiday.</p>
        <p>But things took a less benevolent turn in May, when Tyco sent a lawyer and two corporate officials to begin negotiating a new contract to replace the current one, which expires in December. ''They told us the very first meeting, 'If it doesn't go the Tyco way, we're shutting down,' '' recalled Ms. Mourer, one of five plant workers serving on the negotiating committee. Union officials from Philadelphia were also there, as were the plant manager and an aide. ''It wasn't a negotiation at all,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Czelusniak, the Tyco spokeswoman, said keeping labor costs down was a fitting way to save the company's hanger-manufacturing jobs in the United States. The American garment industry has been moving offshore, she noted, and cost-conscious American retailers have increasingly demanded that overseas makers put the clothes on the the hangers themselves.</p>
        <p>In any case, Tyco has been stepping up the pressure since the May meeting. In August, it filed a 60-day notification of mass layoffs in Ringtown, as required by a federal plant-closing law. In mid-October, with the 60-day clock ticking down, it inserted ''Dear Employee'' letters in employees' pay envelopes, announcing that the contract negotiations had failed and that it had no choice but to make its ''final offer.''</p>
        <p>This consisted of its managed care insurance plan and raises of 60 cents an hour in the first year of a new three-year contract, and 25 cents an hour in each of the next two years. ''That is a great deal of money,'' the letter stated.</p>
        <p>The workers did have the option of keeping their existing insurance, but with an increase in their premium that would cancel out all but 3 cents of the overall $1.10 raise.</p>
        <p>The letter said the mass layoffs would be rescinded if employees approved the offer but would begin this week if they rejected it.</p>
        <p>Labor lawyers in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania's capital, questioned the propriety of timing a mass-layoff notification to coincide with a contract vote. The federal law is supposed to help workers deal with layoffs by giving them time to find new jobs or negotiate sweeter severance deals, they said, not intimidate them.</p>
        <p>''This sounds like it's being used to scare people,'' said Irwin Aronson, counsel to the Pennsylvania A.F.L.-C.I.O. in Harrisburg. ''There's a certain category of employer that feels it's appropriate to use the statutes enacted as a shield to protect the workers as a sword against them.''</p>
        <p>The company declined to respond.</p>
        <p>If that was the intent, it didn't work. Last week, the hanger-makers rejected the proposal.</p>
        <p>Within days, a new ''Dear Employee'' letter went out. It said the vote would be held all over again.</p>
        <p>''There shouldn't be another vote,'' said Ms. Geist, who also serves as a local shop steward. ''When a contract gets voted down, it gets voted down. Then you go and negotiate it again. You don't just throw the same contract back at the people for another vote.''</p>
        <p>The company said a new vote was appropriate because only about half of the work force turned out for the first one. Ms. Geist said that was because a higher proportion of the workers were Mexicans of questionable legal status and didn't want to do anything that would call attention to themselves, including voting.</p>
        <p>Indignant, she called the union that represents the workers, a division of Seafarers International, and told an official, Rob Wisler, that she wanted him to file a complaint to the National Labor Relations Board.</p>
        <p>''He said, 'It's good to have the vote and get it over with,' '' Ms. Geist recalled. ''I said, 'Well, it's good for you guys because you don't have to live here and work here.' '' She tried circulating a petition against the second vote, but Mr. Wisler told her to stop, she said. He could not be reached for comment.</p>
        <p>Now Ms. Geist is wondering why she paid her union dues of $14 a month all those years. ''They're just hanging us out to dry,'' she said. ''I don't know, really, where to turn.''</p>
        <p>A spokesman at Seafarers International in Camp Springs, Md., said the union had done all it could against a profitable company bent on wringing concessions out of its workforce.</p>
        <p>''We showed up at all the meetings. We bargained in good faith. I don't see any lack of representation,'' said the spokesman, who asked not be identified because he had not been at the bargaining table himself.</p>
        <p>Last Friday, the hanger-makers voted a second time. Again, they rejected Tyco's ''final offer.'' Now they are waiting for their layoff slips.</p>
        <p>Despite the clear majority against the new contract, a few dissenting employees blame Ms. Geist, saying that if there are mass layoffs, it will be her fault.</p>
        <p>Meantime, some workers have applied for jobs at other companies that have moved into the region, including big processing and distribution centers for companies like Wal-Mart and Kmart. The hanger-makers say these places pay a little more but do not offer what they really want: traditional health insurance.</p>
