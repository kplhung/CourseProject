        <p>A16-25</p>
        <p>G.O.P. Averts Standoff Over Family Planning Limits  Congressional Republicans agreed to remove restrictions -- on Feb. 15, 2001 -- that bar private family planning groups that get federal funds from spending any money to provide abortions or promote abortion rights in other countries. The move is both a gamble that Gov. George W. Bush will win the presidency and reverse much of what Congress just did and an effort to avoid a high-profile pre-election confrontation with President Clinton, who promised a veto if the restrictions remained.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>Effort to Counter Nader Effect  The Democratic Party and its allies in the labor, environmental and women's movements, concerned that Ralph Nader has become a major threat to Vice President Al Gore's ability to win the presidency, are mounting aggressive campaigns in swing states to dissuade liberal voters from supporting Mr. Nader, the Green Party candidate.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>Texas Test Scores Challenged  A RAND Corporation study questioned the validity of rising student test scores in Texas. Aides to Gov. George W. Bush sought to discredit the findings; the Gore campaign and its supporters seized on them to attack Governor Bush on his signature issue, education.</p>
        <p>A23</p>
        <p>Doctor Declares Gore Fit  Vice President Al Gore is in excellent health and has not taken a sick day in the last eight years, Mr. Gore and his doctor said in their first full interviews about Mr. Gore's health. The Bush campaign said Gov. George W. Bush would allow his doctor to be interviewed, but the governor himself has so far declined to be interviewed.</p>

        <p>Rise in Emergency Room Use  Visits to emergency rooms grew about 3 percent a year from 1997 to 1999 and rose 6 to 8 percent in the last year, despite expectations that the expansion of managed care would curtail emergency room visits.</p>

        <p>Court Finds No Favoritism In Welfare Contracts  A five-justice appellate panel of the state Supreme Court ruled that Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi overstepped his authority in March, when he rejected $104 million worth of city welfare-to-work contracts after raising what the court called unfounded allegations of corruption.</p>

        <p>Cheap-Labor Settlement  Nearly 200 men and women who were homeless when they took menial dollar-an-hour jobs in the 1990's with two Midtown business improvement districts will receive awards totaling $816,000 tonight, the result of a settlement of a suit over wages.</p>
