        <p>THERE'S a formula to chowder. Its flavor often comes from bacon or salt pork and onions, its texture from potatoes and its personality from the seafood that is used. On that last ingredient, Jasper White is well versed.</p>
        <p>Mr. White, who owns Jasper White's Summer Shack, a casual fish house in Cambridge, Mass., grew up on the Jersey Shore but has spent most of his career as a chef in Boston. By now there may be chowder in his veins (creamy New England, not tomato-based Manhattan).</p>
        <p>In his new book, ''50 Chowders: One-Pot Meals -- Clam, Corn and Beyond'' (Scribner, $30), Mr. White's expertise shows up in excellent recipes like one for a chowder made with salmon and peas, another done Portuguese-style with sausage and tomatoes, and an intriguing chowder from Maine layered in a pot with crackers.</p>
        <p>Various kinds of clams find their way into his chowders, including quahogs, steamers, razor clams and even the giant geoduck of the Pacific Northwest. Other shellfish chowders are made with mussels, oysters, crab, shrimp and lobster.</p>
        <p>A key to cooking chowder, he tells us, is allowing it to rest, or ''cure'' as they say in New England, once all the ingredients are cooked, so that the flavors can meld. (The principle is the same with other soups.)</p>
        <p>After trying some recipes, it is easy to understand how to create your own chowder, using ingredients of your choice plus a well-flavored stock and maybe some cream or tomatoes. A few color pictures show how chunky a chowder should look.</p>
        <p>(In a chapter preface, John Thorne, author of ''Down East Chowder,'' tells the difference between a chowder and a stew: ''A chowder represents the special preparation of some very ordinary ingredients, while a stew represents an ordinary preparation of some very special ingredients.'')</p>
        <p>The book offers several vegetable chowders and also goes far afield with chicken, veal and even bacon and eggs as bases. And if you would like a new idea for leftover Thanksgiving turkey, Mr. White gives a chowder for that, too.</p>
        <p>Mr. White tries to track the origin of the term ''chowder,'' which some say is French (from ''chaudiere'' or ''chaudron,'' which mean cauldron) and others insist comes from Cornwall, England, where in the 1700's the word ''jowter'' meant fishmonger. The dish itself is thought to have been brought to New England in the early 1700's by French settlers from Canada, or English settlers in Massachusetts, or even American Indians.</p>
        <p>Mr. White's insistence that American chowder making started in New England is reinforced by his suggestions (and recipes) for accompaniments. Along with fritters, corn bread and biscuits, the emphasis is on New England items like parkerhouse rolls and a colonial whole grain loaf called anadama bread. He gives directions for buttering and warming hard white common crackers, the sine qua non of chowder companions. Fortunately, he also gives a mail-order source for this regional specialty: the Vermont Country Store, (802) 775-4111.</p>
        <p>SOUTH COAST PORTUGUESE FISH CHOWDER  Adapted from ''50 Chowders: One-Pot Meals -- Clam, Corn and Beyond'' by Jasper White  Time: 1 hour, plus resting and reheating</p>
        <p>2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil  2 bay leaves  1 tablespoon finely chopped garlic  2 medium onions (14 ounces), cut in  3/4-inch dice  1 medium green bell pepper, seeded and cut in  1/2-inch dice</p>
        <p>1/4 teaspoon ground allspice  2 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and sliced  1/3-inch thick  4 cups well-flavored fish or chicken stock  2 cups canned whole tomatoes with juice, in  1/2-inch dice  6 ounces spicy chorizo or andouille sausage, casing removed and sliced  1/4-inch thick  Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper  2 pounds skinless silver hake, cod, haddock or bass fillets, pin bones removed</p>
        <p>1/4 cup finely chopped cilantro leaves and tender stems  2 tablespoons coarsely chopped flat-leaf parsley.</p>
        <p>1. Heat a heavy 4- to 6-quart pot over medium heat. Add olive oil and bay leaves. When bay leaves turn brown, add garlic and cook, stirring with wooden spoon, until golden. Add onions, green pepper and allspice and saute, stirring occasionally, about 8 minutes, until onions are soft but not brown.</p>
        <p>2. Add potatoes and stock. Stock should just cover potatoes. Add a little water if needed. Increase heat, cover and boil potatoes 10 minutes, until not quite tender.</p>
        <p>3. Reduce heat to medium, add tomatoes and sausage and simmer 5 minutes. Season generously with salt and pepper; use enough so you will not have to stir in more once fish is added.</p>
        <p>4. Add whole fish fillets, cook 5 minutes and remove from heat. Gently stir in cilantro and allow chowder to sit 10 minutes. Allow chowder to sit at room temperature 1 hour before serving, or cool briefly, then refrigerate up to 2 days, covering chowder after it is cold.</p>
        <p>5. To serve, reheat chowder over low heat. Do not let it boil. Use slotted spoon to mound chunks of fish with sausage and vegetables in soup plates. Spoon tomato broth over and sprinkle with parsley.</p>
        <p>Yield: 8 main-course servings.</p>
