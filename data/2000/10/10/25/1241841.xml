        <p>Orlando Hernandez decided earlier this season that it made more sense to say absolutely nothing to the reporters who cover the team. Rather than reveal his true feelings, Hernandez offers brief and colorless comments about himself, his pitching and his team. That is too bad, because he is a fabulous story.</p>
        <p>Hernandez still talks openly to some of his Spanish-speaking teammates and he told Luis Sojo last month that he was not worried about how he had pitched in the regular season. The playoffs are my time, El Duque told Sojo.</p>
        <p>El Duque is an extraordinary pitcher who gets even nastier when the games are most important. He exhibited that last night as he pitched solidly into the eighth inning while striking out 12, pushing himself as his pitch count soared.The playoffs are his time.</p>
        <p>Except last night. The Mets rallied against one of the elite pitchers in postseason history to beat the Yankees, 4-2, in Game 3 of the World Series and give themselves a pulse. If the Mets had lost, their season basically would have been over; no major league team has come back from a 3-0 deficit in a four-of-seven-game series. It was the first time that El Duque had lost in the postseason after eight victories. We have a World Series again. The mighty El Duque pitched wondrously. And lost.</p>
        <p>''Twelve strikeouts,'' Hernandez said. ''It's not important. What's important is that I couldn't get Agbayani out. That's more important than 12 strikeouts.''</p>
        <p>Wearing a long-sleeve black shirt and with his cap tugged down over those mysterious eyes, Hernandez took the mound at Shea Stadium with a cold. But that did not matter to El Duque. Someone heard a foolish rumor that the Yankees might replace Hernandez with Denny Neagle last night because El Duque was ill, but the Yankees squashed that notion before the game and El Duque squashed it all night.</p>
        <p>''If he's not feeling well,'' Manager Joe Torre said, laughing, ''I'm going to have everybody catch what he has.''</p>
        <p>Legacies are formed on what Hernandez did in the sixth inning last night.The Mets tied the score, 2-2, on Todd Zeile's run-scoring double and loaded the bases with no outs. It was the first time in the Series that the Mets might have felt  they were taking control.</p>
        <p>That is when El Duque went to work to save himself. He struck out Jay Payton on four pitches. He struck out Mike Bordick with a 3-2 slider and he got the pinch-hitter Darryl Hamilton to ground out. The Mets had a chance to slay El Duque and they could not score the third run.After Hernandez retired Hamilton, he patted his right hand against his thigh. El Duque was doing it again.</p>
        <p>''It was typical El Duque,'' Torre said. ''He's up on that high wire all the time. You don't think he's going to be able to get down from there. He has good stuff, but his determination is really tough. He's really special when it comes to big games.''</p>
        <p>The seventh inning was a blur. Hernandez blew past the Mets on nine pitches and El Duque's legacy seemed to be growing. He does not lose in the postseason. He will not lose in the postseason. The Mets were trying to avoid falling into an insurmountable 3-0 hole in the Series and they were trying to do it against the pitcher whose Octobers had been unblemished. With the pitch count mounting, Torre considered removing Hernandez after the seventh, but El Duque was animated about pitching the eighth and Torre agreed to give him another inning. He had to trust El Duque. If there is anyone to trust in October, it is Hernandez.</p>
        <p>''I was going to make a change, but he felt really good,'' Torre said. ''It was tough to deny him. With his track record, it was tough to make a change. He wasn't wishy-washy about it.''</p>
        <p>After initially denying that he had convinced Torre to let him remain in the game, Hernandez, who threw 134 pitches, said: ''I'm never going to agree to be taken out of a game. Would you agree to have your job taken?''</p>
        <p>As for the pitch count, Hernandez  said, ''The number of pitches you make is not important; it's how you feel.''</p>
        <p>When Hernandez started the eighth by striking out Robin Ventura, who had homered and doubled off him, Torre figured that he had made the right call and that this was vintage El Duque. But Zeile grounded a single to left and Benny Agbayani followed by lashing his double to left-center. The mighty El Duque had been tarnished.</p>
        <p>''El Duque is pretty special,'' Torre said. ''What he has done for us over the last few years, it's tough to deny that.''</p>
        <p>Except last night. The Mets denied Hernandez and the Yankees and made the Series interesting again. Hernandez  offered his usual clipped responses after the game, revealing little about what he was feeling after finally losing. The postseason was supposed to be his time, but the Mets changed that last night. Torre made the right move by staying with El Duque, but it didn't work.</p>
        <p>''I think we have been down this road so many times, not necessarily in the World Series, but we've been here,'' Torre said. ''We've been pretty good responding to losses and hopefully we'll do it again tomorrow.''</p>
