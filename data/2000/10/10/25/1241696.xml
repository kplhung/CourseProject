        <p>A young man with disheveled hair squatted on the ground, paintbrush in hand, adding golden touches of fall to his watercolor. His paint box rested on the ground too, and beside him a black umbrella was propped open to protect his work in case of rain.</p>
        <p>The sight of someone creating his own individual work of art, in his own little world, seemed almost shocking in this most conformist of places. A few fleeting words with this man -- the only contact possible, and illicit at that -- explained some basic things about life in this North Korean city of two million.</p>
        <p>He was not an amateur enjoying a free moment, but an art student on assignment. Why was he painting this particular scene? A look of bewilderment crossed his face, a hesitation, and an uncertainty about how to deal with a personal question, especially from a foreigner.</p>
        <p>His answer came in the context of an instruction, much as his life must have been lived growing up here, where sirens blast a wake-up call at 7 a.m., another siren blows at noon to mark the lunch break and vans with megaphones cruise the streets exhorting people to work hard to help the country.</p>
        <p>He was told, he said, to paint the fall season and to include a building in the landscape. He chose the gray, low-slung railway station but could not explain why, even though the building, with its octagonal tower, is one of the most graceful in the concrete city.</p>
        <p>There is no such notion as a busy downtown here. Monumental buildings with red Korean script announcing their function are built across the city, and from some spots the effect is quite an imposing skyline. But from street level the overwhelming vision is of bleak walls, the only advertising scattered red posters of the Communist leadership in triumphant poses.</p>
        <p>Occasionally a packed, decrepit trolley car rumbled by the park, but for the most part people walked -- and some lucky ones cycled.</p>
        <p>The city is spotlessly clean: there is absolutely no consumer trash to be seen, but if there were, it would be cleaned up by the women who sweep the streets with makeshift brooms made of long twigs. Dimly lit underpasses used for crossing the street are tiled in drab green and brown, the walls devoid of any decoration, and the lighting is so murky that people using them could easily collide.</p>
        <p>The city boasts a two-line subway system with 18 stations, which is described by the authorities as another feat of Communist excellence. At 8 a.m. today there was virtually no traffic on the street and few people on the sidewalks, but at the entrance to one of the central subway stations, people dressed for office work drifted in and out.</p>
        <p>Across from the painter, a young woman stood under a brightly colored umbrella with a cooler on top of her vendor's stand. Shyly, she opened the lid to reveal piles of cream-colored frozen ices in cylindrical and rectangular shapes -- without wrappers. An apron tied around her neck had the words ''good friend'' scrawled across it, probably a castoff sent by a Western aid group.</p>
        <p>To the untutored eye the woman seemed like the first crack in the Communist-run economy. Perhaps she made the ices herself, or perhaps she bought them from a factory and was hawking them for her private gain. Not so. Her little business, like every other public sign of enterprise, is actually part of a cooperative that benefits everyone in her apartment block.</p>
        <p>As in most Communist countries, this is a two-tier society, the haves and have-nots, but more so: there are those in the party hierarchy, and ordinary cadres. The privileged were on stark display today at the Japanese Noodle House, a year-old restaurant in the center of the city, which prefers dollars for payment.</p>
        <p>At a corner table in the back room under a poster of a green waterfall, four senior party officials -- dubbed ''uppers'' by North Koreans -- ate a splendid lunch of noodles served on stainless steel platters, spicy pancakes and roasted vegetables.</p>
        <p>One of the men, with a broad physique and dressed in an olive uniform, looked like a replica of the man North Koreans call their dear leader, Kim Jong Il.</p>
        <p>The man had enhanced his likeness to Mr. Kim by adopting his hairstyle, an upswept black crop, permed into waves. Exactly how that effect is achieved is not clear, because a barbershop near the hotel where reporters are staying showed no evidence, among the 1950's equipment and chairs, of using chemical substances.</p>
        <p>As the lunch progressed, a three-quarter-full bottle of Dewar's whiskey appeared from behind a counter. Several of the men poured themselves a glass, straight up. The bottle, the private preserve of the group, was then returned to the waitress for a future meal. To top off the repast, bowls of white ice cream were served, a specialty of the Pyongyang Food Factory.</p>
        <p>People here in Pyongyang are better dressed than might be expected in a command economy that is under such stress that experts have wondered why it has not collapsed.</p>
        <p>Compared with Beijing during the Cultural Revolution of the 1960's and 70's, when everyone wore drab Mao suits, Pyongyang looks like a veritable kaleidoscope of colors and style. Women and children wear brightly hued clothes, many of them apparently sewn at home.</p>
        <p>At the Station Department Store, named for its location near the train station, women lined up at the fabric counter to choose from dozens of bolts of cloth.</p>
        <p>The underwear counter was busy too, as mothers got their children ready for the winter. One 6-year-old boy squirmed into a new set of yellow pajamas, his face scrunched up in disapproval. The counter with more luxurious items -- pink and chartreuse padded bras imported from Thailand and nylon half-slips -- had no customers.</p>
        <p>But Pyongyang does not represent the whole country, and the authorities are aware of it. A reporter's advance request to travel just 30 miles to the west was refused. Why? Ten miles from here starts the real North Korea, where medical supplies are nonexistent and hospitals are just empty, rundown rooms.</p>
        <p>''It's like going from relative luxury to the Stone Age,'' said a foreign official with broad experience here.</p>
        <p>Historically, Korea has been a feudal and isolated country. After 55 years of hard-core Communism in the North, it is hard to assess how much of the submission to authoritarian leaders and the xenophobia comes from half a century of rule by Kim Il Sung and now his son, Kim Jong Il, and how much from hundreds of years of being hidden from the world.</p>
        <p>The Communist leaders have been highly successful in keeping North Korea in its own cocoon. It has only one television station, government-run and loaded with propaganda; a variety of official newspapers; and one press agency, whose feature today was the visit of Mr. Kim to a catfish farm. A mass movement to catfish farming is under way, the story concluded.</p>
        <p>There is, of course, no Internet access in a country that has only about two telephones for every 100 people and lines at the battered public phone booths on the street.</p>
        <p>How long this isolation can last as the government reaches out to forge diplomatic relations is a tantalizing question. Once the barriers are breached and North Koreans see the difference between their standard of living and others, will they remain loyal to the Communist leadership?</p>
        <p>It would be hard for North Korea to have less contact with the outside world. Two flights a week arrive from and depart for Beijing, and there are on-and-off direct links to Vladivostok in Russia and Shenyang in China. Before the collapse of the Soviet Union and East Germany, there were flights to Moscow and Berlin.</p>
        <p>The number of foreign residents has swollen in the last few years with foreign aid workers -- there are now about 100, including just one American, Douglas Broderick, country director for the United Nations World Food Program.</p>
        <p>All told, about 500 foreigners live here now, including diplomats from such comrade countries as Cuba and Libya. The foreigners are required to live in an isolated compound and seem to make almost no inroads into Korean society.</p>
        <p>On the streets this morning, most people refused to make eye contact. A minder from the Foreign Ministry who insisted on coming along for a walk refused to allow any man-in-the-street interviews, a rare prohibition in any country.</p>
        <p>The suspicion toward foreigners is legendary, including the incident involving a Tass reporter several years ago. After an auto accident in which he injured a pedestrian, a crowd gathered and then turned on him and cut off one of his ears.</p>
        <p>That was an extreme example, but it gives officials whose job it is to supervise nosy reporters plenty of ammunition. When two reporters wandered out of their hotel to the railway station today, they had been gone for about 20 minutes when a minder from the Foreign Ministry caught up with them and insisted that they return.</p>
        <p>''You are putting yourself at risk,'' he said, briskly turning his charges around. ''You don't understand the resentment of our people toward foreigners, especially Americans.''</p>
