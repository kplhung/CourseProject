        <p>In the background of the Yankees' euphoria unleashed with the folklore swing of Jim Leyritz in Game 4 of the 1996 World Series, there was the frazzled Atlanta pitcher who set up the spectacular comeback by the Yankees.</p>
        <p>That pitcher was Denny Neagle. With the Braves' bullpen weary and Atlanta leading the series, two games to one, the Braves were relying on Neagle to put them in full control of that year's series. He seemed well on his way to that end, entering the sixth inning with a 6-0 lead. Then, Neagle's control vanished and a quick exit soon followed. Although the game was stamped by Leyritz's three-run home run off reliever Mark Wohlers in the eighth inning that tied the game, Neagle opened the way for the Yankees' miracle with his collapse in the sixth.</p>

        <p>In the background of the Yankees' euphoria unleashed with the folklore swing of Jim Leyritz in Game 4 of the 1996 World Series, there was the frazzled Atlanta pitcher who set up the spectacular comeback by the Yankees.</p>
        <p>That pitcher was Denny Neagle. With the Braves' bullpen weary and Atlanta leading the series, two games to one, the Braves were relying on Neagle to put them in full control of that year's series. He seemed well on his way to that end, entering the sixth inning with a 6-0 lead. Then, Neagle's control vanished and a quick exit soon followed. Although the game was stamped by Leyritz's three-run home run off reliever Mark Wohlers in the eighth inning that tied the game, Neagle opened the way for the Yankees' miracle with his collapse in the sixth.</p>
        <p>When Neagle arrived in New York this season after the All-Star Game break, he expressed his desire for another chance at handling the pressure of a moment like the one he had in Atlanta. Tonight at Shea Stadium, the opportunity will arrive when Neagle, the Yankees' left-hander, starts against the Mets in Game 4 of the World Series, with the Mets hoping to build on their Game 3 victory.</p>
        <p>It was not a decision Yankees Manager Joe Torre arrived at easily. Torre could have sided with sentiment and experience, ignored a 4-14 record, and chosen David Cone to make his first start at Shea since leaving the Mets in 1992. But Torre went with Neagle, instead.</p>
        <p>''I felt like I at least warranted the Game 4 start,'' Neagle said before Game 3 last night. ''I feel like I did do my job well enough that I thought Joe would name me the fourth-game starter. That being said, I totally understand why David was being considered for the Game 4 start. The one thing I do want to say, is a lot was being said of the loyalty factor and different things of why Cone might have started.</p>
        <p>''I think that was also an insult to Coney in the fact that he's 5-0 with a 2.00 earned run average in the World Series.'' (Cone is actually 2-0 with a 2.15 E.R.A.)</p>
        <p>There were several reasons for Torre to choose Neagle. The Yankees' left-handed pitchers have had success against the Mets' lineup, and Neagle's history at Shea Stadium is impressive: entering this season, he was 5-2 at Shea with a 2.39 E.R.A. In his last start against the Mets, with the Reds in April, Neagle threw seven innings, giving up two hits and no runs.</p>
        <p>''If he throws strikes, he'll be fine,'' Torre said. ''When he throws strikes, he gets people out.''</p>
