        <p>The most excitement at Madison Square Garden last night came during the first intermission. It was created by two peewee teams from Staten Island.</p>
        <p>Against a depleted Philadelphia Flyers lineup that resembled a squad of impostors, the Rangers spotted the woeful Flyers a 3-0 lead after one period en route to a 5-4 loss. The defeat was not only the Rangers' fourth in their last five games. It was also the Rangers' third straight loss on Garden ice, which has not been kind to them for more than three seasons. Twice in those three home losses this season, the Rangers have fallen behind by three goals before their first score. The other home loss was to a Tampa Bay team that had been beaten by five goals playing the Devils the evening before.</p>
        <p>''We can't be that fragile,'' Coach Ron Low said. ''If we're that fragile, we're not going anywhere anyway.''</p>
        <p>Low made all sorts of changes to his forward lines coming into the game, hoping it would shake up the Rangers. During the national anthem, Valery Kamensky and Theo Fleury were standing between Brian Leetch and Mark Messier.</p>
        <p>Adam Graves, usually located between Leetch and Messier, was on the bench with his new linemates, Mike York and John MacLean. And Michal Grosek was in street clothes, his spot taken for at least one evening by MacLean.</p>
        <p>The changes mattered little at the start, however.</p>
        <p>''There's really no way to explain it,'' said Leetch, one of the few Rangers to have a very good game.</p>
        <p>The Rangers' first two goals -- the first from Jan Hlavac, the second from Leetch -- came with the Czech line on the ice. Their third came from Graves, his second of the season, on the power play with 5 minutes 20 seconds remaining in the game. Their last came from Kamensky with 13 seconds left to play.</p>
        <p>This was the Philadelphia B team to whom the Rangers lost so miserably, falling to a record of 3-4. There was no Mark Recchi, who is still suffering from a concussion and was a late scratch. No John LeClair, who underwent back surgery last Saturday. No Eric Lindros, a restricted free agent who is recuperating from a series of concussions suffered over the past two seasons.</p>
        <p>No wonder that the Flyers opened the season 1-5-2; or that they came into the Garden on a seven-game streak without a victory.</p>
        <p>And the Rangers could not handle this team?</p>
        <p>''Are we any better than anybody right now?'' Low said. ''No, we're not.''</p>
        <p>Wayne Gretzky could have empathized. He was sitting rinkside with his wife, Janet, last night. Not much has changed from Gretzky's last two seasons with the Rangers, who have not qualified for the postseason since 1996-97, when Gretzky joined them.</p>
        <p>The Rangers have not had a winning record at the Garden since that season.</p>
        <p>The Flyers scored on two of their first three shots on goal last night, the first score coming 12 seconds into the game. Keith Primeau, one of the few name players in the Philadelphia lineup, intercepted an ill-advised backhanded pass by Messier with no mustard on it along the left boards inside the Rangers' zone. The forechecking Primeau skated in alone on the Rangers' goalie, Kirk McLean, then beat McLean on the short side for his fourth goal of the season.</p>
        <p>''When the leader of your team makes a mistake like that early in the game, it really seemed to rattle us,'' said Messier, who played despite having the flu.</p>
        <p>Jody Hull made it 2-0 Flyers at 6:56 from a bad angle. And when Daymond Langkow scored on the power play at 17:25, it was 3-0 Philadelphia, and 11-1 Flyers in shots.</p>
        <p>The Rangers mustered a short-lived rally in the second period to pull to within a goal at 3-2. Hlavac scored his third goal of the season at 4:03 by corralling a loose puck in the slot, then beating the second-year goaltender Brian Boucher with a backhand to his glove side.</p>
        <p>And then Leetch deked Hull at the top of the slot on the power play with a fabulous outside-in move, then beat Boucher with a low shot that clanged off one of Eric Desjardins's skates at 15:23. For Leetch, it was his second goal of the season. And the Rangers were down by one goal.</p>
        <p>But then Philadelphia's 19-year-old rookie, Justin Williams, placed a backhander between McLean's legs from just off the left post at 18:54 with the Rangers' defensive pair of Kim Johnsson and Brad Brown caught up ice.</p>
        <p>''That was the goal that really killed us,'' Low said.</p>
        <p>Of the Rangers' belated final period rally, Fleury said, ''If there's another five minutes, it's a different scenario.''</p>
        <p>If the Rangers would learn to play a better first 20 minutes, they would not be 1-3 at home.</p>
