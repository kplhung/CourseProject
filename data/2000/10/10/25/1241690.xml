        <p>The Rev. Luigi Marinelli, a retired monsignor who ran afoul of the Vatican when he published a best-selling expose on church intrigue, died of liver and bone cancer on Monday, his nephew said. He was 73.</p>
        <p>Monsignor Marinelli, who worked at the Vatican for 45 years, was summoned to appear before a Roman Catholic court last year after he was identified as one of the anonymous authors of ''Via Col Vento in Vaticano'' (''Gone With the Wind in the Vatican''). He declined to appear, saying he could not recant.</p>
        <p>When the Vatican ordered him to remove the work from bookstores, the long-ignored book, published by Kaos, a leftist, anticlerical publishing house, became a best seller.</p>
        <p>The book portrayed some high-level Vatican officials as greedy and careerist, and included anecdotes about sexual misconduct and corruption of Catholic clergymen, but no names were given, and most of the stories were decades old.</p>
        <p>In an interview last year, Monsignor Marinelli lamented what he described as persecution by the Vatican. ''The book does not question the sanctity of Jesus Christ, the Eucharist or the Catholic Church,'' he complained. ''It just points out that the Vatican is made up of men, like me, who are flawed.''</p>
        <p>His funeral was held today at a church in Cerignola, his hometown in southern Italy. Family members said they had been asked not to hold the funeral in the cathedral there.</p>
