        <p>President Alberto K. Fujimori's shadowy intelligence chief, whose surprise return from exile in Panama plunged the country into a crisis, said today that he had no intention of playing a role in politics.</p>
        <p>The former chief, Vladimiro Montesinos, fled a month ago after a videotape was broadcast on cable television that showed him handing $15,000 to a newly elected opposition legislator to change parties.</p>
        <p>The video led Mr. Fujimori to call for new elections four years before the end of his third term and to promise to leave office in July.</p>
        <p>Calling a radio station, Mr. Montesinos said he had to leave Panama because he was in immediate danger of being assassinated by elements of two Peruvian terrorist groups and drug traffickers who operate in Panama. ''That's the only reason for my return, not to destabilize the country,'' Mr. Montesinos said. ''All I want to do is dedicate myself to my work as a lawyer.''</p>
        <p>It was the first time in years that Mr. Montesinos had spoken publicly, but the interview raised more questions than it answered.</p>
        <p>The former spy chief did not disclose his whereabouts, which have been subject to great speculation since he landed at an air force base on Monday in Pisco. He did not say whether he had been in contact with Mr. Fujimori since he returned, although he described calling Mr. Fujimori from an airport in Ecuador, where his private jet refueled.</p>
