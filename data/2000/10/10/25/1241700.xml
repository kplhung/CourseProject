        <p>Casting further doubt on its proposed $3.8 billion acquisition of Northeast Utilities, Consolidated Edison said today that it would ask Connecticut's utilities regulatory agency to reconsider its decision last week to impose dozens of conditions that company officials said could kill the deal.</p>
        <p>Investors sent Northeast Utilities' stock price plunging $2.25 today to close at $19.13, 10.5 percent below Monday's closing price.</p>
        <p>Earlier this month, Con Ed's chairman, Eugene R. McGrath, criticized the state's Department of Public Utility Control for issuing a draft approval document containing conditions that he said did not benefit company shareholders.</p>
        <p>On Thursday, after the agency announced its final approval of the deal, Con Ed responded with less-than-enthusiastic silence. Finally, on Monday, the company issued a statement after the markets closed saying that the conditions were ''substantially different from anything that we had any reason to expect.''</p>
        <p>''Unless the order is substantially modified,'' the statement said, ''it so significantly changes the economic effects and risks of the merger that it calls into serious question whether the transaction will be completed.''</p>
        <p>Today, a Con Ed spokesman, Joseph P. Petta, said the company would not discuss specific conditions it objected to. But among the likely sticking points are those that would cost the merged company, to be called New Consolidated Edison, millions of dollars over several years.</p>
        <p>To prevent the company from using labor cuts to recover a mandated cut in residential gas and electricity rates, the state agency demanded that the company impose a two-year freeze on layoffs. The agency would also prevent the company from recovering a $1.5 billion ''acquisition premium'' from consumers by forcing two Northeast Utilities subsidiaries to split any profits above 11 percent with consumers.</p>
        <p>It would also force Con Ed to accept a $60 million loss in costs created by the deregulation process.</p>
        <p>Con Ed has 11 days to send the agency a formal request to reconsider its conditions, an agency spokeswoman said. The agency would then have 25 days to respond.</p>
        <p>The proposed merger would place 6.5 million gas and electricity customers in eight states under the aegis of what would be the largest utility company in the Northeast.</p>
        <p>Richard Blumenthal, Connecticut's attorney general, has urged the state to reject Con Ed, saying the deal would hurt the state's consumers, environment and economy.</p>
