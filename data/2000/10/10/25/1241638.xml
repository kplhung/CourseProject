        <p>LATE one night recently, while on call as a resident at New York Weill Cornell Medical Center, an intern inadvertently showed me a new wave in medicine.</p>
        <p>We were admitting a young woman with AIDS and a case of pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, commonly known as PCP. This virulent pneumonia used to be a frequent and deadly AIDS complication, but thanks to effective antibiotics, it is now a relatively uncommon reason for hospital admission.

        <p>LATE one night recently, while on call as a resident at New York Weill Cornell Medical Center, an intern inadvertently showed me a new wave in medicine.</p>
        <p>We were admitting a young woman with AIDS and a case of pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, commonly known as PCP. This virulent pneumonia used to be a frequent and deadly AIDS complication, but thanks to effective antibiotics, it is now a relatively uncommon reason for hospital admission. Fifteen years earlier, I would have known exactly how to treat it, but that night, I was at a loss. ''Curbside infectious disease,'' I told my intern, meaning I needed an informal consultation with a specialist.</p>
        <p>Instead, the intern went online. Within minutes, using a service called MD Consult, he had printed out all the information we needed: first- , second-  and third-line antibiotics and their doses, how long to treat, when to use steroids and so on. It was like getting a consultation with an infectious-disease specialist without the hassle. The consultation was quick, authoritative and, above all, accessible. In fact, a few months later, when I consulted the infectious-disease specialist about a separate issue, she asked me to wait a few minutes so she could look up the answer on the Internet.</p>
        <p>In hospitals, information technology tends to creep at a glacial pace. Not so among the ranks of harried, technology savvy residents, who are abandoning many of the traditional tools of the trade in favor of computer terminals and wireless Internet devices. They are downloading disease and drug information, searching the medical literature and reading abstracts and full-length articles in online journals.</p>
        <p>More and more residents are becoming accustomed to using the Internet in medical schools, many of which are putting portions of their curriculums online. Students at the Weill Cornell Medical College in New York regularly exchange e-mail messages about Web sites useful for learning about pathology, histology and anatomy.</p>
        <p>But nobody is using the Internet  to admit or manage patients -- checking test results or writing progress notes, for example. The technology isn't there yet.</p>
        <p>As with all new technologies, there are early converts, and there are unlikely converts. For example, Dr. Keith Lascalea, a second-year resident in internal medicine at New York Weill Cornell, bought a hand-held Palm device in June and practically overnight went from being a computer illiterate to an enthusiastic technophile.</p>
        <p>''It's the best purchase I ever made,'' he said. Palm in hand, he uses medical software, including Medmath, to calculate commonly used formulas; 5-minute Clinical Consult for baffling cases while on call; and Epocrates for drug information. He can also call up more than 600 medical notes that he has downloaded from the Web, typed in or been sent by other residents.</p>
        <p>''Last year, my main resources were a dog-eared Washington Manual and a few books in my backpack,'' he said. ''Now I have a library in my pocket.''</p>
        <p>Experienced physicians, too, are using the new medium. Recently, Dr. Lascalea said, he was working with a senior physician and was consulted about a young man with bloody urine. Dr. Lascalea sat down immediately at a nursing station and logged on to the Internet. He looked over and the senior physician was doing the same. ''We got the information faster than if we had gone to a book,'' Dr. Lascalea said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Anthony Altobelli, a first-year cardiology fellow at New York Weill Cornell, uses a Palm device. Recently, he tried software for keeping track of patients but found it cumbersome. Instead, Dr. Altobelli decided to type his patients' medical histories and medications into his computer and download the information onto his Palm. He says that it is like carrying his patients' charts  with him in his breast pocket.</p>
        <p>''I get paged in the cafeteria, I don't have to go running up to the clinic to find a paper chart,'' he said, tapping with a stylus on his hand-held device. ''It's all here.''</p>
        <p>Residency programs are beginning to train doctors in the latest information technology. Most already train residents to use the Web to search medical literature. A few give residents hand-held Internet devices. Still, this digital revolution is being powered by residents, not their institutions.</p>
        <p>In my residency program, more than half the residents already have hand-held devices, and most of the rest plan to buy them. ''I don't think the people above us use the Internet as much as we do -- or they should,'' Dr. Lascalea said.</p>
        <p>But is the Internet making residents' work lives easier? Dr. Peter Hahn, a third-year resident at New York Weill Cornell and a self-described ''techno-geek,'' recently spent a month brainstorming software for residents at MedicaLogic, a company in Portland, Ore., that has merged with Medscape. He concluded that software for the foreseeable future would be too cumbersome to really help residents perform their daily tasks.</p>
        <p>''Can you imagine residents, already short of time, working on a system as slow as the Palm?'' Dr. Hahn asked. MedicaLogic asked him to design a program to help residents take a medical history. ''Programs run in a linear fashion,'' he said, explaining why a useful program was a ways off. ''Residents jump around, and that's how they save time.''</p>
        <p>Like many physicians, Dr. Hahn extols the virtues of e-mail. He has a special hospital address where his patients can communicate with him. He checks it, and returns queries, about once a day. He says that e-mail saves him a great deal of time when he is dealing with patients who have chronic or nonemergency complaints. One big concern is whether using e-mail to communicate with patients will be time-consuming. Reassuring results are found in a 1998 survey that showed that regular use of e-mail did not increase workload.</p>
        <p>Dr. Vikas Bhushan, a former resident and the chief executive of Medschool.com, a company dedicated to providing medical-school-quality education for health care professionals online, thinks that the Internet has a long way to go before it significantly reduces residents' workloads. While the tools are there, he says, he is unsure about their impact.</p>
        <p>''When I was interviewing at Cedars Sinai in Los Angeles nine years ago, they took us to the I.C.U. and showed us software that was going to allow doctors to manage patients -- adjust medications and ventilator settings, for example -- through a computer interface,'' Dr. Bhushan said. ''At the time, residents were leaving the unit at 2, 3, 4 in the afternoon'' after a 34-hour shift on call. ''Recently I asked my cousin, who's now a resident there, if they had implemented the software. 'Yes,' he said. I asked him when he was getting out post call.''</p>
        <p>The answer? '' 'About 4 p.m.' ''</p>
