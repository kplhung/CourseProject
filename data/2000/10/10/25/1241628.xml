        <p>IN the beginning, that is, a few years ago, celebrity sites were usually little more than fans' altars to the famous. In recent years, more and more celebrities have set up their own sites, realizing the power of the Internet to make them even more famous.</p>
        <p>But there are other sites on which celebrities seek to combine their fame with the Web's accessibility to promote charitable causes, help build more informed communities and pursue business opportunities.

        <p>RUSSELL SIMMONS'S 360HIPHOP</p>
        <p>(www.360hiphop.com)  Hip-Hop entrepreneur develops a virtual community</p>
        <p>Russell Simmons has been bringing hip-hop music and culture to the mainstream for nearly 20 years. This year, he started 360hiphop.com -- billed as ''the ultimate destination for all things hip-hop'' -- with a little political consciousness tossed in as well. Visitors to the site will find extensive content on hip-hop music, lifestyle and culture plus a political section where Mr. Simmons's influence is particularly felt, said Selwyn Hinds, the chief creative officer and editorial director. ''Russell has always had a deep social conscience, as marked by his consistent involvement in charity. I think 360hiphop has given shape and form to his political conscience.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hinds thinks that hip-hop is ''the prime driver of youth culture today'' and that 360's mission is to ''observe, comment on and contribute to that cultural phenomenon.'' It is an ambitious site with broadcasting and multimedia abilities and plans to expand an e-commerce section where users can buy music, clothes and other merchandise. A new home page design now provides better access to what's on the site and promotes interaction among users.</p>
        <p>''We're having a two-way exchange with the hip-hop community about the things that move and matter to them,'' Mr. Hinds said. ''It's not just a conversation centered around entertainment and titillation. It's about the deep cultural roots in what we do and about the politics and issues that impact our community.''</p>
