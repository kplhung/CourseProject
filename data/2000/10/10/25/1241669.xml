        <p>''Sound and Fury'' was shown as part of this year's New Directors/New Films Series. Following are excerpts from Anita Gates's review, which appeared in The New York Times on April 8. The film opens today at the Film Forum, 209 West Houston Street, South Village.</p>
        <p>To many people it's an unexpected viewpoint. ''When all three of my children were born deaf, too,'' says Peter Artinian early in the film ''Sound and Fury,'' ''I thought, 'Great.' '' And he is not being ironic.</p>
        <p>A documentary about cochlear implants, the relatively new devices that allow many deaf people to hear, may not sound like anyone's idea of compelling filmmaking, but Josh Aronson's ''Sound and Fury'' -- which follows two branches of a Long Island family through the decision-making process about the implant's use -- is powerful, insightful, important and emotionally wrenching.</p>
        <p>The implant is a miracle, really. Most hearing people would assume that any loving parent of a hearing-impaired child would want this piece of medical technology for that child, because it would ease his or her way in the world enormously. For that reason Mr. Artinian's attitude may come as a shock.</p>
        <p>Mr. Artinian, his wife, Nita, and their three children are deaf. His daughter, Heather, decides she wants an implant. He is opposed. Chris Artinian, Peter's brother, is not deaf, but he and his wife soon learn that their newborn son is. And they very much want him to have the implant surgery. The opposing viewpoints make for painful family confrontations.</p>
        <p>''It's not intended for people to have a handicap,'' says the children's grandfather, who is not deaf, to his son, Peter. ''If I didn't know you, I would say you were an abusing parent.''</p>
        <p>The complicating factor here is deaf culture, the emotional and social bond among nonhearing people who use American Sign Language and have come to cherish their silent world as special and worth preserving. The eagerness of loved ones to jump on the cochlear implant bandwagon comes as a betrayal to some. As  Peter says to his mother during a backyard get-together, ''I didn't know that you didn't accept deafness until now.''</p>
        <p>''Sound and Fury'' is asking some big questions. In a socially aware culture, people profess to believe that no skin color, religion, sexual orientation, political ideology, chronological age or physical attribute is superior to  another. They say that differences should be celebrated; thus the corporate buzzword of the moment, diversity.</p>
        <p>Are the deaf parents in this film calling the culture's bluff? Or is a  physical disadvantage truly something that should be celebrated? Do parents have a right to keep their children at a remove from the hearing world just because, in their opinion and experience, deaf is beautiful? Have we gone so far in our fear of offending anyone that we now advocate disadvantages' being deliberately preserved? Or do the hearing-impaired have a right to rear their children within a somewhat separatist subculture? The Amish have been doing that for quite a while.</p>
        <p>The most telling event in the film is Nita Artinian's change of heart. In the beginning she supports her daughter Heather's request for the implant and, in fact, wants one herself. But after Nita learns that the implant will be far less helpful to her as an adult, she changes her mind. ''We're afraid that the cochlear implant will change her identity,'' says Nita after a visit to a preschool class of children with implants.</p>
        <p>Later, in a scene between mother and daughter, Nita uses the word ''we'' in discussing the decision. Heather corrects her with ''I thought you decided.'' Nita answers: ''Don't you remember? We decided together.''</p>
