        <p>Renovating the Midtown quarters of the International Center of Photography,  Gwathmey Siegel &amp; Associates Architects have fashioned an airy, cascading series of permanent galleries that will serve as the center's new home.</p>
        <p>''A dream come true,'' said Cornell Capa, who founded the center in 1974, as he toured the space yesterday and workers busily hung and re-hung photographs and  applied finishing touches, with a black-tie dinner only hours away.</p>

        <p>Renovating the Midtown quarters of the International Center of Photography,  Gwathmey Siegel &amp; Associates Architects have fashioned an airy, cascading series of permanent galleries that will serve as the center's new home.</p>
        <p>''A dream come true,'' said Cornell Capa, who founded the center in 1974, as he toured the space yesterday and workers busily hung and re-hung photographs and  applied finishing touches, with a black-tie dinner only hours away.</p>
        <p>The building, at 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, supplants the museum's former base on the Upper East Side. It will reopen on Nov. 3 with three simultaneous shows: ''Reflections in a Glass Eye: Works from the International Center of Photography Collection,'' ''Annie Leibovitz: Women'' and ''Collected Visions: An Installation by Lorie Novak.''</p>
        <p>Although the center has had its midtown branch at No. 1133 for 11 years, visitors will find an entirely new space, beginning with an entrance directly off the avenue rather than at the edge of the mid-block plaza.</p>
        <p>Immediately inside is the museum store. Ahead, the galleries are suffused with light from a translucent south-facing window (with an ultraviolet filter) over the stairway that leads to the lower level. An exceptionally blond maple floor, joined in an almost seamless finish, contributes to the luminosity.</p>
        <p>The downstairs is given a ceremonial presence by a polymorphous recessed lighting cove placed over the wide stairway. The shape might be likened to that of a cloud, an amoeba or a work by Jean Arp.</p>
        <p>From the top of the stairs, one sees galleries below, branching off in several directions. A small cafe, with translucent glass-topped tables, will occupy part of the atrium.</p>
        <p>Also downstairs is a 20-foot-long, wedge-shaped wall that seems to float two feet above the maple wood floor. It is designed to help visitors orient themselves as they step off the elevator.</p>
        <p>The overall impression is not of a hangar-like space, as it used to be, but of distinct environments linked by the expansive atrium.</p>
        <p>''I wanted people to feel, from a programmatic point of view, that there was a real richness of content,'' said Willis Hartshorn, the center's director.</p>
        <p>That includes the ever-growing use of digital photography and other electronic media.</p>
        <p>''Every room should be a screening room,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The $10.5 million project was made possible partly by the sale of the center's landmark building at Fifth Avenue and 94th Street, originally the Willard Straight residence, to Bruce Kovner, chairman of the Caxton Corporation, a hedge fund. He plans to restore it as a private home.</p>
        <p>It was also made possible by the lease terms offered by the Durst Organization, which built and owns 1133 Avenue of the Americas. Steve Rooney, the center's deputy director for administration, said that the approximate cost was about $140,000 annually, perhaps 10 percent of market value. ''It makes the Durst family one of our largest donors,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The space was originally an electronics store, said Douglas Durst, president of the Durst Organization. But to lure the Eastman Kodak Company as an office tenant in the 1970's, the Dursts suggested that it be converted into a Kodak gallery. After that, the space became a showcase for Chinese products.</p>
        <p>In the 80's a senior trade official told Mr. Durst that China would be pleased if it could be let out of its lease. ''I thought if I could make the government of 1.5 billion people happy, I should do it,'' he said.</p>
        <p>As he was negotiating with Mamma Leone's restaurant, Mr. Durst said, Kodak reappeared to say that it wanted the space back, this time to sublet it to the International Center of Photography, which opened there in 1989.</p>
        <p>The museum signed its own lease last year, which runs through 2013.</p>
