        <p>INSURANCE means more than insurance companies, and different sectors are experimenting with the Internet in different ways. Here are some snapshots of recent activities by the government and private industry, by for-profit and nonprofit health maintenance organizations and by Blue Cross and Blue Shield.</p>
        <p>HEALTH CARE FINANCING ADMINISTRATION -- One big step toward widespread electronic processing of insurance claims came in August, when the agency, which runs Medicare and Medicaid, proposed a standard format to streamline the processing of health care claims throughout the industry.</p>
        <p>Different insurers now require different electronic and paper forms from doctors and hospitals filing claims. Under the new regulation, all electronic claims will have to follow the new standard. All providers will be able to use the new format to send bills, and all insurance plans will be required to accept electronic claims and referrals. The agency says this will eventually save $1 billion a year as the standard format encourages more and more electronic filing. Paper forms, however, will still be allowed.</p>
        <p>OXFORD HEALTH PLANS -- Oxford's Web page, at www.oxhp.com, offers services for members, doctors and hospitals, employer groups and brokers. Revamped last March, it won an award in July from CIO magazine as one of the top business Web sites. The citation noted that the site ''moves beyond the basics of providing information by incorporating distinct capabilities for conducting online transactions.''</p>
        <p>A ''MyOxford'' page allows members to complete 10 kinds of transactions, from choosing a primary care physician or specialist to ordering materials to checking claims history. Benefits administrators can perform six kinds of transactions, from replacing identification cards to requesting forms and other materials to checking an employee's eligibility. Doctors and hospitals can undertake six different transactions, from checking a member's eligibility to inquiring about a referral.</p>
        <p>KAISER PERMANENTE -- Kaiser, one of the nation's largest nonprofit H.M.O.'s, with 8.6 million members and 10,000 physicians (plus 40,000 other clinicians), illustrates another way the medical industry can make use of electronic information exchanges.</p>
        <p>The company maintains a clinical information Web site, Permanente Knowledge Connection (http: //pkc.kp.org), which gives its doctors and nurses access to updated information about patients and their treatment. Clinicians can also share medical knowledge and participate in discussion groups with colleagues online.</p>
        <p>At Kaiser Permanente online, members in some parts of the country can also gain access to drug and medical encyclopedias, request appointments and find information on benefit options, local health education classes physician directories and even driving directions. They may also question nurses and pharmacists confidentially.</p>
        <p>BLUE CROSS AND BLUE SHIELD -- The Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association shows the kind of personalized health care service that many insurers want to offer the patients they cover. Known as Personal Path, the Web site gives patients a customized source of information about health care.</p>
        <p>What makes the site especially useful to individuals, the association says, is that users enter data into the Web site with the participation of their physicians. That means that the confidential, password-protected site holds information on their conditions and treatments, medications they are receiving, and data like weight, blood pressure and cholesterol.</p>
        <p>GENERAL MOTORS -- The nation's largest corporation, G.M. is also the largest private purchaser of health care. In 1999, it spent $3.5 billion on health benefits for 193,000 employees in 33 states and 400,000 retirees in all 50. Like many companies, G.M. is self-insured: the company assumes responsibility for paying claims to doctors, hospitals, drugstores and other providers.</p>
        <p>Employees and retirees have a wide choice of H.M.O.'s and other plans. By visiting an internal Web site -- accessible at work and by home computer -- they can type in a password and find out which plans they can join; what benefits each plan offers; and how the plans are rated by an independent agency. Then, having chosen a plan, they can enroll online.</p>
        <p>Through the site, employees and retirees can see a record of their recent prescriptions and refill them online. And they can go to a ''Life Steps'' site and receive personalized advice on staying healthy.</p>
