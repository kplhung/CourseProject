        <p>Even as it struggles to remove an unauthorized variety of genetically engineered corn from the nation's food chain, the developer of that corn is preparing to ask the government for temporary authorization for the corn to be used in food, according to food industry and government officials.</p>
        <p>The idea is backed by wide segments of the food industry, which see it as an expedient way to avoid disruptions that are now occurring in the distribution and processing of corn. Farmers, grain elevators, flour mills and food manufacturers have been scrambling to make sure the unapproved corn is not present in their products.</p>
        <p>Kellogg Company, for instance, curtailed production at a Memphis factory last week because the mill that supplied it had shut down to check for the unapproved corn.</p>
        <p>The corn, StarLink, had been approved for animal use but not human consumption because it contains a protein that has some characteristics of known allergens. Government science advisers were unable to determine whether the protein, known as Cry9C, could cause allergies.</p>
        <p>Under the plan being prepared, Aventis CropScience, a subsidiary of Aventis S.A., the company that developed the corn, will present new data to the Environmental Protection Agency in an effort to show that StarLink is present in such low amounts that people would not develop allergic reactions to it.</p>
        <p>''We are trying to move forward on updating a safety assessment,'' Rick Rountree, a spokesman for Aventis CropScience in Research Triangle Park, N.C., said today. ''A number of people in the food industry think it's a good strategy.''</p>
        <p>Aventis has already said it will stop selling StarLink for any use, and that decision is not expected to change. Rather, the officials said, the approval for human use would be long enough to cover use of corn from this year's harvest. That might require a couple of years or more because food made from this year's harvest might be on the supermarket shelves that long.</p>
        <p>An administration official said he had heard from food industry lobbyists that the filing would be made this week. The official, who spoke on the condition that he not be named, said the E.P.A. would be required to look at the new data but would make its decision on a scientific basis.</p>
        <p>The Aventis spokesman would not say what new evidence would be provided. But one industry official said the company would make the case that people need to be sensitized to an allergen over time in order to develop allergic reactions. It will argue that people will not be exposed to enough StarLink to develop allergies.</p>
        <p>''There would be so little in food that there wouldn't be enough to create a sensitivity,'' said Susan Keith, senior director for public policy at the National Corn Growers Association.</p>
        <p>She said that the request would be based in part on the fact that Aventis, with the help of the Department of Agriculture, is trying to buy this year's harvest from farmers at a premium to keep it from getting into the human food chain.</p>
        <p>She said the company believed it had accounted for about 87 percent of the harvest and that StarLink made up only about half of 1 percent of all corn acreage. So in the worst case, by that reckoning, the amount of StarLink unaccounted for is 13 percent of half a percent, or .065 percent.</p>
        <p>Industry executives are nonetheless worried that the episode could hurt American corn and food exports. Administration officials met Monday with representatives of the European Union, and there has been concern in Japan as well. It is not clear whether E.P.A. approval would address those concerns, because StarLink would have to be approved by individual countries for import.</p>
        <p>TECHNOLOGY  Correction:  October 26, 2000, Thursday  A headline in Business Day yesterday about plans by a developer of bioengineered corn to ask the government to modify a ban on its use in food misidentified the agency that could act. It is the Environmental Protection Agency, not the Food and Drug Administration.</p>
