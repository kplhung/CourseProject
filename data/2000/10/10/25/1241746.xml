        <p>THE POLLS</p>
        <p>A RUMBLING IN CALIFORNIA -- The presidential race is tightening in California, the nation's biggest trove of electoral votes. In a newly released poll, Vice President Al Gore's once-formidable lead over Gov. George W. Bush has shrunk to just five percentage points.</p>
        <p>The survey, by the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California, conducted in the period spanning the second and third debates, found Mr. Gore leading 44 percent to 39 percent among likely voters, down from a nine-point lead in September. Mr. Gore's support slipped away to the Green Party candidate, Ralph Nader, who polled at 6 percent, and to other third-party candidates. But Mr. Bush's support stayed level, showing that he still faces an uphill battle in the Golden State.</p>

        <p>THE POLLS</p>
        <p>A RUMBLING IN CALIFORNIA -- The presidential race is tightening in California, the nation's biggest trove of electoral votes. In a newly released poll, Vice President Al Gore's once-formidable lead over Gov. George W. Bush has shrunk to just five percentage points.</p>
        <p>The survey, by the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California, conducted in the period spanning the second and third debates, found Mr. Gore leading 44 percent to 39 percent among likely voters, down from a nine-point lead in September. Mr. Gore's support slipped away to the Green Party candidate, Ralph Nader, who polled at 6 percent, and to other third-party candidates. But Mr. Bush's support stayed level, showing that he still faces an uphill battle in the Golden State.</p>
        <p>The poll numbers were enough to prompt one Nader supporter, Greg MacArthur of the group Citizens for Strategic Voting, to drop plans to run full-page ads in California newspapers claiming that a ''vote for Nader is not a vote for Bush.'' The group wants to run the ads only in states not in play, in hopes of winning enough total votes for Mr. Nader to reach the 5 percent national threshold needed to qualify the party for matching federal campaign funds in 2004.</p>

        <p>FLIP-FLOP IN WISCONSIN -- In another new poll, this one from Wisconsin, long considered a hotly contested state, Gov. George W. Bush has taken a nine-point lead over Vice President Al Gore after trailing him by five points in a survey a month ago. The new poll, conducted last week by Harris Interactive  of Rochester, N.Y., put support for Ralph Nader at 5 percent, up a point from the poll released a month earlier.</p>

        <p>THE CLINTON SHADOW -- Should President Clinton campaign with Vice President Al Gore?</p>
        <p>''No'' was the resounding answer Monday night from most of a dozen people at a focus group in Marlton, N.J. Even voters who were Democrats and had favorable opinions of Mr. Clinton told the focus-group pollster, Peter Hart, that the president should steer clear of the Gore campaign.</p>
        <p>A Gallup Poll released yesterday affirmed this view. Voters were asked if they would be more likely or less likely to vote for Mr. Gore if Mr. Clinton campaigned with him. Forty percent said ''less likely,'' while only 17 percent said ''more likely.'' Gov. George W. Bush seems to relish the idea of Mr. Clinton appearing with Mr. Gore. ''If he can't help himself and starts getting out there and campaigns against me, the shadow returns,'' Mr. Bush said.</p>

        <p>STATEMENTS</p>
        <p>QUESTIONS ABOUT ARMS DEAL -- Four former secretaries of state and seven other former high level officials, most but not all veterans of Republican administrations, said yesterday that Vice President Al Gore agreed in 1995 to Russia's sale of ''highly threatening'' military equipment to Iran without fully informing Congress of the deal.</p>
        <p>''We are deeply disturbed by the agreement,'' the former officials said in a statement, faxed to The Associated Press on the eve of a hearing on the issue scheduled by Republican senators. It was signed by George P. Shultz, Henry A. Kissinger, James A. Baker III and Lawrence Eagleburger, former secretaries of state; by Frank C. Carlucci, Donald H. Rumsfeld, James R. Schlesinger and Caspar W. Weinberger, all former secretaries of defense; by a former director of central intelligence, R. James Woolsey, and by two former national security advisers, Zbigniew Brzezinski and Brent Scowcroft.</p>
        <p>All worked for Republicans except Mr. Brzezinski and Mr. Woolsey. Mr. Schlesinger served in both Republican and Democratic administrations. A footnote said the signers included supporters both of Gov. George W. Bush and Mr. Gore but did not identify who favored which candidate.</p>
        <p>A Gore spokesman, Jim Kennedy, said the 1995 agreement helped safeguard American security, that it was publicly announced and that Congress was briefed on it. ''Inaccurate complaints about it, only now, 14 days before the election, speaks for itself,'' he added.</p>

        <p>THE STATES</p>
        <p>PRAISE FOR GOVERNOR'S WIDOW -- The new governor of Missouri, Roger Wilson, said yesterday that he would be willing to appoint Jean Carnahan, the widow of Gov. Mel Carnahan, as senator should the late governor receive more votes than Senator John Ashcroft in the Nov. 7 election.</p>
        <p>Mr. Carnahan, a Democrat, was killed last week in a plane crash while campaigning to unseat Mr. Ashcroft, a Republican. But voters will find his name still on the ballot on Election Day because his death occurred after the deadline for inserting substitutes.</p>
        <p>After the crash, many Missouri Democrats began urging Mr. Wilson, himself a Democrat and Mr. Carnahan's lieutenant governor, to state his willingness to appoint Mrs. Carnahan to serve should her husband end up winning. Mr. Wilson had high praise for Mrs. Carnahan but said he was unsure where she stood on serving because she had indicated that holding public office ''was certainly not a decision she was ready to make at this time.''</p>
