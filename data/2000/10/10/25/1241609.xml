        <p>I HAVE some new friends. Well, not friends exactly. I wouldn't recognize them if we bumped into each other, and I don't even know their real names. But they are always there when I need them -- to play games.</p>
        <p>There's Sooner, a student in Oklahoma who plays bingo when she should be writing papers, and Betsiew, a military wife in Germany whose daughter was hurt on the seesaw recently. There's Tdreed, who whipped me in Jeopardy, and Maacret and McWhite17, friendly and forgiving Spades opponents.</p>
        <p>I used to dismiss computer games as shoot'em-up arcade fare or fantasy worlds populated by evil aliens and exploding spaceships. But it turns out there is a world of people online who are playing old-fashioned family games like checkers, bridge and backgammon. Whole communities have sprung up around these virtual card parlors and bingo halls, where you can find a game -- and a conversation -- 24 hours a day.</p>
        <p>There are dozens of sites where game players can hook up with one another to play everything from chess to Jeopardy.</p>
        <p>''Many people would tell you the reason they don't play as much in the real world is the pace of life,'' said Garth Choutreau, a spokesman for the Pogo.com game site. ''It's just so hard to get four people around the kitchen table to play bridge, for example. At any given time on Pogo there are at least 1,000 people playing bridge.''</p>
        <p>More than 13 million people -- a whopping 25 percent of United States homes that are online -- play games on the Web at least once a month, said Jeremy Schwartz, a senior analyst at Forrester Research Inc. in Cambridge, Mass. And unlike traditional computer games, which are played mostly by young men, leisure games draw women and men in about equal numbers across a broad range of age groups. The number of players is expected to swell as new technologies like broadband and cellular phones and other hand-held devices with Internet access allow people to get online more easily and stay on longer.</p>
        <p>In terms of ''stickiness,'' or how long people stay at a Web site, games are some of the most popular online destinations. The average visitor to Bingo.com spent eight and a half hours at the site during August, according to Nielsen/Net Ratings. The average visitor to eBay, by contrast, spent less than two hours.</p>
        <p>In terms of numbers, the most popular game sites are lottery and sweepstakes sites, like  Speedyclick.com and Freelotto .com, which give away cash or prizes. In its first operating year, the sweepstakes portal site iWon, where users earn sweepstakes entries by doing almost anything -- from clicking on an advertisement to checking the weather -- became one of the 10 most popular sites on the Web over all, with close to two million visitors a day.</p>
        <p>Online game sites took in more than $100 million in advertising and subscription fees in 1999 and are expected to have revenue of more than $200 million this year, according to Jupiter Communications, the Internet research firm in New York. Jupiter projects that amount will grow to almost $770 million annually by 2003.</p>
        <p>Advertising is still the top moneymaker in the games sector, but big off-line game makers are getting into the act with multilayered sites like Electronic Arts Inc.'s www.ea.com, which try to entice users to play pay-per-game or subscription-based games and buy console games, said Billy Pidgeon, an analyst at Jupiter. Internet portals are also acquiring game sites in an effort to attract and hold onto large audiences. Lycos bought Gamesville.com last fall and Excite@Home snapped up Pogo.com in August. The business model for a successful games site is still evolving, Mr. Pidgeon said, but he predicted it would grow harder for independent sites to survive unless they found a niche.</p>
        <p>For my first venture into online game-playing, I headed for bingo. I had not played since grade school, but I had fond memories of those little boards and colored markers. Bingo was unthreatening; no one else had to know how well or badly I was playing. Bingo also lends itself to chat, because you don't have to think about your next move.</p>
        <p>After signing in at Pogo.com's bingo site, I chose to play with other 30-somethings. (Pogo also has rooms with themes like movies, music and politics, as well as rooms for ''uncensored chat.'') Each player receives three boards at once; numbers appear at the top of the screen and are called out loud. Winners receive tickets for a $50 prize drawing.</p>
        <p>A stream of chat runs down one side of the screen next to the game. Most of it is players greeting each other -- ''Hi River,'' ''Hi Lori,'' ''Hi Room,'' and cheering one another on -- ''Go Mindy,'' ''Go Room.''</p>
        <p>At the start of each game, the chat box fills with choruses of ''gle'' (good luck everyone) and ''gla'' (good luck all). Later in the game, players post cryptic messages like ''5tg'' (five numbers to go) and ''4tgX2'' (four numbers on two boards). When someone wins, everyone cheers ''wtg'' (way to go).</p>
        <p>Occasionally, a glimpse of someone's real life pokes through.</p>
        <p>''Brb'' (be right back), Spiritpa said during one game. ''Have to take clothes out of dryer.''</p>
        <p>From the relatively staid Pogo site I headed to Bingo.com, where the graphics are purple and orange, and I was bombarded with pop-up ads and promotions for events like lunch-hour tournaments and tarot readings. Bingo .com goes out of its way to make new players feel welcome -- there is a guide to chat lingo and suggested chat topics for breaking the ice. (Reflecting the site's 67 to 33 female-to-male ratio, one recent topic was ''Is your husband a football couch potato?'') At Bingo.com's Cupid area, decorated with hot pink and purple hearts, someone asked, ''Anyone from Indiana?'' and suddenly everyone was talking -- ''Maine,'' ''Pa,'' ''NJ,'' ''Ky here,'' ''Ill here.'' Dotty6 was from Georgia and, small world, Wilma 37 was going to Georgia on vacation.</p>
        <p>Game chat tends to be superficial, to put it mildly. Sometimes an hour can pass with nothing more personal than a ''wtg.'' And socializing online has its own peculiar hazards, including game sites' tendency to freeze at inopportune moments.</p>
        <p>But then there was the game where worried players tried to figure out how to contact a regular who had not shown up in several days. And the time Betsiew's 4-year-old daughter was hurt on the seesaw and all of us at her bingo table spent the next hour debating whether she should go to the doctor. (She did, finally.) I do not know Betsiew's real name, but I have shared a little piece of her life, and we both play games.  Friendships have been built on less.</p>
        <p>Sara Schwab of West Coxsackie, N.Y., said she is at the same place every morning on Bingo.com, where her screen name is Sarasue351, and sees the same people logged on. ''I say, 'gm friends,' and they say 'Good morning Sara,' 'Good morning Sara,' 'Good morning Sara,' '' she said. A player in Canada e-mailed her a cake recipe, and Mrs. Schwab has corresponded with her ever since.</p>
        <p>Not all game sites are as conducive to community-building, but they still can be a lot of fun. At Sony Online Entertainment's site, www.station.sony.com, I tried out the multiplayer test version of Jeopardy.</p>
        <p>UNLIKE bingo, which had ads for decidedly adult-looking casino sites, Jeopardy featured ads for table saws from Sears, Lands' End and J. C. Penney. It took a few minutes for the game to load, and then I was joined by two other players, Tdreed and Dazed2000, and we were off.</p>
        <p>Tdreed jumped out to a 2,000-point lead, cleaning up in the football category. When the category changed to literary quotes, I made my move, correctly identifying Anne Tyler as the author of ''Breathing Lessons.'' (Online Jeopardy is multiple choice, which makes it much easier than the TV version.)  In the second round I racked up 1,000 points by correctly stating the number of electrons in helium (two) and defining metal fatigue, then lost it all in Final Jeopardy by failing to name Radio City Music Hall as the theater where Martha Graham and the Flying Wallendas both played on opening night.</p>
        <p>Jeopardy does not have a chat screen, but you can send short messages that show up  over your icon's head. Given the pace of the game, there isn't really time for more.</p>
        <p>Hasbro's Games.com is scheduled to go online in December with multiplayer versions of Monopoly, Scrabble, Risk, Boggle, Battleship and Clue. Laura Tomasetti, a spokeswoman, said the site would offer a 10-minute version of Monopoly.</p>
        <p>My husband, son and I recently spent a week in the Adirondacks in a cabin with no telephone. We were there with my parents and my brother's family -- game aficionados all -- and a stack of board games from home. But the children stayed up late and the adults were tired; the week went by and the game boxes stayed unopened.</p>
        <p>Vacation is over now; the phone is connected. It's time to play some games.</p>
