        <p>Jets Coach Al Groh went ballistic at halftime, throwing things in the locker room. A furious center Kevin Mawae blistered his offense on the sideline during the second quarter.</p>
        <p>But nothing that was said or hurled did as much to ignite the Jets' stunning comeback from 23 points down against the Dolphins in the fourth quarter Monday night as a switch in the game plan at the start of the fourth quarter.</p>
        <p>The offensive strategy that produced 30 fourth-quarter points -- 14 more points than the Miami defense had yielded in a game all season -- and then led to the overtime victory was deceptively simple: go to the spread offense to capitalize on the Jets' abundance of speedy players who create mismatches with defenses, and let quarterback Vinny Testaverde call the plays on the field rather than taking signals from the sideline.</p>
        <p>The result was staggering: a 40-37 victory that tied for the second-biggest fourth-quarter comeback in league history in the longest game in ''Monday Night Football'' history, at 4 hours 10 minutes. The Jets lead the American Football Conference East with a 4-0 division record and are 6-1 over all. The victory over the Dolphins also cemented their reputation for extraordinary mental toughness and dispelled any doubt about Testaverde's ability to direct an offense.</p>
        <p>Throwing mostly underneath the Miami defense, Testaverde completed 18 of 25 passes for 236 yards and 4 touchdowns in the fourth quarter. In overtime, Testaverde was 3 of 5 for 41 yards. Compare that with his dismal numbers in the first three quarters: 15 of 29 for 101 yards, a touchdown and 3 interceptions.</p>
        <p>Testaverde's quarterback rating is 71.6 and he has completed 53.8 percent of his passes over all. But the Jets have won four games with fourth-quarter comebacks, largely because Testaverde has completed 67.6 percent of his passes in the final quarter. His rating for the fourth quarter is an astonishing 129.6, second only to Daunte Culpepper of Minnesota, the only undefeated team in the National Football League.</p>
        <p>If Testaverde was not actually diagramming plays in the dirt, then he had a level of autonomy in the fourth quarter that he does not usually possess. Testaverde, like all Jets quarterbacks, wears a wristband on which the plays are written, a quarterback's cheat sheet. But, under normal conditions, the plays are shuttled in from the sideline, where they are received from the offensive coordinator Dan Henning, who sits in the press box.</p>
        <p>Time, though, was at a premium. The Jets went with what had worked before, loading up on offensive weapons, emptying the backfield and sometimes lining up five players wide as receivers, including running backs Curtis Martin and Richie Anderson, the team's leading receivers. If the matchup is not favorable, the Jets can shift Martin and Anderson back for a running play.</p>
        <p>''The games we've come back and won late in the game like this, teams seems to be a little confused by it,'' Testaverde said. ''It's hard for a defense to prepare for a regular game plan and then to go to this.''</p>
        <p>In the first drive of the fourth quarter, Testaverde completed a 30-yard touchdown pass to Laveranues Coles. The 2-point conversion failed, and the Jets trailed, 30-13.</p>
        <p>On the next drive, Testaverde completed two passes to Anderson, ran for 7 yards, completed a 21-yard pass to Wayne Chrebet (who had 6 receptions for 104 yards and 2 touchdowns), completed another pass to Anderson and then, a 1-yard touchdown pass to tight end Jermaine Wiggins, who scored the first touchdown of his career.</p>
        <p>Dolphins 30, Jets 20.</p>
        <p>''Obviously, the no-huddle certainly did help us,'' Groh said. ''We were able to establish a rhythm in it.''</p>
        <p>''We played two games today,'' Chrebet said. ''We were wondering what could we do, and the next thing we know we're flying around and putting points on the board.''</p>
        <p>When the Jets traded Keyshawn Johnson, Groh made it clear that no one player would make up for all the receptions he had. That responsibility would be spread out, and Martin, for one, spent extra time in the off-season working on his receiving skills. Martin has 31 receptions for 214 yards. Anderson is the leading receiver, with 36 receptions for 339 yards.</p>
        <p>The Dolphins added to their own fourth-quarter self-destruction with three penalties for defensive holding, one for illegal contact, another for having 12 men on the field and another for unnecessary roughness.</p>
        <p>Trailing by 30-20, the Jets began their next drive at Miami's 44, but settled for John Hall's 34-yard field goal.</p>
        <p>Then Bryan Cox pinned the Dolphins at the 6 with a third-down sack of quarterback Jay Fiedler. The Jets began the next drive on Miami's 39 with 4:28 remaining. After two plays -- a 15-yard pass to Martin and an incomplete pass -- Chrebet scored on a diving catch. The score was tied, 30-30, after 23 unanswered Jets points in less than 10 minutes.</p>
        <p>After the Dolphins scored on their first play of the next drive to lead by 37-30, the Jets got the ball back on their 43 with 3:33 remaining. Martin caught a 9-yard pass and then an 11-yarder. Anderson caught one for 19 yards, and soon afterward the Jets faced fourth and 1 from the 4. Anderson caught a 2-yard pass and held on while being walloped by two defenders. Martin was stuffed. And then Jumbo Elliott, inserted as a tackle eligible, ran to the back of the end zone on a play-action fake. Elliott bobbled the ball at least three times before clutching it to his chest as he fell down. The score was tied, 37-37, and the game went to overtime.</p>
        <p>Testaverde became just the third player in league history to throw four touchdown passes in the fourth quarter. The others were Ken Stabler and Joe Montana.</p>
        <p>The Dolphins got a break when they won the toss but then Marcus Coleman intercepted Fielder, only to fumble it away. But Coleman picked off Fiedler again and the Jets had the ball at their own 34. Off they went. An incomplete pass, a 7-yarder to Martin, a 28-yarder to Chrebet, a 6-yarder to Anderson, another incomplete pass and a 2-yard run by Martin brought Hall into the game. His 40-yard kick was good and the Jets had won. Eight players had caught at least one pass, and Anderson -- a guy without a clearly defined position -- had 12 of the receptions.</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>Right guard RANDY THOMAS was carted out of the stadium with what looked like an injured right ankle, but Coach AL GROH said he was probably just sore. Groh is not optimistic about getting linebacker JOHN ABRAHAM (abdominal pull) back for Sunday's game at Buffalo against the Bills.</p>
