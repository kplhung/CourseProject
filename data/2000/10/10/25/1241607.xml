        <p>INSTEAD of coming home to find a note from the deliveryman, downtown workers in this bustling city can pick up their parcels at a ''depot'' near subways and commuter concourses, courtesy of Empori.com, a start-up that merges the role of concierge with the convenience of the Web.</p>
        <p>Merchants, of course, have offered personal services to their best customers for generations -- from free delivery to notice of special promotions. Now all consumers are starting to take such treatment for granted.</p>
        <p>Online merchants and their brick-and-mortar rivals have seized on that trend. Seeking a competitive advantage, they are increasingly focusing on personal service, enhanced by the Internet, to win customers' loyalty. For online merchants, it can mean combining a physical component with their business. For other companies, even in hands-on industries like auto repair and dry cleaning, it can mean integrating Web and e-mail functions into the operations. That is, adding services to their services.</p>
        <p>Empori.com is a good example. The company is a spinoff of Oxford Properties Group, a Canadian office developer, which was seeking a new tenant amenity. Many buildings and companies offer concierge services, said David Bowden, Empori's managing director, but Empori.com uses the Internet to extend the relationship from buyer to seller through a new type of middleman.</p>
        <p>For example, Empori customers, who  join the service on the Internet, can order and pay for books, prescriptions, office supplies and other goods online from participating merchants. These merchants then deliver the orders to an Empori.com depot, where they are stored in lockers. When the order is complete, the buyer receives an e-mail message with a locker number and a code to unlock the door.</p>
        <p>For merchants, who give Empori a percentage of each sale, the service lowers delivery costs by meeting buyers halfway between the storefront and the homefront. It allows buyers to make free returns, which can be collected by Empori staff members and shipped back, Mr. Bowden said. Indeed, Empori.com workers become extensions of the merchants' customer service desk.</p>
        <p>''This started as a way to provide better value services to tenants in the buildings and their employees,'' Mr. Bowden said. ''But restricting it to the occupants of one address was not enough. The Internet is all about 'What you want, when you want it and how you want it.' This is a way to fix the problem with fulfillment.''</p>
        <p>Crescent Real Estate Equities, a United States office developer, plans to introduce the drop-off concept in some Texas cities (names yet to be announced), and Mr. Bowden envisions a drive-through model or depots at busy places like hospitals or universities. The idea is not new, but the ways of reaching the customer are.</p>
        <p>And ever-rising customer expectations are demanding that there be a single provider of everything from groceries to dry cleaning, videos and snacks, said Christopher M. Kelley, an analyst at Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass.</p>
        <p>''Time-saving convenience is what consumers come back to again and again as the biggest benefit,'' he said. ''But how can these companies offer so many options and still make money as they turn to proactive service? The line is becoming blurred between products and services.''</p>
        <p>The desire for personal assistance has prompted some companies to use the Internet and e-mail messages to improve customer service.</p>
        <p>At JoeAuto.com, an auto repair company in Houston, customers can monitor repairs on their cars by watching a digital camera on the Web or, when they drop off their vehicle, borrow a cellular phone to discuss and approve repairs with the mechanics.</p>
        <p>The Simon Property Group, a developer of shopping malls, is working with Found Inc. to integrate clicks with bricks-and-mortar entities. Customers can check inventory in local stores and order online, but they must pick up and pay for their purchases at the store. Some merchants use the data they collect from these online transactions to balance seasonal spikes, promote off-season special offers by e-mail message or remind customers that it is time to clean the gutters. In return, Web-educated consumers demand more of wired merchants.</p>
        <p>Increasingly, consumers are doing so through the keyboard. A survey by Forrester last year found that 37 percent of all online buyers had requested customer service online. And given their choice of phone, in person, fax and mail, 70 percent of online buyers who sought customer service reported they used only one method during their last interaction: 71 percent of those people turned to e-mail and 51 percent used the phone.</p>
        <p>''Retailers think of using customer service to resolve consumers' post-purchase problems,'' Mr. Kelley of Forrester said. ''However, online shoppers expect Web stores to provide customer service from the moment they log on until the product is delivered.''</p>
        <p>Another business tailored for the new economy is Zoots -- a three-year-old dry-cleaning venture begun outside Boston by Thomas Stemberg, who created Staples, the office-products giant. Using keycards to enter secured portions of retail stores, customers can have 24-hour access to drop off or pick up clothes. They can schedule home pickup and delivery and even change ''light starch'' to ''no starch'' online through a password-protected customer profile, said Todd Krasnow, the chief executive of Zoots, which has 36 stores in 9 states.</p>
        <p>Sales have grown to $30 million this year from $6 million last year -- and the company has expanded into tailoring, shoe repair and even private-label dry cleaning for companies that want to offer it to employees.</p>
        <p>''We found customers wanted more service from us, so we started offering pickup and delivery,'' Mr. Krasnow said. ''People sent us e-mails, and now we're working on other enhancements. The Internet is great for instant feedback, and we get lots of feedback that helps us improve what we offer.''</p>
        <p>For many customers, e-mail message is the fastest way to relay compliments or complaints, he said. But companies need to be aware of what their customers want, instead of offering online services that executives think customers want. For instance, Mr. Krasnow said, Zoots could have posted an online guide to fabric care and stain removal, but no one has asked for it.</p>
        <p>At the Thistle Dew Inn, a bed-and-breakfast in Sonoma, Calif., Internet service has caused a collision between the old and the new.</p>
        <p>When Larry Barnett opened the inn in 1990, he sought a throwback to the Arts and Crafts era, when the business's two buildings were first built. There are period furnishings and no television sets, but after years of requests for some high-tech accouterments, he relented and installed phones with data ports and voice mail.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barnett has also started a Web site with a rate card that lets Internet users check for vacancies, and he estimates that 85 percent of this year's reservations will be made online. In addition, guests can take virtual tours of the six rooms.</p>
        <p>In the past, arriving guests compared the rooms they found to the images they remembered from a brochure. That has changed, too.</p>
        <p>''Many folks arrive at our door, walk inside and comment, 'Wow, it looks just like the Web site,' '' Mr. Barnett said.</p>
