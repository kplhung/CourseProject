        <p>THE vines, bereft now of their grapes, are turning red, gold and russet, and the brisk autumn air is spiced with the bouquet of new wine. ''A Medieval City,'' say the placards on the town hall, and indeed in this sleepy wine center 30 miles east of Bordeaux, little seems to have changed in five centuries.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, there is a revolution going on here, a wine revolution that has shaken the foundations of the most important region in France. And like all revolutions, it began with a small group of people with the audacity to question the way things were always done. The group bears the unlikely name of ''garagistes,'' a label manufactured for people who make wine in garages. None of them actually do, but insofar as the name sets them apart as iconoclasts, it is accurate.</p>
        <p>Simply stated, the garagistes make exceptionally good wines in exceptionally small quantities and sell them for exceptionally high prices. The wines are called vins de garage, or garage wines, and the most prized are selling for more than Petrus.</p>
        <p>There are at least a dozen made here in St.-Emilion, but garage wines are now also cropping up in the Medoc, the most traditional of all the Bordeaux regions; in the Graves, south of the city of Bordeaux; and in Italy and Spain. Buyers, often on the Internet, are fighting to spend as much as $1,000 a bottle for wine that, in some instances, no one ever heard of before.</p>
        <p>And now the whole wine world is caught up in a swirling controversy: are these great modern wines made by people willing to break the mold, or are they overhyped trophies for the moneyed collector?</p>
        <p>The original garage wine comes from Pomerol, the wine commune adjacent to St.-Emilion and the home of Petrus, until recently the rarest and most expensive of all Bordeaux wines. It is called Le Pin, which means the Pine Tree. Its entire vineyard is only about five acres, and it rarely produces more than 600 cases of wine a year. The wine cellar is in a battered old farmhouse on the plateau of Pomerol, less than a mile from Petrus.</p>
        <p>Like many of these ''new'' winemakers, Le Pin is owned by a family with deep roots in the wine business: the Thienponts, Belgians who owned chateaus in Bordeaux since the 1920's. Their best-known property is Vieux Chateau Certan, which adjoins Le Pin. When the Thienponts bought the tiny plot that became Le Pin in 1979, they planned merely to extend the Vieux Chateau Certan vineyards.</p>
        <p>''When we realized that Le Pin soil was very special, we decided to keep it separate,'' Jacques Thienpont said. ''So we created Le Pin.''</p>
        <p>In 1985, the Thienponts acquired another, adjoining hectare -- 2.5 acres -- from the local blacksmith. In the early 80's, word began to spread that an astonishingly good Pomerol was being made from a tiny vineyard just down the road from Petrus, and with the 1981 vintage Le Pin began to take on cult status.</p>
        <p>When its wine began to surpass Petrus in important tastings, it became the hottest property in Bordeaux -- in France, some would say.</p>
        <p>Other winemakers took notice. By the mid-90's, almost a dozen new wines had appeared, all of them made in Le Pin style -- rich, full bodied and packed with flavor --  all made in extremely small quantities and most of them made here in St.-Emilion, next door to Pomerol.</p>
        <p>Since a number of these new wines were produced, not in great chateaus but in modest digs similar to Le Pin, a French writer, Nicholas Baby, dubbed them ''vins de garage'' and the people who make them ''garagistes.'' Fiona Thienpont, who runs Le Pin with her husband, Jacques, bridles at the name.</p>
        <p>''We are not garagistes,'' she said. ''We were making wine here a dozen years before anyone thought up the name.''</p>
        <p>I found hardly any other garagiste who was happy with the title. And in fact, there is nothing casual or make do about these microcuvees. The formula is simple: small quantities of the best grapes; severe selection, which means cutting away excess bunches during the growing season and retaining only about half of the harvested grapes; new oak barrels every year; and hands-on care up to and including the bottling.</p>
        <p>Among the best-known garagistes here in what is known as Bordeaux's Right Bank (of the Garonne River) are Valandraud, La Mondotte, La Gomerie, Barde-Haut, Pavie Macquin, Gracia, Grand Murailles and Tertre Roteboeuf, all of them in St.-Emilion. In the Medoc, the home of the greatest Bordeaux chateaus, a newcomer named Marojallia, from the commune of Margaux, is priced even above Chateau Margaux itself.</p>
        <p>In the Ribera del Duero, in northern Spain, Pingus by the Danish oenologist Peter Sisseck has created as much sensation as any St.-Emilion wine, selling in Spanish restaurants for $500 a bottle. In Italy, Palazzi from the Tenuta di Trinoro and Lambor ghini Campoleone have had the same impact.</p>
        <p>In irreverent Australia, a garage wine made from Shiraz -- syrah in the Northern Hemisphere -- is called Duck Muck. All of these wines owe some of their popularity to the success of the so-called cult wines of California, themselves mostly a phenomenon of the late 80's and early 90's. With wines from microscopically small properties like Harlan Estate, Bryant Family Vineyards, Screaming Eagle, Marcassin and Araujo sold only through mailing lists and bringing four-figure prices when they are resold, it was probably only a matter of time before winemakers elsewhere caught on to what could be done in these affluent times.</p>
        <p>St.-Emilion garage wines or California cult wines, what sets them apart from the crowd is not so much their style or their quality, which after all can vary from vintage to vintage. It is, perversely, their unavailability that makes them so desirable.</p>
        <p>Serious wine drinkers will pay a lot for the finest wines; collectors will pay that much and much more. The price for most of these wines at the cellar door, so to speak, is high but manageable. Unfortunately, the wines are all spoken for before the grapes are crushed. People have been known to offer to sell their place on a cult or garage wine list.</p>
        <p>For most of the world, the only places to go to buy these wines is the auction room or  auctions on the Internet, where they are knocked down at staggering prices. At a Sotheby's auction scheduled for Nov. 18 in New York, four bottles of the 1982 Le Pin are offered at a starting price of $5,000 to $7,000; five bottles of the 1990 at $3,000 to $4,000; and three bottles of Harlan Estate 1995 at $900 to $1,200.</p>
        <p>Will any of these wines ever be drunk? If the buyers have a chance to profit from reselling, they are not about to drink their good investment.</p>
        <p>The Thienponts insist they had no idea that Le Pin would take off as it did, and their original prices were moderate by Bordeaux standards. In the early 80's it was possible to find a case of Le Pin for $450. Today, at auction, which is the only place the wine ever comes to market, a single bottle can sell for $600 or more.</p>
        <p>The next of these wines to make an international reputation was Valandraud, which  Jean-Luc Thunevin makes in a beautiful little winery -- it may once have really been a garage -- hidden away in a narrow cobbled street in the center of old St.-Emilion. Valandraud first appeared in 1991. Tall, diffident, with a quiet sense of humor, Mr. Thunevin comes from an old Bordeaux wine family. It is his wife who makes the Margaux garage wine Marojallia.</p>
        <p>La Mondotte, which became a garage wine in 1996, is made by Count Stephan von Neipperg at one of his other properties, Chateau Canon-La-Gaffeliere, also in St.-Emilion. Like many of these hot new wines, La Mondotte is not new at all. It appears in records dating back to the middle of the 19th century and may well have existed for a century before that. It had fallen into disrepair when the von Neippergs bought it in 1971.</p>
        <p>''La Mondotte was listed in an 1868 directory of chateaus,'' the count said. ''Originally, I thought of adding its production to Canon-La-Gaffeliere. Only when the authorities turned me down did I decide to develop it separately. I'm very glad I did.''</p>
        <p>The von Neippergs, who also own Chateau Peyreau and Chateau Aiguilhe in St.-Emilion, trace their history as part of the Franconian nobility back to the 12th century. ''My family has been making wine for 800 years,'' Count von Neipperg said.</p>
        <p>Chateau Barde-Haut is another ''new'' wine that has been around for a long time. In fact, its present owners, the Garcin-Cathiard family, have owned it only since the middle of September. Its previous owner, having developed the property along garagiste lines, found himself in trouble with French tax inspectors, sold off his holdings, including Barde-Haut, and moved to Monaco. The Garcin-Cathiards, originally from Grenoble, also own Clos l'Eglise in Pomerol, Haut-Bergey in the Pessac-Leognan part of the Graves and considerable vineyard acreage in Argentina. A brother, Daniel Cathiard, owns Chateau Smith-Haut-Lafitte, also in the Graves, which is becoming as well known for its beauty spa as for its wines. Barde-Haut is a small chateau but a particularly beautiful one.</p>
        <p>Helene Garcin Leveque, a daughter of the Garcin-Cathiards, is charged with running Barde-Haut. She and her husband, Patrice Leveque, who also comes from a chateau-owning family, are developing yet another garage wine on a tiny plot his family has in the Graves.</p>
        <p>La Gomerie, also in St.-Emilion, emerged as a garage wine in the mid-90's. Once the private vineyard of an abbey, La Gomerie is owned by Gerard and Dominique Becot who also own the adjoining Chateau Beau-Sejour  Becot. La Gomerie is said to be the Becots'  attempt to make one of the best of all St.-Emilion wines.</p>
        <p>Not unexpectedly, in a hidebound region like Bordeaux, the garage wines have provoked considerable controversy. Partly it involves the people who make them, who are often seen as newcomers, insensitive to Bordeaux's tradition of making subtle, less forward, complex wines. Partly it involves the oenologist Michel Rolland, a longtime advocate of big-bodied, flamboyant wines, who has been a driving force behind many of these new labels, and partly it is a reaction to the powerful American critic Robert M. Parker Jr., who has been effusive in his praise of the garage wines and of Mr. Rolland, seemingly at the expense of the Bordeaux establishment and the great names it reveres: Lafite, Mouton, Ausone, Margaux and others.</p>
        <p>Bordeaux traditionalists maintain that these new wines have no track record. Bordeaux styles, they say, have developed over two and a half centuries and have made Bordeaux wines the standard for the whole world of wine. Who knows, they ask, how well these new wines will develop, how long they will last? Of course, no one knows. At the same time, the wines are immensely attractive, which should be reason enough to welcome them.</p>
        <p>Still, it is well to note that they are not always as stupendous as they are made out to be. In comparing the 1998 La Gomerie with the 1998 Beau-Sejour Becot, I found the older house's wine clearly superior in elegance and in harmony or balance. The same was true of the Barde-Haut when compared with Clos l'Eglise, and La Mondotte with Canon-La-Gaffeliere. I thought Le Pin equal, perhaps even a bit superior to its sibling next door, Vieux Chateau Certan. But I tasted them separately, which is not as good as having them side by side. Valandraud, which I also tasted separately, was the most harmonious and perhaps a bit more subdued. A lovely wine.</p>
        <p>Wood is very prominent in the garage wines, in some cases recalling California zinfandels that seem to use oak for oak's sake. To me, the worst offender in this respect among the garage wines was the Spanish wine Pingus, which seems to have been made mostly for wine competitions:  great for vanquishing less assertive wines,  but too big, too overpowering for the dinner table, even with steak, which is the way I had it.</p>
        <p>The success of these wines will undoubtedly inspire many more. I heard of at least a dozen startups while I was in France and Italy. Some will be poor imitations, but others will be good wines in this same modern style. They should come as no surprise. Bordeaux has been coming around slowly, like a great ship in the center of a harbor, for years.</p>
        <p>At a recent tasting of 1985 and 1995 Bordeaux and California cabernets, it was easy to distinguish the 1985 Bordeaux from the 1985 cabernets. Ten years on, it was tough to tell which was which. The Bordeaux had become startlingly similar to the California wines.</p>
        <p>It is a trend that has been going on for some time. The garage wines have only made it more striking. Does it represent some globalization of taste, a McDonald's-like homogenization? Maybe. It could also signal a new generation of wine drinkers in Europe who will join Americans in discovering new wines and new styles of wine.</p>
        <p>Inevitably, competition will bring down the price of these wines. And when there are many more of them, they won't seem nearly  so impressive as they now do. Then they can be compared with the more traditional styles for taste, rather than cost.</p>
        <p>They will do well, but I don't think the great old wines of Bordeaux have much to worry about.</p>
