        <p>Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright said tonight that ''important progress'' had been made in her talks here with North Korea's leader toward persuading North Korea to ''restrain missile development and testing, as well as missile exports,'' though any final agreement will have to await further talks.</p>
        <p>Missile specialists from the United States and North Korea will meet next week to explore further the specific ways in which North Korea will limit its missile program, she said.</p>
        <p>In particular, a quid pro quo of shutting down the missile program in exchange for launchings of North Korean satellites by foreign governments will be discussed further, a senior official said.</p>
        <p>The idea was first raised in talks in July between President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and the North Korean leader.</p>
        <p>The six hours of talks between Dr. Albright and the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Il, were the first between such a high-level American official and a North Korean leader.</p>
        <p>''Everyone leaves here rather struck by the breadth and depth of the discussions,'' the senior official said. This was largely because the Americans heard firsthand from Mr. Kim, the only decision maker who counts in this country, ''what he was prepared to do.''</p>
        <p>The two-day visit ended on a cordial note. As a parting gift, Dr. Albright presented a basketball autographed by Michael Jordan to Mr. Kim, who turns out to be an ardent fan.</p>
        <p>As they said their farewells in the lobby of a government guest house tonight, Dr. Albright encouraged Mr. Kim ''to pick up the telephone any time,'' an American official said. And Mr. Kim, -- the leader of one of the few countries to deny its people Internet access but who is himself a keen Internet browser with three computers in his office -- replied, ''Please give me your e-mail address.''</p>
        <p>As a way of explaining the headway on the missile issue in the last two days, Dr. Albright said that Mr. Kim told her during an aside at a theatrical performance she attended here that North Korea does not intend to launch any more long-range missiles.</p>
        <p>On her first night here, Dr. Albright was Mr. Kim's guest at a spectacle of song and dance celebrating the strengths of the country during which the image of a Taepodong missile launch was superimposed on the wall of the stadium.</p>
        <p>''He immediately turned to me and quipped this was the first satellite launch and it would be the last,'' she said at a news conference after the two days of talks ended.</p>
        <p>In August 1998, North Korea tested a Taepodong ballistic missile over Japan and threatened to launch a second test last year. Under severe pressure from the United States, North Korea agreed to a moratorium on missile testing last year and reaffirmed it this month.</p>
        <p>The North said that its initial launch was an attempt to send up a satellite, though intelligence agencies doubted it was capable of doing so successfully.</p>
        <p>The idea of a quid pro quo on missile launches intrigued the Clinton administration, which followed it up during a recent visit by American  officials to Moscow. The senior official said the idea was a major negotiating proposal here.</p>
        <p>But among the details the Clinton administration is struggling with is the extent to which the North Koreans are prepared to abandon their missile research and development and to limit their exports of long-range missiles to such countries as Libya and Iran. In the past, North Korea has demanded large payments for halting the exports. The country has suffered from severe food shortages in recent years and has received substantial Western food aid.</p>
        <p>The American delegation made plain that the North Korean satellites -- to be launched by other countries and from sites outside North Korea -- would have to be civilian satellites, officials said. They could not be satellites used for spying or military purposes.</p>
        <p>North Korean satellites are quite small and primitive. But the very fact of having them successfully launched gives the government legitimacy with its people. One of the ideas under consideration for financing the satellite launches, which North Korea cannot afford, would be to create a consortium that would include the United States and some of its allies.</p>
        <p>As it moves ahead on the satellite launch idea as a way of solving the missile crisis between the United States and North Korea, the administration will have to consult with Congress as well as with its allies.</p>
        <p>The officials accompanying Dr. Albright, who included the State Department's most senior missile expert, Robert Einhorn, did not divulge what kind of verification mechanisms they were seeking to ensure that the government stop its missile program.</p>
        <p>One of Dr. Albright's goals on this trip was to plan for a possible visit here by President Clinton, but she declined to be drawn out on whether Mr. Clinton would come. Instead, she said she would report to Mr. Clinton on the results and it was up to him to make the decision.</p>
        <p>Another goal was to assess the North Korean leader who, in his six years in office, has remained virtually unknown as a personality or a policy maker. His father, Kim Il Sung, founded the Communist Party here and ruled the country with an iron hand until his death in 1994.</p>
        <p>Dr. Albright said that after negotiating with Mr. Kim and socializing with him at two dinners and at the performance in honor of the 55th anniversary of the North Korean Communist Party, she found him a ''very good listener, a good interlocutor.'' And she added, ''He strikes me as very decisive and very practical.''</p>
        <p>During the talks with Mr. Kim in a government guest house here, Dr. Albright said, the two officials discussed North Korea's human rights record.</p>
        <p>The annual human rights report by the State Department, based on interviews with refugees and defectors, paints a picture of a country that tolerates no dissent and allows for no religious freedom.</p>
        <p>Her chief aide on human rights, Harold H. Koh, who is of Korean descent, was part of the official delegation but did not participate in the formal sessions with Mr. Kim.</p>
        <p>''The issue of human rights was raised for the first time, and we have raised it obviously by a cabinet-level person,'' Dr. Albright said. ''I think that it's obviously a subject of concern but we have just begun our discussions on the subject. They obviously will continue.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Albright and her aides ducked questions on what Mr. Kim had to say about the possibility of reducing tensions between the North and the South on the Korean peninsula. About 37,000 American troops are based in South Korea as a deterrent to an attack from the North and its 1.1 million troops.</p>
        <p>On the possibility of each side opening liaison offices in the other's country, Dr. Albright said that while Mr. Kim was interested in having ''more informal and formal relations,'' no decision had been reached.</p>
        <p>The Koreans went out of their way to show their friendliness toward Dr. Albright and she recognized this in her news conference, saying she was shown ''exceptional hospitality'' and added that she was impressed by the ''genuine sweetness of the children.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Albright ended her visit here on a high note, holding a dinner for Mr. Kim at which she served California wines specially flown in -- a Raymond Estates Cabernet and a Morgan Monterey Chardonnay -- and a fusion menu of American roast turkey and North Korean fried pigeon.</p>
        <p>Of the propaganda spectacle extolling the virtues of 55 years of Communism in North Korea, Dr. Albright said she was fully aware of what she was watching. ''I have been a student of Communist affairs all my life and so one knows perfectly well how these performances are put together,'' she said. ''I just can assure that these glasses that I have on are not rose-colored.''</p>
