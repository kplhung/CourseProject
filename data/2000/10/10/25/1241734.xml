        <p>On the day that Bill Clinton held a White House ceremony with Jordan's king to sign a trade pact, Muhammad Nubeni and his friends paraded through the streets here today denouncing the American president.</p>
        <p>Tens of thousands of Jordanians -- most of Palestinian origin, like Mr. Nubeni -- marched toward the border with Israel, demanding an end to Jordan's diplomatic and economic relations with Israel and condemning American support for Israel.</p>
        <p>''To hell with Clinton! To hell with Barak!'' they chanted as they filed out of town, furious at the televised scenes they had watched Monday night of Israeli tanks in Jerusalem shelling nearby Palestinian villages.</p>
        <p>The marchers converged with protesters from other Jordanian cities at a point a few miles from the West Bank, and then skirmishes with the Jordanian police quickly became open battles and enveloped the crowd in billows of tear gas. Police helicopters hovered overhead and youths pelted riot squads with stones, in scenes that marchers and other witnesses said mirrored the daily clashes on the western side of the Jordan River.</p>
        <p>Scores were injured, though few seriously, said march organizers, who criticized ''the exaggerated response of the security forces.''</p>
        <p>Such a display of turmoil and anger would have been unusual in Jordan before the past month's battles between Israelis and Palestinians set off raucous demonstrations here. And by the end of the day, the protests had completely overshadowed the trade pact.</p>
        <p>The government had hoped the deal would present Jordan and its economy in an attractive light abroad, while convincing critics at home that the country was getting tangible rewards for its support of American mediation in the region.</p>
        <p>''The timing is a bit awkward,'' said Rami Khoury, a Jordanian political commentator, ''because the U.S. is now seen here to be the bad guy.'' What's at issue, he said, is the ''overpowering importance of the Palestinian issue here.''</p>
        <p>The events in Washington and on the streets of Jordan underscored the competing pressures on the Amman government as it tries to maintain ties with Israel and the West while paying allegiance to Arab nationalism and the Palestinian cause.</p>
        <p>The government recently challenged the United Nations sanctions against Iraq and played host to the Libyan leader Muammar el-Qaddafi. Both steps scored points with critics of Jordan's ties to Israel. Still, outrage at the deaths of more than a hundred Palestinians in the recent conflict in Israel and the Palestinian lands intensified public sentiment against Israel and the United States.</p>
        <p>Business leaders and diplomats praise the trade accord as a personal triumph for King Abdullah, who has ruled now for 20 months, capping an ambitious economic liberalization program that he hopes will attract investors and jobs to his country, which has few natural resources.</p>
        <p>Jordan is just the fourth country to sign a free-trade agreement with the United States, and the first Arab nation to get barrier-free access to the American market.</p>
        <p>The agreement, which is subject to Congressional approval, would put Jordan on an equal footing with Israel and with the Palestinian Authority, which enjoys duty-free access to the American market under the umbrella of the Israeli agreement.</p>
        <p>Though trade between Jordan and the United States barely exceeds $300 million a year, the potential of such a big market has great appeal to investors. Such investors are the key to providing good jobs to the young, underemployed and largely Palestinian work force.</p>
        <p>But the market potential does not overcome fears of upheaval.</p>
        <p>''Everything falls down like a house of cards when there is political instability,'' said Omar Salah. Three months ago, based largely on the pending trade accord, Mr. Salah's company was asked to start a $100 million venture with Vishay Intertechnology, an electronics manufacturer based in Pennsylvania.</p>
        <p>Last week, after watching televised scenes of demonstrations here and hearing warnings from the State Department about travel to Jordan, Vishay executives told Mr. Salah they were pulling out.</p>
        <p>''With everything that is going on, we decided to put it on hold,'' Felix Zandman, Vishay's chief executive, said in a telephone interview. ''Most of Jordan's population is Palestinian, and we weren't sure that our people would be safe there.''</p>
        <p>For the thousands of Jordanians who marched towards Israel's border today, a trade pact is at best a distant abstraction, and at worst an unwelcome symbol of Jordanian dependence on the United States.</p>
        <p>Today's march was organized by professional groups -- including the lawyers' and doctors' associations -- that have campaigned against the peace treaty with Israel that Jordan signed six years ago. They have also fiercely opposed any normalization of economic and cultural relations with a country they see as an enemy.</p>
        <p>Opponents of normalization have been gaining momentum for several years, propelled by widespread disappointment that the peace treaty failed to deliver much in economic benefits. But the government was able to portray the opposition as a movement on the wrong side of history. Not only Jordan and Egypt, but Morocco and Tunisia and Qatar and Oman were also quietly establishing trade links with Israel. So was Indonesia, the largest Muslim nation.</p>
        <p>But with the violence of the past month and the Arab League's call over the weekend for a freeze in relations with Israel, all Islamic countries except Egypt and Jordan, the two with peace agreements, have severed their tentative ties.</p>
        <p>''The most disturbing thing that has happened is that any regional cooperation or integration has practically ended,'' said Taher Masri, a former prime minister of Jordan. ''The Arab League summit effectively ended any hope of integration. And now Barak, for his own political reasons, is also shutting the door.''</p>
        <p>Jordan is also pulling back, refusing to dispatch its newly appointed ambassador to Israel and asking state employees to donate a day's salary to support the Palestinians.</p>
