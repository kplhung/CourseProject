        <p>Had Bobby Valentine wanted to use a cliche, he could have said he stayed with the people who brought him to the dance.

        <p>The Mets tied the game in the sixth, but they squandered a no-out, bases-loaded situation in the rest of the inning to put themselves in peril.

''That was tough,'' Robin Ventura said, speaking of the failure to score any more runs off Hernandez in the sixth. ''You feel like you've just gotten a blow to the stomach. It was a golden opportunity. He did a great job to get out of it. We were just fortunate to eventually punch through.''</p>

        <p>Had Bobby Valentine wanted to use a cliche, he could have said he stayed with the people who brought him to the dance. But he chose other words to explain why he didn't make some moves he could have made in the sixth inning and thus risked losing the third of three World Series games the Mets have played with the Yankees.</p>
        <p>The Mets tied the game in the sixth, but they squandered a no-out, bases-loaded situation in the rest of the inning to put themselves in peril. Still, they emerged with a 4-2 victory that ended the Yankees' record 14-game World Series winning streak and the perfect 8-0 postseason record of the Cuban wizard, Orlando Hernandez. ''That was tough,'' Robin Ventura said, speaking of the failure to score any more runs off Hernandez in the sixth. ''You feel like you've just gotten a blow to the stomach. It was a golden opportunity. He did a great job to get out of it. We were just fortunate to eventually punch through.''</p>
        <p>Did the Mets feel they would prevail eventually? ''No one says eventually,'' Ventura said. ''Eventually might be next year.''</p>
        <p>With the bases loaded and no one out, and the game now tied, 2-2, where were Valentine's left-hand hitters to bat against the right-handed Hernandez instead of the right-handers scheduled to bat? Jay Payton? He batted. Mike Bordick? He batted. Lenny Harris? He stayed in the dugout. Matt Franco? He stayed in the dugout. Darryl Hamilton? He, too, stayed put until it was the pitcher's turn to bat with two out.</p>
        <p>''I thought that was the best way to win it,'' Valentine said of his decision not to pinch-hit for Payton, who has struggled all season with the bases loaded, often appearing overanxious, or Bordick, who has hit very poorly in the postseason and also has a bruised thumb that hampers his swing. ''Keep them in. It was the sixth inning, we had a tie game. Bordick hit El Duque the best of anybody in our lineup the first two times up.''</p>
        <p>''In the sixth inning,'' Valentine continued, ''I'm not going to take out our best center fielder and I'm definitely not going to break any spirit that he has going right now in the sixth inning of this game. More important, as I told the guys on the bench in the sixth inning, I'm not going to show any panic and try to take the entire team out of the game, the team that got us there.'' Despite his thinking, Valentine's decision to keep his right-handed hitters in the game and his left-handers in the dugout could have been the proverbial nail in the Mets' World Series coffin.</p>
        <p>The manager's strategy, combined with the continued inability of Timo Perez and Edgardo Alfonzo, the first two hitters in the lineup, to perform their roles placed the Mets on a precarious perch.</p>
        <p>The Mets were trailing, 2-1, when they reached their half of the sixth at Shea Stadium. Mike Piazza led off by drilling a line drive to left field for a double, and Ventura walked. Todd Zeile, an improbable bunter (he did not have a sacrifice all season), bunted badly at Hernandez's first pitch and easily missed it.</p>
        <p>For the next pitch, Valentine came up with a better plan. Zeile swung and lined the ball into the left-field corner for another double, sending Piazza home with the tying run and Ventura to third. Benny Agbayani, the next batter, worked the count to 3-2 before drawing a walk that loaded the bases. Payton was the next scheduled batter, and the three-run home run he hit against Mariano Rivera in the ninth inning of Game 2 was still fresh in everyone's minds. But some people also were aware that Payton, during the regular season, had batted 21 times with the bases loaded and had managed to get only two hits.</p>
        <p>Valentine had Hamilton, Harris and Franco eagerly waiting to bat, but he opted to stay with the rookie Payton, who is not always a disciplined hitter. Hernandez got two quick strikes on Payton, who then fouled off a pitch and took a ball before swinging and missing at a pitch well out of the strike zone for strike three. One out, bases still loaded, score still tied, 2-2.</p>
        <p>Bordick was next. He had singled in his previous time at-bat, but that was his first hit in five World Series at-bats and only his fourth in 30 at-bats this post-season. Valentine had used a pinch-hitter for Bordick in the seventh inning of the first game and the eighth inning of the second game, but in the sixth inning of this game he did not use a pinch-hitter. Again Hamilton, Harris and Franco remained seated.</p>
        <p>Bordick took a ball and a strike, the swung and missed for a strike. A ball brought the count to 2-2, and Bordick took the next pitch for another ball, though it appeared to be extremely close to the outside corner of the plate. Jeff Kellogg's call, however, mattered not. Bordick missed Hernandez's 3-2 pitch, and the Mets had one out left.</p>
        <p>Now Valentine went to his pinch-hitting platoon. Rick Reed was the scheduled batter, but there was no way Valentine would let the pitcher bat. He called for Hamilton, and after taking a strike, Hamilton grounded to short for a force at second.</p>
        <p>The inning was over, the game remained tied and the Mets had wasted a great opportunity to take control of Game 3. But they lived nevertheless, making Valentine look good with a two-run burst in the eighth inning, one of which scored when Bubba Trammell hit a sacrifice fly while pinch-hitting for Bordick.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the Mets won in spite of Perez and Alfonzo. In the final two games of the National League series against St. Louis, the Mets scored in seven different innings and Perez was the first batter to reach base in five of the innings. But in this series, he has one hit in 13 at-bats and has triggered no scoring whatsoever.</p>
        <p>Alfonzo had established himself as a batter who produces critical postseason runs, but in this series he has two hits in 13 at-bats, getting only one hit in seven at-bats with a total of 10 runners on base.</p>
        <p>But despite everything, the Mets have insured that they will play two more games at their home park and that Valentine will get some more interesting decisions to make.</p>
