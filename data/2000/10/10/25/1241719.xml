        <p>Editorial endorses moderate Republican Rep Bob Franks for United States Senate in New Jersey; cites disagreement with him on some issues; prefers Jon Corzine's political philosophy, by scores his approach to campaign finance</p>

        <p>The contest for United States Senate in New Jersey poses a difficult problem for voters inclined toward candidates who want the government to take an active role in addressing social needs. The choice is between Jon Corzine, a Democrat who calls for expanded health and education programs, and Representative Bob Franks, a cautiously moderate Republican. But the issues have unfortunately been overshadowed by Mr. Corzine's extravagant personal spending on television ads and his blatant use of money to secure political endorsements. We prefer Mr. Franks, a solid lawmaker with whom we disagree on some issues, over Mr. Corzine, whose approach to campaign finance and financial disclosure is contrary to the values of this page.</p>
        <p>Mr. Franks has spent his political career espousing a moderate Republicanism that has been increasingly embattled in recent years. Along the way he has made some disturbing compromises, while maintaining a centrist policy orientation that is healthy for the G.O.P. He supports limited gun control, but is too soft on background checks at gun shows. He favors abortion rights, but has supported several measures that would limit full freedom of choice. He has had a good mass transit and environmental record, but marred the latter with recent votes including one that favored developers. He voted for the excessive Republican budget cuts in 1995, but has recently been a champion of more federal spending in important areas, including the arts, children's health and special education.</p>

        <p>The contest for United States Senate in New Jersey poses a difficult problem for voters inclined toward candidates who want the government to take an active role in addressing social needs. The choice is between Jon Corzine, a Democrat who calls for expanded health and education programs, and Representative Bob Franks, a cautiously moderate Republican. But the issues have unfortunately been overshadowed by Mr. Corzine's extravagant personal spending on television ads and his blatant use of money to secure political endorsements. We prefer Mr. Franks, a solid lawmaker with whom we disagree on some issues, over Mr. Corzine, whose approach to campaign finance and financial disclosure is contrary to the values of this page.</p>
        <p>Mr. Franks has spent his political career espousing a moderate Republicanism that has been increasingly embattled in recent years. Along the way he has made some disturbing compromises, while maintaining a centrist policy orientation that is healthy for the G.O.P. He supports limited gun control, but is too soft on background checks at gun shows. He favors abortion rights, but has supported several measures that would limit full freedom of choice. He has had a good mass transit and environmental record, but marred the latter with recent votes including one that favored developers. He voted for the excessive Republican budget cuts in 1995, but has recently been a champion of more federal spending in important areas, including the arts, children's health and special education.</p>
        <p>In the foreign policy sphere, Mr. Franks has been less than clear on his views on peacekeeping missions overseas and ratification of the nuclear test ban treaty. But he has promised to serve as an independent member of the Republican team in the Senate, and there is important evidence to support the sincerity of that promise. He stood up to the G.O.P. leadership and twice voted for the Shays-Meehan campaign finance reform bill. We support him with the expectation that he will be increasingly sensitive to the need for Northeastern Republicans to pull their party toward the center.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine would vote as a commendably compassionate liberal, but he has no policy record and has not labored to master details about the costs and administration of his ambitious proposals on health care. While saying when pressed that he would support campaign finance reform, he has been tone-deaf to the need to restrain his own spending and the outsized role of money in the electoral process. He was recruited to run for the seat held by the retiring Senator Frank Lautenberg by Democrats eager for someone they thought could finance his own race, and Mr. Corzine did that in a way that recalled the abuses of old-time machine politics. In the primary season, Mr. Corzine's campaign doled out over $650,000 to political candidates and party committees across New Jersey.</p>
        <p>This flagrant use of personal wealth to solicit support figured in our endorsement of the former New Jersey governor, Jim Florio. Last month it was revealed that Mr. Corzine's family foundation had given $25,000 to a church whose minister helped secure the endorsement of the Black Ministers Council of New Jersey. Mr. Corzine initially did not acknowledge the gift and insists to this day -- without credibility, in our view -- that politics was not involved. Although the amount was small, the echoes of the discredited practices of street money and secret quid-pro-quo financial deals are too disturbing to ignore.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine seems to believe that if a spending practice is strictly legal, that is all that matters. But this era calls for senators who are sensitive to issues of fair campaigns, conflicts of interest and  financial transparency. By spending more than $50 million on his campaign, Mr. Corzine effectively smothered the ability of Mr. Florio and later Mr. Franks to get their messages out. As Election Day nears, Mr. Franks has been pummeled with negative, misleading campaign ads that he does not have the money to answer.</p>
        <p>At the same time, Mr. Corzine is arguing that a confidentiality agreement with Goldman Sachs, the investment firm he once headed, prevents him from telling New Jersey voters the specific sources of the money for this tidal wave of personal spending. But New Jersey's voters did not sign an agreement with Goldman Sachs, and they have a right to know how a multimillionaire candidate amassed the wealth that enables him to spend almost $2 million a week on advertising.</p>
        <p>If political philosophy were the only consideration, we would be for Mr. Corzine. But the more responsible way that Mr. Franks has conducted his campaign, in combination with an acceptably moderate record, has earned our endorsement. We believe Bob Franks is a candidate with greater experience and an unquestioned commitment to financial openness and to diminishing, by legislation and personal example, the influence of money in politics.</p>
