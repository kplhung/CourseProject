        <p>WHEN Kaiser Permanente tries to persuade members to join its online service, the health care giant likes to talk about its advice-nurse feature, which guarantees a response to questions within 24 hours.</p>
        <p>It is a popular part of the service. So when the system broke down and e-mail messages from members started to pile up last summer, Kaiser technicians worked to solve the problem, and fast.</p>
        <p>The technicians patched together a program that allowed them to start  sending e-mail messages again -- just not in a way anyone had intended. More than 850 messages were sent to 17 people -- none the intended recipients -- some containing personal medical information.</p>
        <p>Kaiser, which has drawn 250,000 members to its online service, is considered part of the vanguard when it comes to taking medicine into the digital age, and its patients appear happy with the service. And evidence nationwide suggests there is broad enthusiasm among patients and, for the most part, doctors, for the growing practice of using the Internet for everything from scheduling appointments and renewing prescriptions to obtaining personalized advice and test results. Medical providers like Kaiser are also moving quickly toward the day when each patient will have a page on the company's Web site containing medical history and links to sources of information.</p>
        <p>But the e-mail incident suggests that however popular the marriage between medicine and online technology may become, when it comes to safeguarding patient privacy, the happy couple still has some work to do.</p>
        <p>''Right now, if I have a paper record in my office, then for someone to get that without permission, they have to break in,'' said Dr. Donald J. Palmisano, a New Orleans surgeon who sits on the American Medical Association's privacy and confidentiality task force.</p>
        <p>But if patients begin to fear that personal information is no longer secure -- that anyone from potential employers to the simply curious could read it -- their doctors' ability to treat them could suffer.</p>
        <p>''The patient-physician relationships is based in trust, and confidentiality of communications within that relationship is a cornerstone of good medical care,'' Dr. Palmisano said. ''So that if the patient does not have confidence that information given to me or any other physician will be kept confidential, the patient will not give us sometimes embarrassing information.''</p>
        <p>As has happened so often, technology has outpaced the people who may benefit from it -- or be harmed by it. Even as about half the 500,000 doctors in the United States report having a Web site (though most are little used), medical authorities are scrambling to figure out how best to use the sites and forestall potentially thorny problems.</p>
        <p>In medicine, the stakes are higher than in many other areas of life affected by the information revolution. There seems to be broad agreement that the benefits of introducing the Internet into medicine -- from convenience to the ability to help patients take better care of themselves -- far outweigh the risks. But it also raises many ethical questions, experts say.</p>
        <p>Will the relationship between patient and doctor, already strained by the pressure of managed care, become still less personal? Will those patients already ill-equipped for the world of medicine -- the millions of people sometimes referred to as the ''medically illiterate'' -- fall further by the wayside? And -- the issue most frequently raised -- with all the highly personal medical information suddenly available online, how will it be protected?</p>
        <p>The medical association has endorsed the use of online technology for doctors, joining 15 other medical societies to found a company called Medem, which has just begun creating sponsored Web sites for doctors and hopes to have 100,000 signed up within a year. (The service is free if the doctor agrees to have commercial sponsorship for the site and about $70 a month without sponsorship.) The A.M.A. is also working with Intel to create a secure-identification system for doctors and the people they communicate with, like pharmacists.</p>
        <p>There is broad agreement that protecting medical information is a priority as doctors move online. There is less agreement, however, on whom it is being protected from.</p>
        <p>While Dr. Palmisano and others say they fear electronic intrusions by hackers, Dr. Robert Pearl, who runs Kaiser's operations in Northern California, said he thought they were the least significant threat.</p>
        <p>''If they're going to hack into something,'' Dr. Pearl said, ''they'll hack into your bank account before they hack into your medical record.'' The most important threat to security, he said, is sending confidential information by e-mail message. It is far safer, he said, to make the information accessible to patients but have it remain on the organization's server.</p>
        <p>The other threat to security, Dr. Pearl said, comes from a problem that has existed before people started etching characters on stone tablets: human error. But in the past, if a doctor's receptionist gave an envelope with medical results to the wrong patient, the harm was generally minimal. In the era of so-called ''send-to-all'' mistakes, it is an entirely different matter.</p>
        <p>That was the lesson of the Kaiser e-mail problem.</p>
        <p>Still, it was the kind of mishap that may simply go with the territory when a company ventures into the unknown. And in general, Kaiser's efforts to move its service online seem well received by its patients.</p>
        <p>''For something that they just rolled out, they're doing it very well,'' said J. Kevin Rumery, who lives in Lakewood, a suburb of Denver. Mr. Rumery, 46, a supervisor for the federal volunteer program Americorps, is responsible for 17 states and is on the road often. ''I spend a lot of time online,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He has used the service to read about medical conditions, ask health advice from a nurse, make appointments with doctors and even renew prescriptions (a feature that is not yet widely available for Kaiser members). And he can do it whenever his time allows -- night or day.</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Rumery said, he has concerns about medical records being put online. ''If someone were going to put my complete medical history online, I would definitely want to have significant reassurances that we have very solid encryption, and that it is hacker-proof,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Kaiser does have a password system to help ensure that a person seeking medical advice is really a patient and, when things go right, it only sends e-mail responses to the address designated by a patient. In the future, the company plans to go a step further, keeping all communications within its Web site (patients would have to log on to read the advice).</p>
        <p>Simply keeping out people who do not belong is not the only issue, however. There remains the question of how much a patient's record he or she should be allowed to see at will, and with what guidance.</p>
        <p>Take the case of a laboratory report that shows that a patient has leukemia, Dr. Pearl said. ''The problem is, at what point do I let you see your laboratory data?'' he said. ''Do you want to go online and see that you have 50,000 white cells?''</p>
        <p>On a broader level, the A.M.A. maintains its position that while a patient has a right to a copy, the record is the property of the doctor. In the information age, however, there is debate about this.</p>
        <p>''The medical records have always been something that physicians have clutched very tightly to our chest,'' said Dr. Kate Christensen, the lead doctor for Kaiser Permanente Online. ''And now we're realizing that this information really belongs to the members.''</p>
        <p>There are other legal concerns, as well, said Dr. Edward Fotsch, the chief executive of Medem, the Web service formed by the medical societies. The company offers doctors a standardized Web site, but then lets them customize it to their needs. A pediatrician, for example, will choose information about children. And while the source for most of the information is Medem, the doctor can also choose to link to any other site on the Web.</p>
        <p>When the encryption program is available, doctors will also be able to use their sites to communicate with their patients, including having them fill out medical histories before a first visit.</p>
        <p>When malpractice insurance companies got wind of the Web sites, they immediately began wondering who would be liable if the information  became the basis of a lawsuit. Representatives of medical groups have started to meet to resolve these, and related, questions.</p>
        <p>''There's about a million different issues, and we're trying to get to the top 200,'' said Dr. Edward Fotsch, the chief executive of Medem.</p>
