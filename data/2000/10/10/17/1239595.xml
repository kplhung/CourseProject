        <p>Before the Mets won by 7-0 over St. Louis, Fred Wilpon, the team's co-owner, looked up to the threatening skies and tapped his foot on the damp grass at Shea Stadium yesterday. His team was playing host to a playoff game at its 37-year-old park, and Wilpon was dreaming of a grander stage, of a retractable roof and a field that stays dry.</p>
        <p>Wilpon said a Subway Series would help build momentum for the ballpark the Mets have longed to build in the Shea parking lot.</p>

        <p>Wilpon said a Subway Series would help build momentum for the ballpark the Mets have longed to build in the Shea parking lot.</p>
        <p>''It doesn't hurt,'' he said. ''It helps. I can't give you the numbers, but it helps.''</p>
        <p>The project has been held up for years, but Wilpon was optimistic that a new park was a ''grand possibility'' because talks had resumed over the last two months, he said.</p>
