        <p>He might have grown up to become a common laborer in his native Dominican Republic or perhaps a livery driver in New York. But opportunity always had a way of finding Bienvenido Perez.</p>
        <p>For him, it came in the 1970's in the form of a budding political party, the Dominican Liberation Party. After a childhood in which he repaired shoes to help his mother make ends meet, he joined the party as a teenager and quickly made a name for himself -- selling the party's newspaper, participating in rallies and proselytizing in the lush countryside.</p>
        <p>''For us he was an inspiration,'' said Leocadio Castillo, who recalled Mr. Perez's visits to his village of Tamboril. ''He had the kind of personality -- how would you call it? -- magnetic.''</p>
        <p>Among his admirers was a rising political star named Leonel Fernandez. The connections made on the island would pay off in the mid-1990's when Mr. Perez, who had immigrated to New York and was a porter at the Marriott Marquis hotel in Times Square, became head of the local branch of the party, known as the P.L.D., and then campaign manager for Mr. Fernandez in his run for the Dominican presidency.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Fernandez won in 1996, he did what his  predecessors had often done: reward an old friend by naming him consul general in New York.</p>
        <p>In the next three years, Mr. Perez energetically reached out to a sprawling Dominican community, speaking in schools, raising money for hurricane relief and marching in parades. In Washington Heights, Mr. Perez still has supporters.</p>
        <p>''I think of him as a wonderful human being,'' said Alida Ferreira, owner of the Caridad restaurant, at West 184th Street and Broadway, where Mr. Perez often had political gatherings. ''He always took part in community groups and organizations.''</p>
        <p>But detractors accuse Mr. Perez of exploiting that same community for his own gain.</p>
        <p>''Here's a guy who worked in a hotel, cleaning floors,'' said Viriato Sencion, an acclaimed Dominican author who works in the government of the new president, Hipolito Mejia. ''He had never handled money, but through a miracle, he entered the government and has come out a millionaire.''</p>
        <p>But in the 2000 presidential elections, the P.L.D. lost, and Mr. Perez -- who had returned to the Dominican Republic after having been removed from the consulate in January -- was blamed by some in the party for having hobbled its operations in New York by having generated negative news coverage..</p>
        <p>Mr. Perez said he remains confident about the outcome of any investigation into his management of the consulate. ''I'm completely unworried,'' he said.</p>
