        <p>It's hard to believe that the Russian pianist Evgeny Kissin is 29. The young man who walked out to greet the audience at Carnegie Hall on Saturday night seemed hardly changed from the awkward, unsmiling and bushy-haired adolescent who made his sensational American recital debut on the same stage 10 years ago.</p>
        <p>Judging from his performance on this anniversary evening, not much has changed in Mr. Kissin's playing either. He is still a pianist of staggering technical brilliance and powerful musical instincts. Steeped in the Russian Romantic tradition, he still plays with an expressive freedom that has become increasingly uncommon. On the other hand, he also retains his tendency toward expressive indulgence. It is possible to be in awe of Mr. Kissin's pianism while wishing he relied less on instinct and more on insight.</p>

        <p>It's hard to believe that the Russian pianist Evgeny Kissin is 29. The young man who walked out to greet the audience at Carnegie Hall on Saturday night seemed hardly changed from the awkward, unsmiling and bushy-haired adolescent who made his sensational American recital debut on the same stage 10 years ago.</p>
        <p>Judging from his performance on this anniversary evening, not much has changed in Mr. Kissin's playing either. He is still a pianist of staggering technical brilliance and powerful musical instincts. Steeped in the Russian Romantic tradition, he still plays with an expressive freedom that has become increasingly uncommon. On the other hand, he also retains his tendency toward expressive indulgence. It is possible to be in awe of Mr. Kissin's pianism while wishing he relied less on instinct and more on insight.</p>
        <p>In that regard, his cogent account of Beethoven's mercurial ''Tempest'' Sonata was encouraging. The special touches of a Kissin performance were all there to marvel at, especially his uncanny sense of color. And in the passage where the stormy first movement is interrupted twice by slow, painfully sad evocations of operatic recitative, Mr. Kissin allowed the poignant melodic lines to hover over a hushed backdrop of murky piano sonorities, created by some pretty fancy pedaling. But what seemed new was the restraint and clearness of purpose in his playing.</p>
        <p>Schumann's ''Carnaval'' came next, and Mr. Kissin brought vivid imagination to this fanciful suite of dances, miniatures and musical portraits of the composer's friends and colleagues. Yet in places Mr. Kissin's spontaneity seemed rather calculated.</p>
        <p>He tore through the hellbent ''Paganini'' portrait, with its impossible leaps, at a faster tempo than what would seem humanly possible; it sped by in a roar of furious sound and a frenzy of hand-blurring motion. But it surely would have been more exciting had he slowed down a bit and made the slightly askew rhythmic interplay between the two hands clearer.</p>
        <p>Brahms's Sonata No. 3 in F minor is the work of an excited and ambitious young man: you can almost hear him saying, ''I'll show the world how to write a colossal Beethoven sonata for a new Romantic age!'' Though Mr. Kissin's performance did not hide the work's structural weaknesses, his passion and brilliance kept you involved. Still, the work is not well suited to his rhapsodic temperament. And Mr. Kissin's penchant for inserting expressive pauses in the climactic moments of phrases is an interpretive mannerism that some coach or colleague should rid him of.</p>
        <p>After the Brahms, the audience, which spilled into several sections of stage seats, responded with a frenzied ovation. There were encores, of course, including a fetching rendition of a virtuosic transcription of the waltz from ''Die Fledermaus.'' This somber young artist would seem to have a mischievous streak. The audience broke into rhythmic clapping and shouted for more encores, another thing that has not changed since Mr. Kissin's first Carnegie Hall recital. But the pianist, looking pale and understandably tired, stopped at four.</p>
