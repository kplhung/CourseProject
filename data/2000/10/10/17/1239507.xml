        <p>A multimillionaire financier who commutes 40 miles by helicopter to Manhattan from his Westchester County estate here may have to find a more earthbound -- and quieter -- mode of transportation.</p>
        <p>The financier, Nelson Peltz, and his wife, Claudia, had been sued by the Town of Bedford, but they agreed to settle most of the claims just as the case was about to go to trial today.</p>
        <p>''We think in essence that this agreement, even though it doesn't settle the litigation, will effectively end the helicopter flights in the next few months,'' said Joel H. Sachs, the town's lawyer.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Sachs was claiming victory, lawyers for the Peltzes said the fight would continue on appeal. And it has already been a long and bitter fight.</p>
        <p>The town sued the couple in 1996, saying that helicopter flights from High Winds, their 130-acre estate, disturbed neighbors and violated a town zoning law banning private aircraft.</p>
        <p>Rather than rough it with an hour's ride on Metro-North Railroad, or a 50-minute drive down one of Westchester's parkways, or even a five-minute drive to Westchester County Airport, where they could board their six-seat Sikorsky without complaint, the Peltzes decided to fight the lawsuit.</p>
        <p>They contended that they had the right to fly their helicopter from the estate because the previous owner, DeWitt Wallace, the founder of Reader's Digest, had flown an airplane from a landing strip on the property.</p>
        <p>But today the Peltzes gave up most of their claims. In State Supreme Court in White Plains, their lawyer, John H. Marwell, submitted papers saying that the Peltzes would no longer challenge the constitutionality of Bedford's zoning law, or question the town's right to regulate aircraft. They also withdrew their contention that the noise from their helicopter was no worse than the noise of other aircraft flying over Bedford.</p>
        <p>One contention remains as the basis of their appeal: because the town passed its zoning law in two steps, 11 months apart, the later version amounted to an admission that the earlier version was defective, creating ''a window during which the aircraft usage of High Winds became a vested right.''</p>
        <p>In January 1983, the town prohibited any use of property that was not specifically mentioned in its existing law. Then, in December 1983, after residents grew worried about the growing popularity of privately owned helicopters in the area, the town amended its law to mention helicopters specifically. The Peltzes bought their estate for $6 million in 1986.</p>
        <p>A judge has already thrown out their contention, but if the Peltzes' appeal is upheld, they will return to press their case in Supreme Court. If they lose the appeal, they have agreed to stop flying the helicopter from the estate.</p>
        <p>''Everyone around here has complained,'' said Judith Marshall, the widow of the actor E. G. Marshall, who, until he died in 1998, had led the opposition to the Peltzes' helicopter. ''I'm happy to hear something has happened. It's an annoyance when they take off and land. If you are outside in the summer, you can't even hear yourself think.''</p>
        <p>The Peltzes will continue to fly the helicopter pending the appeal.</p>
