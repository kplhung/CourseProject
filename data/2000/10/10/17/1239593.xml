        <p>As the Mets' games have become more intense, so has speculation about the future of their manager, Bobby Valentine. And Valentine, whose contract expires in two weeks, is troubled by the talk.</p>
        <p>He has read that the Mets, now champions of the National League,  may be interested in pursuing San Francisco's Dusty Baker or Seattle's Lou Piniella. Yesterday, he learned that Cincinnati had asked for permission to speak with him about their managerial opening, and that the Mets had denied it.</p>
        <p>Asked if all that speculation had taken from his enjoyment of what should be the most exciting time of the year, Valentine said it had.</p>
        <p>''I'd like to know what level of enjoyment it is without it,'' he said about 90 minutes before the start of Game 5, which the Mets would win by 5-0 over St. Louis. ''It is what it is, and I'm enjoying it the best I can.</p>
        <p>''What can you say? The honest answer is, yes. But we're all big boys, and one thing, after being here for a few years, that I'm supposed to have learned is to put it all out, put those things out of my mind.''</p>
