        <p>What is implicit in the demands by Israel and the United States to the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, to shut down the street action in the West Bank and Gaza, is the presumption that he can turn the violence on and off.</p>
        <p>The degree of that control, however, is a matter of some debate in the Clinton administration -- especially in the current wave of deadly rioting that has swept the West Bank, Gaza, and Arab Israeli towns.</p>
        <p>''He doesn't control everything, but I believe there's more he can do,'' said the national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, before leaving Washington for the summit meeting.</p>
        <p>Mr. Arafat maintains both security forces and a militia led by a trio of men who are a generation younger, but loyal to him.</p>
        <p>Mohammed Dahlan and Jabril Rajoub, who lead the security organizations in Gaza and the West Bank respectively, and Marwan Barghouti, the chief of the armed wing of Fatah, Mr. Arafat's political movement, follow Mr. Arafat's orders and are capable of reining in disturbances to a degree, the experts say.</p>
        <p>For the last two years, Mr. Dahlan and Mr. Rajoub have been working with the Central Intelligence Agency, whose officials have led the cooperative security arrangements between Israelis and Palestinians. It is that cooperation, and even the camaraderie that has developed between the two senior Palestinian officials and American operatives, that led the administration to believe that Mr. Arafat does have real control.</p>
        <p>But the events of the last two weeks have shown that the administration's assessment of Mr. Arafat's control may have been exaggerated, senior administration officials said.</p>
        <p>After nearly eight years of peace negotiations that Palestinians felt had yielded little, the visit of the Israeli politician Ariel Sharon to a contested holy site in Jerusalem, accompanied by 1,000 armed policemen, led, by many accounts, to a genuine outpouring of pent-up frustration among the Arabs.</p>
        <p>Then, American officials say, Mr. Arafat appears to have let the rampaging roll on, apparently for his own political reasons.</p>
        <p>Now, with the violence well into its third week, Mr. Arafat may well  have less control, as continued though more sporadic violence on the West Bank today showed.</p>
        <p>''I think the administration knows he has limited power in this regard,'' said Robert Pelletreau, a former American ambassador to Egypt. ''But I think there is an effort to substitute their judgment for his because our government wants it so badly.''</p>
        <p>Experts in Israel say that the rioting has had distinct phases, each instructive about Mr. Arafat's relationship to the street and his lieutenants.</p>
        <p>The first was the immediate aftermath of Mr. Sharon's walk on the Temple Mount, known to Muslims as  Haram al Sharif, when young Palestinian rock-throwers faced off against Israeli security forces. Then, after about two days of fury, fighting units of the Fatah movement apparently moved to the forefront of the rioting.</p>
        <p>About a week ago, both Israel and Palestinian officials say, Mr. Arafat ordered the Fatah militants to take steps to reduce civilian casualties. The results were limited.</p>
        <p>Then came the killings last Thursday of two Israeli soldiers, and the retaliatory strikes by Israeli gunships into Ramallah and Gaza. That, some experts say, demonstrated the limits of the Palestinian police -- and led to the latest drive by foreign mediators to secure a truce.</p>
        <p>The Israeli newspaper Haaretz published a subsequent interview with a Palestinian policeman who said he tried to protect one of the Israeli soldiers from the mob as they crashed into the police station.</p>
        <p>''I lay down on one of the Israeli soldiers and tried to defend him with my body,'' Col. Kamel al- Sheik was quoted as saying. ''But the mob pushed forcefully toward the wall.''</p>
        <p>The officer described the killing as the Palestinian Authority's ''greatest failure'' and a ''humiliation'' of the Ramallah police force.</p>
        <p>For all intents and purposes, said Zaqaria al-Qaq, a Jerusalem-based Palestinian political analyst, Mr. Arafat does not have the control he had three weeks ago.</p>
        <p>''The street has started to have an impetus and impact of its own,'' Mr. Qaq said. ''And the more the street is in control, the more Arafat's influence erodes.''</p>
        <p>Increasingly, he added, Palestinians are questioning Mr. Arafat's ability to control completely the Fatah militia forces. ''Nobody is holding the steering wheel now,'' he said. ''The situation is very dangerous.''</p>
        <p>Edward Abington, who was formerly the United States Consul General in Jerusalem and the American official primarily responsible for dealing with Mr. Arafat, said, ''The people who head the prevention security services are very much responsive to Arafat.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Abington, who now represents the Palestinian Authority in Washington, added: ''But these people are not totally in control of the street. The police are pretty ill trained. The police start to restrain people and then they don't succeed and the Israelis shoot at the people -- I saw it many times in 1996,'' the last period of violence that followed the opening by the Israelis of an entrance to an archaeological tunnel along the Western Wall of the Old City of Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Arafat looks toward summit meeting of the Arab League in Cairo next week, the Clinton administration fears that Arab countries that have spurned him after he embraced the Iraqi leader, Saddam Hussein, during the Persian Gulf war will be ready to salute Mr. Arafat for his fresh struggles against Israel.</p>
        <p>The round of applause that is waiting for him in Cairo is probably putting the brakes on Mr. Arafat's willingness to go along with a tough security clampdown, Mr. Pelletreau said. He said Mr. Arafat is also reluctant to appear to agree to anything at the summit meeting that would be perceived by Palestinians as a ''surrender.''</p>
