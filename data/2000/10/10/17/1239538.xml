        <p>When Leon Hess owned the Jets, he would go to dinner with his trusted lieutenant, the team president Steve Gutman, after almost every home game.

        <p>When Leon Hess owned the Jets, he would go to dinner with his trusted lieutenant, the team president Steve Gutman, after almost every home game. They would trek from Giants Stadium to a trendy East Side restaurant called Lusardi's. If New York's other football team had the late game, Hess would make a request to the restaurant staff.</p>
        <p>''Would you mind giving me a Giants update every 10 minutes?'' he would say.</p>
        <p>Hess and the Giants' owner, Wellington Mara, were close friends, and each cared about how the other's team was doing. But for many in the respective organizations, the crosstown peeking went beyond that. It is only natural for two football teams in the same market to have a serious interest in each other, to watch each other from afar, to compliment, to mock, to care, and, in some ways, even to dislike. In other words, monitor every move, and judge, judge, judge.</p>
        <p>So it is no surprise that as the Giants are atop the National Football Conference East with a 5-2 record, and the Jets lead the American Football Conference East with a 5-1 mark, both franchises are keeping one eye on the playoffs and the other on what their hometown rival is doing.</p>
        <p>''I watch what they do,'' Ernie Accorsi, the Giants' general manager, said of the Jets. ''It can't be helped. They're close and they're winning. I pay attention to them more than almost any other team. We are pretty different franchises in some ways, but we're both winning games.''</p>
        <p>What did Accorsi's counterpart have to say about this topic? That in itself is one of those differences. While Accorsi is extremely accessible, Bill Parcells, the Jets' general manager, seems as bunkered down as a nuclear silo. He is not available.</p>
        <p>There could not be two more different franchises, on and off the field. They are both winning and share Giants Stadium, but that is where the similarity ends. The offenses are different. The way each team deals with the news media is different. The practice facilities are different. The lunch the teams serve is different.</p>
        <p>The Jets have one of the top five offensive players in football in running back Curtis Martin. The last time the Giants had an offensive player that scared a defensive coordinator, it was Phil Simms.</p>
        <p>The Giants are winning ugly. The Jets are winning boldly.</p>
        <p>Giants Coach Jim Fassel is more the intellectual, while Jets Coach Al Groh is more the grunt.</p>
        <p>The Jets are winning even as Wayne Chrebet has disappeared from the offense. The Giants are winning even as Amani Toomer is benched.</p>
        <p>The Jets' offense is Halle Berry. The Giants' offense lurches along like a three-legged elephant.</p>
        <p>The Giants' offensive coordinator, Sean Payton, is a rookie play caller. The Jets' offensive coordinator, Dan Henning, is a gray-haired former head coach.</p>
        <p>The Jets' defense is speedy. The Giants' defense is bulky.</p>
        <p>The Jets play in one of the best divisions in football. The Giants are in one of the worst.</p>
        <p>The Giants have a top defensive lineman in Michael Strahan at end. The Jets have not had a dominant player at that position since Mark Gastineau.</p>
        <p>The Jets have the best center in football in Kevin Mawae. The Giants have a relatively unknown player at the position in Dusty Zeigler.</p>
        <p>The Jets are sexy. The Giants are steady.</p>
        <p>The Giants' blue uniforms are nostalgic. The Jets' green outfits are hip-hop.</p>
        <p>Giants fans bring hamburgers to games for the grill. Jets fans bring lunch pails.</p>
        <p>Jets fans: ''J-E-T-S, Jets, Jets, Jets!'' Giants fans: Well, actually, they have no cheer.</p>
        <p>Mara is classy. The Giants co-owner Bob Tisch is classy and always has a warm greeting for people. The Jets' owner, Woody Johnson, is classy -- but invisible.</p>
        <p>Reporters covering the Giants are welcomed with open arms. Jets beat writers are asked to provide D.N.A. samples before entering the news media workroom.</p>
        <p>Mara is in the Hall of Fame. Parcells is on his way.</p>
        <p>The Giants have the more traditional general manager/coach hierarchy. Parcells runs the Jets practically unchecked.</p>
        <p>The Jets are on Long Island. The Giants are in New Jersey. (O.K., not much difference there.)</p>
        <p>The Giants play in a conference with the dominant St. Louis Rams. The Jets play in a conference where there is no great team.</p>
        <p>Typical quote from Fassel: ''I'll try to answer any question that I can.''</p>
        <p>Typical quote from Groh: ''No comment.'' Typical quote from Parcells: ''Don't ask.''</p>
        <p>Fassel dines with former assistants. Parcells and Bill Belichick would not share the last coconut if they were stranded on a deserted island.</p>
        <p>So the differences are there, some profound, others humorous. Some could not be more dramatic, unless one team gets to the Super Bowl this season and the other does not.</p>
