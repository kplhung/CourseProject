        <p>You could tolerate not hearing Ives's ''Concord'' Sonata too often -- oddly few pianists offer it -- if every performance were as fresh, as inviting, as cogent and as delectable in sound and gesture as Marilyn Nonken's at Miller Theater on Thursday evening.</p>
        <p>Ms. Nonken is a pianist from music's leading edge, associated with new works and with pieces whose challenges have withstood the last half century, pieces like the Barraque Sonata, which she will play at an eagerly awaited concert in a month's time, again at Miller. ''Concord,'' for her, is an old friend and a classic, and she made it sound as fluent as Schubert if, like Schubert, prone to eddies and strangenesses in the musical flow.</p>

        <p>You could tolerate not hearing Ives's ''Concord'' Sonata too often -- oddly few pianists offer it -- if every performance were as fresh, as inviting, as cogent and as delectable in sound and gesture as Marilyn Nonken's at Miller Theater on Thursday evening.</p>
        <p>Ms. Nonken is a pianist from music's leading edge, associated with new works and with pieces whose challenges have withstood the last half century, pieces like the Barraque Sonata, which she will play at an eagerly awaited concert in a month's time, again at Miller. ''Concord,'' for her, is an old friend and a classic, and she made it sound as fluent as Schubert if, like Schubert, prone to eddies and strangenesses in the musical flow.</p>
        <p>Her dominant qualities would be advantages in any music: lightness in attack, clarity of texture, singing lines (and singing chords), variety of nuance, certainty in defining climaxes and in moving toward or away from them, a sense that the end of a movement must matter, as witness her deft conclusion to a brilliant account, at once fantastical and purposeful, of the ''Hawthorne'' movement, or her way of making the disintegration at the end of ''Thoreau'' secure and affirmative.</p>
        <p>That last moment, where the music drifts away (or, one might say after this performance, drifts here), was special partly because its previous history had been persuasively outlined in the appearances of its underlying hymn tune in each of the previous movements. In the ''Alcotts'' the culminating entry of the hymn had been exalted.</p>
        <p>What to program with such a piece? Ms. Nonken's answer was characteristically intelligent, and looked fine in advance: Michael Finnissy's ''North American Spirituals,'' with his ''Kemp's Morris'' thrown in as overture. As its title implies, ''North American Spirituals,'' like the ''Concord'' Sonata, uses American vernacular material.</p>
        <p>But where Ives's music has the feel of fingers -- as if it were a tour of the country finding everyone playing the piano, playing hymns in churches, songs in parlors, ragtime in saloons, marches and quadrilles in community halls -- Mr. Finnissy's sources are discovered in a more distant and rarefied fashion.</p>
        <p>At its best, and helped by a beautiful performance, his piece suggested a neglected churchyard, with tombs (hymns and spirituals) garlanded by ivy, their inscriptions partly effaced by lichens. ''Kemp's Morris'' found Ms. Nonken, always precise and poetic at the keyboard, no less so when raising her arms to play the little bells attached to her fingers.</p>
