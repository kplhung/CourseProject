        <p>Cingular Wireless, a new business 40 percent owned by BellSouth and 60 percent owned by SBC Communications, said yesterday that it had named the Atlanta and New York offices of BBDO Worldwide, part of the Omnicom Group, to handle its creative and media account. Billings were estimated at $200 million.</p>
        <p>Virginia Vann, senior vice president for marketing at Cingular in Atlanta, said the decision came after a three-month review narrowed the field to the offices of BBDO and two other finalists: GSD&amp;M in Austin, Tex., also part of Omnicom, the agency that had handled wireless advertising for SBC; and West Wayne in Atlanta, the agency that had handled wireless advertising for BellSouth.</p>
