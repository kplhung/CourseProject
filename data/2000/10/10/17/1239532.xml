        <p>Having awarded their electoral votes to Michael S. Dukakis in 1988 and to Bill Clinton in the next two presidential elections, Washington and Oregon would seem to be immensely hospitable terrain for a Democratic aspirant to the White House -- perhaps so much so that neither major party candidate would worry much about bothering with campaigning here.</p>
        <p>But not this year.</p>
        <p>For several reasons, the contests here between Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas are being fiercely fought and are ranked as tossups right now. To some degree, of course, the closeness of the race in the Pacific Northwest reflects the same dynamics at play in much of the rest of the nation. But other factors are more specific to the region, such as the relatively high popularity here of Ralph Nader and perhaps even the resentment widely felt in the Seattle area over the Clinton administration's antitrust case against Microsoft.</p>
        <p>In any event, ''both of these states are close, desperately close,'' says Tim Hibbitts, an independent pollster in Portland. ''That's the only way I can describe it.''</p>
        <p>Aside from several recent polls that suggest how tight the race is, there is another sign of how competitive the two major-party candidates consider it to be -- evidence that can perhaps be found principally on television screens here.</p>
        <p>In Seattle, more television advertisements have been run for the candidates than in any other metropolitan market in the nation, except for Philadelphia -- a total of 5,921 (3,037 for the Gore campaign, 2,884 for the Bush campaign) from June 1 through Oct. 8, according to a tracking survey conducted by the Brennan Center at the New York University School of Law. The survey ranks the Portland metropolitan area No. 7.</p>
        <p>For Mr. Gore, who has made 16 visits here since 1997, the targeting of so many resources in two states worth a combined 18 electoral votes, and once considered relatively safe, is clearly not a good sign.</p>
        <p>''It's not that there is any great shift of political ideology going on this year'' in the region, said Robert E. Gogerty, a political strategist in Seattle who generally works for Democrats. ''It's that Gore has just not bonded with people in the Northwest, at least not yet. And if he can't do it here, he's going to have trouble in a lot of places.''</p>
        <p>Were Mr. Nader not in the race, it is possible that the Gore-Lieberman campaign might, if not take the Northwest for granted, at least not have to worry so much about it. But Mr. Gore seems to be suffering from political leanings among many here that are so solidly on the left that discontent with him runs very strong in some places.</p>
        <p>Some polls suggest that Mr. Nader may pull a higher vote in Oregon than in any other state -- as much as 8 percent. And the Seattle area, famously the site of last year's anti-globalization protests at the World Trade Organization meeting, may contribute to almost as strong a showing in Washington state.</p>
        <p>Whether such numbers will bear up on Election Day is, of course, a different matter. Mr. Hibbitts, the Portland pollster, calculated that about half of the pro-Nader vote is ''not accessible to either major party -- whom these voters view as two peas in a very corrupt pod.'' Such people, if they vote Nov. 7, will be ''rock-solid for Ralph Nader. They will not switch their vote.''</p>
        <p>The other half, he added, might well decide in the end that the race between Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore is so close that they want to have an impact on it. But even here, Mr. Hibbitts added, those voters will not necessarily vote uniformly for Mr. Gore, though he should claim the lion's share. In interviews, some pro-Nader voters have suggested that they would prefer Mr. Bush to Mr. Gore because they believe a Bush presidency is more likely to inspire the kind of anger and opposition that truly ignite what they describe as a progressive, third-party movement for future years.</p>
        <p>And of course, Mr. Nader may well keep many of those voters or even add to their totals by Election Day, especially if they remain disenchanted with Mr. Gore. Thousands have paid for tickets to cheer on Mr. Nader at boisterous rallies in both Seattle and Portland in recent weeks.</p>
        <p>Other factors include the bitter contentiousness over proposals to help endangered salmon by removing dams on the Snake River in eastern Washington. Such an approach is  favored by many environmentalists, but is anathema to many of the people in the region. They fear it will hurt the agricultural economy, curtail recreational use of the river and drive up the cost of electricity.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush has taken a stand opposing plans to breach the dams.</p>
        <p>''People have been able to make a living off rivers and at the same time coexist with nature,'' he said at a rally in Spokane last month at which he vowed: ''If George W. Bush becomes president, the dams will not be breached.''</p>
        <p>And, he added, to more applause, as if he were addressing Mr. Gore directly: ''These dams are important to a way of life, Mr. Vice President.''</p>
        <p>Such a stance, at a minimum, has strengthened Mr. Bush's support in a conservative region that would be likely to side with him regardless and that Mr. Gore has visited just once in recent years. It may even bring out some voters who otherwise might not make it to the polls, analysts say.</p>
        <p>But on the western side of the Cascades, where far more people live and which should be much friendlier territory to the vice president, Mr. Gore's decision to straddle the issue has had a much murkier fallout. Earlier this year he endorsed the administration's plan to put off any such decision for at least several years while other methods of helping the fish were tried and more scientific studies conducted.</p>
        <p>In doing so, he angered some conservation groups who argue that breaching is by far the best and perhaps the only way to save the salmon, and some people who care about the issue may gravitate toward Mr. Nader.</p>
        <p>In many ways, the debate crystallizes the region's tensions between economic development and ''livability'' concerns such as sprawl and stronger environmental protection. But as energy costs have mounted and the specter of electricity shortages looms, the idea of doing away with dams supplying about 4 percent of the region's electric power has become more controversial, and Mr. Gore is trying hard not to alienate anyone on the matter. Still, some voters here may simply be irritated at their perception that he is waffling.</p>
        <p>He even faces the wrath of a group  called ''Environmentalists Against Gore,'' though most mainstream environmentalist groups now support him.</p>
        <p>''The dams are one of those issues that kind of adds to a cumulative level of frustration with Gore, and continues to cause people to look at Nader,'' said Bill Arthur, the Northwest/Alaska regional director of the Sierra Club. ''On the other hand, as an organization, we certainly have endorsed Gore. Our members recognize there's a Grand Canyon's worth of difference between Gore and Bush on the environment.''</p>
        <p>And then there is the Microsoft case. Many people who work in the high-tech industry region in the Seattle area classify themselves as politically liberal. But lingering anger over the Microsoft case seems to have blunted some of the potential enthusiasm for Mr. Gore. (Microsoft itself and its employees have given more to Mr. Bush and the Republican National Committee than to Mr. Gore and the Democratic committee, finance records show.)</p>
        <p>Several pollsters said some voters here are perturbed over the case, though, of course, some who work for Microsoft's competitors are delighted to see the company taken down a peg. Whether this will be enough to sway votes is a hard question.</p>
        <p>''There is a 'Microsoft factor,' but I can't quantify it for you,'' said Mr. Hibbitts. ''But you know what? If one of every 200 votes is being impacted by that, that's a potential switch of half a percentage point. And the way this election is going, that could make the difference. That's the level we're at right now.''</p>
