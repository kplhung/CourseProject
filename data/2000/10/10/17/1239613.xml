      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The Public Lives profile on Friday, about Maria J. Zone, a television producer for Court TV's ''Crime Stories'' who was taken hostage at a New York prison last week by the convicted murderer Kenneth Kimes, misstated the outcome of a case covered in a previous episode of the program. The defendant, Terri Gilbert, was acquitted in 1998, not convicted, in the killing of her husband in New Mexico.</p>
        <p>The article also misstated the surname of a murderer from Delaware who was the subject of a different episode. He was Thomas J. Capano, not Caputo.</p>
