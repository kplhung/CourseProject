        <p>Could Big Oil Mean Less Opera?</p>
        <p>The merger of Chevron Corporation and Texaco Inc. had opera lovers worrying yesterday that the Metropolitan Opera's radio broadcasts, a Saturday-afternoon fixture since 1940, might disappear from the airwaves.</p>
        <p>CHRIS GIDEZ, a spokesman for Texaco and Chevron, said that Texaco would continue its sponsorship until the merger took effect. ''Texaco is still Texaco, and Texaco is still the sponsor of the Metropolitan Opera,'' he said.</p>
        <p>And after the two oil companies join forces?</p>
        <p>''The details of the new company's support for specific institutions such as the Met sponsorship will be addressed by the transition team that has just been established,'' he said. ''No decisions have been made.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Gidez, who called the Met broadcasts ''one of our most cherished sponsorships,'' noted that a former Texaco chief executive, JAMES W. KINNEAR, is the chairman of the Met's board and that Texaco's chief executive, PETER I. BIJUR, is on the board. Mr. Gidez would not say how much money Texaco had been spending on the  broadcasts, which this season begin on Dec. 9 with the 1,193rd sponsored by Texaco.</p>
        <p>JOSEPH VOLPE, the Met's general manager, said through a spokesman, ''We hope that Chevron Texaco will continue to make opera available'' through the Saturday broadcasts.</p>
        <p>A Stranger Party</p>
        <p>The playwright CRAIG LUCAS had opening night jitters on Sunday, and it wasn't even opening night. His new play ''Stranger,'' starring KYRA SEDGWICK and DAVID STRATHAIRN, does not open until tonight. The Sunday performance at the Vineyard Theater at 108 East 15th Street was the last preview.</p>
        <p>So?</p>
        <p>The theater has a tradition of having its opening-night parties before opening night. The tradition began in the days when the next morning's papers arrived at newsstands around midnight, just when a party would be in full swing and a bad review could spoil the fun.</p>
        <p>That explains what happened on Sunday, when Mr. Lucas and Ms. Sedgwick (and the rest of the cast and much of the audience) went from the theater to Bambou, a restaurant on East 14th Street between Second and Third Avenues.</p>
        <p>There, a question came up. Had Ms. Sedgwick ever had a real-life experience that was anything like the play, in which two strangers sit next to each other on a plane?</p>
        <p>Had she ever. ''One time I was on a plane from Los Angeles to New York and I sat next to this sleazy, strange guy who ended up going to jail,'' she said. ''He was stealing everyone's money in the Hamptons. I kept thinking, 'Who is he and why does he have to sit next to me?' ''</p>
        <p>Did he try to talk her into investing her money?</p>
        <p>''I don't have any money,'' she said. ''I am doing a play for $300 a week.''</p>
        <p>Debt-Free Beauty</p>
        <p>ROBERT M. RENNEISEN, the president and chief executive of the Miss America Organization, sat in his hotel room yesterday morning with the television on, but the sound off. He was waiting for ANGELA PEREZ BARAQUIO, who was crowned Miss America over the weekend and was about to appear on ''Good Morning America.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Renneisen was talking about ''the dichotomy'' of the Miss America pageant. ''The tip of the iceberg is what people see every fall on television,'' he said. ''We're the largest provider of scholarships for women.''</p>
        <p>So what about that swimsuit competition?</p>
        <p>''We'd be happier without it, the contestants would be happier without it, but the viewers would not,'' he said. ''We're discussing a number of things, if and when it happens.''</p>
        <p>He reached for the remote control and turned on the sound. Ms. Baraquio was next to DIANE SAWYER.</p>
        <p>Ms. Baraquio said that winning the Miss Hawaii and Miss America pageants had enabled her to pay her student loans and have money for graduate school. Ms. Sawyer, herself crowned America's Junior Miss in 1963, said that Ms. Baraquio had called the swimsuit competition ''degrading.'' Ms. Baraquio agreed. Then Ms. Sawyer stood up and said that she was 5 feet 9 inches tall. Ms. Baraquio said that she was 5 feet 4 inches.</p>
        <p>Mr. Renneisen said, ''I think Heather was shorter.'' That would be HEATHER FRENCH, Ms. Baraquio's predecessor.</p>
        <p>Then, Mr. Renneisen had a question: ''Do you mind if I smoke?''</p>
