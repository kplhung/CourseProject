        <p>On the eve of the third and final presidential debate, questions have emerged not only about the performance of the candidates but also about the man in the middle: the moderator, Jim Lehrer of PBS.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lehrer has been a target of intensifying criticism from partisans and analysts who complain that he did not sufficiently probe the candidates in the first two debates and was not particularly aggressive in following up his questions. The result, these critics say, is that the nominees were let off the hook on vital matters and the debates meandered to the point where they verged on being downright tedious.</p>
        <p>In a telephone interview today from St. Louis, where the final debate will take place on Tuesday night, Mr. Lehrer said his critics were missing the point. His role, he said, is to foster give-and-take, and not become a star attraction.</p>
        <p>''If somebody wants to be entertained, they ought to go to the circus,'' Mr. Lehrer said. ''They ought to go to the movies. Or they ought to go to the ballgame. I didn't sign on to entertain people for 90 minutes three times. These have been tremendous exercises for democracy.''</p>
        <p>Still, many prominent Democrats and Republicans said Mr. Lehrer, anchor of ''The NewsHour With Jim Lehrer,'' had set the wrong tone in pivotal encounters that could affect who is elected president.</p>
        <p>''If you had a moderator who was trying to accentuate the differences, that would have been a fabulous debate,'' said Senator Bob Kerrey,  Democrat of Nebraska, who blamed Mr. Lehrer for not pressing the candidates, especially Gov. George W. Bush, on the issues in the debate last week. ''You could have picked 10 people off the street who didn't know Jerusalem from Georgia,'' Mr. Kerrey said, ''and they would have had better questions.''</p>
        <p>Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, suggested that Mr. Lehrer did not adequately rein in Vice President Al Gore during the first debate. ''Gore kept interrupting and violating the rules, and Lehrer must have clearly been taken aback,'' Mr. McConnell said. ''Let me say this: I think that Lehrer did a better job in the second debate.''</p>
        <p>Patrick H. Caddell, who was a pollster for President Jimmy Carter and now works in Hollywood, said both candidates should be disappointed.</p>
        <p>''He is running the debates as though they were some kind of sherry hour at the institute of politics at Harvard,'' Mr. Caddell said of Mr. Lehrer. ''He refuses to press the candidates as the interlocutor on important issues. I find it appalling that he's more interested in serving his own intellectual delights than he is as the surrogate of the American people.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lehrer has become such a fixture in presidential debates -- he has been a moderator at the forums since 1988 -- that Peter Jennings, the ABC anchor, said in an interview that ''Jim is the moderator for life.''</p>
        <p>And he has his share of admirers. Juan Williams of National Public Radio said in a television interview after the first debate, ''You want someone that fairly disappears and allows the two candidates to emerge as personalities.''</p>
        <p>Gore supporters, on the other hand, have been especially vociferous in their criticism. Among their complaints is that in the second debate Mr. Lehrer said, incorrectly, that there were Gore commercials depicting Mr. Bush as a bungler. They also noted that in several of the exchanges at the end of the debate Mr. Lehrer allowed Mr. Bush to get the last word.</p>
        <p>Some Gore campaign advisers said they now regretted that they prevailed when, in pre-debate negotiations with the Bush organization,  they pressed for Mr. Lehrer as the moderator. Bush campaign officials had proposed Tim Russert of NBC,  according to people involved in the talks, although at one stage they suggested Larry King of CNN and perhaps Mr. Lehrer for one debate each. In the end, Mr. Lehrer got all three, and Bernard Shaw moderated the vice-presidential debate.</p>
        <p>One possible explanation for the criticism among Democrats is that party leaders are frustrated by the stinging reviews of Mr. Gore's performance in the two debates so far.</p>
        <p>But Republicans have also been critical. ''The first debate was like a runaway train,'' said Roger Stone, a Republican strategist. ''The guy just didn't do any moderating. In the second debate, some of his questions bordered on the inane: reading a list of countries saying, 'Should we have gone there or not?' Politics is about the future.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lehrer, of course, finds himself in something of a no-win situation: Everyone, it seems, has a list of questions that he did not ask, and  everyone has his or her own approach. If Mr. Lehrer had been more assertive, he undoubtedly would have been attacked for that.</p>
        <p>''He is fair, he is informed,'' said Martin Plissner, author of ''The Control Room: How Television Calls the Shots in Presidential Elections'' (The Free Press, 1999). ''But he could be tougher. He's got the intellectual equipment to be tougher.''</p>
        <p>Noting that the campaigns themselves had settled on Mr. Lehrer, he said, ''They clearly picked Jim because he appears relatively harmless.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lehrer, a 66-year-old with a courtly manner, is a novelist in his spare time. In his latest novel, he  tells of four journalists who, horrified that a racist Republican will win the presidency, set out to undercut him in the one debate of the campaign.</p>
        <p>For his performance in these real-life debates, he has no apologies. ''I'm very comfortable with the way I do it,'' he said. ''My job in moderating a debate is different than if I were interviewing these men. It is their job to debate. It is not my job to debate. It is my job to facilitate their exchanges. My aggressiveness is not an issue.''</p>
        <p>Told that some officials of the campaigns had privately objected to his performance, Mr. Lehrer said: ''I'm a big boy. I can live with it.''</p>
        <p>Some of Mr. Lehrer's critics said they were afraid to speak for attribution because he is a powerful journalist. One who did, Mr. Caddell, said,  ''I'm sure this will be the last time you'll ever see me on PBS.''</p>
