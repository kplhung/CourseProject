        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''Diagnosing Without Thinking'' shows how our hurried, performance-oriented society is unwittingly encouraging poor performance.</p>
        <p>Medicine, even today in this age of high technology, is based on conversation between doctor and patient in which the patient is the expert on his or her symptoms, the doctor the expert on various disease conditions and physiological processes.</p>
        <p>In my second year of med school, we were fortunate to be taught by a clinician who told us that the secret of diagnosis was to be quiet and listen to the patient, then to take the time to contemplate the information.</p>
        <p>If we did this, he assured us, we would soon find out what was going on. The lab tests were for later.</p>
