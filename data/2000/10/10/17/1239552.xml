        <p>The misdiagnosis of a rash as being jock itch (''Diagnosing Without Thinking,'' Oct. 10) is not an unusual case.</p>
        <p>Many of us suffering from Lyme disease, like Robert, have had varying diagnoses before the light bulb went off -- usually in the patient's head -- and it was finally confirmed by a physician.

        <p>The misdiagnosis of a rash as being jock itch (''Diagnosing Without Thinking,'' Oct. 10) is not an unusual case.</p>
        <p>Many of us suffering from Lyme disease, like Robert, have had varying diagnoses before the light bulb went off -- usually in the patient's head -- and it was finally confirmed by a physician. Earlier diagnosis might have saved many from a Lyme disease that has become firmly entrenched and difficult to eradicate.</p>
        <p>Compounding the patient's plight is a general ignorance on how to best treat Lyme. The story is familiar, pitting front-line physicians (who favor long-term treatment when necessary) against insurance industry consultants (who favor, not surprisingly, short-term treatment). Without doing considerable research, it's difficult to know whose protocol you're receiving.</p>
        <p>Patients who have already had to participate in their diagnoses must now untangle treatment protocols. This leaves treating physicians to deal with threatening insurance companies, patients to deal with treatment limits, and patients like Robert with a lot more homework to do.</p>
