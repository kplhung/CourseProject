        <p>It was 3:15 a.m. on a balmy Saturday, and 7-year-old Rudi Hayono could barely focus his drowsy brown eyes on the lively shadow puppets dancing across the screen in front of him. It had been more than seven hours since the traditional Javanese puppet show began, and Rudi, cradled in his father's arms, perhaps echoed what was on the minds of many in the audience when he asked, ''Papa, when will it end?''</p>
        <p>A few minutes later, both father and son were sound asleep, prostrate on the pavement outside the Governor's Mansion, where thousands of residents of this East Java city had come for a free performance by one of Indonesia's most famous puppet masters. A potent mix of sickly sweet coffee, clove cigarettes and roasted peanuts had helped sustain the spectators, but now they were fading fast.</p>
        <p>Hundreds of people were sleeping in their chairs and on the ground. The puppeteer, who had not taken a break for hours, narrated an epic tale of nationalism while skillfully manipulating dozens of shadow figures to the accompaniment of a 20-piece orchestra and high-pitched singers.</p>
        <p>Perhaps it was their passion for puppetry or their respect for the acclaimed puppet master, Anom Suroto, that kept them from going home. Or maybe they were too tired to move. But few in the audience left before the performance ended, at 4:05 a.m.</p>
        <p>From big cities like Surabaya to the rural villages of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, traditional shadow-puppet theater remains one of the country's most popular forms of entertainment. It attracts fans of all ages, though many end up slumbering through the elaborate productions, which often run for 12 hours without a break.</p>
        <p>''I always stay awake until the very end no matter how late, and I don't need any stimulants,'' said Siswantoro, 30, a taxi driver who had to be at work by 8 a.m. ''I like the puppet show better than television because the stories are more plausible. The shows portray human nature as it really is. The puppets are shadows of human beings.''</p>
        <p>Ali Muschsin, 23, a field worker, said that while he does not fully understand the plots, which are based on ancient myths and legends, he still enjoys a good puppet show. He said it is a good excuse to stay up all night with his friends, who were all snoozing.</p>
        <p>Umar Kayam, professor emeritus of culture at the University of Gajah Mada in Jogjakarta, said that every time he attends a shadow-puppet show, he is surprised to see that the centuries-old art form continues to attract so many young people.</p>
        <p>''I think young Indonesians like puppetry because the moral and ethical stories are more relevant to their daily lives than the dream world of foreign soap operas,'' Mr. Kayam said. ''These stories have been handed down for centuries and they provide a way to connect with the past.''</p>
        <p>The stories vary greatly depending on the puppeteer and the venue, but most are based on the Hindu epics, the Ramayana and Mahabharata, or local Javanese tales. Shows are commissioned to celebrate a special occasion like a wedding, harvest, circumcision or birth of a child, or a cultural or religious festival. Historically the plays lasted well into the night along with the other festivities.</p>
        <p>The patron chooses the play, which follows a prescribed form, but improvisation is often allowed. The puppeteer, called a dalang, often inserts contemporary themes or comedy. Stories are laden with high drama, palace intrigue, romance, philosophy, combat, mysticism and moral lessons.</p>
        <p>The recent show in Surabaya, the capital of East Java province, featured Mr. Suroto, one of the best-known puppeteers in the nation, and his 16-year-old son and protege, Muhammad Bayuaji Prasetya.</p>
        <p>Bayuaji performed the entire eight-hour play by himself except for a brief interlude in which his father indulged the audience. The play was entitled ''Love Your Motherland,'' a heroic story of nationalism featuring a god who becomes human.</p>
        <p>For aficionados, the Surabaya show, which was sponsored by the provincial government, was a rare opportunity to see one of Indonesia's great dalangs. ''To see the father and the son in one show for free is unbelievable,'' said Riwan Pudjinugroho, a 30-year-old office worker, who says he has stayed awake through more than 30 performances.</p>
        <p>''No one in Indonesia has a better voice than Anom, the father,'' Mr. Pudjinugroho said. ''He can perfectly imitate every character, male and female.'' Mr. Pudjinugroho said that with seasoning, Bayuaji could become as good as his father. ''The son is much better than the father at the puppet movements, especially during the fighting scenes.''</p>
        <p>During the performance, the puppeteer sits cross-legged on a mat before an illuminated cotton screen about the size of a large television. The puppets are made of leather, typically water buffalo hide, and shows often have scores of figures.</p>
        <p>In a typical show, most of the audience sit in front of the screen to watch the shadow figures, and a few spectators sit behind the screen to watch the puppeteer, the orchestra and the singers. But at the Surabaya performance, the reverse was true.</p>
        <p>A puppeteer is a playwright, linguist, ventriloquist and director all rolled into one. The master must speak not only the language of the audience but also the ancient Kawi language spoken by the characters, which the audience largely understands as well. The puppeteer mimics the various voices, manipulates the puppets in intricate movement, directs the orchestra and sets the mood. Moreover, the puppeteer must memorize hours of script and possess the stamina to perform all night.</p>
        <p>''Dalangs are among the most learned and accomplished people in Indonesia,'' said Mr. Kayam, the professor. ''It's quite a wonder to watch them work.''</p>
        <p>Because of the popularity of puppet shows, the government has often used them for propaganda purposes. During the military dictatorship of former President Suharto, dalangs were strongly encouraged to insert messages about family planning and patriotism into their plays, and many obliged. The propaganda was often as subtle as a king puppet telling a minister that he was worried about the future of his kingdom because of the increasing number of citizens. Indonesia has the world's fourth-largest population.</p>
        <p>Asked to rate his son's performance, Mr. Suroto said that Bayuaji did ''O.K.'' but that he still had much to learn. ''I'm just feeling thankful that I finally have a son who can inherit my talent,'' he said. Of Mr. Suroto's six children, Bayuaji, his youngest, is the only one who has shown a penchant for puppetry. But Mr. Suroto said he is pleased by the large number of young puppeteers who are now coming into their own.</p>
        <p>Few schools teach the art, and those that do are expensive. Shadow puppetry is typically learned under an apprenticeship with a dalang. It takes decades to master the art. But there are rich rewards. A dalang of high acclaim can charge as much as $5,000 for a single performance.</p>
        <p>At the end of his performance, Bayuaji was so exhausted he had to be helped down from the stage. He said the most difficult part was learning the voices of the characters, which takes hours of practice every day. But he said it was not hard to stay awake.</p>
        <p>''I have to concentrate so intensely on the show that I feel like I've entered the world of the puppets,'' he said, ''and I have no real sense of time until it's all over.''</p>
