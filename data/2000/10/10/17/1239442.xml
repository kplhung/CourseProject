        <p>Nowadays, researchers take for granted a huge array of precision instruments and machines that would have dazzled their predecessors in science and engineering.</p>
        <p>But though their powers may be primitive, many devices used decades or even centuries ago were devised with such ingenuity that they dazzle today in their own way.</p>
        <p>These scientific, engineering and medical instruments, to be auctioned tonight by Christie's, Beverly Hills, are examples.</p>
        <p>The instrument above, a cosmo-sphere made in the United States in the mid-19th century, shows the positions of the continents relative to longitude and the signs of the Zodiac.</p>
        <p>At right is a 19th-century tellurian, an instrument in which spheres representing the Earth and the Moon move around the Sun.</p>
        <p>As the detail shows, the instrument was made in London.</p>
        <p>A calculating machine, far right, top, works as its ivory-handled gear is turned.</p>
        <p>The instrument at far right, bottom, is a rare binocular microscope, dating from the mid-19th century.</p>
