        <p>Astronomers reported last week that they had measured the age of a cosmic smoke ring and determined that the stupendous blast in which it originated would have lit up the skies of ancient civilizations on Earth.</p>
        <p>The so-called Veil nebula (right, above), also known as the Cygnus Loop, extends for three degrees -- about six times the width of the full moon -- across the northern sky. Its ethereal ribbons and wreaths, astronomers say, are produced by material from an exploded star, a supernova, being heated to incandescence as it rams into interstellar gas.</p>
        <p>By comparing a Hubble Space Telescope image with a photographic plate obtained from Palomar Mountain in California in 1953, astronomers led by Dr. William P. Blair and Dr. Ravi Sankrit, both from the Johns Hopkins University, were able to measure the motion of one strand of the nebula across the stars over four decades.</p>
        <p>Combining this result with other data, they were able to conclude that a star some 15 times the mass of the Sun had exploded only about 5,000 years ago and about 1,400 light-years away -- more recently and nearer than thought. A supernova in 1054, which was recorded by Chinese astronomers as being six times as bright as Venus, was about 7,000 light-years away. This one, Dr. Blair and his colleagues estimate, would have been at least as bright as the full moon, as seen on Earth.</p>
