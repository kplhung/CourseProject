        <p>Perhaps all they proved was that they could beat Denny Neagle. Yet after a 6-2 victory in Game 5, the Mariners swiftly embraced views much larger than the one suggesting they only delayed the inevitable elimination by the Yankees and Orlando Hernandez in Game 6.</p>
        <p>Either presumptuous or prophetic, Manager Lou Piniella felt the series was headed back to New York even before he arrived at Safeco Field on Sunday for Game 5. Figuring his team would shake off any hangover from Roger Clemens's 15-strikeout, one-hit performance in Game 4, Piniella packed his bags, called off batting practice and held a team meeting.</p>
        <p>''I was ready for it,'' Piniella said. ''We've won three in a row several times this year. Why not now?''</p>
        <p>To the Mariners, all signs pointed to success in tonight's Game 6 at Yankee Stadium. Much like the boost the Yankees received from one-inning rallies earlier in the series, the Mariners believe their five runs in the fifth inning Sunday swung momentum strongly in their favor.</p>
        <p>''There is no reason it can't work the same way for us,'' said Mark McLemore, whose bunt single was the beginning of the end for the Yankees in Game 5. ''The key is that the middle of our order did the damage there, our big guys came through. And if they get hot, then we'll have all the runs we need and all we have to do is go with our strengths -- pitching and defense.''</p>
        <p>The Mariners are confident that their starting pitcher, John Halama, can again stop the Yankees tonight. Halama, a Brooklyn native, threw six scoreless innings in Game 2 before the Yankees raked Seattle's relievers for seven runs.</p>
        <p>''Hernandez has never been beaten in the postseason; we realize that,'' Piniella said. ''He's been so darn tough on right-handers all year, so we're going to stack our lineup with left-handers and make it as tough on him as possible.''</p>
