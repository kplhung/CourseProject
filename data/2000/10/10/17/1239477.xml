        <p>Archbishop Joseph T. Ryan, who was the spiritual leader for more than two million Roman Catholics as the first archbishop of the Archdiocese for the Military Services, died Oct. 9 in Albany. He was 86 and lived in Albany.</p>
        <p>In 1985, Pope John Paul II appointed Archbishop Ryan to lead that new archdiocese, which handles the religious needs of Catholics in the United States military and their families, residents of veterans hospitals and civilian government employees living abroad. Previously, those duties were handled by the Military Vicariate, which was established in 1917 and was part of the Archdiocese of New York.</p>
        <p>The archbishop, who had been the vicariate's second in command for 10 years, oversaw its transition to an archdiocese and its move to Washington. He retired in 1991.</p>
        <p>Born in Albany, Archbishop Ryan attended Manhattan College in New York City and St. Joseph's Seminary in Yonkers. He was ordained a priest in 1939. He was in the Navy Chaplain Corps from 1943 to 1946 and took part in the Marine landing at Okinawa, the archdiocese said. He was cited twice for bravery.</p>
        <p>He worked in the Diocese of Albany from 1946 to 1957 and was chancellor of the Military Vicariate in  1957 and 1958.</p>
        <p>From 1958 until 1960, he was based in Beirut, where he did relief work with the Catholic Near East Welfare Association and the Pontifical Mission for Palestine. In 1966, he was appointed the first archbishop of Anchorage. In 1975, he was selected to be second in command at the Military Vicariate.</p>
        <p>Archbishop Ryan leaves no immediate survivors.</p>
