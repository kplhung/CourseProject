      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial says New York State should make every effort to ensure that no child loses health coverage due to administrative problems that may cause as many as 130,000 youngsters in low-income families to be swtiched out of Child Health Plus subsidized insurance program into Medicaid</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>New York State's Child Health Plus program is a model for the nation in providing health insurance for low-income children. About 550,000 children are receiving subsidized coverage under the state program, which was expanded after Congress provided more money through the federal Children's Health Insurance Program that passed in 1997.</p>
        <p>But New York's admirable record in providing insurance has been marred by administrative problems that now put as many as 130,000 youngsters in danger of being switched out of Child Health Plus because they should have been enrolled in Medicaid instead. Both programs receive federal money, but federal rules require that children eligible for Medicaid be enrolled in that program, and not in Child Health Plus. To correct the situation, the state is now in the process of moving tens of thousands of children from one program to the other.</p>

        <p>New York State's Child Health Plus program is a model for the nation in providing health insurance for low-income children. About 550,000 children are receiving subsidized coverage under the state program, which was expanded after Congress provided more money through the federal Children's Health Insurance Program that passed in 1997.</p>
        <p>But New York's admirable record in providing insurance has been marred by administrative problems that now put as many as 130,000 youngsters in danger of being switched out of Child Health Plus because they should have been enrolled in Medicaid instead. Both programs receive federal money, but federal rules require that children eligible for Medicaid be enrolled in that program, and not in Child Health Plus. To correct the situation, the state is now in the process of moving tens of thousands of children from one program to the other.</p>
        <p>The problem arose because private health plans that participate in Child Health Plus are supposed to determine a child's eligibility and refer children who qualify for Medicaid to that program. But the state did not enforce that rule because it wanted to get as many children insured as quickly as possible, and getting Medicaid coverage was difficult and complicated. As a result, many Medicaid-eligible children were allowed to be enrolled in  Child Health Plus.</p>
        <p>For many low-income families, the confusing switch in programs could result in children's losing coverage temporarily or even permanently if they fail to navigate the transfer successfully. State officials say that hundreds of community workers have been trained to help families handle the paperwork, and Medicaid applications have been greatly simplified. Even so, many children will be forced to change doctors because their current insurance plans do not participate in Medicaid.</p>
        <p>Carl McCall, the state comptroller, says one solution is to require all Child Health Plus plans to accept Medicaid clients too. That is a worthy proposal that the state should explore. Meanwhile, the state must make every effort to ensure that no child loses coverage during this transition.</p>
