        <p>Out of the Cold</p>
        <p>Some were political dissidents. Others simply worked outside the official system. All were nonconformist Russian artists under Communist rule, from the aftermath of Stalin's death in 1953 into the era of glasnost in the late 80's. Now more than 70 of their artworks are on view through Dec. 10 at the McMullen Museum of Art on the Chestnut Hill, Mass., campus of Boston College. ''Forbidden Art: The Postwar Russian Avant-Garde'' examines the underground styles and movements that sought expression in these years.</p>
        <p>In Honor</p>
        <p>France will bestow honors on five Americans today in ceremonies conducted in Manhattan by Ambassador Francois Bujon de l'Estang. Admitted to the Legion of Honor will be Gary Tinterow, Engelhard curator of European paintings at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the philanthropist Iris Cantor. The Order of Arts and Letters will be awarded to the novelist and lawyer Louis Begley, the filmmaker Jim Jarmusch and Leonard A. Lauder, chairman of the Estee Lauder Companies Inc.</p>
        <p>Masters' Touch</p>
        <p>From the 19th century come the 115 paintings, drawings and oil sketches by artists of the Romantic period, the School of Barbizon and the Realist movement. These works are the work of Delacroix, Corot, Courbet, Seurat and Constable, among others. They are on view from today through Jan. 21 at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in ''Romanticism and the School of Nature: 19th-Century Drawings and Paintings From the Karen B. Cohen Collection.'' At the center of the show from the holdings of this honorary trustee and longtime supporter of the museum are 20 images by Delacroix (1798-1863). From pencil sketches to oil paintings and fully worked watercolors, they span his career and include early studies after Rubens, exotic scenes from Morocco, renderings of animals observed in the zoological gardens in Paris and narrative scenes inspired by drama and literature.</p>
        <p>Trans-Atlantic Link</p>
        <p>New York gets a new center for Nordic culture today with the opening of Scandinavia House at 56-58 Park Avenue, between 37th and 38th Streets. The 28,000-square-foot building designed by James Stewart Polshek will be the permanent home of the American-Scandinavian Foundation. Open six days a week, Scandinavia House will offer programs on Nordic culture, encompassing the visual arts, music and literature, as well as finance and technology. Besides a children's learning center for youngsters 4 to 11 and their families, the building houses a cafe featuring Scandinavian dishes and a shop offering Scandinavian design, music and books.</p>
