        <p>Is there a Jacksonville Jaguars voodoo doll with pins stuck in it under the Tennessee Titans' bench? Do all of the Titans play against the Jaguars with rabbits' feet in their pockets?</p>
        <p>Exactly what is the deal when the Jaguars and the Titans meet?</p>
        <p>It always gets physical. It often gets ugly. And one team -- the Jaguars -- always seems to see its energy sapped, drained and dripped like coffee through a filter.</p>
        <p>Titans 27, Jaguars 13.</p>
        <p>Tonight, 68,498 fans showed up at Adelphia Coliseum to see their Titans hypnotize the Jaguars and watch them sleepwalk through another horrific show. This Tennessee victory made it five straight in the series against Jacksonville, a string that began on Dec. 13, 1998.</p>
        <p>Tennessee (5-1) is on a nice roll. It won its fifth straight game; its only loss was its season opener at Buffalo -- and that was by only 3 points. The Titans are 19-2 in their last 21 games against teams from their division, the American Football Conference Central. They have never lost in this stadium, a string of 11 games.</p>
        <p>Jacksonville was 15-3 last year, and all three of its losses were to Tennessee. The last two were by 41-14 and 33-14, and the latter was in the A.F.C. championship game.</p>
        <p>Jacksonville took the entire off-season to ponder that. It tried to tinker and retool its club to match the Titans. After all, before Tennessee began this current streak, it had lost four straight in the series to Jacksonville. But for the Jaguars (2-5), that must see like decades ago.</p>
        <p>After building a 17-3 lead at halftime, Tennessee iced the game on  Eddie George's 19-yard scoring run with 8 minutes 48 seconds left in the third quarter, which made it 24-3. George finished with 31 carries for 159 yards and 3 catches for 50 yards.</p>
        <p>Sure, there was plenty of time left after that, but, really, Jacksonville was cooked.</p>
        <p>Early on, the Jaguars appeared focused on winning the hitting war. Their preparation included stopping Tennessee tight end Frank Wycheck, who has been a thorn in their side. Of course, the Jaguars wanted to stop committing turnovers. (They entered with nine interceptions and six fumbles this season, an alarming average of more than three turnovers a game.) And, over all, they desperately wanted to show that the strange spell Tennessee had cast on them had, indeed, been snapped.</p>
        <p>But as quickly as a snap of two fingers, Jacksonville found itself under another Titans trance.</p>
        <p>Jacksonville committed two turnovers in the first half to bring its season total to 17; last year the Jaguars committed only 18 in the regular season. When the Jaguars held on to the ball, they still could not keep drives alive. Their defense wilted against Tennessee's offensive power. The Titans, who had a 17-3 lead at halftime, helped define the Jaguars' effort with a play late in the half.</p>
        <p>George fumbled the ball to Jaguars tackle Larry Smith at the Jacksonville 29 with 1:59 left. Jacksonville moved swiftly -- the big play was a 48-yard hitch pass from Mark Brunell to running back Anthony Johnson -- and soon found itself at the Tennessee 21. Brunell threw a pass over the middle to receiver Keenan McCardell. He ran for 20 yards and, while surrounded by Titans, decided to lunge for the end zone. Nice idea, but a bad move.</p>
        <p>Titans safety Marcus Robinson jarred the ball loose and Titans cornerback Samari Rolle recovered it in the end zone with 35 seconds left. No Jacksonville points and another turnover.</p>
        <p>The spell continued.</p>
        <p>Jacksonville had stopped Tennessee on the Titans' first two possessions. Then the Jaguars, on their second drive of the game, moved to the Tennessee 2, with running back Fred Taylor providing the biggest burst, galloping 71 yards to the Tennessee 11. But once there, the Jaguars stalled and settled for a Mike Hollis 23-yard field goal and a 3-0 lead. Tennessee, however, scored a touchdown on its next possession, and guess who got it? Wycheck, of course. He made a bobbling, bouncing 4-yard catch in the end zone; the ball at one point bounced off the helmet of Jaguars cornerback Jason Craft.</p>
        <p>It took Tennessee fewer that three minutes of the second quarter to make it 14-3.</p>
        <p>That was when Titans receiver Derrick Mason ran free through the Jaguars' secondary and made a twisting, turning adjustment on a pass in the end zone from Steve McNair (13 for 21 for 245 yards). Mason crashed and rolled, but held on to the ball, scoring on a 22-yard pass play. Tennessee scored again on its next possession -- Al Del Greco booted a 26-yard field goal -- and it was 17-3 with 6:44 left in the half. That set up the halftime finish.</p>
