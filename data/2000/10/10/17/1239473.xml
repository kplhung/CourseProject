        <p>Joseph E. Estrada, the embattled president of the Philippines, stood firm today in a widening scandal involving reported kickbacks from gambling rackets.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Estrada talked tough -- sounding for all the world like one of the action heroes whom he used to play in the movies -- support for the actor-turned-politician continued to crumble.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, a coalition of business groups is widely expected to issue a statement withdrawing its support for Mr. Estrada and suggesting that he be removed from office, through resignation or impeachment. That follows demands for his resignation from opposition leaders, as well as from Cardinal Jaime Sin and the Catholic Bishops Conference.</p>
        <p>Last week, Vice President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo broke with Mr. Estrada by resigning from his cabinet. Ms. Arroyo remains vice president and would succeed him.</p>
        <p>The loss of support from business leaders could cripple Mr. Estrada because it underscores the economic damage of the scandal. The Philippine peso fell to another low against the United States dollar today, before recovering slightly after the central bank intervened.</p>
        <p>''It's becoming a foregone conclusion that the president must go,'' the executive director of the influential Makati Business Club, Guillermo M. Luz, said. ''If he stays on, the economy will not perform well.''</p>
        <p>Opposition leaders plan to file impeachment charges against Mr. Estrada on Wednesday in the House of Representatives. But with the president's allies in control, that effort could drag on for months.</p>
        <p>Mr. Estrada has denied the central allegation of the scandal, that he received more than $10 million in payoffs from operators of illegal gambling rings. Today, he told reporters that his political enemies were planning an arson and bombing campaign to hound him out of office.</p>
        <p>''They are planning to burn and throw bombs in the street to cause chaos in our nation,'' Mr. Estrada said. ''That is what we are on watch for. I am warning our people and our country.''</p>
        <p>In a televised address on Sunday, Mr. Estrada sounded a different note when he apologized for the scandal's  having paralyzed the country. He pledged to remove the government from all forms of gambling.</p>
        <p>The numbers game that Mr. Estrada is accused of profiting from is illegal, though people here say it is pervasive. The kingpins who control the games funnel some of the proceeds to local politicians to buy protection from the police. Experts say drug dealing is also involved.</p>
        <p>''We've barely scratched the tip of the iceberg in this scandal,'' said Alexander R. Magno, a political expert.</p>
        <p>Mr. Estrada's troubles began last week when one of his close friends, Luis Singson, a provincial governor, said he had delivered 500 million pesos, or $10.3 million, to the president. That represented Mr. Estrada's cut of profits from gambling in Governor Singson's province, Illocos Sur.</p>
        <p>In testimony before the Senate, Mr. Singson produced a ledger that listed the names of recipients of payoffs. One entry had the initials A. S., which he said was a code for Mr. Estrada. Other people listed in the ledger, including senators, admitted receiving payments.</p>
        <p>''In some ways, this is even worse than Marcos, because at least he had the legal skills to disguise his activities,'' said Ronaldo M. Llamas, an opposition leader, referring to the ousted dictator.</p>
        <p>Like Marcos, Mr. Estrada shows no sign of leaving without a struggle. The difference is that Mr. Estrada was elected on a tide of support from poor voters. Most experts said it would be extremely hard to stampede the president out of office unless those supporters abandoned him.</p>
        <p>That is why people here are fixated on the plunging peso. A weak currency could hobble the already fragile economy. It would hit poor people in the form of more costly food and fuel.</p>
        <p>For now, polls about Mr. Estrada's conduct have yielded widely divergent views of sentiment. Opposition leaders are organizing a rally on the main commercial boulevard of Manila on Wednesday, hoping to rekindle the spirit of the People Power movement that swept out Marcos.</p>
        <p>Another wild card is the military. Mr. Estrada has won the favor of top generals by giving them latitude to wage war on Muslim separatists in strife-torn Mindanao Province. But some analysts said the army could become restive if the country descended into chaos.</p>
        <p>''This is a race between a democratic uprising on the street and a military coup,'' said Walden F. Bello, a professor at the University of the Philippines and an outspoken critic of Mr. Estrada.</p>
