        <p>Even before the Mets became the eighth team of his baseball career, Todd Zeile enjoyed a New York state of mind. As a visiting athlete playing on teams in both major leagues, he rode the subway to the ballpark and enjoyed the ambience of Manhattan. He knew the feeling of playing against the Yankees in October.</p>
        <p>''I've been in the postseason three times and all three times I've lost to the Yankees,'' Zeile said last winter, overstating by one the actual number when he played for Texas. ''I remember the life of the city and the buzz of the city and how passionate the fans were.''</p>
        <p>Should the National League champion Mets meet the Yankees in the World Series, Zeile will be prepared for the enthusiasm that will rumble from Queens and the Bronx like the No. 7 and No. 4 trains. Perhaps he could stand in the Times Square station and show people how to use their MetroCards or maybe just give directions and suggestions.</p>
        <p>''I very much enjoy living here; there is a lot more to this city than just being a good sports town,'' Zeile said before the Mets clinched the National League pennant with a 7-0 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals last night at Shea Stadium. ''I enjoy the city. I enjoy the theater. I enjoy the museums. I enjoy the cultural diversity. It's exactly what I hoped for.''</p>
        <p>Zeile was exactly what Mets management and the fans hoped for last night as the Mets took the League Championship Series four games to one. In the fourth inning, with the Mets leading, 3-0, Zeile batted with two outs and the bases loaded. He drilled Pat Hentgen's 2-2 fastball off the wall in right-center field for a double to score all the runners, drive the pitcher from the game and begin the celebration.</p>
        <p>''My confidence has been high; these sort of situations I enjoy hitting,'' Zeile said.</p>
        <p>Noting that the Cardinals pitched around Mike Piazza and Robin Ventura to get to him, Zeile said: ''There is a little added motivation when you see that happen. It was a great feeling to see the fans react the way they did and especially the reaction of my teammates, going nuts in the dugout.  All the high fives and the feeling of emotion when you get there is something I'll never forget.''</p>
        <p>The Cardinals were Zeile's first major league team, from 1989 through 1995.</p>
        <p>In this five-game series, Zeile had 7 hits in 19 at-bats for a .368 average, one homer and eight runs batted in.</p>
        <p>Did he take particular pleasure in playing so well against them? ''Slightly,'' Zeile said. ''It's the place I grew up in baseball. It was nice.''</p>
        <p>For the first three months of the season, Zeile lived in Greenwich Village and took the No. 7 train to Shea for every home game.</p>
        <p>''Then, after my son got out of school, we went out to Greenwich so that he would have some room to play,'' Zeile said. ''So, now, I drive.''</p>
        <p>After signing a three-year contract as a free agent last winter, Zeile took over the first-base position of John Olerud, who left the Mets as a free agent for Seattle. While learning the right corner of the infield as a full-time job for the first time in his 12-year career, Zeile contributed 22 home runs and 79 runs batted in.</p>
        <p>During spring training, he was tutored by Keith Hernandez, who used to play for both the Mets and the Cardinals. At 35, with experience on several teams and in a few positions, Zeile was mature enough to make the transition. He made only 10 errors.</p>
        <p>''It was made a little easier by past experience in the infield,'' Zeile said, referring to his time as a third baseman.</p>
        <p>The shift was not as hard as moving from catcher to third base, which Zeile did earlier in his career. The first time he did it, 10 years ago, his manager in St. Louis was Joe Torre, who now runs the Yankees. At the time the move offended Zeile. This time, it was different.</p>
        <p>''I had good people helping me here and showing patience,'' Zeile said. ''I began to be more comfortable as the season went on.''</p>
        <p>After signing with the Mets for $18 million, Zeile said he left the Texas Rangers for the chance to play on a championship team in the big city.</p>
        <p>''In my heart,'' Zeile said, ''I kept saying, 'My God, I would love to play in New York.' ''</p>
