        <p>I was interested to read that Dr. Paul Ehrlich (''On Human Nature and the Evolution of Culture,'' Oct. 10) believes there is not just one genetically hard-wired human nature, and that human behavior is the result of interaction between genotypes and culture.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I was interested to read that Dr. Paul Ehrlich (''On Human Nature and the Evolution of Culture,'' Oct. 10) believes there is not just one genetically hard-wired human nature, and that human behavior is the result of interaction between genotypes and culture.</p>
        <p>This may be news to biologists; but, it has been a basic understanding of anthropologists for decades. I have taught it to undergraduates for 25 years, having learned it from Alex Alland at Columbia University in the 1970's, and Rena Gropper at Hunter College in the 1960's. And Rena Gropper learned it from Ruth Benedict and Harry Shapiro in the 40's. And so on into the distant past.  CAROL LADERMAN  New York</p>
