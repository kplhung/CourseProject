        <p>A Defense Department recruiter visited New York University Law School yesterday -- the first permitted there in 22 years -- and in a scene reminiscent of the Vietnam protests of 30 years ago, the event was marked by scores of protesters who chanted, hooted and called for her to leave.</p>
        <p>Like some colleges and graduate programs, the law school has barred military recruiters because the Defense Department refuses to employ men or women who are openly gay.</p>
        <p>The school reluctantly agreed to admit a recruiter after the Defense Department issued regulations in January saying that it would withdraw all research funds from a university if any of its divisions kept its recruiters out.</p>
        <p>Until this year, the department withheld its funds just from the division that barred the recruiters. The earlier policy meant that the law school, which has long been known as a congenial school for gay students,  lost about $75,000 in student aid.</p>
        <p>But the university had more at stake. It receives more than $200 million in Defense Department research funds, about two-thirds of which go to its medical school. The general counsel's office at the university advised the law school over the summer that in light of the new regulations, it should allow a recruiter to visit.</p>
        <p>While the school allowed Capt. Ann H. Zgrodnik, a recruiter from the Army Judge Advocate General's Corps, to spend yesterday in Lipton Hall, many faculty members, students and administrators made clear their distaste for the visit.</p>
        <p>About 100 students in pink armbands and neon stickers turned out in the common room at the law school's D'Agostino Hall on West Third Street to voice their dismay in a lively but orderly protest.</p>
        <p>''Don't ask, don't tell, military go to hell,'' they chanted.</p>
        <p>John Sexton, the law school dean, said in a letter to the faculty that members of the law school would explore ''whether the new regulations might be challenged as illegal, and how the N.Y.U. Law School might contribute to such an effort.''</p>
        <p>Stephen Gillers, vice dean of the law school, said that the school itself could not bring a lawsuit but that individual faculty members, students or the university could. He said the Association of American Law Schools, the American Council on Education and other education groups in Washington had protested the new regulations to the Defense Department.</p>
        <p>The law school also decided that every time a military recruiter visited the school, it would publicize the military's unwillingness to sign the school's nondiscrimination policy.</p>
        <p>Many law school faculty members also signed a public statement saying they deplored the new Defense Department recruiting policy because it compromised their freedom to set ethical standards for student recruiting and ''conscripts us into complicity with policies that unjustly degrade fellow persons.''</p>
        <p>In a statement released by university officials, Captain Zgrodnik declined to be interviewed. But Lt. Col. Catherine Abbott, a spokeswoman for the Defense Department, said yesterday that allowing the military to recruit on campuses ''is the law'' made by Congress.</p>
        <p>''We want students to be able to make informed decisions,'' she said. ''We are not asking for any greater access than anyone else has.''</p>
        <p>Martha Rudd, a spokeswoman for the Army, said yesterday that 23 schools either turned away Army recruiters last year or gave them unequal access, like requiring them to interview in less desirable places.</p>
        <p>Some professors who joined the protest yesterday said they opposed military recruiting because the Defense Department would not abide by the nondiscriminatory policies other recruiters endorse.</p>
        <p>''It is particularly galling to be forced to do this under regulations that I think are illegal,'' said Sylvia A. Law, a law school professor and chairwoman of the school's placement committee, who said she might file a lawsuit over the department's new regulations.</p>
        <p>If there was any dissension from the protest, it was not visible yesterday.</p>
        <p>Some of the protesters signed up for interviews with Captain Zgrodnik. Richard McKewen, a third-year law student and editor in chief of the N.Y.U. Review of Law and Social Change, told the cheering crowd that he had told the recruiter that by working for the military, ''You are complicit in your institution's bigotry, and you personally are not welcome here.''</p>
        <p>Someone in the crowd shouted, ''Did you tell her you were gay?''</p>
        <p>Mr. McKewen grinned and gestured to his costume, which included a golden tiara and a black feather boa, as well as cargo shorts and sneakers.</p>
        <p>''If she couldn't read the signals,'' he said, ''then the military's worse off than we thought.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  October 18, 2000, Wednesday  An article yesterday about a protest against a military recruiter at New York University Law School over the military's ban on openly gay service members misstated the amount of research money the university receives from the Defense Department, which has threatened to withhold funds from universities that bar recruiters. It is about $8 million, not more than $200 million.</p>
