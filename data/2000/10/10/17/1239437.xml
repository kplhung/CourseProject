        <p>Maybe it was the record nine Emmy awards  ''The West Wing'' won last month. Perhaps it was NBC's heavy promotion of that drama series during the recent Olympics.

        <p>Maybe it was the record nine Emmy awards  ''The West Wing'' won last month. Perhaps it was NBC's heavy promotion of that drama series during the recent Olympics. Was it the nation's focus on the presidential election? Or does the idealistic country-lawyer persona of the fictional President Josiah Bartlet represent wish fulfillment on the part of the audience? (Bumper stickers spotted in Los Angeles read ''Bartlet for President.'')</p>
        <p>Whatever the reason, ''The West Wing,'' the hourlong NBC series about the Oval Office staff, has taken off in its second year: its two-hour premiere episode on Oct. 4 drew an unexpected 25 million viewers, propelling it into the top rank with ''E.R.,'' which averaged 24.9 million viewers last year. Last season ''The West Wing'' ranked 30th among network shows and drew on average 14 million viewers.</p>
        <p>Whether the series can maintain its momentum is unclear. After its next episode -- scheduled for broadcast tomorrow night, unless the American League playoffs require a seventh game -- NBC and Warner Brothers, the show's producer, will know if ''The West Wing' has moved firmly into the category of lucrative, top-ranked shows like ''E.R.'' and ''Friends.''</p>
        <p>''It was a solid performer last year but not a breakout show,'' Alan Wurtzel, president for research at NBC, said of ''The West Wing.'' ''This year it has vaulted to the next level. We see no reason why it shouldn't continue.''</p>
        <p>Some television shows need time to to build audiences. Series as diverse as ''Seinfeld,'' ''Cheers,'' ''Ally McBeal'' and ''The Practice'' started gathering viewers only in their second years. But serious political dramas set in Washington have been rare on television and, for that matter, in movies. Recent political films like ''The American President'' (written by Aaron Sorkin, who created ''The West Wing''), ''Bulworth'' and ''Primary Colors'' were box office disappointments. ''The Contender,'' a new political thriller, was a deflating No. 5 at the box office last weekend, grossing $5.5 million.</p>
        <p>Yet ''The West Wing,'' essentially a fantasy about an idealized president and his staff, has unexpectedly touched a nerve. Perhaps its timing is perfect.</p>
        <p>''It is a presidential year, and I think 'West Wing' reminds us of the candidates and politicians we wish we could have,'' said Peter Roth, president of Warner Brothers Television.</p>
        <p>President Bartlet, played by Martin Sheen, is a liberal New Hampshire Democrat and almost too good to be true: faithful to his wife, concerned for the poor and elderly, down to earth enough to cook chili for his staff, a gun control advocate and tough on terrorism.</p>
        <p>''Martin Sheen keeps outpolling the two presidential candidates,'' said John Wells, a creator of NBC's ''E.R.'' and one of the executive producers of ''The West Wing,'' along with Mr. Sorkin and the show's director, Thomas Schlamme.</p>
        <p>Still, the series's early success this season is probably not only a triumph of good timing and Emmy Awards. Numerous critics have applauded Mr. Sorkin's writing, Mr. Schlamme's directing and the actors who play White House officials: Allison Janney, John Spencer, Rob Lowe, Bradley Whitford and Richard Schiff.</p>
        <p>At the same time NBC, whose West Coast president, Scott Sassa, helped initiate the series, has aggressively marketed the show. The network built the audience in recent months through reruns of the first season during the summer, when many people saw the show for the first time.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sorkin, who writes virtually all the episodes although the show has a writing staff, said that the nine Emmy Awards, including the prize for best drama, stirred lavish publicity for ''West Wing,'' especially after it defeated HBO's acclaimed Mafia series, ''The Sopranos.'' And he ended last season with a cliffhanger, an assassination attempt against the president, further stirring interest.</p>
        <p>''The momentum of word of mouth is what finally lit the fire,'' said Mr. Sorkin, who said he had planned the final episode's assassination attempt from the start of the series.</p>
        <p>The show has been the most upscale series on network television, not only in terms of its writing and the issues it tackled but its audience. It is seen by more adults ages 18 to 49 who earn more than $100,000 a year than any other network series. But this season the audience is reaching beyond the elite.</p>
        <p>''I don't think people like to be told they're dumb,'' said Mr. Sorkin. ''The people who watch TV shows are at least as smart as the people who make them. The audience likes to feel that way. We're not patronizing the audience. We're not dumbing down the show in any way.''</p>
        <p>He added: ''The show provides a certain wish fulfillment. Generally in popular culture our political leaders have been portrayed as dolts or Machiavellian or evil. On 'West Wing' they're none of these.''</p>
        <p>The main criticism of the series has been that President Bartlet is almost too perfect, and that Mr. Sorkin's rat-a-tat writing style -- especially the White House staff dialogue -- is terse, often flip and makes many of the characters sound the same.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Sorkin has met current and former White House officials and Washington journalists and has hired as advisers former White House aides like Dee Dee Myers, who worked as press secretary for President Clinton, and Marlin Fitzwater, spokesman for Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush, who seek to give the show a patina of realism.</p>
        <p>Lawrence O'Donnell Jr., a former top aide to Senator Daniel P. Moynihan of New York and one of the staff writers on ''West Wing,'' said he was surprised by the show's success. ''This is fundamentally an office show where nothing really happens on the screen,'' he said. ''It probably violates every television convention. We don't have kids in an emergency ward or policemen shooting. If there's a space shuttle in trouble or an F.B.I. siege, it's off screen. You talk about it on screen. But the show just delivers the goods, week after week.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sorkin himself began working on the series after doing research for ''The American President'' (1995), whose chief executive, played by Michael Douglas, was as politically liberal, funny, decent and honest as the Martin Sheen character.</p>
        <p>In fact the series was almost delayed because the president was deemed too decent and forthright.</p>
        <p>''We were in the middle of the Monica Lewinsky scandal,'' said Mr. Sassa of NBC. ''People were skeptical about Washington. Was this the time to do the show?''</p>
        <p>He said that David Nevins, an associate at NBC who is now at the Fox Broadcasting Company, argued that there was similar skepticism in the early 1990's about hospitals. And then came ''E.R.'' with its heroic portrait of doctors and nurses.</p>
        <p>By all accounts there have been no substantive disputes between the network and Mr. Sorkin over the political issues raised on ''The West Wing'' and the essentially liberal Democratic nature of the fictional president. Conservatives have offered scant criticism of the show, which seems to go out of its way to present all sides of issues ranging from school vouchers to the Middle East.</p>
        <p>''All the network has asked us to do is present a very balanced view of an issue, to present both sides,'' said Mr. Wells. ''The only issue we don't do that on is gun control. Frankly, no one involved in the program feels there is a logical reason for streets to be flooded with Saturday night specials and automatic weapons.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Schlamme, who also directed Mr. Sorkin's last series, ''Sports Night,'' put it another way. ''If you do a show about politics, people have to represent a certain political allegiance,'' he said. ''If you do a show about cops, they have to shoot a gun; or a show about doctors, they have to save lives. You've got to be specific here. If you play it safe, there's not a chance the show would be successful.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sorkin, 39, who first gained fame with his Broadway drama ''A Few Good Men,'' said he worked six days a week, sometimes seven, starting at 6 a.m., writing scripts for the series in his office at Warner Brothers. He admitted he was a bit obsessed.</p>
        <p>What makes the series unusual, he said, is that the personal lives of the White House staff are not as important as their jobs.</p>
        <p>''Sure, we're interested in the guy getting the girl,'' but more important, ''they're in the White House,'' he said. ''And if we feel they're messing around and not applying attention to health care and other issues -- if we don't feel that first and foremost they are caring about us -- then the audience will turn on these characters so fast.</p>
        <p>''You have to keep your eyes on dials and gauges of this show. These characters are in the White House. They're there for us. And I have to remember that.''</p>
