        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>A photograph accompanying ''Exchanging Obesity's Risks for Surgery's'' (front page, Oct. 12) shows thin women parading in pants that are far too big for them. The caption reveals that these are not formerly obese people, but members of the American Society for Bariatric Surgery. These health care professionals are mocking their own patients.</p>
        <p>Weight-loss surgeons assert that they are saving lives, but their patients merely trade one set of health problems for another. The comic display of absurdly loose pants symbolizes the real reason for weight-loss surgery's popularity: fat people will do almost anything to escape society's contempt and ridicule.</p>
        <p>We must find a better way to deal with health risks and weight prejudice. Major surgery that very often fails; has serious, lifelong side effects; and kills one out of 200 patients should not be the cure for discrimination.</p>
        <p>MIRIAM BERG  President, Council on  Size and Weight Discrimination  Mount Marion, N.Y., Oct. 12, 2000</p>
