        <p>The natural beauty of this sprawling resort town on the Red Sea, framed by the mauve silhouettes of the mountains of the Sinai, inspires awe, and a sense of relaxation.</p>
        <p>But it would take a lot more than a sapphire blue sea and misty mountain contours to pacify Palestinians and Israelis as they attempted today to find common ground at an emergency summit meeting.</p>
        <p>Not that the hosts -- and assorted hotel employees and cheerfully gawking tourists in bathing suits and snorkeling masks -- did not try to lift the heavy pall of tension and suspicion.</p>
        <p>During an after-lunch break, for instance, President Clinton decided to take a stroll on the rolling greens behind the conference center, the Golf Resort, which in normal times operates as just that. President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt followed him into the sunshine. The Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat trailed after them.</p>
        <p>As they took in the fresh air, a young man in a baseball cap came running out of the resort, lugging a set of golf clubs over his shoulder, and caught up with the threesome just before they dipped out of sight behind a grassy hill. The offer of a quick round probably appealed to no one but Mr. Clinton. (Squash is Mr. Mubarak's game and Mr. Arafat is not known to indulge in any particular sport.) But the incongruity of the effort, during a day of high tension and palpable hostility, only served to emphasize the differences between this Middle East meeting and other, more cordial such meetings in recent years.</p>
        <p>A Gracious Host</p>
        <p>President Mubarak made a forceful public speech at the start of the talks in support of Palestinian grievances, condemning what he called Israeli ''aggression'' against the innocent and Israeli hard-liners who ''gamble with the people's interests.''</p>
        <p>In his private meetings with Mr. Arafat and Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel, however, the Egyptian was seen to be trying to encourage dialogue.</p>
        <p>''Mubarak was the host -- and he tried to act like a gracious host and not to criticize anyone too harshly,'' said an aide to one of the participants.</p>
        <p>Symbolism and Rumors</p>
        <p>Sharm el Sheik has deep symbolic significance to Mr. Mubarak. Under Israeli occupation from 1967 until 1980, the city and the entire Sinai Peninsula were recovered by Egypt after it became the first Arab nation to sign a peace treaty with Israel.</p>
        <p>President Mubarak, an air force pilot when Egypt attacked Israel in 1973, has often repeated the widely held belief here that Egypt's early success in that war restored its pride and allowed it to make peace.</p>
        <p>He has been the host of several summit meetings between Palestinians and Israelis with Sharm el Sheik -- and all its wartime and peace-making associations -- as the backdrop. Until this round, whose outcome is still unclear, he had been able to proclaim all of them successes of Egyptian diplomacy.</p>
        <p>Except for opening speeches, the actual work here took place inside the suites of the Golf Resort, with no reporters or cameras present. But rumors flew all day long of walkouts, shouting matches, insults and snubs.</p>
        <p>King Abdullah of Jordan, who arrived with a small contingent of government advisors, disappeared after lunch for a nap. The word spread among the hundreds of journalists waiting outside (and was later reported on Palestinian television) that he had left town in a huff. He had not.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak was not present for part of the official dinner. Had he packed up and headed for the airport after a nasty exchange with Mr. Arafat and King Abdullah? ''I can't say that it's true, but it could be,'' said one Israeli government official, when asked what had happened.</p>
        <p>Instead, it appeared that Mr. Barak had simply gone to his room to take a shower before dining.</p>
        <p>Spinners and Spokesmen</p>
        <p>Not that nasty exchanges did not occur in the hallways and suites of the Golf Resort.</p>
        <p>But whatever real battles took place in the official meetings, the sense that nothing could be accomplished there was nurtured by Israel's own phalanx of spinners and spokesmen. As unfazed tourists wandered past, smelling of suntan lotion and the sea, the Israeli officials passed out sheaves of color photographs showing Israeli victims of Palestinian violence over the past few weeks.</p>
        <p>Whenever he was asked how the talks were going, Nachman Shai, one Israeli spokesman, would frown and say, ''Things are not going well.'' He began saying that not long after the talks began.</p>
        <p>Other participants tried to put a more optimistic face on the sometimes bitter wrangling. Javier Solana, the foreign affairs director for the European Union, said that at least lunch seemed to go well.</p>
        <p>All seven of the leaders taking part in the talks -- Mr. Clinton, Mr. Mubarak, Mr. Barak, Mr. Arafat, Abdullah, Mr. Solana and United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan -- sat at a round table, he said. The issues at hand -- whether Mr. Arafat would call a halt to the attacks by Palestinians on Israeli soldiers in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and whether Mr. Barak would redeploy his army so that those in Palestinian areas could resume normal life -- were not discussed.</p>
        <p>True, Mr. Solana added, it was not the warmest social gathering, but President Clinton tried his best. ''It was very convivial,'' Mr. Solana recalled. ''You know Mr. Clinton is very good at that kind of thing.''</p>
