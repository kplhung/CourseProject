        <p>The Jets were playful, tossing back at Al Groh his own motivational tactic: ''They teased me with it, 'Why can't we win a game, 34-17?' ''</p>
        <p>The Jets could afford to laugh Sunday about Groh's latest successful attempt to spark them. Their psyches were fragile and hesitant after an unsettling loss to the Steelers. Victor Green said a loss to New England could have sent the season downhill. Players wondered whether Vinny Testaverde could survive another hit.</p>
        <p>Groh tried the 46 flashlights routine and insulted the offensive line and it responded with a devastating game in which it pushed New England so far off the line of scrimmage that Curtis Martin (34 carries, 143 yards) frequently ran untouched. But Groh's masterstroke this week was simply to wonder: ''Why not win big?''</p>
        <p>''The thought struck me during practice one day that I expected this would be a tough, grind-it-out type of game, the kind of game that going in looks like 21-17 games,'' Groh said. ''Then I was thinking sometimes when you try to paint that picture, that's the kind of game it's going to be. You're defining the game before it happens. Maybe you're putting limitations on what you expect from your team. Just because it's a tough opponent, who is to say we can't establish a little bit of a margin?''</p>
        <p>Groh did not sense any fragility among his players, he says, because he is unerringly focused on what it will take to win, rather than on what might happen if the Jets lose. Still, the loss to Pittsburgh, the first and only one of the season after four straight victories, irritated him enough to say, ''I was a little tired of losing.''</p>
        <p>So Groh and his coordinators created a perfect game plan that resulted in the victory that tied them at 5-1 atop the A.F.C. East with the Miami Dolphins, who will be in the Meadowlands Monday night. The Patriots knew the Jets, with Testaverde's health a concern and his production faltering (his quarterback rating is 66.6, third lowest in the conference), would run. But with the motivated offensive line bludgeoning the Patriots' defense, Martin had huge holes to run through.</p>
        <p>And the Jets had held in reserve a back-breaking play they first began practicing during their bye week, a fake field goal in which linebacker Mo Lewis lines up in the backfield and takes a pitch from the holder Tom Tupa. The Jets practiced it only three or four times last week, but that play -- like the desperation touchdown pass to Marcus Coleman against Buffalo and the halfback option pass from Martin to Wayne Chrebet against Tampa Bay -- captures a certain riverboat-gambler mind-set on a coaching staff willing to take a risk. ''Just a wild and crazy guy,'' Groh said, deadpan. ''Who'd have thunk it?''</p>
        <p>Lewis, who has been an every-down player for most of his career, has quietly grumbled about his reduced appearances in the nickel package this season because of the rapid development of the rookie John Abraham (two sacks and one forced fumble against the Patriots).</p>
        <p>Groh likes to rotate players consistently and he took Lewis out on passing situations to give him a break and to give Abraham a chance. This week, Groh put Lewis back on the field in passing situations. Lewis, the franchise player, was extraordinary. He threw Drew Bledsoe for a 12-yard sack, tipped the pass that Green intercepted and returned for a touchdown, intercepted a pass himself and, oh, by the way, had five tackles.</p>
        <p>''If Mo was a catcher playing doubleheaders in 95-degree heat, he'd want to catch every inning,'' Groh said.</p>
        <p>After a game that impressive, the Jets should have played two.</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>The Jets suffered multiple injuries whose seriousness will not be known until later in the week. JOHN ABRAHAM has an abdominal muscle pull, although AL GROH said he knew nothing about a shoulder injury that Abraham referred to in postgame comments. Tight end ANTHONY BECHT left in the first quarter with a sprained left knee and did not return. Groh said his circumstances are ''iffy'' but there was no possibility of surgery. The running back and special teams player BERNIE PARMALEE has a hamstring pull.</p>
