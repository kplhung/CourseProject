        <p>The International Olympic Committee's medical commission recommended yesterday that the gold medal be taken from a German freestyle wrestler because he tested positive for the steroid nandrolone at the Summer Games in Sydney, Australia.</p>
        <p>If the I.O.C.'s executive board upholds the commission's ruling on Alexander Leipold, the gold medal in the 167.5-pound class will be awarded to an American, Brandon Slay.</p>
        <p>Leipold would become the third athlete at the Sydney Games to lose a gold medal because of a drug offense.</p>
        <p>''I have always dreamed of and worked toward the goal of winning an Olympic gold medal,'' Slay said in a statement. ''But this certainly wasn't the way I dreamed of doing it.</p>
        <p>''If silver turns to gold this way, I don't know how to feel. My dream was to win gold on the mat.''</p>
        <p>Another American, Tara Nott, received a gold medal in weight lifting after Izabela Dragneva of Bulgaria was disqualified.</p>
        <p>C. J. Hunter, the American shot-putter who withdrew from the Olympics because of arthroscopic knee surgery, tested positive in July for nandrolone, but blamed the elevated level of the drug in his system on a mislabeled nutritional supplement.</p>
        <p>After leaving the I.O.C. hearing in Lausanne, Switzerland, Leipold said that nandrolone is ''not the kind of drug you take for wrestling.''</p>
        <p>''You wrestle for 26 years and you make medals step by step,'' he said. ''In Germany, I'm always tested out of competition. Every time, I'm clean.''</p>
        <p>But Prince Alexander de Merode, chairman of the medical commission, said Leipold's drug sample showed 20 nanograms of nandrolone per milliliter of urine, or 10 times the established limit.</p>
        <p>''When you find 10 times more than the fixed limit, we believe the case is clear,'' de Merode said.</p>
        <p>After Slay lost to Leipold, 4-0, he protested that the referee had unfairly penalized him for 3 points. The initial 2-point penalty was assessed because Slay allegedly did not follow the referee's instructions to get into a clinch.</p>
        <p>''I gave him plenty of opportunity to get into his lock,'' Slay said of Leipold shortly after the match. ''But he started whining and crying like a baby.''</p>
        <p>In anger, Slay refused to let his hand be held up by the referee as Leipold was pronounced the winner. Now, Slay is likely to be named the winner.</p>
        <p>''Obviously, we're excited about the prospect of having a champion and we're proud of Brandon,'' said Gary Abbott, a spokesman for USA Wrestling. ''But it's not a final decision yet. We'll have a statement when the I.O.C. makes a decision.''</p>
