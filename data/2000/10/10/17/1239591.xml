        <p>The Yankees will be in a far superior position to line up their World Series pitching rotation if they can beat the Seattle Mariners tonight in Game 6 of the American League Championship Series. But if they don't, then it is possible that Roger Clemens will pitch in Shea Stadium in the World Series in what would most likely be a highly confrontational atmosphere.</p>
        <p>Orlando Hernandez starts tonight's game, and if the Yankees win and advance to the World Series, he would not be fully rested to pitch Game 1 on Saturday at Yankee Stadium. The Yankees might opt to pitch the left-hander Andy Pettitte in Game 1, then Clemens in Game 2 in the Stadium on Sunday. Games 3, 4 and 5 will be in the National League park, and Hernandez would go in Game 3 and either Denny Neagle or David Cone in Game 4. Pettitte, Clemens and Hernandez would then be in line to pitch Games 5, 6 and 7, respectively, if necessary.</p>

        <p>The Yankees will be in a far superior position to line up their World Series pitching rotation if they can beat the Seattle Mariners tonight in Game 6 of the American League Championship Series. But if they don't, then it is possible that Roger Clemens will pitch in Shea Stadium in the World Series in what would most likely be a highly confrontational atmosphere.</p>
        <p>Orlando Hernandez starts tonight's game, and if the Yankees win and advance to the World Series, he would not be fully rested to pitch Game 1 on Saturday at Yankee Stadium. The Yankees might opt to pitch the left-hander Andy Pettitte in Game 1, then Clemens in Game 2 in the Stadium on Sunday. Games 3, 4 and 5 will be in the National League park, and Hernandez would go in Game 3 and either Denny Neagle or David Cone in Game 4. Pettitte, Clemens and Hernandez would then be in line to pitch Games 5, 6 and 7, respectively, if necessary.</p>
        <p>There would be several advantages to lining it up that way for the Yankees. By pitching Clemens in Games 2 and 6, Manager Joe Torre would ensure that Clemens would not have to bat in the National League park, eliminating any chance of a direct retaliation from his July 8 beaning of the Mets' Mike Piazza. Torre acknowledged over the weekend that the next time Clemens batted in Shea, everybody would be holding his breath.</p>
        <p>Clemens has also pitched much better at home than on the road in his two years with the Yankees -- 17-9 at Yankee Stadium, 10-9 on the road.</p>
        <p>Torre has long believed Game 3 to be the most pivotal game of any seven-game series, and has tried to line up his best pitcher for that game in the past. He could have Hernandez, undefeated in the postseason, pitching in Game 3, and then the decisive Game 7, if necessary.</p>
        <p>If the Yankees lose tonight, however, Pettitte will have to pitch Game 7 of the A.L.C.S., and if the Yankees advanced, Clemens would be the only fully rested pitcher among the Yankees' primary three starters. If he pitched Game 1, Hernandez would start Game 2, and Pettitte Game 3.</p>
        <p>Neagle has been serviceable as the No. 4 starter so far, but the one reason Torre might consider the right-handed Cone is that the Mets' lineup is primarily right-handed. It figures that Torre would still go with Neagle for the simple reason that Cone has not pitched into the sixth inning of any game since Sept. 15. That might leave Clemens for Game 5 at the National League park.</p>
