        <p>China Unicom, the country's second-largest telecommunications carrier, and the Shenzhen Zhongxing Telecom Company, a large Chinese telecommunications equipment maker, will sell and produce wireless handsets using technology patented by Qualcomm. Under the agreement, China Unicom will sell a dual-mode wireless phone produced by Shenzhen that will function using Qualcomm's code division multiple access, or CDMA, technology, in addition to a rival wireless technological standard, global system for mobile communications, or GSM. The agreement advances Qualcomm's ambitions in Asia by apparently easing tension in a techno-political drama in which the American company was relentlessly lobbying high-level Chinese officials as it tried to gain a foothold in that nation's wireless industry. Investors yesterday bid up Qualcomm shares by nearly 8 percent, to $77.</p>
