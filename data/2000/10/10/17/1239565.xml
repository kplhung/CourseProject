        <p>Seeking to end what he called a pattern of discrimination against Hispanic voters in Passaic County, a court-appointed election monitor said yesterday that he had ordered the printing of bilingual voter education pamphlets and the recruitment of Spanish-speaking poll workers.</p>
        <p>The monitor, Walter F. Timpone, was appointed by a federal judge in Newark last month, following a 1998 lawsuit filed against the county by the Justice Department.</p>
        <p>The department filed the suit after an investigation into civil rights complaints by Hispanic residents charging they had been discouraged from voting in the communities of Passaic, Paterson, Clifton, Haledon and Prospect Park by the absence of bilingual poll workers and voting materials, and by intimidation from poll workers and off-duty Passaic County sheriff's officers.</p>
        <p>Among the monitor's orders was a prohibition against off-duty law enforcement officers working the polls.</p>
        <p>''They had sheriff's officers working at the polls who were saying things like, 'Didn't I arrest you last week? Why are you trying to vote?' '' said Mr. Timpone, 49, a former assistant United States attorney for New Jersey who is now in private practice.</p>
        <p>''They believe, the perception is, that 7 out of 10 Hispanics will vote Democratic,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Timpone was appointed, with authority to hire and fire election workers, after municipal elections in May and the June primary, during which federal election observers reported that the county ignored a consent order it had signed in June 1999 calling for the same reforms that Mr. Timpone announced yesterday.</p>
        <p>Sheriff Edwin Englehardt, a Republican, did not respond to a request seeking comment. Members of the county Board of Freeholders, which is composed of four Democrats and three Republicans, also did not respond.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, Mr. Timpone said he was encouraged by a resolution adopted unanimously last week by the county freeholders recommending that law enforcement officers be barred from working the polls to ''avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest.''</p>
        <p>Maritza Berdote Byrne, president of the Hispanic Bar Association of New Jersey, said her organization has worked with Mr. Timpone to recruit Spanish speakers to work the polls on Nov. 7, and to arrange appearances before Hispanic organizations and church congregations to spread the word that voter intimidation would not be tolerated.</p>
        <p>''We hope that everybody will come out and see that the courts are really behind ensuring their voting rights,'' she said. ''But that remains to be seen.''</p>
