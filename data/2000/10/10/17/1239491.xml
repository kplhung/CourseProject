        <p>Laying claim to the most basic of shared values, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman said today that his and Vice President Al Gore's policies stemmed from fundamental American and religious principles.</p>

        <p>Laying claim to the most basic of shared values, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman said today that his and Vice President Al Gore's policies stemmed from fundamental American and religious principles.</p>
        <p>Referring to such disparate sources as the Ten Commandments and the Declaration of Independence and precedents as varied as the civil rights movement and the creation of Medicare, Mr. Lieberman sought to present the Democrats as most in tune with the beliefs of most Americans on issues like health care, education and fiscal discipline.</p>
        <p>''The fact is that we worked for civil rights and we work, for instance, as we are now, for protections against hate crimes because we all are created by God, and as a result, every citizen deserves to be treated with the same respect and dignity,'' he told an enthusiastic crowd of more than 1,000 residents of Century Village, a retirement community here. ''We provide health coverage to our seniors, in some ways, as an expression of the basic idea that's true to all religions and all groups, which is to honor our fathers and our mothers, our grandfathers and our grandmothers.''</p>
        <p>The senator's aides billed his remarks, in a speech and question-and-answer session here, as the start of a bid to portray his ticket's platform as a coherent vision rather than merely a string of disconnected proposals.</p>
        <p>''Our leadership and our laws, at their best, must flow from our values and reflect the basic principles that America is all about,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Campaign officials believe that part of Mr. Lieberman's value to the ticket is as someone who speaks with moral authority: a religious Jew who has campaigned against violence and vulgarity in popular culture and who was the first prominent member of his party to criticize President Clinton's behavior in his relationship with a White House intern.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman's remarks today are an attempt to tap again into that perceived authority. The senator spoke frequently about his faith and its connection to his values in the first month after he was chosen as Mr. Gore's running mate, but he has said less about the subject since then.</p>
        <p>Part of Mr. Lieberman's shift in tone meant softening the criticism of Gov. George W. Bush that has been a standard part of his stump speech, though that criticism was hardly absent. He belittled Mr. Bush's proposed tax cuts and his prescription drug plan for retirees. The Bush drug plan would give money to the states in the early years to cover only some of the elderly poor, and would then rely on vouchers to help people buy private insurance coverage -- coverage that Mr. Lieberman said the insurers would not be willing to sell.</p>
        <p>''The Bush-Cheney prescription drug plan for seniors, middle-class seniors, comes down to this: wait four years and then call your H.M.O. in the morning,'' Mr. Lieberman said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore has proposed a prescription drug benefit under Medicare, available to all older people, though recipients would still be liable for up to $4,000 a year in expenses for medications.</p>
        <p>Several people here told of having far higher costs and said they welcomed Mr. Gore's plan; one woman said her prescriptions cost her $7,000 a year, none covered by her insurance.</p>
        <p>''It really comes down to life and death,'' said Sam Oser, who also said his insurance company dropped him because his drug costs exceeded $5,000 a year. ''We are senior citizens here. We cannot wait forever.''</p>
