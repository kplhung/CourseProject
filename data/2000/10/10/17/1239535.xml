        <p>Miami Heat center Alonzo Mourning, the best defensive player in the National Basketball Association the last two years, is suffering from a serious kidney disease and will miss the entire season receiving treatment, he and his doctors announced at a news conference in Miami yesterday.</p>
        <p>Mourning, a 30-year-old All-Star center, will undergo treatments for the condition, focal glomerulosclerosis, within the next six months to see whether his system can first respond to medicine to forestall the need for dialysis or a kidney transplant. But medicinal treatment leads to remission in about 50 percent of patients, at best, said Dr. Gerald B. Appel, the director of clinical nephrology at the Columbia-Presbyterian Center in Manhattan.</p>

        <p>Miami Heat center Alonzo Mourning, the best defensive player in the National Basketball Association the last two years, is suffering from a serious kidney disease and will miss the entire season receiving treatment, he and his doctors announced at a news conference in Miami yesterday.</p>
        <p>Mourning, a 30-year-old All-Star center, will undergo treatments for the condition, focal glomerulosclerosis, within the next six months to see whether his system can first respond to medicine to forestall the need for dialysis or a kidney transplant. But medicinal treatment leads to remission in about 50 percent of patients, at best, said Dr. Gerald B. Appel, the director of clinical nephrology at the Columbia-Presbyterian Center in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>While doctors caught Mourning's condition early, he could still need a transplant. He has the same disease that San Antonio Spurs forward Sean Elliott had. Elliott had a transplant in 1999, six years after he was found to have the condition, and returned to basketball last season, six months after his brother, Noel, had donated a kidney to him.</p>
        <p>At the news conference, which was held at American Airlines Arena, Mourning flashed a grin and the thumbs-up sign.</p>
        <p>''It's been a tough week and a half, just listening to all the information that has been given to me,'' he said. ''I feel great right now. We've pretty much got a hold on it, the whole situation right now. The main objective is to get me healthy so I can live my life normally, so I can see my babies grow up and so I can enjoy my family.''</p>
        <p>The disease attacks small filters in the kidney that remove waste from the blood, causing protein to spill into the urine and scar the kidney. The disease, while not especially common, tends to affect younger men, with more prevalence in African-Americans, Appel said. He believed that Mourning did not develop the disease as a result of steroid use, drug abuse, H.I.V., or anti-inflammatory drugs.</p>
        <p>Mourning, who finished third in the league's most valuable player voting last season, having averaged 21.7 points, 9.6 rebounds and a league-best 3.7 blocks a game, won a gold medal with the United States Olympic team in the Sydney Games in September. But even on the flight home (his second in 10 days after he returned to Miami during the Olympics to witness the birth of his daughter) Mourning complained of swelling in his feet and legs, one symptom of the disease.</p>
        <p>When he returned, Mourning took a routine team physical that included a blood test that hinted at a kidney problem, said Dr. Victor Richards of the Miami Kidney Group, the main specialist treating Mourning. Richards consulted with Appel and four leading experts in the disease at a convention last weekend, and they came to the same conclusion.</p>
        <p>Mourning will take immune suppressants to try to stop the kidneys from leaking proteins, as well as medication to reduce the swelling and control high blood pressure and high cholesterol. He will also go on a low sodium diet.</p>
        <p>''He needs a little bit of luck,'' said Dr. Leonard Stern, Appel's colleague and a nephrologist at Columbia-Presbyterian. ''He has to respond to the medicine, be able to tolerate it long enough so he can have the desired effect of sustaining the remission. A year of these medicines is very difficult. Some have trouble, others sail right through it. That's why he needs luck. He has a positive attitude and that's in his favor.''</p>
        <p>But the statistics do not seem to be overwhelmingly in Mourning's favor. According to Dr. Ronald Falk, the chief of nephrology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, the 50 percent chance that medicines work is a high estimate.</p>
        <p>''We really don't know what treatment works,'' Falk said.</p>
        <p>''There is no cure yet. Some people have had spontaneous remissions. But I would say 50 percent is extremely high, and that 25 percent would be really good.</p>
        <p>''This is a particularly bad disease,'' Falk added. ''But the peculiar part and what's worrisome is that it is much more common in African-Americans and it is becoming a mini-epidemic. Sean Elliott and Alonzo Mourning are only the tip of the iceberg.''</p>
        <p>During this past summer, Pat Riley, Miami's coach and team president, aggressively reconstructed the team around Mourning, adding power forwards Brian Grant and Anthony Mason in an attempt to get past the Knicks in the playoffs and vie for a championship.</p>
        <p>''Alonzo is one of the premier defense centers in the league, and now Pat has to go with a smaller lineup,'' Boston Celtics Coach Rick Pitino said during a conference call. ''Certainly losing the best defensive player in the league brings them down to the rest of the teams in the conference. Now he is just one of the favorites, rather than the favorite.''</p>
        <p>And while Riley and his staff are making plans to play without Mourning, yesterday Riley was clearly not thinking about filling the pivot.</p>
        <p>''We are totally convinced that the only thing that should be on Alonzo's mind and our mind is getting him healthy,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Heat guard Eddie Jones said: ''That's our gladiator, our guy. We're all rooting for him to beat this. Basketball-wise, it's going to be tough not to have Zo not doing it. But we've got to do it collectively now.''</p>
        <p>Center Duane Causwell will replace Mourning, but Grant and Mason could play some pivot as well, unless Riley chooses to place Mason at small forward.</p>
        <p>Since Mourning will miss this season, the Heat will apply for a medical exception for Mourning's salary. But an independent doctor appointed by the N.B.A. must first examine Mourning's case.</p>
        <p>If the league approves the exception, it would give the Heat a $3.88 million exception to the salary cap.</p>
        <p>''Without Zo, everything changes,'' point guard Tim Hardaway said. ''It's going to be like that for the whole season. Nobody's going to give us any pity. They're going to take it to us.''</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Mourning said he was touched by all the cards and calls he has received, but emphasized that he did not want sympathy. ''What's going to get me through it is everybody being very positive and upbeat around me,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Elliott said yesterday he had spoken with Mourning.</p>
        <p>''I know how he feels right now as far as fatigue-wise,'' Elliott said yesterday from San Antonio. ''When I first went to the doctor, I felt terrible. I can sympathize with him.''</p>
        <p>Whereas Elliott's condition led to renal failure, Mourning's kidney function right now is good, Appel said.</p>
        <p>He said, ''I feel that with Alonzo's good attitude on this, good efforts by the team of his doctors and everybody else, we should be able to achieve success here.''</p>
