        <p>Cashing in on a seemingly insatiable demand for business travel, Continental Airlines said yesterday that its third-quarter profit rose 32 percent, surpassing Wall Street expectations.</p>
        <p>Continental, the nation's fifth-largest airline, was the first large carrier to report earnings for the quarter. But some analysts warned that profits for the industry over all would not be as strong as in the last quarter because of the rise in oil prices.</p>
        <p>Continental said that it earned $137 million, or $2.24 a diluted share, excluding a $2 million charge, compared with $104 million, or $1.44 a share, in the period a year earlier. Revenue rose 16 percent, to $2.62 billion from $2.26 billion. Analysts had expected Continental to earn  $2.19 a share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial.</p>
        <p>Continental executives estimated that the airline got a boost of about $20 million, or 20 cents a share, from this summer's disruption at United Airlines, whose on-time performance plunged and cancellations soared because of bad weather and protests by its pilots. United announced last month that it would lose money in the third and fourth quarters.</p>
        <p>Gordon M. Bethune, Continental's chairman, said that most of the gains came from the demand for seats by high-paying business travelers, which did not flag in the quarter despite five fare increases so far this year. Continental's load factor, or the percentage of its seats that were filled, rose to a record 77.5 percent, while the average fare the company received rose 8.8 percent.</p>
        <p>''Maybe we are not charging enough,'' Mr. Bethune said after being asked whether he saw any weakness in the demand for seats.</p>
        <p>But Samuel C. Buttrick, an analyst at PaineWebber in New York, said, ''Continental's solid profit growth in the quarter is not representative of industry results for the period.'' He estimated that overall airline profits fell 11 percent to 12 percent in the quarter compared with results in the quarter a year earlier.</p>
        <p>Continental not only benefited from turmoil at United, it also successfully hedged itself against the rise in oil prices. American Airlines, which is the second-largest carrier after United and its chief rival, is also expected to beat earnings estimates for the quarter. Southwest Airlines, the low-fare king, is also expected to exceed forecasts because of its strong hedging strategy and cost controls.</p>
        <p>Glenn Engel, an airline analyst at Goldman, Sachs, said he had raised his revenue estimates for many airlines over the summer because the strong economy was fueling demand for business travel. But at the same time, he was raising his cost estimates as oil prices rose.</p>
        <p>''The question for airline analysts is which will come down more quickly, fuel or the economy?'' he said. ''Three months ago, I would have said fuel will come down quicker. Today, I am not so sure.''</p>
        <p>Because business travelers pay the highest fares but also book their tickets at the last minute, it is difficult to forecast airline earnings. A softening economy could quickly translate into a decline in corporate travel.</p>
        <p>''As profit growth slows, intuitively one would expect corporations to exert stronger cost controls than they have in recent years,'' Mr. Buttrick said. ''Travel often makes the short list of discretionary items to be curtailed.''</p>
        <p>Though he does not yet see any evidence of such cutbacks, Mr. Buttrick thinks that most earnings estimates for the fourth quarter are too high.</p>
        <p>A new tentative contract reached by United with its pilots also promises to add to rising cost pressures in the industry. Delta Air Lines' 10,000 pilots announced on Friday that they were seeking salary increases that would surpass the generous increases at United.</p>
        <p>Such concerns have driven down the price of airline stocks to levels that frustrate many executives who feel that they are not getting credit from investors for maintaining profits.</p>
        <p>Shares of Continental rose 19 cents yesterday, to $42.69. Shares of UAL, the parent of United, fell 50 cents, to $37.88 AMR, the parent of American Airlines, rose 50 cents, to $30.38.</p>
        <p>''Five years ago, I would have never believed that Continental would have a record quarter with oil at $35 a barrel,'' Mr. Engel said. ''The next test is an economic downturn. Until they get through that, people are going to always look for another reason why airline earnings can't stay high.''</p>
