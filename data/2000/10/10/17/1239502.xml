        <p>The Supreme Court agreed today to decide whether Congress violated the Constitution in the early 1980's by imposing Social Security taxes for the first time on the salaries of federal judges.</p>
        <p>If the justices agree with a lower federal court that the action was unconstitutional, they must then decide whether the violation is ongoing -- possibly entitling large numbers of judges to substantial tax refunds -- or whether Congress cured the problem with a raise for judges in 1984 that left them with more take-home pay than they had before the Social Security withholding started.</p>
        <p>The unusual case is obviously of considerable interest to the federal judiciary; nearly 100 judges have filed or joined lawsuits alleging that the new tax violated the Compensation Clause of Article III of the Constitution. That clause, inserted by the framers to protect judicial independence, provides that the compensation of life-tenured federal judges ''shall not be diminished during their continuance in office.''</p>
        <p>The constitutional question is whether the Compensation Clause is violated even by extending to judges a tax that already applies to nearly everyone else, or whether the framers meant only to prevent the selective placement of financial burdens on federal judges.</p>
        <p>While some of the country's best-known judges are among the plaintiffs, no Supreme Court justices have joined the lawsuits. Justices John Paul Stevens and Sandra Day O'Connor recused themselves from participating in the case. Both were members of the Supreme Court when the Social Security taxes took effect and could theoretically be entitled to refunds if the plaintiffs' broadest remedial theory prevails.</p>
        <p>No other member of the court is in this position. While five justices -- all the rest except Justices Clarence Thomas and David H. Souter -- were federal judges when the taxes took effect, they have all since received  promotions to the Supreme Court or, in the case of William H. Rehnquist, promotion to chief justice. These intervening appointments mean that if there was an initial violation, it is no longer continuing for this group of justices. Since they all have been in their current positions for longer than the six-year statute of limitations that applies to suits against the United States, they could not bring suit for the past violation either.</p>
        <p>In 1996, when an earlier phase of the case reached the Supreme Court, the six-year statute of limitations had not yet expired for Justices Ginsburg and Breyer. They joined Justices Stevens and O'Connor in recusing themselves, leaving only five justices -- one short of a quorum -- in a position to hear the case.</p>
        <p>Under the court's rules, the result of the court's inability to hear the case at that time was to affirm automatically, without issuing an opinion, a 1995 ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit that the imposition of the taxes violated the Compensation Clause. But since the Supreme Court agreed today to revisit that question, the justices evidently do not consider the earlier summary affirmance to be binding precedent. And it is obvious that the justices rejected an argument made by the judicial plaintiffs that once a judge is recused from considering a case, the recusal applies to all future proceedings in that case, even if the original reason for the recusal no longer applies.</p>
        <p>The case began 11 years ago when eight federal judges, soon joined by eight others, filed suit over the extension to the judiciary of two Social Security programs and the taxes. The Medicare tax began on Jan. 1, 1983, and the tax for the basic Social Security old age, survivors and disability program began on Jan. 1, 1984. Ten other lawsuits, involving more than 80 judges, followed.</p>
        <p>Judges were previously excluded from Social Security coverage because they are entitled to their full salaries in retirement, but Congress decided to include many previously exempt federal employees in the Social Security system to shore up the program's financial base.</p>
        <p>The judges' lawsuit has produced eight opinions so far. The most recent ruling was issued last February by all 10 judges of the Federal Circuit, a specialized appeals court here with nationwide jurisdiction that hears cases involving financial claims against the government. In that court's view, the Compensation Clause is being violated on a continuing basis by the imposition of the taxes on judges who were free of them when they first assumed the bench. The effect of the court's decision was to declare unconstitutional the acts of Congress that extended the taxes, leading the government to file a Supreme Court appeal, United States v. Hatter, No. 99-1978.</p>
        <p>There were these other developments at the court today.</p>
        <p>Voting Rights</p>
        <p>The court affirmed, without a written opinion, a ruling by a special three-judge Federal District Court here that rejected an array of constitutional arguments on behalf of representation for the District of Columbia in the House of Representatives.</p>
        <p>Two groups of civic leaders and other district residents had filed separate lawsuits, taking different approaches to the common goal of giving district residents a constitutional right to vote for a fully privileged member of Congress. The district's delegate to the House is not entitled to a vote; residents may vote for  president.</p>
        <p>The Constitution provides that members of the House shall be chosen by ''the people of the several states.'' In rejecting the lawsuits by a 2-to-1 decision, the three-judge panel found the Constitution's text, and the history of the District of Columbia, presented an insurmountable obstacle to the plaintiffs' arguments.</p>
        <p>The plaintiffs maintained that it was time to take a fresh look at the history. When the district was created, one group of plaintiffs told the justices, it had only 14,000 residents, fewer than half the 30,000 required as the smallest permissible Congressional district. But now the district has half a million people.</p>
        <p>Justice Stevens voted to hear the appeal in one of the cases, Alexander v. Mineta, No. 99-2062. The other case was Adams v. Clinton, No. 00-97.</p>
        <p>Petty Offenses</p>
        <p>The court turned down an opportunity to decide whether people charged with petty crimes -- those carrying sentences of six months or less -- are constitutionally entitled to a jury trial.</p>
        <p>The Constitution twice refers to the right to a jury trial applying to ''all crimes'' or ''all criminal prosecutions.'' But for more than a century, Supreme Court cases have assumed, without directly confronting the issue, that the right does not apply to minor offenses.</p>
        <p>The challenge was brought by a man charged in the District of Columbia with malicious destruction of property, a misdemeanor. He was convicted and sentenced to 180 days in prison by a judge who denied his request for a jury trial. The District of Columbia Court of Appeals said it lacked authority to revisit Supreme Court precedents on the issue. The case was Harrison v. U.S., No. 99-9003.</p>
