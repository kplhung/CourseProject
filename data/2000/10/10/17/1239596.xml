        <p>Noticeably more placid than most of his Champagne-spraying teammates, the Mets rookie Jay Payton stood stationary in the clubhouse at Shea Stadium following the team's pennant-clinching 7-0 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals last night. A teammate with a bottle in his hand ran up to him and shouted, ''You should have kicked his butt.''</p>
        <p>Payton just smiled. A few minutes before, in the bottom of the eighth inning, Payton was hit in the face and cut by a pitch from Dave Veres. With blood streaming from a cut above his left eye, Payton charged toward the mound and both teams streamed from their benches. It seemed as if an ugly fight might mar the game.</p>

        <p>Noticeably more placid than most of his Champagne-spraying teammates, the Mets rookie Jay Payton stood stationary in the clubhouse at Shea Stadium following the team's pennant-clinching 7-0 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals last night. A teammate with a bottle in his hand ran up to him and shouted, ''You should have kicked his butt.''</p>
        <p>Payton just smiled. A few minutes before, in the bottom of the eighth inning, Payton was hit in the face and cut by a pitch from Dave Veres. With blood streaming from a cut above his left eye, Payton charged toward the mound and both teams streamed from their benches. It seemed as if an ugly fight might mar the game.</p>
        <p>But his teammates and manager restrained him. In the celebration afterward, Payton wore an adhesive bandage over the cut, which was rising into a big lump and starting to discolor the area around the eye. Any stitches?</p>
        <p>''Not yet,'' Payton said. ''I will.''</p>
        <p>What did he think when the pitch hit him?</p>
        <p>''When you get hit in the head, it hurts and, with the anger inside you, you really don't think about the pain or anything else,'' Payton said. ''My emotions got ahold of me. You want to tear somebody apart. But that wasn't the time or place for it.''</p>
        <p>One of the persons holding him back was Benny Agbayani, a teammate and fellow outfielder. Another was Bobby Valentine, the manager. ''The last time I got hit in the face was in Triple A and Bobby was the manager there,'' Payton said with a smile.</p>
        <p>It was the second pitch toward his head in the same time at bat. Did he think the pitcher was trying to hit him?</p>
        <p>''You never know,'' Payton said. ''I like to think he didn't. A couple guys on the team told me he's a pretty good guy. So be it. Hopefully, there's no ill will. There's no ill will on my part.''</p>
        <p>Turk Wendell, the relief pitcher, said the incident ''Really ticked off a lot of guys and I was one of the guys.'' According to Wendell, the St. Louis pitcher ''should have said 'I'm sorry.'</p>
        <p>''It might have hurt him for the World Series,'' Wendell said. ''He has been a pivotal player for this team.'' Agbayani said ''I was stunned. I couldn't believe it. I saw the blood dripping from his eye.''</p>
        <p>There was no retaliation by the Mets and pitcher Mike Hampton when the Cardinals batted for the final time in the ninth inning. Steve Phillips, the Mets general manager, said: ''I'm glad cooler heads prevailed on both sides. It was all about baseball in the ninth inning.''</p>
        <p>After discussing the incident, Payton and others kept returning to the larger news of the night: The Mets are in the World Series, against either the Yankees or Seattle.</p>
        <p>''We're going to the World Series,'' Payton said. ''I'd take a shot to the head every year to get to the World Series.''</p>
