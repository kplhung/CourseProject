        <p>Reversal on Terror Attack  Yemen's government, which had denied that the deadly blast that damaged the destroyer Cole was a terrorist attack, denounced the attack as ''a premeditated criminal act'' and said 1,500 people had been questioned in a police sweep.</p>

        <p>A20-29</p>
        <p>Campaigns Intensifying Pace of TV Ad Spending  The Gore and Bush campaigns, their parties and outside groups spent a total of $18.5 million on television ads in just the last week of September and the first week of October. The bulk of that money, $14.5 million, was spent in six highly contested states: Florida, Michigan, Missouri, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>Debate Moderator Under Fire  Jim Lehrer of PBS, the moderator of all three presidential debates, has drawn criticism from partisans and analysts who say he has not pressed the candidates and was not aggressive enough in following up his questions. He rejected the criticism.</p>
        <p>A27</p>
        <p>Vice President Al Gore gathered nearly two dozen people near St. Louis to help prepare for his third and final campaign debate tonight with Gov. George W. Bush. Their message was, be yourself. The debate will be in a town-meeting format, with questions from the audience.</p>
        <p>A27</p>
        <p>Senator Joseph I. Lieberman said that his and Mr. Gore's policies stemmed from fundamental American and religious principles. He cited such disparate sources as the Ten Commandments and the Declaration of Independence and precedents as varied as the civil rights movement and the creation of Medicare.</p>
        <p>A28</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush, campaigning in Arkansas, derided Mr. Gore as an old-time Democrat who favors big government, a theme he promised to strike in tonight's debate.</p>
        <p>A28</p>
        <p>Dick Cheney continued to press his case for maintaining a strong military even in peace, invoking not only the attack on the destroyer Cole but also the hostage crisis in Iran and President Jimmy Carter's ill-fated effort to rescue the captives.</p>
        <p>A28</p>
        <p>Family Gathering on the Mall  Tens of thousands heeded Minister Louis Farrakhan's call and gathered in Washington in a daylong commitment to renewing family solidarity as a force in American life.</p>

        <p>Reports of Corruption Prompt Dominican Inquiry  The newly elected government of the Dominican Republic is investigating complaints that the Dominican consulate in Manhattan has been charging excessive fees and that Bienvenido Perez, the consul general from 1996 to 1999, manipulated prices to benefit himself.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>Belt-Tightening in Nassau  The Democrats who control the Nassau County Legislature said that to prevent a state takeover of county finances they would seek a double-digit percentage rise in property taxes and reject costly police raises.</p>

        <p>Bilingual Programs at Risk  A draft report by a mayoral task force recommends that New York City public school students who do not speak English be given the option of taking all subject classes in English, a proposal that would probably curtail many bilingual programs.</p>

        <p>Rising College Tuition Costs  The costs of attending private four-year colleges grew by 5.2 percent this year, to $21,339 a year, while costs at public four-year colleges rose by 4.4 percent, to $8,086.</p>

        <p>Little Guidance on Altered Corn  Some farmers who planted StarLink, which is not approved for human consumption, say they were not adequately warned about restrictions on its planting, storage and sale.
