        <p>Over a bowl of caribou stew in his wooden house overlooking a fjord here, Kaaleeraq Ringsted, an Inuit hunter and fisherman, remarked on a new arrival in his timeless world of glaciers and icebergs: seals, seals and more seals.</p>

        <p>Over a bowl of caribou stew in his wooden house overlooking a fjord here, Kaaleeraq Ringsted, an Inuit hunter and fisherman, remarked on a new arrival in his timeless world of glaciers and icebergs: seals, seals and more seals.</p>
        <p>''When I was young, you would rarely see seals here,'' the wiry 48-year-old recalled through a Greenlandic-speaking interpreter. ''Now, when spring comes, the big seals come in and eat all the fish. Because of the number of seals in the fjord now, I have to go farther and farther out to fish.''</p>
        <p>In decades past, his father would hunt seals, earning a tidy profit catering to tastes for fashionable fur coats in Europe and the United States.</p>
        <p>But anti-fur campaigners, particularly opponents of the annual Canadian baby seal hunt, have virtually destroyed the sealskin fur market, so today Mr. Ringsted hunts harp seals only for meat for his family; usually, he throws the pelts away.</p>
        <p>But as fisheries suffer and Greenlanders seek a way to stay on the land, people here argue that prices would rise if the United States would lift a ban imposed almost 30 years ago on imports of seal products.</p>
        <p>With an estimated 5.5 million harp seals swimming off the western shores of Greenland -- about 100 for each Greenlander -- no government argues that harp seals are endangered or even threatened. And by the time seals make the 1,200-mile swim from Atlantic Canada to Greenland, they are considered adult seals.</p>
        <p>''Greenlanders do not kill baby seals,'' Jonathan Motzfeldt, the island's premier, said, speaking slowly for effect. ''Because we do not have baby seals.''</p>
        <p>But imports of seal products into the United States are banned by the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, a law that was drawn up partly out of revulsion over the clubbing of seal pups in Canada. (That hunt itself is on the decline. Last spring, about  80,000 pups were killed, 40 percent of the levels of the late 1990's, according to the Canadian government.)</p>
        <p>In 1998, Greenlanders hunting off their western coast in what they call ''the ranch of the sea,'' killed 82,500 harp seals, about 1.5 percent of the estimated population.</p>
        <p>Biologists and government officials here say the seal population is expanding so rapidly that many more could be hunted without threatening the species.</p>
        <p>''We have two legs for our economy to stand on: seals and fish,'' said Mikaela Engel, a foreign affairs spokesman for Greenland's home rule government. But with the decline of seal hunting, he said, ''there are a gazillion seals swimming around, and they are eating our fish.''</p>
        <p>There is widespread agreement with this view. ''The seals are very numerous,'' said Klaus Nygaard, director of the Greenland Institute of Natural Resources. ''They are actually creating problems with the fishing industry.''</p>
        <p>In Newfoundland, many fishermen blame seals, at least in part, for the collapse of the Grand Banks cod fishery. A Canadian government study in 1994 calculated that each year 4.5 million harp seals eat 140,000 tons of cod, or 2 billion fish.</p>
        <p>In Nunavut, Canada's new Arctic territory, Inuit living across the Davis Strait from Greenland also complain about seals. ''There are too many harp seals,'' said Peter Kilabuk, a former national park ranger who is now the territory's minister for sustainable development. ''The fishermen are concerned about them eating up the char,'' a popular food fish.</p>
        <p>But not everyone agrees.</p>
        <p>''Fewer seals means more fish -- that is the simple-minded view,'' said Dr. David Lavigne of Guelph, Ontario, a marine biologist who advises the International Fund for Animal Welfare, an animal protection group. ''We have a population that swims across international borders and is hunted by two countries with no joint agreement for a sustainable hunt.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Lavigne, a lifelong seal specialist, estimates that as many as half a million seals are killed each year between Canada and Greenland, including seals caught in fishing nets, seals shot but not reported by Inuit and hunted seals that escape and drown. If the United States ever lifted the ban on seal products, he warned, numbers would spiral upward.</p>
        <p>Though market prices for seal pelts remain low, partly because of the American ban, there are signs of change.</p>
        <p>The royal family of Denmark, the colonial power here, has helped touch off a minor sealskin revival by wearing stylishly cut seal fur coats in Copenhagen.</p>
        <p>With Europeans allowed to buy seal products, shops in Greenland's larger towns and airport merchants display racks of sealskin fur coats, jackets, scarves, hats, gloves and boots.</p>
        <p>''Some Americans are morally upset that we sell them here,'' said Bodil Nielsen, a Danish saleswoman at a fur shop at Kangerlussuaq, Greenland's international air hub. ''Other Americans say it is a shame they can't buy.''</p>
        <p>For a people who have survived for generations on the forbidding fringes of this landmass covered with ice and snow, the lectures from environmental groups about seal hunting are often taken as intrusive -- yet another example of meddling from a long line of outsiders.</p>
        <p>This colonialist history, they say, began with 18th century Danish missionaries and merchants, continued with European and North American whalers who almost wiped out seal and whale populations and appeared most recently in the form of American military officers dotting this island with cold war bases.</p>
        <p>The talk is particularly galling given that, according to the Greenland National Museum, Greenlanders have hunted seals as their primary food supply for roughly 4,400 years, and hunting seals is deeply imbedded in their culture.</p>
        <p>In Nuuk, the capital, the premier's waiting room is decorated with four harpoons on a wall.</p>
        <p>In an interview in his office, Premier Motzfeldt noted that he had been seal hunting several days earlier. ''I got three seals -- enough for me and my three friends to have enough meat for 14 days,'' he said through a Danish interpreter.</p>
        <p>Mr. Motzfeldt, who has been premier for most of the years since Greenland won home rule from Denmark in 1979, said that selling furs was one of a few economic activities that would anchor people like Mr. Ringsted to small villages like Kapisillit as Greenland's urbanization rate has soared, from 25 percent in 1950 to 81 percent today.</p>
        <p>''Twenty years ago, a lot of people in small settlements made a good living, partly by hunting seals, partly by fishing,'' said Jorge Waever Johansen, minister of social welfare and employment. ''Now one of those legs has collapsed.''</p>
        <p>The collapse in economic value of hunting has debilitated native societies across the Arctic, according to Aqqaluk Lynge, president of the Inuit Circumpolar Conference, an international group that represents 150,000 Inuit in Greenland, Canada, Alaska and Russia.</p>
        <p>Noting high native suicide rates in Greenland and northern Canada, Mr. Lynge said: ''If a man doesn't hunt, he isn't man enough to be husband to anyone. It has a devastating impact.''</p>
        <p>In recent years, some American critics of the seal hunt have suggested that Greenlanders try cattle ranching instead. But, Greenland's climate and geography do not allow much animal husbandry beyond a few sheep farms near the island's southern tip.</p>
        <p>''I suppose we could play the indigenous card,'' Ms. Engel, the diplomat, mused sardonically. ''People will want to watch us row up and strangle animals with our bare hands. Then, they will pay us with mirrors and shiny beads.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lynge, who once had his sealskin vest confiscated by American customs agents as he entered the United States to attend an Inuit congress in Alaska, put it another way. ''Save the seals, O.K.,'' he said. ''But how about saving the Eskimos?''</p>
