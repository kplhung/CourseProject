        <p>AFTER the rain came the revelry. Shea Stadium literally shook on a raw October night, rattling the Cardinals and the Champagne on ice. On their way to drinking it, the Mets danced to a tune they began humming on May 22, 1998.</p>
        <p>''When we got Mike Piazza, it gave our organization credibility,'' Steve Phillips said, offering his pennant-worthy retrospective before the Mets and Mike Hampton sent the rickety Cardinals home and won the National League pennant with a 7-0 victory in Game 5. ''We went from being a nice little team on the field and in people's perception to a real contender.''</p>
        <p>How silly the argument sounds now that the Mets didn't need to do something big and undeniably bold to compete in New York City as much as in the National League. Bobby Valentine could have pressed on craftily until buttons met bone. Edgardo Alfonzo might have contributed a thousand quality at-bats. A revelation like Timo Perez and a celebration for a home-game clincher to play in the World Series, probably a Subway Series, were not going to occur without Piazza in the house.</p>
        <p>''I know I'm a big part of the team, but I also know if I don't do the job, someone will pick me up,'' he said. ''I'm just so proud of this team.''</p>
        <p>His team. Piazza came under a cloud of suspicion for having rejected the multimillions thrown at him by the Dodgers, who plucked him from the bottom of the draft and nurtured him to the top of his game. How much money did he want? Who did he think he was? He was a selfish player, one of his former teammates, Brett Butler, was heard to say.</p>
        <p>Piazza hit New York and compounded these issues by not hitting, becoming the symbol of the Mets' fans' myopia. The Yankees were headed to another championship. Where were the Mets going, in their ranch house of a ballpark with a view of airplanes ascending over the parking lot? Surely, Piazza was going to take the first one out when the season was done.</p>
        <p>''He was booed and had negative press for the first time in his career,'' Phillips, the general manager, said. ''But when you work and persevere, the reward is that much higher, and as I look back now, there was no better player we could have got.''</p>
        <p>He was only partially referring to the 78 home runs over the past two seasons, the 237 runs batted in, as much to the man who weighed his options and became his team's heavyweight persona. A franchise that had stumbled with the free-agent likes of Bobby Bonilla and Vince Coleman needed a veteran who could grow, mature, while switching uniforms -- Dodgers to Marlins to Mets.</p>
        <p>Piazza the Met has never been selfish, seldom surly, only stubbornly opposed to the switch to first base that will prolong his career. He's taken a beating behind the plate, but, as Phillips said, ''He's played hard and he's played hurt and he's been in front of his locker to talk about it.'' Piazza took to New York. He put the Mets in position to take the town.</p>
        <p>''In the last three years, we've gone from being a team that was usually on the no-trade clause list to one that players have wanted to play for,'' Phillips said. ''Al Leiter stayed. Robin Ventura wanted to come. Todd Zeile.''</p>
        <p>Despite Piazza's call, Ken Griffey Jr. didn't, but look at what he's missing, sulking in Cincinnati.</p>
        <p>Worn out, Piazza didn't hit in last year's N.L.C.S. against the Braves. He slumped late this season, but has hit .323 this time, with a couple of home runs in the championship series. The Cardinals' Pat Hentgen, terrified of Piazza, walked him during a three-run first last night. Piazza doubled and scored on Zeile's three-run double in the fourth. Maybe his live bat in the playoffs has to do with the sniff of Roger Clemens, who beaned him in July, with vengeance in the Series in sight.</p>
        <p>Piazza was understandably hot in the eighth after Dave Veras hit Jay Payton in the helmet, but soon he was in a bubbly mood, the happiest 32-year-old kid in the clubhouse, even when Dennis Cook sneaked up and dumped a bottle inside the back of his shirt.</p>
        <p>''I don't care right now,'' he said when asked about Clemens, about the Yanks. ''This is the time where you can't really let up and start to philosophize. You know what I mean?''</p>
        <p>What he has meant to the Mets is merely everything they hoped he would. They waited 14 years for last night, but only two and a half after arriving in New York, Mike Piazza replaced the New York Police Department cap he wore after Game 4 Sunday night with another one that was blue. Except this new one said: ''World Series, 2000.''</p>
