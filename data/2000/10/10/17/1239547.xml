        <p>Some habits die harder than others.</p>
        <p>The Rangers have not had a winning record at home since the 1996-97 season, the only one in which Mark Messier and Wayne Gretzky played together in New York.</p>
        <p>Messier is back, but the Rangers still seem to be struggling on home ice.</p>
        <p>The Rangers spotted the Anaheim Mighty Ducks a three-goal lead midway through the second period last night at Madison Square Garden. The Rangers dominated play the rest of the way.</p>
        <p>''Too late,'' Rangers Coach Ron Low said after watching his team lose, 4-3, to the struggling Mighty Ducks.</p>
        <p>Stop Paul Kariya and Teemu Selanne, and chances are good that you will stop the Mighty Ducks. The Rangers stopped neither.</p>
        <p>Kariya celebrated his 26th birthday with a goal and an assist. Selanne contributed an assist on Kariya's goal. All that left the Rangers  playing catch-up all night.</p>
        <p>Theo Fleury scored his third goal in two games to briefly bring the Rangers to 3-2 midway through the final period. It came after Low moved Valery Kamensky to a line with Mike York and Fleury in the third period, and had Michal Grosek skate with Messier and Adam Graves, something Low indicated he might do again in Chicago, tomorrow night.</p>
        <p>But Kirk McLean, playing in place of the recovering Mike Richter -- who is about a week away from making his 2000-1 debut on his surgically rebuilt left knee -- allowed a bad goal to Mike LeClerc with  7 minutes 40 seconds remaining to restore Anaheim's two-goal lead. Skating with a six-on-four advantage with 56.9 second left in the game, the Rangers pulled to within a goal when Jan Hlavac was able to convert Petr Nedved's feed on the power play. But the Rangers fate was already sealed, thanks to Kariya.</p>
        <p>The Rangers are probably thankful that they only face the Ducks twice a season. In eight career meetings against New York, Kariya now has 4 goals and 8 assists for 12 points; in 12 career meetings against the Rangers, Selanne has 13 goals and 5 assists for 18 points.</p>
        <p>Still, Anaheim was a team in turmoil coming in. Kariya had called a players-only meeting in the aftermath of a 4-2 loss to the Devils on  Saturday, visiting Anaheim's third-consecutive defeat.</p>
        <p>But the Rangers -- who dropped their second consecutive game after opening the season with consecutive victories -- did not exactly take advantage of that.</p>
        <p>It took the Rangers 15:24 to record their first shot on goal.</p>
        <p>And neither of the Rangers' two shots in the first period was taken by a forward.</p>
        <p>''We looked like we were on our heels, kind of watching what they were doing, instead of doing what we're supposed to be doing,'' Low said. ''It's something that has to be addressed. I know last year, they said every first period was a bit of a bummer.''</p>
        <p>The Rangers picked up where they had left off.</p>
        <p>''There are still a lot of things we need to iron out,'' Messier said.</p>
        <p>The Ducks were not exactly peppering McLean at the other end. Just 15 seconds after Rich Pilon was penalized for slashing midway through the first, Marty McInnis redirected Kariya's blast from the top of the slot past McLean at 10:39 of the first period; the Ducks had a one-goal lead after one period.</p>
        <p>The Rangers played a much better second period -- yet trailed by two goals after two periods.</p>
        <p>Even though the Rangers had the first six shots on goal of the period, Anaheim scored on its first two shots, just 32 seconds apart.</p>
        <p>The first came from the wide-open Kariya, who took a feed from Selanne and snapped a wrist shot inside the left post. The Ducks had a 2-0 lead at 9:05 of the second period and made it a three-goal advantage 32 seconds later. The goal came from Andrei Nazarov, who was left all alone in the slot.</p>
        <p>On the very next shift, Pilon seemed to inspire the Rangers with his one-punch knockout of Jim Cummins at 10:15 of the second period.</p>
        <p>''Good bout,'' said Pilon, who missed the remainder of the game with a broken nose. ''Blood on both sides.''</p>
        <p>The Rangers controlled play the rest of the period. But they were rewarded only once, at 11:04, when Sylvain Lefebrve, skating near the left-wing circle, one-timed a pass from Nedved past Anaheim goaltender Dominic Roussel.</p>
        <p>''The game doesn't start the second period,'' Pilon said. ''It starts with the first.''</p>
        <p>SLAP SHOTS</p>
        <p>JOHN MacLEAN made his first start of the season, after being a healthy scratch for the Rangers' first four games. MacLean, who turns 36, next month, skated at left wing -- his off-wing -- on the Rangers' fourth line with TIM TAYLOR and SANDY McCARTHY.  . . . On defense, JASON DOIG returned after being a healthy scratch for one game. DAVID WILKIE was scratched instead. But Coach RON LOW was not pleased with Doig's play against the Ducks, and indicated that another defenseman, perhaps MIKE MOTTAU,  might be recalled for tomorrow night's game.</p>
