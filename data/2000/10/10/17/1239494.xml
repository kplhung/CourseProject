        <p>Concerned that consumers are not getting the word that Bridgestone/ Firestone would replace some 700,000 suspect tires outside of the 6.5 million it has recalled, several states issued public reminders of the offer today.</p>
        <p>Some of the states, including Michigan and New York, also said they had won a promise from the tire maker to stop requiring that consumers who accept the offer give up their right to sue.</p>
        <p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on Sept. 1 issued an advisory about the tires, saying they had a high rate of tread separation. The company said the tires were safe, but 11 days later offered to replace them under a ''consumer satisfaction program.''</p>
        <p>That offer was not part of the 6.5 million-tire recall that was announced Aug. 9. Those tires were linked by the traffic safety administration to scores of deaths in the rollovers of Ford Explorers.</p>
        <p>The replacement offer was for 1.4 million 15-inch Wilderness, ATX and ATXII tires used in 1991 Chevrolet Blazers, 1991-1994 Nissan pickups and 1996-1996 Ford F150n pickups. Most were sold as replacements. Bridgestone/Firestone said that about half the tires were still on the road and that it was not tracking how many replacements had been made. Some four million of the recall tires have been turned in. Bridgestone issued press releases on Sept. 12 announcing the program. Jill Bratina, a spokeswoman for the tire maker in Nashville, said consumers could have learned of the offer from media reports, the company Web site and tire dealers. No letters were sent out because they are not required, as they are in a recall.</p>
