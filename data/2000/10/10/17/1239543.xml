        <p>THE POLLS</p>
        <p>BY A NOSE -- Gov. George W. Bush goes into the third and final presidential debate with a narrow edge over Vice President Al Gore in four nationwide opinion polls taken since the candidates met last week. But his lead in each is within the margin of sampling error.</p>

        <p>THE POLLS</p>
        <p>BY A NOSE -- Gov. George W. Bush goes into the third and final presidential debate with a narrow edge over Vice President Al Gore in four nationwide opinion polls taken since the candidates met last week. But his lead in each is within the margin of sampling error.</p>
        <p>The polls, released by NBC News/The Wall Street Journal, CNN/USA Today, Time/CNN and Newsweek, all came up with the same finding, give or take a couple of percentage points.</p>
        <p>Averaged together, they show Mr. Bush with the support of 47 percent of voters, Mr. Gore with 43 percent, Ralph Nader with 4 percent and Patrick J.  Buchanan with 1 percent.</p>

        <p>THE DEMOCRATS</p>
        <p>COME AGAIN? -- Last week Al Gore and his aides were quick to deride George W. Bush for tripping over his own numbers while trying to explain his tax cut proposal at a rally in Florida. In the second debate, Mr. Gore pointed out that he ''wasn't the one having trouble explaining'' his plans.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Gore does at times have that trouble. Last Tuesday during a forum in Florida, on Wednesday during the debate and again on Friday in Milwaukee, he misstated his proposal for a tuition-based tax break by saying he would help parents ''send their kids to college with a $10,000 tax deduction for college tuition, per child, per year.'' In fact, as ABC News pointed out on Thursday, the proposal calls for a $10,000 deduction per family per year, not per child.</p>
        <p>On Saturday, in a speech in Detroit, Mr. Gore corrected himself.</p>

        <p>THE STATES</p>
        <p>THE ROAD NOT TAKEN -- Candidates for Wyoming's at-large House seat met on Sunday night in their first debate, but one couldn't make it: Michael Green, a Democrat from Rock Springs in his first run for statewide office, said that his 15-year-old Mercury was too unreliable for the 150-mile drive and that he had no money to get there any other way.</p>
        <p>That left the stage to Representative Barbara Cubin, a three-term Republican incumbent who is expected to win again; Lewis Stock, a Libertarian; and Victor Raymond of the Natural Law Party.</p>
        <p>So it goes when you're a Democrat in one of the most Republican of states. Mr. Green, a clerk at the Wyoming Alliance for the Mentally Ill, said that without any staff, campaign contributions or help from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, he had virtually no ability to help his party gain a foothold in the state.</p>
        <p>''Republicans here,'' he said, ''can burn down your house and take away your job and still get elected.''</p>

        <p>THE REPUBLICANS</p>
        <p>BACKING FOR BUSH -- A group of Arab-Americans from the Detroit area, which has one of the largest Arab-American concentrations in the country, has endorsed George W. Bush for president.</p>
        <p>The group, the Arab-American Political Action Committee, made up of influential businessmen and other community leaders, gave its unanimous backing to Mr. Bush over the weekend, a noteworthy development inasmuch as the presidential race in Michigan is rated a tossup. There are about 400,000 Arab-Americans in southeastern Michigan.</p>
        <p>Some committee members said they supported Mr. Bush rather than Al Gore because the governor had courted the Arab vote and had shown a flexibility on Middle East issues. Others said they were pleased that he had mentioned two issues important to Arabs during the second presidential debate: racial profiling and the government's use of secret evidence in deportation cases. And still others said they were concerned that the Democratic vice-presidential nominee, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, is Jewish.</p>
