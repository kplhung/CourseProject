        <p>Gov. George W. Bush flew into President Clinton's home state today on his way to the final presidential debate and tweaked the Democrats by declaring, ''Arkansas is going to be George W. country.''</p>
        <p>With a giant state flag behind him in an amphitheater along the Arkansas River, Mr. Bush derided Vice President Al Gore as an old-time Democrat who favors big government and said he would strike that theme in the third and last presidential debate in St. Louis on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>''I can't wait to remind people that the day of the New Democrat is evidently over,'' he said to a cheering crowd that had gathered despite a drizzle. ''The day of the big-spending Democrat is back.'' He tied Mr. Gore not to the president he had served under for eight years, but to the two losing Democratic presidential nominees before Mr. Clinton, who were considered more traditional liberals.</p>
        <p>''I'm running against somebody who's proposed a budget that's three times bigger than President Clinton proposed when he ran,'' he said. The crowd, in response, joyously booed Mr. Gore. ''I'm running against a man who has got such great faith in the federal government that he has proposed more federal spending than Michael Dukakis and Walter Mondale combined.'' The crowd booed louder.</p>
        <p>''It's O.K. to spend federal money,'' Mr. Bush said, ''but it's not O.K. to spend so much federal money that it's going to bust the budget.''</p>
        <p>With the race still considered a dead heat and the election now just three weeks away, Mr. Bush urged supporters to go to the polls.</p>
        <p>''Don't get me wrong,'' he said, ''This is going to be a really close election. This election is going to come down to the wire. This is going to be an election that requires every person in Arkansas who's on our side to go to work three weeks out.''</p>
        <p>Arkansas is one of the states that Mr. Gore is counting on to avoid a shutout across the South. It voted twice for its favorite son, Bill Clinton, and was only one of five states that Mr. Gore won in the Democratic primaries in 1988 when he made his last presidential bid.</p>
        <p>But the state has been leaning more toward Republicans in recent years. Gov. Mike Huckabee and Senator Tim Hutchinson, both Republicans, shared the stage with Mr. Bush, as did Representative Asa Hutchinson, the senator's brother, who had been one of Mr. Clinton's prosecutors in his Senate impeachment trial.</p>
        <p>And while Mr. Gore has been running a barrage of television advertisements here, he has not been able to establish a lead. The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette in Little Rock conducted a poll two weeks ago that  had the race in a dead heat.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush was introduced today by Erma Hendrix, a former Little Rock board member who switched from Democrat to Republican in 1980 after a run-in with the Democratic Party over a race for the State House of Representatives. Mr. Clinton was the Democratic governor at the time.</p>
        <p>''You've had a history of dealing with those folks up in Washington, D.C.,'' Mr. Bush said, referring to her dispute with Mr. Clinton and the Democrats when she was not allowed into a primary runoff in her bid to become representative even though a court said she was entitled to the spot in the runoff because of a dispute over uncounted ballots.</p>
        <p>Ms. Hendrix praised Mr. Bush for his stand on ''empowering the people and the pro-life issue,'' and he gave her a big hug.</p>
        <p>Later this evening, Mr. Bush arrived here in St. Louis where he was endorsed by the National Troopers Association, which represents 35,000 state troopers and highway patrol officers. As he accepted the endorsement, Mr. Bush criticized Mr. Gore, who noticeably changed his style between the first and second debates.</p>
        <p>The governor said voters want to elect someone who will just ''tell it like it is, not try to be one thing in one debate and something else in the next debate.''</p>
        <p>With the race in a dead heat, both Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore will seek to press an advantage in the final debate Tuesday night, which for the first time will feature audience questions and comes at a time when violence in the Middle East has put foreign affairs at center stage. The governor practiced for the debate this morning in Austin, Tex., and was expected to conduct another run-through on Tuesday.</p>
