        <p>Gus Hall, the zealous lifelong Communist who led the American branch of the party from the cold war through political oblivion in the post-Soviet era, died on Friday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. He was 90 and lived in Yonkers.</p>
        <p>The son of an impoverished Minnesota miner, Mr. Hall became radicalized early, beginning a career as a union and Communist Party organizer during the Depression. J. Edgar Hoover once described him as ''a powerful, deceitful, dangerous foe of Americanism.''</p>
        <p>He served eight years in prison for his political views, ran for president four times and never apologized for or wavered from the increasingly marginalized ideology he championed.</p>
        <p>By the end of his life he had become a lonely Communist stalwart in a post-Communist world. Those who sought him out for interviews at party headquarters on West 23rd Street in Manhattan found a genial white-haired man presiding over ''a museum of history,'' as he put it. Pictures of his family shared space with a portrait of Lenin (a gift from Leonid I. Brezhnev); a wood sculpture from Fidel Castro and a tapestry of Karl Marx, courtesy of Erich Honecker, the former leader of East Germany.</p>
        <p>''The struggle between those who own the wealth and those whose labor produces the wealth is one flaw in capitalism that will lead to socialism,'' Mr. Hall said in 1996,  repeating the familiar Marxist formulation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hall was first elected general secretary of the Communist Party, U.S.A., in 1959, when the federal government considered the organization an outpost of the Kremlin and all its members potentially dangerous subversives.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hall's message won few converts, and his four presidential campaigns, from 1972 to 1984, met with yawning indifference. In his best showing, the 1976 election, he amassed 58,992 votes, about 19,000 more than Lyndon H. LaRouche, the eccentric candidate who had accused Queen Elizabeth II and Henry A. Kissinger, among others, of having ties to drug traffickers.</p>
        <p>Yet, in the Communist world, Mr. Hall remained an important figure. He enjoyed the patronage of every Soviet head of state, from Nikita S. Khrushchev to Mikhail S. Gorbachev, and was received as a dignitary on his yearly pilgrimages to Moscow. A high point came in 1981 when he addressed the 26th Party Congress, at the invitation of Mr. Brezhnev, the Soviet leader Mr. Hall most esteemed. He was less admiring of Mr. Gorbachev, whose reforms a few years later, Mr. Hall said, ''literally destroyed the basis for socialism.''</p>
        <p>As long as the cold war raged, however, Mr. Hall's Soviet sponsors delighted in the presence of this unmistakably American comrade, an authentic product of the working class, nearer in spirit to Joe Sixpack, it seemed, than to Joe Stalin. A rock-jawed, barrel-chested six-footer, Mr. Hall weighed more than 200 pounds and had the powerful hands of the lumberjack and steelworker he had been in his youth. Simple in his tastes and habits, he was married to one woman, Elizabeth Turner, for 65 years, living with her in the three-bedroom house they bought in a middle-class neighborhood in Yonkers in 1962. She survives him, as do his two children, Barbara and Arvo, and three grandchildren.</p>
        <p>To his adversaries, Mr. Hall's rough-and-ready manner was a cynical pose that concealed a dedicated apparatchik. Even political associates sometimes found Mr. Hall's obeisance to the Soviet Union excessive, and they grumbled, especially in his later years, that his inflexible views and dictatorial personality were hampering the party and isolating it from the wider political world.</p>
        <p>''I told Gus 10 years ago that he should be  grooming new leadership, but he would have none of it,'' Carl Bloice, a former colleague, said in 1993. ''He sees himself as a man on a mission, the last holdout.''</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Hall insisted that the American Communist Party was an independent organization, in 1992 the Moscow daily Izvestia reported that Mr. Hall had been the recipient of $40 million in Soviet assistance between 1971 and 1990.</p>
        <p>Radical Roots Lead From Logging to Lenin</p>
        <p>Gus Hall was born Arvo Kusta Halberg on Oct. 8, 1910, in Iron, Minn., one of 10 children reared by Matt Halberg, a miner, and his wife, Susannah. His parents were Finnish immigrants who belonged to the Industrial Workers of the World, the militant labor organization. Their son said that after Mr. Halberg was blacklisted from the mines for joining an I.W.W. strike the family grew up ''in semi-starvation,'' in a log cabin Mr. Halberg built with his own hands.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hall left school after the eighth grade and found work in a logging camp. His parents' radical teachings were reinforced, he later recalled, by the hardships of that experience, which once included bunking alongside the corpse of a man who had died on the job.</p>
        <p>''When you work in the woods literally from sunup to sundown and it's 50 degrees below zero and you eat slop and you make $30 a month, then what was said at home begins to make sense,'' Mr. Hall once said.</p>
        <p>In 1927, he was recruited into the American Communist Party by his father, a member of the organization since its inception in 1919. An apprenticeship in the Young Communist League qualified him to attend the  Lenin Institute in Moscow, where he was trained for two years in sabotage and guerrilla tactics. He returned, in 1933, to a country devastated by the Great Depression. A growing number of Americans, convinced that the existing political and economic structures had become outmoded, were attracted to the Communist Party's promise of a workers' state. One of many who plunged into the labor movement, Mr. Hall made his name organizing union locals in the Midwest.</p>
        <p>Militant and bold, he drew on some of the conspiratorial tactics he had learned in Moscow. One such tactic was the adoption of  a sequence of aliases, all variations on his given name, before he settled on Gus Hall. He took the name legally in the mid-1930's.</p>
        <p>At the same time he employed the attention-getting methods of militant leaders like William Haywood -- Big Bill -- of the I.W.W. Mr. Hall was arrested at least twice in the 1930's. In a Teamsters' strike in Minneapolis, in 1934, he was accused of inciting a riot and spent six months in jail. And in 1937, in a  strike against the Republic Steel Corporation in Youngstown, Ohio, he was charged with plotting to dynamite company property. He pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor and was fined $500.</p>
        <p>Thereafter Mr. Hall became a full-time functionary of the Communist Party, beginning with a $20-a-week position as the party leader in Youngstown. He ran on the Communist ticket for city councilman and also for governor of Ohio, but his vote totals were low, even in these years of comparative success for the Communist Party.</p>
        <p>A Veteran, a Convict, A Fugitive, a Comrade</p>
        <p>He was living in Cleveland with his wife and children when the United States entered World War II in 1941. The party had opposed the war after Stalin signed a nonaggression pact with Hitler in 1939 but changed its line in June 1941, when Germany violated the pact and invaded Russia.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hall enlisted in the Navy and became a mechanic, stationed in the Pacific. He was repairing motors in Guam when a bitter ideological fight roiled the American Communist Party and caused the downfall of the general secretary, Earl Browder, in 1945. Elections were held the next year, and Mr. Hall, freshly discharged from the Navy and unscarred by factional combat, was elevated to the national executive board under the new general secretary, Eugene Dennis.</p>
        <p>By this time, American attitudes toward Communists were hardening because of cold war tensions. In 1948, a federal grand jury indicted Mr. Hall and 11 other party leaders under the Alien Registration Act,  popularly called the Smith Act, for conspiring to teach and advocate the overthrow of the government by force. The dramatic 10-month trial, marked by loud confrontations between the defendants, their lawyers and the judge, Harold R. Medina, was held in the United States courthouse on Foley Square in downtown Manhattan and shared headlines with another celebrated trial under way in the same building: the perjury trial of Alger Hiss, a former State Department official accused of having spied for the Soviets.</p>
        <p>In October 1949, Mr. Hall and 10 others were found guilty and sentenced to five years in prison. While the verdict was being appealed, Mr. Hall was elected to the party's second-highest position, national secretary, but after the Supreme Court upheld the convictions in 1951 he and three others jumped bail and crossed the border into Mexico, only to be captured three months later by Mexican Secret Service agents. Mr. Hall, his sentence lengthened to eight years, was confined to the federal penitentiary in Leavenworth, Kan. There he distributed party leaflets and also lifted weights, adding bulk to his already stocky frame. He was especially proud of the time he spent in a cell adjacent to that of George (Machine Gun) Kelly, one of the most notorious gangsters of the 1920's and 30's.</p>
        <p>Wresting Reins of Party, Or What Was Left of It</p>
        <p>Imprisonment had made Mr. Hall something of a hero in party circles, and when he was released in 1957, he crisscrossed the country, visiting party members and calling for a new, more democratic regime. His plan was to wrest the party leadership from Eugene Dennis.</p>
        <p>Though neither a galvanizing speaker nor a penetrating theorist, Mr. Hall could be persuasive face to face, with a hearty, unpretentious manner and a willingness to listen. And he did not shy from hardball tactics. He accused Mr. Dennis of cowardice and of violating party discipline because he had failed to join Mr. Hall and other Smith Act defendants in 1951 when they tried to go underground.</p>
        <p>He also said Mr. Dennis had misappropriated funds meant for Mr. Hall and the other fugitives. At the party convention in 1959, Mr. Dennis backed down from Mr. Hall's challenge rather than force another factional fight.</p>
        <p>Some wondered why Mr. Hall was so eager to assume the leadership of the party at a time when its morale had sunk to an all-time low. The ''Red hunts'' led by Senator Joseph R. McCarthy in the early 1950's left many members demoralized. So did a report from Moscow, in February 1956, that the new Soviet premier, Nikita Khrushchev, had accused Stalin, who was still revered by many Communists, of brutal crimes.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, the United States had achieved unparalleled prosperity, and more Americans were streaming into the middle class than ever before. It was hardly a propitious moment to call for a new socialist state. Indeed, party enrollment had dwindled to about 3,000 from its peak of about 66,000 in 1939. It would never rise appreciably again.</p>
        <p>And yet Mr. Hall remained a contentious figure, thanks in part to actions by the United States government, which continued to pursue the Communist Party. In 1961, the Supreme Court narrowly upheld the constitutionality of the Smith Act along with the Internal Security Act of 1950, known as the McCarran Act, which required ''Communist action'' organizations to register with the government. Party members were barred from applying for United States passports and from holding government jobs. The State of New York even revoked Mr. Hall's driver's license. Thereafter he commuted between his Manhattan office and his home in the suburbs in a chauffeured car, always  American-made, because Mr. Hall was an ardent union man.</p>
        <p>A Doomed Effort to Ally With the 'New Left'</p>
        <p>By the early 1960's, few Americans believed the party posed a serious danger, especially after Mr. Hall had jettisoned the fiery language and militant tactics of his youth and spoke now of peaceful protest. Critics of the Supreme Court's anti-Communist rulings included the members of a new generation whose political conscience had been fired by the sit-ins and freedom rides of the civil rights movement. When Mr. Hall lectured at Cornell University in December 1961, 1,950 people, nearly all of them students, filled the auditorium, and an additional 2,000 were turned away.</p>
        <p>Trying to pick up on the new wave of youth protest, Mr. Hall envisioned what he called a ''broad people's political movement.'' The phrasing was not very different from that used by radical campus groups like Students for a Democratic Society. In fact, there were points of convergence between the Old Left, as it came to be called, and the New Left. Both called for an immediate end to the Vietnam War, sympathized with Fidel Castro's rule in Cuba, denounced American foreign policy in Latin America and opposed the nuclear arms race. The party also allied itself with the civil rights movement and in 1966 issued a statement of solidarity with two militant organizations,  the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and the Black Panthers.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Hall never was able to forge a durable alliance with the New Left. While younger radicals like Tom Hayden styled  themselves ''grass roots'' revolutionaries and patterned themselves on Che Guevara and other third world icons, Mr. Hall stayed faithful to the Soviet Union and to the ideal of an ascendant working class firmly rooted in the dislocations of the early 20th century.</p>
        <p>Dorothy Healey, a leader of the California Communist Party, who had been an early supporter of Mr. Hall's but later turned against him, observed: ''Gus has only the narrowest concept of class: the worker at the point of production. The world may change, not his vision of it.''</p>
        <p>In the 1970's and 1980's, as the radical agenda became defined increasingly by feminism, the gay and lesbian movements and environmentalism, Mr. Hall was as nonplused as others of his generation.</p>
        <p>In 1991, as the Soviet Union was crumbling, Mr. Hall conducted a news conference at the party's Manhattan office, warning of a new wave of witch hunts and McCarthyism, but this time in the Soviet Union, which he had visited only a few months earlier.</p>
        <p>Asked if he had plans to visit again in the near future, he said no. Instead, he pointed to the world's last bastion of Stalinism.</p>
        <p>''The world should see what North Korea has done,'' Mr. Hall said. ''In some ways it's a miracle.</p>
        <p>''If you want to take a nice vacation, take it in North Korea.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  October 23, 2000, Monday  An obituary on Tuesday about Gus Hall, longtime chairman of the American Communist Party, misstated the title held by Nikita S. Khrushchev when he was the Soviet leader. Khrushchev became premier in 1958; he was not premier in 1956 and he never held the title head of state.</p>
