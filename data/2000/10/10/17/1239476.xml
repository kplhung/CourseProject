        <p>China described its current relationship with Taiwan as ''complicated and grim'' in a policy paper on national defense issued today. It blamed the scheming of ''separatist forces'' in Taiwan and American arms sales to the island for continued tensions in the region.</p>
        <p>The defense report from the state council, or cabinet, did not spell out new policies but gave a gloomy assessment of the situation in Taiwan, which China considers a part of its territory. It criticizes Taiwan's ''new leaders'' -- Chinese officials refuse to use President Chen Shui-bian's name -- for an ''evasive and obscure attitude to the one-China principle.'' And it warns, once again, that if Taiwan indefinitely refuses to pursue reunification through negotiations, then China will ''adopt all drastic measures possible, including the use of force.''</p>

        <p>China described its current relationship with Taiwan as ''complicated and grim'' in a policy paper on national defense issued today. It blamed the scheming of ''separatist forces'' in Taiwan and American arms sales to the island for continued tensions in the region.</p>
        <p>The defense report from the state council, or cabinet, did not spell out new policies but gave a gloomy assessment of the situation in Taiwan, which China considers a part of its territory. It criticizes Taiwan's ''new leaders'' -- Chinese officials refuse to use President Chen Shui-bian's name -- for an ''evasive and obscure attitude to the one-China principle.'' And it warns, once again, that if Taiwan indefinitely refuses to pursue reunification through negotiations, then China will ''adopt all drastic measures possible, including the use of force.''</p>
        <p>The report says that China's defense spending remains low compared with that of other countries --  at $14.6 billion, the spending for the year 2000 is only 5 percent of American military spending. Independent experts say China's public total excludes major sums spent on research and procurement that are concealed in other budgets, though the total remains far lower than that of the United States.</p>
        <p>China has trimmed its number of military personnel considerably in recent years, tried to recruit a better educated force and increased spending in a crash program to buy or develop more advanced weapons. The report asserts that China is a peace-loving nation with no ambitions to conquer other lands. But it justifies the military buildup as necessary because of ''hegemonism and power politics,'' code words for American power in Asia, and because ''the basis for the country's peaceful reunification is imperiled.''</p>
