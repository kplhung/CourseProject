        <p>The nation's colleges and universities raised tuition and fees for students by roughly 5 percent this year, capping a decade of price increases that are steadily outpacing family income.</p>
        <p>In a report released yesterday, the president of the College Board, Gaston Caperton, portrayed the increases in tuition, which ranged from 3.4 percent at two-year community colleges to 7 percent at two-year private colleges, as moderate, and said universities were making efforts to contain expenses.</p>
        <p>The costs of attending private four-year colleges grew by 5.2 percent, while those at public four-year colleges rose by 4.4 percent. The average increase, according to the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, ran 5 percent.</p>
        <p>The tuition increases, partly offset by a 4 percent rise in total financial aid from government and private sources, come at a moment of unusual bounty for some universities. Last week's Chronicle of Higher Education reported record returns on investments from endowments for some universities, led by Harvard, while noncompetitive congressional research grants to them, so-called pork barrel projects, totaled more than a $1 billion this year for the first time.</p>
        <p>University presidents blamed the tuition increases, which ran higher than the 3.1 percent increase in the Consumer Price Index over the last year, on soaring costs of energy and health care, of updating computer equipment and outfitting dormitories for high-speed Internet access.</p>
        <p>''The consumer expects to come in here and find a state-of-the-art environment,'' said Patricia McGuire, president of Trinity College in Washington. Her school spends heavily to update computer equipment every three years or so, and has struggled to limit tuition increases to 3 percent.  But others contend that colleges, by consistently raising prices, are responding to the laws of supply and the seemingly inexhaustible demand for access to higher education.</p>
        <p>Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution, noted that health care costs and transportation had risen less than tuition, while other expenses, such as communication, actually shrank over the last year.</p>
        <p>In the 1970's, a college degree meant earning a third more than high school graduates. Now that premium is 80 percent. ''That allowed colleges through the 1980's and '90's to charge ever higher tuitions and still fill all the desks in their classrooms,'' Mr. Burtless said.</p>
        <p>Despite outlays for technology, he said other indicators suggested a decline in the quality of higher education: over time, fewer undergraduate classes are being taught by senior faculty.</p>
        <p>In the last decade, the median family income has risen 8 percent, to $49,012 from $45,552, after adjusting for inflation. In the same period, the cost of attending a four-year public college has gone up about 28 percent, to $8,086 a year from $6,302. A four-year education at a private college has increased 27 percent, to $21,339 a year from $16,823.</p>
        <p>Over that period, financial aid has gone up as well, mostly in the form of loans. Twenty years ago, loans covered 41 percent of a college education. Today, they typically pay for 59 percent. The average student now graduates nearly $18,000 in debt, and over the last decade, the share of all aid set aside for merit scholarships has doubled.</p>
        <p>''The institutions, particularly the selective private ones, are engaged in a rat race of competitive spending to attract the best students,'' said Ron Ehrenberg, director of Cornell University's Higher Education Research Institute. Despite the recent high-flying returns on endowments at some universities, most do not enjoy such vast financial cushions, he said.</p>
        <p>''State support for public institutions has not kept up with inflation, even over long periods of time,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Daniel S. Hamermesh, an economics professor at the University of Texas at Austin, said he still considered higher education, particularly at state universities, a bargain for the middle class and a gateway for social mobility. But he noted that poorer students at the University of Texas struggled under the expense.</p>
        <p>''Even though the prices of fancy private schools are skyrocketing, the queues are getting longer and longer,'' Mr. Hamermesh said. ''The question is how do you ration a scarce commodity, which is space at universities.''</p>
