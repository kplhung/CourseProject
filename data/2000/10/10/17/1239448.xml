        <p>Bale Folclorico da Bahia, a professional folk troupe from Salvador in northeastern Brazil, made its New York debut in 1996 and has since carried its exuberant message of multicultural cheer throughout the United States.</p>
        <p>A national tour brought the company here tonight with a new, more spectacularly produced program that ended with the audience following dancers and drummers out of the New Jersey Performing Arts Center. The sight of previously staid viewers dancing on an outdoor plaza is no surprise to anyone who has seen this traditional close to Bale Folclorico's performances.</p>
        <p>What could be a gimmick succeeds simply because the evening's sincerity is never in doubt. The relish of the dancers, musicians and singers for doing what they do onstage is so obviously part of their lives that the contagion spreads to the house.</p>
        <p>The Afro-Brazilian focus of the company has been widened to include dances drawn from Brazil's Indian populations. Walson Botelho, the company's co-founder, and Jose Carlos Arandiba, its artistic director, enlisted Amelia Conrado's choreographic skill in theatricalizing festive ceremonies from the Amazon.</p>
        <p>''Boi-Bumba, the new piece, is a whirlwind of colorfully feathered dancers, amplifying the already electrifying energy the troupe brings to the African-derived dances. A folk tale about reviving a dead ox serves as a springboard: two dancers in hobbyhorse costumes impersonate the ox and the herdsman who kills him. They wiggle and canter, but the essence of the piece is in the stamping, leaping patterns of dancers in magnificent headdresses. Different units in different colors weave a counterpoint of rhythm, as a shaman figure leads all in a dance that differs in posture and spirit from everything else on the program.</p>
        <p>Better financing has given the company more resources, and the costumes and staging contribute to a new polish. The results are impressive and seductive. Ms. Conrado's new ''Maracatu Rural'' is introduced by a group of slinking riflemen whose role needs some explaining. But there is no mistaking the parody of colonial aristocracy as a mock king and queen, resplendent in gold, join the revels.</p>
        <p>Some of the homespun awkwardness of the company's earlier years had its charm. Now it is approaching the glamour of Ballet Folklorico of Mexico. Yet the Brazilian company retains a strong connection to the roots of the traditions its celebrates.</p>
        <p>The musical interlude included a virtuoso solo on long-stemmed lute, the berimbau, by Daniel Sousa, and the mix of pop and tradition is vividly embodied by Dora Santana, who belts out her songs with Miralva Couto as wonderfully as ever.</p>
        <p>The acrobatic solos in the martial arts competitions are performed by young men with a new thrill quotient in ''Capoeira.'' The granddaddy of break dancing is found in this work. The women, never less energetic than the men, are enticing in the sambas. They are not girls from Ipanema, and the difference is loud and clear.</p>
