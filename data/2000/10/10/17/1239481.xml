        <p>THE 2000 annual conference of the Association of National Advertisers, the trade organization representing the country's largest marketers, ended last night with a wide-ranging assessment of what one speaker, Douglas M. Sweeny of International Business Machines, described as ''a business revolution that strikes terror.''</p>
        <p>That revolution is, of course, the technological upheaval embodied by the Internet. And while it was difficult to find any of the estimated 400 attendees of the conference who would admit to being terror-stricken, concern about the abrupt and wrenching dislocations of the last year in interactive marketing and advertising were evident in many of the questions asked of the speakers.</p>

        <p>THE 2000 annual conference of the Association of National Advertisers, the trade organization representing the country's largest marketers, ended last night with a wide-ranging assessment of what one speaker, Douglas M. Sweeny of International Business Machines, described as ''a business revolution that strikes terror.''</p>
        <p>That revolution is, of course, the technological upheaval embodied by the Internet. And while it was difficult to find any of the estimated 400 attendees of the conference who would admit to being terror-stricken, concern about the abrupt and wrenching dislocations of the last year in interactive marketing and advertising were evident in many of the questions asked of the speakers.</p>
        <p>''If e-business is going to work, it cannot be an add-on or an afterthought,'' said Joe M. Weller, chairman and chief executive of the Nestle USA unit of the Swiss food giant Nestle S.A. ''It has to become part of every function.''</p>
        <p>And even then, he said, it must be done with the realization that ''the Internet is about possibility, not technology, that technology is never an end in itself but a tool.'' For instance, said Mr. Weller, who sells brands like Butterfinger candy, Stouffer's frozen foods and Carnation evaporated milk, ''in our business-to-consumer strategy, we were a Web page designer's dream -- we'd built a separate Web site for every brand.''</p>
        <p>Now, he said, ''We've been consolidating some of our online energies, redefining our mission, if you will, to help consumers get not just the products but the information they want.''</p>
        <p>One topic that was discussed at several points in the conference, which began Friday, was what Mark Kvamme, a partner at Sequoia Capital, a venture capital company, called ''the constantly connected consumer and what that means for your brands.''</p>
        <p>Because of the Internet, cellular telephones and wireless devices, he said, ''branding is moving from one-way lectures to two-way conversations, but we are not prepared for consumers to talk back.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kvamme, who has extensive experience at technology companies and online businesses, asserted that in the future, the brand manager -- the employee at a consumer product company responsible for a brand's operations and its ultimate success -- ''will be sort of an air traffic controller.'' This person will simultaneously juggle the delivery of sales pitches through TV, radio, print, promotions, personal computers, personal digital assistants and the wireless Internet.</p>
        <p>''The technology flies the planes,'' he added, ''but it still takes a person to figure out what the right thing to do is.''</p>
        <p>Someone trying to do just that is John H. Costello, president and chief executive of MVP.com Inc., an Internet retailer of sporting goods and outdoor gear that opened for business in January.</p>
        <p>''Every day I'm learning something new, what works and doesn't work,'' said Mr. Costello, who has worked for traditional marketers and retailers like Pepsi-Cola and Sears, Roebuck &amp; Company. ''It's a very humbling experience.''</p>
        <p>''We're seeing five years of industry consolidation being compressed at Internet speed,'' he added. ''It's taking one, two, five months.''</p>
        <p>''The good news is that there are more ways to build brands and connect to consumers than ever before,'' Mr. Costello said. ''The bad news is that consumers are bombarded by more brands, more advertising than ever before'' -- just when ''building a strong and distinctive brand identity is more important than ever before.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Costello advised Internet companies to ''set realistic goals'' and ''be frugal: ideas rule but cash is king.'' And speaking of cash, the path to profitability for MVP.com, which was ''originally three to four years,'' he said, ''has been accelerated down to under two years.'' MVP.com is partly owned by the former athletes John Elway, Wayne Gretzky and Michael Jordan.</p>
        <p>''There's a whole new universe of opportunities and challenges,'' said Mr. Sweeny, who is vice president of business strategy at I.B.M. ''We're within a couple years of seeing this revolution come to pass.''</p>
        <p>As an example, Mr. Sweeny predicted the advent of ''intelligent packaging,'' in which ''your can of coffee senses when it's low and asks your refrigerator to dial Peapod to directly reorder.''</p>
        <p>''Tell me about the traditional role advertising and marketing plays and how it gets into that loop,'' he said. ''Do you really understand the preferences of each of your customers and have you really thought about your buyer's attributes?''</p>
        <p>Finally, Bruce L. Claflin, president and chief operating officer of the 3Com Corporation, discussed how his company, which specializes in network computing, is remaking itself with new advertising from Lowe Lintas &amp; Partners, part of the Lowe Group unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies, and a new corporate logo from Interbrand, part of the Omnicom Group.</p>
        <p>''3Com has changed to a 'brand-centric' company that markets technology,'' Mr. Claflin said. Previously, ''we developed products and we assumed they'd create a brand.''</p>
        <p>''Now we're designing a brand and developing products to fit it,'' Mr. Claflin said. ''If they don't fit, we don't proceed, no matter how exciting the technology is.''</p>
        <p>That was why 3Com spun off the operations of its successful Palm brand of hand-held organizers, he added, because Palm was ''not a networking company.''</p>
        <p>And that is why 3Com is redesigning its World Wide Web site, Mr. Claflin said, in keeping with the new Lowe Lintas campaign theme, ''simple sets you free.''</p>
        <p>''Our Web site doesn't fully live up to that promise,'' he explained. ''We find it a little confusing, a little cluttered, so we are simplifying it.''</p>
