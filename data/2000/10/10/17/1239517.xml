        <p>In 1993, a little over a year after the Soviet Union crumbled, the Chevron Corporation planted its flag in a remote corner of a country that had just appeared on the map, Kazakhstan. While most other oil concerns hesitated, Chevron bet big on the Tengiz field, buying a 50 percent stake in a huge find of six billion to nine billion barrels of oil hard against the Caspian Sea and far from any pipeline.</p>
        <p>After years of struggle, Chevron now has a field that pumps about 240,000 barrels a day and a pipeline that will begin operating next year.</p>
        <p>Such bets have given Chevron a reputation for aggressive innovation. By contrast,  Texaco, once a contender, is now considered something of a has-been. Through a mix of bad management and bad luck, the company has seen production decline and its share prices falter.</p>
        <p>The two disparate companies formally announced Chevron's acquisition yesterday of a clearly weaker Texaco, in a marriage of convenience that will allow them to thrive in an industry that has rapidly and fundamentally changed. The last two years of mergers have produced industry mammoths like Exxon Mobil and BP Amoco, now known as BP. Smaller companies like Chevron and Texaco face the risk of losing out on oil projects and investor interest if they stay small.</p>
        <p>''It's apparent now that scale and size are important as the supermajor oil companies have come on the scene,'' said Peter I. Bijur, chairman of Texaco. ''We want to do the right thing for our shareholders and create a U.S.-based company that can compete worldwide.''</p>
        <p>Chevron had tried once before, in May 1999, to acquire Texaco, but its $37.5 billion offer was rejected. ''It was a low-ball, cheap proposal,'' one of the people close to the talks said at the time.</p>
        <p>But Texaco, chastened by waning market interest and its own missteps, seemed ready to take an even lower offer this year and also agreed to what had once been an irksome proposition: that a Chevron executive run the company. Once all the necessary approvals are received, Chevron's chief executive, David J. O'Reilly, would serve as the head of the new company, to be called Chevron Texaco, and Mr. Bijur would be a vice chairman. The corporate headquarters would be in San Francisco, Chevron's home.</p>
        <p>Yet it is precisely new management that Texaco seemed to need, said industry analysts, who welcomed the deal. ''This is pretty much a win-win situation,'' said Scott Smith, oil analyst with Dresdner Kleinwort Benson. ''Texaco has good assets and Chevron has the management to turn them around.''</p>
        <p>Shares of Chevron fell $2.25 yesterday, to $82; Texaco rose $3.88, to $59.</p>
        <p>Under the terms of the $36 billion deal, Chevron will swap 0.77 share -- the equivalent of $64.87 based on Friday's closing price -- for every share of Texaco. That is a premium of about 18 percent over the $55.13 that Texaco's stock closed at on Friday. Chevron will also assume about $7 billion of Texaco's debt.</p>
        <p>Some observers said that merging the two companies' cultures would prove challenging. Of the two, Chevron is thought to have a more streamlined, quick-paced operating style, giving its managers wider latitude to make decisions on their own.</p>
        <p>Texaco's managers and executives, by contrast, are said to have a more deliberate, cautious style. Admirers call Texaco the more ''disciplined'' company, but those who find its culture frustrating joke that even hiring a secretary at Texaco requires making a policy decision.</p>
        <p>''Texaco has always been a little bit more bureaucratic,'' said Louis Gagliardi, vice president and senior analyst at John S. Herold Inc. in Norwalk, Conn. ''It's had a history of leaders that came from the military. Chevron may have a little bit more of an aggressive, open attitude, whereas Texaco may have more of an over-analytical side.</p>
        <p>''Texaco would bring 10 people to a meeting; Chevron would bring two,'' Mr. Gagliardi added. ''So things moved along a little faster at Chevron. Texaco would get bombed out on the minutiae sometimes.''</p>
        <p>One retired senior Chevron executive recalled that during his management years he was paired with a Texaco counterpart on a joint venture. He noticed, he said, that his own superiors quickly approved or rejected proposals, but his Texaco partner seemed to get endless requests for more detail, only to have the proposal shot down.</p>
        <p>When the Chevron man asked what the problem was, the Texaco partner told him: ''When it comes to these difficult questions, you have to think of us as rolling along in a tank and looking out of this little slit window. That's what we want to see.''</p>
        <p>The retired Chevron executive, who did not want to be identified, said he thought that in the long run, moving slowly and defensively had cost Texaco business.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gagliardi said that as the acquisition goes forward, Texaco employees might have a difficult time adjusting to Chevron's methods.</p>
        <p>''The Chevron people will slowly push the Texaco people out of the way,'' he predicted. ''Only the best and the brightest will be kept.''</p>
        <p>Some observers said that Texaco had taken unusual steps to update its culture in recent years, and lamented the possibility that its refinements might be lost in the merger.</p>
        <p>Texaco's institutional changes were motivated by a scandal that hit in 1996, when, in the midst of defending a race-discrimination lawsuit, the company learned that a downsized executive had handed over tapes of business meetings in which he and colleagues were recorded disparaging minority groups and planning the destruction of documents related to the suit.</p>
        <p>Texaco quickly settled the suit for $175 million, and agreed to the creation of an outside task force that would revamp and monitor its management processes.</p>
        <p>''Those experiences were probably formative in making them understand that as corporate citizens, much is expected of them,'' said Dirk Forrister, energy program manager at the Environmental Defense Fund.</p>
        <p>Mr. Forrister said that in the wake of the scandal, he had noticed Texaco moving ahead of Chevron in such areas as climate-change research and alternative-fuels ventures.</p>
        <p>Others pointed to deliberate efforts to promote racial diversity and demystify Texaco's decision-making processes.</p>
        <p>''How that culture is going to merge with Chevron I don't know,'' said Gerald C. Meyers, former chairman of the American Motors Corporation and a professor of organizational behavior at the University of Michigan's business school. ''I suspect that Texaco is going to end up being the subservient organization.''</p>
        <p>The two companies argue that they know each other well, from their years as partners in the Caltex refining and marketing joint venture in Asia and Africa, and more recently, as neighbors in some of the most promising new oil regions in the world. In Kazakhstan, for example, the combined company could build a pipeline connecting a Texaco gas condensate field to the main artery from the Tengiz site.</p>
        <p>Both companies are actively exploring technically complex deep-water sites, which the industry believes will yield some of the biggest oil finds of the future. The merger would give the combined company the greatest number of leases to oil reservoirs far below the waters of the Gulf of Mexico. Chevron Texaco would also become an even more powerful presence in the deep-water offshore areas of Brazil and West Africa. ''Through this combination, we will be better able to fund and better invest in deep-water places,'' Mr. O'Reilly said.</p>
        <p>Analysts said that the new company might pick the most promising fields and sell others to smaller independent companies. The combined company is expected to jettison much of its refining and marketing business on the West Coast, albeit primarily because of anticipated regulatory pressure.</p>
        <p>The proposed acquisition will be reviewed by the Federal Trade Commission, which has imposed greater restrictions on oil deals as the industry has consolidated. Robert Pitofsky, the agency's chairman, nearly blocked BP Amoco's $30 billion acquisition of ARCO, clearing the deal only after the companies agreed to sell one of its crown jewels -- ARCO's large oil holdings in Alaska -- to Phillips Petroleum for $7 billion.</p>
        <p>Together, Texaco and Chevron would control about 30 percent to 40 percent of the gasoline market in California, and most analysts expect the F.T.C. to compel the sale of much of those assets. Texaco would most likely pull out of Equilon, its joint venture with the Shell Oil Company that handles refining and marketing west of the Mississippi River. The concern is that the new company might not get as high a price if the market knew it was forced to sell certain holdings, but some analysts said that such losses at the margins did not hurt the overall attractiveness of the deal.</p>
        <p>But it remains unclear what role Mr. Pitofsky will play in the Chevron-Texaco deal, because it is by no means certain he will remain at the agency. The chairman of the F.T.C. serves at the pleasure of the president, and if Vice President Gore wins the election, there is a broad expectation that Mr. Pitofsky would continue in his post. On the other hand, if Gov. George W. Bush were to prevail, it is not known who would lead the agency. Condoleezza Rice, Mr. Bush's foreign policy adviser, is a Chevron board member.</p>
