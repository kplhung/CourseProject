        <p>Two brothers, 13-year-old identical twins, were arrested early yesterday in the rape and robbery of a 40-year-old woman in the Bronx on Sunday, the police said.</p>
        <p>A police official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said yesterday that the boys had also been arrested in 1998 and charged with sexually abusing a 5-year-old cousin in the Bronx. But the boys' mother said that the 1998 charges were eventually dismissed for lack of evidence.</p>
        <p>The boys, seventh graders at Public School 306, live in the University Heights section of the Bronx with their grandmother, who has custody of them. At the time of Sunday's attack they were in the Morris Heights section visiting their mother, who lives in the same building as the victim.</p>
        <p>The attack took place about 8 p.m. Sunday, as the victim and her 2-year-old son were returning to their apartment, the police said. The boys' mother had been holding a birthday party for one of the twins' friends at her home one floor below the victim's apartment, the mother said.</p>
        <p>Detective Joseph Marra of the Bronx Special Victims Squad testified at a court hearing yesterday that the suspects approached the woman near the entrance to her building and asked if they could help her carry her groceries upstairs. The woman declined, Detective Marra said, and as she and her toddler were entering their apartment, the boys shoved their way inside.</p>
        <p>One of the boys grabbed the victim and when she struggled with him, scratching at his face, he dragged her into the bedroom, hit her with a large bottle of water and then raped her, Detective Marra said.</p>
        <p>The other boy restrained the toddler, pushing him to the floor and holding his mouth as he cried out, Detective Marra said. The toddler witnessed the attack on his mother, the police said. The suspects then took $375 in cash from the woman's purse and fled, the police said.</p>
        <p>The victim and her son, were treated at Lincoln Hospital and released, the police said. Detective Marra said that the toddler was treated for bruises around both cheeks and eyes.</p>
        <p>The police have charged both suspects with rape, robbery, burglary and sexual abuse, all in the first degree, and with second-degree assault.</p>
        <p>Judge Tandra Dawson of Family Court  ordered that the boys, one of whom had scratches on his face, remain in the custody of the city's Department of Juvenile Justice until their arraignment, which is scheduled for Thursday.</p>
        <p>In presenting the case yesterday, a court official said that the twins had no prior criminal history, although one of them was twice suspended from school. The other boy is a special education student, the official said.</p>
        <p>The boys' mother said that she had picked the boys up from their grandmother's home on Sunday morning and taken them to a basketball court, where they spent the day with a group of friends. The twins and their friends returned to their mother's apartment about 8 p.m.</p>
        <p>About 8:30 p.m., the mother said, the twins went outside to round up friends who were still playing. They returned 15 minutes later with three or four other boys, she said.</p>
        <p>The mother seemed skeptical that the twins, whom the police say are about 5 feet tall and weigh about 110 pounds each, were physically capable of the rape. ''They didn't rape any 40-year-old woman,'' she said. ''There had to be somebody else there with them.'' She added, ''They're so little and skinny.''</p>
        <p>The mother said her apartment door was ajar while her sons were outside, but that she heard no struggle. She learned that something had happened in the building when, about 9:15 p.m., a group of police officers interrupted the birthday party to ask if anyone had seen an 18-year-old and a 19- or 20-year-old, she said.</p>
        <p>The police official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said the victim said that she had been attacked by the sons of a woman who lives in her building. ''She knew who the perpetrators were,'' the official said. ''She recognized them and informed us that these are the sons of the woman who lives downstairs.''</p>
        <p>About 2 a.m. yesterday, the police arrived at the Soundview home of the boys' aunt, with whom they were spending the night. The boys were whisked from the beds where they were sleeping and arrested, a police official said.</p>
        <p>When she arrived home from court yesterday, the mother spoke to the twins by phone. They told her that they had carried the victim's groceries upstairs at her request, but began to argue and fight with her when she refused to tip them.</p>
        <p>''They say they're innocent,'' the twins' mother said, ''but I don't know because I wasn't there.''</p>
