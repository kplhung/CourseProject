        <p>After being criticized as too pushy in the first debate and too subdued in the next, Vice President Al Gore turned to average citizens again today to help him prepare for his third and final encounter with Gov. George W. Bush.</p>
        <p>Their message to him was pretty simple: be yourself.</p>
        <p>Secluded at a sprawling wooded resort 50 miles west of St. Louis, Mr. Gore brought together 10 of the average citizens who helped prepare him on his first two debates and 13 other citizens from Missouri as he sought to repeat the best of his earlier performances and eliminate the worst.</p>
        <p>The final debate, at 9 p.m. on Tuesday -- the candidates' last sure-fire way of reaching millions of voters in what may be the closest election in four decades -- will be in the style of a town meeting, in which citizens selected by the Gallup organization  will ask the questions. A third of the participants are undecided; a third favor Mr. Gore and a third prefer Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>The vice president also had on hand his paid consultants, including Carter Eskew and Bob Shrum, two of his daughters, Karenna Gore Schiff and Sarah Gore, as well as policy experts like Leon Fuerth, his national security adviser in the vice president's office, and Robert O. Boorstin, a former official in the Clinton White House with an expertise in mental health policy.</p>
        <p>William M. Daley, Mr. Gore's campaign chairman, said the vice president's goal was to combine ''the intensity of the first debate with the genuineness of the second.'' Mr. Daley also said that the vice president ''seems much more determined in the last 36 hours'' than he had been before the previous debates.</p>
        <p>Gore advisers said that he would return to themes he emphasized in the first debate, including the role of the Clinton administration in the current economic expansion.</p>
        <p>''His best line in Boston,'' one adviser said, ''came when he made the point that there were a lot of innovative entrepreneurs in America in the 1980's, too, but without the right policies they couldn't get the economy started. He wants to hit that again.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Daley also said that Mr. Bush's Texas record was fair game. And the vice president can be expected, as he did in the second debate, to play down his views on gun control. Mr. Daley said that the National Rifle Association had effectively spent millions of dollars on television commercials scaring sportsmen and hunters into believing that Mr. Gore wanted to take away their guns.</p>
        <p>''He has to reiterate that he's in favor of sportsmen having guns because the N.R.A. is saying in Pennsylvania and Michigan that he wants to take your guns away,'' Mr. Daley said. ''He's got to reassure people that this isn't true.''</p>
        <p>But there seemed to be general agreement -- among the ordinary people, the professional consultants and independent analysts -- that Mr. Gore's chief challenge was to unify and stabilize the shifting personalities he has displayed throughout the campaign and particularly during the first two debates.</p>
        <p>''He needs to be himself and be explicit about his beliefs,'' said Claudia Amboyer, a sixth-grade teacher in Macomb, Mich., and one of the original group of citizen-advisers. Dr. Miller William Boyd, a psychologist from St. Louis, who is among the new group, said, ''Be yourself, no matter what people tell you,'' adding: ''He should appear not to be so conciliatory because he looks like he's trying to appease everyone and he doesn't have to do that.''</p>
        <p>Peter Hart, a Democratic pollster  in Washington, said that Mr. Gore needed to be the candidate he was at the Democratic National Convention. ''For Al Gore, what it comes down to is going back and finding the inner voice he had at the convention,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''Voters have seen too many Al Gores in the last two debates,'' he added. ''He's got to be the person he's going to be in the next four years.'' Leaving aside the question of whether Mr. Gore knew who he was, Mr. Hart said of the differing personas he had presented in the debates: ''The voter gets confused.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hart added: ''When everything is said and done about George W. Bush, he may be wearing the dunce's hat but the voter senses that he's comfortable with himself and they perceive him to be engaging and likable and straightforward and honest, and those aren't inconsiderable traits.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore found his first session this morning with the real people so valuable that instead of rehearse in the afternoon with his political advisers, he held a second session with the unpaid advisers.</p>
        <p>At the opening of the first, which reporters were allowed to attend for just a few minutes, Mr. Gore said that if he is elected president, ''I will have regular open meetings all across the country with citizens from all walks of life to help shape the agenda of the Gore-Lieberman administration.''</p>
        <p>The original group of citizen-advisers were voters whom Mr. Gore met along the campaign trail. The campaign brought them to Sarasota, Fla., for three days while he prepared for the first debate, then talked with him by conference call before the second debate in North Carolina.</p>
        <p>Unusually for a presidential candidate just three weeks before an election, Mr. Gore is spending three full days out of the public eye, with no campaign events Sunday, Monday or Tuesday. Some of this is in deference to the Middle East crisis, which is dominating the news. And Mr. Gore does not plan to travel Wednesday until after the memorial service for the American sailors killed in Yemen is conducted.</p>
        <p>But it also gives him a chance to focus intently on how to repair the damage he seems to have done to himself in the first two debates. One senior adviser said the consensus within the Gore circle was that Mr. Gore did more harm when he muzzled himself in the second debate, than when he forcefully argued with Mr. Bush in the first.</p>
        <p>Mr. Daley said that because the election appeared so close, he did not expect anything dramatic from either candidate. ''I think both of these candidates are going to be cautious about doing something really bold or out of the box that blows up in their face,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Daley said, ''I don't think you play it safe. I think you try to be very natural and lay out in a forward way the compelling reasons for the election to go in your way.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hart agreed that seeking the advice of ordinary people seemed to be a useful strategy. ''The debate strategy is to get rid of all the strategists and all the people who teach you how to think tactically and just stop and decide how you connect with the American people,'' he said. ''You've spent a lifetime thinking about running for president of the United States. This is your last chance to connect. Feel comfortable to reach inside yourself and say, 'You know, I can answer that question and not parse it 14 different ways.' ''</p>
        <p>When the debate is over, just three weeks will remain until Election Day. ''It's coming to a close,'' Mr. Daley mused. ''So I think both campaigns would have a lot of urgency and a lot of stress and a lot of anxiety going on right now because this is getting onto the final in a race that, according to the vast majority of polls, private and public, is a horse race.''</p>
