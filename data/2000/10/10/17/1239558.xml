        <p>Mary Seidman  TriBeCa Performing Arts Center</p>
        <p>''Mary Seidman &amp; Dancers &amp; Friends'' was an unwieldy but suggestive title for the program Ms. Seidman and her company presented on Friday night when it opened the three-part TriBeCa Dance series. It was easy to imagine that the performers and choreographers were all friends working together to realize their own ideas of dance. But much of it was disappointing.</p>
        <p>''Walkabout Part I,'' created in 1996 by a guest choreographer, Tina Croll, and set to a burbling score by John Cage, was the high point. Two small creatures (Francisco Rider da Silva and the radiant Ms. Seidman) scurried about the stage on antic, mysterious journeys. Ellen Cornfield, also a guest, was a glamorous and charming creature in her solo ''The Conversation,'' performed to music by Bill Fontana. But who was she and why was she writhing on the floor to the sound of trains?</p>
        <p>What set these two pieces apart was their conciseness. Ms. Seidman's company (Hsin-Ping Chang, Brett Howard, Mr. da Silver, Renee Smith, Ian Woolley and Ms. Seidman) coursed through her new ''On Hold'' and ''Tides'' with a lightness and poise one associates with Merce Cunningham. But the dances themselves spooled out amorphously, to music by Bruce Tovsky (''On Hold'') and Marin Marais (''Tides'').</p>
        <p>The prolixity of Mr. da Silva's passionate, anguished new ''Violating Spaces,'' set to music by Maryann Mursal and Ariel Guzik, suggests the need for more choreographic experience. The Seidman company also included Harry Mavromichalis. The TriBeCa series, at the Borough of Manhattan Community College at 199 Chambers Street, continues with performances by Roots of Brazil in mid-November and Mark DeGarmo and Dancers in early December.</p>
