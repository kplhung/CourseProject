        <p>As part of labor's effort to help Vice President Al Gore, Minnie Sanchez, a middle-school teacher in San Antonio, came to Michigan today to tell hundreds of union members some unflattering things about life under Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.</p>
        <p>Speaking to 120 union members in this heavily Republican city, Ms. Sanchez sharply attacked Mr. Bush's record, saying Texas ranks 46th in child poverty, 37th in education spending per student and 49th in the percentage of children without health insurance.</p>
        <p>''George Bush talks in warm, fuzzy and compassionate conservative images,'' she said. ''But that's not the George W. Bush we know at home. He says he will leave no children behind. But the fact is he has left many children behind.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Sanchez and several other union members from Texas -- a sheet-metal worker, a corrections officer and a retired cafeteria worker -- have spoken to labor audiences in 15 cities. The A.F.L.-C.I.O. calls them  ''The Texas Truth Squad.'' The Bush campaign views them as an irksome propaganda squad.</p>
        <p>The Texans acknowledge that they are largely preaching to the choir, but they hope their assaults on Mr. Bush's record will inspire union members to campaign actively for Mr. Gore. The A.F.L.-C.I.O. has sent these Texans to speak to 2,000 union members in Los Angeles, 1,500 in Cleveland and 1,200 in New York City.</p>
        <p>They have repeatedly portrayed Mr. Bush as indifferent to working families, hostile to unions and cozy with corporations and the rich. Alex Flores, the sheet-metal worker, attacked Mr. Bush for not pushing to change his state's $3.35-an-hour minimum wage, which is paid to many Texas farm workers not covered by the $5.15-an-hour federal minimum. And Irenier Ford, who retired last year after working for 28 years in a school cafeteria, criticized Mr. Bush's Social Security proposals, saying he would push up the age for full benefits to age 70 and hurt struggling retirees like herself.</p>
        <p>''I want you all to help me to tell Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney to keep their hands off of our Social Security,'' Ms. Ford said, standing near a pumpkin-covered poster saying, ''When working families vote, working families win.''</p>
        <p>The roving squad of Texans, accompanied today by John J. Sweeney, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s president, is meant to restore support for Mr. Gore among union members who soured on him because he supported the bill to liberalize trade with China. To drum up union support, labor leaders are roaming the Midwest in buses, while thousands of shop stewards are distributing millions of pro-Gore fliers at factories and offices.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sweeney said, ''We're the reason he won the nomination, and we will be the margin of victory on Nov. 7. We got behind Gore because he and Bill Clinton have been real champions of working families and of unions over the past almost eight years. With the exception of trade issues, they have been there for us when we needed them.''</p>
        <p>Bush campaign officials insist that the so-called truth squad is often untruthful and is guilty of nonstop negative campaigning.</p>
        <p>Ray Sullivan, a spokesman for the campaign, said, ''Governor Bush is running well among rank-and-file union members in places like Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania. But unfortunately the leadership of some of these unions are spreading false and misleading attacks against the governor.''</p>
        <p>He said, for instance, that Mr. Bush had said that under his plan benefits for current retirees or people about to retire must not be changed and would not be changed.</p>
        <p>Lorra Espey, a member of the carpenters' union in Grand Rapids, said she found the Texans informative. ''If you're from Michigan, you don't know what's happening in Texas,'' she said. ''If that's what Bush is like, I don't want him.''</p>
        <p>But George Semposki, who works at a General Motors stamping plant here, said it seemed frustrating that the Texas union members were just talking to the converted. ''I wish they were talking not only to this crowd,'' he said. ''I wish they were talking to the general public, which hasn't heard these things.''</p>
