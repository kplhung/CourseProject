        <p>Rick A. Lazio and Hillary Rodham Clinton battled for votes in upstate New York today, with Mr. Lazio charging that Mrs. Clinton would bring a return of Mario M. Cuomo's economic policies, and Mrs. Clinton asserting that her opponent had ''turned his back completely on upstate New York'' by failing to offer a plan to stimulate its economy.</p>
        <p>With Gov. George E. Pataki at his side, Mr. Lazio invoked the memory of Mr. Cuomo, the former Democratic governor, in the calculation that the animosity that contributed to Mr. Cuomo's defeat, particularly in this part of New York, remains fresh six years later.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki repeatedly likened Mrs. Clinton to Mr. Cuomo, suggesting that Mr. Lazio would enjoy the the same kind of victory he did over a well-known Democrat in an overwhelmingly Democratic state.</p>
        <p>''It's 1994 all over again,'' Mr. Pataki said. ''When you look at Mrs. Clinton, when you think of her policies, it is Mario Cuomo redux.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio said Mrs. Clinton's proposal for targeted tax cuts was a reprise of economic policies pushed by Mr. Cuomo that, Mr. Lazio said, had undercut the region's economy.</p>
        <p>''We are not going back to the old ways, the old Cuomo ways,'' Mr. Lazio said. ''Targeted tax relief for him was another way of trying to mask the fact that he was for tax increases. We don't want to go back on that path. We want to march forward.''</p>
        <p>Hours later, Mrs. Clinton visited a steel plant here and then offered one of her toughest attacks on her Republican opponent to date, asserting that he had failed to offer a plan to help this part of the state.</p>
        <p>''I really don't know what he sees when he comes upstate, or who he talks to, or what he knows about the economy here, because he has turned his back completely on western New York and the rest of upstate New York,'' she said. ''And instead, my opponent is trying very hard to run a campaign of insults and attacks against me.''</p>
        <p>''My opponent wants to talk about me, but I'm going to talk about you,'' Mrs. Clinton told a cheering crowd at a rally for Hispanic supporters at a gymnasium in the Father Belle Community Center.</p>
        <p>The exchange today marked a notable escalation in the campaign, and it reflected the calculation on both sides that competing news events -- in particular, the prospect of a Subway Series and unrest in the Middle East -- may overshadow the final days of this race. Although a number of polls have shown Mrs. Clinton with a slight lead over Mr. Lazio, her aides believe the contest remains volatile.</p>
        <p>Accordingly, her aides said, she will give a speech in New York on Tuesday on foreign policy, a topic chosen largely because her aides think the sight of the first lady giving a speech on international affairs could serve to stir doubts among some voters about whether Mr. Lazio has the experience and stature to be a member of the Senate.</p>
        <p>The subject and venue of today's events reflected the unusual extent to which this part of New York seems to be in play. That is not good news for Mr. Lazio, considering that this is historically a solidly Republican part of the state. But Mrs. Clinton has put in an unusual amount of time here, for a Democrat, and Mr. Lazio came under criticism from even some upstate Republicans for suggesting at the candidates' first debate that the economy had turned a corner.</p>
        <p>Ideally, Mr. Lazio should be a able to spend these last few weeks of the race in places that are considered more up for grabs -- like the suburbs. Today was his eighth day in a row of campaigning upstate. Mrs. Clinton is returning upstate Tuesday and again on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton released a new advertisement tonight that she distributed only to television stations in upstate.  ''Hillary has a serious plan to create 200,000 new jobs upstate,'' the ad said. The announcer, citing remarks Mr. Lazio made here today, said that Mr. Lazio ''thinks upstate doesn't need targeted economic help.''</p>
        <p>For his part, Mr. Lazio attached himself firmly to Mr. Pataki, a popular figure upstate who has, until now, played a relatively low-key role in Mr. Lazio's campaign. In the process, he seemed to be adopting some of the folklore of Mr. Pataki's campaign of 1994, in which the little-known state senator from Peekskill came from behind to defeat Mr. Cuomo.</p>
        <p>Several of Mr. Lazio's supporters have drawn implicit comparisons in recent weeks to that campaign, arguing that Mrs. Clinton will prove as disliked today as Mr. Cuomo was then, and that Mr. Lazio will be the same kind of deceptively strong candidate that Mr. Pataki was.</p>
        <p>The comparisons seemed quite explicit today, and it was often Mr. Pataki who sounded as if he were back on the campaign trail. ''Well, Mrs. Clinton, just as I said to Mario Cuomo, you can't do it but I can when it comes to cutting taxes in 1994,'' Mr. Pataki said. ''You can't do across-the-board tax cuts; Rick Lazio can and will when he's the U.S. senator.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki continued: ''If any of you doubt the differences between Rick Lazio and Mrs. Clinton and similarities between Mrs. Clinton and Mario Cuomo, it comes to government spending. The era of big government could be back. The era of Cuomonomics would be back. The era of tax cuts and job creation would be over.''</p>
        <p>At her own news conference, Mrs. Clinton did not offer a defense of Mr. Cuomo to the attacks on the former governor, a reflection of her own campaign's concern about Mr. Cuomo's popularity here. ''That's laughable and desperate,'' she said. ''They don't want to talk about the issues. My opponent doesn't want to tell us what he would do in the Senate.</p>
        <p>''I've come forth with specific ideas about what I would do in the Senate. My opponent has ignored upstate New York. He has refused to come forward with specific plans.''</p>
        <p>In fact, Mr. Lazio has proposed a larger, and more general tax cut, that includes the elimination of the so-called marriage penalty and making the payroll tax deductible from the income tax. Mr. Lazio argued that his plan would lead to increased prosperity in the state, and thus provide a lift for upstate New York. He has given a speech laying out his tax cut plan and another talking about proposals to improve education.</p>
        <p>In his comments to the crowd here, Mr. Lazio repeated many of the themes he has discussed throughout his campaign, namely about the need to offer an across-the-board tax cut.</p>
        <p>As is often the case in Mr. Lazio's campaign events, as much emphasis was placed on Mrs. Clinton than on Mr. Lazio's proposals, with each speaker at the rally assailing the Democratic nominee. While some, like Mr. Pataki and Mr. Lazio, criticized her directly, not all would utter the first lady's name. One was Joel Giambra, the Erie County executive, a Republican, who offered a sharp critique of the economic policies of ''the president, and that woman.''</p>
