        <p>The Corixa Corporation agreed yesterday to buy Coulter Pharmaceutical, gaining access to a potentially promising cancer drug and a sales force. The acquisition, for stock worth about $900 million when the deal was announced, is one of the largest ever between two biotechnology companies.</p>
        <p>Corixa, based in Seattle, is developing various vaccines and other drugs that aim to harness the body's immune system to fight disease. Coulter, based in South San Francisco, works in the closely related area of monoclonal antibodies, which are engineered versions of proteins the immune system uses to fend off bacteria or viruses.</p>
        <p>The combined company should be ''a major force in the emerging field of immunotherapy,'' Steven Gillis, chairman and chief executive of Corixa, said in a conference call. But the market reacted somewhat negatively, sending Corixa's stock down $4.50, or about 10 percent, to $39.69.</p>
        <p>Under the agreement, announced before the start of trading yesterday, each share of Coulter stock will be exchanged for 1.003 shares of Corixa stock. At Corixa's closing price Friday of $44.19, that valued Coulter at $44.32 a share, a 43 percent premium over its closing price on Friday. Coulter shares rose $3.94 yesterday, to $34.88, staying well below Corixa's offering price and indicating that investors are not sure the deal will be completed.</p>
        <p>Coulter's crown jewel is Bexxar, a drug for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that could reach the market as early as next year and become the first product consisting of a monoclonal antibody linked to a radioactive isotope. The idea is that the antibody will zero in on cancerous cells and deliver the radioactive payload to those cells, minimizing radiation exposure to the rest of the body.</p>
        <p>Coulter, which will share marketing and profits with SmithKline Beecham, applied last month to the Food and Drug administration for permission to sell Bexxar. The F.D.A. is expected to decide by mid-November whether to accept the application for review, and, if so, could decide to approve the drug by early next year.</p>
        <p>This has caused some analysts and investors to question why Coulter's management is selling the company now, rather than waiting for an approval that could raise the company's stock price.</p>
        <p>''If Coulter's management believed in the ultimate success of Bexxar, why are they willing to sell the company for $900 million?'' said Robert J. Toth Jr., an analyst with Prudential Vector Healthcare.</p>
        <p>Last year, the F.D.A. rejected Coulter's application, requiring the company to spend a year reworking its data. If the application is rejected again, Corixa will be able to walk away from the deal by making a $15 million loan to Coulter.</p>
        <p>Michael F. Bigham, president and chief executive of Coulter, said management was not selling out. Coulter shareholders will own about 45 percent of the combined company's stock, which would still rise or fall on Bexxar. ''I guess if we were taking cash and going home, that's what selling out means to me,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Rachel Leheny, an analyst with Lehman Brothers, said Corixa might be paying too much because the market for Bexxar could be smaller than expected.</p>
        <p>The merged company will keep the name Corixa and be run by Dr. Gillis. Mr. Bigham of Coulter will become vice chairman but will not have a day-to-day operating role.</p>
        <p>Corixa is unusually acquisitive for a biotechnology company, having bought three other companies in the last couple of years. But this would be by far its largest acquisition.</p>
        <p>Thomas J. Dietz, an analyst at Pacific Growth Equities in San Francisco, said Coulter might have seen the need for a merger because it has no product ready to follow Bexxar quickly. ''The gap to the next product is so big Coulter had to do something to fill the pipeline,'' he said. Corixa, on the other hand, has several drugs in late-stage clinical trials and is close to filing for approval to sell its first drug, Melacine, for melanoma, a skin cancer.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dietz, whose company served as the investment banker for Corixa, said the merger was a rare one of two healthy, if still unprofitable, biotech companies.</p>
