        <p>The swimmer Jenny Thompson, smiling assuredly in a crimson leather skirt and suede sneakers to match, shrugged off the paradox that most of her Olympic medals came as a member of relay teams when she accepted the Women's Sports Foundation Sportswoman of the Year award yesterday.</p>
        <p>She is the consummate team player, and yet Thompson won the Foundation's award for individual achievement during the past year.</p>
        <p>Venus and Serena Williams, who won the doubles title at Wimbledon and the Olympic Games, captured the team award for Sportswomen of the Year in the ceremony at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel.</p>
        <p>Thompson, 27, became the most decorated female athlete in Olympic history when she won her 10th career medal at the Sydney Games; her total includes eight gold medals in three Olympics.</p>
        <p>But even though Thompson set world records in two events in the year leading up to the Olympics, she had to settle for a bronze medal in the 100-meter freestyle, an event in which she tied for third with Dara Torres. It was Thompson's first Olympic medal at the Sydney Games in an individual event. She also helped capture three gold medals in relays in Sydney.</p>
        <p>The award for Sportswoman of the Year recognized her individual achievements from August 1999 to July 2000; the votes were tabulated before the Olympics.</p>
        <p>''It wasn't my best meet ever, but I feel like it was our team's best meet and as captain, I'd like to think in some way I helped that happen,'' Thompson said. ''It makes up for any personal disappointment I might have had.''</p>
        <p>Thompson, who anchored the women's 4x200 freestyle relay, has spent the two weeks since the Olympics ended traveling throughout the United States, making appearances on television talk shows and speaking to various groups. She plans to enroll at Columbia Medical School next year, and for now, she is enjoying the break from swimming.</p>
        <p>''More than the medals themselves, just seeing people's reactions here and the pride they had because of my swims and relays, that's been the greatest part of being a top athlete,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The Women's Sports Foundation also presented an award to Martina Navratilova for her impact on sports and society. Navratilova received the Wilma Rudolph Courage Award, and she was commended for her courage in defecting from Czechoslovakia to the United States and, more recently, for her activism on behalf of gay and lesbian rights.</p>
        <p>''It's so humbling to be in this room with fantastic athletes,'' Navratilova said.</p>
        <p>Among the 70 athletes who attended the award ceremony were synchronized swimmers, snowboarders, water skiers and weight lifters. The variety reflected a newfound expression of freedom and empowerment. The Williams sisters, for example, have expanded attention to tennis among African-Americans and attracted worldwide attention with their Grand Slam victories.</p>
        <p>Thompson showed her own strength when she posed nude from the waist up in Sports Illustrated before the Olympics, getting much criticism. Brandi Chastain of the American women's soccer team, posed nude for Gear Magazine a month before her team won the World Cup last year.</p>
        <p>''I saw her in Sydney, and we had a laugh over it,'' Thompson said. ''We were like, what's the big deal? It was, if anything, a statement of strength and muscularity, showing that women are able to be free and strong.''</p>
