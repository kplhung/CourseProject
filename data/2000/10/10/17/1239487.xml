      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Nearly three years after Bre-X Minerals collapsed in one of the biggest gold-discovery frauds of all time, its chief geologist went on trial here today, in the only criminal prosecution arising from a scandal that wiped out holdings of many investors in Canada and the United States.</p>
        <p>The geologist, John B. Felderhof, who was also a vice chairman of the Canadian mining company, has been accused of breaching Canadian securities laws by allowing Bre-X to publish press releases about an enormous gold find in Indonesia that turned out to be fake.</p>
        <p>Mr. Felderhof is also accused of profiting from insider trading by selling $56 million worth of shares in the small company when their price was high, knowing at the time that the Indonesian government had raised doubts about the gold discovery that were not being made public.</p>
        <p>Even with the opening of the trial, however, it is unclear how far the proceedings will go. Mr. Felderhof's lawyer, Joseph Groia, sought to have the case dismissed, which delayed a formal reading of charges.</p>
        <p>Mr. Groia argued that the Ontario Securities Commission, the government agency that is bringing the charges, had based its accusations on a section of the province's Securities Act so vague that a conviction is possible ''even though the applicant is morally innocent.''</p>
        <p>He also argued that it is improper to charge one principal in the company without charging others or the company itself.</p>
        <p>Bre-X, which is now defunct, grew from an obscure gold-mining company into a sought-after investment, selling at $200 a share, or nearly $4 billion, at its peak before plunging to near zero as the company collapsed in November 1997 when doubts were raised about the gold discovery. Bre-X became a symbol of freewheeling mining stock frauds in Canada.</p>
        <p>If Mr. Felderhof is found guilty of the eight charges against him, he could face as much as two years in prison on each count, plus a fine as high as three times the loss he avoided by selling his shares. A resident of the Cayman Islands, Mr. Felderhof  is not expected to appear at the trial. Canada does not have an extradition treaty with the Cayman Islands.</p>
        <p>Debate on Mr. Groia's motions is expected to take at least a week. If the case continues, it is expected to last roughly until Christmas. About 50 people are scheduled to testify, including Peter Munk, chairman of the Barrick Gold Corporation, which tried to buy into Bre-X's Indonesian find in the mid-90's. Barrick officials have never disclosed what they knew about the real value of the project.</p>
        <p>Two of the leading figures in Bre-X are now dead. The company's on-site geologist, Michael de Guzman, fell from a helicopter in the Indonesian jungle in 1997, an apparent suicide. David Walsh, the company's chairman and main promoter, died of an aneurysm in the Bahamas in 1998.</p>
