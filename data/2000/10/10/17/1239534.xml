        <p>Everything in the harbor at Aden looked normal to Andrew A. Nemeth as he stood on the deck of the destroyer Cole last Thursday, chatting in the morning sun with a buddy who was helping refuel the ship.</p>
        <p>''We had our typical security, armed watches up on the quarter-deck and everything,'' he said today at the Naval Medical Center here.

        <p>Everything in the harbor at Aden looked normal to Andrew A. Nemeth as he stood on the deck of the destroyer Cole last Thursday, chatting in the morning sun with a buddy who was helping refuel the ship.</p>
        <p>''We had our typical security, armed watches up on the quarter-deck and everything,'' he said today at the Naval Medical Center here. In fact, he said, the crew members were more apprehensive about their crossing through the Suez Canal than about what had begun as a routine refueling at Aden, Yemen, before entering the Persian Gulf on patrol.</p>
        <p>Seaman Apprentice Nemeth, 19, in the Navy for 16 months and on board the Cole for 10, went to the engine room, where he worked, and took a quick tour, looking for leaks and sweeping up debris. Then he went to the chow line a little early, just before lunch began at 11:15 a.m.</p>
        <p>''I went to grab my tray and get my food, and the blast happened,'' Seaman Nemeth said. ''I didn't hear really anything. I remember just being up in the air, falling to the ground and having fuel spray all over me.</p>
        <p>''My first instinct was to look around for any of my friends I could find, which I didn't see, because it was real smoky and everything,'' he said, fingering the plastic hospital ID bracelet on his left wrist, as his parents and grandmother looked on tearfully.</p>
        <p>Seaman Nemeth wore a crisp new Navy T-shirt and blue sweat pants, given to him by the U.S.O. at a hospital in Germany; the clothes he wore at the time of the attack were seized as evidence, he said.</p>
        <p>The seaman, from Amherst, Ohio, had volunteered to speak to reporters today just after he was discharged from the hospital. He made the rounds of a conference room, over and over telling the story of the explosion that injured 39 crew members and left 17 dead or missing.</p>
        <p>Seaman Nemeth said his first thought that day was that a fuel line had exploded. He heard that the explosion was being described as a terrorist bombing only when he was in a hospital in Aden, where the doctors stitched up his right cheek.</p>
        <p>He said he had made it out of the dark, smoke-filled mess hall only because he had been trained to find his way out of the ship blindfolded. ''It came in perfect,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He groped his way to the medical area, but it had been evacuated, so he continued toward the deck and was found by another crewman. He said he did not realize he was injured until he looked down and saw blood streaming from his face, which today was still taped in an octopus pattern over a row of stitches and small cuts.</p>
        <p>When Seaman Nemeth was found, the crew was going about its job of closing doors to stop the flooding, putting out fires and looking for the injured, he said.</p>
        <p>Ship schedulers allow 10 hours for refueling, he said, but the crew expected that this one would be completed in 2 hours. Seaman Nemeth  echoed suspicions voiced by more senior Navy personnel that the attackers must have had intelligence about the layout and schedule of the Cole, an Arleigh Burke-class destroyer -- or have been incredibly lucky.</p>
        <p>''They hit us perfectly, at lunch time, right in the middle of the galley, near the chiefs' mess,'' Seaman Nemeth said in an interview with ABC News.</p>
        <p>Seaman Nemeth made a circuit of four network interviews in different corners of the hospital conference room, each set up to look like a different location, as print reporters strained to hear. The interviews appeared to drain him; when they were over, he left quickly with his family.</p>
        <p>Asked by one interviewer whether officers had warned the crew about security risks in the Middle East, he said, ''They didn't have to really tell us; we knew from experience,'' which he said had come mostly from watching television reports.</p>
        <p>The crew was accustomed to the idea that it might face combat but not that it would be ''snuck-up on,'' he said. He called the two suspected suicide bombers cowardly.</p>
        <p>''I'm just angry for the way they did it, that we had no idea,'' he said. Seaman Nemeth said he was determined to go back to his ship. That, he said, would deny victory to the attackers.</p>
        <p>Another sailor aboard the Cole, Kesha Stidham, had evidently been a few steps ahead of Seaman Nemeth in line for lunch and had just finished eating some fajitas and left the mess hall when the blast hit.</p>
        <p>In a brief telephone interview today, Seaman Stidham said that she, too, had heard nothing at the time of the explosion. Seaman Stidman, whose face was cut and bruised in the explosion, said it was lucky that it did not happen later in the lunch period, when more sailors would have been eating not far from where the bomb went off.</p>
        <p>Capt. Martin Snyder, the senior attending physician at the hospital here, said that of the six more seriously injured crew members still in Germany, four would arrive here on Tuesday, all with broken bones and one with ''pulmonary complications.''</p>
        <p>Navy officials said 20 of the 33 sailors who arrived here by Air Force transport plane on Sunday evening would be discharged by tonight. Some might go home, but many, like Seaman Nemeth, plan to  stay for a service on Wednesday at the Norfolk naval station, at which President Clinton is expected to speak in memory of the dead. The naval station is the home port of the Cole, which left on Aug. 8.</p>
        <p>In addition to the injured and their families, John and Lorina Clodfelter, of Mechanicsville, Va., also spent the day at the hospital in the section given over to the Cole crew. Their son Kenneth, a hull technician, has not been found; the Pentagon has now listed those still missing as among the dead.</p>
        <p>But the Clodfelters say they have not given up hope. They have another son, a daughter and a son-in-law in the military, and they spent today with the other families ''because it helps us to get through it,'' said Mr. Clodfelter, who works in the state unemployment office.</p>
        <p>Kenneth, 21, known as ''Cooter'' after a character on the ''Dukes of Hazzard'' television program, could still be trapped in one of the parts of the destroyer sealed off to limit flooding, Mr. Clodfelter said.</p>
        <p>''I'm not kissing my son off, just like you wouldn't kiss off one of your children,'' Mr. Clodfelter said, ''until the Navy tells me, this is his situation, his condition.''</p>
