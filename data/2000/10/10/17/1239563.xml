        <p>For the third consecutive year, the Giants will try to find a way to replace Jason Sehorn, their star cornerback, who bruised his collarbone and cracked a rib in the victory over the Dallas Cowboys on Sunday.</p>
        <p>But his medical update today was encouraging. With the help of a bye this week for the Giants, Sehorn may miss only two games.</p>
        <p>''I'm going to guess Jason will be doubtful for Philadelphia,'' Coach Jim Fassel said, referring to the Giants' next game on Oct.  29, ''and questionable for the Cleveland game after that. Then we'll have him back.''</p>
        <p>That means Sehorn may return against the St. Louis Rams at Giants Stadium on Nov. 12.</p>
        <p>''Jason will love to be back for that game,'' said Fassel, who also conceded that Sehorn could be out a month and miss three games.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Amani Toomer will be back in the lineup against the Eagles. Unhappy with Toomer's performance during Sunday's 19-14 victory against the Cowboys, Fassel benched his top receiver and replaced him with Joe Jurevicius.</p>
        <p>Today, Fassel said Toomer's demotion was temporary.</p>
        <p>''Amani had a bad game,'' Fassel said. ''He's in a slump. But he's our starting split end. I expect him to come back and get better.''</p>
        <p>After catching 16 passes in the Giants' first three games, Toomer caught 11 in the next four games, including just three in the last two games. Against the Cowboys, Toomer was repeatedly jammed at the line and made mistakes while running his pass routes, Fassel said.</p>
        <p>''But it wasn't a lack of effort,'' Fassel said. ''He played hard. There's no reason to put him on the bench.''</p>
        <p>In Sehorn's absence, the challenge before the Giants will be finding ways to remain aggressive on defense. During the 1998 season, which Sehorn missed because of a knee injury in the preseason, the defense grew passive and was soon completely out of sync.</p>
        <p>Sehorn's abilities as a cover cornerback and his instincts to make pivotal plays have made it possible for the Giants to take risks in other parts of the field, while leaving Sehorn alone to patrol his portion of the field. Blitzes and other aggressive tactics often led to pressure on the quarterback and turnovers by the opposition.</p>
        <p>When Sehorn was out of the lineup -- he also missed six games last season because of leg injuries -- the Giants struggled to maintain their attacking defensive style. Pressure on the quarterback diminished and turnovers were down.</p>
        <p>This season, the Giants are in a little better position since Sehorn's replacement, Emmanuel McDaniel, is in his second year with the team and has been playing regularly as the nickel cornerback. McDaniel is studious and confident and well liked by his teammates in the secondary, all of which should help make the transition smoother.</p>
        <p>Still, at 5 feet 9 and 180 pounds, McDaniel is 5 inches shorter and 40 pounds lighter than Sehorn. McDaniel also has 46 fewer National Football League starts. Last month, the Tennessee Titans targeted McDaniel in the nickel defense -- a strategy that was so successful, he was benched as the nickel cornerback.</p>
        <p>Sehorn came into Sunday's game as the team's leading tackler and had broken up 11 passes, more than twice as many as any other Giants defender. Sehorn was injured making his second interception of the season on the game's first play.</p>
        <p>''It's frustrating,'' Fassel said of Sehorn's injury. ''He just got back in the groove and we need him. But you can't drive yourself crazy over these things. They're going to happen.''</p>
        <p>Fassel suggested that Sehorn might begin practicing in two weeks.</p>
        <p>''He's going to be sore and it'll probably take him a few weeks,'' Fassel said. ''But he might be able to run in practice and avoid contact and stay in football shape that way.''</p>
        <p>As for Toomer, Fassel seemed eager to play down the demotion, saying that Toomer, who has been hobbled by a toe sprain and a hamstring pull, had missed practice time that contributed to his problems. ''Not being right in practice, I believe, hurt him,'' Fassel said. ''It's our job to get the best from him from here.''</p>
        <p>As the Giants' most gifted all-around receiver, Toomer is a talent Fassel said he does not want to give up on, especially after two consecutive seasons of progress.  PRO FOOTBALL</p>
