        <p>The surrounding jungle is slowly engulfing the tiny capital of this former Portuguese colony. More than a year after a devastating war, little has been rebuilt. The new president, elected in January, doesn't even have his own office, and his presidential palace, like many government buildings, is a burned-out shell. The broken streets are mostly empty by day.</p>
        <p>But nights are a different matter. At least eight big discotheques with high-tech lighting and sound systems lie hidden in the rubble. Bissau rarely has electricity because its power grid is severely damaged, but the clubs all have private generators. So thousands of impoverished city dwellers emerge from the darkness to dance the night away.</p>
        <p>On dance floors men and women show off their passada, a steamy Portuguese-African dance in which pelvises meet and gyrate. The clubgoers are of all ages and classes. Members of the government fraternize with peasants.</p>
        <p>Officially it costs as much as $7 to go dancing in a country where per capita income is $230 a year. But in reality anyone can get into a disco, says the doorman in front of a big, half-destroyed colonial building that  houses a fancy, multilevel club called Galaxia. ''If you don't have money, you get a discount,'' he said. Marijuana is readily available, and prostitution is rife, but most people have clearly come to dance. ''Here we feel transformed,'' said Orlando Mendoca, 20, as colored lights flashed in his face. A woman pulled him onto the dance floor as the D.J. put on a local hit called ''Don't Judge Me by My Size.'' The singer, Dembo Djassi, is a dwarf who says that everyone used to insult him, even his mother. But now he is a star.</p>
        <p>These discotheques wouldn't exist if it weren't for the popularity of the local music, gumbe, as it is called, which is based on a traditional rhythm. In villages across the country, the women mostly dance it while the men tap the beat on a half of a giant gourd that floats upside down in a basin of water. The drum makes a gurgling sound somewhat like the word gumbe.</p>
        <p>While each of Guinea-Bissau's ethnic groups has its own rhythm, gumbe is the only one traditionally played by all. Like the Portuguese Creole language in which it is sung, the music is seen as a uniting force in a fractured country.</p>
        <p>As with the indigenous music of many African countries, pop versions emerged only in the 1980's, and in gumbe, the transformation meant not only adding electric instruments and a modern pop structure but also a political edge.</p>
        <p>Local gumbe stars like Justino Delgado, Rui Sangara and Tino Trimo all take inspiration from Amilcar Cabral, the intellectual leader of Guinea-Bissau's war for independence from Portugal in the 1960's and 70's, and see themselves as following in the footsteps of Cabral's friend, Jose Carlos Schwarz, whose music sounds like the Portuguese folk-singing known as fado with a Joan Baez sensibility. His lyrics are scathing political commentaries that landed him in trouble with the Portuguese colonial authorities and then, after independence in 1973, with the country's first government. He died in 1977.</p>
        <p>The modern gumbe artists who  emerged in the 1980's and 90's were all harsh critics of the dictator, President Joao Bernardo Vieira. He jailed Mr. Delgado, the most outspoken of them.</p>
        <p>President Vieira was ousted in May 1999, though only after the army uprising against him turned into a war, with the French-speaking neighbors, Senegal and the Republic of Guinea, sending thousands of troops to support him. The invasion, which many people in Guinea-Bissau believe was orchestrated by France, reawakened nationalist sentiments that had been dormant since independence.</p>
        <p>Discotheques remained open throughout the 11-month ordeal, with people braving rocket-propelled grenades and machine-gun fire to get to them.</p>
        <p>Before the war the modern French cultural center in Bissau was the country's main hall for local and visiting French performers, but the day the war ended, victorious junta forces destroyed it.</p>
        <p>Now discotheques are the only cultural institutions left standing. Many concerts take place a block away from the French ruins at the discotheque Capital. One clubgoer recalled having to sit quietly at Capital as if he were listening to Mozart. ''That's not the way we show our appreciation for music here,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The discotheques are loud and chaotic. Business is booming, said Bacai Sanha, the owner of the Cafe D'Rome, who is also an economist and the son of the former interim president, also named Bacai Sanha. ''They're the only thing worth investing in here,'' he said. Guinea-Bissau has no industry and produces few export crops besides cashews, and even that has slowed with the new government's attempts to tax cashew traders.</p>
        <p>''Economically and politically, we don't know how to move forward,'' Mr. Delgado said in an interview. ''With our music many things seem possible.''</p>
        <p>Gumbe takes many forms. To an ear used to identifying music by melody rather than rhythm, it often sounds like other African, Caribbean or Latin dance music. Some gumbe musicians borrow heavily from Congolese soukous or French Antillean zouk, and some use elements of rap, reggae and salsa.</p>
        <p>Even gumbe's rhythm came from abroad, said Ousmane Hurchard Sow, a Senegalese musicologist specializing in the music of West Africa. ''It's like the old rumba found in music from Cuba to Congo,'' he said. Yet the gumbe rhythm is distinctive, and a Guinea-Bissau sound shines through. People here identify with it as if it were part of their genetic coding. Intellectuals say it fits the ideal postcolonial culture.</p>
        <p>Guinea-Bissau lacks a professional sound studio, so the music is all recorded in Portugal or France. Local sales of imported gumbe CD's and cassettes have been growing, said Alfredino Tavares, who owns the main music store in the country.</p>
        <p>But he doesn't see that as a sign of an economic upswing. ''All people care about here is food on their table and music to dance to, and not necessarily in that order,'' he said.</p>
