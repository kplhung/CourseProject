        <p>Manual Andrade, candidate of Institutional Revolutionary Party, and Raul Ojeda of opposition Democratic Revolutionary Party both claim victory in gubernatorial elections in Mexico's Tabasco state, even though results show Andrade winning razor-thin victory; Andrade won 44.23 percent of vote, compared with 43.22 for Ojeda (S)</p>

        <p>The gulf state of Tabasco, ravaged in recent weeks by torrential rains, seemed poised for another type of storm today as results from state gubernatorial elections on Sunday indicated that the long-governing Institutional Revolutionary Party won a razor-thin victory over a left-leaning opposition party.</p>

        <p>The gulf state of Tabasco, ravaged in recent weeks by torrential rains, seemed poised for another type of storm today as results from state gubernatorial elections on Sunday indicated that the long-governing Institutional Revolutionary Party won a razor-thin victory over a left-leaning opposition party.</p>
        <p>At the end of a preliminary ballot count tonight, Manuel Andrade of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI, had won 44.23 percent of the vote, while Raul Ojeda of the Democratic Revolutionary Party had 43.22 percent -- a margin of 7,998 votes. Still, both men were proclaiming victory. And neither said he would accept defeat.</p>
        <p>The national president of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, Dulce Maria Sauri, strenuously pressed the party's opponents to accept their defeat in the same way that her party had peacefully accepted losing the presidency last July and the August gubernatorial elections in Chiapas state. Those losses were devastating to the party, which had controlled both the national presidency and politics in Chiapas for 71 years.</p>
        <p>The former governing party, and in particular the outgoing governor of Tabasco, had hoped to win a convincing comeback victory to restore some level of political clout and to reunify its fractured bases of support. The governor, Roberto Madrazo Pintado, had hoped that a victory in his home state would clinch the support he needs to become the party's next national president.</p>
        <p>Leaders of the Democratic Revolutionary Party, however, were jubilant at the possibility of snuffing out Mr. Madrazo's aspirations and of delivering a potentially fatal blow to the former governing party. Although he portrays himself as a reformer, Mr. Madrazo is widely viewed as a machine-style politician who regularly, and sometimes ruthlessly, plays outside the rules.</p>
        <p>''Madrazo may have put on a new face, but he is the same,'' said Mr. Ojeda, the Democratic Revolutionary Party's candidate for governor. ''And what he wanted to do was use Tabasco to relaunch the old PRI, with all its old, corrupt traditions.</p>
        <p>''With their votes,'' he added, ''society has said, 'No More!' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Andrade, the candidate for the governing party, dismissed accusations of fraud as little more than malicious rantings by poor losers. ''They have not produced one piece of evidence.'' he said in an interview.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, the final and official count of the votes will be tallied by computer. Mr. Andrade said he expects to see his slim victory ratified. Mr. Ojeda said he would not accept a triumph by the opposition.</p>
        <p>Leaders of his party called on members for widespread displays of civil disobedience. But Mr. Ojeda, 48, a hotel operator, said he would not support any violence.</p>
