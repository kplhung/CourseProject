        <p>Slobodan Milosevic, the former Yugoslav president, placed more than $100 million in foreign accounts and was involved in drug trafficking, Germany's foreign intelligence agency has charged in a secret report.</p>
        <p>''Numerous hints let us recognize Milosevic and his entourage as an organized crime structure, engaged in drug trade, money laundering and other crimes,'' the Bild newspaper quoted the report as saying.</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman for the intelligence agency broadly confirmed the newspaper's account. ''Such a fortune cannot have been amassed by legal means,'' Lydia Rauscher, the spokeswoman for the Federal Intelligence Service, said today. The report, prepared for the German government, says that Mr. Milosevic has sent $100 million to Switzerland alone, she said.</p>
        <p>The intelligence report says that Mr. Milosevic also controls accounts in other nations. Earlier this month the Swiss government said it froze 100 bank accounts linked to him and his associates.</p>
        <p>The intelligence service believes that he and his son Marko funneled a ''three-digit million amount'' abroad, Ms. Rauscher said.</p>
