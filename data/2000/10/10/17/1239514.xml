        <p>The main stock market gauges were narrowly mixed yesterday as worries about third-quarter earnings continued to trouble investors.</p>
        <p>In large part, the focus on earnings was concentrated on Intel and Microsoft. Both stocks fell on worries that their profits would come up short of expectations. Microsoft fell to a two-year low.</p>
        <p>The declines in those two stocks prevented the Nasdaq composite index from continuing the 7.9 percent rally it posted on Friday. It fell 26.49 points, or 0.8 percent, to 3,290.28. Big gains in stocks like Qualcomm, Juniper Networks and Ciena partly offset the slide in Intel and Microsoft.</p>
        <p>Even though Intel and Microsoft are also components of the Dow Jones industrial average, the blue-chip index managed to eke out a gain. The Dow rose 46.62 points, or 0.5 percent, to 10,238.80. And the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index edged up 0.45 point, or 0.03 percent, to 1,374.62.</p>
        <p>Positive comments from a Merrill Lynch analyst about the earnings outlook at I.B.M. lifted the company's shares $2, to $111.13.</p>
        <p>United Technologies, Wal-Mart Stores and Hewlett-Packard -- also Dow components -- each registered gains of more than $2.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, warnings from an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney about Intel sent its shares down $4.69, to $35.69. And Microsoft closed at $50.38, down $3.38. Intel is expected to report its third-quarter results today, and Microsoft is expected to report tomorrow.</p>
        <p>Analysts and traders said they were not surprised that the market had a difficult time after Friday's big jump.</p>
        <p>''I fail to see how anyone came to the conclusion that Friday was anything more than a short-covering rally and a near-term bounce,'' said William Meehan, chief market analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald. ''It appears to me that institutions are pawning off unwanted merchandise to individuals willing to take it.''</p>
        <p>Ned Collins, head stock trader at Daiwa Securities America, said that Friday's rally ''was a happy surprise, but it wasn't convincing.''</p>
        <p>''I don't think we are out of the woods yet,'' he added. ''Get us out of October and maybe we can have a year-end rally.''</p>
        <p>There was some evidence that the market's six-week swoon is having an effect on investors. Data compiled by TrimTabs.com Investment Research, based in Santa Rosa, Calif., showed that investors pulled $12.2 billion out of equity mutual funds in the week ended Oct. 12. It was the biggest net weekly outflow since the research firm began tracking the numbers in 1996.</p>
        <p>Qualcomm was a big winner yesterday.</p>
        <p>The stock jumped $7.06, to $77, after the company announced that it had teamed up with China's second-largest phone company and an equipment maker to produce a cellular phone based on Qualcomm's wireless standard.</p>
        <p>Biotechnology stocks also did well. Human Genome Sciences rose $8.56, to $90.06, after the company said its most advanced drug, the wound-healing product Repifermin, would be co-developed by SmithKline Beecham. Genentech gained $12.13, to $146.75. And Millennium Pharmaceuticals closed at $70.50, up $4.31.</p>
        <p>Texaco gained after Chevron said it had agreed to buy the company for $36 billion in stock. Texaco rose to $59, up $3.88. Chevron fell $2.25, to $82.</p>
        <p>Thomas M. O'Neill, managing partner at Navigator Asset Management, a private Boston-based hedge fund, said energy stocks were attractive investments at the moment.</p>
        <p>''There will be a relative shortage of oil and natural gas,'' he said. ''We are also finding attractive names in the financial, health care and retail sectors. I believe we have begun a glacial shift out of a technology-driven market.''</p>

        <p>Treasury Prices Fall</p>
        <p>By Bloomberg News</p>
        <p>Bond prices fell yesterday as Middle East leaders began talks in Egypt to ease tension in the region, dimming the need for the relative safety of United States government debt.</p>
        <p>The price of the 10-year Treasury note fell 3/32, to 100 4/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.73 percent from 5.72 percent on Friday.</p>
        <p>The 30-year bond fell 2/32, to 106 7/32. Its yield was unchanged at 5.81 percent.</p>
