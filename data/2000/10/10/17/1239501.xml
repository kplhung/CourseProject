        <p>Slobodan Milosevic's party ceded its last bastion of power today, by agreeing to share duties in a transitional government of Serbia leading to new elections.</p>
        <p>The deal was reached in the week of negotiations held since a beleaguered Mr. Milosevic conceded the presidency of Yugoslavia to Vojislav Kostunica of the Democratic Opposition of Serbia.</p>
        <p>Elections for the Serbian Parliament, which had been scheduled for next fall, will now take place on Dec. 23, and the last duties of the Parliament now in office will be to approve the transitional government, which will be made up of members from Mr. Milosevic's Socialist Party of Serbia, the Democratic Opposition of Serbia and a third party, the Serbian Renewal Movement, led by Vuk Draskovic.</p>
        <p>Today's developments confirm the collapse of Mr. Milosevic's authority. The Serbian Parliament and government, always dominated by his allies, are where the real power lies in the republic.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kostunica has been confirmed as president of the federal republic comprised of Serbia and its smaller sister-state Montenegro, but he has had no legal jurisdiction over the Serbian government or ministries, and so had no official control of the police, the courts or the news media, all tools of Mr. Milosevic's rule.</p>
        <p>But as members of Mr. Kostunica's party threatened to call supporters back onto the streets, the Socialists agreed to share power. Senior representatives of his party negotiated and signed the deal, but Mr. Milosevic himself, who remains president of the party, was absent from the whole process.</p>
        <p>Zoran Andjelkovic, the new general secretary of the Serbian Socialist Party and formerly head of the party in Kosovo, said his party had agreed to share power with the other two parties to stop the illegal seizure of government institutions and companies, which have been largely managed by the Socialists and their allies. The agreement was also a recognition of Mr. Kostunica's victory in the Sept. 24 federal elections, he said.</p>
        <p>''Peace, security and stability, safety of people and property are the highest priority,'' Mr. Andjelkovic said after signing the agreement. ''That's why we agreed to form a new joint government.''</p>
        <p>The job of the transitional government will be to lead the country in the 10 weeks until elections and prepare conditions for a fair vote, something that was markedly lacking in the federal elections.</p>
        <p>The document guarantees ''free activity of all political parties and full protection of public and private property,'' and a commitment to ''jointly creating conditions for democratic elections in an atmosphere of tolerance and respect.''</p>
        <p>It also orders the establishment of a steering committee to run the state-owned Radio and Television Serbia. The broadcast media was notoriously pro-Milosevic for years, refusing access to opposition parties and denouncing their leaders until protesters overran its headquarters in Belgrade and burned part of it during an Oct. 5 rally.</p>
        <p>Mr. Andjelkovic, not noted for his fairness during his years in Kosovo, promised cooperation.</p>
        <p>''Our goal is to enable citizens to make their decision in the early elections,'' he said. ''We are sure that they will vote on Dec. 23 for a better future, for peace, tolerance and cooperation.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Draskovic said the agreement meant that the various unsolved killings that occurred during Mr. Milosevic's last years in power, including that of his own brother-in-law and bodyguards last year, could soon be solved.</p>
        <p>''It is an important document,'' he said. ''We'll have to see how it will be implemented.''</p>
        <p>Zoran Djindjic, who led the negotiations on behalf of the Democrats, described the deal as a compromise. ''SPS made a concession, agreeing to call early elections, and DOS made a concession by agreeing to enter into this transitional government,'' he said. ''But the first priority of this government is not how to divide up the ministries but to supply the basic living means to people before the winter.''</p>
        <p>Earlier efforts to get Mr. Draskovic to join with the Radical Party of Serbia to dissolve the Parliament had failed, and the Democrats were forced to negotiate with their former foes the Socialists, even as Mr. Milosevic declared that he would continue to lead his party in opposition.</p>
        <p>Yet Mr. Milosevic's influence on the party seems to have slipped quickly. He will remain president of the party until the Socialist congress on Nov. 25, party officials have said, but calls for his resignation within the party are growing and his portrait was even removed temporarily from the party's Website last week.</p>
        <p>Some of his top representatives took part in the negotiations, including close ally Gorica Gajevic, who recently resigned from the post of general secretary of the party, and Nikola Sainovic, who formerly was federal vice president and has been indicted as a war criminal.</p>
        <p>But the Serbian president, Milan Milutinovic, now vice president of the party and also indicted by the United Nations war crimes tribunal in The Hague, is seen as the key figure in the party and appears ready to cooperate with the Democrats. The agreement did not mention new elections for the Serbian president and it seems he may be allowed to serve out his term until 2002.</p>
        <p>The main loser from the agreement is Vojislav Seselj, the leader of the Radical Party of Serbia, which until now was part of the ruling coalition, but will play no part in the transitional government. Mr. Seselj said on state television this weekend that he refused to take part in the transitional government since it was legalizing ''revolution and theft.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Seselj has opposed calling early elections, saying that the Democrats would unfairly win a landslide riding the current wave of enthusiasm for Mr. Kostunica. Judging from his party's poor showing in the federal elections, Mr. Seselj is likely to fare badly in Serbian elections, too.</p>
        <p>No ministers have yet been appointed, but the three parties will together run the prime minister's office and the four key ministries of interior affairs, finance, information and justice. Decisions in those ministries will be made by a board and by consensus.</p>
        <p>The agreement was signed by Mr. Kostunica, Mr. Milutinovic and representatives of all three parties.</p>
        <p>The Sse name ocialists will keep the office of prime minister for one of their members, but all decisions will have to be made by consensus with two vice-premiers, one each from the Democratic Opposition of Serbia and the Serbian Renewal Movement. Ministers are expected to be selected in the next few days, Mr. Andjelkovic said.</p>
        <p>The chief of staff of the Yugoslav Army, Gen. Nebojsa Pavkovic, long an ally of Mr. Milosevic, again expressed his support for Mr. Kostunica to journalists today. He said, however, that he was concerned that part of the Interior Ministry forces and secret service units were not under the control of the authorities.</p>
