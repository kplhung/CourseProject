        <p>EUROPE -- BELARUS: VOTER TURNOUT IN DOUBT -- Belarus officials said turnout in parliamentary elections on Sunday had approached 61 percent, well over the 50 percent needed to certify the balloting as valid, but democratic opponents countered that 28 of the 110 seats at stake still had not drawn the legal minimum number of voters. At 49 percent, turnout in Minsk, the capital, was especially low. Districts that did not elect legislators must try again in three months.</p>

        <p>SPAIN: KILLING LAID TO E.T.A. -- A man whom the police described as a longtime member of the Basque armed separatist group E.T.A. was captured after he and an accomplice reportedly shot to death a Spanish Air Force doctor in the southern city of Seville. The other suspect escaped. The doctor, Lt. Col. Antonio Munoz Carinanos, who was shot twice in the head, is the 15th person killed by E.T.A. this year.</p>

        <p>FRANCE: MUSLIMS BLAMED IN ATTACKS -- The head of a union of French Jewish groups accused French Muslims from North Africa of attacking Jewish sites since the start of Mideast violence last month. Two overnight attacks in Toulon brought to about 90 the number of incidents since clashes began. ''We believe this wave of attacks comes from North Africans or some elements in the North African community in France who want to pit Muslims against Jews in this country,'' said the leader, Henri Hajdenberg, adding that he did not hold the extreme right accountable, ''though they may take pleasure in what is happening.''</p>

        <p>POLAND: WALESA TO QUIT, SORT OF -- Former President Lech Walesa announced that he was quitting as chairman of his tiny Christian Democratic Party but vowed to stay active in politics. Mr. Walesa was humiliated when he received only 1 percent of the vote in presidential elections on Oct. 8. ''I'm pulling out from the place I occupied, from the office of chairman of Christian Democracy, and I'm looking for another place for myself where I could do more,'' he said.</p>

        <p>UGANDA: EBOLA TOLL CLIMBS -- Deaths from an Ebola virus outbreak rose to 35, with 38 more people infected and officials trying to keep the virus from spreading, the Health Ministry said. Prof. Francis Omswa, chief of medical services, said that the outbreak was largely restricted to parts of Gulu, a town 225 miles north of Kampala, but that two cases had been reported in neighboring Kigum district.</p>

        <p>SAUDI ARABIA, IRAQ: EXTRADITION REQUEST Saudi Arabia asked Iraq to extradite two Saudi officers who hijacked a flight to Baghdad on Saturday. In a statement, the cabinet said it was pleased with the return to Riyadh of the plane, ''and asked Iraq to hand over the hijackers under Arab and international treaties stipulating for hijackers and those practicing terrorism to be handed to their countries.''</p>

        <p>BAHAMAS: TOLL IN HAITI BOAT WRECK -- Divers recovered the bodies of five Haitian migrants from a sailboat that sank a week ago in a collision with a Bahamian mail boat, and officials said 23 still unaccounted for were feared drowned. The mail boat crew rescued 87 Haitians as the sailboat sank but did not know how many were still missing. Investigators have since put the total originally on board at 115.</p>

        <p>COLOMBIA: MILITARY FIRES 388 -- In a move that coincides with a peace conference for guerrillas and rights groups, the government announced the dismissal of 388 officers and soldiers accused of misconduct. The purge affects 89 officers and 299 soldiers, which makes it the largest since President Andres Pastrana took office two years ago. Officials denied that it was a result of American concerns about rights abuses by the military, calling the decision an ''autonomous'' one meant to improve ''transparency.''</p>

        <p>VENEZUELA, COLOMBIA: BORDER DISPUTE -- The Colombian military accused Venezuela of violating the countries' haphazardly marked common border by sending anti-drug troops into Colombian territory. The Venezuelan Foreign Ministry said the complaint was false, but residents of Tibu said Venezuelan military aircraft, including helicopters, fired rockets at two houses over the weekend and landed about 30 soldiers, who destroyed coca fields.</p>

        <p>CANADA: GARBAGE ODYSSEY -- Toronto is to ship its garbage by rail 400 miles north to an abandoned mine. With the city's landfill nearly full, authorities made the decision despite protests from rural people and Indians who live near the site.</p>

        <p>CANADA: 'NO' TO MOUNT TRUDEAU? -- Callers to radio talk shows, editorial writers and some Liberal legislators from western Canada are assailing Prime Minister Jean Chretien's decision to rename Canada's tallest mountain, Mount Logan, after Pierre Trudeau. Shortly after Mr. Trudeau's funeral this month, Mr. Chretien made the change without consulting a federal names board or Yukon Indian and territorial leaders. With a Globe and Mail poll showing 64 percent opposed to the change, Randy McCauley, the prime minister's press secretary, said, ''The decision stands.''</p>

        <p>AFGHANISTAN: TALIBAN VS. REBELS -- The Taliban militia and the Afghan opposition made conflicting claims as fighting raged for the third day in Takhar, a northeastern province close to the border with Tajikistan. The Taliban minister of information claimed full government control of key areas in Takhar and nearby Kunduz Province. But an opposition spokesman disputed the claim, asserting rebel dominance in some zones.</p>
