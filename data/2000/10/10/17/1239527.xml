        <p>It is possible, even easy, to push a 110-pound body from an airplane while flying the plane at the same time, Manhattan prosecutors want a jury to know.</p>
        <p>So yesterday, to prove this point, they showed a grainy homemade videotape featuring a New York City police officer shoving duffel bags stuffed with sand and rice from a Cessna 172 into the Atlantic Ocean. The officer did so unassisted, three times in a row.</p>
        <p>The tape, played in the darkened courtroom of Justice Leslie Crocker Snyder, was intended to show how, prosecutors contend, Dr. Robert Bierenbaum disposed of his wife's body in 1985.</p>
        <p>He is on trial in her murder in State Supreme Court in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>The authorities arrested Dr. Bierenbaum, a successful plastic surgeon, last year after unearthing flight logs showing that on the day his wife, Gail Katz-Bierenbaum, disappeared, Dr. Bierenbaum, a licensed pilot, flew an airplane over the Atlantic for two hours.</p>
        <p>The video, starring two 50-pound bags of sand and one 10-pound bag of long-grain rice on each flight, spoke volumes about the difficulty of prosecuting a murder case with no body, forensic evidence or eyewitnesses, as is the case in the Bierenbaum trial.</p>
        <p>The props, loaded into a brown nylon duffel bag and then into the passenger seat of the fixed-wing plane, must stand in for Dr. Bierenbaum's petite former wife, whose body has never been found.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors have asserted that Dr. Bierenbaum strangled his wife in July 1985, loaded her body into a duffel bag and drove to the Essex County Airport in Caldwell, N.J., where he kept his Cessna.</p>
        <p>Then he flew over the Atlantic and dumped her body, they charge.</p>
        <p>The video, shown to the jury after unsuccessful efforts by defense lawyers to have it excluded, made the maneuver look easy. Sgt. Matthew Rowley, a member of the Police Department's aviation unit, performed the re-enactment this month. It was videotaped by a helicopter.</p>
        <p>The video opened with a close-up shot of of the dead weight: two bags of Play Sand, with a label that said ''easy to carry,'' and a 10-pound bag of long-grain rice.</p>
        <p>Standing out on the tarmac in a sweater and jeans, Sergeant Rowley loaded the weights into the duffel bag and heaved the bag into the airplane. In response to questions from an assistant district attorney, Adam Kaufman, he narrated the video.</p>
        <p>In the next scene, Sergeant Rowley is shown cruising over the Atlantic at an altitude of 1,300 feet, traveling at approximately 85 miles an hour, fast enough not to stall, but slow enough to open the door of the airplane.</p>
        <p>With relative ease, he unlocks the passenger door with his right hand and nudges the duffel bag against it. The bag is then shown hurtling from the plane into the ocean. Sergeant Rowley then opens the window to relieve air pressure as he closes and locks the door.</p>
        <p>Sergeant Rowley repeats the maneuver on a second flight and then, on a third trip, adds a degree of difficulty, pulling the duffel bag from the passenger seat onto his lap and easing it out the door on the pilot's side. For a moment, the bag rests between the open door and the side of the plane before it plummets into the sea.</p>
        <p>When the lights came back on in the courtroom, Dr. Bierenbaum's lawyer, David Lewis, briefly cross-examined Sergeant Rowley, asking whether he had made the video in October and dropped the bag into an open sea.</p>
        <p>The answer was yes. Mr. Lewis then pointed out that many more boats take to the crowded waters in July, and presumably someone might have seen a duffel bag falling from the sky.</p>
