        <p>In a golf clubhouse far from the violence still convulsing their homelands, the Israelis and the Palestinians did not succeed by early this morning in hammering out a truce despite assistance from several world leaders including President Clinton.</p>
        <p>But even while exuding pessimism, they persisted in their negotiations through the wee hours, until adjourning for a few hours. At nearly 4 a.m., P. J. Crowley, an American spokesman, said President Clinton had just finished a meeting of nearly two hours with the Israeli Prime Minister, Ehud Barak, and expected to hold new meetings after resting. Mr. Crowley declined to assess how the talks were going.</p>
        <p>The 16 hours of sessions, rancorous and volatile, have proved a grim reminder of how far their peacemaking relationship has deteriorated and how much is at stake.</p>
        <p>The fact that the talks did not break down, however, suggested the possibility that some kind of agreement could be found later today.</p>
        <p>Not long after stepping off Air Force One on Monday morning, Mr. Clinton walked somberly into the JolieVille Golf Resort. In a brief statement, he expressed the urgency felt by most participants about an emergency intervention that aspires to prevent the conflict from escalating further and engulfing the region.</p>
        <p>''We cannot afford to fail,'' Mr. Clinton said. ''The future of the peace process and the stability of the region are at stake.'' Mr. Clinton is working under urgent time pressures, not only because of the stakes but because he plans to attend a memorial in Virginia on Wednesday for the 17 American sailors killed in Yemen.</p>
        <p>Despite his strong words, peace was not even on the agenda here, just violence -- tank pullbacks, weapons collections and how to best assemble a fact-finding mechanism to assess blame.</p>
        <p>The death and disillusionment of the last 19 days sat before the leaders like centerpieces on the horseshoe-shaped negotiating table.</p>
        <p>In a full-court diplomatic press, Mr. Clinton was joined in mediation by President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, King Abdullah of Jordan, Secretary General Kofi Annan of the United Nations and Javier Solana, of the European Union.</p>
        <p>At times, participants said, the negotiations seemed to pit the Egyptians and the Palestinians against the Israelis and the Americans. At others, the Palestinians said, it felt as if everyone was pressing them.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mubarak, who acted as host to the meeting, put himself squarely behind the Palestinians in his opening remarks. Such an embrace is essential if he is to wield any influence over Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader.</p>
        <p>''The aggressions to which the Palestinian people were subjected during the last two weeks persuaded me to convene this meeting,'' Mr. Mubarak said. But he also referred to those trying to torpedo the peace effort as ''extremists.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Arafat came here reluctantly, just as he went reluctantly in July to the Camp David meeting that failed to produce a permanent peace accord. This time, Prime Minister Barak, who was eager for Camp David, was also hesitant.</p>
        <p>The shaky trust between the two sides, established over seven years of negotiations and security cooperation, turned out to be fragile enough to disintegrate in just two and a half weeks. Both sides, despite their networks of specialists in Israeli-Palestinian dialogue, doubted that talking to each other was worthwhile.</p>
        <p>''Even if we came out of here with a cease-fire agreement, it would take a week or two to see if it was worth the paper that it was written on,'' said Avi Posner, a former Israeli diplomat and now a government spokesman.</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Clinton and Mr. Mubarak were not inclined to let the leaders go home if a glimmer of hope remained. Too much was riding on the outcome. For the American president, it would represent a brutal collapse of two terms of peacemaking efforts if such a high-level emergency mediation failed, especially if it were to spawn a fresh wave of violence.</p>
        <p>For the Egyptian president, it would be a stinging defeat, and it would create a risk that his own pan-Arab summit meeting, which is scheduled for week's end, would be overtaken by a revival of anti-Israeli, anti-peace sentiments.</p>
        <p>Late Monday, Mr. Barak left the golf club for a break, and Mr. Arafat sat surrounded by all the foreign mediators on the building's back patio. Then the Palestinian leader, with Mr. Mubarak at his side, proceeded into talks with Mr. Clinton.</p>
        <p>After they left, it was Mr. Barak's turn with the American president.</p>
        <p>Monday was tense, all participants agreed. Mr. Barak and Mr. Arafat had little direct contact, except during what Mr. Crowley called a leaders' ''huddle'' midday. Before lunch, the leaders gathered by the picture window overlooking the golf course. At the lunch, the Israeli and Palestinian leaders did not talk to each other, participants said, but they were politely chilly, at least formally.</p>
        <p>''They didn't kiss each other, but they shook hands,'' Mr. Solana of the European Union said.</p>
        <p>Their foreign ministers, joined by Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and Foreign Minister Amr Moussa of Egypt, engaged in a verbal sparring session that was anything but a diplomatic exercise. The Israelis likened it to ''Popolitika,'' a fiery television debate program that makes the American version, ''Crossfire'' on CNN, seem like a proper tea party.</p>
        <p>An Israeli official said Shlomo Ben Ami, Israel's acting foreign minister, had denounced the Palestinians' demand for an international inquiry in the violence as a roadblock on the path to a cease-fire agreement. The official said Saeb Erekat, a senior Palestinian negotiator, sputtered in outrage and called Mr. Ben Ami, a longtime peace advocate, ''a dove who threatens with guns.'' Mr. Ben Ami then reportedly told Mr. Erekat to stop performing for the CNN cameras, which were not with them behind closed doors.</p>
        <p>During the foreign ministers' meeting, which was joined by other ministers on both sides, the Palestinians demanded that Israel be held accountable for the eruption of the violence. Specifically, they wanted it pinned to a visit by Ariel Sharon, the rightist opposition leader, to the mosque plaza atop a contested holy site in the Old City of Jerusalem. But the Israelis maintain that the Palestinians used the visit as a pretext to justify the riots that followed.</p>
        <p>''Until now, there has been no progress, and the atmosphere is not improving,'' Yasir Abed Rabbo, the Palestinian information minister, said on Monday night.</p>
        <p>On Monday afternoon, the foreign ministers were supposed to draft an agreement outlining the rules of disengagement. On almost every issue, each side wants the other to go first. The Israelis will not pull back their military equipment from the edges of Palestinian-ruled territories until the Palestinians stop the street violence, they say; the Palestinians will not disarm the paramilitary brigades until the Israelis take away the settlers' army-issued weapons.</p>
        <p>In fact, the two sides do not even agree on what they are supposed to be discussing. The Israelis are demanding that the Palestinians rearrest Islamic fundamentalist members who were released from prison last week. Israeli spokesmen released to journalists a three-page list of ''prominent terrorists'' freed, including their pictures and offenses.</p>
        <p>The Israeli government also insists that the Palestinians agree to clamp down on incitement against Jews and Israel in their official media. Mr. Arafat, however, said those issues did not belong to the discussion. He maintained that only the terms of disengagement for the violence itself should be negotiated.</p>
        <p>In Ramallah on Monday, the Palestinian government television implied throughout the day that the talks were heading to failure, and that the people should prepare for the consequences.</p>
        <p>Israeli officials, who are denouncing Mr. Arafat in unison as an unfit partner for peace, said he appeared to be disengaged from the arguments raging around him.</p>
        <p>The Palestinian government's television station broadcast the day's protest marches against Mr. Arafat's participation in the summit meeting, including the protest organized by Mr. Arafat's own political organization, Fatah. This carefully created an impression that Mr. Arafat faces intense pressure on the street to stand firm in the face of international pressures.</p>
        <p>At Camp David, the contrast in environments was between the hot, dusty conflicted region and the verdant, expansive and optimistic United States. But this time, the contrast was not only between a war zone and a place of peace but between a war zone and a resort town -- and a resort town in Sinai, which Israel occupied for 12 years and returned to Egypt as the two nations made peace.</p>
        <p>It was strange, some participants said, to debate lynch mobs and helicopter gunship attacks beside a golf course near a pristine beach where Italian tourists were engaged in Slimnastics. It distracted them, they said, from the disconcerting fact that professional peace negotiators were no longer talking about peace.</p>
