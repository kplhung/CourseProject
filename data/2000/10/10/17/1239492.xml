        <p>Op-Ed article by Fouad Ajami, professor of Middle Eastern studies at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, in light of attack on USS Cole; says that although US controls sea lanes of world, what lies ashore is an altogether different matter; says American understanding of Arab-Muslim world is woefully inadequate, and US eagerness to 'engage' and its occasional displays of power will not suffice; says 'friendships' and alliances US has built and paid for in Middle East cannot be counted on when it truly matters (M)</p>

        <p>The recent history of United States engagements in the Arab-Muslim lands is best told through the names of American battleships and destroyers. That history of sorrow and heartbreak telescopes easily. A generation ago, in 1984, it was the battleship New Jersey, off the coast of Lebanon, with its 16-inch guns shelling the hills, covering up a policy of bluster and failure. America had wandered unaware into another people's wars, and was drawn into feuds it never understood. Today it is the destroyer Cole in the waters of Aden, Yemen, attacked and crippled by two men in a small motorized boat.</p>
        <p>We control the sea lanes of the world; what lies ashore is an altogether different matter. A nemesis lay in wait for the men and women of the Cole as it docked for a refueling stop. Witnesses say that the men aboard the dinghy were standing erect at the moment of the blast, as if in some kind of salute. The terrorism ''experts'' will try to decipher the groups to which those men belonged; our officials will pledge that they will search for and punish the masterminds of this brutal, senseless deed. But if the past is any guide, the identities of these men in the small boat will remain in the world of shadows and conjecture.</p>
        <p>We had seen their likes before. There was the young boy in a Mercedes truck loaded with TNT who blew up the Marines' headquarters in Beirut on the morning of Oct. 23, 1983, killing 241 American marines and sailors. We still know nothing of him -- not even his name. What he left was the searing memory of the eerie cool with which he made his way around the bunkers, ignoring the rifle fire directed at him and smiling all the while.</p>
        <p>Then and now, there was willful innocence on the part of the outsider. In that earlier fight in Lebanon, we had become a party to a feud between a narrowly based regime and its rivals backed by Iran's revolutionary Islamic crusade. We had become but another militia in a country at war, while insisting that we were there to do order's work, and to keep radicalism in check.</p>
        <p>In this latest episode, the intention was more innocent, yet equally doomed. Our officials wanted to wean Yemen away from radicalism; we did not want Yemen to become a hub of terrorists, one Pentagon planner said. As we monitored the region and sea lanes around Yemen, it stood to reason that the port of Aden (Queen Victoria's first imperial acquisition in 1839, a coaling station for Britannia in its days of splendor) would become an American port of call.</p>
        <p>Yet, our mastery, our very knowledge of that world remains spotty in the extreme. We have traffic with the rulers of Arab and Muslim states, but it gives us precious little insight into these lands. America has come into a kind of imperial domain in the Mediterranean and the Persian Gulf. But the place has been a graveyard to so many of our misplaced hopes.</p>
        <p>America's eagerness to ''engage'' has culminated in tragedy. As that Arab-Muslim world fails and thrashes about, it directs its anger against a distant power. A furious scapegoating and ruinous anti-Americanism has become a substitute for political reform and practical politics.</p>
        <p>A circle of sorts is closed: Two decades ago, Iran's tidal wave of protest, a revolution of a thousand discontents, saw Jimmy Carter off into a bitter political end. Today, it is the legacy of Bill Clinton that is being battered before our eyes.</p>
        <p>That apostle of globalization had come to a conviction that he had mastered the tangled truths of the Middle East. Mr. Clinton had gone to Gaza, spoken to the Palestine National Council, bonded with Yasir Arafat, given his blessing to the emergence of a Palestinian state. The perfect salesman, he had peddled his sunny disposition, his portable belief that liberty and the American way are carried everywhere by modem and the fax and commerce.</p>
        <p>The E-Age had dawned; the call of blood-and-soil, we declared, had been overtaken by the market and the money managers and the Web. In our innocence, we pronounced that there lay before others a simple, inescapable choice: the acquiescence in our way, or a sudden exit out of history itself.</p>
        <p>In the streets of Ramallah and beyond, that world has now issued its terrible verdict on the diplomacy that had placed so much faith in Yasir Arafat and his willingness to accept a practical, decent peace. The two men in the dinghy, the storm in Gaza, the steady erosion of the great victory America secured in the desert campaign against Iraq in 1990 and 1991; all those have given away our inability to read the furies of that world.</p>
        <p>A decade hence, that triumph in the Persian Gulf has become a distant memory. Our allies have gone their separate ways, wearied of our fake pinpricks against Saddam Hussein's regime and embarrassed by our embargo against Iraq, which has become, for all practical purposes, a mere Anglo-American endeavor that has brutalized the Iraqi people but left the despot in place. We have shown neither purpose and resolve, nor mercy.</p>
        <p>We were getting away with hegemony on the cheap, and in the nature of things, such hegemonies never last. We blithely assumed that our writ would run, that the occasional displays of our power -- a steady low-level air campaign against Iraq, the firing of Tomahawk missiles from ships in the Persian Gulf -- would do the trick.</p>
        <p>We know better now. The ''friendship'' and alliances America had built and nurtured, and paid for, were not there when it truly mattered. Some of America's Arab allies sought political cover, ran with -- and at times ahead of -- the popular street. No sooner do we succumb to the illusion that we have deciphered the mysteries of the Arab-Muslim world and incorporated it into our truths than it strikes back. No tears of sympathy, we should know, will be shed in Arab and Muslim lands for the men and women who were struck down aboard the Cole. No such bonds of sympathy have been forged with those societies.</p>
        <p>''Each stranger made his own poor bed among them,'' T. E. Lawrence once wrote of the Arabs of his time. The American imperium is no exception to this rule. Our imperial acquisition came through the usual mix of default and design, by the push of our interests, and by the furtive invitations extended to distant powers by worlds in need of an outside arbiter.</p>
        <p>But it will never be a happy imperium. The Arab-Muslim world lies in taunting proximity to the West, but success and modernity have been denied it. Its people are in a no man's land; the age-old verities have ruptured, but no new path is available to them, or to the young foot soldiers of the campaigns of terror and wrath.</p>
        <p>A terrible sense of disappointment grips that world. The suicide drivers and the men in small boats -- they act out the furies of a world in which the social and political balance has been torn to shreds. That world will always hold a mirror for us. In its glass there are painful truths about ourselves, and about our complacent belief that foreign worlds out there have been mastered and simplified.</p>
