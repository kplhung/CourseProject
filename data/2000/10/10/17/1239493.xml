        <p>Stone-throwing clashes punctuated by exchanges of gunfire erupted across the West Bank and Gaza Strip today as thousands of Palestinians took to the streets in a message of defiance over the summit meeting in Sharm el Sheik.</p>
        <p>Palestinians reported that a policeman and a 13-year-old boy had been killed in the resurging violence, and dozens of protesters were wounded. The Israeli Army said two of its soldiers had been wounded by gunfire.</p>
        <p>Armed members of Yasir Arafat's Fatah movement were visible in  many of the demonstrations, after the group's leadership urged Palestinians to keep up their wave of violent protests, now nearly three weeks old.</p>
        <p>Barely hiding their contempt for the summit meeting, which they portrayed as an attempt to corner their leader, Fatah officials asserted today that Mr. Arafat had been compelled to go to Sharm el Sheik under intense international pressure. Factions opposed to Mr. Arafat condemned the meeting as a sellout, arguing that its agenda fell far short of Palestinian demands.</p>
        <p>''Sharm el Sheik is treason!'' demonstrators chanted at the funeral of a Palestinian protester today in Ramallah, denouncing the host of the meeting, President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, as ''an American agent.'' The protesters burned an American flag.</p>
        <p>The unrest demonstrated the pressures on Mr. Arafat from his own people as he plans his next moves.</p>
        <p>''The priority is to continue the uprising,'' said Marwan Barghouti, the West Bank leader of Fatah, whose gunmen have spearheaded the clashes with Israeli soldiers. ''We will not stop it until there is sovereignty and independence for the Palestinians. President Clinton and the others have to recognize that the only solution to this conflict is an end to Israeli occupation of the Palestinian people.''</p>
        <p>Crowds of Palestinians fought Israeli soldiers with stones and firebombs on the edges of Palestinian-governed cities throughout the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and in some cases the street clashes turned into gun battles.</p>
        <p>Exchanges of fire were reported in the West Bank on the outskirts of Nablus, Ramallah and Bethlehem, where the 13-year-old was fatally shot in unclear circumstances. Near Rafah in the Gaza Strip, a Palestinian policeman was killed, and two Israeli soldiers were wounded in clashes near the Egyptian border.</p>
        <p>Soldiers fired rubber-coated steel bullets to repel rioters near an enclave of Jewish settlers in Hebron, reportedly wounding at least seven Palestinians, one of them seriously. The Israeli Army said a Palestinian policeman had fired on Israeli cars near the Katif enclave of settlements in the Gaza Strip, but had caused no casualties.</p>
        <p>If anything, Mr. Arafat seems to be under mounting pressure to keep up what Palestinians are now calling an intifada, or uprising, the same term used for a revolt against Israeli occupation more than a decade ago.</p>
        <p>''Going to the summit is a big mistake, because its main goal is to abort the intifada,'' said Abdul Jawad Saleh, a member of the Palestinian legislative council from Ramallah who is an outspoken critic of Mr. Arafat. ''The agenda is a trifle: stopping the violence and finding out why the violence took place. We have to root out the causes of the violence. There are substantial problems to solve.''</p>
        <p>The unrest seems to be borne on by waves of rage, intensified with every new Palestinian casualty. At the funeral here today of Raed Hamoudeh, 30, who died of wounds from a clash with Israeli troops, a relative exhorted mourners to continue the struggle. Black-hooded youths with M-16 rifles flanked the grave, and a burst of gunshots was fired in salute.</p>
        <p>''Raed has left us a legacy,'' the relative said. ''The land will be liberated only through continuous sacrifice.''</p>
        <p>For many people here, the model of resistance is now Hezbollah, the militant Muslim group whose guerrillas fought Israeli troops in southern Lebanon. Hezbollah seized three Israeli soldiers on border patrol last week, and had taken another Israeli captive as well, contending that he is an Israeli agent.</p>
        <p>''Greetings from Ramallah to your soldiers, Hezbollah!'' youths chanted as they marched behind Mr. Hamoudeh's body.</p>
        <p>Samar Barghouti, who joined the funeral procession, said that after the killing of about 100 Palestinians in the recent wave of violence, she had finally despaired of peace after Israel used helicopter strikes on Ramallah to retaliate for the killing of two Israeli soldiers by a mob at the local police station.</p>
        <p>''The amount of hate that the Israelis planted in us -- I felt the danger come inside my house,'' said Mrs. Barghouti, a mother of three. ''After that last attack, after the fear I saw in my children, I believe we'll get nothing from Israel unless we start talking the language of Hezbollah. This is what it understands.''</p>
