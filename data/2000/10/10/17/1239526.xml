        <p>Editorial says bombing of USS Cole in Yemen is reminder that in era of terrorism and other unconventinal forms of warfare, US forces abroad face threats that are unforeseen or that Defense Department has been slow to recognize; says all risks cannot be eliminated but every effort must be made to reduce them</p>

        <p>The terrorist bombing of the U.S.S. Cole in Yemen last week left a charred, twisted opening in the vessel's hull and an equally gaping hole in the sense of complacency many Americans felt about the impregnability of the nation's naval forces. Scenes over the weekend of flag-draped coffins arriving at Dover Air Force Base and of wounded sailors returning home to Norfolk to be met by anxious relatives were poignant reminders that even in this age of smart missiles and American might, military service is a dangerous endeavor.</p>
        <p>The 17 sailors who died on the Cole provide a startlingly vulnerable human face to the attack. Nineteen-year-old Lakeina Monique Francis, for instance, was on her first overseas tour when she died in the bombing last Thursday, and had been getting over a case of seasickness.</p>

        <p>The terrorist bombing of the U.S.S. Cole in Yemen last week left a charred, twisted opening in the vessel's hull and an equally gaping hole in the sense of complacency many Americans felt about the impregnability of the nation's naval forces. Scenes over the weekend of flag-draped coffins arriving at Dover Air Force Base and of wounded sailors returning home to Norfolk to be met by anxious relatives were poignant reminders that even in this age of smart missiles and American might, military service is a dangerous endeavor.</p>
        <p>The 17 sailors who died on the Cole provide a startlingly vulnerable human face to the attack. Nineteen-year-old Lakeina Monique Francis, for instance, was on her first overseas tour when she died in the bombing last Thursday, and had been getting over a case of seasickness.</p>
        <p>In an era of terrorism and other unconventional forms of warfare, American forces abroad face threats that the Pentagon has sometimes been slow to recognize and defend against. The Marines paid a high price in Beirut in 1983 when a suicidal truck bomber demolished their barracks, killing 241 men. Four years ago, 19 airmen died and hundreds were wounded when inadequate security precautions left their apartment complex in Saudi Arabia vulnerable to a truck bomb. Now the Navy, despite a conscientious effort to protect its ships when entering foreign ports, has been surprised by a new kind of terrorist assault.</p>
        <p>The unforeseen danger in this case was the slyness of the attack. The Navy imagined the possibility of an open attack on a ship by another boat or by a plane. It did not fully appreciate the danger of terrorists posing as local contractors hired by the Navy to service or refuel its ships. It is painfully easy to see in retrospect that such deception might be employed by terrorists in any of the Middle Eastern ports the Navy uses.</p>
        <p>As the Pentagon examines the attack, it should look at the way foreign ports are selected for refueling. The Navy's role can often be subordinate to that of the American military commander in the region, whose decisions are driven by political as well as military considerations. In the case of Yemen, the presence of American warships was seen as a way of improving relations with a nation strategically located at the southern tip of the Red Sea, midway between the Suez Canal and the Persian Gulf. Last year the senior regional commander, Gen. Anthony C. Zinni, chose Aden as a refueling port partly in hopes that such stops could improve relations and help prod Yemen to drive out foreign terrorists.</p>
        <p>American ships had safely refueled two dozen times in Aden. Several stops had been called off for security reasons. Indeed, the Cole was reportedly on a heightened state of alert on Thursday in preparation for its four-hour refueling stop. But the attack came from an unexpected quarter. It is not yet clear whether the terrorists had infiltrated the work force of the local contractor or were simply familiar enough with port procedures and schedules to blend in with the contractors servicing the Cole. The boat on the suicidal mission seems to have helped in the mooring process. Presumably the sailors manning guns on the decks of the Cole were on the lookout for an airborne attack or a more traditional, frontal assault by the type of makeshift gunboat that harassed American warships in the Persian Gulf in the 1980's.</p>
        <p>The attack makes clear that the Navy and American military attaches assigned to embassies in high-risk places like Yemen must more closely scrutinize the employees and procedures of foreign contractors providing logistical services to American forces. The Navy also needs to develop more aggressive defenses against terrorism when its ships enter foreign ports. Any vessel approaching an American warship should be stopped and searched, even those of local contractors familiar to the Navy. All risks cannot be eliminated when American forces operate overseas, but every effort must be made to reduce the dangers. Terrorism is now one of the greatest of those dangers.</p>
