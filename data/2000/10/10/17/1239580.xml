        <p>The Bcom3 Group in Chicago is shifting the account for the Green Giant brand line of vegetables and frozen dishes from Leo Burnett USA in Chicago, part of the Leo Burnett Worldwide unit, to a sibling agency, N. W. Ayer &amp; Partners in New York.</p>
        <p>Spending was estimated at $20 million.</p>
        <p>Green Giant is a unit of the Pillsbury Company, which is based in Minneapolis. Green Giant was a founding client of Burnett, dating back to 1935; Burnett reinvented the famous Jolly Green Giant brand icon as it is known today.</p>
        <p>But when General Mills in Minneapolis, whose product line includes breakfast cereal brands like Cheerios and Cocoa Puffs, agreed to buy the Pillsbury division of Diageo P.L.C., in a $10.5 billion deal, a competitive conflict arose for Burnett. It also handles advertising for the Kellogg Company in Battle Creek, Mich., on cereal accounts like Froot Loops and Frosted Flakes, for example.</p>
        <p>Also as a result of the conflict between General Mills and Kellogg, Bcom3 is moving the Old El Paso Mexican food brand unit of Pillsbury to Ayer.</p>
        <p>The added business comes at a good time for Ayer, because earlier this month, the Troy, Mich., office of the agency lost the General Motors Corporation corporate advertising and marketing account -- with spending estimated at $15 million to $60 million -- to McCann-Erickson Detroit in Troy, part of the McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising unit of the McCann-Erickson World Group, a subsidiary of the Interpublic Group of Companies.</p>
