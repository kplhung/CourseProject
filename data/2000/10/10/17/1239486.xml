        <p>Seven users of eBay refiled a lawsuit against it yesterday, accusing eBay of neglecting to protect consumers from sales of forged sports memorabilia in its online auctions.</p>
        <p>The lawsuit was resubmitted in response to a ruling last Wednesday by a judge in San Diego, who dismissed the complaints against eBay but allowed the plaintiffs to refile them using more specific arguments.</p>
        <p>Judge Linda B. Quinn is presiding over the case and is scheduled to consider on Nov. 17 whether it should become a class action, if the case is allowed to continue. The original lawsuit was filed in Superior Court in San Diego County in April.</p>
        <p>Officials of eBay, which is based in San Jose, Calif., had declined to comment on last week's ruling. But yesterday they said they were pleased with the judge's action on the case so far. ''The plaintiffs' case failed to clear the first hurdle,'' said Robert Chesnut, associate general counsel for eBay.</p>
        <p>In refiling their lawsuit, the plaintiffs laid out arguments that included language from the laws that they argue eBay had broken. Part of the case, for example, is based on a California law that requires dealers to guarantee the authenticity of the sports memorabilia they sell. The law defines dealers as businesses that sell autographed collectibles and provide descriptions of those items. In the resubmitted complaint, the plaintiffs say that eBay does, in fact, provide descriptions on its Web site.</p>
        <p>EBay has argued that its members provide the descriptions and that the Web site is simply a conduit. It also argues that it is covered under federal laws that protect Internet service providers from liability for material transmitted on their networks.</p>
        <p>After quickly reviewing the resubmitted lawsuit, Mr. Chesnut said he was still confident that eBay's arguments would prevail. ''There are no substantial changes here,'' he said. ''And we will be filing a motion to dismiss shortly.''</p>
        <p>In Nasdaq trading yesterday, shares of eBay, after being off more than $2 in the morning, rebounded to close at $59.63, up $3.75.</p>
