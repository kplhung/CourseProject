        <p>A state judge yesterday imposed the maximum sentence of 25 years to life on a young man convicted of murdering his former girlfriend, a Columbia University law student.</p>
        <p>Before a somber courtroom, the judge, Harold B. Beeler of State Supreme Court in Manhattan, described the man, Edmund Ko, 26, as ''emotionally empty and pathological'' and said he had violated the victim's trust and committed a ''brutal murder.''</p>
        <p>In July, Mr. Ko was convicted of second-degree murder for killing Hyseung Lynda Hong, 26, in her Manhattan apartment in March 1998, slashing her throat in what prosecutors described as an attack intended to impress a jealous girlfriend.</p>
        <p>Ms. Hong's and Mr. Ko's families, who were in the courtroom, showed no reaction after Justice Beeler imposed the sentence. Mr. Ko, who has maintained his innocence, was then led away by court officers.</p>
        <p>Before the sentencing, Ms. Hong's mother and sister read statements describing their continuing agony of loss.</p>
        <p>''Writer Victor Hugo once wrote to a mother who lost her child, 'Every day will be the first day,' '' the mother, Yeoran Hong, told the court. ''Every day since Lynda has been taken from us has been a new day of pain and loss. It will be forever.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ko's new lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, read a statement from his client that said in part, ''Despite my innocence, I am deeply saddened by the loss.''</p>
        <p>The sentencing closed a chapter for the family of Ms. Hong, who was found in her Upper West Side apartment in 1998 with her throat slashed. In letters to the judge, friends recalled her as exceptionally generous, talented and bright, with a promising legal career ahead of her.</p>
        <p>And though Mr. Ko, who once worked as an associate buyer at Macy's in Herald Square, was also a bright student who came from great privilege, an assistant Manhattan district attorney, Ann Prunty, painted a different picture of him as she spoke before the sentencing.</p>
        <p>She said he appeared to be a ''meek student of classical literature,'' carrying a novel by Steinbeck in one hand, but urged the judge to imagine him carrying a razor and wearing sweat pants ''literally dripping with Lynda Hong's blood.'' That Edmund Ko, she said, is ''purely diabolical.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ko still faces charges in the slashing of another former girlfriend, a liberal arts student at Bergen Community College in Hackensack, N.J., who was cut repeatedly on her head, face and legs with a razor just months before Ms. Hong was killed.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors have contended that both attacks were motivated by Mr. Ko's efforts to impress an older woman he was dating at the time, who was jealous of his previous girlfriends.</p>
        <p>While the sentencing put an end to the criminal case, the impact on the Ko and Hong families, who both live in New Jersey, and among affluent Korean-Americans in New Jersey, who have been following the case closely, may last for some time. Ms. Hong's sister, Amy Hong, said outside the courthouse that she and her parents rejected the condolences offered to them yesterday, for the first time, by Mr. Ko and his parents.</p>
        <p>''We sat next to them for over a year, and they have not extended condolences to us once,'' said Ms. Hong, flanked by her parents.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ko's parents, who live in Cliffside Park, N.J., and own one of South Korea's largest luxury leather-goods companies, filed silently from the courtroom after their son's sentencing, appearing pale and exhausted.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brafman said Mr. Ko maintained that he was the victim of a conspiracy.</p>
        <p>When asked by whom, Mr. Brafman declined to comment. But he said, ''Mr. Ko is extremely bright, and to see him in this position breaks your heart.</p>
        <p>''There are no winners in this case.  It is just a loss for two very special families.''</p>
