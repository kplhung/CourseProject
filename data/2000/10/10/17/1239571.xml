        <p>The intense self-analysis might begin with a shrug of the shoulders or a wave of the hand and graduates to a high-pitched voice filled with frustration. Paul O'Neill is doing it again, telling a teammate or even a reporter why he is so bad or asking them how bad he looks. The door to his psyche is always open.</p>
        <p>The Yankees need a victory in Game 6 against the Seattle Mariners tonight, or in a possible seventh game tomorrow night, to reach the World Series for the third straight year, but O'Neill is not enjoying himself. Actually, O'Neill is relieved because the Yankees are winning. But, personally, O'Neill, a constant on the Yankees for the last eight years, has turned into a spare part. He has gone from playing co-host to holding the cue cards.</p>
        <p>It upsets O'Neill. He looked as if he were in a trance when Joe Torre removed him for the pinch-hitter Glenallen Hill in Sunday's 6-2 loss after O'Neill had already walked to the batter's box. Did this really happen? Although Torre said the fans were so loud that O'Neill did not hear him before leaving the on-deck circle, O'Neill was bothered by the move. With his fingers spread an inch apart, O'Neill admitted, ''I felt about this big.''</p>
        <p>Once Torre pinch-hit for O'Neill for the second time in the postseason and did it in the haphazard manner that a high school coach might call back a sophomore shortstop, it was more evidence that O'Neill's status had plummeted and that his career with the Yankees was evaporating. It has grown more unlikely that the Yankees will try to re-sign the struggling 37-year-old outfielder. Instead, expect the Yankees to make a strong attempt at signing the free-agent right fielder Manny Ramirez, who wants more than $15 million a year.</p>
        <p>''In light of what happened, it certainly creates some doubt in my mind'' about the Yankees signing O'Neill, Joe Bick, O'Neill's agent, said. ''His preference is to stay.''</p>
        <p>General Manager Brian Cashman defended Torre's use of Hill with the bases loaded against Arthur Rhodes by saying that the Yankees were looking for ''four quick runs,'' and Hill had the better chance to go deep. Cashman was noncommittal about O'Neill's future and would not discuss interest in Ramirez, a player whom David Justice called ''the best right-handed hitter in baseball.''</p>
        <p>Although George Steinbrenner adores O'Neill and calls him a warrior, Ramirez is an offensive machine with a marquee name who is from Washington Heights.</p>
        <p>''We haven't discussed what we're going to do in the winter,'' Cashman said. ''We're concentrating on getting the job done now.''</p>
        <p>Six weeks ago, it was sensible to believe that the Yankees would simply re-sign O'Neill for another year. He was hitting .297 with 18 homers and 96 runs batted in on Sept. 6. He would probably not want more than the $6.5 million he made this season and he obviously wanted to stay in New York. But O'Neill finished the season with 9 hits in his last 58 at-bats. He did not have an extra-base hit and he knocked in only four runs. In the postseason, O'Neill is 7 for 35 with two R.B.I. and Torre moved him from third to seventh in the lineup. Base runners have successfully tested his erratic arm several times.</p>
        <p>''Obviously, I'd be the first one to admit I'm struggling,'' O'Neill said. ''If you don't get the big hit, you're not worth anything.''</p>
        <p>The uncertainty of the future has probably had an impact on O'Neill, who said: ''Every once in a while you think about it. But it has no bearing on what you do in the game.''</p>
        <p>If a game lasts three hours and O'Neill sleeps eight hours, figure that he ponders his future for 12 of the other 13 hours. It is only human. Besides, the Yankees have not made one overture to O'Neill about an extension and that caused him to offer a sheepish smile last month and say, ''They got to want me.''</p>
        <p>Bick, who was told by Cashman that the Yankees would wait until after the season to make decisions on players who are in their walk years, said that his client was dealing with emotional issues because ''he has more doubts about the future than he's ever had before.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees, who are trying to win another title while proving that they have aged gracefully, are like a veteran marathoner chugging to the finish line one last time. Sometimes they sprint. Sometimes they jog. O'Neill epitomizes this once champion marathoner, reaching for a kick around 20 miles and realizing his legs feel like jelly.</p>
        <p>O'Neill has a right hip pointer that Bick said has left him playing at less than 100 percent, no shock since O'Neill played with fractured ribs last October and with a strained hamstring in the 1996 postseason. If the Yankees can persuade the moody, defensively challenged Ramirez to sign with them, there would be no place for O'Neill. His self-analysis would continue, but not in New York.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes you want to do too much and you don't slow down,'' O'Neill said. ''You don't know what you're doing. You don't allow yourself to just play the way you should. I don't care who you are. When you have a big game, you want to play well.''</p>
