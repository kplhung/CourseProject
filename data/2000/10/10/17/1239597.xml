        <p>All year long, they promised to be Amazin' Again. That was the Mets' vow, and it was everywhere, from the billboards to the pocket schedules, and there was reason to believe the pledge. The Mets fell just short of the World Series last year, thrilling and intriguing their fans with comebacks and controversy. This year brought more of the same.</p>
        <p>But this year has brought something else, the fulfillment of a pledge, truth in advertising in an election year. The Mets are Amazin', and the capital A fits.</p>
        <p>The Mets reached the World Series for the fourth time in their 39-year history last night when Mike Hampton pitched them to a 7-0 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals in the fifth game of the National League Championship Series at Shea Stadium.</p>
        <p>The Yankees can make the Subway Series a reality for the first time in 44 years with a victory over Seattle tonight at Yankee Stadium in Game 6 of the American League Championship Series. It would be the Yankees' fourth appearance in the World Series in the last five years, but the first all-New York World Series since the Yankees beat the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1956.</p>
        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, wearing a commemorative Mets cap in the Champagne-soaked home clubhouse, said, ''We're prepared for an absolutely incredible Series.''</p>
        <p>The mayor said he would root for the Yankees, if they beat Seattle and play host to the Mets in Game 1 in the Bronx on Saturday night. ''When I get to the World Series,'' he said, ''I've got to go back to being a kid.''</p>
        <p>Fred Wilpon, the Mets' co-owner and a Brooklyn native who pitched batting practice to the Dodgers in the early 1950's, said he would cheer for the Yankees tonight. Wilpon said he was ecstatic for the city, and an admirer of the Yankees, who have 25 World Series titles to the Mets' two.</p>
        <p>''All we are,'' Wilpon said, ''is the little guy in Queens trying to emulate the Yankees.''</p>
        <p>The biggest little guy in Queens last night was Hampton, the 5-foot-10-inch left-hander who won for the second time this series and captured the most valuable player award for the series. Hampton tossed seven shutout innings in Game 1 and went the distance last night, allowing only three hits and striking out eight.</p>
        <p>Hampton got Rick Wilkins to fly to center fielder Timo Perez for the final out. Hampton thrust his arms in the air and was lifted by third baseman Robin Ventura, touching off a long on-field party.</p>
        <p>The 40-year-old reliever John Franco, who has been with the Mets 11 years and never tasted the World Series, got a ride on his teammates' shoulders, waving a towel and exulting in the moment. Left fielder Benny Agbayani, who has had a season-long love affair with the fans in the left field seats, ran to them and slapped hands up and down the front row.</p>
        <p>Soon, a throng of players embarked on a victory lap, some tossing caps and souvenir T-shirts. The veteran reserve Lenny Harris led the charge, and he had been preparing to celebrate three hours before game time. That is when Harris asked Hampton, ''Are you ready?''</p>
        <p>Hampton, a picture of intensity even in spring training, had a terse reply: ''Just give me the ball.''</p>
        <p>''I knew we weren't going back to St. Louis after that,'' Harris said. ''He wanted the ball at 5:00.''</p>
        <p>At 11:39, Hampton -- who came into this series without a victory in four career postseason starts -- had the victory. With 16 shutout innings this series, he also has a permanent place in Mets' lore.</p>
        <p>The Amazin' Mets won it all in 1969. The ''Ya Gotta Believe'' dreamers added a pennant in '73. The 1986 club swaggered its way to a World Series title with the help of a tricky hop. And now come these Mets, Manager Bobby Valentine's collection of expensive veterans and youthful bargains who became just the second wild card team to reach the World Series since the playoffs expanded in 1995. The other one, the Florida Marlins in 1997, won the Series.</p>
        <p>''When you have great players playing great,'' Valentine said, ''it makes my job real easy.''</p>
        <p>The biggest addition General Manager Steve Phillips gave Valentine this year was Hampton, a 22-game winner for Houston in 1999 who was traded to the Mets last December. Hampton won 15 games in the regular season and will probably start Game 1 of the World Series.</p>
        <p>''I really haven't been able to think much about Mets history,'' Hampton said. ''I wanted to come out and pitch a big game. I wanted my team to be right there behind me and I wanted them to have an easy night. I was fortunate -- things went my way.''</p>
        <p>The veterans Edgardo Alfonzo, Mike Piazza and Todd Zeile hit safely in every game of the series. So did Perez, the rookie leadoff sensation who had a hit to start a rally every game. But it was the addition of Hampton that probably did the most to elevate the Mets a step further than last year.</p>
        <p>''We have some experience; we went through it a year ago,'' Phillips said. ''The other big difference is our pitching is just that tick better than it was a year ago. We're stronger at the front of our rotation, and a little deeper in the bullpen.</p>
        <p>''And I know people criticized Bobby down the stretch, and I raised my eyebrow too, about resting guys. But we had fresher legs going into the postseason, and I think it helped.''</p>
        <p>A tidy game had an ugly confrontation near the end. With Jay Payton batting for the Mets and two outs in the eighth inning, Cardinals right-hander Dave Veres drilled Payton in the head with a 1-2 fastball. Payton, knocked to the ground, bolted up and stalked out to the mound, St. Louis catcher Eli Marrero in front of him all the way.</p>
        <p>Both benches and bullpens emptied, and teammates restrained Payton, who had blood tricking down his face and left for a pinch-runner.</p>
        <p>The crowd, joyful all night, howled through the fracas, heavily booing Veres, who was allowed to stay in the game and finish the inning. When Veres returned to the dugout, it was as if the party-crasher had been escorted out. The good times resumed as Hampton completed his masterpiece.</p>
        <p>Until Payton's beaning, the crowd shook Shea Stadium most in the fourth inning, after a rally sparked, naturally, by Perez, who singled off the foot of the Cardinals' starter, Pat Hentgen. Piazza singled and Ventura walked, bringing up Zeile with the bases loaded.</p>
        <p>With a 2-2 count, Zeile crushed a fastball that cut through the chilly air and caught the wind, crashing into the wall in right center and clearing the bases. The Mets led, 6-0, and Zeile punched the air softly with his fist, satisfied with the bedlam he had set off.</p>
        <p>Perez scored first, followed by Piazza and Ventura, who high-fived Perez with both hands after crossing home. The bench players charged from the dugout and bounced excitedly, and the fans took their cue.</p>
        <p>Hentgen's night was over, and the pitching change gave the crowd more time to celebrate the championship they sensed. Suddenly, it was Mookie Wilson's dribbler in '86, the Miracle Mets in '69, the Beatles in concert in '65. The old place pulsated, the fans standing and stomping as music pulsated.</p>
        <p>It will be alive again next Tuesday, when Shea Stadium plays host to a World Series game for the first time in 14 years.</p>
        <p>''It's probably going to be even more incredible than it was in the 1950's,'' Giuliani said. ''In the 50's, it happened almost every year; people got blase. This city is going to be electric.''</p>
