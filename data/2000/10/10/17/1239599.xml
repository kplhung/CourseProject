        <p>Thomas L. Friedman's suggestion (column, Oct. 13) that Yasir Arafat could have settled for Prime Minister Ehud Barak's peace offer is based on the faulty assumption that the Palestinian leadership would be politically capable of reaching an agreement that left Israel with ultimate control over Arab parts of Jerusalem.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Thomas L. Friedman's suggestion (column, Oct. 13) that Yasir Arafat could have settled for Prime Minister Ehud Barak's peace offer is based on the faulty assumption that the Palestinian leadership would be politically capable of reaching an agreement that left Israel with ultimate control over Arab parts of Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>Yet Mr. Arafat never had the domestic support to accept partial compromises, as logical and desirable as they may seem. We must remember that the peace talks forestalled the discussions of Jerusalem in order to build trust between both sides.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, Israeli and Palestinian sensitivities over Jerusalem have not died down. Until the American public realizes this, we will continue to point fingers in each direction, lamenting the fact that an agreement was almost at hand.</p>
