        <p>Performing well when there is no pressure is one thing. Performing well when a lot is at stake is something else, as the Islanders are quickly learning.</p>
        <p>There aren't many smiles in the locker room or on the practice ice these days, and not without reason. The revamped, refurbished, renewed Islanders are 0-2-1 heading into tonight's game against the Anaheim Mighty Ducks at Nassau Coliseum, and the performance anxiety could be at a level not seen since the Islanders last made the playoffs six years ago.</p>
        <p>''This isn't like the second half of last season, when there was no shot at the playoffs,'' said defenseman Garry Galley, a 17-year veteran who is in his first season with the Islanders. ''Right now there are pressures and expectations. And that brings some anxiety. When you see guys gripping the sticks and missing passes, that's an indication of how anxious they are. You can see it on their faces.''</p>
        <p>The Islanders figured to be at least 2-1 at this point. Instead, they had to fight for a tie with Tampa Bay, lost a one-goal lead in the 3-2 loss to Toronto, and were shut out by a desperate Calgary team in Saturday's home opener as the power play fell to 0 for 20.</p>
        <p>''A lot of guys, including myself, are gripping the sticks a little too tight,''forward Brad Isbister said. ''Right now, it's kind of tough to put a smile on. But we've talked about keeping a positive attitude; one win, and we're right back in the mix of things.''</p>
        <p>Coach Butch Goring, who has shortened and intensified practice times in an effort to infuse energy into the team, said he expected high-level performances tonight.</p>
        <p>''It is possible to want to win too badly,'' Goring said. ''But we've had some good practices, and I fully expect to see our A team against the Ducks.''</p>

        <p>WINGS LOSE YZERMAN TO SURGERY: The Red Wings' slow start this season now looks like the least of their problems.</p>
        <p>The Detroit captain, Steve Yzerman, will be out of the lineup indefinitely after undergoing surgery yesterday to repair torn cartilage in his right knee.</p>
        <p>The Red Wings (2-3), who play St. Louis tonight in Detroit, did not give a timetable on when Yzerman would return from the arthroscopic procedure.</p>

        <p>SENATORS' GOALIE SIDELINED: Ottawa goalie Patrick Lalime will be out for the next 7 to 10 days after spraining the medial collateral ligament in his left knee, the team said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Lalime was injured during Sunday's 4-0 victory over Toronto.</p>
