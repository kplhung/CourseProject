        <p>Dave Veres's two-seam fastball rode up and in on Jay Payton and sent the Mets' rookie onto his back. Payton bounced up and stomped toward the mound, and finally the Cardinals could let go some of the frustration building in this series.</p>
        <p>But that was not the point, Veres said after the Cardinals had been eliminated with a 7-0 loss to the Mets at Shea Stadium last night. St. Louis returned home having lost the National League Championship Series, four games to one, and looked completely frustrated, even if the players did not say so.</p>
        <p>''I'm not a headhunter by any means,'' Veres said in a quiet Cardinals clubhouse as players quickly dressed for their flight home.</p>
        <p>Veres said his eighth-inning pitch was not intentional nor was it done as the final act of a tired team that saw a quick reversal of fortunes in this postseason. After sweeping the Atlanta Braves in three games in the division series last week, St. Louis was dominated by the Mets.</p>
        <p>Veres explained his transgression as the result of a natural sequence of pitches, and that Payton was hit only because of the batter's tendency to dive into home plate. Veres said he thought Payton would be expecting a split-finger fastball and wanted to brush him back but not hit him.</p>
        <p>''Why would I throw at him like that? I had no reason to,'' Veres said. ''I'd have been mad, too. Nobody wants to get hit in the head, period, let alone in that area. I'm not trying to hurt anybody.''</p>
        <p>Payton left the game with a cut above his left eye. Before that, he marched toward the mound with Cardinals catcher Eli Marrero backpedaling in front of him.</p>
        <p>''What are you doing -- are you stupid?'' Veres said he told Payton. ''I wanted to make sure he wasn't going to sucker punch me over Eli, make sure he kept his distance.''</p>
        <p>The Cards hardly resembled one of the National League's best teams during the regular season. Gone was catcher Mike Matheny, who missed the playoffs after cutting his hand with a hunting knife at the end of the regular season. The deep starting pitching was without one of its key members: Garrett Stephenson, the 16-game winner who beat the Braves in the division series, was sidelined with a sprained ligament in his pitching elbow.</p>
        <p>Rick Ankiel, the club's dominant left-handed rookie, became an uncontrollable hurler in the playoffs. He threw two more wild pitches last night to finish with nine in three postseason games.</p>
        <p>And Mark McGwire, perhaps the most feared pinch-hitter in postseason history, was 0 for 2 with an intentional walk in the series. He flied out to left field in the fourth inning of the third game and then never got closer than the on-deck circle until the ninth inning. McGwire still elicited flashbulbs when he received a mercy pinch-hitting appearance for Jim Edmonds and grounded out to second base.</p>
        <p>Edmonds, the front-runner for the league's Most Valuable Player award, played the entire series with a sprained back he sustained in the division series. He struck out in all three plate appearances against Mets starter Mike Hampton.</p>
        <p>Even without their pitching in tatters, this would have been the most unlikely of comebacks.</p>
        <p>Cardinals Manager Tony La Russa, under constant scrutiny in this series for his use or lack of use of McGwire, maintained another personal streak. His teams have never come back to win after trailing in a postseason series.</p>
        <p>Will Clark twice refused to answer questions about what happened to the Cardinals between sweeping the Braves and losing to the Mets. Other players gave credit to the Mets. Fernando Vina conceded that all the injuries and problems finally caught up with St. Louis.</p>
        <p>''It all compounds together,'' Vina said. ''We definitely wanted everybody with us, but give the Mets credit.''</p>
