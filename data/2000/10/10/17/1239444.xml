        <p>Strong exports and a mild rebound in domestic spending drove China's economic growth rate to 8.2 percent in the third quarter, the government reported today. The rate was faster than expected and virtually ensured that a seven-year slide in the country's growth rate has ended.</p>
        <p>The rebound is important in preparing China's economy for World Trade Organization membership, which is expected to subject some sectors of the country's economy to strong foreign competition. But the numbers gloss over enduring economic weaknesses, particularly in the countryside.</p>
        <p>''In general, so far this year, economic development was better than expected,'' the State Statistical Bureau spokesman, Ye Zhen, told a news conference.</p>
        <p>China's gross domestic product expansion of 8.2 percent in the quarter was less than the 8.3 percent rise in the second quarter but was still better than the widespread expectations that third-quarter growth would slip below 8 percent. The third-quarter performance puts the economy on track to beat the 7.1 percent growth posted in 1999, reversing seven years of slowing growth.</p>
        <p>While even 7.1 percent growth sounds high by international standards, it is considered near the danger zone in China, where economic development is spread unevenly across the huge country. Many areas were in recession last year with unemployment reaching as high as 30 percent in some towns.</p>
        <p>Government officials worried that a further slide in economic growth could fuel political unrest.</p>
        <p>China sneaked through Asia's economic crisis despite a sharp slowdown in exports and a drop in foreign investment by pumping up its economy with heavy government spending. That spending has slowed, but export growth is again strong, driving the economy. The country's exports increased 33.1 percent in the January-to-September period after gaining 38 percent in the first half of the year. Exports account for about one-fifth of China's G.D.P. and the United States takes about a fifth of all China's exports.</p>
        <p>But rural incomes in the first nine months of the year rose just 2.5 percent compared with an 8.4 percent increase in urban incomes. That gap has widened from a year ago. China's farmers, hit this year by a severe drought, are among the most vulnerable to changes that will flow from the country's membership in the W.T.O., which will open China's markets to higher-quality, lower-priced agricultural products.</p>
        <p>And domestic spending remains weak despite signs of a mild recovery. The government has extended national holidays and sharply cut interest rates on bank deposits to get people to use some of their savings. Retail sales grew 9.9 percent in the nine-month period, while consumer prices edged 0.2 percent higher in the period compared with a year earlier.</p>
        <p>Financial insecurity over the impact of China's membership in the W.T.O., which could be completed within months, is likely to keep many Chinese consumers in a saving mood. ''In the long run, I think that we still have to face the problem of insufficient demand,'' Mr. Ye of the statistical bureau said.</p>
