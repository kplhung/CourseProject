        <p>Li Chiao-Ping Dance  Danspace Project</p>
        <p>Li Chiao-Ping struggled with problems of flesh and spirit in ''(Lost) Residues,'' the program Li Chiao-Ping Dance offered on Friday night.</p>
        <p>Ms. Li, who is based in Madison, Wis., was choreographically strongest in two solos. In ''Grafting,'' a premiere, Douglas Rosenberg's designs made her appear to stand as if in the center of an arena, surrounded  by glowing bars of light. Looking trapped in this space, she crouched, twisted, stood on her head and let her hands flutter nervously to recorded percussion music by Stephen Vitiello. Every step she took was a variation on the theme of anxiety.</p>

        <p>Li Chiao-Ping Dance  Danspace Project</p>
        <p>Li Chiao-Ping struggled with problems of flesh and spirit in ''(Lost) Residues,'' the program Li Chiao-Ping Dance offered on Friday night.</p>
        <p>Ms. Li, who is based in Madison, Wis., was choreographically strongest in two solos. In ''Grafting,'' a premiere, Douglas Rosenberg's designs made her appear to stand as if in the center of an arena, surrounded  by glowing bars of light. Looking trapped in this space, she crouched, twisted, stood on her head and let her hands flutter nervously to recorded percussion music by Stephen Vitiello. Every step she took was a variation on the theme of anxiety.</p>
        <p>Letting her arms slash through the air, Lori Dillon moved forcefully through ''Mandala'' to Chinese percussion music. She invested her gestures with such fervor that it was easy to believe that she portrayed someone on a momentous quest.</p>
        <p>''Satori,'' danced by Susan Haskell, Yun-Chen Liu and Ms. Dillon, attempted to evoke a state of mystical serenity. But the way the women drifted about eventually seemed bland, rather than spiritually serene.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rosenberg's ingenious designs overpowered the choreography for ''Fin de Siecle.'' Walter Dundervill marched and staggered in various states of desperation. But ghostly video images projected on a wall gradually clarified and revealed themselves to be action-packed scenes from an old Flash Gordon science-fiction movie. And the choreography could not compete with them.</p>
        <p>The program also included excerpts from ''Venous Flow: States of Grace,'' which a program note identified as ''a developing, evening-length collaboration'' between Ms. Li and Mr. Rosenberg. What Ms. Li showed on this occasion were enigmatic sequences for women moving in desperation while statements about dreams and illness were projected on the wall. One was left curious about how this developing piece will develop.</p>
