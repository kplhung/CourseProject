      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Jason A. Turner, New York City's top social services official, has acknowledged that he broke city conflict-of-interest laws by using his executive assistant and city telephones, computers and a fax machine to  complete work on an Arizona consulting contract he had won before arriving in the city in 1998.</p>
        <p>Mr. Turner, the commissioner of the Human Resources Administration, also improperly hired a former business partner, Mark S. Hoover, as his top deputy, and then rented a Long Island City, Queens, apartment from Mr. Hoover, both violations of the conflict laws.</p>
        <p>The city's Conflicts of Interest Board yesterday scolded Mr. Turner for the violations and levied a $6,500 fine against him.</p>
        <p>''These are textbook violations of core provisions of the city's ethics law,'' said Joan R. Salzman, the board's chief of enforcement, who said the fine is the fifth largest in the board's 10-year history. ''People who enter public service should be prepared to live by these rules and make certain that their private interests do not conflict with their official duties.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Turner and Mr. Hoover declined requests for comment yesterday, but a lawyer representing the commissioner called the violations  ''relatively minor.''</p>
        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani yesterday issued a statement asserting  confidence in the commissioner.  ''These is no allegation or evidence that Jason Turner knowingly violated any rule,'' Mr. Giuliani said. ''He has admitted, however, that he made mistakes, and he agreed to pay a fine. He also has given his assurance that he will be careful in the future to comply with these rules now that he has been made aware of them.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Turner, who is paid $150,500 a year, came to the Giuliani administration in February 1998, having built  a national reputation as a welfare administrator in Wisconsin. He was assigned by Mr. Giuliani to figure out ways to continue to trim the city's welfare rolls, while also improving job training and homeless prevention programs.</p>
        <p>But several of these plans have been slowed by court challenges or allegations of wrongdoing, including the proposed award of $104 million in welfare-to-work contracts to Maximus, a Virginia company that hired Mr. Turner's father-in-law as it was pursuing the city work. The city comptroller's office rejected the Maximus contracts in March, saying the process was ''tainted by favoritism and cronyism.'' They are now the subject of a federal criminal investigation.</p>
        <p>The conflict-of-interest violations are ''yet another example of Jason Turner's abuse of the office he holds,'' said City Councilman Stephen DiBrienza, a Brooklyn Democrat who is chairman of the Council's general welfare committee. ''We as a city should expect better.''</p>
        <p>The violations Mr. Turner admitted to relate to three provisions of the city's ethics code. City equipment and personnel cannot be used to perform private work. To avoid favoritism, supervisors are also prohibited from hiring former business partners, unless a special waiver is obtained. Supervisors are also not allowed to enter into financial arrangements with their employees, like renting an apartment.</p>
        <p>The ties between Mr. Turner and Mr. Hoover date to at least the mid-1990's, when they worked together in the Wisconsin Department of Work Force Development. After Mr. Turner left his Wisconsin post in 1997 to become executive director of a Wisconsin-based consulting company that won a contract to help Arizona design its own welfare-to-work program.</p>
        <p>Mr. Turner and Mr. Hoover collaborated on the Arizona project before Mr. Turner arrived in New York City. And then in March 1998, Mr. Turner hired Mr. Hoover as the first deputy commissioner at Human Resources. ''I failed to get a waiver from the conflict-of-interest board before hiring him,'' Mr. Turner said Friday in a signed statement to the board, which released it yesterday.  ''I believed Mr. Hoover was the best-qualified person for the job.''</p>
        <p>Until about August 1998, the two continued to do occasional work on the Arizona contract, including, for example, at least four trips to Phoenix by Mr. Hoover in May and July 1998 to update state officials on their progress.</p>
        <p>There is no allegation that the city financed these trips. But Mr. Turner acknowledged in his statement that he used a city telephone, fax and computer as he worked on the Arizona contract, which ultimately earned his consulting company about $100,000, according to his partner.</p>
        <p>Mr. Turner also asked his executive assistant, Michael O'Malley, to type up and edit documents, send e-mail messages and handle other tasks related to the Arizona contract. Mr. Turner estimated that Mr. O'Malley worked on these assignments for about five hours.</p>
        <p>From April 1998 through June 1999, Mr. Turner rented the apartment in City Lights co-op complex  overlooking the East River owned by Mr. Hoover, paying him up to $700 a month.</p>
        <p>It was one of three apartments Mr. Hoover rented to Human Resources staff members, a practice that is itself the subject of a separate conflict-of-interest investigation. In his statement, Mr. Turner contended that he paid the market rate for the apartment, but ''I acknowledge that my payments for the rent constituted a 'financial relationship' with a subordinate employee.' ''</p>
        <p>Matthew Fishbein, a lawyern representing Mr. Turner, said each violation admitted to by Mr. Turner could be traced to his desire to honor his Arizona commitment while moving to undertake his new assignment in New York City quickly.</p>
        <p>Ms. Salzman and Mark Davies, executive director of the Conflicts of Interest Board, rejected suggestions that Mr. Turner's violations were minor. ''Commissioners are supposed to be role models for the city work force,'' Mr. Davies said in a statement. ''Because they must set the example for others, it is extremely important that they be free of financial conflicts of interest.''</p>
