        <p>Reading the solemn tributes in the 381-page catalog for the Giorgio Armani exhibition that opens on Friday at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, one thinks of what the writer Janet Flanner said 40 years ago of another immortal, Thomas Mann. Like Mr. Armani, a scion of the purely sensual, Mann, she wrote, has endured ''the singular experience of being regularly described, while still alive, in terms usually reserved for the exceptional dead.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Armani would never call himself an artist, though the linear form of his clothes certainly contains elements of modern architecture, and of all the great clothing designers, living or dead, only he has been able to take a painterly approach to gray -- seeing light and shadow where others might see only charcoal and flint. Nor, for all the catalog's heavy weather -- its descriptions of androgynous attire as ''gender transpositions'' -- would Mr. Armani even say he believes in the power of fashion to make a person feel elegant or secure. As Franca Sozzani, the editor of Italian Vogue, succinctly points out in her catalog essay, Mr. Armani believes mostly in consistency. The same clean cuts. The same minimalist palette. The same rational approach to luxury through comfort.</p>

        <p>Reading the solemn tributes in the 381-page catalog for the Giorgio Armani exhibition that opens on Friday at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, one thinks of what the writer Janet Flanner said 40 years ago of another immortal, Thomas Mann. Like Mr. Armani, a scion of the purely sensual, Mann, she wrote, has endured ''the singular experience of being regularly described, while still alive, in terms usually reserved for the exceptional dead.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Armani would never call himself an artist, though the linear form of his clothes certainly contains elements of modern architecture, and of all the great clothing designers, living or dead, only he has been able to take a painterly approach to gray -- seeing light and shadow where others might see only charcoal and flint. Nor, for all the catalog's heavy weather -- its descriptions of androgynous attire as ''gender transpositions'' -- would Mr. Armani even say he believes in the power of fashion to make a person feel elegant or secure. As Franca Sozzani, the editor of Italian Vogue, succinctly points out in her catalog essay, Mr. Armani believes mostly in consistency. The same clean cuts. The same minimalist palette. The same rational approach to luxury through comfort.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, as Mr. Armani was going up and down Frank Lloyd Wright's spiral ramp, which has been carpeted in gray for the exhibition and buttressed by yards of white theatrical scrim stretched between the creamy parapets, he said something that might sound shocking from a man who, after 25 years of making clothes and keeping his name out there, is not without his vanities.</p>
        <p>He likes the fact that Thomas Krens, the Guggenheim's director, personally asked him to be the subject of the largest one-man fashion exhibition ever seen in New York -- nearly 400 articles of clothing and accessories. He likes the fact that 600 people, including Robert DeNiro, Liam Neeson, Natasha Richardson, Mark Wahlberg and many socially connected New Yorkers, will be there on Wednesday night for the preview party. And let's not forget that he has promised to donate as much as $15 million to the Guggenheim.</p>
        <p>Yet, when asked what single impression he hoped people would take away from this daunting display of fashion, prestige and, yes, ego, he replied mildly, ''I hope they will see that the base and concept of my work has always been the same.''</p>
        <p>One kept thinking about Mr. Armani and his clothes last week in the middle of the French spring 2001 collections -- thinking about how to view his achievement at a time when much of the focus in fashion has not only shifted away from Mr. Armani, but also from almost everything he has symbolized -- above all, the rational expression of style.</p>
        <p>Perhaps because so much of the attention last week in Paris was aimed like a revolver at Tom Ford and his first ready-to-wear collection for Yves Saint Laurent, one kept seeing connections between him and Mr. Armani, and between the two of them and Mr. Saint Laurent himself. Just by following how each has approached the design of the suit, which has been the basis of modern fashion since Gabrielle Chanel borrowed the essential components of comfort and uniformity from a man's wardrobe, you can see how this intelligible style reached its apogee with Mr. Armani's unconstructed suits, and is now disintegrating with Mr. Ford. And for some very logical reasons.</p>
        <p>Mr. Armani could not have taken the padding out of suits in the late 1970's and 80's if Mr. Saint Laurent had not seen the need to put it there in the first place. Padding was armor, and armor is what Mr. Saint Laurent gave legions of women, feminists and fashion plates alike, in the early 70's when he dressed them in his ''smokings,'' those wide-shouldered pantsuits, typically in black or white, that were shown with high heels and sheer blouses that kept the look from being completely masculine.</p>
        <p>By the time Mr. Armani came along, the world had changed. Fashion was becoming more democratic, and men and women wanted something easier -- closer to sportswear yet with the thin protective skin of a uniform. ''My fashion is not unisex,'' Mr. Armani has said, ''but it does insist upon more gentleness for men, and more strength for women.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Saint Laurent and Mr. Armani have something else in common. Both invented their style. Both contrived a palette that became identifiable with them -- Mr. Saint Laurent in the rich, fantastic hues of Russia and the Orient, Mr. Armani in the earth tones of Italy and the desert. And it's almost impossible to find references to other designers or eras in their clothes. True, both men have plumbed the work of artists like Picasso and Kandinsky for inspiration, and Mr. Armani's evening clothes often contain elements of ethnic costume, as do Mr. Saint Laurent's. But, invariably, these elements are run through a fine filter, so that what you see is an Armani look or a Saint Laurent look.</p>
        <p>It's interesting, too, that Mr. Armani and Mr. Saint Laurent, who are both in their mid-60's, do not necessarily travel to the places that inspire them. Mr. Saint Laurent spends most of his time in Paris or Marrakesh. He has around him the same circle of people he has known for years -- LouLou Klossowski, Betty Catroux and, of course, Pierre Berge, with whom he established his house in the early 60's. No new people come into that group. Though he is much less cloistered, Mr. Armani has around him, too, a small circle. He dresses a lot of celebrities, but he almost never socializes with them, and when his sister, Rosanna, recently told Vanity Fair that Mr. Armani had no friends, he didn't disagree. In fact, his reply was, ''Tell me, when do I have time to make myself friends?''</p>
        <p>Fashion, like any other creative endeavor, can be an isolating experience. And yet it takes an enormous amount of discipline, even personal sacrifice, to create a look that lasts. It is based on a belief in one's view, but also in one's own power to say it over and over again. This is Mr. Saint Laurent's triumph, and it is Mr. Armani's, too. It is striking that the curators of the Guggenheim exhibition chose to display the clothes by themes, rather than in chronological order. You can't really tell what era a jacket or a beaded tuxedo came from, and that's the achievement of a style. It's timeless.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ford's approach is entirely different -- brash, cool, agile in its postmodern mix of references. The sleek white pantsuit that opened his Saint Laurent show last Friday night was not too far from the one Bianca Jagger wore on her wedding day 30 years ago, and the models' ironed hair was an obvious nod to Ms. Catroux, and the way Mr. Saint Laurent fused her androgynous style into his own. Mr. Ford's genius is for marketing and image making, and that is not such a bad thing. But if Mr. Armani influenced a generation of copycats, Mr. Ford is doing the same, and the results may not be as good for fashion. All last week, I couldn't stop thinking of what an American business executive, who is behind the revival of Bally, had told me a few days earlier in Milan. In hoping to imitate the success of Gucci in the luxury business, he said. the key was ''to execute style with excessive conformity.''</p>
