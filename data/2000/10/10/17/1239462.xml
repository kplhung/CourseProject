      <abstract>
        <p>Thomas L Friedman Op-Ed column questions Gov George W Bush's ability to grasp complexities of foreign policy or deal with situation in Israel in light of Bush's citing Lebanon in 1982 when asked in debate to name a foreign intervention of which he approved; says failed intervention in Lebanon was direct outcome of having a president, Ronald Reagan, who was fuzzy on details, susceptible to cliches and totally dependent on advisers (M)</p>

        <p>If there has been a low point for the press following the Bush-Gore campaign, surely it has been the mass rush to judgment that because George W. Bush was able to tick off world hot spots in the last debate, he understands foreign policy enough to be president. In fact, Mr. Bush uttered a stunning howler during that debate. When asked by Jim Lehrer which of the recent U.S. interventions abroad he would approve of, Mr. Bush said he did not approve of Haiti, but he did approve of Lebanon in 1982. Oh, really? Too bad Mr. Lehrer did not have time to ask him: ''Governor Bush, what was it about Lebanon that you liked?''</p>
        <p>Was it the fact that President Reagan rushed into Lebanon out of guilt over the Sabra and Shatila massacres without any preparation and, as a result, we became another faction in the Lebanese civil war? Was it the fact that we were engaged there in intensive nation-building -- training the whole Lebanese Army -- the very nation-building you opposed in Haiti? Was it the fact that we tried to build our policy in Lebanon around exercising all that military power you want to build up again -- even shelling Syrian troops with the battleship New Jersey -- and all that power proved futile? Was it the fact that 241 U.S. servicemen were killed in their sleep as a result of that futile exercise of power? Was it the fact that your chief foreign policy adviser, George Shultz, was our secretary of state then, who negotiated a May 17, 1983, agreement for Israeli security in South Lebanon -- which was so one-sided in Israel's favor it was never implemented, blew up in our faces and resulted in Syrian domination of Lebanon? What exactly did you like about Lebanon, governor?</p>

        <p>The failed U.S. intervention in Lebanon was the direct outcome of having a president, Mr. Reagan, who was fuzzy on the details, susceptible to cliches and totally dependent on foreign policy advisers, who themselves did not understand the Middle East.</p>
        <p>President Clinton was enlisted by all the parties to this conflict to go to Sharm el-Sheik yesterday precisely because they believe he is someone who has mastered the details and understands the limits of force for resolving this issue. Critics now proclaim Camp David a mistake. Nonsense. Ehud Barak is no naive dove. He is a realist who felt he owed it to Israelis, who don't want to live forever on the barricades, to test whether Israel had a Palestinian partner for a decent peace. Mr. Clinton provided the framework for that test. The president was actually quite wary about it. He knew his customers, but he also knew America would suffer if it ran away from this problem in a region where we have so many strategic interests.</p>
        <p>The trouble was that Mr. Clinton got so much from Mr. Barak that Yasir Arafat wasn't ready to respond. First Mr. Arafat turned to the Arab regimes for help and cover, but they ran away. Then he went on a world tour to try to get help, and was told to deal with Mr. Barak. And when he couldn't summon the will for that he blew things up. It never occurred to Mr. Arafat that if he wanted more from Mr. Barak he should, Sadat-like, appeal directly to the Israeli people.</p>
        <p>The Oslo peace process has now crashed. The parties have chosen to go back to fighting over who owns which olive tree. Eventually, though, like the Serbs, a desire to be part of the world will beckon them back. But only after they all pay an awful price. When it does, maybe we will have a more honest peace process -- one in which Israel is not negotiating with one hand and still building settlements with the other, one in which Mr. Arafat is not negotiating with one hand and building hate against Israelis in Palestinian mosques and textbooks with the other, and one in which weak, autocratic Arab leaders don't try to keep their people at bay by letting them let off steam on Israel.</p>
        <p>The devil in this region -- and the solution -- is in the details. Foreign policy problems rarely come packaged in your ideal way. They always come messy, spurred as much by the fecklessness of allies as the mendacity of enemies. And they can be solved only by some combination of military might, detailed, patient diplomacy and, yes, some cautious optimism. When you approach them with superficial cliches, an unwillingness to master details and an over-reliance on military power, you end up with America in Lebanon in 1982 -- one of George W. Bush's preferred foreign policy moments. Scary.</p>
