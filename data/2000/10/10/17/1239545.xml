        <p>After days of denying that the United States destroyer Cole had been the target of a terrorist attack, Yemen's government publicly reversed its position today, denouncing the attack as ''a premeditated criminal act.''</p>
        <p>Yemeni officials said they had intensified a police sweep, questioning at least 1,500 people, including most of the work force in Aden harbor, Yemenis with past links to Islamic terrorist groups, and visitors to Yemen from neighboring Arab nations that have been havens for Islamic radicals in the past.</p>
        <p>The new Yemeni attitude was ordered by President Ali Abdullah Saleh, the former army general who seized power in a coup in north Yemen in 1976. He was for years a fervent ally of the Soviet Union and Iraq before he shifted his stance in the late 1990's to seek closer relations with the United States.</p>
        <p>In the immediate aftermath of the blast on Thursday that killed 17 sailors, 10 of whose bodies remained unrecovered this evening, Mr. Saleh had angered Washington by saying he considered the explosion to have been an ''accident'' set off by a detonation on board the guided-missile destroyer.</p>
        <p>Mr. Saleh announced his switch in a meeting in Aden with Lt. Gen. Tommy Franks, commander in chief of the United States Central Command, whose headquarters in Tampa, Fla., oversees naval operations in the Persian Gulf. United States officials said that the visit of General Franks, the highest-ranking American officer to visit here since the attack, signified Washington's sense of urgency in assuring that everything possible is done to track down those responsible.</p>
        <p>Mr. Saleh shifted as American lawmakers demanded that Yemen cooperate fully with the investigation. Representative C. W. Bill Young of Florida, the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, urged the Clinton administration today to withhold a proposed $4 million package of aid to Yemen until it is assured that the government will  assist the investigation and do noth ing to harbor terrorists. Mr. Young said he would seek to make Yemen's cooperation a condition of the foreign aid bill now before Congress.</p>
        <p>So far, American and Yemeni investigators appear to have made little progress in establishing the identities or motives of those behind the attack, which occurred when the Cole was rammed by what witnesses said was a small boat carrying two men who used the cover of a refueling operation to detonate a cargo of at least a third of a ton of high explosives against the side of the Cole as it lay moored in an inner channel of the Aden harbor. The resulting explosion was the worst terrorist attack on American forces anywhere since the 1996 truck bombing of the Khobar Towers military barracks outside Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, in which 19 were killed.</p>
        <p>SABA, Yemen's official news agency, said President Saleh had told General Franks that ''preliminary results and important evidence reached by security forces in Yemen indicate that the explosion was a premeditated criminal act.'' The statement said Mr. Saleh expressed ''his regret and strong condemnation for this shameful act, which was aimed at harming the relations of friendship and cooperation between Yemen and the United States.''</p>
        <p>The statement did not say what the ''important evidence'' referred to by Mr. Saleh was, but Yemeni officials said it did not mean that Yemen had any strong leads, despite its police sweep and what the officials described as ''several dozen'' arrests of people being held for questioning. Yemen's official position in the last year has been that Islamic terrorist organizations that the State Department once described as having ''safe haven'' in Yemen, including groups linked to Osama bin Laden, the Saudi Arabian-born millionaire who is the F.B.I.'s most-wanted terrorist suspect, have been crushed by crackdowns after previous terrorist incidents. Those included a hotel bombing in 1992 and numerous kidnappings of tourists, diplomats and others.</p>
        <p>One Yemeni official said security forces would be questioning port workers, particularly those who had access to operations of the Arab Investment, Manufacturing and Trading Company Ltd., the Yemeni-owned organization that had a Navy contract for refueling, watering and supplying Navy ships stopping in Aden. Arabs of non-Yemeni nationality from countries like Algeria, Egypt, Sudan and Jordan, that, like Yemen itself, have been favored bases for terrorist groups, would also be questioned, the official said.</p>
        <p>Within hours of Mr. Saleh's statement, United States commanders in Aden issued a statement praising the Yemenis for their cooperation, saying they were receiving ''superb support from the Yemeni government and its citizens'' as they pressed efforts to save the stricken Cole from flooding, recover bodies of the dead sailors and patch the gaping hole at the ship's waterline enough to travel back to the United States for repair.</p>
        <p>Because of delays in recovering the missing sailors' bodies, and the need for a team of more than 100 F.B.I., C.I.A. and Navy investigators to scout the Cole for evidence, the homebound trip looked at least 10 days away. Even then, the Navy has said that loading the destroyer aboard a Norwegian-owned flatbed vessel specially chartered for the purpose and piggybacking it to the United States will take 25 to 30 days, indicating that the ship's return could still be six weeks or more away.</p>
        <p>The recovery efforts continued cautiously today. Divers and steel-cutters working in the dark spaces inside the blast-shattered area of the ship were unable to reach any of the 12 crew members' bodies believed to be trapped within the tangle of steel, cables and buckled equipment that is all that was left of the ship's engine room, drive shaft and lower-deck mess halls.</p>
        <p>Although the Navy has said that it has already spotted and identified two of the bodies, and has a ''good idea'' where the other 10 are, apparently in a messhall or engineering space that was crushed when a deck head collapsed, the recovery operation has been forced to proceed with painstaking care. Navy officials were reluctant to give details of the operation, but noted in another context that one factor governing the recovery operation has been the large stockpile of missiles, shells and other ordnance that was in the ship's arsenal when the bombing occurred.</p>
        <p>The fact that the arsenal did not explode emerged today as one factor that saved the Cole from a worse disaster, one that Navy officials now concede could have sunk the ship and endangered far larger numbers of the ship's crew of 293.</p>
        <p>As it was, the damage caused by the bombing caused severe flooding that threatened to send the ship to the harbor floor in the aftermath of the attack, and again on Sunday when water pressure caused a seam in a bulkhead surrounding the ship's driveshaft to separate, causing tons of seawater to flood into compartments that had already been pumped out.</p>
        <p>The United States task force that has flown in here aboard a shuttle of military transport planes has grown to a force of several hundred. They include the F.B.I.-led investigative team, a specially trained corps of Marine anti-terrorism specialists deployed to guard against any further attacks, divers who specialize in cutting through the tangled mass of steel, explosives experts, and psychological counselors who have helped the surviving members of the Cole crew cope with the aftermath of the attack. Thirty-nine crew members were wounded in the attack, at least six of them critically.</p>
        <p>Yemeni officials, under pressure from the Americans, appointed a top official to act as coordinator with the American investigators on Sunday, but the Americans and Yemenis have so far declined to disclose the official's identity. Yemenis familiar with the workings of Mr. Saleh's government said the principal role in conducting the Yemeni investigation would almost certainly be assigned to the Political Security Organization, Yemen's shadowy secret police, which has a reputation for ruthless efficiency and for mistreating those it seizes for interrogation.</p>
        <p>In recent years, numerous human rights reports on Yemen, including those issued annually by the State Department, have singled out the Political Security Organization for criticism. While American anti-terrorism specialists say it has played a valuable role in cracking down on Islamic terrorist groups, and thus in helping Yemen improve its relations with the United States and other Western countries, the human rights dossiers have described an organization that has tortured, and even caused to disappear, political detainees as well as terrorist suspects.</p>
        <p>Aboard the Cole, conditions appeared to be slowly improving for the men and women working to stabilize the ship, recover the bodies and gather forensic evidence. Rear Adm. Mark Fitzgerald, commander of the task force of several hundred Americans who have flown in here aboard a continuous shuttle of military transports since the bombing, said repair teams succeeded today in restoring electrical power and running water to the ship.</p>
        <p>Parts of the destroyer now have air-conditioning for the first time since the blast, a relief for crew members who have had to work in blazing 100-degree heat. On Sunday, after the arrival off Aden of three  Navy ships deployed to assist in the recovery operations, the Cole began rotating its crew to sleeping quarters on the other ships, and replacing them during their furloughs away from the Cole with substitute crew members from the other vessels.</p>
