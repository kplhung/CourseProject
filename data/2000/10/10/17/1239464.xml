        <p>Demanding higher wages and reduced work hours, a recently formed pilots' union at South Korea's flagship airline began voting today on whether to strike. If a majority of the pilots at Korean Air support a strike at the end of voting on Friday, the 1,330-member union plans to walk off their jobs beginning Sunday, the union said in a statement. The strike threat is the first for the labor union since its formation in August of last year after a protracted confrontation with the airline's management. The union said major complaints are the higher salaries given to foreign pilots and the long work hours. Currently, Korean Air pilots work 80 hours a month, compared with the international standard of 75 hours. Foreign pilots receive double the salary.</p>
