        <p>Stepping up his battle with Schools Chancellor Harold O.

        <p>Stepping up his battle with Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy, the state education commissioner yesterday sharply criticized the system New York City uses to recruit teachers, calling it ''disorganized'' and suggesting that the city was not working hard enough to match applicants with jobs.</p>
        <p>The commissioner, Richard P. Mills, made his comments in response to a letter from Mr. Levy in which the chancellor complained that a new state policy was deterring certified teachers from taking jobs in New York City. The policy, and a recent court order enforcing it, seek to ensure that vacancies in the city's lowest-performing schools are filled by certified teachers only.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levy said in his letter that more than 1,200 certified teachers had turned down job offers this fall because the court order would have forced them to work in low-performing schools. In a written response yesterday, Mr. Mills said that the board's hiring system was to blame and that Mr. Levy had misinterpreted the order.</p>
        <p>''There was no reason to send these people away,'' Mr. Mills wrote of the certified teachers who Mr. Levy said abandoned the application process after learning they would be assigned to failing schools. ''This is an indication of a disorganized recruitment and placement system.''</p>
        <p>The mounting tensions between the two men center on an Aug. 25 court order giving Mr. Levy instructions for complying with the state's hiring policy for low-performing schools. The order required New York City to fill every vacancy in low-performing elementary schools with a certified teacher by Sept. 7, the first day of school.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levy's interpretation of the order was that after Sept. 7, he could hire uncertified teachers to work in low-performing middle and high schools, but that vacancies in low-performing elementary schools still had to be filled with certified ones.</p>
        <p>Because of that restriction, he wrote Mr. Mills, vacancies that arise in regular elementary schools cannot be filled with certified teachers unless not a single vacancy exists in a low-performing elementary school.</p>
        <p>In response, Mr. Mills wrote that Mr. Levy had ''not followed the plain words of the order.'' Many of the 1,200 teachers said to have turned down jobs could have been hired after Sept. 7, he wrote.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levy said last night that after reading Mr. Mills's letter, he had decided to loosen hiring restrictions for the lowest-performing schools, starting tomorrow. He said he took the letter to mean that after Sept. 7, the city was free to hire certified teachers anywhere in the system.</p>
        <p>''If I've got it wrong, then he'll tell me tomorrow,'' Mr. Levy said. ''If not, then this represents significant progress.''</p>
        <p>Other state and city education officials complained yesterday that Mr. Mills and Mr. Levy were spending too much time arguing over the semantics of the order, to the detriment of the public schools.</p>
        <p>''Very regrettably, I think what's going on here is that things have gotten very personal,'' said Randi Weingarten, president of the city teachers' union. ''Here are two people fighting with each other about the language of a court order instead of dealing with the larger problem of how to recruit teachers at a time of a terrible shortage.''</p>
