        <p>Nets shooting guard Kendall Gill, playing a position already thinned by injury, suffered a corneal abrasion in his left eye during Saturday's preseason loss to the Miami Heat. He is listed as day to day but likely will miss tonight's preseason game in Orlando. Center Jim McIlvaine is questionable with a strained groin in that same game. But forward Keith Van Horn returned to practice after missing six days and two preseason games because of strained ligaments in his left knee. He is expected to play tonight.</p>
