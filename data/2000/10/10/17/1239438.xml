        <p>No one would accuse Steve Martin of not being self-aware.</p>
        <p>''There's nothing more embarrassing than being a celebrity novelist,'' Mr. Martin said. ''You just don't want to hear that an actor has written a novel. It really smells.''</p>
        <p>Having just finished his first novel -- well, a novella -- he actually did look a little embarrassed, but he wasn't being defensive.</p>
        <p>Anyone who is aware of the consistently ambitious turns in his career knows he has long since wandered off the main drag of Hollywood celebrity. A comedian turned movie star turned screenwriter (''Roxanne,'' ''L.A. Story'' and ''Bowfinger,'' among others) turned comic miniaturist and playwright (''Picasso at the Lapin Agile''), he has a long history of switching creative gears and facing the critical music. And now, thus experienced, he has an appealing sense of himself as a fledgling fiction writer, someone who acknowledges an awkwardness with the tools of a new trade but who has gained the right to practice with them.</p>
        <p>''Do I feel like an impostor?'' he said. ''No, I really don't. I feel like I've earned my little place.''</p>
        <p>Tall, with a casually elegant carriage, famously white hair and a composed, slightly craggy mien, Mr. Martin, 55, is, unlike most novelists, instantly recognizable.</p>
        <p>The new book, ''Shopgirl,'' published by Hyperion, had just arrived at the Madison Avenue Bookshop on the Upper East Side of Manhattan when Mr. Martin strolled in after an interview over lunch around the corner. For the short walk, he'd put on a baseball cap and pulled it low over his forehead, but he still drew sidelong glances.</p>
        <p>As he signed books he was at ease, speaking with an earnest, mildly self-deprecating naivete. Not only unused to writing novels, he said he was also unused to talking about writing novels, and he paid attention to what he was saying, curious, apparently, about what would come out of his mouth. ''I didn't study writing,'' he said. ''I'm not even sure what studying writing would be.'' (At Long Beach State College in California in the 1960's, he was a philosophy student.) His serious literary aspirations were born, he said, 10 years ago, when he branched out from screenplays -- ''It's not a literary form; it isn't complete until it's made into a movie'' -- to stage plays and essays.</p>
        <p>''It was time,'' he said, ''to focus on a more narrow range of interest. I talk to my friend Marty Short about this conscious withdrawal from competing in the Hollywood world. It would be embarrassing if we didn't. I know a little bit more about myself now, enough to write. I know now that other people exist.''</p>
        <p>Still, he said, writing prose, and particularly prose fiction, presented  rudimentary problems.</p>
        <p>''When you get into the area of tense, grammar, you feel pretty overwhelmed,'' he said, ''so when someone says, as an editor, ''This isn't making sense,'' it takes you five days to understand why.''</p>
        <p>A little of that, he said, results from coming to serious writing late in the game. ''But it's also about going from the stage'' -- and the screen as well, presumably -- ''where the lines are spoken, to the novel, where the line is written. There's a lot you can get away with in the spoken line that you can't get away with on the page.''</p>
        <p>The new book is not what you would expect from a wacky comedian whose signature bits involve an arrow through his head or a magic act performed by a penis. It's funny only in an oblique fashion, with the arch skew of an observer of manners, unlike the Woody Allenish absurdist satire that characterizes the small comic essays from his first book, ''Pure Drivel,'' and that surfaces in ''Picasso,'' which imagines an encounter of the great painter, Albert Einstein and a visitor from the future, Elvis Presley.</p>
        <p>Nor is it the typically autobiographical fare of a first-time novelist. It's not about show business, and the protagonist isn't a middle-aged man. The title character is Mirabelle, a shy young woman prone to depression who works in the glove department at Neiman Marcus. ''Shopgirl'' is, oddly enough, a coming-of-age novel; Mirabelle grows to emotional maturity through a failed affair with an older man, a traveling businessman named Ray Porter, who introduces himself to her by posing as a customer, purchasing a pair of expensive gloves and then sending them to her later with a request for a date. At the end, he remains lost; Mirabelle doesn't.</p>
        <p>''It's really a story about inadvertent harm done,'' Mr. Martin said, ''although I believe each of them is ultimately enriched by what happens.''</p>
        <p>Mirabelle's and Ray's confused hearts are exposed by a narrator whose omniscience is willfully shrewd and judgmental.</p>
        <p>''I made a decision early on not to use a lot of dialogue in this book,'' Mr. Martin said. ''It's almost like an emotional reporting. Dialogue is the events, but it's not what's really going on, and the book is written about what's really going on. Everything in life has a subtext.</p>
        <p>''That person over there? He's doing one thing, thinking something else. Life is never false, and acting can be. Any person who comes in here as a customer is not phony, whereas if a guy came in posing as a customer, there might be something phony about it, and the reason it's phony is the subtext if he's really thinking: 'How am I doing? Do they like me?' And that's what 'Shopgirl' is written in, the subtext.''</p>
        <p>The characters, Mr. Martin said, ''are rooted in reality, pastiched from several people I've met in my life.'' But it's difficult not to locate the author in both Mirabelle and Ray.</p>
        <p>Mr. Martin, who was divorced several years ago from the actress Victoria Tennant, said he had never sent anyone gloves, but he acknowledged having gone through a phase of dating young women -- ''I've been cured,'' he said -- and the rootless emotional life of Ray Porter is consistent with a self-exploration after the fact. Why he chose to focus on a young woman, he said, ''is a tough question to answer.''</p>
        <p>''I'm drawn to the introvert,'' he said, ''that figure of loneliness in a big city.'' Told that there was an element of male rescue fantasy in the novel's circumstance, he grimaced.</p>
        <p>''I'm not sure if rescue is right,'' he said. ''But there's a kind of vulnerability. You know, when you're walking around a foreign city, and you see a girl all by herself, kind of walking slowly, swinging her purse, and you just know that she's available, somehow open to coffee, tea, a walk through the museum. And it's really interesting for the male to approach someone like that as a blank unknown.''</p>
        <p>As for Mirabelle herself, she is an artist by nearly secret inclination, sincere and confident in practice but, perhaps like a novelist in Hollywood, a bit cowed by the idea that she feels equally out of place in the everyday world she inhabits and the world she aspires to.</p>
        <p>It's perhaps inevitable that the novel will wind up on screen.</p>
        <p>''Movie people are sniffing around,'' Mr. Martin said, in a neat and inadvertent bit of rhetorical distancing; he's not convinced it would make a good film, anyway, though he added that Winona Ryder or Chloe Sevigny would be great as Mirabelle.</p>
        <p>Would he write the screenplay?</p>
        <p>''I don't think so, I'd rather not, but I'll probably end up doing it. It would feel rather odd to take your baby and go: 'Exterior. Neiman's. Day.' I do think it would make an effective play. It moves slowly, which a play can do.''</p>
        <p>But maybe it shouldn't be a play, either.</p>
        <p>''The goal is to be small but perfect,'' Mr. Martin said. ''Now, I think of a little comedy routine like 'Flydini' '' -- the magician penis -- ''as that. By the way, these are things that should never be shared because it sounds ridiculous, but I view 'Shopgirl' that way. Well, I don't mean it's perfect, but it's a small, narrow thing that's self-contained.''</p>
        <p>There's something unusual, for a Hollywood guy, in such uncertainty about the rightness of things. It has the ring of subtext.</p>
        <p>''I think the best reaction I could get from this book is just a little respect,'' he said. ''I mean, not that I don't have respect.''</p>
        <p>He chuckled. ''I mean, just a little more.''</p>
