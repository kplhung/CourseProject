        <p>The Inuit people of Canada live on the far northern tundra and ice, 500 miles from any significant source of pollution, yet studies have shown that somehow they carry in their bodies twice the amount of the pollutant dioxin as Canadians living near areas where it is produced.</p>
        <p>Now, a group of researchers at Queens College in New York report that they can say how that dioxin gets into the Inuit. Using computer models, they simulated the movement of dioxin over the course of a year, from 44,091 sources that produce it to the Nunavut territory of the Inuit in the Arctic Circle.</p>
        <p>The study, carried out by Dr. Barry Commoner and his colleagues at the Center for the Biology of Natural Systems, suggested a link between specific factories and incinerators in the United States, Canada and Mexico and the dioxin deposited in the Inuit territory. The work was sponsored by the Commission for Environmental Cooperation that was established by the North American Free Trade Agreement.</p>
        <p>''It is a precedent-setting kind of study,'' said Edward C. Hopkins, director of environmental quality programs for the Sierra Club.</p>
        <p>The study found that of all the dioxin sources, only a handful produced most of the pollutant. And it was not the ones nearest Nunavut that contributed the most pollution. Instead, weather patterns and other factors were found to be more important than proximity in determining which sources were the regular contributors.</p>
        <p>Dioxin is the name for closely related chemicals produced in burning, chiefly the incineration of waste. Its health effects are in dispute. In high doses, it is very toxic, causing a severe skin disease called chloracne. In animal tests it causes cancer. But it is unclear what effects low doses have on human health, and it is low doses that most people receive. Scientists say that the amount of dioxin produced in the United States is now declining steadily because of tougher federal regulations.</p>
        <p>To model the spread of dioxin, the researchers used government computer programs designed to simulate the spread of radiation in the event of a nuclear accident. They fed in federal data about each source of dioxin, weather information and details  about factors like the chemical reactions that happen to dioxin in the air.</p>
        <p>Then they tracked streams of dioxin, hour by hour, for a year.</p>
        <p>The researchers concluded that only 19 of the 44,000 sources accounted for more than a third of the dioxin in Nunavut. And only about 600 sources accounted for more than 75 percent of the dioxin. The major polluters were those that were at locations having the most favorable weather patterns for quickly transporting the pollutant north and included sources in Iowa, Pennsylvania and California.</p>
        <p>The report described the path from incinerators to the human diet this way: Dioxin released from a smokestack moves with the weather, depositing a light dusting as it travels. Humans don't take it in by breathing, but rather by eating.</p>
        <p>Sometimes, it is deposited on grass, where cows take it up during grazing and their bodies absorb it into the fat cells, where it gradually accumulates. The dioxin then makes its way into meat and milk.</p>
        <p>At other times, when the dioxin falls on water, it is picked up by algae, which in turn are consumed by crustaceans and fish, and then by the marine mammals that eat them.</p>
        <p>In Nunavut, it is the caribou that eat lichens and the seals that eat fish that are the bridge from airborne dioxin to the Inuit table. The Inuit eat both caribou and seal, and because their traditional diet is heavy with animal fats -- the repositories of dioxin -- they find themselves with unusually high amounts of dioxin in their bodies.</p>
        <p>Sheila Watt-Cloutier, an Inuit woman who spoke at a recent news conference in New York about the report, pointed out enthusiastically that it gives names and faces to those who produce the dioxin that ends up in the north. (All 44,000 incinerators and factories are listed.) ''So we can even call them up, visit them, to talk about what we are worried about,'' Ms. Watt-Cloutier said.</p>
        <p>Representatives from some of the institutions named as dioxin sources said that the report was alarmist and that it raised fears needlessly. Among them was Daniel R. Lispi, who as an assistant to the mayor of Harrisburg, Pa., oversees environmental matters at the municipal incinerator there.</p>
        <p>The study, Mr. Lispi said, ''names names, and is implying that these named facilities are causing health problems from dioxin for the people in the Arctic. That is very misleading.''</p>
        <p>He said he believed Harrisburg's waste incinerator was producing less dioxin than estimated in the study.</p>
        <p>Dr. Commoner, a pioneer of the environmental movement and a onetime presidential candidate, said the numbers were as accurate as could be found at the time the work was done. He said it was important to name sources because identifying them could bring about change.</p>
        <p>Because dioxin gets into humans from milk fat, for example, it is important to know where dairy farms get their dioxin. If that is known, the sources can be linked to the sites where the pollutants enter the human diet. Such knowledge, he said, could allow more precise rules.</p>
