        <p>On television in Tampa, the Democrats are starting to aim poison-tipped arrows at Gov. George W. Bush. ''Two million more pounds of toxic chemicals dumped into Texas waterways,'' the commercial's voice-over intones, adding, ''Now imagine Bush's Texas record in Florida's Everglades.''</p>
        <p>On stations in Columbus, Ohio, meanwhile, Republicans are warning that Vice President Al Gore is a profligate caretaker of America's budget surpluses. ''Al Gore plans to spend it all and more,'' the announcer declares. ''Gore's big-government spending plan threatens American prosperity.''</p>
        <p>It is axiomatic in political life that a close campaign in the fall leads to a mean season on the screen. And while the presidential race remains, in a marketing sense, one of the more polite in memory, the tone of new advertising in the last week has been noticeably more confrontational, on issues if not personalties, as strategists home in on states they believe are up for grabs -- or at least want the other side to think they consider winnable.</p>
        <p>The cash outlays, too, are intensifying. In just the last week of September and the first week of October, the campaigns, the parties and outside groups spent a total of $18.5 million on television, evenly split between the parties. The bulk of it, $14.5 million, was spent in six highly contested states: Florida, Michigan, Missouri, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, according to the latest figures available, a report by the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law.</p>
        <p>Expanding beyond the 17 states that have been the focus of the media campaign for months, Republicans are now also spending television money in California, Minnesota and West Virginia, states that have been thought of as long shots for Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>The Democratic Party, with much smaller cash reserves, is less concerned with expansion than with refining its strategy, fashioning television and radio attack advertisements for specific states and specific issues: the Everglades piece in Florida, for example; a pollution spot directed at voters in Washington State; an advertisement about the minimum wage in West Virginia; and a radio spot about children in Iowa asserting that ''George Bush's priorities are wrong for Iowa's kids.''</p>
        <p>Overall, said Ken Goldstein, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin, who studies political advertising, the latest data suggest that the campaigns are concentrating more on some states in the Northwest and upper Midwest that have gone to the Democrats in recent presidential elections. At this late stage, analysts say, candidates certainly do not want to have to devote resources in their customary strongholds.</p>
        <p>''The movement seems to be into states Gore needs to win,'' Mr. Goldstein said. ''In Mr. Gore's favor, he still hasn't had to spend money in California and he's competitive in Florida. But he's spending money in Oregon, Washington, Wisconsin and Iowa, which should all be pretty safe for him if he's going to win this.''</p>
        <p>In recent weeks, Mr. Gore has been outspending Mr. Bush in Michigan and Pennsylvania, while Mr. Bush has poured new millions into Florida.</p>
        <p>The Bush and Gore advertising campaigns, waged in tandem with their national party organizations, have been so tactically selective that they are in essence regional rather than national efforts. In his most recent analysis of the data compiled by Campaign Media Analysis Group, a company that tracks advertising spending, Mr. Goldstein found that virtually no presidential spots have run in 32 of the top 75 media markets.</p>
        <p>Other markets are being inundated: Philadelphia is now the No. 1 city in the nation for political commercials, Mr. Goldstein said; since June 1, presidential spots have run on the airwaves there 6,078 times. The other markets in the top 10 are Seattle; Cleveland; Detroit; Albuquerque; St. Louis; Portland, Ore.; Kansas City, Mo.; Green Bay, Wis.; and Grand Rapids, Mich.</p>
        <p>By contrast, Mr. Goldstein said, the nation's largest media market, New York, has had no more than five or six advertisements.</p>
        <p>The careful carving out of battleground markets has led to the television equivalent of hand-to-hand combat. In Tampa, for example, the Everglades spot by the Democrats forced the Republicans to quickly put a response on the local airwaves.</p>
        <p>''We upped our buy in the Tampa media, to re-air a spot concerning Gore's record on the environment,'' explained Terry Holt, a spokesman for Victory 2000, the campaign arm of the Republican National Committee. The spot, unveiled in August, depicts an aerial photograph of land owned by Mr. Gore in Tennessee and includes the claim that Mr. Gore ''has allowed mining companies to mine zinc from his property.''</p>
        <p>Both sides are, for the moment,  steering clear of the kinds of video disparagements of personality that voters profess to abhor. Patterned after the Republican assaults on the governorships of Michael S. Dukakis in the 1988 campaign and Bill Clinton in 1992, the Democrats are hitting hard on Mr. Bush's Texas record.</p>
        <p>''After 17 years in the oil business, George W. Bush ran for governor,'' says a new Democratic commercial running in Missouri, Washington, Oregon and Michigan, ''then passed laws to let big polluters regulate themselves.''</p>
        <p>In a television spot directed at Iowa voters, an announcer warns of dire consequences for Iowa's schoolchildren: ''Under Bush, Texas SAT scores have fallen to 47th, while Iowa ranks second. Iowa doesn't need a Texas plan for our schools.''</p>
        <p>In earlier spots, the Republicans took swipes at Mr. Gore's reputation for exaggerating his accomplishments. Now they have shifted to a critical analysis of the candidates' budget plans. ''Al Gore's plan: three times the new spending President Clinton proposed, so much it wipes out the entire surplus and creates a deficit again,'' says a new advertisement running in the battleground states.</p>
        <p>And in a ubiquitous new commercial by the Bush campaign, Mr. Bush stares squarely into the camera and observes: ''I believe in government that is responsible to the people. That's the difference in philosophy between my opponent and me. He trusts government. I trust you.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Holt said: ''Our advertising at this stage is fairly straightforward in states where we've had ads up for some time. We've moved from health care and education to economic plans and whose is better.''</p>
        <p>The Brennan Center study showed that as of Oct. 8, the Bush campaign and the Republican Party had spent $47 million on television in the general election, while the Gore campaign and the Democratic Party had spent $42 million.</p>
        <p>However, some $5 million that has been spent on behalf of Mr. Gore by outside groups like the Sierra Club, Handgun Control and Planned Parenthood has brought the two sides to temporary parity. In fact, the study found in the two weeks that ended on Oct. 8, Planned Parenthood's expenditure of $1.46 million actually exceeded the amount paid out for commercials by the Democratic National Committee. Groups allied with the Republicans, like the National Rife Association, have only just begun advertising.</p>
        <p>The presidential candidates, their parties and surrogates are expected to spend $160 million, but could lay out as much as $200 million for commercials by Election Day. Still, the Republicans have a vast financial advantage in the final weeks. Fund-raising reports showed that as of the end of September the Republicans had $45 million in cash, while the Democrats had $26 million, much of that unrestricted donations from corporations and wealthy individuals. (By law, the parties can pay a only a part of their advertising costs with that so-called soft money.)</p>
        <p>Up to now the Democratic National Committee has been slightly outspending its Republican counterpart, Mr. Goldstein said. But that is about to change.</p>
        <p>''With $20 million to $25 million to put on television in the last month of the campaign, and $40 million to $50 million committed already, we feel we're in a pretty good position,'' Mr. Holt said. He added that despite Mr. Gore's lead in California, the party had decided to make an investment in the nation's most expensive media state. ''We added $1 million per week to our campaign there on Tuesday, with 90 percent of that money going into the Los Angeles TV market, where 40 percent of the voters reside,'' Mr. Holt said.</p>
        <p>Joe Andrew, national chairman of the Democratic National Committee, replied, ''That's great. I would hope they would spend more money in California. Some of that is just literally psychological warfare.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Andrew asserted that the strategy of challenging Mr. Bush's Texas record in a handful of states was not a function of limited resources, but the long-planned final phase of an effort to ''make the issue landscape our home turf.''</p>
        <p>On both sides, issues do turn out to be what the advertising campaigns this year are about. William Benoit, a professor of communication at the University of Missouri-Columbia, who studies the negative and positive messages in political commercials, said that there has been a decline in attacks this year in the presidential spots and an increased emphasis on differences in policy rather than in character.</p>
        <p>''The 2000 campaign so far is more positive than 1996 was,'' said Mr. Benoit, who analyzed the statements in 61 commercials that have run  through Saturday. He found that while the number of statements in the spots attacking the opposing side have been rising in recent weeks, the level of vitriol remains relatively mild. About 29 percent of the statements in Mr. Gore's spots and 17 percent in Mr. Bush's could be interpreted as attacks, Mr. Benoit said.</p>
        <p>While attacks have been more plentiful in candidate spots by the Democratic and Republican Parties, Mr. Benoit said they have overwhelmingly concentrated on the opponents' stands on the issues, an area that polls show most voters view as fair game.</p>
        <p>''These ads strike me as more comparative, and actually based on the record and not based on personalities,'' said Lynn Vavreck, a Dartmouth College political scientist who analyzes campaign advertising. ''This is not a Willie Horton year, although with the election so tight, the conditions are certainly ripe for Willie Horton to make a comeback.''</p>
