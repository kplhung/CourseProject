        <p>SIX years ago, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman was instrumental in derailing stricter accounting rules on stock options. And with businesses facing new accounting rules on acquisitions that could hurt their bottom line, Senator Lieberman, now the Democratic vice presidential candidate, joined 12 other senators earlier this year in pushing for a delay of the new rules.</p>
        <p>The musings of the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the private-sector body based in Norwalk, Conn., that sets the nation's accounting standards, are rarely of interest to the movers and shakers in Washington -- except when influential executives start complaining. Investors clearly do not have friends in such high places.</p>
        <p>The board is considering the elimination of a popular accounting technique that allows companies to avoid good-will charges that reduce reported profits. The technique, known as pooling of interests, is frequently used by large technology companies, which argue that the elimination of this method would hurt their ability to make acquisitions that fuel their growth. But the technique has also been criticized for not giving investors information about these acquisitions.</p>
        <p>Concerned about the effect of new rules, Mr. Lieberman joined 12 other senators in writing a letter in late September to the accounting board. ''As United States senators concerned about the continued innovation and growth of the U.S. technology sector, we urge F.A.S.B. to postpone any final decision regarding the pooling accounting method until the various alternatives to improve financial reporting have been fully considered,'' the senators wrote.</p>
        <p>Although the board had already said it would delay its decision until early next year, the senators asked the board for ''assurance that F.A.S.B. will take no conclusive action on its current project on business combinations until Congress has reconvened in 2001 and had the opportunity to review the economic impact of F.A.S.B.'s plans at that time.''</p>
        <p>These senators are not the only ones getting into the act. Two California representatives, Christopher Cox, a Republican, and Cal Dooley, a Democrat, introduced a bill this month that would allow companies to use pooling for a year while there is further study of the issue.</p>
        <p>Washington's rush to protect the high-technology industry has met with criticism from those who believe the work of the accounting board should remain out of the political fray. The current efforts by Congress represent ''blatant government intervention in the private sector to serve the selfish interests of the technology industries,'' argued Jack T. Ciesielski, an analyst in Baltimore who specializes in accounting issues. What concerns him is the possibility that the board's decisions will become more about politics than good accounting. Whenever the board tackles a controversial accounting issue, ''companies are going to go to Congress,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The last political victory took place six years ago, on the accounting board's proposed rule on stock options. Mr. Lieberman is credited with derailing the board's plans to require companies to expense the value of stock options by proposing legislation that would have virtually put the accounting board out of business.</p>
        <p>The board eventually backed down, choosing instead to require companies to disclose more information about the options they were handing out. ''The board elected to come up with a second-best answer in order to live to fight another day,'' said Dennis R. Beresford, an accounting professor at the University of Georgia who was then chairman of the accounting board.</p>
        <p>But businesses were emboldened by their success and are now quick to lobby politicians when they are faced with accounting standards they dislike, said Edmund L. Jenkins, its current chairman. Businesses, he said, ''are using the political process to try to achieve their desires;I think that is unfortunate.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Jenkins is opposed to the proposed legislation to retain pooling for a year. While the bill does not call for a specific solution, the enforced delay in rules that would provide investors with better information ''is interfering with the private-sector standard-setting process,'' he argued.</p>
        <p>He is now in the position of trying to persuade Congress that the accounting board is doing nothing in haste. Noting that the board has been reviewing merger accounting for four years and has held dozens of public meetings, as well as four days of public hearings, Mr. Jenkins wrote the senators recently that ''we are certainly not rushing to any final conclusions.''</p>
        <p>And four representatives, all of them accountants, including E. Clay Shaw Jr., a Florida Republican, and Brad Sherman, a California Democrat, have also come out against the proposed legislation. ''It is critical that accounting standard setting remains insulated from the influence of special interest groups and politics to ensure that accounting standards, and the resulting financial reporting, continue to provide investors with an unbiased and informative picture of a company's activities,'' the four wrote in a letter to their colleagues.</p>
        <p>Unlike the stock-option debate, where business opposition to the new rules was nearly universal, opinion is much more divided about merger accounting. What is more, the board is considering rules that in some cases would allow companies to avoid expensing good will, which would address the major concern over the elimination of pooling.</p>
        <p>As for Mr. Lieberman, he is unlikely to push for legislation in the case of merger accounting, said Dan Gerstein, a spokesman for the senator. The senator's decision to propose legislation as a way of blocking new rules concerning stock options was a ''last resort,'' Mr. Gerstein explained, because the rule would have had such dire consequences for the economy -- at least if one listened to the rule's critics.</p>
        <p>The real question is whether Mr. Lieberman and others will allow the accounting board to come to its own conclusions next year -- far away from this year's elections and from Washington.</p>
