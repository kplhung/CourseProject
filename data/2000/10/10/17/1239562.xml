        <p>In an exchange fueled entirely by questions from voters, Representative Bob Franks, the Republican candidate for Senate, and his Democratic rival, Jon S. Corzine, slalomed through an eclectic array of issues that included the growing menace of Canada geese, burdensome tolls on the New Jersey Turnpike and potential terrorist attacks in the state.</p>
        <p>The hourlong forum, broadcast tonight on WKXW-FM, a talk radio station known as New Jersey 101.5, featured a wide range of questions relayed by telephone and e-mail, many highlighting local concerns, among them traffic congestion, high taxes and a paucity of mass transit.</p>
        <p>As with the three previous debates, each candidate used every possible occasion to criticize the other, although the opportunities to do so were limited by the quirky nature of the questions. Mr. Franks, a four-term congressman, continued to attack Mr. Corzine for his spending habits, suggesting that he has an unfair monetary advantage and no qualifications for the Senate.</p>
        <p>''I've worked with you to make New Jersey a better place to work and live,'' he said in his opening statement, his tone edged with derision. ''Mr. Corzine, on the other hand, has no record and he has no experience. He is, quite frankly, trying to buy your vote.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine tried to portray his lack of political experience as an asset, his years as co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company a boon to those weary of career politicians. ''These experiences give me a practical perspective on addressing New Jersey's challenges,'' he said. As in past debates, Mr. Corzine suggested that Mr. Franks was a friend to the rich and the conservative, a right-leaning Republican out of sync with mainstream New Jersey voters.</p>
        <p>On many issues, however, the two men were largely in agreement, including mandatory sentences for drug dealing, unwavering support for Israel and the need to reduce truck traffic on state roadways.</p>
        <p>Still, their differences were also made apparent, especially on taxes, abortion and prescription drug subsidies for the elderly.</p>
        <p>In response to a caller, Mr. Corzine declared his opposition to the Boy Scouts' discriminatory policy against gays. Mr. Franks, by contrast, was more accommodating, saying that a private organization should be allowed to do as it pleases.</p>
        <p>On gun control, Mr. Franks said he would support a federal ban on assault weapons but would defend the constitutional right to bear arms. Mr. Corzine called for tighter restrictions on guns.</p>
        <p>During much of the exchange, the candidates found themselves talking about local issues largely absent from the previous three debates. There was an e-mail message from an unidentified woman furious about the flocks of Canada geese that have invaded a park she frequents.</p>
        <p>Calling them ''foul creatures,'' she asked whether the candidates would support legislation allowing them to be hunted. Although neither candidate directly advocated a hunt, each seemed to have personal experience with the animals, which have overtaken parks near their own homes. ''We need to find a better way to keep the geese moving and keep them away from locations that are public hazards,'' Mr. Corzine said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Franks was somewhat more forceful on the matter: ''It's now a human health hazard,'' he said. ''We simply have to better control the population of Canada geese because they are compromising our quality of life.''</p>
        <p>With Election Day just three weeks away, Mr. Franks may have good reason to be on the defensive. He has been far outspent by his Democratic opponent, and a new poll by Gannett's New Jersey newspapers suggests that he is trailing Mr. Corzine by more than 10 percentage  points.</p>
        <p>The poll, conducted by telephone last Thursday through Saturday, indicated that Mr. Corzine was leading Mr. Franks 43 percent to 30 percent among New Jersey voters. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.2 percentage points.</p>
        <p>Despite Mr. Corzine's comfortable lead, Republican officials said they were encouraged by the large number of undecideds, nearly a quarter of the vote.</p>
