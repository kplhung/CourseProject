        <p>The somehow cheerful drawing on the curtain -- a headless man reclining comfortably on a pedestal -- that greets theatergoers at ''The Gorey Details'' sends just the right message about the performance that is about to begin.</p>
        <p>The show is a musical anthology of stories by the writer and artist Edward Gorey, many of them reprised from previous like shows, and the drawing (one of his own, of course) welcomes you into the genially macabre universe that Gorey (who died this year) made familiar in more than 100 books. Amusing and pleasant, especially for nostalgic devotees, the show is also, well, headless, roaming whimsically around in the Gorey oeuvre until, alas, the inevitable happens and the body stops twitching.</p>

        <p>The somehow cheerful drawing on the curtain -- a headless man reclining comfortably on a pedestal -- that greets theatergoers at ''The Gorey Details'' sends just the right message about the performance that is about to begin.</p>
        <p>The show is a musical anthology of stories by the writer and artist Edward Gorey, many of them reprised from previous like shows, and the drawing (one of his own, of course) welcomes you into the genially macabre universe that Gorey (who died this year) made familiar in more than 100 books. Amusing and pleasant, especially for nostalgic devotees, the show is also, well, headless, roaming whimsically around in the Gorey oeuvre until, alas, the inevitable happens and the body stops twitching.</p>
        <p>The show, which opened yesterday at the Century Center for the Performing Arts, is both directed (by Daniel Levans) and performed with the fervor of happy cultists thoroughly immersed in an alternative world, and its strength is a winking conviction that Gorey's imagination had a palpable foundation.</p>
        <p>Singing on roller skates, dancing as if possessed by a childish eccentricity, speaking in an exotic language they and they only share, the nine actors are all persuasively in the thrall of Goreyana, willfully and casually weird. And the music, by Peter Matz, played by three musicians (piano, cello and percussion), is appropriately jingly in a Halloween mode.</p>
        <p>The frame for the evening is provided by a narrator, in the form of a lanky, bald, mustached and rather charmingly eccentric actor named Kevin McDermott, who assumes the role of Gorey's anagrammatical alter ego, Ogdred Weary. Entering on a bicycle, reciting favorite words from the Gorey lexicon (''Haiku, Glue, Seppuku, Maru''), he seems to be calling up the gods of composition, and they answer him with the skits that follow.</p>
        <p>These include a paean to the nonsensical panacea known as Q.R.V. (which, among its many powers, ''clips your nose and braids your toes and stains your lingerie''); a mock-gothic tale about a lunatic opera-diva stalker; another horrific comedy about three cousins who meet peculiar, untimely deaths (one is dispatched by drinking from a contaminated vial of vanilla extract); and a satiric epic about a woman pursued throughout her life and around the globe by a spectral hippopotamus, who drives her flight with the warning, ''Fly at once; all is discovered!''</p>
        <p>Like many an omnibus show, in this one the skits are variously successful, and you'll be particularly impatient if you're the sort who waits for a punch line or a concluding moment. That isn't where Gorey's imagination flourished. Indeed, a sudden death offered with a hapless shrug is the most frequent curtain-closer in these tales -- which is, of course, the kind of philosophical resignation that informed most of his work.</p>
        <p>The humor is, rather, largely dependent on mood, the sense that in this peculiar world, with its atmosphere of a gleefully haunted house, life will go on in all its bizarre idiosyncrasy until it doesn't. Those who adhere to or at least admire the Goreyan view are likely to be satisfied by its presentation here, and it's hard, of course, to escape the poignant underscoring of the artist's death in April.</p>
        <p>The cardboard set (by Jesse Poleshuck), playfully painted in Gorey's distinctively spidery style, with a drawing of an upended cow over a drawn fireplace and a seaside view out the back windows, suggests the artist's home on Cape Cod. ''The Gorey Details,'' as a result, has the feel of a posthumous visit there, with the artist gone but his creations alive.</p>
        <p>In the end, the show is something of an animated headstone, a memorial that Gorey would doubtless have appreciated.</p>
