        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Those who think Hillary Rodham Clinton should have left Bill Clinton overlook the responsibility she has to the nation, the presidency and the continuity of an administration that has been so successful in spite of an antagonistic opposition-party majority (Op-Ed, Oct. 12).</p>
        <p>Perhaps she would have walked out instantly if his personal misbehavior had been discovered after he left office; perhaps not. But it's reasonable to assume that she felt that she owed the country her continued support of the president. And the longer the requirement to support him exists, the better chance there is that they will be able to repair the marriage.</p>
        <p>Whether that marriage will continue after he leaves office is still unknown to the public (perhaps even to the Clintons themselves). The one sure thing is that there are some who will vilify them for either choice, and others who will approve of whichever choice she makes. And surely it is up to them, the only people who will actually have to live with the decision.</p>
