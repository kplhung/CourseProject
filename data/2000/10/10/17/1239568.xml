        <p>Amgen said that it would acquire the privately held Kinetix Pharmaceuticals for $170 million in stock. Kinetix, based in Medford, Mass., has expertise in developing drugs that interfere with protein kinases, enzymes that regulate communication within cells and between cells and their environment. Amgen, the nation's largest biotechnology company, said the deal would help it develop drugs for cancer and inflammation. Moreover, Kinetix's expertise is in so-called small-molecule drugs, which usually can be taken as pills, whereas Amgen up to now has specialized in protein pharmaceuticals that must be injected. Amgen, based in Thousand Oaks, Calif., said the acquisition would result in a one-time charge of $30 million, or 3 cents a share. Separately, Amgen said data were presented at meetings in Canada and Europe showing the effectiveness of Aranesp, also known as NESP, which is a new version of the anemia drug erythropoietin that requires less frequent dosing.</p>
