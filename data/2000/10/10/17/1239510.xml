        <p>John Halama caught a red-eye flight from Seattle to New York Friday night and made it to his sister's wedding Saturday in Brooklyn. Like so many other New York natives, he had been swept up in all this talk about a Subway Series.</p>
        <p>There was no television at the wedding, but someone had brought a Walkman, and Halama made sure to get the inning-by-inning updates from the Mariners-Yankees game. His relatives seemed to understand.</p>
        <p>''My sister doesn't plan on getting married again,'' Halama said yesterday. ''I had to be there, but my heart was in Seattle.''</p>
        <p>That is not exactly a news bulletin. Halama, 28, makes his living as a left-handed starting pitcher for the Seattle Mariners. His role is to prevent a Subway Series.</p>
        <p>He had been sent ahead to rest for a possible start tonight in Game 6 of the American League Championship Series at Yankee Stadium. Halama said yesterday that he has been holed up behind enemy lines, 3,000 miles from his teammates and yet right at home.</p>
        <p>He passed up a chance to stay at a New York hotel for the comforts of his Brooklyn home. He saw his sister, Barbara, get married. He warmed up for the most important start in his baseball career by throwing in a park near his house with his brother, Steve. He watched Sunday's game at home on television, and he said that was, to use his word, ''weird.''</p>
        <p>Now the biggest game of Halama's baseball career will be played two boroughs away from where he grew up. Halama's Mariners trail the four-of-seven-game series, three games to two. Not only will Halama have to face the Yankees' best postseason pitcher, Orlando Hernandez, but he has never pitched in an elimination game before. Game 2 of the A.L.C.S. on Wednesday was the first postseason game of his major league career.</p>
        <p>''This is uncharted waters for myself,'' Halama said. ''I have to block everything out.''</p>
        <p>Halama did a good job of that in Game 2. The Mariners lost, 7-1, but the Yankees scored all their runs after he had left the game. Halama allowed only four hits and walked three batters in six innings.</p>
        <p>He is not the type of pitcher who can make a radar gun short-circuit, but Halama was particularly effective with his curveball and slider.</p>
        <p>''He is tricky with the breaking balls and changeups, and he can sneak a little fastball by you,'' Yankees Manager Joe Torre said.</p>
        <p>Halama said yesterday that he has no idea what will work for him tonight. When he is warming up in the bullpen before the game, he will see which pitches feel right and go from there. He will not necessarily use the same strategy as in Game 2, and he said he won't try to win the game by himself.</p>
        <p>''I'm not going to go out there and try to do anything more than use what I have that day,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Halama has been one of Seattle's steadiest pitchers. He won 14 games, including a Sept. 24 victory over Oakland and a Sept. 30 victory over Anaheim that helped the Mariners clinch a wild-card berth over Cleveland.</p>
        <p>''Halama has been basically there for us all year,'' Seattle Manager Lou Piniella said earlier in the series. ''He has pitched very consistently. He is more of a pitcher who needs to stay away from the center of the plate, who needs to pitch to both sides of the plate, changing speeds, those sorts of things.''</p>
        <p>At least he has his first playoff game at Yankee Stadium out of the way. He knows that his relatives will be among the small number of Mariners' fans at Yankee Stadium. He knows that Hernandez will have an easier time pitching in such a big game because he will have the crowd on his side.</p>
        <p>''There's probably not going to be a fear factor,'' Halama said. ''But there's going to be a nerve factor.''</p>
        <p>If yesterday's pregame interview was any indication, Halama seems to be much more relaxed before this start than his last. He curtly answered reporters' questions before Game 1, and at one point said that a question about where he grew up in Brooklyn was ''irrelevant.''</p>
        <p>He said he never went to Yankee Stadium as a boy, and he could recall only one trip to Shea Stadium. He did reveal that he was a Mets fan.</p>
        <p>He was asked yesterday if many people in Brooklyn had noticed him walking around his old neighborhood over the weekend. ''I didn't walk around the neighborhood,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But Halama was generally much more friendly and forthcoming. It comes with the territory, perhaps.</p>
        <p>''I'm sure tomorrow's going to be one of those games that I'm nervous,'' he said with the knowledge of someone who has been there. ''But it's going to go away once that first pitch is thrown.''</p>
