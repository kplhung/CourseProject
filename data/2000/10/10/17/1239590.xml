        <p>The European online bank  Egg said its pretax loss for the nine months ended Sept. 30 rose to $:115 million ($168 million). Operations costs increased 36 percent as the company, which is 80 percent owned by Prudential P.L.C., spent more to develop and market its products. Although Egg added 120,260 customers in the third quarter, it lost older customers with larger balances to younger customers with lower balances. Egg's shares were higher in London.</p>
