        <p>They are seen live, with no delay, except in the length of time required to complete them. Their natural flow is not interrupted by profiles or features. Yet the baseball playoffs are suffering the same fate as the Summer Olympics: stumbling ratings.</p>
        <p>The first five League Championship Series games -- two on Fox, three on NBC -- produced an average 7.5 Nielsen rating, down 25 percent from last year, which follows a 28 percent drop in their division series ratings. The Foxians are quick to note that the 7.5 rating is 32 percent better than what the National Basketball Association conference finals yielded for NBC last season. (Each rating point equals 1.02 million television households.)</p>
        <p>Since the issue of knowing the results hours in advance is not a reason to tune them out, then what is depressing the ratings?</p>
        <p>One explanation could be the start of the new fall season, which was delayed until after the end of the Olympics, pitting heavily hyped programs against baseball. This has hurt Fox more than NBC because when Fox shows baseball, NBC's arsenal has included ''E.R.,'' ''The West Wing'' and ''Ed.'' On Oct. 4, ''The West Wing'' posted a 16.3 rating against a 5.3 for a division series game on Fox.</p>
        <p>''It was pretty apparent that with the launches delayed, we weren't looking at stellar ratings,'' said David Hill, the president of the Fox Television Sports Group. ''And it became a reality, with all the extra promotional money being spent on launching prime time. We were girded for an aberration.''</p>
        <p>Intriguing as that argument is, postseason telecasts always face competition from first-run programming in prime time. Season premieres can wield substantial clout, but Fox is assigning enough power to them to account for lower ratings.</p>
        <p>Hill also said that Fox anticipated an ''Olympic hangover'' -- that is, viewers fatigued by prime-time sports were hungering for entertainment. But considering the criticism of NBC's taped Olympic strategy, one wonders if viewers were simply aching for live sports as much as they were to find out if President Bartlet had been gunned down on ''The West Wing.''</p>
        <p>The confluence of the playoffs with the presidential and vice presidential debates probably skimmed some viewers from baseball on Oct. 3, 5 and 11. Fox did not pre-empt baseball for the debates, while NBC gave its affiliates the option of doing so when it had a game. On Oct. 11, when the cumulative rating for the debate between Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas reached a 26.8 on seven broadcast and cable networks, Fox recorded a 6.8 for Game 1 of the Mets-Cardinals National League Championship Series. Four years ago, Game 6 of the N.L.C.S. on Fox generated an 11.9 rating compared with a 26.1 cumulative rating for the Bill Clinton-Bob Dole presidential debate.</p>
        <p>Once the League Championship Series games end, the World Series will belong to Fox -- as will every game of every baseball postseason until 2006. Fox must hope that ratings for the division and League Championship Series are not indicators of a slide into a Nielsen bunker.</p>
        <p>''There is no buyer's regret,'' Hill said. ''People said the same thing when we did our deal with the N.F.L. And in the third year of the new deal, we're up. Baseball in postseason is second only to the N.F.L.''</p>
        <p>Bud Selig, the baseball commissioner, is similarly not worried that he secured a cushy deal when the long term is turning murky for Fox.</p>
        <p>''I don't believe we're on a slide,'' Selig said. ''I have every confidence time will bear that out. Let's see what happens now, with the debates about to end and the season premieres over.''</p>
        <p>The most intriguing possibility for the World Series, at least for local fans, is whether it will be the first Subway Series since 1956. If the Mets and Yankees meet, would it be a ratings coup or a one-market fluke? Would a Yankees-Cardinals series have been more attractive because it would have benefited from matching two regions?</p>
        <p>If the Mets play the Yankees, their games would not produce a local rating twice that of a World Series with one New York team.</p>
        <p>During the Yankees' World Series sweep of the Atlanta Braves last year, the New York market averaged a 33.5 rating. Fox estimates that the Mets' inclusion would produce a 47.5. The extra 14 points would equate to 975,000 additional TV households and would contribute nearly a point to the national rating.</p>
        <p>One can never predict the potential excitement created by any matchup. A Yankees-Cardinals series would have featured the prospect of Mark McGwire playing as a designated hitter in Babe Ruth's house.</p>
        <p>The 1989 Oakland-San Francisco World Series -- interrupted for 12 days after Game 2 because of an earthquake -- is the only recent example of two teams from the same market playing in the fall classic.</p>
        <p>For Oakland's sweep of the Giants, the Bay Area market produced an average 38.7 rating (which would probably have been higher if not for the earthquake). That was 6 percent better than it rated for the 1988 World Series, when the Athletics played the Dodgers, and 8 percent better than in 1990, when Oakland played the Reds.</p>
        <p>Fox's hope is for the World Series to last at least five games, the magic number to break even financially.</p>
        <p>''But the great thing about a Subway Series,'' Hill said, ''is it would give New York baseball fans some confidence to help them come out of their shells.''</p>
