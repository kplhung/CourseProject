        <p>New Jersey legislative leaders have asked a former United States attorney to review 50,000 pages of newly surfaced state police documents showing that law enforcement officials were slow to respond to evidence of racial profiling during traffic stops, and may have misled lawmakers and the public about the extent of the problem.</p>

        <p>New Jersey legislative leaders have asked a former United States attorney to review 50,000 pages of newly surfaced state police documents showing that law enforcement officials were slow to respond to evidence of racial profiling during traffic stops, and may have misled lawmakers and the public about the extent of the problem.</p>
        <p>William L. Gormley, chairman of the State Senate Judiciary Committee, said today that he had asked Michael Chertoff, the former federal prosecutor, to examine the state police records as part of the Legislature's review. The records are scheduled to be released to the public later this month by the state attorney general's office.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chertoff, now a lawyer in private practice, did not return a call today seeking comment.</p>
        <p>Last week, articles in The New York Times and The Record of Hackensack described some of the documents, which indicate that state police commanders were aware of a pattern of racial profiling by many troopers as early as 1996 -- three years before the state publicly acknowledged the problem.</p>
        <p>The Legislature's review is likely to focus on the actions of Peter G. Verniero, a State Supreme Court justice who was attorney general from July 1996 to May 1999. During confirmation hearings for the judgeship in May 1999, Mr. Verniero gave sworn testimony that he knew of no solid evidence of profiling until earlier that year.</p>
        <p>But the documents indicate that state police officials conducted their own analysis of troopers' traffic stops in the fall of 1996 and found evidence of widespread profiling.</p>
        <p>Although some members of Mr. Verniero's staff were involved in defending the state police against legal challenges from minority drivers claiming that they had been stopped because of their race, none of the 11,000 documents reviewed by The Times indicate that Mr. Verniero ever saw the results of the analysis. But one memo states that Mr. Verniero participated in a January 1997 meeting at which he and state police commanders decided to restrict the data they would turn over to the Justice Department, which was then investigating complaints of racial profiling. Last year, the state agreed to take steps to prevent racial profiling and allow a federal monitor to oversee its progress.</p>
        <p>Justice Verniero has declined to discuss the issue, saying that State Supreme Court judges customarily refrain from granting news media interviews.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gormley would not comment today on the news articles, saying he did not want to ''prejudge the records before we've actually seen them.'' But he said he might eventually request that committee hearings on the matter be held, and added that he would ask for subpoena power if  potential witnesses did not respond to questions.</p>
        <p>''No one is above the law,'' said Mr. Gormley, a Republican who voted to confirm Mr. Verniero, a fellow Republican. ''No one is above being questioned.''</p>
        <p>Democrats in the Legislature, who vigorously fought Mr. Verniero's appointment to the court, were notably muted in their response to the documents and to Mr. Gormley's decision to review them.</p>
        <p>Senator John Lynch, a Democrat who led the effort to block Mr. Verniero's confirmation, did not return repeated calls for comment. But a spokesman for the Democrats, Jim Manion, called on Mr. Gormley and his fellow Republican Donald T. DiFrancesco, the Senate president, to conduct a thorough investigation.</p>
        <p>''We need a real investigation with real subpoena power, because we've been stonewalled by Peter Verniero before,'' Mr. Manion said.</p>
