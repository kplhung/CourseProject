        <p>It would be months before anyone knew whether his complicated delivery needed to be junked, or if he threw hard enough to win in the majors. But Orlando Hernandez had been with the Yankees for only a few hours before he radiated something unique, in the way he walked, the way he moved and in his mannerisms.</p>
        <p>''I can't wait to see him pitch, because that kid has got presence, I'll tell you that,'' Manager Joe Torre told Brian Cashman, the Yankees' general manager, on March 21, 1998, in Tampa, Fla.</p>

        <p>It would be months before anyone knew whether his complicated delivery needed to be junked, or if he threw hard enough to win in the majors. But Orlando Hernandez had been with the Yankees for only a few hours before he radiated something unique, in the way he walked, the way he moved and in his mannerisms.</p>
        <p>''I can't wait to see him pitch, because that kid has got presence, I'll tell you that,'' Manager Joe Torre told Brian Cashman, the Yankees' general manager, on March 21, 1998, in Tampa, Fla.</p>
        <p>Hernandez will carry that magnetism and his perfect postseason record to the mound tonight in Game 6 of the American League Championship Series at Yankee Stadium against the Seattle Mariners. The Yankees lead the four-of-seven-game series, three games to two, and need one more victory to clinch their 37th pennant and take the next step toward becoming the first team in 26 years to win three consecutive titles.</p>
        <p>Hernandez has started eight games in the postseason and made one relief appearance, and the Yankees have not lost any of those games.</p>
        <p>There is always pressure pitching in the postseason, and Hernandez feels the pressure. ''What I don't have,'' he said, ''is fear.''</p>
        <p>His teammates sense that. They trust that part of him, that he will pitch tonight as if he believes there is no possible way he can lose.</p>
        <p>Chris Turner, the backup catcher, is in his first year with the Yankees and saw Hernandez struggle through what was, by and large, a mediocre regular season, a 12-13 record and a 4.51 earned run average.</p>
        <p>Turner did not see Hernandez beat Cleveland in the Yankees' only pivotal game of 1998, when El Duque shut down the Indians in Game 4 of the A.L.C.S. after going 15 days without pitching. Turner was not around when Hernandez dominated Boston in the playoffs last year, or when Hernandez allowed one hit over seven innings to Atlanta in Game 1 of the World Series last year.</p>
        <p>Turner was fascinated, then, to hear teammates chatter confidently at the close of Game 5 on Sunday.</p>
        <p>''Everybody was like, 'Hey, we got Duque going next game, we'll be fine,' '' Turner said. ''I'll trust them.''</p>
        <p>Hernandez wears his confidence like a tailored suit, seen in the ease of his routine. He eats a bowl of spaghetti before each game, arrives at the park about three hours before his start, outwardly relaxed. Some pitchers, like David Cone, engage others in pregame chatter, and some, like Roger Clemens, mostly prefer to be left alone. Hernandez will talk, but there is a distance.</p>
        <p>He will have his right arm and shoulders rubbed down, talking a little with the masseur Rohan Baichu, but mostly staying quiet.</p>
        <p>''There are hardly any words spoken,'' Baichu said. ''About an hour and a half or an hour before the game, he'll come out of that relaxation mode and he starts to go through his pregame routine, to get ready for the fight, for the battle. You can see it in his eyes: he's ready for anything that comes. He believes he's going to win.''</p>
        <p>Hernandez will become more animated as he stretches in front of his locker, pumping up teammates who pass by his locker.</p>
        <p>''Not to say that he doesn't prepare during the season, but you can tell it's a different time of year,'' said Randy Choate, the rookie reliever, whose locker is two cubicles away from Hernandez. ''He's a little bit loose, but you can tell how serious and focused he is.</p>
        <p>''He'll joke around a little bit, but that last 10 minutes before he goes to warm up, he really seems to focus. You can see it in him when he's stretching.''</p>
        <p>As he goes to warm up in the bullpen, Hernandez walks from the clubhouse to the dugout, onto the field, stepping over the first-base line superstitiously, before moving to the outfield. The pitching coaches will stand and watch him as he goes through a series of drills, a bunny hop on his right leg, a mimicking of his motion.</p>
        <p>When Hernandez throws his last warm-up pitch, he pulls on his Yankees jacket and drapes a white towel around his neck, looking like a boxer. Taking the mound for the top of the first inning, he slowly steps off four lengths with his feet, to note where he should land with his left foot in his delivery, and makes a cross in that spot with his spikes.</p>
        <p>Derek Jeter, the Yankees' shortstop, has said it is easy to see fear in a player. He sees the opposite in Hernandez: pure, uncompromised confidence.</p>
        <p>Hernandez can be easily distracted from what he is doing during the regular season, by an umpire's call or some disagreement with Jorge Posada, the Yankees' starting catcher. ''But you can see he gets locked in'' during the postseason, Turner said. ''You can see it in his eyes.''</p>
        <p>At one juncture in Game 2, Posada and Hernandez labored to agree on a sign, and Posada raised his hands and motioned for Hernandez to step off the rubber and start over, the sort of gesture that might stir Hernandez's stubbornness in a regular-season game and lead to a minor conflict. But Hernandez dutifully backed away, as Posada had asked, before going back to work.</p>
        <p>There does not seem to be any wasted energy in Hernandez in October, every pitch seemingly thrown with a purpose, one move in a larger chess match. Hernandez threw mostly fastballs the first time through the Seattle lineup in Game 2 of this A.L.C.S., following a pattern he established in the last six weeks of the regular season. He would get ahead in the count and then, when batters were protecting against a breaking ball or a changeup, Hernandez would throw a high fastball and they would flail at it.</p>
        <p>But the second time through the lineup in Game 2, Hernandez reversed the pattern to many hitters, throwing more breaking balls and off-speed pitches early in the count, a reminder that he was capable of reverting to his old style. ''The way he pitched the last time we faced him, he really was very tough,'' said Edgar Martinez, Seattle's designated hitter. ''I know he uses the ball to slide off the plate; his slider, he can use it any time.''</p>
        <p>Seattle Manager Lou Piniella intends to stack his lineup tonight with left-handed batters. ''Hernandez has never been beaten in the postseason,'' he said. ''We realize it.''</p>
        <p>Yankees second baseman Luis Sojo noted that Hernandez learned how to pitch as a member of the Cuban national team, which played its share of single-elimination games; Hernandez was weaned as a competitor in the mind-set that losing was unacceptable.</p>
        <p>Sojo has gone to the mound and looked Hernandez in the eyes in October. ''He looks like someone who's very angry,'' Sojo said. ''He looks like he's about to kick somebody's rear end.''</p>
