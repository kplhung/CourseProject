        <p>Calling the Democrats ''the party of fiscal responsibility and economic growth,'' Senator Joseph I. Lieberman today claimed for them the  credit for the nation's extraordinary economic boom, and said only they would sustain it.</p>
        <p>''Over the last eight years of the Clinton-Gore administration,'' Mr. Lieberman said, ''we have come to understand that what we can do begins with being fiscally responsible, that when government balances its books, it not only stops draining capital out of the markets because it's in hock, but it creates a sense of confidence generally, and that is one of the conditions for growth.''</p>

        <p>Calling the Democrats ''the party of fiscal responsibility and economic growth,'' Senator Joseph I. Lieberman today claimed for them the  credit for the nation's extraordinary economic boom, and said only they would sustain it.</p>
        <p>''Over the last eight years of the Clinton-Gore administration,'' Mr. Lieberman said, ''we have come to understand that what we can do begins with being fiscally responsible, that when government balances its books, it not only stops draining capital out of the markets because it's in hock, but it creates a sense of confidence generally, and that is one of the conditions for growth.''</p>
        <p>Vice President Al Gore and Mr. Lieberman, his running mate, have signaled that they will make prosperity their core issue in the final push toward the election on Nov. 7. But Mr. Lieberman's remarks were a continuing reflection of the ticket's  publicly split personality regarding President Clinton and his legacy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore has tried to distance himself from his partner of the last eight years, and he and Mr. Lieberman frequently say they want to be judged more on their plans for the future than on the record of the past. But the vice president clearly wants to take credit for the good times, although without mentioning Mr. Clinton by name -- a task that more often falls to Mr. Lieberman.</p>
        <p>''We've gone from the largest deficits in America, the federal government has, now to the largest surpluses,'' the senator said here in remarks to employees of FreeMarkets Inc., an Internet auction house for businesses. ''It started right in '93. The Clinton-Gore administration said, 'We're going to get serious about coming out of debt; here's our budget proposals that are controversial.' It passed without a single Republican vote; Al Gore had to break the tie in the Senate. And it turned the corner.''</p>
        <p>Speaking at FreeMarkets and at a senior citizens' center here, the senator argued that while Mr. Gore's proposed tax cuts and spending plans fit comfortably within the projected government surpluses of the next decade, Gov. George W. Bush's would mean a return to deficit spending.</p>
        <p>''That will take us back to debt and higher interest rates,'' he said, ''and higher interest is a kind of stealth tax increase, because it affects your mortgage payments, your car payments, your student loans, your credit cards.''</p>
        <p>Most independent analysts agree that Mr. Gore's plans are more likely to keep the government within its means, but many believe that both candidates' proposals run the risk of overspending the surpluses.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman's visit here, and appearances he plans in the Philadelphia area on Sunday night and Monday, attest to the tightness of the race and a growing worry in the Gore camp. A month ago, polls indicated that Pennsylvania was solidly for Mr. Gore. But even as Mr. Bush has pulled slightly ahead in most national surveys, this state once again appears to be a toss-up in need of the Democrats' cultivation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman also plans to campaign next week in Florida, another hotly contested state. And on Tuesday he is to be at the University of Notre Dame for what his aides call a major speech, on topics close to his heart: faith and values. The senator, the first Jewish candidate on a major party's national ticket, has for much of his career denounced what he describes as the corrosive influence of much of popular culture, and called for a greater role for religion in public discourse.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman, who does not campaign on the Jewish Sabbath, from sundown Friday to sundown Saturday, will be out of action this weekend until sundown Sunday. He will be  observing Simhat Torah, the last of a series of Jewish holy days that have taken him off the campaign trail for several days this month.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Lieberman visited an Internet company today, so did the Republican vice-presidential nominee, Dick Cheney. At Intranet Solutions Inc. of Eden Prairie, Minn., a Minneapolis suburb, Mr. Cheney told more than 100 employees that Mr. Bush's economic plans would do more to help ''the rising generation'' of 18- to 34-year-olds who work there.</p>
        <p>For a person in his 30's, Mr. Cheney said, the Bush proposal allowing workers to divert part of their Social Security taxes into private accounts  could mean an extra $150,000 by retirement.</p>
        <p>Noting that he and Mr. Bush had both held leadership posts outside government, Mr. Cheney called Mr. Gore's approach ''old school'' and said the vice president's proposals were ''diametrically opposed'' to the guiding principles of the ''new economy.''</p>
        <p>At a rally later in Green Bay, Wis., Mr. Cheney depicted the Democrats as unworthy guardians of the economic boom.</p>
        <p>''They can't wait to get their hands on that surplus,'' he said, ''so they can spend it.''</p>
        <p>In His Own Words</p>
        <p>JOSEPH I. LIEBERMAN  Speaking yesterday to employees of FreeMarkets, an online, business-to-business auction service in Pittsburgh:</p>
        <p>''What we've learned again is that government doesn't create jobs -- in America, it's always the private sector that creates jobs -- but that government can create the environment which is conducive for jobs to be created. If I may go back to an agricultural metaphor, government can turn the earth and provide some nutrients, but then it's the private sector that comes along and, you know,</p>
        <p>plants the seeds and nurtures the crops.</p>
        <p>The central question before the voters this year is:</p>
        <p>Do we want to see the country moving forward? Do we want to keep the prosperity going -- which Al Gore and I believe we're best able to do, and not only to keep the prosperity going but do it in a way, through better education and some of the tax incentives I've talked about, to expand the winner's circle to more of America's families? Or do we want to go back?''</p>
