        <p>To this day, puzzling questions hover over Hillary Rodham Clinton's effort to remake the nation's health care system in 1993 and 1994, the most ambitious project of her public life.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton mastered the complexities of health insurance, and she dazzled Congress with her command of facts and figures. But, even her allies say, she seemed to have a deaf ear for the politics of the issue in Congress.</p>
        <p>She disregarded early warnings that her plan was headed for trouble on Capitol Hill. She plowed ahead, showing little of the knack for compromise that is often the soul of the legislator's art.</p>
        <p>That experience is relevant now as Mrs. Clinton runs for the Senate from New York. She says she learned important lessons from the debacle of 1993-94, including the need to pursue grand goals by incremental steps. And, she says, she applies those lessons in her Senate race.</p>
        <p>But the puzzle remains: how, friends ask, could someone so smart, so knowledgeable about the arcane details of the health care system, have been so obtuse about the politics of the issue on Capitol Hill, where she now aspires to work?</p>
        <p>''We were politically naive,'' Mrs. Clinton said in an interview in September 1994, after the administration's proposal died in Congress. ''We made a lot of miscalculations.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton expertly diagnosed the problems she tried to solve: soaring health costs, millions of Americans without insurance. But she got nowhere near persuading Congress that she had a workable solution.</p>
        <p>Her opponent in the New York race, Representative Rick A. Lazio, will not let her forget. He calls her health plan ''an unmitigated disaster.'' Likewise, Gov. George W. Bush chides Al Gore, saying the vice president joined Mrs. Clinton in fighting for ''a government-run health care system'' in 1993.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton has often acknowledged errors. But mostly she suggests that the president's plan, which she developed, was not packaged and sold well. By contrast, her critics and some of her allies say that the product itself was the problem, and that she failed to see its flaws because of the frantic, secretive process by which it was devised.</p>
        <p>Her opponents suggest that Mrs. Clinton was personally responsible for the health care fiasco. That may be an overstatement. President Clinton was with her every step of the way.</p>
        <p>But, some White House officials say, Mrs. Clinton was in charge of the project and could have altered the administration's course. Her allies say they doubt whether she could have blunted Republican opposition. In any event, she says, she never had much of a chance to discuss deals with Republicans because, at some point in 1994, their cooperation ''just shut off like a spigot.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio, like many of Mrs. Clinton's critics, says her record in the battle over health care shows she lacks the temperament and experience to do the job for which she is now running. They note that her health care plan died in a Democratic Congress, and one reason, they say, is that she failed to work with Congress, even with committee and subcommittee chairmen of her own party.</p>
        <p>George Stephanopoulos, a top adviser to the Clintons, said that ''having Hillary run health care was a mistake,'' in part because ''compromise didn't come naturally'' to her.</p>
        <p>In his memoirs (''All Too Human,'' Little, Brown, 1999), Mr. Stephanopoulos said that Mrs. Clinton's health plan ''reflected both her strengths and her weaknesses,'' for it was ambitious, idealistic and highly logical, but also inflexible and overly complex.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's defenders say the health plan fell victim to Republican partisanship and to relentless attacks by insurance companies, drug companies and small businesses. When Mrs. Clinton took up her assignment in 1993, Republicans, especially in the Senate, said they were eager to work with her. But by the end of the year, the tide began to turn.</p>
        <p>In December 1993, conservative theorists like William Kristol were urging Congress to reject the Clinton plan, and their advice emboldened other Republicans. In response to Mr. Clinton's State of the Union Message in January 1994, Bob Dole, the Senate Republican leader, said, ''Our country has health care problems, but no health care crisis.''</p>
        <p>In February 1994, the White House suffered a damaging blow when the Congressional Budget Office said that the Clintons had understated the cost of their proposal and the premiums needed to pay for it.</p>
        <p>By the summer of 1994, many Republicans had made a strategic decision to oppose the Clinton plan, partly because they saw it as a vivid symbol of big government, and partly because they sensed that its defeat would help them win control of Congress. Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas, said the president's plan would pass only ''over my cold, dead political body.''</p>
        <p>Theda Skocpol, a professor of government and sociology at Harvard, said Mrs. Clinton suffered the fate of many strong women. ''She was singled out as a witch-type figure,'' said Ms. Skocpol, who wrote a book on the Clinton health plan (''Boomerang,'' Norton, 1996).</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton was a victim of ''vicious ridicule'' and ''misogynist mockery,'' Ms. Skocpol said.</p>
        <p>Sara Rosenbaum, a professor of health law and policy at George Washington University, who supervised the drafting of the Clinton administration's health care bill in 1993, said she still wondered about Mrs. Clinton: ''How does a woman get to be so hated by people who have never met her? A lot of people were intimidated by her. She has a formidable personality.''</p>
        <p>But Mrs. Clinton's problems ran much deeper.</p>
        <p>By her own account, she underestimated the magnitude of the task she had set for herself, redesigning the health care system and rearranging one-seventh of the nation's economy. She overestimated the mandate of a president who had been elected with 43 percent of the popular vote. And, by her own admission, she was a novice in dealing with Congress.</p>
        <p>''I didn't understand the rhythm of the place,'' Mrs. Clinton said of Congress in the 1994 interview. ''I didn't understand the institutional constraints.''</p>
        <p>President Clinton took office on Jan. 20, 1993. Five days later he named Mrs. Clinton to lead a task force that was supposed to devise a detailed proposal to control health costs and guarantee health insurance for all Americans. Mr. Clinton said he would submit the proposal to Congress within 100 days of his inauguration -- by April 30.</p>
        <p>But the deadline slipped again and again. Mr. Clinton placed a higher priority on pushing his budget through Congress, over Republican opposition.</p>
        <p>''Mrs. Clinton was not allowed to go forward with health care reform at a time when the president's power was at its height,'' Ms. Rosenbaum said.</p>
        <p>Originally, Mrs. Clinton said in September 1994, ''we thought we were going to get health care reform'' enacted as part of the budget package. ''I personally miscalculated,'' she said, ''because of my experience dealing with state legislatures, which handle a huge array of problems in a compressed period of time.''</p>
        <p>Congress, she found, ''can do only one big thing at a time.''</p>
        <p>The president and Mrs. Clinton delivered the text of their legislative proposal, a 240,000-word document, to Congress on Oct. 27, 1993.</p>
        <p>In a recent interview, Dan Rostenkowski, the Illinois Democrat who was then chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said, ''Mrs. Clinton was so committed to trying to get the entire bill through Congress that she created some blind spots for herself.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rostenkowski said he had told Mrs. Clinton that it would have been wiser to ''give us some parameters and guidelines'' and let Congress fill in the details.</p>
        <p>White House officials felt they would not be taken seriously unless they fleshed out their ideas.</p>
        <p>In addition, Mr. Rostenkowski recalled, he urged Mrs. Clinton to be more flexible, saying: ''Hillary, you're not in Arkansas now. You're dealing with legislators who have varied views. Compromise is what will get this bill passed.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton met frequently with members of Congress, but, they said, she did not assimilate their comments or criticism into her work.</p>
        <p>The White House team ''came over and saw us all the time, but ignored what we said,'' said Representative Pete Stark, the California Democrat who was then chairman of a powerful subcommittee responsible for health legislation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stark said he urged Mrs. Clinton to be less secretive. He challenged her estimates of the savings that could be achieved in a more competitive health care market. And he cautioned that the structure of her proposal, which called for the purchase of insurance through huge ''regional alliances,'' was too convoluted to work. But his advice did not lead to significant changes in the proposal.</p>
        <p>Many potential allies complained about the secrecy of Mrs. Clinton's task force. After a White House meeting in March 1993, Dr. Quentin D. Young, national coordinator of Physicians for a National Health Program, a champion of universal health care, said, ''It was a magnificent exercise in pseudo-openness.''</p>
        <p>When Mrs. Clinton visited Congress in February 1993, Newt Gingrich, the Georgia Republican who was then minority whip, articulated the concerns that swamped the president's plan 19 months later.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gingrich said then that Mrs. Clinton's proposal looked like ''washed-over old-time bureaucratic liberalism, or centralized bureaucratic socialism.''</p>
        <p>Looking back in September 1994, Mrs. Clinton said she had been surprised by the ferocity of the opposition to her plan.</p>
        <p>''I totally missed the coming wave of partisanship,'' Mrs. Clinton said then. ''I just missed it. And I am still kind of puzzled about how it happened.''</p>
        <p>Members of both parties tried to send warning signals to the White House.</p>
        <p>In May 1993, Representative Stark said the premise of Mrs. Clinton's proposal -- the concept of managed competition -- was ''a fairy tale.'' That approach, which relied on market forces to hold down costs and expand coverage, had never been tried, Mr. Stark said, and he likened it to a unicorn, ''a beautiful animal in fairyland, but unseen on earth.''</p>
        <p>Then in September 1993, just three days before Mr. Clinton presented his plan to a joint session of Congress, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, said its financing was based on a ''fantasy.'' Estimates of savings in Medicare and Medicaid were overly optimistic, he said.</p>
        <p>A year later Mrs. Clinton said, ''That was probably the single most damaging moment in the entire health care debate,'' and she described Mr. Moynihan's comment as ''a killer.''</p>
        <p>Some budget experts inside the administration had expressed similar doubts about the financing of the Clinton plan. But they said it was difficult for them to criticize a plan devised by the president's wife.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton is now running for the seat Mr. Moynihan holds. His comments in 1993 carried weight because he was chairman of the Finance Committee and had a reputation for independent thinking and plain speaking.</p>
        <p>Senator Moynihan worried, as he later wrote, that ''the administration bill would devastate the New York City hospital system'' by reducing the number of foreign medical graduates in city hospitals. And he lamented ''the fatal complexity and coerciveness'' of the administration's plan.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton now calls teaching hospitals ''the crown jewels of America's health care system,'' and she supports Mr. Moynihan's effort to provide financing for medical schools and teaching hospitals.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio says the Clinton health plan would have cost New York 72,000 jobs.</p>
        <p>In 1993-94, Mrs. Clinton often emphasized her willingness to negotiate. But she was inclined to demonize critics and opponents, just as they demonized her.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton displayed a combative, adversarial style. She not only criticized the policies and practices of insurance companies and drug companies, but accused them of price-gouging and criticized their motives and morality.</p>
        <p>In May 1993, in a campaign-style speech to the Service Employees International Union, Mrs. Clinton said she would ''take on every special-interest group,'' and she denounced ''price-gouging, cost-shifting and unconscionable profiteering'' by the health care industry.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton appeared to relish the prospect of a populist crusade. ''If the forces arrayed against reform want a real battle in which their self-interest is exposed and their real agenda is made public, they will get it,'' she vowed in November 1993.</p>
        <p>But Mrs. Clinton did not build the coalitions or round up the votes needed to win that battle. Indeed, she turned a cold shoulder to moderate Democrats, complaining that their proposals would not guarantee coverage for 100 percent of the population.</p>
        <p>In a curious way, events over the last six years have borne out the concerns of both Mrs. Clinton and her critics. Events suggest she was right to worry about health costs and the uninsured. Costs are surging again, and the ranks of the uninsured grew by an average of more than a million a year from 1994 to 1998.</p>
        <p>But events also suggest that Mrs. Clinton's critics were right in asserting that the government could never perform the large role she envisioned for it. The government cannot figure out how much to pay health maintenance organizations caring for 6.2 million Medicare beneficiaries, lawmakers say, so it could hardly have set premiums and supervised insurance arrangements for more than 270 million Americans.</p>
