        <p>FROM his distant view in downtown Norfolk, Va., Dave Rosenfield, the general manager of the Norfolk Tides, said the Subway Series seemed like a page out of some subterranean nightmare. He has been following the drama, reading the dueling headlines laden with talk of Civil War and battles. He has watched with the mixed feelings of someone with one foot in the baseball world of metaphors and similes and the other foot in the world of the United States Navy, where real people sometimes die defending the right of a country to enjoy the national pastime.</p>

        <p>FROM his distant view in downtown Norfolk, Va., Dave Rosenfield, the general manager of the Norfolk Tides, said the Subway Series seemed like a page out of some subterranean nightmare. He has been following the drama, reading the dueling headlines laden with talk of Civil War and battles. He has watched with the mixed feelings of someone with one foot in the baseball world of metaphors and similes and the other foot in the world of the United States Navy, where real people sometimes die defending the right of a country to enjoy the national pastime.</p>
        <p>From Rosenfield's baseball standpoint, the Series is satisfying.</p>
        <p>Bobby Valentine managed at Norfolk in 1994 and 1996. Benny Agbayani played at Norfolk from 1996 to 1999. Agbayani and his wife were married at home plate at the Tides' Harbor Park before the International League's 1998 All-Star Game. ''Benny was a guy who was passed over and played hard enough that he forced somebody to look at him,'' Rosenfield said.</p>
        <p>Jay Payton played at Norfolk in 1995, 1996, 1998 and 1999. ''Here's a guy who spent his whole career injured until this year,'' Rosenfield said. ''This is the first year that he's ever remained healthy.''</p>
        <p>Bobby J. Jones pitched the first game in the Tides' new stadium, in 1993. This year, the Tides' brief, shining star was Timo Perez, who came out of nowhere. ''When they sent him up to us in June,'' Rosenfield said, ''they took Jason Tyner to the majors and said, 'We're going to send you Perez.' I said: 'You're going to do what? Who?' Nobody knew him at all.''</p>
        <p>But on other fronts, the coming Subway Series has been a thorn in Rosenfield's side and a disappointment. The ticket crush has been disheartening. Rosenfield was allotted 20 tickets for each of the three games at Shea Stadium. He has no tickets for Yankee Stadium.</p>
        <p>''If I had 100 tickets, I couldn't take care of what I've got,'' he said. ''We have our major sponsors, our owners, our investors, our major advertisers. I've had a list going since July.</p>
        <p>''It's been terrible. It's taken some of the fun out of the anticipation of the Series for me.''</p>
        <p>What really took the joy out of the Series was the recent bombing attack against the Navy destroyer Cole, which took the lives of 17 crew members. The Tides' office is only 20 minutes south of the Norfolk Naval Station, where the Cole is based.</p>
        <p>The Tides' organization has developed a close relationship with the Navy. ''Over the course of each season, we have a number of sailors who want to re-enlist on the field,'' Rosenfield said. Two years ago, the Tides were the hosts of the International League All-Star Game and tossed a pregame party on the aircraft carrier Enterprise.</p>
        <p>The team has special prices for active members of the military and does a number of group nights linked to the naval base. On May 15, the Cole had such a night at Harbor Park.</p>
        <p>Rosenfield said he was devastated by news of the attack. ''I'm terribly disturbed,'' he said. ''It's kind of an eerie feeling when you read about any sort of a naval disaster, but particularly with a ship that's home-ported here -- the feeling that you probably met some of those guys.</p>
        <p>''It brings the world situation closer than you want it to be. You'd rather have things detached, but when something like that happens, it really just brings it home.''</p>
        <p>Rosenfield, who turned 69 last spring, can remember when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor.</p>
        <p>''I don't think any of us in the United States felt the same thing about war that the people, say, in Britain did,'' Rosenfield said. ''I think it was brought home to us if we had relatives that were killed or injured or captured, but the fact is that the war really never came to our street. I think when you become involved in a situation like we were in here, with the Cole and the Navy, you feel like it's on your block.''</p>
        <p>He wondered if Major League Baseball would do something to honor the sailors who lost their lives and the sailors who survived. Perhaps it could invite the sailors to New York to attend a game.</p>
        <p>''I think that would give a marvelous feeling to the whole Series,'' Rosenfield said.</p>
        <p>Later in the day, Commissioner Bud Selig said the idea had been tossed around in a meeting but had not gone much further. The more he thought of it, the more he said he realized that a tribute during baseball's greatest drama would be fitting.</p>
        <p>By the end of the day, Selig had discussed the matter with Rear Adm. John B. Foley III, commander of the Naval Surface Force, U.S. Atlantic Fleet. They agreed to have some of the sailors honored during Game 4 on Wednesday at Shea Stadium.</p>
        <p>Rosenfield said it was the best news he had received in weeks.</p>
        <p>Selig said: ''We're going to do something big. We're going to bring as many as we can; we will do something that honors each one of them.</p>
        <p>''But you know what's so amazing?'' he added. ''They were flattered that we would even think about them. That's what's so stunning. After what I've put up with all day, with ticket requests from people. No, they will be more than appropriately honored, although as I said to the admiral, we're the ones who are honored.</p>
        <p>''You've got to put life in its perspective. This is a baseball game. I used to tell myself that when the Brewers would blow a game and I'd think the world was coming to an end. And all of a sudden I'd realize you have to go through an evolution of really understanding what's important in life and what isn't. This is the least we can do, and it's hardly enough, and it's nothing compared to what they've done.''</p>
        <p>There were complaints that the New York-New York World Series was too self-absorbed. With survivors from the Cole coming to the city on Wednesday, the Subway Series is what New York is at its core: something the entire nation can embrace.</p>
