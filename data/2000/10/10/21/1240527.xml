        <p>Secretary General Kofi Annan, who returned two days ago from his own shuttle diplomacy in the Middle East, today asked the General Assembly to make ''a real difference'' by helping to bring an end to the fighting between the Palestinians and Israel.</p>
        <p>Mr. Annan addressed the Assembly before it discussed and then adopted a resolution that condemns Israel for ''excessive use of force'' against the Palestinians but also supports the return of both sides to the negotiating table.</p>
        <p>Mr. Annan sketched out his eyewitness view of a region ''at the brink of the abyss'' during his visit to Israel, the Palestinian territories, Lebanon and Egypt, and his viewpoint was through a prism of hope, though not optimism.</p>
        <p>The secretary general, who took part in the gathering in Sharm el Sheik, Egypt, that formulated a truce, paid tribute to President Clinton, who he said had worked for 28 hours straight to get Israel's prime minister, Ehud Barak, and the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, to agree.</p>
        <p>''We are not yet certain whether or not normalcy will be restored,'' Mr. Annan said. ''We can only wait and hope. The next few days are vital.''</p>
        <p>After the secretary general left, 47 speakers asked to address the emergency session, before the resolution was overwhelmingly adopted late tonight by a vote of 92 to 6, with 46 abstentions. The lopsided vote was anticipated, with only the United States, Israel and four Pacific Ocean nations -- Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru and Tuvalu -- opposing the resolution.</p>
        <p>Ambassador Ahmed Aboul Gheit of Egypt, which was the first Arab country to recognize Israel and which was host of the negotiating meeting, expressed a view shared by many of the day's speakers that ''the situation is one of a shameful aggression by an occupying power on a defenseless people.''</p>
        <p>Cuba's ambassador, Bruno Rodriguez Parrilla, criticized Israel more bluntly for what he called ''colonial occupation and massive flagrant violations of rights of Palestinian people.'' He said that ''it is hard to see how the peace process will survive the present crisis.''</p>
        <p>But Russia's ambassador, Sergey V. Lavrov, said, ''Russia is convinced that there is no rational alternative to peace.'' The confrontation, he said, only highlighted the regional interdependence of Israelis and Palestinians.</p>
        <p>The United States and Western European countries did not join the other speakers. Israel's ambassador, Yehuda Lancry, who defended his country's actions from the podium on Wednesday, sat silently.</p>
        <p>But the United States ambassador, Richard C. Holbrooke, talking to journalists earlier, called the resolution ''one-sided, unbalanced'' and ''unhelpful to the peace process.''</p>
        <p>The resolution underwent final revisions today after what diplomats said was a French-led effort to make it more moderate. It condemns ''acts of violence, especially the excessive use of force by the Israeli forces against Palestinian civilians.'' It describes Israeli settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip as ''illegal and an obstacle to peace'' and demands that ''illegal acts of violence by Israeli settlers'' be prevented.</p>
        <p>But it also supports a resumption of peace talks and calls for ''the speedy conclusion of the final settlement agreement between the two sides.'' It further affirms ''the right of security for all states in the region'' -- which would include Israel.</p>
        <p>General Assembly resolutions cannot be vetoed, and they carry no provision for enforcement, as Security Council resolutions usually do. Assembly resolutions have often been a vehicle for criticizing Israel.</p>
