        <p>Facing potential restrictions on a major ingredient in some of their best-known brands, pharmaceutical companies staunchly defended the safety of their products yesterday and accused the Food and Drug Administration of placing an unwarranted amount of faith in what they called a questionable study.</p>
        <p>Manufacturers of over-the-counter drugs that contain the ingredient, phenylpropanolamine, commonly found in decongestants and appetite suppressants, said they had no plans to take the products off the market, despite new evidence that it could increase the risk of stroke in young women.</p>
        <p>Drawing from a five-year study at Yale University that is the largest ever conducted on the health effects of the substance, a panel of experts convened by the agency recommended on Wednesday that the ingredient be barred from over-the-counter medications.</p>
        <p>Every year, Americans spend hundreds of millions of dollars to consume billions of doses of products containing phenylpropanolamine, including Alka Seltzer, Dexatrim, Dimetapp and Triaminic.</p>
        <p>Scientists hired to review the study by the Consumer Healthcare Products Association, the industry's main trade group, called it ''inconclusive'' and said it drew from an insignificant pool of cases. Of the 702 stroke victims in the study, for example, six were found to have used an appetite suppressant, yet only one in a control group of nearly 1,400 had taken a similar product -- too few, they argued, from which to draw any meaningful insight.</p>
        <p>''It's not a very robust test of a hypothesis,'' said Dr. Charles H. Hennekens, a former professor of medicine at Harvard who was hired by the industry to review the findings. ''It was unfortunate that people accepted this like it was the gospel.''</p>
        <p>Although the drug agency has received only 44 reports of strokes tied to phenylpropanolamine in the last 30 years, agency officials estimate that more than 200 such incidents occur each year. Since over-the-counter medications are taken without a doctor's oversight, the drug agency says, few doctors identify phenylpropanolamine as a factor in strokes. Moreover, manufacturers of nonprescription drugs are not typically required to report adverse health reactions, making it hard to keep track of actual illnesses.</p>
        <p>The industry's consumer products association proposed a number of alternatives to a ban on Thursday at the meeting where the panel recommended the restrictions. Those proposals include stricter labeling and additional studies. But until the agency actually prohibits the use of phenylpropanolamine, many manufacturers said they did not intend to replace the substance or start special campaigns to allay consumer fears.</p>
        <p>''We're confident that we could put a new product on the shelf that doesn't contain it rather quickly,'' said Francis Sullivan, spokesman for Williams Whitehall-Robins Health Care, the division of American Home Products for nonprescription drugs, where sales of Dimetapp and Robitussin have exceeded $130 million in the past year. ''But for now advertising is status quo.''</p>
        <p>Manufacturers said that they can replace phenylpropanolamine with pseudoephedrine, an active ingredient in many other nonprescription cold and cough remedies. That would require little more than a reformulation to preserve the product's taste. Yet many companies contend that such a move would be premature, considering that a final ruling by the drug agency is still weeks away.</p>
        <p>Industry officials say they support a coordinated but voluntary reporting system of reporting illnesses but contend that a regular survey of their members turns up an average of just two reports of stroke from phenylpropanolamine each year, only slightly more than what the  drug agency has found. Many of these illnesses, the consumer products association says, are in people who take more than the recommended dose, particularly with appetite suppressants, hoping it will expedite results.</p>
        <p>In response, the industry is now pushing for uniform labeling on phenylpropanolamine products. Under the proposal, consumers would be warned not to use more than one medication with the ingredient at a time and told in bold letters across the packaging that increasing the dose can be dangerous. The drug agency has been looking at making such instructions mandatory since 1996, but as part of a compromise with the industry until the study was completed, they have remained voluntary. Some manufacturers have followed them.</p>
