        <p>The Republican National Committee released a new 30-second Spanish-language television commercial this week that promotes Gov. George W. Bush's promise to improve public schools and salutes his record on the issue in Texas. It is running in five states, most of them where the presidential candidates are in close races and all of them with many Hispanic voters: California, Florida, New Mexico, Nevada and Pennsylvania.</p>
        <p>In addition, the Republican committee began broadcasting an expanded, 60-second radio version of the commercial in those five states and two others, Georgia and Washington. Both the television and radio commercials will run until Election Day, and while the committee would not say precisely how much money it was spending to run the advertisements, an official said it was a ''multimillion-dollar'' buy.</p>

        <p>The Republican National Committee released a new 30-second Spanish-language television commercial this week that promotes Gov. George W.

It is running in five states, most of them where the presidential candidates are in close races and all of them with many Hispanic voters: California, Florida, New Mexico, Nevada and Pennsylvania.</p>
        <p>In addition, the Republican committee began broadcasting an expanded, 60-second radio version of the commercial in those five states and two others, Georgia and Washington. Both the television and radio commercials will run until Election Day, and while the committee would not say precisely how much money it was spending to run the advertisements, an official said it was a ''multimillion-dollar'' buy.</p>
        <p>PRODUCER -- Guerra DeBerry &amp; Company</p>
        <p>ON THE SCREEN -- The television commercial opens with black-and-white images of an impoverished barrio: a rundown house, a sorrowful man sitting on a curb, a lonely boy walking among the weeds that have sprouted under a bridge. Then, as the subject of the spoken words changes from the neglect of Hispanic people around the country to the strides being made by Hispanic students in Texas, the images bloom into full color, focusing on the happy faces and postures of a Hispanic teacher and her Hispanic students in a classroom. Hispanic children run merrily outside a school. And then Mr. Bush, in color and in close-up, talks directly to the viewer.</p>
        <p>THE SCRIPT -- (translated from Spanish to English by the Bush campaign) -- First, an unseen announcer says, ''They say that the economy's better than ever, but in our neighborhoods, we feel forgotten. We need a better education. And that means a new commitment. In Texas, Governor Bush raised academic standards and teacher salaries. Test scores improved. Now minority children in Texas lead the country in academic improvement.''</p>
        <p>Governor Bush, speaking Spanish, says, ''For me, education is No. 1. Because our children deserve the best.''</p>
        <p>ACCURACY -- Under Mr. Bush's watch, Texas did raise standards and salaries, and Mr. Bush demonstrated as much interest in education as in any other issue. But some of the claims here about his education record are selective and broad. By some measures, in some grades, minority children in Texas were at or near the top in the nation for improvement; by others, they fared less well, especially in higher grades. Scores on standardized college-admission tests, for example, have not changed much.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush, as both a governor and a presidential candidate, has spoken in a more welcoming, concerned voice about Hispanic immigrants than most other Republicans. But critics say he has not moved nearly as aggressively as he could have to make sure that poor children in Texas, Hispanic and otherwise, have health care or to improve conditions in the impoverished ''colonias'' of Hispanic immigrants near the Mexican border.</p>
        <p>SCORECARD -- In some ways, the subject matter and the claims here are less important than the language being spoken, which tells Hispanic voters that they matter. It is a message they are receiving louder and clearer this election year than ever before; in fact, this is the fourth Spanish-language commercial the Republican committee has released. The goal is for Mr. Bush to blunt Democrats' advantage with Hispanic voters, and the hope that he can do that is fueled by the demographics behind his 1998 re-election in Texas. Some surveys showed Mr. Bush receiving nearly half the Hispanic vote.</p>
