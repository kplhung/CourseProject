        <p>Air Force Two cozied up to Air Force One at an airport near here today, setting up a very public runway reunion of President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore and their wives -- a flurry of hearty handshakes and air kisses that aides said was meant to discredit reports that the relations between the men were  strained.</p>
        <p>After the greetings at Columbia Regional Airport, the four hopped into the same limousine -- a practice the Secret Service generally frowns upon -- on the way to a memorial service for Gov. Mel Carnahan, who died with his son and an aide in a plane crash on Monday night.</p>
        <p>The public displays of affection did not change a political reality: Mr. Gore has made a conscious effort to nudge Mr. Clinton to the sidelines as he seeks to follow him in the presidency.</p>
        <p>Mark Fabiani, Mr. Gore's deputy campaign manager, said today that while Mr. Clinton would help Mr. Gore's candidacy, the president would not appear at rallies with the vice president.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fabiani said that the president was making radio commercials for Mr. Gore and taping a telephone message that would be delivered automatically to likely voters in areas where the president is popular. He said Mr. Clinton would also raise money for the Democratic National Committee and was planning a campaign trip to California for the vice president.</p>
        <p>''Beyond that,'' Mr. Fabiani said, ''nothing has been scheduled with the president, and we anticipate that Al Gore will conclude the campaign as he has been running it -- as his own man and on his own vision.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore himself hedged about the matter today, both in a television interview and as he spoke to reporters on Air Force Two. He noted that the president had a ''full-time job'' and was busy with Congress and foreign policy. And he rebuffed all efforts to be dragged into a discussion of his complex relationship with the president or respond to reports that the president was hurt that Mr. Gore had not sought his help and advice.</p>
        <p>''I'm running as my own man,'' Mr. Gore said repeatedly.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton, responding to an article in The New York Times today, denied that he had been upset at Mr. Gore for not involving him more actively in the campaign. ''Not true,'' he said, jabbing his finger in the air for emphasis as he strolled toward his plane after the memorial service  with reporters in tow. ''It's categorically not true.'' And Mr. Clinton deferred to Mr. Gore on how he could best help the Gore-Lieberman ticket.</p>
        <p>''I'll do whatever's best,'' the president said, indicating there was still time before the election for Mr. Gore to enlist his help. ''I don't know. It's too soon to say. We've got to wait until we're a little closer.''</p>
        <p>Aides to Mr. Clinton said the president was eager to do what the vice president deemed necessary. ''He will do whatever's most helpful,'' said Jake Siewert, the president's press secretary. ''They are in the best position to know what will help them win.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Siewert played down reports of a disagreement between the two men outlined in the Times article, calling it ''a lot of psychobabble.''</p>
        <p>And Mr. Siewert pointed out that the president had not exactly been sitting on his hands this campaign season. So far this year, Mr. Clinton has attended nearly 180 fund-raisers on behalf of Democratic candidates -- governors, state legislators and members of the House and Senate, as well as Mr. Gore -- and has raised some $97 million.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton also regularly makes the case for Mr. Gore's election, often going at Gov. George W. Bush of Texas more aggressively than the vice president himself.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, Mr. Clinton told reporters he was not certain whether a president on his way out could really affect the race for those seeking to succeed him.</p>
        <p>''People make their decisions independently, so it would only matter if I had an argument to make that people would listen to,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Siewert said it would be up to the Gore campaign to determine whether the president ought to shift his attention from late-night fund-raising events, like the ones he did tonight for Democrats around Boston, to daytime rallies.</p>
        <p>''They're running the race,'' Mr. Siewert said of the vice president's staff.</p>
        <p>''It's the vice president on the ballot. They will make the decision on what will most help them win.''</p>
        <p>For now, it appears that Mr. Gore -- who avoided any mention of the president during the three presidential debates -- wants to go it alone.</p>
        <p>''This is a campaign that I am running on my own,'' Mr. Gore said in an interview on the NBC program  ''Today.'' ''And as I've said on previous occasions, I am who I am. I'm running in my own right with my own vision about the future of our country.''</p>
        <p>Asked if he was counting on help from Mr. Clinton, Mr. Gore suggested that the president might be busy with other things in the closing days of his presidency.</p>
        <p>''The Congress is still in session,'' Mr. Gore said. ''The leadership of the Congress on the Republican side has not been able to finish its business this year. A number of appropriations bills have still not been passed, weeks after the deadline. They are hard at work there. And of course, the particular challenges of foreign policy now are ones that command continuing attention.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore, who have not appeared together in public since a rally in Michigan in August, joined several thousand people who gathered around the Capitol steps here to bid farewell to Mr. Carnahan.</p>
        <p>The president told the mourners that Mr. Carnahan had been a ''magnificent governor'' who ''died in the saddle with his boots on.''</p>
        <p>''He had steel and passion and fire,'' Mr. Clinton said. ''He spoke the plain truth. He was a leader in the very best way.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Carnahan's plane crashed into an east Missouri hillside, killing the  governor, who was 66, his 44-year-old son, Roger -- known as Randy -- and an aide, Chris Sifford, 37.</p>
        <p>A horse-drawn caisson carried the governor's coffin, draped in an American flag, to the Capitol steps.  The procession was led by Mr. Carnahan's widow, Jean, and their family. Behind them followed the Senate Democratic leader, Tom Daschle of South Dakota; the House Democratic leader, Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri; Mr. Gore and his wife, Tipper; and the president and Hillary Rodham Clinton.</p>
        <p>After the memorial service for Mr. Carnahan, the Clintons and the Gores headed back to the Columbia airport together to board their respective planes.</p>
        <p>The Clintons saw the Gores to the steps of Air Force Two. The women embraced. The men shook hands. President Clinton waved, then walked across the tarmac to Air Force One.</p>
        <p>The Gores then headed to New Orleans, for two fund-raising events and a rally.</p>
