        <p>It was before a regular season game against the St. Louis Cardinals this summer and the Mets were saluting the 10 greatest moments in club history. Among them: Tom Seaver's almost perfect game and the trade for a washed-up Willie Mays.</p>
        <p>I had to laugh. An almost perfect game and a has-been? Clearly, the Mets faithful take a victory wherever we can find it.</p>
        <p>But now Mets fans, the whipping boys of New York baseball, may get something real to celebrate, and we can smell it over the rims of our beer mugs.</p>
        <p>It hasn't been a long time for me and the Mets. I admit that. I came to Queens four years ago from Detroit, by way of Oakland, Calif. They are all working-class areas, with working-class sensibilities, where working-class kids live the game of baseball.</p>
        <p>The Yankees? Never. I am a Tigers fan. Always have been, always will be. No true fanatic can ever drop his team. But Detroit is an American League town, and that entitles me to a National League favorite.</p>
        <p>For the last four years, my baseball summers have been spent working on my car and drinking beer to the sound of the Mets on the radio. Subway Series? When I go to the ballpark, I drive.</p>
        <p>Shea Stadium is a beautiful dump: a giant steel blue cake in a parking lot surrounded by the stink of the Flushing River, the Willets Point chop shops and three highways. It is a big cold place, where the wind blows through and they still allow smoking (near the exit ramps).</p>
        <p>Mets fans are tough and have a blue-collar mentality. They come from places like Bayside, Queens, and Babylon, Long Island; Cambria Heights, Queens, and Caracas, Venezuela; Commack, Long Island, and Calcutta.</p>
        <p>My friend Bob comes from Brooklyn. ''I've been a Mets fan since they came around in '62,'' he said. ''O'Malley, may he rot in hell, took my Dodgers away. I grew up hating the Yankees and I always will.''</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, many guys like Bob won't be at the first Subway Series in 44 years. The Mets organization has made tickets available only by telephone, and you know what happens then. Somehow the out-of-state brokers get hold of most of them and mark the tickets up 10 times their face value.</p>
        <p>So never mind you, Bob. What you'll see from the TV set in your local saloon is a bunch of celebrities and overfed poseurs, the cell phone and chardonnay crowd. Who are they waving at anyway?</p>
        <p>As for the regular workaday Yankees fan: good luck and nothing personal. I'll buy you a beer if I see you in the bar.</p>
        <p>For the Johnny-come-playoff Yankees fan, here are your directions.</p>
        <p>Have your driver take the Queens-Midtown Tunnel to the Long Island Expressway. You will drive along until you pass through the Hamptons and your summer home. Continue on to Montauk. When you reach the lighthouse, keep going until you plunge over the cliff.</p>
        <p>Mets in six.</p>
