        <p>The geography of New York baseball is an inexact science, a course of study as enigmatic as determining how many stadium beers will get you drunk.</p>
        <p>There are some basic tenets: in the west, the Yankees; in the east, the Mets; Manhattan and the Bronx belong to Joe Torre and his crew; Queens and Long Island to Bobby Valentine's boys.</p>
        <p>In Ridgewood, an interborough neighborhood that rests mostly in Queens and partly in Brooklyn, the local mapmakers have it that the Yankees control the grid to the left of Cypress Avenue, leaving the Mets to lord it over everything that falls to the right.</p>
        <p>While the border between the two camps has been known to shift slightly with the standings, the one thing on the border that never shifts is the First Base Inn.</p>
        <p>The First Base occupies a sleepy residential corner at Forest Avenue and Norman Street in an area of Ridgewood strung with single-family homes, old trees and bicycles marooned on lawns. It is the first Mets bar that a Mike Piazza fan will come across as he crawls his way east from Cypress Avenue out of the dangers of Yankees land.</p>
        <p>The regulars know their starting lineups and they certainly know their stats. When a cell phone goes off, it rings to the tune of ''Take Me Out to the Ballgame.''</p>
        <p>Four years ago, the First Base was an old-folks saloon where the jukebox was stocked with Benny Goodman discs and the bar-side chatter ran to memories of Bobby Thomson's pennant-winning homer in 1951. But in 1996, the place changed hands , and now a bright-blue Mets flag hangs above the shelves of whiskey.</p>
        <p>Ronnie Kessler, the burly barkeeper, mans the oak in sneakers and jeans. In this season of the Subway Series, he feels bound to uphold his allegiance to Shea.</p>
        <p>''I'm picking the Mets in six,'' he predicted yesterday as World Series pregame blather beamed from the TV. ''But it better not go to seven or I'll have myself a coronary.''</p>
        <p>His brother, Rickie, hangs out at the bar, sipping on drafts and practicing darts. The only thing that tickles Rickie more than cheering the Mets is jeering the Yanks. His reviews of the opposing players run the gamut from loathing to hate.</p>
        <p>Jose Canseco: ''He ain't classy. He's just sitting on the bench collecting his check.''</p>
        <p>Roger Clemens: ''He's overrated and overpaid.''</p>
        <p>David Cone: ''He stinks.''</p>
        <p>There is bravado in the First Base Inn, but there is also the unwitting self-expression that is only possible while talking baseball over a bowl of pretzels and a bottle of beer.</p>
        <p>Eddie Brown, for example, sees his own life story in the story of the Mets. To him, the team is the ultimate underdog -- the abandoned, wet-eyed puppy you cannot help but press to your chest.</p>
        <p>''My father was a Yankees fan and always used to rub it in my face,'' said Mr. Brown, 33, a enormous firefighter who still has the just-scrubbed face of a little boy. ''Back then, the Mets were awful.'' But I think that all that losing just made me want to root for them more.''</p>
        <p>Donna Hearst waits tables for a living and at 41, takes heart in the ambitions of the Mets. ''They have this stubbornness to be better than they are,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The regulars at the First Base Inn are locksmiths, roofers, plumbers, and cops. While they may be biased, they are never rude. It takes only one small thing for a Yankees fan who wanders in to be treated with respect: hands that are calloused by good hard work.</p>
        <p>''Hey, Ronnie,'' a fellow known as Johnny Mets Fan called out from his well-worn spot at the end of the bar. ''Are we loving people or not?''</p>
        <p>''We are,'' Mr. Kessler said.</p>
        <p>''We'll let the Yankees fans come in,'' Johnny added. ''We'll even party with them as best we can.''</p>
        <p>''But when they lose, we don't want them crying on the floor,'' he went on. ''We all work way too hard for that. We're not gonna mop up any Yankee tears this year.''</p>
