        <p>A federal appeals court has reinstated a ruling that permits student-led prayer in public-school assemblies and classrooms, after the United States Supreme Court ordered in June that the ruling be reconsidered.</p>
        <p>The ruling, first issued in July 1999 and reinstated by United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit here on Thursday, allows students to initiate and lead prayer in a classroom, assembly or football game, as long as school officials do not force them to do so or participate in any way. It upheld the practice in the schools of DeKalb County, Ala., in which students led Christian prayers over the intercom and before graduations and other school events.</p>
        <p>The decision angered opponents of school prayer, who believe that the lower court defied the Supreme Court. But the court and its supporters said the Constitution allowed all forms of private prayer, even those that opponents might believe the Supreme Court outlawed earlier this year.</p>
        <p>''Private speech endorsing religion is constitutionally protected -- even in school,'' said the decision, written by Senior Judge James C. Hill. ''Such speech is not the school's speech even though it may occur in the school. Such speech is not unconstitutionally coercive, even though it may occur before nonbeliever students.''</p>
        <p>The Supreme Court had set aside the lower court's ruling in June after the high court restricted school prayer in a case involving the Santa Fe, Tex., school board. The 6-to-3 decision said that a student-led prayer before an official school event like a football game was not truly private and could not be permitted, particularly when the school selects the student to lead the prayer, provides a public-address system for the prayer and sets aside a time for the prayer.</p>
        <p>The Santa Fe decision was criticized by many religious leaders and conservative organizations and has since led to a wave of Christian prayers said by students and adults in the stands at high school football games around the South.</p>
        <p>A week after the Santa Fe decision, the Supreme Court ordered the 11th Circuit to reconsider its Alabama ruling. It did not, however, order a completely new opinion or say that the appeals court must decide the case differently.</p>
        <p>In its decision on Thursday, a three-judge panel of the appeals court said that its earlier ruling was consistent with the Santa Fe decision and did not need to be rewritten. The court, which has jurisdiction in Alabama, Georgia and Florida, said that the Santa Fe decision did not prohibit voluntary, individual prayer, and that therefore, voluntary prayer in front of others was also permitted.</p>
        <p>The opinion says that the Constitution ''does not permit the state to confine religious speech to whispers or banish it to broom closets. If it did, the exercise of one's religion would not be free at all.''</p>
        <p>Critics of school prayer said the court had deliberately repudiated the Supreme Court's implicit desire for a new opinion.</p>
        <p>''When the nation's highest court vacates a ruling and says to write a new opinion according to what we are telling you is the law, you would expect the lower federal courts to take heed of that rather than defy the U.S. Supreme Court,'' said Pamela Sumners, the lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union who filed the Alabama case on behalf of Michael Chandler, an assistant principal in DeKalb County who disagreed with the school prayer policy.</p>
        <p>Barry Lynn, executive director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, said: ''The appeals court is really thumbing its nose at the Supreme Court's order. If you read these sentences literally, it really says that any student can demand to pray before or during any school event, and over the P.A. system. They act as if the Santa Fe case is a narrow, technical ruling.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lynn said the high court would never have set aside the Alabama decision if the court had agreed with it.</p>
        <p>But Bill Pryor, the attorney general of Alabama, whose office had urged the appeals court to reinstate its ruling, said there was no reason  the two rulings could not coexist.</p>
        <p>''This is the flip side of Santa Fe,'' Mr. Pryor said today. ''For the same reason a school cannot sponsor a prayer or religious speech, it also cannot censor a prayer or religious speech. What the court does not want to see is the use of school machinery to choose who is leading the prayer, or to set it up.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Pryor -- a supporter of students' right to pray -- said his interpretation of the Alabama ruling was that official invocations before football games or graduations were prohibited. But schools cannot stop a valedictorian from including a prayer in a speech, he said, and they can offer a football player time to speak to the crowd in an address that may or may not include a prayer.</p>
        <p>The Santa Fe decision, like many other Supreme Court opinions, contained language that could be used to support opposing positions. While it says that nothing in the Constitution prohibits voluntary student prayer, it also says that the use of a school microphone and podium gives listeners the impression that a pregame prayer is stamped with the school's approval.</p>
        <p>''The delivery of such a message -- over the school's public address system, by a speaker representing the student body, under the supervision of school faculty and pursuant to a school policy that explicitly and implicitly encourages public prayer is not properly characterized as 'private' speech,'' the opinion said.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, Walter Dellinger, a constitutional scholar at Duke University Law School, said there was enough ''loose language'' in the Santa Fe decision that it could be construed as allowing the Alabama practices.</p>
        <p>''This is right on the edge of the Santa Fe decision,'' Mr. Dellinger said, adding that it was not particularly unusual for a lower court to reinstate a ruling that had been set aside by the Supreme Court.</p>
        <p>Ms. Sumners said that she did not know yet what steps the A.C.L.U. would take next, but that she would not be surprised if the case was taken back to the Supreme Court for further clarification.</p>
