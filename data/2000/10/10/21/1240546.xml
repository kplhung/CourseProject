        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Go to any Met game during the year, and you will see hundreds of yarmulke-wearing fans chanting ''Let's go Mets!'' Yet because tickets to this year's World Series can only be purchased by phone on a Saturday morning (Sports pages, Oct. 18), an Orthodox Jew cannot buy tickets. As a Sabbath-observing Jew, I and thousands of others may not use a phone or conduct monetary transactions from sundown Friday to sundown Saturday.</p>

        <p>In other ways, the Mets have made an effort to accommodate their Jewish fans: we appreciate Jewish Night and the kosher-food stand. But in all likelihood, the Subway Series will be a once-in-a-generation occurrence, and thousands of us are being shut out. Perhaps in the future, the Mets  and other New York teams will take this into account when selling tickets to their games.</p>
