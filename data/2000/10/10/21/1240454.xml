        <p>Al Groh learned a few things at the University of Virginia, where he majored in commerce. But now the Jets' coach is trying to reinvent a law of football -- opposites repelling -- on Monday night, when the Jets and their retooled offense face the sack-happy Miami Dolphins.</p>
        <p>In presiding over a 5-1 record, Groh and his offensive coordinator, Dan Henning, have to a degree reinvented Vinny Testaverde. The quarterback has been limited in the big-play ability of his receivers, and because of the nerve problems in his neck and left arm. So he has adapted to a more conservative offense that keeps him out of trouble.</p>
        <p>The trouble is what the 5-1 Dolphins thrive on, with their stingiest defense in almost 25 years, and with a sack machine that crumbles the opposition.</p>
        <p>The Dolphins will look to wreak devastation on the Jets' quarterback in the fight for first place in the American Football Conference East. Although Testaverde has been sacked only five times in 184 passing situations, neither he nor the Jets, especially right tackle Ryan Young, has faced anyone with the dominating credentials of the Dolphins' Trace Armstrong.</p>
        <p>Performing in only about 15 plays a game, when the Dolphins expect the pass, Armstrong moves from the bench into the left end spot. In those limited opportunities, he has recorded 10 sacks, which means he gets a sack better than once every 10 rushes.</p>
        <p>At this rate he will shatter the league mark of 22 sacks set by the Jets' Mark Gastineau in 1984. Armstrong is on pace to record 27 sacks, a remarkable figure for a 35-year-old who has not been a starter for three years.</p>
        <p>The 265-pound Armstrong will have an average of 2.3 seconds to get off the line, slip around or bull through Young, and reach Testaverde.</p>
        <p>The 6-foot-5, 320-pound Young is an unexcitable young player who may make the ground shake when he walks, but speaks softly.</p>
        <p>Young is the second-year player who became a starter by default last season after Jason Fabini was pressed into service as the left tackle to replace the sidelined Jumbo Elliott. Young, drafted in the seventh and last round a year ago, became a solid performer.</p>
        <p>''I don't want to be specific about what I'm looking for, but I watch a lot of film on the guys I go against,'' Young said today. ''Jumbo has helped me look for certain things on film.''</p>
        <p>Young did admit that a key to what Elliott told him was to get a sense of Armstrong's rhythm.</p>
        <p>''That is very important, to know the rhythm a pass-rusher uses,'' Young said.</p>
        <p>Armstrong uses baseball terms when he speaks of the mechanics of the sack. He likens it to ''bringing your best fastball, then you have to learn to change things up from there.''</p>
        <p>The changeup is what Young has spent time watching, as well as Armstrong's sheer physical talent.</p>
        <p>''Getting the perfect takeoff is everything,'' Armstrong said. If he doesn't beat the offensive tackle off the ball, then the tackle has his hand on Armstrong, already slowing him.</p>
        <p>To Young, just slowing an opponent like Armstrong could be enough to protect Testaverde.</p>
        <p>''He gets rid of the ball quick,'' Young said, ''and so you don't have to hold your blocks for a long time.''</p>
        <p>Often, when a youngster goes against a player of superb talent, such as Young against Armstrong, teammates kid the youngster.</p>
        <p>Not this week, though.</p>
        <p>''The coaches rib me more than my teammates,'' Young said. ''The coaches let me know that Armstrong can be a game-breaker. But the guys take this thing seriously.''</p>
        <p>Another thing the Jets take seriously is getting caught in third-and-long situations, when they would face the obvious passing downs that the Dolphins relish. Miami has held its opponents to a 28 percent conversion rate on third down, while the Jets have converted 42 percent of their third-down attempts.</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>Coach AL GROH wants to play down the absence of his newfound pass-rusher, the rookie JOHN ABRAHAM, who has a pulled abdominal muscle. Abraham's four and a half sacks lead all American Conference rookies. Groh said he had a secret ballot of the players on Friday morning, asking if they thought they could beat Miami even without Abraham. Groh said two-thirds of the players said they could. Then Groh admitted he was just kidding, he had not really polled them. But he had made a point. . . . The decision whether to play a new starting tight end, ANTHONY BECHT, who has a sprained knee, and the special-team member BERNIE PARMALEE (hamstring) will be made at game-time. Center KEVIN MAWAE (sprained foot) continues to improve. ''It's very positive,'' Groh said of Mawae. . . . Right guard RANDY THOMAS, who already made the medical report with a shoulder problem, now has an ankle injury as well. He remains probable to play.</p>
