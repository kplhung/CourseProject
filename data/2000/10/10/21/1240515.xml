        <p>Shares of Ericsson plunged almost 16 percent after the company warned that sales and margins would be lower than expected for the fourth quarter because of losses in mobile-phone manufacturing. The warning overshadowed news that Ericsson's third quarter results were better than expected. Ericsson's president, Kurt Hellstroem, said the company planned to restore earnings by narrowing the product line and moving manufacturing to emerging markets. Ericsson said earnings nearly doubled to 4.3 billion kronor, or about $430 million, and sales grew 37 percent.</p>
