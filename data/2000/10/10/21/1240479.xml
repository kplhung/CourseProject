        <p>''THERE you go again,'' Jose Vizcaino complained, in a courteous, almost tender way, to a couple of city-bred reporters yesterday in front of his dressing stall at Yankee Stadium. ''Why do you all call it the Subway Series?''</p>
        <p>Informed that it was a matter of New York having impatiently waited 44 years to gorge itself on interborough nostalgia, the Yankees' starting second baseman tonight in Game 1 against the Mets was undeterred.</p>
        <p>''I don't want to say I went to the Subway Series,'' said Vizcaino, one of 67 men who has played for both teams. ''This is my first time. I want to say I played in the World Series.''</p>
        <p>From this Dominican's perspective, why wouldn't he? He didn't grow up pushing turnstiles and bouncing spaldeens off New York City stoops. Older family members didn't regale him with stories of Willie Mays and Pee Wee Reese, of the Polo Grounds and Ebbets Field.</p>
        <p>As his Panamanian teammate, the formidable Mariano Rivera, said: ''I don't know nothing about history. I just know we have to win now.''</p>
        <p>There are no more day games and baseball's sense of timelessness, once a charm, is more often a drag. The players rake in millions in salaries that make Series payoffs seem like utility-bill money. Yet, with all due respect for those wonderful memories, for a long-vanished city demographic and social landscape, the most significant difference between the New York Octobers of 1956 and 2000 has been the rise of people of color. On the field came the dominance of the African-American players, followed by the stunning influx of Latin Americans.</p>
        <p>According to the estimates of the New York Department of City Planning, only 5.5 percent of the city's population was of Hispanic origin during the mid-1950's. By last year, it was about 28 percent. New York and baseball have thus experienced parallel evolutions, the major league Hispanic population having swelled to 23 percent, a figure likely calculated before anyone had heard of Timo Perez.</p>
        <p>Even Vizcaino didn't know the name of his speedy countryman until last month, and that is good news for Mets' fans hoping that Perez is, as advertised, 23. ''He can't be 30-something, like they say,'' said Vizcaino, 32. ''If he were, I'd have known him.''</p>
        <p>What he was also saying, in effect, is that the Dominicans and other Latinos at large are more than a fraternity now, more than a movement. They are a way of life.</p>
        <p>''The major league teams realized a long time ago that it was less expensive to sign Latin American players,'' Vizcaino said. ''There's a lot of talent, a lot of hunger.''</p>
        <p>He was 17 when he signed with the Dodgers in 1986 for a paltry $4,500, from which he made his first significant purchase, a cow. Why a cow and not a car? ''So we'd have the milk to drink,'' said Vizcaino, one of eight children raised on a 25-acre farm near a small town about 25 minutes south of Santo Domingo.</p>
        <p>The family grew rice, beans, tomatoes and corn, and the young Jose worked the crops. If he sneaked off against the wishes of his father to play the game Dominicans love, he ran the risk of being spanked. Until Ceferino Vizcaino won a state lottery and the equivalent of $2,000, his one baseball-playing son had to pay friends a penny or two to watch the World Series on the rare neighborhood television set.</p>
        <p>He knows a few of the remaining Mets from when he passed through Shea Stadium in the mid-1990's, but nothing of the Brooklyn Dodgers, only that he was thrilled to escape Los Angeles when the Yankees obtained him in June. Forgive him for not caring about the years when New York was the center of the baseball universe because he is part of the sport's richest generation of Latin American players who have put more world in the Series than ever.</p>
        <p>The Mets will lead it off tonight with Timo and Venezuela's Edgardo Alfonzo, and we can pretty much guarantee that it will conclude sometime next week with another Dominican, Armando Benitez, or Rivera. ''No one bigger in Panama than Mariano,'' said Camilo Nunez, a Panamanian journalist, who had just interviewed Rivera. ''The Yankees have always had a huge following in Panama, going back to Hector Lopez. Everyone will be watching.''</p>
        <p>The American network executives are making no such predictions about the Midwest and beyond. Here in New York, the standard line is that we don't care if they don't care about our Subway Series. But New York, like baseball, has changed dramatically in 44 years, and many of its baseball-loving citizens, as Rivera said, know and care nothing about 1956.</p>
        <p>It's a new world, and the Series reaches way beyond the benefits and bounds of civic pride.</p>
        <p>''The Subway Series was in July,'' said Vizcaino, in the lineup tonight based on 10 hits in 19 career at-bats against Al Leiter. ''This is the World Series.''</p>
        <p>Play ball.</p>
