        <p>At least 20 people died today when a fire destroyed a huge nightclub in the heart of Mexico City that had been repeatedly cited for safety violations, officials said. The deaths set off an outcry against Mexico's ingrained public corruption. which may have contributed to the deaths.</p>
        <p>A city official, Dolores Padierna, who represents the downtown district where the two-story, 32,000-square-foot Lobohombo nightclub stood, said 20 people were killed and at least 39 injured after a fire broke out in the club about 5 a.m. She and other officials said the club was owned by businessmen suspected of ties to organized crime.</p>
        <p>They said the Lobohombo had been ordered closed by the authorities because of a tangle of safety and security issues. But it stayed open after the owners blocked the orders with 11 appeals and injunctions against the city.</p>
        <p>Questions about the owners, including whether they had paid off judges to hand down those injunctions, arose quickly after the flames died down at dawn. Ms. Padierna called the deaths ''the result of the impunity by which underworld and mafia leaders ignore the safety standards set by the city and live under protection in exchange for money.''</p>
        <p>Mayor Rosario Robles said the club's principal owner, whom she identified as Alejandro Iglesias Rebollo, would be charged with manslaughter. And she said judges had placed ''a straitjacket on officials looking for ways to close down illegal nightclubs.''</p>
        <p>The Lobohombo, on its mirrored face, was a glittery club for live music and dancing, popular among young middle-class patrons, with salsa and merengue bands and a $25 cover charge. But behind the facade, officials said, were gas and electric systems that could not meet codes.</p>
        <p>They said the Lobohombo had no posted emergency exits and violated many other safety standards.</p>
        <p>The director of Mexico City's civil protection agency, Luis Wintergerts, said the safety violations were ''ignored by the judge that granted the disco an operating license.''</p>
        <p>Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who will succeed Ms. Robles as mayor on Dec. 1, said he would ask Mexico's Supreme Court to investigate and publicly denounce judges who collude with businessmen over the granting of business licenses.</p>
