        <p>Despite playing without Karl Malone, their All-Star forward, the Utah Jazz handed the Knicks their first loss of the preseason last night, 96-90, at the Pepsi Arena in Albany.</p>
        <p>Kurt Thomas led the Knicks, whose preseason record dropped to 4-1, with 18 points, and Larry Johnson added 16 points and 7 rebounds. Marcus Camby had 10 rebounds and 7 points, ending his string of double-double performances at three. Glen Rice missed his second straight game for the Knicks because of a sore left knee.</p>
        <p>Malone, the third-leading scorer in National Basketball Association history, sat out the game with a sore left knee, and John Stockton played only 14 minutes. Bryon Russell led the Jazz with 18 points. The former Knick John Starks, who signed with Utah as a free agent in August, started, made his first three shots and scored 8 points.</p>
        <p>Before the game, the Knicks waived Vladimir Stepania, a center who joined the team from Seattle as part of the Patrick Ewing trade.</p>
        <p>Chris Broussard</p>
        <p>OLAJUWON TO MISS REST OF PRESEASON: Hakeem Olajuwon will miss the rest of the Houston Rockets' preseason with a sprained tendon in his left foot, the team physician Dr. Walter Lowe said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Olajuwon, trying to overcome an asthma-like breathing disorder in his final National Basketball Association season with the Houston Rockets, suffered the injury Thursday night in an exhibition game against the Portland Trail Blazers in North Little Rock, Ark.</p>
        <p>Olajuwon, 37, who has announced he is retiring at the end of this season, needs to practice because the breathing condition forced him to miss the final 14 games last season. He also underwent hernia surgery last season. (AP)</p>
