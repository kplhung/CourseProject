        <p>Jimmy Carter, a third-generation Southern Baptist and the first United States president to call himself a born-again Christian, has reached what he calls ''a painful decision'' to sever ties to the Southern Baptist Convention, saying that parts of its ''increasingly rigid'' doctrines violate the ''basic premises of my Christian faith.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Carter's decision, announced on Thursday in a letter that is being mailed this week to 75,000 Baptists nationwide, comes four months after the Southern Baptist Convention, the country's largest Protestant denomination, declared its opposition to women as pastors.</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Jimmy Carter, a third-generation Southern Baptist and the first United States president to call himself a born-again Christian, has reached what he calls ''a painful decision'' to sever ties to the Southern Baptist Convention, saying that parts of its ''increasingly rigid'' doctrines violate the ''basic premises of my Christian faith.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Carter's decision, announced on Thursday in a letter that is being mailed this week to 75,000 Baptists nationwide, comes four months after the Southern Baptist Convention, the country's largest Protestant denomination, declared its opposition to women as pastors.</p>
        <p>In the same doctrinal statement, adopted last June, the group advocated a literal interpretation of the Bible. Two years ago, the group called for wives to be submissive to their husbands.</p>
        <p>''I have seen an increasing inclination on the part of Southern Baptist Convention leaders to be more rigid on what is a Southern Baptist and exclusionary of accommodating  those who differ from them,'' Mr. Carter said today in a brief interview. ''In the last couple of years, this tendency of the Southern Baptist Convention leadership to ordain their creed on others has become more onerous for me and more difficult for me to accept.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Carter's announcement is largely symbolic, since he has not had an official role in the national group. But it is intended to influence state and local Baptist organizations, several of which are considering actions to distance themselves from the convention. Member churches are autonomous. The national denomination runs seminaries, missionary boards and a religious publishing house.</p>
        <p>Mr. Carter will continue to serve as a deacon and Sunday school teacher at his home church in Plains, Ga., Maranatha Baptist Church, which is still affiliated with the convention.</p>
        <p>The Southern Baptist Convention president, the Rev. James G. Merritt, said today that while he was saddened by Mr. Carter's decision, he did not expect a mass exodus. More than 41,000 churches belong to the convention, Mr. Merritt said. And while a handful of churches have left, he said, many more new Southern Baptist churches have been built.</p>
        <p>''The vast majority of Southern Baptists are extremely happy with the direction the convention is taking,'' said Mr. Merritt, the pastor of First Baptist Church in Snellville, Ga. ''We felt the need to turn our denomination back to a more conservative theology, and for whatever reason, the president did not agree with that.</p>
        <p>''I think it's a sad day for him. It's a sad day for us.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Carter is the highest-profile defection yet from the Southern Baptist Convention. He not only made his born-again Baptist beliefs a part of his public life during and after his presidency, but also helped move evangelical Christianity closer to the American mainstream.</p>
        <p>''He made talking about Jesus Christ a part of our public discourse in politics,'' said Douglas Brinkley, a historian at the University of New Orleans who has written about Mr. Carter's postpresidential years.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Carter's decision to dissociate himself from the national denomination is the latest sign that as conservatives have wrested control of the group over the last 15 years, liberal and moderate believers are giving up hope of having a home among them.</p>
        <p>In recent years, a handful of churches have broken off from the national group or joined moderate national networks, like the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship, based in Atlanta, of which Mr. Carter is a member. The executive committees of the Texas and Virginia state Baptist conventions have rejected the national group's latest doctrinal changes, officials with the national convention said.</p>
        <p>The Texas chapter, which is controlled by moderates, has also proposed to reduce its financial contributions to the national organization. The matter will be decided at its annual meeting next month.</p>
        <p>The former president first discussed his decision in an interview published today in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Carter's letter was being distributed nationally by another moderate Texas group, Texas Baptists Committed, he said he did not wish to influence the vote in that state. Rather, Mr. Carter said, he was thinking of the Georgia state convention next month.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brinkley said: ''In Southern Baptist Convention history, this is a very big moment. The born-again Southern Baptist president breaking with the hierarchy of the church because of their rigidity and dictatorial posturing. I think turmoil will result in the Southern Baptist Convention because of this.''</p>
        <p>Politicians on both sides of the aisle are Southern Baptists, Mr. Brinkley said, from President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore to Senator Trent Lott, Republican of Mississippi.</p>
        <p>''Here's Jimmy Carter questioning their conscience,'' Mr. Brinkley said. ''It's like going to an all-white country club.''</p>
        <p>In the interview and letter, Mr. Carter singled out a provision in the convention's revised creed that called for a literal interpretation of Scripture. He said he feared that interpretations of the Bible would be left to the conservative national leadership, not individuals and their churches.</p>
        <p>''I have been disappointed and feel excluded by the adoption of policies and an increasingly rigid Southern Baptist Convention creed, including some provisions that violate the basic premises of my Christian faith,'' he wrote in the letter, addressed simply ''To My Fellow Baptist.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Carter said he felt no ambivalence about his role at Maranatha because that church did not adhere to all of the doctrines of the convention. It allows women to serve as deacons, he said, and it would not have any problem with a woman as pastor.</p>
        <p>''We have never felt a decision made by the Southern Baptist Convention that was contrary to our church's beliefs was mandatory to us,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In the interview, Mr. Carter said the decision to break from the national convention was painful for him and his wife, Rosalynn. Being a Southern Baptist, he said, has been a natural and unquestioned part of his life.</p>
        <p>''I became a Southern Baptist when I was 11 years old,'' Mr. Carter, now 76, said. ''My father was a Southern Baptist before me and so was my grandfather. Rose's grandfather was a Baptist. We never had questioned that fact before.''</p>
