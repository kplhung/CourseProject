        <p>Mike Piazza has waited through eight seasons in the major leagues for this chance, an opportunity to perform on baseball's biggest stage, and he finally gets his shot at the World Series tonight. But on the eve of Game 1 at Yankee Stadium, Piazza learned he would not be behind the plate. Instead, he will be the Mets' designated hitter while Todd Pratt catches.</p>
        <p>Mets Manager Bobby Valentine approached Piazza during a team workout on Wednesday and broached the possibility of having him be the D.H. in Game 1.

        <p>Mike Piazza has waited through eight seasons in the major leagues for this chance, an opportunity to perform on baseball's biggest stage, and he finally gets his shot at the World Series tonight. But on the eve of Game 1 at Yankee Stadium, Piazza learned he would not be behind the plate. Instead, he will be the Mets' designated hitter while Todd Pratt catches.</p>
        <p>Mets Manager Bobby Valentine approached Piazza during a team workout on Wednesday and broached the possibility of having him be the D.H. in Game 1. Piazza deferred to Valentine and accepted the assignment, allowing the little-used Pratt a bit of the spotlight. The move also places one more right-handed bat in the lineup against the Yankee left-hander Andy Pettitte.</p>
        <p>''He just asked what I thought,'' Piazza said of the discussion with Valentine. ''I said, 'Skip, whatever you want to do.' There's never been any surprises or anything like that. I realize my role on the team, but I also realize I have to do what I'm asked to do. I accept that and keep things very simple in that regard. I just want to win. If we win, have the best lineup and I'm D.H.-ing and we're playing and hitting well as a team then I'll do it the whole series. It doesn't matter.''</p>
        <p>While it might seem odd to see the team's most visible star player left out of his normal spot, it is true that  Pratt is regarded as possessing better defensive skills, having thrown out 14 of 36 base runners this season. On the other hand, with Pratt behind the plate this season, Al Leiter, the Game 1 starter for the Mets, had a 1-2 record with a 6.20 earned run average; with Piazza behind the plate, Leiter was 15-6, with a 2.80 E.R.A.</p>
        <p>In explaining his decision, Valentine said he wanted Pratt in the lineup for Game 1 but didn't want to use him as the D.H.</p>
        <p>''I think he's our next best right-handed hitter,'' Valentine said of Pratt. ''There's a left-handed pitcher tomorrow. Todd Pratt's been a big part of our team for two years and more. I think he's as deserving as any person who's ever put on a uniform to play in a World Series game, and this might be his only opportunity.''</p>
        <p>But against Pettitte, Pratt is 0 for 3, while Bubba Trammell -- who could have served as the right-handed D.H. in Game 1 with Piazza remaining in the lineup as a catcher -- has hit .389 against Pettitte, with three doubles and one home run in 18 at-bats.</p>
        <p>In 1999, Pratt ended the National League division series against Arizona with a 10th-inning home run in Game 4. Although there have been no dramatics this year, Pratt will get another chance tonight.</p>
        <p>''There was only two or three ways he could have went and he chose my way,'' Pratt said. ''I'm proud of that, him having confidence in me. It's a nice feeling, especially the first game, too. It's an honor and shows I've come a long way to be trusted with the pitching staff and starting the first game of one of the most important series that's been played.''</p>
        <p>The D.H. will also be used in Games 2, 6 and 7. The Yankees are expected to use right-handed starters in those games, so it's likely that Piazza will catch each of those games, with left-handed batters like Lenny Harris or Darryl Hamilton serving as the D.H.</p>
        <p>As a designated hitter in interleague games this season, Piazza has done well, going 6 for 18 for a .333 average, with a double, two home runs and four runs batted in.</p>
        <p>''I know I'm going to be catching at Shea,'' he said. ''There's no letdown at all. I know I'm going to get my action behind the plate before this series is over.''</p>
        <p>Words of Choice</p>
        <p>When Benny Agbayani walked into the Mets' clubhouse yesterday to join his teammates for the trip over to Yankee Stadium, he found sympathy for his sudden celebrity. Agbayani was prominently featured in local newspapers -- including the front page of The New York Post -- for his lighthearted prediction on Thursday -- on radio and T.V. -- that the Mets would win the World Series in five games.</p>
        <p>And how did his teammates react to the prediction? ''They said, 'Why not four games?' '' Agbayani said.</p>
        <p>But actually, Agbayani was upset that what he felt started as a joke on the Howard Stern radio show had risen to something more.</p>
        <p>''It kind of makes me mad to see it, like I'm disrespecting Yankee players,'' Agbayani said. ''I'm not doing that. I was joking around. I'm not a predictor. If I was, I wouldn't be playing baseball.''</p>
        <p>His more experienced teammates understood and tried to defend him while cameras swarmed around his locker. ''What do you want him to predict, that we're going to lose in five?'' Piazza said. '' You can spin it any way you want. If we're not confident we're going to win the series, we shouldn't be here. You can spin that as talking trash or whatever. I don't think it is. It'd be one thing if he said it's going to be easy. That would be trash talk. But I don't think it's going to be easy.''</p>
        <p>Darryl Hamilton added, ''That's probably the worst thing about playing in New York -- when you joke around and make a comment like that, it ends up on the front page and it's really blown out of proportion.''</p>
        <p>Medical Update for Cook</p>
        <p>Dennis Cook met with a urologist on Thursday and underwent a second CAT scan to determine the status of the kidney stones that threatened to keep the Mets reliever out of the World Series. He said that one of the kidney stones had passed.</p>
        <p>''The only way I'm not going to be on the roster is if I can't walk,'' he said, adding, ''I guess I can't say that. Bobby and Steve Phillips might say differently.''</p>
