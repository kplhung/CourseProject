        <p>BOONE-Elaine Altieri. Born April 22, 1944 in Corona, New York, died October 15, 2000 in Hilton Head, South Carolina. She lives with joy and inspiration in the hearts of her children Jennifer and Colin, husband Geoffrey, sisters Carol Ann and Vinita, father Vincent, wonderful family and friends. Elaine was graduated Valedictorian of her class with a Bachelor's Degree in Theatre and Communications from Marymount Manhattan College and earned her Master's Degree in Speech Pathology and Audiology from Pennsylvania State University. With her knowledge of American Sign Language, unique creativity and outstanding professional ability Elaine built bridges of communication between children, their families and their world. Throughout her life she remained current in her chosen field of expertise, publishing numerous papers on the latest trends and discoveries in speech and hearing innovations, and was an active member of the American Speech and Hearing Association. She was Executive Director of the Toronto Board of Education's Speech and Hearing Department and worked as a Speech Pathologist at both Beaufort and Hilton Head Elementary Schools. Elaine was a staunch supporter of all auxiliary activities, including Hilton Head Preparatory School's Parent Teacher Association, and wrote articles for Hilton Head Monthly Magazine. Elaine shone on the island stage in productions at both the Hilton Head Playhouse and Self Family Art Center. With equal grace and gusto Elaine brought to all she knew her infectious love of life, and a laughter that rings in our ears to this moment. She is a flame that has brightened every room she has ever entered, and every heart she has ever blessed. To use past tense in reference to her is not accurate, because she is not gone. It is only that her soul outgrew the body we could touch. A memorial service in Toronto, Canada will be held the week of November 20th.</p>
