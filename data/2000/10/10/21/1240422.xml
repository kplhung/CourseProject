        <p>Should men and women ever be segregated at the bridge table?</p>
        <p>Until a decade ago, events in which men and women played separately  were common in American tournaments, both in pairs and teams. Then, as a result of a legal action by a married couple who wished to be able to play together, the American Contract Bridge League abandoned men's events, scheduling all as either ''open'' or ''women's.''</p>
        <p>This followed the practice of international bridge organizations dating back 70 years, based on reality. For reasons that are debatable and often debated, few women can match men at the highest levels of the game. A handful of women played in the World Open Teams in Maastricht, the Netherlands, last month, but  nearly all of them represented small countries with no chance of contending for a medal.</p>
        <p>But change is in the wind. The World Bridge Federation is making a strong effort, with fair prospects of success, for the game to be included in the Winter Olympic Games in Turin, Italy, in 2006. That would mean complying with I.O.C. regulations that require men and women to compete separately. (The only exception is show-jumping, which has an open event only.)</p>
        <p>Men's events may thus return, in a limited way, since hardly any women would favor the elimination of women's events in favor of open competition. This year, American women have won one world title, in Maastricht, and almost won another. They lost the Venice Cup final in Bermuda in January by a heartbreaking 0.5 imp.</p>
        <p>This championship was reported  in a new book, ''1999 Orbis World Championships, Bermuda 2000.'' It is available for $32.95, including mailing, from Baron Barclay Bridge Supplies, (800) 274-2221.</p>
        <p>In the first deal of the Venice Cup semifinal against Denmark, shown in the diagram, the Americans surged into the lead. In both rooms, West contributed a limit raise of one spade to three spades, a slight overbid. Both Norths bid four no-trump, showing length in the minor suits, and both Souths chose clubs.</p>
        <p>The American East, Jill Meyers, judged well by doubling, and her partner, Randi Montin, made a fine choice by leading a trump. She had correctly visualized the possibility of diamond ruffs in the closed hand.</p>
        <p>South won in her hand and led a diamond to the queen and ace. Meyers led a second trump, won in dummy. South could now have escaped for down three and a penalty of 500 if she had ruffed a low diamond. Instead she attempted to cash the diamond queen, and when this was ruffed she was down four, for 800, making only six trump tricks and the spade ace.</p>
        <p>In the replay, the Danish East-West did not double five clubs and defended less effectively. South escaped for down one, and the Americans gained 13 imps.</p>
