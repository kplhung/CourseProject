        <p>Congress recently authorized the first funding increase for the National Endowment for the Humanities in four years. But the increase, a miserly $5 million, will not be enough to make up for years of Congressional stinginess. Nor will it console the directors of major scholarly projects financed by the endowment, who have been warned that they may have to find private money in order to survive.</p>
        <p>The projects include collecting and editing the writings and papers of Henry Thoreau, George Washington and Dwight Eisenhower, as well as dozens of similar editions at colleges and universities across the United States. These are undertakings of real cultural magnitude, involving the writings and papers of some of the most important historical and literary figures in this nation's history. They help anchor the legacy of the past, as well as train future generations of historians and literary scholars. By their very nature, they also take many years to complete.</p>

        <p>Congress recently authorized the first funding increase for the National Endowment for the Humanities in four years. But the increase, a miserly $5 million, will not be enough to make up for years of Congressional stinginess. Nor will it console the directors of major scholarly projects financed by the endowment, who have been warned that they may have to find private money in order to survive.</p>
        <p>The projects include collecting and editing the writings and papers of Henry Thoreau, George Washington and Dwight Eisenhower, as well as dozens of similar editions at colleges and universities across the United States. These are undertakings of real cultural magnitude, involving the writings and papers of some of the most important historical and literary figures in this nation's history. They help anchor the legacy of the past, as well as train future generations of historians and literary scholars. By their very nature, they also take many years to complete.</p>
        <p>They have been in jeopardy since 1996, when Congress cut the endowment's budget by 36 percent. Within the agency, 60 percent of these cuts fell on education and research programs, including those that finance scholarly editions. The endowment's  critics were joined, ironically, by two former N.E.H. directors, William Bennett and Lynne Cheney, wife of the Republican vice-presidential candidate. Mrs. Cheney criticized the N.E.H., which she led from 1986 to 1992, saying the humanities at large had become a bastion of ''gloomy, politically driven, blame-the-West-first revisionism'' that mocked ''the best that is known and thought in the world.''</p>
        <p>For four years the endowment, directed by William Ferris, has wrestled with the consequences of that 1996 funding cycle. What the agency now proposes is to ask the scholars who run the long-term projects it finances to obtain matching funds from private sources. After a period of matching funding, the N.E.H. will then stop the federal money flow altogether.</p>
        <p>What the agency neglects to consider is that each of these scholarly editions already receives more than half its support from the colleges and universities that give them office and library space and pay their salaries. In other words, N.E.H. funding is already more than matched by institutional contributions from other sources. As things stand now, every established edition must reapply for N.E.H. funding as if it were a new project. Meanwhile, the chances of beginning a new scholarly project of this kind with N.E.H. support are practically nil.</p>
        <p>Nothing the N.E.H. can do is more central to its mission than fostering the kind of research and historical enlightenment these editions provide. They preserve and make public this country's intellectual, political and cultural monuments. The irony is that by trying to kill off funding as an expression of conservative ire, Congress and the endowment's critics have made the task of preserving, editing and disseminating ''the best that is known and thought in the world'' nearly impossible. It is time to put these editions on a solid footing, to give them the encouragement they so clearly deserve.</p>
