        <p>While The New York Times plans a new headquarters on Eighth Avenue, New York City preservation officials are planning to designate as a landmark the building at 229 West 43rd Street that has been the newspaper's home since 1913.</p>
        <p>''It is architecturally and historically a significant site,'' said Jennifer J. Raab, the chairwoman of the Landmarks Preservation Commission. ''We're moving toward a designation.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Raab said yesterday that she was having ''very productive conversations'' with The New York Times Company, which rebuffed a proposed landmark designation in 1985, at a time when newspapers were still printed there.</p>
        <p>Catherine J. Mathis, the vice president for corporate communications at the Times Company, confirmed the discussions. ''We are working with Jennifer Raab and the landmarks commission on this designation because we recognize the historical significance of our building,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Last week, The Times announced its choice of the Italian architect Renzo Piano and the Manhattan architectural firm Fox &amp; Fowle to design a 45-story building across Eighth Avenue from the Port Authority Bus Terminal, between 40th and 41st Streets. If the Times's board of directors approves the project, the new tower would be scheduled for completion in 2005.</p>
        <p>That has left open the question of what would become of the white-brick and terra-cotta structure between Broadway and Eighth Avenue from which The Times has reported the news, from the death of Capt. Robert F. Scott in the Antarctic to the attack on the destroyer Cole, through 22 presidential campaigns, 88 World Series and two World Wars.</p>
        <p>The Times will probably sell the building as part of the move to Eighth Avenue, if that project is approved.</p>
        <p>By law, landmarks cannot be demolished, nor can their facades be altered, without the commission's approval. While it is too early to say how landmark status would affect the Times Company or a future owner -- or even whether the entire structure would be designated -- simple development economics suggest that a regulated landmark that was custom-designed for a purpose it no longer serves would be less desirable on the market than an otherwise unencumbered property.</p>
        <p>But it would be difficult, at the same time, to deny the building's local and even national importance.</p>
        <p>The Times's earlier headquarters building at 41 Park Row, overlooking City Hall Park, is already a landmark, as are the former Daily News Building, 220 East 42nd Street; the former New York Sun Building, 280 Broadway; and the former New York Evening Post Building, 20 Vesey Street, where the landmarks commission once had its office.</p>
        <p>The current Times Building is actually four structures in one; three along 43rd Street and one on 44th Street. The first part of it opened in 1913 as an 11-story annex to the Times Tower at Broadway and 42nd Street. It was designed by Buchman &amp; Fox.</p>
        <p>A 1924 design by Ludlow &amp; Peabody, with flourishes borrowed from the 16th-century Chateau de Chambord, expanded the building westward and added three office floors. It also gave the building its pyramidal copper cupola.</p>
        <p>The architect Albert Kahn designed a small west wing in 1931. The building was extended to 44th Street in 1947 with a large but nondescript addition by Shreve, Lamb &amp; Harmon, architects of the Empire State Building.</p>
        <p>With the 43rd Street building facing possible designation in 1985, the Times Company contended in part that its building was a ''manufacturing facility caught in a rapidly evolving, deadline-pressured industry.'' In 1997, however, with the move of printing operations out of Manhattan, the last newspapers rolled off the presses at 43rd Street.</p>
