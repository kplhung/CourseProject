        <p>A day after barely crossing paths with Gov. George W. Bush on his New York visit, Representative Rick A. Lazio said today that he had not tried to distance himself from the Republican presidential candidate. But he also insisted that the Senate race was about his candidacy,  not about other Republicans.</p>
        <p>The two attended the annual Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner on Thursday night but did not appear together for even a photo opportunity. By contrast, Mr. Lazio's opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton, attended a rally with Vice President Al Gore and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman while they were also in the city for the dinner.</p>
        <p>Governor Bush and Mr. Gore have spent little time campaigning in New York during the general election, given that the heavily Democratic state is expected to go for the Gore ticket. At the same time, Mr. Lazio has methodically sought to define himself as a more moderate Republican than Mr. Bush, asserting, for example, that his tax plan would cost less than Mr. Bush's.</p>
        <p>At a campaign stop here today, Mr. Lazio insisted that he was not avoiding Mr. Bush on the campaign trail. ''I'd love to campaign with him in New York,'' the four-term Republican representative said.</p>
        <p>But, he quickly added: ''This is about my record. This isn't about George Bush, Al Gore, Bill Clinton, Newt Gingrich. This is about Rick Lazio and Hillary Clinton.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio made his remarks during a campaign stop at the State University of New York's Albany campus, where he spoke to a large gathering of women who were billed as ''Women for Lazio.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio then traveled to Utica, where he picked up the endorsement of the Oneida County Sheriffs' Deputies Police Benevolent Association.</p>
        <p>The congressman also used his visit here to step up attacks on Mrs. Clinton, using strong language to cast her as a well-heeled outsider who did not share the concerns of average New Yorkers.</p>
        <p>Without mentioning Mrs. Clinton by name, he mocked the fact that she had moved from Washington to the affluent Westchester community of Chappaqua, as well as her claim that she is a longtime Yankee fan. He said that being a New Yorker is ''about a lot more than putting on a Yankee cap and buying a $2 million  house.''</p>
        <p>He tried to cast himself as an ordinary New Yorker, noting that he was ''from a family where you shop for your own food, wash your own clothes and clean your own house, struggle with all the same struggles that average New Yorkers do.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton was not campaigning today. She traveled to Missouri to attend the funeral for Gov. Mel Carnahan, who died in a plane crash earlier this week.</p>
        <p>But her spokesman, Howard Wolfson, retorted, ''Apparently Mr. Lazio's definition of a New Yorker includes insulting your opponent and running an issueless campaign.''</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the candidates agreed today to have a third debate, though that did not prevent squabbling from erupting over who was to blame for almost derailing it. The two candidates are to appear with Gabe Pressman, and the session will be broadcast on NBC on Friday night.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio today accused Mrs. Clinton of having tried to avoid another debate with him. ''Listen,'' he told reporters. ''Mrs. Clinton is not a Yankee. She's not a Met. I think she's a Dodger. I think she's trying to dodge the tough questions. She is dodging the Sunday talk shows. She's trying to dodge the third debate.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Wolfson noted that Mrs. Clinton had also agreed to debate. ''It was our date,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's campaign today also released two television ads, both with Robert Kennedy Jr. endorsing Mrs. Clinton and recalling how his father, who was not a native New Yorker, became a senator from New York.</p>
