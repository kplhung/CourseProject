        <p>GOLDBERG-Arthur M. The Boards, Faculty and Staff of NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University College of Physicians &amp; Surgeons, and the Joan and Sanford I. Weill Medical College of Cornell University are deeply saddened by the passing of our great friend and esteemed Hospital Trustee, Arthur M. Goldberg. Mr. Goldberg became a Trustee of The Presbyterian Hospital in 1996. When it merged with The New York Hospital in 1998, he became a Trustee of the merged institution, serving as Co-Chair of the Human Resources Committee. He was a man of great warmth, vision and courage, who was unfailingly devoted to the support of medical education, research and patient care. Mr. Goldberg's wise counsel and guidance were invaluable. He was much loved and will be truly missed. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his wife, children, and grandchildren.</p>
        <p>GOLDBERG-Arthur. The Anti-Defamation League mourns the untimely passing of our friend and supporter Arthur Goldberg. In May, he received ADL's Special Achievement Award. We extend our deepest condolences to his wife Veronica and the entire family. Howard P. Berkowitz National Chairman Abraham H. Foxman National Director</p>
        <p>GOLDBERG-Arthur. Donald J. Trump mourns the loss of his good friend, Arthur Goldberg. He brought great spirit and energy to the gaming business and used his considerable talents to build a major empire. I had enormous respect and admiration for him, personally and professionally, and will miss him greatly. With deepest condolences to all the members of the Goldberg family.</p>
        <p>GOLDBERG-Arthur, Dear Arthur, You were such an important part of our lives. Our memories of you will never be forgotten. ''Relay'', we will miss you. Our thoughts and prayers are with Ronnie, Kerry and Tarek, Wendy and Derek, Jody and Ed, and Michael. Much love, Lisa and Manny Pearlman</p>
        <p>GOLDBERG-Arthur. A true friend and leader who will be missed dearly. Friends at Monness, Crespi, Hardt</p>
