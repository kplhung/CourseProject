        <p>IN a state that has executed more criminals than any other and earned an international reputation for being relentlessly tough on crime, Ronnie Earle is an anomaly, a soft-spoken prosecutor, more prone to discuss values than vengeance.</p>

        <p>IN a state that has executed more criminals than any other and earned an international reputation for being relentlessly tough on crime, Ronnie Earle is an anomaly, a soft-spoken prosecutor, more prone to discuss values than vengeance.</p>
        <p>Mr. Earle, the Travis County district attorney, has had his share of controversy: his 1996 prosecution of an 11-year-old girl for murdering a 2-year-old baby has been widely criticized. Some said Mr. Earle, a Democrat, was politically motivated when he indicted Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, a Republican, on felony misconduct charges. After a judge limited the evidence prosecutors could present and Mr. Earle refused to put on a case, she was acquitted in 1994.</p>
        <p>His decision last week to re-examine 400  convictions after DNA evidence cleared a man erroneously jailed for nearly 16 years has pushed him into the public eye again and into the vanguard of prosecutors in seeking retroactive justice. (And, in the process, effectively shouldered aside criticism of his office for the false conviction.)</p>
        <p>''Of course, I was worried about people's reactions, knowing we had sentenced this man to prison for something he didn't do, but my major concern was, 'What can we do to set this right? And are there others?' '' Mr. Earle said.</p>
        <p>''The duty of the district attorney is not to convict, but to see that justice is done,'' he said. ''That imposes a burden on the prosecutor to represent the accused as well as the state.''</p>
        <p>''It became apparent that we had to redress the situation as soon as possible,'' he said of the time he learned that an inmate, Carlos Lavernia, was not guilty of a 1983 rape that he had always sworn he did not commit. ''It was terrible. A terrible period, that's the only way to describe it.''</p>
        <p>The idea for a more extensive review to avoid other miscarriages of justice came later.</p>
        <p>''We had been talking for some time about replicating a program they'd started in San Diego to review cases based upon DNA evidence, and we were trying to find a way to structure a process to do that,'' Mr. Earle said. ''After we heard about Lavernia we just decided to kick the project into overdrive.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Earle, 58, grew up near a place that no longer exists called Birdville, eventually overrun by the suburbs of Fort Worth. His father, a part-time cattleman, was a union worker at General Dynamics for 40 years; his mother, a kindergarten teacher.</p>
        <p>After a brief stint in the Texas Legislature, he ran for the district attorney's office in 1976, and has been re-elected to five four-year terms.</p>
        <p>''When I first took office in 1977, I thought my job, my only job, was to be tough on crime,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In 1978 he personally tried two capital murder cases and, he says, consistently chalked up some of the highest conviction rates in the state. But, increasingly, he felt that he was merely reacting to crime instead of preventing it.</p>
        <p>''One thing I learned, working on my father's ranch, was that if you wanted the creek to run clear downstream you had to get the cattle out of the creek upstream,'' Mr. Earle said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Earle said a pivotal experience came in 1979, when a woman told him what had happened after her husband was shot in an act of random violence.</p>
        <p>As she sat alone on a bench outside a hospital emergency room, an attendant strolled past and said, ''Hey, lady, your husband is dead.''</p>
        <p>''She was so angry about the way she'd been treated,'' Mr. Earle said. ''It would have been so much better for her to have an aunt, or a sister or a neighbor with her, helping her deal with this enormous tragedy.''</p>
        <p>Shortly after that he formed the first victim's assistance center in a Texas district attorney's office. Next, there were experiments in community justice, like putting criminals and victims together, under a judge's supervision, to agree on punishment.</p>
        <p>And, over the last two decades his office has created community programs both taking aim at crime and helping its victims, an approach he calls ''tough prosecution, smart prevention.''</p>
        <p>MR. EARLE'S office has a Children's Advocacy Center, a Community Justice Working Group, task forces on sexual assault, family violence, neighborhoods and students, and more than 25 community justice initiatives. And the list is still growing. ''Wait till you hear about my Youth Assessment Center concept,'' he said. ''That spots at-risk kids before they become criminals.''</p>
        <p>And those criminals are also victims, he insists: ''You show me a criminal and I'll show you a victim of child abuse in one form or another. The statistics are overwhelming.''</p>
        <p>His programs have been featured in an influential 1996 book on community building, ''Fixing Broken Windows,'' and cited by the Justice Department as one of the four most innovative criminal justice programs in the country.</p>
        <p>The approach is not soft on crime, he said.</p>
        <p>His office ranks second in the state for sending juveniles into youth prisons, he said, and he scoffed at the notion that teenagers were just learning to become professional criminals there. ''Most of them are better off there than in their own homes,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''That's the tough prosecution part,'' he said. ''There's only so much you can do with a violent kid. You've got to get him out of his environment, his neighborhood, and into something different.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Earle's programs are not always popular, even his recent decision to re-examine the 400 cases for potential new DNA evidence. ''I've been from reactive, to proactive, to what I now call interactive,'' he said. ''We've just got to keep trying to do better.''</p>
        <p>There has been resistance to some of his efforts, he said, often from the very social service agencies he is trying to energize. ''We had one program,'' he said, ''that put the cops working with social workers on a daily basis, and a police captain told me, 'My guys will never walk a beat with those social workers.' ''</p>
        <p>''Well, do you know what?'' he said, ''six weeks later they were all dating each other.''</p>
