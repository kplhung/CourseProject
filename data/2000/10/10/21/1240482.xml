        <p>Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and his wife, Laura, reported income of $1,610,400 last year and paid $449,827, or 27.9 percent of that amount, in federal income taxes, their 1999 tax return, which his campaign made public last night, showed.</p>
        <p>The return was filed by the Northern Trust Company in Chicago on Oct. 15, the final deadline for 1999 returns.</p>
        <p>The Bushes created a blind trust with Northern Trust under federal rules in anticipation of his possible election, and company officers signed the return on behalf of the couple.</p>
        <p>The blind trust holds about half of the governor's assets, said Robert McCleskey, an accountant from Midland, Tex., who prepared the couple's tax returns until the trust was created.</p>
        <p>Taxable interest, primarily from Treasury notes and bonds, accounted for $781,051 of the couple's income. They had tax-exempt interest of $1,861 from municipal bonds.</p>
        <p>The Bushes also reported $546,380 in capital gains, $173 profit from the governor's oil business and a $21,174 real estate loss.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush received $130,000 as his share of the advance for ''A Charge to Keep'' the book, published last year by William Morrow &amp; Company, which he wrote with Karen P. Hughes, his communications director.</p>
        <p>The entire advance was donated to the Boys and Girls Clubs, Dan Bartlett, a campaign spokesman, said last night.</p>
        <p>The Bushes made a total of $210,165 in charitable donations.</p>
        <p>The salary for a Texas governor last year was $115,345, but Mr. Bush relinquished 55 days of pay because he was out of the state campaigning, lowering his state salary to $97,964, his office said last April when the couple made a $50,000 payment on their tax bill and filed for an automatic four-month extension to file their tax return.</p>
        <p>In August the Bushes asked for a second extension, to Oct. 15, because they had not received partnership reports needed to complete the return.</p>
        <p>The Bushes applied their $125,917 overpayment to taxes they would owe for the 2000 tax year.</p>
        <p>Their 1999 income was less than a tenth of what they received in 1998.</p>
        <p>That year the couple reported income of $18,405,524, on which they paid federal taxes of $3,772,252, or 20.5 percent.</p>
        <p>Most of their 1998 income came from long-term capital gains, which are taxed at 20 percent, and nearly all of that resulted from a $600,000 investment in the Texas Rangers baseball team.</p>
        <p>That investment grew in value by a factor of 25, to $15 million, when the partnership that owned the team, led by Tom Hicks, a leveraged buyout specialist, sold the Rangers for $250 million.</p>
