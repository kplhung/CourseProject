        <p>At Carnegie Hall this season comes what it calls a ''Focus on Stravinsky'': a good way to mark the end of the century he so dominated and an opportunity to get to know pieces that are still seldom performed. The St. Louis Symphony's concerts on Wednesday and Thursday included a few of these, among them the ''Ode'' and the ''Circus Polka,'' both from the early 1940's, when the composer had recently arrived in the United States and did not know quite what to do with himself here, and also, from an earlier period, the Four Studies and ''The Song of the Nightingale.''</p>
        <p>The more familiar works, ''Petrushka'' and ''The Rite of Spring,'' were well chosen to go with these rarities, or vice versa. The ''Chinese March'' in ''The Song of the Nightingale'' is cousin to the ''Russian Dance'' in ''Petrushka,'' both being bright and gleeful successions of national musical characteristics. At other points ''The Song of the Nightingale,'' an exuberant symphonic poem drawn from Stravinsky's first opera, remembers his recent ''Rite of Spring'' with almost perfect accuracy.</p>

        <p>At Carnegie Hall this season comes what it calls a ''Focus on Stravinsky'': a good way to mark the end of the century he so dominated and an opportunity to get to know pieces that are still seldom performed. The St. Louis Symphony's concerts on Wednesday and Thursday included a few of these, among them the ''Ode'' and the ''Circus Polka,'' both from the early 1940's, when the composer had recently arrived in the United States and did not know quite what to do with himself here, and also, from an earlier period, the Four Studies and ''The Song of the Nightingale.''</p>
        <p>The more familiar works, ''Petrushka'' and ''The Rite of Spring,'' were well chosen to go with these rarities, or vice versa. The ''Chinese March'' in ''The Song of the Nightingale'' is cousin to the ''Russian Dance'' in ''Petrushka,'' both being bright and gleeful successions of national musical characteristics. At other points ''The Song of the Nightingale,'' an exuberant symphonic poem drawn from Stravinsky's first opera, remembers his recent ''Rite of Spring'' with almost perfect accuracy.</p>
        <p>Perfection, too, has come to be expected when orchestras turn to remembering this score. On Wednesday there was something less. But there was not as much less as there had been in the preceding performance of ''Apollo.'' In that piece, scored for strings, the players declined to accept the composer's invitations to humor, liveliness of line, what he called ''multisonorous euphony'' or, on a more basic level, precision of ensemble.</p>
        <p>''The Rite of Spring'' had some of the same problems of ensemble, and suffered a little -- it is not all loud -- from the orchestra's difficulty in reaching low-level dynamics. There were some beautiful very quiet moments, in this score as in the third of the Four Studies and ''Petrushka,'' but regular quietness tended to be overplayed.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, the ''Rite'' perhaps ought to feel like a stretch. Most orchestras these days play it like a showpiece. The St. Louis musicians, under their music director, Hans Vonk, found the awkwardness in the score, the violence, the anger.</p>
        <p>Their concert together the next night was more settled, and in the major works -- ''Petrushka,'' ''Ode'' and ''The Song of the Nightingale'' -- came wonderful things from soloists and small ensembles. The bassoons at the end of the ''Chinese March'' made a very characterful sound, like water circling and gurgling down a plug hole, and the solo bassoon interjections in ''Petrushka'' brought appreciative chuckles from the audience, as they deserved to.</p>
        <p>Also excelling in their moments were the trumpets, flute, high clarinet and percussion in ''Petrushka,'' the humorous clarinet in ''Ode'' and the tight, exotic oboe in ''The Song of the Nightingale.'' But the ensemble remained occasionally awry, and the musicians found it hard to inject as much life into regular rhythms as into irregular.</p>
        <p>Mr. Vonk, though, was making no allowances, and took some of the final scene of ''Petrushka'' at a hectic pace.</p>
        <p>That same evening it was odd -- midway through an orchestral program, and with the orchestra on stage -- to present a little song for soprano and piano: ''The Owl and the Pussy-Cat.'' Carmen Pelton, singing warmly, well and unaffectedly, showed how much of Anne Trulove, the heroine of Stravinsky's Neo-Classical opera, remains in this serial miniature of a decade and a half later. As the season goes on, no doubt, more connections will appear.</p>
