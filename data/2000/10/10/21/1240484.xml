        <p>THE POLLS</p>
        <p>A SURPRISE OF THE SEASON  Minnesota, the state of Hubert H. Humphrey, Eugene J. McCarthy and Walter F. Mondale, which has gone Democratic in every presidential election since 1972, is suddenly too close to call. A poll published yesterday by The Star Tribune of Minneapolis showed Gov. George W. Bush slightly ahead of Vice President Al Gore. (''That's no misprint,'' the newspaper felt compelled to note.) The poll questioned 814 likely voters from last Saturday through Wednesday and found Mr. Bush leading Mr. Gore by 44 percent to 41 percent. Although that lead was within the 3.4-percentage-point margin of sampling error, Dick Cheney, who happened to be in the Minneapolis area, seized on the news. Holding aloft the paper's banner headline, ''Bush snatches lead from Gore,'' he said he had called Bush campaign headquarters to declare: ''Check Minnesota into our column. We personally have delivered this state.''</p>

        <p>THE ADVOCACY GROUPS</p>
        <p>THANKS FOR LEAVING  Term-limits advocates often castigate candidates who refuse to pledge to serve only a few terms or who break such pledges once in office. But this week U.S. Term Limits, joined by the Cato Institute, took a new approach to those pledges, bestowing commemorative plaques and gifts on seven House members, all Republicans, who are fulfilling theirs this year.</p>
        <p>Those honored: Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, Mark Sanford of South Carolina, Matt Salmon of Arizona, Helen Chenoweth-Hage of Idaho, Jack Metcalf of Washington, and Charles T. Canady and Tillie Fowler of Florida.</p>
        <p>The gifts: Biographies of George Washington, the hero of the term-limits  movement because he voluntarily returned to private life after two terms in office.</p>

        <p>THE GREEN PARTY</p>
        <p>NADER, NUDGED, SAYS NO  A dozen old Nader's Raiders are urging Ralph Nader to reassess his presidential campaign, saying he could cost Vice President Al Gore the election. Mr. Nader's support is some 3 percent to 4 percent in most national polls, causing some Democrats to fear that he could win enough votes in some close states to push them into the Bush column. ''It is now clear that you might well give the White House to Bush,'' the group wrote in an open letter to Mr. Nader yesterday. ''As a result, you would set back significantly the social progress to which you have devoted your entire, astonishing career.'' The group, Nader's Raiders for Gore, accused him of reneging on a promise to campaign only in states where his candidacy would not hurt Mr. Gore's chances.His press secretary, Laura Jones, rejected the appeal. ''There are always a few,'' she said, ''who lose their zest and will to fight for progressive ideas and settle for moderate conservatives like Al Gore.''</p>

        <p>TRAVEL LOG</p>
        <p>Vice President Al Gore, President Clinton and their wives had a warm photo-opportunity reunion on an airport runway in Missouri, while Gov. George W. Bush and Senator John McCain hooked up at a rally in Maine. An earlier meeting between the Republican former rivals, in New Hampshire, was called off because Mr. McCain had food poisoning. The stats:</p>
        <p>Length of official day: Gore, 16 hours; Bush, 13 hours.</p>
        <p>Cities/towns visited: Gore, 3; Bush, 3.</p>
        <p>Official events: Gore, 3; Bush, 3.</p>
        <p>Main message: Gore, in distancing himself from President Clinton, proclaiming again that he is his ''own candidate''; Bush, government reform.</p>
