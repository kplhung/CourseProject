        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I enjoyed your report on the work of the ''sociologists'' of baseball who have tried to identify the distinction between Met fans and Yankee fans (front page, Oct. 19). But as one who grew up a Brooklyn Dodger fan, I think they overlook the obvious.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I enjoyed your report on the work of the ''sociologists'' of baseball who have tried to identify the distinction between Met fans and Yankee fans (front page, Oct. 19). But as one who grew up a Brooklyn Dodger fan, I think they overlook the obvious.</p>
        <p>Met fans, like the Dodger fans of the pre-1957 era, revel in the drama and humanity of a talented team that snatches defeat from the jaws of victory with frightening consistency.  Their victories, when they do come, are certain to be sweeter than those enjoyed regularly by the fans of the equally talented but very tightly wrapped Yankees.</p>
        <p>For Yankee fans, it's all about winning. When their team loses, they seem to share its owner's anger and sense of betrayal, a far cry from the hope of ''wait till next year.'' It's almost enough to make me feel sorry for the Yankee players -- but not quite.</p>
