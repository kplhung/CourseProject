        <p>Nebraskans will vote this Election Day on the country's most sweeping effort to bar gay unions, a proposed amendment to the state Constitution that not only bans gay marriages but also declares same-sex civil unions and domestic partnerships invalid.</p>
        <p>Polls show that the measure has a good chance of passing.</p>
        <p>Supporters of the proposed amendment have been helped by a coalition of national Roman Catholic, Mormon and evangelical groups and out-of-state contributors. Less than 6 percent of the more than $500,000 donated to support the amendment has come from Nebraska residents. Opponents have raised about $100,000, most of it from Nebraskans.</p>
        <p>Still, the battle is heating up. In recent days, the state's major newspapers have editorialized against the amendment. Leaders of some churches and synagogues have voiced opposition. And the interim chancellor of the University of Nebraska spoke against the amendment, saying it could discourage employees and businesses from moving to the state.</p>
        <p>Opponents say they fear that the amendment would dissuade employers and insurers from offering health benefits for same-sex partners. And they are concerned that government agencies, hospitals and other institutions would interpret it to mean, for instance, that gays could be prevented from making decisions about their hospitalized partners or from adopting their partners' children.</p>
        <p>''It shoves lesbians and gay Nebraskans out of every family protection in Nebraska, large or small,'' said Evan Wolfson, director of the marriage project for the Lambda Legal Defense Fund. ''And it is intended to cast a cloud over private sector measures to assist gay and lesbian families as well.''</p>
        <p>Both sides expect a court challenge if the measure passes.</p>
        <p>The proposal, Initiative 416, reads: ''Only marriage between a man and a woman shall be valid or recognized in Nebraska. The uniting of two persons of the same sex in a civil union, domestic partnership or other similar same-sex relationship shall not be valid or recognized in Nebraska.''</p>
        <p>Proponents call the measure a response to a court decision last year in Vermont that stopped short of legalizing gay marriage but held that gay couples were entitled to the same benefits as heterosexual ones. This spring, to comply with the ruling, the Vermont Legislature passed a law recognizing ''civil unions'' for homosexuals.</p>
        <p>Backers of Initiative 416 say they fear that gay couples might enter into civil unions in Vermont or another state that adopts a similar law and seek to have Nebraska recognize the unions.</p>
        <p>''Because of the action in Vermont, we really feel we've been forced to adopt this language to close this loophole,'' said Dan Parsons, a spokesman for the Nebraska Coalition for the Protection of Marriage, the group leading the campaign for the amendment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Parsons said the movement by gay advocates to persuade other states to copy Vermont ''will place our definition of marriage at risk.''</p>
        <p>Thirty-three states have passed what they call ''defense of marriage acts,'' which generally specify that only marriage between a man and a woman is valid.</p>
        <p>Lesbian and gay activists say some states have used the laws to deny gay couples access to benefits enjoyed by heterosexual ones. In Idaho, a judge invoked the state's marriage law in refusing to allow a lesbian to adopt her partner's child.</p>
        <p>But with the Nebraska amendment, opponents say, the language is so broad that it is unclear how it would be applied.</p>
        <p>''My binding contracts, my power of attorney, wills and medical directives will be viewed as contracts or partnerships between two people of the same sex and no longer be recognized or valid in the state of Nebraska,'' said M. J. McBride, a campaign coordinator with Nebraskans Against 416.</p>
        <p>Tension over the issue of same-sex unions has simmered for several years in Nebraska. Since 1996, bills to ban gay marriage have been introduced in the Legislature, sponsored by more than half the senators, only to be blocked.</p>
        <p>But Initiative 416 seems to have greater momentum. In an Omaha World-Herald poll in mid-September, 59 percent of voters surveyed said they would support the measure; 34 percent said they would oppose it.</p>
        <p>The undecided are being lobbied by a glossy television commercial that features a panorama of wedding portraits arranged on a mantle. And they are being courted by a coalition led by a former Republican governor, Kay A. Orr. Though Mrs. Orr is the most prominent voice for the amendment, she declined to be interviewed.</p>
        <p>''I don't feel it advances our cause to be a part of any other newspaper article outside of Nebraska,'' Mrs. Orr said.</p>
        <p>Both candidates in a tightly contested race for an open seat in the United States Senate -- Don Stenberg, the Republican, who is the state's attorney general, and Ben Nelson, the Democrat, who is a former governor -- also support the amendment.</p>
        <p>At a recent news conference, Mr. Stenberg was asked why a relationship between two men could not be as strong as a heterosexual union.</p>
        <p>''Or a man and a dog can get married?'' Mr. Stenberg replied. ''Where are you going to draw the line? A son and a mother? A father and a daughter?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Nelson supports the amendment, even though the leaders of his party and Bob Kerrey, the retiring Democratic senator, believe it discriminates against gays.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nelson said in an interview that while he believed ''we should be tolerant of people, even if we disagree with them,'' he backed Initiative 416 because ''it makes a statement for traditional marriage'' and because he was taught that a homosexual union ''was not a moral relationship.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Parsons, the spokesman for the group behind the amendment, said proponents were ''not trying -- even if we wanted to -- to dictate relationships.''</p>
        <p>''This is not about bigotry,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But opponents say the measure is already having negative effects.</p>
        <p>Harvey Perlman, interim chancellor of the University of Nebraska, said applicants for faculty and administrative posts had expressed concern about Initiative 416. Mr. Perlman said he believed the measure ''would hurt employers generally in Nebraska trying to recruit a skilled work force.''</p>
        <p>Several companies in Nebraska said they would continue to offer domestic-partner benefits. But even some businesses that do not offer such benefits said the amendment might discourage some employees from moving there.</p>
        <p>''It's hard to recruit to the Midwest anyway, and this won't make it any easier,'' said Mark Ebes, director of employment for First Data Resources in Omaha, which does not offer domestic-partner benefits.</p>
        <p>Because under other Nebraska laws, the phrase ''domestic partnership'' also refers to business partnerships formed within the state, opponents of Initiative 416 claim it could be interpreted to end businesses like a father-son farming operation. The measure's proponents say it is clear that those relationships are not what the amendment is addressing.</p>
