        <p>A counteroffer from General Electric's chairman, John F. Welch Jr., broke up United Technologies' deal to buy Honeywell International yesterday, setting off a rush of activity as other suitors considered bidding for all or part of Honeywell.</p>
        <p>Siemens A.G. of Germany, for one, is weighing its options, according to executives close to the company. And, while the acquisition-minded Tyco International denied that it planned to bid for Honeywell, executives close to Tyco said it might bid on the parts of Honeywell that G.E. or another suitor might not want.</p>
        <p>Honeywell was silent yesterday, and its board is expected to meet over the weekend to discuss all of its options.</p>
        <p>General Electric was no more forthcoming. ''There's nothing we can say, so I decline comment,'' said Gary Sheffer, a G.E. spokesman. Mr. Welch faxed his offer to Honeywell's management before Honeywell's board met to consider the $40.3 billion bid from United Technologies. When United Technologies learned of the G.E. approach, it withdrew its offer rather than get into a bidding war. Executives close to the deal say United Technologies is unlikely to rejoin the fray.</p>
        <p>By midafternoon analysts and investors alike seemed to believe that G.E. would be the ultimate winner.</p>
        <p>Honeywell stock, which had been steadily climbing all morning as investors waited for confirmation of the United Technologies deal, continued its steady ascent after that deal was scuttled. Honeywell closed at $47, up $10.88.</p>
        <p>Shares of G.E., meanwhile, took a beating after news of its bid for Honeywell emerged, closing down $3.13, to $52.50. Stock of United Technologies, which was down as much as $7 when the purchase of Honeywell seemed imminent, regained some of its lost ground. It closed at $65, down $3.</p>
        <p>Although analysts would still like to see United Technologies grow by acquisition, most say the company remains on solid ground without a deal.</p>
        <p>Parts of Honeywell are as good a fit for G.E., which is based in Fairfield, Conn., as they were for United Technologies. Both G.E. and Honeywell make plastics and chemicals and power generation systems. GE Aircraft Engines is a major player in wide-bodied jets and other commercial aircraft, while Honeywell's strength is in avionics and business jet engines. Both companies make regional aircraft engines, but the overlap is smaller than it would have been between Honeywell and United Technologies' Pratt &amp; Whitney unit.</p>
        <p>''You can definitely see some synergy,'' said Sean Katof, a portfolio manager for the Invesco Funds, which owns shares in Honeywell.</p>
        <p>The two companies are a good cultural fit as well. Honeywell was formed in January by the merger of Honeywell Inc. and Allied Signal, which had been run by Lawrence Bossidy, a former protege of Mr. Welch. Both companies have implemented Six Sigma, a complex quality- control method. Both companies have moved heavily into Internet sales. And Mr. Bossidy and Mr. Welch share a brusque, no-nonsense management style.</p>
        <p>Although Michael R. Bonsignore, who was chief of the pre-merger Honeywell, heads the merged company, analysts say it still bears Mr. Bossidy's cultural imprint.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, G.E.'s bid surprised many analysts in that Mr. Welch has often said he wanted G.E. to concentrate on increasing services, not products. Still, G.E.'s industrial businesses were huge contributors to its revenue and profit this year. Moreover, maintenance and service contracts are a growing part of the revenue for aircraft engine companies, and Honeywell has been stressing services as well.</p>
        <p>The fit between G.E. and Honeywell's home and building controls is not as evident. But, analysts say any deal between G.E. and Honeywell may well involve selling that part of the business.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bonsignore's fate if the deal goes through is unclear. Mr. Welch, who is retiring in April, has already named three potential successors: Robert L. Nardelli, head of GE Power Systems; Jeffrey R. Immelt, head of GE Medical Systems; and W. James McNerney Jr., head of GE Aircraft Engines. Most analysts expect Mr. Immelt to get the nod.</p>
        <p>But analysts have been speculating for weeks that Honeywell's board was trying to woo Mr. Nardelli to replace Mr. Bonsignore. And, Mr. Welch would be more likely to put Mr. McNerney in charge of the expanded aircraft business.</p>
        <p>In hindsight, many analysts and investors wondered if Honeywell had expected the United Technologies merger to be upended all along. Several theorized that Mr. Bossidy, who retired from Honeywell's board on April 1 but remains a large shareholder, might have been orchestrating a bidding war.</p>
        <p>''He was introducing eBay to the M.&amp; A. game,'' one person said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bossidy could not be reached yesterday, but those who know him say he is quite proud of having built Allied Signal, once a bloated conglomerate, into a highly profitable, trimmed-down company. When the newly merged company began having earnings difficulties this year -- and its share price plunged from the mid-$50's to the mid-$30's -- they say Mr. Bossidy's ego as well as his pocketbook were suffering. People close to Mr. Bossidy say he was probably prodding Mr. Bonsignore to sell the company.</p>
        <p>Mr. Welch was at the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday to celebrate with Wipro, a small company that G.E. has a joint venture with and that had just been listed. A reporter from CNBC -- which is owned by G.E. -- asked Mr. Welch on camera what he thought of the United Technologies-Honeywell deal. ''It is an interesting rumor,'' he said. Would G.E. be interested in bidding? ''Every day we have merger thoughts and discussions,'' he responded.</p>
        <p>He did not say no.</p>
