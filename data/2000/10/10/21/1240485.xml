        <p>A lawyer for Michael C. Skakel, the Kennedy relative charged with the 1975 killing of Martha Moxley, made one last effort today to keep the case in juvenile court, trying to counter a court-ordered background report that seems to suggest Mr. Skakel should be tried as an adult.</p>
        <p>At a hearing here, the lawyer, Michael Sherman, argued that the confidential background report on Mr. Skakel did not properly take into account his life history, especially his relatively uneventful adulthood over the last two decades.</p>
        <p>Mr. Skakel, 40, is charged as a juvenile in the case because he was 15 when Miss Moxley, also 15, his friend and neighbor, was found bludgeoned to death in her family's yard in Greenwich.</p>
        <p>The juvenile court judge hearing the case, Maureen D. Dennis, has already found ''reasonable cause'' that Mr. Skakel committed the crime, and must now decide whether he should be tried in Superior Court as an adult.</p>
        <p>Her long-awaited decision is crucial. Conviction in Superior Court could mean a sentence of life in prison, while conviction as a juvenile could bring no jail time at all. The lead prosecutor has said that if the case is not moved to adult court, he will be forced to consider dropping the charges. And Mr. Sherman, the defense lawyer, has argued vigorously against the transfer.</p>
        <p>Mr. Skakel, who has long been a suspect in the case but was arrested and charged only this year, maintains his innocence. And even as Mr. Sherman has fought to keep the case in juvenile court, he has expressed confidence that his client will be acquitted either way.</p>
        <p>The background report, prepared by a juvenile probation supervisor, was required under state law as it existed in 1975, to help Judge Dennis determine whether Mr. Skakel's case meets other criteria -- in addition to her finding of reasonable cause -- for transfer to adult court. The law says the report should examine ''the parentage and surroundings of the child, his age, habits, and history'' among other factors.</p>
        <p>But at today's hearing, the author of the report testified that he included little personal information about Mr. Skakel, a nephew of Ethel Kennedy's, and focused instead on the lack of any prison or rehabilitation program in the state's juvenile justice system for an adult convicted of murder as a juvenile. The omission of personal data suggests that the report gives Judge Dennis little reason to keep the case in juvenile court.</p>
        <p>The hearing was held at Mr. Sherman's request, under court rules that entitled him  to address the contents of the report. He called four witnesses, including Joseph H. Pequin Jr., a veteran probation supervisor for juvenile matters who prepared the report.</p>
        <p>In his testimony, Mr. Pequin acknowledged that his report did not include personal history or the results of any physical or mental examination of Mr. Skakel. He said he did not interview Mr. Skakel or his father, Rushton Skakel Sr.</p>
        <p>''There wasn't much that I felt was relevant,'' Mr. Pequin said.</p>
        <p>Because Mr. Skakel is no longer of school age, no education records were included, Mr. Pequin said. And although the law states that the court can order ''a complete physical or mental examination'' of the defendant, Judge Dennis apparently did not request either.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pequin said the most important part of his inquiry was a phone call to the warden of the state's only detention center for serious juvenile offenders, Long Lane School in Middletown. He testified that the warden, John Lachapelle, reported that ''the Connecticut Department of Children and Families is unable to meet the needs of a child after 18.''</p>
        <p>The criteria for transferring the case to adult court include the lack of a state institution for the care and treatment of children to which Mr. Skakel could be sentenced.</p>
        <p>The lead prosecutor, State's Attorney Jonathan C. Benedict, appeared confident that the report bolstered his efforts to get the case transferred to Superior Court. He did not call any witnesses today.</p>
        <p>In addition to Mr. Pequin, Mr. Sherman questioned Joseph Arsenault, a professor at Curry College in Milton, Mass., who knew Mr. Skakel when he was a student there in the 1980's.</p>
        <p>Mr. Arsenault testified that Mr. Skakel suffered from dyslexia and was a recovering alcoholic. He also testified that he did not believe that Mr. Skakel posed any danger to society.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sherman also questioned Clinton Roberts, a former state probation officer who now owns a consulting firm hired by defense lawyers to research alternative sentencing possibilities.</p>
        <p>Mr. Roberts testified that the Apt Foundation, in Newtown, Conn., runs two residential treatment programs for juveniles and adults, suggesting a 24-month program that Mr. Skakel could be sentenced to as a juvenile.</p>
        <p>Mr. Roberts also testified that the state had often placed juvenile offenders with ''special needs'' in detention programs out of state. Mr. Sherman argued that Mr. Skakel is ''a special needs'' juvenile because of his age.</p>
        <p>''It may sound silly,'' Mr. Sherman said in his closing statement. ''But it's the truth: Mr. Skakel is a juvenile with special needs. He is 40 years old. That's his special need.''</p>
        <p>For the first time since regular hearings began in the case last spring, Mr. Skakel appeared at ease in the courtroom. During recesses, he smiled frequently while chatting with relatives, including his brother Stephen, who had come to support him.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sherman's last witness was Bernadette Coomaraswamy, a juvenile justice expert, who testified during Mr. Skakel's reasonable cause hearing in June. Mrs. Coomaraswamy again said that the goal of juvenile justice in the 1970's was rehabilitation rather than punishment.</p>
        <p>In closing, Mr. Benedict, the prosecutor, conceded that Mr. Skakel posed little danger to society now but urged the judge to consider the more recent emphasis in juvenile justice on harsher punishment.</p>
        <p>''The only appropriate venue to resolve this tragic case,'' Mr. Benedict said, ''is the Superior Court.''</p>
