        <p>And so on Tuesday night, we finally got what the talking heads had promised -- ''the knockout punch'' settling this interminable battle once and for all. The definitive blow was administered by David Justice, whose three-run homer insured a Subway Series possibly even more riveting than the other high New York drama of the night, Donna Hanover's much-awaited debut in ''The Vagina Monologues.''</p>
        <p>As for Tuesday's other sporting event, the testosterone monologues delivered under the guise of a final presidential debate, it settled little except the fact that the buffet freeloaders and fame-seekers who appear on the networks as undecided voters are so dim (and wardrobe-challenged) that even ''Big Brother'' might turn them away. If the country's future is truly in their mentally idle hands -- one man in CBS's focus group bitterly chastised both candidates for not ''talk[ing] enough about teaching reading'' -- Wall Street's meltdown has only just begun.</p>
        <p>The pundits' incantatory verdict on debate 3 says Al Gore won ''on points,'' but didn't much affect the tightest horse race in 40 years. That's true, but I do think there was a single clear-cut winner in this and maybe all three debates -- the elephant (albeit Democratic) in the room, Bill Clinton. Though his name has barely been mentioned -- and on Tuesday only by George W. Bush, who also applauded the president for his efforts at Sharm el Sheik -- his shadow loomed large over almost every exchange. Mr. Gore's persistently ineffectual boxing with that shadow, rather than his fisticuffs with Mr. Bush, may yet determine his fate as we slouch toward a potential record-low turnout on Nov. 7.</p>
        <p>The trick this year has been for a candidate to harness himself to the virtues of a president whose job approval rating remains high (60 percent) while staying clear of his personal failings. This should have been a lock for Mr. Gore, an impeccable family man who was, after all, a partner in a presidency that has presided over skyrocketing employment and home ownership and plummeting welfare rolls and crime rates. But the vice president is so intent on shucking the ''bad'' Clinton that he has rarely capitalized on the ''good'' Clinton. He doesn't seem to realize that the president's residual popularity is such that in a hypothetical Clinton-Bush match-up in an ABC News poll this month Mr. Bush was behind by five points. When Darrell Hammond, who also impersonates Mr. Gore, revived his Clinton-as-scamp on ''Saturday Night Live'' last weekend, the audience welcomed him back like a conquering hero.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore and Mr. Clinton aren't buddies these days, as Melinda Henneberger and Don Van Natta Jr. chronicled in yesterday's Times. The Gore command has not only debated the value of Mr. Clinton's making a last-minute campaign blitz to mobilize the party faithful, but doesn't want the two men appearing together in any case. A far more damaging image, though, has been Mr. Gore's visible, Hamlet-like vacillation about the president during the debates. The vice president rarely trumpets his own administration's record -- lest he get caught mentioning the dread ''C'' word in prime time. This may be his way of proving that he is his ''own man,'' but it makes him look more condescending to voters than his sighs and eye-rolling ever did -- for the implication is that we're as dumb as those on-air focus groups and don't remember where he's been, for better and worse, for the past eight years.</p>
        <p>At the same time Mr. Gore has gone berserk in trying to prove that he's no Clintonesque cad (as if anyone thought he was). From the overheated disowning of a congresswoman's convention-week fund-raiser at the Playboy Mansion to the excessive use of his wife and children as props to his lofty rhetoric about ''values'' (five such vacuous sermonettes in debate 2 alone), this campaign is not only holier-than-thou but preachier than William Bennett flogging a book of virtues. Mr. Gore's incorrigible running mate, Joe Lieberman, has now taken to invoking Scripture to back up his stands on health care and environmentalism.</p>
        <p>As Joan Didion writes in the current New York Review of Books, the Democrats have fallen into the same ''fatal eddy'' that the Republicans did in '98 -- buying into the Washington establishment's still completely unproven conviction that you can win elections running as moral paragons against Bill Clinton's sins. Not only did the G.O.P. lose seats at the height of the impeachment frenzy with this tactic, but almost every prominent religious-right disciple went down to defeat then too. (It apparently isn't working in New York's Senate race this year, either.)</p>
        <p>Incredibly, Mr. Bush -- a candidate with minimal grasp of policy (his own positions often included) -- has figured this out (or at least his handlers have). When he incessantly promises, as he did on Tuesday, to ''change the tone'' in a Washington marked by ''bickering'' and ''bitterness'' and ''arguing,'' what is he attacking if not the Gingrich Congress that shut down the government and tried to run Mr. Clinton out of town? Thus does Mr. Bush ingeniously, if disingenuously, triangulate in the most shameless Clintonesque manner -- making himself look like more of a foe of such Washington Clinton-haters as Tom DeLay and Dan Burton than Mr. Gore is.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush has also cunningly hijacked some of the Clinton rhetorical playbook that defeated his father in '92. In the debate held eight years ago at this week's site, Washington University in St. Louis, the then-Governor Clinton talked, as George W. now does, of how he wanted to ''bring this country together, not divide it,'' and of how ''Congress is hungry for someone who will work with them instead of manipulate them.'' It was also in the '92 debates that Mr. Clinton boasted of how he had worked with Republicans and Democrats in his own state to find ''common-sense'' solutions to ''the real problems of real people.'' Though Mr. Bush stops short of saying that he feels anyone's pain, he talked about the love in his heart so often on Tuesday that John Podhoretz, a Bush supporter, wrote in The New York Post that it was ''enough to make your skin crawl.'' The Texas governor also promises an administration with ''people who represent all America'' -- his modest variation on the Clinton promise of one that ''looks like America.''</p>
        <p>It may all be hooey -- Mr. Bush's current administration doesn't even reflect the minority demographics of Texas -- but it reminds people, at least subliminably (as he might say), of what they liked (and may still like) about Mr. Clinton. The cosmetic Clintonization of Mr. Bush has been so effective that the latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll finds that voters ''who approve of Clinton's job performance but do not like him personally'' prefer Bush to Gore by 55 to 24. Only a month ago the Bush-Gore margin in this same group and poll was a narrow 42 to 37.</p>
        <p>Democrats anticipating the worst are starting to look for scapegoats. If an incumbent vice president loses at a time of peace and prosperity to an opponent with modest achievements, a wealthy scion's work ethic (9-to-5 days punctuated by long runs and photo ops, according to Texas records) and a tendency to speak in tongues, it must be Ralph Nader's fault, or Jim Lehrer's, or a press that lets Mr. Bush get away with fibs far more substantive than Mr. Gore's exaggerations. If the vice president himself is faulted by his own partisans, it's usually only for superficial failings -- mainly his grating personality makeovers.</p>
        <p>But it's not that simple. If Mr. Bush epitomizes the consistency of small minds as he offers boilerplate, banalities and evasions to almost any question put to him, Mr. Gore epitomizes the paralysis that can befall even a fertile mind that is in abject, craven fear of giving offense. In his own way the vice president can be as inarticulate as Mr. Bush -- witness his inability in the debates to clearly differentiate his position on gun control, or to use any of his digressions to challenge the single most chilling moment of the entire campaign, the governor's grinning (and, as it turned out, inaccurate) boast of how Texas would ''put to death'' all three men who murdered James Byrd. It took an ordinary citizen in the final debate to find the courage to call Mr. Bush on his inhumanity, and even then Mr. Gore never did pick up the theme.</p>
        <p>Bill Clinton's problem was never fear -- it was if anything the reverse, recklessness. A little of that may be the only antidote to Mr. Gore's troubles now.</p>
