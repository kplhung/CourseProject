        <p>The Subway Series has yet to be decided, but the reveling and the rooting officially kicked off yesterday in Bryant Park, where thousands of Yankees and Mets fans ducked out of work and trudged through the mud to pledge their allegiance to their teams.</p>
        <p>It was a baseball bash with everything but a ballgame. There were plenty of peanuts and Cracker Jack, hot dogs and donuts, and, of course, tons of taunting by fans clad in everything from Yankee bandannas to Met bath towels. They came by bus, bicycle and train toting signs that read ''Hey Piazza How's Your Head?'' and ''Yucky Yankees.'' And they were loud about it.</p>

        <p>The Subway Series has yet to be decided, but the reveling and the rooting officially kicked off yesterday in Bryant Park, where thousands of Yankees and Mets fans ducked out of work and trudged through the mud to pledge their allegiance to their teams.</p>
        <p>It was a baseball bash with everything but a ballgame. There were plenty of peanuts and Cracker Jack, hot dogs and donuts, and, of course, tons of taunting by fans clad in everything from Yankee bandannas to Met bath towels. They came by bus, bicycle and train toting signs that read ''Hey Piazza How's Your Head?'' and ''Yucky Yankees.'' And they were loud about it.</p>
        <p>The revelers literally turned Bryant Park into a divided house of baseball nuts. On the right side of the park, the official den of Yankees worshipers, Yankees fans shouted , ''Let's go Yankees, let's beat the Mets.'' Not to be outdone, Mets believers bellowed back, ''Mets in six, Mets in six.''</p>
        <p>For a moment, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani tried to bring both sides together, declaring the city of New York the real victor in the Subway Series. But even he took sides, as he tossed a baseball cap bearing a combined Yankees-Mets logo across the stage. ''This is what I call the coward's hat,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''This is a time of crisis and you have to pledge your allegiance,'' he said, donning a blue and white Yankees cap. ''We don't accept any of this: 'I root for the Yankees, I root for the Mets, I root for New York City.' You root for the Yankees, or you root for the Mets. That's it.''</p>
