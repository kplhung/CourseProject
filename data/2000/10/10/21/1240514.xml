        <p>A Chinese development company has sued the nation's market regulator for refusing to approve its application to list on a mainland stock exchange. The company, Hainan Kaili Development and Construction, contends that it was treated unfairly by the China Securities Regulatory Commission, which routinely favors large state-owned concerns over private companies in deciding who can raise capital on the country's two stock markets. A decision in Hainan Kaili's favor would set an important precedent for thousands of private companies clamoring for access to the country's capital markets.</p>
