        <p>High-strung, high-maintenance New York may never surpass laid-back Hawaii as the nation's most energy-efficient state, but a thunderclap of events in recent months in the Northeast have created what energy experts say is a glittering opportunity to try.</p>
        <p>And it is all because a sharp rise in the prices of heating oil, natural gas and electricity in the last few months -- especially in the Northeast -- has thrown open the door for the return of the oldest environmental idea around: conservation.</p>
        <p>Three months ago, the Amalgamated Housing Cooperative -- 1,500 families spread across 11 buildings just off Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx -- began replacing every old fluorescent light fixture in every hallway in every building with high-efficiency bulbs that use 45 percent less electricity. The co-op's directors calculated that the $45,000 investment would pay itself back in about two years.</p>
        <p>Then came the summer of utility shock. With electricity rates up more than 40 percent in the New York region, the co-op's investment will be recouped after only eight months, or early next year. What had seemed pretty smart in early summer, said Amalgamated's general manager, William M. Schwarz, suddenly looked brilliant.</p>
        <p>Most energy-saving technology is not much more sophisticated than that. Things like better bulbs and more insulation around a furnace room, experts say, can cut energy use as much as or more than expensive tools like motion sensors that turn off the heat or lights in empty rooms. Although the focus of conservation is probably still on the suburban homeowner, Amalgamated's experience has shown that urban conservation can have a huge impact.</p>
        <p>''The best part is, it's not rocket science -- it's good Victorian engineering, rediscovered,'' said Amory B. Lovins, the chief executive for research at the Rocky Mountain Institute, an independent research center in Old Snowmass, Colo., that advocates alternative energy and higher efficiency.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lovins and other experts say that for most Americans, higher energy prices and the impulse to conserve are probably still no more than a blip on the radar and not -- as they were in the 1970's -- a full-scale social movement. Leaders at the Amalgamated co-op say their motivations are mixed as well, one part penny-pinching, one part social consciousness.</p>
        <p>The co-op was founded in the 1920's as part of the socialist utopian movement then thriving in the garment workers' union, whose ranks included many of the original tenants. Income ceilings limited the co-op's apartments to middle-income families, and there was always a social agenda. From the struggles of the labor movement, the co-op's social impulse morphed into environmentalism. Members embraced recycling before it was mandatory and trash compacting before it became city law.</p>
        <p>Last year, as New York State was moving to deregulate its electricity system, Amalgamated's board approved an ambitious five-year retrofitting plan that includes everything from its lights to the testing or replacement of the estimated 5,000 motors that pump water and run elevators and distribute steam in the complex to a rooftop solar power system. A high-efficiency $150,000 water cooler for the air-conditioning system will go in before next summer.</p>
        <p>''It's kept us who we are,'' said the co-op's president, Ed Yaker.</p>
        <p>Energy entrepreneurs and researchers say that the widespread prosperity in the 1990's usually required conservation and efficiency to be dressed up as something else, like luxury. The Maytag Corporation came up with a superefficient front-loading washing machine several years ago called the Neptune that uses far less water and electricity than a conventional top-loader. But the company positioned it as a top-of-the-line European-style machine that was gentler on clothes and tacked on a price that was twice as high as its regular washers. Sales took off.</p>
        <p>In New York, real estate developers have also positioned several new luxury residential and commercial buildings as ''green'' and done well in sales.</p>
        <p>But many inventors hoping to get a piece of the market have cried in the wilderness for years.</p>
        <p>Carmine F. Vasile, an inventor who lives on Long Island, vividly recalls April 28, 1980, when he accidentally touched a drainpipe in his basement in Medford, N.Y., while his wife was upstairs taking a shower. He burned his hand and realized that a lot of heat was escaping through the sides of the pipe.</p>
        <p>Mr. Vasile, a former researcher in the aerospace defense industry with nearly 30 patents to his name, has spent 20 years trying to sell the patented device born of that accident -- a coiled heat recovery apparatus that recycles captured thermal energy back into the hot-water tank. The construction industry, he said, has mostly cared not a whit. ''It's been a saga,'' Mr. Vasile said.</p>
        <p>Some business executives say that higher energy prices could mean profitability for all sorts of old and new ideas.</p>
        <p>Raymond G. Saleeby, who is the president and chief executive of myutility.com, a Manhattan energy management company founded last year, says that he expects the New York region's high energy costs to continue to worsen through the next year, and that the success of his company is predicated on that upward movement of prices. He says that he can cut a small-to-medium-sized company's energy bills in half, and he plans to hit where prices are rising fastest -- beginning next month in New York City, and then next year in California.</p>
        <p>Other companies are trying to build a kind of commodities market in the metropolitan region in which reduced energy use -- and the resulting cleaner air quality -- will itself become a salable product that could further impel the conservation movement.</p>
        <p>The company that put together Amalgamated's energy plan, First Rochdale, a two-year-old cooperative, is in the process of creating a pilot project: it is working with the Federal National Mortgage Association, the housing lender, and Cantor Fitzgerald, a brokerage firm, to form a commodities market for clean-air credits. The idea, to be tested first at the Amalgamated co-op, is to adapt the existing system, in which companies can buy and sell pollution credits, for the residential market in New York City.</p>
        <p>But higher energy prices are a mixed blessing for conservation efforts. They are also battering local budgets, and that could mean less money in residential buildings available for conservation.</p>
        <p>At Amalgamated, the second energy shock hit last month: drastically higher heating oil prices, up 51 percent over last fall. The increase has thrown every budget calculation into disarray, said Mr. Schwarz, the general manager. He is now being forced to consider an increase in common charges -- the monthly fees residents pay for things like heat and maintenance -- that could take effect next spring.</p>
        <p>The tightening energy equation also means that plans, like the rooftop solar panels on the complex's two highest towers, will have to be strictly justified in financial terms. Social agendas are important, said Mr. Yaker, the co-op's president, but economics are what he will have to take to his board for the final decision.</p>
