        <p>As usual, traffic and weather came together ''on the eights'' on WCBS Newsradio 880 yesterday afternoon. But after the 1:58 briefing came something extra: ''That's it for us from Black Rock. Goodbye, Black Rock.''</p>
        <p>With that brief valediction, Paul Murnane and Susan Kennedy, co-anchors, concluded the station's last broadcast of the midday news program from the sleek, sophisticated granite skyscraper known as Black Rock, which once served as the center of the CBS network's fabled broadcast news operations.</p>
        <p>A New York City landmark, the imposing tower at 51 West 52nd Street near the Avenue of the Americas was built to embody CBS's image of itself as the ''Tiffany network,'' and for 36 years, some form of CBS News has been broadcast from the building, the only skyscraper in New York designed by the Modernist Eero Saarinen.</p>
        <p>When CBS moved into Black Rock in 1964, it enjoyed pre-eminence among the networks and a reputation for quality journalism, its standards set by legendary newscasters like Edward R. Murrow and Walter Cronkite.</p>
        <p>In 1987, CBS began moving workers to its West 57th Street studios and renting Black Rock space to law firms and other tenants. Two months ago, the media giant Viacom, which bought CBS earlier this year, said it would sell the building. Six weeks ago, the FM radio station moved out; two weeks ago, the sales staff left. WCBS Newsradio 880, the AM station, was the last holdout.</p>
        <p>The midday program was not the last of the day; the final news report from Black Rock ended later, at exactly 8:59:10 p.m. But yesterday afternoon, a sense of finality had already set in.</p>
        <p>Those who remained gathered and announced the news amid packing crates, empty offices, obsolete equipment and a bittersweet sense of nostalgia.</p>
        <p>''I just did my last midday anchor shoot,'' Mr. Murnane said, pronouncing each word as if to convince himself of the unbelievable. ''I will absolutely miss this place. It's a landmark and in broadcasting it's a very special place. But it is so exciting to be part of all the change in the news business.''</p>
        <p>The infrastructure at Black Rock could not support the technological advances  needed for state-of-the-art news programming, said Frank Raphael, the station's news director. So Newsradio 880 will join CBS's other news divisions at the West 57th Street location, between 10th and 11th Avenues, to take advantage of the resources shared by other news departments there.</p>
        <p>In its new home, WCBS will become the country's first all-news radio station to broadcast using nothing but digital technology, according to CBS executives. The new space gives WCBS an extra 9,000 square feet of office space and a layout with a central newsroom surrounded by studios.</p>
        <p>Since Labor Day, WCBS has been using the new space to train workers and to watch for any last-minute computer bugs and electrical glitches, said Steve Swenson, CBS's vice president and general manager.</p>
        <p>''There comes a time when you've just got to jump in the water and swim,'' he said. ''We're at that point.''</p>
        <p>But for many, the old place, although cramped and well-worn, is hard to leave. Reel-to-reel tape machines line the walls. The control panels on some of the computers look like props from old ''Star Trek'' episodes.</p>
        <p>''It's surreal,'' said Deborah Rodriguez, a news anchor. ''We've gotten used to living here in squalor.''</p>
        <p>Even though most people were in moving clothes -- sneakers and jeans -- Rich Lamb, a 22-year reporting veteran, dressed up for the occasion in suit and tie.</p>
        <p>''It's odd but true,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Between taping interviews for segments to be aired later in the day, Mr. Lamb seemed lost in reverie. Everywhere he looked there was a memory.</p>
        <p>''This is where I sat down to audition for my first job,'' he said, pointing into a small studio he still uses to tape conversations.</p>
        <p>''Here I've rubbed shoulders with Walter Cronkite, William S. Paley and the other legends of the business who really developed broadcast news. There's some sadness when I think about the people who walked these floors and spoke into these microphones.''</p>
        <p>Jane Tillman Irving, a news writer, agreed: ''Just the idea that the station will no longer be at Black Rock is a shock. It is a gorgeous building and there was something about being part of the continuum started by Murrow.</p>
        <p>''A pre-eminent news organization,'' she added, ''Black Rock was a part of that.''</p>
        <p>But Ms. Irving had left Black Rock once before. After working there for 14 years she left for a decade to report on-air and to teach. She returned last year.</p>
        <p>''Having once left, it's not quite as sad,'' Ms. Irving said. ''But there is something wrenching about leaving that building, the house that Murrow built.''</p>
