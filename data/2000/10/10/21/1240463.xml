        <p>Don Quixote himself might have despaired at the prospect of leading America's Communist Party during the cold war, but not the indefatigable Gus Hall. Mr. Hall died last week at the age of 90. His life story, improbably enough, is a genuine American tale.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hall was one of 10 children born to Finnish immigrants in northern Minnesota. He joined the Communist Party as a teenager and at 21 he attended the Lenin Institute in Moscow, the ultimate training ground for Communist activists.</p>
        <p>The 1930's were exhilarating times for a young Communist. The Great Depression had revealed the frailties of laissez-faire capitalism, and Stalin was then leading the fight against Fascism. But the next half-century sorely tested his Communist faith. Mr. Hall's advocacy of a violent revolution earned him an eight-year stay at Leavenworth. He was in prison when Soviet troops quashed the uprising in Budapest and Nikita Khrushchev denounced Stalin and his show trials. But none of that cooled Mr. Hall's Bolshevik ardor. By 1959 he had become the party's leader -- a post he held with unswerving, often unthinking doctrinal loyalty despite the Prague Spring, the Soviet Union's economic decay and the fall of the Berlin Wall.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hall ran for president four times. His best showing was 58,992 votes, in 1976. But he never gave up his understated Midwestern manner, even after he became a New York character and an odd kind of international celebrity. Despite his claims of independence, Soviet archives revealed that Moscow had bankrolled his activities for decades.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hall was on the wrong side of history, and stayed there with what ultimately became a comical consistency. His favorite Soviet leader was Leonid Brezhnev. He condemned Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin as ''the wrecking crew,'' and proclaimed North Korea the latest miracle to emulate. He never wavered from his sclerotic orthodoxy, and never attempted to transform the party of the proletariat into a more trendy leftist alternative. That would have offended his native Midwestern stubbornness.</p>
