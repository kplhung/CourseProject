        <p>Luis Polonia has just two at-bats in the postseason, and there is a chance he will not bat during the World Series. But Polonia knows that if he does bat, after weeks of languishing on the bench, he will probably be called upon to face the Mets closer, Armando Benitez.</p>

        <p>Luis Polonia has just two at-bats in the postseason, and there is a chance he will not bat during the World Series. But Polonia knows that if he does bat, after weeks of languishing on the bench, he will probably be called upon to face the Mets closer, Armando Benitez.</p>
        <p>''He's my man,'' Polonia said. ''He's the guy I'm pretty sure I'm going to be facing.''</p>
        <p>Polonia's logic is simple. He will be the Yankees' best left-handed pinch-hitter, and Manager Joe Torre will presumably hold on to Polonia until he knows he can use him in a situation when he will face a right-handed pitcher in the late innings -- and Benitez fits that description.</p>
        <p>So Polonia sits and waits for his chance, with his small 33 1/2-inch, 32-ounce bats, taking batting practice against pitchers throwing 65 to 70 miles an hour rather than the 96 to 98 m.p.h. that Benitez throws. ''It's tough to do that,'' Polonia said. ''It's a big challenge and sometimes I wonder how I can do it.</p>
        <p>''But I go up there and try not to put too much in my mind. I'm going up there to swing the bat. I'm not going up there to take pitches. I'm going up there to swing the bat.''</p>
        <p>Polonia has two at-bats with one hit in the majors against Benitez. But he and Benitez are both from the Dominican Republic, played against each other in winter ball and played  together for part of a season with the Baltimore Orioles. ''I haven't faced the guy in a few years,'' Polonia said, ''but in the back of my mind, I know him. I know how he thinks.''</p>
        <p>Polonia may face Turk Wendell, too, or perhaps Rick White. But he thinks he will get a shot at Benitez at some point in the next 10 days.</p>
