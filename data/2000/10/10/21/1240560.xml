        <p>YANKEES: Untrusting of his middle relief, Joe Torre essentially relied on six pitchers in the first two rounds of the playoffs. The formula won't change in the World Series: Torre will look to pitch starters Andy Pettitte, Roger Clemens and Orlando Hernandez deep into games, before turning over leads to relievers Mike Stanton, Jeff Nelson and Mariano Rivera. Those six accounted for 7813 innings of the first 97 in the postseason. The two built-in off-days will help Torre rest his top three relievers, which is why rainouts would hurt the Yankees. Torre seems to be leaning toward starting David Cone in Game 4, and given that Cone has not pitched into the middle innings of any game in more than a month, Torre will probably have Denny Neagle and Dwight Gooden prepared to step in quickly.</p>

        <p>YANKEES: Untrusting of his middle relief, Joe Torre essentially relied on six pitchers in the first two rounds of the playoffs. The formula won't change in the World Series: Torre will look to pitch starters Andy Pettitte, Roger Clemens and Orlando Hernandez deep into games, before turning over leads to relievers Mike Stanton, Jeff Nelson and Mariano Rivera. Those six accounted for 7813 innings of the first 97 in the postseason. The two built-in off-days will help Torre rest his top three relievers, which is why rainouts would hurt the Yankees. Torre seems to be leaning toward starting David Cone in Game 4, and given that Cone has not pitched into the middle innings of any game in more than a month, Torre will probably have Denny Neagle and Dwight Gooden prepared to step in quickly.</p>
        <p>METS: Undoubtedly, the depth of this staff is greater than that of the Yankees, although it would be hurt if Dennis Cook is unable to pitch in the series. Beyond starters Al Leiter, Mike Hampton, Rick Reed and Bobby J. Jones, the Mets have a deep relief corps comprised of Armando Benitez, John Franco, Turk Wendell, Rick White and Glendon Rusch, which should help Bobby Valentine manage favorable matchups. One thing to watch if Benitez and Franco are called upon with runners on base: each seems to need a little time to get comfortable and is more vulnerable in facing the first hitter. For example, Franco's first batters hit .288, .197 thereafter.</p>
        <p>YANKEES: The Yankees were optimally efficient in the first two rounds of the playoffs, not allowing any unearned runs. But by and large, the Yankees are an average defensive team. Derek Jeter, the shortstop, has had an erratic year in the field, but he is capable of big-time plays. Third baseman Scott Brosius might be the best in baseball at his position, with extraordinary range; his presence is particularly important when the sinkerballer Andy Pettitte is pitching and generating ground balls. Chuck Knoblauch might start games at second, but he won't finish them, being removed in the late innings. The Yankees' outfield is good at tracking balls, but teams have been extremely aggressive taking extra bases in the playoffs on the throwing arms of center fielder Bernie Williams and right fielder Paul O'Neill.</p>
        <p>METS: They win with their infield defense, a generally unspectacular group that makes plays. The veteran Mike Bordick has settled in at shortstop after a shaky start, and the Gold Glove third baseman Robin Ventura is good at charging balls. Edgardo Alfonzo, the Mets' second baseman, is probably the best defensive player in this series, able to range far to reach balls, and he always seems to be in the right place at the right time. Center fielder Jay Payton will play shallow and take away bloop hits, challenging hitters to drive the ball over his head. Left fielder Benny Agbayani will take bad routes on fly balls and will sometimes make mistakes. Mike Piazza is subpar at catcher.</p>
        <p>YANKEES: They slumbered into the second round of the playoffs but came alive starting in the eighth inning of Game 2, producing 33 runs in the last 36 innings. Bernie Williams and Tino Martinez have had consistently good at-bats in the playoffs, and both Paul O'Neill and Jorge Posada came through in the decisive Game 6. Scott Brosius has been swinging terribly, and if the Yankees are trailing in the late innings, he would most likely be taken out for a pinch-hitter. Chuck Knoblauch and Derek Jeter set the tone for the entire attack at the top of the order, and keeping those two off the bases will be the Mets' most significant challenge in this series.</p>
        <p>METS: Timo Perez has greatly augmented the Mets' attack, giving a speedy presence at the top of the lineup. A key for the Yankees will be in keeping him off the bases, because if they do that, then Edgardo Alfonzo and Mike Piazza -- the muscle of the Mets' lineup -- can be pitched to more carefully. Piazza hit .412 in the second round of the playoffs, and the Yankees might choose to pitch around him, giving more opportunities for Robin Ventura, Todd Zeile, et al. In the second round, Ventura batted .214, Zeile .368. The patient Mets had more walks (27) than strikeouts (24) against the Cardinals; Benny Agbayani, Alfonzo and Zeile are particularly good at making pitchers work deep into counts.</p>
        <p>YANKEES: No series could better demonstrate the point that it is the pitcher, and not the catcher, who is usually the determining factor in whether teams can steal bases. Mets catcher Mike Piazza is a poor thrower, but most of the Mets' starting pitchers are adept at holding runners -- Mike Hampton allowed 9 steals in 19 attempts and Rick Reed 9 steals in only 13 attempts. The Yankees will probably try to run on Al Leiter and Bobby J. Jones, but the leadoff batter Chuck Knoblauch is a conservative thief; if he gets thrown out in his first attempt of the series, his aggressiveness will be curbed. In late innings, Luis Polonia and Jose Vizcaino are wild cards as pinch-runners, because both are willing to steal, and both John Franco and Armando Benitez are vulnerable to stolen bases.</p>
        <p>METS: Timo Perez has restored some of the aggressiveness lost at the top of the order when Roger Cedeno was traded and Rickey Henderson was released, and he will have a challenge in trying to run on the strong-armed Jorge Posada. But he should have opportunities against the Yankees' starters, who are not great at holding runners: Clemens has allowed 17 steals in 22 attempts, Orlando Hernandez 12 steals in 19 attempts, and teams have taken to running on reliever Jeff Nelson (11 steals in 13 attempts). Cookie Rojas, the Mets' third-base coach, is unpredictable, sometimes waving runners homeward with zero or one outs in situations where other coaches wouldn't take a chance.</p>
        <p>YANKEES: The right-handed reliever Jeff Nelson will be in a position to play a pivotal role for the Yankees in this series, just as Seattle's Arthur Rhodes was in the American League Championship Series. The Mets' lineup is deep in right-handed hitters and as Joe Torre's right-handed set-up man, Nelson could get repeated opportunities against Edgardo Alfonzo, Mike Piazza, Todd Zeile and Jay Payton. Right-handers hit .157 against Nelson this year, left-handers .232. Alfonzo, in particular, will present an interesting challenge for Nelson, because Alfonzo is such an accomplished breaking-ball hitter, and the pitch that distinguishes Nelson is his hard-breaking slider.</p>
        <p>METS: Most of the Mets have two years' experience in the postseason, and some, like Al Leiter and Dennis Cook, have even more. But few of them have been on the big stage that is the World Series, and there's no telling how they will react. Armando Benitez is an exceptional closer, and yet he has a history of allowing big-time homers in October. Mike Piazza is one of the greatest offensive catchers ever, but his track record indicates he needs time to adjust to each new setting. Mike Hampton, tightly wound and excitable, must be able to reign in those emotions when he pitches Game 2; no one knows if he can. It is a fascinating dynamic.</p>
        <p>TEMPTING TIMO: Timo Perez is batting .323 in the postseason and leads the Mets with 10 runs scored. He has been aggressive at the plate and has only one walk in 41 postseason plate appearances. Look for the Yankees to try to tempt him with pitches out of the strike zone.</p>
        <p>WAITING OUT THE LEFTIES: The left-handers Al Leiter And Mike Hampton, the Mets' starters in Games 1 and 2, are good early or late in games. But numbers show that they become more vulnerable as their pitch count increases. For Hampton, the magic number seems to be around 60: Opponents batted .211 from pitches 1 to 60 this year, with only 2 homers in 437 at-bats; after 60 pitches, opponents batted .276 with 8 homers in 369 at-bats. For Leiter, the number is 75: From 1-75, opponents batted .207 with 9 homers in 503 at-bats; after 75 pitches, opponents batted .269 with 10 homers in 268 at-bats.</p>
        <p>ZEILE'S DANCE: Most teams consider the Mets' method of holding runners at first a gimmick, with Todd Zeile darting back and forth to the bag. In the interleague games, the Yankees insisted they were not affected. Fact is, they have been bothered, the base runners uncertain in their actions. In four years of interleague play, the Yankees are only 9 for 20 in stolen-base attempts against the Mets, and this year, they had two steals in seven attempts.</p>
        <p>GIVEAWAYS: The Yankees had a poor season defensively, but they have been remarkably steady in the postseason, making the vast majority of routine plays, collecting only 3 errors in 11 games and allowing no unearned runs. Similarly, the Mets have been good, making only four errors. The World Series figures to be filled with low-scoring games, and minimizing mistakes will be crucial. Chuck Knoblauch, hampered by throwing jitters, is expected to play second base again in this series, for the first time since Sept. 29. He does not have a throwing error since June 28, but his problem has manifested itself more in plays he does not make -- not completing a double play, not making a successful throw on a tough chopper hit in front of him.</p>
