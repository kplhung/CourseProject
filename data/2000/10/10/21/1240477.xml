        <p>Vincent J. Gentile, a two-term state senator who represents parts of Brooklyn and Staten Island, has yet to have an easy campaign season. A Democrat in a Senate district that often gives Republicans big majorities, Mr. Gentile has faced well-financed, well-known opponents.</p>
        <p>This year is no exception.</p>
        <p>Next month, Mr. Gentile is up against a former Republican state senator who is fiercely trying to make a political comeback. Many leaders in both parties are watching this race not only because it represents a clash of strong personalities, but also because the contest is being waged in one of the few districts in New York City that produces competitive races between Democrats and Republicans.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gentile, 41, is running against the man he replaced in the Senate, Robert DiCarlo. The son of an assemblyman, Mr. DiCarlo had been the Republican Party chairman in Brooklyn as well as the party's only elected official in the borough. But his increasingly fractious relationship with other Brooklyn Republican leaders led the party to support another candidate in 1996, creating a bruising primary that Mr. DiCarlo narrowly lost. He ran in the general election on the Conservative Party line, and Mr. Gentile won the three-way race.</p>
        <p>In 1998, Mr. Gentile defeated Christopher J. Mega, the former presiding judge of the State Court of Claims and a former state senator, in another hotly competitive race.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gentile, a former prosecutor in Queens, said he was approaching this race in much the same way he handled the others.</p>
        <p>''Because of the political leanings of this district, any race is a significant race,'' Mr. Gentile said. ''I have always run against people who have been public officials. So, I don't take anything for granted. I'm working around the clock, seven days a week.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gentile, who keeps a whirlwind schedule of appearances throughout the district, spends each day courting voters. Some days, he begins by speaking with pre-dawn commuters at, say, the 77th Street subway station in Bay Ridge about public safety. He spends afternoons speaking to the elderly about health care and prescription drug costs, and ends up talking with civic organizations in meetings that end long after dark.</p>
        <p>In discussing his candidacy with voters, Mr. DiCarlo, 43, says his three years in the Senate gave him the experience to be far more effective than Mr. Gentile. (Mr. DiCarlo won a special election in 1993 to fill a vacant Senate seat.) Furthermore, he maintains, having the district represented by a Republican in the Republican-run Senate would be an added bonus.</p>
        <p>''Brooklyn is a county that has not one Republican state legislator,'' Mr. DiCarlo said. ''If I return to the Senate, I empower the Democrats from Brooklyn who are in the Assembly, because there would be a voice in the State Senate on behalf of Brooklyn.''</p>
        <p>Of Mr. Gentile, Mr. DiCarlo said, ''He brings nothing to the table when it comes to the budget process. If we had a Republican there, we'd have a voice in the majority.''</p>
        <p>Because the Republican Senate leadership directs more money to districts represented by members of the party, Mr. DiCarlo said, the district has lost millions of dollars in financing for community programs every year since Mr. Gentile was elected.</p>
        <p>Even though he was a commanding leader in the Republican Party, Mr. DiCarlo remains a divisive figure in Brooklyn politics, known for frequent battles with other Republicans. Several years ago, the leaders of the party accused him of a string of misdeeds, including the mishandling of party money when he was county chairman. Mr. DiCarlo denies the allegations, which were never pursued.</p>
        <p>The 23rd Senate District also includes the Stapleton and Midland Beach sections of Staten Island. It has a large population of Italian-Americans, with non-Hispanic whites making up about 75 percent of the district, Hispanics 10 percent, and other races making up the balance.</p>
        <p>While Democrats have a slight edge among the district's registered voters, Republican candidates have done well there. The Brooklyn and Staten Island parts of the district are both represented by Republican City Council members, and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani won election and re-election overwhelmingly in the area.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gentile defends his stewardship in the Senate, saying that the district has not suffered financially just because it has been represented by a Democrat.</p>
        <p>''I've been productive and I've been able to produce for this district,'' Mr. Gentile said after a recent meeting with senior citizens. ''He has a myopic view of the job as a state senator. We're more than money changers.''</p>
        <p>Specifically, Mr. Gentile said he had strongly supported proposals to make prescription drugs more affordable and had tried to get more money for the city's public schools.</p>
        <p>Mr. DiCarlo, who left his job at the Empire State Development Corporation to run for the Senate, said his campaign this year was different because he had successfully mended political fences and had secured the support of Republican officials in Staten Island, which makes up about a third of the district. He is spending more than $250,000 on the race, while his opponent expects to spend around $200,000.</p>
        <p>Moreover, he said, his conservative views on issues including abortion and tax reductions make him more attuned to the voters in the district than Mr. Gentile, whom he dismisses as a ''liberal Democrat.''</p>
        <p>Above all, Mr. DiCarlo said, he sees regaining his old job as something of a vindication for the job he did during his three years in the Senate.</p>
        <p>''This has also become an important cause for me,'' he said, sitting recently in his campaign headquarters in Brooklyn. ''I think I did a good job when I was a state senator. And I think I can be an even better one.''</p>
