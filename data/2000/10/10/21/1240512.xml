        <p>Judging from today's fifth and final debate, the New Jersey contest for the United States Senate has come down to which candidate the voters will trust more to spend billions in new federal money for education, health care, land conservation and other programs, without burning up the entire government surplus.</p>
        <p>In their last side-by-side encounter before the cameras, and the second one to be televised on a major network affiliate, Jon S. Corzine and Representative Bob Franks once more avoided the kind of dramatic confrontation that Mr. Franks had been hoping for and Mr. Corzine had been dreading -- something, in other words, that could suddenly alter the course of the race.</p>

        <p>Judging from today's fifth and final debate, the New Jersey contest for the United States Senate has come down to which candidate the voters will trust more to spend billions in new federal money for education, health care, land conservation and other programs, without burning up the entire government surplus.</p>
        <p>In their last side-by-side encounter before the cameras, and the second one to be televised on a major network affiliate, Jon S. Corzine and Representative Bob Franks once more avoided the kind of dramatic confrontation that Mr. Franks had been hoping for and Mr. Corzine had been dreading -- something, in other words, that could suddenly alter the course of the race.</p>
        <p>Now, with just two weeks and three weekends remaining until Election Day, Mr. Corzine, who leads in most polls by about 12 percentage points, will head out to glad-hand at a feverish pace while his aides complete plans for a huge get-out-the-vote effort. And Mr. Franks, who has just begun to advertise on New York television stations, will continue to raise money for new TV ads before taking to the New Jersey roads in Senator John McCain's Straight Talk Express bus on Friday for 12 days of nonstop retail politicking.</p>
        <p>Much of today's debate covered the same ground as the candidates' television ads.  Mr. Franks attacked his Democratic rival for his record-breaking campaign spending, and Mr. Corzine fired back that Mr. Franks was in the pocket of the special interests.</p>
        <p>Mr. Franks said that Mr. Corzine's plan to allow the government to invest a small portion of the Social Security trust fund in the stock market, perhaps through the Federal Reserve System, had elicited dire warnings from the chairman of the Fed himself, Alan Greenspan.</p>
        <p>And Mr. Corzine accused Mr. Franks of voting in 1995 to open up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, then claiming otherwise.</p>
        <p>But on issue after issue, both men said the solution to vexing American problems required more money from the federal government, though Mr. Corzine would generally spend more, and Mr. Franks argued for attaching strings, such as greater ''accountability'' in exchange for federal money for education.</p>
        <p>Mr. Franks told of his experience on the House Budget Committee and warned that Mr. Corzine would ''wreck the balanced budget and threaten Social Security.'' For his part, Mr. Corzine, the former co-chairman of the Wall Street house Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company, spoke of ''investing prudently'' in America.</p>
        <p>Tonight, as if on cue, Mr. Corzine released a new ad with three telling turns of phrase: it highlights his experience with ''real numbers'' and says he supports ''a fiscally responsible plan'' for new spending ''without raising taxes.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine, who was plagued in earlier debates by momentary verbal meltdowns, seemed to suffer a brief case of dry mouth, but never lost his composure. Mr. Franks, a master of the sound bite, got off a few new lines at Mr. Corzine's expense but may have come across as a bit surly in the process.</p>
        <p>He took issue, for example, with one of Mr. Corzine's TV commercials, which he said implied that Mr. Corzine supported, and Mr. Franks opposed, putting Social Security revenues in a ''lockbox,'' unavailable to Congress for new spending or tax cuts. Mr. Franks noted that he had actually ''helped to craft the Social Security lockbox'' in the first place.</p>
        <p>''Jon has enough money to run 2,000 negative commercials about Bob Franks,'' Mr. Franks said. ''For Jon to say that, just doesn't meet the smell test.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine, meanwhile, aimed a dart at Mr. Franks on the subject of suburban sprawl, arguing that Mr. Franks had failed to get enough federal money allocated to the Land and Water Conservation Fund. ''I hope to go to Washington and put money and reality where the words are,'' Mr. Corzine said.</p>
        <p>The hourlong debate was taped at the College of New Jersey in Ewing before a few hundred students and political supporters of both men. Mr. Corzine and Mr. Franks, each in a dark suit and white shirt, sat next to each other in armchairs on a Persian rug. The debate will be broadcast  Sunday at 10:30 a.m. on WABC-TV in New York, and at 10 a.m. on WPVI-TV, the ABC affiliate in Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>From the start, Mr. Corzine was put on the defensive about his campaign spending by Mr. Franks and the moderators, Roz Abrams of WABC and Marc Howard of WPVI.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine said he supported a ban on soft money but argued that before spending limits are imposed on wealthy candidates, it will be necessary to provide a ''structure'' in which all candidates can get free television time.</p>
        <p>After several go-rounds on the issue, Ms. Abrams asked Mr. Corzine what he would tell a youngster ''who dreams of running for the Senate,'' but ''who knows that he will never have that kind of money at his disposal.''</p>
        <p>''What would you say about how to finance his campaign?'' she asked.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine let the question pass, saying instead that his money was given too much attention. But he then cited his own ''humble beginning'' and rise to financial success, as if to say he hoped that all youngsters would have the same opportunities to become millionaires.</p>
        <p>''And they shouldn't be discouraged if they happen not to have 40 to 60 million dollars for a campaign?'' Ms. Abrams asked.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine responded by saying he hoped the campaign finance system could be reformed before today's youngsters were old enough to run for office, ''so that people who have good ideas would get themselves before the public.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Franks responded by saying the lessons to be learned from Mr. Corzine's campaign were ''quite unfortunate.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine was showing that politics was becoming the province of the rich, Mr. Franks said, sounding as if he found Mr. Corzine's very candidacy objectionable.</p>
        <p>''Does it mean,'' he went on, ''you can all of a sudden move from one career to another having expressed very little interest in the public domain?''</p>
