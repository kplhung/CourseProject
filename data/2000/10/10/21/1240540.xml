        <p>Like a child refusing his medicine, Andrew Golota stubbornly kept his lips pressed together as his trainer Lou Duva tried to force Golota's mouthpiece back into his mouth.</p>
        <p>Duva, the longtime trainer, was on his toes, reaching up as the 6-foot-4-inch Golota stood in his corner between the second and third rounds of tonight's heavyweight fight with Mike Tyson.</p>
        <p>Golota's other trainer, Al Certo, was yelling: ''Get back in there! You've got to get back in there! What are you doing?''</p>
        <p>But Golota was quitting. In a sport of wills, Golota was unwilling to continue.</p>
        <p>Tyson (49-3), who had to be held back by his trainer, Tommy Brooks, as Golota (36-5) was giving up, was awarded a technical knockout in the third round.</p>
        <p>Tyson's victory tonight will heighten the pressure on the handlers of Lennox Lewis and Tyson to make a fight between the two.</p>
        <p>Tyson's reputation, former status as champion and his recent victory streak have made him Lewis's most attractive potential opponent.</p>
        <p>Before the third round could continue, Golota, knocked down once and cut in two places, stalked from the ring at The Palace in Auburn Hills. He left without his cornermen and was showered with boos from the 16,228 fans, who also pelted him with food and beverages, some splashing on his chest and face.</p>
        <p>Before he left, referee Frank Garza said Golota told him, ''I quit.''</p>
        <p>''He told me it more than once,'' Garza said.</p>
        <p>Golota wanted to quit after the first round.</p>
        <p>''I said, 'No, you're going to win this fight,' but he wanted to stop it,'' Certo said.</p>
        <p>Golota's checkered, exotic career had its most bizarre chapter of all. Last year, in a fight he was winning against Michael Grant, Golota also declined to continue after being knocked down in the 10th round.</p>
        <p>''Listen, boxing is a very difficult sport,'' Golota, who earned $2.2 million for the fight, said in his locker room afterward. ''I am sorry to all my fans, who counted on me, but it wasn't my day.''</p>
        <p>Asked if he planned to continue his boxing career, Golota said: ''I will have to give heavy thought about it. I don't know.''</p>
        <p>Tyson, who received $10 million, also bolted from the ring as soon as it was obvious he had won. He did not appear at a postfight news conference.</p>
        <p>Brooks said: ''I've never seen anything like that before. I wouldn't expect that from a fighter. He's not a coward but he suffers from anxiety attacks. I think he had one at the start of the third round.''</p>
        <p>Tyson, who floored Golota in the first round, was ahead on all three judges' scorecards, having won both rounds, but Golota began to fight back in the second round.</p>
        <p>A spirited first round had ended with Tyson hitting Golota with a straight right hand that sent Golota to the canvas. Golota was up quickly, and after receiving a count of 10, the first round ended. Seconds before the knockdown, Tyson opened a small cut over Golota's left eye with a head butt that may have been unintentional.</p>
        <p>Golota also complained of the head butt in his locker room, saying, ''Nobody took care of this. I was head-butted and the referee didn't respond to it. I was hit very well. But I stood up. I slipped.''</p>
        <p>In the second round, Tyson continued his barrage and hit Golota with consecutive, solid left hooks that backed up Golota. With Tyson throwing the majority of punches, Golota's left eye soon was swollen and cut. He also had a cut on the bridge of his nose. Golota fought back, however, and as the round drew to a close, Tyson's effectiveness was diminishing. He was starting to throw his punches more wildly and missing more often. The knockdown punch was Tyson's best of the fight by far.</p>
        <p>Tyson looked unsettled as the second round ended and with the third dawning, it appeared the fight could possibly last to the latter rounds, especially if Golota started boxing instead of brawling. But Golota was soon on his way out of the ring.</p>
        <p>The first indication that Golota was less than ready to fight may have come three hours before he climbed into the ring when his camp complained he was being forced to wear Tyson's preference in gloves. If Golota was looking for an excuse to be distracted -- his mental preparation has been questioned before -- then he got it.</p>
        <p>PUNCH LINES</p>
        <p>ZAB JUDAH of Brooklyn defended his International Boxing Federation junior-welterweight title, but he was bloodied in the process. Judah won in the eighth round, earning a technical knockout against HECTOR QUIROZ of California. . . . LAILA ALI won her eighth consecutive bout with a unanimous decision over KENDRA LENHART of Tennessee in a six-round fight. MUHAMMAD ALI watched his daughter's fight at ringside.</p>
