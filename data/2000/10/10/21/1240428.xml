        <p>Ben Ratliff reviews performance by bassist Phil Lesh's band at Beacon, with guest Greg Osby, jazz saxophonist (M)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>When somebody begins a solo in Phil Lesh's band, the chances are high that within four bars a few other musicians will begin to pile on with their own improvisations. And the tangle of all those single notes isn't a momentary diversion but the goal.  The emphasis isn't on the primacy of the individual soloist, but on the weave. It can confound somebody who is used to the principles of jazz, much less the principles of rock, where so much activity at once is usually understood as clutter.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lesh, the bass player who was with the Grateful Dead for three decades, has spent the last five years or so -- through many lineup changes to his group -- restoring the collective volatility that could arise out of the Dead at its best. On his band's last few tours, he has experimented with adding jazz musicians to the stage, as the Dead were known to do; on Sunday night at the Beacon, his guest was the saxophonist Greg Osby.</p>

        <p>When somebody begins a solo in Phil Lesh's band, the chances are high that within four bars a few other musicians will begin to pile on with their own improvisations. And the tangle of all those single notes isn't a momentary diversion but the goal.  The emphasis isn't on the primacy of the individual soloist, but on the weave. It can confound somebody who is used to the principles of jazz, much less the principles of rock, where so much activity at once is usually understood as clutter.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lesh, the bass player who was with the Grateful Dead for three decades, has spent the last five years or so -- through many lineup changes to his group -- restoring the collective volatility that could arise out of the Dead at its best. On his band's last few tours, he has experimented with adding jazz musicians to the stage, as the Dead were known to do; on Sunday night at the Beacon, his guest was the saxophonist Greg Osby.</p>
        <p>It was Mr. Osby's second time onstage with Mr. Lesh. (The first was last spring in Philadelphia.) He joined the band on its fourth song of the night, the Dead's ''Eyes of the World,'' and at first he was chary. But apart from a few minutes in ''Soulshine,'' which sounded formulaic -- gospelized rhythm-and-blues, with echoes of the Saturday Night Live band's closing theme -- Mr. Osby stayed onstage for most of the night.</p>
        <p>He stuck gamely to his own idiosyncratic style, full of chopped-off phrases, unexpected rhythmic contours and rapid strings of clear, articulated notes during slow tempos.</p>
        <p>The two sets, each two hours long,  included some straightforward rock songs -- like rearranged versions of the Beatles' ''She Said She Said'' and the Youngbloods' ''Get Together.''  But a good deal of the material was midtempo and easy to take apart into nebulous, improvisatory zones.</p>
        <p>Aside from a few short bursts of enthusiastic free-form playing, with no tonal or rhythmic center, the collective soloing was rooted in vamps and modes; the music never became a mess, and the trio of Mr. Lesh on bass and Warren Haynes and Jimmy Herring on guitars -- the nerve center of the band -- kept their dynamic balance, watching for lulls in one another's statements to jump in.</p>
        <p>Mr. Osby eased himself in slowly. The band can do a lot of different things, and as he was coming to them fairly fresh -- there was not much indication he was familiar with the material -- it was interesting to see which he was best suited to. Despite his early background in rhythm-and-blues bands, he did not let himself go into King Curtis-style obbligatos in a good-time shuffle like ''U.S. Blues''; he remained more in the role of judicious, self-protective artist than enthusiastic participant.</p>
        <p>The Dead's ballad ''Morning Dew'' worked well; though played attentively, the John Coltrane minor key blues ''Blue Train'' didn't really go anywhere; and in looser jamming sequences Mr. Osby had strong, self-assured moments. Toward the end of the show he was no longer playing tentatively, and in ''Shakedown Street'' he managed to play lines with such commanding rhythmic suggestions that he took the lead in shaping the music. Mr. Lesh and the drummer John Molo were turning the beat around, mirroring his moves, and the guitarists began to build off his melodic suggestions.</p>
