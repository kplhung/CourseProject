        <p>LIPPMAN-Charles D., Rabbi. The Board and congregation of the Temple of Universal Judaism mourns the death of our spiritual guide, teacher, mentor and friend, our beloved Rabbi Charles D. Lippman, D.D. Chuck was our light and inspiration. He was a magnet who drew us together. We will miss his strength of character, integrity, compassion and wit. As much as his death is unfathomable to us, he will be forever in our hearts. We extend our deepest condolences to his partner and morning star Alan, and the rest of his family, Hy, Elly, Robert, Rita, Jeffrey, Jeremy, Matthew and David. A funeral service will be held Sunday, October 22 at 1:15 PM at ''The Riverside'', 76th St. and Amsterdam Avenue. Please make contributions to the charity of your choice in Rabbi Lippman's name. A memorial service is planned for later this year.</p>
