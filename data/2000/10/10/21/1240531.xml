        <p>After a day of shifting momentum at the Presidents Cup, the United States team remained in control as the International team remained in deep trouble.</p>
        <p>Stifling a morning rally by their opponents and continuing their dominance in foursomes, the Americans built a 10-5 lead today heading into Saturday's five four-ball matches. The first team to reach 16 1/2 points wins the cup.</p>
        <p>Very little has gone as expected in this competition. Who expected the Americans, who have a history of struggling in foursomes, to win 9 of 10 foursome matches? Who expected Ernie Els and Vijay Singh, two of the world's top players, to be 0-3 through three matches? Who expected Kirk Triplett and Stewart Cink, two Presidents Cup rookies, to be 2-0 as a team in foursomes?</p>
        <p>It was more proof that match play is hard to figure on paper, but through two days at Robert Trent Jones Golf Club, the United States has been the superior and more resilient team. After the International team cut the Americans' lead to 6-4, the United States responded this afternoon by winning four of five foursome matches to regain its 5-point cushion.</p>
        <p>''We've got to get within 3 points, I should say,'' said Peter Thomson, the International team's captain, when asked what his goal would be on Saturday. ''I saw some amazing golf from the U.S. team. I think it was a magnificent performance today.''</p>
        <p>Even the Americans could not explain their 9-1 success in alternate-shot matches, a format that many players do not enjoy. But Tiger Woods and Notah Begay III, former college teammates at Stanford, have gone 2-0 in foursomes, joining Triplett and Cink as the most effective American combinations. It is easy to fathom Woods and Begay having chemistry, because they have been friends since they were teenagers. But Cink and Triplett had never played together before Wednesday's practice, and Cink had no reason to expect instant success.</p>
        <p>''I've never played in foursomes before,  said Cink, whose strong iron play meshed with Triplett's driving and putting. ''All I know is that our team is great at foursomes. Our team has gelled, and the gaps in our games have been filled in.</p>
        <p>''Communication has been 100 percent fluid between Kirk and I. We've talked our way through putts, we've talked our way through shots and wind direction. When he's hitting, I'm caddying for him, and when I'm hitting, he's caddying for me.''</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the International team was still looking for that kind of karma. After the Americans swept Thursday's five matches, Els gave an impromptu speech on the team bus riding back to the hotel.</p>
        <p>''Ernie asked me to do it, but I said it would be better if he did it,'' said Steve Elkington, Els's teammate. ''Ernie doesn't say much ever. All the talking he does is with his clubs. But he got up on the bus and said we've all traveled a long way to get where we are in golf. He wanted us to pull together, even closer than we are. We had a terrible day yesterday, but he didn't want us to keep our heads down. I think it worked.''</p>
        <p>It worked, but for only a little while. The International team won four of five morning four-ball matches, including a 3-and-2 victory by Carlos Franco and Shigeki Maruyama over Woods and Begay, to shrink the United States's lead. Watching Woods fall gave the International team an emotional lift, but the Americans responded with fury in the afternoon. Loren Roberts and Paul Azinger pummeled Franco and Maruyama, 5 and 4. Woods and Begay manhandled Els and Singh, 6 and 5. Hal Sutton and Tom Lehman defeated Michael Campbell and Retief Goosen, 3 and 2. The International team's only points were earned by Mike Weir and Nick Price, who handled Phil Mickelson and David Duval, 5 and 4.</p>
        <p>That left Triplett and Cink against Robert Allenby and Stuart Appleby in the pivotal match of the afternoon. Triplett and Cink prevailed, 2 and 1, with Triplett putting his team ahead for good with a pressure 10-foot birdie putt at No. 15. The match ended when the International team bogeyed No. 17, with Appleby missing a 6-foot putt for par.</p>
        <p>It is hard to envision a weekend comeback by the International team unless Els and Singh earn points. In the past two days, Singh could not buy a birdie. And Els has looked very little like the No. 2 player in the world.</p>
        <p>Thomson decided not to bench either Els or Singh for Saturday, but he did separate the struggling stars. Els and Price will face Duval and Love on Saturday, while Singh and Goosen will play Woods and Begay.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Ken Venturi, the United States captain, did not want his team to relax.</p>
        <p>''I can't tell you how much I want it,'' Venturi said. ''You'll probably find out my emotions Sunday, if it comes to pass, which I hope it does.''</p>
