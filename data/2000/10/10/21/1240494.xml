        <p>Gov. George W. Bush and Senator John McCain stumped side by side today, with the senator declaring at a rollicking airport rally that the governor was ''fully prepared'' to lead. But once again things did not go quite as planned between the two former primary rivals.</p>
        <p>The high point of the campaign day was supposed to be a unity rally in New Hampshire, victor and vanquished together, with Mr. McCain appealing to independents and swing voters in the state where he defeated  Mr. Bush in the primary and forced him to fight for his nomination.</p>
        <p>But Mr. McCain missed the rally. His aides blamed food poisoning from a catfish and shrimp dinner in Mississippi the night before.</p>
        <p>When Mr. McCain finally caught up with the Bush campaign in Maine, he showed no reservations. He and Mr. Bush shook hands with the crowd, side by side. Mr. McCain waved even more antically from the stage than Mr. Bush did, earning a roar when he was introduced by Senator Olympia J. Snowe. And Mr. McCain, the man who once declared to audiences that he was ''fully prepared to lead,'' implying that the governor wasn't, gave Mr. Bush his blessings this time.</p>
        <p>''Who do you think won those debates?'' Mr. McCain called out, drawing a chant of ''Bush! Bush! Bush!'' from the crowd.</p>
        <p>''You saw in Governor Bush a man who was calm,'' Mr. McCain said, ''a man who was assured, a man who was fully prepared to assume the responsibilities'' of the White House. And hammering home the idea that Vice President Al Gore gave distinctly different performances in the three presidential debates, he said, ''On the other side I saw three different people, didn't you?''</p>
        <p>Once more he declared Mr. Bush  ''fully prepared to restore integrity and respect to the White House.''</p>
        <p>Of their primary battles, Mr. McCain mocked himself by quoting Vince Lombardi: ''Show me a good loser and I'll show you a loser.'' He said the primary fight ''was good for us. It was good for America.''</p>
        <p>Soon Mr. Bush was center stage, drawing sharp contrasts with Mr. Gore. ''He trusts Washington and I trust you, and that's one of the reasons I'm going to become your president.'' Mr. Bush said, ''I can't make it any more plain.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Bush had to go it alone in New Hampshire, where Mr. McCain not only defeated him in the Republican primary but also piled up the widest victory margin since Ronald Reagan defeated Mr. Bush's father there 20 years ago.</p>
        <p>At St. Anselm's College in Manchester, where a big green banner proclaimed ''New Hampshire Welcomes the Reformers,'' Mr. Bush took questions at the kind of town hall meeting that Mr. McCain made his trademark.</p>
        <p>''I'm so glad to be back in New Hampshire,'' Mr. Bush said, winning  thunderous applause. ''Some folks might have assumed I wasn't coming back. But I'm a better candidate as a result of campaigning last winter in this great state. I am. This is a state that puts you through your paces.''</p>
        <p>And New Hampshire is a state up for grabs, according to polls, although it voted for President Clinton in 1992 and 1996.</p>
        <p>And though Mr. Bush had to tell the crowd that Mr. McCain ''took ill,'' he praised him and took up some of his causes as he mentioned things that Washington could do to prevent the end-of-year brinkmanship over spending bills that is taking place  now as the Congressional session ends.</p>
        <p>Saying the nation needed ''less bickering and finger-pointing and name-calling and needless partisanship,'' Mr. Bush called for federal budgeting to take place every two years instead of annually and for a ''constitutional'' line-item veto.</p>
        <p>''I agree with John McCain. I think we need to have a commission on governmental waste,'' he said. And he added that ''if John were here I would thank him for introducing legislation that I would sign to prevent the Congress from shutting down government, to prevent the executive branch from shutting down government, have a no-shutdown provision.''</p>
        <p>The Texas governor was not the only one invoking Mr. McCain today. The Gore campaign said it was going on the air with a 30-second spot remembering the senator's criticism of Mr. Bush's tax cut and fiscal plan. ''George W. Bush is back in New Hampshire,'' it says. ''The question is will he come clear on Social Security. In this year's election John McCain said Bush's plan has not one new penny for Social Security.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush continued to criticize Mr. Gore for his claim in the last presidential debate that he does not favor big government. ''It's one of the more amazing statements of the campaign,'' he said. ''He is of Washington, by Washington, for Washington.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush criticized Mr. Gore's record at his signature project of reinventing government. 'He claimed he has significantly reduced the size of government,'' Mr. Bush said, ''but what he didn't tell you is that 87 percent of the cuts came from the Department of Defense, thousands of jobs were cut from the Department of Veterans Affairs.''</p>
        <p>For all the talk of buried hatchets, Mr. McCain has not always been an effusive supporter of the Republican ticket. On CNN's ''Larry King Live'' recently, Mr. McCain had equal praise for Dick Cheney, Mr. Bush's running mate, and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, the Democratic vice-presidential candidate. And in New Hampshire earlier this week to campaign for a local candidate, Mr. McCain said he was trying to urge young people to vote, no matter who they vote for, and ''if you don't vote for Governor Bush, I understand and respect that.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush won many spirited ovations in New Hampshire, but some in his crowd wished Mr. McCain were still in the race. ''I think he would have been a better president for the country,'' said John Allard. ''But George Bush has got the nomination, and I don't think he'll make a bad president. Of the choice, it's the best we have.''</p>
        <p>In His Own Words</p>
        <p>GEORGE W. BUSH  Remarks yesterday in Manchester, N.H.:</p>
        <p>''I could barely contain myself when my opponent, in the third debate, said he's against big government. It's one of the more amazing statements of the campaign. After all, he's proposed massive huge government, proposed three times more spending than President Clinton did, proposed a budget that's larger than Walter Mondale's and Michael Dukakis's combined.</p>
        <p>He is of Washington, by Washington, for Washington. It's one of the fundamental differences in this campaign. I want the people of this state to hear loud and clear there's a philosophical divide. This is a man who trusts Washington, D.C. As you'll hear in the policies I want to talk about, I trust the people. I trust the people of New Hampshire.</p>
        <p>Also during that debate, he claimed he has significantly reduced the size of government. But what he didn't tell you is that 87 percent of cuts came from the Department of Defense, thousands of jobs were cut from the Department of Veterans Affairs. We believe that in order to build morale in the United States military, we must keep our commitments to our veterans.''</p>
