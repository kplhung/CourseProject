        <p>As the final batted ball of the National League Championship Series descended from the dark Shea Stadium sky toward his big, blue glove, Timo Perez began jumping in jubilation. He paused briefly to catch the ball, then he started another ragged dance toward his celebrating teammates after they eliminated the St. Louis Cardinals on Monday night. Few players would have made a play quite this way, but Perez, a rookie sensation, is full of surprises.</p>
        <p>When Perez and the Mets open the World Series against the Yankees tonight at Yankee Stadium, he will probably enter the left-hand side of the batter's box as the leadoff hitter against the defending champions. He may drag a bunt and dash to first base for a hit. Or he may spring forward and slap a double to the opposite field with a short, choppy stroke of his bat. Or he may walk and steal a base. Then again, he may keep his feet still and swing from his heels for the fences.</p>

        <p>As the final batted ball of the National League Championship Series descended from the dark Shea Stadium sky toward his big, blue glove, Timo Perez began jumping in jubilation. He paused briefly to catch the ball, then he started another ragged dance toward his celebrating teammates after they eliminated the St. Louis Cardinals on Monday night. Few players would have made a play quite this way, but Perez, a rookie sensation, is full of surprises.</p>
        <p>When Perez and the Mets open the World Series against the Yankees tonight at Yankee Stadium, he will probably enter the left-hand side of the batter's box as the leadoff hitter against the defending champions. He may drag a bunt and dash to first base for a hit. Or he may spring forward and slap a double to the opposite field with a short, choppy stroke of his bat. Or he may walk and steal a base. Then again, he may keep his feet still and swing from his heels for the fences.</p>
        <p>''He is unpredictable,'' said Mike Piazza, the Mets' catcher and slugger. ''You don't know what he's going to do next.'' And, Piazza added, he keeps ''the defense on the defensive.''</p>
        <p>When Perez plays defense, usually in right field, he unnerves and surprises opposing players. In the N.L.C.S., he threw out Shawon Dunston at second base on a tag-up play at a pivotal moment in the seventh inning of Game 4. Earlier, he bluffed a throw from right field to first base, forcing a pitcher to sprint out a single. In a previous game, after catching a fly ball in a sacrifice-fly situation at Busch Stadium, Perez continued charging toward the diamond and fired to third, behind the runner, forcing him to hurry back. Without anyone backing up third base, this took nerve.</p>
        <p>''I said, 'No!' '' said Steve Phillips, the Mets' general manager. ''And then I'm like 'Yeah!' -- I thought he got him.'' Referring to the audacious quality of Perez, Phillips said: ''You knew he had no fear when he had two strikes and bunted for a base hit in San Francisco'' in the division series.</p>
        <p>Then there was that running catch in the right-field corner in St. Louis with Al Leiter on the mound. The television camera showed Leiter mouthing words of astonished praise for his newest teammate. ''This guy is amazing,'' was what Leiter said.</p>
        <p>Perez also runs the bases with speed and daring. Leading off first base, he wiggles and twitches and causes the pitcher to adjust his rhythm and to worry. Pitchers are not the only ones he rattles; at one point, three St. Louis fielders mishandled the ball during one of Perez's tours of the baselines. ''They got a little panicky,'' said Mookie Wilson, the Mets first-base coach. ''This kid, he's a diamond. Where did we find him? I don't know. But I'm glad we did.''</p>
        <p>Perez arrived for the last month of the regular season, and he became a starter in the playoffs after Derek Bell was injured in the first game against the Giants. A native of the Dominican Republic, Perez played four seasons with the Hiroshima Carp in Japan before advancing through the Mets' minor league system this season. Leiter learned about Perez from Darryl Hamilton, an outfielder who spent time with Class AAA Norfolk for injury rehabilitation.</p>
        <p>''Darryl said, 'You ought to see this guy, Timo Perez, he's going to be a star,' '' Leiter recalled. ''I was like, 'Really?' ''</p>
        <p>When he returned from Norfolk, Hamilton said, he told Manager Bobby Valentine: ''I've seen the second coming down there. It's Timo. He's legit. I know it's easy to say this now, but I thought he was a legitimate five-tool player. He's so small you figure this is one of those guys who can slap the ball around. I know it's probably crazy to say at this point, but he really hasn't shown everything he can do yet.''</p>
        <p>What else can he do?</p>
        <p>''You'll see when he starts driving the ball and putting the ball in the gaps,'' Hamilton said. ''He's got some power. He's got juice.''</p>
        <p>This comment was relayed to Perez after a workout at Shea Stadium this week.</p>
        <p>''I know I can do a lot more things,'' Perez said, speaking through an interpreter. ''There's still a lot left. Although I'm playing well, I know that when I do have 100 percent confidence, I'll be able to hit the ball harder and hit it further and hit it to all fields.''</p>
        <p>Although Perez speaks little English, he understands some Japanese and converses in that language with Benny Agbayani, the Mets' left fielder, who is from Hawaii. Perez speaks Spanish with others, including Edgardo Alfonzo, his mentor.</p>
        <p>Does he realize how nervous he makes other teams?</p>
        <p>''I think so,'' Perez said.</p>
        <p>Perez played 24 games in the regular season, batting .286 with one stolen base, three runs batted in and an inside-the-park home run. In the division series against San Francisco, he gained momentum, with a .294 average, two runs scored and three R.B.I. Against St. Louis in the N.L.C.S., he tied a League Championship Series record with eight runs scored while batting .304.</p>
        <p>Valentine has used Perez at the top of the order, giving the Mets their first real leadoff hitter since early in the season, before they released Rickey Henderson. ''It's hard to think that we didn't call him up sooner, knowing he has this kind of ability,'' Valentine said.</p>
        <p>In an era in which some athletes are oversized because of weight training and nutritional supplements, Perez is relatively slight. Listed at 5 feet 9 and 167 pounds, he seems smaller. Some question his age: the Mets' records say he is 23; some rumors say he is at least 30.</p>
        <p>''He's not that old,'' Phillips said. ''His mother brought her passport in. It says she's 41.'' His mother is currently visiting relatives in the Bronx. Perez is living in a hotel room. Phillips has more precise numbers concerning Perez's salary.</p>
        <p>''He's on a basic $200,000 salary that is prorated for the time he is with us,'' Phillips said. That means Perez is an astonishing $36,000 bargain.</p>
        <p>The fear among Mets fans might be that the Perez magic will wear off or that the Yankees scouts have discovered a way to nullify him. Or that his boldness will backfire on the big stage during a crucial play that will shake his confidence and deflate his team. But even if he never does another good thing for the Mets, the mystery and mystique of Perez is -- at a minimum -- a brief and bright page in team history, even if his teammates do not yet know quite what to make of him.</p>
        <p>''You can't really tell what's going on in his mind by his facial expression because he doesn't have any,'' Hamilton said. ''I'm sure it's helped by the fact that he doesn't speak English too well and he doesn't hear all the stuff in the stands, all the screaming. It doesn't bother him at all. It's impressive watching him. I don't care what kind of player you are or what kind of fan you are, you've got to realize he's helped this ball club tremendously.''</p>
