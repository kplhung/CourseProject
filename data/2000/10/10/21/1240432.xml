        <p>TURKEY, ARMENIA: PRAISE AND REGRET  Turkey praised the United States Congress's abandonment of a resolution accusing Turks of genocide against Armenians 85 years ago, but Armenia said it regretted the action. Turkey said the move had removed a major threat to Turkish-American relations. A spokesman for Armenia's Foreign Ministry, Ara Papyan, said Armenia again appealed to Turkey for direct talks to resolve the issue.</p>

        <p>FRANCE: GO-AHEAD TO TRY QADDAFI  A court ruled that Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi of Libya could be prosecuted in France for the bombing of a French airliner over Niger in 1989, in which 170 people died. The court rejected the argument that Colonel Qaddafi had immunity as a head of state. Instead, the court said he could be brought to court for ''complicity in murder in relation to a terrorist act.''</p>
