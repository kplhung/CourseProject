        <p>If elected president, George W. Bush plans to tell NATO that the United States should no longer participate in peacekeeping in the Balkans, signaling a major new division of labor in the Western alliance, according to Mr. Bush's senior national security aide.</p>
        <p>Under this arrangement, peacekeeping in Bosnia and Kosovo would become a European responsibility, as could peacekeeping in other conflicts. The United States, in contrast, would focus on deterring and fighting wars in the Persian Gulf, Asia and other distant trouble spots.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's plan would represent the most important revision of NATO tasks since the cold war. His aides say the change is long overdue and would let the American military concentrate its training and financing on traditional combat missions.</p>
        <p>''The governor is talking about a new division of labor,'' Condoleezza Rice, the security adviser, said in an interview. ''The United States is the only power that can handle a showdown in the gulf, mount the kind of force that is needed to protect Saudi Arabia and deter a crisis in the Taiwan Straits. And extended peacekeeping detracts from our readiness for these kinds of global missions.''</p>
        <p>In outlining the approach, Ms. Rice was providing the strategic rationale behind many of Mr. Bush's general comments in the campaign about using American military power and his repeated contentions that extended peacekeeping missions and humanitarian operations had undermined military readiness. In sharp contrast, his opponent, Vice President Al Gore, has said that if anything, Washington should take a more active role in using troops to prevent conflicts abroad.</p>
        <p>Ms. Rice acknowledged that revising NATO's military tasks was delicate. Although Mr. Bush plans to make the redivision of military tasks a major objective, if elected, he plans to consult the Europeans and is not planning ''precipitous'' actions.</p>
        <p>Many European allies have been insistent that the United States share the risks of Balkan operations. Britain is quite likely to be extremely concerned about suggestions that Washington might withdraw its forces from the Balkans, NATO specialists said, while the French may see it as opportunity to diminish the American influence in Europe.</p>
        <p>Some European critics also said securing the peace in the Balkans was NATO's premier post-cold-war mission, one that has given the alliance an important rationale after the collapse of the Soviet threat.</p>
        <p>''The Balkans is the new NATO mission,'' said Terence Taylor, assistant director of the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies. ''The United States has infantry and tanks in Germany. And if it is not going to send them to the Balkans, what are they are there for, anyway? Stopping the former Warsaw Pact from rolling westward? It is almost as if they are going back to the cold war.''</p>
        <p>The Balkan peacekeeping debate is part of a broader election-year dispute over the use of American power. The often partisan debate has also featured differences over military readiness, Pentagon spending and missile defense.</p>
        <p>The peacekeeping debate has especially powerful implications for the NATO alliance and raises a number of critical questions. Should the leader of the alliance share the same risks and burdens in the Balkans as its European allies? Or would the West's security be better served if the American military did not have to worry about Balkan peacekeeping and could focus on other missions?</p>
        <p>Can the United States continue to shape Western policy toward the region if it no longer has troops on the ground? Can it continue to exert the same degree of influence in European security policy?</p>
        <p>American policy toward the Balkans has a tortured history. When President Clinton ran for office in 1992, he complained that the Bush administration had stayed on the sidelines as the Serbs turned Bosnia into a killing ground. But in office, the Clinton administration was initially slow to act.</p>
        <p>Unlike the Europeans, Washington at first drew the line at sending peacekeeping troops to Bosnia. As the civilian toll rose, however, the administration pressed for a NATO bombing campaign. That succeeded in pressing the Serbs to go along with a Bosnia accord.</p>
        <p>In 1995, Washington sent 25,000 American troops to help police the region, saying the troops would be stationed there for a year.</p>
        <p>Today, the United States is still involved in Bosnia peacekeeping and is carrying out peacekeeping duties in Kosovo, as well. Still, the size of the American contingent has shrunk, and the Europeans are bearing most of the burden.</p>
        <p>The United States peacekeeping force in the Bosnia and Kosovo totals 11,400 troops, according to the Pentagon. That is less than one-fifth of the 65,000-member NATO peacekeeping force in the region, and it is a fraction of the 120,000-member American military presence in Europe.</p>
        <p>In budgetary terms, the Balkan mission accounts for a small part of Pentagon spending. The United States allocated $3.5 billion in the fiscal 2000 budget year for Balkan peacekeeping, slightly more than 1 percent of the Pentagon's annual $280 billion budget.</p>
        <p>Longtime NATO hands say the American effort in the Balkans is extremely modest, given the United States' role as leader of the Western alliance and the fact that Balkan security has emerged as a primary mission for the alliance.</p>
        <p>''If we want to have any influence in NATO on the Balkans, we are probably at the bottom line,'' said Wesley K. Clark, the retired United States Army general who commanded NATO in the Kosovo campaign. ''When allies are putting in more than 80 percent of effort, there is not much room for an argument about burden-sharing. If we want to be part of this, we can't do much less.''</p>
        <p>In the campaign, Mr. Gore has taken a similar stance. For him, Balkan peacekeeping is one of NATO's primary tasks and an example of the operation that the American military needs to undertake to support American diplomacy in the post-cold-war world.</p>
        <p>In addition to deterring and fighting wars, Mr. Gore says, the armed forces should prepare for peacekeeping missions, delivering relief supplies and rebuilding institutions in war-ravaged nations, activities that the Pentagon calls nation building.</p>
        <p>To help the military carry out such a broad array of tasks, Mr. Gore says, he would earmark $80 billion of the federal surplus for military programs over 10 years. An additional $20 billion would be spent on international programs.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush says he would spend $45 billion of the surplus on the military over 10 years.</p>
        <p>''The linchpin of our policy is forward engagement,'' said Gordon Adams, a senior adviser to Mr. Gore on military issues and a former top Clinton administration budget official. ''We have a wide range of instruments to deal with the problems, diplomatic, economic and military.</p>
        <p>''If you say you can use everything except the military, you have deprived yourself of one of those instruments. The Bush team has a curiously old-fashioned view. We will have a well-funded military that is designed to go nowhere and prepared do nothing, because they are only there to fight the nation's wars, and we are not having any.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush has contended that the military has been run ragged by peacekeeping and humanitarian work, missions that are taking a toll on morale and readiness.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Bush does not oppose all involvement in peacekeeping, he and his advisers say prolonged peacekeeping operations make it more difficult for the armed forces to prepare for major wars.</p>
        <p>''This comes down to function,'' Ms. Rice said. ''Carrying out civil administration and police functions is simply going to degrade the American capability to do the things America has to do. We don't need to have the 82nd Airborne escorting kids to kindergarten.''</p>
        <p>In outlining a new division of responsibilities for NATO, Ms. Rice said the United States would not immediately withdraw from the Balkans but would inform NATO that its goal is to turn over the entire responsibility of stationing peacekeeping troops to its European allies.</p>
        <p>The United States would continue to provide intelligence, help with communications, transport and do other logistical work after withdrawing its peacekeeping troops. In outlining that approach, aides to Mr. Bush have in mind East Timor, where an Australian-led peacekeeping mission received United States logistical support. Although East Timor represents one possible approach for Mr. Gore, it seems be the main model for Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>''We are not withdrawing from Europe,'' Ms. Rice said. ''We are not withdrawing the kind of support we can provide, like air power. But when it comes to nation-building or civilian administration or indefinite peacekeeping, we do need for the Europeans to step up to their responsibilities. We are not going to do anything precipitous, but unless we set this as a firm goal we will never get it done.''</p>
        <p>In Europe, many allied officials complain that the American debate on the Balkans overlooks their contribution. They say that their forces are also stretched thin by the Balkan operation and that Americans do not seem to appreciate that they provide most of the economic aid.</p>
        <p>Some also said Mr. Bush's program might give impetus to Europeans' efforts to develop their own military arrangements, perhaps more of a stimulus than Washington might like, given its goal to influence security policy in Europe.</p>
        <p>Many allied officials are also haunted by the early 1990's, when they had troops in Bosnia and the United States did not. That case led to bitter disputes over strategy, and many Europeans are determined that it should never be repeated.</p>
        <p>When the Clinton administration first suggested lifting the arms embargo on the beleaguered Bosnian Muslims and carrying out bombing strikes on Serbian forces, European allies complained that the plan would endanger their troops while the United States watched from a safe distance. As a result, many allied officials said, NATO should do everything to avoid a situation where European and United States officials do not face comparable risks on the ground.</p>
        <p>Ms. Rice said that the Balkan situation was far more stable now and that the United States would not leave its allies to face a dangerous threat on their own. But European anxieties remain.</p>
        <p>''There is a huge difference between providing logistics and air support and having your forces at the sharp end where a conflict might arise,'' Mr. Taylor said. ''It is not burden-sharing to say, 'You guys go out and take the risk of getting killed, and if there are problems we will provide air support.' Putting American forces at risk is a fundamental to assuring that there is a political commitment from Washington. American feet on the ground is vital.''</p>
