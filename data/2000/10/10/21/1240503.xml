        <p>There were gently churning ceiling fans. There were comfortable cane seats. In the summer, a cool breeze might rustle the pages of your carefully folded newspaper.</p>
        <p>You couldn't, however, order a sloe gin fizz from anyone because this was not the veranda of a grand Atlantic City hotel.</p>
        <p>This was the New York City subway, circa 1956.</p>
        <p>And there was no mistaking it for a resort, especially if you were riding one of the fortress-like steel trains, called D-types, that once ran along the Brighton Line near Ebbets Field.</p>
        <p>They were the heaviest trains ever to lumber under or above New York, weighing in at 100 tons per car. The low roar inside was so loud that conversation was nearly impossible.</p>
        <p>And yet, according to New Yorkers who remember them well, the D-type trains were not the loudest. That  distinction went to the IRT trains, like the ones that took fans up to Yankee Stadium. Those trains -- known as Low-V's, for their low-voltage control systems -- had open doors at the ends of the cars and rock-quarry decibel levels inside.</p>
        <p>''=You really shouldn't romanticize them too much,'' said Brian Cudahy. ''Unless you remember what it was like to ride any of them on a 90-degree summer day when you just could not wait to get out because you could not breathe.''</p>
        <p>When looked at closely, it turns out that the differences between the subway of 2000 and the subway of 1956 are smaller than one might think.</p>
        <p>For the year 1956, transit officials recorded 1.33 billion spins of the turnstile. For 1999, the ridership number was 1.3 billion.</p>
        <p>According to several experts, trains were scheduled to come more frequently in 1956, especially during the off-hours. But the trains could not accelerate as quickly back then, meaning that running times for local service were somewhat slower.</p>
        <p>And on the calculus of coolness, then versus now, it's kind of a wash. In 1956, the interior of the trains could be like ovens in the summer. But because the older trains had no air conditioners pumping out heat into the tunnels, the platforms would be tolerably cool until at least August, remembered Donald Harold, a former Transit Authority employee.</p>
        <p>As young men, Mr. Harold and Mr. Cudahy went to the same Brooklyn seminary, Cathedral College of the Immaculate Conception, in Fort Greene. Neither man became a priest. But they both maintained a high degree of their fervor for the subways: Mr. Harold, 69, founded the New York Transit Museum in 1976; Mr. Cudahy, 64, has written three books about the subways.</p>
        <p>They both tell fantastic stories about the subway and about baseball. But this one by Mr. Harold, about not taking the subway, is the one that deserves repeating:</p>
        <p>He was working at a bank in Brooklyn in 1956 when one of his bosses gave him a ticket to the seventh game of the World Series, at Ebbets field. Mr. Harold went to grab a bite before heading to the subway and the game.</p>
        <p>''The guy is cooking my hamburger and I look at my watch and say, 'Mickey, could you kind of speed it up?' and I held up my ticket for him to see. The gentleman sitting next to me looks over and sees the ticket and his eyes get big and he says: 'Mickey, I ordered a hamburger. You give him mine.' But then the guy sitting on the other side of me turns out to be the chauffeur for the president of the bank. And he says, 'Take your time; I'll drive you over to the game.''</p>
        <p>''And so that's how I got driven to the seventh game of the 1956 World Series in a black Cadillac limousine,'' he said. ''And that's the truth.''</p>
