        <p>In Scranton, Pa., the Business Roundtable's newborn babies are fighting the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s kindly pharmacist. The National Republican Congressional Committee is represented by a Sherlock Holmes impersonator. The United States Chamber of Commerce features an elderly consumer picking up medicine (but not from the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s druggist). And the Sierra Club is providing a soothing interlude for voters with pristine streams and forests.</p>
        <p>Every now and then, the candidates in Pennsylvania's 10th Congressional District muscle their way onto the television screens, promising jobs or drug benefits or better schools. But the two men -- Representative Donald L. Sherwood, a freshman Republican, and Patrick Casey, his Democratic challenger -- seem like afterthoughts in a prime example of special interests taking over the local airwaves in the national battle for control of Congress.</p>
        <p>Kenneth Goldstein, a University of Wisconsin political scientist studying this race and others where outside interests are buying up the commercial breaks, said that this contest was among the top five in the country for the use of interest group advertisements.</p>
        <p>Most of the advertisements in Scranton, Mr. Goldstein said, are ''doughnut ads,'' those where the name or face of the local candidate can be inserted.</p>
        <p>Local newscasts are the prime forum, and as many as seven political advertisements may fill the gap between weather and sports. Presidential and Senate candidates and even a state assembly hopeful join in, but the special interests are worrying about the House, and the 10th District seat is one that the Democrats hope to win for the net gain of seven seats they need to control the House.</p>
        <p>David Bochnowich, the Republican chairman in the district's most populous county, Lackawanna, said: ''I think we've got a very, very close race. I think we haven't focused on any singular issues that are taxing the voters.'' Patrick Mellody, his Democratic counterpart, said that because of all the advertisements, ''the issues are sort of confused.''</p>
        <p>The baby advertisement may break through the blur because it looks different. The Business Roundtable, a group of about 200 chief executives of large corporations, is spending $6 million around the nation, backing four Republican senators, 23 Republican representatives and 12 Democratic representatives. The litmus test was whether they voted for permanent national trade relations with China.</p>
        <p>But the advertisement does not say that. Over pictures of cute infants with arms and legs reaching out, a woman's voice proclaims: ''Our children are our future, and their future should include affordable, quality health care, the very best education possible, a meaningful job, and an America opening foreign markets around the globe, spreading peace and prosperity. That's what Congressman Sherwood has been fighting for.''</p>
        <p>The A.F.L.-C.I.O. advertisement shows a pharmacist and elderly customers. The pharmacist says: ''Senior citizens today can't afford their medication. They come in and I know they're skipping medication so they can pay for their food.'' He continues: ''Yet Congressman Don Sherwood sided with the drug industry. He voted no to guaranteed Medicare prescription benefits that would protect seniors from runaway prices.''</p>
        <p>The National Republican Congressional Committee advertisement drapes Mr. Casey in a double-billed Sherlock Holmes cap, citing a story about two Democrats going to a Sherwood meeting and then denouncing the A.F.L.-C.I.O. advertisements as ''completely false.''</p>
        <p>Citizens for Better Medicare, the campaign voice of the pharmaceutical industry, has a spot showing an elderly woman, Edith Campodonico, saying: ''I paint, I write and I have my family. And I'm pretty stable with my cancer. I would be struggling very hard if it weren't for medicines.'' The announcer says, ''Congressman Sherwood is working to strengthen Medicare and provide a prescription drug benefit to make sure medicines are available for every senior who needs them.''</p>
        <p>Another pro-Sherwood group, the Chamber of Commerce, attacks Mr. Casey's support for making prescription drug coverage a part of Medicare. The Chamber's elderly consumer, sitting with his golden retriever, says, ''I heard that Patrick Casey supports the White House prescription drug plan,'' which might cost him his good company retirement benefits. The elderly consumer may have heard that, but Mr. Casey, to avoid being pinned down, has never said it and does not have a particular plan he supports.</p>
        <p>The Sierra Club, broadcasting its advertisements less often and only on cable, shows streams and woods and tells voters that Mr. Casey wants to keep them clean and Mr. Sherwood does not.</p>
        <p>The candidates have their own messages. Mr. Sherwood's advertisements claim that he has brought jobs to the district, and that that has brought children back home. Another advertisement warns of the ''risk'' of electing Mr. Casey, ''a lawyer for insurance companies.''</p>
        <p>The latest Casey advertisements focus on prescription drugs. In one, the announcer says, ''Pat Casey supports providing a guaranteed prescription drug benefit to all seniors through Medicare.'' Then, with Mr. Sherwood speaking at a lectern, it says: ''Sherwood voted to give $40 billion of the taxpayers' money to the insurance companies and H.M.O.'s, hoping they'll start covering prescription drugs. These are the same H.M.O.'s dropping seniors all over northeastern Pennsylvania.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mellody, the Democratic chairman, argued that Mr. Casey had ''a stronger grass-roots campaign than he did last time.'' But, he acknowledged, Mr. Sherwood has been working hard, even in Democratic territory.</p>
        <p>''He hasn't missed a meeting or an event in Lackawanna County in two years,'' Mr. Mellody said.</p>
