        <p>As Navy pallbearers in dress whites loaded the flag-draped aluminum coffins of the last four sailors recovered from the destroyer Cole into an American military plane here tonight, two crumpled-looking Yemeni colonels in khaki uniforms and red berets stood at attention. Beside them, in a stiff salute and immaculately tailored and crisply pressed, stood an American admiral and the United States ambassador.</p>
        <p>The tableau marked the end of the first, wrenching phase of work for Task Force Determined Response, the 3,000 American military and civilian personnel rushed to Aden after the bombing eight days ago. But the short ceremony symbolized something more than closure for the Americans attending.</p>
        <p>For more than 30 years before the Cole attack, Aden -- a Marxist redoubt from 1967 to 1994, with a mountainous hinterland that became a base for Islamic terrorist operations in the 1990's -- has been a place to make Westerners wary. These fault lines have come under new strain as Americans have poured in here in numbers, and in a style that has made a not universally welcome statement about American might, wealth and technological prowess.</p>
        <p>Barbara K. Bodine, the American ambassador, calls it ''the American footprint,'' and says every effort has been made to keep it as unobtrusive as the imperatives of the Cole recovery and inquiry allow.</p>
        <p>''We see ourselves as being here as respectful guests, and hopefully as sensitive ones,'' she said after the airport ceremony tonight.</p>
        <p>Borrowing a phrase used by Louis J. Freeh, director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, when he visited Aden for the day Thursday, she added: ''We are partners in this with the Yemenis, but we are junior partners. We are not taking over, and we don't want to look like we're taking over.''</p>
        <p>Partly to keep the footprint from becoming overwhelming, all but about 300 of the Americans here are living offshore. The remaining 2,700, including 2,000 Marines aboard the helicopter-carrier Tarawa, are on a seven-ship Navy flotilla that the Pentagon says is being used mainly for the Cole recovery work. It is also providing sleeping space and meals for those who would otherwise need rooms in overstretched Aden hotels, which are vulnerable to attack, Americans say.</p>
        <p>Sensitive to complaints from some Yemeni leftists and Islamic radicals about ''gunboat diplomacy,'' the Navy has pointedly said that the flotilla is ''over the horizon,'' meaning that it is anchored well outside the Bay of Aden, far from the Cole, and  not visible from the city.</p>
        <p>Those onshore are mainly quartered at the Aden Hotel Movenpick, a nine-story tower overlooking the harbor, which has been turned into something of a Fortress America since the bombing. Among the contingent are specialized Navy divers, F.B.I. agents and Navy intelligence officers, as well as Marines in combat gear, dog-handlers, embassy staff members, communications specialists and information officers.</p>
        <p>At the airport, military transport planes have been landing round the clock. Cargoes have included minivans to transport Americans around; satellite communications equipment so secret that American television crews filming standups on the Aden Hotel rooftop have been ordered not to show it; miles of thick wiring needed to create secure telephone links from the hotel to the harbor; sniffer and guard dogs; and pallets of bottled water for workers coping with the 100-degree heat and near-100-percent humidity.</p>
        <p>Navy helicopters have shuttled frequently from the Aden container port beside the Cole to the American armada. In the harbor, Navy launches move purposefully around the Cole. Occasionally, from a harborside vantage point a mile away -- as close as reporters have been allowed to get -- the launches can be seen approaching the gaping hole in the ship's port side, then disgorging F.B.I. specialists wearing white coveralls and plastic gloves into the blasted interior.</p>
        <p>Officials of the F.B.I.'s New York office -- assigned to lead the inquiry because of their experience in the T.W.A. Flight 800 crash in 1996 and the World Trade Center bombing in 1993 -- have said an imported ''complete forensics laboratory'' gives them all the analytical tools they would have at home.</p>
        <p>Most Yemenis seem to have watched all this with a mixture of excitement and wonder. But there has been an undercurrent of unease, too, at suddenly seeing this quiet, dilapidated backwater, a place where many cars lost their hubcaps long ago, transformed overnight into something resembling a set from an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie. In a few cases, the unease has extended to outright anger, mostly from leftists and Islamic radicals.</p>
        <p>But for every jarring incident, there are a score revealing that the Cole attack brought a silver lining to ordinary Yemenis: the arrival of a distant, powerful, cosmopolitan world. It has carried Yemenis old enough to remember back to the days before 1967, when Aden was a favored crossroads between the Middle East and Africa, Europe and Asia. ''Most Yemenis wish they would never go home,'' said Bashraheel Hisham Bashraheel, a senior editor of Al Ayyam, Aden's largest independently owned newspaper.</p>
