        <p>Veronica Guerin, a courageous Dublin newspaper reporter whose articles had enraged the underworld, was shot and killed in 1996 as she sat in her car at a suburban intersection.

        <p>Veronica Guerin, a courageous Dublin newspaper reporter whose articles had enraged the underworld, was shot and killed in 1996 as she sat in her car at a suburban intersection. Her investigative reports on her country's drug traffic had been alarming; her death further underscored the power of organized crime in Ireland and prompted the government to dedicate greater resources to addressing that power.</p>
        <p>Fittingly, Irish filmmakers created a somber hagiographic drama based on Guerin's life and death. The feature, ''When the Sky Falls,'' has been shown in theaters in Ireland and Britain, and it is being introduced in the United States via television, tomorrow night on Cinemax. That's fitting, too, for in its simple storytelling, preachy tone and ripped-from-the-headlines theme, this production feels just like an American made-for-television movie, except that the characters all have Irish accents.</p>
        <p>One of those accents, or at least a convincing approximation, emerges from the familiar Illinois-bred face of Joan Allen, perhaps an odd choice to play this Irish heroine. Ms. Allen has been praised for the depth of her portrayal of a principled United States senator in the current political thriller ''The Contender.'' But she is given no such opportunity here, for her character, Sinead Hamilton, has all the depth of a plaster saint. The film, directed by John Mackenzie from a script by Michael Sheridan and Ronan Gallagher, offers a true-life character who is too good to be true.</p>
        <p>A relative newcomer to journalism, Sinead has become her paper's star reporter through her dogged pursuit of organized crime. This loving wife and mother thinks nothing of walking with her young son up to a man she knows to be an Irish Republican Army enforcer and assertively requesting an interview.</p>
        <p>''Is it better for me to be half ignorant,'' she asks him, ''or to know the whole story?''</p>
        <p>He replies, ''I'd say being half ignorant is too much of a compliment for any journalist.''</p>
        <p>The film shares this jaundiced view of newshounds, including Sinead's lazy competitors and her cowardly editors, who have scant appreciation for the chances she takes and the papers she sells. And while the film's crooks are a sick, violent lot, its police officers are only slightly more scrupulous. (The I.R.A. men, who share Sinead's distaste for nonpolitical outlaws, are allowed a bit more nobility.)</p>
        <p>Chief among the tarnished cops is the humorless Sergeant Mackey (Patrick Bergin), who cooperates with Sinead only because he thinks she can help him get his nemesis, a crime boss named Hackett (Gerard Flynn). But it's Hackett who gets Sinead, savagely beating her in one of the film's many bloodily graphic scenes, most of which are abruptly and predictably contrasted with sunny glimpses of Sinead's domestic tranquillity.</p>
        <p>The thoroughly evil Hackett is the only character in the film who seems to have even a moment's pleasure, as in the pointless but discreetly composed sequence in which he is gratified orally in the back room of his nightclub by a woman who then takes a quick sip of water and steps out into the club to deliver an entire chorus of ''Don't It Make My Brown Eyes Blue.'' In another context, that might seem vaguely ironic. But this film is too grim for irony.</p>
        <p>Sinead may drink, smoke and cuss like one of the boys, but the film's one fully formed character is her husband, Tom. He is played by Kevin McNally, who manages to make you believe in Tom's mixture of devotion to his wife and revulsion for her dangerous work.</p>
        <p>''If you tell me to stop, I'll stop,'' she tells him at one point.</p>
        <p>She may be fooling herself, but she can't fool Tom, who sadly replies, ''If I told you to stop, you'd leave me.''</p>
        <p>Why can't she stop? Why does she put herself and her family in danger? There could be many plausible answers, from vanity to the love of adventure to dedicated selflessness. The best explanation Sinead can muster, in a chat with one of her underworld sources, is ''I'm worried about my kid.''</p>
        <p>It may not be Ms. Allen's fault, but the viewer is left to fill in the blanks in her performance. Her martyred Sinead may be admirable, but that isn't the same as interesting.</p>
        <p>WHEN THE SKY FALLS  Cinemax, tomorrow night at 10</p>
