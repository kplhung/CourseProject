        <p>Although Yankees Manager Joe Torre continued to assert yesterday that Denny Neagle did not pitch aggressively enough in his last start, he said that Neagle had not been dropped from the team's World Series starting rotation as a result. Torre has not named a starting pitcher for Game 4 of the World Series, which is to be played Wednesday at Shea Stadium, leading to speculation that the Yankees would start David Cone over Neagle. But Torre has not made that official.</p>
        <p>''I want to see how things shake out,'' he said after yesterday's workout at Yankee Stadium. Torre fueled the speculation by saying Thursday that Cone, despite his 4-14 record in the regular season, might be a good candidate to pitch at Shea, because he is a former Met and has more postseason experience with the Yankees than Neagle, who joined the team July 12.</p>

        <p>Although Yankees Manager Joe Torre continued to assert yesterday that Denny Neagle did not pitch aggressively enough in his last start, he said that Neagle had not been dropped from the team's World Series starting rotation as a result. Torre has not named a starting pitcher for Game 4 of the World Series, which is to be played Wednesday at Shea Stadium, leading to speculation that the Yankees would start David Cone over Neagle. But Torre has not made that official.</p>
        <p>''I want to see how things shake out,'' he said after yesterday's workout at Yankee Stadium. Torre fueled the speculation by saying Thursday that Cone, despite his 4-14 record in the regular season, might be a good candidate to pitch at Shea, because he is a former Met and has more postseason experience with the Yankees than Neagle, who joined the team July 12.</p>
        <p>Torre also said Thursday that Neagle appeared to prefer nibbling at the edges of the strike zone in his last start. He allowed three runs and walked four in four and a third innings in a 6-2 loss to Seattle in Game 5 of the American League Championship Series. Asked for a clarification, Torre said, ''I didn't think he was as aggressive as he was in the first game.''</p>
        <p>Neagle, who said Thursday that he did not want to cause a controversy if he did not start, was visibly upset yesterday when he was asked about Torre's evaluation. He said he planned to talk to Torre about it. ''That's one thing I definitely disagree with,'' Neagle said, ''because I pitched to my strengths.''</p>
        <p>What happened, Neagle said, is that the strike zone seemed to shrink as the game went on. He felt he was being ''squeezed,'' to use a baseball term. Torre said that could be true and that he drew his conclusion ''probably because of the result.''</p>
