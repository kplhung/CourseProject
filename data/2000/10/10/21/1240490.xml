        <p>I am going to need some mantras to get through this Subway Series. The sort murmured by people who are afraid to fly, like, ''I have a better chance of being kicked to death by a mule than dying on this aircraft.'' I will twist that soothing phrase to apply to the odds of losing to the Mets.</p>
        <p>I'm not kidding myself, of course. I have spent years mocking the Mets and their haplessness, and I know things are different this year. I've caught their games, I've suffered our slumps. The hurt of a perpetually tight stomach is on.</p>

        <p>I am going to need some mantras to get through this Subway Series. The sort murmured by people who are afraid to fly, like, ''I have a better chance of being kicked to death by a mule than dying on this aircraft.'' I will twist that soothing phrase to apply to the odds of losing to the Mets.</p>
        <p>I'm not kidding myself, of course. I have spent years mocking the Mets and their haplessness, and I know things are different this year. I've caught their games, I've suffered our slumps. The hurt of a perpetually tight stomach is on.</p>
        <p>I fell in love with the New York Yankees about the same time I fell in love with my husband. Dating him meant spending many a Saturday at Yankee Stadium, in his season-ticket seats in the upper deck box behind home plate. He would keep score with those tiny little pencils and take frequent peeks into his binoculars, and I would read back issues of magazines and sip hot chocolate.</p>
        <p>Soon, though, I realized I knew the name of every player, and had a good sense of how each one's season was going. I found out Derek Jeter was from my home town. As I picked up on strategic moves and all the seemingly anachronistic rules, I became more and more hooked. I learned to keep score.</p>
        <p>Soon, my husband would come home and find me plopped on the couch with a large cup in one hand and the remote in the other, screaming at the TV. I can't say he hasn't at times become frightened.</p>
        <p>When our baby came along, the season tickets ended, but not my addiction. We did get her to the last home game last year. She ate strained sweet potatoes and those weird little pellets of ice cream served in a mini Yankees cap. It was sublime.</p>
        <p>There are undue influences. Relatives in Houston who are rabid Astros fans. Other New Yorkers who actually like another team. Pause here for a haiku.</p>
        <p>Be what you want, child</p>
        <p>Doctor, Verizon worker</p>
        <p>But not a Mets fan</p>
        <p>I can't say it has always been easy. Watching Andy Pettitte struggle on the mound has caused me to rip my hair out, strand by strand. There have been inexplicable personnel moves: Irabu, we hardly knew ye.</p>
        <p>But I do help my fellas out. Take the sixth game of the American League Championship Series last Tuesday night. It was the bottom of the fourth, bases loaded, Yankees losing to the Mariners 4-0. Up came Jorge Posada.</p>
        <p>I felt tense, but I knew just what to do. I would watch one pitch, then flip to the presidential debate and watch the response to one question. After one candidate said nothing of substance about the Middle East, and the second was well on his way to doing the same, I flipped back to see players running the bases as Posada's double to right field dribbled toward the fence. These are important tactics, known in my house as ''reverse the curse.''</p>
        <p>Don't ask me how it all works, but I do enjoy doing my part. But fellas, you have to want it too.</p>
