        <p>David DeWitt reviews 3, collection of short plays produced by Sanctuary Theater Workshop: Eugene O'Neill's play Before Breakfast, directed by Rip Torn, with Danae Torn; Juliana Francis's Box, directed by Tony Torn, with Funda Duyal; and Chay Costello's Pandora's Box of Sweets, directed by Tony Torn, with Susan Tierney; photo (M)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>In the strangely hilarious ''Pandora's Box of Sweets,'' Susan Tierney's deity assumes the stage with a blithe acceptance of fantastical female entitlement. She wears a princess gown and exaggerated makeup; her bright eyes flash with delight as she chooses among her culinary tokens of affection, sweets that she often spears on the points of her tiara. Imagine an eclair atop a model's blond mane.</p>
        <p>But as the title implies, there is a warning hidden in Pandora's egocentric wonder-world. As Ms. Tierney opens a candy box with glee, its lid is flashed to the audience. On it is a word: ''Danger!''</p>

        <p>In the strangely hilarious ''Pandora's Box of Sweets,'' Susan Tierney's deity assumes the stage with a blithe acceptance of fantastical female entitlement. She wears a princess gown and exaggerated makeup; her bright eyes flash with delight as she chooses among her culinary tokens of affection, sweets that she often spears on the points of her tiara. Imagine an eclair atop a model's blond mane.</p>
        <p>But as the title implies, there is a warning hidden in Pandora's egocentric wonder-world. As Ms. Tierney opens a candy box with glee, its lid is flashed to the audience. On it is a word: ''Danger!''</p>
        <p>Chay Costello's creative script is the bold last segment of ''3,'' a collection of short plays produced by the Sanctuary Theater Workshop at 135, a performance space on West 42nd Street. The plays -- one by Eugene O'Neill, all essentially solo pieces -- depict varied ways in which these women are trapped in the conundrums of their unique identities.</p>
        <p>Though ''3'' lacks an integrated polish of production values, its simplicity belies a serious respect for its material.</p>
        <p>O'Neill's ''Before Breakfast,'' directed by the actor Rip Torn and featuring his daughter, Danae Torn, is the first and longest play of ''3.'' O'Neill's protagonist -- or is she the antagonist? -- is Mrs. Rowland, who trudges through the domestic tasks of her morning while literally nagging her drunken poet of a husband to death.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Rowland's concerns are familiar to anyone who has encountered Mary Tyrone in ''Long Day's Journey Into Night.'' A lost child is discussed; the intoxicated relief of a ''tonic'' is mentioned; and the burden of living in an artist's shadow overwhelms all. ''They don't know my side of it,'' Mrs. Rowland claims.</p>
        <p>But would anyone want to? Mrs. Rowland may be bound by her frustrating circumstances, she may be surviving by her strength to badger, but she is hardly an appealing portrait. That seems particularly true in this production; with the playing area at a distance from the audience, Ms. Torn's performance rarely feels intimate, and it lacks the subtle rhythms of silence and outburst that might evoke sympathy.</p>
        <p>Still, ''Before Breakfast'' is no throwaway effort; it demands, and earns, thought.</p>
        <p>More successful is ''Box,'' the second of the evening's plays. Like ''Pandora's Box of Sweets,'' ''Box'' is directed by Tony Torn, Mr. Torn's son, with an appealing lack of compromise. It depicts Anastasia, a peep-show worker from Ukraine, as she bides her time while catering to customers from behind a pane of plastic.</p>
        <p>''Box'' is not simply a bit of sexual exploitation, to the credit of the playwright, Juliana Francis. In this slice of Anastasia's life, the heroine manages an innocent dignity amid the humdrum and humiliating parts of her job.</p>
        <p>As Anastasia, Funda Duyal gives a remarkably natural performance, quietly slurping her soda through a curly straw between sex acts. There's triumph in her funny rendering of ''My Heart Will Go On,'' in which she tries to match the singer Celine Dion's bold phrasing as a way to pass her time.</p>
        <p>Anastasia may be framed by her peep-show window, but she is revealed as human, no cartoon. That regard for truth of character makes the 15-minute ''Box'' and its brief sister plays worthwhile.</p>
        <p>3</p>
