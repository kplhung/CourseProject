        <p>PIAZZA UNMASKED -- Mike Piazza, the Mets' All-Star catcher, will not be behind the plate in Game 1. He will be the designated hitter and Todd Pratt will be the Mets' catcher.</p>
        <p>NEW YORK, 1956 -- Back then, there were day games, the cold war, neighborhood loyalty, invisible masses. The Subway Series of 1956 was played in a city very different from today's.</p>
