        <p>A former sergeant in the United States Army has directly linked Osama bin Laden for the first time to the bombing of the American Embassy in Nairobi, Kenya, in 1998. The link came as the former sergeant, Ali A. Mohamed, pleaded guilty yesterday to participating in a terrorist conspiracy against Americans.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mohamed said that in 1993, Mr. bin Laden asked him to conduct surveillance of American, British, French and Israeli targets in Nairobi.</p>
        <p>Among those targets, which Mr. Mohamed said were chosen to retaliate against the United States for its intervention in the civil war in Somalia, was the American Embassy in Nairobi. ''I took pictures, drew diagrams and wrote a report,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He took the materials to Khartoum, Sudan, where he said they were ''reviewed by Osama bin Laden.''</p>
        <p>''Bin Laden looked at the picture of the American Embassy and pointed to where a truck could go as a suicide bomber,'' Mr. Mohamed told Judge Leonard B. Sand of Federal District Court in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mohamed's guilty plea is a tremendous victory for the government, which is preparing to place five other defendants on trial on charges relating to the bombings and a broader terrorist conspiracy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mohamed seems likely to be able to give prosecutors -- and ultimately a jury -- an extraordinary look into the secret world of Mr. bin Laden, who remains the most wanted terrorism suspect in the United States and whose organization has been under scrutiny, most recently as to whether it was involved in the Oct. 12 bombing of the American destroyer Cole in Yemen, an attack that killed 17 sailors. Mr. bin Laden has been indicted in the terrorism conspiracy and has been long suspected by the authorities of masterminding the embassy bombings. He is believed to be living under the protection of the fundamentalist Taliban in Afghanistan.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mohamed, 48, a naturalized American citizen who was born in Egypt, had worked for Mr. bin Laden over the last decade, after serving as a supply sergeant assigned to a Special Forces unit at Fort Bragg, N.C., from 1986 to 1989. He has been described by the government as one of Mr. bin Laden's oldest and most trusted lieutenants.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, he seemed to confirm that. In 1991, Mr. Mohamed said, he  helped move Mr. bin Laden from Afghanistan to Sudan, where he was relocating his base of operations. Three years later, after Mr. bin Laden was nearly assassinated, Mr. Mohamed was summoned to Sudan to train his personal bodyguards, and to coordinate with Sudanese intelligence agents who were responsible for Mr. bin Laden's security outside his compound.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mohamed revealed yesterday that Mr. bin Laden's organization, called Al Qaeda, used tactics inspired by the suicide bombers who blew up the United States Marine barracks in Beirut in 1983, killing 241 soldiers and leading American troops to leave Lebanon. ''Based on the Marine explosion in Beirut,'' he said, ''and the American pull-out from Beirut, they will be the same method, to force the United States to pull out from Saudi Arabia.''</p>
        <p>The authorities did not say when the plea bargaining began that led to yesterday's announcement. The five charges to which Mr. Mohamed pleaded guilty all pertain to the  broader conspiracy, which included  the embassy attacks in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, which killed more than 200 people and injured thousands.</p>
        <p>Had Mr. Mohamed been convicted at trial, he would have faced a maximum term of life in prison. Now, because of the plea agreement, it seems probable that he will receive a shorter term.</p>
        <p>During the hearing, Judge Sand said that under terms of the plea agreement, Mr. Mohamed would receive no less than 25 years in prison. Then, after a brief conference with prosecutors and Mr. Mohamed's lawyers, the judge said the sentence was for a specified number of years, but he did not disclose the number in court.</p>
        <p>If Mr. Mohamed served 25 years, he would be eligible for release when he is 73.</p>
        <p>It was not clear yesterday whether Mr. Mohamed would testify against his five co-defendants, two of whom would face the death penalty if convicted, or in what other ways he might help in the government's investigation or its search for eight other fugitives, including Mr. bin Laden.</p>
        <p>During the government's lengthy investigation of Mr. bin Laden, prosecutors have said they won the cooperation of at least one other close aide, a convicted terrorist who has been identified in court papers only as CS-1, a confidential source who worked with Mr. bin Laden from 1989 to 1996.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Mohamed is the first suspect to publicly declare Mr. bin Laden's involvement in terrorism being planned and carried out at the highest levels of Al Qaeda.</p>
        <p>Standing in court yesterday in leg irons, his face looking drawn, Mr. Mohamed answered firmly and clearly to questions posed by Judge Sand, who questioned him at one point about the goal of the conspiracy. ''The objective of all this,'' Mr. Mohamed replied, was ''just to attack any Western target in the Middle East, to force the governments of the Western countries just to pull out from the Middle East, not to interfere.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mohamed said in court that in the early 1980's, he became involved with the Egyptian Islamic Jihad, a group that is dedicated to the overthrow of the Egyptian government and which prosecutors say eventually became absorbed into Mr. bin Laden's conspiracy.</p>
        <p>In the early 1990's, Mr. Mohamed said, he was introduced to Al Qaeda, and in 1992, Mr. Mohamed gave Al Qaeda members military and basic explosives training in Afghanistan. He said he also gave them intelligence training, and taught them how to create cells or units ''that could be used for operations.''</p>
        <p>Around the same time, he said, he worked closely with Mr. bin Laden's top aides, including Wadih el-Hage, another of the defendants facing trial in New York, and helped Mr. bin Laden create ''a presence in Nairobi, Kenya.''</p>
        <p>''A car business was set up to create income,'' Mr. Mohamed told Judge Sand. ''Wadih el-Hage created a charity organization that would help provide Al Qaeda members with identity documents. I personally helped el-Hage by making labels in his home in Nairobi.</p>
        <p>''We used various code names to conceal our identities,'' Mr. Mohamed said. ''I used the name 'Jeff.' ''</p>
        <p>In late 1993, Mr. Mohamed said, he conducted surveillance of the American embassy and other targets in Nairobi at Mr. bin Laden's request. He said the other targets included the buildings for the United States Agency for International Development, an American agricultural agency, the French Cultural Center and the French Embassy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mohamed said that in 1994, Mr. bin Laden sent him to Djibouti to do surveillance of the American Embassy, French military bases and other targets.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mohamed offered new detail on the web of relationships that he said existed between Mr. bin Laden's organization and other terrorist groups, like the Egyptian Islamic Jihad and the Iranian-backed Hezbollah.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mohamed said he arranged security for a meeting between the head of Hezbollah and Mr. bin Laden. He said that Hezbollah also provided explosives training for Mr. bin Laden's group and the Egyptian Islamic Jihad. The Egyptian group also obtained weapons from Iran, he said.</p>
        <p>In late 1994, Mr. Mohamed said, he was called by the F.B.I. and asked to fly back to the United States to talk about the coming trial of Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, the Egyptian cleric who was later convicted of conspiring to blow up the United Nations and other landmarks. ''I flew back to the United States, spoke to the F.B.I., but didn't disclose everything that I knew,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In 1998, after the embassy bombings, Mr. Mohamed said, he was planning to go to Egypt and then to Afghanistan to meet Mr. bin Laden. But it was then that he was subpoenaed before a grand jury in New York. ''I testified, told some lies, and was then arrested,'' he told the judge.</p>
        <p>During the hearing yesterday, Judge Sand asked Mr. Mohamed whether he had been induced or pressured into the plea. Mr. Mohamed said he had not been.</p>
        <p>''Do I understand that you are offering to plead guilty because you believe that you are guilty?'' the judge asked.</p>
        <p>''Yes, your honor,'' Mr. Mohamed replied.</p>
