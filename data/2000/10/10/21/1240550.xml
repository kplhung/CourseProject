        <p>Tired of talking about his team's slow start, the grim-faced Islanders Coach Butch Goring had these words for his players before last night's game against the Thrashers in Atlanta: There's been enough said. It's time to go out and play and get it done.</p>
        <p>The words may have had their intended effect. The Islanders' 5-3 victory at Philips Arena was their first of the season, after an 0-3-1 start. In a surprise, the Islanders scored their first power-play goal of the season after failing on 25 opportunities.</p>

        <p>Tired of talking about his team's slow start, the grim-faced Islanders Coach Butch Goring had these words for his players before last night's game against the Thrashers in Atlanta: There's been enough said. It's time to go out and play and get it done.</p>
        <p>The words may have had their intended effect. The Islanders' 5-3 victory at Philips Arena was their first of the season, after an 0-3-1 start. In a surprise, the Islanders scored their first power-play goal of the season after failing on 25 opportunities.</p>
        <p>''This is what we need -- the monkey off our back,'' Goring said. ''Confidence is so important in this league. It got a little bit ugly at times, but they got it done. They can feel good about themselves.''</p>
        <p>Looking for any kind of a spark, Goring started the 32-year-old backup Wade Flaherty in goal over John Vanbiesbrouck. And Flaherty, staked to an early 4-0 lead, stopped 24 shots in his season debut.</p>
        <p>With only eight goals in four games, the Islanders scored four goals in a withering seven-minute span in the first period. They opened the scoring 7 minutes 59 seconds into the game, when the rookie left wing Jeff Toms circled behind the net with the puck and fed right wing Brad Isbister as he closed down the middle. Isbister's 8-footer found the net's left corner.</p>
        <p>The Islanders then got two short-handed goals in a 1:09 stretch. Defenseman Zdeno Chara used his 6-foot-9-inch frame as he broke free along the left side and beat goaltender Damian Rhodes, controlling the puck until Rhodes became vulnerable to a glove-side shot from point-blank range.</p>
        <p>''I don't score many goals,'' said Chara, who had four in his first three years in the National Hockey League. ''But I saw I had a pretty good chance and I went for it.''</p>
        <p>Next, defenseman Roman Hamrlik got a pass from center Claude Lapointe in the open and shot from 30 feet. Rhodes deflected the shot with his glove hand, but the puck bounced off the crossbar and back toward a charging Hamrlik, who put the puck in the net for a 3-0 lead.</p>
        <p>The Islanders went up, 4-0, at 14:59 when Lapointe, on the left, fed a perfect pass to center Dave Scatchard, who jammed the puck in the net's right corner.</p>
        <p>The Thrashers yanked Rhodes for Milan Hnilicka and began to close the gap with two power-play goals in the first 5:19 of the second period. But Hamrlik short-circuited Atlanta's momentum at 14:28 when, with a two-man advantage, his 25-footer from the right point made it through the traffic around the net.</p>

        <p>MIGHTY DUCKS 2, SABRES 2: Chris Gratton scored with 7.2 seconds left in regulation as host Buffalo snapped a three-game losing streak.</p>
        <p>With an extra attacker on for Buffalo, Doug Gilmour centered a pass into the crease, hitting Gratton in the skates. Gratton then shoveled it into the open right side.</p>
        <p>STARS 5, BLACKHAWKS 1: Joe Nieuwendyk had two goals and Dallas scored three times in a three-minute span of the second period to beat host Chicago. Goalie Marty Turco got his first career victory, stopping 17 shots. (AP)</p>
        <p>AVALANCHE 5, PANTHERS 1: Peter Forsberg scored twice and assisted on another goal, and goalie Patrick Roy stopped 24 shots as Colorado extended its season-opening unbeaten streak to a franchise-record eight games with a 5-1 victory over the winless Florida Panthers.</p>
