        <p>Here's how fandom creeps up on you: You start out in the other room while your husband listens to the Mets, sticking your head in on big plays just to see why he's pounding the table like Khrushchev. The next year, you grudgingly go along on a couple of trips to Shea. Then you start yelling at the radio when Rey Ordonez, once again, swings at the first pitch. Soon, when your husband calls from a trip overseas, you find yourself discussing the well-being of the baby and the Mets, not in that order.</p>
        <p>Although I sometimes followed the Tigers as a child and the Cubs in college, I have not before now been a true fan. I liked the ballpark buzz from the radio on a summer evening because it was comfort noise -- the mashed potatoes of sound. My introduction to the Mets came from my husband, who grew up a few blocks from Shea and whose repertoire of lullabies for our baby consists mainly of the songs from the Schaefer and Rheingold beer ads that used to run during Mets broadcasts. Now my indoctrination is so complete that my husband can win points with me by agreeing to go watch a game.</p>

        <p>Although I sometimes followed the Tigers as a child and the Cubs in college, I have not before now been a true fan. I liked the ballpark buzz from the radio on a summer evening because it was comfort noise -- the mashed potatoes of sound. My introduction to the Mets came from my husband, who grew up a few blocks from Shea and whose repertoire of lullabies for our baby consists mainly of the songs from the Schaefer and Rheingold beer ads that used to run during Mets broadcasts. Now my indoctrination is so complete that my husband can win points with me by agreeing to go watch a game.</p>
        <p>I am still not a baseball fan. The game is only interesting to me when I care passionately about the outcome, and that means the Mets must be playing. Team loyalty is as mysterious as love. Yeah, they're going to the World Series, but the thrill of victory is an awfully fleeting reason to follow a baseball team, except, perhaps, if you root for the Yankees.</p>
        <p>I've always sympathized with the underdogs, but that's not the Mets these days, not with that payroll. Yes, they are a team of grown-ups, with mature players like Edgardo Alfonso and Lenny Harris and Robin Ventura. Who cares? I'm glad that Al Leiter has a children's charity, but if you choose your heroes for their personal conduct, sports is not the place to go.</p>
        <p>The real reason I am a Mets fan this year is that I was one last year, just as the mutt you brought home from the pound becomes infinitely more endearing than all other dogs. I don't love the Mets because they're Amazin'. They're Amazin' because I love them -- in baseball as in all other things.</p>
