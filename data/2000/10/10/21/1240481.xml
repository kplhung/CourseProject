        <p>Nothing like a train ride for catching up on unread magazines. But this week, an old question about religious thinkers and American culture cropped up again -- halfway, as a matter of fact, between Washington and New York and halfway through a charming article on predestination.</p>
        <p>That's right, a charming article on predestination -- the daunting doctrine, associated with St. Augustine and John Calvin, that an omnipotent God has known and decreed who will be saved and who will be damned.</p>

        <p>Nothing like a train ride for catching up on unread magazines. But this week, an old question about religious thinkers and American culture cropped up again -- halfway, as a matter of fact, between Washington and New York and halfway through a charming article on predestination.</p>
        <p>That's right, a charming article on predestination -- the daunting doctrine, associated with St. Augustine and John Calvin, that an omnipotent God has known and decreed who will be saved and who will be damned.</p>
        <p>The cover of the evangelical monthly Christianity Today announced the article with the headline, ''The Joy of Predestination.'' Inside, a subhead explained, ''How predestination descended like a dove on two unsuspecting seminarians, and why they are so grateful.''</p>
        <p>Writing in alternating autobiographical passages, degree candidates at Princeton Theological Seminary -- Jennifer L. Bayne, a Presbyterian, and Sarah E. Hinlicky, a Lutheran -- made as charming a case for an historically controversial belief as could be imagined.</p>
        <p>They were charming in the way spritely dinner party partners are charming. Also charming in the way a snake charmer is charming -- with the mysterious power to make something very threatening suddenly seem very tame.</p>
        <p>But the old question about religious thinkers and American culture didn't have to do with predestination. It had more to do with the intelligence and lightly borne learning -- charm, if you will -- exhibited in this article.</p>
        <p>It had more to do with the similar abilities displayed in the pile of other religious magazines -- all Christian, but mainline Protestant and Roman Catholic as well as evangelical -- that were occupying this journey.</p>
        <p>It had to do with the impressive scholars encountered over the last two weekends at conferences, one at Harvard and one at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles, on the future of religiously affiliated colleges and universities. (Those conferences also accounted for the backlog of magazine reading.)</p>
        <p>The old question was, Why are there so few crossovers? Why are so few of these lively minds encountered in the nation's general organs of intellectual and cultural life?</p>
        <p>Of course, there are exceptions. One can think of a dozen or so individuals like Martin Marty or Peter Berger or Jean Bethke Elshtain, Christian thinkers and scholars whose reviews and essays are as likely to appear in general readership journals as in publications that largely cater to particular religious communities.</p>
        <p>Still, only a fraction of even the most outstanding writers and thinkers appearing in religiously based journals like the Jesuit weekly America, the evangelical bimonthly Books &amp; Culture, the mainline weekly Christian Century, the lay Catholic biweekly Commonweal, the neoconservative monthly First Things, or other religious journals of similar reach and quality are ever likely to appear in, say, The Atlantic, Harper's, The New Yorker or the New York Review of Books.</p>
        <p>By comparison, the exchange of editors and the overlap of writers between such general cultural forums and a handful of political and literary magazines (The Nation, The New Republic, The Washington Monthly, The New Leader, The Weekly Standard, the American Spectator) is considerable, though the latter are often as limited in circulation and ideology as their religious counterparts.</p>
        <p>The exception that proves the rule can be found in the list of the 50 ''high-impact media players'' featured in the November issue of the media-scanning magazine Brill's Content.</p>
        <p>The only mention of religion came in the listing of Garry Wills, who produced, within a single year, a biography of St. Augustine and a critique of the current papacy as well as a book on Americans' antigovernment sentiment.</p>
        <p>Religion, in effect, gained the same amount of notice in the list as Spanish-language radio, hip-hop news and interior design reporting.</p>
        <p>Actually, the springboard for the prolific and multitalented Mr. Wills has never been the religious media or even the world of religious thought. The attention given his views on the papacy and Augustine stems from his record as a prize-winning political commentator, historian and reviewer in secular journals, where his religious convictions, when they appear, are never pronounced or disconcerting.</p>
        <p>Explanations for the lack of crossovers are easy to find. Antireligious or anti-Christian bias is the altogether too easy explanation popular in some conservative circles, though it cannot be dismissed out of hand.</p>
        <p>These disparities, like those affecting women or racial minorities in professional sectors, are as likely to be the result of old-boy networks, unfamiliarity or unexamined assumptions as outright prejudice. But these disparities, like sexual or racial ones, are also as likely to be explained away with the belief that the talent just is not there.</p>
        <p>Of course, religious groups and thinkers have often contributed to this gap themselves. Some have theological reasons for looking inward rather than addressing society at large; others just do so out of habit or longstanding cultural isolation.</p>
        <p>One of those groups, evangelical Christians, have been undergoing an impressive revival of intellectual life, described by Alan Wolfe in the October issue of Atlantic Monthly.  The title of Mr. Wolfe's article, ''The Opening of the Evangelical Mind,'' echoes the title of a 1994 book, ''The Scandal of the Evangelical Mind,'' by the evangelical historian Mark Noll and perhaps also Allan Bloom's 1987 polemic, ''The Closing of the American Mind.''</p>
        <p>A widely published sociologist who now heads the Boisi Center for Religion and American Public Life at Boston College, Professor Wolfe applauds this development as positive for evangelicals and positive for the nation's intellectual life. He wants evangelicals to go even further in shaking off the defensiveness and anti-intellectualism that plagued  their movement for much of the last century and pleads that ''the least they can be offered is respect in return.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps that observation hints at a further reality. The parochialism is not all on one side. It is not only evangelical or Christian or religious minds that can use a little opening. The mind of the cosmopolitan culture could also open itself to new blood and fresh views. Unless, of course, the relative scarcity of religious crossovers is simply predestined.</p>
