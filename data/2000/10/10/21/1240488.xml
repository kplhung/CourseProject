        <p>Following are the closing statements from the fifth and final debate between Jon S. Corzine and Representative Bob Franks, the candidates for United States Senate, as recorded by The New York Times. The hourlong debate, which was taped yesterday at the College of New Jersey in Ewing, will be broadcast on Sunday on WPVI-TV in Philadelphia at 10 a.m., and on WABC-TV in New York at 10:30 a.m.</p>
        <p>MR. CORZINE -- Today, we conclude a series of five debates. The voters of New Jersey have a real choice on real issues. I believe this is a crossroads election. Will we invest prudently, and pay down our national debt? Will we preserve Social Security and avoid needless privatization? Will we provide for prescription drug benefits, free Medicare? Will we offer to all Americans health care? And will we invest real dollars in our public education and say no to vouchers? And finally, will we fight for a more perfect union, making sure that we outlaw racial profiling and that we protect a woman's right to choose? Make no mistake: on each of these questions, I firmly say the answer is yes. We must and we can. I've lived the American promise. I hope to go to Washington to fight for the people of New Jersey so everyone has access to the same dreams I've had.</p>
        <p>MR. FRANKS -- In two weeks you'll be making a very important decision, between two men with very different values and experiences. I've spent the last eight years in Congress working to earn your support. Mr. Corzine this fall is trying to buy it. My record proves that I have represented the mainstream values of the state of New Jersey during my public career. I've worked to write the first balanced budget in a generation, stop the raid on the Social Security trust fund, end welfare as a way of life, and save Medicare from bankruptcy. Now my priorities are to get every married couple relief from the marriage penalty tax, give parents greater control over their children's education, make health care more affordable for the middle class. I believe that people will make a difference in this election. Mr. Corzine's calling for massive new expansions in the federal government -- expansions that would become unsustainable over time. They would wreck the balanced budget and threaten Social Security. My name is Bob Franks, and I'm the candidate with the experience, and the values, that money can't buy.</p>
