        <p>''The Legend of Tamar'' came out of the Caucasus Mountains to the stage of the City Center on Thursday night. The legend was wispy, but the dancers and musicians who brought it to life were sturdy.</p>
        <p>The work was a production by the Georgian National Singing and Dancing Ensemble, also known as Erisioni, which is under the artistic direction of Djemal Chkuasseli.</p>
        <p>The ambitious effort sought to solve a problem faced by many folkloric ensembles: that of providing a suite of miscellaneous songs and dances with some sort of unity. Pascal Jourdan, the production's director, tried to base the work on a legend about Tariel, a knight, and the way Tamar, a mystical queen, guides him on a quest for true love.</p>
        <p>Kathleen McInnis provided a text in English, recited by Natacha LaFerriere, Jeff Cummings, Trevor Smith and David Drummond. Eka Nonikashvili played Tamar, and the role of the knight was divided between Levan Kublashvili, who symbolized his martial self, and Otar Chumburidze, who represented his innocent idealism. But the story was vague, and events onstage seldom had much to do with incidents described in the text.</p>
        <p>What was left after all this ineffectual dramatic fussing were songs and instrumental pieces, conducted by Sheradin Tchkuaseli, and dances choreographed by Revaz Chokhonelidze. Fortunately, the music and dancing were excellent.</p>
        <p>Despite excessive amplification, choruses were notable for their complex polyphony and for the way repeated deep bass tones served as a foundation for melodies that soared above this droning. At other times, radiant chords burst forth that sounded like sunbursts of sound.</p>
        <p>The female dancers glided with ethereal lightness, sometimes appearing never to touch the ground. The men were also light on their feet. They were especially so in sequences in which they rose up on the toes of their boots to perform what ballet dancers would call steps on point. Their footwork was nimble and some phrases ended spectacularly when men jumped into the air, then landed on their knees. There were also scenes in which knights dueled as they danced, their swords striking sparks as they clashed.</p>
        <p>All this was exciting -- so exciting, in fact, that one almost forgot the story. And when references to it were made once again, it more than ever seemed irrelevant.</p>
        <p>Historically-minded dance lovers should note that this ''Legend of Tamar'' has nothing to do with ''Thamar,'' a work set in the Caucasus that Michel Fokine choreographed for the Diaghilev Ballets Russes in 1912 and which was danced for several decades. In that popular and once-scandalous creation, the leading character is a glamorous but villainous queen who murders all her suitors. At City Center, where ''The Legend of Tamar'' continues through tomorrow night, everything is sweetness and light.</p>
        <p>DANCE REVIEW  Correction:  October 24, 2000, Tuesday  A headline on Saturday for a dance review of ''The Legend of Tamar,'' performed at the City Center by the Georgian National Singing and Dancing Ensemble, misstated the troupe's nationality. As the review noted, it is Georgian, not Ukrainian.</p>
