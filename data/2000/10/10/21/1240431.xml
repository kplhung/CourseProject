        <p>At times scholarly work seems so specialized that nonacademics wonder about its relevance. Here are a few unusual academic niches with explanations from professors of how they became interested in their subjects and why they are important.</p>
        <p>Impact of the Bicycle -- Ross Petty, a professor of marketing law and bicycle culture at Babson College in Wellesley, Mass., studies the bicycle as a way of understanding the social impact of technology.</p>
        <p>How he became interested: Mr. Petty, who has been a bicycle commuter for about 25 years, was reading a history of the bicycle and noticed that many interesting journal articles were referred to in the footnotes. He decided to pull the articles together into a course.</p>
        <p>Academic significance: Mr. Petty says that studying the bicycle sheds light on how technology can subtly influence social change, for example, women's emancipation (long skirts were altered so that women could ride a bicycle). Mr. Petty said that two-wheelers also played a role in advancing ''the concept of mass production that was built upon by Henry Ford, a former bicycle mechanic.'' He went on: ''And let's not forget Wilbur and Orville Wright, the two most famous bicycle mechanics of all, who built their airplane using lightweight bicycle components and used their knowledge of the importance of balance -- whether on a roadway or on shifting air currents.''</p>
        <p>Ancient Roman Toilets -- Ann Olga Koloski-Ostrow, associate professor of classical studies at Brandeis University in Waltham, Mass., studies water, latrines and sewers of Roman times.</p>
        <p>How she became interested: While doing research in the library of the American Academy in Rome in the summer of 1992, Ms. Koloski-Ostrow recalls, an English scholar who was browsing in the stacks called her over and whispered: ''Latrines, Roman latrines. No one has done them properly.''</p>
        <p>Academic significance: The sewer system not only provides an insight into Roman engineering abilities, Ms. Koloski-Ostrow said, but also helps explain Roman attitudes about diet, medicine, health, social customs and religion during the first century A.D.</p>
        <p>Pinocchio -- Richard Wunderlich, a professor of sociology at the College of Saint Rose in Albany, studies the story of Pinocchio.</p>
        <p>How he became interested: In the 1970's, Mr. Wunderlich noticed the difference between C. Collodi's original 1883 story and its modern adaptations. In the original Italian version, Pinocchio becomes an adult capable of taking care of himself and others, while in later adaptations, the Walt Disney version, for example, the puppet becomes a child.</p>
        <p>Academic significance: ''The study of Pinocchio allows us to see the story as an index of cultural change,'' Mr. Wunderlich said. From the turn of the century until the 1930's, childhood was viewed as a temporary stage leading to adulthood, he said, but during the Depression, childhood was celebrated as a way of protecting children from cruel economic realities. That is the reason, he said, that adaptations in which the puppet becomes a child, not an adult, became popular. ''Pinocchio is changed to fit the requirements of a new society,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Yard Art -- Pamela Frese, an associate professor of anthropology at Wooster College in Wooster, Ohio, studies yard art and what it says about people's beliefs.</p>
        <p>How she became interested:  While working on her dissertation on wedding rituals in the United States, she began to see a connection between the symbols that people place in front of their homes, like flowers, swan planters and birdbaths, and how they give meaning to the wedding ritual.</p>
        <p>Academic significance: Yard ornament is a form of communication, Ms. Frese, said: ''Homeowners use these ornaments, at times unconsciously, to express their view about themselves, their beliefs and their homes, including their views on women's roles as nurturers, the home as a sanctuary and sacred nature.''</p>
        <p>Lost and Found Department in Tokyo Railroad Stations -- Paul Noguchi, a professor of urban anthropology at Bucknell University in Lewisburg, Pa., is interested in rail culture in Japan, especially the lost and found depot at the main Tokyo railroad station.</p>
        <p>How he became interested: While living in Japan in the 1970's and writing his dissertation, Mr. Noguchi overheard a Japanese woman with a child telling a station attendant that she had left her purse on the train, which had just pulled out. Workers retrieved her purse, but about 15 minutes later, the woman called back to say that she had lost her child on the way home. ''This convinced me of the many possible dramas involving lost articles,'' Mr. Noguchi said.</p>
        <p>Academic significance: Unlike objects in a museum, objects in a lost and found department are not explained or illuminated by a curator. They form a ''people's collection,'' Mr. Noguchi said, and ''through  these objects people are making an unrehearsed statement about themselves. The fact that they are caught in an unguarded moment gives us insight into their culture in a nonverbal, spontaneous, unintended way.''</p>
        <p>Animals and Their Sounds -- Tom Benediktson, a professor of classics and comparative literature at the University of Tulsa, studies lists of animals and their sounds that are found in medieval Latin manuscripts.</p>
        <p>How he became interested: While reading material for an annotated bibliography on Suetonius, the Roman historian who wrote ''Lives of the 12 Caesars,'' Mr. Benediktson noticed the catalogs of animals, which were sometimes turned into poems.</p>
        <p>Academic significance: Mr. Benediktson said that medieval scribes had traditionally been thought of as mere copiers, but ''these scribes are more creative and systematic than I had thought.'' By categorizing species in scientific ways, doing linguistic research and creating poems from the lists, he said, they were ''trying to preserve and extend knowledge'' in ways characteristic of modern scholars.</p>
