        <p>With one signature, Carlos Delgado settled two issues yesterday: he agreed to a new four-year, $68 million contract with the Toronto Blue Jays, ensuring his continued employment as the team's first baseman and eradicating a question about who had been baseball's highest-paid player.</p>
        <p>Under the three-year, $36 million contract he signed a year ago, Delgado could have demanded a trade within 15 days after the World Series. But Toronto's new owners wanted to make sure he did not exercise the option. Delgado batted .344 this season with 41 home runs and 137 runs batted in.</p>

        <p>With one signature, Carlos Delgado settled two issues yesterday: he agreed to a new four-year, $68 million contract with the Toronto Blue Jays, ensuring his continued employment as the team's first baseman and eradicating a question about who had been baseball's highest-paid player.</p>
        <p>Under the three-year, $36 million contract he signed a year ago, Delgado could have demanded a trade within 15 days after the World Series. But Toronto's new owners wanted to make sure he did not exercise the option. Delgado batted .344 this season with 41 home runs and 137 runs batted in.</p>
        <p>His annual average of $17 million a year places the 28-year-old Blue Jays leader at the top of the salary standing. That position had been held by pitchers Kevin Brown of Los Angeles at $15 million a year or Roger Clemens of the Yankees at $15.45 million a year.</p>
        <p>The Clemens contract, which takes effect next season, will pay him $30.9 mi</p>
        <p>llion for what the Yankees say is three years. Under the collective bargaining agreement's salary definitions for the luxury tax on payrolls (which is not in effect this year), the annual average of Clemens's contract is $10.3 million.</p>
        <p>However, the third year of the contract is at the pitcher's option while all of the money is guaranteed, meaning he can get all of his money after playing only two years. For other salary computations used by management and the players association, that makes the annual average $15.45 million.</p>
        <p>Delgado probably will remain the highest-paid player until shortstop Alex Rodriguez signs a new contract, either with the Seattle Mariners or with another team as a free agent. The $20 million a year that has been talked about for Rodriguez seems more likely with the Delgado signing.</p>

        <p>HELTON AND DELGADO WIN AARON AWARD: Carlos Delgado of the Blue Jays and Todd Helton of the Colorado Rockies have won the Hank Aaron award for 2000.</p>
        <p>The award, established last year, recognizes the season's best overall hitter in each league. The winners were determined in voting by play-by-play broadcasters and color analysts for each club's radio and TV rights-holders. Points were on a 5-3-1 basis.</p>
        <p>Delgado took the honor in the American League with 181 points.  Chicago's Frank Thomas was the runner-up with 111 points, and Oakland's Jason Giambi finished third with 44 points.</p>
        <p>In the National League, Helton had 207 points, followed by Montreal's Vladimir Guerrero (104) and the Chicago Cubs' Sammy Sosa (39).</p>
        <p>Helton led the league in batting average (.372), doubles (59), multiple-hit games (63), hits (216), on-base percentage (.463), runs batted in (147), total bases (405) and slugging percentage (.698). He also hit 42 home runs. (AP)</p>
