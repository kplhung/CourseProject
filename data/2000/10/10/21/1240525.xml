        <p>Timo Perez made a major impact on the National League playoff series between the Mets and the St. Louis Cardinals. Among the people who watched him the closest and with the most interest were opposing scouts who followed the Mets before and during the playoffs.</p>
        <p>''We were at a loss why Perez  wasn't in there earlier,'' said one scout who watched the Mets the last few weeks of the season and into the postseason. ''He was the catalyst. He's the one thing they didn't have, and that was speed. He's an amazing talent. He doesn't have a good handle on the strike zone, but he doesn't need it.</p>
        <p>''He's like Yogi was. If the pitch is within reach, it's a strike. He's going to swing at it. He hit balls trying to duck away from them. He has uncanny ability.''</p>
        <p>The scouts's view of Perez is critical because his performance is the kind managers want to know about as they prepare for a World Series. They know about Mike Piazza and David Justice. What they primarily want to know is which players are hot or cold and which are so new the managers need any information the scouts can give them.</p>
        <p>Perez, the discovery of Omar Minaya, the Mets' senior assistant general manager, joined the Mets on Aug. 30 and batted only 54 times in the final month of the season. The San Francisco Giants and the St. Louis Cardinals, whom the Mets defeated in the first two playoff series, did not have much of a chance to see the rookie outfielder in action. But Yankee scouts saw him during those two series.</p>
        <p>The way the Yankees handle Perez will be critical because he has given the Mets a dimension they lacked for most of the season: a legitimate leadoff hitter. But he is not the only player the Yankees have to watch.</p>
        <p>''They have a lot of professional hitters,'' a scout for a National League team said. ''You can get them out one time, but you might not do it the next time.''</p>
        <p>The most dangerous of those hitters, he said, is Edgardo Alfonzo, who has become one of the best postseason clutch hitters of recent years.</p>
        <p>''The guy we had to list who could beat us, at-bat after at-bat, was Alfonzo,'' the scout said. ''He makes adjustments from one at-bat to the next. A lot of guys don't.''</p>
        <p>One problem scouts had in scrutinizing both the Mets and the Yankees was that both teams struggled through much of September.</p>
        <p>One scout said he saw Piazza go 11 consecutive games without getting a hit off a fastball. ''He was just in a funk,'' the scout said. ''One time he had taken 17 straight first-pitch strikes. He was tentative.''</p>
        <p>Another scout said: ''Piazza can always be pitched to, except when you miss by six inches. Then you're in trouble.''</p>
        <p>Scouts who followed the Yankees mentioned David Justice, Bernie Williams and Derek Jeter as the hitters the Mets would have to be most careful with. Justice (.227) and Jeter (.268) have not hit well for average during this postseason, but they have driven in important runs. Justice leads the team with nine runs batted in and three home runs; Jeter has driven in seven runs.</p>
        <p>''They're not getting the breaking ball over on Justice,'' said a scout,  who then explained the pair of breakdowns Arthur Rhodes of Seattle suffered while pitching to Justice.</p>
        <p>''Rhodes didn't get his breaking ball over and had to throw him fat fastballs. He's in one of those streaks. His hot zone is out over the plate with fastballs and he's hitting them hard. You've got to get good hard breaking stuff down and away or anywhere. But if you give him fastballs, he's going to get his hacks and he hasn't been missing them.''</p>
        <p>Although Paul O'Neill stroked two singles and knocked in three runs in the Yankees' most recent game, he has not been viewed as a potential problem for the Mets.</p>
        <p>''He's the guy who struggled the whole time when I saw them,'' a scout said. ''The only balls he hit hard in 10 games I saw was a fastball in his little zone, the middle of the plate, down a little. They got him out mostly with fastballs, mostly away.''</p>
        <p>In appraising the pitching for both teams, one scout said he liked the way the Mets' left-handers, Al Leiter and Mike Hampton, match up against the Yankees' left-handed hitters, even though those hitters have hit for higher averages against left-handers than right-handers this season. But the scout said that while he liked the Mets' left-handed duo, ''I like the Yankees' pitching depth.''</p>
        <p>Another scout referred to Hampton as a bulldog and Leiter as a pit bull. ''They have the same mental attitude,'' he said.</p>
        <p>One of the keys for the Mets, it then seems, will be how the right-handers, Bobby J. Jones and Rick Reed, pitch against the Yankees.</p>
        <p>''Reed and Jones are going to be as good as their command that day,'' a scout said. ''If they're locating their pitches, you've got your hands full. Both are old enough so they don't try to do too much with the ball. If it works, it works. They stay within themselves outstandingly well.''</p>
        <p>The scouts had nothing bad to say about the Yankees' three starters, Andy Pettitte, Roger Clemens and Orlando Hernandez. But one rhapsodized about El Duque. ''He just keeps coming,'' the scout said. ''He doesn't give in. The first time I saw him, he looked like just another guy. Then I started watching him. He changed his arm angle, knew when to put something on, when to take something off, gave it a little more sink, a little more side break. It's uncanny that he can do that. It's always the pitch you don't expect.''</p>
        <p>Discussing the closers, the scouts gave the edge to Mariano Rivera of the Yankees over Armando Benitez of the Mets.</p>
        <p>When Benitez throws his hard slider, one scout noted: ''Sometimes it flattens out. When he doesn't try to do too much, the slider is awesome.''</p>
        <p>Another scout cautioned that batters should swing early in the count against Benitez. ''The longer he's out there,'' the scout said, ''his velocity builds.''</p>
        <p>The scouts agreed that Rivera's cut fastball makes him nearly unhittable. ''Hitters don't have time to adjust to it,'' one scout said.</p>
        <p>None of the scouts thought that either team had a big advantage over the other. The Yankees had some edge because of their recent postseason experience, some said.</p>
        <p>''It should be one of the great series in recent times,'' one scout said.</p>
