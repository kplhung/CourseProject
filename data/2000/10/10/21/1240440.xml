        <p>A dispute between the media mogul Vladimir V. Gusinsky and his biggest creditor has moved closer to a resolution, which could ultimately prevent his company from being controlled by the Russian government.</p>
        <p>But this week negotiators were still trying to resolve a disagreement over money.</p>
        <p>An executive with the creditor, Gazprom -- whose largest shareholder is the government -- confirmed today that talks had resumed with Mr. Gusinsky's company, Media-Most. Last month, after Mr. Gusinsky backed out of an agreement to sell his business to Gazprom, Gazprom took him to court to collect unpaid loans.</p>
        <p>''We are holding talks on reaching an amicable settlement,'' said Alfred Kokh, director of Gazprom-Media. ''Some principal issues remain unresolved. Money issues.''</p>
        <p>The conflict, which has gone on for months, ultimately pits the Kremlin against Mr. Gusinsky, who fell from official favor after supporting President Vladimir V. Putin's opponents in parliamentary elections last year.</p>
        <p>Because of its shareholding, the government wields tremendous influence over Gazprom. It has also been viewed as playing a role in the intensifying feud between Gazprom and Media-Most. Federal authorities raided Mr. Gusinsky's offices earlier this year and he was briefly imprisoned, two developments that raised concerns that his company, Russia's main independent media conglomerate, would be bullied out of business.</p>
        <p>This week the Russian daily Nez avisimaya Gazeta published the initial terms of the settlement, which Mr. Kokh said were accurate.</p>
        <p>If approved, the agreement would give Gazprom a 25 percent stake in all Media-Most companies, and increase its stake in Mr. Gusinsky's flagship television station, NTV, to 46 percent.</p>
        <p>A loan due next summer will give Gazprom additional stakes that the agreement would require it to sell, to prevent its gaining control over NTV or Media-Most. In all, Gazprom extended $515 million in loans and loan guarantees to Media-Most.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kokh said he expected the two sides to reach an agreement by Nov. 8, the date of the next court hearing, but added that Gazprom remained wary.</p>
        <p>''Media-Most wants to agree, and that's a cause for optimism,'' he said. ''But we have a more cautious view of the situation. As of today we haven't signed anything.''</p>
        <p>A Media-Most spokeswoman refused to comment on the details of negotiations. But NTV's general director, Yevgeny Kiselyov, said this week that the agreement would leave Mr. Gusinsky's media company truly independent.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gusinsky, one of the country's richest men and the Kremlin's most outspoken critic, made his fortune in the economic free-for-all after the collapse of the Soviet Union. His critics accuse him of abusing his connections to win low-cost government loans. He has been abroad since July, after federal authorities dropped charges against him.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kokh said Gazprom was prepared to continue its battle in court if need be. It has not withdrawn any of its lawsuits against Media-Most and is insisting on tough legal terms after its bitter experience with the previous agreement, he explained.</p>
        <p>In late summer, Gazprom hired Deutsche Bank to help find a foreign buyer for stakes in Media-Most. (It says it does not want to own the company, just get its loans repaid.) Media-Most itself has been scrambling for months to find a foreign buyer to release it from the Gazprom debt.</p>
