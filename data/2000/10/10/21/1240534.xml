        <p>Of all the distant places stamped in his memory and in his passport, Venezuela was the loneliest for Stephen Jackson. He was 18, and basketball was his translator and his currency.</p>
        <p>For four months, he sent 75 percent of his $30,000 salary home to his mother in Port Arthur, Tex. The following year, he supported his family by playing in the Dominican Republic, another outpost of the international leagues.</p>
        <p>Jackson, who did not qualify academically for a scholarship to the University of Arizona and left junior college in Kansas after just four days, never followed a traditional path to the basket.</p>
        <p>Instead, he exiled himself as far away as possible from the drugs and the violence of his Texas neighborhood while he chased his dream. Now, Jackson is on the verge of finding it in New Jersey.</p>
        <p>At 22, Jackson, a lean and explosive 6-foot-8-inch rookie, has made a strong bid for earning a spot on the injury-depleted Nets roster. He leads the team in scoring, averaging 15.8 points in four preseason games. He has been the high scorer in the last two, with 20 points against the Magic and 23 against the Hornets, dazzling with reverse layups, flying tip-ins and undaunted perimeter shooting.</p>
        <p>The shiny wrapping, however, thinly veils the holes in Jackson's game.</p>
        <p>''Stephen's played well the last couple of games,'' Coach Byron Scott said, but he admitted that Jackson's  erratic defense offsets his offense. ''His defense is not where it should be. He needs to show me a lot of improvement in that area.''</p>
        <p>With the Nets slowed by injuries -- forward Keith Van Horn (broken left leg) and shooting guards Lucious Harris (hernia) and Kendall Gill (scratched left cornea) are sidelined -- Jackson has made the most of his opportunity.</p>
        <p>Stephon Marbury has recognized Jackson's innate abilities. ''He just knows how to play basketball,'' Marbury said. ''He's going to get better, he just has to do the little things, like stopping the ball and picking up his man downcourt.''</p>
        <p>Jackson has immersed himself in the film room to correct that. ''That's my main focus right now, just learning the N.B.A. defenses,'' he said. ''It doesn't matter how many points I score.''</p>
        <p>At the Rocky Mountain Revue last July, Jackson impressed scouts, including the Nets' Ed Stefanski. Despite invitations to four training camps, Jackson signed with the Nets in part because he knew the assistant coach Lawrence Frank.</p>
        <p>Last September, Vancouver guard Mike Bibby, a close friend of Jackson's, secured him a tryout with the Grizzlies, where Frank was coaching. He and Frank worked tirelessly, though Jackson was cut. ''He had good skills, good instincts, and he's got a really good feel for the game,'' Frank said.</p>
        <p>Jackson left high school in Texas after his junior year and enrolled in Oak Hill Academy in Virginia. Despite taking the SAT eight times, Jackson missed qualifying and lost his scholarship offer from Arizona.</p>
        <p>He attended Butler County Junior College in Kansas for less than a week. ''I had to go and redshirt and I was anxious to play,'' Jackson said. ''At the time I was making a lot of mistakes in my life.''</p>
        <p>His family was struggling emotionally and financially in Texas because a year before, Jackson's older brother was shot and killed in a fight. ''We were still dealing with that,'' he said. ''Being away at junior college wasn't helping.''</p>
        <p>After going back home, Jackson knew he needed to work, and he left for Venezuela. In 1997, he moved to Phoenix to live with Bibby's mother, Virginia, who virtually adopted him. He worked out daily with some of the Phoenix Suns.</p>
        <p>That June, Phoenix drafted him No. 46 but cut him at the end of training camp. Over the next three years, he played in Fort Wayne, Ind., and LaCrosse, Wis., for the Continental Basketball Association, stints that lasted fewer than six games.</p>
        <p>''I was moving too fast from city to city, doing everything which I wasn't ready for at 18, 19 years old,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Detailing his itinerant past, Jackson caught himself getting excited about staying with the Nets. ''I'm happy,'' he said. ''But I can always do better.''</p>
