        <p>Drug Makers Defend Product Safety  Facing potential restrictions on a major ingredient in some of their best-known brands, pharmaceutical companies defended the safety of their products and accused the Food and Drug Administration of placing an unwarranted amount of faith in what they called a questionable study. [A13.]</p>
        <p>Airlines Warned on Fare Disclosure  The Transportation Department warned airlines that they faced sanctions if they did not tell consumers who made reservations over the telephone that cheaper fares might be available on the Internet, but it stopped short of requiring them to say exactly what those fares would be.

        <p>Time to Buy Tribune Magazine Group  The Tribune Company, publisher of The Chicago Tribune and The Los Angeles Times, reported lower third-quarter earnings and said it would sell a magazine group that includes Golf and Field &amp; Stream to Time Inc. for $475 million. Tribune said it earned $73.6 million, or 22 cents a share, in the third quarter. That was down from $113.9 million, or 32 cents a share, a year earlier, but still topped analysts' lowered expectations of 21 cents a share thanks to strong results from the company's broadcasting and interactive media businesses.

        <p>Another Japanese Insurer Fails  Kyoei Life Insurance sought court protection from creditors in Japan's biggest bankruptcy since World War II, nearly two-thirds larger than the previous record corporate failure, by another insurer, just 11 days ago. Kyoei's bankruptcy came after talks with Prudential Insurance about a possible joint venture ended without an agreement. [C2.]</p>
        <p>Strong Drug Sales Lifts Merck  Merck said third-quarter profit rose 19 percent on sales of its drugs, including a painkiller, Vioxx; a cholesterol drug, Zocor; and a blood-pressure pill, Cozaar. Net income at Merck increased to $1.84 billion, or 78 cents a share, from $1.54 billion, or 64 cents, a year earlier. Sales rose 29 percent, to $10.6 billion. Shares of Merck gained $4.44, to $82. [C14.]</p>
        <p>Kansas Sues the Tax People  The Kansas attorney general filed a civil lawsuit seeking to stop Renaissance/The Tax People in Topeka from marketing a system to reduce income taxes. Last week the company was raided by federal and state officials and shut down. It reopened this week, prompting the lawsuit. [C2.]</p>
        <p>Coke Posts 36% Rise in Earnings  Coca-Cola, bolstered by stronger overseas sales, reported a better-than-expected 36 percent increase in third-quarter earnings but warned that a weak euro could put pressure on its earnings next year. Investors reacted by sending its shares down $2.19, to $54.94. [C4.]</p>
        <p>Softbank Forms Alliance With Ariba  Softbank, Japan's leading investment company, formed an alliance with Ariba, an electronic-commerce company in Palo Alto, Calif., to create online business-to-business marketplaces in Japan. Under the terms announced by Softbank's president, Masayoshi Son, the company will take a 40 percent stake in Ariba's Japanese subsidiary for 4.3 billion yen, or about $40 million. [C2.]</p>
