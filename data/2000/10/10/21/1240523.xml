        <p>For all their dominance during the playoffs in getting here, only four Mets have World Series experience.</p>
        <p>That should not matter, several Mets said yesterday, because even though the Yankees have won three of the last four World Series, they will be rookies tonight.</p>
        <p>''Of all the experience the Yankees have, I don't know if any of those guys are prepared for what's going to happen here because playoff experience and World Series experience doesn't prepare you for the Subway Series,'' Darryl Hamilton said before the Mets' workout at Yankee Stadium yesterday.</p>
        <p>''This is something that's totally new. It's going to be crazy. One out is important in a playoff game. Tomorrow night, one pitch and people are going to be screaming. I don't think all the experience in the world is going to prepare you for what's going to happen in the next 10 days.''</p>
        <p>The Mets hope that will be the great equalizer. For all their playoff experience the last two seasons and all the veterans on their roster, their World Series experience is minuscule compared with the Yankees.</p>
        <p>Yankee players have participated in a combined 195 World Series games, compared with only 14 for those from the Mets. Only two Mets pitchers, Al Leiter and Dennis Cook, and two infielders, Mike Bordick and Kurt Abbott, who were reserves on their teams, have played in the World Series. Leiter was not exaggerating Thursday when he said he was the only Met with a World Series hit.</p>
        <p>The Mets may have arguably the more talented team. They needed only nine games to get to the Series, while the Yankees were forced to fly to Oakland for a deciding fifth game of the division series before beating the Seattle Mariners in six games in the American League Championship Series.</p>
        <p>For the first time since they lost to the Cleveland Indians in the 1997 division series, the Yankees look mortal this postseason. They swept the Padres and the Braves in the last two World Series but now face the added pressure of playing the team from Queens.</p>
        <p>Still, those past experiences have bred confidence, although there is a difference between the playoffs and the World Series.</p>
        <p>''I think there is,'' said Yankees pitcher David Cone, a former Met. ''There's more attention, more media, more national attention. More than any time before, players realize they could be remembered for one play, for one mistake, one gaffe. It'll stay with you the rest of your life. It's more that way in the World Series than anywhere else.''</p>
        <p>Mets catcher Mike Piazza said: ''We don't have World Series experience in here but we have playoff experience. Who knows? As far as I'm concerned, I don't think it's going to be a negative that we don't have Series experience or very little. It's a game. You have to keep it that. You have to keep things simple. We have to keep doing what we're doing and not change anything because it's the World Series.''</p>
        <p>Leiter, who has won the World Series with both Toronto and Florida, said, ''The good teams that end up winning have the ability to not think of it as any different.''</p>
        <p>World champions, he said, do not think of the ramifications of the World Series and are the teams that are able to relax the best and perform up to their capabilities.</p>
        <p>''Obviously, with the Yanks having won a couple of times they have that ability to do it because they've done it,'' Leiter said.</p>
        <p>The Mets have already shown their naivete. Benny Agbayani's prediction on Howard Stern's radio show Thursday that the Mets would beat the Yankees in five games may have been in jest, but even that little slip-up is telling. Just ask Cone, who made a similar blunder during the 1988 playoffs while pitching for the Mets.</p>
        <p>''You see how naive some guys are,'' Cone said. ''They make an innocent mistake and all of a sudden it's on the front page and they are reeling. There's too much time and too much space to fill.''</p>
        <p>Mets first baseman Todd Zeile said that Yankees players had little World Series experience when they beat the defending champion Braves in 1996. Zeile's teams have lost to the Yankees three times in the postseason, once with the Orioles that October and twice with the Rangers in the last two years.</p>
        <p>Zeile has seen a young boy reach down and turn a fly ball out into a home run at the Stadium and has twice been swept by the Yankees.</p>
        <p>''Anybody that thinks playoff or World Series experience is going to prepare us for what we're going to go through in this particular World Series are not looking at the real picture anyway,'' Zeile said.</p>
        <p>Timo Perez, the Mets' new leadoff hitter, has not appeared intimidated by anything since he joined the team on Aug. 30. He may have been the biggest reason the Mets beat the Cardinals in five games of the National League Championship Series.</p>
        <p>When he was asked last week if he was looking forward to visiting Yankee Stadium, he shrugged and said he grew up a Giants fan in the Dominican Republic because his favorite player was Barry Bonds.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, after coming off the field, Perez said, ''Who wouldn't be impressed?''</p>
        <p>But Todd Pratt, who will catch Leiter tonight with Piazza scheduled to be the designated hitter, said, ''It's just another field to me.''</p>
        <p>The Mets' success this season could be partly traced to their playoff experience last year, but they have proven to be susceptible to psychological barriers. They have still not shown the ability to beat the Braves. The Mets were 2-4 against the Yankees during the regular season, but there is no telling how they will react in the Series.</p>
        <p>Piazza had done nothing more than drive by the Stadium before he first visited it during the interleague series in 1998. He visited the monuments during one visit and thinks he has gotten the mystique factor out of his system.</p>
        <p>Piazza has also changed his reputation as an ineffective postseason hitter. In 14 games, he had hit only .211 in the playoffs before this season, with two home runs and seven runs batted in. This year, he is batting .323 with two homers and four R.B.I.</p>
        <p>But Piazza has never played in the World Series, and neither have many of his teammates.</p>
