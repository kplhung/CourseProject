        <p>You'd think we'd be happy. Here we are in a World Series we can't lose. It's us against ourselves. Hey, how about if the winner of this plays the Knicks? Every sports town is always so desperate to get its team into a championship final. We've got two, why are we all so anxious? I guess for the same reason things got a little testy between the states around 1861. The fact is, you have to consider the Civil War to be the original Subway Series. Same basic idea, just take a bunch of guys we all like, put them in different uniforms, then stand back and watch the fireworks. And I bet major league pitchers today probably throw about as hard as the little balls that came out of those muskets.</p>
        <p>I guess peaceful coexistence isn't all it's cracked up to be. For the past 38 years we've had two teams in the city. Real good teams.  One that plays using a designated hitter, the other, by the rules. But so what, people were happy. Sure we have the occasional little interleague shoving match, everyone knowing it's not a real fight. It's just a novel little sideshow that's in town for a few days -- yell, scream, sell some extra tickets, nothing really at stake. ''Bragging rights,'' they call it. Like anyone in this city waits to be given the right before they start bragging. But we don't have to play with cheap multicolored plastic poker chips anymore. Now, two big piles of actual crumpled cash have been pushed to the center of the table. And very few singles, by the way. Some pretty big bills had to be thrown in to make this pot: $91 million (Piazza), $87 million (Williams), $33 million (Clemens).</p>

        <p>This World Series is like that first moment in your life when you are seriously asked by one of your friends, ''So, you want to play for money?''</p>
        <p>There is nothing like that twinge, the fear, the thrill and the real reason they had to invent the jockstrap. Suddenly, inside the head of every New York baseball fan is the sound of the safety bar on the Cyclone as it hits you a little too hard in the chest. You swallow, ''Well, here we go.''</p>
        <p>The instant hook line every interviewee grabbed onto was, ''It's great for the city.'' So true. New York needs this. ''Finally -- some spark in a city so obviously lacking in any kind of overt competitiveness,'' I thought to myself as I washed the bicycle messenger tire marks off the side of my face before dinner.</p>
        <p>And what if you are lucky enough to actually go to one of these games? Is that lucky enough? Or might you need just a little more luck to get back to the parking lot unscathed? Let's be honest, take away the scoreboard and all you have is an entire city screaming at itself. Confiscate the ''#1'' foam fingers and it's a race riot with peanuts. We know the police have horses for crowd control. Maybe fire hoses would be a better idea. I never got the horses. We all have cars, no one is scared of a horse.</p>
        <p>Speaking for myself, I am ready. I lived in Los Angeles during the earthquakes, the fires and the riots. There were some tough times. But the lack of a designated hitter made it bearable. What will the city be like this week? New York is a city that prides itself on its productivity. Well, we're not getting nothing done this week. We'll be yakking in the halls all day and huddling around the sports radio into the wee hours like Londoners during the Blitz. Our country that looks to us as the leader in financial markets, fashion, advertising and media will just have to wait until we're done fighting this out with ourselves. To the rest of the nation, we are currently embroiled in a domestic disturbance.</p>
        <p>''Don't worry, America, Mommy and Daddy aren't splitting up. They're just having a little problem right now. One of your parents needs to beat the stuffing out of the other one. Go watch one of your little football games for a while, we'll let you know when we're done.''</p>
        <p>Otherwise, it will be a week like any other. People will die, others will be born. If my wife decides to go into labor early, there's a good chance I'll be taking part in the latter. It also means if I can get a TV in the delivery room, there will be two people screaming at the top of their lungs at the same time, but for somewhat different reasons. I'm sure our little he/she-to-be will understand. I can't think of a better way for a new life to come into the world than hearing someone shout ''Safe!'' at the exact right moment.</p>
