      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Let me begin with a memory. It was Oct. 5, 1947, and I was in the Yankee Stadium bleachers, with the Yankees trailing 8-5 in the sixth. With two men on and two men out, Joe DiMaggio hit a tremendous drive to the deepest part of center field. A huge roar went up from the Yankee partisans in the bleachers, and then, as Al Gionfriddo made his celebrated catch, it seemed to ebb and turn into a gasp, while from the same section a second roar of approval exploded from the Dodger fans seated right there with us. Did I actually see the catch? I think I did. Did I see DiMaggio famously kick the dirt as he reached second, a moment replayed on countless television biographies of him because it was the rarest display of public emotion on his part? Again, I think I did. Who knows? Memory is often less about truth than about what we want it to be.</p>
        <p>I think memories like this are critical to the current excitement in the city -- baseball remains the most rooted of our sports and connects us to generations before, so that at a moment like this past and present merge. When I was young there were three teams in the city and all three were good. Since there were only 16 teams in both leagues and only about four or five of them were actually competitive, a Subway Series for a time seemed something of a New Yorker's birthright.</p>

Again, I think I did. Who knows? Memory is often less about truth than about what we want it to be.</p>
        <p>I think memories like this are critical to the current excitement in the city -- baseball remains the most rooted of our sports and connects us to generations before, so that at a moment like this past and present merge. When I was young there were three teams in the city and all three were good. Since there were only 16 teams in both leagues and only about four or five of them were actually competitive, a Subway Series for a time seemed something of a New Yorker's birthright.</p>
        <p>The last time two New York teams played in a Series, Dwight Eisenhower was running against Adlai Stevenson, the subway token was 15 cents and the door was just beginning to open for black and Hispanic players. In 1956 the Yankees, not exactly an affirmative action employer, were ever so timidly making their first accommodations to a more diverse sports world. Elston Howard had joined the club the year before. These days, on the occasion that El Duque pitches, the current Yankees will start as many as six players of black and Hispanic origin.</p>
        <p>There was in those Octobers now past a great sense of celebration. A Subway Series helped New Yorkers do one of their favorite things -- think about themselves. You could, in some of those years before television and air conditioning made their great strides forward, walk down the street in one of the boroughs, hear radios blasting out through open windows and never miss a play.</p>
        <p>It's all different now. If you get in a cab these days the odds are slim (it must be those foreigners that John Rocker was complaining about) that the driver will care about baseball. Today's players are bigger, stronger, faster and much, much richer. Ballantine beer is gone, as are Old Gold cigarettes. Baseball no longer dominates the landscape of sports as it did. Because of television, by the late 50's and early 60's pro football was beginning to reach parity with pro baseball. But it's going to be fun here for about two weeks, and it's going to flood many of us with memories of what we will choose to think of as a simpler era and where we were on a given day when baseball ruled the city.</p>
        <p>Normally getting just one team into a championship event serves to bring a community together, and people talk to each other about sports across the normal barriers of class, age, and ethnicity. A Subway Series is slightly different; it both unites and divides. Right now the city seems quite pleasantly wired for the event: after all, there's nothing more exciting than a war within a family, which in a way this is.</p>
        <p>On a brief poll on our block, I find a doorman and a super who are for the Yankees, and a doorman and a super who are for the Mets. In our building, Ralph Thomas, who runs the elevator, is, I think, covertly for the Mets, but he's quite low-key about it because he knows that Jeff and Linda Drogin and I are Yankee fans.</p>
        <p>The crowds will be noisier than in the past -- there's less civility at the ballpark because there's less civility in the society. The networks may be worried about the lack of geographic diversity and its effect on ratings. The rest of the nation will probably be underwhelmed. After all, much of America, for reasons that continually perplex most New Yorkers, sees us as loud, noisy, and aggressive, above all insensitive to the nuances and pleasures and culture of other places. That is, the rest of the country sees New York much the way the rest of the world sees America.</p>
        <p>Both teams seem to me very good, well balanced with good pitching. If anything, the Mets have been playing better all-around baseball for the last six weeks. But I'll go with my roots. The first game I remember hearing was in 1941, when Mickey Owen dropped Strike Three on Tommy Henrich and we still lived in the Bronx at the Grand Concourse and 174th Street. Rooting for the Yankees, it seems, is in my gene pool. Besides, I like Joe Torre. He's as decent and wise a man as I've met in professional sports. The Yankees in six or seven.</p>
