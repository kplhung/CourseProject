        <p>General Electric made an offer yesterday to buy Honeywell International, ending United Technologies' $40.3 billion deal to acquire the Morristown, N.J., company.</p>
        <p>Although United Technologies withdrew its bid for Honeywell when it learned of the G.E. proposal and is believed to be unlikely to get back into the fray, other suitors may appear and start a bidding war for all or part of Honeywell. Among the possible suitors are Siemens of Germany and Tyco International.</p>
        <p>Honeywell's board is expected to meet over the weekend to discuss its options.</p>
        <p>Honeywell and G.E. are a good fit. Both make plastics and chemicals and power generation systems. GE Aircraft Engines is a major player in wide-bodied jets and other commercial aircraft, while Honeywell's strength is in avionics and business jet engines. Both companies make engines for regional aircraft, but the overlap is smaller than it would have been between Honeywell and United Technologies' Pratt &amp; Whitney unit.</p>
        <p>And the two companies are a good cultural fit, analysts said.</p>
