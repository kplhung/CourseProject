        <p>I never thought I'd see the day when I actually rooted for the Yankees. As a boy growing up in New Jersey in the 1940's, I learned to loathe them. They were so lordly, so insufferably efficient, so smugly confident, so appropriately pinstriped. Others might thrill to the sight of DiMaggio effortlessly shagging a fly ball in center field, or King Kong Keller lofting one into the stands, or Fireman Joe Page shutting down a rally. But I couldn't stand a team that was so unbelievably excellent, so clearly dominant that it seemed inhuman.</p>
        <p>How could anyone love a team that won 10 pennants and 9 world championships in the 13 years that DiMaggio was its star? It didn't get much better when Mickey Mantle and Roger Maris and Reggie Jackson came along. For a fan who loves to root for the underdog, who likes to feel that his cheers really mean something and are not simply accepted as the team's due, it was hard to like the Yankees. One might as well root for U.S. Steel or J. P. Morgan.</p>

        <p>How could anyone love a team that won 10 pennants and 9 world championships in the 13 years that DiMaggio was its star? It didn't get much better when Mickey Mantle and Roger Maris and Reggie Jackson came along. For a fan who loves to root for the underdog, who likes to feel that his cheers really mean something and are not simply accepted as the team's due, it was hard to like the Yankees. One might as well root for U.S. Steel or J. P. Morgan.</p>
        <p>But today's Yankees are a different story. Even though they had an unbelievable season in 1998, winning an all-time high of 125 games, including a World Series sweep, this fan always had the feeling they were running on luck, that it could all fall apart with the flick of an opponent's bat. This year it almost did fall apart, as the Yankees tanked badly toward the season's end, dropping 15 of their last 18 games before backing into the playoffs. The playoffs themselves haven't been much easier. In the only playoff game I have attended, the Yankees looked awful, losing 11-1 to the Athletics, a dispiriting setback that forced them to fly bleary-eyed back to Oakland to win the division series. What a wonderful triumph over adversity!</p>
        <p>Gradually this Yankee team seems to be overcoming its manifest frailties. Bats once silent are reviving, pitchers once clobbered are finding their grooves. No longer the colossus it once seemed, the team is finally coming together when it has to. I'm surprised to find that I hope the Yankees survive the upstart but formidable-looking Mets. The Yankees have lost their aura of indomitability and inevitability. They have become a team that even I can root for. They really need us, finally.</p>
