        <p>The Transportation Department warned airlines yesterday that they faced sanctions if they did not tell consumers who made reservations over the telephone that cheaper fares might be available on the Internet, but it stopped short of requiring the airlines to say exactly what those fares would be.</p>
        <p>The department said airlines could satisfy their legal obligation if, before connecting callers to reservation agents, they played a recording saying that cheaper fares were sometimes available over the Internet or by e-mail.</p>
        <p>The ruling stemmed from a complaint by Donald L. Pevsner, a lawyer and aviation consumer advocate, that inexpensive Internet fares offered by airlines discriminated against non-Internet users who booked tickets over the telephone.</p>
        <p>Since Mr. Pevsner filed his petition in early 1997, the issue has gained more attention because the number of tickets bought online has soared. About 6 percent of all tickets are now bought online, according to a recent report by the Transportation Department's inspector general, up from one-half of 1 percent in 1996. The figure is expected to grow to 11 percent by 2003.</p>
        <p>Last summer, the inspector general told Congress there could be a vast difference between the fares airlines quoted to consumers over the telephone and the price they charged for the same ticket on the Internet. In one example, a trip between Newark and New Orleans, a reservation agent quoted a price of $1,791 for the same round-trip ticket that was available for $140 on a World Wide Web site.</p>
        <p>The Transportation Department rejected Mr. Pevsner's proposal that it adopt a new rule requiring airlines to disclose the existence of lower Internet fares because, it said, current regulations already prohibited airlines from deceiving consumers about ticket prices.</p>
        <p>The department's order said that requiring reservation agents to quote Internet fares to all callers, as Mr. Pevsner also requested, would raise airline costs and might deter airlines from offering the lower fares. The order concluded that the existence of Internet fares was not discriminatory because ''access to the Internet is now available to virtually anyone.''</p>
        <p>But the order also put airlines on notice that they could not deceive consumers and could face sanctions if they failed to alert callers to the possibility of a lower Internet fare.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pevsner said the government did not go far enough. ''Not mandating that the Internet fare be disclosed at the time of inquiry is, to me, a grievous shortcoming,'' he said by telephone from his home in Kingston, N.Y.</p>
        <p>''To say that virtually everyone has access to the Internet is a gross exaggeration,'' he added. ''Low-income people, who need the lower fares the most, are the ones who have the least access to the Internet.''</p>
        <p>Michael Wascomb, a spokesman for the Air Transport Association, which represents the major airlines, said the industry was already abiding by the commitment it made to Congress last year to offer consumers the lowest fares. But he said yesterday's order appeared reasonable.</p>
        <p>''At first glance, it does not appear to be an onerous requirement to simply refer people to the airline Web site,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Correction:  October 25, 2000, Wednesday  An article in Business Day on Saturday about a Transportation Department order requiring airlines to notify customers of discount fares available online misspelled the surname of a spokesman for the Air Transport Association, who said the order appeared reasonable. He is Michael Wascom, not Wascomb.</p>
