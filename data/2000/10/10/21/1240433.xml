        <p>Once upon a time, the world of academic satire seemed to be a British protectorate. Kingsley Amis's ''Lucky Jim'' set the rules of the game and David Lodge's trio of academic farces, ''Changing Places,'' ''Small World'' and ''Nice Work,'' earned him an adjective: Lodgean.</p>
        <p>There were, of course, American attempts. The mid-1950's were bountiful years, bringing ''The Groves of Academe,'' Mary McCarthy's novel about a man who tries to save his job by pretending that he's a blacklisted Communist; ''Pictures From an Institution,'' Randall Jarrell's spoof of Mary McCarthy as she was writing that novel; and ''Pnin,'' Vladimir Nabokov's tale of a Russian professor in America with a tenuous grip on the English language.</p>

        <p>Once upon a time, the world of academic satire seemed to be a British protectorate. Kingsley Amis's ''Lucky Jim'' set the rules of the game and David Lodge's trio of academic farces, ''Changing Places,'' ''Small World'' and ''Nice Work,'' earned him an adjective: Lodgean.</p>
        <p>There were, of course, American attempts. The mid-1950's were bountiful years, bringing ''The Groves of Academe,'' Mary McCarthy's novel about a man who tries to save his job by pretending that he's a blacklisted Communist; ''Pictures From an Institution,'' Randall Jarrell's spoof of Mary McCarthy as she was writing that novel; and ''Pnin,'' Vladimir Nabokov's tale of a Russian professor in America with a tenuous grip on the English language.</p>
        <p>But this year the American campus novel has staked out rougher territory, something more tragic. Three new novels have appeared in 2000: ''Ravelstein,'' Saul Bellow's fictional memoir about the death of Allan Bloom, his high-living friend at the University of Chicago; ''The Human Stain,'' Philip Roth's tale of a professor ruined by his use of the word ''spook''; and ''Blue Angel,'' Francine Prose's novel about a professor undone by his student's sexual harassment plot and novel. This trio followed fairly closely on the hooves of ''Moo,'' by Jane Smiley, and ''The Handmaid of Desire,'' by John L'Heureux.</p>
        <p>What has changed? What has made these later works darker? Is it bitterness about deconstruction and the death of the author? Is it AIDS? Is it a backlash against feminism? Against youth? Maybe something will emerge by looking not at the characters' depths but at the little things that define them: their sex lives, their clothes, their nemeses.</p>
        <p>It is difficult to tell much from the details, except this: Freud was a lot more popular a half-century ago. There was more imaginary illness in the 50's than now. No one cares about Marxism and Communism the way they used to. The Partisan Review has fallen and the New York Review of Books has risen in its place. There is much, much more sex going on now. Nearly half of it is lesbian or gay sex. Sex between students and teachers is expected and constant. Sexual harassment charges are almost as hated as sexual harassment. Novelists have nothing but contempt for their students who write fiction. And women are better schemers than men.</p>
        <p>Despite these changes, there seem to be some unwritten laws governing academic novels that have remained constant, however apparently trivial. The word ''moo'' pops up a little too often. ''The Iliad'' is always good for a quote, particularly the first line. And then there are the eggs: it appears you can't write a campus novel without breaking a few.</p>
