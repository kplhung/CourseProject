        <p>Canada's annual inflation rate rose to 2.7 percent in September from 2.5 percent in August, with most of the increase resulting from rising gasoline and fuel oil prices. The increase was less than most economists had expected. The price of gasoline rose by 6 percent last month, making it 18 percent more expensive than a year earlier. Fuel oil and natural gas prices were 24 and 44 percent higher on the year. Excluding energy, the consumer price index rose at a 1.5 percent annual pace in September, which compared with 1.7 percent in August. An increase of 3.2 percent in university and private school fees was the smallest in 22 years and helped restrain core inflation.</p>
