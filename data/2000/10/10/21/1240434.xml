        <p>Isolated between two of the world's tallest mountain ranges, the Fergana Valley is the breadbasket of Central Asia. Its tens of thousands of acres of fields, pastures and orchards feed millions of people in the region, and its cotton production is crucial to the economy.</p>
        <p>Its teeming bazaars, too, are an integral part of the region's history as part of the Silk Road: the markets are exotic rainbows of color and diversity, from the thick felt rugs of onetime mountain nomads to the radiant silk weavings of Marghelan to qurduq fat from sheep and thick sausages made of horse meat.</p>
        <p>But at the head of the valley, poised silently along the banks of the swift-running Maili Suu River, stands a Soviet-era uranium processing plant whose estimated 2.5 million cubic yards of radioactive waste represents a potential environmental disaster. It could wipe out the way of life that has thrived here for millenniums and threaten the lives and livelihoods of 10 million people in three Central Asian countries.</p>
        <p>The material is buried under thin layers of gravel, sand and clay. Much of it is highly radioactive and on unstable ground, susceptible to earthquakes, landslides and floods that could send the material into the river and ultimately the water system of the valley.</p>
        <p>Just as winds spread contaminated dust from the Chernobyl nuclear plant accident in 1986, the rivers, streams and irrigation canals that lace the valley downstream could carry radioactive material throughout the 60,000 square miles in the basin between the Tian Shan and Pamir-Alai ranges.</p>
        <p>''This is a major environmental disaster waiting to happen,'' warned an internal analysis done last year by the American Embassy in Bishkek, the capital of Kyrgyzstan. ''The United States government should take the lead in helping to defuse this environmental time bomb.''</p>
        <p>The risk was echoed in an unpublished draft paper prepared in June by the United Nations Development Program. The paper outlined how waste would make its way from the Maili Suu into the valley's main water source, the Syr Darya River, and contaminate the entire basin, the most densely populated part of Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.</p>
        <p>The contamination could destroy the agriculture base, force the immediate evacuation of 500,000 people and damage the economies and stability of all three countries, Yuri Misnikov, a senior United Nations official in Bishkek, said in an interview.</p>
        <p>The Maili Suu plant is among dozens of environmental hazards littering Central Asia as a legacy of Soviet domination. Some are well known, like the former nuclear testing site at Semey in northern Kazakhstan, known as Semipalatinsk in Soviet times. Others are obscured by decades of secrecy.</p>
        <p>No one knows how many Soviet-era repositories of uranium waste and toxic chemicals are scattered throughout Kyrgyzstan. Eight radioactive dumps were found in a village outside Jalal-Abad in the southern region, and radioactive waste was discovered on the shore of Lake Issyk Kul, the huge mountain lake in the north.</p>
        <p>Experts say the worst site is at Maili Suu. Nearby mines provided raw material for the plant that produced weapons-grade uranium as the Soviets furiously developed an arsenal of atomic weapons for the cold war. The plant operated from 1948 to 1968, and its ruins stand not far from the river.</p>
        <p>Twenty-three heaps of waste and 13 mining dumps have been identified. The exact amount and composition of the waste are unknown, because the records were taken to Moscow after the plant closed and the Russians have so far rejected Kyrgyz requests for access to the documents.</p>
        <p>Radioactivity ranges from 10 to 50 times above normal levels in some areas, according to government officials in Maili Suu and Edward Taransenka, an environmental officer with the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has been studying the site.</p>
        <p>Prolonged exposure is dangerous, but the larger threat is that a natural disaster could send the waste into the river. Kyrgyzstan's Environment Ministry said three of the most radioactive sites are on particularly unstable ground.</p>
        <p>Despite the danger, no effort has been made to eliminate or mitigate the risks, though local officials have begged for new containment structures and for the moving of the most dangerous sites away from the river. Cost estimates range from $1 million to $3 million.</p>
        <p>Part of the reason for the inaction is that the Central Asian governments face more immediate troubles, ranging from incursions by Islamic rebels to rising poverty and weak economies. In addition, the problem requires a regional solution and the countries have refused to discuss it jointly, though Kyrgyzstan has pushed for talks.</p>
        <p>Foreign governments and international agencies have not stepped in to find a solution. American officials said privately that the responsibility belonged to the Central Asian countries. The United Nations has not given Maili Suu the priority necessary to provoke a coordinated response.</p>
        <p>''People have come here and studied and promised to do something, but they have done nothing,'' Ashir Adbullaev, director of civil defense and emergencies in Maili Suu, said as he stood beside two of the most dangerous sites.</p>
        <p>The place looks benign. The waste is kept in large reservoirs that were covered with a layer of clay and two feet of sand and gravel as they were filled.</p>
        <p>Those buried reservoirs now form gently rolling mounds and slopes, with a fuzz of grass. Cattle sometimes graze on the hills, and children play there. Most of the barbed-wire fencing put up to keep out people and animals has been dismantled by locals for use in penning their livestock.</p>
        <p>The city of Maili Suu has 24,000 residents and stretches for seven miles along the river. Dr. Nemat Mambetov, the region's epidemiologist, said that he had tracked increased incidences of cancer and blood diseases in Maili Suu since 1982, but that no direct relationship to the waste had been established.</p>
        <p>The city is also dotted with ''hot spots'' of high radioactivity. Tons of material spilled into the river and washed down in 1958 when a wall at one reservoir gave way. The Soviets tried to keep the breach secret, but Dr. Mambetov said he believed that the radioactivity in town had come from that incident and smaller spills over the years.</p>
        <p>Concern increased after a landslide on July 4, 1992, blocked the river. The water backed up and almost reached the waste sites before the river began flowing again.</p>
        <p>Since then, Mr. Adbullaev said, it has seemed to be only a matter of time before something unleashes the poisons just below the surface on the banks of the Maili Suu and sends them coursing into the Fergana Valley.</p>
