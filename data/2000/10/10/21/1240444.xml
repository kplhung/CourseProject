        <p>The Kyoei Life Insurance Company sought court protection today from creditors in Japan's biggest bankruptcy since World War II, nearly two-thirds larger than the previous record corporate failure, by another insurer, just 11 days ago.</p>
        <p>Kyoei's bankruptcy came after talks with the Prudential Insurance Company of America about a possible joint venture ended without an agreement. Kyoei said today that it would seek Prudential's help in reorganizing. There were expectations that Prudential would get much better terms from such an arrangement.</p>
        <p>With liabilities of 4.6 trillion yen, or nearly $43 billion, Kyoei's failure is about 60 percent larger than that of the Chiyoda Mutual Life Company, which sought bankruptcy protection on Oct. 9, with about $27 billion in liabilities. Until today, that was the country's largest business failure.</p>
        <p>Chiyoda's fall after the failure of five other life insurers might have hastened Kyoei's bankruptcy, the company suggested. ''The recent series of failures at life insurers fanned fears about our credibility, resulting in poor sales of new policies and cancellations of old ones,'' Kyoei said in a written statement.</p>
        <p>The demise of Kyoei and Chiyoda, which have been troubled for years, raises pressure on the government to use public money to strengthen the life insurance industry.</p>
        <p>Japan's life insurers are finding it difficult to make good on policies sold more than a decade ago, when interest rates were much higher. With rates now hovering near record lows because of Japan's protracted economic weakness, the returns on their investments cannot cover their obligations to policyholders.</p>
        <p>Foreign investors will probably regard Kyoei's demise as yet another sign that the Japanese economy is shedding some weaknesses that have been holding it back for the last decade. But in the short term, bankruptcies like Kyoei's are likely to dampen business and consumer sentiment and slow economic growth. The total debt from bankruptcies here reached $100 billion in the six months that ended Sept. 30, almost 50 percent more than in the period a year earlier.</p>
        <p>The Financial Reconstruction Commission, the agency in charge of overhauling Japan's financial system, said Kyoei's policyholders are protected by the Life Insurance Policyholder Protection Corporation, a government agency.</p>
        <p>Hideyuki Aizawa, the head of the commission, said he thought Kyoei would be the last failure among the life insurers. ''I think this is about it,'' he said. ''I haven't heard of any other life insurers that are in trouble.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Aizawa had also been confident that Chiyoda Life would not fail, just one day before it did.</p>
        <p>Mr. Aizawa said he learned of the depth of Kyoei's troubles on Tuesday, when the company reported its financial standing through Sept. 30 to the agency.</p>
        <p>Kyoei had tried to resuscitate itself by cutting branches and issuing preferred shares to regional banks. But its situation deteriorated this year, as stock prices plunged and bond investors suffered their worst year in six years.</p>
        <p>In June, Prudential said that it was working on a 30 billion yen rescue package for Kyoei. Prudential and Kyoei have a relationship going back more than two decades, and they had planned to create a joint venture.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Aizawa said those plans fell apart when Prudential decided that reviving Kyoei would probably cost more than 30 billion yen.</p>
        <p>Kyoei's bankruptcy presents Prudential with advantages that its original bailout plan did not. Already, some officials are quietly suggesting that the American insurer is acting opportunistically.</p>
        <p>Since Prudential started negotiating with Kyoei, conditions have changed to make pursuing partnerships with bankrupt companies more favorable. Bankruptcy in general has become more acceptable here, and new laws meant specifically to help life insurers to reorganize in a timely manner have taken effect.</p>
        <p>Prudential would probably gain greater control over Kyoei through a bankruptcy. It would also avoid responsibility for many of the Japanese insurer's liabilities, which would probably fall to the taxpayers.</p>
        <p>Bob DeFillippo, a Prudential spokesman, said his company was not trying to gain an advantage from Kyoei's failure. ''We're acting in a way that is an attempt to assist what is essentially a 20-year business association in Japan,'' he said.</p>
