        <p>I met Gus Hall, America's most durable official Communist, in 1983, when I paid him a visit in his baronial eighth-floor office at the West 23rd Street headquarters of the American Communist Party. Then, as at his death last week, he seemed stubbornly unapologetic about being general secretary of a party whose time had passed.</p>
        <p>To get to him, I had to pass a ground-floor metal detector and a polite but firm security guard. Then I squeezed my way into an elevator packed with children and boisterous comrades, clearly at home in a building that still contained its own day care center, commissary, infirmary and library -- all part of its insulation from a hostile, noncommunist world.</p>
        <p>The occasion for my visit, preceded by much petitioning and negotiation, was the publication of David Garrow's ''The F.B.I. and Dr. Martin Luther King,'' which stated that during the mid-1950's Moscow had sent the party $1 million a year via a party functionary and alleged double agent.</p>
        <p>I had a particular interest in this accusation, which was supported only by anonymous F.B.I. sources, because I was working on a story about Dr. King's close adviser, Stanley Levison. In 1963, J. Edgar Hoover, with the excuse that Mr. Levison might be privy to the Communists' money deal, had put a tap on Dr. King's phone. Mr. Levison had always denied any impropriety, but now, in 1983, I wanted to examine the party's books to see if there had been a basis for thinking there had been a deal at all.</p>
        <p>Hall, then 73, scoffed at the idea that the party had received that kind of money in those years. He said with a chuckle that he had no firsthand knowledge, though, because at that time he had been serving an eight-year sentence in Leavenworth. But he recalled that the party had had to struggle for every penny then and that to pay the rent, the faithful had been reduced to selling copies of The Daily Worker on street corners.</p>
        <p>Hall went to prison after being convicted in 1949, along with 10 other top leaders of the party -- a legal organization, by the way -- of conspiring ''to teach and advocate the overthrow of the government by force and violence.'' Naturally, he was a top target in the so-called McCarthy era. When he and three comrades -- erroneously believing that fascism was coming to America -- jumped bail to go underground, the consequences were far-reaching. In the ensuing investigation, for example, the mystery writer Dashiell Hammett refused to turn over to the Justice Department a list of the people who had put up bail for Hall -- and went to jail himself. According to Hoover, Hall was ''a powerful dangerous foe of America,'' a ''fanatical practitioner,'' a ''coldly calculating Communist conniver.''</p>
        <p>That Gus Hall was difficult for me to imagine as I chatted with the amiable one before me. He hadn't known Levison, he said. As for my examining the books, he explained that every year, like all national Communist parties, the American party sent its files to the Kremlin, where they were available for scrutiny -- with permission of the national party involved. Could I have his permission, then? Write him a letter, he said. I did, and a few weeks later, permission was denied.</p>
        <p>Arthur Miller once observed,''An era may be said to end when its basic illusions are exhausted.'' Now that Hall, who criticized Mikhail Gorbachev and remained a hard-liner to the end, is gone, it may seem natural to suggest that the illusions -- and wariness -- he clung to might also be gone.</p>
        <p>But a new cadre of cold war historians seems intent on seizing fragments from cold war archives, ambiguous intercepts from cables between Moscow and its American-based agents and other ephemera to prove that the American Communist Party was indeed at the center of a nest of spies.</p>
        <p>The matter, I would suggest, is still in dispute. It should not be forgotten that whatever he did or didn't do or know about as head of the Communist Party, when he was still on the lam, Hall was seized in Mexico City and abducted back across the border without the formality of an extradition hearing. In the domestic cold war, the Communists were not the only lawbreakers. While most illusions about Soviet-style Communism may be exhausted, the paranoia about Gus Hall's old party, with its now-tiny membership, seems still to be alive.</p>
