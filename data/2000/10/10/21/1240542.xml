        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I was heartened to read that I am not alone -- more than a third of New Yorkers say they root equally hard for the Mets and the Yankees (front page, Oct. 19). For those of us who have lovingly followed both teams for years, this Subway Series has created a major personal dilemma.</p>
        <p>How am I supposed to pick between Derek Jeter, as great a player and as much a New York icon as the Yankees have ever seen, and John Franco, who grew up in Brooklyn and who has kept the faith at Shea long past the call of duty? How can I root against either Joe Torre, another Big Apple hero, or Bobby Valentine, who in his own way is the perfect symbol of New York with his brashness and persistence?</p>
        <p>While the papers are filled with stories of divided families and mutual hatred, many die-hard fans find themselves divided, an impossible position, with two teams to root for, and no one to loathe this October.</p>
