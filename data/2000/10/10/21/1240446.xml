        <p>When it comes to the Federal Reserve, the two presidential candidates profess to share a basic approach: hands off.</p>
        <p>But whether they like it or not, either Vice President Al Gore or Gov. George W. Bush will put an imprint on the central bank -- perhaps firmly.</p>
        <p>The winner of the presidential race will be able to appoint or reappoint at least five of the Fed's seven governors in the next four years.</p>
        <p>Should the central bank's chairman, Alan Greenspan, leave at or before the end of his current four-year term, which ends in June 2004, when he will be 78, the next president will also have a chance to place someone new in Mr. Greenspan's post at the pinnacle of economic policy making.</p>
        <p>''Anyone who doesn't understand that this election will have an impact on the economy through the Federal Reserve Board doesn't understand American politics,'' said Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, a Republican who is chairman of the Senate Banking Committee.</p>
        <p>Reflecting Mr. Greenspan's stature as the very embodiment of prosperity -- and clearly sensitive to any suggestion that they might exert political influence on the central bank -- both Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush have stressed their desire for continuity at the Fed.</p>
        <p>The vice president would be ''inclined to ask Greenspan to serve again'' when his current term expires, said Doug Hattaway, a spokesman for the Gore campaign.</p>
        <p>Lawrence B. Lindsey, a former Fed governor who is Mr. Bush's chief economic adviser, said that Mr. Bush was dedicated to protecting the Fed's independence and that he had been an early proponent of reappointing Mr. Greenspan to his current term.</p>
        <p>''There is no desire here to shape the Fed, except to provide quality governors with a diversity of backgrounds,'' Mr. Lindsey said.</p>
        <p>Still, the next administration will inevitably be tested on whether it should continue the Clinton administration's policy of avoiding public criticism of the Fed, particularly if the economy weakens. And the new president's appointments will help shape the central bank's approach not just to monetary policy but perhaps even more in the arena of financial regulation.</p>
        <p>On monetary policy, the new Fed appointees will immediately have an influential voice in the most important economic debate of this era: whether technology is permanently increasing the economy's ability to grow without generating inflation.</p>
        <p>The degree of their influence is hard to predict. In part, that is because Mr. Greenspan, as long as he remains on the job, is all but certain to continue to have the final word no matter what the composition of the Fed. But it is also because there is little if any correlation between the politics of the president making the appointment and the way governors vote on interest rate decisions.</p>
        <p>On regulation, where the main issues are the blurring of the line between commercial banks and Wall Street and the consolidation of the financial services industry, the ideological lines on the Fed are more apparent. Democratic appointees have been more sympathetic to consumer protection regulations, for example, than their Republican counterparts. And on regulatory policy Democrats have been more willing to challenge Mr. Greenspan, who has a strong preference for deregulation.</p>
        <p>The Federal Reserve is comprised of seven governors, including the chairman, and the 12 presidents of the regional Federal Reserve banks. The governors are appointed by the president to 14-year terms, subject to Senate confirmation. The bank presidents are appointed by the boards of the reserve banks. All seven governors and five of the bank presidents, on a rotating basis, vote on interest rate policy. Most regulatory issues are decided by the governors.</p>
        <p>The next president will be able to appoint or reappoint three governors immediately.</p>
        <p>There are two empty seats, which Senator Gramm, whose committee has jurisdiction over Fed nominations, has blocked President Clinton from filling, saying the choice should go to the next president. In addition, the board term of the vice chairman, Roger W. Ferguson, expired in January; Mr. Gramm has held up approval of his renomination, although Mr. Ferguson can remain in his job until he or someone else is confirmed by the Senate.</p>
        <p>In January 2002, Laurence H. Meyer's term as governor will expire. Two years later the term being served by Edward W. Kelley Jr., the only remaining Republican appointee other than Mr. Greenspan, will run out. Mr. Greenspan's current four-year term as chairman will expire in June 2004, although his board seat runs until 2006. Edward M. Gramlich's term runs until 2008.</p>
        <p>Neither candidate has given any public indication of whom he might select for any of the Fed positions.</p>
        <p>Should Mr. Greenspan leave, a President Gore could turn to Lawrence H. Summers, the current Treasury Secretary, or to a candidate from within the central bank, like William J. McDonough, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Robert E. Rubin, the former Treasury secretary, is another possible candidate.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush might look first to his current economic advisers, who in addition to Mr. Lindsey include Martin S. Feldstein of Harvard University, Michael Boskin of Stanford University and John B. Taylor of Stanford, one of the leading academic authorities on monetary policy.</p>
        <p>''It would be a very healthy thing for democracy if the candidates were pressed not only to say which economists they would consider appointing, but what kinds of perspectives they would consider in making their choices,'' said Tom Schlesinger, executive director of the Financial Markets Center, a liberal-leaning group that studies the Fed.</p>
        <p>Assuming the economy remains healthy, any appointees to the Fed by a new president could expect to face questions about two closely related issues. The more immediate of them is whether the unemployment rate needs to rise substantially above its current level, 3.9 percent, to avert an eventual upturn in inflation.</p>
        <p>The other, which could carry more profound long-term implications, is how enduring the effects of the technology revolution will prove to be on the economy's efficiency.</p>
        <p>For the last five years, the Fed has been the crucible of a debate over whether technology, along with other factors like globalization, is fundamentally reshaping the economy or merely giving it a temporary boost.</p>
        <p>Led by Mr. Greenspan, the Fed has proved pragmatic and flexible, gradually granting the economy far more running room than traditional theory would have allowed, in the belief that the United States is benefiting from a profound surge in the growth rate of productivity. Higher productivity means businesses can produce more for less, allowing profits and wages to rise without generating inflation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Greenspan has been increasingly optimistic that the improvement in productivity will continue for some time, and he has said he does not think 4 percent unemployment is incompatible with price stability.</p>
        <p>His views are not universally accepted within the Fed or among economists in general, however. Mr. Meyer, for example, has long asserted that the combination of 4 percent unemployment and moderate-to-strong growth will eventually ignite inflation. And some analysts say that productivity growth is too narrowly based in the technology sector and will fade as soon as the economy slows down.</p>
        <p>Those monetary policy debates are likely to continue no matter who is elected president. But the new president's choices could more clearly influence the Fed's posture on regulatory issues, with Democrats more likely to be activist and in favor of consumer protections and Republicans more likely to favor deregulation.</p>
        <p>It is largely a disagreement about regulation that has led Senator Gramm to block the Clinton administration's nominees to the Fed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gramm has been particularly concerned that Democratic appointees will enforce the Community Reinvestment Act, which seeks to insure that banks make a fair share of their loans to people in poor neighborhoods, in a way that amounts to the establishment of lending quotas. He said there were indications that the Fed would be more restrictive than Congress had intended in recent banking legislation in granting commercial banks the right to conduct more investment banking activities.</p>
        <p>''Regulatory policy is an area where there would be a stark difference,'' Mr. Gramm said. ''What has happened in this Federal Reserve Board is that the board has given Greenspan very wide latitude on monetary policy but the board has dominated on regulatory policy.''</p>
        <p>Alan Blinder, a former Fed vice chairman who is now an adviser to Mr. Gore, said there was a much greater likelihood that presidential appointments would influence regulatory policy than monetary policy.</p>
        <p>''There's a quasi-ideological divide between people who think consumer protection legislation is a good idea, a worthwhile function of the government in general and the Fed in particular, and those who think it's not,'' Mr. Blinder said. ''A Bush presidency versus a Gore presidency could make a difference there.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Blinder said that even on regulation the party lines could be blurry. He recalled voting with Mr. Lindsey when both were on the board in the mid-1990's to tighten regulations regarding how banks advertise their interest rates -- and doing so in opposition to Mr. Greenspan.</p>
        <p>Beyond monetary policy and regulation, the other big issue could be the Fed's independence.</p>
        <p>Far more than most previous administrations, the Clinton White House has studiously kept its mouth shut about the Fed, especially when it comes to interest rates. The policy helped increase the Fed's credibility with the financial markets by reducing the risk of political meddling in monetary policy.</p>
        <p>By contrast, President George Bush's administration openly criticized the Fed at times. Some of the former president's aides blame Mr. Greenspan for the elder Bush's loss to Mr. Clinton in 1992, saying the Fed did not cut rates early or aggressively enough to bring the economy out of recession starting in 1990.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lindsey said Governor Bush ''is a great believer in the political independence of the Fed.''</p>
        <p>But Democrats are happy to suggest that Governor Bush has not yet proved that he can resist the temptation to meddle with the Fed and that his family history with the central bank cannot be ignored.</p>
        <p>Giving the Fed a wide berth ''would continue to be the policy of a Gore administration,'' Mr. Blinder said. ''I'm less confident it would be the policy of a Bush administration.''</p>
