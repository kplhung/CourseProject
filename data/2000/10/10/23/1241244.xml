        <p>Trying to heal a rift with Israel's Arab citizens, Prime Minister Ehud Barak announced an inquiry today into the deaths of 13 Israeli Arabs in the current unrest and unveiled a four-year development plan for Arab communities.</p>
        <p>The moves were met with skepticism by Israeli Arab leaders, who said that the inquiry, by a committee of experts and retired judges instead of an official state commission, would lack binding authority. The development plan, they said, failed to address the roots of inequality of Israel's one million Arab citizens.</p>
        <p>The four-member panel, including a retired Arab judge and a former army chief of staff, is authorized to subpoena witnesses and is supposed to ''determine the details of the incidents as well as the factors that led to them,'' a government statement said.</p>
        <p>Ahmad Tibi, an Israeli Arab who is a member of Parliament, called the panel ''a whitewash committee'' that would lack the muscle of a state inquiry commission. Mr. Barak's failure to meet Arab demands for a state commission ''shows his unwillingness to uncover the truth and his refusal to respond to our accusations that the Israeli police deliberately fired live ammunition at Arab demonstrators who are Israeli citizens,'' Mr. Tibi said.</p>
        <p>A wave of Palestinian protests in the West Bank and Gaza Strip set off several days of unrest by Israeli Arabs this month. Barricading major roads and the entrances to their towns and villages, crowds of Israeli Arab youths hurled rocks at passing cars and at police officers, who responded with tear gas, rubber-coated steel bullets and occasionally with live ammunition.</p>
        <p>Israeli Arab leaders have expressed outrage that police officers fired at the protesters, in contrast with their responses to civil disturbances by Israeli Jews.</p>
        <p>Although the Israeli Arab protests were touched off, like the Palestinian protests, by a visit to Muslim shrines in Jerusalem by the rightist opposition leader, Ariel Sharon, the unrest was widely seen as an eruption of pent-up feelings of discrimination in Arab communities, where rates of poverty and unemployment are high.</p>
        <p>In an attempt to alleviate the sources of unrest, Mr. Barak today announced a four-year development plan for Israeli Arab communities.</p>
        <p>The billion-dollar program calls for investments in roads, sewage, schools and housing, adoption of master plans for the expansion of Arab communities and construction of industrial zones to generate jobs.</p>
        <p>''The government has a supreme duty to bring equality and integration of Israeli Arabs into the State of Israel,'' Mr. Barak said.</p>
        <p>Matan Vilnai, a member of Mr. Barak's cabinet who is coordinating the effort, called the proposal the first of its kind ''that deals with the bases of the fundamental problems facing the Arab sector in Israel.''</p>
        <p>However, Hashem Mahameed, an Israeli Arab lawmaker, said that the plan would do nothing to change longstanding attitudes of exclusion. ''The problem is not a few million dollars, but runs much deeper,'' Mr. Mahameed said. ''The attitude is that since Israel is the state of the Jewish people, whoever is not Jewish doesn't belong. This has to stop once and for all.''</p>
