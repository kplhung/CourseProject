        <p>Charles Savage, a Miami Herald reporter on the front lines of the newspaper's Everglades-to-ocean circulation war with the newly renamed South Florida Sun-Sentinel, found himself the not-exactly-proud possessor of a decidedly awkward exclusive this month.</p>
        <p>The Miami Herald (marketing division) was negotiating a deal for the right to put its name on Broward County's convention center as part of a deal worth $13 million in cash and advertising credits over 15 years. And, with Mr. Savage's reporting, The Miami Herald (reporting division) broke the news in the backyard of the Sun-Sentinel, formerly The Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel.</p>
        <p>Mr. Savage said last week that he had reported the deal like any other, but felt increasingly queasy about his role. First, his colleagues had an e-mail discussion about whether the deal created the appearance of a conflict of interest. Then the president of the South Florida chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists; the Poynter Institute, a journalism education organization; and The Wall Street Journal weighed in with the same question.</p>
        <p>When The Journal quoted from Mr. Savage's article as if it were a corporate news release, Mr. Savage doubted that he would ever be considered objective, even though his coverage received praise from competitors.</p>
        <p>''As a reporter, it makes me slightly uncomfortable to have my corporate boss in a contractual deal with the object of my coverage,'' Mr. Savage said. ''But as a footsoldier in the war against The Sun-Sentinel, I thought it was a good idea to give us a prominent presence in Fort Lauderdale.'' So, he decided that he had to ''choose between being a journalist and an employee.'' He asked to be taken off the story.</p>
        <p>No, said the city editor of The Herald in Broward County, Pat Andrews. ''I knew there was no way he was not going to do whatever needed to be done,'' she said. Alberto Ibarguen, The Herald's publisher, said that he relied on the reporter and editor to ''tell the truth no matter who is involved and to get the complete backing of the institution'' when they do.</p>
        <p>Mr. Savage's byline appeared on the Oct. 19 article reporting the deal's collapse when county officials rejected the newspaper's stipulation for a $1-a-ticket surcharge, the proceeds earmarked for Herald-designated charities.</p>

        <p>MEDIA TALK  Correction:  October 30, 2000, Monday  Because of an editing error, a report in the Media Talk column of Business Day last Monday about efforts by The Miami Herald to put its name on the Broward County convention center misstated the former name of a competitor. The paper, now The South Florida Sun-Sentinel, was until recently The Sun-Sentinel, not The Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel.</p>
