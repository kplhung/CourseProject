        <p>LIKE many industries, public broadcasting was not exactly thrilled to add the Web to its to-do list in the mid-90's. At the time, conservative members of Congress were calling for the end to federal subsidies, cable networks like the Learning Channel were threatening to lure away public television viewers, and the competition for private donations stretched the fund-raising abilities of public radio and television stations alike.</p>
        <p>Still, because viewers and listeners clamored for Web sites -- if only to learn more about the music they heard or to preview that night's program schedule -- public broadcasters dutifully answered the call, and set out looking for a way to pay for it. E-commerce seemed like a possibility, but it also seemed like a risky experiment for the stations within the Public Broadcasting Service and the National Public Radio network, which had scant retail expertise.</p>

        <p>LIKE many industries, public broadcasting was not exactly thrilled to add the Web to its to-do list in the mid-90's. At the time, conservative members of Congress were calling for the end to federal subsidies, cable networks like the Learning Channel were threatening to lure away public television viewers, and the competition for private donations stretched the fund-raising abilities of public radio and television stations alike.</p>
        <p>Still, because viewers and listeners clamored for Web sites -- if only to learn more about the music they heard or to preview that night's program schedule -- public broadcasters dutifully answered the call, and set out looking for a way to pay for it. E-commerce seemed like a possibility, but it also seemed like a risky experiment for the stations within the Public Broadcasting Service and the National Public Radio network, which had scant retail expertise.</p>
        <p>Now, though, with the formulas for e-commerce success starting to come more clearly into focus, the experiment looks less risky. Public radio and television stations are starting to build online stores or expand their previously modest online shops. As they do, they are looking not only to generate revenue, but to remain relevant to their audiences in an age when viewers and listeners are awash in media choices.</p>
        <p>The public broadcasting entities, like their commercial television counterparts, have a distinct advantage over many types of would-be Internet retailers: recognizable brands. But NPR and PBS and their affiliates also have at least one apparent advantage over commercial broadcasters: an extremely loyal audience that includes millions of people who already pay to support the programming. These people are good prospects for the videos and CD's that are among the main products of public broadcasting's online stores.</p>
        <p>PBS would not disclose how much revenue it generates from video sales, but one executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity, put the figure in the tens of millions. And the market for goods related to public radio is apparently ample. Minnesota Public Radio, which produces ''A Prairie Home Companion,'' among other shows, is particularly successful in this regard. Two years ago, it sold Rivertown Trading, which distributed MPR-related goods through catalogs, to Dayton Hudson for $120 million.</p>
        <p>Despite the allures, public broadcasters have witnessed enough of the carnage among e-tailers to remain a bit wary -- particularly because direct sales to consumers is still not their main area of expertise. Many have hedged their bets by farming out most of the customer service and order-processing responsibilities to outside companies, which take a percentage of the revenue from each sale.</p>
        <p>When PBS opened a shop on the PBS.org Web site three years ago, it was viewed as a way to take orders more efficiently than the 800-number operation that sold PBS videos, said Don Jalbert, who, as vice president of PBS Learning Media, oversees the PBS online store.</p>
        <p>But the PBS Web site quickly outgrew the first humble expectations. With the help of the consulting firm KPMG, PBS rolled out a new version of the shop in June, featuring 1,500 videos, books and CD's related to its programs. Both the order-taking and the fulfillment duties are handled by outside companies, Mr. Jalbert said. ''We're already profitable,'' he said, declining to elaborate.  ''It's tight, but we are profitable.''</p>
        <p>He also said revenues were growing significantly. ''We're 65 percent ahead of where we were last year at this point,'' Mr. Jalbert said, predicting continued growth as PBS promotes the online store on the air and in its printed video catalogs.</p>
        <p>Analysts said PBS's on-air promotion of its Web site had stirred anxiety among some member stations, which also want to drive viewers to the stations' own Web sites and online stores.  Steve Behrens, editor of Current magazine, which covers the public broadcasting industry, said the issue came down to whether viewers should identify more with PBS or their local PBS stations. The PBS member stations ultimately benefit from sales to the PBS Web site, because the proceeds can reduce the membership fees that PBS needs to raise from its affiliates. But direct Web sales are a more immediate tonic for the member stations' ledgers.</p>
        <p>''It's one of these affiliate-versus-national struggles that goes on all the time,'' Mr. Behrens said. ''Revenue is part of what's driving this. But more important, they want the direct relationship with viewers that PBS is getting.''</p>
        <p>There are similar rumblings within the National Public Radio family, as NPR prepares to open its first Web store next month. Tom Lix, president of Public Interactive, a for-profit company that builds Web sites for public radio and television stations, said that some of the public radio stations he had created Web sites for were wary of  NPR's e-commerce plans, ''because they do compete with NPR.''</p>
        <p>''It's a classic new-media situation, where people are working out the models as they go along,'' he said. ''And I think there probably will be a little tension. But I still think it's do-able, because in the end, people will stay focused on the mission.''</p>
        <p>NPR executives declined to say how the organization would divide the revenues for its online sales with its affiliates, or how NPR and its stations would handle the on-air promotions for their respective online stores. But Kenneth P. Stern, NPR's executive vice president, said, ''We look at this not as how to cut the individual transaction fees, but rather, how can we develop the economics of the NPR system as a whole.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, some local stations voice few concerns about how the e-commerce revenue comes their way -- as long as it comes. One of these is WHYY, a public radio and television station and production studio in Philadelphia. Robyn Goldman, executive director of WHYY Ventures, the division that sells products related to WHYY's shows, said the company retained the rights to promote its online store on all of the programs it produced. Moreover, she said, ''PBS sells some of our videos, and our stuff will also be in NPR's store.''</p>
        <p>If the goods are sold through another site or company, ''we make a lot less money through royalties,'' Ms. Goldman said, adding, ''But still, we've done quite well that way, too.''</p>
        <p>Tom Fowler, vice president of South Carolina Educational Radio, which operates eight NPR-affiliated stations covering South Carolina and parts of Georgia and North Carolina, said it did  not matter which Web store was promoted on the air. ''Most listeners don't know NPR from PRI from any of the other acronyms out there,'' he said, referring to Public Radio Internationl, which produces and distributes radio programs to more than 600 stations.</p>
        <p>What is more important, Mr. Fowler said, is that the audience relies on his stations to get the information in the first place. Good information, not Web sales, is what will keep listeners tuning in, Mr. Fowler said.</p>
        <p>''With all the things that are coming, with satellite radio and programming on the Internet, people will have choices,'' Mr. Fowler said. ''So however they happen to go online and get something -- whether it's from NPR or our site, it doesn't matter. All that matters is that they hear about it on our air.''</p>
