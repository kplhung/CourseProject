        <p>The General Electric Company has agreed to acquire Honeywell International, the diversified manufacturer, for $45 billion in stock, capping several intense rounds of deal making that broke up an impending merger between United Technologies and Honeywell.</p>
        <p>As part of the agreement, John F. Welch Jr., G.E.'s chairman, will defer his planned retirement from April until the end of 2001 to see the deal through and manage his company's largest acquisition. G.E. expects the transaction to be completed by early next year.</p>
        <p>The deal brings Honeywell -- itself formed by a merger between Honeywell Inc. and Allied Signal -- into General Electric's portfolio of disparate businesses, including the manufacture of aircraft engines and competition in network television through its NBC unit. Honeywell, based in Morristown, N.J., produces aerospace systems, power and transportation products, specialty chemicals, home security systems and building controls.</p>
        <p>It will close its 550-employee headquarters, though 1,750 others in various businesses and laboratories on its leased Morristown campus will stay where they are for now.</p>
        <p>G.E. does expect the deal to yield significant cost savings, but the companies have not determined how many members of its combined work force of 460,000 might lose their jobs.</p>
        <p>G.E.'s directors approved the deal yesterday after Honeywell's board voted on Saturday evening in favor of being acquired by G.E., the nation's largest old-time conglomerate. The combination must be approved by regulators both in the United States and Europe. They are likely to scrutinize the acquisition and possibly force divestitures of certain assets.</p>
        <p>Under the terms of the transaction, G.E. will pay 1.055 shares for each of Honeywell's roughly 817 million fully diluted shares, valuing each Honeywell share at $55.39, or about 17 percent more than its Friday closing price of $47. Honeywell's stock increased nearly 11 percent on Friday as investors speculated that G.E. planned to trump United Technologies' offer for the company. People close to the deal said G.E. would also assume about $3 billion in debt.</p>
        <p>''This is certainly a better deal for shareholders than the United Technologies deal,'' said David Bleustein, an analyst with PaineWebber.</p>
        <p>G.E.'s offer is 9.2 percent higher than United Technologies' scuttled offer of about $50.32 a share.</p>
        <p>G.E.'s acquisition of Honeywell was brokered in a 24-hour flurry of phone calls, faxes and meetings after Thursday's announcement by United Technologies that it was in talks to acquire Honeywell.</p>
        <p>According to executives close to the negotiations, Honeywell's board began meeting at 8 a.m. on Friday to discuss the particulars of the United Technologies deal. About 11 a.m., they were pinpointing several issues that still needed to be resolved with the United Technologies board when Michael R. Bonsignore, chief executive of Honeywell, was interrupted by his secretary, who told him that Mr. Welch was on the phone.</p>
        <p>Mr. Welch offered to immediately fly by helicopter to Honeywell's headquarters in Morristown to discuss a possible G.E. counterbid. Mr. Bonsignore responded that the board had already convened, and that he did not want to halt the proceedings unless he had a concrete offer. By 11:30 a.m., Mr. Welch had faxed him a handwritten note spelling out some of the specifics of an all-stock offer.</p>
        <p>Honeywell's board recessed until 5 p.m. on Saturday to give Mr. Bonsignore and Mr. Welch time to negotiate.</p>
        <p>The two chief executives met Friday afternoon in the New York offices of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom, Honeywell's lawyers, to discuss the details of the G.E. offer. On Saturday morning, they returned to Skadden Arps, this time with other corporate officers and advisers. Honeywell's board voted late that evening to accept G.E.'s offer.</p>
        <p>United Technologies did not learn the details of G.E.'s offer until it was too late to respond, said George David, the company's chief executive. He said Mr. Bonsignore called him on Friday afternoon and said Honeywell was talking to G.E. as well.</p>
        <p>Mr. David did not bow out immediately. ''I was not going to engage in a bidding war,'' he said in an interview yesterday, ''but I made it clear that we'd be open to discussion, that there was always a nickel available to make things happen.''</p>
        <p>But by Sunday afternoon the deal had been signed.</p>
        <p>''I'm not mad. Anger doesn't figure into business decisions,'' Mr. David said. ''This would have been a good deal, but we have lots of alternatives.''</p>
        <p>So, of course, did G.E. ''We have studied Honeywell and about every other company in the world till the cows come home,'' a high-spirited Mr. Welch said in a telephone interview late Sunday afternoon.</p>
        <p>To hear him tell it, Honeywell was one of many companies he had planned to discuss with his successor as possible acquisition candidates. Still, with retirement so near, Mr. Welch, who is 64, said he had not planned to approach any of the companies himself. ''I was at the end of my game. I'd leased a new office in Connecticut. I was ready to start my new career,'' he said -- refusing, however, to say what that career would be.</p>
        <p>But while he was visiting the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday afternoon, word of the United Technologies deal leaked out, and a reporter asked him what he thought of it. ''I looked at the ticker, saw Honeywell was up $10 and almost fainted,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Welch, who was going to a white-tie benefit in New York later that night, said he tried to reach Lawrence A. Bossidy, Honeywell's former chairman and a close friend of Mr. Welch's, from a cab on the way. No luck.</p>
        <p>So on Friday morning, Mr. Welch learned the particulars of the United Technologies bid. He huddled with his investment bankers at Chase Manhattan; with James McNerney, head of GE Aircraft Engines, and with any G.E. board members he could reach. He then called Mr. Bonsignore himself.</p>
        <p>At first, Mr. Bonsignore's secretary refused to interrupt the Honeywell board meeting. ''I said, tell him we'll issue a press release in five minutes if they don't talk to me,' '' Mr. Welch recalled. Well, before that deadline, he and Mr. Bonsignore were on the phone.</p>
        <p>Mr. Welch said one of the conditions of the deal was that he stay on as chairman awhile longer, probably to ensure stability in the stock price. ''Their investment bankers made it clear that I had to stay,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Although Honeywell's product lines jibe almost as nicely with G.E.'s as they do with United Technologies, Honeywell's role as part of G.E. is expected to be radically different from what it would have been as part of United Technologies.</p>
        <p>United Technologies and Honeywell are roughly the same size, and that deal would have been a merger of equals. Although Mr. David would have run the merged entity, it would have borne the Honeywell name, and Mr. Bonsignore would have been its chairman. In addition, the combined company would have had a new headquarters.</p>
        <p>G.E., of course, is not changing its corporate name or its headquarters location in Fairfield, Conn. And while the Honeywell brand, which has tremendous force in the worlds of aircraft engines and home thermostats, will undoubtedly survive, perhaps as G.E.-Honeywell, its corporate name will not.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bonsignore and two other Honeywell executives will join G.E.'s board, but it is vitually certain that he will not be its chairman. His presence is unlikely to have much of an impact on G.E.'s well-laid succession plan, either. Mr. Bonsignore will be 60 in April, and Mr. Welch, who has run G.E. since 1981, has often said that he wanted his successor to have as long a run at the top as he did.</p>
        <p>Mr. Welch has already named three potential successors: Robert L. Nardelli, head of GE Power Systems; Jeffrey R. Immelt, head of GE Medical Systems; and Mr. McNerney, head of GE Aircraft Engines. Many analysts expect Mr. Immelt to prevail, but they say that the Honeywell merger makes it less likely that the also-rans will leave the company.</p>
        <p>This is not the way Mr. Bonsignore had expected the year to play out. In June 1999, when Honeywell and Allied Signal first announced that they would merge, Mr. Bonsignore promised that the company would bail out of ancillary businesses, cut $250 million in costs and increase earnings 20 percent this year. The company is on track with its cost cuts, and has either sold or is about to sell businesses in friction brakes, consumer automotive products and home security systems. It has also won more than $3 billion in new aircraft contracts this year. But last month, Honeywell warned investors that earnings growth would not exceed 12 percent this year, and its stock fell from the mid-50's to the mid-30's before the United Technologies talks.</p>
        <p>People close to Honeywell say that its board blamed the weak euro and soaring oil prices, not Mr. Bonsignore, for Honeywell's performance. And they say that reports of infighting between Honeywell and Allied Signal executives are untrue.</p>
        <p>Thus, these people said, Honeywell was never looking for a buyer. But, they said, G.E. made such a good offer that neither Mr. Bonsignore nor the board could turn it down.</p>
        <p>Analysts say the deal seems to be a winner for G.E., as well. Nicholas P. Heymann of Prudential Securities, predicts that buying Honeywell will add at least 4 cents a share to G.E.'s earnings next year.</p>
        <p>By law, the merged company cannot sell any major businesses for about two years after the deal closes. But Honeywell could still divest itself of smaller operations that it said it planned to sell before beginning  merger talks.</p>
        <p>Most of Honeywell's other businesses fit right into G.E.'s portfolio. G.E. is a major provider of commercial aircraft engines, and Honeywell makes engines for business jets. But Honeywell also makes auxiliary power units and aircraft instrumentation. And it has technology to upgrade air traffic control systems -- systems that the federal government has long said it needs to ease airline traffic congestion.</p>
        <p>''G.E. has the resources and strength to really jump-start this business,'' Mr. Heymann said.</p>
        <p>There are other complementary businesses. Both companies make plastics and chemicals and power generation systems, but the products are not identical. G.E. has a joint venture with Cisco that helps customers design manufacturing systems; Honeywell has manufacturing software and controls. Even Honeywell's home and building controls could fit in with G.E. appliances, in that it would enable G.E. to offer a much broader array of products for the home.</p>
        <p>Honeywell and G.E. have similar cultures as well. Both companies have adopted Six Sigma, a complex statistical method for quality control, and both have moved heavily into Internet sales.</p>
        <p>But G.E.'s track record is better. ''From a Honeywell bondholder's perspective, being bought by United Technologies would have been nice. But being bought by G.E. is like dying and going to bondholder heaven,'' said Carol Levenson, editor of Gimme Credit, a newsletter for institutional investors. ''The synergies or cost savings won't have as obvious an impact on a company the size of G.E., but then neither would any missteps along the way.''</p>
