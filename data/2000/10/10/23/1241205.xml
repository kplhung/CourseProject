        <p>Far from the gleaming steel canyons of Manhattan, where tirelessly urbane editors craft the magazines that entertain and inform the American public, the real heartbeat of the magazine industry beats in a squat office building, in a town on the banks of the Tennessee River, two hours' drive from Memphis.</p>
        <p>Manhattan may be the Emerald City of the magazine world, but the industry's Wizard of Oz -- Joel R. Anderson, chairman of the Anderson News Corporation -- keeps his office here on North Court Street, past the Magnolia Church of Christ, the Coon Dog Cemetery, Biscuit Village and the Guns 'n' Such store on the corner.</p>
        <p>''New York is far, far away,'' Mr. Anderson said, as he navigated the streets of Florence in his cherry-red Ford pickup. ''And I have spent enough time there to know how publishers and magazine folks get a distorted view of the country.''</p>
        <p>The magazine folks are not too happy with Mr. Anderson, either. In the last five years, Mr. Anderson -- a textbook Southern gentleman, who could have walked off the pages of a Walker Percy novel -- has emerged as one of the key players in the industry as his company, Anderson News, rose to become the nation's largest magazine wholesaler.</p>
        <p>Of every 10 magazines on a retail rack in the United States, Anderson delivers 4. If you want your publication at retail stores, you pretty much have to go to Anderson or three other companies, which deliver another 5.</p>
        <p>Mr. Anderson is a symbol of a swift consolidation that has left a battlefield littered with defunct wholesalers, both large and small. The consolidation has drawn the attention of the Justice Department's antitrust division and has created mounting, intense consternation among publishers, who say that they are finding it increasingly difficult and expensive to get their publications distributed, and are even attributing magazine closings to wholesalers. Earlier this year, magazine executives cited wholesaler consolidation as part of the reason for the deaths of Details, Mirabella and Life magazines.</p>
        <p>The newly concentrated power of the wholesalers is a humbling reminder to publishers that whatever their pretensions, they must fight for shelf space, just like Kleenex, canned hams and Iceberg lettuce in that most brutal arena where 44 percent of all magazines are now sold: supermarkets. There, in fact, magazines that do not sell are given the same shelf life as bananas and milk.</p>
        <p>Publishers are trying to adjust to the post-consolidation scenario. They are finding it harder to get their less successful titles onto those retail racks and wholesalers are demanding better deals from them. The Department of Justice investigation has begun to focus in recent months on the large wholesalers, in part to determine if there is any evidence of collusion between the players to keep their costs down, which would violate antitrust laws.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Anderson's take on the situation is as different from most of the publishers as the view from his front door is from the view on the 11th floor executive suites of the Conde Nast building in Times Square. And neither side seems to agree on what the solution is.</p>
        <p>Mr. Anderson, like other wholesalers, says he is being squeezed by the large retailers to offer more service and better prices. The wholesalers say they are finding that where their gross profit on each copy sold was once around 25 percent, it is now usually less than 20 percent.</p>
        <p>And too many magazines are being published for the dwindling retail racks available: there are about 4,700 titles now, as opposed to about 1,300 25 years ago, Mr. Anderson said. He said publishers are printing about 1.2 billion copies a year that go straight to shredders -- without ever seeing the fluorescent light of a retail store. They are known as ''premature returns'' because the retail outlets, pressed for rack space, will not even let them in the door, wasting the wholesalers resources.</p>
        <p>''You could say it is a bit of a mess right now,'' Mr. Anderson said of the entire distribution system, as he munched on a ham and melted cheese sandwich at The Emerald Coast Cafe in Florence.</p>
        <p>John Harrington, the publisher of the New Single Copy, a newsletter about magazine distribution, wrote in a report in July that the industry is ''on the verge of collapsing.''</p>
        <p>''The distribution system is now economically fragile,'' Mr. Harrington said last week. Mr. Harrington, who once headed the wholesalers' trade group, the Council for Periodical Distributors Association, said of the large wholesalers: ''These are the kinds of smart companies that at some point are going to say, 'Do I see a light at the end of the tunnel? Will we make money on this ever?' And if they do not, they will get out. And where will the industry be?''</p>
        <p>The major wholesalers all say they are losing money on magazine distribution. But they have the cushion of owning other profitable businesses. (The other major wholesalers are the News Group, which is operated by the Jim Pattison Group of Vancouver, British Columbia, with about 25 percent of the market; the Chas. Levy Circulating Company of Chicago, with about 17 percent; and the Hudson News Company of North Bergen, N.J., with about 10 percent.)</p>
        <p>The Anderson Corporation, a privately held company, has been in the periodical distribution business since it was founded in 1917. It also owns  Books-A-Million, the third largest bookstore chain in the United States, an entertainment novelty company, and the largest fireworks distribution company in the U.S. (Mr. Anderson has spent so much time in China, where the fireworks are manufactured, that he may be the only resident of Florence who can order ''a cold beer, please'' in Mandarin.) Anderson is a very closely held family business and keeps its officers in the family, too: Mr. Anderson's nephew, Charlie, is the chief executive of Anderson News Group.</p>
        <p>The wholesaler landscape, which scarcely changed from 1917 until the 1990's, underwent a swift transformation in 1995 that mirrored the consolidation among the major retail chains. Safeway announced that it would stop dealing with dozens of small wholesalers to supply its national chain, and preferred to deal with only one. The other big retailers, like Wal-Mart, followed suit, creating, the wholesalers argue, an intensely competitive environment in which companies battled each other to see who could offer the retailers the cheapest deal. Anderson, one of the bigger players, survived. In 1995, when there were about 180 wholesalers, Anderson had 6 percent of the market. Now, with only a handful of players, it has almost 40 percent.</p>
        <p>In turn, the wholesalers have gone back to the publishers to help them eat up some of the lost margins. But the publishers fear a squeeze on their own profit. And since the big retailers and the big wholesalers -- the two entities that control the retail flow of the majority of magazines to consumers -- focus on the blockbuster titles, like People, In Style or Good Housekeeping -- many smaller publishers have found themselves squeezed out of some popular spots.</p>
        <p>Mr. Anderson said that between pressure from retailers to deliver good deals and pressure from publishers to distribute too many titles too cheaply wholesalers are living in a non-profitable purgatory.</p>
        <p>''We went from a profitable to an unprofitable business,'' Mr. Anderson said. ''In order to recover our profitability we had two choices. We were not able to increase our gross margins, so we had to decrease our operating expenses.''</p>
        <p>This, he said, forced him to stop sending trucks to smaller retailers, like craft stores and out-of-the-way general stores.</p>
        <p>That move aggravated smaller publishers who depend on every sale they could get. And in an attempt to bolster their bottom lines, Anderson and the News Group instituted programs that have fired up even more controversy among the small publishers. In 1999, Anderson instituted a two-tiered system to distribute magazines.</p>
        <p>Anderson split its list of about 4,700 magazines -- into two parts. The top 1,700 titles, which represent about 97 percent of the company's sales, are handled through the company's network of nearly 50 full-scale distribution centers. The remaining titles, if they chose to stay with Anderson, would be remanded to less efficient facilities and charged additional handling fees.</p>
        <p>And last November, the News Group also started a program that separated core and non-core titles. The 1,400 titles that provided it with 94 percent of its sales revenue continue to receive distribution as usual. The other 1,600 titles could still be distributed by News Group but would require additional handling charges.</p>
        <p>Small publishers were angered by the plans. ''They really started to discriminate against our smaller colleagues,'' John R. MacArthur Jr., the publisher of Harper's magazine, said.</p>
        <p>Norman Jacobs, the president of the Century Publishing Company in Illinois, which publishes 10 small magazines like Cruise Travel, said that he canceled his contracts with Anderson, but recently renegotiated his agreement because there are so few wholesalers available with which to do business. Even after that, he said, it is just a ''break-even'' situation for his magazines on the Anderson racks.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Anderson said his room for profit is exceedingly slim. Most publishers, like Time Inc., Conde Nast or Hearst Magazines have an integrated national distributor arm -- like Time Distribution Services or COMAG, the company shared by Hearst and Conde Nast. Those companies sell magazines to the wholesalers at what is often around a 35 percent discount. They are shipped at the publisher's cost to the wholesaler's distribution depot. The wholesaler pays the national distributor, who in turn pays the publisher. With  a successful magazine like People, he said, he will only make 10 cents for every copy he handles -- even when the magazine is sold to the consumer for about $3.20. Even with a successful magazine like People, he still has to bear the cost of handling unsold 2.6 copies for each one sold.</p>
        <p>Still, that is profitable. The problems arise when the same discount applies to poorer-selling magazines that eat up his resources and on which he only make 2 cents per copy sold.</p>
        <p>''And that just don't work, hoss,'' he said, poised over a spread sheet in his office, a pencil tucked behind his ear.</p>
        <p>A key issue is that large publishers do not agree that they ought to give bigger discounts to wholesalers. Richard Jacobsen, the president of Time Inc.'s retail sales and marketing, said that the solution lies elsewhere.</p>
        <p>''Is it as simple as me giving him more margin?'' he asked. ''No. Is it about me trying to simplify the activities he has to perform better and at a lower cost, and we can do that together? Maybe. But whatever we do on the economic side has to be sustainable. It cannot be something that unravels again in two years.''</p>
        <p>Some publishers have considered hiring so-called ''category managers,'' who would monitor how many copies of Fortune, for example, sell best in which Wal-Mart, and who would cultivate close relationships with wholesalers.</p>
        <p>On his side, Mr. Anderson said he has tried other ways to get publishers to see the error of their ways. He sees all those extra copies that never get sold as a form of overblown institutional egomania.</p>
        <p>''The publishers are scared,'' he said. ''They see that guy printing this amount, and they figure, well, just in case, we ought to print as many. But what they do not realize is all that overprinting costs us in shipping and handling. And the magazines are just destroyed anyway.''</p>
        <p>His solution was to buy a La-Z-Boy recliner, and set it up in front of the Anderson shredder in Birmingham, where literally tons of magazines are shredded every day. ''And I called publishers in New York and I said, 'Want to come down and watch as we destroy tens of thousands of tons of your magazines?' ''</p>
        <p>He paused. ''Of course, none of them came,'' he said. ''As I said, New York is far away.''</p>
