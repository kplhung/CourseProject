        <p>Until this weekend, dozens of modern Greek paintings were propped against the walls, waiting to be hung at the new Onassis Cultural Center in the basement of Olympic Tower on Fifth Avenue.</p>
        <p>The art show opening tomorrow at the center is the first public foray of a new foundation -- an American affiliate of the Greek philanthropy  created under Aristotle Onassis' will with half the assets of his billion-dollar shipping empire.</p>
        <p>The foundation will be devoted to  promoting Hellenic culture in the United States. But it may also reflect another aspect of the Onassis legacy: a long-simmering feud between Mr. Onassis' Greek colleagues, who run the business and the foundations, and Thierry Roussel, the father of Mr. Onassis' only living descendant, 15-year-old Athina, who has been brought up in Switzerland. Athina, who has been estranged from her Greek heritage since her mother's death when she was 3, stands in line to head the Onassis foundation when she turns 21.</p>
        <p>The foundation's presence is already visible at Olympic Tower, between 51st and 52nd Streets -- part of the Onassis real estate holdings -- in the huge casts of the Elgin Marbles that are on display in the lobby. They are 150-year-old copies of some of the sculptures removed from the Parthenon in the first decade of the 1800's by the seventh Earl of Elgin, Thomas Bruce, and taken to the British Museum.</p>
        <p>''This is a good place for them,'' said Stelio Papadimitriou, president of both the Greek and American foundations, and of the Onassis business operations. ''You know, the Parthenon was in the agora, where people met, and this is a public space, an agora, for people to walk through in New York.''</p>
        <p>The art show in the new cultural center -- including 52 paintings and sculptures inspired by Greek antiquity -- is to run for three months, after which the center will hold lectures, concerts, screenings and readings.</p>
        <p>But the foundation's largest program will be outside New York: seminars on all aspects of Greek history and culture, to be conducted by visiting professors -- most of them Greek -- at dozens of colleges and universities nationwide.</p>
        <p>''Many universities are interested, including Brown University and Johns Hopkins,'' Mr. Papadimitriou said. ''In the past, in the parent foundation, we endowed chairs in Greek studies at New York University and other universities. But we decided not to do that anymore. This will let us be in more places.''</p>
        <p>Precisely how much money the foundation will spend remains unclear.</p>
        <p>''The American foundation will not have its own endowment, but the parent foundation has made a commitment to funding these programs,'' Mr. Papadimitriou said. ''We don't know exactly how much it will be, but we expect to spend about $2 million next year.''</p>
        <p>When Mr. Onassis died in 1975, he left half his estate to his daughter, Christina, and half to the Alexander S. Onassis Public Benefit Foundation, named after a son killed in a plane crash two years earlier. That foundation is among the largest in Europe, using its assets to create scholarship and prize programs, build the $75 million Onassis Cardiac Surgery Center in Athens, endow Greek studies chairs at universities in the United States and elsewhere, and support dozens of other projects.</p>
        <p>Christina Onassis was the first president of the foundation, with Mr. Papadimitriou and others in her father's business circle serving as trustees. Ms. Onassis died in 1988, a year after her divorce from Mr. Roussel, her fourth husband.</p>
        <p>Ever since, Mr. Papadimitriou and the other trustees have been involved in legal wrangling with Mr. Roussel over control of the fortune, and the upbringing of Athina, who has spent almost no time in Greece since her mother died. Their mudslinging has been fodder for tabloids around the world, with suits and countersuits, charges of embezzlement, attempted kidnapping and constant battles over the money.</p>
        <p>Mr. Papadimitriou has been in the thick of it, as head of the business and the foundation and an executor of Ms. Onassis' will.</p>
        <p>When Ms. Onassis died, she left her estate to Athina, to be administered by a five-person group including Mr. Roussel, Mr. Papadimitriou and three other Onassis trustees. But because the group was run by majority vote, Mr. Roussel found himself powerless, and sued, unsuccessfully, for control of his daughter's inheritance. After that action failed, Mr. Papadimitriou said, they reached an agreement under which the trustees would pay Mr. Roussel $12 million a year, and he, in turn, would see that his daughter learned Greek and resume relations with her mother's family, from whom she had become estranged.</p>
        <p>But that did not happen, Mr. Papadimitriou said, and the disputes increased. He and the trustees, who had insured the girl against kidnapping and ransom demands, became convinced that she was vulnerable; in 1997 they hired surveillance agents to investigate her security, and Swiss authorities arrested two of the agents on charges of attempted kidnapping.</p>
        <p>Last year, acknowledging the long hostilities, a Swiss court ordered the accounting firm KPMG to take over management of the assets. In the proceedings, Athina testified that she wanted nothing to do with the Greek trustees.</p>
        <p>''I don't mind that she doesn't want to see me,'' Mr. Papadimitriou said, but added that he regrets she is not in touch with her mother's Greek relatives including her godfather.  ''And she said she hates anything that is Greek.''</p>
        <p>Athina is to inherit her mother's fortune when she turns 18. When she turns 21, she becomes eligible to become president of the foundation. But further legal battles seem likely, since Mr. Papadimitriou is quick to express his sense that she has not been raised to be a competent money manager.</p>
        <p>''She claims she will have the foundation,'' he said. ''But the bylaws say the descendant must be able and willing to serve, and I think it is up the trustees to decide who is capable of serving.''</p>
