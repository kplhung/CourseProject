        <p>Hillary Rodham Clinton's campaign released a new 30-second advertisement this weekend that began running statewide on Saturday.</p>
        <p>PRODUCER -- Team Hillary</p>
        <p>TITLE -- ''The Facts''</p>
        <p>ON THE SCREEN -- The commercial, which opens with a simple text display reading ''More Attacks From Rick Lazio,'' quickly switches to a split scene featuring a blurry, slow-motion video of Mr. Lazio speaking on one side and Mrs. Clinton's own attacks on her opponent written out on the other side.</p>
        <p>THE SCRIPT -- ''More attacks from Rick Lazio. Here are the facts. Since Labor Day, Rick Lazio had the second-worst voting record in the whole Congress. He skipped 78 of the last 82 votes. And it's Lazio's plans that will squander the surplus. Hillary's plan cuts taxes and pays down the debt. Lazio voted with Gingrich to cut $24 billion from New York's hospitals, against guaranteed prescription drug coverage under Medicare. Hillary's fighting for quality health care for all. It's time to stop the attacks and stick to the facts.''</p>
        <p>ACCURACY -- Mr. Lazio has missed most of the House votes since Labor Day, but before his entry into the Senate race, he had a better than average attendance record, participating in 99 percent of the votes last year, according to Congressional Quarterly. Mr. Lazio did vote with other Republicans in 1995 to reduce the rate of growth in Medicare spending, which would translate into less money than expected, but not a cut, for New York hospitals. Earlier this year, Mr. Lazio voted in favor of a bill that would provide drug coverage to the elderly through private insurance companies. Mrs. Clinton supported a more extensive federal program.</p>
        <p>SCORECARD -- Mrs. Clinton's newest commercial is nothing snazzy, but it covers a lot of ground quickly, attacking Mr. Lazio on many of the campaign's central issues and repeating some of her favorite themes, such as her frequent refrain that Mr. Lazio was beholden to Newt Gingrich when he was House speaker. The spot clearly serves as Mrs. Clinton's return volley in what in the last week has become a bitter back-and-forth between the two candidates, as they churn out aggressive, old-fashioned attack ads. Given that Election Day is now only two weeks away, such a turn is not surprising. But for now, the two candidates are at least focused on issues that voters care about, like taxes and health care, instead of on personalities. The one possible problem is that with their competing and conflicting claims and criticism, the candidates risk leaving voters confused about exactly what they do or do not stand for.</p>
