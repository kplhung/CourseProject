        <p>Two recent polls of the presidential preferences of information technology professionals provide some provocatively conflicting data.</p>
        <p>Geeks prefer Al Gore, according to the latest weekly results at www.metricnet.com, an information technology research site created by Howard Rubin, a consultant in Pound Ridge, N.Y.</p>
        <p>But people more likely to be the geeks' bosses seem to prefer the Bush ticket, according to a survey by CIO magazine. (CIO's name is the abbreviation for chief information officer.)</p>
        <p>Metricnet's registered audience consists mostly of information technology managers and high-level programmers, Mr. Rubin said. Among the 14,500 of them voting in the survey in the last week, the Vice President was favored over Gov. George W. Bush by a 50 percent to 38 percent margin. And, in contrast to national polls of the general public which show Mr. Bush inching past Mr. Gore, the margin for Mr. Gore has been widening this month in the Metricnet poll.</p>
        <p>But it appears to be a case of same universe, different planet for information technology executives who attended a recent symposium sponsored by CIO magazine. CIO found that 48 percent of the 210 executives at its gathering last week in Phoenix said they intended to vote for the Bush-Cheney ticket compared to just 37 percent for Gore-Lieberman.</p>
        <p>The CIO group favors Mr. Bush by a wide margin, but they gave a slight edge -- 41 percent to 38 percent -- to the Gore team as ''best suited to lead the new economy,'' said Karen Fogerty, spokeswoman for CXO Media, the unit of International Data Group that publishes CIO.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rubin said that Mr. Gore has led in the Metricnet poll ever since it began in March, although his lead narrowed to a few points in August before widening again. About 217,000 votes have been recorded. However, because each is irrevocable, the trend lines reflect only new votes, and make no provision for people who might have changed their minds.</p>
        <p>Education reform has consistently been the top public issue for those in the information technology world, according to Mr. Rubin's polling. The biggest shift in recent weeks on issues directly related to information technology has been a sharp increase in concerns about Internet privacy and security.</p>
