        <p>There is no way to identify the world's best bridge teacher, but there are some necessary requirements. Obviously he or she must be able to project effectively to a large group and explain the concepts involved.</p>

        <p>There is no way to identify the world's best bridge teacher, but there are some necessary requirements. Obviously he or she must be able to project effectively to a large group and explain the concepts involved.</p>
        <p>Less obviously, the teacher must be a player of the highest class, able to impart the subtleties of the game in simple terms.</p>
        <p>A strong candidate for the title is Eddie Kantar, a former world champion who has been teaching, writing and playing for more than half a century. The latest of his many books is ''Kantar Lessons IV,'' which this summer won the American Bridge Teachers Award for the best book of the year. It is ideal for the moderate player who wishes to improve, and it is available from the author for $25 including mailing, at 2700 Neilson Way, No. 334, Santa Monica, Calif. 90405.</p>
        <p>The diagramed deal from the book illustrates a defensive position in which inexperienced players almost always go astray. South overbids a little to get to four spades. An invitational bid of three diamonds reaches the same contract because the North hand is highly suitable.</p>
        <p>The defense begins with three rounds of clubs, and South ruffs low. He has noted that West has led the two, which is the modern choice with three small cards, and knows that he will not be overruffed. The old-fashioned top-of-nothing would give less away.</p>
        <p>South cashes the spade ace and sets about ruffing diamonds. He leads to the ace and plays the eight, putting East to the test. An inexperienced player eagerly ruffs, seizing the opportunity to take a cheap trick, and allows the game to make. South will be able to draw another round of trump and ruff his remaining diamond loser.</p>
        <p>A good player understands that ruffing a loser in this sort of situation is nearly always an error. Discarding defeats the contract, because East will be able to overruff dummy twice if South attempts to ruff his losers.</p>
        <p>Kantar has a pithy way of expressing this concept: ''Don't ruff air,'' he advises.</p>
