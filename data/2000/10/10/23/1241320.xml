        <p>Todd Zeile could not believe his sixth-inning drive in Game 1 on Saturday bounced off the top of the left-field wall and stayed in play. Zeile pumped his fist as if he had homered before realizing that the ball did not go out. He got a double, but Timo Perez was thrown out trying to score from first base after slowing down near second base. Zeile could not help but recall another infamous moment in Stadium history.</p>

        <p>''Where was Jeffrey Maier when you need him?'' Zeile said.</p>
        <p>Zeile played for the Orioles when Maier, then 12, reached over the right-field wall and turned a deep fly into a homer in the 1996 American League Championship Series.</p>
