        <p>Eager to demonstrate a get-tough attitude toward Israel while keeping the door ajar to a resumption of peace talks, Arab leaders said today that they would freeze all but formal diplomatic contact with Israel until it made tangible progress toward a final settlement with the Palestinians.</p>
        <p>In a strongly worded but carefully calibrated statement signed by all but one of the 22 members of the Arab League, the leaders accused Israel of committing atrocities in the last three weeks of clashes with Palestinians. They urged the United Nations to set up a war crimes tribunal to judge Israeli actions and pledged vast aid to relieve the battered Palestinian economy.</p>

        <p>Eager to demonstrate a get-tough attitude toward Israel while keeping the door ajar to a resumption of peace talks, Arab leaders said today that they would freeze all but formal diplomatic contact with Israel until it made tangible progress toward a final settlement with the Palestinians.</p>
        <p>In a strongly worded but carefully calibrated statement signed by all but one of the 22 members of the Arab League, the leaders accused Israel of committing atrocities in the last three weeks of clashes with Palestinians. They urged the United Nations to set up a war crimes tribunal to judge Israeli actions and pledged vast aid to relieve the battered Palestinian economy.</p>
        <p>But they stopped well short of renouncing the peace treaties that Egypt and Jordan have already signed with Israel and did not suggest that the Palestinians themselves reject further negotiations in pursuit of an independent state.</p>
        <p>Instead, the Arab League -- which at its first summit meeting in four years was under scrutiny from the Palestinians and their supporters throughout the Arab world -- said it would end its participation in all official and unofficial efforts to integrate Israel into the economy of the Middle East.</p>
        <p>The low-level diplomatic contacts that have started in the last few years between Arab countries and Israel, including trade and political exchanges, are to be suspended.</p>
        <p>As violence continued in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, leaving at least four more Palestinians dead, Prime Minister Ehud Barak formally declared a ''timeout'' from the peace effort, though it is unclear exactly how that will change a situation in which daily clashes have already suspended any movement toward peace. [Page A12.]</p>
        <p>''We are not going to let Israel do whatever it wants,'' Foreign Minister Amr Mousa of Egypt declared, speaking to reporters. ''We have all this pressure on us, telling us that Israel needs to feel a part of the region. Well, if it wants to be part of the region, it has to act according to the law.''</p>
        <p>The statement from the meeting did not directly criticize the United States for supporting Israel, as the leaders had in their public speeches. But it took a swipe at Washington, insisting that Jerusalem should not be recognized as the capital of Israel.</p>
        <p>President Clinton said in July that he might consider moving the United States Embassy from Tel Aviv, where most countries have their diplomatic representation, to Jerusalem. The Arab leaders said they would break relations with any country that did so before negotiations resolved Jerusalem's status as a disputed city.</p>
        <p>The Arab leaders seemed conscious that this summit meeting was a test of credibility for the Arab League, which in its 55-year history has been fractured, uniting most easily over the treatment of the Palestinians. Mr. Mousa, acting as an unofficial spokesman for the leaders gathered here, took care to underline that Arab governments were not indifferent to the anger in their streets at Israeli conduct.</p>
        <p>Libya proclaimed itself the voice of stifled Arab masses yearning for a complete break with Israel. Its delegates walked out of the meeting a few hours after it convened on Saturday, dismissing the Arab League deliberations as an oratorical exercise that would merely result in empty threats to Israel.</p>
        <p>Arab leaders generally regard Libya and its leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, as a perpetually maverick element in their midst, but they clearly feared that their meeting might be perceived in much the same terms by their own people.</p>
        <p>In the Arab world, public preoccupation with the bloodshed in the Palestinian territories -- in which more than 120 people have died, all but 8 of them Arabs -- has set off mass demonstrations and open calls for war. Many commentators on Arabic television and in newspapers have speculated that the protests could turn against authoritarian Arab governments.</p>
        <p>Again and again, Mr. Mousa found himself on the defensive when confronted by Arab journalists, who repeatedly questioned whether the Arab League was truly in touch with the public mood and would follow through on its promises.</p>
        <p>''We -- all of us here -- are part of the Arab public,'' he responded, adding that ''all Arabs -- left, right and center and whoever represents them, whether governments, the street or students -- are angry.''</p>
        <p>''We mean business here,'' Mr. Mousa declared.</p>
        <p>Immediately after the meeting, Tunisia announced that it would shut its political liaison office in Tel Aviv and close the corresponding Israeli office in Tunis. A government statement said the break was a response to ''bloody Israeli aggression against the fraternal Palestinian people.''</p>
        <p>Oman has already closed a small Israeli trade office that was operating in its capital. Qatar, said today that it would ''calmly'' consider the possibility of closing the Israeli trade office in its capital. Morocco has a junior diplomat still stationed in Tel Aviv.</p>
        <p>The Arab leaders, who have unanimously backed the Palestinian demand for Arab sovereignty over East Jerusalem, also noted that Jerusalem's status was internationally acknowledged as a subject for negotiation. As a group, the leaders also said they would boycott any official or unofficial gatherings with Israeli on regional economic cooperation. That freeze is likely to have more of a political than a practical effect, since Syria and Lebanon have boycotted such meetings ever since they were initiated after the Madrid peace conference in 1991 and the talks have been infrequent.</p>
        <p>It is not clear if Arab nations will avoid going to international gatherings attended by Israel, like economic development conferences sponsored by the European Union.</p>
        <p>The Cairo gathering, the first Arab League summit meeting in a decade to include Iraq, brought together the divergent trends in the Arab world. Persian Gulf kings and princes, wearing long white robes and gilt-edged gauzy cloaks, mingled with Arab presidents in business suits.</p>
        <p>But their old divisions were not healed. Representatives of Kuwait and Saudi Arabia refused even to make eye contact with delegates from Iraq, which was banished from Arab League summit conferences after its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.</p>
        <p>The Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, in his trademark military uniform, looked drawn and shrunken, far from the lively and excitable figure he once cut at Arab meetings. During the televised speeches, he frequently appeared detached, and when the leaders gathered between sessions to chat and embrace, he was often seen standing alone.</p>
        <p>While Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip may have been dissatisfied by the response to their uprising, Mr. Arafat could, to a certain extent, take the meeting as a sign that he was back in the Arab fold.</p>
        <p>He had lost the financial support of the Gulf nations after he backed Iraq in the Gulf war. With their own people supporting the Palestinians very publicly, Arab leaders decided to offer Mr. Arafat their full political support and promised $1 billion in aid to protect Islamic and Arab properties in Jerusalem and to help the families of Palestinians killed or wounded in the fighting with Israel.</p>
        <p>The session provided a glimpse of the shape of future disputes among the Arab leaders. Iraq and Syria, using different language, urged the Arab states to develop a long-term strategy that would approach Israel as a rival military and economic power.</p>
        <p>The young Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, revived a perennial theme: that only by combining their financial and military power could the Arabs forge what he called a ''peace of the strong'' rather than a peace founded on the perceived weakness of Arab nations. Taking a different tack, Iraq proposed a vision of the Arab world that would reject alliances with the United States.</p>
        <p>As things stand, Egypt, which commands the strongest military in the Arab world, maintains close ties with the United States, Israel's leading ally, and conducts joint military exercises with American troops.</p>
        <p>Most of the Persian Gulf states also have military cooperation agreements with the United States. The oil weapon, used to squeeze the West after the 1973 Arab-Israeli war, has been disavowed by Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, which are close American allies.</p>
        <p>A few of the Arab leaders, notably the young kings of Morocco and Jordan, took note of the changed circumstances. They argued that military consolidation was outdated, that the world around the Middle East had organized itself into common markets and that the Arabs should concentrate on competing economically and technologically.</p>
        <p>This summit declaration went a few steps further than the statement agreed on after the last meeting of Arab heads of state, in 1996. Convened after the election of the rightist Benjamin Netanyahu as prime minister of Israel, the Arab leaders then warned Israel that they would adjust the pace of normalizing relations according to progress in the peace talks.</p>
        <p>The public theme of this meeting was that peace negotiations, in the form in which they have been conducted since the Oslo agreement in 1993, was no longer valid. Mr. Mousa dismissed Israel's peacemaking activity as little more than ''shuttling to Washington and photo opportunities.''</p>
