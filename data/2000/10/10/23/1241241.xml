        <p>It's not an age-old question. It's certainly not as urgent to the five boroughs as which team is going to win the Subway Series. But it matters to anyone who follows college football: what constitutes a Heisman Trophy winner?</p>
        <p>It's an especially important question now that the Bowl Championship Series rankings -- the season's first  will be released today -- have taken the fun out of arguing over which team is the best in the nation.</p>
        <p>The leaves the Heisman Trophy race as the topic that can rouse the most passionate college football devotees. And who is better to ask what constitutes the stuff of Heisman winners than the player who may be the front-runner, Virginia Tech quarterback Michael Vick?</p>
        <p>''Sometimes I think it's who has the most impressive statistics,'' Vick said. ''Sometimes I think it's who wins the most games. I really don't know what to say.''</p>
        <p>Exactly. No one from Silicon Valley to Silicon Alley has come up with a computer program to quantify what makes someone the best college football player in the nation for a particular season. In the past decade, voters have selected three players who were considered vital to the team that captured all or part of the championship -- quarterbacks Charlie Ward of Florida State in 1993 and Danny Wuerffel of Florida in 1996 and defensive back Charles Woodson of Michigan in 1997. Otherwise, they opted for light-them-up numbers or record-topplers: Brigham Young quarterback Ty Detmer in 1990, Miami quarterback Gino Torretta in 1992, and running backs Rashaan Salaam of Colorado in 1994, Eddie George of Ohio State in 1995, Ricky Williams of Texas in 1998 and Ron Dayne of Wisconsin last year.</p>
        <p>Only one winner did not quite fit in either category, wide receiver Desmond Howard of Michigan (1991). Between graceful pass catching and electrifying kick returns, Howard pioneered the candidacy of the highlight reel, which was capitalized on by Woodson, his fellow Wolverine.</p>
        <p>Just like this college football season, the 2000 Heisman Trophy race is wide open, with six solid candidates still in the running. But only one running back remains: LaDainian Tomlinson of Texas Christian University. In 1938, quarterback Davey O'Brien won the Heisman and led T.C.U. to the national title, and the Horned Frogs (6-0, No. 11 in the Associated Press poll) are experiencing their best start since then.</p>
        <p>They won't win the championship, however, and Tomlinson won't win the Heisman. The Western Athletic Conference doesn't have the majesty of the old Southwest Conference. Although Tomlinson's numbers are exceptional -- 1,093 yards on 195 carries -- he gained 119 yards on 27 carries on Saturday against Tulsa, which had the fifth-worst rushing defense in the country.</p>
        <p>''I said to you guys all along that there would be games like this,'' Tomlinson said. ''I don't go out to win the Heisman Trophy. I go out to win games.''</p>
        <p>This is a quarterback's year. One Heisman candidate, Chris Weinke of Florida State, is a statistical monster. The other four -- Eric Crouch of Nebraska, Josh Heupel of Oklahoma, Woodrow Dantzler of Clemson and, of course, Vick -- have a chance to lead their teams to undefeated seasons.</p>
        <p>This Saturday, Heupel or Crouch will knock the other out of contention as the Sooners (No. 3 A.P. and No. 1 in the Times computer ranking) and Cornhuskers (No. 1 A.P., No. 4 Times) meet in Norman, Okla. Like Vick last year, Heupel is being discovered late in the season after leading Oklahoma to a surprising 6-0 start. He has completed a nation-leading 68.5 percent of his passes for 1,894 yards and 11 touchdowns, with only 4 interceptions. He has also run for five scores.</p>
        <p>Crouch is an option quarterback who has run for 11 touchdowns and thrown for another 9. What he lacks in gaudy numbers, he makes up for in defining moments. When Nebraska (7-0) was pushed into overtime by Notre Dame, Crouch connected on a key third-down pass to set up his game-winning run.</p>
        <p>Weinke and Dantzler are heading for a Heisman Trophy showdown when they face each other Nov. 4. If this were politics, Weinke, the Florida State quarterback, could count on votes from senior citizens. He is 28 years old, and it is uncertain how Heisman voters will weigh his age against his staggering 2,791 yards and 22 touchdowns. With a loss to Miami in the books, Weinke and Florida State (No. 6 A.P., No. 5 Times) need a victory over Clemson to keep both trophy and national title hopes alive.</p>
        <p>Until Dantzler bruised his left ankle and was removed in the second quarter Saturday against North Carolina, he was piling up numbers that were largely responsible for the 8-0 start by the Tigers (No. 5 A.P., No. 11 Times). He has passed for 1,339 yards and 9 touchdowns against 4 interceptions, and run for 841 yards and 12 touchdowns. Now injury and Weinke stand in his way.</p>
        <p>That leaves Vick. His numbers aren't spectacular, especially after he was held to 84 yards of total offense by a Syracuse defense that was intent on stopping him. Vick has thrown for 943 yards and 7 touchdowns but has 4 interceptions. He has run for 550 yards and another 8 scores, but he has had some costly fumbles.</p>
        <p>Still, Virginia Tech is 7-0, and Vick is without peer in the highlight-reel-friendly category. He showed so again on Saturday when, after absorbing a pounding from the Orangemen for 58 minutes, he broke a seemingly effortless 55-yard touchdown run with 1 minute 34 seconds to play to seal a Hokies victory.</p>
        <p>Virginia Tech (No. 2 A.P. and Times) has a road game remaining with Miami (No. 4 A.P., No. 3 Times) that will decide the Big East title, and may very well be a playoff for a spot in the national championship game. In the end, the Heisman Trophy will most likely belong to the last undefeated quarterback standing -- whether it's Vick or Dantzler or Crouch or Heupel.</p>
