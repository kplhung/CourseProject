        <p>GEORGE W. BUSH  Remarks yesterday at a rally in Austin with 28 Republican governors:</p>
        <p>''Some campaigns tend to send out spokespeople. I'm sending out examples, examples of people who know how to lead; examples of people who have solved problems; examples of people who have made public education the No. 1 priority in their states, and as a result the children are better off; people who have rejected the old-line divisions that have tended to dominate the political scene; people who have said loud and clear, 'Judge me on results, not on the process.'</p>

        <p>GEORGE W. BUSH  Remarks yesterday at a rally in Austin with 28 Republican governors:</p>
        <p>''Some campaigns tend to send out spokespeople. I'm sending out examples, examples of people who know how to lead; examples of people who have solved problems; examples of people who have made public education the No. 1 priority in their states, and as a result the children are better off; people who have rejected the old-line divisions that have tended to dominate the political scene; people who have said loud and clear, 'Judge me on results, not on the process.'</p>
        <p>Let's look at the results. Oh, I'm proud to be standing here on this stage with this team of warriors on our behalf. This is what government ought to be about in Washington. These good folks represent a hopeful approach to government, a can-do conservatism that trusts people, that empowers people to make decisions, that says government ought to be limited and focused, that we're going to help people help themselves, but government isn't going to be all things to all people.</p>
        <p>These are leaders, executive leaders. They know how to set agendas and goals and bring people together to achieve those goals.</p>
        <p>I've made a lot of proposals, but I've got three great goals for Washington. One is, every child should be educated. And we're going to put federal education firmly on the side of education reform. Secondly is to have a sound fiscal approach to the budget, to set priorities -- each governor up here has had to set priorities -- and then, when we have money left over, enact tax relief and tax reform.</p>
        <p>And thirdly, reform Social Security and Medicare, to once and for all end Washington of the politics of frightening people into the voting booth, to get rid of this.</p>
        <p>One of our messages, the collective message of all of us on this stage, is that the Clinton-Gore administration has been the chief obstacle to reform in America. They block education reform at every turn. There's been no innovation, no flexibility to states and local jurisdictions, no accountability. They're locked into the failed ideas of the past.''</p>
