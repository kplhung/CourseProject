        <p>Vojislav Kostunica today made the first visit to Sarajevo by a Yugoslav head of state since war broke out here eight years ago, hastily starting a dialogue of peace to soften what many see as his support for Serbian nationalism.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kostunica had planned today's journey to Trebinje, high in the mountains that divide Bosnia from Montenegro, as a personal and symbolic pilgrimage to honor Jovan Ducic, a Serbian poet and diplomat born here and reburied with great pomp today, 57 years after he died in the United States.</p>
        <p>But the trip to the Serb-ruled part of Bosnia, where many inhabitants still hope to rejoin neighboring Yugoslavia, quickly turned into a highly political act, threatening to raise tensions barely two weeks after a popular uprising swept Mr. Kostunica, the elected president, into power in place of Slobodan Milosevic.</p>
        <p>Mr. Milosevic has long been seen as a fulcrum of the Balkan wars of the past decade, and the instigator of the Serb attack on independent Bosnia that set off a war that claimed an estimated 200,000 lives and drove some 2 million of Bosnia's 4.3 million inhabitants from their homes.</p>
        <p>Under pressure from international officials in charge of Bosnia, Mr. Kostunica flew to the Bosnian capital, Sarajevo, for a short meeting at the airport with Bosnian officials after attending the emotional and patriotic reburial of Mr. Ducic.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kostunica did not venture into Sarajevo itself, a city which was bombarded and besieged by the Bosnian Serbs throughout the war, restricting himself to meeting at Sarajevo airport with Bosnian Croat officials and the Muslim and Serb members of the tripartite presidency that runs the still deeply divided country. He said afterward, ''I would say we are opening a new page in relations.''</p>
        <p>The immediate goal was to discuss the resumption of diplomatic relations between Bosnia and Yugoslavia, although according to Halid Genjac, the Muslim member of the presidency, talks did not go very far, Reuters reported from Sarajevo.</p>
        <p>Asked if he would apologize for Serbian actions during the war, Mr. Kostunica reiterated his stance that everyone's actions should be examined and that ''one-sided statements'' would not solve anything.</p>
        <p>''I am one of those politicians who will not use empty words, empty promises and empty apologies to in some way overcome all the complications of our relations,'' Reuters quoted him as saying. ''With all that has happened, all the crimes that were carried out and the victims there were on all sides, all this can be cured only by the truth.''</p>
        <p>''We need a return of confidence, an examination of all that happened a few years ago and maybe a few decades ago,'' Mr. Kostunica added, alluding apparently to the World War II feuds and killings that helped stoke the disputes and wars of the 1980's and 90's.</p>
        <p>In a significant change from previous comments, Mr. Kostunica indicated that he would cooperate with the war crimes tribunal at The Hague, which has indicted high-level Serbian officials and generals for their actions in Bosnia and, for his actions in Kosovo, Mr. Milosevic.</p>
        <p>''When it comes to The Hague tribunal, we know it is a part of the Dayton accord and there are elements of it which can and must be implemented and we will take certain steps in that direction,'' Mr. Kostunica said, referring to the peace accords that ended the Bosnian war and divided the country into the Muslim-Croat Federation and the Serb Republic.</p>
        <p>Mr. Milosevic visited Bosnia only once during the war, in 1993, when he urged the Bosnian Serbs to accept an international peace settlement which they rejected.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kostunica, a lawyer who espouses Serbian patriotism but has criticized ethnic cleansing and the paramilitaries involved in it, was apparently determined to attend the reburial of Mr. Ducic, despite the evident concern of foreign diplomats who effectively administer Bosnia.</p>
        <p>Jacques Klein, a retired American general who heads the United Nations mission to Bosnia, flew personally to take Mr. Kostunica to Sarajevo. He called the trip a brave one on Mr. Kostunica's part, considering the Yugoslav president is still grappling with the supporters of Mr. Milosevic.</p>
        <p>''Kostunica deserves great credit. His advisers probably would have said, 'Don't do this. It's going to cause you problems in Belgrade,' '' Mr. Klein said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kostunica was applauded by hundreds of bystanders as he arrived at the newly-built Church of the Annunciation, where Mr. Ducic was to be buried.</p>
        <p>''Long life, Mr. President,'' said one onlooker. Following dozens of Serb Orthodox priests in colored robes and glittering miters, Mr. Kostunica accompanied Bosnian Serb politicians around the church and inside for an hours-long service. Beside him stood his host, Mirko Sarovic, vice president of the Serb Republic and a leader of the nationalist Serbian Democratic Party.</p>
        <p>''It's a private visit, but it is turning into a public occasion,'' said Vladeta Jankovic, a leading adviser to Mr. Kostunica. ''People tend to see this as a provocation, which it isn't.''</p>
        <p>''This is certainly not meant to be a demonstration of Serb nationalism and that is why he is going to Sarajevo.'' Mr. Kostunica's visit to Trebinje had been planned long before he had even thought of running for president, Mr. Jankovic said.</p>
        <p>But many Serbs attending saw it as an important political moment. ''All these people are from Serbia and for us the border does not exist. Of course, I want this to become part of Yugoslavia, and not Bosnia,'' said Nikola Miljanovic, a businessman.</p>
        <p>This open desire to change Bosnia's borders alarms the Muslim and Croat inhabitants of Bosnia, many of whom suffered at the hands of Serbian forces during the war. In Trebinje, as in many other places, the Muslims were expelled and their mosques destroyed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kostunica did not speak at Trebinje and bore an expression of detachment as he stood listening to the speeches and sermons. The occasion was replete with the kind of religious and patriotic symbols that nationalist Bosnian Serb leaders made their hallmark during the 1992-1995 war.</p>
        <p>A popular Serbian poet, Matija Beckovic, spoke of the miracle that had brought the body of Mr. Ducic back to Trebinje at the very moment that Serbia found freedom and democracy under Mr. Kostunica, who defeated Mr. Milosevic in elections on Sept. 24. His speech won applause at almost every sentence.</p>
        <p>The Church of the Annunciation was paid for by a Serb living in Chicago, and is designed as a smaller version of the Serbian Orthodox monastery at Gracanica in Kosovo.</p>
