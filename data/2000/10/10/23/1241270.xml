        <p>Even after absorbing three debates and months of campaigning, American voters are thoroughly ambivalent about their choices for president, still vexed by doubts about Vice President Al Gore's sincerity and Gov. George W. Bush's preparedness for the White House, the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll shows.</p>
        <p>While the survey found that voters viewed Mr. Gore as more caring, closer to them on issues and generally more capable than Mr. Bush, they did not fully embrace him. Many perceive that Mr. Gore is too smart for his own good and that in the debates he spent too much time showing off his knowledge and not enough talking about his personal side.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush helped his candidacy in the debates, the poll shows, but still inspires discomfort. Nearly half of those surveyed said he was ill prepared for the presidency, and they voiced particular doubts about his ability to navigate international crises like the one in the Middle East. Most respondents said Mr. Bush would hand off responsibilities of such crises to his advisers, while Mr. Gore would be personally involved.</p>
        <p>Perhaps because of these lingering reservations, neither candidate has established an appreciable edge 15 days before the election in what has become the closest presidential contest since 1980, and 1960 before that. Among likely voters, Mr. Bush draws 44 percent, with 42 percent for Mr. Gore. Ralph Nader is supported by 4 percent of the likely voters, and Patrick J. Buchanan just 1 percent.</p>
        <p>The nationwide telephone poll of 1,010 registered voters was conducted Oct. 18 to Oct. 21. It has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points, leaving Mr. Bush's edge statistically insignificant.</p>
        <p>The gap between Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore has narrowed day by day. The more time that passed from the final debate, which was last Tuesday, the more people seemed to like Mr. Gore. Mr. Bush's widest margin was on Wednesday, the first day of the poll.</p>
        <p>By the last two days of the four-day poll, Mr. Gore had a bare edge over Mr. Bush. That movement is another manifestation of how the support for both candidates is fluid -- and how extraordinarily competitive the race is.</p>
        <p>While the national numbers are critical in helping to explain the overall dynamic of the race -- and pinpointing the candidates' strengths and vulnerabilities -- the election will be won or lost on who piles up the most victories, and electoral votes, in  swing states. Polls in several states found that neither candidate has a commanding lead in electoral votes.</p>
        <p>There are signs that the seesaw nature of the race has stirred interest in the campaign. Sixty percent of those surveyed said they would describe the campaign as interesting.</p>
        <p>Even with the slight day-to-day upticks for Mr. Gore, there are several signs that Mr. Bush benefited more from the televised debates. Voters surveyed were slightly more likely to say the debates made them feel better about a Bush presidency than a Gore presidency.</p>
        <p>Before the first debate, voters said they expected Mr. Gore to win the election. Now, by a slight margin, they expect Mr. Bush to win. More than half of the respondents said Mr. Bush was spending more time explaining what he would do as president than attacking Mr. Gore. Before the first debate, fewer than half said that of the governor.</p>
        <p>The voters surveyed were split over whether anything from the debates had helped them settle on a candidate. More than eight out of 10 voters surveyed said they had learned nothing from the debates that led them to change their minds about whom to support.</p>
        <p>The survey also shed light on the roughly 8 percent of voters who say they have not decided. They are a diverse lot and are not leaning more toward one candidate or another. Nine percent of women are undecided, as are 6 percent of men. Voters who came of age during the Reagan administration, who are now in the 30 to 44 age group, account for the most undecided voters of all age groups, 11 percent. Seven percent of people who live in the suburbs have not decided, nor have 5 percent of Republicans, 7 percent of Democrats and 10 percent of independents.</p>
        <p>In follow-up interviews yesterday, many poll respondents expressed misgivings even about candidates they intend to support.</p>
        <p>''This is a tough vote this time,'' said John Ryan, 61, a high school teacher from Beverly, Mass. ''The parties have stuck these two candidates in our faces and you have to take the lesser of two evils.''</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Ryan is a Democrat who plans to vote for Mr. Gore, he groused: ''Gore looks like somebody molded out of clay. He's not warm or genuine. Bush might be a friendlier guy and easier to be with, but he either runs out of thoughts or runs out of ways to express them when he's asked a question.''</p>
        <p>Richard Koch, 83, a part-time accountant in Milwaukee, said he was voting for Mr. Bush. But he, too, is not satisfied with the choices.</p>
        <p>''My uneasiness comes mostly from the fact that he is not world-wise politically,'' Mr. Koch said of Mr. Bush. ''This includes foreign policy and basic economics, among other things. He doesn't have the background in these things and hasn't indicated that he really knows what he's talking about. The reason I would vote for him is that I don't think much of Gore. He changes his positions to temper the moment.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, a thread throughout the poll is that support for Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore seems halfhearted, with 4 in 10 of each man's own supporters saying they had reservations about their candidate. More of Mr. Bush's backers expressed enthusiasm than did Mr. Gore's; about half for Mr. Bush and about 4 in 10 for the vice president.</p>
        <p>Voters who were polled said there were significant differences between the men, and that they had more to do with issues than personality. Those who said the principal differences were about personality were three times more likely to say they would vote for Mr. Bush. Those who cited issues were slightly more likely to say they supported Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>Forty-eight percent of those questioned said Mr. Bush had more honesty and integrity than most people in public life, compared with 42 percent who said the same of Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>As the two nominees fight for an edge, Mr. Bush still holds an advantage among men, while Mr. Gore has one among women. Voters whose household income is less than $50,000 a year prefer Mr. Gore, while those with higher incomes favor Mr. Bush, according to the poll.</p>
        <p>The candidates are splitting support from centrist voters. Mr. Bush does significantly better among independent voters than Mr. Gore, but the vice president does much better among moderates. Voters who live in the suburbs are closely divided, though Mr. Gore holds a slight edge.</p>
        <p>The findings made clear that voters are uneasy about Mr. Gore as a person. More than half the voters questioned said that in general, Mr. Gore tells people what he thinks they want to hear rather than what he really believes.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Gore's weaknesses were seen by voters as Mr. Bush's greatest strengths. Voters surveyed said that Mr. Bush is more of a straight talker than Mr. Gore, and that the governor usually says what he really believes. But voters do not see Mr. Bush to be as caring for the average person as Mr. Gore.. And the governor continues to be dogged by the fact that voters see him as far less ready to handle domestic and international matters.</p>
        <p>In the callbacks to voters yesterday, many voiced more negative than positive things even about the candidates they supported.</p>
        <p>''My uneasiness comes from Al Gore being in the shadows of Bill Clinton,'' said Renita Pearson, 40, a nurse from Birmingham, Ala., who planned to vote for Mr. Gore anyway. ''I just have this feeling that he won't be able to be as charismatic in foreign negotiations as Clinton. When I hear him speak, I kind of get a condescending feel regarding us as Americans. He rarely uses the words 'our' or 'we' when he speaks, to indicate inclusiveness with those he is addressing.''</p>
        <p>Echoing many other respondents, Melvin Greene, 42, a physical therapist from Brunswick, Ga., said: ''I'm planning on voting for Al Gore because basically I think he is the lesser of two evils. George Bush seems to cater to the wealthy.''</p>
        <p>Victoria Saulia, 78, a retired insurance clerk from Brooklyn, N.Y., was not enthusiastic about her candidate, Mr. Bush. ''I don't know if Bush has enough experience for the job,'' she said. ''Just because he's the former president's son doesn't make him a good candidate. I watched the first two debates and I didn't get a magnetic, visionary feeling from him.'' She added: ''I have to vote and I'm a registered Republican. So right now, that's the only reason I'm voting for him.''</p>
        <p>How the Poll Was Conducted</p>
        <p>The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted Wednesday through Saturday with 1,279 adults throughout the United States. Of these, 1,010 said they were registered to vote.</p>
        <p>The sample of telephone exchanges called was randomly selected by a computer from a complete list of more than 42,000 active residential exchanges across the country.</p>
        <p>Within each exchange, random digits were added to form a complete telephone number, thus permitting access to both listed and unlisted numbers. Within each household, one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the survey.</p>
        <p>The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to geographic region, sex, race, age and education.</p>
        <p>Some findings regarding voting are additionally weighted in terms of an overall ''probable electorate,'' which uses responses to questions dealing with voting history, attention to the campaign, and likelihood of voting in 2000 as a measure of the probability of respondents' turning out in November. The method assumes approximately 50 percent turnout in November.</p>
        <p>In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all American adults.</p>
        <p>For smaller subgroups the margin of sampling error is larger.</p>
        <p>In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll. Variations in the wording and order of questions, for example, may lead to somewhat different results.</p>
