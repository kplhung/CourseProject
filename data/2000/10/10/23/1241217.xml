      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>By almost any business measure, the Knight Ridder newspapers in Philadelphia would be deemed a success. Since 1995, profit margins at The Philadelphia Inquirer and The Philadelphia Daily News have more than doubled, reaching close to 19 percent after years of single-digit doldrums.</p>
        <p>Good? Absolutely. Good enough? Not for long. For 2001, the target margin is 21 percent. And now there is talk about 5 percent budget cuts at the papers, if not more. Anxiety is as plentiful as oxygen in The Inquirer's newsroom.</p>

        <p>By almost any business measure, the Knight Ridder newspapers in Philadelphia would be deemed a success. Since 1995, profit margins at The Philadelphia Inquirer and The Philadelphia Daily News have more than doubled, reaching close to 19 percent after years of single-digit doldrums.</p>
        <p>Good? Absolutely. Good enough? Not for long. For 2001, the target margin is 21 percent. And now there is talk about 5 percent budget cuts at the papers, if not more. Anxiety is as plentiful as oxygen in The Inquirer's newsroom.</p>
        <p>The anxiety on North Broad Street is hardly unique in the industry. Publicly traded companies like Gannett, The New York Times, the Tribune Company, McClatchy and A. H. Belo all pay some attention to the Wall Street analysts whose judgments push their stock prices around.</p>
        <p>Most big-city papers no longer have strong local rivals left to battle for advertising and circulation, so publishers and owners now see their competition more and more as the financial results posted by other large papers and chains across the country.</p>
        <p>At the newspapers of Knight Ridder's rivals, profit margins are rising, analysts say, like skyscrapers in a boom town -- into the low 20's (at The Baltimore Sun), to 30 (at The Chicago Tribune). The Tribune Company, which owns those two newspapers, doesn't even have the highest profit margins. some Gannett newspapers have achieved margins in the mid-30-percent range, analysts say.</p>
        <p>For the analysts who follow the newspaper industry, profit margins are the metric that is never ignored. By that measure,  single-digit returns that Philadelphia Newspapers Inc., the parent of both papers, achieved in the mid-1990's made it ''a laggard'' and an ''embarrassment,'' analysts said last week.</p>
        <p>Rather than live in anyone's financial shadow, Knight Ridder executives felt they needed, if not parity, at least steady improvement in Philadelphia. But the broadsheet Inquirer and the smaller tabloid Daily News, since summer, have been caught between a local advertising downturn and a 14 percent uptick in newsprint prices, which are expected to rise by $18 million in 2001. Making 19 percent in 2000 will be hard. Making 21 percent in 2001 without budget cuts, probably impossible.</p>
        <p>The Inquirer's journalists know the drill -- buyouts, cutbacks, retrenchment, defections by high-profile reporters and editors. They also know things are not as bad as in 1995, when a buyout cut 7 percent of the staff -- more than 200 jobs. This time, the buyout goal is a 3 percent reduction in staff, or about 100 people. Overall the budget cuts at both newspapers are likely to be 5 percent to 7 percent range.</p>
        <p>Some of The Inquirer's rank-and-file journalists have a grudging understanding of the financial realities, and many say that the best of The Inquirer's journalism today is as good as it has ever been -- though a few dispute this point. But they still fear for the paper's 25-year tradition of politician-pounding, institution-busting journalism. This muckraking is the yardstick many of its journalists hold it to. How often, some reporters ask, can the place can go through these budget and staff shakedowns and still keep its journalistic ambitions intact?</p>
        <p>''The scope of what's going on is not nearly as big as in 1995,'' said David Zucchino, an heir to the paper's prize-winning tradition (he won a Pulitzer prize in 1989 and was a finalist in 1985 and 1995) who continues to write or edit ambitious projects. On the other hand, some people in the newsroom are concluding that there will be no end to the cutbacks.</p>
        <p>''Probably the worst thing about this,'' Mr. Zucchino said, ''is that we hit a 19 percent profit margin, which seems to me fantastic, and it's not good enough.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Zucchino and other editors and reporters argue that this year's work -- like a wrenching series on the long-term health effects of a toxic waste fire -- shows The Inquirer has not lost a step. Those who disagree tend to remain anonymous.</p>
        <p>But the new pressures are a reminder of how long it has been since The Inquirer enjoyed special cachet inside Knight-Ridder, getting a pass on some of the financial requirements imposed on its smaller cousins. The Philadelphia newspapers have traditionally contributed more revenue than any of the company's other 30 newspapers, generating close to 19 percent of the chain's total revenue.</p>
        <p>Now, their operating profit margins are approaching those of other papers in the chain, like The San Jose Mercury News.</p>
        <p>So of course Wall Street has taken notice. On Tuesday, when Knight Ridder executives talked to analysts about the company's third-quarter earnings, one of the first questions -- after a discussion of the prospects for Knight Ridders's online ventures -- was about profit margins.</p>
        <p>Peter P. Appert of Deutsche Bank Alex. Brown, asked, ''Are you confident of your ability to sustain newspaper margins'' in the coming year?</p>
        <p>P. Anthony Ridder, the company's chief executive, responded quickly: ''Not only to sustain them. We're working to improve them.''</p>
        <p>The importance of margins, of course, is nothing new. But, said Michael Beebe, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs, revenue growth was easier to achieve in the industry in the 1970's and 1980's, when newspapers dominated local media markets.</p>
        <p>Back when advertisers had fewer options, he said, circulation was reaching a historic peak, and newspaper advertising departments raised their rates at twice the rate of inflation. Newspaper executives, Mr. Beebe said, ''did not have to worry a whole lot about their cost structure.'' Even when competition from catalogues, direct-mail, and inserts grew during those years, one morning newspaper after another -- The Inquirer among them -- found themselves in a monopoly position, as their afternoon competitors died. Then came the market crash of 1987, accelerating the death of major retail businesses and tougher competition from local television news programs. The newsprint price spike of the mid-1990's hit as the industry was finally shaking off its hangover from a wrenching recession.</p>
        <p>Then the Internet came along.</p>
        <p>Competition for investor favor grew keener. Not only could Wall Street choose between a dozen newspaper companies, investors' other options just kept increasing as initial public offerings multiplied, and old industries like telecommunications developed new dynamism. And from one industry to the next, companies whose stock prices lagged tended to become takeover targets.</p>
        <p>''At the end of the day,'' Mr. Beebe said, ''Tony Ridder is trying to manage a very, very delicate balance: between pleasing the public markets, which are fickle and demanding and difficult to please, and doing the right thing for the quality of his news.''</p>
        <p>''Sometimes you have to trade off economic benefit for journalism,'' he added. And sometimes, investors and analysts will demand better margins --- or migrate to those, like the Gannett Company, which consistently achieve such profit levels.</p>
        <p>In Philadelphia, Bob Hall, the publisher of both The Inquirer (weekday circulation 405,000) and The Daily News (weekday circulation 161,000) has two options -- persuading Mr. Ridder to relax his proposed profit-margin goals, or finding a way to meet them. But he is working in a region whose economy has grown slowly in recent years, and has, like other markets, lost some major retail advertisers to bankruptcy. This year, after two or three years of strong performance in the high-margin help-wanted ads, The Inquirer's recruitment advertising began to dwindle.</p>
        <p>That, combined with the decline in dot-com advertising, helped push down the newspapers' advertising revenues about $17 million below the goal of more than $560 million. Mr. Hall is putting into place a plan to offer advertisers options like fine-grained, targeted placements across his  nine-county market or the ability to reach every home in the market, if they choose -- an approach called total market coverage.  But his older, dependable revenue dwindled before he could tap this new source.</p>
        <p>The advertising initiative was one of a variety of ways the newspapers have been rethinking their strategy. The Inquirer has focused on hyperlocal coverage.</p>
        <p>In Southern New Jersey and Chester County the existing, zoned local news sections have been refined, pumped up with more high school sports and opinion pages, and heavily marketed as a ''paper within a paper.''</p>
        <p>The effort has yielded circulation gains. How about the journalism? Robert J. Rosenthal, the editor, said: ''There are fine stories in there. It's not schlock.''</p>
        <p>The downside is heavy production costs, which raise the marginal cost of every new subscription gained. That has made some of The Inquirer's business executives wary of expanding the initiative to other regions, like Montgomery County. The final decision belongs to Mr. Hall. He will not tip his hand but he speaks of the ''paper within a paper'' initiative in bullish terms.</p>
        <p>That may come as a relief to some newsroom editors, who are frustrated with the new hesitation by some of their counterparts on the business side. They were once skeptical of the initiative, and some senior reporters did not enjoy reliving their youths at suburban zoning meetings. But with the project paying off in circulation gains, more editors supported it. So now they find it disconcerting to see its further expansion called into question.</p>
        <p>Lots of things are being called into question, and not just for economic reasons. In January, well before the revenue leached away, Mr. Rosenthal launched a group of high-ranking editors on a project to examine how the paper could use its journalists better. ''These were not budget-driven meetings,'' Mr. Rosenthal said. ''We talked a lot about the reader and his time demands.''</p>
        <p>As a result, the entire Sunday newspaper is being rethought, Mr. Rosenthal said, with an eye to consolidating a number of entertainment and other features, along with the television listings, into the Sunday magazine. The magazine, recently a persistent money-loser, would expand to 70 to 80 pages, ''with some of our best Sunday content,'' Mr.  Rosenthal said.</p>
        <p>As those options were being discussed, the budget troubles hit. After the revenue shortfall and the challenge of meeting the 2001 goal became clear, Mr. Hall this month announced a buyout proposal.</p>
        <p>Several Inquirer editors said the fiscal stringency provides a useful spur in the effort to set priorities. But they could not  resist asking why it is being imposed after Knight Ridder has reported 11 straight quarters of double-digit earnings growth. And some journalists are nervous about the future.</p>
        <p>Craig McCoy, a reporter, said, ''There's been a lineage, a tradition, of real quality journalism.'' What will happen, he wondered, if the news executives, like Mr. Rosenthal, who come out of that tradition,  become defeated by the push for financial improvement. My biggest worry,'' he said, is that this demand for return would lead someday to a management team here'' that would massively cut back on the editorial product.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Rosenthal, the editor, said that such worries, while understandable, were unfounded. Whatever the financial load is he added, ''I'm going to do my damndest to make sure we can carry it'' while keeping The Inquirer's brand of journalism intact.</p>
