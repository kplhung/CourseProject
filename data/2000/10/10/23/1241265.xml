        <p>MANHATTAN: CAMPAIGN COMPLAINT  Seeking to highlight what they say are Hillary Rodham Clinton's unethical fund-raising practices, Republican officials in New York have filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission over Mrs. Clinton's use of an official White House list for fund-raising solicitations. Mrs. Clinton acknowledged this month that 1,400 names from an official invitation list for a White House holiday party had been sent to her campaign and put on fund-raising lists. She said that the use of the list was an accident and that no wrongdoing had occurred. Her Senate campaign on Friday called the complaint a political stunt.</p>

        <p>ALBANY: MINORITY POLICE RECRUITMENT  The New York State Police Academy is having difficulty recruiting women and members of minority groups. In the class of 84 troopers that graduated last week, four were women, three were black and one was Hispanic. The seven-month gap between taking the police examination and entering the academy is a major factor, said Col. Harry J. Corbitt, deputy superintendent at the academy. ''A lot can happen in seven months when you're in your mid-20's,'' the age of many applicants, he said. For example, in the most recent class, of the 149 women the academy admitted, six entered and four graduated.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: FIRE HALTS METRO-NORTH  An underground fire yesterday afternoon at 59th Street and Park Avenue halted Metro-North service between Grand Central Terminal and 125th Street for more than two hours. The Hudson, Harlem and New Haven lines stopped running from 3:45 until 6:15 p.m., when local service was restored. Passengers were able to reach trains at 125th Street by using the Lexington Avenue subway line. A spokesman for the Fire Department said that firefighters received a report of smoke in Grand Central Terminal and investigated for about 45 minutes. The spokesman said he did not know what had caused the fire or the extent of the damage, but he did say that power had been cut off up to 110th Street.</p>

        <p>BROOKLYN: MAN SHOT IN DISPUTE  A 24-year-old man was shot and killed in an argument on a street corner in Crown Heights yesterday afternoon, the police said. The man, whose name was not immediately released pending notification of his family, was shot once in the chest at the corner of Montgomery Street and Franklin Avenue about 2:40 p.m. by someone who fled the scene, said Detective Edward Reuss, a police spokesman. He was declared dead at the scene. Detective Reuss said the police had no suspects and did not know what the argument concerned.</p>

        <p>TRENTON: CAMPUS CRIME REPORTS  For the first time, crime statistics from colleges and universities in New Jersey and around the country can be found in one place, on the Internet at www.ope.ed.gov/security. Crime figures from schools including Rutgers University, Princeton University, Drew University, Kean University, the College of New Jersey and William Paterson University are posted on the site. Campus crime statistics from more than 6,000 colleges and universities use standards set by the Federal Bureau of Investigation that include criminal and hate offenses, and arrest figures from 1997 to 1999.</p>

        <p>TRENTON: PRIVATIZING SCHOOL JOBS  School districts need the right to privatize janitors, cafeteria workers and bus drivers to close budget gaps or to put more money into classrooms, opponents of pending legislation said last week. A bill that would restrict the ability of districts to contract out those jobs has been reintroduced in the State Senate and the Assembly after an earlier version was vetoed by Gov. Christine Todd Whitman last year. Frank Belluscio, a spokesman for the New Jersey School Boards Association, estimated that schools contract out about half of their service jobs. But he said that nearly all districts require contractors to rehire laid-off district employees so that private-sector jobs do not completely displace public-sector jobs.</p>

        <p>HARTFORD: JANITORS SETTLE STRIKE  Janitors from the Service Employees International Union Local 531 have accepted an agreement with the contractors' association. The janitors on Saturday voted 239 to 115 in favor of the tentative agreement, which was reached Oct. 13. Union officials said the biggest gain was a substantial increase in full-time jobs for suburban janitors, which allows them to have health insurance.</p>
