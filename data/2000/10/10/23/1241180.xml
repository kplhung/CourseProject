        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''School Vouchers: The Right Path?'' (letters, Oct. 16):</p>
        <p>The American Civil Liberties Union does not support vouchers for several reasons, but the suggestion that vouchers are a lifeline to students who need help the most and an avenue to greater equality calls for a response.</p>
        <p>Seventy-eight percent of private schools surveyed in California say they won't accept students performing below grade level. So much for that rescue operation.</p>
        <p>But even if students struggling in poor-performing schools didn't have admissions obstacles, other obstacles would remain. We analyzed the geographic distribution of private-school seats in Los Angeles County and found that African-Americans, Latinos and families with lower incomes were far less likely to have access to nearby private schools. Add to that the obstacles of transportation and lunch costs, and the promise of vouchers looks hollow indeed.</p>
