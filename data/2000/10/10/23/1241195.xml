        <p>Vladimir Kramnik doesn't mind if his pawns look disreputable. If his pieces are battling mightily, he's happy and safe.</p>
        <p>That is what Game 9 of the Brain Games Network World Chess Championship showed yesterday in London. When he and Garry Kasparov agreed to a draw after 30 moves, the score went to Kramnik 5, Kasparov 4. Four more points and the $1.33 million prize is the challenger's.</p>

        <p>Vladimir Kramnik doesn't mind if his pawns look disreputable. If his pieces are battling mightily, he's happy and safe.</p>
        <p>That is what Game 9 of the Brain Games Network World Chess Championship showed yesterday in London. When he and Garry Kasparov agreed to a draw after 30 moves, the score went to Kramnik 5, Kasparov 4. Four more points and the $1.33 million prize is the challenger's.</p>
        <p>The strategic terms of the old but durable Berlin Defense to the Ruy Lopez, which Kramnik used in Games 1 and 3 of the match, are: White gets a space advantage after 4 O-O Ne4 5 d4 Nd6 6 Bc6 dc 7 de Nf5 8 Qd8 Kd8 9 Nc3; Black gets the bishop pair and a compact formation.</p>
        <p>In an endgame, Black's loss of castling is not a paramount feature. But his doubled c pawns would cost him the game if Kasparov could get all the pieces off the board.</p>
        <p>In the two earlier games, Kramnik relied on 9 . . . Bd7. Now he chooses the orthodox 9 . . . h6, played to avoid the annoyance that Ng5 could generate in some contingencies.</p>
        <p>In the two previous games, Kasparov chose to fianchetto his bishop, but realized little or nothing out of it, so here he tries the principal alternative, 12 Bf4.</p>
        <p>After 15 Nce2, the consequence of 15 . . . Nf4 16 Nf4 Bd7 (or 16 . . . Bd5 17 Nd5 cd 18 Nb5, winning a pawn) 17 e6 Be6 18 Nde6 fe 19 Ne6 Rc8 20 Rd3 Kf7 21 Nd8 Kg6 22 Nb7 Rb8 23 Rb3 is a pawn-ahead ending for Kasparov.</p>
        <p>After 17 c4, it would again be wrong to exchange with 17 . . . Nf4 18 Nf4 because 18 . . . Kf7 fails against 19 Rd7, while 18 . . . Rf8 fails against 19 Ne6 Bf2 20 Kg2 Rf7 21 Ng7, winning a decisive pawn.</p>
        <p>After 20 . . . Rhd8, it was clear that either one or the other of Kramnik's rooks would be able to penetrate Kasparov's formation. With 21 Rd8 Rd8, Kasparov offered the d file.</p>
        <p>And Kramik planted a rook there with 22 . . . Rd3. Was Kasparov thinking about what a rook invasion did to his equanimity in Game 7? In any case, it kept him busy enough so that he could not use his pieces effectively to make use of his superior pawn position.</p>
        <p>After 30 Rc3, the players agreed to a draw. It might have gone 31 Ne2 Rc4 32 Rc7 c5, quite even and without winning chances.</p>
        <p>Game 10 is tomorrow at 3 p.m. London time (10 a.m. Easter Daylight Time).</p>
