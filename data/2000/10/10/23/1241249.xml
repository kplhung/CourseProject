        <p>The numbers do not lie, even if they might damage an old lovable truth about the city and baseball: Most of the people who go to the games at Shea and Yankee Stadiums do not come from the city. They are suburbanites, arriving by S.U.V. instead of IND.</p>

        <p>The numbers do not lie, even if they might damage an old lovable truth about the city and baseball: Most of the people who go to the games at Shea and Yankee Stadiums do not come from the city. They are suburbanites, arriving by S.U.V. instead of IND.</p>
        <p>They are not embarrassed by this -- even if some sentimentalists believe that the farther you live away, the more your authenticity as a fan is suspect.</p>
        <p>Instead, these suburban fans say they are transplants but not frauds, with longstanding ties to the city. And at a time when most baseball teams don't even play in their namesake city, and New York's two football teams play in another state, suburban fans see their game-day treks -- often a mix of grinding gears and overheated tempers that are worse than the gritty nightmare endured by subway riders -- as confirming their genuineness as fans.</p>
        <p>If riding the D train gains one fan a merit badge, the Cross Bronx Expressway or Grand Central Parkway in August should gain sainthood for another. And if their only current connections to the city are through work, baseball or just memories, suburban fans believe that this series belongs to them as much as it does to anyone who lives within the city limits.</p>
        <p>''It's easy to get up for this, because this is our heaven,'' said Guy Cocozza, a 45-year-old Yankee worshiper who lives in North White Plains. He grew up in the Bronx, moved to Westchester as a child and still attends games with his childhood friend, Ray DeMayo. ''I suspect they're going to put a plaque here: 'Guy and Ray have dwelled here for many a year. Thank you, New York Yankees.' ''</p>
        <p>Actually, it is the Yankees (and the Mets, too) who should thank people like Mr. Cocozza and Mr. DeMayo, because without the suburban fans, the stadiums would be rather empty.</p>
        <p>Only 33 percent of Yankee fans and 39 percent of Met fans who go to the games live in New York City, according to a 1998 study by the city's Independent Budget Office. Meanwhile, given the ubiquity of the automobile, only 13 percent to 30 percent of spectators take the subway to either stadium, depending on the game, according to New York City Transit.</p>
        <p>Of course, it shouldn't come as shocking news that the changing fan base correlates with changing demographics. From 1950 to 1998, the city's population declined by 6 percent to 7.4 million, while the more broadly defined metropolitan region's population grew by more than 50 percent, to 20.1 million.</p>
        <p>Put another way, only about one in three residents of the region lives in the city now, compared to one in two half a century ago.</p>
        <p>Even so, neither physical distance nor the task of wading through game-day traffic has deterred die-hard fans from retaining their baseball bonds.</p>
        <p>Take Vince Termini, Brooklyn born and Long Island reared, who has always been a Yankee fan to the marrow. As a child, he was riveted by the perfect game that Don Larsen of the Yankees threw against the Brooklyn Dodgers in the 1956 Subway Series. As an adolescent, Mr. Termini took a bus and two subways after church on Sundays to catch doubleheaders at Yankee Stadium.</p>
        <p>These days, he lives in Succasunna, N.J., 40 miles west of Yankee Stadium. And though he can't go to as many games as before, he immerses himself in everything Yankees: the license plate holder, the hats, the jackets, the shirts, the personal scrapbooks.</p>
        <p>''My wife tends to feel that I think about the past too much,'' said Mr. Termini, who works for a pharmaceutical company in New Jersey. ''But I'll tell you, people that are New Yorkers, the people that were raised here, and seen family grow here, and seen family tragedy and family disappointments here -- that's really what causes the overall passion for this team that I have.''</p>
        <p>Rick Jacobson, 57, grew up in Brooklyn as a rabid Dodger fan; these days, he is a Met fan, works as a vice president at Avis, lives in Plainview, N.Y.</p>
        <p>But he remembers the 1956 Series vividly. After the Dodgers won Game 2, Mr. Jacobson hopped on his bicycle, and screamed with glee through the neighborhood. Then he hit a rock and broke his arm. It was an accident, but Mr. Jacobson ended up staying home for several days -- and watching the rest of the Series on black-and-white television.</p>
        <p>For Dr. Glenn Silbert, an ophthalmologist who was born in Brooklyn, grew up in Lakeview, N.Y., and now lives in Tenafly, N.J., the connection is personal. Elston Howard of the Yankees used to live on his block in Lakeview, so Dr. Silbert would wait, with many other neighborhood boys, for Mr. Howard to show up. Mr. Howard was rarely home, but when he did appear, Dr. Silbert recalled, he was a gentleman and an inspiration.</p>
        <p>''It was like there was this eternal glow around his house,'' said Dr. Silbert, 47, who plans to drive to some of the games at Yankee Stadium. ''That made me a Yankee forever.''</p>
        <p>It is important for non-New Yorkers to understand that baseball is not just any sport here. Look at football: the Giants and Jets may yet meet in a Super Bowl, but few people are as obsessed about that prospect as a Subway Series. Besides, the teams play in New Jersey.</p>
        <p>And anyone who thinks the suburban fan is less rabid than the city one has never met people like Allison Sanders, a 42-year-old teacher, bartender and single mother from Long Beach Island in New Jersey.</p>
        <p>Ms. Sanders grew up in rural Sussex County, N.J., and became a Met fan via television. This year, she recolored a blue-and-orange New York Mets tattoo on her upper thigh.</p>
        <p>Her daughter was born in 1987, the year after the Mets' last World Series victory. Her name is Shea.</p>
        <p>''At first, when she understood the origin of her name, she was like, 'Mama!' '' Ms. Sanders said. ''And I said, 'It could be worse: you could be Enron or Astrodome.' ''</p>
