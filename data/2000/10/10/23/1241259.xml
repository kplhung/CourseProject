        <p>AT&amp;T's board intends to consider a plan today to divide the company into four parts and focus more closely on specific segments of the fast-changing telecommunications market, people close to AT&amp;T said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Wall Street has been demanding evidence lately that the company, the nation's biggest long-distance and cable television provider, is willing to take strong and persuasive steps to revive the value of its stock, which has traded around half the price of a year ago.</p>
        <p>Telephone users would not feel much immediate impact from the plan, but they could end up winners if the newly separate AT&amp;T units were more nimble and thus able to cut prices and develop and introduce new products more quickly.</p>
        <p>Despite efforts to use its cable systems to compete in the local telephone business, for instance, AT&amp;T, with its current size and structure, has not been able to hook up retail phone users as quickly as many analysts had expected.</p>
        <p>The move, if approved today by the board, would represent the second time the company has voluntarily revamped its structure since the federal court-supervised breakup of the Bell system was completed in 1984. In 1996, AT&amp;T spun off its communications equipment business as Lucent Technologies and shed the troubled NCR computer unit.</p>
        <p>Since this last breakup, the remaining part of AT&amp;T, which includes long-distance and wireless businesses, has been getting bigger again -- most visibly by spending more than $90 billion to become the nation's No. 1 cable television provider. AT&amp;T has intended to use cable as a means to provide not only television, but also Internet and local phone service.</p>
        <p>Under the proposal, AT&amp;T's wireless unit and cable television operation would each be spun off as an independent company over the next 12 to 24 months, people close to the company said.</p>
        <p>AT&amp;T would also issue a new class of stock to track its struggling consumer long-distance operation, which would still report to AT&amp;T's chairman but would effectively operate as a retail unit separate from the core of the remaining AT&amp;T.</p>
        <p>That core would include most of the company's extensive global network, as well as AT&amp;T's data communications division and the unit that sells communications services to business customers.</p>
        <p>Besides any benefits that investors might find in the new stocks, the plan could allow the newly independent units to grow more quickly by focusing on their own strategies rather than being confined by the larger AT&amp;T. The consumer long-distance unit, for instance, could explore partnerships with outside companies that provide high-speed Internet access over normal telephone lines. Now, such a move would conflict with AT&amp;T's cable operation.</p>
        <p>If the plan was approved, which one person close to the board said was likely, it would reverse AT&amp;T's strategy of consolidating its far-flung operations, including the cable unit, under a unified corporate structure. That concept has been at the foundation of C. Michael Armstrong's three-year tenure as AT&amp;T's chairman.</p>
        <p>The company declined to comment yesterday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Armstrong appears to be in no danger of losing his job, people close to AT&amp;T say, and he apparently still has many supporters on the board of his view that home and business telephone users prefer a ''one-stop shop'' for all their communications needs.</p>
        <p>But the company is under pressure to change its approach, because the Wall Street honeymoon that began when Mr. Armstrong took over in 1997 has become a bittersweet memory. This year, as AT&amp;T's consumer long-distance unit deteriorated faster than even some of the most severe pessimists expected, investors soured on AT&amp;T's strategy of agglomeration, sending the company's stock down 55 percent over the last seven months. The shares closed Friday at $27.13, up $2.31, after reaching an intraday low two days before of $21.25.</p>
        <p>By breaking the company into four pieces, each represented by its own stock, AT&amp;T would seek to show investors more clearly the growth of its stronger operations, like the wireless business, while quarantining the financial impact of its weaker units, like its consumer long-distance operation.</p>
        <p>The breakup would also be meant to let the separate units pursue their own financing plans without worrying about sharing the proceeds with the other AT&amp;T divisions.</p>
        <p>Under the plan, the four units would be tied to one another by an extensive web of marketing and technical agreements. All could continue to use the AT&amp;T brand, for instance, and customers might have the ability to buy, say, long-distance and wireless phone service from their AT&amp;T cable company. But from an operating standpoint, and from the perspective of Wall Street, each unit would rise or fall on its own merits.</p>
        <p>If the four-part structure was not approved, AT&amp;T could still move ahead with a less ambitious agenda, like issuing only a tracking stock for its consumer long-distance business. The company has been known to be considering a long-distance tracking stock for some time.</p>
        <p>AT&amp;T has also considered an acquisition of Nextel Communications, a fast-growing wireless carrier, but those talks have broken down, largely over price, people close to the negotiations said over the weekend.</p>
        <p>In any case, one person close to the company said yesterday that it was likely the board would now approve the four-way breakup.</p>
        <p>If so, AT&amp;T could announce the moves as soon as Wednesday, when the company is scheduled to report its latest quarterly financial results, this person said.</p>
        <p>WorldCom, the No. 2 long-distance carrier, has also been disillusioned by the slowing growth of the consumer long-distance business. It intends to announce a tracking stock or spinoff for its consumer long-distance operation, which often uses the MCI brand, shortly after it announces its own quarterly financial results on Thursday, people close to WorldCom said last week.</p>
        <p>For its part, AT&amp;T is well versed in spinoffs, initially under much different impetus. Nearly 17 years ago, in settling its federal antitrust case, the company once known as Ma Bell spun off the seven Baby Bell regional telephone providers -- despite the names, giants in their own right -- and which have since merged into four even larger companies.</p>
        <p>In 1996, the voluntary breakup was carried out partly to unlock the value of AT&amp;T's fast-growing equipment operation, which as Lucent Technologies was enormously successful on Wall Street before stumbling this year. The other part of that move was to shed a faltering business, NCR, which the company had acquired in 1991 in an eventually unsuccessful attempt to become a power in the computer industry.</p>
        <p>Despite the company's experience with breakups, the pending proposal is remarkable because it so quickly follows a period of corporate expansion.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Armstrong took over at AT&amp;T three years ago, the company seemed adrift. Only a year before, it had hired an heir apparent to its longtime chairman, Robert E. Allen, selecting an executive from outside the telecommunications business, John R. Walter, as president.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Walter failed to secure the confidence of the board, he left and the company brought in Mr. Armstrong, a former top executive at I.B.M., who more recently had led Hughes Electronics. Mr. Armstrong, who replaced Mr. Allen as both chairman and chief executive, found in AT&amp;T a long-distance titan that appeared to have no viable plan to reach homes and businesses directly in local markets, even as the local Bell companies were plotting to invade AT&amp;T's long-distance turf.</p>
        <p>While AT&amp;T could have leased access on the Bells' networks to reach local markets, doing so might have seemed akin to the Ford Motor Company's renting space in General Motors showrooms to sell Ford cars. So Mr. Armstrong decided to acquire cable television systems to give AT&amp;T its own direct presence in local markets.</p>
        <p>AT&amp;T now delivers local phone service over cable lines to hundreds of thousands of homes, but the competing regional Bell companies have moved even faster in winning long-distance customers. In New York, for instance, Verizon Communications, the merged and renamed Bell Atlantic, has signed up more than a million long-distance customers since January.</p>
        <p>Partly as a result, AT&amp;T's core consumer long-distance business is shrinking, perhaps by as much as 8 percent this year. Because consumer long-distance remains a major part of AT&amp;T, the shrinkage there obscures the growth of AT&amp;T divisions.</p>
        <p>Many investors judge AT&amp;T by its overall results, so some people at the company think the stronger units would be better off on their own. In fact, the wireless unit began trading as an AT&amp;T tracking stock earlier this year. But in making their debut as they did during the downdraft for technology stocks, the wireless shares have performed poorly, closing Friday at $23, below the offering price of $29.50 late in April.</p>
        <p>If the breakup plan is approved, the trick for AT&amp;T will be to draw attention to the independence of the new units while maintaining the mutually beneficial ties of all the units.</p>
        <p>For instance, AT&amp;T upended the wireless marketplace several years ago when it introduced a cellular calling plan that included all long-distance charges; the long-distance unit appeared to subsidize the wireless business in the interests of the larger company. If the wireless unit becomes a separate company, the nature of that relationship may have to change, even if both businesses are known to consumers as AT&amp;T.</p>
