        <p>At the beginning of the final phase of the presidential race, Gov. George W. Bush is clinging to the narrow lead in the polls that he has held the last two weeks. Vice President Al Gore is even sounding like an underdog, with his combative promises to ''fight for you,'' while Mr. Bush has returned to the safety of his early theme of wanting to unite Americans. The governor's standing is a tribute to his effectiveness at the debates, where he held his own against a more experienced, knowledgeable and aggressive opponent. If Mr. Gore is to win, he will have to build on his own assets, talk more about the Democrats' economic record and somehow sharpen his attack on Mr. Bush without alienating voters.</p>
        <p>Poll results, even those two weeks before an election, are not necessarily indicative of how the vote will turn out. Since the 1960's, the trends have often shifted in the closing weeks. There were last-minute surges by underdogs in 1960 (Richard Nixon), 1968 (Hubert Humphrey), 1976 (President Gerald Ford) and 1992 (President George Bush), although none of them won. But in 1980, Ronald Reagan pulled ahead of Jimmy Carter only a few days before the election, largely on the basis of his debate performance and a last-minute collapse of a possible deal to free the hostages in Iran.</p>
        <p>According to the historian Michael Beschloss, the candidate judged by the electorate to have won the debate or debates has almost always won. This year, that predictive element is confused. Mr. Gore was widely judged to have won the first and third debates, but the public appears to have come away thinking that Mr. Bush passed a threshold of acceptability as a presidential candidate. As the latest Times/CBS News survey suggests, voters may be more comfortable with Mr. Bush's lack of experience than they are with what they take to be Mr. Gore's condescending manner. In the end, Mr. Gore has little choice but to emphasize the issues and hope for the best because, as the Times survey shows, those issues are his greatest strength.</p>
        <p>In sketching their different leadership styles, each candidate claims his approach will bring faster results. Mr. Gore sees the presidency as a place where a leader must fight against special interests. Mr. Bush sees leadership as the art of bringing people together to find a reasonable solution.</p>
        <p>But the vice president's stance is more in keeping with the modern tradition of the presidency, in which a president sets the agenda and uses the office to push through some version of it. Two of the most successful efforts in this regard were President Ronald Reagan's tax and budget reductions of 1981 and President Clinton's confrontation with the Congress in 1995, which forced a government shutdown but headed off the sweeping spending cuts pushed by the Republicans.</p>
        <p>The final weeks of a campaign are also a time when voters take one last measure of the competence and readiness of the candidates. In 1976 and 1992, last-minute doubts about Mr. Carter and Mr. Clinton almost persuaded voters to stick with the person they knew could handle the job. Over the weekend, Mr. Gore began trying to stir similar feelings in the electorate by questioning whether the governor understood the dangerous repercussions that could come from his proposal to withdraw American troops from their peacekeeping missions in the Balkans. At the same time, Mr. Gore is struggling to maintain his identity as ''my own man'' by keeping President Clinton's involvement in the campaign to a minimum.</p>
        <p>Each candidate advocates the brand of leadership that fits his personality. Does Mr. Bush lack details on policies? He makes a virtue of it by saying that the details on prescription drug policies are less important than the fact that he, and not Mr. Gore, will be able to get some kind of bill enacted. Mr. Gore's embrace of specific proposals on an array of issues, from education to health to tax cuts, may not bring the love and affection of the voters. But his declared willingness to ''fight'' on the big issues, contrasted with Mr. Bush's conservative agenda and advocacy of amorphous bipartisanship, lays out a dramatic choice in the final two weeks. Voters could be wrestling with it until the very end.</p>
