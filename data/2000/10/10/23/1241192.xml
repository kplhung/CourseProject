        <p>Myths are tailored to the way we live (geography, history, mortality) and to the way we dream of living (religion, philosophy and immortality). Where Greeks mythologized pastoral musicians who moved rocks and rivers with their songs, ethereal nymphs and bloodthirsty bacchantes, Americans mythologize big-time rock stars who make millions with their songs, earthbound nymphets and thrill-hungry fans. Both cultures dream of the kind of love that alters lives, tests faith and outlasts death.</p>
        <p>And so the story of Orpheus and Eurydice is adapted to every century and every medium. In recent years I've seen a heart-wrenching piece by the performance artist John Kelly; a production of Monteverdi's 1607 opera ''Orfeo,'' directed by Trisha Brown, that joined voluptuous antiquity with austere modernism; and Cocteau's 1950 film, based on his 1925 play ''Orphee,'' in which gods, poets and nymphs became vehemently chic, high-strung Parisians.</p>

        <p>Myths are tailored to the way we live (geography, history, mortality) and to the way we dream of living (religion, philosophy and immortality). Where Greeks mythologized pastoral musicians who moved rocks and rivers with their songs, ethereal nymphs and bloodthirsty bacchantes, Americans mythologize big-time rock stars who make millions with their songs, earthbound nymphets and thrill-hungry fans. Both cultures dream of the kind of love that alters lives, tests faith and outlasts death.</p>
        <p>And so the story of Orpheus and Eurydice is adapted to every century and every medium. In recent years I've seen a heart-wrenching piece by the performance artist John Kelly; a production of Monteverdi's 1607 opera ''Orfeo,'' directed by Trisha Brown, that joined voluptuous antiquity with austere modernism; and Cocteau's 1950 film, based on his 1925 play ''Orphee,'' in which gods, poets and nymphs became vehemently chic, high-strung Parisians.</p>
        <p>The newest version is by the clever, vehemently hip Adobe Theater. Adobe knows just how to retool old forms and artists (a fairy tale, film noir, science fiction, Pirandello and in this case Cocteau) to produce new theater games. So its ''Orpheus and Eurydice'' begins with bad sex and ends with death and everlasting angst, with rock 'n' roll in the middle. This Orpheus is a pretty-faced rock star in the requisite black leather (played by Andrew Elvis Miller with the swings from willfulness to sweetness you often see in people young enough never to have failed). Orpheus fronts and writes songs for his band, In Your Thrace. (That's right, the Greek Orpheus was from Thrace; getting the references gives one that old ''College Bowl'' sense of triumph.)</p>
        <p>The other band members are: Hercules (Jeremy Brisiel), who can't boast about war anymore so boasts about women -- why marry the nymph, he keeps telling Orpheus, just have sex with her -- and Jason (Adam Smith), who is kinder, gentler, a little obtuse and happily married to Medea. He's on the road a lot, after all: ''She's a very good mother.''</p>
        <p>Myths and references crisscross brazenly. The playwright and director Jeremy Dobrish (Adobe's artistic director) accomplishes all this with compact writing and versatile humor. (Sometimes he's witty, sometimes he's farcical, sometimes he's deliberately corny.)</p>
        <p>Aristaeus (Arthur Ausili) is Orpheus's best (and most manipulative) friend as well as the group's manager. (Oh that doggedly hip ''I'm on easy street now and looking good'' white suit of his. Meganne George's costumes are brassy, which they should be, and character-revealing, too.) Aristaeus chats up sexy, tough Atalanta ( Erin Quinn Purcell) in a club. Why does Atalanta have to race and outrun every man who wants to marry her? Why won't she marry? Because she has sports records to break and a place in history to think of. No contest.</p>
        <p>The play is full of short pointed scenes like this. Characters from other tales take center stage while Eurydice, whose presence is everywhere, is never seen until the end, when she is a veiled shade. This is exactly right. How could she live up to our expectations?</p>
        <p>So instead we spend a little time in hell with Sisyphus and Tantalus, whose names still signify endless burdens and thwarted needs. They fuss and gossip, living out their punishments like two actors in a ''Saturday Night Live'' skit. A music-channel reporter (NTV here) chronicles the marriage of Eurydice and Orpheus, her mysterious death and his retirement from the rock business in headline-speak with simulated news photos. You saw the same thing in Baz Luhrman's film ''Romeo and Juliet,'' when a television reporter described the family feud on the nightly news in Shakespeare-speak. So what? It's part of our life. It works there and it works here, too.</p>
        <p>The heartbroken, fame-and-fan-weary Orpheus travels to hell to do something meaningful with his music: bring Eurydice back. And at this point it becomes impossible to evade the emotional layers of this story. For it is about unbearable love and loss, and about trust that, violated just once, condemns you to loneliness. Adobe is willing to enter this torture chamber, but not without some handy safety catches.</p>
        <p>On his journey Orpheus gives a speech that invokes the terrors of hell, complete with red lighting that is dark but lurid. There are echoes of Dante here, and they are potent. Then he stops, says briskly, ''But enough -- I think you get the idea,'' and strides off. It gets a laugh, yes, but too glib a laugh to be worth getting, I think. Why not trust the moment? Mr. Dobrish and the actors do give themselves over to this intensity shortly afterward, when Orpheus turns around and loses Eurydice, then sinks to his knees, condemned to call her name.</p>
        <p>These kinds of transitions are difficult, and for the most part Adobe does exactly what it intends to do. They could use more stylistic variety: the actors who play Hercules and Aristaeus keep all their comedy fortissimo. The same is true of Jennifer Ward's groupie, Andrea, and her Bacche. Atalanta and Jason are just right, and as Teiresias (Vin Knight) is a deliciously languid know-it-all. Most of the actors play two roles, and they do so very efficiently.</p>
        <p>Form and function are a contented pair in Adobe productions. The budget is small. The sets, by Matthew E. Maraffi, are resourceful and clean; movable metal screens, a movie screen, a microphone curved like a snake. (You got that one right, too: Eurydice was killed by a snake.) Lewis Flinn's background rock score has the right aura of strutting, sneering and emoting. And (wise choice) Orpheus is given no contemporary music. When he is supposed to sing, he is bathed in a white light from above, and we hear the kinds of bell, bird and breath sounds that signal supernatural miracles in old films.</p>
        <p>It's all quite winning. Young, smart, a trifle skittish about sustained emotion, but filled with comic pleasures.</p>
