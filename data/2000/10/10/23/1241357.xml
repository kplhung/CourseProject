        <p>In a re-row of the finals of the Sydney Olympics men's single sculls, and a reversal of the finish order in the women's Olympic singles, the New Zealanders Rob Waddell and his wife, Sonia, won the inaugural 580-meter Schwab Sprint yesterday in the Head of the Charles Regatta in Cambridge, Mass.</p>
        <p>Earlier in the day, Rob Waddell won the three-mile championship singles event, defeating Xeno Mueller of Switzerland, who finished second to Waddell in Sydney, qualifying both scullers for the Schwab sprint. Don Smith, the American sculler who finished eighth in Sydney, finished third in morning to qualify for the three-boat sprint final.</p>
        <p>Rob Waddell rowed away from his opponents in the sprint, winning by open water. Coming off the water, Waddell was embraced by his wife, who moments earlier won the women's sprints, defeating the Sydney and Atlanta Olympic gold medalist Ekaterina Karstein of Belarus, who finished third yesterday behind Rumyana Nykova of Bulgaria. In the closest finish in Olympic rowing history, Karsten defeated Nykova by a hundreth of a second in Sydney. Sonia Waddell, who had finished sixth in Sydney, and her husband each collected $7,500 for their victories. This is the first time in regatta history that prize money was awarded to winning rowers.</p>
        <p>The United States national team repeated as the men's eight-oared champions. Princeton's women's varsity moved through six crews to place first in the championship eights.</p>
