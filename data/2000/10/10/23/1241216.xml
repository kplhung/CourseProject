        <p>G.E. Plans Acquisition Of Honeywell International  General Electric is expected to acquire Honeywell International, the diversified manufacturer, for about $44 billion in stock, capping a whirlwind of last-minute deal making that broke up an impending merger between United Technologies and Honeywell.</p>
        <p>As part of the agreement, John F. Welch Jr., G.E.'s chairman, will defer his planned retirement until the end of 2001 to manage the integration. [Page A1.]</p>
        <p>AT&amp;T to Weigh Major Spinoffs  AT&amp;T's board will consider a plan to essentially disassemble the company, breaking it into four parts that would focus more closely on various segments of the fast-changing telecommunications market, people close to AT&amp;T said. [A1.]</p>
        <p>The 'Bertelsmann Book Fair'  The annual Frankfurt Book Fair is at heart a marketplace for trading rights to translate and sell books in countries around the world. The fair is a relic of the days before e-mail, fax machines and Federal Express, when publishers saved up books all year to take with them to Frankfurt. Thomas Middelhoff, chairman and chief executive of Bertelsmann, is without a doubt the most powerful man in international book publishing. ''You know,'' he said, ''it really is my fair.'' He represents a 21st century vision of the book business, and not everyone at the book fair liked the way it looked. [C19.]</p>

        <p>PeoplePC Focuses on Alliances  PeoplePC is building its business by supplying discounted PC's to the employees of major companies -- including Ford Motor, Delta Air Lines and The New York Times -- without forcing a constant stream of advertising into those computers. But Dell Computer and Gateway are both likely to compete strongly in this area. [C4.]</p>
        <p>PC Sales Slow in U.S. and Europe  The personal computer industry continued its torrid pace of worldwide growth in the third quarter, according to two reports scheduled to be released today. But growth has slowed in the United States, Canada and Europe, as those regions show signs of saturation. [C10.]</p>
        <p>Bounties for Patent Rustlers  A new company, BountyQuest, operates a Web site where people and companies can offer rewards for information leading to the debunking of patents related to the Internet. One of the first ''bounties'' is for information to challenge Amazon.com's claim over a ''one click'' electronic ordering systems. Patents. [C8.]</p>
        <p>Web Auctioneer Acts Charitably  A 1918 airmail stamp with the upside-down airplane was sold in one of the biggest eBay auctions yet, with most of the proceeds going to Mothers Against Drunk Driving. The auction was coordinated by TakeToAuction.com, which saw a way to attract attention and new members. In its day-to-day business, TakeToAuction charges its members annual dues of $100 and gives them access to an online catalog of goods for auction, as well as helping them auction their own items online.

        <p>Hughes Electronics Plans Makeover  Hughes Electronics has an identity crisis: Since 1994, the company has been quietly transforming itself into a consumer concern that beams more than 200 television channels to about 10 million homes and businesses worldwide. But if you ask average investors what Hughes is well-known for, two things generally come to mind: airplanes and Howard, the eccentric billionaire who founded the company. Now Hughes has a makeover in the works. Advertising. [C16.]</p>
