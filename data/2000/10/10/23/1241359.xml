        <p>A close season ended with a close race yesterday as Michael Schumacher drove his Ferrari to victory in the Malaysian Grand Prix in Sepang, crossing the finish line less than a second ahead of David Coulthard in a McLaren-Mercedes.</p>
        <p>The two teams, which between them won every race this year, were fighting for the constructors' title after Ferrari won the drivers' title at the previous race. All Ferrari needed to ensure its second consecutive title was 3 points. But with Schumacher's victory and a third-place finish by Rubens Barrichello, the team walked away with 14 points and a record 10th constructors' title.</p>
        <p>''We wanted to win this race, and we did it,'' Schumacher said. ''A very tight race and Coulthard really pushed from the first to the last lap. That meant a very tough race physically, and car-wise.''</p>
        <p>It was the first time in 21 years that Ferrari won both titles in the same season, and it marks the end of the bleakest period of the team's history, after Ferrari had failed to win a drivers' title since 1979.</p>
        <p>It was Schumacher's 44th victory, his fourth in a row and his ninth this season.</p>

        <p>JARRETT RALLIES LATE: Dale Jarrett finally mastered North Carolina Speedway. After finishing second six times in his last nine starts on the 1.017-mile oval at Rockingham, N.C., Jarrett, the defending Winston Cup champion, took the lead late in yesterday's Pop Secret Popcorn 400 and pulled away from Jeff Gordon to earn his first Rockingham victory.</p>
        <p>The race was slowed in the late laps by a fire in the pits that injured a crewman and two track firefighters.</p>
        <p>Jarrett, who had not won since the season-opening Daytona 500, took the lead with 43 of the 393 laps remaining when his Robert Yates Racing crew got him off pit road ahead of the pack during the last of nine caution periods.</p>
        <p>Gordon drove past Ricky Rudd to take second place moments after the green flag came out for the start of Lap 354 and briefly challeneged Jarrett's No. 88 Ford. But Jarrett finally moved away, beating Gordon's No. 24 Chevrolet to the finish line by 2.197 seconds, nearly a full straightaway.</p>
        <p>Dale Earnhardt as 17th and trails Bobby Labonte by 201 points in the overall standing.</p>
