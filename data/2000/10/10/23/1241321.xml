        <p>BENDER-Betty. Died October 21, 2000. She was 95 years old and lived in New York City until moving to Scottsdale, AZ, in 1997. Her family and friends mourn the loss of a woman of great love and spirit. Her love of learning, music and art, and of New York, enriched and inspired all who knew her. She is survived by her sons Richard (Professor of Architecture and Dean Emeritus at the University of California at Berkeley) and Paul (Professor of Law and Dean Emeritus at Arizona State University), her daughters-in-law, Sue and Margaret, and four grandsons Michael, David, John and Matthew.</p>
