        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Dr. Richard Wurtman's dieting and exercise regime described in ''No Days Off Are Allowed, Experts Argue'' (''The Fat Epidemic,'' front page, Oct. 18) is self-defeating. By skipping lunch, he slows his metabolism, reducing his body's capacity to burn fat. If he took the time to eat nourishing low-calorie, low-fat lunches, he could enjoy his meals more and exercise less with the same results.</p>

        <p>I'm all for discipline, but being better informed about the way our bodies work is the first step to weight control.</p>
