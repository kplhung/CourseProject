        <p>For one of those rarest of times, the people of this city spent the night together. Beneath a blanket woven by electronic transmissions and draped over skyscrapers and bodegas, they followed an athletic drama unfolding dreamily in the bluish Bronx haze of one Saturday night in autumn.</p>
        <p>Tucked under that blanket was a woman in a cancer hospital in Manhattan, a Mets cap in her lap and an anxious knot in her chest. Joining her was a gaggle of young people in the Bronx, unable to sit still in a street-corner theater created with a small television set and a long electrical cord.</p>
        <p>With them were a washroom attendant at a wedding hall in Queens, a bartender in Brooklyn waiting for telephoned updates from his girlfriend in Staten Island, a lone police officer guarding City Hall, and countless others all connecting in a city of disconnects.</p>
        <p>These singular moments -- when the windows of water-view penthouses and subway-rattled tenements are aglow for the same reason -- have happened before: the visit of a pope, the assassination of a president, the first lunar step of an astronaut. But they are few. It would take something like the longest baseball game in World Series history, a game between two teams from the same city -- a city as prone to superlatives as New York. And that is what happened Saturday night.</p>
        <p>There was another game last night, of course, one full of its own twists and charms, and it was followed in much the same way around the city. But there was the sense Saturday night that what was going on -- as hour stretched into record hour -- was unusually precious and indelible.</p>
        <p>For instance, gently invading the nighttime hush on the eighth floor of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center on the Upper East Side was a murmur like water running: the voices of television announcers describing a second-inning scoreless tie between the Yankees and Mets in the first game of the first Subway Series in two generations. It trickled out from the day room, where three maintenance men in blue uniforms were taking a break; from the room of Ken Zavory, an electrician from Connecticut recovering from prostate surgery; from Gina Cava's room.</p>
        <p>She is 43, the mother of three, a cancer patient recovering from major surgery and awaiting a biopsy's results. But for this night, she said, she was focusing on the images of her beloved Mets on the small white TV set suspended above her.</p>
        <p>A black-and-blue Mets cap sat like a charm on her lap, and blue pills for her pain waited on her nightstand. On the wall, not far from a display of get-well cards, was a drawing of baseball diamonds by her 9-year-old son, Daniel. ''I think Mike Piazza will hit at least two home runs,'' the boy had written. ''What do you think?''</p>
        <p>The color on the set turned gray. ''Try and shake it a little, Dan,'' she said. Her husband did, and the lifelike color returned.</p>
        <p>Three miles north, at a New York City Transit bus depot, the disembodied voice of John Sterling, a Yankees announcer, rose above the din of engaged bus engines and spilled onto the deserted eastern end of 126th Street. His baritone serenaded two bus maintenance workers, Joe Miranda and Miguel Huertas, in the language of baseball: ''Leiter wheels, delivers. Jeter swings. Strike one.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Miranda and Mr. Huertas were working the 4 p.m.-to-4 a.m. shift and cheering the Yankees as they checked oil levels and listened to the play-by-play coming from a battered Magnavox radio propped next to a ''Safety First Eye-Wash Station'' sign. And whenever the roars of engines and air compressors drowned out the game, they had a contingency plan: stop work, stand closer to the radio.</p>
        <p>Across the Harlem River in the Bronx, a row of limousines rested in the half-light under the Major Deegan overpass, waiting for the last-inning moment when their drivers would hunt for the Stadium's high-priced clients. But it was only the fifth inning of a still-scoreless game; there was time.</p>
        <p>From the back of one stretch limo glowed a blue light. In answer to a knock, the dark-tinted window lowered to reveal three men nestled around a small TV set: two police officers with hats on their knees, and the driver, Bill Cook. For all the car's plush interior, Mr. Cook said, the reception under the overpass was terrible. If that perturbed his uniformed guests, they did not say.</p>
        <p>The dark window rolled up, a man pushing a shopping cart filled with cans shuffled by, and the game continued.</p>
        <p>Down River Avenue, where spilled beer perfumed the air and police officers stood in sullen silence, fans with Yankees white-and-blue paint streaking their faces hollered into the night. Around the corner, a woman and a child peered through a bar's dirt-clouded windows to catch a glimpse of the televised game.</p>
        <p>On the other side of the Grand Concourse, on Sheridan Avenue, young men and women rested in lawn chairs and on their knees before a small TV set propped up on the sidewalk outside the San Jose Grocery. Its electrical cord was taped up the side of a door to an outlet inside the store, where, in a corner, old men sang folk songs in Spanish.</p>
        <p>Almost to a person, the young people were Yankee fans -- all except Ismael Cosme, a Mets fan who lacked the filter that would prevent him from saying that Mike Piazza of the Mets was ''the best catcher in New York.'' The responses he received were colorful, harsh, affectionate.</p>
        <p>Sips from bottles in paper bags were taken; peanut casings fluttered to the pavement. Then a brash young Mets rookie named Timo Perez began to showboat around second base, mistakenly thinking that a line drive hit by Todd Zeile was about to clear the left-field wall. It did not. When a bang-bang relay ended with Yankees catcher Jorge Posada tagging Perez for the final out at home plate, all but one on a certain Bronx corner erupted in fist-pumping, chair-toppling joy.</p>
        <p>By 10:30 p.m., the Yankees and Mets were tied, 2-2, with the Mets threatening to score a third run in the seventh inning. And in the men's room on the top of the Terrace on the Park -- a colossal remnant of the 1964 World's Fair in Flushing, Queens -- several men in tuxedos and suits huddled around a washroom attendant named Ernie. It was not his handsome display of colognes and brushes and hand towels that attracted them; it was the transistor radio pressed to his ear.</p>
        <p>''Shhh,'' he said. ''Alfonzo up. Two on, two out, two and two.''</p>
        <p>Ernie's face went taut. He listened hard, nodded, then shouted: ''Single! Mets up, 3-2!''</p>
        <p>His disciples cheered, dried their hands and left. Many of them returned to the Crystal Suite for the wedding of Marisol Cruz and Alfredo Torres, a Yankee fan who had been keeping track of the game through a pager tucked into his tuxedo pocket. He and his new wife both broke from their conga line to check out a two-inch television set up on a white-linen table, alongside cold coffee and half-eaten wedding cake.</p>
        <p>The game continued, and so did bonds formed by crackling strands of transmission. Some listened to the Mets announcers -- including the institution known as Bob Murphy -- on WFAN-AM as they waited for red to turn green on Queens Boulevard; some listened to the Yankees' radio broadcasters on WABC-AM as they cruised along the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway.</p>
        <p>Many sat in bars like Sevens in Brooklyn Heights, where customers pulled on bottles of beer and trained their eyes on a TV set bolted into place above the counter. On top of the set sat a digital clock with numbers glowing in red, denoting the passage of time. At 11:47, in the bottom of the ninth, a ''Let's go Mets'' chant began and then quickly died as a sacrifice fly scored the tying run for the Yankees.</p>
        <p>Extra innings.</p>
        <p>''It's midnight in New York and the Mets and Yankees are still playing,'' said a Mets radio announcer, Gary Cohen, the mild night turning chillier.</p>
        <p>Officer Jay Nazario, stationed in a white booth outside City Hall, kept his eyes on a security monitor and his ears on the baseball game. When asked which team he was rooting for, he smirked as though someone had asked him whether his uniform was blue. ''Yankees,'' he said. Of course.</p>
        <p>Officer Nazario's Yankees wasted a chance to win by hitting into a double play to end the 10th inning. The 11th inning came and went.</p>
        <p>The wall clock in the Empire Diner on 10th Avenue in Chelsea ticked toward 1 a.m. The dishwashers and the food-prep men came out to watch the 12th inning on a Sylvania television set, not far from the vats of chicken and lentil soups. ''Excuse me,'' a customer called out, half in jest. ''Can we get breakfast?''</p>
        <p>The Mets failed to score, and trotted out once more to play the field. Back in Brooklyn, in front of the Rivera Food Center on Fifth Avenue, images of ballplayers flickered from a projector TV set and onto a makeshift screen taped to a late-model car. As if to suggest the connection between a ballgame and a city, some spectators danced in front of the projector to share the screen with the ballplayers.</p>
        <p>Then, 4 hours and 51 minutes after the first batter had stepped up to the plate, Jose Vizcaino hit a single, driving in the run to win the game for the Yankees. It was after 1 on a Sunday morning.</p>
        <p>''Yeah!'' a Yankee fan named Eddie Colon exulted. Then he and a few other men tore down the screen, removed the tape from the car, and began sweeping up the remnants of an October night that would only get better in the retelling.</p>
