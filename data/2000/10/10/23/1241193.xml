        <p>New on Campus  Described as the first art museum in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., the new Tang Teaching Museum and Art Gallery opens on Friday at Skidmore College. The $10.2 million, 39,000-square-foot angular structure was designed by Antoine Predock of Albuquerque and is finished in split-face block, silvery metal and concrete. It houses classrooms, a 150-seat auditorium and Skidmore's permanent collection. The building is intended for exhibitions, public events, lectures, readings and performances. Through Jan. 28 the inaugural exhibitions, ''S.O.S.: Scenes of Sounds'' and ''Vik Muniz,'' explore, respectively, the phenomenon of sound and the work of an innovative photographer. Information: (518) 580-8080.</p>
        <p>Winners  The double bassist Edgar Meyer and the clarinetist David Shifrin are this year's Avery Fisher Prize recipients. The prizes recognize outstanding achievement and excellence in music. Each musician is to receive an award of $50,000. Among previous recipients are the pianists Murray Perahia, Emanuel Ax and Andre Watts; the cellist Yo-Yo Ma; the clarinetist Richard Stoltzman; and the violinists Elmar Oliveira, Sarah Chang and Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg.</p>
        <p>Fleet of Foot  For Natalie Weir, the 33-year-old resident choreographer of the Australian Ballet, it's quite a week. From Thursday through Sunday, the Houston Ballet will present the world premiere performances of ''In a Whisper,'' her reflective work for five men and five women dancing to the adagio from Schubert's String Quartet in C. Information: (713) 227-2787. And at City Center on Saturday, the New York premiere of Ms. Weir's ''Jabula,'' a celebration of tribal ritual set to music by Hans Zimmer, will be offered as part of the American Ballet Theater's fall season, which begins with a gala tomorrow and continues through Nov. 5. Information: (212) 477-3030.</p>
