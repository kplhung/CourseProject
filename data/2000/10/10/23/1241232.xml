        <p>It wasn't exactly the day the earth stood still, but one of the world's largest and most cosmopolitan cities was a virtual ghost town today as Turks were confined to their homes for a national census.</p>
        <p>From 5 a.m. to 7 p.m., Turkey's estimated 65 million people were required to stay in their homes as 950,000 census-takers went door-to-door to fill out questionnaires. The police patrolled streets and set up checkpoints across the country to insure compliance.</p>
        <p>In this city of 12 million, the ferries and tankers that ply the Bosporus were idled as marine pilots and traffic controllers stayed home. Shops and restaurants were shuttered and the almost complete absence of taxis and other vehicles made the normally jammed streets eerily calm. Scudding sheets of rain made the enforced stay at home welcome for many residents.</p>
        <p>The only crowds seemed to be in the lobbies of the major hotels, where tourists congregated and skeleton staffs kept restaurants open. Despite being counted early and given written permission to travel around the city, the tourists found few places to go.</p>
        <p>There was a serious side to the inconvenience, particularly for the country's 3,200 municipal governments, which receive federal aid  based on population. To keep people home and make sure they get their fair share of revenue in the coming years, some cities relied on carrots and others resorted to sticks.</p>
        <p>In the city of Gumushane in eastern Turkey, the mayor sponsored a free concert on Saturday night to entice people to remain in town, and urged local men to bring fiancees and girlfriends from other towns along. Everyone who was counted in the southern city of Denizli was automatically entered into a lottery for a shot at one of 1,000 gold coins.</p>
        <p>In Giresun, on the Black Sea, the police set up roadblocks to stop people from leaving the city, and in Usak, in central Turkey, residents who were not at home when the census-taker came to call will see their municipal water bill go up.</p>
        <p>The capital, Ankara, got tough, too, setting up a telephone hot line so people could turn in neighbors who ducked out and threatening to cancel free bus travel for pensioners who were not home.</p>
        <p>Most of the 43 questions asked by census-takers were routine: how many people in the house, what are their ages, do you have indoor plumbing and electricity? But in keeping with the national mantra that there are no minorities among Turks, the census did not delve into religious affiliation, mother tongue or ethnic background.</p>
