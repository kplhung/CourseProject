        <p>Overweight and occasionally overwrought, Gerard Depardieu brings marvelous, blustery emotion to ''Balzac: A Life of Passion,'' Bravo's pleasurable vision of the great French author. With its elegant score and lavish sets, this handsome French-language production (with subtitles) has a lusciousness that suits its subject, a man who was outsized in almost every respect.</p>
        <p>Didier Decoin's script for the two-part series shrewdly captures the melodrama of a character who was defiantly gluttonous, acquisitive, romantic and above all prolific. Honore de Balzac is portrayed as a human fountain of words, written and spoken. While spending a few days in jail for avoiding conscription in the army, Mr. Depardieu's Balzac describes himself to visitors, including Victor Hugo, with a torrent of adjectives: ''Those who thought I was vain, extravagant, stubborn, conceited, careless, lazy, lacking application, unthinking and totally inconsistent, long-winded, tactless, impolite, capricious and moody are justified.''</p>

        <p>Overweight and occasionally overwrought, Gerard Depardieu brings marvelous, blustery emotion to ''Balzac: A Life of Passion,'' Bravo's pleasurable vision of the great French author. With its elegant score and lavish sets, this handsome French-language production (with subtitles) has a lusciousness that suits its subject, a man who was outsized in almost every respect.</p>
        <p>Didier Decoin's script for the two-part series shrewdly captures the melodrama of a character who was defiantly gluttonous, acquisitive, romantic and above all prolific. Honore de Balzac is portrayed as a human fountain of words, written and spoken. While spending a few days in jail for avoiding conscription in the army, Mr. Depardieu's Balzac describes himself to visitors, including Victor Hugo, with a torrent of adjectives: ''Those who thought I was vain, extravagant, stubborn, conceited, careless, lazy, lacking application, unthinking and totally inconsistent, long-winded, tactless, impolite, capricious and moody are justified.''</p>
        <p>But he never leaves anything at that, so he continues, ''In the same way as those who say I am thrifty, modest, courageous, tenacious, energetic, consistent, hard-working, taciturn, refined, polite and always merry.''</p>
        <p>In sum, he says, ''Nothing about me surprises me.''</p>
        <p>As Mr. Depardieu delivers this grandiose outpouring of self-analysis, he makes you see everything that is ridiculous and fabulous about this man who thrives on extremes. He becomes a walking caricature, outfitting himself in clownish clothes, as if the caricaturists didn't have enough material in his massive body and bulbous nose. The actor conveys this cartoonish aspect of the man, and his monumental ego, but also his neediness and tenderness.</p>
        <p>The filmmakers stake out their psychological turf at the outset, beginning with a dreamy image of a boy at boarding school, receiving the news that his mother has come to visit, a very rare event. He runs to embrace her and she stops him cold. ''No kiss for someone 32nd out of 34 in his class,'' she says to her child.</p>
        <p>Jeanne Moreau plays this harridan as a ghoulish presence who remains her son's lifelong nemesis. She lends him money on occasion, but never gives her approval of his chosen profession (wishing he had become a lawyer upon finishing law school), calling his writing sordid. Small wonder, given this Evil Mom scenario, that Balzac falls in love with women who admire his work.</p>
        <p>Having drawn this psychological map, Mr. Decoin, the screenwriter, and Josee Dayan, the director, have placed work and women as the longitude and latitude of Balzac's life and keep them intersecting at regular intervals. Madame Berny (Virna Lisi), his patron and lover, is an older woman who encourages him when he is starting out, as his mother won't. With her papery skin and fragile, aging beauty, Ms. Lisi is quite moving as a woman who gives her lover a mother's unconditional love, though he was the tutor of her children, not her son. (It's not that kind of melodrama.)</p>
        <p>The Duchess Laure d'Abrantes (Katja Riemann) takes over, after Balzac writes her memoirs, but their brief affair is more business proposition than matter of the heart. ''We are both debt-ridden aristocrats,'' he tells her. Debt, too, plays a large role in this story of a man who loved expensive tchotchkes almost as much as he loved a good story.</p>
        <p>Next to his mother his other persistent malefactor is Plissoud (Claude Rich), the bailiff who stalks him with the tenacity of a bloodhound (even claiming he can smell Balzac's odor).</p>
        <p>Balzac's great love, which dominates the story, begins with a fan letter, sent by a Polish-born Russian countess, Eve Hanska, played by the still-exquisite Fanny Ardant. Their romance takes place over years, and covers much exotic terrain: a duel at dawn with Eve's jealous husband, an elegant masquerade ball in Bavaria and Eve's vast estate in Ukraine, where workers bring her wagonloads of dead wolves ready for conversion into fur coats. Such dissipated elegance may seem like unseemly decadence, but it's fun to look at. There are many satisfying images of chandeliered salons and flounced skirts.</p>
        <p>Balzac's writing also consumes him, but thankfully we are spared too many images of him at work (though we do see him twirling his quill in the bath). Internal suffering is difficult to photograph.</p>
        <p>Despite all the high-pitched emotion, the film also acknowledges Balzac's sense of humor. When his mother informs him that the pope has condemned his work, Mr. Depardieu's Balzac doesn't miss a beat. ''What does the pope know about literature?'' he asks.</p>
        <p>The mini-series gives a fine sense of the Parisian society -- high and low -- in which Balzac operated, and hints at the fulminations of the Napoleonic era, which informed his thinking. Besides Victor Hugo, who plays a substantial secondary part, Rodin appears briefly, preparing to create his famous statue of the author.</p>
        <p>Balzac was born in 1799 and died in 1850. As portrayed in these enjoyable four hours, this relatively short life feels crowded and urgent, as though the man had physically incorporated not only the characters he created but also the world he observed and transformed into literature.</p>
        <p>BALZAC  A Life of Passion  Bravo, tonight and tomorrow at 8</p>
        <p>Directed by Josee Dayan; produced by Jean-Pierre Guerin; screenplay by Didier Decoin (in French with English subtitles); Willy Stassen, director of photography.</p>
        <p>WITH: Gerard Depardieu (Balzac), Jeanne Moreau (Balzac's mother); Fanny Ardant (Eve Hanska), Virna Lisi (Madame de Berny), Katja Riemann (Laure d'Abrantes) Gert Voss (Victor Hugo) and Claude Rich (Plissoud).</p>
