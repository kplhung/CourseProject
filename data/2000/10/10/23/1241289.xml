        <p>Taking a Sabbath rest from his relentless focus on fiscal policy, Vice President Al Gore preached today that America must match its economic successes with a ''prosperity of the spirit'' that can only be nurtured through a renewed commitment to families and values.</p>
        <p>In a speech laden with Scriptural references and delivered at the dedication of a Pentecostal megachurch in Dallas, Mr. Gore repeatedly emphasized that ''the center of my life is faith and family.'' While he proposed few specific remedies, the vice president spoke of a ''cultural pollution'' that has despoiled the country's moral life and of ''toxic entertainment that too often passes on the wrong values.''</p>

        <p>Taking a Sabbath rest from his relentless focus on fiscal policy, Vice President Al Gore preached today that America must match its economic successes with a ''prosperity of the spirit'' that can only be nurtured through a renewed commitment to families and values.</p>
        <p>In a speech laden with Scriptural references and delivered at the dedication of a Pentecostal megachurch in Dallas, Mr. Gore repeatedly emphasized that ''the center of my life is faith and family.'' While he proposed few specific remedies, the vice president spoke of a ''cultural pollution'' that has despoiled the country's moral life and of ''toxic entertainment that too often passes on the wrong values.''</p>
        <p>Though Mr. Gore has occasionally used such phrases before, his unabashed moralizing made for a striking departure from his campaign's recent focus on Social Security, tax cuts and economic growth. It continued the delicate blending of political messages and religious themes that has become a hallmark of the campaign by Mr. Gore and his running mate, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut. ''I believe that the purpose of life is to glorify God,'' Mr. Gore said in discussing environmental protection, ''and we cannot fulfill that purpose if we are heaping contempt upon God's creation.''</p>
        <p>Adopting evangelical language, Mr. Gore, a Southern Baptist who considers himself born again, said the thriving economy provided the country with its greatest chance ''to bring good news to the poor.''</p>
        <p>In an 18-minute address, the vice president quoted Scripture four times, recited portions of a hymn and recounted two Bible stories. In both content and tone, he waded into waters usually reserved for Republican politicians, a point made explicit by the presence at the same service of Pat Robertson, the Christian Coalition founder.</p>
        <p>The man who brought those two disparate politicians under the same roof is Bishop T. D. Jakes, one of the country's most prominent televangelists. The occasion was the dedication of The Potter's House, a cavernous 8,000-seat sanctuary built in Dallas by Mr. Jakes's ministry.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jakes is an African-American, as were most of his congregants today. He has an increasingly influential worldwide ministry, with many white followers as well, and his church's dedication was celebrated today with written messages from President Clinton and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, and with a speech by Coretta Scott King, the widow of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.</p>
        <p>Many of Mr. Jakes's followers -- black and white -- are culturally conservative, and the bishop spoke at this year's Republican National Convention. But Mr. Gore, while not delivering an explicitly political speech, made it clear that he was not ceding those voters to Mr. Bush. While there may have been little audience for Mr. Gore's message in Texas, a state that Mr. Bush is heavily favored to win as a native son, today's service will eventually be seen by millions nationwide when it is broadcast on cable television.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's speech in Dallas was the first stop on a 17-hour bicoastal journey that took him 3,000 miles, from Philadelphia to Dallas to Albuquerque and then on to Portland, Ore. He spoke briefly here at the opening of a national Hispanic cultural center. In his address to Mr. Jakes's church, Mr. Gore began by asserting that strong family life is ''something more basic than all of our budget debates but somehow harder to achieve.''</p>
        <p>''I want you to know how deeply I care about strengthening our families,'' he said, mentioning his 30-year marriage and his devotion to his children and young grandson. ''I want you to know that this is not just the heart of an agenda, it is the foundation of my life and my faith.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore won applause for recognizing that Americans are working longer hours even in the midst of the current prosperity, and that they have too little time to instill their children with ''the right values with a right heart and a right spirit.''</p>
        <p>''In too many schools,'' he added, ''discipline is eroding and many teachers spend their time on crowd control instead of reinforcing the lessons of good character and decency.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore embraced the concept of the social gospel, pledging that Americans ''will not turn our backs on those who are suffering, whether they be in the Balkans or in south Dallas.''</p>
        <p>And he volunteered his views on the pervasiveness of sin and human susceptibility. ''It is always hovering nearby,'' he said, feeling a preacher's rhythm, ''and if our resistance is broken down and too much of our energies are consumed in trying to manufacture the body heat that ought to be held by the clothing of love and acceptance and emotional warmth, then we are more vulnerable to the sin that comes to our door.''</p>
        <p>For much of the remainder of this exceedingly tight campaign, Mr. Gore is likely to keep breakneck schedules like today's, his strategists said. Among the notable stops this week are two in Mr. Gore's home state of Tennessee, where some polls show that Mr. Bush is competitive, and in the traditional Democratic strongholds of West Virginia and Wisconsin. Clearly, the Gore camp would have liked to have put those states in their column by now.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's strategists said today that internal polls suggest the race has been virtually static since Mr. Gore's poll ratings dipped after the first of the three presidential debates. After that debate, said Stanley Greenberg, Mr. Gore's pollster, the vice president lost support among women for stylistic reasons: ''He was obviously very strong and aggressive in the first debate.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's press secretary, Chris Lehane, said the Democratic nominee would keep the focus on issues by delivering speeches on major themes like the role of government, education, the Internet economy, energy and the environment, tax cuts, and health care. In keeping with the campaign's frequent use of ''real people,'' Mr. Gore also will lead a series of kitchen-table discussions with parents, students and workers in their homes, Mr. Lehane said.</p>
        <p>The election, Mr. Lehane said, will be decided on the issues, not balloon drops and rallies. ''It is not a race for prom king,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Today's speech at The Potter's House was one of several recent events aimed at encouraging turnout by black voters, who traditionally support Democrats by large margins.</p>
        <p>As is frequently the case for Democratic office-seekers, the pulpits of black churches will be regular stops for Mr. Gore and his surrogates. Mr. Gore and Mr. Lieberman have held weekly conference calls with black ministers in the last four weeks, said Donna Brazile, Mr. Gore's campaign manager.</p>
        <p>Ms. Brazile, an authority on turning out Democratic base voters, said the campaign was about to ''really turn up the volume'' with telephone calls, door-to-door canvassing, direct mail, radio advertising, sound trucks and fliers inserted in church bulletins. ''We're waking up a base that needs hardly any persuasion, just motivation to get out,'' she said.</p>
        <p>While the Gore campaign will use African-American mayors and members of Congress to tape radio advertisements and telephone messages, it has no plans to use President Clinton to do so despite his popularity in the black community, Ms. Brazile said. ''I believe in the end that African-American voters, like all voters in the country, want to hear from Al Gore,'' she said.</p>
