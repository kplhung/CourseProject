        <p>Belmont Park ran its last races of the year yesterday when it ended its fall season and began to move horses, starting gates and office furniture to nearby Aqueduct in Queens, where New York racing will be conducted until next May.</p>
        <p>The new season starts at 12:30 p.m. Wednesday and will run five days a week through May 6, with certain switches prompted by Election Day and holidays. But it comes with more prize money to be won in 36 stakes worth $4.5 million, notably the $350,000 Cigar Mile on Nov. 25, the $750,000 Wood Memorial on April 14 and the $300,000 Carter Handicap on closing day.</p>

        <p>Belmont Park ran its last races of the year yesterday when it ended its fall season and began to move horses, starting gates and office furniture to nearby Aqueduct in Queens, where New York racing will be conducted until next May.</p>
        <p>The new season starts at 12:30 p.m. Wednesday and will run five days a week through May 6, with certain switches prompted by Election Day and holidays. But it comes with more prize money to be won in 36 stakes worth $4.5 million, notably the $350,000 Cigar Mile on Nov. 25, the $750,000 Wood Memorial on April 14 and the $300,000 Carter Handicap on closing day.</p>
        <p>After that, it is back to Belmont Park, except for six weeks at Saratoga starting in late July. Then back again to Belmont, where the season will be extended for the annual day of championship racing, the Breeders' Cup, which has been awarded to Belmont Park for next Oct. 27.</p>
        <p>Belmont closed its doors on a brilliantly sunny autumn afternoon with two $100,000 grass stakes for 2-year-olds, the Miss Grillo for fillies and the Pilgrim for colts.</p>
        <p>In the Miss Grillo, Ruff was moved to the outside by John Velazquez after running eighth for three-quarters of a mile and won by three lengths. She beat the favorite, Mystic Lady, who shaded Medicine Bow for second. The winner, trained by David Donk, ran the mile and an eighth on the inner turf course in 1:493/5 , paid $8 for a $2 bet to win and earned $66,780.</p>
        <p>''She broke a little funky, but gathered herself and was running comfortably down the backside,'' Velazquez said. ''Once I got her to the outside, she exploded.''</p>
        <p>Velazquez came back to score again in the Pilgrim when he rode Volponi home for Phil Johnson in a driving finish over the odds-on favorite, Baptize, trained by Bill Mott, with Jerry Bailey aboard. Volponi had run in the money but had lost his first four races, while Baptize had won his first three, including one against Volponi. The winner ran the mile and an eighth in 1:48, scored by two lengths and returned $21.80.</p>
        <p>For the Belmont summer-fall season, which resumed after Saratoga on Sept. 8, Edgar Prado edged Bailey for leading jockey, 38 victories to 36, and Mott was the leading trainer, saddling 18 winners.</p>
