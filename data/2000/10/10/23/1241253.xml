        <p>FORTUNATELY for the Yankees, Jose Vizcaino was still awake at 1:04 in the morning Eastern time yesterday. For, as everyone at least east of the Hudson knows, he interrupted the sleep of many New Yorkers by striking a single in the 12th inning of an amusement in the Bronx. Game 1 of the Subway Series had lasted 4 hours 51 minutes, the longest game in World Series history.</p>
        <p>It didn't have to be -- the hours, that is, not the inning -- and it's a blight on the game that it did. Games now take so long to play that pillows, not Cracker Jack, are becoming symbols of big-league baseball.</p>
        <p>Barney Meyer and his wife, Denise Bodner, had gone to sleep in their bed on East 86th Street in Manhattan sometime before the witching hour, or around about the ninth inning, unable to keep their peepers open. But about an hour later, they were both brought upright.</p>
        <p>''People were screaming in the streets,'' Bodner said. ''And that's how we found out the Yankees had won.''</p>
        <p>A man I know, a baseball fan, a New Yorker -- he works in the major league baseball world and so didn't want his name used -- couldn't take it anymore either.</p>
        <p>''I quit around midnight,'' he said. ''Even if television wants the games played at night in prime time, they could still start the games earlier, like at 4 or even 7. I had to get up early the next morning. It was disgusting. Not the game, the time.''</p>
        <p>He didn't find out the score until the next day. Either he lives in a neighborhood of Mets fans, or he's a sounder sleeper than Barney and Denise.</p>
        <p>Particularly in the postseason these days, it takes about three and a half hours to play the regulation nine innings. The last time the Yankees played a 12-inning game in the World Series was in 1977, Game 1 against the visiting Dodgers. The game concluded with the identical score as Saturday night's, 4-3. But it took 3:24, about an hour and a half shorter than Game 1 of 2000. Games 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 of that series were played in 2:27, 2:31, 2:07, 2:29 and 2:18.</p>
        <p>The last time a Subway Series game went past 10 innings was in 1952, Game 5 of the Yankees versus the Dodgers in Yankee Stadium. The 11-inning game was played in exactly three hours.</p>
        <p>If brevity is indeed the soul of wit, shorter baseball games are the soul of drama. Before Saturday's game, Bud Selig, the commissioner of baseball, was lamenting the length of games. He had no premonition of the marathon to follow. ''We're trying to do something about it,'' he said. ''We had cut the games down by five or six minutes last year.''</p>
        <p>But the games put the minutes back on -- and then some -- like a guy who had dropped five or six pounds but couldn't resist the chocolate cake anymore. Or like ants to a sandwich. Shoo 'em away, but they're soon back, and with relatives. Selig, a lamenter of the highest order, knows he could really do something about it if that were his primary interest. Which it isn't.</p>
        <p>And it's not just the equipment that he says he must address. It's true, though, that the profusion of batting gloves and wrist bands and elbow pads and shinguards for batters has added time to games. Between every pitch, batters make more adjustments on their wardrobe than a Fifth Avenue tailor. And pitchers spend so much time scratching themselves, you wonder if there's poison ivy in the infield.</p>
        <p>But no, the reason that a 12-inning game today, for example, takes an hour and a half longer than a quarter-century ago, is twofold. Television demands it -- and baseball management follows. Fox is paying $115 million a year and NBC $80 million for the rights to postseason games and the game of the week, and Fox will be paying $2.5 billion over the next six years.</p>
        <p>Television needs long games for increased commercials, whether it's added time between innings, or between a change of pitchers, or when an umpire bends over like a cancan dancer to commit housekeeping on home plate. The owners are delighted that television is happy. And if the other owners, who pay Selig's salary, are happy (his ownership of the Milwaukee Brewers is in a trust while his daughter runs the team and he makes a welcome $2 million a year as commissioner), then the commissioner is unquestionably happy.</p>
        <p>The owners also benefit from longer games in another way. More time between innings means more time for customers to file to the concession stands. And what concession stands in these octopus palaces. A New York street staple of a pretzel and a soda -- a buck for a pretzel and 80 cents for the drink at any corner -- cost $7.50 at Yankee Stadium: $3.50 for the pretzel (a packet of mustard is free -- how generous the baseball magnates are) and $4 for a regular soda.</p>
        <p>So fans in the stands, down to their last nickels and dimes in the $110 World Series seats in the farthermost reaches of the Stadium -- box seats are a pretty penny higher -- pinch themselves to stay wake.</p>
        <p>Yawning fans at home, meanwhile, reach for their remote control.</p>
        <p>And the television and baseball magnates across this favored land are making bank deposits even in the dark of morning.</p>
