        <p>The replay of Roger Clemens planting a fastball on Mike Piazza's helmet three and a half months ago and Piazza subsequently crumpling to the dirt was a popular slice of videotape. Flip on any sports highlight show and there was an excellent chance of seeing a replay of a future Hall of Fame pitcher decking a future Hall of Fame catcher. Over and over until you reached for the remote.</p>
        <p>The Yankees saw these shows, watched the replay again and wondered why it was receiving so much attention. The same Yankees who used to criticize Clemens when he tossed fastballs under their chins wondered why the replay was so prominent and wondered why the questions about the incident intensified.</p>
        <p>''He used to throw at me all the time,'' Derek Jeter said last week.</p>
        <p>That is basically the Yankees' explanation and their defense. Clemens is a bully, a power pitcher who hit 98 miles an hour on the radar gun last night and who uses intimidation to collect some of his outs. Clemens believes in uncorking fastballs that will make batters move their feet, make them take a step back and think twice about leaning in too close. He is a bully, but he is the Yankees' bully now, so they will line up behind him and blindly support him.</p>
        <p>That is too bad. After Clemens tossed a two-hitter over eight innings and the Yankees quieted the Mets, 6-5, they snatched a 2-0 lead in the four-of-seven-game series. The Yankees are two victories from winning their third World Series title in a row, but the class that they have shown during this remarkable period was tarnished by Clemens whipping a hunk of Piazza's bat toward him last night.</p>
        <p>No explanation is sufficient for what Clemens did. Piazza's bat shattered when he fouled off a 1-2 fastball and the barrel of the bat slithered toward the mound, where Clemens stopped it. Clemens then threw it sidearm within a few feet of Piazza, who had started to trot up the first-base line.</p>
        <p>Clemens kept telling Piazza, ''I thought it was the ball,'' but that was a bogus explanation. Clemens knows the difference between a bat and a ball. Any 4-year-old knows. He acted like a bully who had been pushed for the first time and decided the solution was to push back a bit harder. Clemens blamed the wild toss on emotion.</p>
        <p>''Before I let go of the bat, I had no idea that Mike had ran and I told the umpire that,'' Clemens said. ''There was no intent.''</p>
        <p>If Mike Hampton picked up a chunk of wood and flung it near Jeter, George Steinbrenner would have been in the Yankees' clubhouse last night bellowing for Commissioner Bud Selig to suspend Hampton. Instead, a happy Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner, called Clemens's performance ''fantastic'' and also told one Yankee: ''They're looking for excuses. We'll just keep playing; playing and winning.''</p>
        <p>Manager Joe Torre had a hostile exchange with reporters after the game and even stood up and started to leave the interview room at one point. He returned, but Torre was as agitated as he has been since he came to the Yankees in 1996.</p>
        <p>''I mean, all you people are here because this is the World Series,'' Torre said. ''If you think that you go out there and you are robots and you throw the ball, you catch the ball, and that's what we do -- you have to be emotional about this and you have to be passionate about this.''</p>
        <p>When the Yankees were asked about the Clemens-Piazza incident afterward, most of them said that they had not seen the play. It was amusing to hear the Yankees mouth the same lines, as if they had been rehearsed with an acting coach during the seventh-inning stretch.</p>
        <p>''I was looking at the ball, the ball went foul and I'm running toward first base and, all of a sudden, basically I don't know what happened,'' said catcher Jorge Posada, who stepped in front of Piazza. ''I didn't say anything to Piazza. I just said, 'Let's play baseball.' ''</p>
        <p>Jeter said: ''I don't know what happened. There was a foul ball, I went back to shortstop and, all of a sudden, everyone was on the field.''</p>
        <p>First baseman Tino Martinez said, ''I really didn't see what happened until the replay. We really didn't want any incidents. We told him after that to just pitch your game.''</p>
        <p>Is it even remotely possible that the catcher, the shortstop and the first baseman, the Yankees who were probably the closest to Clemens, did not see what he had done? Of course not. The Yankees were simply offering no comment to protect their teammate. He might be a bully, but he is their bully. After saying that he did not see the play, Martinez offered specifics of it and a mild rebuke of Piazza. ''I don't know if Roger saw him to begin with,'' Martinez said. ''I don't know why he would have ran to first base anyway if the ball was in the dugout.''</p>
        <p>Instead of joining the chorus of Yankees who acted as if they were wearing eye patches at the time of the Clemens-Piazza confrontation, Paul O'Neill foolishly blamed it on ''media hype.'' Then O'Neill said the bat flew toward Clemens and Clemens's immediate response as a professional athlete was to react in some way. Still, only a bully would act the way Clemens did.</p>
        <p>A bully is a bully, even when he is your bully. The Yankees should have condemned what Clemens did last night. They should have shaken his hand for the splendid game, then shaken their heads and told him that they disapproved of his dangerous behavior. They did not. So, like a bully, they are tarnished, too.</p>
