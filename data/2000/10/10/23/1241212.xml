        <p>The Nippon Life Insurance Company, one of Japan's largest insurers, said today that it was working toward a loose alliance with three nonlife insurance companies that would create one of the largest insurance groups in Japan.</p>
        <p>The four companies -- Nippon Life, Sumitomo Marine and Fire Insurance, Mitsui Marine and Fire Insurance and Dowa Fire and Marine Insurance -- apparently are not contemplating a merger. Rather, they are looking for ways to share the costs of bringing their information technology up to date, government officials said today. Mitsui and Sumitomo have previously announced plans to merge.</p>

        <p>The Nippon Life Insurance Company, one of Japan's largest insurers, said today that it was working toward a loose alliance with three nonlife insurance companies that would create one of the largest insurance groups in Japan.</p>
        <p>The four companies -- Nippon Life, Sumitomo Marine and Fire Insurance, Mitsui Marine and Fire Insurance and Dowa Fire and Marine Insurance -- apparently are not contemplating a merger. Rather, they are looking for ways to share the costs of bringing their information technology up to date, government officials said today. Mitsui and Sumitomo have previously announced plans to merge.</p>
        <p>''At present, the four companies have been studying the possibility of cooperation, but no agreement has yet been reached,'' Nippon Life said in a statement.</p>
        <p>The discussions emerged in the wake of the failure on Friday of the Kyoei Mutual Life Insurance Company, which had the distinction of being Japan's largest corporate bankruptcy, and it raised further concerns about the country's life insurance industry.</p>
        <p>Japanese newspapers suggested over the weekend that a bidding war that might include GE Capital and a group led by the Yamato Mutual Life Insurance Company is in the making for Kyoei, which has already asked the court to place it in the hands of the Prudential Insurance Company of America.</p>
        <p>Last month, Prudential broke off a deal to take a 20 percent stake in Kyoei in exchange for 30 billion yen. Japanese government officials have said that after Kyoei's business soured even further, Prudential decided it would cost far more than it was contemplating to overhaul Kyoei, a longtime partner.</p>
        <p>Those costs will drop under court administration.</p>
        <p>Nippon Life, which has long sought the advice and counsel of foreign asset management companies, has none of the problems that hurt Kyoei.</p>
        <p>But all Japanese financial institutions are facing the challenge and high costs of installing new computer and information management systems that will put them on an equal footing with global competitors quickly entering the market.</p>
        <p>Last month, Tokio Marine and Fire Insurance, Nichido Fire and Marine Insurance and Asahi Mutual Life said they intended to form an alliance. Similar plans were announced in August by Dai-Ichi Mutual Life Insurance and Yasuda Fire and Marine Insurance.</p>
