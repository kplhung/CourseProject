        <p>PORTNOY-Susan E. Age 57, on October 21, 2000. Devoted daughter of Sara and the late Louis David Portnoy. Loving sister of Robert Portnoy of Plantation, FL, and Sharon Siegel of Forest Hills, NY, and aunt of Jessica Siegel, Leah Beth Portnoy and Michael Portnoy. Cherished companion of Jeffrey Haveson of West Orange, NJ. Susan taught in the kindergarten and pre-kindergarten program at P.S. 380 in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, for 37 years, following in her mother's footsteps, often touching the lives of succeeding generations of the same families. She was the paradigm of educational excellence, both for her students and for her colleagues. Susan's imprint on the community was such that the parent's resource room at the Nuestros Ninos Child Development Center is being named for her. Services today, 12 noon, at the Kehila Chapel, 16 Brighton 11th St, Brooklyn. Contributions may be made to the Alliance For Lung Cancer, P.O. Box 849, Vancouver, WA 98666.</p>
