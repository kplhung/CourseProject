        <p>China's defense minister flew to North Korea today for ''friendly talks,'' just hours before Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright was due to arrive in the North Korean capital.</p>
        <p>Minister Chi Haotian was accompanied by senior military officials and will spend five days in North Korea, according to the New China News Agency.</p>
        <p>The visit had been long planned -- its official purpose is to commemorate the 50th anniversary of China's entry into the Korean War, which falls on Wednesday. But the sudden departure this weekend was unexpected, perhaps related to Dr. Albright's impending arrival.</p>
        <p>The visit is ''intended to improve the existing friendship and cooperation between the two countries,'' the agency said.</p>
        <p>In recent months, China's leaders have served as quiet mentors to Kim Jong Il, the formerly reclusive North Korean leader, as he has sought to expand his foreign ties and perhaps loosen his country's rigid planned economy.</p>
        <p>Outwardly, the Chinese have been extremely supportive of his efforts to establish diplomatic ties with Western nations, including the United States. ''China welcomes any progress in the relations between the Democratic People's Republic of China and the U.S.,'' Zhu Bangzao, a foreign ministry spokesman, said last week.</p>
        <p>But some Chinese military analysts have worried about the possibility that better relations between North and South Korea -- perhaps eventual reunification -- could give American troops stationed in South Korea free access to the Chinese border.</p>
        <p>Since the collapse of the former Soviet Union, China has been the only major power to maintain friendly ties with Pyongyang. And despite a long history of ''socialist brotherhood,'' the Chinese leaders in recent years have clearly grown weary of supporting a government that could not support itself.</p>
        <p>Foreign health experts say that more than 1.5 million people have died as a result of food shortages in North Korea over the past six years. Many of the country's factories are at a standstill because it has little gas or electricity.</p>
        <p>China is a major donor of coal and corn to North Korea. And, in the past few years, more than 100,000 North Koreans have sneaked over the common border into China in search of work, food and money, putting a strain on the local Chinese economy.</p>
