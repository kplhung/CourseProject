        <p>Mike Hampton has maintained through the year that he will not address his future until after the Mets' season is over. After his mediocre outing last night, Hampton did not want to contemplate that his season and perhaps his Mets career could have ended so miserably.</p>
        <p>''I don't think of it that way,'' said Hampton, a potential free agent after the World Series. ''I think I'm going to get another start. I think we're good enough to win at least two games at home and come back here, and have a chance to pitch again.''</p>
        <p>Because Hampton was wild early and because he was unable to match an intimidating and dominant Roger Clemens, the Mets fell to the Yankees, 6-5. The Yankees lead the four-of-seven-game Series by two games to none, so the Mets must win at least two games at Shea Stadium to return to Yankee Stadium next Saturday.</p>
        <p>In his first World Series game, Hampton looked nothing like the masterful pitcher who dominated the Cardinals twice in the National League Championship Series. He allowed four runs on eight hits in six innings. He walked five after walking a total of seven in his three previous starts this postseason. Fifty-nine of his 124 pitches were balls.</p>
        <p>Now he hopes he can enter the off-season with at least a better start to remember.</p>
        <p>''I want to get out there bad,'' Hampton said. ''I hope I get another opportunity. I think we can do it if we come out and play like we did tonight, be aggressive and battle our tails off like we did.''</p>
        <p>Hampton hit David Justice with a pitch in the sixth inning, but he never appeared to retaliate for Clemens hitting Mike Piazza with a pitch in July or throwing a broken bat near Piazza in the first inning last night.</p>
        <p>''I threw inside enough,'' Hampton said. ''I wanted to get into a comfort level and I wanted to get out there and get out into a groove. I thought by the second inning I started feeling a lot better. I started making pitches and working both sides of the plate  but by then it was too late the way Roger was pitching.''</p>
        <p>This was the overwhelmed Hampton who walked nine batters on opening day in Japan, the pitcher who struggled with his control and his confidence for the first month before becoming one of baseball's most dominant starters. Hampton then indicated that he had allowed himself to be overcome by the pressure of coming to a team looking for him to guide it to the World Series. He finally decided to be aggressive and won 18 of his last 26 decisions.</p>
        <p>Hampton lost his first postseason game before being voted the most valuable player of the N.L.C.S. His three-hit shutout of the Cardinals last Monday sent the Mets to the World Series for the first time in 14 years. Hampton threw his arms into the sky as Timo Perez caught the last out of the game, aware he had accomplished his mandate.</p>
        <p>Hampton was a very different pitcher last night. While Clemens was throwing a broken bat in Piazza's direction and otherwise stifling the Mets, Hampton was unable to stop the Yankees' momentum from their 12-inning victory on Saturday.</p>
        <p>Clemens threw a first-pitch strike to the first 10 Mets batters he faced before hitting Edgardo Alfonzo on the left biceps in the fourth inning. Hampton fell behind on 8 of the first 12 hitters he faced. The Yankees led by 3-0 before the Mets even batted around. Hampton threw 76 pitches in the first three innings.</p>
        <p>After retiring the first two batters in the bottom of the first, Hampton  threw nine straight balls. Justice and Bernie Williams each walked before the Mets' pitching coach, Dave Wallace, approached the mound with a 1-0 count on Tino Martinez. Two pitches later, Martinez sliced a 1-2 pitch to left field to score Justice from second.</p>
        <p>Posada grounded a full-count pitch up the middle to give the Yankees a 2-0 lead, and the Yankees had runners on second and third when Jay Payton dropped the ball as he was reaching into his glove for a throw. Reliever Rick White began throwing in the bullpen. Could Hampton's Mets' career really end this way? He struck out Paul O'Neill swinging to end the inning. The Mets trailed by only 2-0.</p>
        <p>But Hampton never regained his control. He allowed Scott Brosius's leadoff homer in the second and continually worked out of jams.</p>
        <p>''I'm not going to think of it as his last start,'' said Al Leiter, Hampton's close friend on the team, who started Game 1. ''I'm going to think of him being back out there next Saturday. I hope so. That's our only chance.''</p>
