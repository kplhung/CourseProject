      <block class="full_text">
        <p>When Yu Jie published his first book of essays in 1998, as a 25-year-old graduate student, he was immediately hailed here as an important new voice.</p>
        <p>And because his writings exalted freedom and denounced China's official culture as vacuous, the appearance of that book, ''Fire and Ice,'' was widely seen as evidence that the Communist Party was relaxing its stranglehold on public debate.</p>
        <p>But two years and five provocative books later, the authorities are working to muffle Mr. Yu. His travails exemplify this year's tighter constraints on many of the country's livelier thinkers -- people who have not courted prison with direct activism, but whose careers are in jeopardy because they write so pointedly about China's shortcomings.</p>
        <p>Mr. Yu's punishment, the denial of a promised job, might sound trivial abroad. But in China, where the state controls all academic centers, it is potentially drastic, and word of recent experiences like his has caused a chill among scholars and book publishers.</p>
        <p>In April, as he was finishing his M.A. in Chinese literature at Beijing University, Mr. Yu was offered a job at the Chinese Modern Literature Institute, a research arm of the official China Writers Association, and an agreement was signed. The institute's leaders, he recalled in an interview, seemed eager to take him on.</p>
        <p>Mr. Yu envisaged pursuing his scholarship on early modern literature while writing social commentaries in his private time, he said.</p>
        <p>But when he reported for work this fall, officials at the institute said the agreement was being rescinded at the insistence of the writers association. The order almost certainly came from on high in the Communist Party, although no one will say who gave it or why.</p>
        <p>''These days it's more commonly a senior official making a phone call, with nothing in writing,'' Mr. Yu said. ''I think this shows that they are afraid of the historical responsibility they'll have to bear for repressing intellectuals and restricting freedom.''</p>
        <p>More than a job and its modest salary are at stake: Mr. Yu appears to be effectively blackballed from a paying position as a scholar.</p>
        <p>His ability to publish is also in jeopardy. The authorities had already barred publishers of some of his books from printing second editions despite brisk sales, severely limiting profits and royalties. This year, in large part because of Mr. Yu's impudent essays, the China Film Press, which published his latest book, has been closed down by the authorities for ''reorganization.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Yu also faces another, uniquely Chinese threat: now that he has left the university, he is ineligible for a Beijing residency certificate unless he secures a job. So he may be vulnerable to expulsion to his small hometown in Sichuan Province.</p>
        <p>Mr. Yu is the latest of several prominent intellectuals who are known to have been harassed. Liu Junning, a liberal political theorist, was dropped from the staff of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences earlier this year and had to resign as editor of his influential journal.</p>
        <p>He Qinglian, a journalist and economist who writes piercingly about corruption and inequities in the economy, was forced from her position as a columnist with a newspaper in the southern city of Shenzhen.</p>
        <p>Party leaders have privately called for the silencing of Qian Liqun, a senior professor of Chinese at Beijing University who has inspired many younger liberals, including Mr. Yu. So far, the university has resisted pressure to force him out, but other scholars are well aware of the attacks.</p>
        <p>Figuring that he has little to lose, Mr. Yu has decided to fight back. On Oct. 1 he released a defiant letter on the Internet, where it has been widely seen and discussed, and he plans to file a lawsuit against the writers association for breach of contract. A number of established scholars have signed a letter on his behalf.</p>
        <p>In his letter, Mr. Yu concludes: ''From this moment forward, it will not be I who feels terrified, but those thugs hiding in dark corners.''</p>
        <p>The other day in his apartment, a tiny, bright rental unit in a dank workers' block, Mr. Yu discussed the risks. ''I know that once my feud with the writers association becomes known, there will be some bad fallout,'' he said, ''and it's going to be hard for me to find a publisher for my books.</p>
        <p>''But I feel that improving the human rights situation in China has to start with each individual defending himself against violations. And I know my hardships are trifling compared with what many others have suffered since 1949,'' the year the Communists took power in China.</p>
        <p>The moral responsibility of intellectuals -- and what he regards as their general acquiescence in oppression -- has been a building theme in Mr. Yu's essays. ''In the face of China's blood-soaked history of the past century, each of us is guilty,'' he has written.</p>
        <p>An essay last year called ''Kundera and Havel -- What Choice Do We Make, What Burden Do We Assume?'' brought much debate. Since the 1980's, he argued, Chinese thinkers have been overly swayed by Milan Kundera, the Czech writer whose humor and irony were appealing but whose political stance is one of detachment. In contrast, Mr. Yu wrote, Vaclav Havel, the writer who became president of the Czech Republic, is a ''saint'' who has who always insisted that ideas must be matched by action.</p>
        <p>Some fellow liberals, including Professor Qian, said Mr. Yu's moralizing had gone too far, showing little appreciation for the suffering and terrible choices that scholars had endured. ''Can you yourself act like a saint?'' Professor Qian asked. ''Confronted with numerous violations of human rights in China today, have any of us raised protests as Havel did?''</p>
        <p>In his reply -- the exchange is published in his last book, ''Wings That Wish to Fly'' -- Mr. Yu freely admits that he has not gone to the ramparts. ''When I criticize others, the precondition is that I criticize myself,'' he wrote. ''Compared to the world's courageous, dauntless leaders of human rights -- for instance, Martin Luther King, Nelson Mandela, Lech Walesa, Vaclav Havel, Kim Dae Jung -- how shameful our silence is!''</p>
        <p>Mr. Yu defends his lack of political activity, saying he dislikes political parties and factions, which force one to compromise on values.</p>
        <p>He says he has been inspired by the brief flowering of thought that was allowed here in the late 1980's. But his own generation, Mr.Yu lamented, is more caught up in commercial pursuits and faces more stringent limits on expression. Intellectually, he said, ''I feel very lonely.''</p>
        <p>He showed another side in the apartment he shares with his wife, a former manager from Wuhan whom he met after she wrote to him saying she was inspired by his work. The screen saver on his computer is a picture of Audrey Hepburn, and the film ''Roman Holiday'' is a favorite, he admitted.</p>
        <p>One of his next major projects concerns what he regards as a crisis of faith among Chinese. But another, he said, will be a romantic novel, based loosely on the story of his own marriage.</p>
