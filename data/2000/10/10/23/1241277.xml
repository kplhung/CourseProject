        <p>Mike Richter made his return last night. A happy homecoming it was not.</p>
        <p>For the most part, Richter looked sharp enough in his first start in net since he underwent reconstructive knee surgery on April 5. But Fredrik Modin had Richter's number. And the Tampa Bay Lightning rode Modin's first career hat trick to a 4-2 victory over the Rangers, one night after having been embarrassed by the Devils, 7-2, in New Jersey.</p>
        <p>And so the Rangers' woes at home continue. They have not had a winning record at Madison Square Garden since the 1996-97 season. The Rangers, who have lost two straight at home, are 1-2 at the Garden this season.</p>
        <p>Last night marked the first of five games in eight nights for the Rangers, who received goals from Brian Leetch and Theo Fleury. The evening marked the Rangers' 124th consecutive sellout, but because of the World Series at Yankee Stadium, the Garden was about half full. Cheers went up every time a run went on the scoreboard in the Yankees-Mets game. The cheers were fewer for the Rangers, who outshot the Lightning, 34-22, in dropping to 3-3-0-0.</p>
        <p>Through two periods, Richter had stopped the 15 shots the Lightning had directed his way. But the Lightning had actually been credited with 16 shots. Rich Pilon accidentally kicked in the rebound of a Modin shot, which had hit the right post, for the game's first goal, 6 minutes 13 seconds into the second period.</p>
        <p>Tampa Bay led, 1-0, as the period neared its end. And after Pilon was assessed a game misconduct at 15:45, the Rangers were down to five defensemen. One of them, Leetch, had skated 11:45 of a possible 20 minutes in the first period because of seven power plays.</p>
        <p>Leetch was up to 21:10 of ice time by the end of two periods. But all that time paid off, because it was Leetch who tied the score, 1-1, at 18:32.</p>
        <p>He did so by jumping into a play with Mark Messier's line on the ice. Messier went to the right corner to retrieved Adam Graves's pass around the boards. Leetch, who had originally broken in on the rush, broke back in from the right point. Messier found Leetch in the right circle. Leetch's quick shot found its way through goaltender Kevin Weekes's pads. On their 19th shot of the evening, the Rangers had finally found a way to beat Weekes, who  defeated the Rangers four times last season.</p>
        <p>Weekes would gain a measure of revenge at the end of the period, however. He goaded Fleury into tapping his blocker.</p>
        <p>The tap was enough not only to incite Pavel Kubina into taking a run at Fleury (Tim Taylor jumped on Kubina and pummeled him in Fleury's defense), but also to get Fleury whistled for a slashing penalty, just nine seconds after Mike York had been called for interference.</p>
        <p>And so the Lightning, which went scoreless in seven power-play opportunities over the first two periods, began the final period with a 5-on-3 advantage for a possible 1:51.</p>
        <p>The Rangers, who had killed off an earlier Lightning two-man advantage, killed off all but seven seconds of this one, too. But Vincent Lecavalier, Tampa Bay's 20-year-old captain, fed a wide-open Ryan Johnson through the crease to set up Johnson's tap-in goal from just off the left wing post.</p>
        <p>And when Modin beat Richter from the right wing circle just as the penalty to Fleury was ending, the Lightning had scored on its first two chances of the final period to grab a commanding 3-1 lead.</p>
        <p>Fleury made amends midway through the period. First, the rejuvenated right wing drew a pair of penalties on the Lightning to give the Rangers a 5-on-3 advantage.</p>
        <p>Then, Fleury blasted a low one-timer from the left wing circle through traffic and past Weekes at 7:20 of the third.</p>
        <p>For Fleury, who scored just 15 goals last season, last night's goal was his fifth in six games. It was also his second power play goal; last season he scored one in 80 games.</p>
        <p>SLAP SHOTS</p>
        <p>BRIAN LEETCH played his 863rd game for the Rangers last night to pass JEAN RATELLE for fifth on the team's all-time list. . . . The Rangers were well represented at Game 1 of the World Series on Saturday night at Yankee Stadium. MARK MESSIER, BRIAN LEETCH, PETR NEDVED, DALE PURINTON, THEO FLEURY, VALERY KAMENSKY and SANDY MCCARTHY all made the trip to the Bronx.</p>
