      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The Mets have an unorthodox method of holding runners at first base. They station first baseman Todd Zeile about eight feet from the bag and in front of the base runner, sometimes obstructing the runner's view of the pitcher. Zeile may also feint toward the base, which often confuses the runner, so that even if the pitcher throws home, the runner sometimes reacts to Zeile's movement and retreats toward first.</p>
        <p>The Yankees discussed this in their team meetings Friday and changed the way their runners take leads at first base. Rather than lead off on a direct line toward second base, the Yankees determined that they would have their runners move a foot or so toward home. As the American League umpire Tim McClelland explained before Game 1, the runner establishes his own baseline, and it is the first baseman's responsibility to stay out of his way. ''He can stand out in right field if he wants to,'' McClelland said.</p>

        <p>The Yankees discussed this in their team meetings Friday and changed the way their runners take leads at first base. Rather than lead off on a direct line toward second base, the Yankees determined that they would have their runners move a foot or so toward home. As the American League umpire Tim McClelland explained before Game 1, the runner establishes his own baseline, and it is the first baseman's responsibility to stay out of his way. ''He can stand out in right field if he wants to,'' McClelland said.</p>
        <p>Manager Joe Torre of the Yankees discussed the issue with the umpires when the lineup cards were exchanged before Saturday's game.</p>
        <p>During the game, the Yankees had their base runners move forward so that Zeile also had to move forward, almost on the infield grass at Yankee Stadium. This affected Zeile's angle back to the bag and increased the chances he would interfere with the runner.</p>
        <p>The Yankees' attempt to cope with Zeile's jockeying promises to last throughout the World Series, and they struggled to implement their strategy early in Game 1. Tino Martinez, the first Yankee to reach base, did not move as far forward as the Yankees who followed him, and at one point Paul O'Neill turned and received some clarification from the first-base umpire as to what he could or could not do.</p>
        <p>Chuck Knoblauch was walked with one out in the third inning and took a lead, peering around Zeile to see pitcher Al Leiter. As Leiter began his motion, Zeile moved toward the base and Knoblauch followed him -- as Leiter threw home; Knoblauch's confusion was apparent.</p>
        <p>Knoblauch took a lead before the next pitch, and when Leiter began his motion, Knoblauch bolted for second, and he was picked off when Leiter threw to Zeile and Zeile threw to second for the tag. Entering last night, the Yankees were 9 for 21 in stealing bases against the Mets in the four years since they have held runners in this way.</p>
