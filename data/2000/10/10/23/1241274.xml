        <p>''You will never know, because I don't have the words to say, how hard she has worked, because I don't have the words to say,'' Mr. Clinton, his voice hushed and trembling, said at a rally here tonight at Hofstra University.

        <p>President Clinton flew into New York today to lend his assistance to the Senate campaign of Hillary Rodham Clinton -- and the presidential campaign of Al Gore -- traveling from one end of the state to the other as he denounced Republicans and declared that his wife and the vice president would assure the continuance of his policies once he leaves office in January.</p>
        <p>''You will never know, because I don't have the words to say, how hard she has worked, because I don't have the words to say,'' Mr. Clinton, his voice hushed and trembling, said at a rally here tonight at Hofstra University. ''This is the first time in 26 years that they're having an election and I'm not on the ballot. But I care more about this election than any one I've been involved in.''</p>
        <p>''I have never known anybody else in public life who had the combination of brains and heart and caring and tenacity and ability to imagine solutions and get people together and get things done than Hillary has,'' Mr. Clinton said, his hand thrust in his pocket, as he spoke over rolling rounds of applause. ''She will be a worthy successor to Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Robert F. Kennedy.''</p>
        <p>At that, the crowd -- which had interrupted Mr. Clinton's remarks with shouts of ''four more years'' -- rose to its feet. Mr. Clinton turned and tightly hugged his wife, as the first couple's daughter, Chelsea, applauded from her seat behind them on the stage.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton's appearance here came on what was by far his most active day of campaigning for his wife since she entered the race to become New York's junior senator a year and a half ago. It took him from Watertown, to Binghamton, to Long Island and, finally, to Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton appeared at four fund-raising events for his wife's campaign, including two at which he was joined by Mrs. Clinton: tonight's $50-a-head rally and an Elton John concert later this evening at the Hudson Theater in Midtown, where tickets went for up to $5,000 each. Mrs. Clinton's aides said that the president had raised about $530,000 for her campaign at the four events.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Clinton's trip today was not so much about raising money for his wife's campaign -- particularly given the expense associated with bringing a president to town to campaign for any candidate -- as it was a calculated escalation in Mrs. Clinton's strategy of casting the contest in sharp party terms. She pressed into service the elected official who may well be the single most popular Democrat in New York, to try to assure that, in the words of one aide, Democratic voters ''come home,'' and cast their ballots for her instead of her Republican opponent, Representative Rick A. Lazio, in two weeks.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton's rollicking and emotional introduction of his wife tonight seemed to be a tonic to Mrs. Clinton, who discarded her normally phlegmatic campaign speaking style and laced into her opponent.</p>
        <p>''My opponent goes around saying, 'Eight years is enough,' '' Mrs. Clinton said. ''The first time I heard it, I thought well maybe I had misheard. Eight years of a great economy, eight years of declining crime rates, eight years of improving education scores, eight years of expanding health care. Where is he living and who is he representing?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio, who spent the day campaigning upstate, attacked Mr. Clinton for leaving Washington to campaign for his wife, suggesting that he was neglecting his official duties to tend to his wife's political career. ''The Middle East burns and the president is flying around at taxpayer expense to campaign, as does Mrs. Clinton,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio's senior campaign adviser, Mike Murphy, said the president's appearance here would hurt the first lady because, he said, it would reinforce the feeling that Mr. Clinton was ''trying to shove his wife down their throats.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Murphy described the president's visit as ''a million-dollar gift from the government,'' questioning why federal taxpayers should be paying for Mr. Clinton's visit to help out his wife, and why local New York taxpayers should be paying for the security costs associated with a White House visit.</p>
        <p>''They are dragging the president and his imperial staff all over upstate New York, blatantly campaigning for his wife,'' Mr. Murphy said. ''We're talking about the million-dollar tab.''</p>
        <p>The White House press secretary, Jake Siewert, said that Mrs. Clinton's campaign was reimbursing the federal government for Mr. Clinton's trip, using the standard reimbursement formula that is used when Mr. Clinton makes a political trip. ''There's nothing official on this trip, so it's actually 100 percent paid for by the campaign,'' Mr. Siewert said.</p>
        <p>Although the purpose of Mr. Clinton's visit was to help his wife, there were times when he seemed equally preoccupied with the fate of Mr. Gore, who polls suggest is in a tougher fight against George W. Bush than his wife is against Mr. Lazio.</p>
        <p>At times tonight, Mr. Clinton sounded as if he were on stage with Mr. Bush during one of the presidential debates. He offered attacks on Mr. Bush that Mr. Gore had not offered during the actual debates.</p>
        <p>He said that Republicans had distorted Mr. Gore's position by asserting that he was in favor of confiscating guns from hunters, and he mocked the suggestion that voters should turn to Mr. Bush to end partisan wrangling in Washington.''In other words they would like to be rewarded for the problem they created,'' he said.</p>
        <p>President Clinton listed bills that had been passed by both sides under his administration, among them one that changed the welfare system, and said, ''The partisanship has come from the other side.''</p>
        <p>If Mr. Clinton's remarks indicated a subtext of concern about the race to determine his successor, he did not suggest any worry about the state of his wife's campaign against Mr. Lazio. ''You know, I've been on a tour of New York today,'' said the president, who is doing more campaigning on Mrs. Clinton's behalf on Monday. ''I hear the sound of victory everywhere I go.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton appeared with her husband on a day in which she was clearly tending to her political base in a state in which registered Democrats outnumber Republicans by nearly 2 million.</p>
        <p>She said that she welcomed an attack on her unsuccessful attempt to push through a national health care program during her first two years as first lady. Mr. Lazio raised the issue in a television advertisement last week. At a campaign stop upstate today, he said that the first lady's health care plan would have ''crushed New York health care.''</p>
        <p>If Mr. Lazio wants to ''talk about health care in the past, that of course is his choice,'' Mrs Clinton said. ''He can spend his time talking about health care in 1993 and 1994. I am going to talk about health care in this year and what I would do next year.''</p>
        <p>In a brief question-and-answer session, Mrs. Clinton said Mr. Lazio was critical of her health plan because he had nothing to offer in its place.</p>
        <p>''It is typical of the campaign that he has run,'' she said. ''For months now, he hasn't put forth any plans of his own. He hasn't talked about what he would do to improve health care or improve the upstate economy. He has run away from his own record. And I think it is a clear example of him having nothing to say and running a campaign of insults.''</p>
        <p>Once again, she spent Sunday morning appearing at black churches in the metropolitan area. Later, in Greenburgh, she received the endorsement of the Million Mom March, a group that applauded her stand on gun regulation. Mr. Lazio supports some controls on the sale of guns but, unlike Mrs. Clinton, he does not support the registration of new guns and the licensing of gun owners.</p>
