        <p>TURN for just a moment from Series to Subway.</p>
        <p>New York City's subway system is a phenomenon. According to New York City Transit, it moves more than 4 million people a day; covers more than 720 miles of track; operates, with buses, on an annual operating budget of $3.25 billion; accounts for much of the city's remarkably low energy consumption, and charges a maximum of $1.50 a ride.</p>

        <p>TURN for just a moment from Series to Subway.</p>
        <p>New York City's subway system is a phenomenon. According to New York City Transit, it moves more than 4 million people a day; covers more than 720 miles of track; operates, with buses, on an annual operating budget of $3.25 billion; accounts for much of the city's remarkably low energy consumption, and charges a maximum of $1.50 a ride.</p>
        <p>So, a question: when did you last hear either presidential candidate even mention the word subway, uncoupled from the World Series? Too parochial?</p>
        <p>O.K., when did you last hear either of them utter the phrase mass transit?</p>
        <p>Still too New York-centric? It shouldn't be, given the nationwide problems of air pollution and traffic congestion, an always looming oil crisis and the country's love affair with gas guzzlers.</p>
        <p>But this is silly, George W. Bush and Albert Gore are not going to talk about the A train, BART or the Loop. So we move on to a few more unmentionables, because what we are really getting at -- shamelessly using the Subway Series as a hook -- is the silence of both candidates on matters of particular importance to urban America.</p>
        <p>Some issues deemed worthy of their attention affect everybody: education, Social Security, tax policies, foreign affairs, the military, trust, character, campaign finances. But how about housing, including subsidized housing; the undesirable side effects of welfare revision (there are some); immigration, besides border control; the fate of public hospitals; the failure of the ''drug war''; the penal system; and, yes, traffic and pollution.</p>
        <p>None are exclusively city issues, but they are of particular concern to city residents. Hence, we don't hear much about them.</p>
        <p>Because cities no longer matter the way they used to. Census figures show that in 1998, the 100 largest cities (those with 185,000 people or more) made up less than a fifth of the country's population, and many of those cities are actually suburbs. The 40 largest cities, with populations of 400,000 or more (ranging from Fresno, Calif., and Atlanta to New York City) accounted for just 14 percent of the country.</p>
        <p>And that's population, not voters. Turnout in cities is lower than average because many residents are immigrants who cannot vote or do not vote in large numbers; generally, neither do blacks and Hispanics, who are concentrated in cities.</p>
        <p>Candidates want votes and increasingly those votes come from suburbia. The standard political calculus now assumes that 65 percent of the national vote is suburban or the social equivalent (for example, Staten Island in New York); 20 percent is urban and 15 percent is rural.</p>
        <p>''Democrats treat the traditional urban population as if were already in their camp and assume they can only antagonize people who are undecided by bringing up urban issues,'' said George E. Peterson, senior fellow at the Urban Institute in Washington. ''And Republicans are going more for the suburban vote.''</p>
        <p>Hence, the decline of the urban agenda, said Charles E. Schumer, New York's junior senator, adding, ''That doesn't just hurt urban areas, it hurts America.''</p>
        <p>It's also shortsighted. In a global economy, where a factory in China affects jobs in New Jersey, it is no stretch to presume that what happens in New York or Chicago or Los Angeles can influence what happens in suburbia. It is in Suffolk County on Long Island where immigrant workers have aroused resentment and even violence.</p>
        <p>THE presidential candidates realize that education concerns all parents.</p>
        <p>But the idea that no borders separate cities from suburbs has somehow not been applied to other issues. If it had, we might have heard a Gore-Bush exchange about federal housing vouchers for low-income people, or how to encourage the decline in the number of out-of-wedlock births among teenage girls, or how to reduce urban traffic and the waste of energy with tolls, night deliveries or, yes, mass transit.</p>
        <p>Nor do we hear about the long-term effects of the welfare overhaul. One would think there are only happy consequences. In fact social scientists worry that unless former welfare recipients who are now employed get food stamps or child care or job training, they will not move out of marginal jobs and may even backslide.</p>
        <p>''There are lots of things they don't want to discuss,'' said Robert I. Lerman, an economist at American University. ''My own view is that political leaders should raise consciousness so once raised, they can pick up on what seems to be a good idea and run with it.''</p>
        <p>Fine concept. Would work well in a campaign, no?</p>
