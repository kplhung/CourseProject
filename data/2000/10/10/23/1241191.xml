        <p>It was once music to get arrested by. But tonight it will ring through Avery Fisher Hall, where Charles Dutoit is to lead the Montreal Symphony Orchestra in a 75th birthday tribute to Mikis Theodorakis, Greece's foremost composer and scourge of the colonels of the Greek dictatorship from 1967 to 1974.</p>
        <p>His popular songs and music, including the scores for the movies ''Zorba the Greek'' and ''Z,'' were banned then, and Mr. Theodorakis spent much of his three years' of banishment in a remote village and in prison. A university student caught playing a Theodorakis record got an 18-year sentence, and, it was said, even a man who could not help remarking that a passing policeman was whistling a Theodorakis tune was arrested for listening.</p>
        <p>''This is a great victory for music, if they're so scared,'' Mr. Theodorakis (pronounced thay-uh-doe-RAHK-is) said last week, sipping tap water in a reception room off Peacock Alley in the Waldorf-Astoria, where he was staying with his wife, Myrto. He arrived from his home in Athens on Wednesday for the Lincoln Center concert, which features selections from his operas ''Medea'' and ''Antigone,'' his Adagio for winds and strings, the ''Song of Praise'' from his ''Canto Olympico'' commissioned for the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona, and scenes from the ''Zorba'' ballet with its pulsating bouzouki rhythms and soaring vocal parts.</p>
        <p>''He's the face of modern Greek music, a very fascinating man, as a musician and for his involvement in Greek politics,'' said Mr. Dutoit, who has led the Montreal Symphony in a number of all-Theodorakis concerts. ''He's a terrific composer, and people are only now getting to hear his concert works.''</p>
        <p>The orchestra is recording a new version of the ''Zorba'' ballet on Decca for release next fall.</p>
        <p>Mr. Theodorakis's famous shaggy mane shows touches of gray, and his eyes are shadowed under ledges of prodigious brows, but this landmark of a man known to his countrymen and fans around the world as ''Mikis'' is still easily recognizable in his robust, 6-foot-3-inch frame and ready chuckle. He has long since shaken off the tuberculosis he contracted as a leftist detainee during the Greek civil war of the 1940's that flared up 20 years later in prison.</p>
        <p>''I am perfect,'' he said, speaking through an interpreter in Greek, his replies sprinkled with English phrases.</p>
        <p>He remains fiercely unapologetic for his years as a Communist member of Parliament and his stunning if brief embrace of the conservatives in 1989. He was also sharply dismissive of those who see his music as too popular and folkish and somehow not serious enough. Reviewing the American premiere of Mr. Theodorakis's second opera, ''Elektra,'' in The New York Times in June, Allan Kozinn called the orchestration large and lush but said, ''Another image that came to mind was of being marooned in a seemingly bottomless tub of chocolate mousse.'' Mr. Theodorakis shrugs off the critiques. ''I compose for the common man, for our epoch,'' he said. ''The people are serious. I write for them.''</p>
        <p>Of his 900 songs, the trilogy of completed operas and orchestral pieces, ''only one or two are heavily drawn from from folkloric themes,'' he said. Rather, he said, his music reflected an eclectic mix of ancient Greek, Cretan and Byzantine influences, just as some world music today is blending Latin, Arabic and Asian traditions. He said he was not interested in writing deep music no one would listen to. ''This approach is what has driven symphonic music into a cul de sac,'' he said. ''It's of great value when nobody understands it.''</p>
        <p>It was with one eye on the unrest threatening Greek democracy in the 1960's and another on a movie script that he was scoring that Mr. Theodorakis sat down to compose a dance for the Nikos Kazantzakis character Zorba, in the 1964 Michael Cacoyannis production. He dashed it off in a day. ''My heart was not that much in the film,'' he recalled. ''The future of Greece was in my mind. That's why it came out so good.''</p>
        <p>He traced his Marxist politics to admiration for the Communist resistance against the German occupation in World War II. (At the same time, he said, it was a 1942 German movie of a concert of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony that impelled him to abandon the idea of becoming an architect and fasten on a career in music.)</p>
        <p>He said his affinity for the left grew as Greece turned into a cold war battleground, for which he largely blames not Stalin but the Central Intelligence Agency. In 1963 after a Greek leftist deputy, Gregoris Lambrakis, was run over and killed -- a story later told in the award-winning 1969 movie ''Z'' for which Mr. Theodorakis wrote the music -- he became the leader of a Communist movement named for Lambrakis.</p>
        <p>When rightist colonels staged a coup in 1967, Mr. Theodorakis was banished with his wife and young daughter and son to a guarded mountain village, Zatouna, in the Peloponnesus, and his music was banned. But he contrived to send out songs concealed in cans of honey and wheels of cheese and once smuggled out reels of recorded tapes disguised as buttons on his son's coat. Eventually the army sent him to the prison camp of Oropos, outside Athens.</p>
        <p>He remembers it as a happy time. ''I mixed with a lot of peasants, workers, artists and writers, all deprived of work,'' he said. ''That's when I understood human beings have an instinct toward knowledge.'' The illiterate learned to read and write, he said. Others studied foreign languages and other subjects.</p>
        <p>''A man who goes to jail for his ideas is much freer than his keepers,'' Mr. Theodorakis said.</p>
        <p>He was released in 1970 and flew to Paris, returning to his homeland after the fall of the junta. In a turnabout that stunned his countrymen in 1989, Mr. Theodorakis, attacking the Socialists for Greece's ''moral deterioration,'' spoke out for the conservatives, enraging, among others, his old friend the actress Melina Mercouri, who called him pitiful.</p>
        <p>''Yes, that hurt me,'' Mr. Theodorakis recalled. But he said, ''we later patched it up.'' He has since gone back to supporting the Socialists.</p>
        <p>He is busy, he said, dividing his time between Athens and Paris and finishing work on a fourth opera, ''Lysistrata,'' scheduled for a debut in Athens in 2002 and a performance at the Olympics in Greece in 2004. He is also working with Turkish artists to reduce longtime enmities with Turkey and end the uneasy partition of Cyprus in favor of some kind of a dualized state.</p>
        <p>Mr. Theodorakis has appeared at Avery Fisher Hall before, most notably in 1973, not long after his liberation from prison, when he came to perform his works, only to be confronted by a picket line of striking musicians from Local 802. Saying he had been waiting a long time for that moment, he crossed the line. He returned in 1988 for the American debut of his Third Symphony, also at Lincoln Center. Tonight's concert was put together by the North American Foundation for Modern Greek Arts headed by Mr. Theodorakis's friend Costas Spiliadis.</p>
        <p>Mr. Theodorakis said that if the Renaissance spread culture to the aristocracy, he had a modern update in mind. ''My dream is to turn Europe into 300 million princes,'' he said.</p>
