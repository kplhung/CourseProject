        <p>AL GORE  Remarks yesterday at the dedication of The Potter's House, a Pentecostal megachurch in Dallas:</p>
        <p>''An abundance of prosperity of the spirit can, of course, not be measured in dollars and cents. It reaches into all of our homes and our hearts. I speak of a richness not of material possessions but of virtues and values. I'm talking about strong family life in America, something more basic than all of our budget debates but somehow harder to achieve. I want you to know how deeply I care about strengthening our families. I want you to know that this is not just the heart of an agenda, it is the foundation of my life and my faith. . . .</p>

        <p>AL GORE  Remarks yesterday at the dedication of The Potter's House, a Pentecostal megachurch in Dallas:</p>
        <p>''An abundance of prosperity of the spirit can, of course, not be measured in dollars and cents. It reaches into all of our homes and our hearts. I speak of a richness not of material possessions but of virtues and values. I'm talking about strong family life in America, something more basic than all of our budget debates but somehow harder to achieve. I want you to know how deeply I care about strengthening our families. I want you to know that this is not just the heart of an agenda, it is the foundation of my life and my faith. . . .</p>
        <p>The center of my life is faith and family and I have a passion in my heart to fight for the families who most need a champion, those who wake up each day dedicated to their children, their churches and their communities, the families who need just a little bit more help to live out their own values and pass them on to the children they love with all their hearts. . . .</p>
        <p>I believe that we need to stand on the foundation of prosperity and make a new commitment to strong families and strong values all across America because they are the real strengths of America. . . . In too many schools discipline is eroding and many teachers spend their time on crowd control instead of reinforcing the lessons of good character and decency that parents need at home. There is a cultural pollution in our country that clouds family life with lessons presented more vividly that are overpowering many of those in the home and in the classroom. I believe that strengthening families means in part empowering parents to protect their own children from toxic entertainment that too often passes on the wrong values. We should speak out against it.''</p>
