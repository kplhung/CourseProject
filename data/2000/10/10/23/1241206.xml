        <p>In a raucous high school classroom a teacher has left a message on the board: ''Gone to kill myself. Hope you're happy!'' The teacher sent to replace her complains: ''I can't even get them to turn off their boom boxes. They're animals.'' He has no room to talk; he is being blackmailed by a pretty blond student with whom he has been in a compromising situation.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile a student with a future as the next Matt Drudge is terrorizing the faculty by posting satiric cartoons on her Web site, including one of a teacher with his head in a horse's rear end. She says she is protected by the First Amendment and knows she won't be sued, anyway. ''Sure, you're going to go out and hire a lawyer on a teacher's salary,'' she tells one of her victims.</p>
        <p>The school in ''Boston Public'' may look achingly familiar, with its institutional green walls and rows of lockers. But beneath its conventional surface, David E. Kelley's daring, lively new series charts nothing less than a reversal of power from the days when teachers held it all. The student's Web site is more than a high-tech way of scribbling insults on the blackboard. It symbolizes a new social order that Mr. Kelley has astutely latched onto, an information age in which the young have power and money yet need guidance as never before.</p>
        <p>''Boston Public'' becomes the third Kelley series on the air now, along with ''The Practice'' and ''Ally McBeal.'' Combining elements of both, it leans heavily toward the shrewd realism of ''The Practice'' yet includes touches of the ''Ally'' exaggeration and whimsy.</p>
        <p>And it relies on what Mr. Kelley does best: getting inside the minds of his characters. He manages that with deceptive ease by presenting the show from the teachers' point of view. We eavesdrop on problems that didn't exist a generation ago, as these teachers wonder how to handle gay-bashing and gripe about being hamstrung by a fear of lawsuits.</p>
        <p>A series needs characters and drama, of course, not just topics for discussion. Here ''Boston Public'' owes a great deal to Chi McBride, who plays the principal, Steven Harper, the most put-upon character. Trying to balance the policies that control chaos with a deep humanity that keeps him going, he deals with the school's enormous mix of races and classes, bullies and prima donnas (and that's just his staff). In a fury Harper is capable of pushing a belligerent student against a locker, though he is more likely to visit a student in the emergency room.</p>
        <p>Mr. McBride's official biography tries to wipe out his title role in ''The Secret Diaries of Desmond Pfeiffer'' (a recent debacle), and he goes a long way toward erasing that memory. His strong, engaging performance here makes even the most didactic lines seem real.</p>
        <p>And the first three episodes definitely contain too many rah-rah teachers' speeches. Jessalyn Gilsig fumbles with them as a social studies teacher who has flunked a football player. But Mr. Kelley never entirely loses his wit. The failing student answered the question ''Who is Abraham Lincoln?'' by writing, ''He invented the log.''</p>
        <p>Anthony Heald is wonderful as the punctilious assistant principal, mocked by students and faculty. We soon see that he has endearing loyalty to Harper.</p>
        <p>Other characters have yet to develop. Fyvush Finkel offers one-dimensional comic relief as a history teacher who could almost have been around in the days of the Founding Fathers. Loretta Devine, as the suicidal teacher who returns after she starts taking her medication again, turns this potentially rich personality into a caricature. ''Is there anything more magical than a classroom?'' she asks at the end of the third episode.</p>
        <p>The series hasn't conveyed that magic yet. But if ''Boston Public'' needs more time to find its perfect tone, it starts out as a brash, refreshing addition to the season.</p>
        <p>ALLY McBEAL  Fox, tonight at 9  (Channel 5 in New York)</p>
        <p>''Ally McBeal'' begins its new season with an appearance by Robert Downey Jr., who will return in several episodes as the object of Ally's obsession. He is such a solid, appealing presence, underplaying the role, that he immediately rights the show's tendency to become too cartoonish. He does that despite a plot trick that flops; if Ally (Calista Flockhart) doesn't glean what we do at their first meeting, she shouldn't even be handling a case in traffic court.</p>
