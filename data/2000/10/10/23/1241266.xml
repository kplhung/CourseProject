        <p>The absence of the unsigned center Jason Arnott forced Devils Coach Larry Robinson to look in all directions for the right player combinations on Saturday night. After several experiments, Robinson looked toward Russia and the Czech Republic, and he might have solved the puzzle.</p>
        <p>Robinson formed an all-Russian line, putting center Sergei Nemchinov between Sergei Brylin and Alexander Mogilny, and an all-Czech line, with Bobby Holik the center for Patrik Elias and Petr Sykora.</p>
        <p>The two lines played key roles in the Devils' 7-2 victory over the Tampa Bay Lightning at Continental Arena, and ended a two-game streak without a victory for the Devils (3-2-1-0). The six players combined for 11 points against a team that had scored five goals in each of its previous two games.</p>
        <p>''I don't think Pittsburgh has two lines like that,'' Brylin said of the Penguins, who are coached by the Czech Ivan Hlinka and have 12 players from the Czech Republic or Russia. The Devils have six.</p>
        <p>''Some teams have one Russian and one Czech line and we have one of each,'' said Brylin, who scored the Devils' seventh goal, with 39 seconds remaining in the second period. ''I like that. I think the lines worked well. We worked hard and we scored at the right time.''</p>
        <p>Robinson was especially pleased with his decision to put Holik between Elias, a left wing, and Sykora. Robinson said his decision was prompted by Holik's size -- he is 6 feet 4 inches, 230 pounds -- which is similar to Arnott's.</p>
        <p>Elias and Sykora played with Arnott last season on the team's premier line. It was Elias who dug out the puck in the right corner and fed Arnott for the goal that clinched the Stanley Cup in June.</p>
        <p>''Bobby is more valuable to us in that line,'' Robinson said, ''because he creates more chances and gives us more presence in front of the net because of his size.''</p>
        <p>Holik was the center for Steve Kelly and Randy McKay in the first five games, but Holik had little trouble adjusting to Elias and Sykora.</p>
        <p>''I'm better there as far as transition goes,'' Holik said of his new line. ''We play with a little more up-tempo. My job is to get the puck to them quickly.</p>
        <p>''They play their best when Arnie is there,'' he said of Arnott, ''and I try to do the same thing, which is give them the puck and go to the net.''</p>
        <p>Holik, who had just one assist in the first five games, set up the first two goals in the victory over Tampa Bay on Saturday.</p>
        <p>''We felt more comfortable and we played with more passion,'' Robinson said of his new lines. ''Our positioning was also 100 percent better.''</p>
