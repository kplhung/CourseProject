        <p>When Jimmy Johnson stopped by to visit Dave Wannstedt, his good friend and successor as Miami's coach, last week during Dolphins practice, he delivered a message filled with pride and a bit of envy: you are doing what I wanted to do last year -- playing defense, running the ball and not turning the ball over.</p>
        <p>The Dolphins are averaging 109 yards rushing, a higher average than they have finished with in any season since 1984, when they averaged 119 yards. Last season, the Dolphins had seven interceptions returned for touchdowns. They are tied for third in the league with a plus-7 take away/giveaway ratio. Jay Fiedler, who replaced the retired Dan Marino, has attempted only 140 passes, the fewest by a quarterback who has started every game this season.</p>

        <p>When Jimmy Johnson stopped by to visit Dave Wannstedt, his good friend and successor as Miami's coach, last week during Dolphins practice, he delivered a message filled with pride and a bit of envy: you are doing what I wanted to do last year -- playing defense, running the ball and not turning the ball over.</p>
        <p>The Dolphins are averaging 109 yards rushing, a higher average than they have finished with in any season since 1984, when they averaged 119 yards. Last season, the Dolphins had seven interceptions returned for touchdowns. They are tied for third in the league with a plus-7 take away/giveaway ratio. Jay Fiedler, who replaced the retired Dan Marino, has attempted only 140 passes, the fewest by a quarterback who has started every game this season.</p>
        <p>But when the Jets (5-1) and the Dolphins (5-1) play tonight at Giants Stadium, Jets Coach Al Groh knows the vacuum in which a coach operates during a game will be shattered by only one thing.</p>
        <p>''When you're really concentrating on the game, watching plays, making decisions, you don't really hear a lot of sounds,'' Groh said. ''Every once in a while, there are some collisions that break through that soundproof barrier. I think to myself, 'I heard that one.' I would imagine that with the way each of these teams will try to play defense, there will be a little bit of that.''</p>
        <p>The Jets-Dolphins rivalry was once renowned for its offensive theatrics. Marino should pay homage to the Jets when he is inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Four of Marino's nine highest yardage games were against the Jets, against whom he threw 72 touchdown passes. But with Fiedler in, the Jets' offensive inconsistency and quarterback Vinny Testaverde's pinched nerve, this game will now boil down to a defensive brawl between two of the best units in the National Football League. It is possible that the two teams combined may not rack up 521 yards -- Marino's passing yards against the Jets in a game in 1988.</p>
        <p>The Dolphins rank eighth in the league in yards allowed with 281.2; the Jets are seventh with 279.3 yards. But the Dolphins have allowed only 51 points, the fewest by an N.F.L. team over the first six games of a season since 1977. (For comparison, the Jets have allowed 103 points.)</p>
        <p>Of 16 trips inside Miami's 20-yard line this year, opponents have scored only three touchdowns and six field goals. That touchdown-allowed percentage of 18.8 is best in the N.F.L., and the three touchdowns allowed are the fewest allowed by a team in the first six games of a season since the 1977 Falcons gave up three.</p>
        <p>The Dolphins -- like the Jets -- are especially effective against the pass, because of a revived rush. Trace Armstrong, 35, who is not even starting, has 10 sacks this season. Two weeks ago against Buffalo, the Dolphins had six sacks, the second time they have done that this year. Armstrong had three and a half. Their 24 sacks are fourth in the league.</p>
        <p>The Jets will get a bit of a break because, although middle linebacker extraordinaire Zach Thomas is expected to play, defensive tackle Daryl Gardener, one of the Dolphins' best run stoppers, had back surgery Sept. 15 and will not play.</p>
        <p>The Jets, too, will be without one of their crucial players, defensive end John Abraham, who is out with an abdominal pull. His 4.5 sacks lead the Jets, who have 19 in 6 games, well ahead of the pace that made them one of the worst pass-rushing teams last season, with only 26 sacks.</p>
        <p>Improved as it is, the Jets' defense has frequently been in the shadow of its opponents': Buffalo, Tampa Bay and now the Dolphins. The Jets, of course, beat the Bills and the Buccaneers. And the Jets are ranked ahead of the Dolphins in total defense and in run defense, and have allowed an average of only 3.5 more yards passing per game.</p>
        <p>''I think we're better than what we've shown,'' Jets safety Victor Green said. ''If we can cut down on the big plays we've allowed, I think we can be up there with any defense.''</p>
