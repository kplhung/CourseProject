        <p>With charter schools -- public schools managed by private entities -- firmly established and multiplying, some of their advocates are floating a new idea: charter colleges.</p>
        <p>The aim, they say, is to free public colleges from excess regulation and to encourage innovation.</p>
        <p>Although officials in Massachusetts, Virginia and Colorado who have weighed the idea have encountered opposition, some conservative groups -- including the National Association of Scholars and the Empire Foundation -- are calling on New York to apply the concept to the State University of New York and the City University of New York.</p>
        <p>''Based on experience with charter schools, I strongly believe that a move toward charter colleges would unleash academic and administrative innovation and boost educational quality,'' said Thomas W. Carroll, president of the Empire Foundation and of Change-New York, a conservative advocacy group that backed Gov. George E. Pataki.</p>
        <p>More than 140 people, including presidents of a number of SUNY and CUNY campuses and some trustees and administrators, have signed up to attend a forum on charter colleges the foundation is sponsoring today at the University Club in New York City.</p>
        <p>How charter colleges might operate is unclear, since there are no formal proposals yet. But if they operated like charter schools, they would receive public money but hire their own managers, determine their own curriculums and even set their own faculty contracts, possibly abandoning tenure.</p>
        <p>The example cited most often as evidence that charter colleges can work is St. Mary's College in Maryland, a small, public, honors college that operates separately from the University of Maryland.</p>
        <p>Robert O. Berdahl, a professor emeritus at the University of Maryland College of Education who has studied St. Mary's, says part of what has allowed it to work is its small size, its specialized mission and its strong leadership.</p>
        <p>But, he cautions in a chapter in ''Seeking Excellence Through Independence: Liberating Colleges and Universities from Excessive Regulation,'' by Terrence J. MacTaggart &amp; Associates (Jossey-Bass Publishers, 1998), the approach may not work everywhere.</p>
        <p>Still, charter college proponents like Stephen H. Balch, president of the National Association of Scholars, would like to try the concept on some other campuses.</p>
        <p>Mr. Balch, who will speak in favor of charter colleges at the forum today, suggests groups of faculty members at SUNY or CUNY could be granted charters to offer programs like teacher education or a more rigorous liberal arts curriculum, and be permitted to use existing college facilities while remaining outside of those colleges administratively.</p>
        <p>''They would get a share of the college's budget and facilities based on their success in drawing students,'' Mr. Balch said. ''We wouldn't have to make any new capital expenditures here. As an experiment, it is something worth trying.''</p>
        <p>Thomas F. Egan, SUNY's chairman, said he might be interested. While SUNY's trustees have made some progress in increasing administrative autonomy and accountability for their campuses, he said, charter colleges may help further those goals.</p>
        <p>Candace de Russy, a SUNY trustee who heads the academic affairs committee, also favors the idea.</p>
        <p>But the idea is alarming to some administrators and professors at CUNY. Both CUNY's chancellor, Matthew Goldstein, and its chairman, Herman Badillo, rejected the idea of charter colleges for CUNY.</p>
        <p>''I understand the need for accountability, and we've been setting up procedures for greater accountability,'' said Mr. Badillo, who has been sympathetic to other proposals put forward by conservative interest groups. ''At least at City University, I don't think the idea of charter colleges is in any way relevant.''</p>
        <p>CUNY's faculty and staff union also opposes the concept, which it says is a way to privatize public education, subvert public control, limit public investment and end tenure.</p>
        <p>''At one level, this proposal is pure union busting,'' said Barbara Bowen, the president of the union, the Professional Staff Congress.</p>
        <p>And Assemblyman Edward C. Sullivan of Manhattan, who is chairman of the Assembly's higher education committee, called charter colleges ''a crazy idea'' offered by people who want to cut taxes and shrink government.</p>
        <p>''If they want to start a new college, who's stopping them?'' he asked. ''What they want to do is steal a college.''</p>
        <p>Some education analysts say higher education already offers far more variety than primary and secondary systems where charter schools are now operating.</p>
        <p>''The rationale given for charter schools was to increase choice,'' said Carl Carlucci, an expert on higher education policy and a former CUNY and SUNY professor and administrator who is serving as first deputy comptroller for New York State. ''But higher education in New York does not suffer from a lack of choice.''</p>
        <p>Even the governor's office seemed to be distancing itself. A spokesman for Mr. Pataki said no one from his administration planned to attend the forum.</p>
        <p>''Governor Pataki believes that New York has the finest public and private institutions of higher education in the United States,'' said the spokesman, Joseph Conway.</p>
