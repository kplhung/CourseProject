        <p>The National Council of Churches, a venerable but financially straitened organization that represents 35 Protestant and Eastern Orthodox churches, plans to seek an unusual meeting next year.</p>
        <p>The meeting, which would bring Christian leaders together across historical dividing lines, might even eventually lead the council into a broader, more diverse coalition if other Christian groups agreed.</p>
        <p>The proposed meeting -- to which Roman Catholics, evangelical Protestants and Pentecostals are to be invited -- has been discussed among the council's leaders, the Rev. Robert W. Edgar, its general secretary, said in an interview.</p>
        <p>The discussions have taken place as the council, now 50 years old, has  sought to right itself financially, after budgetary problems threatened to overwhelm it late last year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Edgar, who has been the council's top officer since January, said the organization balanced its budget during the first six months of the year and expected to do so for the second half. But the council has also cut its staff by 30 jobs, some of which had not been filled, and now employs about 70 people, he said. And a statement released by the council earlier this month said it projected that expenses would exceed income during the first half of 2001.</p>
        <p>Speaking of the proposed meeting, Mr. Edgar, who was previously the president of the School of Theology in Claremont, Calif., and, before that, a congressman from Pennsylvania, said, ''This is the time to ask ourselves the hard questions about what the ecumenical movement needs to propel itself into the future.''</p>
        <p>He said the council, which has member churches representing more than 50 million congregants, drew inspiration from examples of collaboration among churches at the local level. ''What is the national equivalent of that, and how should it be shaped?'' he asked.</p>
        <p>The council's leaders, he said, were agreed that ''our purpose of being is not to keep the National Council of Churches alive in its current form,'' but to be open to working with other major church groups.</p>
        <p>Still, the challenge lies in trying to bring together people who disagree, often strongly, on issues of ecclesiastical structure and biblical interpretation and how the church should interact with society. ''How do you have common ground?'' Mr. Edgar asked. ''And our feeling is, we ought to have a simple agenda.''</p>
        <p>One idea, he said, would be to unite Christian churches in a decade-long campaign to alleviate poverty.</p>
        <p>An official at the National Conference of Catholic Bishops said the conference would consider attending the meeting after it received a formal invitation.</p>
        <p>The Rev. Richard Cizik, vice president for governmental affairs of the National Association of Evangelicals, said he believed some evangelicals would have serious reservations about his association's participation in a meeting called by the council. The concern, he said, would stem from fear that any plan for formal collaboration might entail pressure on evangelicals to compromise their theological beliefs. But Mr. Cizik said that if the meeting focused on ''a single issue of public concern,'' rather than ''ecumenical cooperation in general,'' it might be more acceptable to the association's members.</p>
        <p>''I think everybody is looking toward a future in which, on issues of common concern, we can rally together,'' he said. ''That's a different spirit among evangelicals than may have been present in the past.''</p>
        <p>In the last two years, along with its financial strains, the council has enjoyed an unusually high public profile. In 1999, it helped organize a mission to Yugoslavia, with the Rev. Jesse Jackson, to persuade the Yugoslav government to free three American servicemen captured during the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's bombing of targets in Kosovo.</p>
        <p>Later, the council sided with Cuban churches in advocating the return of Elian Gonzalez, the 6-year-old boy who survived a raft trip to Florida, to his father in Cuba.</p>
        <p>Still, the council was deeply shaken last October by a decision by the United Methodist Church to freeze its contributions to the organization temporarily until the council had a plan to stabilize its finances. The Methodists contribute about 40 percent of the approximately $1.5 million donated to the council by its member churches.</p>
        <p>According to a council document covering the years 1997 to 2000, most contributions came from only the Methodists, the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) and the Episcopal Church. Of the 32 other members, 10 have given nothing and 9 have given sporadically. Mr. Edgar said the council was trying to encourage those churches to contribute regularly.</p>
