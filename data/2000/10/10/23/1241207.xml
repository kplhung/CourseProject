        <p>At around 1 o'clock on Friday afternoon, word swept through the cavernous halls housing the 52nd annual Frankfurt Book Fair that Thomas Middelhoff, chairman and chief executive of Bertelsmann A.G., had arrived to tour the fair.

        <p>At around 1 o'clock on Friday afternoon, word swept through the cavernous halls housing the 52nd annual Frankfurt Book Fair that Thomas Middelhoff, chairman and chief executive of Bertelsmann A.G., had arrived to tour the fair. Executives of Bertelsmann businesses, from its German printing operations to its mammoth Random House publishing group, hurried to their stations to prepare for a visit from the chief.</p>
        <p>Even Sonny Mehta, the famously reticent editor in chief of the prestigious Knopf imprint, was on hand, at the Random House pavilion, for a little banter with the boss. ''Sonny, since you stopped smoking, you are looking so healthy,'' Mr. Middelhoff told him.</p>
        <p>''Well, I still smoke a little,'' Mr. Mehta replied. ''I keep my hand in -- you never know when you might have to take it up again.''</p>
        <p>Striding through the crowds in his buttoned-down, dark blue double-breasted suit, Mr. Middelhoff, 47, cut a singular figure amid the cigarette smoke and rumpled wool. The Frankfurt Book Fair is at heart a marketplace for trading rights to translate books and sell them around the world. It is a relic of the days before e-mail, fax machines and Federal Express, when publishers saved up books all year to take with them to Frankfurt. Mr. Middelhoff, on the other hand, represents a decidedly 21st century vision of the book business, and not everyone at the book fair liked the way it looks.</p>
        <p>Mr. Middelhoff is without a doubt the most powerful man in international book publishing. Long the largest publisher in Germany, with about 10 percent of the book market, Bertelsmann two years ago became the largest in the world by acquiring Random House, gaining about 15 percent of the United States trade book market. In April, its myriad European and Latin American publishing units will be integrated into a single company, folded in under the Random House name and the direction of Random House's chief executive, Peter Olson.</p>
        <p>And publishing is just one of Bertelsmann's angles on the book business. Bertelsmann sells to publishers through its printing, technology and distribution divisions. And Bertelsmann is its own publishers' best customer, too, through its book clubs and online stores.</p>
        <p>All this gives Mr. Middelhoff reason to crow a bit. ''You know, it really is my fair,'' he joked, ''It is the Bertelsmann Book Fair.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Middelhoff came to his first Frankfurt fair in 1987 as a salesman -- the president of Bertelsmann's printing company, selling services to publishers. This year he was the fair's biggest buyer. Bertelsmann's sale of its stake in America Online Inc. has left him with more than $12 billion. On his shopping list, he said, are European book publishers, music companies around the world and Internet companies that can sell books and music directly to consumers.</p>
        <p>But not everyone is happy with Bertelsmann's growing clout. Although consolidation of the book business is old news in America, many European publishers and bookstores still see it as a dangerous contamination they hope to stop at the borders. As Bertelsmann's publishing companies around the world adopt the Random House brand name and begin reporting to New York, many fret that this German company will Americanize their literary cultures, and Random House's Mr. Olson spent a good part of this week reassuring the world about his respect for local editorial autonomy.</p>
        <p>At Frankfurt, Bertelsmann's position astride the Atlantic was already stirring anxieties about the international market for publishing rights. Germany remains by far the largest foreign market for American books. But the German publishing business is dominated by small publishers, which now worry that the cream of the rights market will trade via the interoffice mail of international companies like Bertelsmann.</p>
        <p>''By the time I hear about a book, the editors at the German sister company have already read the manuscript,'' said Michael Kruger, publisher of the highly regarded German house Hanser.</p>
        <p>That is the idea, Mr. Middelhoff said. Years ago, the rival German publisher Hoffman &amp; Campe began publishing German editions of John Grisham's novels, he said as he passed its booth, even though Bertelsmann's Doubleday unit publishes Mr. Grisham in the United States. ''That would not happen today, I think, with Peter as head,'' Mr. Middelhoff said. For his part, Mr. Olson said such cooperation remained ''purely voluntary,'' noting that authors' agents also have a say in the sale of foreign rights.</p>
        <p>German and other European publishers feel under siege on another front as well. Many European countries, trying to help small local bookstores compete with large chains, prohibit retailers from discounting books below the cover price. Germany has about 5,000 bookshops, four times as many per person as the United States. Many small German publishers see fixed book prices as a matter of life and death. They fear that deeply discounted best sellers would steal sales from other books, and they worry about fighting for attention and prominent shelf space in superstore chains.</p>
        <p>''Because of fixed prices, we have more bookshops, more publishers and we are able to publish more books,'' said Michael Naumann, Germany's culture minister and the former publisher of the Verlagsgruppe Georg von Holtzbrinck Group's Henry Holt &amp; Company imprint in the United States.</p>
        <p>At the fair last week, Mr. Naumann said the German publishers had so far successfully fended off attempts by the European Union to deregulate book prices in the name of free trade. But they face a new and more stubborn threat from Internet booksellers like Bertelsmann's Bol.com or BarnesandNoble.com, in which Bertelsmann owns a 40 percent stake. Such online stores almost inevitably sell across borders and often discount deeply, and even Mr. Naumann concedes that this could be a problem. Bertelsmann's official position, Mr. Middelhoff said, still supports the German book stores.</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Middelhoff noted that growth in the book market has flattened in Germany, as it did in the United States a few years ago, putting some German publishers in a tight spot. ''In Germany now, we will be going through a phase of consolidation, no question,'' he said. ''The German publishers will have what the American publishers did in the past.''</p>
        <p>Nearing the end of his tour, Mr. Middelhoff headed to the hall devoted to digital publishing and electronic books, where the air hummed with the din of dozens of small printing machines. A handful of companies had installed on-demand printing machines that spat out single copies of paperback books on request. At the booth run by another Bertelsmann unit, a two-month-old machine about the size of a Volkswagen Beetle was turning out hardcover books. It is the first machine capable of producing affordable, single-copy hardbacks as well as paperbacks. The German author Bruno Jonas was standing by, signing copies of his new book almost as fast as they flew off the machine, which can turn out about 1,000 copies an hour at a cost of about $7 apiece.</p>
        <p>''This is powerful,'' Mr. Middelhoff said. ''It is a real advantage to have this technology combined with an online bookstore. This is the advantage of having printing and distribution services, content and direct-to-consumer in one company.''</p>
        <p>What will the instant digital transmission of print-on-demand books around the world mean for the Frankfurt Book Fair, the sale of foreign rights or national price controls on the sale of books? ''The Internet has changed everything dramatically in all consumer products,'' Mr. Middelhoff said. ''We will probably see new forms of worldwide marketing and publicity.''</p>
