        <p>THE Hughes Electronics Corporation has an identity crisis.</p>
        <p>Since 1994, when the company began developing its direct-broadcast satellite operations, Hughes has been quietly transforming itself into a consumer concern that beams more than 200 television channels to about 10 million homes and businesses worldwide. But if you ask average investors what Hughes is well-known for, two things generally come to mind: airplanes and Howard, the eccentric billionaire who founded the company.</p>
        <p>Now Hughes, which is based in El Segundo, Calif., has a makeover in the works. Starting today, the company is embarking on an advertising campaign to dispel the notion that Hughes is anything like the stodgy military contractor and aerospace concern it used to be. Instead, the company's businesses, which include DirecTV, PanAmSat, DirecTV Latin and Hughes Network Systems, will be combined under one simple name, Hughes.</p>
        <p>''DirecTV has a well-known brand image that people don't associate with Hughes,'' said its chief executive, Michael Smith.</p>
        <p>Indeed. And Mr. Smith wants to change that.</p>
        <p>DirecTV, one of the largest providers of pay television in the United States, is the jewel in Hughes' stable of properties, kicking in about two-thirds of the company's revenue. It has only been since the early 1990's that Hughes, which was acquired by General Motors in 1985 for $5.3 billion in cash and stock, seized the idea of turning its satellite operations into a consumer-oriented business. With the recently completed sale of its satellite-making operations to Boeing, Hughes is nearly out of the manufacturing business altogether and devoted to delivering programming via satellite.</p>
        <p>For its coming out, Hughes' ads show a tan, fit runner crossing fields and beaches, making his way up a steep slope to a mountain top. ''The first one to the future has the best view,'' reads one ad, a runner's dark silhouette against a blue sky. The idea for the new brand campaign was in the works for 10 months, said Mr. Smith. Then executives and a raft of consultants even considered changing the name of the company, compiling a list of 200 possibilities.</p>
        <p>Planet Hughes, said Mr. Smith, was a favorite of one executive. That didn't fly. Nor did the 40 other names submitted by employees, who Mr. Smith said were offered a DirecTV satellite dish if management adopted their idea.</p>
        <p>The new campaign comes at an interesting time for Hughes. The company has been reviewing strategic alternatives in an effort to increase the value of Hughes stock to its shareholders. Most recently executives at General Motors said they would consider a joint venture or merger, even an outright sale. To reflect the performance of the unit, G.M. issued a Hughes tracking stock after buying the company, although it holds the majority of voting rights.</p>
        <p>While an outright sale seems unlikely at this point, Hughes is considering potential partners in three different areas: direct broadcasters and competitors of DirecTV, media companies, and Internet or broadband concerns. The most logical choice, say stock analysts, would be a media concern. Rupert Murdoch, chairman of the media giant News Corporation, recently held talks with executives from Hughes, expressing interest in DirecTV, said people close to those discussions.</p>
        <p>So is Mr. Smith dressing up Hughes' overall image as a media concern so he can command a higher price from an acquirer or future partner? ''That has nothing to do with it,'' Mr. Smith said. But, in effect, it does. Analysts have said that if more investors recognize Hughes as a player in the lucrative content-delivery business that competes directly with cable companies for subscribers, that could well translate into a higher stock price.</p>
        <p>Recently, the activist investor Carl Icahn bought shares of General Motors; at the time, analysts said that he thought DirecTV's real value was underrepresented in its stock price. He sold the G.M. stock once the company disclosed his activities.</p>
        <p>Still, Hughes has streamlined and returned to its roots, said Mr. Smith. Howard Hughes, early in his career, was a movie producer and investor in media properties, including RKO studios, who socialized with Hollywood glamour icons like Jean Harlowe and Jane Russell.</p>
        <p>In 1924, at age 24, Mr. Hughes also became the sole owner of the Hughes Tool Company, a division of which became the Hughes Aircraft Company. That business was spun off in 1953 and eventually evolved into Hughes Electronics.</p>
        <p>According to the company's history, Hughes Aircraft was designed to modify state-of-the-art military aircraft for racing. Never mind that Mr. Hughes actually made few airplanes and is best remembered for the Spruce Goose, which flew only once, for less than a minute. The company's reputation as an airplane manufacturer stuck.</p>
        <p>That is what Hughes is trying to change with its new campaign.</p>
        <p>''We are trying to dispel the old image,'' said Mr. Smith. ''This is not the company General Motors bought.''</p>
