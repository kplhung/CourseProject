        <p>Mike Piazza was confused, desperate for an answer that he never got. His teammates were alternately puzzled or enraged. The Mets had added incentive to beat the Yankees' Roger Clemens in Game 2 of the World Series last night at Yankee Stadium, and their emotions worked against them after Clemens picked up a piece of Piazza's broken bat and flung it toward him in the first inning.</p>
        <p>Piazza stared at Clemens for a moment, then walked slowly toward him, screaming, ''What's your problem?''</p>
        <p>''I kept asking him, and he really had no response,'' Piazza said. ''I was taken aback.''</p>
        <p>Piazza uses thin-handled bats, which break easily, but he said he could count on one hand the number of times he had hit a ball and had no idea where it went. When he fouled off Clemens's 1-2 pitch and saw his bat shatter, Piazza said, he was disoriented and had no clue where the ball was.</p>
        <p>''Ninety percent of the time, Mike hits that ball foul, knows it's foul and he's running anyway,'' first baseman Todd Zeile said after the Yankees' 6-5 victory.</p>
        <p>Some of the Mets in the dugout were trying to find the ball, and they were shocked when they saw Clemens whip the bat toward Piazza, whom he beaned on July 8. When Piazza started walking toward Clemens, the rest of the Mets followed his lead.</p>
        <p>''You have to protect your teammate,'' Zeile said, ''but I don't think anyone intended to have a melee at that point. And I don't think there was any malice on Roger's part toward Mike.''</p>
        <p>Piazza appreciated his teammates' charge toward Clemens.</p>
        <p>''My teammates have always supported me,'' he said. ''If they thought it was intentional, they came out to make sure that I wasn't in a vulnerable situation, being among their team. That's usually the protocol when it comes to something like that. But I was kind of waiting for something more. If he was throwing the bat at me intentionally, you're going to keep an aggressive manner.</p>
        <p>''It was bizarre. I can't really describe it. The bat kind of came back at me that way. I was obviously a little bit angry.''</p>
        <p>Clemens said he did not hear Piazza asking him what his problem was, and he said he did not intend to hit Piazza with the bat and was simply throwing it toward the Yankee batboys. But many of the Mets were not sure.</p>
        <p>John Stearns, the bench coach, who was especially incensed at Clemens in July, was the first Met out of the dugout after Clemens threw the bat. Yankees Manager Joe Torre said Stearns looked as if he ''wanted to choke everybody.''</p>
        <p>''I've never seen anything like that before,'' Stearns said. ''I don't know what he was doing. I don't know what was on his mind that would cause him to pick up a bat and throw it at Piazza. It was a real shock to everyone.</p>
        <p>''He'd better check what's going on. I don't know what's going on with him. That was a shock -- I know it shocked Mike. A guy just drilled our guy the last time we faced him; now the next time he goes and picks up a bat and throws it at him?</p>
        <p>''At some point in time, how much can you tolerate with this guy? It's a little upsetting.''</p>
        <p>Other Mets were just as disturbed as Stearns, and some were surprised that the home plate umpire, Charlie Reliford, did not eject Clemens.</p>
        <p>''Why else would you grab a bat and throw it that way?'' said reliever Dennis Cook, a Texan. ''Roger is from Texas, but I'm having a hard time with this. I wonder what Charlie was looking at. The way I've seen it, I've been thrown out of games for throwing inside.''</p>
        <p>Reliever John Franco said: ''It's bad for baseball. I see some kid sitting at home and you've got one of the best pitchers in baseball doing that. What are you teaching kids in America? It's O.K. to throw the bat?''</p>
        <p>But for all their strong words, the Mets did not retaliate with punches or knockdown pitches last night. ''This is the World Series; you can't do that,'' catcher Todd Pratt said. ''Our goal was to beat Roger, not to retaliate.''</p>
        <p>General Manager Steve Phillips said he was baffled by Clemens's action but said he never thought the situation would get out of control.</p>
        <p>''I think the guys understand we can't let it get ugly,'' Phillips said. ''We can't afford to lose anybody for the Series, and I think the Yankees feel the same way.''</p>
        <p>Before the game in which he beaned Piazza, Clemens was 1-4 with a 9.10 earned run average in five career starts against the Mets. That futility against them culminated in June, when he lasted five innings and allowed eight runs, four coming on a grand slam by Piazza.</p>
        <p>The Mets owned Clemens, and Piazza was their best producer, with 7 hits in 12 career at-bats off him. Those facts provided Manager Bobby Valentine with a causal link to Clemens's July beanball.</p>
        <p>''We've handed his lunch to him every time we've played him, so the first hitter he throws at his head, the third hitter he throws at his head, and the fourth hitter he hits him in the head,'' Valentine said then.</p>
        <p>If it has been intimidation or simply better stuff, Clemens dominated the Mets that night, allowing two runs in seven and a third innings. He was even better last night, tossing eight shutout inning and giving up only two singles, both to Zeile. He is 2-0 with a 1.17 E.R.A. against the Mets in his last two starts against them.</p>
        <p>''I don't feel like there's any sense of intimidation,'' Zeile said, trying to explain Clemens's new-found mastery of the Mets. ''If anything, he used our aggressiveness against us. Whenever you want to get to somebody so bad and get the big home run or the big hit, you have a tendency to go out of your game plan.''</p>
