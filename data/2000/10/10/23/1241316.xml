        <p>Roger Clemens threw fastballs that reached 99 miles an hour, but drew even more attention for firing a broken bat in the direction of the Mets' Mike Piazza last night, pitching eight shutout innings and heightening the emotions of the Subway Series that is being controlled by the Yankees.</p>
        <p>Facing Piazza for the first time since hitting the Mets catcher in the head with a fastball in July, Clemens sparked an astonishing bench-clearing incident in the first inning by hurling the broken bat. But Clemens retreated to a private room in the clubhouse, refocused and continued his recent postseason domination, allowing only two hits and striking out nine in a 6-5 victory over the Mets in Game 2 of the World Series at Yankee Stadium. The Mets rallied to score all their runs in the last inning, but now the Yankees have won when facing the Mets' two best pitchers -- Al Leiter was their Game 1 starter -- and lead the four-of-seven-game Series by two victories to none, extending their record streak of World Series victories to 14.</p>
        <p>The Mets are in serious trouble, and will try to regain their footing in Game 3 at Shea Stadium tomorrow night, when Rick Reed will pitch against the Yankees' Orlando Hernandez, who is unbeaten in postseason play. The Mets must win four of the next five games against the Yankees, who have won six of their last seven games.</p>
        <p>Clemens shut out Seattle on one hit in Game 4 of the American League Championship Series nine days ago, and in his last two games, opposing hitters are 3 for 55 (.055) against Clemens, with 24 strikeouts.</p>
        <p>But Clemens and his manager, Joe Torre, became animated when questioned after the game about Clemens's intent when he threw the bat at Piazza. ''There was no intent there,'' Clemens said repeatedly.</p>
        <p>Torre said: ''It was just emotional. Should he have done it? No.''</p>
        <p>Clemens's beaning of Piazza three and a half months ago has hovered over this Series, and although Torre has accused the news media of reopening the wound in the last week, the Mets' hostility toward Clemens has never really dissipated. Everything Clemens did last night would be seen by the Mets through the prism of that incident in July.</p>
        <p>Some of the Yankees had been concerned about Clemens's mood after a week in which the beaning was revisited time and again, and some of them tried to pump him up during the day. Clemens wore linebacker's eyes to the mound. He wears a mouthpiece when he pitches, and his lower jaw was locked, his chin pushed forward, except when he cursed, either at himself or the batter, or at no one in particular.</p>
        <p>Timo Perez faked a bunt on Clemens's first pitch and Clemens breathed two words, one syllable apiece, verbal aggression. He shook his head between pitches, talked aloud, his inner frenzy and his fastball both gaining speed. He struck out Perez with fastballs, all of them 97 m.p.h., and twice he threw 98-m.p.h. fastballs to Edgardo Alfonzo, before finishing off the second baseman with a 94-m.p.h. splitter -- a stunning speed for that diving pitch.</p>
        <p>Piazza was announced as the next hitter and the crowd of 56,059 roared, the culmination of 106 days of anticipation for the first confrontation between the two men since Clemens beaned Piazza on July 8. The pitcher pumped two fastballs for strikes. Then, after throwing a ball out of the strike zone, Clemens fired inside, shattering Piazza's bat into at least three pieces.</p>
        <p>The ball went foul and the barrel of the bat bounced toward Clemens, who fielded it as he would a grounder, then turned and fired the fragment sidearm toward Piazza, the bat head skimming and skittering along the ground just in front of Piazza.</p>
        <p>Piazza was stunned, and he turned and stared at Clemens, moving toward the pitcher, turning the bat handle in his hand, stepping across the base line. The Mets coaching staff and players immediately rushed from their dugout. Clemens held his hand up, as if to ask the umpire for a new ball, but then came face to face with Piazza, appearing to tell Piazza that he thought the barrel was the ball.</p>
        <p>Piazza said in July that he had lost respect for Clemens, and having just seen a bat go flying across his path, Piazza was stunned. He shouted at Clemens, asking him what his problem was. Then the Mets' bench coach, John Stearns -- who had tried to confront Clemens the day after the beaning -- bulled his way toward the pitcher, screaming. The two hordes of Yankees and Mets were bunched together, some pushing, the group turning slowly, like a satellite image of a hurricane.</p>
        <p>Torre grabbed Stearns, who used to play for him, and tried to calm him down, and gradually, as Clemens and Piazza were separated, the situation came under control without punches. But in his moment of anger or mania, Clemens heated those simmering emotions back to a full boil, by throwing a bat head and not a baseball. It felt surreal. After Piazza grounded out to second, the crowd was still murmuring while Clemens stopped and talked to the plate umpire, Charlie Reliford, explaining his actions.</p>
        <p>What he told Reliford is close to what he said after the game -- that he had thrown the bat without knowing where Piazza was, and when he looked up, he was surprised to see Piazza standing where he had thrown the bat. ''I had no idea that Mike was running,'' Clemens said. ''No idea.''</p>
        <p>Piazza was unsure, even after the game, about what happened, calling it bizarre. For an inning afterward, Mets Manager Bobby Valentine asked his players what had happened, because he hadn't seen Clemens throw the bat. There was no consensus, Valentine said, among his players, and Valentine said that if he had seen the incident, he might have handled it differently, asking the umpires for clarification on whether Clemens should have been ejected.</p>
        <p>But Valentine added: ''I didn't see one hitter who was intimidated. I hate to tip my hat to the guy with the good stuff, but he had great stuff tonight.''</p>
        <p>And Mike Hampton, the Mets' pitcher, struggled. Everybody was on edge now, and it wasn't as if  Hampton, the Mets' high-strung starter, needed any more emotions. Hampton finished off the National League Championship Series with a remarkable performance against the St. Louis Cardinals, and in the first inning of his first World Series appearance, he lost touch with the strike zone.</p>
        <p>He retired the first two batters and then walked David Justice on four pitches. He walked Bernie Williams on four more. Hampton threw another ball to Tino Martinez, and the Mets' pitching coach, Dave Wallace, went to the mound to settle Hampton.</p>
        <p>But Martinez lined a single to left, and Justice scored. Jorge Posada followed with a single on a 3-2 pitch -- one of 32 pitches Hampton threw in the inning -- and Williams scored. Rick White got up and started throwing in the Mets' bullpen.</p>
        <p>Hampton got out of the inning trailing, 2-0, but Scott Brosius homered to lead off the second inning, his first home run since Sept. 10, and only his second run batted in since then. Hampton continued to struggle, rushing his delivery, and Jose Vizcaino reached first on an error by  shortstop Mike Bordick.</p>
        <p>But Vizcaino was thrown out trying to steal second and later in the inning, Chuck Knoblauch was cut down at the plate.The game belonged to Clemens, whose raw stuff was as good as it was on Oct. 14, when he shut out the Seattle Mariners on one hit and struck out 15. He threw strikes with his first pitch to the first 10 batters he faced.</p>
        <p>Clemens went into the clubhouse after that first inning, and sat alone for more than five minutes. ''I knew I had to get control of my emotions quickly,'' he said later.</p>
        <p>The Yankees added another run in the fifth, on Paul O'Neill swung and pulled a looping line drive into the right-field corner, out of Perez's reach, and Martinez scored. Of the six runs scored by the Yankees against the Mets' left-handed starters, four of them were driven home by left-handed batters.</p>
        <p>The Yankees led, 6-0, in the ninth, and Clemens was removed, having thrown 112 pitches. But the Mets started creeping back, Piazza ripping a two-run homer off Jeff Nelson, and three batters after left fielder Clay Bellinger caught Zeile's fly ball at the fence in left, Jay Payton crushed a three-run homer off Mariano Rivera.</p>
        <p>The Yankees' closer finished the game, however, leaving the Mets to figure out how to beat the Yankees, and leaving everyone to wonder what the heck Clemens was thinking about when he caught Piazza's broken bat.</p>
