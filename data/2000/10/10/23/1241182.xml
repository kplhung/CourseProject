        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''City's Bilingual Education Debated at Spirited Meeting'' (news article, Oct. 18):</p>
        <p>My educational experience confirms that immersion is no secret but is the proven method for young children to learn a new language. I spoke virtually no English until I entered kindergarten with a teacher who knew no German. Now, at age 74, I speak both languages fluently and without an accent and can read even difficult German with about 90 percent comprehension.</p>
        <p>However, because I never had any formal training in German, I cannot write an important business letter.  Therefore, I suggest that total immersion be combined with rigorous training in the children's native language. The result will be that adults can speak without accents and write very well in both languages. This will also assuage parents' fears that their children will lose their native language.</p>
