        <p>It has been two years since a handful of ambitious start-ups began offering personal computers at no additional charge to customers willing to pay for several years of Internet service and, in most cases, to view a constant stream of online advertising. Only a few still exist.</p>
        <p>It is not surprising that Nick Grouf, chairman and chief executive of PeoplePC, resists comparison to those early trials. His company, founded in San Francisco a year and a half ago, may indeed offer personal computers along with Internet service for a three-year commitment. But from there, he insists, the similarities stop.</p>
        <p>For one thing, there is no forced advertising. And rather than sell its combination PC and Internet service solely to consumers, PeoplePC has found a niche in affiliate buying programs -- sales to corporations, which in turn sell the home computers to their workers at a fraction of the cost. So far, the takers include the Ford Motor Company, which is subsidizing a program that offers its 365,000 employees PeoplePC systems with Internet access and technical support. Delta Air Lines has undertaken a similar effort to get computers from PeoplePC into the hands of its 75,000 employees.</p>
        <p>More recently, PeoplePC signed an agreement to supply computers and Internet service to up to 300,000 workers at the National Trades Union of Singapore, a deal that could reach about 10 percent of Singapore's population. The New York Times Company has also signed a deal to offer  subsidized computers from PeoplePC to about 10,000 employees.</p>
        <p>PeoplePC says that the advantages of affiliate buying programs can be significant for corporations and employee groups, helping create a more technology-literate work force and improving workers' speed and efficiency by giving them access to company data. And then there is Mr. Grouf's personal goal of bridging the digital divide by putting PC's -- and, by extension, vital corporate information -- into the hands of more blue-collar workers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Grouf is no stranger to Internet start-ups, nor to the vagaries of the market. He ran Firefly, a so-called personalization software company that was spun out of M.I.T.'s renowned Media Lab and eventually acquired by Microsoft. Firefly's software performed ''collaborative filtering,'' meaning it helped recommend products to Web surfers based on other people's online preferences; Microsoft has incorporated Firefly's technology into its own online services.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Grouf came up with the idea for PeoplePC and went looking for cash two years ago, he had no trouble finding it, raising $65 million in venture capital from sources that included John Sculley, the former chief executive of Apple Computer who is now an investor; Access Partners, and Softbank Technology Ventures. As part of their deals with PeoplePC, Ford and Delta have also become investors.</p>
        <p>But competition is arriving quickly. As sales of personal computers slow, industry analysts expect affiliate programs to become an increasingly important channel for home computer sales, which typically have yielded low profit margins.</p>
        <p>Various computer makers are gearing up for the market, but so far the biggest threat for PeoplePC appears to come from Dell Computer and Gateway. In March, American Airlines said it would spend $15 million a year to offer Dell PC's and Internet connections to employees. Likewise, the energy company Enron chose Dell to supply similar systems to as many as 15,000 of its full-time employees for use at home. And in August, Gateway announced that it would provide PC's for up to 500,000 sales representatives for Avon. Toshiba has joined with AT&amp;T in an affiliate buying program aimed at companies with fewer than 1,000 employees.</p>
        <p>PeoplePC had initially planned to go public in early August. But the evolving competition, combined with the weakening market for Internet stock offerings, forced the company to delay its plans by a week and scale back its ambitions. The company did raise $85 million in a stock offering in mid-August, but the shares opened at $10 and ended the first day's trading at $8.88. Since then, the shares have declined further, closing on Friday at $3.06.</p>
        <p>Much of the market's wariness stems from the fact that the company is still losing money on each of its PC's, which are are made by Compaq, Hewlett-Packard, I.B.M. and Toshiba.</p>
        <p>As for Internet access, the company's other primary product, the company buys bulk access from other companies and resells it to PeoplePC users.</p>
        <p>The company does not project profits until 2003. In the six months ended June 30, the company reported revenues of $18.9 million and a net loss of $107 million.</p>
        <p>But analysts are optimistic about the company's announcement of its fiscal first-quarter results, planned for this week. Paul Marenbloom, a former senior analyst at Prudential Securities who recently joined CMGI, the Internet investment company,  circulated a Prudential report that called the PeoplePC's corporate deals ''large-scale, transnational opportunities.''</p>
        <p>Over time, selling PC's and Internet access is not how PeoplePC expects to make its money. The company expects profits to rise as more customers take advantage of PeoplePC's ''buyer's club,'' an online shopping mall that is able to offer big discounts by pooling customers. The buyer's club is available only through the Internet service offered by PeoplePC.</p>
        <p>About 100 online merchants have signed up to sell their products at a discount through PeoplePC's site, including E*Trade, Priceline.com and AtYourOffice .com. PeoplePC's share of the take varies from deal to deal.</p>
        <p>If the buyer's club takes off, it could add substantially to PeoplePC's bottom line. In the meantime, the company will continue to subsidize the cost of its service and equipment in the name of building market share.</p>
        <p>In the case of Ford, for example, PeoplePC charges $24.95 a month per contract, the same amount it charges individuals. Ford, in turn, charges its employees $5 a month, swallowing the remaining $19.95. But once PeoplePC's revenue from Ford employees surpasses its expenses, PeoplePC and Ford will evenly split any profits from the buyer's club that are generated by Ford employees. A similar deal gives Delta 20 percent of revenues from purchases made by its workers.</p>
        <p>PeoplePC engages in such profit-sharing only with Ford and Delta, said Wayne Gattinella, chief marketing officer for PeoplePC said, because the deals help those companies subsidize their employees' PC's.</p>
        <p>PeoplePC's strategy has its risks, not the least of which is that PC sales overall are beginning to slow after years of phenomenal growth. In 1999, PC sales increased 23.8 percent, to 45 million computers, up from 36 million in 1998, according to the International Data Corporation. But for the current year, IDC is projecting a growth rate of only 12.2 percent in the United States PC market.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Grouf sees opportunity in the fact that 49 percent of American households still do not have personal computers. And he says that more than half of all new customers are opting for higher-performing, higher-margin machines than basic models, meaning more profits for the company.</p>
        <p>PeoplePC's line includes basic machines with Intel Celeron 500-megahertz chips for $24.95 a month; higher-performing desktop models, and notebook computers that cost up to $85 a month. In PeoplePC's corporate deals, an employee who upgrades typically pays the difference between the basic model and the more powerful one.</p>
        <p>''Right now, we're in the 50-percent range of households,'' he said of homes that have personal computers. ''We think we can get to 60 percent to 70 percent, even 80 percent penetration in the next several years.''</p>
        <p>That of course, would be a lot more than the crop of free-PC vendors were able to achieve, even when they were giving away the computers.</p>
        <p>''I think they have a better shot at this market than anyone else we've seen,'' said Zia Daniell Wigder, a PC analyst at Jupiter Research in New York. ''But it's still a tough business model.''</p>
