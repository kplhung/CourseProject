        <p>A surfboard from the forgettable 1964 movie ''Ride the Wild Surf'' rests in a corner of one gallery at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Another gallery displays plaintive visions of Mexicans in California by 1930's muralists like Diego Rivera, Frida Kahlo and David Alfaro Siqueiros. A third shows harrowing photographs documenting the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II.</p>
        <p>Nearby are lavish impressionist-style paintings from the early 20th century of the breaking fog in Santa Barbara and the moonrise over San Diego Bay. Stark and emotional photographs by Dorothea Lange of Depression-era migrant mothers and factory workers are steps from a gallery displaying a 1998 Playboy magazine with ''The Babes of Baywatch'' on the cover.</p>
        <p>The culture of California -- from the serious to the silly, from the dynamic and the adventurous to the bigoted and the violent -- is the subject of an enormous landmark exhibition that opened today at the museum. Called ''Made in California: Art, Image and Identity, 1900-2000,'' the show is not only the largest in the museum's history but also perhaps its most provocative.</p>
        <p>The exhibition offers what the museum calls a revisionist view of the state and its cultural legacy, a legacy that has traditionally centered on the raw and lavishly beautiful vistas in the north, coupled with the Southern California world of sunny beaches, beautiful bodies and the glamour and tawdriness of Hollywood. Six years in the planning, the show also encompasses the art and the issues of the state's growing Latino and Asian populations as well as the political and social dynamism that gave rise to various movements in Northern California, ranging from the Black Panthers and hippie culture to gay rights. The exhibition also includes some of the more corrosive elements of California history, including photographs of 1,000 Mexican families being forcibly removed from their community in 1959 to make way for a new stadium for the transplanted Brooklyn Dodgers.</p>
        <p>''They're very brave to have taken on a more inclusive and expansive interpretation of California, and in that sense the show is remarkable,'' said Karin Higa, director of the curatorial and exhibitions department at the Japanese American National Museum in Los Angeles, at a private opening attended by artists and other professionals on Thursday night. ''It's bound to come under criticism because the more inclusive they are, the more you realize what's missing from standard exhibitions and interpretations of California art and culture.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Higa said that the Asian-American experience in California, generally ignored in other exhibitions, had been integrated into this one.</p>
        <p>Paul J. Karlstrom, a specialist in California who is regional director of the archives of American art at the Smithsonian Institution, said the show was bound to result in omissions and hurt feelings.</p>
        <p>''There'll be artists who'll be disappointed,'' said Mr. Karlstrom, based at the Huntington Library in Pasadena. ''That's inevitable.'' But he added that the museum's goal was all-inclusive.</p>
        <p>''Instead of gathering a list of the 100 great hits in California art history, it's trying to seriously examine what distinguishes the art and culture of this state,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Michael Dear, director of the Southern California Studies Center at the University of Southern California, said he walked into a gallery on the 60's in California and burst out laughing. ''A lot of people were laughing,'' he said. ''It was a vibrant display of beach culture, of the cars, all these things that comprised the 60's. There's everything there from high art to public art to stuff from the street, if you like.''</p>
        <p>What makes the show resonant, he said, is that it deals with the political, social and economic fabric of California as well as its art and culture.</p>
        <p>''Made in California'' includes more than 800 works of art -- paintings, sculpture, photographs, furniture and costumes -- and 400 documents, ranging from anti-Japanese propaganda posters from 1941 to a copy of the first paperback edition of Jack Kerouac's ''On the Road'' from 1958. Museum officials declined to discuss the cost of the project, which was underwritten by the S. Mark Taper Foundation.</p>
        <p>The show is divided into five segments, each covering 20 years. For visitors the dates that the exhibition will be up are a bit confusing. The first four sections, covering 1900 to 1980, opened today. The final section, covering 1980 to 2000, will open on Nov. 12. Although the closing date for most of the show is Feb. 25, the first section, 1900 to 1920, will remain up through March 18.</p>
        <p>Stephanie Barron, the museum's vice president for education and public programs and its senior curator of modern and contemporary art, acknowledged that the exhibition would probably stir debate.</p>
        <p>''Everyone will come with the expectation of what the show could be and should be,'' said Ms. Barron, who organized it. ''It's inevitable that we'll delight people at times and surprise them and confuse them and irritate them. But that's O.K. That's what an idea show is about.''</p>
        <p>As she spoke, she walked past a gallery displaying bathing outfits and zoot suits of the 1940's as well as the original Barbie doll. Not far away was David Hockney's classic canvas ''The Splash,'' one of that British-born artist's wittier images (circa 1966) of lawns and swimming pools.</p>
        <p>''There are two themes that seem to dominate the century in California,'' Ms. Barron said. ''One is the dialogue with the land, the beautiful rolling hills and majestic landscapes, or urbanism and suburbia or the blight. The other is California's ongoing relationship with Asia and Latin America.''</p>
        <p>She pointed to the unusual mix of video monitors that show archival films of figures as diverse as Mario Savio, the leader of Berkeley's Free Speech movement, to former Gov. Ronald Reagan to hippies congregating in San Francisco. Visitors can also view scenes from film noir set in Los Angeles. And then there are paintings by artists like Ed Ruscha, Billy Al Bengston, Edward Kienholz and Judy Chicago that seem to embrace -- and perhaps mock -- Southern California culture.</p>
        <p>One of her concerns, Ms. Barron said, was whether critics and the artistic community would accept a mix of high and low culture in a show in an established Los Angeles museum. ''Everyone was prepared to put up examples of fashion,'' she said, ''but it's a whole different thing to put a surfboard in there.''</p>
        <p>''It's going to be disturbing for some people,'' she added. ''On the other hand, I'm sure people who will be attracted to the popular-culture aspect of it might have a moment, I hope, to look at fine art.''</p>
        <p>The idea developed in 1994 when Ms. Barron, together with Ilene Susan Fort, curator of American art, and Sheri Bernstein, the show's exhibition associate, met with other museum officials to create a millennium project that would deal with the culture and image of Southern California. Meetings with historians, writers, architects and artists led the museum to expand the exhibition.</p>
        <p>The reason was simple: the San Francisco area dominated the artistic and social worlds of California in the early part of the century, and the social and political ferment there in the 60's and 70's influenced the state's -- as well as the nation's -- culture and politics.</p>
        <p>''The idea was to explore the image of California but not just the one that is known,'' Ms. Fort said. She added: ''We wanted to avoid the traditional boosterism promoted by the white culture and the white artists, especially in the early part of the century. We wanted to see other interpretations of California and how they differed from white myths.''</p>
        <p>The result is that some relatively unknown Asian, Latino and black artists and photographers are represented in the show, and some well-known Californians like Clyfford Still, Alson Skinner Clark, John Alton and Emerson Wolfler are not shown.</p>
        <p>''This is a thematic show; it takes risks, and people may not understand why we put in certain works of art but leave out others,'' Ms. Fort said.</p>
        <p>The show handles Hollywood culture as a glamour industry -- with photographs by George Hurrell of Norma Shearer and Joan Crawford, among others -- as well as a source of postwar political tensions, with newsreels of blacklisted writers appearing before Congress.</p>
        <p>Developing the show thrust the museum into new territory because the program was not shaped by one or two people, but by more than a dozen curators.</p>
        <p>Kevin Starr, a historian and State Librarian of California who served on one of the show's advisory panels, was an early opponent of focusing the show on Southern California.</p>
        <p>''To me this exhibit is exhilarating,'' he said. ''It challenges us to ask, 'Is there a California culturally?' '' Mr. Starr said that the cliche that California was culturally barren was absurd. ''The sheer range and variety of California is extraordinary, and that's what this show addresses too,'' he said. ''It has the sixth largest economy in the world. The state, in many ways, is the distilled essence and conflicts of America itself. This show is trying to reassemble the imaginative visual materials of California into some coherence. And that's a big challenge and a big task.''</p>
        <p>What gives the show additional significance, he said, is that it tacitly underscores the power of Los Angeles and Southern California over the rest of the state and perhaps even the nation. ''It bespeaks the maturity of Los Angeles and the dominance of Los Angeles in the cultural mosaic of California,'' Mr. Starr said. ''This is using a Los Angeles-based show to define the entire culture of the state. This was traditionally done by the Bay area. This is the first time that Los Angeles has, in fact, taken the lead.''</p>
