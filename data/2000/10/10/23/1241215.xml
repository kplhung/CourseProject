        <p>As the wedding day moves closer for America Online and Time Warner, it is worth asking whether this couple seems as right for each other as they did when the engagement was announced in January.</p>
        <p>As in many engagements, the partners were seeking different things. AOL's motives seemed pragmatic while Time Warner's tended to be romantic.</p>
        <p>AOL hoped to link up with a respectable blue-chip corporation that could help it settle down and get out of the fast lane. Time Warner, by contrast, hoped that its rich and debonair suitor would provide more excitement and the fashionable trappings of success that would impress Wall Street. While both may yet find what they seeking in this marriage, given the events of the last nine months, AOL's satisfaction seems more likely.</p>
        <p>For one thing, the Internet may not be such a lucrative arena after all. America Online, which had made quite a bundle selling big advertising contracts to swashbuckling dot-coms flush with venture capital, is now realizing that many of those clients can be found lining up in front of bankruptcy court -- if they can be found at all.</p>
        <p>And the plans for a broadband dream house, bringing America Online's Internet service and Time Warner's cable networks under one roof, may be impaired by surprisingly tough zoning rules imposed by federal antitrust officials.</p>
        <p>Then there is the matter of dowry.</p>
        <p>The AOL stock that Time Warner shareholders would receive was worth $110.62 for each Time Warner share when the deal was announced -- 70 percent more than the $64.75 at which Time Warner's stock was trading at the time. The AOL stock value to be exchanged has since fallen to $69.86 -- about 8 percent above the predeal price of a Time Warner share and hardly the sort of premium that a company with the pedigree of Time Warner might expect.</p>
        <p>In other pairings, such as the Terra Networks acquisition of Lycos, a sharp drop in the buyer's stock has prompted an increase in the number of shares offered. But no provision for such renegotiation was included in the AOL-Time Warner prenuptial agreement. Indeed, merger experts say the contract is so tough that there is almost no way for either party to get out now, even if they wanted to.</p>
        <p>Since the deal has received approval by both companies' shareholders and European regulators, what remains is clearance from the Federal Trade Commission and the Federal Communications Commission. The companies expect to receive these by the end of the year.</p>
        <p>Gerald M. Levin, Time Warner's chairman and chief executive, insists that he is as committed to the merger as ever, in bull market and bear. And he said he did not regret the lack of a provision in the agreement that would adjust the ratio of 1.5 AOL shares for every Time Warner share to compensate for a drop in AOL's share price.</p>
        <p>''Whether AOL's stock is $45 or $95, I stand by the exchange ratio,'' Mr. Levin said in a brief interview after Time Warner announced its earnings on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>Indeed, for Mr. Levin, analysts say, the point of this deal was never simply to get the most money for Time Warner shareholders now. Rather, it was to use the combination with America Online as a catalyst in solving some of his toughest strategic and management problems. Of course, the deal promised a fast way to adapt the company's print and television assets for Internet use, something Time Warner had found frustratingly difficult despite years of trying. And even though Time Warner is more than triple AOL's size by revenue, AOL is still growing so quickly the combined company should be far zippier than Time Warner is alone.</p>
        <p>More important in many ways, the far-reaching changes such a deal would presumably cause holds the promise of shaking up and integrating a company that was largely a federation of fiefs -- Time Warner's movie studio, the cable systems, the magazine business and so on.</p>
        <p>Executives of both companies tried last week to show investors the potential for selling advertising to their existing clients by noting that of the 100 biggest advertisers on AOL, the top 100 in Time Inc. magazines and the top 100 on Turner cable networks, only four were on more than one list. Of course that may say as much about the lack of coordination at Time Warner as it describes an opportunity for the new company.</p>
        <p>''There are a lot of reasons we didn't do it before, but those reasons have evaporated,'' Mr. Levin said of his company's previous inability to coordinate ad sales. At the merged company, he said, there will be a new operating committee of top division executives charged with finding ways for the divisions to work together better.</p>
        <p>As for America Online and its chairman, Stephen M. Case, the deal was in many ways as conservative and defensive as it was bold to Mr. Levin. Mr. Case was worried that the balance of power on the Internet would shift from those that simply aggregated content created by others -- as AOL and Yahoo have done -- to the content creators like Time Warner. And Time Warner's cable systems would guarantee AOL a stake in the market for high-speed Internet connections.</p>
        <p>But most important, the deal allowed Mr. Case to capitalize on the remarkable opportunity provided by the then-soaring stock market and use his rich stock to buy a top-tier company with solid assets on terms that might not be available again.</p>
        <p>So more than nine months later, how well does the deal meet these various objectives, given the more hostile environment the companies now find themselves in?</p>
        <p>The only negative surprise for AOL has been the unexpected regulatory scrutiny, which might impair its ability to profit from high-speed services using Time Warner's cable systems. European regulators have already forced Time Warner to pull back from a proposed combination of its Warner Music unit and the EMI Group of Britain.</p>
        <p>The discussions in Washington are heated, but the worst case for AOL and Time Warner is a regulatory regimen that forces it to let competing Internet service providers use the combined company's cable systems on terms that are not quite to its liking. Analysts and executives of the two companies say such a requirement would hardly be serious enough to scuttle the deal or even significantly affect the profitability of the combined company.</p>
        <p>Whether Time Warner can achieve a cultural transformation is unknowable and depends largely on how the executives of the two companies get along. So far there have been no unexpected resignations or other visible signs of discord.</p>
        <p>The question that investors wrestled with last week, however, was how to evaluate the real potential of AOL's advertising business, given the lower market, especially in with dot-com companies.</p>
        <p>Some analysts said the fears were overblown and a combined AOL-Time Warner would have a diversified base of advertisers and would weather a downturn better than smaller competitors.</p>
        <p>''In the year after an election and the Olympics, it's no surprise that advertising growth would slow from 18 percent to 8 percent,'' said Chris Dixon of PaineWebber. ''But 8 percent growth is still faster than the economy as a whole, and the big media companies like Time Warner, Disney and Viacom will get more than their fair share.''</p>
        <p>What is more, the dynamics of America Online's core Internet service business are far better in this environment than those of a purely advertising-based Internet company like Yahoo. To the surprise of many who had written off the AOL service as overpriced and a dinosaur, the company has been able to add subscribers and maintain its $22 monthly fee, even as its telecommunications costs fall 18 percent a year. Advertising has grown to one-third of AOL's revenue but it is still the gravy on top of the subscription fees.</p>
        <p>What about the exchange ratio for the companies' stocks? That is essentially a zero-sum game, because it governs what portion of the company is allocated to Time Warner's shareholders and what portion to AOL's.</p>
        <p>Whether he was lucky or smart, Mr. Case struck the deal with Time Warner at a time it would give him the most advantage. Indeed, AOL shareholders walk away owning 54 percent of the combined company.</p>
        <p>Consider a back-of-the envelope calculation to see how different the terms might be if the deal had been agreed to on Friday. If Time Warner's stock had performed as the average media-company stock has this year, it would have closed on Friday at $51.15. (In fact, it ended at $69.91.) AOL's shares, assuming they fell as much as the average Internet company, would be at $37.61. (They did close at $46.55.)</p>
        <p>The question is if AOL were bidding today, what sort of premium it would have to pay. With its stock down, a 70 percent premium for Time Warner's shares may not be expected. If AOL paid a more typical 40 percent premium, that would be a price of $71.61 for each Time Warner share.</p>
        <p>To reach a bid of that level, the company would then need to exchange 1.9 of its shares for each Time Warner share. With that deal, Time Warner shareholders would wind up in control, with 52 percent of the company.</p>
        <p>Analysts who cover Time Warner say they do not see this gap as a black mark against Mr. Levin. At the existing exchange ratio, said Tom Wolzien of Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company, the deal enhances the per-share cash flow of Time Warner stock.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Wolzien has a much cruder way to reassure himself that the deal is not so bad. ''Time Warner's stock is up this year,'' he said, ''when almost every other media company is down.''</p>
