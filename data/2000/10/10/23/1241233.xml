      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial says Sen Robert Byrd is pushing protectionist trade provision into spending bill and Pres Clinton is unlikely to veto bill for fear of alienating steel industry and potential supporters of Vice Pres Al Gore; provision would change administration of antidumping law, giving complaining domestic industry tariff revenue rather than putting it in Treasury for benefit of taxpayers</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Senator Robert Byrd, Democrat of West Virginia, has single-handedly pushed a protectionist trade provision into an agriculture spending bill that now goes to President Clinton. Mr. Clinton opposes the provision. But, just weeks before an election, he is unlikely to veto the bill for fear of alienating the steel industry and other potential supporters of Vice President Al Gore. So a measure that is likely to harm consumers and antagonize trading partners will become law without benefit of debate on the floor of either chamber.</p>
        <p>The provision would change the administration of the antidumping law, which prohibits the sale of foreign goods in this country below their cost of production. Under current law, an industry that believes it has fallen prey to dumping can bring its allegations before the federal government. If the industry's arguments prevail, the United States can impose tariffs, driving up the price of the import and thereby helping domestic firms recover sales.</p>

        <p>Senator Robert Byrd, Democrat of West Virginia, has single-handedly pushed a protectionist trade provision into an agriculture spending bill that now goes to President Clinton. Mr. Clinton opposes the provision. But, just weeks before an election, he is unlikely to veto the bill for fear of alienating the steel industry and other potential supporters of Vice President Al Gore. So a measure that is likely to harm consumers and antagonize trading partners will become law without benefit of debate on the floor of either chamber.</p>
        <p>The provision would change the administration of the antidumping law, which prohibits the sale of foreign goods in this country below their cost of production. Under current law, an industry that believes it has fallen prey to dumping can bring its allegations before the federal government. If the industry's arguments prevail, the United States can impose tariffs, driving up the price of the import and thereby helping domestic firms recover sales.</p>
        <p>The tariff revenue goes to the Treasury for the benefit of taxpayers. But under the Byrd provision, it would be turned over to the complaining domestic industry -- costing taxpayers more than $200 million a year. The tariff revenue would give the domestic industry an unwarranted subsidy, coming on top of the remedy provided by requiring higher import prices.</p>
        <p>The provision would also have the harmful effect of enticing domestic industries to bring allegations against foreign firms, however frivolous those allegations might be. The backing of powerful members of Congress, like Senator Byrd, who champions the West Virginia steel manufacturers against imported steel, often pressures federal agencies to side with the plaintiffs. The diffuse needs of 260 million consumers spread across the country take second place.</p>
        <p>The Byrd provision may violate international trade rules. It surely violates existing practices among trading partners. Procter &amp; Gamble and many other domestic manufacturers fear that foreign countries will retaliate against their own exports and worry that widespread misuse of the antidumping law will drive up the price of imported materials. Led by Representative Philip Crane, Republican of Illinois, some members of Congress are searching for a bill to which they could attach an amendment that would override the Byrd provision. But the mischief will not be easily undone.</p>
