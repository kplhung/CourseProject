        <p>IF you care about the Mets and liked their chances in this Subway Series, you watched Sunday's bizarre Game 2 with a sinking feeling in your heart -- that this series might be over. Even though the Mets came from 6-0 to 6-5 in the ninth inning, the deep-seated doubts you thought had vanished once and for all rushed back and left you gasping for air and wondering: Can we compete with this team?</p>
        <p>You watched Roger Clemens with a burning sense of indignation, then anger, as he mowed down Met after Met en route to eight shutout innings.</p>
        <p>For Mets fans their would be no retribution.</p>
        <p>In an interleague game in July, Clemens hit Mike Piazza hard enough in the head last to give Piazza a concussion. From then until now there was a sense among Mets fans of a righteous collision course, a fantasy that Piazza would lead the collective assault on Clemens, rock him and sock him and tie this series as it went to Shea.</p>
        <p>That fantasy went out the window the moment Clemens faced Piazza in the first inning. He broke Piazza's bat with a fastball. Clemens then picked up the barrel of the bat and slung it toward Piazza as the Mets' catcher went down the first-base line. Piazza walked toward Clemens and asked if was he throwing the bat at him. Clemens did not have a response at the time. There was the ceremonial emptying of the dugouts, but the point had been made. Clemens went on to allow just two hits and to strike out nine batters.</p>
        <p>After the game, Clemens said he had lost control of his emotions. ''With all the stuff I had to listen to leading up to the game, I had to get control of my emotions,'' Clemens said. ''I had to get control of my emotions. I was fired up.''</p>
        <p>Regardless of intent, the effect was stifling. Piazza bounced out harmlessly to second.</p>
        <p>The next time up, he fouled out to first. After that, he lined sharply to left, but David Justice made a nice sliding catch for the out. On his fourth at-bat, with Clemens out of the game, Piazza hit a two-run homer off Jeff Nelson.</p>
        <p>This was a demoralizing loss.</p>
        <p>Clemens was unhittable, and the Yankees were unbeatable.</p>
        <p>At least after the extra-inning loss in Game 1, Mets' fans could rationalize that the Mets had hurt themselves more than the Yankees had. Game 1 created the impression that the Yankees are old and vulnerable, but both games exposed the Mets as a team blessed and cursed by inexperience.</p>
        <p>In the first game, the Mets hurt themselves with terrible base-running. The Yankees gave them chance after chance; but for a bushel of base-running blunders, the Mets could have won. After last night's pummeling, there was the sound of a steel door slamming shut on the Mets in an air-tight chamber. The Mets' clubhouse last night had a mood in stark contrast to the relatively upbeat attitude that prevailed after the 4-3, 12-inning loss in Game 1.</p>
        <p>In Game 1, the Mets committed four base-running mistakes in the first six innings. Two of them involved the Mets' young outfielders, Jay Payton and Timo Perez. Last night, Payton and Perez committed throwing errors on Yankee base hits. But then Payton turned around in the Mets' ninth inning and homered to close the gap to a run.</p>
        <p>For all the pre-Series analysis, the respective outfields encapsulate the difference between the Yankees and the Mets. The Yankees' outfield consists of veterans; the Mets' of baseball infants.</p>
        <p>For the Yankees, David Justice, 34, is in his 11th season; Paul O'Neill, 37, is in his 13th; Bernie Williams, 32, is completing his seventh season.</p>
        <p>The Mets' outfielders combined have less experience than Williams. Benny Agbayani, the 28-year-old left fielder, played his first full season with the Mets last year; Jay Payton, the 27-year-old center fielder, is ending his first full season in the majors.</p>
        <p>Perez, 23, a mystery even to those in the Mets' organization, was called up near the end of the regular season and wound up replacing right fielder Derek Bell, who sustained a season-ending injury in the division series against the San Francisco Giants.</p>
        <p>The experience and inexperience played out in a number of subtle ways that determined the Yankees' one-run victories in both games. In the fifth inning Saturday night, Payton stayed in the batter's box, thinking the nubber he had hit in front of the plate was foul. Yankee catcher Jorge Posada tagged him out.</p>
        <p>Perez committed the most egregious blunder with two out in the sixth inning after he reached first base. Todd Zeile hit a drive to left that the Mets initially thought was going to clear the wall for a home run. The veteran Zeile even raised his fist as he ran toward first, as if to signal a home run. Perez, who hadn't broken quickly off first, also thought the hit was a home run and eased up as he rounded second.</p>
        <p>When the ball bounced off the top of the wall and stayed in play, Perez turned on the jets and streaked for home.</p>
        <p>But he was too late, and the Yankee veterans made the rookie pay. Justice fired a perfect strike to the cutoff man, Derek Jeter, who fired a strike to Posada, who tagged out Perez.</p>
        <p>There will be debates and controversy about the bizarre confrontation between Clemens and Piazza, but the bottom line is you don't get many chances to beat a team like the Yankees. After Game 1, Payton said he did not think the Mets had cost themselves the Series.</p>
        <p>''In baseball,'' he said, ''there's no such thing as a tone, there's no momentum. Everything's always different. That's baseball.''</p>
        <p>But this is reality. The Mets are down, 2-0, and they appear to be hearing footsteps -- or fastballs.</p>
        <p>Credit that to Roger Clemens.</p>
