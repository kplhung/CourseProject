      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Attending a Bobby Short performance these days is a little like going to the beach on a misty morning. As the sun peeks in and out of the fog, patches of brilliant blue sky appear, and by the end the weather has mostly cleared, with only a few wisps hovering on the horizon. That was the impression Mr. Short made on Wednesday evening, the second night of his 33rd fall season at the Cafe Carlyle, as his voice changed from a raspy saxophone into a bright ringing trumpet.</p>
        <p>As he has in recent years, this singer and pianist is appearing with a small band that is equally adept at swing and Dixieland jazz. The ensemble's bubbly arrangements (several of which feature ticking drumsticks) match Mr. Short's aura of cozy exuberance. The band has helped tilt Mr. Short's musical profile from high-toned saloon singer and pianist toward a classic jazz.</p>

        <p>Attending a Bobby Short performance these days is a little like going to the beach on a misty morning. As the sun peeks in and out of the fog, patches of brilliant blue sky appear, and by the end the weather has mostly cleared, with only a few wisps hovering on the horizon. That was the impression Mr. Short made on Wednesday evening, the second night of his 33rd fall season at the Cafe Carlyle, as his voice changed from a raspy saxophone into a bright ringing trumpet.</p>
        <p>As he has in recent years, this singer and pianist is appearing with a small band that is equally adept at swing and Dixieland jazz. The ensemble's bubbly arrangements (several of which feature ticking drumsticks) match Mr. Short's aura of cozy exuberance. The band has helped tilt Mr. Short's musical profile from high-toned saloon singer and pianist toward a classic jazz.</p>
        <p>But unlike many classic jazz artists, Mr. Short places the highest premium on songwriting. Few performers have more passionate and discriminating tastes in material, and almost every song is accompanied by a history of its origins.</p>
        <p>The new show is a typical blend of Short signatures (''Guess Who's In Town?,'' ''Romance in the Dark'' and ''Just One of Those Things'') and fresh material done with verve, as if the songs were newly discovered.</p>
        <p>The centerpiece is a sequence of songs about money including Yip Harburg and Burton Lane's hilarious critique of arrivistes, ''When the Idle Poor Become the Idle Rich,'' and ''Speaking of Love,'' the pointed, witty questionnaire of a gold digger who wonders: ''When you're through courting me/Who'll be supporting me?''</p>
        <p>Balancing these cheery, cynical reflections on wealth is a tough, bluesy ''Nobody Knows You When You're Down and Out'' that keeps the merriment in perspective.</p>
