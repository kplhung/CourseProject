        <p>The Lord had not yet announced his pick, but the ushers of St. Barbara's Roman Catholic Church were already laying bets.</p>
        <p>Benny Trossi was going with the Yankees, and backing him up was $100 and a case of beer. Not to be outdone, Nazzario Gil had put his money -- plus the cost of a fancy dinner -- squarely behind the Mets.</p>
        <p>At St. Barbara's Church in Bushwick, Brooklyn, Sunday services, in addition to their customary comforts and rituals, offered another chance to worship at the altar of the Subway Series and talk a little baseball trash.</p>
        <p>Mr. Trossi, a 61-year-old cabinetmaker, arrived at church first yesterday, driven by the Yankees' come-from-behind victory in the first game of the Series on Saturday night. He stood in St. Barbara's stone-lined vestibule, handing out bulletins for the morning Mass and waiting to sock it to the other side.</p>
        <p>When he saw Mr. Gil, a 41-year-old carpenter, coming toward him from across the street in his blue-and-orange Mets shirt, any semblance of Christian charity quickly vanished.</p>
        <p>''I'm getting my broom out for the sweep, guy,'' Mr. Trossi taunted.</p>
        <p>''Aw, that was luck, baby,'' Mr. Gil came back. ''You can put that broom away.''</p>
        <p>St. Barbara's, a glorious Romanesque confection on a bleak block of Central Avenue at Bleecker Street, has been around for nearly 100 years. In 1956, the last time the city was wracked by baseball civil war, the church was home to an ardent flock of Italian, Irish and German Brooklyn Dodgers fans.</p>
        <p>These days, the parishioners are more likely to be Hispanic and black. While there are a few Mets disciples among them, by and large, St. Barbara's supports the Holy Order of St. Torre and the Bombers of the Bronx.</p>
        <p>''We got El Duque, Posada, Mariano Rivera, Vizcaino -- all those Spanish-speaking guys,'' said Ramon Torres, 45, a parishioner. ''But I've always wondered about Tino Martinez. He's got the name, but he doesn't really look like a Spanish guy.''</p>
        <p>Maria Agron, another congregant, showed up for Mass wearing a Yankees cap. While that sort of headgear is usually frowned upon, Mr. Trossi made an exception. ''But if she had a Mets hat on?'' he said, ''no way.''</p>
        <p>The clamor over the Subway Series has helped the people of St. Barbara's forget some of Bushwick's pains. While the crack trade and violent crime have subsided in the neighborhood, Bushwick still has the highest number of children on public assistance than any other section of Brooklyn does. The graduation rate at Bushwick High School is 35 percent, compared with 61 percent for the borough as a whole.</p>
        <p>The Rev. Richard Bretone, St. Barbara's acting pastor, says he was shocked one day when he visited a single mother of four at her home and found nothing in the house at all: no furniture, no pictures on the wall, not even a bed for the children.</p>
        <p>To ease the ache of poverty, St. Barbara's offers its youngest parishioners a summer program that includes field trips to the Metropolitan Museum of Art and Central Park. Father Bretone is thinking of setting up a vocational training center at the church to help older parishioners get off the streets and into decent-paying jobs as plumbers or construction hands.</p>
        <p>The Subway Series, he says, is a great, if not entirely sufficient, set of riches for his congregation.</p>
        <p>''God always gives us more,'' the pastor said. ''He doesn't take away. He always adds.''</p>
        <p>The most immediate problem, of course, is not God's bounty but his team loyalty. Father Bretone said he was not favoring the Yankees or the Mets, but had tried to read the will of heaven through daily prayer. So far, there have been no clear signs.</p>
        <p>But like the prophets of old, Mr. Trossi has had a vision: God in pinstripes. Yankees in six. (The Yankees came closer to fulfilling that vision last night in Game 2 of the Series, beating the Mets 6-5.)</p>
        <p>''That's ridiculous,'' Mr. Gil snorted as the Mass began. ''God's no Yankees fan. God roots for the Mets.''</p>
        <p>''He loves us because we suffer.''</p>
