        <p>The Oldsmobile division of General Motors is inviting three agencies to compete for creative responsibility on a new divisional campaign that will also be used for all individual vehicle advertising. The decision could change Oldsmobile's relationship with its lead agency, Leo Burnett USA in Chicago, which has worked for Oldsmobile since 1967. Billings have not been determined.</p>
        <p>Gus Buenz, a spokesman for Oldsmobile in Detroit, confirmed a report in the daily fax edition of Advertising Age, adding that the agencies invited are: Burnett, part of the Leo Burnett Worldwide unit of the Bcom3  Group; E. Morris Communications in Chicago, the agency that handles advertising aimed at African-American consumers for Oldsmobile; and the New York office of McCann-Erickson Worldwide, part of the McCann-Erickson World Group unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies. Another McCann office, McCann-Erickson Detroit in Troy, Mich., handles creative duties for the Buick division of G. M., and was recently named to handle corporate advertising and marketing for G.

        <p>If an agency other than Burnett were named to handle the campaign, said Mr. Buenz, ''then the whole relationship would have to be reviewed.''</p>
        <p>Wally Petersen, a spokesman for Burnett, said, ''We remain as committed to Oldsmobile as ever.''</p>
