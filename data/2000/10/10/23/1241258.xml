        <p>In an effort to limit aggressive campaigning for state judgeships across the country, a bipartisan national group is asking judicial candidates to promise to follow newly drafted standards of conduct.</p>

        <p>In an effort to limit aggressive campaigning for state judgeships across the country, a bipartisan national group is asking judicial candidates to promise to follow newly drafted standards of conduct.</p>
        <p>The standards, presented in five states in recent weeks, are six simple propositions generally based on more complicated canons of judicial ethics and state laws. For example, they forbid judicial candidates to promise how they would decide cases or to make false accusations about their opponents.</p>
        <p>Judicial candidates are already required to follow existing ethics rules that prohibit such tactics. But, as judicial campaigns have become political free-for-alls in many states, those rules have been ignored.</p>
        <p>Critics of the current campaigns say attack advertising and false accusations have transformed judicial candidates into politicians who take stands on issues. That, the critics say, undermines the public's confidence that the courts will make decisions based on law, not politics.</p>
        <p>''We are trying to create an environment where it's safe for candidates to say, I can't tell you where I stand on issues that might come before me,'' said Virginia E. Sloan, the executive director of the Constitution Project in Washington, a nonprofit group.</p>
        <p>In letters to judicial candidates and in its public presentations, the group is asking candidates in Alabama, Illinois, Michigan, Ohio and Texas to abide by the proposed standards in the current election.</p>
        <p>The effort in the five states is a pilot project, which is to be followed by a national campaign. Already there are indications in some of those states that the new standards may not be having much impact. But supporters of the standards say it is too early for an assessment.</p>
        <p>In Alabama, The Birmingham News said in an editorial last month that the state ought to move toward an appointive system of selecting judges. But ''until that happens,'' the newspaper said in endorsing the standards, ''we should at least climb out of the gutter.''</p>
        <p>The Constitution Project, based at Georgetown University Law Center, is a private group that provides public education on legal issues. In most states it has presented the standards in partnership with bar associations and other groups.</p>
        <p>The standards are the work of a group sponsored by the Constitution Project, Citizens for Independent Courts, whose chairmen are Lloyd N. Cutler, the Democratic former White House counsel, and Mickey Edwards, a former Republican congressman from Oklahoma who now teaches at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard.</p>
        <p>This year, Citizens for Independent Courts assembled legal experts, former judges, bar association leaders and others to draft the standards. They tried to simplify and strengthen existing rules for judicial races.</p>
        <p>Another standard imposes an obligation to make public disclosures of campaign contributions within five days. Some states require disclosure, but only after a month or more, and  critics have said that existing laws permit interest groups to influence candidates with large contributions in the weeks before elections.</p>
        <p>The other standards ask candidates to accept funds only through an official campaign committee, condemn misleading advertising on their behalf and conduct themselves in a manner that promotes public confidence in the judiciary.</p>
        <p>In the five states, some candidates have pledged to follow the rules, while others have remained silent. In some states, including Ohio, campaign tactics in the judicial races have recently drawn attention.</p>
        <p>Several newspapers in the state have raised questions about the lack of financial disclosure by a group supporting Judge Terrence O'Donnell, a Republican contender for a seat on Ohio's Supreme Court. The group, Citizens for a Strong Ohio, is spending more than $1 million on  advertising attacking Judge O'Donnell's opponent, an incumbent Democrat, Alice Robie Resnick.</p>
        <p>Last month, on its editorial page, The Columbus Dispatch rebuked the two Democrats -- Justice Resnick and Judge Tim Black, a municipal court judge -- for what the newspaper said were clear signals about their political views. In interviews, both judges, who have pledged to follow the standards, denied that they had made improper statements.</p>
        <p>Ms. Sloan of the Constitution Project said the incidents in Ohio and elsewhere showed how closely judicial campaigns had come to resemble campaigns for other offices.</p>
