        <p>JOHN R. KASICH has this to say about his impending retirement from the House of Representatives: ''I would actually like to be president one day.''</p>
        <p>This is a man who, unlike many of his colleagues on Capitol Hill, does not demur when it comes to his own ambition. Even though he is leaving Congress after 18 years, his thoughts race forward, not back. There is no wistfulness about casting that last vote of his career in the week to come, he says, and not one single regret.</p>
        <p>''It was time to leave, leave at the top, leave when things are in good shape,'' said Mr. Kasich, 48, the Republican chairman of the Budget Committee, who helped engineer the balanced budget agreement in 1997 and made a run for the presidency last year. ''I don't have to hunt for more things to do, and I don't need to hang on to the cloak of public office and the platform and the podium. It's time to leave it for a while, learn some other things.''</p>
        <p>But what will he do exactly, at least in the short term? ''I will be involved in real business, to some degree with the media, to some degree with academia. And I will keep my political activities going'' -- mostly through his political action committee, the New Century Project.</p>
        <p>In his years as an Ohio congressman, Mr. Kasich earned a reputation as a bold, hotheaded leader who resisted simplistic party labels.</p>
        <p>In 1990, he defied many Republicans, including President George Bush, when he and Ronald V. Dellums of California, a left-wing Democrat, teamed to try to kill the B-2 bomber. They succeeded in part, when the Pentagon's plans were scaled back, and through the years he kept up the fight to try to eliminate what he considered wasteful military spending.</p>
        <p>He went after tax loopholes that he thought unfairly benefited corporations as vigorously as he went after the International Monetary Fund, arguing that taxpayers should not have to rescue what he viewed as corrupt or bungling regimes in far-flung places.</p>
        <p>''I've been accused by people inside my party -- did he row the boat enough with all the rest of us? But I was the guy who stood next to Newt Gingrich when he was on fire,'' said Mr. Kasich, referring to the former House speaker and his fall from power. ''I'm also going to go in and tell Newt what I think, and my party what I think. And I don't check what I say with anybody. There is no propaganda minister for me.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kasich is best known for his quest to trim the budget and cut deficits, which he took on in 1989 when he was assigned to the House Budget Committee. Every year he drew up his own budget proposals, trying to squeeze out savings from Medicare and discretionary spending. Every year, they were defeated.</p>
        <p>Then, in 1997, he drew enough converts to pass the bill and persuade President Clinton to sign into law the bipartisan balanced budget agreement.</p>
        <p>''I got into politics because I wanted to change the world, and I believe I have,'' Mr. Kasich said. ''I walked a very lonely road to balance the budget starting in 1989. I was all alone in those days; it was just a handful of other people.''</p>
        <p>What about the fact that Republicans and Democrats, intoxicated by the surplus, are now blasting through the ceiling of his carefully written budget to spend record amounts? ''I feel a little bit like Picasso, who painted 'Starry Night' and somebody showed up to put a bunch more stars in the sky,'' he said, exercising some  license with art history.</p>
        <p>It is a source of pride for Mr. Kasich that he remains one of the few politicians to turn away ''pork,'' those coveted federal projects lawmakers take to voters to prove their worthiness. One of his biggest rows involved Representative Bud Shuster, the Pennsylvania chairman of the Transportation Committee, whose 1998 highway bill was legendary for its pork.</p>
        <p>''When you let the dogs get in with the sheep and then you don't deal with the dog, you've got a problem,'' Mr. Kasich said. ''That was the beginning of the erosion of our discipline here. I think the passage of that highway bill was a terrible mistake.''</p>
        <p>''People say the way you get re-elected is you got to have the projects and the pork,'' he added. ''Baloney.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kasich was born in McKees Rocks, outside Pittsburgh, where his father was a mailman and his mother worked in a post office. He was scrawny but hard to intimidate.</p>
        <p>When someone broke a window in his Ohio State dormitory, he went straight to the university president to demand action. Then he persuaded that same president, who was meeting with President Richard M. Nixon the next day, to deliver a letter of Mr. Kasich's critiquing Mr. Nixon's presidency.</p>
        <p>To his surprise, Mr. Kasich was invited to the Oval Office, where he chatted with Mr. Nixon for 10 minutes. He says he was so nervous that he remembers no specifics.</p>
        <p>MR. KASICH stayed in Columbus and at 26 was elected to the State Senate. In 1987, his parents were killed in their car by a drunken driver, an incident that he says sent him reeling emotionally but renewed his faith in God. This January, he and his second wife, Karen, had twin daughters, Emma and Reece.</p>
        <p>He is close to Gov. George W. Bush, but said he would not join a Bush administration.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kasich has his own sights on the presidency, only the next time he will not be so starry-eyed. ''I was not prepared for the fact that money was the dominating factor,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The solution, he says, is to eliminate the $1,000 limits on individual contributions so that a candidate can raise a significant amount of seed money from relatively few people.</p>
        <p>''No more pied piper for John Kasich,'' he said. ''Pied pipers don't win in America.''</p>
