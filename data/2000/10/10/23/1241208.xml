        <p>Twelve years ago Costa-Gavras made a movie called ''Betrayed,'' which raised the specter of white supremacist groups using computer networks to promote racist ideology. As a film it wasn't good and was quickly forgotten, but it has turned out to be a remarkably acute prognosticator of vile things to come.</p>
        <p>Now I can go to my favorite search engine on the Internet, type in a racist slur and immediately be connected to 76,100 Web matches. Yesterday morning Within two clicks of the first match on the list, my computer screen filled with the image of a giant W, superimposed over a sketch of a black man being lynched. Beneath this image was a quote attributed to Abraham Lincoln: ''I can conceive of no greater calamity than the assimilation of the Negro into our social and political life as our equal.''</p>
        <p>I was also led to black supremacist Web sites, to a Patti Smith song, to discussions of Joseph Conrad's ''Nigger of the Narcissus,'' and to Dick Gregory's autobiography. In the brutal democracy of the Internet, all these links are given equal credence and authority; but the white supremacists made the top of the list.</p>
        <p>I was inspired to engage in this ugly exercise by a powerful polemic called ''Hate.com: Extremists on the Internet,'' which will be shown on HBO tonight. Using a series of terrible images drawn directly from the Internet, news reports and interviews with white supremacist leaders, this documentary demonstrates how far the fringe has advanced in the 12 years since Costa-Gavras made ''Betrayed.''</p>
        <p>Don Black, godfather of the Internet racist movement, began Stormfront.com in 1995, and he explains why:</p>
        <p>''I'm tired of the Jewish monopoly over the news media and the entertainment media, and I'm working very hard to provide an alternative to that, and the Internet is that opportunity we've been looking for.''</p>
        <p>Before, he explains, it was hard to disseminate his ''politically unfashionable'' (and evil) views about Jews and blacks, and he was forced to rely on inefficient methods like leaflets and newspapers.</p>
        <p>The Internet has extended his reach by quantum leaps and for much less cost. With his 10-year-old son he created a separate site for children, designed with friendly graphics, a place for youngsters to explore racist ideas.</p>
        <p>Produced with the help of the Southern Poverty Law Center and narrated by its director, Morris Dees, the documentary aims to show that the words and pictures sent through cyberspace have flesh-and-blood ramifications. These include the Oklahoma City bombing, the killing of a gay couple in California, a shooting spree in Chicago whose victims were Jewish, black and Asian.</p>
        <p>The link between the Internet and violent crimes has been made before, but this documentary delivers its case with a sickening punch. The program shows video games on the Internet where black people are the targets and offers an interview with Joseph Paul Franklin, a serial killer, whose pathology focuses on interracial couples. He tells about picking up two women hitchhikers. After one of the women told him she had dated a black man, and the other said she would do the same, he killed them.</p>
        <p>Mr. Franklin is a follower of William Pierce, who in 1978 wrote (under the pseudonym of Andrew MacDonald) ''The Turner Diaries,'' which Mr. Dees describes as the ''Mein Kampf'' of white supremacists. You may recall that ''The Turner Diaries'' was inspiration for Timothy McVeigh, architect of the Oklahoma City bombing.</p>
        <p>''The Turner Diaries'' is available on Amazon.com, where satisfied customers write things like ''couldn't put the book down.'' About 500,000 copies have been sold. Mr. Pierce's second book, ''Hunter,'' which was dedicated to Mr. Franklin, is about a white supremacist who travels the country killing interracial couples.</p>
        <p>The program doesn't suggest a remedy or delve into the First Amendment issues it raises. Its purpose is to alarm, and it does.</p>
        <p>HATE.COM  Extremists on the Internet  HBO, tonight at 10</p>
