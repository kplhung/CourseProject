        <p>The last time a high-rolling Maryland lobbyist was convicted of corrupt behavior, the newly incarcerated felon boldly continued to enlist clients and lobby the Statehouse from a jailhouse pay phone.</p>
        <p>''His income went up to $400,000 a year after the conviction,'' laments Dale P. Kelberman, the assistant United States attorney who was the prosecutor in that case. ''It was very disheartening: people hiring a lobbyist knowing he was convicted.''</p>
        <p>But if a conviction for mail fraud and a six-month sentence did not deter Maryland's top-grossing lobbyist, Bruce C. Bereano, two years ago, neither did Mr. Bereano's activities totally discourage Mr. Kelberman.</p>
        <p>Last month, his prosecution of another blue-chip Statehouse lobbyist, Gerard E. Evans, ended with a 30-month prison term and a blistering message to the state's citizenry from the sentencing judge that ''there is a mess in Annapolis.''</p>
        <p>In sentencing Mr. Evans, who was convicted on 11 counts of mail and wire fraud, Judge J. Frederick Motz of United States District Court warned of ''a culture of corruption that has been tolerated by lobbyists, legislators and the citizens of Maryland.''</p>
        <p>The judge's outcry has stirred statewide concern about the temptations for corruption here, with critics warning that a part-time legislature with limited staff is increasingly at the mercy of a growing corps of 500 lobbyists working the Statehouse and funneling campaign money to lawmakers.</p>
        <p>''How many times do leaders of Maryland's General Assembly have to be hit by scandals before they reform their ways?'' The Sun, Baltimore's daily newspaper, asked in an openly pessimistic editorial after this latest in a string of corruption cases.</p>
        <p>Obviously stung, the legislature's Democratic majority leadership thundered back this week, denouncing critics, including Judge Motz, for ''inappropriate hyperbole.'' In a joint letter to The Sun, Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller Jr. and Speaker Casper R. Taylor Jr. of the House of Delegates insisted that the state had some of the strongest safeguards in the nation. They cited controls passed in the last three years on lobbyists' gifts and meals for lawmakers and financial disclosure requirements on legislators. They promised a bill in the next session to require the licensing of lobbyists.</p>
        <p>''The Maryland legislature is an institution that deserves the pride of its constituents -- not the scorn of a newspaper or disparaging generalizations from a member of the judiciary based on self-serving comments in a criminal trial,'' the two leaders maintained.</p>
        <p>The Evans case presents a classic study of the Statehouse clout of lobbyists in America. Until his fall from power, Mr. Evans was widely respected as the leading Annapolis lobbyist. With annual fees topping $1 million, he has displayed a talent rooted in a mix of charismatic persuasiveness and routine access to ranking lawmakers.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Kelberman convicted him of bilking clients of more than $400,000 in lobbying fees by concocting a fictitious legislative threat -- a purported tort reform bill to open paint and asbestos companies to costly litigation -- which he then promised to nip in the bud.</p>
        <p>A member of the House of Delegates who had threatened to introduce such a bill, Tony E. Fulton, was accused of being Mr. Evan's partner in that case, but acquitted. He said that he had never intended to push the bill, and had discussed the idea merely to solicit community aid from the companies. Mr. Fulton, a real estate agent, maintained that a $10,000 payment he received from Mr. Evans was an honest real estate fee, not a bribe.</p>
        <p>Such details of Statehouse life have prompted fresh calls for reform through a special study commission on lobbying ethics, which began work last year after two lawmakers had resigned in earlier ethics scandals. Among a raft of commission proposals is a barn-door-closing measure to bar convicted lobbyists from plying their old trade. But the commission has rejected a major proposal aimed at the mother's milk of politics, deciding it might be unconstitutional to ban lobbyists from making political contributions to the politicians they lobby.</p>
        <p>As the debate gathered steam, the most unexpected and battle-scarred participant turned out to be the newly sentenced Mr. Evans, who stood outside the courthouse and volunteered an unusually blunt warning based on his insider's expertise.</p>
        <p>''Money has to be taken out of the political process,'' Mr. Evans emphasized, referring to lobbyists' deep-pocket involvement in financing legislators' campaigns. ''Clearly there need to be some adjustments in Annapolis.'' Even as Mr. Evans, 44, rejected an appeal and braced for his punishment, his practiced sense of the legislature left him openly doubting its resolve for reform.</p>
        <p>''They're just kind of skirting around the edges with this study commission and not getting to some of the real root problems,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The study commission includes five legislators, four lobbyists and four members of the public. It is headed by Donald B. Robertson, a former legislator with 18 years' experience in the Statehouse. Mr. Robertson has said the power and money of lobbyists have grown so much in state legislatures that it is time to mandate the reporting of campaign contributions by lobbyists and their employers.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Robertson differs with Mr. Kelberman and other critics who say the legislature needs to be made a full-time body with enough professional staff to reduce the lawmakers' risk of becoming overly dependent on lobbyists. ''Making the legislature full time would not address the real problem,'' Mr. Robertson emphasized in an interview. ''What needs to be done is what the current leaders are doing: focusing a brighter light on ethical issues.''</p>
        <p>As a prosecutor of white-collar criminals, Mr. Kelberman has found that the opportunities for corruption through lobbying are ''endemic in the system.'' He expresses sympathy for lawmakers who, he says, are overworked and underpaid at less than $30,000 for an annual 90-day session crammed with perhaps 2,000 bills.</p>
        <p>''They can't do it all on their own, so lobbyists play a far more significant role in Annapolis than they do in Washington,'' Mr. Kelberman said. ''The opportunity for business transactions between lobbyists and legislators is ripe.''</p>
        <p>As he sentenced Mr. Evans, Judge Motz predicted that the case would ''continue to generate much righteous indignation about the mess in Annapolis.'' But, he concluded, ''who is ultimately responsible? All of us are.'' A lack of public vigilance and an excess of special-interest zeal, he warned, were undermining the democratic process.</p>
        <p>Since his beginnings as a lobbying prodigy here, Mr. Evans has seen the art of lobbying expand from the realm of singularly driven individual practitioners like him to entire firms situated within walking distance of the Statehouse, much like a new estate of government.</p>
        <p>After his sentencing, Mr. Evans said it was unlikely he would do any pay-phone lobbying from prison. But after he serves his time, he admitted, a position with one of those growing firms might prove enticing.</p>
        <p>''I've already had several offers,'' he revealed.</p>
