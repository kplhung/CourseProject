        <p>Highlights and lowlights from the weekend.</p>
        <p>THE RATINGS GAME  The Bowl Championship Series ranking will be released today for the first time this season, raising the tension for college football fans in the final weeks of the season. The only B.C.S. ranking that matters is the final one at the end of the regular season, when the No. 1 and No. 2 teams are guaranteed a berth in the national title game.</p>
        <p>Until then, it is merely an index of who is moving up and down in the writers' and coaches' polls, as well as in the computer rankings. The previous two years have shown that the best way to ensure a trip to the Orange Bowl is to win every game. Look for Nebraska at No. 1 and either unbeaten Virginia Tech or Oklahoma at No. 2. It's guaranteed to change next week after the Sooners and the Cornhuskers, both undefeated, face off on Saturday in Norman, Okla.</p>

        <p>THE RATINGS GAME  The Bowl Championship Series ranking will be released today for the first time this season, raising the tension for college football fans in the final weeks of the season. The only B.C.S. ranking that matters is the final one at the end of the regular season, when the No. 1 and No. 2 teams are guaranteed a berth in the national title game.</p>
        <p>Until then, it is merely an index of who is moving up and down in the writers' and coaches' polls, as well as in the computer rankings. The previous two years have shown that the best way to ensure a trip to the Orange Bowl is to win every game. Look for Nebraska at No. 1 and either unbeaten Virginia Tech or Oklahoma at No. 2. It's guaranteed to change next week after the Sooners and the Cornhuskers, both undefeated, face off on Saturday in Norman, Okla.</p>
        <p>The biggest howls are going to come from Texas Christian University fans. The Horned Frogs are No. 11 in the Associated Press writers' poll and the USA Today/ESPN coaches' poll, but are not among the Top 25 in the New York Times computer ranking, which is part of the B.C.S. formula.</p>
        <p>The Horned Frogs (6-0) are No. 37 in the Times ranking, primarily because their opponents have a combined record of 10-25. They defeated Northwestern, which is ranked No. 31 by The Times, but none of their other five opponents -- among them 0-8 Arkansas State and 0-7 Navy -- have cracked the Times's top 100.</p>
        <p>A PASSER WITH WHEELS  Southern Utah quarterback Matt Cannon ran for 262 yards and broke the National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I-AA record for career rushing yards by a quarterback in a 62-24 victory over Idaho State. With four games left, Cannon has 4,146 yards. He shattered the old mark, 3,957 yards set by Willie Taggart of Western Kentucky in 1998.</p>
        <p>FOUR QUARTERS ARE ENOUGH  ''Overtime is no friend of ours. I hate overtime.'' -- defensive tackle Wendell Bryant after Wisconsin's 30-24 loss to Purdue, the Badgers' second loss in three overtime games at home this year.</p>
        <p>NO SENSE LYING  ''I've been waiting for this moment all my life. Nervous? If you're not nervous, something is wrong with you.'' -- Willie Simmons, a redshirt freshman, who replaced the injured Woodrow Dantzler in the second quarter and matched a school record with four touchdown passes to rally No. 5 Clemson to a 38-24 victory over North Carolina.</p>
