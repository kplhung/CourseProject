        <p>New Economy column says Priceline.com's so-called name-your-own-price approach to online retailing is misnomer; says customers must haggle to arrive at price; says problem with this approach is that while people will bargain over airline ticket or car, few consumers find it worthwhile to dicker over price of jar of peanut butter, for example; drawing (M)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>NAME your own price . . . and save!''</p>
        <p>That may be the slogan of Priceline.com. But name-your-own-price is a misnomer.</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>NAME your own price . . . and save!''</p>
        <p>That may be the slogan of Priceline.com. But name-your-own-price is a misnomer.</p>
        <p>You might not know this from recent news reports, which have questioned the viability of Priceline's approach to business after the company disclosed a third-quarter revenue shortfall. Nor would you know it from the obituaries of Priceline's euthanized name-your-price corporate cousin, WebHouse, which at its death was selling discounted groceries and gasoline online.</p>
        <p>Almost without exception, the analyses of these so-called name-your-price businesses missed the most basic point: Priceline has never run a name-your-own-price business. It is a propose-your-own-price business -- something altogether different.</p>
        <p>To name something is to wield tremendous power. ''Behold this child; I shall call him Aiden.''</p>
        <p>But heft an 8 lb., 5 oz. box of Tide and say, ''Behold this wash-day miracle; I shall call it 18 cents.'' That would be naming your price, but see how far it gets you at the check-out counter of Foodtown.</p>
        <p>If the point sounds like dickering, dickering is the point.</p>
        <p>The so-called name-your-price approach to business may harness the power of the Internet and data-mining and whatever secret software sauce has been patented by Jay Walker, the founder of Priceline and WebHouse. But in the end, the business is not about naming, but haggling. And by social contract, the people of Western capitalism have agreed over the past few centuries that for everyday commerce, it is more efficient not to haggle over everyday goods.</p>
        <p>Maybe it is worth saving $300 on an airline ticket to Barcelona next Wednesday at 2 a.m., via Istanbul, even if a direct flight at noon was what you originally had in mind. But isn't life too short to go online and dicker over a jar of Jif -- particularly if there is no certainty that the price you ''name'' bears any relationship to what somebody's willing to sell it for?</p>
        <p>''I don't like to name my prices,'' said Peter L. Bernstein, an economist and author. ''I like to have them named for me. Some things aren't worth dickering over.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bernstein says Priceline may still be able to show it can make money by using network automation to find buyers for higher-price items like airline seats. In fact, he would extend the model to theater seats and other pricier goods for which the provider bears a fairly low marginal cost for each additional item -- particularly if the items have no value at all if they go unsold by takeoff or curtain time.</p>
        <p>But there is only so much price elasticity in something with a long shelf life -- like a box of Wheat Chex, which can sell just as easily next Friday.</p>
        <p>Simply because technology makes something humanly possible doesn't mean that humans will profitably embrace it. Automation works best when it makes the arduous easier and the tedious less time-consuming.</p>
        <p>For many consumers, for instance, one true breakthrough of the Web has been to reduce the haggling and dickering involved in buying a car. Do your research online and you can get a pretty accurate idea of the dealer's invoice price for any given automobile. Submit a request for a price quote through an online car seller like Autobytel or CarPoint, and in all likelihood you'll have dealers contacting you with prices that insure a modest profit for them, while offering a relatively fair, haggle-free deal for you.</p>
        <p>So why, at a time when the Web is dangling the promise of ending car-dealer dickering in our lifetimes, would anyone think the public is eager to bring haggling to the meat case at Safeway?</p>
        <p>Bruce Edelman, a career salesman whose resume includes handgun permits and motivational audio tapes, is Internet manager at Queensboro Toyota in Jackson Heights, Queens. While the other salesmen work the showroom, Mr. Edelman, 48, works the Web, taking inquiries and sending out price quotes via Queensborotoyota.com, Autobytel.com, AutoTrader.com and AutoVantage.com. (In the interest of full disclosure, I met him recently when he sold me a car through Autobytel.)</p>
        <p>Haggling over the price of a Corolla? ''The Internet keeps a person away from that,'' Mr. Edelman said. ''The typical car buyer has the negativity of walking into the dealership and being attacked by every barracuda. The Internet buyer is a more educated buyer. Sales people hate it when they see a customer walk in with a lot of paperwork they've printed from their computer. They say, 'Oh, here comes another Internet freak.' ''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Edelman, whose colleagues call him CyberBruce, is no fan of the name-your-price e-tailers. ''You're not naming your own price,'' he said. ''You're trying to get them to approve it. It's a hit-or-miss thing. There's too much aggravation.''</p>
        <p>Brian Ek, chief spokesman for Priceline, says that seven million customers have used the company's service and that nearly 40 percent have come back again. ''In our view,'' Mr. Ek said, '' 'name your price' means 'Make a reasonable offer, and we'll see what we can do for you.' ''</p>
        <p>Generally, he said, Priceline's consumers of air tickets, hotel rooms and car rentals are college students, retired people or parents of large families -- ''people who have time they are willing to trade, if they can get deep discounts.''</p>
        <p>WebHouse, meanwhile, is still unwinding its operation after its founder, Mr. Walker, pulled the plug this month. His private investors declined to pump more capital into the 10-month-old company, which was losing money on the deep discounts it was forced to swallow in an effort to keep its two million pennywise customers coming back.</p>
        <p>Mr. Walker and other WebHouse executives blamed the current investment climate, not their business model, for failing to give the grocery-haggling service enough time to prove itself.</p>
        <p>Kevin Goldman, a WebHouse spokesman, said said the company's typical customer was ''a woman, shopping for her family, who would be flexible on the brands she wanted and who wanted to save money.''</p>
        <p>He conceded that the system -- make an offer for Ragu and wait for a response, bid on Cream of Wheat and see if it takes -- demanded more time and patience than many people might tolerate. ''It was product by product, and one of the complaints we heard overwhelmingly from consumers and manufacturers was, 'Look, this takes too long, it's too hard,' '' Mr. Goldman said.</p>
        <p>''We had been beginning to think about name-your-price for a whole shopping basket,'' he said. ''But unfortunately, we ran out of time.''</p>
