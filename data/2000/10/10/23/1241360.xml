        <p>After soreness in his left knee had kept him out of two practices and two preseason games, Glen Rice participated in shooting drills with the Knicks yesterday. An M.R.I. exam was performed on Rice's knee on Saturday. The results were negative, and the diagnosis was a bone bruise. He did not run in practice yesterday, and he is listed as day to day.</p>
        <p>Rice said he would like to compete in at least two of the Knicks' three remaining preseason games. But he also admitted that he may not be ready until opening night on Oct. 31, when the Knicks play host to the Philadelphia 76ers at Madison Square Garden.</p>
        <p>''I would definitely like to get in there and mix it up a little bit, but if not, I still have practice to mix it up in,'' said Rice, who averaged 15.3 points in the Knicks' first three preseason games. ''There's a posibility you could see me in the next game. But we have to be smart about it.''</p>
        <p>Rice, who injured the knee in the Knicks' defeat of the Washington Wizards last Monday, said he was relieved by the results of the M.R.I.</p>
        <p>''I was worried in the beginning, even though they were telling me that it was just a bone bruise,'' Rice said. ''As a player, you always want to make sure there's nothing else in there bothering it. Once you get that cleared up mentally and you realize that you can't hurt it anymore, you're willing to go out there and play with pain and fight through it. It's still pain there, and there's going to come a point where I have to play with the pain regardless, but you don't want to rush into it and take unnecessary banging up against it and then have it be sore for the first game of the regular season.''</p>
        <p>The Knicks, who play the Nets at Continental Arena on Tuesday, held an open scrimmage yesterday before 600 children from Westchester community groups. Larry Johnson bruised his left elbow in the scrimmage, but said he was fine. Erick Strickland did not play because of an upper respiratory infection. He is listed as day to day.</p>
