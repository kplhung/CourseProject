        <p>Prime Minister Jean Chretien called today for new elections, apparently counting on a booming economy and a popular new tax-cutting package to make him the first Canadian leader since World War II to win a third consecutive mandate.</p>
        <p>Compared with the United States, Canada has quick election campaigns -- 36 days -- and cheap ones. Mr. Chretien's Liberals and their main rival, the Canadian Alliance, are expected to spend about $7 million each before the national vote on Nov. 27.</p>
        <p>The Alliance, a new conservative party, raised about 20 percent of the money for the campaign on Wednesday with a dinner in Toronto for 1,700 business leaders.</p>
        <p>''The election campaign begins officially at this moment, but we all know it began unofficially some time ago,'' said Mr. Chretien, making his announcement on the lawn of the Rideau Hall government building in Ottawa.</p>
        <p>He continued: ''Canadians do not want an expensive American-style election campaign that drags on for months and months, and there is nothing more democratic than calling an election. It is an opportunity for Canadians to choose between different visions and different values. This election offers two very different visions of Canada, two crystal clear alternatives.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Chretien, 66, is calling the election when he is only three and a half years into his second five-year mandate. But he is believed to be worried about the rising popularity of Stockwell Day, a 50-year-old westerner who won the Alliance leadership race last June. In 1997, Mr. Chretien similarly called an election at the three-and-a-half-year marker, hoping to increase his parliamentary majority, but voters, angry about austere fiscal policies that weakened the social safety net, slashed his majority by 22 seats, and he won a popular vote of only 38 percent.</p>
        <p>But this time, Mr. Chretien, who has been prime minister since 1993, believes he is on more solid ground. The death on Sept. 28 of Pierre Elliott Trudeau, the former prime minister, created a national wave of nostalgia for his Liberal social democratic values. The memories of the Trudeau era seem to have prompted a reassessment of the conservatism offered by the Alliance, braking Mr. Day's rise in the polls.</p>
        <p>In polls this fall, Mr. Chretien generally beats Mr. Day, leader of the largest opposition party, by about  two to one, the mid-40's to the low 20's.</p>
        <p>On the economic front, Canada is  reaping some of the benefits of the fiscal austerity imposed in the early Chretien years. With the economy expanding by almost 5 percent this year, unemployment is low, and a chronic budget deficit has been replaced with large surpluses.</p>
        <p>In September, the government restored billions of dollars in funding to the national health system, a leading concern of Canadians. Then, last Wednesday, Finance Minister Paul Martin unveiled tax cuts that have been described by the Canada's financial press as the largest in Canadian history.</p>
        <p>Designed to save taxpayers $65 billion over the next five years, the cuts draw Canadian income and capital gains tax rates closer to American levels. The lowest level is to be 16 percent, just below the level proposed by the Alliance. The new government policy will cut the federal debt by $7 billion in the first year, more than is proposed by the Alliance.</p>
        <p>With these tax cuts, Canada, long known for its Scandinavian-style tax rates, may be making a historic shift, conservative commentators say.</p>
        <p>''There's no doubt the ground rules of Canadian politics have shifted dramatically over the last few years, even the last few months,'' Terence Corcoran, a conservative columnist for The National Post, wrote on Thursday. ''Tax cuts on a large scale are now respectable policy on a national basis, and there will be no turning back.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Day, who made his national mark by cutting taxes in Alberta, is now expected to shift his strategy to call for stricter sentencing for criminals, a more aggressive repayment schedule of the national debt, better health care for an aging population -- and for a generational leadership change from Mr. Chretien, who was first elected to Parliament in 1963.</p>
        <p>In a Compass poll conducted nationwide last week of 1,155 Canadians, 41 percent said they ''definitely'' wanted a change of prime minister. With the Liberals having a hard time attracting star names to run on their tickets this fall, Jeffrey Simpson, The Globe and Mail's lead political columnist, last week captured much of Canada's indifference about Mr. Chretien, calling him ''an anti-visionary man,'' and ''the status quo man of all status quo men.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  October 28, 2000, Saturday  An article on Monday about a call by Prime Minister Jean Chretien of Canada for new elections referred incorrectly to the most recent precedent for a candidate's winning three consecutive terms as prime minister. Mr. Chretien would not be the first since World War II; Pierre Elliott Trudeau was.</p>
