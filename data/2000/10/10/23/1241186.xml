        <p>Better to throw money at charities than at advertisers.</p>
        <p>So figures TakeToAuction.com, a 16-month-old Internet auction intermediary that hopes to distinguish itself from other dot-coms.</p>
        <p>Last week the company auctioned a philatelic collector's item: a 24-cent stamp from 1918 with an inverted image of an airplane. The stamp, with a minimum bid of $50,000, sold on eBay for $91,300. Mothers Against Drunk Driving received 80 percent of the difference, more than $30,000, a fact trumpeted on TakeToAuction's site. Similar sales are planned to benefit other charities as well as raise the site's profile.</p>
        <p>''The tie-in with charities is the best way to get known on the Internet today,'' said Lucien Lallouz, marketing director of TakeToAuction, which is based in Hollywood, Fla.</p>
        <p>In its day-to-day business, TakeToAuction charges its members annual dues of $100 and gives them access to an online catalog of goods for auction, as well as helping them auction their own items online.</p>
        <p>In this case, though, the company bought the stamp from Ivy &amp; Mader Philatelic Auctions, then put it on eBay, with the charity incentive, to tap into its hordes of collectible-hunters. Mr. Lallouz hopes those bidders will follow the links to his own site.</p>
        <p>''We bring buyers and sellers to eBay, and eBay brings us members,'' he said.</p>
        <p>And with operating losses of $2.4 million in the first half of this year, new members are vital.</p>
        <p>The buyer of the stamp, which eBay said was the most expensive ever auctioned on its site, is a 53-year-old high-tech executive and collector from New England. Speaking on condition that he not be identified, he said the 1918 misprint was his most precious find; he also has the correct version, worth only a few hundred dollars, in which the airplane flies right side up.</p>
        <p>The next item for bid, available at eBay until Oct. 30, is what Mr. Lallouz called the last player contract signed by Babe Ruth, from 1935. He said he expected it to sell for at least twice the minimum bid of $500,000. Eighty percent of the difference will benefit City of Hope's breast cancer research.</p>
