        <p>Representative Rick A. Lazio hopscotched across central New York today, making distinctly different appeals to different groups of ethnic voters who may be pivotal to the outcome of the Senate race.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio concentrated on Polish, Italian and Latino voters during a nearly 12-hour campaign day that started with Mass at a Catholic church with a largely Polish congregation near Buffalo and then a meeting with the editorial board of a newspaper that focuses on Polish-American affairs.</p>
        <p>He attended two ''Rigatoni With Rick'' events, in Rochester and here, separated by an address and question-and-answer session in front of about 30 Latino voters at a candidates forum in Syracuse.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio gave some of his most spirited talks at the rigatoni events, basking in the adulation from friendly crowds, rocking his heels and clapping his hands to Italian folk music -- a contrast to his flatter, more stilted delivery of speeches that center on campaign issues.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio has attended several ''Rigatoni With Rick'' and ''Linguini With Lazio'' events intended to energize ethnic voters, particularly Italian Catholics, who have made up among the largest voting blocs in past elections.</p>
        <p>Today's rigatoni lunch, at the Italian American Community Center in Rochester, was typical. To say the crowd was friendly does not come close to describing its enthusiasm. ''I feel like I'm home,'' Mr. Lazio boomed, standing in the middle of a hall filled with cheering supporters who, along with the buckets of rigatoni served on paper plates, made the event seem more like a party than a campaign stop.</p>
        <p>Clutching a microphone, Mr. Lazio began his stock speech for Italian American events, pausing at one point to beam at the people hanging over the balconies above him.</p>
        <p>He used Italian words and phrases to add a bit of spice to his immigrant family's up-from-the-bootstraps tale.</p>
        <p>''My grandmother came over when she was 11 years old by herself, from Sicily,'' Mr. Lazio said to hearty applause. ''She came over the Atlantic in an old steamship.''</p>
        <p>There was hardship, ''scrimping and saving,'' language barriers and discrimination, he said, but in the end, his position as a member of Congress testified to his ancestors' success.</p>
        <p>''It's not just an Italian story; it's an American story,'' Mr. Lazio said. ''It's a story of immigrants coming together who want to fight hard for the next generation. That's why I feel so strongly about this race, about being a guardian of those values, of work and family and responsibility and respect, of rewarding the work ethic in our tax code, making sure that people can put money aside to save for the next generation, to make sure that we can help people go to school to have more opportunities than the last generation had.''</p>
        <p>Then it was picture time, lots of hugs, a few kisses.</p>
        <p>A half-hour or so later, Mr. Lazio appeared at the Latino voters forum, delivering a more sober speech in a more reserved tone, one heard more often on the campaign trail.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio was among a handful of candidates who addressed and took questions from the audience.</p>
        <p>''We must incentivize the work ethic,'' he said, as people listened politely.</p>
        <p>The first question was about the United States Navy bombing range on Vieques, an island off Puerto Rico. Many Puerto Ricans would like to see the range shut down, a position that Mr. Lazio said he agreed with. (His opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton, has also come out against the range.) The next question was about third-party candidates.</p>
        <p>Julio E. Urrutia, 44, a supporter of Mrs. Clinton who asked about the Vieques bombing range, did not give Mr. Lazio the kind of full-throated endorsement as the ''Rigatoni With Rick'' crowd in Rochester did. But he said he was ''pleasantly surprised'' at Mr. Lazio's response and might think harder about his choice.</p>
        <p>Irma Vasques, however, was not moved. Mr. Lazio, she said, ''just sounded like he was promising everything he could think of.''</p>
        <p>In the end, Mr. Lazio at least pronounced the appearance a success.</p>
        <p>''I think the Hispanic community is one of the fastest growing in New York,'' he told a reporter who had asked why he bothered with such a sparsely attended event. ''I think it s important to talk about the issues that I think many in the Latino community want to hear about.''</p>
