        <p>The Queen City is finally being treated like one, at least until Nov. 7.</p>
        <p>The jokes -- about snow in June, the struggling Buffalo Bills, dat accent -- have been put in a lockbox. New York's candidates for the United States Senate have lavished attention and resources on this city and its suburbs, mindful of recent statewide campaigns that have established Buffalo and surrounding Erie County as an electoral touchstone.</p>
        <p>Political analysts say that it would be very difficult for a Democrat to win statewide office without winning Erie, to compensate for the bedrock support Republicans can count on in the rest of upstate. So both candidates are trying to capitalize on the shifting, unpredictable political dynamics here, a classic bellwether ''swing'' area that, were it not for New York City, would be the dominant region of the state.</p>
        <p>Although Democrats hold a 132,000-person margin over Republicans in voter registration, the county is filled with a sizable number of what were once called Reagan Democrats, working-class Catholics of Polish, Irish and Italian ancestry without a firm allegiance to either party.</p>
        <p>Ed Kolenko is a registered Democrat who twice voted for Gov. George E. Pataki and is now leaning toward Hillary Rodham Clinton. ''I trust what Hillary's saying more than Lazio,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Peter Marini, a Democrat who has voted for Mr. Pataki, President Clinton, former Senator Bob Dole and last year, for Charles E. Schumer, a Democrat, for senator, said he now leaned to Representative Rick A. Lazio. ''I'm tired of the Clintons,'' he said. ''Hillary is smart and I may go with her, but there is something about Lazio and new blood that I like.''</p>
        <p>With a laugh, he added, ''And Lazio is Italian like me.''</p>
        <p>He was only half joking. Ethnic politics do play a big role here.</p>
        <p>That is why Mr. Schumer two years ago brought his own Brooklyn sausage to a light-hearted taste test at the renowned Polish festival in Cheektowaga, a working-class Buffalo suburb that gets nearly as much attention from candidates as Buffalo.</p>
        <p>In an interview on Friday, Mr. Schumer, who won Erie County and the election in 1998, called his appearance at the festival a ''breakthrough'' event in that ''it really made a splash.''</p>
        <p>''It said to voters: 'He gets it. He understands what is going on here.' You know if you do well in Erie you may not win upstate, but you certainly come close,'' Mr. Schumer said.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton, following that strategy, brought a Democratic Irish stalwart, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, to a rally here the other night. ''The Kennedys are gods up here in the Irish community,'' said Gerald M. Goldhaber, a professor at the State University at Buffalo who has conducted polling for Democratic and Republican candidates and is the president of Goldhaber Research Associates.</p>
        <p>And Mr. Lazio is suddenly invoking his Italian heritage -- telling stories about his grandmother Rose's journey here decades ago -- at stop after stop, not just here but also in other Italian enclaves. (His schedule today included ''Rigatoni With Rick'' events in Rochester and Rome, N.Y.)</p>
        <p>Recently, he posed for pictures with Bishop Henry J. Mansell of the Diocese of Buffalo, and with his bus blaring the Italian folk hit ''Lazy Mary,'' dined at a ''Rigatoni With Rick'' event here the other week that his campaign claims drew more Democrats than Republicans.</p>
        <p>He attended Mass this morning in nearby Sloan at St. Andrew Roman Catholic Church, which has a predominantly Polish congregation, and met with the editorial board of the Am-Pol Eagle, a newspaper geared toward Polish-American readers.</p>
        <p>Both camps say that by Election Day they will have visited Erie County more than two dozen times since May, when they received their parties' nominations.</p>
        <p>Both campaigns have saturated the airwaves here with commercials -- a recent Lazio ad included people wearing Buffalo Bills caps -- and say their internal polling shows they are running strongly here.</p>
        <p>An independent poll of 400 likely voters in Erie and Niagara Counties, conducted by Goldhaber Research Associates, suggested that Mrs. Clinton was leading 50 to 36 percent, with 13 percent undecided. The poll, conducted Oct. 17 to 19 and released on Friday, had a margin of sampling error of 4.9 percentage points.</p>
        <p>Some high-profile victories in recent years have cheered Republicans and, Mr. Goldhaber said, buttressed the theory that ''people here don't vote party line, they vote economic issues.''</p>
        <p>In 1994, Mr. Pataki won Erie County by nearly 40,000 votes over Mario M. Cuomo, the first Republican gubernatorial victory since Nelson A. Rockefeller's. Mr. Pataki also won in 1998.</p>
        <p>Republicans in the last decade have taken control of three prominent countywide offices -- county executive, comptroller and sheriff -- although Democrats have maintained a majority in the 17-seat County Legislature since 1982.</p>
        <p>The victory of Joel A. Giambra as county executive last year in particular bears closer inspection.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giambra, the former Buffalo comptroller, who had been a Democrat until the year before, when he switched parties, ousted a three-term Democrat, Dennis T. Gorski, by  54 to 43 percent.</p>
        <p>He did so largely by a calculated appeal to ethnic Democrats, particularly Italians, who had flocked to unions and to the Democratic Party when Buffalo was a manufacturing powerhouse, but who lost their party allegiance as the steel and other industries went bust.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giambra's television advertising stressed his concern over the economy, with spots depicting emotional farewells to young people forced to move out of the area for jobs. He deplored what he calls ''the runway of tears'' at the Buffalo airport, in keeping with his campaign slogan, ''keep our kids.''</p>
        <p>''The Reagan Democrats were concerned about pocketbook issues,'' said the Erie County Republican chairman, Robert E. Davis, ''and we were able to address pocketbook issues that Democrats recognized.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton, like Mr. Schumer, has seized on the economy as an issue here, unveiling a plan in February aimed at bringing relief to the area, and knocking Mr. Lazio at every turn for his more optimistic outlook on things. Her campaign has used a Buffalo News editorial to buttress commercials that said Mr. Lazio was ''orbiting another planet'' for his views on the economy, though Mr. Lazio has said his views have been misconstrued to suggest that he did not believe economic aid was needed.</p>
        <p>''The issues piece is vital, here and the issue is the economy,'' said Mrs. Clinton's campaign manager, Bill de Blasio. ''It's astounding he hasn't changed his tune.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Davis, who helps to coordinate Mr. Lazio's campaigning in Erie County, said: ''The issue has been so spun by the Clinton folks that we need to be a little bit more aggressive on these things. Lazio has had to spend more time defining what his plan is. Frankly, it's similar to 1994. It's not brain surgery here. Cut taxes and create jobs. We have direct mail pieces that address that. We need to build on that.''</p>
        <p>Asked if Mr. Lazio had enough time left to persuade people of his concern for the economy, Mr. Davis replied, ''We don't have a choice, do we?''</p>
        <p>Such sentiments arose the other night at a bar Mr. Lazio visited to watch the first game of the World Series. Rising property taxes have irritated many people to the point that they are itching for someone --  if not the mayor, then perhaps the United States senator -- to do something.</p>
        <p>''Property taxes have to be lower so small businesses can come in here,'' said David W. Gacioch, 34, an independent who owns a property management company and is supporting Mr. Lazio.</p>
        <p>Others had chosen their candidate  based on other issues, though the fluid nature of their party affiliation was evident.</p>
        <p>John Maney, 60, who worked as a police officer and correction officer in New York City before retiring, said he considered himself an ''independent'' registered Democrat. He had intended to vote for Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, whose place Mr. Lazio took when the mayor dropped out for cancer treatment. Now, Mr. Maney favors Mrs. Clinton.</p>
        <p>''I would've preferred Giuliani,'' he said. ''I liked what he did in New York City. No one really knows Lazio, he's from the wrong end of the state for me now.''</p>
