        <p>For all the disputes over abortion or whose Oklahoma roots run deeper, the race in the Second Congressional District was summed up today when the two candidates named their political heroes. Brad Carson, the Democrat, picked Robert S. Kerr. Andy Ewing, the Republican, named Tom Coburn.</p>
        <p>Mr. Carson called his hero a leader ''not only for this state but for this nation, on whose waterways we spend our weekends, and power our lights and heat, and whose roads we travel upon.'' (Until 1963, Mr. Kerr served 14 years in the Senate, mastering the pork barrel politics that helps a poor district in a poor state; a river project named for him runs through this Northeast Oklahoma District.)</p>

        <p>For all the disputes over abortion or whose Oklahoma roots run deeper, the race in the Second Congressional District was summed up today when the two candidates named their political heroes. Brad Carson, the Democrat, picked Robert S. Kerr. Andy Ewing, the Republican, named Tom Coburn.</p>
        <p>Mr. Carson called his hero a leader ''not only for this state but for this nation, on whose waterways we spend our weekends, and power our lights and heat, and whose roads we travel upon.'' (Until 1963, Mr. Kerr served 14 years in the Senate, mastering the pork barrel politics that helps a poor district in a poor state; a river project named for him runs through this Northeast Oklahoma District.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Ewing said that, like his hero, ''I want to be a citizen legislator. I can go to Congress and I can vote for what's right and against what's wrong, and not worry about voting partisan and trying to climb a political ladder.'' (Dr. Coburn, the incumbent, is finishing six years in the House, keeping his term-limits pledge by retiring. A maverick, he fought his own party over spending, including opposition this May to a parks bill with $16.7 billion for Oklahoma.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Carson, 33, is a Rhodes Scholar and a lawyer with a big Tulsa firm. He registered in this district less than two years ago with his eye on this seat. It is the most Democratic district in the state, carried twice by President Clinton and even by Michael S. Dukakis in 1988.</p>
        <p>But he is hardly the ''newcomer'' portrayed in striking advertisements by the National Republican Congressional Committee that show him as a medicine show pitchman. He graduated from a high school in the district and his ancestors arrived in the late 1830's on the Trail of Tears after Cherokees were expelled from Southeastern states like Georgia. He is a Cherokee.</p>
        <p>At 62, Mr. Ewing is a retired automobile dealer who cites his community activities, his faith (he calls the so-called marriage tax penalty ''contrary to Biblical principles''), his commitment to term limits and the right to bear arms, and his opposition to abortion as reasons for sending him to the House. Above all, he cites his business experience. ''There are enough attorneys there,'' he says.</p>
        <p>The Republican also promises not to accept the ''very lucrative government pension'' he could take; if he served six years, according to an estimate by the National Taxpayers Union, his pension would be less than $20,000 per year.</p>
        <p>In the increasingly nasty air wars, his Democratic opponent is seeking to destroy Mr. Ewing's reputation with a television advertisement that says, ''Like a lot of car dealers, Andy Ewing has trouble with the truth.'' That advertisement may be backfiring, because no one succeeds in selling cars in a rural area for 29 years without building a good reputation.</p>
        <p>The seat matters. Democrats held it for 70 years until Dr. Coburn's victory in 1994, and, as Mr. Carson points out, his party now has no one in the state's Congressional delegation. The seat is a prime target as Democrats seek the seven-seat pickup they need to regain control of the House.</p>
        <p>Democrats say Mr. Carson has a slight edge and Republicans call the race even. The few public polls have huge margins of sampling error, though they give Mr. Carson a lead.</p>
        <p>Before his own supporters, each candidate attacks the other's backers. Speaking to Democrats in Grove on Wednesday, Mr. Carson assailed Dr. Coburn's backing of Mr. Ewing as the idea that he can ''pass on the scepter of rule.''</p>
        <p>At a biscuits and gravy breakfast in Checotah this morning, Mr. Ewing said that while Mr. Carson might say he was for gun rights, ''he has said his first vote will be for Dick Gephardt for speaker'' and ''Dick Gephardt is not a friend of the gun owner.''</p>
        <p>But today's debate before AARP, a group of middle-aged and older people, was dominated by Mr. Carson. He said that he wanted to help the elderly by protecting Social Security and Medicare and adding a prescription drug benefit that would be available to all seniors.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ewing, who has a sheaf of position papers, had trouble under questioning. Asked about reauthorizing the Older Americans Act, which provides meals, health and transportation for the elderly, he said, ''I'm not that familiar with the Older Americans Act.'' Mr. Carson was all for it. Mr. Ewing also seemed awkward with the topic of privatizing Social Security.</p>
        <p>As they closed, Mr. Ewing returned to his desire to ''serve for three terms as a citizen legislator'' and oppose ''bigger government, more government, higher taxes, bigger debt and an increased burden on our children and our grandchildren.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Carson emphasized not what he opposed, but what he favored, fighting ''for the most vulnerable members of our society, our seniors and our children,'' he said. ''That's what this race is about.''</p>
