        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Michael M. Weinstein (''A Reassuring Scorecard for Affirmative Action,'' Editorial Observer, Oct. 17) is right that those of us who object on principle to racial discrimination are unlikely to have our minds changed by one study in the Journal of Economic Literature.</p>
        <p>The study's finding that preferences in favor of particular groups increase the number of members who are hired, promoted and so forth is obvious. Moreover, these increases took place while discrimination against these groups was decreasing.</p>
        <p>Mr. Weinstein says ''the wide gap in SAT scores of black and white students admitted to selective universities'' is not proof of discrimination. But there is more evidence than that. Studies by the Center for Equal Opportunity have shown that all over the country, whites and Asians with better scores and grades are turned down in favor of blacks and Hispanics with lower scores and grades.</p>
        <p>Any benefit of affirmative action must be weighed against the social and economic costs of institutionalized discrimination.</p>
