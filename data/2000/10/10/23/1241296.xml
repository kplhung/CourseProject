        <p>Agency executives are changing posts.</p>
        <p>The top creative executive and the top planning director at the New York office of the Bozell Group, part of True North Communications, are resigning their posts. Brent Bouchez, 43, executive creative director, and Megan Kent, 38, executive director for brand planning, are leaving, Ms. Kent said, ''to start our own company.'' The new agency, to be called Bouchez Kent &amp; Co., will be in New York and will handle advertising and other services; Mr. Bouchez and Ms. Kent will be co-presidents. They will be joined by Jeffrey Wilks, 38, as chief operating officer and Richard Hsu, 43, who will take a yet-to-be-decided post. Mr. Wilks had been executive vice president and senior account director at the New York office of BBDO Worldwide, part of the Omnicom Group, and Mr. Hsu had been head of design at Bozell.</p>

        <p>The top creative executive and the top planning director at the New York office of the Bozell Group, part of True North Communications, are resigning their posts. Brent Bouchez, 43, executive creative director, and Megan Kent, 38, executive director for brand planning, are leaving, Ms. Kent said, ''to start our own company.'' The new agency, to be called Bouchez Kent &amp; Co., will be in New York and will handle advertising and other services; Mr. Bouchez and Ms. Kent will be co-presidents.

Mr. Wilks had been executive vice president and senior account director at the New York office of BBDO Worldwide, part of the Omnicom Group, and Mr. Hsu had been head of design at Bozell.</p>
        <p>A successor to Mr. Bouchez at Bozell has not yet been named; Richard Levy, 42, and David Nobay, 33, continue to oversee the daily operations of the creative department. Joan Dufresne, 38, associate director for brand planning, was named to succeed Ms. Kent as executive director for brand planning.</p>
        <p>As part of a realignment within the Interpublic Group of Companies, Zentropy Partners in Cambridge, Mass., which offers online marketing communications, named Michael Tey, 43, chief engagement officer, as president, taking over duties that had been handled by John Connors III, who was chief executive. Mr. Connors, 33, remains with Interpublic in the Internet ventures group, the company said, without a specific title. Zentropy, formerly a unit of Interpublic affiliated with the McCann-Erickson World Group, is now part of McCann and will work closely with McCann Relationship Marketing Worldwide in New York.</p>
