        <p>Roger Clemens didn't throw at Mike Piazza last night. That is, he didn't throw a baseball at Piazza. He did throw part of a splintered bat, and that act was more bizarre than the pitch he threw on July 8, the one that hit Piazza in the head.</p>
        <p>That incident became a prime topic of discussion and debate as soon the Mets and the Yankees established themselves as World Series participants. Would the pitch have a carry-over effect? Would Clemens start one of the games at Shea Stadium and be susceptible to payback when he came to bat? Would the Mets, who didn't retaliate that day, somehow do so even if he pitched at Yankee Stadium?</p>

        <p>Roger Clemens didn't throw at Mike Piazza last night. That is, he didn't throw a baseball at Piazza. He did throw part of a splintered bat, and that act was more bizarre than the pitch he threw on July 8, the one that hit Piazza in the head.</p>
        <p>That incident became a prime topic of discussion and debate as soon the Mets and the Yankees established themselves as World Series participants. Would the pitch have a carry-over effect? Would Clemens start one of the games at Shea Stadium and be susceptible to payback when he came to bat? Would the Mets, who didn't retaliate that day, somehow do so even if he pitched at Yankee Stadium?</p>
        <p>''I'd like to believe,'' Joe Torre, the Yankees' manager, said of fans before the game, ''they'd rather watch the World Series than to see if Roger Clemens is going to hit him again or if Mike is going to throw the bat at him.''</p>
        <p>As it developed, Torre had it backward.</p>
        <p>Two primary questions emerged from the Game 2 incident: Why wasn't Clemens ejected from the game? Will he be disciplined for an action that has brought suspension to batters who have thrown bats at pitchers? Of course, there was a third question: Why did he do it?</p>
        <p>Furthermore, the bat fling recalled previous incidents involving Clemens, including his second-inning ejection from a 1990 playoff game for allegedly swearing at an umpire.</p>
        <p>Frank Robinson, the Major League Baseball executive in charge of discipline for on-field incidents, saw Clemens throw the broken bat from close up. He was sitting in the second row behind home plate.</p>
        <p>''Every situation is reviewable,'' Robinson said when asked if he would consider disciplining Clemens. ''If there's reason to take action, I will take action.''</p>
        <p>Ed Montague, the umpiring crew chief, and Charlie Reliford, the home plate umpire, agreed that they didn't think Clemens had thrown the bat at Piazza. ''It was an emotional reaction,'' Montague said in a postgame statement.</p>
        <p>Steve Phillips, the Mets' general manager, said that while he felt Clemens had thrown the bat ''aggressively,'' he didn't think it was worth an ejection. Piazza came to bat with two out and nobody on base in the first inning. After two called strikes and a ball, he fouled off a pitch, and the bat broke into three pieces.</p>
        <p>Piazza began running slowly to first base, still holding the bat handle. A second piece, part of the barrel of the bat, flew to the mound, bouncing right in front of Clemens. As if he were fielding a grounder hit back to him, Clemens picked up the jagged piece of bat.</p>
        <p>Normally, a player retrieving a broken bat hands it to a batboy. But Clemens didn't wait for a batboy to come to the mound. He fired it sidearm, angrily it seemed, toward the first-base line -- just where Piazza was running. The piece did not hit the Mets catcher.</p>
        <p>Piazza said he didn't know what to make of the incident. ''I walked out to see what his problem was,'' he said. ''I just kept asking him, trying to get him to say it was an accident or whatever. He didn't say anything.''</p>
        <p>When Clemens hit him in the head in July, Piazza suffered a concussion. The bat throw caused ''shock and confusion.''</p>
        <p>''It's not every day that happens,'' Piazza said. ''I didn't know what to think.''</p>
        <p>On a television replay, Clemens appeared to say to Piazza, as Piazza walked toward the mound to confront the pitcher, ''I thought it was the ball.''</p>
        <p>Clemens said after the game that he might have thought that. ''I didn't know if it was the bat or the ball,'' he said. He also said that he had ''no idea that Mike had ran.'' But he vehemently and repeatedly denied that he had thrown the bat at Piazza. ''There was no intent,'' he repeated so many times that it became a mantra.</p>
        <p>''I was running extremely high,'' Clemens said, referring to his emotional state in the first inning. ''I had to go and calm down. I was extremely fired up. I had to calm down and stay focused.''</p>
        <p>Intensity or a moment of insanity? The answer will be debated throughout the winter, whichever New York team wins the World Series.</p>
        <p>The incident did not shake Clemens in the least. After the players, who had gone chin to chin but had thrown no punches or shoves, returned to their respective dugouts, Piazza grounded out to second on the first pitch with a different bat.</p>
        <p>Todd Zeile would stroke a single in the second inning, but the Mets would get no more hits until Zeile singled again in the seventh. This was Clemens at his strongest, as he was in his one-hit shutout of Seattle in the American League Championship Series. But it also was Clemens at his most bizarre.</p>
        <p>A year ago, the day before Clemens started Game 4 with a chance to end the World Series, he was involved in an altercation with a man as he left the parking lot at Yankee Stadium. Clemens pushed the man, saying he did it because he had felt threatened by him.</p>
        <p>In 1990, Clemens was pitching a game the Boston Red Sox had to win to remain in a playoff series against the Athletics. He encountered trouble in the second inning, first with Oakland, then with Terry Cooney, the home plate umpire. Cooney said Clemens began swearing at him after he called ball four on a pitch to Willie Randolph, then the Athletics' second baseman, now the Yankees' third base coach. Cooney ejected Clemens in a highly unusual move for a postseason game.</p>
        <p>But throwing a bat in a postseason game is rare, too. In 1972, Bert Campaneris, the Oakland shortstop, threw his bat at Lerrin LaGrow after the Detroit pitcher had hit him on the ankle with a pitch. Commissioner Bowie Kuhn levied a $500 fine against Campaneris, who was ejected from the game, and suspended him for the rest of the series and the first seven days of the 1973 season.</p>
        <p>With the Yankees holding a two-games-to-none lead, this World Series could end without Clemens's turn coming up again. However, he could be suspended, like Campaneris, at the start of next season.</p>
        <p>By the eighth inning of last night's game, Clemens's intensity, or whatever he calls it, had ebbed. With two out in the inning, Timo Perez hit a grounder to shortstop, breaking his bat as he did. Part of the bat flew out onto the grass between the mound and first base. Clemens did not rush to the spot, field the bat and throw it at Perez.</p>
