        <p>For the third time in four years, Khalid Khannouchi took first place in the Chicago Marathon. Yesterday, he finished in 2 hours 7 minutes 1 second, the first American citizen to win the race since Greg Meyer in 1982 and setting an American marathon record. The old record of 2:09:32 was set by David Morris of New Mexico at last year's Chicago Marathon.</p>

        <p>For the third time in four years, Khalid Khannouchi took first place in the Chicago Marathon. Yesterday, he finished in 2 hours 7 minutes 1 second, the first American citizen to win the race since Greg Meyer in 1982 and setting an American marathon record. The old record of 2:09:32 was set by David Morris of New Mexico at last year's Chicago Marathon.</p>
        <p>''This one is for America, not for me,'' said Khannouchi, a native of Morocco who became a United States citizen on May 2, ''I came to defend my title, but I know that America needs a great marathoner.'' When Khannouchi crossed the finish line, his wife and trainer, Sandra Inoa, draped him in an American flag. He knelt and kissed the ground, then stood waving the flag in front of the crowd.</p>
        <p>Although it was a sunny day for the 33,171 runners, with a midrace temperature of 58 degrees, they still had to contend with the wind. But a strong group of pacers served as a wind block, and the top three men did not have to battle the wind alone until they pulled away from the lead pack of 12 at Mile 19.</p>
        <p>At Mile 22, the race cambe down to Khannouchi and the Kenyans Joseph at Kiprono and Moses Tanui. Khannouchi took off from the two after coming out of the only tunnel of the race.</p>
        <p>Leaving Kiprono 50 yards behind him and Tanui 100 yards behind, Khannouchi sailed to the finish looking stronger than when he started.</p>
        <p>Kiprono ran a 2:07:29, and Tanui followed him with a 2:07:47. ''He's the best in the world,'' Kiprono said of Khannouchi. ''When he's running, he is always strong.''</p>

        <p>NAVY LIEUTENANT WINS MARINE CORPS: Richard Cochrane, a 27-year-old Navy lieutenant from Harpswell, Me., competing in his second marathon, won the Marine Corps Marathon in Washington yesterday in 2 hours 25 minutes 50 seconds. Eliabeth Ruel, 33, of Ottawa, led the women's division from start to finish, winning in 2:47:52. William Edler, 54, of Delmar, Md., collapsed with a heart attack near the two-mile mark and was pronounced dead at a hospital, the fourth runner to die in the race's 25-year history.</p>
