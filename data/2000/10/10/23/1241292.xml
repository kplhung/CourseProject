        <p>President Clinton plunged into the presidential race today, forcefully rebutting Gov. George W. Bush's attacks on his administration and giving an extensive listing of his accomplishments in a fund-raising swing through upstate New York.</p>
        <p>It was almost as if he were campaigning for himself. And, though his remarks today were full of praise for Vice President Al Gore, the president hinted at an afternoon rally here that Mr. Gore had not tried hard enough to emphasize the differences between his philosophies and Mr. Bush's. Mr. Clinton has privately said as much to friends and aides, complaining that Mr. Gore was not effectively arguing the Democrats' case.</p>
        <p>Though the point of Mr. Clinton's trip was to raise money for the Senate campaign of his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, he devoted a good portion of his speeches to defending his policies and urging that they be continued. At one stop, for example, he listed more than a dozen ways the nation had improved since he was elected, noting things like smaller welfare rolls, lower crime rates, cleaner water and safer food.</p>
        <p>Although he never mentioned the Republican presidential candidate by name, Mr. Clinton referred to several criticisms that Mr. Bush has made throughout his campaign, especially in recent debates with Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>And he energetically praised Mr.  Gore's proposals, despite the vice president's continuing efforts to distance himself from Mr. Clinton. But Mr. Clinton also suggested that Mr. Gore and his running mate, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, could be selling those proposals better.</p>
        <p>''I've read very carefully, obviously, what the vice president and Senator Lieberman have said,'' Mr. Clinton told a crowd of 1,000 in this hamlet near the Canadian border, at a rally that raised about $40,000 for Mrs. Clinton's campaign. ''But I've carefully studied what their adversaries have said, their opponents. I listened very carefully to all the debates. And what I want you to know is that I'm kind of concerned when I read in the press that people can't quite understand what the differences are and maybe they're not clear.''</p>
        <p>At another rally for Mrs. Clinton in Johnson City, in New York's Southern Tier, the president challenged Mr. Bush's frequent claim that a vote for Mr. Gore would be a vote for the status quo.</p>
        <p>''The issue is not whether we're going to change but how we're going to change,'' Mr. Clinton said. ''Are we going to build on the progress of the last eight years or go back to a failed policy we already tried in the past? That is the issue in this election.''</p>
        <p>Referring to another of Mr. Bush's favorite campaign themes, Mr. Clinton said the presidential election was not about ''whether the Democrats should be rejected because of the partisanship in Washington.''</p>
        <p>He tried to cast doubt on Mr. Bush's claim that he is the only presidential candidate who could work well with both major parties, pointing to several of his own initiatives that received bipartisan support.  ''The Democrats favor bipartisanship and our record is that,'' he said to applause.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton has not appeared at campaign rallies with Mr. Gore, and Gore aides say that will not change. Indeed, the men have appeared together in public only once since the Democratic National Convention: at a brief airport encounter in Missouri, where they were attending a memorial service for Gov. Mel Carnahan, who died last week.</p>
        <p>After that service, Mr. Clinton denied a report in The New York Times that he had been upset at Mr. Gore for not involving him more actively in the campaign. And he promised to ''do whatever's best'' to help the Gore-Lieberman ticket, deferring the specifics to Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, Mr. Clinton has stepped up his attacks on Mr. Bush in recent days, and he did so again with gusto yesterday.</p>
        <p>In another swipe, the president scoffed at Mr. Bush's contention that Mr. Gore wants to protect ''big government.'' Mr. Clinton boasted that the federal government had 300,000 fewer workers than when he took office in 1993, and that he had eliminated 16,000 pages of federal regulations. He also said that Mr. Bush's tax cut plan was fiscally foolish, and that Mr. Gore's proposed tax cut was rightly smaller because ''we've got to have some money to invest in education, in health care, in the future of the country.''</p>
        <p>''Do you want to keep the prosperity going and extend it to people and places left behind?'' Mr. Clinton said. ''We tried it our way for eight years; we tried it their way for 12 years before. Our way works better than their way. We need to keep changing in the right direction to keep the prosperity going in America.''</p>
