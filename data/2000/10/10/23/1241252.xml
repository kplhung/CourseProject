        <p>The most senior American official to visit North Korea since the end of the Korean War nearly 50 years ago, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright landed here today to a bare-bones arrival ceremony on a gray, balmy fall morning.</p>
        <p>With a large portrait of the nation's Communist founder, Kim Il Sung, peering down from the airport terminal, Dr. Albright was greeted by a deputy foreign minister, Kim Gye Kwon, and presented with a slender sheath of flowers by an 8-year-old boy wearing the red kerchief of the Communist Youth League.</p>
        <p>No public words were exchanged,  and there were no bands or crowds for the start of a two-day stay that the White House hopes will result in a trip by President Clinton, perhaps as soon as next month.</p>
        <p>But Dr. Albright's arrival marked the distance the administration has come in its relations with the world's last Stalinist redoubt -- a distance traveled also in past months by Washington's allies and in particular by South Korea, whose president, Kim Dae Jung, paid a momentous visit to North Korea in June.</p>
        <p>In 1994, the United States was ready to go to war with North Korea over evidence that it was preparing to manufacture nuclear weapons. By  contrast, Dr. Albright's visit is to test how far relations can be improved and to see if North Korea is ready to stop missile development and freeze its missile flight tests, officials said.</p>
        <p>The United States also wants North Korea to stop exporting its long-range missiles, a business that nets this virtually collapsed economy its main supply of hard currency.</p>
        <p>On the secretary's plane here, a senior State Department official said Dr. Albright would be addressing ''serious'' ideas brought to Washington this month by a senior North Korean military official, Jo Myong Rok. ''We believe the North Koreans may be prepared to take significant steps,'' the official said.</p>
        <p>The official declined to give details, but said Dr. Albright wanted to ''better understand where North Korea wants to head.''</p>
        <p>The Albright visit was not expected to yield any agreements, the official said.</p>
        <p>But in essence, the administration hopes that before Mr. Clinton leaves office, he can fulfill a policy developed and outlined for him late last year by his special envoy for North Korea, former Secretary of Defense William J. Perry.</p>
        <p>According to the report, the United States would normalize relations with North Korea, relax sanctions and take other ''positive steps'' if the government in Pyongyang ''moved to eliminate its nuclear and long-range missile threats.''</p>
        <p>The centerpiece of Dr. Albright's visit is a promised session with the country's leader, Kim Jong Il. American officials argue that Mr. Kim makes all major decisions himself and that the only way to judge the worth of North Korean proposals is through a meeting with him. Mr. Kim declined to meet with Mr. Perry in 1999.</p>
        <p>The schedule released by the State Department for Dr. Albright does not include an appointment with Mr. Kim, but officials said the meeting was likely to take place on Tuesday morning.</p>
        <p>Dr. Albright's first impressions of this isolated and impoverished country could come only from the 20-minute drive in a limousine that had been especially driven in from South Korea through the demilitarized zone that separates the two Koreas.</p>
        <p>Her motorcade monopolized the four-lane highway from the airport into the capital proper, and passed brown fields that had recently been harvested. Korean officials accompanying reporters said the crop was poor this year, first because of drought and then because of an August typhoon.</p>
        <p>Stiff policemen, dressed in turquoise uniforms and holding candy-striped batons pointing in the direction of the capital, directed the motley collection of vehicles. Billboards bearing large images of Kim Il Sung, the father of the current leader, carried the slogan, ''Let's pay greatest respects to Chairman Kim.''</p>
        <p>On the outskirts of the city, children strolled to school for the start of class at 8 a.m.. A few people cycled, but most people walked, apparently to work. Several women wore high heels, but most had sensible tennis shoes with colored skirts and blouses.</p>
        <p>In the city center, the policemen gave way to policewomen in snappy turquoise Bermuda shorts who looked sternly ahead as they searched for traffic on streets almost devoid of cars.</p>
