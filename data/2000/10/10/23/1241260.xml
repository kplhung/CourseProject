        <p>The issue on the golf course was settled early today, but long-range issues concerning the Presidents Cup will take longer to sort out.</p>
        <p>The United States won the fourth Presidents Cup impressively, cruising to a 21 1/2-10 1/2 victory, the largest margin in the event's brief history. Meanwhile, the PGA Tour's commissioner, Tim Finchem, announced that Fancourt, South Africa, would play host to the next Presidents Cup, a decision that was warmly embraced by the International team, but one that could pose a problem if top American players, particularly Tiger Woods, elect not to travel that far to participate.</p>
        <p>While the debate will continue about the best direction for the Presidents Cup, there was no debate about which team was superior this year at Robert Trent Jones Golf Club. The Americans won today's singles competition, 7 1/2-4 1/2, in front of an enthusiastic, well-behaved crowd that helped create a much less volatile atmosphere than in several recent Ryder Cups.</p>
        <p>But while both sides remained friendly throughout, the competition had intense moments. Woods won the day's most heated match, defeating Vijay Singh, 2 and 1, after Singh's caddie, Paul Tesori, wore a cap with the words ''Tiger who?'' written on the back. ''I guess he knows now,'' said Woods, after making an 8-foot putt for birdie at No. 17 to clinch the match. ''People have different motivational tactics. If that's what he needs to do, then that's what he needs to do.''</p>
        <p>Asked if he would speak to Tesori about the message on the cap, Woods shook his head, then referred to the final score of his match.</p>
        <p>''There's no need to talk,'' Woods said, smiling. ''Two and 1.''</p>
        <p>While Woods may have been motivated by the message on Tesori's hat, the caddie said he wore it in fun.</p>
        <p>''Shigeki Maruyama's caddie, Jude O'Reilly, came over to me with one and asked if I would wear it,'' Tesori said. ''It was done in good spirit. I hope he didn't take offense to it. We played against Tiger three times, and walking down the fairway, everybody's screaming, 'Tiger, Tiger.' Vijay's the Masters champion, and nobody is paying attention to him. I didn't mean to offend Tiger, and if anything, it probably fired him up more, if that's possible.''</p>
        <p>But the Americans, led by their captain, Ken Venturi, did not need any extra motivation, winning back the cup and reversing the script written two years ago in Melbourne, Australia, where the International side rolled to a 20 1/2-11 1/2 victory over the Americans.</p>
        <p>''We wanted to send Kenny off as the all-time points winning captain, and hopefully that's a record that's never broken,'' Davis Love III said.</p>
        <p>Love, who defeated Ernie Els, 4 and 3, was 4-0 in the competition, but he was just one of many American stars. Stewart Cink was also 4-0, while Kirk Triplett was 3-0-1. Meanwhile, two of the International team's top players, Els (0-5) and Singh (1-4), struggled from start to finish.</p>
        <p>''I'm very disappointed in my golf this week,'' said Els, the world's No. 2-ranked player.</p>
        <p>Els suffered the added insult of participating in the cup-clinching match, when he lost to Love to raise the United States point total to 17,  surpassing the 16 1/2 needed to win. As American players hugged and congratulated each other throughout the afternoon, they soaked in the success of giving the United States simultaneous possession of both the Ryder Cup and the Presidents Cup for the first time since 1994.</p>
        <p>''Winning the Ryder Cup the way we did last year, followed by the death of Payne Stewart shortly after that, brought the top American players together like never before,'' Love said. ''We got tired of people saying we were spoiled, and that we didn't care. We're a little spoiled. But we care a lot.''</p>
        <p>Woods never let up in his match with Singh, refusing to concede an 18-inch putt on No. 4. Later, Singh congratulated Woods on the American victory, but because his match with Singh was still in progress, Woods kept the pleasantries short.</p>
        <p>''He came over and congratulated me about winning the cup and I said:  'Don't forget about me, and don't forget about us. I'm still standing here, looking you right in the eye.' I didn't want him to back off. That's what I expect.''</p>
        <p>But will Woods and other top American players go to South Africa in two years? Woods, Love and Mickelson said it was too early to think about their 2002 schedules, but Els, a native of South Africa, clearly hoped all the top eligible players would participate. While Americans have either a Ryder Cup or Presidents Cup every year, non-European players like Els are not eligible for the Ryder Cup, making the Presidents Cup dear.</p>
        <p>''We'll see how much they really love this cup they just won,'' Els said. ''Seventy or 80 percent of our guys have to travel as far as theirs have to.''</p>
        <p>Finchem insisted it was more important to focus on the mission of spreading golf globally, rather than focusing on who might not play in the future. ''Any event wants to have Tiger Woods,'' he said. ''I'm less concerned at this point about any individual player. I'm more concerned about the direction and development of the Presidents Cup.''</p>
        <p>Regardless, for the next two years, possession of the cup belongs to the Americans.</p>
        <p>''We've been waiting for our chance to get this cup back,'' Love said. ''It was a great week for our team.''</p>
