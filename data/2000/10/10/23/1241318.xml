        <p>In his pregame news conference yesterday, Manager Bobby Valentine of the Mets implied that the dirt in front of home plate in Saturday's game was deliberately softened and resulted in a slowing of Timo Perez's ninth-inning grounder. Catcher Todd Pratt, the runner on third base, did not break for home and never scored.</p>
        <p>Not so subtly, Valentine suggested the Yankees watered down the home plate area because Andy Pettitte, a ground ball pitcher, started the game.</p>

        <p>Manager Joe Torre of the Yankees did not buy the theory. ''I know one thing,'' he said. ''I think a lot of it has to do with the weather. The Dodgers used to do that. That's probably why he's mentioning it. We don't try to do anything different.''</p>
