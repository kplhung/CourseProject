        <p>The fall of 1956 was a splendid time to be in New York. The city was at the top of its game.</p>
        <p>A subway token was 15 cents and there were so many daily newspapers you could hurt yourself trying to carry them all home.</p>
        <p>Gwen Verdon (who died just last week at the age of 75) was starring in ''Damn Yankees'' at the 46th Street Theater. Judy Garland was at the Palace. John Raitt (Bonnie's father) was in ''The Pajama Game'' at the St. James Theater. And at the Mark Hellinger, on West 51st Street, Rex Harrison and Julie Andrews were making theater history with ''My Fair Lady.''</p>
        <p>You must have heard by now, there was a Subway Series that year. And when the elegant Yankees of the Bronx were ushered into the raucous, rundown digs of their rivals from Brooklyn, no less than the president of the United States, Dwight Eisenhower, was on hand to throw out the first ball.</p>
        <p>Mr. Eisenhower, who was running for re-election against Adlai Stevenson, fended off invitations to take the IRT or the BMT to Ebbets Field. He showed up in a Cadillac limousine with a motorcycle escort and was driven all the way to home plate. The 34,000 mostly Dodger fans erupted in sustained applause as the president and World War II hero tossed the ceremonial first pitch to the veteran catcher Roy Campanella.</p>
        <p>The first game was played in glorious weather. The sky was a brilliant blue and temperatures were in the low 70's. The Dodgers won, 6-3.</p>
        <p>All of this seemed normal to New Yorkers in 1956. Of course there was brilliant fare on Broadway. And, yes, there were three major league teams in town, and their centerfielders were named Mantle and Snider and Mays. And why wouldn't the president drop by for a visit? The city took greatness for granted.</p>
        <p>The Dodgers won the second game, 13-8, crushing the Yankee starter, Don Larsen. (Larsen was one of several free spirits on the Yankees. He broke the team's midnight curfew during spring training in 1956 and had a car accident. After hearing what had happened, the Yankees' normally verbose manager, Casey Stengel, offered a terse comment: ''That man was either out too late or up too early.'')</p>
        <p>What could not be known by New Yorkers or anybody else in 1956 was that staggering changes were imminent. (A year later both the Dodgers and the Giants had left New York, and Orval Faubus and Sputnik had elbowed their way into the national vocabulary.) The comfortable, familiar, traditional ordinary life to which most Americans had become accustomed -- that easy to understand and reasonably paced existence that was almost perfectly mirrored in the easy pace of the national pastime -- would soon be so thoroughly discombobulated that it could never again be put together in quite the same way. The Sixties were coming. And the Fifties were about to vaporize into a permanent state of nostalgia.</p>
        <p>Who could know, as they watched the familiar, scrappy performances of Reese and Robinson and Mantle and Berra, that the next subway series would not occur for 44 years, not until three of those four had passed on  -- not until the year 2000, an almost unimaginable concept in 1956?</p>
        <p>The series shifted to Yankee Stadium for the third game, and the Yankees won, 5-3. The decisive blow was a three-run homer by Enos Slaughter, an outfielder who was born in 1916. The Yanks won the fourth game, 6-2. And then it was Larsen's turn to pitch again. All he did was hurl a masterpiece, retiring 27 Dodgers in a row. Three up and three down for nine innings. It remains the only perfect game in World Series history.</p>
        <p>The Yankees went on to win the series in seven games. President Eisenhower went on to defeat Adlai Stevenson and win re-election. There was no sense of radical changes in the wind. But Elvis Presley was already working his magic, and Jack Kennedy, denied a vice-presidential bid in 1956, would gear up for a presidential run in 1960.</p>
        <p>The birth control pill was already in the works and the civil rights movement was swelling, swelling.</p>
        <p>Dodger fans went home after the seventh game with a familiar sense of disappointment. But they were heartened to read in the papers a few days later that the Dodgers were not planning a move to Los Angeles because a new stadium in Brooklyn was assured.</p>
