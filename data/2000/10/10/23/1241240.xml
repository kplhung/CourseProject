        <p>Despite new clues suggesting that the bombing of the destroyer Cole may have involved more than the two men who died in the blast, American officials cautioned today against concluding that they were close to identifying the group responsible or to retaliating militarily.</p>
        <p>Eleven days after the attack that killed 17 sailors and wounded 39, Yemeni officials working with the Americans in the investigation said they had found three more safe houses, bringing the total discovered so far to five. Yemeni security sources also said that a group of officials in Lahej, a town about 25  miles north, had been detained for allegedly allowing offices there to issue identity documents with assumed names that were used in the conspiracy.</p>
        <p>One of those documents was an identity card thought to have belonged to one of the two men who pulled a skiff alongside the Cole in Aden harbor and detonated enough explosives to blow a hole 40 feet in diameter in the vessel's port side. In a report citing Yemeni security sources close to the investigation, the Associated Press said today that the document was issued in the name of Abdullah Ahmed Khaled al-Musawah, but the American and Yemeni officials refused to confirm the name or to say that the name represented a significant breakthrough.</p>
        <p>The identity card was part of a haul of evidence uncovered by the Yemenis earlier last week when a 12-year-old Yemeni boy led them to an abandoned vehicle and a boat trailer left beside a remote boat ramp about six miles from the harbor mooring point where the Cole was attacked. The boy also led them to the first two safe houses, in the neighborhoods of Little Aden and Medinat Ash Shab. Yemeni officials, who reported today that they had uncovered the additional safe houses, would only say they  were in or near Aden.</p>
        <p>When the earlier discoveries were made known, six days after the bombing, American officials implied that the trail followed by F.B.I. agents, who have accompanied Yemeni investigators at every stage of the probe, had gone cold after it was established that an important document found in one of the houses, a driver's license was issued in a false name. The trail led, among other places, to Hadhramaut, a remote province in eastern Yemen named on the license as the holder's place of origin.</p>
        <p>This left them with a photograph of a man on the license, said to have been in his 30's or early 40's, who investigators believe may have been ''the bearded man with spectacles'' identified by the Yemeni boy as having drawn up in the vehicle on the morning of the Cole attack.</p>
        <p>Today, a Yemeni official confirmed that the vehicle found near the boat ramp was a Nissan with four-wheel drive, a kind widely used in this country of rocky deserts and rugged mountain passes. Officials in Washington have said the boat was 20 to 26 feet long and white, and that shards found on the Cole, now being examined along with other evidence at F.B.I. laboratories in Washington, indicated that it was made of fiberglass. A tank apparently used to test the boat's outboard motor was found at one of the safe houses</p>
        <p>Barbara K. Bodine, the American ambassador to Yemen, said on Saturday that the investigation was ''expanding,'' to the point that American officials were confident that they would break the case. But after the  report today about a name on the driver's license, American officials here tried to discourage speculation that they were closing in on suspects. They said their ''prime suspect'' was  ''the broad jihadist network'' -- the  array of Islamic militant groups from east Asia to the Middle East that have declared a ''holy war,'' or jihad in Arabic, against the United States.</p>
        <p>At a briefing, the officials insisted that they were far away from being able to recommend possible targets for a retaliatory American military strike of the kind hinted at by President Clinton, who vowed after the Cole attack that those responsible would be held ''accountable'' and allowed ''no safe harbor.'' After the terrorist bombings of two American embassies in east Africa in August, 1998, Mr. Clinton ordered Navy cruise missile strikes on targets in Sudan and Afghanistan, saying that an American investigation had identified Osama bin Laden, the Saudi Arabian exile and Islamic militant living in Afghanistan as the prime figure in the attacks.</p>
        <p>Mr. bin Laden, who has a $5 million American reward on his head, recently issued warnings of fresh attacks on American targets through a videotape delivered to an Arab-language satellite television channel in Qatar. His name has frequently entered into the Cole investigation, especially after President Ali Abdullah Saleh of Yemen disclosed that the fake driver's license named Hadhramaut, the ancestral home of Mr. bin Laden's family, which moved to Saudi Arabia in the 1950's.</p>
        <p>American officials have insisted from the outset of the Cole investigation that their priority in making public statements would be to avoid anything that would ''chill leads.'' This has suggested that they will have a strong incentive to avoid giving out information that would tip off potential targets of a military strike, as appears to have happened in 1998, when Mr. bin Laden fled one of his training camps in Afghanistan shortly before the missiles struck.</p>
        <p>But today they insisted that there was nothing yet to justify speculation that an attack might be imminent. They acknowledged that Mr. bin Laden's recent marriage in the Afghan city of Kandahar to a Yemeni woman, possibly one from Hadhramaut, could indicate he wanted to strengthen contacts with Yemen ahead of a possible move from Afghanistan, but insisted that they were not yet focusing on any individual, group or country as responsible for the Cole attack.</p>
        <p>''Even if you were considering a military response at this point, we have no idea where,'' one official said. ''Do we go to Afghanistan, Pakistan -- that's way down the line.''</p>
