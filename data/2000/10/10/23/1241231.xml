        <p>Ten months after the military seized power in an initially popular coup, Ivoirians voted today in a presidential election that included the putsch leader and four civilian candidates, but excluded those of the two biggest parties.</p>
        <p>The ballot, which followed tense weeks when political and ethnic rivalries pushed this West African nation on a knife-edge, took place peacefully across the country. Voter turnout, perhaps the most critical factor in an election that was boycotted by the two major parties, appeared low at a dozen voting stations here in the commercial capital.</p>
        <p>The election, whose results were not expected until Monday at the earliest, pitted the junta leader, Gen. Robert Guei, against Laurent Gbagbo, the leader of the Ivorian Popular Front, the country's third largest party, as well as three little-known candidates. Whatever the election's outcome, the winner will find it difficult to be recognized here and abroad.</p>
        <p>Most international observers withdrew from the Ivory Coast earlier this month after a court controlled by General Guei eliminated the candidates of the two biggest parties, including the Rally of the Republicans led by Alassane D. Ouattara, a former deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund. The United States and the European Union also cut their financial support toward the election, saying the election was flawed from the start.</p>
        <p>Inside the Ivory Coast, the 40 percent of the population that is Muslim felt alienated after the court eliminated all candidates from the Muslim north, leaving five, all Christians from the south. In recent months, both General Guei and Mr. Gbagbo ran xenophobic campaigns aimed against northerners.</p>
        <p>Fear of what might follow the election cast a shadow over the vote today. In the working-class neighborhood of Yopougon, Leon Adouby, a 30-year-old accountant, woke up early this morning to stand in line before the polls opened at 8 a.m. Mr. Adouby, a longtime supporter of Mr. Gbagbo, was nevertheless worried that the country's oldest and richest party, the Democratic Party of the Ivory Coast, had not been allowed to participate.</p>
        <p>''The P.D.C.I. is a heavyweight,'' Mr. Adouby said, using the party's French acronym. ''If you don't put the P.D.C.I. in this dance and a president is elected, the results won't be clear. Unfortunately, there will be a gap -- and that worries me.''</p>
        <p>General Guei, who ran as an independent after failing to become the candidate of the Democratic Party of the Ivory Coast, cast his ballot today at a school just outside his house. Dressed in a light-blue suit, the general, who barely campaigned because of security concerns, came to the voting station accompanied by scores of soldiers and police officers.</p>
        <p>''The Ivory Coast is a country of peace where everything takes place in serenity,'' the general said. ''The winner will win.''</p>
        <p>An hour later, Mr. Gbagbo, a socialist who is the country's oldest opposition figure, was more combative after voting.</p>
        <p>''It's difficult for me to imagine that I could lose,'' he said, expressing worries that the general's supporters might commit fraud. He added: ''I hope the losers won't be sore losers.''</p>
        <p>It was too early to tell how many of the country's 5.5 million registered voters came out today. But in Abidjan visits to several neighborhoods indicated that turnout was lower than the one for a constitutional referendum in July, which had the participation of all the parties.</p>
        <p>This time, leaders of the Democratic Party of the Ivory Coast and the Rally of the Republicans -- which together won 75 percent of the votes in the 1995 legislative elections -- instructed their followers to boycott the vote.</p>
        <p>And so lines at voting booths were thin in neighborhoods like Adjame or Abobo, considered strongholds of the Rally of the Republicans. Many stations were deserted.</p>
        <p>Among voters interviewed at different stations, almost all said they had chosen Mr. Gbagbo.</p>
        <p>''We must elect a civilian candidate,'' said Frederic Gbessi Guie, a 30-year-old teacher. ''We cannot reward a man who seized power by force. If he stays in power, our country's problems will continue. We'll still be cut off by the international donors.''</p>
