        <p>The Baltimore Ravens are among the best-run, most talent-laden teams in the National Football League, with a hungry defense and young draft picks who are paying dividends. But this is what the Ravens' season has come to: The team is looking to Trent Dilfer as a possible savior.</p>
        <p>All season long, and again today when the Tennessee Titans defeated the Ravens by 14-6, quarterback Tony Banks has dragged down a team that seems almost ready to burst into a juggernaut.</p>
        <p>You do not win the Indianapolis 500 with a unicycle. So after watching Banks lead the offense nowhere yet again -- the Ravens have gone 16 quarters without a touchdown -- Coach Brian Billick benched him for Dilfer. Banks had thrown two critical interceptions, one of which was returned for a Tennessee touchdown.</p>
        <p>But this is the same Dilfer for whom the Tampa Bay Buccaneers could not buy a ticket out of town fast enough. Dilfer entered the game in the fourth quarter with the Ravens trailing, 14-6. The Ravens' offense was yet again provided a gift turnover by Baltimore's blue-collar defense, with an interception of Titans quarterback Steve McNair.</p>
        <p>Then Dilfer did an imitation of Banks, throwing a bad pass right into the arms of Titans defensive back Michael Booker at the Titan 22-yard line.</p>
        <p>The 69,200 fans at PSINet Stadium had been booing Banks relentlessly for much of the game, screaming for Dilfer as if he were a rap star.</p>
        <p>Be careful what you wish for.</p>
        <p>When asked if the team was in the middle of an offensive crisis, Billick replied: ''What's happening in the Middle East is a crisis. This isn't a crisis.''</p>
        <p>Maybe not, but clearly Billick, who would not name next week's starter, is frustrated, especially when his defense is playing so well. His offense has not scored a touchdown in its last 49 possessions.</p>
        <p>The Ravens, who are 5-3, knocked the Titans' Pro Bowl running back, Eddie George, out the game and held Tennessee to just one offensive touchdown. Baltimore's defense forced two turnovers, and it held McNair to 101 yards passing and the Titans to only 90 yards rushing. The Ravens have not allowed a 100-yard rusher in 25 straight games.</p>
        <p>If they had an offense that could rank just in the top 20, not the bottom 10, this team might go undefeated.</p>
        <p>''For some reason, we get inside the 20-yard line,'' tight end Shannon Sharpe said, ''and fall to pieces.''</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the 6-1 Titans, who have sole possession of first place in the American Football Conference Central, are probably the class of the conference.</p>
        <p>The game was extremely hard hitting, with smashing blocks, crushing tackles and two of the best defenses in the sport.</p>
        <p>The game also featured two significant injuries. George was sidelined in the first quarter with a sprained right knee and did not return. He has a sprained medial collateral ligament and is questionable for Tennessee's game next week against the Washington Redskins.</p>
        <p>There was also a scary moment when Baltimore defensive lineman Tony Siragusa was hit in the head with a forearm by Titans fullback Lorenzo Neal. Siragusa's head snapped backward, and he immediately crashed to the ground.</p>
        <p>Siragusa left the game strapped to a cart and was examined at a local hospital. The team's doctors determined that he had bruised his spine, and they allowed Siragusa to return to the game.</p>
        <p>''That was the scariest moment of my career,'' Siragusa said.</p>
        <p>Despite their offensive troubles, the Ravens still almost tied the score with less than two minutes remaining. On fourth-and-22 at the Tennessee 33, Dilfer found wide receiver Qadry Ismail in the back left corner of the end zone; Ismail dragged his left foot, his toes grazing the out-of-bounds line. The official ruled the pass incomplete, and his call was upheld after a replay challenge.</p>
        <p>Baltimore remains confident despite its problems, and some players are even keeping their sense of humor. When asked if he has ever experienced an offensive drought like this before, Dilfer smiled and replied, ''Did you not watch the Bucs play when I was there?''</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>The Baltimore Ravens quietly filed a complaint with the National Football League this weekend on a possible rules violation by the Washington Redskins. The complaint stems from a game between the two teams last week. The Ravens say the Redskins broke league rules by playing music or making statements over the public-address system while Baltimore's offense broke its huddle or was at the line of scrimmage. Washington has been fined twice by the N.F.L. for similar infractions. The Ravens also filed a complaint against the Jacksonville Jaguars,  contending that the Jaguars committed the same violations in a game there on Oct. 8.</p>
