        <p>While saying Tim McClelland, the left-field umpire in Game 1, made the right call on Todd Zeile's near-homer on Saturday, Bobby Valentine said McClelland's inactivity may have caused a base-running mistake by Timo Perez.</p>
        <p>When Zeile's two-out drive in the sixth inning deflected off the top of the left-field wall and stayed in play, Perez hesitated on the bases, thinking the ball was a homer. He ended up being thrown out at home.</p>
        <p>''If he does this,'' Valentine said of McClelland, spreading his arms in a ''safe'' motion, ''Timo keeps running.''</p>
        <p>''Not to put any blame on the umpire, but the call is a safe call, and the players probably react a lot quicker if it's a safe call.'' he said.</p>
        <p>Perez, however, said he never looked at the umpire. ''I was sure it was a home run, and I was confused,'' he said.</p>
