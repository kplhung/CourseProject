        <p>One of the nation's oldest biotechnology companies is getting a new life. ZymoGenetics Inc. said it had arranged for $150 million in private financing that would allow it to become independent of its parent company, Novo Nordisk A.S. of Denmark.</p>
        <p>The Seattle-based ZymoGenetics, founded in 1981, has been wholly owned by Novo Nordisk since 1988. Its spinout is part of a broader restructuring in which Novo will also make its industrial enzyme business into a separate company. That will leave Novo Nordisk still the world's largest maker of insulin and other products for diabetes.</p>

        <p>One of the nation's oldest biotechnology companies is getting a new life. ZymoGenetics Inc. said it had arranged for $150 million in private financing that would allow it to become independent of its parent company, Novo Nordisk A.S. of Denmark.</p>
        <p>The Seattle-based ZymoGenetics, founded in 1981, has been wholly owned by Novo Nordisk since 1988. Its spinout is part of a broader restructuring in which Novo will also make its industrial enzyme business into a separate company. That will leave Novo Nordisk still the world's largest maker of insulin and other products for diabetes.</p>
        <p>Novo Nordisk will own slightly more than 50 percent of ZymoGenetics but will have slightly less than 50 percent of the voting power in the company. The private investors in ZymoGenetics, led by E. M. Warburg Pincus &amp; Company and Patricof &amp; Company Ventures Inc., will own about 35 percent of the company on a fully diluted basis, and employees will own the rest.</p>
        <p>While ZymoGenetics has helped develop five drugs that are now sold by Novo Nordisk or other companies, it will have no drugs of its own when it starts, even drugs in clinical trials.</p>
        <p>But Bruce L. A. Carter, its chief executive, said ZymoGenetics has filed for patents on more than 500 genes that code for proteins that could potentially be used as drugs. That, he said, makes ZymoGenetics a leader in gene-based drug development although it has not attracted the attention that rivals like Human Genome Sciences have.</p>
        <p>''I think ZymoGenetics is a dark horse in the genomics race because people haven't heard of us,'' he said.</p>
        <p>ZymoGenetics has some veteran biotechnology executives on its board. George Rathmann, co-founder and former chief executive of Amgen Inc., is a director, as is Edward E. Penhoet, co-founder and former chief executive of Chiron Inc.</p>
        <p>Mads Ovlisen, chief executive of Novo Nordisk, said the restructuring was intended to allow each business better focus and would let ZymoGenetics raise more money than Novo alone could provide. With biotechnology centered in the United States, he added, ''It was also important to us to make sure we were not sitting in Copenhagen calling the shots.''</p>
