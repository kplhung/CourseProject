        <p>Chuck Knoblauch opened his mouth wide enough to fit an apple, and Jason Grimsley obliged his request by spraying a funnel of Champagne into it, as if Grimsley were shooting water into a clown's mouth at a carnival.

        <p>The Yankees are accustomed to these kinds of human floods, as childish as they often seem.

        <p>Chuck Knoblauch opened his mouth wide enough to fit an apple, and Jason Grimsley obliged his request by spraying a funnel of Champagne into it, as if Grimsley were shooting water into a clown's mouth at a carnival. The two soggy, happy Yankees were about 15 feet from the entrance to the clubhouse on Wednesday morning, stopping a steady flow of reporters with their innovative celebration. Grimsley's aim was sloppy, on purpose.</p>
        <p>The Yankees are accustomed to these kinds of human floods, as childish as they often seem. Since Joe Torre became manager in 1996, the Yankees have been involved in 16 Champagne celebrations: three World Series titles, four American League championships, four division series victories, four A.L. East titles and one A.L. wild-card berth. Yes, the Yankees have experience with treating October nights like New Year's Eve parties.</p>
        <p>More pertinent in these moments is the tenacious way the Yankees have played to earn the ability to behave foolishly. That is significant as the Yankees prepare to play the Mets in a monumental World Series that begins on Saturday at Yankee Stadium. Been there and done that in the World Series. Only the Yankees can say that.</p>
        <p>''We're playing the Mets and it's going to be special,'' Derek Jeter said. ''But it doesn't matter who you're playing when you're in the World Series. You just want to be there.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees are there again after vanquishing the Seattle Mariners in six games. Their ascent has been somewhat surprising since they sputtered at the end of the regular season, seemingly intent on casting fishing rods in October. Luis Sojo, as honest as any Yankee, said the players ''couldn't wait'' for the regular season to end.</p>
        <p>There were doubts about the Yankees and there were legitimate reasons for those doubts. They had lost 14 of their last 17 games and seemed to be dying at precisely the wrong time. Now that the Yankees have righted themselves by winning two difficult series, they are a much more dangerous team. They have gained their footing and they have more familiarity with what is ahead. The Yankees' failure to dunk Oakland in the division series and Seattle in the A.L.C.S. when they first had the opportunity has made them more aware of their fragility.</p>
        <p>''I think that when we had to go back for that Game 5 in Oakland, it was a wakeup call for everybody,'' Torre said. ''We had been able to close teams out and we didn't do that. That woke up everybody.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees are awake and alive. The Mets have been the most imposing team in October while going 7-2, and they are the most serious threat the Yankees have faced in the World Series since 1996. That means this series should not follow the path of 1998 and 1999, when the Yankees destroyed San Diego and Atlanta in four games apiece. This series will probably last seven games.</p>
        <p>Even as the Yankees trailed the Mariners, 4-0, in Game 6, the deficit did not seem onerous. Orlando Hernandez was smudged for six runs and Mariano Rivera gave up a run in the postseason for the first time since 1997. Still, the Yankees won, 9-7, behind an electrifying six-run seventh inning. Under Torre, it was the 11th time they had won a postseason game in which they trailed after the sixth inning. The statistic reflects their talent, their experience and their resiliency.</p>
        <p>''We've been here before,'' Bernie Williams said. ''This is when it's fun.''</p>
        <p>You figured El Duque would get bruised in a postseason game and he did. You figured someone other than Sandy Alomar Jr. would knock in a run against Rivera and someone did. If those things happened, the Yankees figured to lose. But those things happened and the Yankees still prevailed. That is revealing. Hernandez and Rivera have endured their hiccups for the month. Do not expect any against the Mets.</p>
        <p>''This has been a different year for us,'' Paul O'Neill said before the Yankees won the A.L.C.S. ''In other years, we always got the breaks. Everything went our way. That hasn't always happened this year.''</p>
        <p>Not all the time, but enough times. Jose Vizcaino began the six-run rally with a pinch-hit grounder a few inches past John Olerud that he barely beat out. Derek Jeter continued the rally with a dribbling single to left. Then David Justice unloaded a three-run homer. The two hits, which could have easily been outs, seemed like breaks for the Yankees in an inning that catapulted them to their third straight World Series.</p>
        <p>An analysis of the Yankees' roster shows that the players have participated in more than 300 Champagne celebrations in the last five years. There is one more celebration looming, a New York celebration that will dwarf all others. Been there and done that in the Subway Series. Only one team will shout that later this month, the team that has taken Champagne baths after the last two World Series.</p>
