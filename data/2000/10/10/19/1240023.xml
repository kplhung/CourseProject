        <p>A team investigating the cause of a fierce fire that destroyed an unfinished apartment complex, nine houses and 12 cars in Edgewater, N.J., in August found that there was no evidence of arson, the Bergen County Prosecutor's Office announced yesterday.</p>
        <p>The fire on the block occupied by the apartment complex began on Aug. 30, creating a lake of fire hot enough to melt cars and ignite houses across the street.

        <p>A team investigating the cause of a fierce fire that destroyed an unfinished apartment complex, nine houses and 12 cars in Edgewater, N.J., in August found that there was no evidence of arson, the Bergen County Prosecutor's Office announced yesterday.</p>
        <p>The fire on the block occupied by the apartment complex began on Aug. 30, creating a lake of fire hot enough to melt cars and ignite houses across the street. It left more than 45 people homeless. In addition to the destroyed property, the report said, 11 houses and nine vehicles were heavily damaged.</p>
        <p>Because the fire moved so quickly, engulfing the timber frame of the $70 million Avalon River Mews complex in about 10 minutes, according to witnesses, some officials suspected that it had been intentionally set with a flammable liquid.</p>
        <p>But the investigation found that the fire was an accident, though it stopped short of naming a specific cause ''due to the total destruction of the scene,'' according to a statement from the prosecutor's office.</p>
        <p>Investigators identified several conditions that contributed to the speed of the blaze, which at one point shot up 200 feet, above the level of the Palisades, the cliffs overlooking Edgewater. The fire was clearly visible across the river in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>The complex's two four-story apartment buildings, which were to contain 408 luxury rental units, were in a particularly vulnerable state, because flame-retardant wallboard, fire separation walls and sprinkler systems had not yet been installed. There were few windows or walls to impede the flow of oxygen, and a breeze coming off the Hudson at 12 miles per hour may have driven the fire west.</p>
        <p>The site of the complex, owned by AvalonBay Communities of Princeton, had more than 30 substances that could accelerate a fire, but all were legal and necessary for construction of the buildings, the investigators found.</p>
        <p>The team, which included investigators from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, as well as local detectives and fire officials, had sent debris from the fire to a federal lab that specializes in detecting traces of flammable liquids such as gasoline.</p>
        <p>The investigation found that workers who used torches and other tools, or who smoked, could have ignited the blaze accidentally. There were workers on the site past the 6 p.m. curfew set by AvalonBay, possibly as late as 7:30 p.m. on the day of the fire, which began at 8 p.m.</p>
        <p>Homeowners have complained that the complex developers were granted a variance that allowed them to build 24 feet closer to the sidewalk -- thus closer to the houses across the street -- than the zoning ordinance allows.</p>
