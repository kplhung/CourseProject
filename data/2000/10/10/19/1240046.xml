        <p>Lavor Postell didn't act like a second-round pick when he was drafted by the Knicks. He nearly held out of training camp while his agent, Dan Fegan, demanded a trade over the summer. Then, when he finally signed with the Knicks, Postell spoke as if he intended to challenge the All-Stars Allan Houston and Latrell Sprewell for playing time.</p>
        <p>Postell is as cocksure as a rookie can be. The shooting guard from St. John's has backed up his big talk with aggressive play that has made him a favorite of Coach Jeff Van Gundy's. ''One thing I don't want to do is judge too much on three preseason games because a little bit of the preseason is make-believe,'' Van Gundy said last night before the Knicks routed the Milwaukee Bucks by 100-81 at Madison Square Garden. ''Some of it's a mirage. But Lavor is not a mirage.''</p>
        <p>Postell, who entered camp fighting for a roster spot, has been so impressive he seems to be fighting for a spot in the regular rotation. Through the first three games, he led the Knicks in points per minute, averaging 8.7 points in 13.7 minutes a game, while displaying a soft jumper; he shot a hefty 53.3 percent from the floor.</p>
        <p>Perhaps more important, he has displayed the hustle, tenacity and court sense that are critical to making the team. Last night, he hopped in front of a driving Mark Pope to take a charge just 33 seconds after entering the game. Minutes later, he buried a 13-foot jumper, then outran the Bucks' defense to receive a long pass from Chris Childs for a fast-break layup. Postell finished with 6 points on 3-of-8 shooting and had some trouble guarding the Bucks veterans Ray Allen and Lindsey Hunter. After committing 4 fouls in 41 minutes through the first three games, he committed 5 in 17 minutes last night.</p>
        <p>''I've seen a lot of guys fail and why they've failed, and I've seen a lot of guys succeed and why they've succeeded, and Lavor is on the path to success,'' Van Gundy said. ''He's going to be a winning player in this league who helps you win.''</p>
        <p>One of Postell's greatest traits is his unwillingness to concede to anyone. He respects Sprewell and Houston for what they have accomplished, but when going against them in practice, he plays with the same confidence he had in college.</p>
        <p>''You can never think that you're not as great as a person,'' Postell said. ''You have to think you're on the same level or better. In my case, I always think I'm better.''</p>
        <p>REBOUNDS</p>
        <p>GLEN RICE sat out with a sore left knee and is listed as day-to-day . . . MARCUS CAMBY had his third straight double-double, finishing with 18  points and 10 rebounds. ALLAN HOUSTON also had 18 points. CHRIS CHILDS led the Knicks with 6 assists, giving him 14 assists in the last two games.</p>
