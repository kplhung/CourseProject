        <p>SEDGWICK CLARK can tell you who coughed during the Wagner at the New York Philharmonic. Not last night, not the night before, but on Jan. 26, 1970.</p>
        <p>The hacker was, in a sense, a hacker: A concertgoer who lugged a bulky, battery-powered tape recorder into Avery Fisher Hall without being noticed by the ushers and made an unauthorized recording of Leonard Bernstein conducting a concert version of ''Gotterdammerung'' with the soprano Eileen Farrell and the tenor Jess Thomas. And made Mr. Clark's job easy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clark is the ears of the Philharmonic's effort to listen to and sell recordings of performances that were never commercially released. The pirate tape of the Wagner was the only known recording of a performance that Mr. Clark had heard musicians rave about. And by including it with 32 other performances in ''Bernstein Live,'' a set of 10 compact discs that the Philharmonic is releasing this month, Mr. Clark did the musicians a favor: They will now receive royalties for a pirate recording.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clark figures that he listened to nearly 100 Bernstein performances -- tapes of old radio broadcasts, mostly, plus the occasional pirate recording -- in deciding which pieces to recommend for the compact disc set.</p>
        <p>The Philharmonic has engineers who can scrub some of the static out of scratchy recordings. But they do not go to work until after Mr. Clark has decided that the Monday night performance of ''Gotterdammerung'' was better than the Thursday performance (and probably not quite as good as the Saturday performance, but it seems that the pirate with the tape recorder, who was at the Saturday concert, did not turn on his machine until after intermission).</p>
        <p>''Sedge's ears worry the sound more than anyone else's I know,'' says Barbara Haws, the Philharmonic's archivist. ''He is that fine-tuned to it. Sedge will hear and worry every potential flaw that may not bother the regular listener.''</p>
        <p>He can hear the subway rumbling under Carnegie Hall -- he says there is a particularly good example during a 1958 performance of Anton Webern's ''Six Pieces for Orchestra'' on ''Bernstein Live.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clark does his listening in a room in his house in East Hampton, N.Y., which is in the same color scheme as Carnegie Hall. That means Benjamin Moore bone white flat on the walls and Benjamin Moore No. 1109 semigloss around the doors. The fabric on his sofa? Cardinal red, the same as the seats. He has a letter from Carnegie Hall confirming the colors.</p>
        <p>Now, about the walls. Carnegie Hall has balconies. Mr. Clark has little balconies, if you think of shelves for compact discs that way. He says he has 8,000 -- his balconies are packed, and he has another stash of compact discs in a closet, castoffs he has decided he does not want.</p>
        <p>HE also has 20,000 long-playing records. And then there are some recordings the Philharmonic made in 1922 -- ''Quite primitive, but it's amazing how much you can hear,'' he says -- that turned up at a garage sale.</p>
        <p>''Look, I'm a fan,'' says Mr. Clark, who is also editor of the Musical America directory and a regular columnist for the North American edition of Gramophone, the British music magazine. ''I sit down and listen to old broadcasts of things I love by musicians I love and I get to winnow these things down. I was hired to do the listening. Then I get to see whether my judgment's any good.''</p>
        <p>The lineup for ''Bernstein Live'' was decided upon at a listening session with the music director, Kurt Masur, and members of the orchestra. Mr. Masur has veto power over Mr. Clark's recommendations and sometimes uses it: Mr. Masur disapproved of a performance of Aaron Copland's ''Short Symphony.'' ''I said, 'This isn't played all that well, but it's the best interpretation I've ever heard,' '' Mr. Clark said. ''He agreed it wasn't played very well, and we threw it out. He said it doesn't represent the Philharmonic. It's not releasable.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clark grew up in Muncie, Ind. He arrived at Hanover College, in Hanover, Ind., in 1964 with an armload of LP's: middle-of-the-road like Ferrante and Teicher. His roommate sniffed, handed him an album and said, ''Sedgwick, this is a great piece of music.'' It was Stravinsky's ''Rite of Spring.''</p>
        <p>''I didn't get it,'' says Mr. Clark, who was a philosophy major. ''I had to listen 20 times before I got it.'' Then, on his own, he got ''Petrouchka.'' Then someone got back at him for playing ''Petrouchka'' over and over and stole the record.</p>
        <p>He moved to New York in 1968, Bernstein's last season as music director of the Philharmonic -- ''I just made it in time,'' Mr. Clark says -- and started going to concerts. He had a front-row seat when Bernstein conducted Mahler's Symphony No. 3.</p>
        <p>''His baton slipped out of his hand, bounced off Lorne Munroe's cello and landed in my lap. I put it up on the stage and Munroe picked it up and handed it back to him.'' And went backstage for an autograph, as he did, another evening, after a performance of Luciano Berio's ''Sinfonia.''</p>
        <p>''I said in my most naive way, 'I could hear Vietnam in that last movement. Bernstein said, 'I'll tell Luciano.' ''</p>
        <p>A pause.</p>
        <p>''This is pure stage-door-Johnny stuff,'' Mr. Clark sighs, and turns up the volume.</p>
