        <p>Maria Sanchez's own children told her they needed help with their weight. But until the family began attending an experimental weight-loss program for Mexican-American families, run by a Stanford University pediatrician, they had no idea where or how to cut back.</p>
        <p>Breakfast, for example. They ate pan dulce, a version of doughnuts, every single day. Then they discovered that the Stanford program, which labels foods red, yellow, or green, with meanings like a traffic signal's, deems pan dulce to be red.</p>
        <p>The family members quickly decided to eat cereal with skim milk in the morning. Then, to their great surprise, they discovered that all sorts of other foods that they had eaten with abandon, thinking they were not at all fattening, were actually red. Flavored low-fat yogurt, for example.</p>
        <p>''I said, 'Come on, don't tell me it's red,' '' Mrs. Sanchez said, surprised to learn that the yogurt is loaded with calories.</p>
        <p>Taco salads at Taco Bell? More calories than a Big Mac, they learned. And peanut butter?</p>
        <p>Esther Castro Rodriguez, who joined the program with her 10-year-old son, Christian, said she was reeling after learning that peanut butter was in the red category.</p>
        <p>''I thought that because it was vegetable oil it was good,'' Mrs. Rodriguez said.</p>
        <p>The program was part of a nationwide response to an increasing alarm over the growing girth of American children. In recent years, public health officials have been warning that in all age ranges and in all income groups, children are getting fatter. And no one is sure what to do about it. In the Stanford program, one idea is to make families aware of where calories lurk.</p>
        <p>At a recent meeting of the Stanford group in East Palo Alto, Calif., about two dozen beaming parents and shy children sat politely talking about the enormous changes they were making in what they ate and how they prepared it and about the social obstacles -- like dinner at grandmother's house or lunch at school -- yet to be overcome.</p>
        <p>''My mom used to cook all her meats with oil,'' 10-year-old Edgar Sandoval said. ''Now she bought a grill. She grills them now.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Rodriguez said: ''My children, I don't have to be saying, 'Don't eat more ice cream.' They don't want to eat more ice cream. They don't want red lights.''</p>
        <p>It was too soon -- five weeks into the six-month program -- to talk about weight loss, since the plan is  designed to steer children toward healthy eating rather than providing a quick fix.</p>
        <p>But some children said with pride that they had already dropped a few pounds and the families clearly expected great success.</p>
        <p>Dr. Thomas Robinson, an assistant professor of pediatrics and medicine at Stanford University, was more circumspect, hoping instead that he could gather enough promising data from this pilot program to get grants to extend it, adding more families, and determining whether it could  make a difference in the long run.</p>
        <p>But Dr. Robinson is the first to say that there are more questions than answers about why a growing number of American children are obese. Is his program a way to help curb the trend, or will the children, already subject to the social miseries of being overweight, end up feeling like failures? Will they lose little or no weight? Or will they lose weight only to regain it?</p>
        <p>The statistics on fat children are not encouraging.</p>
        <p>From 1976 to 1980, the National Center for Health Statistics reported, 6.5 percent of children ages 6 to 11 were overweight, defined as heavier than 95 percent of children of the same age in population studies in the 1960's and 1970's. A decade later, that fraction had nearly doubled. From 1990 to 1994, the center said, 11.4 percent of children in that age group were overweight.</p>
        <p>Mexican-American children, like those in Dr. Robinson's program, appear to be among the most affected, although it is not clear why. National statistics show that  from 1990 to 1994 the percentage of overweight Mexican-American children increased to 17.7 percent from 13.3 percent in the period 1976 to 1980.</p>
        <p>But unlike in adults, who as a group -- fat, thin and in between -- are heavier than they used to be, obesity seems to be preferentially striking children who are already overweight, making them fatter while the thin children remain thin. The result, said Dr. Katherine Flegal, a statistician at the National Center for Health Statistics, is an ever-increasing number of children who are classified as too fat and a bigger gap than ever between the weights of the fat and the thin.</p>
        <p>But, Dr. Flegal said, ''There really is no strong relationship between obesity and social class in children, as there tends to be in adults.'' In adult women in particular, she said, those who are poor or have less education tend to be fatter than those who are richer and better educated.</p>
        <p>Many fat children and teenagers find themselves isolated and subjected to the derisive stares and comments of strangers,  who assume that their weight problem is of their own making, weight-loss experts say.  Doctors say they are concerned about the long-term health consequences. A fat child may be a fat adult, they say, and prone to problems like diabetes, high blood pressure and arthritis.</p>
        <p>Every commentator, it seems, has an answer to why fat children are getting fatter: too much television, parents who cannot say no when a child wants a super-size soda, ever-growing portions of food or too little physical education in schools.</p>
        <p>But many scientists say the reasons are unknown, so answers are mainly speculation. Whatever the cause, obesity in children is now so common that some experts, like Dr. Robinson, say that they are becoming inured.</p>
        <p>''Ten, 15 years ago, the people who were showing up for treatment were 40 percent overweight,'' Dr. Robinson said.</p>
        <p>Now, he said, the children he treats are averaging 80 percent overweight, meaning that if the average weight for a child at a certain age and height is 100 pounds, the average overweight child treated by Dr. Robinson would weigh 180.</p>
        <p>''I think people's opinions of what is overweight has changed,'' Dr. Robinson said. ''I find myself looking at a kid and saying, 'They don't look so overweight.' Then I calculate it and they're 50 percent overweight.''</p>
        <p>Activity and Weight</p>
        <p>Dr. Richard S. Strauss says the reason for the obesity epidemic among children is obvious: children are so inactive as to defy belief.</p>
        <p>''It's pretty clear what's going on,'' said Dr. Strauss, who directs the childhood weight-control program at the Robert Wood Johnson School of Medicine in New Brunswick, N.J. Children used to play outside. Now they just sit in front of a television set or a computer screen.</p>
        <p>''Being inside used to be boring,'' Dr. Strauss said. ''Now it's exciting.''</p>
        <p>He and his colleagues recently completed a study of children ages 10 to 16, giving them monitors to measure how active they were.</p>
        <p>''We found that for about 10 hours of the day they're basically doing nothing,'' Dr. Strauss said. ''And what we call vigorous activity -- moving faster than three and a half miles an hour -- that was on average 12 minutes a day.''</p>
        <p>He was not surprised. ''It was pretty much equivalent to what other recent studies had showed,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But were children more active a decade or two ago? No one knows for sure. ''The ways to monitor physical activity are much newer than that,'' Dr. Strauss said.</p>
        <p>The other side of the obesity picture is eating. Many blame what children consume and the way meal times seem to have fallen by the wayside.</p>
        <p>''We don't sit together at the dinner table in a peaceful environment, but instead grab a 1,200-calorie fast-food meal,'' said Dr. David Ludwig, a pediatrician who does diet research and runs a pediatric weight-loss clinic at Children's Hospital in Boston.</p>
        <p>National survey data, however, have created a puzzle. Children today do not report eating more than they did in decades past and, in fact, according to their answers to the same questions asked in previous surveys, may be eating slightly less.</p>
        <p>But researchers note that it takes just a tiny energy imbalance -- a few more calories eaten than are burned -- for pounds to creep on. It is a difference so small that it could easily be below what surveys can detect.</p>
        <p>''To gain 15 pounds in a year, you only have to have an imbalance of 150 calories a day, which is one soft drink,'' Dr. Robinson said. ''Even a Life Saver is 10 calories. An extra Life Saver a day is a pound a year.''</p>
        <p>Some experts, like Dr. Steven Gortmaker, who directs the Harvard Prevention Research Center at the Harvard School of Public Health, have a culprit and an accomplice: television and the food industry. Not only are children sitting still while watching television but they are barraged with advertisements for food.</p>
        <p>''You have this huge industry that's spending billions of dollars getting kids to eat more,'' Dr. Gortmaker said.</p>
        <p>Studies by Dr. Gortmaker and others observing the television habits of children  found that fatter children watch more television. But such studies cannot distinguish between cause and effect. Were fat children watching more television because they were socially isolated or was watching television making them fat?</p>
        <p>''There were a number of epidemiological studies showing positive, but often weak correlations between hours of TV viewing and body weight,'' Dr. Robinson said, but he added, ''I was surprised that no one had ever tried to decrease TV viewing in kids.''</p>
        <p>He decided to conduct such an experiment, comparing 192 third-  and fourth-grade children in two schools. One was the control school, with no intervention. The other school was the focus of a concerted effort to encourage the children to watch less television.</p>
        <p>Seven months later, the children in the intervention school had gained an average of two pounds less than those in the control school and the average circumference of their waists was nearly an inch smaller.</p>
        <p>''I was amazed by the size of the effect,'' Dr. Robinson said. ''Being a scientist, I can entertain the possibility that maybe we're just lucky. At the same time, I feel that maybe there's something there.''</p>
        <p>He is now conducting a similar study among children in 12 schools to see if he gets similar results.</p>
        <p>But Dr. Robinson and others quickly point out that curbing television watching is no magic bullet.</p>
        <p>''Television is a convenient target,'' said Dr. Robert Whitaker, a pediatric obesity expert at the Children's Hospital Medical Center in Cincinnati. ''But will kids in America get lean if we turn off the TV? That's a different question.''</p>
        <p>Some experts have proposed that a combination of education and good eating habits, encouragement to exercise and programs to discourage children from watching television would make a difference. Dr. Gortmaker tried such an approach, with sixth and seventh graders in 10 schools. He found a slight decrease in obesity among the girls and no effect among the boys.</p>
        <p>''It's certainly fair to say that the effects have been modest,'' Dr. Gortmaker said. ''Yet they show you can make a difference.''</p>
        <p>For fat children, however, no one really thinks that modest effects will be enough.  And no one has found a way to prevent obesity. That leaves treatment -- providing diets and exercise programs for fat children in the hope of helping them lose weight and keep it off. But there, the most fundamental question arises: which programs work and which children should be treated?</p>
        <p>Fat Children, Fat Adults</p>
        <p>Day after day, parents who came to Dr. Whitaker's pediatric clinic would ask him the same questions: Was their fat child destined to be a fat adult? And, if so, was  there anything they could do to prevent it?</p>
        <p>Dr. Whitaker did not know how to answer. He said he worried about labeling children as abnormally overweight and in need of help, especially when some might very well outgrow their chubbiness if they were simply left alone. On the other hand, he said, he did not want to ignore a problem that might only worsen if the family did nothing.</p>
        <p>''I guess I sort of had the view that whether I considered this a problem has to do with the likelihood that it would persist over time if you did nothing,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Whitaker said he suspected that it was not just the child's weight that mattered but also the parents' weights and that the prognosis would be much grimmer if a fat child had fat parents. Dr. Whitaker said he thought that genetic controls that made people become fat and stay that way would more often occur in the children of fat parents, who presumably had the genes that kept them fat.</p>
        <p>But how much worse is it to be the fat child of fat parents? Dr. Whitaker looked for studies that would answer the question. He came up empty-handed.</p>
        <p>So Dr. Whitaker and his colleagues decided to get some answers. Using data from the Group Health Cooperative, a health maintenance organization in Puget Sound, Wash., they examined data from 854 people born from 1965 to 1971, following their heights and weights until 1994.</p>
        <p>They discovered, first, that fat infants -- those younger than 3 -- were no likelier to be fat adults than those of normal weight. But after age 3, fatness was more likely to persist. And, Dr. Whitaker said, ''the older the overweight kids were, the more likely they were to look that way as adults.''</p>
        <p>For example, children who were obese at 6 to 9 had a 55 percent chance of being obese as adults. Their risk was 10 times that of children of normal weight. Those who were obese at 10 to 14 had a 67 percent chance of being obese as adults -- 28 times the risk of their peers who were not obese.</p>
        <p>When the researchers took into account the fatness of the parents, the data became even more startling. An obese child 6 to 9 had a 37 percent chance of being an obese adult if neither parent was obese. But if at least one parent was fat, the child's change of growing up to be fat nearly doubled, to 71 percent.</p>
        <p>The work fits well with current thinking about adult obesity, medical experts say. The condition appears to have a strong genetic component -- most fat people are thought to inherit genes that keep them fat, despite their best efforts to reduce.</p>
        <p>And so it might be expected that the children of fat parents would be more likely to have a genetic predisposition to be fat themselves. But scientists do not know whether a child's weight as an adult is predetermined, no matter what diet or exercise program the child is on. That uncertainty is what gives some obesity researchers hope as they work with fat children.</p>
        <p>Dr. Whitaker says he now focuses his attention on fat children over age 3 who have at least one fat parent.</p>
        <p>''The higher the probability of the adverse outcome, the more likely you are to make a spirited recommendation,'' he said.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, he said, he is still left wondering what exactly to recommend. The problem is that an array of weight-loss programs and nutritional counselors advertise that they can help fat children lose weight and keep it off. But almost none bother to gather or report long-term results.</p>
        <p>Dr. Strauss, for example, who does research on pediatric obesity and directs the pediatric weight-control program at the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, said he had no data on whether the children and teenagers who came for the sessions with him, a nutritionist and a behavioral counselor, could keep off any weight they lost.</p>
        <p>''What we set as a goal is that three, four months from now you look back and see that you're eating better, you're more active,'' Dr. Strauss said. ''Then you can say you've been successful and you can see what your weight does.''</p>
        <p>Teaching Life Control</p>
        <p>One of the few who has gathered data on the success of weight-loss programs for children is Dr. Leonard Epstein, a professor of pediatric, social and preventive medicine at the State University of New York in Buffalo. It is his view that most fat children remain fat.</p>
        <p>In the one study he did with a control group of children who were not treated, Dr. Epstein found that 25 percent to 30 percent of the children in his program lost weight to the extent that they were not obese and kept it off for a decade. Only 4 percent of the children in the control group lost weight and kept it off.</p>
        <p>''It's hard, oh it's very hard, to get changes,'' Dr. Epstein said.</p>
        <p>Even when obese children lost weight, they were often still overweight, he said.</p>
        <p>But, he said, ''if a child starts out at 80 percent overweight and ends up at 50 percent overweight, that kid is probably better off.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Epstein said he taught parents how to set food limits, how to make good food choices and keep fattening foods out of the house and how to keep their children away from the television set.</p>
        <p>''We taught parents how to get control of their sedentary lives, to change the environment so there is less access to TV and computer games,'' he said. ''The biggest part of our program isn't what sort of diet you should be on or what sort of exercise program you should be on. It's parenting.''</p>
        <p>But, for now, no one can claim to have a good and reproducible method for preventing obesity in children or for curing it. Treatment programs are expensive and, especially since there is no evidence that they work, they are seldom paid for by health insurance. That leaves parents and pediatricians in a quandary over whether to treat a fat child or leave the child alone.</p>
        <p>Some obesity experts would agree, saying  they are so concerned about the future lives and health of fat children that they advocate treatment even when the treatment's success has not been documented.</p>
        <p>''I think it's better to do something, especially if it's based on sound nutritional advice and physical activity regimens,'' said Dr. Claude Bouchard, who directs the Pennington Biomedical Research Center at Louisiana State University. ''I think we should act.''</p>
        <p>Others caution that throwing treatments at children can do more harm than good, adding to the misery of being fat.</p>
        <p>''I know that urging kids to lose weight and putting them on a diet is not a good thing to do,'' said Dr. Evan Charney, chairman emeritus of the department of pediatrics at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center. ''Almost all will fail and then you blame them -- you blame the victim.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Barry Kessler, a pediatrician in private practice in Egg Harbor Township, N.J., said: ''It's a toughie. It's a really frustrating thing for pediatricians. We like to see kids get well really fast, and this is not something that goes really fast and many times we don't succeed.''</p>
        <p>In desperation, Dr. Kessler said he sometimes sent fat children and their families to a nutritionist in nearby Wilmington, Del. But, he said, all too often, ''they lose weight and then they gain it back again.''</p>
        <p>2 Children, 2 Outcomes</p>
        <p>If ever there were two people who exemplified the mysteries of obesity, they are Sandie Sabo and Cheryl Haworth.</p>
        <p>To look at Ms. Sabo today, at her current weight of 370 pounds, it might be assumed that she was always fat. But Ms. Sabo, who owns a clothing store for fat women in Carlsbad, Calif., said she was normal sized as a child and adolescent.</p>
        <p>''I was just your basic average-sized kid,'' she said. ''I never had food or eating issues at all.''</p>
        <p>It was not until adulthood that the pounds started accumulating while Ms. Sabo, increasingly desperate, tried every diet, every weight-loss program. But while she always lost weight, the pounds came right back again, and more.</p>
        <p>Ms. Sabo's history shows that a thin child can become massively obese in adulthood.  That raises the question of whether it is possible through some combination of diet and exercise in childhood to prevent people like Ms. Sabo from becoming obese. The case of Ms. Haworth, of Savannah, Ga.,  poses another question: Should parents try  to make fat children thin?</p>
        <p>The 17-year-old Ms. Haworth has been fat since she was 6 years old, and now, at 5 feet 9 inches, she weighs 300 pounds. She is also an Olympic weight lifter and so fast and so flexible that she can run a 40-yard dash in 5.5 seconds, jump 30 inches into the air, and can do a full split.</p>
        <p>Ms. Haworth has emphasized in interviews that she is healthy, fit and confident. ''I know a lot of 17-year-olds don't weigh 300 pounds, but I was never really discouraged because I was so big,'' she said recently.  ''It's who I was, who I am. I knew I wasn't the right size or shape for certain things, but I didn't let it bother me. I decided to look for something else.''</p>
        <p>Researchers also point out that many overweight people are healthy and even those who are not often need to lose only small amounts of weight -- as little as 5 or 10 pounds -- to resolve health problems like high blood pressure and elevated levels of sugar in the blood.</p>
        <p>Between the extremes exemplified by Ms. Sabo and Ms. Haworth are the families taking part in Dr. Robinson's experimental program in East Palo Alto. They are eager, enthusiastic and convinced that weight loss is of paramount importance. They are also well aware of the struggles ahead.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Sanchez, for example, worries about her mother, who lives nearby and often invites her family for dinner. ''If we eat just a little bit, she is offended,'' Mrs. Sanchez said. ''She feels like she has cooked all day for nothing. She is so happy when everyone is at the table and is asking for more.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Robinson's program is no panacea --  it is pilot program that does not assume success but instead asks if success is possible.</p>
        <p>''I feel very strongly that you don't want to create another failed experience for kids,'' Dr. Robinson said. ''There's a long history of smart and very capable researchers who have been frustrated by this problem. I want to be sure we're doing something helpful''</p>
        <p>The Fat Epidemic</p>
        <p>Previous articles in this series examined an extreme surgical treatment for weight loss, new obesity research, exercise and weight, and chronic dieters. Later articles will investigate the psychology of eating, culture and class relationships to fat and the diet business.</p>
