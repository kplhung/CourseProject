        <p>It has such a sonorous ring: Subway Series. It's certainly a lot easier to say than All-New York World Series. And it nicely conjures up baseball's working-class past, images of Pee Wee Reese taking the BMT to Ebbets Field, just like any other Brooklynite on his way to work.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, the Subway Series of 2000 may be, for the most part, a subway series in name only.</p>
        <p>For the last two years, the percentage of fans who make their way to Yankee or Shea Stadium by subway has hovered between 13 and 30 percent, with many of the games falling toward the lower end of that register.</p>
        <p>New York City Transit could not say yesterday how many straphanging fans there were at Ebbets Field and Yankee Stadium during the last subway series, in 1956, but evidence, anecdotal and otherwise, suggests it was probably well above 75 percent and even higher in earlier years, for several reasons.</p>
        <p>''Who had cars?'' asked Stan Fischler, a journalist who covered the last subway series for The New York Journal-American and remembers taking the subway to the 1941 Yankees-Dodgers series. ''We were just coming out of the Great Depression. It was a nickel to get wherever you wanted to go.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fischler, the author of several books about the subway, added, with feeling: ''Nobody in the civilized world that I lived in would have thought of going another way.''</p>
        <p>Except, of course, by trolley, he said.</p>
        <p>Even if the fans had had cars to drive, parking around Ebbets Field was limited to spots found on the street. (The main lot alone at Shea holds 5,400 cars, and there are other big lots as well; Yankee Stadium has more than 7,000 parking spaces.)</p>
        <p>In addition, the walk from the Brighton Line Prospect Park station to Ebbets Field was such a nice one, right through the envelope of aroma from the Bond Bread bakery on Flatbush Avenue.</p>
        <p>And up at Yankee Stadium, a fan could stand right on the No. 4 line platform and watch the distant game through a gap in the wall, now long gone.</p>
        <p>But these days -- even with the huge improvements in the subways over the last decade and a big jump in ridership -- the transit agency has to post signs around the system urging fans to leave their cars at home and, please, take the trains to the games.</p>
        <p>It's a far cry from the days when, as Mr. Fischler remembered, civic pride in public transportation was such that St. Louisans got all bent out of shape when New York writers called the all-St. Louis World Series in 1944 a ''trolley series.'' To St. Louisans, they were not trolleys; they were streetcars.</p>
        <p>Al O'Leary, the chief spokesman for New York City Transit, said that officials had their plan in place for this year's Subway Series and that plan was, basically, to do nothing special. Or at least to do the same thing the agency has done for many other New York playoff and Series games, adding extra trains, known as ''gap trains,'' to accommodate the extra passengers.</p>
        <p>''Because you're talking about stadiums with fixed numbers of seats, there's a limited possibility of huge numbers of people more than we are expecting taking the trains,'' Mr. O'Leary said. ''It's something that we deal with routinely during the regular season. The only thing that's different now is the atmosphere and the spirit.''</p>
        <p>He added: ''While it's largely symbolic, it still feels good to talk about a Subway Series. It's about civic pride, I guess. If nothing else, it's just fun to think about it that way.''</p>
