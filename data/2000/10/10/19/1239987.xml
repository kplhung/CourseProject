        <p>The Yankees are champions of the American League three weeks after they couldn't beat Tampa Bay and Baltimore, much less come within 10 runs of the Devil Rays and the Orioles, two of baseball's worst teams this year.</p>
        <p>Fading in memory are those losing scores of the regular season's last week: 15-4, 2-1, 11-1, 11-3, 13-2, 9-1, 7-3. The Yankees will begin the World Series on Saturday, trying to become the first team in three generations of ballplayers to win three consecutive titles, and if they succeed, that late slide will look like some statistical anomaly.</p>
        <p>The slump was more serious than that, threatening to swallow the Yankees' dynasty whole when it lingered into the early days of the playoffs. But the part of this group of Yankees that has always been somewhat overlooked because of the star-studded nature of its roster -- its mental toughness -- pulled them through those first two rounds of the playoffs.</p>
        <p>''They proved why they are world champions,'' Seattle Manager Lou Piniella said after the Yankees came back with a six-run seventh inning to win Game 6 of the American League Championship Series on Tuesday night, 9-7. ''There's no quitting over there. We knew that coming into this series. They don't rattle very easily and they play with a lot of confidence, and it showed with this team.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees all but wrapped up first place in their division in Boston on Sept. 8-10, sweeping three games from the Red Sox. With a huge lead, some players believe the team began to coast a bit. Manager Joe Torre rested some of his injured veterans, like Bernie Williams and Paul O'Neill, and it seemed as if it would be only a matter of time before the team clinched the division.</p>
        <p>Besides, the Yankees had approached September in this way in 1998 and 1999, and they had always managed to right themselves when necessary. Chili Davis, who played with the Yankees in 1998 and '99, said he never believed a team was capable of succeeding while turning on and turning off its effort until he played for the Yankees.</p>
        <p>''While Chili was here, we did it,'' said Willie Randolph, the Yankees' third base coach. ''But when you go to that well three out of four years, it's not as easy as that. You run into teams like the Oakland Athletics, who want their piece of the pie. You can get away with it when you're just dominating teams psychologically, but after a while they get tired of watching you in postseason, and that makes your job a lot tougher.''</p>
        <p>A funny thing happened. Torre spoke sharply to the team after a 16-3 loss in Toronto on Sept. 19, and invigorated, the Yankees went out the next day intent on refocusing; they were thumped, 7-2. For the first time in years, the Yankees had turned up their intensity and were not rewarded; their thin pitching staff was getting hammered, and their aging team did not automatically respond.</p>
        <p>''September was very tough because it seemed like we couldn't do anything right,'' said Jorge Posada, the Yankees' catcher. ''We really needed our pitching, and those guys really struggled. Everybody was trying hard, and it didn't happen.''</p>
        <p>They held a couple of more meetings; Torre reinstated his regular lineup; still nothing worked. On the verge of perhaps the greatest collapse in the history of baseball, they Yankees clinched the division only when the Boston Red Sox lost in Tampa, on a night Baltimore crushed the Yankees by 11 runs. The players were so confused by their failures that they waited for permission from Torre before they celebrated the division title.</p>
        <p>Veterans like O'Neill and Tino Martinez talked loudly about how the playoffs would present a whole new start, and of course that was a smoke screen; privately, several players acknowledged that they didn't know if there was enough time for them to do everything necessary to pull themselves out of the late-season dive. The pitching had been miserable; the middle relief was suspect; the offense had been nonexistent; a handful of regulars ended the year struggling for hits.</p>
        <p>But what Torre and Derek Jeter and Randolph believed was that the slump, as deep as it was, had never eroded the Yankees' inner belief that they were capable.</p>
        <p>''We don't get that down into the dumps when we do go into slumps,'' Randolph said. ''I don't think we ever lost confidence in our ability to play the type of ball that we needed to play. It's just that it was a little more difficult for guys to get it reversed. It's more of a mental thing, of trying to live up to expectations, because everyone expects us to be there.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees lost the first game of their division series to Oakland, but Andy Pettitte and Orlando Hernandez saved the stagnant offense with marvelous performances in Games 2 and 3. After Roger Clemens lost Game 4, the Yankees jumped on the Athletics' Gil Heredia for six runs in the first inning of Game 5, clung to that lead and survived to the next round.</p>
        <p>Torre cried afterward, saying he never thought anything had been so hard for the team.</p>
        <p>Seattle beat the Yankees in Game 1 of the League Championship Series, and the Mariners led Game 2 in the seventh inning. But David Justice fought the Mariners' Arthur Rhodes through a tough at-bat leading off that half-inning and slammed a double; it was as if the Yankees reverted to form. Their at-bats were more disciplined, more confident. Combined with the revived pitching of the six veterans Torre relied upon, the Yankees won four of the last five games of that series.</p>
        <p>After Justice's Game 2 at-bat, they outscored Seattle, 33-15. They were the Yankees, again, their swoon over.</p>
        <p>''There's no doubt that we could not have done what we've done without a mental toughness,'' Randolph said. ''That's one of our strong suits, really. We have good, solid players, but outside of Jeter and Bernie, we don't really have any superstars on our team. The only way we can do what we've done is be tough. We're at the doorstep now.''</p>
