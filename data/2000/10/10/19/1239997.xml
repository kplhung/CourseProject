        <p>Do partners need to get along for a business relationship to succeed? Shareholders and customers of both Northwest Airlines and Continental Airlines may want to consider the question as the two head to court next week in the government's first attempt to stop an airline merger since the industry was deregulated in 1978.</p>
        <p>Two years ago, the Justice Department's antitrust division filed a lawsuit aimed at forcing Northwest to sell its controlling stake in Continental. The two airlines, which previously had formed an alliance combining their route networks so each could serve more destinations, were named as co-defendants in the case.</p>
        <p>But their interests have since diverged.</p>
        <p>Gordon M. Bethune, Continental's outspoken chairman, has made it clear over the last year that he wants the airline to buy back its shares from Northwest. Continental has now taken the government's side. Several people involved in the trial said that the tension between the two airlines had grown so great that Northwest had been granted permission by Judge Denise Page Hood of United States District Court in Detroit to designate Continental as hostile to its interests.</p>
        <p>The battle has also spilled over into Continental's boardroom, souring relations between two key members of what many regard as the most able airline management team in the industry.</p>
        <p>Two people at Continental said that Mr. Bethune felt betrayed by Greg Brenneman, the airline's president, who sided with David Bonderman, a director and large shareholder, in a disagreement over the airline's legal strategy. Several more people close to Continental confirmed that tension between the two men had increased recently. But a Continental spokesman said, ''Management is in full agreement as to how to approach the Northwest litigation.''</p>
        <p>A spokesman for Northwest said  he could not comment on trial motions because they were sealed by the judge.</p>
        <p>In early 1998, Northwest bought control of Continental from an investment partnership controlled by Mr. Bonderman for $430 million in cash and stock. The shares amount to a 14 percent ownership stake in Continental but hold a majority of the voting rights.</p>
        <p>Northwest said that it had to buy the shares -- which were also sought by Delta Air Lines -- to preserve its alliance with Continental. It agreed to give up most of its rights over the stock by placing the shares in a six-year trust that allowed Northwest to vote them only to block a third party from acquiring Continental.</p>
        <p>But the government charged that the deal amounted to a takeover of Continental -- one that would lead to higher ticket prices and diminished service for more than four million passengers traveling on seven routes dominated by the two carriers.</p>
        <p>Almost immediately after the deal was concluded, tensions between the management teams of the two airlines began to emerge. Continental, which prides itself on having superior customer service and high employee morale, complained that Northwest was dragging down its reputation.</p>
        <p>Northwest and Continental agree that their alliance is a success, increasing revenue at each by several hundred million dollars each year. But Continental now believes that Northwest's ownership stake actually hurts the alliance, rather than strengthens it.</p>
        <p>''Over time, we have found that stock ownership is an impediment to a successful commercial relationship,'' said a Continental executive who insisted on anonymity. He said it was hard to attract and retain top-notch employees when they knew that Continental would eventually come under Northwest's control.</p>
        <p>Continental's position is similar to the one that Northwest itself took in the mid-1990's, when it successfully prevented KLM Royal Dutch Airlines from increasing its ownership stake in Northwest. KLM ended up selling its Northwest shares, but the two airlines still operate a very successful trans-Atlantic partnership.</p>
        <p>If the government prevails in the antitrust case and Northwest is forced to sell its Continental shares, there is no guarantee that Continental will be the buyer. Mr. Bonderman, who still owns about 3 percent  of Continental's stock, retains the right to bid on the shares first.</p>
        <p>He also owns an undisclosed number of shares in Northwest, as do several of his close business associates, two of whom sit on Northwest's board. One person close to Mr. Bonderman said that he believed siding with the government against Northwest at the upcoming trial could backfire for Continental. If the government loses, Continental would be at the mercy of an angry Northwest.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Bonderman does not serve on the committee of eight independent Continental directors set up specifically to protect the interests of public shareholders in matters regarding Northwest. That committee ended up unanimously endorsing Continental's strategy of siding with the government.</p>
        <p>At the trial, Northwest will be allowed to ask Continental executives leading questions, a right usually reserved for cross-examination of witnesses from the opposing side. The lawyers might even want to ask why, if the government is right in charging that Northwest ultimately controls Continental, Northwest has to worry about being stabbed in the back by its co-defendant.</p>
